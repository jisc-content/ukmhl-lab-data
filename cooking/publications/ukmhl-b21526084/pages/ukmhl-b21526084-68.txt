Caviare is consumed in vast quantities all over the Russian j empire; it is also sent to Italy; Germany and France take con- ! siderable quantities, and England a little. Caviare is a shining . brown substance, in small grains, exactly like brambleberries nearly ripe. It is obtained from sturgeon, which are taken in March, in millions, on their spawning beds in the mouth of the j Danube, the Dnieper, the Don, or the Volga, where both nets and hooks are employed against the fish.

Skate is absurdly rejected by ! some persons. If this fish be hung up for a day or two, then ; cut into slices, broiled, and eaten with butter, it will be delicious. I The female skate is more delicate than the male. The Basse is highly extolled by Pliny and Ovid, but rarely appears at the table of wealthy moderns. Yet, a Cornishraan i will eat a basse boiled, baked, fried, stewed, or made into a pie. j The wholesomest sea-fish are the common, speckled, and green ; cod; haddock, pout, whiting, pollack, whiting pollack, hake, ; forked hake, and ling: the fiesh of all these is white and divides into flakes, and is excellent for invalids.

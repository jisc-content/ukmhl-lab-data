56 OUR VIANDS But the virtues twain of the boil and bake In the cake of Simonellie,” Quoth he. * Then ho, ho, ho, for the rarie showe, When gaffer and gammer agree ; And boil and bake the Motherin cake— The cake of Simonellie.’ It would, however, appear that this is a modern tradition to account for a very ancient name, which is found in French as well as in English, and in mediasval Latin, and which is supposed to be derived from simila, fine flour; and we find the name given to the finest white bread in mediaeval times.* Herrick the poet, writing early in the seventeenth century, speaks of the custom of young people in Gloucester carrying simnels to their parents on Mid-Lent or Mothering Sunday— ‘ I’ll to thee a simnel bring ’Gainst thou go a-mothering ; So that when she blesses thee, Half that blessing thou’lt give me.’ These simnels were usually marked with the figure of Christ or the Virgin Mary, showing that they had some religious significance. The poem quoted above places the origin of the simnel legend at Girlith, on Morecambe Bay; but Shrewsbury has long been famous for the cakes, although until lately they were hardly known except in the western counties, now, however, they can be bought in London, and not only at Mid-Lent but at Christmas.t * See Chambers’s ‘Book of Days,’ p. 336. t At the Congress of the Folk Lore Society, held in October last at Burlington House, a great number of local feasten cakes were exhibited, and among them simnels, differing greatly in form, from Lancashire, Gloucestershire, Shropshire, Norfolk, and Yorkshire.

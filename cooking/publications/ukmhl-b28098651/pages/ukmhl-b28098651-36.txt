OUR VIANDS 32 household, at least in the country, made its own bread; very delicious bread it was, too, sweet and wholesome, brown, without a lot of indigestible bran, and leavened with barm from home-made beer, sometimes rather difficult to procure, so that the family baking had to be put off till the yeast was forthcoming, and then it was necessary to borrow loaves of the neighbours, or to make unleavened cakes upon the hearth, using soda and tartaric acid or buttermilk by way of rising. Then, too, there was a friendly interchange among neighbours of newly-baked loaves, and not only so but of the use of the oven, Mrs. M. heating her oven one week and Mrs. N. the next; or sometimes the dough would be sent to a bakehouse, the tidy servant carrying it wrapped up in a blanket and sundry cloths, and making it up at the baker’s, putting her mistress’s name on it, according to the old nursery rhyme— * Prick it, and dawk it, and mark it with D, And pop it in the oven for baby and me,’ and paying a small sum for the accommodation. The baker’s toll was regulated by law in the days of King John, and according to the ‘ Book of Days ’ was to be ‘ for his own labour, three pence and such bran as might be sifted from the meal,’ whilst he was allowed to add ‘to the prime cost of the wheat for fuel and wear of the oven the price of two loaves; for the services of three men, he was to add to the price of the bread three halfpence; and for two boys, one farthing; for the expenses attending the seal, one halfpenny; for yeast, one halfpenny; for candle, one halfpenny; for wood, threepence; and for wear and tear of the bolting-sieve, one halfpenny.’ * * See Chambers’s ‘Book of Days,’ p. 119, etc.

There is another way of preparing bread- fruit, by throwing it in a heap and allowing it to ferment, it is then beaten into a kind of paste called mahi, and will keep for months, but is sour and indigestible. The South Sea Islanders also make a kind of bread of the root of the Pia (Tacca pinnaiifida), which is beaten to a pulp and subjected to repeated washings, when it forms a sort of arrowroot. Taro, of which we often read in books of travel in the South Seas, is the root of Arum escu/etitum, which, like the manioc, requires steeping and boiling or baking to make it wholesome. It is cooked in the same way as the bread-fruit, and then beaten into a paste-like dough called Poe, which is eaten by being scooped out with the forefinger of the right hand and placed in the mouth, a practice which has caused that finger to be named the Poe finger. In West Africa Pea-nut bread is eaten. This is made by roasting and crushing the nuts and pressing the paste into the skin of a banana.

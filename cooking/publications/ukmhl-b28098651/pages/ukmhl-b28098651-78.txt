A bull to Neptune, an oblation due, Another bull to bright Apollo slew, A milk-white ewe the western winds to please, And one coal-black to calm the stormy seas.’ In the sacrifices of the Hebrews also one or two bullocks sufficed, but it would seem from the account of Josephus, that the table of Solomon was supplied almost as liberally as that of Lo Benguela.

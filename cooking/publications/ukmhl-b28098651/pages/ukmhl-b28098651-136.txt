Along the shores of Great Britain and Ireland the herring, ‘ Bonnie fish and halesome farin’,’ holds the first place among the fisheries, and many hundreds of boats are employed in this industry on the east' and north coasts of Great Britain, Ireland, and the Isle of Man. In the latter interesting little island the herring is, or was, the staple food of the people, and the chosen emblem of justice, the deemsters or judges taking the singular oath that they will administer justice as evenly ‘ as the backbone of the herring lieth in the middle of the fish.’ * In Cornwall, the herring gives place to its first cousin, the pilchard, a smaller and fatter fish, from which a large quantity of oil is extracted.

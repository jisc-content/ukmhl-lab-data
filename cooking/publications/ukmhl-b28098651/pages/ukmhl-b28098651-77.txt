73 CHRISTMAS FARE the coloured ones. The first were offered to the manes of his father; the second, to the Molimo or Great Spirit; and the rest for other purposes. The king made a short speech as he pointed out each victim; and then the sacrificer, holding his assegai just as one would hold a pin, placed its point low down behind the shoulder blade, where it does not spoil the skin for a shield, assuring himself by a gentle titillating motion that it was rightly directed.’ * What a coronation ceremony, and what an idea it gives us of the sanguinary character of these dusky kings and the despotic power they wield over their subjects. ‘ Of course,’ Baines continues, ‘ the slaughter of so many oxen in so con- fined a space was a work of difficulty, especially when some had fallen, and the rest maddened by the sight and smell of blood, made frantic efforts to escape, but there was no con- fusion. The place where the king had dismounted was kept clear by a circle of Majokkas, bound in honour to die upon the spot rather than let him be incommoded; others formed rings round each lot of cattle, and when two heaps had fallen, and there was no room for more in the kotla, the rest were killed outside, as the king successively devoted them. In the evening the carcases were skinned and cut up, and next day the king distributed the meat to his newly- acquired subjects.’ Mr. Baines has also given us the mode of cooking and serving the slaughtered oxen. ‘A couple of earthen cauldrons were simmering on the fire, and a stalwart warrior approaching these, took off the lids, drove a sharp stick into a filthy-looking mass, and finding it sufficiently cooked, har- pooned and hauled out the contents, and heaped them on Baines’s ‘ Gold Regions of South-Eastern Africa,’ p. 35.

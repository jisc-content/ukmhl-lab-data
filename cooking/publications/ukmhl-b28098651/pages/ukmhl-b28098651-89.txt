SUNDR Y MBA TS 85 eaten, with the singular exception that all the fat should be burnt, for the fat as well as the blood of sacrifices seems to have been forbidden to be eaten; and, it may be remembered as one of the sins of the sons of Eli, that they sent their servant and demanded raw flesh with the fat, before it was burned according to the sacred law of sacrifices. The breast and the right shoulder of these sacrifices were allotted to the priests, and thus it came to pass that when Saul was sent to Samuel, the shoulder was set before him as the royal and priestly joint. As to the calf, that was not only offered in sacrifice, like the lamb, but it seems to have been set aside especially for family feasts. The fatted calf, killed to do honour to the returning prodigal, has passed into a proverb, and to ‘kill the fatted calf’ is now synonymous with making a feast of joy. But the calf was from the . earliest times looked upon as a delicacy to set before an honoured guest; hence we are told that when, in the days of Abraham, the three angels came to him as he sat in his tent- door on the plains of Mamre, in the heat of the day, he ‘ ran unto the herd and fetched a calf, tender and good, and gave it to a young man, and he hasted to dress it. And he took butter and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.’ What a vivid picture we have here of the hospitality of :he patriarch, of his mode of life, and of the food he thought neet to place before his guests—the calf tender and good, ^aten as at the present day, with butter and milk, the cake cneaded and baked upon the hearth by Sarah, to be eaten vith it. It was no mean feast for hungry men in the wide )lain, but the celerity with which it is prepared strikes one.

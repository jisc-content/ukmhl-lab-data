GAME AND POULTRY 97 One antelope only remains in a wild state in Europe namely, the chamois; and the hunting of this active little animal—which most nearly resembles the klip-springer of the Cape—is attended with a considerable amount of danger. Those who would realise the pleasures and dangers of chamois hunting, must visit their haunts among the wild peaks of the Tyrolean Alps, and read the tales written by the Baroness Tautphceus—‘ The Initials ’ and * Quits —old now, but wonderfully true in their descriptions of the country and the people, and of that wild chamois hunter and his habits who has been thus described :—‘ The true chamois hunter is a man apart. Gaunt and bony, with “ brown and sinewy knees, scarred and scratched, hair shaggy, dark piercing eyes, marked eyebrows, a bent eagle nose, and high, flesh) ess cheek-bones, with a hungry expression on his face,” to borrow the words of a famous Alpine hunter, the Gamsjager is of a build not to be acquired among the dwellers of cities.’ Once only have I tasted chamois flesh, and can testify to its extreme delicacy and excellence, but it rarely falls to the lot of modern tourists to taste the real article; the Swiss serve up goat flesh cunningly prepared to resemble chamois, but which is no more to be compared with it than is mutton to venison. Time was when the only specimen of foreign game which ippeared on English tables was the French partridge, which las xong been naturalised among us, and of which a poet vrites— As I was standing by a wood one day, A little partridge came my way.

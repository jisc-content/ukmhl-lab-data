In like manner the porcupine is esteemed a delicacy in South Africa, but its next-of-kin here, the hedgehog, is only eaten by gipsies. The eel, and even the great conger, is eaten with relish ; but the snake, which is said to be good and wholesome, is regarded with horror and loathing by men rendered squeamish by civilisation. The lordly elephant is made to contribute his quota of food to his pursuers, the foot being the tit bit; but the lion and tiger, being carnivorous, are not appreciated by civilised man any more than the shark, the eagle, the vulture, and many other birds of the air, beasts of the earth, and fishes of the great sea, which are greedily devoured by savages. Even the hyaena is eaten by the Bushmen, although it is so hated by them that every one passing the carcase gives it a blow with a whip or stick.* The whale and the seal are highly appreciated by the Greenlanders and Eskimos, although hunger alone would cause them to be relished by ourselves.

3i BREAD bread consumed by men in our own country must have been as unpalatable as the rye bread of Germany or the Fladbrod of Norway, for in seasons of scarcity it was some- times made of acorns steeped in water to destroy the bitter- ness; and even as late as 1546 Du Bellay, Bishop of Mans, in representing to Francis I. the misery existing in the provinces, assured him that in many localities the people had nothing to eat but bread made of acorns.* There was also a sort of bread sold known as horse bread, in which beans and peas were the chief ingredients, never- theless, even in the fourteenth century there would apppar to have been different kinds of wheaten bread made and sold by bakers, the finest being the simnel bread before mentioned; the next quality was known as wastel, then came French bread called also puffe or cocket; after that came tourte, which must have resembled our whole-meal bread, and which was in use by the common people and in monasteries. Of this there was also an inferior sort known as trete, from which some of the fine flour had been sifted; and lastly there was black bread made of barley and rye.f Some of us are old enough to remember when every * In Tyndale’s ‘ Sardinia,’ p. 191, we read: ‘ The acorn-bread, which forms the general food of the people of Cagliari, is thus prepared. The acorns when shelled are put into a large seething-pot with water which has been strained through the ashes of burnt vegetable matter and clay. This lye extracts the bitterness of the acorn, and gives a consistency to the mixture, which is boiled down till it assumes a reddish-brown colour, when it is taken out, dried in the sun, and cut into cakes.’ t The ordinary food of the Russian peasant consists of black rye bread and cabbage broth thickened with oatmeal, but the famine has lately deprived them of even this meagre fare, and they have been compelled to eat bread largely composed of bark of trees, unwholesome herbs, earth, and sometimes a handful of rye.

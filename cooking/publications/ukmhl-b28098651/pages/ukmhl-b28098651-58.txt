OUR VIANDS 54 compromise was arrived at, by which the cake was first boiled and then baked, and this turned out so very satisfactorily that cakes thus prepared became famous under the name of ‘ Simnels,’ from the first syllables of the names of the old couple. The tradition has been embodied in the following poem :— ‘THE CAKE OF SIMONELLIE.’* * Where Girlith village looks adown To birlie Morecambe Bay, Old gammer Nell did blythelie dwell With Simon Halliday; And the good God keepit them both from bale, As the worthie paire did pray. * Three sonnes had they, lustie, strong; The elder at the sea, The mid one for a prentis bond, Youngest at mother’s knee, “Too young is he to earn his bredde, And I wonna spare all three,” Quoth she. ‘ The Christmasse-tyde goes by apace, And Lenten time is here ; Bob-crabbes are forbidden taste, The jollie boule goes drere. “ Cheere thee, good gaffer,” then sayd Nell ; “ It is but once a year : ‘ “ A sennight and sen days are past, Another sennight in— And now draws on the rorie feste Ycleped Motherin, When the bairn draws nere to the mother deare, And when festing is no sin,” Quoth she. * Walcott (Bodk), No. 173.

DAIRY PRODUCE 125 but they are not in general use. There are, however, several kinds of cream cheeses, and what are known as soft cheeses, much esteemed, such as Bath cheeses, Bon-dons, Camembert, etc. The true cream cheese is made simply by putting cream in a cloth, and allowing all the moisture to run away from it, and then moulding it into shape, pressing and turning it daily till ripe; but soft cheeses are made in various ways, one of which is given in verse attributed to the celebrated Dr. Jenner, of vaccination fame, as follows :— : Would you make a soft cheese ? Then I’ll tell you how : Take a gallon of milk, quite fresh from the cow ; Ere the rennet is added, the dairyman’s daughter Must throw in a quart of the clearest spring water. When perfectly curdled, so white and so nice, You must take it all out of the dish with a slice, And put it ’thout breaking with care in the vat With a cheese-cloth at bottom—be sure to mind that. This delicate matter take care not to squeeze, But fill as the whey passes off by degrees. Next day you may turn it, and do not be loth To wipe it quite dry with a fine linen cloth ; That this must be done you cannot well doubt, As long as you see the whey oozing out. The cheese is now finished, and nice it will be, If enveloped in leaves from the green ashen tree ; Or, what will do better—at least, full as well— In nettles just plucked from the bank of the dell.’ There is a kind of cream cheese made from goats’ milk, which, under the name of ricotta, is much eaten in Italy; it is very sweet and palatable, and has evidently been in use from very ancient times. The vendors carry it through the streets on their heads, like the muffin sellers here, and retail it by the centime to poor purchasers.

4 The Gourmet's Guide to Europe into the gravy of a joint, forms part of every French dinner, large or small ; and in the battle of the kitchen gardens the foreigners beat us nearly all along the line, though I think that English asparagus is better than the white monsters of Argenteuil. A truffled partridge, a partridge a la Bourguignonne, cooked in a terrine with a red wine sauce, or the homely Perdrix aux choux, or the splendid Faisan a la Financiere show that there are many more ways of treating a game bird than plain roasting him ; and a woodcock, in my humble opinion, never tastes so well as when it has been flambe, an auto-da-fe which takes place almost under the diner’s nose. The Parisian eats a score of little birds we are too proud to mention in our cookery books ; he knows the difference between a mauviette and an alouette, and I trust insists on his cook not sending him to table the skylarks, for a true gourmet should never encourage the slaughter of any winged thing that sings. Perhaps the greatest abasement of the Briton, whose ancestors called the French “Froggies” in scorn, comes when his first morning in Paris he orders for breakfast with joyful expectation a dish of the thighs of the little frogs from the vine- yards. An Austrian pastry-cook has a lighter hand than a French one, and the heathen Turk makes the best sweetmeats in the world, but the Parisian open tarts and cakes and the friandisesy the creams, and the ice, or coupe-jacque at the end of the Gallic repast are excellent. Let me omit the regulation long moan over the dis- appearance of the great restaurants, the dining-places which made much culinary history. The Riche, the Cafe Veron, Hardi’s, D’Hortesio’s, Bignon’s, the Trois Freres Provencaux have either disappeared or have been converted into brasseries or tavernes, and men swill beer in the Marivaux where poor Joseph flourished his knives over ducks of surpassing juiciness.

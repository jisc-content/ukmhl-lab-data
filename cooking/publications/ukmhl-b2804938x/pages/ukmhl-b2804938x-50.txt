The chateau is just outside the Bois, and the steam trams of the Chemin de Fer du Bois run past it. One break- fasts there very pleasantly on race days. The Pavilion Royal, at the near end of the lake in the Bois, used to be a bourgeois restaurant, where one Pavilion Royal, might breakfast and dine in compara- Bois de Boulogne tively humble company at a compara- tively humble rate.

The Chalet du Cycle, which also used to be a very bourgeois restaurant, has also now grown proud, and calls itself L’Ermitage de Longchamps. The Restaurant de la Cascade is a gay little cafe near the racecourse, and many people breakfast on its lawn on race days. The Chalet des Isles is a favourite lunching-place when the lakes are frozen. In the Avenue Victor Hugo is Carron’s, a simple Carron's and cheap restaurant, which is some- Avenue Victor times patronised in cold or wet weather Hug0 by men going to the races. A gar- gantuan dinner can be obtained there at five or six francs. The Select Bar is a little restaurant, and is rather off the beaten track, but the St. Cloud tramcars pass it. It is kept by two sisters who give their personal attention to everything with excellent results. A very quiet, little- frequented eating-house it was, and the prices very moderate.

289 Spain Andalusian Cookery Seville is the headquarters of Andalusian cookery, which has its own particular dishes. Sopa de cuarto de hora (soup of a quarter of an hour) has bread, onions, garlic, peas, mussels, pieces of fish amongst its ingredients. It is not a soup to essay until the palate has become attuned to Andalusian cookery. Sopa de Almajas (mussel soup), Sopa de A jo (garlic soup), and Sopa de Jamon Picado, a clear soup, with ham and hard-boiled eggs cut into small dice, and added to it are some of the Andalusian soups. The Sopa al Jerez, is a clear brown soup with sherry added to it. Of omelettes there are two kindsâ€”one so light that it resembles a souffle ; the other a heavy omelette, to which potatoes or wild asparagus shoots are some- times added. This omelette is not at all a bad imitation of leather. Eggs poached in hot milk, and Huevos a la Flamen^a (Gipsy Eggs), are the best known of the egg dishes. The Gipsy Eggs have now become a common dish everywhere in Spain, but they were originally a Sunday dish at the Hotel de Madrid in Seville. No other kitchen in Spain had the recipe, and no one knows who gave it to the cook of the Madrid. Gipsy Eggs are cooked thus : a mixture of potatoes, boiled wild asparagus, boiled green peas,onions, a little garlic, ham, or bacon and tomatoes is fried in oil. The eggs are broken on to this mixture when it is well cooked and allowed to set lightly. The dish is served very hot. Fried fish is a Spanish delicacy, and nowhere in the world is the fish better cooked than in the fish-shops of Seville. It is the fashion after the theatre to buy 25 centimes worth of fried fish, which is wrapped in brown paper, taken home, and eaten with the fingers, a Manzanilla being the. best accom- paniment.

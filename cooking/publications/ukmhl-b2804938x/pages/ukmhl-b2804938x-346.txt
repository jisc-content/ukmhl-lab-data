324 The Gourmets Guide to Europe have preserved, show that Sacher’s is aware that Italy has an excellent national cuisine. The head waiter, who speaks a little English, is a very useful man to call into council if the table waiter is inclined to be too anxious that the diner should be a source of profit to the restaurant. The table waiter at Sacher’s I generally find is not satisfied to take note of the tip given to the head waiter who makes out and presents the bill. He expects a tip for himself. This to many English is their first notification that the indiscrimi- nate tipping which is prevalent in Austria extends to the restaurants. At the watering-places, Carlsbad, Marienbad, and the other Bohemian Baths, there are three waiters who expect a tip at mid-day dinner and supper—the head waiter, the table waiter, and the small boy who brings the wine. An Austrian at any except the very smart establishments generally gives 3d., 2d., and id. to the three waiters according to their grade. An Englishman generally gives more. Meissl and Schadn’s, which presents a very highly- decorated exterior to the Karthnerstrasse, and has an entrance in the market-place behind the house, is the typical Viennese restaurant. In the dining-rooms on the first floor, officials, officers, and the well-to-do citizens eat pickled veal, smoked sucking-pig, stewed beef of various kinds, stewed pork, Rls'i Bisi (rice and beans), and other national dishes. In various small rooms on the ground floor and in the basement varlets of various degrees revel at immensely reduced rates. Hartmann’s, almost opposite to the Bristol, is very Fran.7 Hart- popular at the time of the mid-day mann’s, meal. Its walls are panelled with The Ring green silk, and its windows command a view of the busy life of the Ring. Its cuisine is Austrian. Meissl and Schadn’s, Karth nerstrasse

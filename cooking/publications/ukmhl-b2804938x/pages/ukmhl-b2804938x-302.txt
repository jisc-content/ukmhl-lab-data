The prices of these dishes are all between i and 2 pesetas. Under the heading of fritures, all kinds of conchas and Escalopitas and Croquettas are to be found, as well as the Frito Mixto ; and the fish column gives an interesting selection of the sea denizens of the coast—Rap, Calamares, Mer- luza, Pouvine, and others.

Foezola (pronounced Fayzola) is a local dish. It consists of white beans and sausages, the beans being boiled before being placed in the oven to bake with the sausages. Arroz con Anguillas (rice and eels), into which octopi and mussels are often introduced, is another dish of the town, and so is Menudos de Gallina (chicken tripe).

There are many light inexpensive wines of local growth, such as Soller, Castell del Remey, and Olzinellas, both red and white.

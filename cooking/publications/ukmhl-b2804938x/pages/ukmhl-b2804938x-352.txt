33° ^he Gourmet's Guide to Bur ope doctor is never allowed to run a finger at will down a Speisen-Karte. Eggs, lean ham, quite plain fish, boiled beef, roast venison or veal or mutton, partridge, chicken, kompotts and vegetables comprise the entire choice. Luckily most of these things are excellent at Carlsbad. Of the fowls I have already spoken. The Tepl, the brown stream which ripples down through many miles of pine-clad hills to fall into the Eger below Carlsbad, is full of excellent trout, and so are many of the other streams in Bohemia. These trout are generally cooked au bleu. Zander, the pike- perch, is always to be obtained ; and Fogash, a Lake Balaton fish with firm white flesh, is served grilled and is excellent. The partridges shot on the highlands about the Abbey of Tepl are fine plump birds, and partridge shooting in Austria com- mences a month earlier than it does in England. About 4 crowns is the price of a partridge at any of the best restaurants, and a medium-sized trout costs about 3 crowns. At all the restaurants a table d'hote dinner is to be found which is suitable for people who are not going through a cure. The price of this dinner varies from 5 crowns at the best restaurants to 3 crowns 50 heller at the more moderate ones. I take at random one of Weishaupt’s 5-crown dinners, and find that it con- sists of Creme de Riz, Sandre sauce Hollandaise, Saute de Veau Printaniere, Rost-beef roti (sic), Pouding aux fruit—all dishes banned to those on “ cure ” diet. Most of the little restaurants on the river and the hills have some specialty, generally of tarts or some other entremet. At Hans Heiling the Kaiserschmarren is a specialty, while at the Hunting Lodge the Apfelstrudl is especially delicious. Herr Pupp owns a very considerable portion of Carlsbad. His great hotel and restaurant and cafe and garden at the end of the Alte Wiese cover

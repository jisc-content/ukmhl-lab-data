Dark green velvet settees and chairs of black leather all tend to give the little room a quiet note. A portrait of one of the old Prussian kings and a portrait of the Kaiser in white tunic and a black cuirass adorn the walls. On the menu for lunch I found coquilles of salmon, lobster omelette, lobsters, herrings and beans, pork cutlets, a gulyas of veal, stuffed chicken, gosling, wild cherry open tart, and cream. I ate the omelette, a cutlet, and tart, drank a pint of Zeltinger and some Mattoni water, and paid a bill which came exactly to 5 marks. The cookery of the house is excellent and, as Julius Ewest is a wine merchant of the highest reputation, the wines in the cellar of his little res- taurant are admirable. The Restaurant Hiller at 62 Unter den Linden, and the Restaurant Dressel at 50 Unter den Linden, used to be two typical Berlin res- taurants, but fashion has rather passed them by of late years. The Hiller still retains some of its old patrons, and Louis Adlon, who is its proprietor, is hoflieferant to the Kaiser, and one of the firm which owns the great hotel near the Brandenburg Gate. The prices of meals at Dressel’s are : dejeuners, 2.50 marks ; dinners, 3.50 and 5.50 marks ; and suppers, 3 marks. A band plays till 1 p.m. At Hiller’s the dejeuner is 2.50 marks ; dinner, 5 marks ; and there is a “ Theatre-Souper ” at 5 marks, which is the most popular of all the meals at this restaurant. The Hotel Restaurants The Kaiserhof was the first hotel to give Berlin a restaurant and a palm lounge, such as the gourmet en voyage is accustomed to in Paris and in London, and Dressel’s, 50 Unter den Lunden.

Austria 333 the Savoy, and a decorative Nubian in a long blue garment always stands at the front door. Just as aristocratic as the Savoy, or even more so, and certainly more peaceful, is the Bristol, which has a little hill of its own in the West End. The Bristol, The brother and sister of the Czar West End generally stay there for an autumn “ cure,” and on those occasions there are always one or two quiet men in the garden taking an interest in the scenery. The cooking at the Bristol is noticeably good, and the fact that the proprietor of this hotel married a daughter of the great house of Pupp may have some- thing to say to this pleasant state of things. A rival to the Bristol and Savoy is Lord Westbury’s great hotel now rising on the Helenenhof, an hotel which is to be opened in 1912. A model of this new great house of fashion stood all last year in the upper station of the funicular railway, and the building, when completed, will be an ornament to Carlsbad. It will have command of magnificent views both up and down the valley. In previous editions of this book I have had a good word to say concerning the Goldener Schild, but that sound, old-fashioned hostelry is now being pulled down, and on its site is to rise the.new Kursaal. Since Herr Weishaupt rose to eminence every proprietor of a provision shop has established a restau- rant. One of the most popular of these potzl’s, is behind Potzl’s shop in the Market Marketplace Place. I have no doubt as to the excellence of the food provided there, but on a summer night the restau- rant has always looked to me to be a very warm place. I have, however, eaten, and eaten very well, in the new and more airy room which Herr Potzl has opened on the first floor, and which looks down on to the market- place. The best butter, and the best ham, and the best honey in Carlsbad are to be found at Potzl’s.

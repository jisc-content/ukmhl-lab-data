Sweden 375 uniform of petty officers, are to be found playing in the afternoon at these restaurants. The Hasselbacken, on an island in the fjord, is the most interesting of the Stockholm restaurants. On the island is a park, and a little town Hasselbacken, of theatres and circuses. The park Skansen is known as the Skansen. It is a botanical garden and a zoological garden in one, with some of the features of a museum added to them. Part of the seven thousand acres are left as virgin forest. The animals are housed as nearly in their natural state as possible ; the bears have their caves, the birds have aviaries so high that pines grow inside, the reindeer are in an enclosure of forest. Outside this park is the Hasselbacken, a broad-roofed building with a wide verandah on the first floor, whence one looks over the garden with its hundreds of little tables to the harbour and its islets and the town. The season during which the Hasselbacken is opened is from May to the end of September. During the early part of the season Tziganes play in one of the rooms. In summer a somewhat noisy orchestra plays in the garden. The price of dinner, a prix -fixe, is 3 kr. 50 ore ; this includes soup, fish, meat, releve (gener- ally the Swedish guinea-fowl called hjdrpe) and ice. Wine and coffee are of course extra. The Hasselbacken is often used for the giving of banquets of ceremony, but the dinner at 3 kr. 50 ore is more likely to interest the stranger within the gates than the more extensive feasts, so I give a typical menu of this very reasonably priced repast :â€” Puree a la Reine. Saumon fume aux Epinards. Selle de Mouton aux Legumes. Gelinottes roties. Salade. Soufflee au Citron.

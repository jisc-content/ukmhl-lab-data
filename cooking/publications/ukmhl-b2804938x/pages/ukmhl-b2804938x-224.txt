I myself have generally stayed at the Kaiserhof, because I like to eat my supper on its creeper-hung terrace and look across the broad valley to the Taunus hills ; but there are half-a-dozen hotels in the town (the Nassauerhof in particular, which many people consider the best hotel in Germany) having capital restaurants, serving table d'hote meals, attached to them. The Rose has a little terrace, looking on to the gardens, which is a pleasant supping place. Herr Ruthe’s Restaurant at the Kurhaus is the one quite first-class dining place not attached to an Ruthe’s, Kur- hotel. In the winter, in the dining- haus room and the glassed-in verandah, and in summer under the little trees, with the lake in full view, all the people who have grown weary of looking at the same faces in their hotel restaurants may be found eating their dinners. Herr Ruthe is always to be found somewhere in the establishment, and any diner who does not know the resources of the establishment cannot do better than consult him before ordering dinner. The Foyer Restaurant in the Royal Theatre is a quiet and pleasant place at which to take meals in the daytime.

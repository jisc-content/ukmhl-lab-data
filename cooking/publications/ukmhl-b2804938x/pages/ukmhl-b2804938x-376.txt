354 ^he Gourmet's Guide to Europe but to which the Servians generally go by rail. There is a little hotel there which has a glassed-in verandah, and some villas which are taken by the month by the merchants of Belgrade, and tree-clad hills with paths made on them, and a little lake with a punt on it, a fountain and a rose-garden. The host of the hotel, bidden to do his best, gave the little party of picnickers, of whom I was one, some vegetable soup, veal cutlets, rice and potatoes, and pancakes and blackberries. Servia is not a country in which a gourmet should call a halt to enjoy good things to eat and good things to drink. AFTER DINNER At Belgrade I found at the theatre the usual patriotic drama, in which the Servians are the victors over the Turks, and after seeing one act shirked the rest. There was no alternative amusement, and even the hall-porter at the Grand could suggest nothing except an evening in a cafe where a band played.

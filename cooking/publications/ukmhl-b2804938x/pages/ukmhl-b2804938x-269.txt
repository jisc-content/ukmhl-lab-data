Italy 247 little pillars, is decorated in cream and light green. The place is quite Venetian without being Venetian to excess. There is always a bustle in the big room, and the little boys who serve the wine scuttle about like lamplighters. The lunch of the day, of fish, meat, a paste dish, cheese, and fruit, costs 1. 2.50, and an ample dinner is provided at 1. 3.50. A lunch of fried cuttle-fish, a Venetian dish of a big veal cutlet and rice, some cheese, half a bottle of red Val Policella, with a little effervescence in it, and a half bottle of Nocera table water, and my bill for this was 1. 4.50, the expensive item being the wine.

It can also be reached Pignole by water, but I have always found my way to it by the narrow alleys with the help of arrows on the walls. As one sits in the farthest room close to the three windows, which are generally kept hermetically shut, the reflection of light from the water of the canal dances on the ceiling, and the passing gondoliers look in over the little blinds and envy the people who sit at lunch or dinner. There are three rooms in the Vapore, all yellow and brown in their decorations, and one of these has a skylight as a means of giving light and a certain amount of ventilation to it. There are ventilators in the other rooms, which, when the smoke gets dense, are opened, and a current of fresh air comes into the rooms. The cooking at the Vapore is de- cidedly good, and distinctly Venetian and cheap. Pasticci di Macheroni, Capretti, scrambled eggs and tomatoes are some of its specialties. A lunch I ordered there consisted of a frittura of all kinds of little fish,gropetti romana (v$al with a rich sauce), Gor- gonzola cheese, and a half bottle of the white wine of the houseâ€”for the ordinario, both red and white,

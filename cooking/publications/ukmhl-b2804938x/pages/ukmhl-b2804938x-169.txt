Belgian Towns 147 The Taverne St. Denis is a little eating-house in the main street which is quite clean The Taverne st in its appointments, and where I have Denis, Rue de obtained a quite satisfactory fillet, and la ChaPelle washed it down with some excellent beer from Bruges. The tea-rooms of Ostende are Marchal’s, on the Boulevard van Iseghem. They and the patissier’s shop form the corner of the block Marchal's which the new theatre occupies. The Boulevard van rooms, airy and marble-walled, are quite first-class; the waiters are in liveries which fit them ; and a Roumanian gipsy band plays. The foyer of the theatre is immediately above these rooms, and steps from the theatre hall lead into them. They serve as the theatre cafe, and the Englishman who wants something stronger than tea between the acts can be sure that his “ peg ” will be compounded of good materials. Maxim’s, like its Paris namesake, Maxim’S becomes merry about midnight, and Boulevard van remains open till the small hours. Iseghem The Clubs of Ostende The Club Prive of the Kurhaus is, at intervals be- tween raids and other disagreeable events, a baccarat club, and there is a roulette table which is in use during certain hours of the day. It was during the season of 1910 a branch of the Cercle Litteraire in the town, but that did not prevent the police and magistrate from Ghent making a descent upon it. Forty-eight hours generally elapse between application being made and the acceptance of a candidate who belongs to a recognised London club. It is wise to send in an application to the secretary before arriving at Ostende. Entrance fee is 1 louis.

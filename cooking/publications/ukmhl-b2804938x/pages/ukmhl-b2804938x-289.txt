Italy 267 hospitable club does not exist in Europe.” The Nuovo is rather more quiet than the Caccia, and there is less play than at the larger club. A Ladies’ Club has recently been instituted in Rome. AFTER DINNER During the winter there is always something of interest to be seen both at the opera and at the comedy theatres, for though Rome does not hold the same position to Italy in the art wTorld that London does to England, many authors and composers give the capital the first taste of their novelties. There are half-a-dozen large theatres, and four or five small ones. The music halls are the Margherita and Olympia. Naples There is a certain man in a certain London club who has a grievance against Italy in general, against Naples in particular, and, to descend to minute detail, against one Neapolitan restaurant above all others. He tells his tale to all comers as a warning to those who will travel in “ foreign parts.” He returned from a long turn of service in India, and, landing at Naples, concluded that as he was in Europe he could get British food. He went to a restaurant which shall be nameless, and ordered a “ chump chop.” He had the greatest difficulty, through an interpreter, to explain exactly what it was that he wanted, and then was forced to wait for an hour before it appeared. When the bill was presented it frightened him, but the proprietor, on being summoned, said that as such an extraordinary joint had been asked for, he had been compelled to buy a whole sheep to supply it. This is a warning not to ask for British dishes in a Neapolitan restaurant.

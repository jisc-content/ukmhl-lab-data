The Cadiz Clubs The Casino Gaditano is the chief club in Cadiz. This is not a club as we understand it, since no meals are served there. It is, however, a social centre, and here take place dances and balls and entertainments to foreign royalties, &c. At certain periods of the year roulette is played there.

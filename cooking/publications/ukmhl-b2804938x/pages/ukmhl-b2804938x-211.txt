German Towns 189 pewter tankards all upside down, arranged as the ornamentation of the walls. Here the fare is exactly similar to the little house behind the Moritzcapelle, but the surroundings are not so quaint, and it does not boast of any great celebrities of bygone days as having been its patrons. To the third house of the little sausage I have not made a pilgrimage, and have no special details concerning it. At the Volks Fest, held in September just outside the town, all the makers of sausages have booths, and all the breweries have gigantic tents serving as beer- halls, thus bringing together two of the staple products of the town. Of the taverns in Nuremberg at which general fare is served the Goldenes Posthorn, almost opposite the Brathwurst Glocklein, is the oldest and Goldenes most celebrated. It is almost as old as Posthorn, the little house across the way, and its 61ocken^asse rooms and passages are so crowded with old clocks and old pictures, warming pans, tankards, and other precious rubbish, that it looks more like a museum than a wine restaurant. Its shutters are adorned with paintings, and the golden posthorn finds a place in much of the ornamentation. It was founded some time in the fifteenth century, and Adam Kraft is the special celebrity who used to be a customer, and who is honoured on its walls above all others. Another historical haunt is the cellar in the Nassauer Haus, the old building just across the way from the Church of St. Lawrence. To get to Nassauer Haus, the Nassauer Keller the descent of some Karolinen- precipitous stairs into the bowels of the strasse earth is necessary, and the ventilation of this old cellar is not of the best, but no doubt ventilation was not much considered by the architects of the thirteenth century, which was the period at which this part of the house was built.

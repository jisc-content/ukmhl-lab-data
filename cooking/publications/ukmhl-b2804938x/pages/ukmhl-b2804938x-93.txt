French Provincial Fovens 71' restaurant. The cookery there is quite good, and the prices are about the same as those at the Royal, which seem to me not cheap, but on the other hand not extortionate. Just outside the Casino gates, and under the same management, is the Casino Brasserie, a long wooden shanty painted in bright colours, where The Casino a little band plays and many cool Bocks Brasserie are consumed, and where there is much jollity. An excellent lunch is to be obtained for 2.50 francs, and the dinner at 3.50 francs is also excellent at the price. All sorts and conditions of men and women lunch and dine there, and any one who does not require quietude while he takes his meals will find the place distinctly amusing. The Faisan Dore, kept by M. Cabois, is a restaurant above a charcutier’s shop in the Grand Rue. A little flight of stairs leads to the first floor, The Faisan Dore, where is the dining-room, and in the 74 Grand Rue interior, on the ground floor, can be seen a white- capped, white-jacketed cook, very busy amid the Vandyke shadows of his kitchen. The prices are moderate, and the resident English give the little restaurant a good deal of their custom. The Restaurant A. Lefevre, in the Rue de 1’Hotel de Ville, has a clientele of men of the brush and pen. It is to all outward appearance a workmen’s Restaurant A cafe, for it turns to the street a room Lefevre, Rue de with brown walls and black covered 1 Hotel de Vllle seats against the walls and zinc tables. Little chairs and some white painted tables are outside on the terasse, an old woman who is the grand-mere sits at the comptoir inside. This simple establishment is the restaurant beloved of old by Whistler, and Madame Veuve Bellet, the young and sprightly widow who is the proprietress, will tell you how he used to come there every day to breakfast, saying that he could not get a Sole Dieppoise really well cooked anywhere else.

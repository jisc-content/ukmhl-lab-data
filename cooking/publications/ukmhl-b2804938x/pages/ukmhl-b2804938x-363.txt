Hungary 341 the Club of the Nobles, and the Club of the Gentry— allow their cooks, who are always Frenchmen, or at least professors of the Cuisine Fran^aise, to own and manage restaurants on the ground floor of the club buildings. The National Casino Restaurant I found a quiet, high, white room, not overcrowded with tables. The maitre cThotel talks excellent French, National Casino, the dishes on the carte de jour are all Kossuthgasse French, the people dining were mostly celebrities. On one occasion the Hungarian Minister of War, his wife and aide-de-camp, were supping at one table, while at another was the Minister of Education enter- taining some friends. It has all the appearance and the tone of a good Parisian restaurant. The Restaurant Muller is the dependance of the Club of the Gentry. I never mastered the name ot the street in which it is situated. Its Restaurant rooms high and white, lighted by hang- Muller ing lamps, have, in crimson curtains and other details, something of the Hungarian national character. • A very fine gipsy band, said to be the best band of its kind in Buda-Pesth, plays in this restaurant, and it is a revelation to hear how the Czardas sound when played by such musicians. The cookery is French. This was the dinner given me at the restaurant by an Englishman who knows his Buda-Pesth well ; but the Sangleron was the only dish out of the beaten track. It was, however, an excellently cooked dinner. Creme Parmentier. Rouget Grille, Vin Rouge. Boeuf Garni. Sangleron Raifort. Poulet Roti. Salade Entremets. Dessert.

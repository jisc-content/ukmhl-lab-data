Asperges d’Argenteuil, Sauce Mousseline. Duchesses a la Parisienne. Bombes glacees. Fromages. Dessert. The excellent gourmet who sent me the above menu comments thus on the Parfait de foie gras au Cham- pagne : “The essence of this dish is to have an abundance of the wine jelly well iced in waves all round the foie gras.” This is the extract from Miss Insley’s article: “We do not have the ‘zakousky’ so familiar in stories of Russian life, but which I have learned only to expect at Russian dinner-parties. Here we begin with soup, having with it a tiny hot scone with chopped meat inside. The soup, instead of the usual cabbage soup, is made of beets, and there is thick sour cream for it. The Russian duck is very tender and toothsome with pickled cherries ; the potatoes bear signs of having been frost-bitten ; there is a plate of crumbled green cheese into which the Countess puts a slice of black bread and butter, butter side downwards, and passes the plate on to her brother, who serves himself in the same way ; and there is a big decanter of red kvas for all who want it. After the duck there are veal cutlets. For the sweets we have a concoction which looks like treacle, and which is made of the stewed juices of various fruits.” Iced kvas is a common drink of the country, and in the Caucasus some very good wines are made. There is a champagne of the Don which often finds its way into bottles with Rheims labels on them.

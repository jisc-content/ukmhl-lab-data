AFTER DINNER The two Casinos, each having its theatre and each being quite catholic in the matter of entertainments, : giving opera, operetta, variety shows, and fireworks, supply all the after-dinner needs of Aix, and the Club Prives put no unnecessary difficulties in the way of respectable strangers becoming members. Vichy Outside the hotels, the restaurants attached to ! which give in most cases a good table d'hote dinner for 6 francs and a dejeuner for 4, there are but few restaurants, for most people who come to Vichy live ! en pension, making a bargain with their hotel for their food for so much a day—a bargain which does not encourage them to go outside and take their meals. The Casino of course has its restaurant. The Alhambra Taverne is a restaurant and Brasserie in the Rue Sornin, and the Fran^ais is in the Rue du Marche. There are several small restaurants in the environs of Vichy. In the valleys of the Sichon and the Jolan, two streams which join near the village of Cusset and then flow into the Allier, are two little restaurants, each to be reached by a carriage road. Both the Restaurant les Malavaux near the ruins, and the Restaurant de l’Ardoisiere near the Cascade of Gourre-Saillant, have their dishes, each of them making a specialty of trout and crayfish from the little river that flows hard by. At the Montagne Verte, whence a fine view of the valley of the Allier is obtainable, and at one or two other of the places to which walks and drives are taken, there are cafes and inns where decent food is obtainable.

.zAustria 325 The Stephan Keller (Cafe de l’Europe) in the Stephanplatz is a much frequented cafe. It was originally an underground resort in the vaults of St. Stephan, but it has risen to a higher sphere. This house is much used by the colony of artists who also are to be found at Hartmann’s, Gause’s, and the Rother Igel. The wines of the country of Retz, Mailberg, Pfaffstadt, Gumpoldskirchen, Klosterneuberg, Nuss- berg, and Voslau should all be tasted, most of them being more than drinkable. Beer, however, is the real Viennese drink, and the very light liquid, ice cold, is a delightful beverage. There are wine houses—Esterhazy Keller, for instance, where all classes go to drink the Hungarian wines from the estates of Prince Esterhazy—without number, and many of'these have their specialty of Itrian or Dalmatian wines. The Rathhaus Keller, a great arched series of rooms, has its various wine vaults, some patronised by the gentry, some by the common people. The summer resorts are mostly for the people only ; they are butterfly cafes, opening in the summer and closing in the winter, and if their clientele deserts them there are only some painted boards, tables, and benches to be carted away and a hedge to be dug out ; but in the Prater there are some more substantial establishments—Sacher’s, a branch of the town house, and the Rondeau and Lusthaus, which are made the turning-points in the daily drives of the Viennese. Vienna keeps very early hours, most of the cafes closing well before midnight, unless they are kept open for some special fete. In the environs of Vienna there are pleasant restau- rants on the Kalenberg, up which a little railway runs, and at Klosterneuberg, where one can drink the excellent wine of the place at the Stiftskeller before

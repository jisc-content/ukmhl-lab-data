Austria 331 a very large amount of ground, and he has as well many houses which are dependances of the hotel. The cafe and restaurant accommodate pupp’s, many hundreds of people. There is Alte wiese a grove of little horse chestnut trees where red-clothed tables are set, and where simple food and tea and coffee and beer and ices are served by little waitresses in black. A glass shelter borders one side of this grove, and there is a large bandstand where one of the many bands there are in Carlsbad plays in the afternoon and evening.

The windows are taken out in hot weather and leave frames of crimson and gold, the decorations are gorgeous, and there is an abundance of gas and electric lights.

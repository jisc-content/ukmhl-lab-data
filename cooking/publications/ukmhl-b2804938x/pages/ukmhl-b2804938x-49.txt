1Tar is 27 controlled by M. Charles Mourier of the Cafe de Paris. The Pavilion d’Armenonville, another of the Boi^ restaurants, has always been in high favour with smart Paris. It has been the custom since Armenonville its building that men shall wear dress Bois de clothes when dining at this restaurant, Boulogne an unwritten rule which has not been enforced in any other restaurant. When the very broad glass shelter which runs round the house is filled with diners, the ladies in dinner dresses and plumed and feathered hats, the men in their evening black and white ; when the tables are heaped with flowers; when the trees outside are garlanded with coloured lanterns ; when the two bands, playing alternately, make gentle music which does not interfere with conversation, then Armenonville forms a scene brilliant enough for any theatre to stage. The luxurious surroundings have, of course, to be paid for, but though the prices at these little palaces in the great wood are high, they are not exorbitant. The Chateau de Madrid used to be a collection of old buildings grouped about a courtyard in which were trees. Under these trees were chateau de little iron tables ; Japanese lanterns Madrid, Bois were amidst the foliage; and there de Boulogne was a pleasant sensation in dining thus in a half light, with the buildings around all in deep shadow. The old buildings have now disappeared, and have been replaced by a brand new white restaurant, with great plate glass windows and large mirrors, and decoration of trellis work, and by a new hotel which stands facing the road. The trees still remain, and under them on hot evenings the little tables are still set. But the charm of the old chateau has disappeared. There is a blaze of electric light, and a band plays all the airs of the moment. M. Marius, of Henry’s of the Place

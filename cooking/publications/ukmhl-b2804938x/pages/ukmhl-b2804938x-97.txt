French Provincial Fowns 75 bottles of cider, and a covered dish in which sizzles the trout. The cider proves to be excellent, as it should be, for we are in Normandy, the cider country. The Italian girl begins to sing songs, “Santa Lucia ” and uAdio Napoli,” and the others, which always conjure up a vision of moonlit nights in the Bay of Naples and the singers rowing round the vessel.

The Italian girl, her mouth full of bread and sausage, comes to the door of the barn kitchen to wish us the pretty Italian equivalent of “ Au revoir,” and “ le petit,” clasping a toy boat, comes with her to wave

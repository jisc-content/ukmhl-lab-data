326 The Gourmet's Guide to Europe one admires the view from the terrace, or looks at the treasures of the abbey. Of the clubs of Vienna the Jockey Club is socially the most important. Then comes the Wiener Club. Third on the list is the Commercial Club. AFTER DINNER Ronacher’s is a huge music-hall and supping place where one can eat one’s evening meal and see at the same time a fine variety performance on the stage. For many years it was the finest variety theatre in Europe. It is well worth a visit even from those people who do not habitually go to music-halls. The Apollo is another music-hall where the great stars of the variety firmament often appear. So much has been written lately of the ballet at the Imperial Theatres of Russia, that it might be believed that no good dancing was to be seen outside St. Petersburg and Moscow. The corps de ballet of the Viennese opera dances admirably, they are all girls picked for their looks, the premieres danseuses are great artists, and the ballets are mounted as splendidly as in any other theatre in the world. I have seen “ Excelsior ” danced in most of the capitals of Europe, but nowhere so well or with such fine mounting as in Vienna. Of the theatres for light opera it is difficult to give any indications, for the right theatre to go to is the theatre at which the current success of Oscar Strauss or Leo Fall happens to be running. Though Vienna is an early closing town on the whole, the revellers stay late at “ Max and Moritz,” “ Susses Madel,” u Dummer Kerl,” and at such establishments as the Tabarin, Maxim’s, and the Chaperon Rouge, whose names are an indication of their character.

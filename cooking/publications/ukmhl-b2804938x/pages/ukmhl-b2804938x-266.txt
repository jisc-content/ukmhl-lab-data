There are big trees in this garden, and orange trees with the fruit on them, and two fountains supply the tinkle of falling water, a band plays in the band- stand, and from table to table go the flower-sellers and the newspaper-sellers, and a man who cuts out sil- houettes in black paper, and the post-card sellers. On an autumn or spring evening the Giardino is a pleasant place in which to dine, for the company is a merry one. For colder weather it has a great hall decorated in the Pompeiian manner, and two great wings, mostly of glass, which almost embrace the whole of the garden. Genoa has its own especial Minestrone soup flavoured with Pesto, a paste in which pounded basil, garlic, Sardinia cheese, and olive oil are used ; and the fish dishes are Stocafissso alia Genovese, stock-fish stewed with tomatoes, and sometimes with potatoes as well, and a fry of red mullet, and Moscardini, which are cuttle-fish, oblong in shape and redolent of musk. The tripe of Genoa is as celebrated as that of Caen, and the Vitello Uccelletto, little squares of veal saute with fresh tomatoes in oil and red wine, is a very favourite dish. The Ravioli I have already written of. The Faina somewhat resembles Yorkshire pudding made with pease powder and oil.

Pasqualina is an Easter pie. The figs of Genoa are excellent. The wines are those delle cinque terre, and in some of the cellars you will find them dating back sixty years or more.

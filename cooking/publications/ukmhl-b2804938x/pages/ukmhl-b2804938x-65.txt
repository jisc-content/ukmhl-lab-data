All the world knows Maxim’s as a rather noisy supping place, where Maxim’s, the ladies are not all of the a upper Rue Royale ten ” ; but comparatively few people know that it is a quiet but not unamusing restaurant at lunch and dinner time, and that its cookery is noticeably good. There are a dozen other restaurants away from the boulevards which deserve a word : sylvain’s, Sylvain’s, for instance, in the Rue 12 Rue Halevy Halevy, which at one time was the chosen supping place of the butterfly ladies, but which now is chiefly celebrated for an excellent brand of old cognac (it has lately changed hands, and M. Jarandon, the new pro- prietor, has smartened up the house and advertises a “symphonic orchestra” and a “terasse exotique”); the big Brasserie Universelle in the Avenue de l’Opera, which gives its clients a choice of fifty hors dlceuvre; and the Restaurant de la Rotonde in the Boulevard Hauss- mann—all three have faithful and admiring clienteles. If you are going by a mid-day train from the Gare St. Lazare, you can breakfast in reasonable comfort at the Restaurant Mollard, facing the station, or at the Restaurant de la Pepiniere, a rotisserie which Mr. Roland Strong was the first Englishman to discover, and which has since prospered exceedingly. The food there is very cheap, and the game and poultry are excep- tionally well cooked. The Restaurant Lequen, facing the Gare du Nord, is also a well-managed establish- ment.

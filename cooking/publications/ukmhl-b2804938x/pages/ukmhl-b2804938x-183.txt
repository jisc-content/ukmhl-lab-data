Brussels 161 dishes. The wines are good, and M. Artus has always the best marks of champagne in magnums. There must be something about the cellars of these outdoor places peculiarly favourable to beer, for no pale ale in the world can compare with that drawn at the bars of the Epsom grand-stand, and in Belgium there is no bottled Bass so fresh and palatable as that which one gets at the Laiterie. Other restaurants in Brussels worthy of mention are the Taverne Royale, at the corner of the Galeries Saint Hubert, where some real 1865 cognac can be had at 75 centimes the glass ; the Freres Provengaux, in the Rue Royale; the Restaurant de la Monnaie (a large place, generally noisy, with not the most rapid of service) ; and Stielen’s, in the Rue de l’Eveque. At the Taverne de Londres, in the Rue de l’Ecuyer, there is generally a good cut of cold roast beef with English pickles. A new restaurant, “ Le Chapon Fin,” has been opened in the Rue Gretry. It has boxes like Simpson’s in the Strand. It is always crowded on Bourse days, and is specially patronised by visitors from Antwerp. On Wednesdays all the Brussels restaurants are crowded, that being Bourse day, and in more senses than one, “ market ” day, when over five thousand strangers, mostly men, come into the city from pro- vincial towns. In conclusion, I may mention that I have failed to discover the restaurant where George Osborne gave his “ great dinner ” to the Bareacres a few days before the battle of Waterloo. Thackeray records that as they came away from the feast, Lord Bareacres asked to see the bill, and “ pronounced it a d bad dinner and d dear ! ” Probably the place, therefore, is extinct; for happily the double pronouncement cannot be applied to the dinners I have eaten at any of the restaurants mentioned in this chapter.

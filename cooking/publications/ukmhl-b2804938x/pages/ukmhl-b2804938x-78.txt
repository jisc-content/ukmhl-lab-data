56 The Gourmet's Guide to Europe always less than for a single dinner, and in many of the restaurants one portion is quite sufficient for two people. This used to be the case in all, but now on many of the cartes du jour the mystic letters “ P. P.” follow the prices, which mean that the figures show what is charged per personne. Somehow or another a Frenchman and his wife always dine more cheaply than an Englishman and his wife. It is, I believe, because the maitre d'hotel will generally save the pockets of his compatriots if he can, but has not the same sympathy for the strangers who come to the restaurant. I will take as being typical three other bills I have preserved. One is for a lunch for two people at Maire’s : Hors d'oeuvre, a dish of eggs and tomatoes, a Filet Maire and potatoes, cheese, a couple of pears, a bottle of the Charbonnier of the house, and a bottle of mineral water. The total of this was 18 f. 50 c. At the Restaurant Laperouse I have eaten prawns, always an expensive dish, Bisque, Filets de Sole Lape- rouse, Noisettes de Veau Sautees Champignons, Haricots Ferts nouveauxy and a slice of cheese, and drinking a bottle of Musigny, have been charged, for two, split- ting the portions, 17 f. Breakfasting by myself at the “ Au Pere Boivin,” I have eaten Goujons Frits, a Demi-Noisette de Filet Grille Sauce Estragon, and Cepes Bordelaise, have drunk half a bottle of Vouvray, and have been charged 7 f. To these totals the tips must be added. In the expensive restaurants a franc per louis or a franc per head is the least the head waiter expects, and I am sorry to say that we English and the Americans have so spoilt the market that a franc is scarcely received now with a “Thank you” at the smart restaurants. The sommelier is always on the watch expecting a tip, the portier who takes the hats and coats and the chasseur who calls a fiacre are permanently hopeful.

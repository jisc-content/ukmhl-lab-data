French Provincial Fowns 95 prawns, artichokes, eggs, lobsters, crabs, langoustes are plentiful. Hotel des Bains Here is a typical Breton menu, one de Mer of the meals at the Hotel des Bains de Mer, Ros- coflF:— Artichauts a l’Huile. ^ Pommes de terre a l’Huile. Pore frais froid aux Cornichons. Langouste Mayonnaise. Canards aux Navets. Omelette lines Herbes. Filet aux Pommes. Fromage a la Creme. Fruits, biscuits, &c. Cidre a discretion. This is rather a terrible mass of food ranged in the strangest order, but I insert it to show the traveller in Brittany that he need never think his meal ended when he reaches the omelette, and that he had better take a gargantuan appetite with him. Brest This great naval town has better cafes than it has dining or lunching places ; the Cafe Brestois in the Rue de Siam, and the Grand Cafe in the same street, being both good. Besides the restaurants attached to the hotels, there are the Restaurant Aury and the Brasserie de la Marine, both on the Champ de Bataille, but I have no details concerning them. Quimper At the Hotel de 1’Epee the table d'hote meal is good at 3 francs a head. The hotel is a real old-fashioned French provincial one, and stands on the quay. Fresh sardines and excellent vegetables are specialties of this hotel, Hotel de l’Epee

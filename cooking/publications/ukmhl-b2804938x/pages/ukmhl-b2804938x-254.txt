Italian Cookery There is no cookery in Europe so often maligned without cause as that of Italy.

Farther and farther south, as the climate becomes hotter, the meat becomes less and less the food of the people, various dishes of paste and fish taking its place, and as a compensation the fruit and the wine become more delicious.

German Towns 183 Altmarkt, called the Grosse Briidergasse, is managed by the proprietor whose name it bears. It is much frequented by officers and officials. Here you find good plain fare served in the simplest Kneist’s of fashions. Meals are a la carte 2 Grosse Brii- and quite inexpensive ; cuisine purely der&asse German, homely and wholesome, with excellent beer, especially Erlanger. The atmosphere is usually hot, thick, and stuffy, but the clientele does not seem to mind it. In a little back room the principal dignitaries of the Saxon Court, State, and Army are wont to forgather every morning for their Fruhschoppen,—a kind of early, largely liquid, lunch, at which, if rumour can be trusted, a good deal of important business is informally discussed and settled. The Kaiserpalast and the Victoriahaus are other large establishments. The Bierstall in a little street off the Altmarkt is celebrated for its Pilsen beer ; but the atmosphere of the rooms is stifling. Good Munich beer is obtainable at the Zacherlbrau in the Konig Johannstrasse. The table d’hote meals at the principal hotels are neither remarkably good nor remarkably indifferent. The Bellevue has a large verandah, overlooking the Elbe, which forms a pleasant dining-place in the hot weather. Dresden has a golf course of nine holes. AFTER DINNER The performances of opera at the Opera House, open eleven months in the year, are world-famed. The Schausprehaus, for comedy, is also a State under- taking. The Residenz Theater is for light fare, and there are two music halls in Waisenhausstrasse.

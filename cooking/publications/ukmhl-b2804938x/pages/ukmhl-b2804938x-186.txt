164 The Gourmet's Guide to Europe devoted to strong melodrama and spectacular pieces. The “ Moliere ” is a cheap theatre at the top of the town, near the Porte de Namur. The Scala, opposite the Hotel Metropole, is a music hall often devoted to Revues ; the best Revue of the year, however, is always given at the Galeries. Other music halls are the Folies Bergere, near the Gare du Nord, and the Varieties. The Folies Bergere is a comfortable house with seats well arranged. A favourite portion of the hall is the “ terrasse ” with little tables, the charge for seats there being 1 fr. 50 c. There is also a one-franc promenade. In the middle of the Markets, at the back of the Grand Hotel, is a big building called in summer the “ Palais d’Ete,” and in winter the “ Pole Nord.” Here the summer entertainment is of a music-hall character, and is the best provided in the city. Seats can be booked, and there is also a pro- menade. The Palais d’Ete is the place every one goes to after dinner in the summer months. When converted into the Pole Nord for the winter it is devoted to skating on real ice. Some of the fetes given here are well worth going to see.

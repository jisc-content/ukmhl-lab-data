320 XII AUSTRIA Austrian Cookery—Vienna—Salzburg—Baden—Carlsbad— Marienbad—Other Towns. Austrian Cookery Of the many good things that might be said con- cerning Austrian cookery, the best is, that there is no country in the world, not even excepting France, where the average of good cookery in inns and hotels is so high as in Austria. It is an exception, even in the smallest inns, to be served with an ill-cooked meal, and the red and white or blue and white tablecloths spread on the little tables under the trees in any country hotel garden always seem to be clean. One characteristic of Austrian cookery, and a very good one, is that the cook, in cooking a meal, adds to his dishes all the salt and spices that can be required in carefully considered quantities. The diner never has to half empty a salt-cellar or send a rain of black pepper on to his meat. The Wiener Rostbraten, the steak of the capital, the Wiener Schnitzel, differing from that of Hanover and Hamburg in its garnish of anchovies, olives, and hard-boiled eggs, are two of the best-known of the Austrian dishes. Others are—Ver- micelli with poppy seeds; Smoked beef, sauerkraut and dumplings; Styrian mutton and herbs; Ester- hazy roast beef and minced vegetables ; Pork chops fried in bread crumbs ; Lentil soup with sausages ;

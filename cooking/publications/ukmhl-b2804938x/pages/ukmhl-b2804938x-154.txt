132 The Gourmet's Guide to Europe The golf club, under the management of M. Aletti, is a flourishing institution, and the links are sporting ones. Evian Evian, the most French of all the French watering- places, depends on its hotel restaurants for its good meals. The terrace of Hotel Royal, high above the town and the lake, is a delightful open air dining-place in warm weather. M. Metivier, who came from the Esplanade Hotel, the hotel owned by the Ritz syndicate in Berlin, is the maitre chef and M. Ali, the clever Egyptian, well known as the maitre d'hotel of the Armenonville in Paris, occupies a like position at the Royal in the late summer. The cooking is good, and nowhere can one eat to better advantage the Ombre, the king of all fishes that swim in the Lake of Geneva. The Splendide and the Hermitage, the two other large hotels of Evian, are above the average in their cuisine.

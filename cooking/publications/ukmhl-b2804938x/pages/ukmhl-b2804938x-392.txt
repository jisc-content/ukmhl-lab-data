370 Tdhe Gourmet's Guide to Europe At Marienlyst, which is near Elsinore, there is an hotel semi-oriental in appearance with arched veran- The Casino, dahs and a wealth of creepers. A casino, Marienlyst a restaurant, and two score of cottages form part of the bathing establishment. What I have written concerning the food and the views at Skods- borg and Klampenborg holds good for Marienlyst. In the casino grounds is Hamletâ€™s grave, which is a very good reproduction of the last resting-place of a Viking. A neighbouring pleasure-garden, jealous of this happy idea of Marienlyst, has made in its grounds the identical pool in which Ophelia drowned herself. AFTER DINNER I have described above the Tivoli Gardens, in which all Copenhagen amuses itself in the summer. My knowledge of the winter amusements after dinner is but scanty, but I am told that the performances at the Opera are well worth seeing, and any one who is an amateur of dancing should see the performances of the Opera Corps de Ballet, from whence have come to us such artists as Miles. Genee and Britta.

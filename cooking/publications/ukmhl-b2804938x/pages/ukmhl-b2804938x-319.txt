Spain 297 their indifferent cooking states. Now I am told both hotels are catering very well for their visitors, stimu- lated, no doubt, by the rivalry of the new hotel. Don Jose Nunoz, the proprietor of the Washington Irving and the Siete Suelos, is a great authority on ibex shooting, and is also a notable gourmet, and any one who has the pleasure of carrying an introduction to him will learn of all the sporting possibilities of the country, and also of all the local plats worth tasting. The cookery of the Siete Suelos is considered to be more distinctivelv Spanish than . that or its neighbour. Jerez At Jerez I was first made aware of the fact that the very best Dutch cheese of the day is still imported into Spain. The great Duke of Alba first sent a Queso de Bola as a present to all his friends, and since that time the Spaniards have always eaten the round red cheeses and have always insisted that they shall be the best of their kind. This is rather a curious instance of the conservatism which is so typical of Spain. The Hotel de los Cisnos, the hotel of the town, is good and clean, and for 8 to 10 pesetas a day the food and lodging is all that a traveller in Spain can expect. This is a Sunday menu showing what the Cisnos can do :â€” Consomme de Quenelles a la Royal. Filetes de Tenguados a la Tutus. Chuletas de Cordero a la Inglesa. Pechugas de Polios a la Suprema. Perdices al jugo. Ensalada Rusa. Esparragos de Aranjuez, salsa blanca. Mantecados de Vainilla y Fresa. Postres variados.

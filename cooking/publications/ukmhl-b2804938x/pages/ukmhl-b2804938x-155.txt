133 Ill BELGIAN T.OWNS The Food of the Country—Antwerp—Spa—Ostende—Bruges— Heyste—Blankenberghe—Nieuport. I cannot do better in commencing this chapter than to introduce you to Mr. Horace Lennard, litterateur and “fin gourmet,” who knows his Belgium better than most natives of that country, who has written the notes on “ the food of the country,” on several of the towns, and to whom I am indebted for the entire succeeding chapter on the Brussels restaurants. The Food of the Country The Belgian is a big eater and a bird-eater. As a rule, in Belgium the restaurant that can put forth the longest menu will attract the most customers. There are people in Brussels who regularly travel out to Tirlemont, a little Flemish town nearly twenty miles away, to partake of a famous table d'hote dinner to which the guests sit down at one o’clock, and from which they seldom rise before five. The following is a specimen carte of one of these gargantuan gorges served in December :— Huitres de Burnham. Potage Oxtail. Saumon de Hollande a la Russe. Bouchees a la Reine.

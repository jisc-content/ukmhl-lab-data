German Towns 207 on the slope of the Malberg, and the Rottmannshohe, also on this hill, are two of the breakfast-places. There is a restaurant at the end of the Konig Wilhelm’s Allee. Aachen (Aix-la-Chapelle) Henrion’s Grand Hotel is the favourite dining- place of the Anglo-Saxon colony in Aachen. M. Intra, the proprietor, lays himself out Henrion’s, to attract the English. The German Corneliusbath civil servants and the doctors have a club-table at which they dine, and they exact fines from the members of their club for drinking wine which costs more than a certain price, &c. &c., these fines being collected in a box and saved until they make a sum large enough to pay for a special dinner. Every member of this club is required to leave in his will a money legacy to the club to be expended in wine drunk to his memory. There are two table d'hote meals, at 1.30 and at 7 p.m. At the first the dishes are cooked according to the German cuisine, at the second according to the French. Suppers are served in the restaurant at any hour. Lennertz’s restaurant and oyster-saloon in the Klostergasse is a curious, low-ceilinged, old-fashioned house which, before Henrion’s came Lennertz’s, into favour, had most of the British Klostergasse patronage. Its cooking is excellent, and the German Hausfraus used to be sent to Lennertz’s to study for their noble calling. The carte de jour has not many dishes on it. Everything has to be ordered a la carte, but the prices are all reasonable, and it is possible to make a bargain that a dinner shall be given for a fixed price. The Omelettes Soujjlees are a specialty of the house. The fish used in Lennertz’s comes from Ostende, and the Dutch oysters are excellent.

cParis 2 9 savoury mess of the south, but two days’ notice must be given for the preparation of this delicacy. Across the River The Tour d’Argent on the Quai de la Tourelle, nearly opposite the island on which Notre Dame stands, has been made known to the Tour d’Argent, world by its proprietor, Frederic Quai de la Delair. It is a small old-fashioned Toilirelle house, with a narrow entrance hall and a low-ceilinged parlour. I can remember the days when its floors were spread with sawdust, but it has outgrown that sign of simplicity. Frederic much resembles the pictures of Ibsen. He has a wave of hair, now whitened and rather thinned by the years, curving back over his head, and flowing whiskers. A chat with the master of the restaurant is an amusing part of a lunch or dinner. There is a famous portrait of Frederic painted by one of his friends, an artist ; and I once had the satisfaction of comparing the picture and the original. Frederic’s daughter held the picture, and he, having passed a hand over his hair and having spread out his whiskers, stood close to the canvas, assuming the expression which the artist had repro- duced. Frederic’s conversation is amusing and in- structive. He has some curious theories. He holds that different kinds of fuel should be used for the roasting of different kinds of meat, believing that the spiced scents of some woods transmitted in the cook- ing add to the pleasure of eating all kinds of game. Frederic is not alone in holding this belief, for the old Roman gourmets thought as he does, and spent large sums of money on the woods for their kitchen fires, as do also the Japanese, that very practical and up-to-date nation believing that burning sticks transmit their essences to that which is cooked before

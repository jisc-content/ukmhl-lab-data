French Provincial Fowns 97 have noted where they have been well cared for at inns and hotels. One of them, writing of the journey between Orleans and Blois, says, “ At Mer, the town where one leaves the main road for Taleyur, we happened on an inn (the Hotel du Commerce) which provided us with rather a good instance of the resourcefulness of the French innkeeper, for its out- ward appearance, the sanded floor of the room into which we were shown, and the fact that it was an off day in the town, led us to make up our minds that we should be given quite an indifferent meal, but we were provided in quite a short time with an excellent repast.” For the cuisine at the Hotel d’Angleterre at Blois, several of my correspondents have a good word. At Chambord there is an excellent inn, so I am told, almost in the shadow of the chateau. It stands by itself in the park. One motorist tells me that the dejeuner that he and his companions were given at this wonderful inn was so good that it decided them to stay the day at the inn. I hear also good accounts of the cuisine of the Hotel de PAvenue de Chateau at Chaumont. The Univers at Tours is one of the best known of provincial French hotels, and I have never heard a dissenting opinion as to the excellence of its cookery. Authorities are not so well agreed as to the cookery at Le Faisan, one critic assuring me that it was excellent bourgeois cookery, while another is not at all enthusiastic on the subject. Praise is given to the dejeuner at the Hotel Lion d’Or at Langeais, and at Chenonceaux the Hotel de Chateau receives nothing but praise. At Saumur the Hotel Budon has an excellent cook and a cellar of wine which deserves special attention. At Nantes the Hotel de France is both in cuisine and other matters quite first-class. There do not seem to be any very special dishes belonging to the Loire

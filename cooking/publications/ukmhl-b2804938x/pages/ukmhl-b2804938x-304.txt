282 The Gourmet's Guide to Europe (fillets of sole fried in batter) are excellent, and some of his egg dishes, notably his CEufs Poches au Gratin, are revelations to the Englishman, who believes that eggs can only be boiled, or poached in water, or fried. The restaurant of the Casino, I am told, is some- times a pleasant place with good cookery. This Casino depends upon what play is in progress in the gaming - rooms. When the Court is at San Sebastian the gaming is of a mild descrip- tion. When there is no chance of offending the puritanism of Court circles, the “ maximums ” are raised to Monte Carlo limits, and the gamblers, who give no thought to the total of their bills, come to play at the most amusing town of the north of Spain. I, most unfortunately, ate a dinner at the Casino during one of the “off” periods, and I have never had sufficient pluck to experiment there again. On the occasion of my experiment I had been warned that I should not be well served, but I thought that the view of the town and the garden, with its picturesque crowd, would make amends for any dilatoriness. This was the menu of the dinner that I partook of, and, though wine was included in the repast, to conciliate the haughty Spaniard in dress-clothes who came and looked at me as though I were an “ earth-man,” I ordered a pint of Diamante :— Hors-d’oeuvre.

215 ¥11 BERLIN The Classic Restaurants—The Hotel Restaurants—Restaurants of the People—Military Restaurants—Cafes, Cabarets, and Bars —Open-air Restaurants—Clubs. Berlin is plentifully supplied with restaurants, for both the Kaiser and the Berlin Municipality give every encouragement to enterprising hotel-keepers and restaurateurs who build up-to-date restaurants. Every good German is anxious that Berlin should rival Paris as a city of pleasure and amusement, and the old staid Prussian capital has now become one of the most go-ahead cities in the world. Its small theatres and music-halls and cabarets are very lively, all its new restaurants are tremendously gorgeous, and Berlin now keeps hours which even Paris would con- sider late. The feeding in Berlin is in rather a mixed state, and all the restaurants which cater both for the Berliners and for the strangers who are within the city gates are compelled to serve meals all day and nearly all night long. Their German clients, after the coffee and rolls they have eaten very early in the morning, are ready for a “ snack ” of some kind or another and a glass of wine or a tumbler of beer at about ii a.m. This enables them to postpone their mid-day meal till 2 o’clock, and lunch often fades like a dissolving view into afternoon tea, for Berlin has adopted with enthusiasm the English 5 o’clock meal.

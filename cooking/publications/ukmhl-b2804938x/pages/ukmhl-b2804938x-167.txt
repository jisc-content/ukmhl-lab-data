Belgian Towns 145 serve for three people, a suggestion is always made by the maitre cThotel that two will suffice. All of which I am glad to record. Most of the items on the bill of fare seemed to range between 2 and 3 francs, and if I had not been tempted by an 8-franc partridge my bill for a solitary dinner would have been under 20 francs. As an indication of the prices of the Helder, this was my dinner : A slice of Cantaloup melon, a slice of brill with white wine sauce, a partridge and salad Coeurs de Romaine, a bit of Camembert cheese, and a pear. A small bottle of Sauterne and a small bottle of Vichy water, a cup of coffee, and a glass of the “ fine ” of the house, Courvoisier at a franc a glass, and very good at the price. My bill came to 24 francs 75 centimes, the melon and the partridge being the expensive items in it. The Cafe de Paris of Brussels has opened a branch in Ostende. The man who wishes to keep his dinner bill below 10 francs or even below 5 need not fare ill at Ostende. In the Grand Place “ Au Gourmet,’’ is the charcutier’s shop of M. Jean Grand Place Bogaerts, who is a “Fournisseur du Roi,” but who modestly describes himself as Traiteur. In his shop window during the shooting season is always some choice game, and relays of fresh trout are sent him daily. On the first floor above the shop is a little restaurant which bears the title “ Au Gourmet.” It is a very unpretending little place, the knives are black-handled and the napery is coarse, but it is perfectly clean. On the mirrors are wafered the names of the plats du jour, the cost of which seem generally to be 1 franc 50 centimes ; a modest bill of fare conveys fuller information ; a little girl sits at the caisse; and an elderly waiter with a blue black moustache and embroidered shirt and gloomy views concerning life takes one’s orders.

Varis 5 The Maison Doree and the Grand Vefour have been the most recent additions to the list of casualties. At the Maison Doree I was one of those friends of the house who were allowed to choose any two dishes from the luncheon carte for a quite ridiculously small sum of money, and the old waiter who wore the decoration for long service treated me with as much respect and as great deference as though I had thousands of francs to spend.

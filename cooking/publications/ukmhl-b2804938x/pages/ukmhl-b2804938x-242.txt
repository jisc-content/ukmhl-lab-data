The marble there is veined purple, and green trellis, and white marble statues, and gilt vases are in too violent contrast with each other. The banqueting hall, from one wall of which a portrait of the Kaiser looks down on the guests, is a fine room with a little stage at one end. As wedding feasts often last as long as five hours, little comedies played on this stage form a welcome relief on those occasions to too much eating and too many speeches. Any habitue of the Ritz or Carlton finds himself at home at once at the Esplanade, for some of the maitres d'hotel at this restaurant have been at the other hotels of the same company, and recognise familiar faces very quickly. It pleased me to find that my liking for a table at the side in a quiet part of the room, and partiality for a short, light dinner, as well as my name, seemed to be familiar to everybody in the Esplanade restaurant as soon as I set foot inside it. Most of the meals at the Esplanade are a la carte, and the carte du jour is in German on one side and French on the other. The German clientele of the restaurant insist on a table d'hote dinner, which is priced at 6 marks, and of which this is a fair specimen. I give it in German, but it is on the menu in both that language and French :â€” Portugische Kraftbriihe mit Reis. Esperancesuppe. Forelle Meuniere. Rehmignonette Forestiere. Selleriepuree.

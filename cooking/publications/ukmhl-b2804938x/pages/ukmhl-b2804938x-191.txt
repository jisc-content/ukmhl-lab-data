And this is a typical menu which reads as though it were for a French banquet :— Huitres de Zelande. Caviar. Consomme Diplomate. Truite Saumonee a la Nantua. Poularde a Plmperiale. Noisettes de Chevreuil a la St. Hubert. Delice de foie gras au Champagne. Becassines roties. Salade St. Clair. Tartelettes aux Haricots Verts. Mousse Antoinette. Sandwiches au Parmesan. Dessert. Of the hotels which contain restaurants, the Hotel des Indes and Hotel Vieux Doelen have a reputation for good cookery. The former was Hotel des indes, in olden times the town house of the Lange Voorhoot Barons van Brienen. In winter many people of Dutch society, coming to the capital from the country for the season, take apartments there, and during that period of the year the restaurant is often filled by very brilliant gatherings. The manager and proprietor is Mr. Haller. It was the hotel at which I stayed, and I generally dined there, finding the dinner of the day well cooked, and quite elaborate enough to satisfy a man whose tastes are simple but rather exacting.

Carre de Mouton Nesselrode.

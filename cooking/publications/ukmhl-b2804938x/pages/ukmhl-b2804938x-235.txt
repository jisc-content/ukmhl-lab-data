German Towns 213 The Rathskeller of Hamburg is in the modern Rathhaus, and is finely decorated in “ Altdeutsch ” : style, with frescoes and paintings by well-known artists. The Kaiser Keller is below Kempinski’s, on a level with the water. The oyster cellars of Hamburg are noted for their excellent lunches. Bouillon, cutlets, steaks, caviare, lachs, and other viands are served, and English “ porter,” generally Combe’s Stout, is much drunk. Another British production, “ Chester ” cheese, which is red Cheshire, is much in demand. At supper in these cellars, and also in Berlin, caviare is much in demand, the small Baltic variety, not the Russian, which is lighter in colour and larger in grain. A pot of it, large or small, according to the number of supperers, is put on the table in a bowl of crushed ice, and your Hamburger, who is a good judge of victuals ; as he is of drink, makes his supper of it. There is a British Club in Hamburg at 42 Grosse Bleichen, but of it I only know the particulars set down in Mr. Austen Teigh’s Clubs, that it is for British subjects, and that the yearly subscription is £h I os. AFTER DINNER My experience of the performances at the higher- class theatres of Hamburg is nil, for my visits to the port have always been paid in summer, when the Stadt Theater, the big house for opera and comedy, the Schauspiel, and the Thalia, have been closed ; but I have heard Austrian operettas well sung at the Carl Schultze, and have passed quite amusing evenings, spending a half-hour here and a half-hour there in the various music halls and shows in the amusement quarter of St. Pauli. Hagenbach’s Menagerie is open all the year round, and so are most of the large variety houses.

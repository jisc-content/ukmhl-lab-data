90 T'he Gourmet's Guide to Europe St. Malo Hotel de France et de Chateau- briand, Place Chateaubriand street. Brittany, the land of eggs and butter, is also a land of gigantic meals at very cheap prices, roughly served, wholesome no doubt, but better appreciated with an appetite sharpened by Brittany air than they would be under less healthy conditions. In St. Malo there is one restaurant, that attached to the Hotel de France et de Chateaubriand in the Place Chateaubriand, which has preten- sions to distinction and elegance. The entrance to the restaurant is in a side The rooms have crimson portieres to their windows ; there are palms, and the little tables are not set too near each other. The linen and cutlery are better than are usually to be found in Brittany. A lunch and a dinner of the day are the meals usually served in this restaurant, the prices, if I remember rightly, being 3 and 5 francs respectively. It is as well to take the meal which is ready, for I have found by personal experience that the kitchen has no great variety to offer for a lunch or dinner a la carte. In the Place Chateaubriand, the little square which is the centre of the life of the town, in which are four or five cafes, two of which at least have ladies’ Hotel del’Uni- bands as an attraction, is the Hotel de vers, Place l’Univers, the dining-room of which is Chateaubriand patronised by the “ commis voyageurs ” who come to St. Malo on business, and who go to no hotel that has not good sound bourgeois cookery. The room, or rather rooms, are rather low, and a long table d'hote table runs down the centre of each; but there are small tables at the side for the use of people who do not wish to herd with all-comers. The price of the meals is a small one, and the cookery is prob- ably the best in the town.

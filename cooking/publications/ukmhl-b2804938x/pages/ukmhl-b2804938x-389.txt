367 XIX DENMARK The Hours of Meals—Copenhagen Restaurants—The Badehotels on the Sound. Of the food of the country there is little to say. The restaurants of the hotels aspire to French cookery ; the simpler eating-places where the Danes enjoy them- selves have the plainer cookery of Scandinavia—scraps of beef in the form of Tournedos, cutlets, baked fowl, and the smorgasbord—the hors d!oeuvre of the north, which, however, are to be found in greater variety in Sweden. The hours of the meals throughout Scandinavia should be noted by the Englishman, who because he likes to lunch at 1.30 and dine at 8.15 thinks that the whole world must do likewise. The Dane or Swede or Norwegian rises very early, has his coffee and roll, and then works till 11, when he leaves his office or his place of employment and eats his breakfast. At noon he goes back to work and at 4 p.m. he eats his dinner. He generally sups lightly before he goes to bed. The Briton who goes into a restaurant at what he considers the sane hours at which to feed and finds no table d'hote meal ready and the cook out for his daily walk, learns that every country does not of necessity follow the British time- table.

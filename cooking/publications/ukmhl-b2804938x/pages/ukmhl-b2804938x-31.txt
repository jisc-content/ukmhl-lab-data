*•Paris 9 like, for instance, the heart-shaped little paper slip put on the neck of the bottle of any decanted wine, with the cru and the year noted on it. I feel personal satisfaction when M. Burdel, very distinguished in appearance, with iron-grey hair en brosse, and with the broad black ribbon of his eye-glasses stretching across his shirt-front, walks through the rooms, bowing to a client here, making a suggestion there. When he halts at my table and inquires whether I have had a good passage across the Channel, I almost purr with satis- faction. I like the presence of my neighbours at other little tables ; they all look as though they played some important part in the great world, and most of them do. The plats du jour at the Anglais are invariably admirably prepared, and it is the one restaurant at which I have eaten a Gigot de sept heures cooked as it should be. The Pot age Ceremani, made from the livers of fat fowls, is no longer on the daily bill of fare at the Anglais, a fact which I do not regret, for this particular delicacy used to cost £i a plate when served at a banquet, and I never pay as much as that for my entire dinner. Duglere was the chef of the Anglais, M. Burdel was one of his pupils, and a Barbue Duglere is one of the special dishes of the house. Potage Germiny used to be claimed as a dish of the house both by the Anglais and the Maison Doree— indeed, one of the MM. Verdier once told me a detailed story of Casimir announcing to the Marquis de St. Georges that he had invented the soup and dedicated it to him, and of the tears of joy the Mar- quis wept—but the Anglais can now alone assert its right to it as a creation. Filet de Sole Mornay, and Poularde AIbufera, which is really poor little Portugal’s one great addition to the book of cookery,^are two of the dishes which the Anglais cooks better than any other restaurant in the world, and Pommes Anna may perhaps be added to this tiny list.

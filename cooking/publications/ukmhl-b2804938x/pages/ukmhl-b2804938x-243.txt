Berlin 221 The Esplanade has a pleasant little grill-room, and no doubt somewhere in its great corridors there is an American bar. The restaurant of the Adlon Hotel, the windows of which look out on to the Pariserplatz, is mightily gorgeous with marble and gilding. The Hotel Adlon hotel is owned by the well-known wine Unter den merchants, from whom it takes its Linden name. The great hall of the hotel looks like the museum of a millionaire, so many beautiful things have been collected there. There are some beautiful works of art from Japan, a wonderful clock, a wonder- ful staircase, cream marble pillars with bronze capitals, magnificent carpets, Venetian mosaics, fine furniture, a large bust of the Kaiser in coloured marbles, a magnificent fountain, but if there were fewer beauti- ful things and less magnificence it would be in better taste. The view of the little garden seen through the back entrance is, however, charming. It is the latest expression of the Teutonic desire to possess the most gorgeous hotels on the Continent, and it is just a little overdone. French grey is the colour of the liveries of the outdoor servants. The waiters in the restaurant press on Americans and Britons the carte du jour, but there are very good and cheap table d'hote meals. Dejeuners, 3 marks ; dinners, 6 marks ; and suppers, 5 marks. The restaurant is all old gold and pink and white and green marble. The Kaiser took much interest in the building of this hotel, and in 1907 paid M. Bodart, the chef, the compliment of visiting his kitchen. The Adlon has a grill-room in the Raffael-Saal, and its orchestra plays during and after dinner. The Bristol Hotel is an excellent place at which to take a mid-day meal. The lunch costs Bristol, Unter 2.50 marks. Hors d\oeuvre are 1 mark den Linden extra, and there is an extra charge for sweets, A

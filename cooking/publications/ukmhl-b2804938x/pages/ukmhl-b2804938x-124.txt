102 ‘The Gourmet's Guide to Europe The Reserve is a house of three storeys of balconies sheltered from the wind by glass screens. In winter The Reserve one ^unches in one of these balconies, the Corniche in summer on the terrace. In the sea, Road at the foot of the bluff on which the restaurant is built, are the tanks, through which the salt water flows, in which the fish and oysters are kept.

They look like marine walnuts. When they are split open the gelatinous morsel inside is well worth the trouble of the preparatory proceed-

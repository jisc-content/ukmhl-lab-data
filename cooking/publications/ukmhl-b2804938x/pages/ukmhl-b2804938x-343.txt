^Austria 321 Vienna pancakes; Smoked pork ribs; Carp stewed with onions and pepper. Some of the Austrian en- tremets, simple but delicious, should find their way to England. The soufflee omelette is beautifully light, and the Stephanie omelette, which is a soufflee omelette enveloping a spread of greengage jam, is a very favourite ending to a repast. Salzburg Knockerl is another light dish, and the cakes of sago and other light food stuffs, eaten with fruit-juice, are good, plain, sweet- tasting food. Apfelstrudl,, an admirable apple turn- over, Kaiser schmarren, which is shreds of pancake and raisins, are two other popular Austrian sweet dishes. The Austrian bread and Austrian pastry are the best in Europe, and the Austrian coffee is just as well made as any coffee served in France. An Austrian house- wife once explained to me the secret of this. “ You English,” she said, “ always talk of your chalky hard water, and excuse your poor coffee on that score. In Austria every housewife looks carefully at her coffee- berries before she roasts them, and also after they are roasted, for she knows that a greasy berry or a burned one will spoil a whole making of coffee.” An Austrian housewife will never allow metal to touch coffee, but I fancy that this is more a matter of super- stition than of practical coffee-making. An Austrian housewife does even more wonderful things with a goose than a German one does. She cuts up her bird, spices its liver in a little casserole, boils its back and serves it with rice, spices its breast and bakes it, and makes a brown stew of its giblets and feet. Each province has a cookery all its own. Bohemia, for instance, prides itself on its apple tarts and on its muffins stuffed with poppy-seed jam, its dumplings of cream cheese, ham, egg, cream, and apricot jam, and its wonderful crumpets. This, the lunch eaten by King Edward when he visited the Austrian Exhibition in London, and

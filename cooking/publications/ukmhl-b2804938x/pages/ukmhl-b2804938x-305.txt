Ron. Filet de Eceuf Pique Broche. Salade. Entremets. Arlequin. Dessert I do not think that I ever had a worse-served 7 francs worth of food. Once in my life, at a Chicago hotel, I saw a negro waiter shaking up the bottle of bur- gundy I had ordered, just to amuse his brother “ coons,” and I felt a helpless exasperation as I watched him. The same feeling of voiceless anger was upon me as I watched the gentleman who was supposed at the San Sebastian Casino to keep me supplied with hot food, bring a dish from the interior of the cafe and then put it down on somebody else’s table to cool while he strolled across the terrace to ask the military guardian at the gate how many people had paid for admission, or at what hour the band played, or what number had won the lottery. The Urbana in the Plaza Guipuzcoa is a Spanish restaurant which prides itself on its French cuisine. Of the cafes the bright Novelty in the Alameda is the most amusing. The view from the terrace of the Monte Ulia is so fine that the cookery of the establishment, which is always sufficiently good, becomes a secondary on a clear spring morning. The San Sebastian Clubs The Real Club Nautico is built in the shape of a ship and commands a splendid view of the bay. In the hot weather it is very pleasant to dine on the deck of this ship ashore and listen to the music of the Casino band, the Casino being just behind the club-house.

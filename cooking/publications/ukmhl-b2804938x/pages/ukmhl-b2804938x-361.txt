zAu stria '339 two rival hotels, the Saxe and the Blue Star, are the two best to dine at, but my gastronomic experi- ences in three days at Prague were not encouraging. At Riva on the Lago di Garda there are two big hotels, the cookery at either of which being clean and Austrian comes as a change after the richness of the Italian school. Abazzia, the Nice of the Austrian Riviera, has not yet achieved the full cele- brity which is sure to come to it. The restaurant of the Stephanie has an excellent cook, but is by no means cheap.

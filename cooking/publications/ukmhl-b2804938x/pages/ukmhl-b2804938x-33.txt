^Petris 11 little restaurant, but it was not until the present pro- prietor, M. Braquesac, took possession, after the days of the Commune, that the restaurant rose to its greatest glory. When I first saw Voisin’s, it looked as unlike the house of to-day as can be imagined. I was in Paris immediately after the days of the Com- mune, and followed, with an old General, the line the troops had taken in the fight for the city. In the Rue St. Honore were some of the fiercest com- bats, for the regulars fought their way from house to house down this street to turn the positions the Communists took up in the Champs Elysees and the gardens of the Tuileries. The British Embassy had become a hospital, and all the houses which had not been burned looked as though they had stood a bombardment. There were bullet splashes on all the walls, and I remember that Voisin’s looked even more battered and hopeless than did most of its neighbours. The cellars of Voisin’s were flooded during the great rise of the Seine in the early months of 1910, and the bins of the wonderful vintages of Bordeaux and Burgundies were threatened with a bath of icy water ; but the precious bottles were carried as carefully as if they were children to a place of safety above flood level, and were restored to their snug saw- dust beds again when the danger had passed. The diplomats have always had an affection for Voisin’s, perhaps because of its nearness to the street of the Embassies ; and in the “ eighties ” the attaches of the British Embassy used to breakfast there every day. Nowadays, the clientele seems to me to be a mix- ture of the best type of the English and Americans passing through Paris, and the more elderly amongst the statesmen, who were no doubt the dashing young attaches of thirty years ago. M. Braquesac, grey-haired, and with an aquiline nose, is always, when he is in the restaurant, the most distinguished-looking man there.

Italy 243 Cairo is the cleanest and brightest. Two large rooms and a small room run back from the street. There is an abundance of electric light, and Cairo, Via Venti the marble floor of black and white Settembre chequers gives a sense of coolness. The outside deco- ration of the house also is quite bright, and in good keeping. It has the meals of the day, and a lunch I ate there, a la carte, in which a fry of red mullet and a saute of fowl were the principal dishes, was both well cooked and cheap. The Bavaria, at the corner of the Via Venti Set- tembre and the Piazza, is a birreria first Bavaria and a restaurant in the second place. Via Venti Its great recommendation is the loftiness Setteml3re of its big room, the ceiling of which is supported by big pillars of brown marble. The restaurant in the Teatro Carlo Felice did not look tempting enough to induce me to experiment on its food. The two restaurants in the Via Carlo Felice are the oldest established in the town. The Labo, 7 Via Labo consists of low-ceilinged little Carlo Felice rooms on the ground floor, the front room having in its ceiling a small round saucer-like indent to give the idea of a cupola. Its floor is of black and white marble. Its chairs are of Austrian bent wood. It serves set mealsâ€”lunches, 1. 2 and 1. 2.50, and dinners, 1. 3 and 1. 3.50. The Gottardo, on the opposite side of the road to the Labo, has the usual series of little rooms on the first floor. At either of these two res- Gottardo, 6 Via taurants one can experiment on the real Carlo Felice oily cookery of Genoa in a real Genoese atmosphere. At the Gambrinus, Via San Sebastiano, cold meats of all kinds are kept ready for those who Gambrinus, Via choose to sup there, as well as drink San Sebastiano their Munich beer.

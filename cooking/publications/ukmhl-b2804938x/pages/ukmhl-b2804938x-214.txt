Stuttgart There is no town in Germany, Frankfurt excepted, through which more British travellers pass on their way to other places than Stuttgart. The acquaint- ance of most travellers with the restaurants of the town begins and ends as a rule with the supper room Hotel and the breakfast room in the Hotel Marquardt Marquardt. They might go further and fare worse. At mid-day, at which time all the people from the suburbs are in Stuttgart, the pleasant room at Marquardtâ€™s, looking out on to the Palace Square, is given over to those who lunch at separate tables, and who eat the very satisfying lunch of the day. At the room in the centre of the hotel, people who wish to lunch more cheaply sit cheek by jowl at six long tables, while in the centre of this room are small tables at which the overflow from the brighter room is accommodated. The room with a view is so much pleasanter than the interior hall that it is worth while securing a table beforehand. Meals a la carte can be had at mid-day, but they interfere with the business of the set lunch. For supper no choice of rooms is given, for that meal is served in the large interior hall at small tables, while the other room is being got ready for early breakfasters. It is pleasant, if one has to catch an early train, to go into a room where everything is clean, and fresh, and ready, and not to be in the midst of sweeping out and the laying of tables by sleepy waiters who look as if they had been up all night ; but there are more cheerful supper rooms in Stuttgart than that in the hotel. Stuttgart is a town of very large and very cheap restaurants.

190 The Gourmet's Guide to Europe Of the modern restaurants, the Cafe Kusch, in the Karolinenstrasse, is the most airy and the brightest. Cafe Kusch ^ ^as white enamelled walls, with Karolinen- panelling of light oak to a man’s height, strasse jt ijas> the restaurant, a large balcony where men sit and drink their wine. It has a good wide staircase, the rails to which are in white metal shaped like branches of trees, and such ornamentation as there is on the white walls is in quite good taste. It seems to be always full of customers, and its break- fasts of the day at 1 mark 75 or 2.50 are well-cooked, very satisfying meals. This is a 2.50 breakfast taken at random from a number of menus :— Gemusewurfel Suppe. Salm kalt. See. Mayonaise. Nurnberger Bratwurstchen. Rinderbraten. Salat. Compot. Zwetschgenkuchen. The supper or dinner is usually ordered a la carte. The dishes of the day mostly vary in price from I mark to 1.50, but there is a set evening meal at 3 marks. The waiters are in dress clothes, and the little boys who serve the wine look clean and fresh in white jackets and white aprons. The Cafe Kusch has a branch establishment in the Forest outside the city, where a band plays, and which is much resorted to in the summer. In the upper part of the town the great Rathhaus has in its cellars the usual wine restaurant. The Rathhaus rooms are partially lighted by stained Keller glass windows on a level with the street, the ceiling is painted, and the walls panelled. Herr Karl Giessing, the lessee, has brought these cellars into celebrity owing to the excellence of their wines.

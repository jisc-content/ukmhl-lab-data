Portugal 309 their home and of having placed the virtue of cleanli- ness even before the hospitality of my hosts. From the little garden of the club, which is upon the roof of another house, one looks from a surrounding of flowers down on to the brown roofs of the town, and one sees the Douro winding all silver between its hills out to the sea. The cook of the British Club is an artist, and I was introduced there to a dish of fresh lampreys, that rich and tempting fish, a surfeit of which once killed a British king. Bussaco Of the feeding at the Hotel of Bussaco I cannot speak from experience, but I was very generally told in Portugal that M. Weissman, the â€ž & , 1^,11 Bussaco Hotel proprietor, has a good cook. I he hotel itself is a curiosity in architecture. A portion of it was originally a convent, and the new building was intended at one time to be a royal residence, and at another period was to have been the centre of a Portu- guese Monte Carlo. Pampilhosa The buffet at Pampilhosa, the important junction station on the Lisbon-Oporto line, is Buffet, much above the average of railway Pampilhosa dining-places in Portugal. I believe that its manager is a partner of M. Weissman mentioned above.

^Paris 61 for their particular types of opera, and the Frangaise and the Odeon are subventioned to keep classical comedy alive. The Gymnase and the Vaudeville generally house modern comedy, and at the Palais Royal, the Varietes, and the Nouveautes there is an abundance of Gallic salt in the pieces performed. One little tip I may give even to Anglo-Saxons who know their Paris, and that is to buy at any kiosk, on the day of arrival, the little paper Comoedia, which not only gives the “ casts ” of all plays, but also a sketch of the plots. It also gives the programmes of all the music halls, big and small, tells one who are the stars singing at them, and what Revues are run- ning, and gives all the Cabaret Artistiques, and the places at which the bands play in the afternoons. It is a great help in deciding what plays may suit one’s mood after dinner, or what other amusement one prefers.

I fancy, however, that the opera-house was closed for the summer months, but of this I have not any clear recollection. Saltsjobaden At the Swedish Brighton, a very simple and very pretty village amidst the pines on a fjord where small yachts lie at anchor on the placid water, and a score of little islands have tea-houses amidst the trees, and little piers jut out into the wavelets, and bathing sheds are on the brink of the water, there are a half-dozen of hotels and restaurants at all of which the prices are surprisingly cheap. At the Grand Hotel I was given a copious smorgasbord, fried fish, stewed fruit, unlimited bread, butter, and cheese ; a pint of Swedish beer or any other simple beverage was at my service, and the charge was i k^. 50 ore, or about is. 8d.

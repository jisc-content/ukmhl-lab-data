306 The Gourmets Guide to Europe club gives dances and holds a reception on the night of King George’s birthday. The club is most hospitable to visitors. A travelling visitor can be introduced by a member and made free of the club for a fortnight. Should such a member wish t to make use of the club for a longer period, the committee may elect him as a visiting member on payment of a small monthly subscription. The Gremio Litterario and the Jockey Club are the Portuguese clubs of the city. ClNTRA There is little scope for gourmandise of any kind at Cintra, the life there being of the simplest. No one ever thinks of asking a friend out to dinner, for the food at all the hotels is very plain, and the amusement of the little town in the evening consists in bridge and poker parties formed after dinner. Estoril At Estoril, which is the Brighton of Portugal, a bright little place just outside the mouth of the river, Grand Hotel, there are three good hotels—the Grand, Estoril owned and managed by Mons. Estrade, where the cuisine is French and is to be recommended ; the Italie, owned by an Italian, which is never without English guests ; and the more Portuguese Royal. A Hotel d’ltalie, casino is attached to the first-mentioned Estoril hotel, and the little wheel is generally spinning there. In Portugal, however, no one knows a month in advance whether gambling will be permitted or will not be permitted in the various casinos. Ministries in Portugal have fits of the Nonconformist conscience, like Ministries in Great Britain, but sometimes officials are kindly blind to what is going on under their noses even though it be against the strict letter of the law.

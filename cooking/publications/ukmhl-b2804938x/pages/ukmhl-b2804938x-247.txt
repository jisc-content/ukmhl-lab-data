iBerlin 225 has a vaulted roof. The first floor and the staircase leading to it are even more gorgeous than the ground floor. When Kempinski’s was first built, it so de- lighted the Berliners that a song was made in its honour and sung in the music halls. Kempinski’s is celebrated for its oysters, and for its excellent Holstein crayfish, and for its lobsters. The cook at this restau- rant has an excellent manner of cooking lobsters, Homard Chaud au Beurre Truffe, It consists of chopped truffles, worked up into best fresh butter, rolled out, and then laid on the hot lobster. My own experience of ordering a dinner at Kempinski’s was not very happy. I took the longest dish I could find on the menu which had “ Krebs ” in it. What was brought me was a little metal dish with five depres- sions in it. In one of these was a little Truit eau bleuy in two others were the meat of crayfish, and in the remaining two were spinach with a baked sardine on the top of each heap of vegetable. It was a curious combination, and it decided me for the future to eat my trout without accessories of any kind. I ate, how- ever, an admirable crayfish salad, with eggs and points d'asperges and lettuce, which was decidedly better than the trout and baked sardine combination. Kem- pinski & Co. are wine merchants, and a vast amount of Kempinski’s Grenz-Sect is drunk in the restaurant. As a rule, a portion of any dish on the bill of fare at Kempinski’s costs 1 mark 25. As a proof that an excellent dinner is obtainable at Kempinski’s for a small price, I subjoin a menu which was composed by a friend, who knew the ropes of the place, for a little feast to whichTe’invited me.

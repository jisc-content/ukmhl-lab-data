Berlin 227 never full. There is no noise and no hurry, for there is no early closing in Berlin, but from 6 p.m. till the early hours of the morning the waiters are kept busy. It is a wonderful place, and, apart from its being a dining and supping centre, is quite one of the sights of Berlin. Another wonder of rooms decorated in various styles is the Kaiser Keller in Friedrichstrasse, where one wanders from room to room, each Kaiser Keller, 178 decorated after some well-known hall Friedrichstrasse in some German town. There is the Apostle Keller, with its carved figures of saints and elaborate dark woodwork, and there is a room where the ceiling is supported by a single column, and where the de- corations are of mediaeval saints painted on a gold background, and there is also a little garden where a fountain plays, and where palms give shelter to the tables. Another of the rooms is after the model of the Lubeck Schiffero;esellschaft. Lovers of good wines should not miss the Restau- rant Lutter, at the corner of Charlotten and Franzo- sischestrasse. This is an historic old Lutter tavern, which has been frequented by Franzosische- literary men and actors, as well as strasse government officials, for the last hundred#years. The walls are adorned with many interesting souvenirs of famous guests. Underneath the restaurant on the ground floor is a quaint old wine cellar. An inexpensive restaurant where the Zmn Riides simple German cookery is quite good, heimer, 178 and where there is a fixed-price dinner Friedrichstrasse for marks, is the Riidesheimer. Its owes its cele- brity to its excellent cellar of Rhine wines. The Trocadero, a magnificent new restaurant in Unter den Linden, is at present closed owing to the failure of its proprietor.

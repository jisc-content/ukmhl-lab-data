French Provincial Towns IOI Biarritz Clubs Each of the Casinos has its Club Prive for bac- carat. A visiting card with a good London address is generally all that is required to obtain a ticket of admission. The County Club, a villa some little distance out- side Biarritz, has, I am sorry to say, ceased to be in existence for the last few years. There is talk of re- establishing it, for its loss is much felt in Biarritz. It was a centre of sport. In its grounds were the large field in which the Concours Hippique is held, and a pigeon-shooting ground. It was a very cosmopolitan and very cheerful club. The Golf Club is at Anglet, up on the cliffs about a mile distant from Biarritz. The British Club has a comfortable house in the Avenue du Palais. It accepts properly introduced visitors as temporary members at 48 francs for a month, and half that sum for a fortnight. Marseilles All the travelling English eat Bouillabaisse at Mar- seilles at least once in their lives. If you wish to eat the dish of the Phocian town in comfort, take one of the tram-cars which run to L’Oriole, or a voiture, and go along the Corniche Road to the Reserve, which those of us who are grey-headed still call Roubion’s. Mons. Echenard, who owns the Reserve, has added to the restaurant a very comfortable hotel, which is christened The Palace. From the shaded terrace there is a lovely view over the bay of Bonne Veine.

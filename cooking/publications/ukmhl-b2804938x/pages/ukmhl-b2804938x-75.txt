cParis 5 3 At Fontainebleau the Savoy Hotel is a new modern hotel, and its cuisine is quite first-class. It is some dis- tance both from the town and chateau, savoy Hotel, This hotel makes very substantial de- Fontainebleau ductions, both for rooms and meals, to golfers who come to play on the Fontainebleau links. The cuisine of the Hotel de France et de l’Angle- terre, an old house, with furniture and engravings which are quite in keeping with the Hotel de France palace across the way, is decidedly good. et de l’Angle- The meals are a la carte, and the prices j^e, Fontame- are high. The attendance is good, and people who go to Fontainebleau to visit the chateau will find it a capital though expensive place at which to breakfast. Of the accommodation and cookery in the surround- ing villages, an artist, who knows the forest well, writes thus to me : “ At Barbizon the Hotel des Charmettes, and at Marlotte the Hotel Mallet, are fairly comfort- able and picturesque inns, though apt to be over- crowded in the summer. In fine weather meals are served under an awning in the garden, and the prices are quite moderate. They do not pretend to be any- thing but inns, and the company is usually somewhat mixed. At Samois-sur-Seine the Hotel Beau Rivage is a small but comfortable hotel, with a terrace on which meals are served. The terrace has a delightful view of the river.” The Golf Club of Fontainebleau has a good club- house, where an excellent 3-franc lunch is served. It is possible to dine there on giving The Golf Club, notice. The subscription is 125 francs Fontainebleau a year for men, 100 francs for ladies, and 200 francs for double tickets.

14 T^he Gourmets Guide to Europe acquired, and lastly another little shop was taken in, the entrance changed from the front to its present position at the side, the accountant’s desk put out of sight, and the little musicians’ gallery built. M. Paillard has pleased the ladies amongst his customers by giving them music with their dinner. He also gives them music, too much music, with their supper. Paillard’s has now a supper clientele of the most unblemished respectability. The great classic restaurants resemble Napoleon’s Old Guard in that they die but do not surrender.

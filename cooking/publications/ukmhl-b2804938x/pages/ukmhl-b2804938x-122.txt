ioo The Gourmet's Guide to Europe dinner is served ; but the restaurant of Biarritz is the one which Ritz established on the first floor of the Little Casino, the Casino Municipal, and which continued, after the Ritz com- pany had ceased to be connected with it, as the ex-Ritz, the “ ex ” being printed very small indeed. One break- fasts there in a glazed-in verandah overlooking the Plage and the favourite bathing-spot, and at dinner one looks across to the illuminated terrace of the other Casino. Biarritz depends but little on the surrounding country for its food, as the Pays Basque gives few good things to the kitchen. Fish is the one excellent thing that Biarritz itself contributes to all the menus, and the Friture du Pays is always excellent. Here is a menu of a little dinner for three at the restaurant of the Little Casino. The Minestrone is an excellent Italian soup (which, by the way, Oddenino of the Imperial in London makes better than I have tasted it anywhere else out of Italy); the veal, I fancy, came from Paris, the ortolans from the far south :— Melon. Minestron Milanaise. Friture du Pays. Carre de Veau braise aux Cepes. Ortolans a la broche. Salade de Romaine. Coupes d’Entigny. I have not kept any bill for this, but I know that I regarded the total as moderate in a town where all things in September are at gambler’s prices. The Royalty, in the main street at Biarritz, is the afternoon gathering-place for the young bloods, who sit outside on the terrasse and there drink cooling liquids through straws out of long tumblers, while the ladies hold their parliament at tea-time in Miremont’s the con- fectioner’s shop almost next door.

38 The Gourmet's Guide to Europe Beauge’s is another quiet, essentially French res- taurant in this central quarter. It shows a brown lace, its principal entrance, and windows with lace curtains to the Rue St. Marc, and it has another en- Beauge’s, trance in one of the arcades behind the Rue st. Marc Varietes, its face turned towards the arcade being rather forbidding in appearance. It was founded in 1848, and except that it is lighted by electricity, must now be very much as it was when first built. The street entrance leads into a little ante-room where cold meats and tarts and fruit are set out temptingly. The tables are placed very close together in the little rooms on the ground floor, and the lady at the desk is squeezed up against the window^ in her little pen ; but the restaurant has a dignity of its own, and the plump proprietor is efficient though unhurrying. It has its “ dishes of the house.” There is, of course, a Sole Beauge} and there is a Filet de Barbue Beauge and Rognons Beauge, and a very special Tarte Beauge. The patrons of the restaurant are like its cookery, comfortable and unpretentious. Lapre’s, in the Rue Druot, next door to the Figaro offices, was originally an oyster shop, and still retains a little oyster bar in its front of light oak. Little Lapre’s, curtains of green silk and l-ace shelter Rue Druot diners and those who sup at Lapre’s from the eyes of the curious outside. A little grotto and creepers on trellis and baskets of illuminated flowers form part of the adornment of the first room. In the second room are more illuminated bouquets of flowers and mirrors in Oriental frames. Lapre’s is open all night long, and is much frequented by journalists and also by pretty ladies. It has its specialties, which are mostly of fish and oysters, and lobsters and langoustes. It has a dozen various methods of cooking shellfish, and its oyster soup and its Filet de Barbue are both excellent.

12 T^he Gourmet's Guide to Europe M. Braquesac has a racing stable, as his amusement, and his talk to his cronies amongst the clientele of the restaurant is generally of Longchamps and Auteuil and Maisons Lafitte. Young M. Braquesac, almost as distinguished in appearance as his father, is always in evidence as the manager of the restaurant. There is always a feeling of calm in Voisin’s. Paul, the maitre d'hote/, is quite episcopal in appearance, and the head sommelier, whose face is round and whose hair is curly, is equally well favoured. From the street a glass door leads straight into the restaurant. Two dames de comptoir, who sit at a little desk by the door, look as though their lives had been entirely free from trouble. Close to them, in one iof the small windows, the fruit for dessert is placed. Voisin’s has two rooms downstairs, an outer one and an inner. The white of its walls and the gleam of its mirrors are subdued by the deep red of the mahogany of its door and window frames. A little staircase leads to the rooms above. The great glory of Voisin’s is its cellar of red wines, its Burgundies and Bordeaux. The Bordeaux are arranged in their proper precedence, the wines from the great vineyards first, and the rest in their correct order down to mere bourgeois tipple. Against each brand is the price of the vintage of all the years within a drinkable period, and the man who knew the wine-list of Voisin’s thoroughly would be the greatest authority in the world on claret. Mr. Rowland Strong, in his book on Paris, tells how, one Christmas Eve, he took an Englishman to dine at Voisin’s, and how that Englishman demanded plum-pudding. The maitre d'hdtel was equal to the occasion. He was polite but firm, and his assertion that “the House of Voisin does not serve, has never served, and will never serve, plum-pudding ” settled the matter.

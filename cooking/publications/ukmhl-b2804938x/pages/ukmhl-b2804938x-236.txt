2i4 7/^ Gourmet's Guide to Europe Kiel Seebade-Anstalt The hotels and restaurants of Kiel are neither numerous nor recherche, and, with the exception of the sailorsâ€™ rendezvous, are mostly closed during the winter. The Seebade-Anstalt is about the best restaurant ; it was built by Herr Krupp and is managed by an Englishman. Above it are the fine rooms of the Imperial Yacht Club. These, during the regatta week, which generally takes place at the end of June, are crowded with yachtsmen of all nationalities, to whom the Kaiser dispenses most gracious hospitality. When the extensive anchorage, surrounded by green and wooded hills, is full of every description of yacht, foremost among which is the Hohen%ollern and many German battleships, it forms a scene at once impressive and gay. The Hotel Germania has a very fair restaurant attached to it. The Rathskeller is well conducted, and was built by the municipal authorities. The Weinstuben, Paul Fritz, is a good refreshment place, but is mostly frequented by the students and officers. The Seegarten is a pretty little place overlooking the harbour, where German beer is the principal article of commerce. At the Miinchener Btirgerbrau the beer is good but the surroundings dismal. There is a nine-hole golf course at Kitzeberg.

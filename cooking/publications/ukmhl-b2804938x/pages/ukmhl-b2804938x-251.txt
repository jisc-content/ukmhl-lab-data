Berlin 229 The Open Air Restaurants There are two or three cafe restaurants with shady gardens in the Thiergarten, of which one, the Cafe Gartner, on the river close to the CaK Gartner Bellevue Station, is a pleasant place at which to drink afternoon coffee. The cafe and res- taurant in the Zoological Gardens are very popular. At either end of a little lake is a band-stand, and two military bands play alternately in these The Zoological band-stands during the late afternoon Gardens and evening. From band-stand to band-stand stretches a great semi-circle of tables for beer and coffee drinkers, and at the back of this half-moon of tables is a restau- rant with many terraces, where a fixed-price dinner is served from 6 p.m. onwards. When all the tables are occupied, as they are on fine afternoons and evenings, the mass of people eating and drinking and listening to the music is quite one of the sights of Berlin. Berlin Clubs One of the best clubs in Berlin is the Imperial German Automobile Club. The Automobile, Kaiser is a member and patron. The Leipzigerplatz club-house on the Leipzigerplatz was formerly the residence of the Berlin banker Bleichroeder, and is decorated in Louis XVI. style. The entrance fee is 250 marks, the annual subscription 200 marks. There is a club dinner every Wednesday evening in the winter to which guests can be introduced. There is one long table in the centre room and smaller tables for parties. Ladies are admitted as guests on Sunday nights. Members of the Royal Automobile Club of London can become temporary members of the Berlin Club.

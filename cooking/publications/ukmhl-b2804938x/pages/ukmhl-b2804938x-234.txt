212 The Gourmet's Guide to Europe Kempinskiâ€™s, I did not risk a dinner which must have been partially prepared for some hours, and dined quite well a la carte. The Alster Pavilion, looking on to the smaller of the two lakes, the Binnen Alster, is a cafe more than Alster Pavilion, a restaurant. It has two great semi- Jungfernstieg- circles of windows overlooking the lake, and its red window-boxes, its red and green chairs, its little trees on the flat roof, its blue and white tiles and its gilding, make it as bright as a new penny piece. A legion of pigeons live on the roof, and come down to pick up the crumbs which are thrown to them from the people who sit at the tables. There is food of a simple kind to be obtained at this bright cafe and wine and beer house, and the pot of caviare which formed the basis of a supper I ate there was quite good. Its balconies and the space before its doors seem always to be filled by a good-natured crowd of merry-makers ; there is music there at all hours, and it plays quite an important part in the life of Hamburg. The Ferry House at Eulenhorst, which juts out into the Aussen Alster, the bigger of the two lakes, The Ferry House, is some little distance from the central Eulenhorst part of the town, and a pleasant way of reaching it is by steamer. On a sunny afternoon a large contingent of all Hamburg goes out there to drink coffee. A long white restaurant with a glassed-in balcony provides shelter should a shower of rain come on, and there are innumerable tables and chairs under the trees on the little promontory, all of which are occupied in fine weather. The Pavilion is made gay with boxes of bright flowers, and, like the Alster Pavilion, it is patronised by bright and merry people. At the Zoological Gardens there are two restaurants, with balconies overlooking the beer garden, in which a military band plays.

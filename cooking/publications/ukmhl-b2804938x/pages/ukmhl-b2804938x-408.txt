3B6 The Gourmet's Guide to Europe was very much like a whiting, but more heavily fleshed, served a la Colbert, beef, fowl, a vegetable dish and a sweet, a dinner quite well cooked, but nothing distinguished or interesting in it. The charge for this was 3 roubles, and as usual my humble pint of red wine and glass of old brandy were the largest items in the bill. I am told that both Ernest’s and Felicien’s are opened in the winter occasionally for the convenience of sleighing parties, and I can readily understand the pleasure of coming out of a mist of frozen snow into one of their com- fortable dining-rooms. Beyond the Islands, and well outside St. Petersburg, „ , , is the Samarkand, a restaurant which in winter serves as the point to which sleigh drives are made. It is not considered a first- class restaurant. In St. Petersburg I lunched one day at Leiner’s, a German restaurant on the Nevsky Prospect, which Leiner was very crowded and very bustling, 18 Nevsky and I ate a German meal which was Prospect plenteous for its price, 1 rouble. I drank some Russian Pilsener beer which was quite light and quite cool. There is a purely Russian restaurant, Palkine, Palkine on t^ie Nevsky Prospect, but having 17 Nevsky walked into it with the intention of Prospect ordering a Russian meal, I could find no one there who talked any language other than Russian, and in despair I beat a retreat. The Hotel de France has a luncheon at 75 kopeks, or is. 6d., which is very popular with the Hotel de France, business community of St. Petersburg, 6 Bolchaia ’ and its dining-room is crowded from Moskaia 12.30 to 2 o’clock. The food is not high-class, but of a good bourgeois description, and the place is kept by a Belgian, Mons. Renault.

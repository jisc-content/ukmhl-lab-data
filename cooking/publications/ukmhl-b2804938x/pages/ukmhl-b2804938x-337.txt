Switzerland 315 as that of a mullet. The Lotte is a fish locally in great favour. The trout are just as palatable as they were when Cambaceres used to import them into France for his suppers. The cooks at the Nord make of perch an excellent dish, and the king of the lake fish, the great char, the Ombre-chevalier, is generally on the bill of fare at the Nord. An Ombre-chevalier a la Genevoise is a noble dish. Petites truites a la Voltaire and Feras a la Bonne Tante are two admirable local dishes. The Nord has a good cellar of Swiss wines, commencing with Mont dâ€™Or at fr. 5 a bottle, and Clos de Rocher at fr. 4 a bottle. The Grand Fine Champagne of the house at fr. 1.50 a glass is to be recommended. The Kursaal on the northern side of the lake has a restaurant on its broad illuminated terrace.

At both a cheap table d'hote meal is served at midday. I have never lunched at the Jardin Anglais kiosk, but I have been much amused by the company, consisting largely of students, who eat their midday meal in summer at the glass house in the Jardin des

165 V HOLLAND The Food of the Country—The Hague Restaurants—The Hague Clubs—Scheveningen—Amsterdam—Rotterdam. The food of the middle-class Dutch consists to a great extent of vegetables, and it is characteristic of Dutch cleanliness that no lettuce is ever sent to table with a discoloured leaf on it, and that all vegetables are inspected with minute care to detect any blemish before they are allowed to go into the cooking-pot. Vegetable soups, salads, vegetable dishes and much fancy bread and butter and cheese, pastry, ginger- bread, honey cakes, and sweets form the principal dishes of a typical Dutch meal. A writer in Food and Cookery and the Catering World, writing on u Dutch Fare,” thus describes a typical Dutch breakfast. “ I made a note of what was actually on the table at the small and inexpensive hotel at which I put up in Amsterdam, and the list comprised various kinds of bread and rolls, including the currant rolls and loaves which are everywhere to be found, rye bread, biscuits, gingerbread (kept fresh in a small sarcophagus), liver sausage, salami, ham, raw ham, cold veal and pressed beef, all in slices, sardines, four kinds of cheese (the most violent restrained under a glass bell), marmalade, jam, butter, and a stand of boiled eggs. No wonder this hotel describes its breakfast as 4 ex- tensive.’ This is fairly typical of the first meal of the day in Holland, and one can do very well on it.

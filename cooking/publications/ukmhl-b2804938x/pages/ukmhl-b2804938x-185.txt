It is subsidised by the State and the Municipality. An excellent com- pany is always to be found there during the opera season, and prices are much lower than in London. Seats can be booked even in the cheapest parts of the house. On Sunday afternoons popular concerts are often given ; and during Carnival time there are several Fancy Dress Balls.

It is devoted to farces, usually of an extravagant or risque character. Smoking is allowed in this theatre. It is hardly the place to take one’s daughter or maiden aunt.

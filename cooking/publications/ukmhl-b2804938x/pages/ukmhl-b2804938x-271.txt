Italy 249 the very obvious one that the Venetians stroll about in the hottest weather all night long, one of these reasons being that during the Austrian occUpa- £iorian tion some young officers, finding the Florian closed, tore down the shutters and flung them into the Grand Canal, and that to keep this injury green the Florian kept open ever afterwards. The Lavena, in the great square, is the most popular of all the tea-rooms and confectioners, and in the summer the little tables before it stretch over a great space. Ortez, in the Via Ventidue Marzo, is another popular tea-room. The Zuppa di Peoci is a soup made from the little shell-fish called a peoci ” in Venice, but appearing under other names at Spezzia and Naples ; and so fond are the Venetians of it that they flavour their rice with sauce made from it, and call it Riso coi peoci. Baccala, or salt cod, and Calamai, little cuttle-fish or octopi, looking and tasting ’ like fried strips of soft leather, with tentacles which are delicious, are dishes of the people, and not to every one’s taste ; but the Anguille di Comacchio, the great eels from Comacchio, grilled on the spit between bay leaves, or fried or stewed, are excellent, and to be thoroughly recom- mended. Another Venetian dish which I can strongly recommend is the Fegato alia Veneziana, calf’s liver cut into thin slices, fried with onions in butter, and flavoured with lemon juice. The Frittura Mist a of the town is excellent. Stewed larks, with a pudding of Veronese flour, are satisfying, and a sausage from the neighbouring Treviso, which also gives its name to the Radici di Treviso, is much esteemed. The Pucca baruca is one of the big yellow pumpkins baked. The wines are, of course, those of the mainland, Conegliano from Treviso and Val Policella from Verona.

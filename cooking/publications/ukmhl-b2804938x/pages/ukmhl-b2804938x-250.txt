228 The Gourmet's Guide to Europe Military Restaurants There are also two restaurants in which the mili- tary element predominates. These are Toepfer’sand the Prinz Wilhelm, both in the Dorotheenstrasse. Here the officers usually lunch and use the res- Toepfer’s and Prinz Wilhelm Dorotheen- stra taurants as clubs, often bringing their wives. Cafes, Cabarets, AND Bars Bauer’s in Unter den Linden is a well-known cafe, and is much frequented by the Berliners. It is Bauer’s, Unter patronised by a large newspaper reading den Linden public, owing to the fact that there are few of the leading publications in all languages that you will fail to find there. This cafe is crowded in the afternoon and evening. Everything supplied there is of the best quality. The walls are decorated with paintings by Werner. Upstairs, between 5 and 6 p.m., one sees many of the people of the world of the theatres and music-halls. If you wish to see the rowdy student life of Berlin, the Bohemian festivity which corresponds to the life of Paris in the cabarets of Montmartre, and if you speak German, go to the Bauernschanke, which has obtained a celebrity for the violence and rudeness of its proprietor, who, as Lisbonne and Bruant used to do, and Alexander does, in the cabarets of the City of Light, insults his customers to the uttermost and turns out any one who objects. Die Rauberhole is an inferior imitation of Die Bauernschanke. A noted night restaurant is Der Zum Weissen Rossi, in which each room is decorated to represent some typical street in Berlin. This is a hostel much frequented by artists.

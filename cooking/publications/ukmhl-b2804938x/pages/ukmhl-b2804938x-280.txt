25B The Gourmet's Guide to Europe three “ turns ” were contributed by damsels who had no voice to speak of, and who as a compensation wore no garments worth mentioning. They came on smiling, and the audience in the gallery received them as old friends. Their first songs were allowed to pass, except that now and again some one in the gallery would help them with a high note, but the audience thought their second songs were superfluous. A very small puppy, a human one of course, up in the gallery, always gave the signal for the commencement of the noise by a very shrill howl, and then a cock crew and a big dog barked, and a donkey began to bray, and the damsels, smiling and not in the least dis- turbed, finished their songs in dumb show. But when the management brought out its good “ turns,” the gallery recovered its manners and became enthusiastic. A woman with a very good voice sang some operatic airs ; there was a comic man and an impudent little Frenchwoman dressed as a baby, and an imitator of the chief Italian actors of the day, who was the most popular of all the people appearing. FlESOLX There are various little restaurants in Fiesoli, each of which depends more on the views from its windows and terrace than on its cookery. The first place of refreshment to catch one’s eye on arriving is the Res- taurant Brioschi, and this, if one can obtain one of the two tables which are set on the little terrace, is perhaps the best place at which to lunch. The dining-room is comparatively airy, for it has windows in front and behind, and from the terrace the view over the country to Florence is a beautiful one.

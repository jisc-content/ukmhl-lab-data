Brussels 153 writing is the Filet de Bceuf in the Rue des Harengs ; but the public is fickle, and tastes Filet de Bceuf, are constantly changing. To-morrow Rue des Harengs another establishment may become the favourite, espe- cially should some patron with a circle of friends quarrel with the management, or take offence at an apparent inattention. The Filet de Boeuf is a very small restaurant, consisting of two salles, one called the “ pesage,” and the other the “ pelouse.” There are only six tables in each room, and only people well known, or recommended by the right set, have any chance of reserving a table. The patrons are prin- cipally leaders in the worlds of sport, finance, and the theatre. Everything is very dear, but very good. The dishes are specially cooked for each customer, and, consequently, one has to wait a little time after ordering before a dinner can be served. The Epaule de Mouton is also in the Rue des Harengs, one of the little streets already alluded to, which run from the Grand Place to the Epaule de Rue Marche aux Herbes. In this street, Mouton, Rue which is barely five yards wide, are des Haren£s some of the best restaurants of the town ; but the stranger must be particular and not enter the wrong door, as they are all huddled together, and the names of some of the establishments are very similar. There is, for instance, a Gigot de Mouton next door to the Epaule de Mouton. It is at the Epaule, however, where the better cuisine will be found. Behind the door on entering a snug corner for a tete-a-tete is to be found. Although the title of the establishment sug- gests Simpson’s and a cut off the joint, the bill of fare will be found thoroughly French, and everything is well and tastefully done. In ordering, it must be re- membered that one plat is enough for two persons, and this is the rule in most Belgian restaurants. The burgundy at L’Epaule de Mouton is renowned.

Italy 233 for his palate, used to the finest oil, revolts against the liquid fit only for the lubrication of machinery he so often is offered in Germany, England, and France. The fowls and figs of Tuscany, the white truffles of Piedmont, the artichokes of Rome, the walnuts and grapes of Sorrento, might well stir a gourmet to poetic flights. The Italians are very fond of their Risotto, the rice which they eat with various seasonings, a burro e for- maggio, a sugo di pomodoro, a sugo di came, the latter best suited to the robust British palate. The Italians, however, do not cook their rice to that point of softness to which we are accustomed. They also eat their Paste asciutte in various forms. It is Mac- cheroni generally in Naples, Spaghetti in Rome, Trinetti in Genoa. Alla Siciliana and con Vongole are but two of the many ways of seasoning the Spaghetti. Again, the delicate little envelopes of paste containing force- meat of some kind or another change their names according to their contents and the town they are made in. They are Ravioli both at Genoa and Flor- ence, but at Bologna they are Tortolini, and at Turin Agnolotti. Perpadelle, another paste dish with a little difference of seasoning, becomes Tettachine when the venue changes from Bologna to Rome. The egg is an important primo piatto at lunch (col- laooione'). In the egg da here the chill is just taken off it, and it is drunk out of the shell—not a pleasant operation either to see or to hear. The open egg— uove aperte—is a safe thing in remote districts, being two eggs fried and served up in the enamelled metal dish in which they are cooked. Be careful to ask for them a burro, otherwise you may get them done in oil. Fried or poached eggs, a salso di pomodoro (with tomato sauce), are distinctly tasty. Then there is every variety of stuffed egg (uove ripieneJ, those with a basis of anchovy and parsley being the most savoury.

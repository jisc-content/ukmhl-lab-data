no The Gourmet's Guide to Europe stand are tanks, and in these swim fish, large and small, the fine lazy dorades and the lively little sea- gudgeon. One of the amusements of the place is that the breakfasters fish out with a net the little fishes which are to form a friture, or point out the bigger victim which they will presently eat for their meal. The cooking is simple and good, and with fish that thirty minutes before were swimming in the green water, an omelette, a simple dish of meat, and a pint of Cerons, or other white wine, a man may breakfast in the highest content, looking at some of the sunniest scenes in the world. There is always some little band of Italian musicians playing and singing at the Reserve, and though in London one would vote them a nuisance, at Cannes the music seems to fit in with the lazy pleasure of breakfasting almost upon the waves, and the throaty tenor who has been singing of Santa Lucia gets a lining of francs to his hat. Most of the crowned heads who make holiday at Cannes have taken their breakfast often enough in the little glass summer-house, but the prices are in no way alarming. A new dining and supping place has been given to The Casino Cannes by the building of the Muni- cipal Casino. The Casino stands on the Croisette, and the windows of its great white restaurant look on to the wide sea-wall and promenade on one side, to the harbour on another side, and out to sea on a third side. The manager, M. Renaud, is one of M. Ritzâ€™s lieutenants of old days, and everything is done with the finish of a first-class establishment. It is the place at which most of the fashionable dinner- parties of Cannes are now given. It is not cheap, but all the prices are marked against the dishes on the bill of fare, and no man need order an expensive meal unless he is inclined to do so. I found that my average bill for breakfast came to between 8 and IQ francs,

Brussels 15 5 very moderate, and the plats du jour range from 1 franc to 1 franc 75 centimes, each plat being enough for two persons. Breakfast dishes, such as CEufs Gratines aux Crevettes and CEufs Brouilles au foie de Volaille, are also well done here. Ecrevisses Regina used to be a special dish of the house. There are always two special plats du soir. During the Brussels Exhibition of 1910 a number of new restaurants were opened in the neighbourhood of the Porte de Namur, but several of them do not look like surviving. Al- ready the names of some have been changed with the idea of attracting new clients. At the corner of the street leading to the Moliere Theatre from the Chaussde d’lxelles there is a large cafe-restaurant, which, after being closed for a short time, has re- opened under new management and is well spoken of. The Old Tour Tavern and the Cafe de l’Horloge are much frequented in this locality. The Helder is in the Rue de l’Ecuyer, near the Opera House. It is a smart restaurant, and the rendezvous of the monde elegant in Helder, Rue Brussels. No one thinks of dining de 1’Ecuyer there before half-past eight or nine o’clock. The proprietor is M. Artus fils, whom many will remember at the Carlton in London. He is a son of M. Artus of the Laiterie, and has gained a wide experience in high-class hotels and restaurants. He should be personally consulted if a special dinner is wanted. The Filet de Sole is in the neighbourhood of the markets and close by the Palais d’Ete. In the days when Emile Beaud was proprietor an met de sole, excellent lunch could be obtained here Rue Gretry at a fixed price, but now everything is a la carte. Prices are lower than at most of the first-class restau- rants, but the cuisine and wines are both safe and sound. There are private rooms upstairs. Wiltcher’s, on the Boulevard de Waterloo, provides

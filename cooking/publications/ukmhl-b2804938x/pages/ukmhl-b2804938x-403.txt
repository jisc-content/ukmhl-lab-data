Russia 381 play their parts, are the only Russian soups generally known ; but they are only two out of two-score delightful soups of the national cuisine. Batrennia and Okroshka are two soups which are supped cold ; Uktra is a favourite fish soup, and Selianka is a particularly delicate soup made from the sturgeon and sterlet. Many of the Russian soups obtain a distinctive flavour from roots, or berries, or nuts, which is a proof of their peasant origin. A purely Russian custom is to serve little fish pasties with the soup. These are either eaten separately or put into the liquid and beaten into pieces. These pasties or pates are of all sizes and all kinds. They may be a tiny scrap of paste enveloping one or two shrimps, or the more elaborate Tartelettes St. Hubert, or the Rastegai which is almost in size a fish-pie, a circular casing of very light paste containing a complicated fish stuffing, a little round hole in the top of the pate being left in order that the gourmet, before he eats it, shall put some fresh caviare there. A Rastegai is generally cut into four pieces, and makes four exquisite mouthfuls. Of fish, chiefly fresh-water fish, Russia has an abundance. The sturgeon naturally makes its appearance in some form on most menus, and so does the sterlet, which is generally cooked in white wine and served with shrimp sauce. One of the distinctively Russian fish dishes is a pie of successive layers of rice, eggs, and fish, which is something like our Kedgeree. Cold boiled Moscow sucking-pig is very delicious meat. The little pig is fed from his birth to the day of his death on nothing but cream, and its flesh is pure white. Horse-radish sauce and the sharp-tasting cream, which it is a libel to call “sour,” are eaten with this angelic piglet. Roast mutton stuffed with buck-wheat is a dish by no means to be despised. Srazis are little rolled strips of mutton with forcemeat inside fried in butter.

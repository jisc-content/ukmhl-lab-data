Turkey 359 every form ; one method of cooking them, and that one not easily forgotten, is to smother a cold aubergine in onion, garlic, salt, and oil ; this is named Tmam Bayldi. Keinfte are small meat-balls tasting strongly of onions. Loufer fish, fried or grilled ; Plaki fish, eaten cold ; Picti fish in aspic ; small octopi stewed in oil ; the Espadon, or sword-fish, grilled ; Mousaka, vege- table marrows sliced, with chopped meat between the slices and baked ; Tachni, meat stewed with celery and other vegetables ; Kebap, w kabobs ” with a bay- leaf between each little bit of meat ; Kastanato, roasted chestnuts stewed in honey, and quinces treated in the same manner ; vermicelli stewed in honey ; and pre- serves of rose leaves, orange flowers, and jessamine— all are to be found in the Turkish cuisine. The Turk is the best sweetmeat maker in Europe, and a tin of rose-leaf jam, or a wooden box of Rahat Lakoum, freshly made, is always an acceptable gift to take home to England to any household. The Roti Kowzoum is lamb impaled whole on a spit like a sucking-pig, which it rather resembles in size, being very small. It is well over-roasted and sent up whole. I am informed on the best authority that when a host wishes to do you honour he tears pieces of!' it with his fingers and places them before you, and you have to devour them in the same manner. I herewith give a typical Turkish dinner :— Duzico. Hors d’ceuvre. Yalandji Dolmas. Potage. Creme d’Orgo. Poisson. Espadon. See. Anchois.

366 The Gourmet's Guide to Europe are some of the sweets of the cuisine. All Grecian cookery is done over a charcoal fire. A too great use of oil is the besetting sin of the indifferent Greek cook. The egg-plant is the great “ stand-by” of the Grecian kitchen ; it is stuffed in a dozen different ways. The food of the peasant is grain, rice, goat-flesh when he can get it, a skinny fowl on the great festivals, milk, and strong-tasting cheese. A bunch of grapes and a hunch of sour bread is his usual hot weather meal. The Grecian wines, though some of them taste shockingly of resin, are not unpalatable. Solon, Soutzos, Kephista, Kephallenia, are all quite drink- able ; and the better-class wines of Kephallenia, and those of Patras, made by a German firm, are enjoy- able. Much of the Greek wine goes to Vienna and other centres of the wine trade, and reappears with labels on the bottles having no connection with Greece. Athenian Restaurants The restaurants of Athens are not happy hunting- grounds for the Anglo-Saxon gourmet. The Restau- rant Splendid, in the Hotel des Etrangers, Place de la Constitucion, the Minerva, and the D’Athenes, both in the Rue de Stade, are the pick of a not too promising bunch ; and Murray recommends one in Amalias Street, near the Palace, which I do not remember to have seen. A most grave litterateur to whom, as he had been lately travelling in Greece, I applied for supplemen- tary information, applied the adjective “ beastly ” to all Greek restaurants, and added that the one great crying need of Greece and Athens is an American bar for the sale of cooling drinks in the Parthenon.

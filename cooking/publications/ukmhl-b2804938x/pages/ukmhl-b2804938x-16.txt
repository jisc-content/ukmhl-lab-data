viii ^Preface to Ehird Edition Algernon Bastard, who was my collaborates in the first edition of this book. I once more plead extenuating circumstances should there be any inaccuracies in the book, for it is very difficult, even with willing helpers, for one man to keep his eye on all the restaurants of Europe. With the publisherâ€™s cordial assent, no advertise- ments of any hotels or restaurants appear in the book. As travelling gourmets, for the good of the great epicurean brotherhood, have helped me in the past by sending me information of any new dining-places which can be recommended, and of any alterations and improvements in old-fashioned ones, so I hope they will continue to do in the future. I am particularly indebted to several German and Austrian gentlemen who have written to me concerning the chapters on their countries. Any letters addressed to me at the Naval and Military Club, Piccadilly, will be gratefully received and acknowledged. N. NEWNHAM-DAVIS.

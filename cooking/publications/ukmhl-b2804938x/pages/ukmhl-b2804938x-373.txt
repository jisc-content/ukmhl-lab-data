351 Roumania journey from Bucarest is not a long one, and is in- teresting. At Ploesci, a junction on the line where all trains stop, there is a refreshment room where a cheap and plentiful table d'hote meal is served. Sinaia is very fashionable in the summer, for most of the ministers and many of the foreign diplomatists follow the King and Queen up to the picturesque village in the woods below the great grey Restaurant crags. Capsa has a gay little restaurant Capsa, Bouie- on the Boulevard Chica, a little pavilion vard Chlca of iron and glass, painted and gilt, which is open dur- ing the summer months; and George Riegier’s, Riegler has a dainty little coffee-house Tlle Park and terrace and a tiny garden where a cascade falls over miniature boulders next door to one of the bandstands. The Hotel Caraiman, on a hill just above the station, is open summer and winter. In summer it is crowded to its holding capacity. In HoteI Caraiman winter a score or guests have the big hotel to themselves. I can answer for the meals at the hotel being simple and well cooked, and a stranger arriving during the “ off season ” is flattered with much attention.

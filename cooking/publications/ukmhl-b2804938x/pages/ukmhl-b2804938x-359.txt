337 Austria suffered “ a cure ” at Carlsbad. The life the “ cure guests ” lead is very similar at both places. I have found the great glass shelter of _ the imperial crowded with representa- tives of the innermost circle of London society eating lean ham and kompotts, and I have lunched at the Stern where the company was equally stern select and where the Fogash and the chicken were excellently cooked. The late King Edward generally gave his dinner on the birthday of the Emperor of Austria at the Kurhaus, where a suite of rooms are called “The e Ur aUS King’s Rooms ” ; and when Lady Goschen gave a lunch at which King Edward was the principal guest, the Rubezahl, a great cafe and restau- The Riihezahl rant and hotel, which has red roofs, Caf® looks like an old chateau, and stands on a height near the town, was the restaurant selected. The Nettuno in the town is spoken of with enthusiasm by its habitues. The Rubezahl is a very favourite cafe at afternoon tea-time, and the Cafe Egerlander is n • i i c ° • rpi Cafe Egerlander equally in vogue at breakrast-time. 1 he latter stands high, and from its terrace, where is the usual little grove of trees, there is a fine view of the valley and the plain. The rooms are replicas of par- lours and kitchens and bedrooms in the houses of the picturesque district of Egerland, and the waitresses are all in the handsome dress of the Egerland peasants. The proprietor of the Egerland Cafe, Herr Ott (a gentle, pleasant, elderly man with a beard, who is generally to be found in his cafe at any hour of the day), began life in a turner’s shop. Now he not only owns the Egerland Cafe, but Ott’s Hotel and a cafe in the town as well. His wife may always be seen at tea-time in the spotlessly clean kitchen of the Egerland Cafe in command of a legion of waitresses. Y

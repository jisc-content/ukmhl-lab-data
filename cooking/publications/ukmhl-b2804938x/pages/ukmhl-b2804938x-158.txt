136 The Gourmet's Guide to Bur ope woods, which is caused by the wholesale destruction of the birds. How the supply is kept up it is difficult to say, but no Belgian dinner is considered complete without a bird of some sort, and when grives are in season, thousands must be served daily. A grive proper is a thrush, but blackbirds and starlings often find their way to the casserole under the name of a grive. They are cooked with the trail, in which mountain-ash berries are often found. These give the bird a peculiar and rather bitter flavour, but the berry mostly used in the cooking is that of the juni- per plant, which grows very plentifully in Belgium. When grives go out of season, we have woodcock and snipe ; and there are several houses which make a specialty of Becasses a la fine Champagne. At Mons and at Liege, and I think at Charleroi also, there is every year a woodcock feast, just as there is an oyster feast at Colchester. At these festivities a little wax candle is placed on the table beside each guest, so that he can take the head of his becasse and frizzle it in the flame before he attacks its brains. Then we have plovers and larks in any quantity, but I would not like to vouch for what are often served as alouettes and mauviettes. The one bird that we 'never get in Belgium is grouse, unless it is brought over specially from England or Scotland. It has always been found impossible to rear grouse in the country. In the neighbourhood of Spa there are great stretches of moorlands reaching almost to the German frontier, covered with heather, which look as if they would be the ideal home of the grouse. Here M. Barry Herr- feldt, formerly of the Chateau du Marteau at Spa, a real good sportsman, tried his utmost to rear grouse ; first he laid down thousands of eggs and set them under partridges, but this proved a failure ; then he introduced young birds, but they all died oflF, and I think he has now given up the attempt in despair.

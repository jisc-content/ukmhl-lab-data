(tAu stria 335 restaurant with its terrace and many tables looks quite picturesque and in keeping with its surround- ings, and one lunches within a biscuit-throw of the river, and with the sound of the rapids as an accom- paniment. The village and mineral water establishment at Giesshubel in the valley of the Eger is almost beyond walking distance, though it is quite a pleasant day’s outing to go there by 16SS U 6 public coach in the morning and to walk back in the cool of the afternoon. The establishment has a restaurant where very much the same food as is to be found in the Carlsbad restaurants is ready for visitors at remarkably cheap rates. A most benevolent old manager is in charge of this part of the establishment. There is a pretty little park in which to stroll after lunch, and on the hillside is the spring which supplies the well-known table water. You may see it bubble up in a basin of marble covered by a curve of crystal. A pleasant drive’s distance from Carlsbad is Elbogen, a mediaeval town and castle high on a rocky knoll looped by the river. At the hotel in the market- place there is a charming terrace, parti- ally roofed over, from which there is a fine view of the gorge of the river where it makes one of its hairpin "turns. The food is simple and the service elementary, but the situation and surroundings make the terrace of the Elbogen inn a notable lunching place. At Eger, which forms a point for a train excursion from Carlsbad, the restaurant at the station is the best feeding place of the town. A portion of the platform is railed off before the restaurant, and in this enclosure one can sit and lunch or dine and watch all the bustle and the coming and going of the trains,

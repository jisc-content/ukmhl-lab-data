400 The Gourmet's Guide to Europe Yalta The Crimea to an Englishman vaguely suggests snow and hardships, but none of the Rivieras of Europe is more delightful in spring or autumn than that which stretches from Livadia to Feodosia, and has Yalta, Simeis, Aloupka, Alouchta, Soudak, and Feodosia on its shores. Of these luxurious villages of sea baths the Englishman is most likely to find himself at Yalta. The Russian Riviera is just as expensive as the Hotel de Paris, French one, and the man who dines at Quay the restaurant of the Hotel de Paris in a pavilion up to which come the wavelets, will get Parisian cookery and Parisian prices. The Cafe Florin, the restaurant of which juts out Cafe Florin, * into the water, is another attractive and Quay expensive dining and lunching place. There is an amusing restaurant in the public garden of the town.

Russia 391 dress. On Sundays and holy days the waiters, I am told, wear coloured silk garments, but this I cannot answer for from personal observation. I placed my party for luncheon at a vacant table, and one of the white-tunicked waiters put into my hand a bill of fare in Russian. I could see that the dishes were divided into three categories, and should have understood nothing more had not one of the managers, a kindly person, rubicund, and walking delicately in a way which suggested gouty big toes, come to my rescue. If he was not French, he talked French like a Frenchman, and he explained that eggs and fish were in the first section, cold meats in the second, and hot meats in the third. Of these we had a choice of two dishes for i rouble 25 kopeks. An omelette and a salmi of grouse were what the maitre cThotel recommended, and though both of these were certainly not Russian dishes, we ate them and were grateful. I began very well with the rubicund maitre d'hotel, but I soon fell in his estimation. I had been a week in Russia and I had not tasted any of the Russian wines. I was told that both the red and white wines grown on the Emperor’s estates in the Caucasus were extremely good, and the Ermitage seemed to me to be exactly the restaurant where the best crus of the best years of the best wines of the country would be found. I asked the maitre d’hotel. He appeared to be insulted, but then remembered that I was only an Englishman, and could not be expected to know the custom of the country. “ I believe there are such wines,” he said, “ but we know nothing of them here.” Besides the large suite of public dining-rooms at the Ermitage there are many private ones, some of them large enough to accommodate all the guests at official banquets which are usually held here.

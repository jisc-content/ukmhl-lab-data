382 Tthe Gourmets Guide to Europe In England Blinis make their appearance with caviare at dinners at all times of the year, and I fancy that most Anglo-Saxons think that they are a Russian sub- stitute for our crumpets. This is what an English- man resident in Russia writes to me on the subject: “Blinis are not only eaten at Cubat’s and the Ermitage, but they are eaten in dozens and thousands of dozens all over orthodox Russia, from the Winter Palace to the most humble house—but they are eaten only during one week of the year, Carnival week, the week preceding Lent. Blinis are not like crumpets. They are in fact nothing but American buck-wheat cakes, about the same shape and weight, if anything a little lighter. They are made of wheat and of buck-wheat, and are eaten with hot melted butter, smetana (thick sour cream) and fresh caviare. There are also fancy blinis with whitebait, onions, carrots, baked into the paste. In one shape or another they are devoured by all the millions of Russians twice a day for a week. The merchants, who are still a special 4 caste ’ in Russia, make it a point to eat as many as possible, and manage to swallow several dozen at a sitting.” As a contrast, let me give you an extract from an article by Miss Insley which appeared in the Daily Mail,, under the heading of 44 Everyday Life in Russia,” and which describes a family dinner in a Russian country house, and the menu of a dinner given by Count Lamsdorff at the St. Petersburg Foreign Office. The Count evidently kept a French chef, and the dinner is curiously cosmopolitan in its composition. Huitres d’Ostende. Consomme au fumet de truffes. Petits pates. Homards a la “ Hohenzollern.”

‘Turkey 361 men wear fezzes. This does not necessarily mean that they are Turks, for many Greeks and other Christians whose business takes them amongst the Turks wear the fez as attracting less attention in Stamboul than a “ pot hat ” does. The managers of the restaurants wear the frock-coat of ordinary civili- sation ; the waiters wear aprons. There are always some Eastern as well as French dishes on the bill of fare, and a pilaf and a mousaka at Tokatlian’s give a very fair idea of what a well-to-do Turk eats. My neighbours on the last occasion I dined at Tokatlian’s were two Greek ladies at a table on one side and a German merchant and three young men in fezzes on the other. Grilled trout, roast partridges, and great slices of water melon formed the dinner of the men’s party ; the ladies ate cakes and sweets. Little chunks of a big Espadon fish, rather oily and fried in a cover- ing of bay leaves, were the Eastern delicacies of my repast, which otherwise, except for the Cafe Turc, was a French dinner. Most of the diners at Tokatlian’s drink the beer of the country, which is very light, and is brought to table cellar-cold. Janni’s, also in the Grande Rue, but at the opposite end to Tokatlian’s, is a very cosmopolitan restau- rant, and its cartes de jour are made janni’s, out in Turkish, Greek, Armenian, and Grande Rue French. It consists of several rooms screened off by coloured glass divisions. Pilafs and other Turkish dishes are to be found on the bill of fare, and an attempt is made to cater for the tastes of all the nations. Janni’s keeps open at night so long as any customers remain there. Toughourt, curdled milk, is a favourite dish with the Turks, and Europeans take very Laiterie de Pera kindly to it. It can be got at the Grande Rue Laiterie de Pera, in the Grande Rue, and can be eaten in the shop.

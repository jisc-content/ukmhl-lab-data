322 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Where Vegetables and Fowls, &c. are twice dressed, they add to the appearance of the table the first time; three sweet things may form the second appearance without greater expense. The Bills of Fare which have been given frompa^re 309 to 320, may be modified at discretion. In some houses, one dish at a time is sent up Avith the vegetables or sauces proper to it, and this in suc- cession hot and hot. In others, a course of Soups and Fish; then Meats and boiled Fowls, Turkey, &c. Made Dishes and Game follow; and, lastly, Sweet Dishes ; but these are not the common modes. It is worthy observation here, that common cooks do not think of sending up such articles as are in the house, unless ordered ; though, by so doing, tlie addition of a collared or pickled thing, some Frit- ters, fried Patties, or quick-made Dumplings, would be useful when there happen to be accidental A isitors : and at all times it is right to better the appearance of the table rather than let things spoil beloAv, by which the expense of a family is more in- creased than can be easily imagined. Vegetables are put on the side-table at large dinners, as like- Avise sauces, and servants bring them round: but some inconveniences attend this plan ; and, when there are not many to Avait, delay is occasioned, besides that, by awkwardness, the clothes of the company may be spoiled. If the table is of a due size, the articles alluded to will not fill it too much. SUPPERS. Hot suppers are not much in use Avhere peopk, bne very late. When required, the top and bottom, or either, may be Game. Fowls. Rabbit. Boiled F'ish, such as Soles, Mackerel. Oysters stewed or scalloped. French Beans. Cauliflower, or Jeru- salem Artichokes, in Avhite Sauce. Broccoli Avith

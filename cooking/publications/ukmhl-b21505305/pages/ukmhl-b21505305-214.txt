DOMESTIC COOKERY. m Pigeon Pie. Rub the pigeons with pepper and salt, inside and out; ill the latter put a bit of butter, and, if approved, some parsley chopjied with the livers, and a little of the same seasoning. Lay a beef steak at the bottom of the dish, and the birds on it; between every two, a hard egg. Put a cup of water in the dish ; and if you have any ham in the house, lay a bit on each pigeon : it is a great improvement to the flavour. Observe, when ham is cut for gravy or pies, to take the under jiart rather than the prime. Season the gizzards, and two joints of the wings, and put them in the centre of the pie; and over them, in a hole made in the crust, three feet nicely cleaned, to show wdiat pie it is. Partridge Pie in a duh. Pick and singe lour partridges ; cut off the legs at the knee ; season with pepper, salt, chopped parsley, thyme, and mushrooms. Lay a veal-steak, and a slice of ham, at the bottom of tlie dish: put the partridge in, and half a pint of good brotli. Put puff paste on the ledge of the dish, and cover with the same ; brush it over with egg, and bake an hour. Hare Pie, to eat eold. Season the hare after it is cut up ; and bake it, with eggs and forcemeat, in a raised crust or dish. When it is to be served, cut off the lid, and cover it with jelly- gravy, as in 111. A French Pie. Lay a puff-paste round on the ledge of the dish : and put ill either veal in slices, rabbits or chickens jointed ; witli forcemeat-balls, sweetbreads cut in pieces, arti- choke-bottoms, and a few truffles.

Scald and blanch some broad beans; cut young carrots, tuinips, ai ticlioke-bottoms, mush rooms, pease, onions, lettuce, parsley, celery, or any of them you have ; make the whole into a nice stew, with some good veal-gravy.

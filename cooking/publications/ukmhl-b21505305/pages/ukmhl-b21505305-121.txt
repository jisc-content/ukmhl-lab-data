V£Ar,. 45 Knuckle q/' Veal. As few people aie fond of boiled veal, it may be well to leave the knuckle small, and take off' some cutlets or collops before it be dressed; but as the knuckle will keep longer than the fillet, it is best not to cut off'the slices till wanted. Break the bones, to make it take less room; wash it well; and put it into a sauce-pan with three onions, a blade of mace or two, and a few pepper-corns; cover it with water, and simmer till quite ready. In the mean time some macaroni should be boiled with it if approved, or rice, or a little rice-flour, to give it a small degree of thickness ; but don’t puttoo much. Before it is served, add half a pint of milk and eream, and let it come up either with or without the meat. Or fry the knuckle with sliced onion and butter to a good brown ; and btive ready peas, lettuce, onion, and a cucumber or two, stewed in a small quantity of water an hour: their add these lo the veal; and stew it till the meat is tender enough to eat, but not overdone. Throw in pepper, salt, and a bit of shred mint, and serve all together. Shoulder of Veal. Cut off the knuckle, for a stew or gravy. Boast tlie other part with stuffing : you may lard it. Serve with melted butter. The blade-bone, with a good deal of meat left on, eats extremely well with mushroom or oyster-sauce, or mushroom-ketchup in butter. Neck of Veal. Cut off the scrag to boil, and cover it with onion- sauce. It should be boiled in milk and water. Parsley and butter may be served with it, instead of onion- sauce. Or it may be stewed with whole rice, small onions, and pepper-corns, with a very little water. Or boiled and eaten with bacon and greens. The best end may be either roasted, broiled as steaks, or made into pies.

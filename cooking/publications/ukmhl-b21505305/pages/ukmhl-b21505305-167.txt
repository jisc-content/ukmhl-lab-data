POULTRY. 87 To boil Ducks. Choose a fine fat duck; salt it two days, then boil It slowly in a cloth. Serve it with onion-sauce, but melt the butter with milk instead of water. To stew Ducks. Half-roast a duck; put it into a stew-pan w'ith a pint of beef-gravy, a few leaves of sage and mint cut small, pep- per and salt, and a small bit of onion shred as fine as possi- ble. Simmer a quarter of an hour, and skim clean; then add near a quart of green peas. Cover close, and simmer near half an hour longer. Put in a piece of butter and a little flour, and give it one boil; then serve in one dish. To hash Ducks. Cut a cold duck into joints ; and warm it, witho boiling in gravy, and a glass of port wine. To roast Goose. After it is picked, the plugs of the feathers pulled out, and the hairs carefully singed, let it be well washed and dried, and a seasoning put in of onion, sage, and pep- per and salt. Fasten it tight at the neck and rump, and then roast. Put it first at a distance from the fire, and by degrees draw it nearer. A slip of paper should be skewered on the breast-bone. Baste it very well. When the breast is rising, take off the paper; and be careful to serve it before the breast falls, or it will be spoiled by coming flatted to table. Let a good gravy be sent in the dish.â€”Gravy and apple-sauce: goose- berry sauce lor a green goose. To stew Giblets. Do them as will be directed for giblet-pie (under the head Pies]; season them with salt and pepper, and a very small piece of mace. Before serving, give them one boil with a cup of cream, and a piece of butter rubbed in a tea-spoonful of flour. Pifreons May be dressed in so many ways, that they are very useful. The good flavour of them depends very much on their being cropped and drawn as soon as killed. No other bird requires so much washing.

SWEET DISHES. 205 scraped lean ham, or grated tongue, put in at first, is a very pleasant addition. Four eggs will make a pretty sized omlet; but many cooks will use eight or ten. A. small proportion of flour should be used. If the taste be approved, a little tarragon gives a fine flavour. A good deal of parsley should be used. Ramakins and omlet, though usually served in the course, would be much better if they were sent up after, that they might be eaten as hot as possible. Butter to nerve as a little Dish. Roll butter in different forms; either like apine, and make the marks with a tea-spoon, or roll it in crimping rollers, work it through a colander, or scoop with a tea-spoon, and mix with grated beef, tongue or ancho- vies. Make a wreath of curled parsley to garnish. Ramakins. Scrape a quarter of a pound of Cheshire, and ditto of Gloucester cheese, ditto of good fresh butter; then beat all in a mortar with the yolks of four eggs, and the in- side of a small French roll boiled in cream till soft; mix the j)aste with the whites of the eggs previously beaten, and put into small paper pans made rather long than square, and bake in a Dutch oven till of a fine brown. They should be eaten quite hot. Some like the addition of a glass of white wine.â€”The batter for ramakins is equally good over macaroni when boiled tender; or on stewed brocoli, celery, or cauliflower, a little of the gravy they have been stewed in being put in the dish with them, but not enough to make the vegetable swim. Fonda. Take equal quantities of grated parmesan and good Cheshire cheese, and add about double the weight of this in beaten yolk of eggs and melted butter, beat well together, add pep[>erand salt and then put to it the whites of the eggs, which hav'e been beaten separatelv ; stir them lightly in, and bake it in a deep dish, fill only half full, as it will rise very much. Serve quite hot. s

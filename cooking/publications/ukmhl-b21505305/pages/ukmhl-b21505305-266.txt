Take a stew-pan full of the large-flap mushrooms, that are not worm-eaten, and the skins and fringe of those you have pickled, throw a handful of salt among them, and ^et them by a slow fire; they will produce a great deal of Mquor, which you must strain; and put to it 4 ounces of shalots, two cloves of garlic, a good deal of pepper, ginger, mace, cloves, and a few bay-leaves—boil and skim very well. AVhen cold, cork close. In two months boil it u]) again with a little fresh spice and a stick of horse-radish, and it will thenkeep the year; whichmush- room ketchup rarely does, if not boiled a second time. Walnut Ketchup of the finest sort. Boil or simmer a gallon of the expressed juice of walnuts when they are tender, and skim it well; then put in two pounds of anchovies, bones and liquor, ditto of shalots, one ounce of cloves, ditto of mace, ditto of pepper, and one clove of garlic. Let all simmer till the shalots sink; then put the liquor into a pan till cold; bottle and divide the spice to each. Cork closely, and tie a bladder over. It will keep twenty years, and is not good the first. Be very careful to express the juice at home ; for it is rarely unadul- terated, if bought. Some people make liquor of the outside shell when the nut is ripe; but neither the flavour nor the colour is then so fine. Cockle Ketchup. Open the cockles, scald them in their own liquor ; add a little water when the liquor settles, if you have not enough ; strain through a cloth, then season with every savoury spice; and if for brown sauce, add port, anchovies, and garlic—if for white, omit these, and put a glass of sherry, lemon-juice and peel, mace, nutmeg, and white pepper. If for brown, burn a bit of sugar for colouring. It is better to have cockles enough than to add water; and they are cheap.

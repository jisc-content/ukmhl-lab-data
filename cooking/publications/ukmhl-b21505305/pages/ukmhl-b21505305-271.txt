SWEET DISHES. 183 J aunemange. Pour a pint of boiling water over 2 oz. of isinglass, and when it is dissolved add three quarters of a pint of white wine, the juice of two oranges, and one lemon, the peel of a lemon shred fine, sweeten this to your taste, and add the yolks of eight eggs, let it simmer gently, strain and pour it into moulds. Turn out next day. A71 excellent Trifle. Lay macaroons and ratafia-drops over the bottom of your dish, and pour in as much raisin wine as they will suck up; which, when they have done, pour on them cold rich custard made with viore erjgs than directed in the foregoing pages, and some rich flour. It must stand two or three inches thick; on that put a layer of rasp- berry jam, and cover the whole with a very high whip made the day before, of rich cream, the whites of two well-beaten eggs, sugar, lemon-peel, and raisin wine, w'ell beat with a whisk, kept only to whip syllabubs and creams. If made the day before used, it has quite a different taste, and is solid and far better. Gooseberry or Apple Trifle. Scald such a quantity of either of these fruits, as, when pidped through a sieve, will make a thick layer at the bottom of your dish; if of apples, mix the rind of half a lemon grated fine; and to both as much sugar as will be pleasant. Mix half a pint of milk, half a pint of cream, and the yolk of one egg ; give it a scald over the fire, and stir it all the time; don't let it boil; add a little sugar only, and let it grow cold. Lay it over tlie apples with a spoon; and then put on it a whip made the day before, as for other Trifle. Chantilly Cake, or Cake Trifle. Bake a rice cake in a mould. When cold, cut it round about two inches from the edge with a sharp knife, taking care not to perforate the bottom. Put in a thick custard, and some tea-spoonfuls of raspberry jam, and then put on a whip. n

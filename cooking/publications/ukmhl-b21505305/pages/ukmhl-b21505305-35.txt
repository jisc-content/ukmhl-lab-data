(V) Hence the direction of a t(d>le is no inconsiderable branch of a ladyâ€™s concern, as it involves judgment in expenditure; respectability of appearance; and the com- fort of her husband and those who partake their hospi- tality. The mode of covering the table differs in taste. It is not the multiplicity of things, but the choice, the dress- ing, and the neat pleasing look of the whole, which gives respectability to her who presides. Too much, or too little dinners are extremes not uncommon : the latter is in appearance and reality the effort of poverty or pe- nuriousness to be genteel-, and the former, if constantly given, may endanger the circumstances of those w'ho are not affluent. Generally sjieaking, dinners are far less sumptuous than formerly, when half a dozen dishes were supplied for what one now costs; consequently those whose for- tunes are not great, and wfflo wish to make a genteel ap- pearance, without extravagance, regulate their table ac- cordinglv. Perhaps there are few incidents in which the respecta- bility of a man is more immediately felt, than the style of dinner to which he accidentally may bring home a visitor. Every one is to live as he can afford, and the meal of the tradesman ought not to emulate the enter- tainments of the higher classes, but if two or three dishes are well served, with the usual sauces, the table-linen clean, the small sideboard neatly laid, and all that is necessary be at hand, the expectation of the husband and friend will be gratified, because no irregularity of domestic arrangement will disturb the social intercourse. The same observation holds good on a larger scale. In

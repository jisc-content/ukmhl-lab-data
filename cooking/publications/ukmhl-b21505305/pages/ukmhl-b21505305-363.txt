SICK COOKERY. 281 ton, or veal, if there is no butter in the dish. Sprinkle a little salt over. Eggs. An egg broken into a cup of tea, or beaten and mixed with a basin of milk, makes a breakfast more support- ing than tea solely. An egg divided, and the yolk and white beaten sepa- rately, then mixed with a glass of wine, will afford two very wholesome draughts, and prove lighter than when taken together. Eggs very little boiled, or poached, taken in small quantity, convey much nourishment; the yolk only, when dressed should be eaten by invalids. A great Restorative. Bake two calves' feet in two pints of water, and the same quantity of new milk, in ajar close-covered, three hours and a half. When cold remove the fat. Give a large tea-cupful the last and first thing. What- ever flavour is approved, give it by baking in it lemon- peel, cinnamon, or mace. Add sugar after. Another.—Simmer six sheep’s trotters, two blades of mace, a little cinnamon, lemon-peel, a few hartshorn shavings, and a little isinglass, in two quarts of water to one; when cold, take off the fat, and give near half a pint twice a day, warming with it a little new milk. Another.—Boil 1 ounce of isinglass-shavings, forty Jamaica peppers, and a bit of brow'n crust of bread, in a qtiart of water to a pint, and strain it. This makes a pleasant jelly to keep in the house; cf which a large spoonful may be taken in wine and water, milk, tea, soup, or any way. Another, a most pleasant Draught.—Boil a quarter of an ounce of isinglass-shavings with a pint of new milk, to half: add a bit of sugar, and, for change, a bitter almond. Give this at bed-time, not too warm. Dutch flummery, blamange, and jellies, as directed \r\pages \%7, 188, and 196, or less rich according tn judgment.

Various modes of preparing may effect a great deal : and it will be bad or good ofils kind, by being in unskilful bands or the contrary ; but much will still depend on the former circumstance. The same land rarely makes very fine butter, and re- markably fine cbe» se; yet due care may give one pretty good, when the other excells in quality. When one is not as fine as the other, attention and change of method may amend the inl’erior. There is usually, however, too much prejudice in the minds of dairy people, to make them give up an old custom for one newly recommended. This calls for the eyeofthe superior.

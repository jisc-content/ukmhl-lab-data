DOMESTIC COOKEUT. 256 water, and boil till one gallon is wasted ; skim it, take it off the fire, and have ready a dozen and a haliâ€™ of le- mons quartered ; pour a gallon of the liquor boiling hot upon them; put the remainder of the liquor into a tub, with seven pecks of cowslip-pips; let them remain there all night, and then put the liquor and the lemons to eight spoonfuls of new yeast, and a handful of sweet- briar : stir all well together, and let it work three or four days. Strain it, and put into the cask : let it stand six months, and then bottle it for keeping. Imperial. Put two ounces of cream of tartar, and the juice and paring of two lemons, into a stone-jar; put on them seven quarts of boiling water, stir and cover close. When cold, sweeten with loaf-sugar, and straining it, bottle and cork it tight This is a very pleasant liquor, and very wholesome ; but from the latter considera- tion was at one time drank in such quantities, as to become injurious. Add, in bottling, half a pint of rum to the whole quantity. Ratafia. Blanch two ounces of peach and apricot kernels, bruise and put them into a bottle, and fill nearly up with brandy. Dissolve half a pound of white sugar- candy in a cup of cold water, and add to the brandy after it has stood a month on the kernels, and they are strained off; then filter through paper, and bottle for use. The leaves of peach and nectarines, when the trees are cut in the s])ring, being distilled, are an ex- cellent substitute for ratafia in puddings. Raspberrij Brandi/. Pick fine dry fruit, put into a stone jar, and the jar into a kettle of water, or on a hot hearth, till the juice w ill run ; strain, and to every pint add half a pound of sugar, give one boil, and skim it; when cold put equal quantities of juice and brandy, shake well and bottle. Some people prefer it stronger of the brandy.

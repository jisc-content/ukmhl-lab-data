132 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Squab Pie. Cut apples as for other pies, and lay them in rows with mutton-chops : shred onion, and sprinkle it among them, and also some sugar. Lamb Pie. Make it of the loin, neck, or breast; the breast of house-lamb is one of the most delicate things that can he eaten. It should be very liglitly seasoned with pepper and salt; the bone taken out, but not the gristles ; and a small quantity of jelly gravy be put in hot; but the pie should not be cut till cold. Put two spoonfuls of water before baking. Grass lamb makes an excellent pie, and may either be boned or not, but not to bone it is perhaps tlie best. Season with only pepper and salt; put twc spoonfuls of water before baking, and as much gravy 'when it comes from the oven. A'b/e.â€”Meat-pies being fat, it is best to let out the gravy on one side, and put it in again by a funnel, at the centre, and a little may be added. Chicken Pie. Cut up two young fowls; season with w'hite pepper, salt, a little mace, and nutmeg, all in the finest powder; likewise a little Cayenne. Put the chicken, slices of ham, or fresh gammon of bacon, forcemeat-balls, and hard eggs, by turns in layers. If it is to be baked in a dish, put a little water ; but none if in a raised crust. By the time it returns from tlie oven, have ready a gravy of knuckle of veal, or a bit of the scrag with some shank- bones of mutton, seasoned with herbs, onion, mace, and white pepper. If it is to be eaten hot, you may add truflles, morels, mushrooms, &c. but not if to be eaten cold. If it is made in a dish, put as much grav)'as will fill it; but, in raised crust, the gravy must be nicely strained, and then put in cold as jelly. To make the jelly clear, you may give it a boil with the whites of two eggs, after taking away the meat, and then run through a fine lawn sieve.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 266 To make Balter, During summer, skim the milk wlien the sun has not heated the dairy ; at tl'.at season it should stand for butter twenty-lour hours without skimming, and forty- eight in winter. Deposit the cream-pot in a very cold cellar, if your dairy is not more so. If you cannot churn daily change it into scalded fresh pots ; but never omit churning twice a week. If possible, put the churn in a thorough air; and if not a barrel one, set it in a tub of water two feet deep, which will give firmness to the butter. When the butter is come, pour off the butter- milk, and put the butter into a fresh-scalded pan, or tubs which have afterwards been in cold water. Pour water on it, and let it lie to acquire some hardness be- fore you work it; then change the water, and beat it with flat boards so perfectly that not the least taste of the buttermilk remain, and that the w'ater, which must be often changed, shall be quite clear in colour. Then work some salt into it, weigh, and make it into forms; throw them into cold water, in an earthen pan and cover of the queen’s w are. You will then have very nice and cool butter in the hottest weather. It requires more working in hot than in cold weather; but in neither should be left with a particle of buttermilk, or a sour taste, as is sometimes done. To preserve buiter. Take two parts of the best common salt, one part good loaf sugar, and one part saltpetre; beat them rvcll together. To sixteen ounces of butter thoroughly cleansed from the milk, put one ounce of this compo- sition ; w’ork it well, and pot down, when become firm and cold. The butter thus preserved is the better for keeping, and should not be used under a month. This article sliould be kept from the air, and is best in pots of tho best glazed earth, that will liold from ten to pounds, each.

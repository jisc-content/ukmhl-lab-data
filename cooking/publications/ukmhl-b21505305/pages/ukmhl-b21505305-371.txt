SICK COOKERy. 289 It should form the whole of the patient’s drink, and the food should be biscuits and rusks, in every way and sort; ripe and dried fruits, of various kinds, when » decline is apprehended. Baked and dried fruits, raisins in particular, make xcellent suppers for invalids, with biscuits, or com- mon cake. Orgeat. Beat two ounces of almonds with a tea-spoonM of orange-flower water, and a bitter almond or two; then pour a quart of milk and water to the paste. Sweeten •with sugar, or capillaire. This is a fine drink for those ■who have a tender chest; and in the gout it is highly useful, and, with the addition of half an ounce of gum arabic, has been found to allay the painfulness of the at- tendant heat. Half a glass of brandy may be added if thought too cooling in the latter complaints, and the glass of orgeat may be put into a basin of warm water. Another orgeat, for company, is in page 229. Orangeade, or Lemonade. Squeeze the juice ; pour boiling water on a little of the peel, and cover chase. Boil water and sugar to a thin syrup, and skim it. When all are cold, mix the juice, the infusion, and the syrup, with as much more water as will make a rich sherbet; strain through a jelly-bag. Or squeeze the juice, and strain it, and add water and capillaire. Egg Wine. Beat an egg, mix with it a spoonful of cold w’ater ; set on the fire a glass of white wine, halfa glass of w'ater, sugar, and nutmeg. When it boils pour a little of it to the egg by degrees till the whole be in, stirring it well; then return the whole into the sauce-pan, put it on a gentle fire, stir it one way for not more than a minute ; for if it boil, or the egg be stale, it will curdle. Serve with toast. Egg wine may be made as above, without warming the egg, and it is then lighter on the stomach, though not so pleasant to the taste.

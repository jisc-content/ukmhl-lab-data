DOMESTIC COOKERY. 180 English Bamboo. Cut the large young shoots of elder, which put out in the middle of May, (the middle stalks are most tender;) peel off theoutward peel, or skin, and lay them ^ in salt and water verj' strong, one night. Dry them piece by piece in a cloth. Have in readiness a pickle thus made and boiled: to a quart of vinegar put an ounce of white pepper, an ounce of sliced ginger, a lit- tle mace and pimento, and pour boiling on the elder shoots, in a stone jar; stop close, and set by the fire two hours, turning the jar often, to keep it scalding hot. If not geeen when cold, strain off the liquor, and pour boiling hot again; keep it hot as before. Or, if you intend to make Indian pickle, the above shoots are a great improvement to it; in which case you need only pour boiling vinegar and mustard-seed on them ; and keep them till your jar of pickles shall be ready to receive them. The cluster of elder-flowers before it opens, makes a delicious pickle to eat with boiled mut- ton. It is only done by pouring boiling vinegar over. Melon Mangoes. There is a particular sort for this purpose, which thegardeners know. Cuta squaresmall piece out of one side, and through that take out the seeds, and mix with them mustard-seeds and shred garlick; stuff the melon as full as the space will allow, and replace the square piece. Bind it up with a small new pack-thread. Boil a good quantity of vinegar, to allow for wasting, with pepper, salt, ginger, and pour boiling hot over the mangoes four successive days ; the last, put flour of mustard, and scraped horse-radish, into the vinegarjust is it boils up. Stop close. Observe that there is plenty of vinegar. All pickles are spoiled if not well covered. Mangoes should be done soon after they are gathered. Large cucumbers, called green turley, prepared as mangoes, are excellent, and come sooner into eating. Mark, the greater number of times boiling vinegar is poured over either sort, the sooner it will be ready.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. PART /. ' FISH. To choose Fiish I I Tr RBOT, if good, should be thick, and tlie belly of a yellowish white ; if of a bluish cast, or thin, they are bad. They are in season the greatest part of the summer. ■' I >'almon.—If new, the flesh is of a fine red (the gills ! particularly), the scales bright, and the whole fish stiff'. When just killed, there is a whiteness between the flakes, which gives great firmness ; by keeping, this 1 melts down, and the fish is nrore rich. The Thames salmon bears the highest price; that caught in the Se- I vern is next in goodness, and is even preferred by some.. Small heads, and thick in the neck, are best. Cod.—The gills shoidd be very red : the fish should be very thick at the neck, the flesh white and firm, and the eyes fresh. When flabby they are not good. They are in season from the beginning of December till the end of April. Skafe.—If good they al^ very white and thick. If too fresh they eat tough, but must not be kept above two days. Herrings.—If good, their gills are of a fine red and the eyes bright; as is likewise the whole fish, which must be stiff and firm. Soles.—If good they are thick, and the belly is of a cream colour; if this is of a bluish cast and flabby they are not fresh. They are in the market almost the whole year, but are in the !ii; best perfection about Uiidsummer. B

( ) pleasures. To attend to the nursing, and at least early in- struction of children, and rear a healthy progeny in the ways of piety and usefulness : to preside over the family and regulate the income allotted to its maintainance : to make home the sweet refuge of a husband fatigued by in- tercourse with a jarring world : to be his enlightened com- panion and the chosen friend of his heart : these, these, are woman’s duties ! and delightful ones they are, if haply she be married to a man whose soul can duly es- timate her worth, and who will bring his share to the corumon stock of felicity. Of such a woman, one may truly say, “ Happy the man who can call her his wdfe. Blessed are the children w'ho call her mother.” When w'e thus observe her, exercising her activity and best abilities in appropriate cares and increasing ex- cellence, are w’e not ready to say, she is the agent for good of that benevolent Being, w^ho placed her on earth to fulfil such sacred obligations, not to waste the talents committed to her charge. When it is thus evident that the high intellectual at- tainments may find exercise in the multifarious'occupa- tions of the daughter, the wife, the mother, and the mis- tress of the house, can any one urge that the female mind is contracted by domestic employ ? It is however a great comfort that the duties of life are within the reach of humbler abilities, and that she whose chief aim is to fulfil them, will rarely ever fail to acquit herself well. United with, and perhaps crowning all the virtues of the female character, is that well-directed ductility of mind, which occasionally bends its attention to the smaller objects of life, knowing them to be often scarcely less essential than the greater.

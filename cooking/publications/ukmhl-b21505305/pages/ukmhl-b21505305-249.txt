PASTRY. 168* sweet almonds, and stick them thickly over the cake. Royal Paste, called “ Au Choux." This paste is the basis of many sorts of pastry ; it is itsed to mix an infinite number of second course dishes of various forms, and of different denomina- tions. Take a stew-pan large enough to contain four quarts of water, pour half a pint of water into it ■with a quarter of a pound or a little more of fresh butter, two ounces of sugar, a little salt, and the peel of a lemon ; let the whole boil till the butter is entirely melted. Then take some very fine dry flour and shake it through a sieve. Take the lemon-peel out with a ladle, and throw a handful of flour into the preparation while boiling; take care, however, not to put more flour than the liquor can soak up. Stir with a wooden spoon till the paste can easily be detached from the stew-pan and then take it off the fire. Ne.xt break an egg into this paste, and mix it well; then break a second, which also mix ; do not put more eggs than the paste can absorb, but you must be careful not to make this preparation too liquid. It is almost certain, that about five or six eggs will be wanted for the above quantity ; then form them en choux, by which is meant, in the shape of a ball, an inch in circumference. As this paste swells very much, you must dress it accordingly, putting the choux on a baking sheet, at an inch distant from each other, in order that they may undergo a greater effect in the oven. Brush them over as usual with the dorure or egg wash, to which has been added a little milk. Put them into an oven moderately hot, but do not open the oven till they are quite baked, otherwise they would flatten, and all attempts to make them rise again would be useless: next dry them. Sometimes you may glaze them; at other times you may send them up without being glazed.

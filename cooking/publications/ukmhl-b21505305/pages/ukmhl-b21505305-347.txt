265 DAIRY. To a quart of fresh cream put a pint of new milk warm enough to make the cream a proper warmth, a bit of sugar, and a little rennet. Set near the fire till the curd comes ; fill a vat made in the form of a brick, of wheat-straw or rushes sewed together. Have ready a square of straw, or rushes sewed flat, to rest the vat on, and another to cover it; the vat being open at top and bcdtom. Next day take it out, and change it as above, to ripen. A half-pound weight will be sufficient to put on it. Another waij.-—Take a pint of very thick sour cream from the top of the pan for gathering butter, lay a nap- kin on two plates, and pour half into each, let them stand twelve hours, then put them on a fresh wet nap- kin in one plate, and cover with the same ; this do every twelve hours until you find the cheese begins to look dry, then ripen it with nut-leaves ; it will be ready in ten days. Fresh nettles,or two pewter-plates, will ripen cream- cheese very well. Observalioyis respecting Butler. There is no one article of family consumption more in use, of great variety in goodness, or that is of more consequence to have of a superior quality, than this, and the economising of which is more necessary. 'I’ho sweetness of butter is not affected by the cream being turned, of which it is made. When cows are in turnips, or eat cabbages, the taste is very disagreeable; and the following ways have been tried with advantage to ob- viate it:— When the milk is strained into the pans, put toevery six gallons one gallon of boiling water. Or dissolve one once of nitre in a pint of spnr.g-water, and put a quar- ter of a pint to every fifteen gallons of milk. Or, when vou churn, keep back a quarter of a pint of the sour cream, and put it into a well-scalded pot, into which you are to gather the next cream; stir that w'ell, and do so with every fresh addition.

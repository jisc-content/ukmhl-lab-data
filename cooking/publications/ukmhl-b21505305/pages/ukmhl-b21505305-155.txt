P O U L T B Y, GAME, &c, 7b choose Poultry, Game, t^-c. .A Ttcrkey-cock.—If young, it has a smooth black leg, with a short spur. The eyes full and bright, if fresh, and the feet supple and moist. If stale, the eyes will be sunk, and the feet dry. Hen-turkey is known by the same rules; but if old, her legs wdll be red and tough. Fowls.—If a cock is young, his spurs will be short; but take care to see they have not been cut or pared, which is a trick often practised. If fresh, the vent will be close and dark. Pullets are best just before they begin to lay, and yet are full of egg ; if old hens, their combs and legs will be rough ; if young, they will be smooth. A good capon has a thick belly and h'trge rump ; there is a parti cular fat at his breast, and the comb is very pale. Black legged fowdsare most moist, iffor roasting. K

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 308 The mixture.â€”Boil slowly one pound of soft soap in two quarts of water, to one. Of this jelly take three or four spoonfuls, and mix to a consistence with emery, No. 3. To clean Tin Covers, and Patent Pewter Porter Pots. Get the finest whiting, which is only sold in large cakes, the small being mixed with sand : mix a little of it powdered, with the least drop of sweet oil, and rub well, and wipe clean ; then dust some dry whiting in a muslin bag over, and rub bright with dry leather. The last is to prevent rust, which the cook must be careful to guard against by wiping dry, and putting by the fire when they come from the parlour; for if but once hung up without, the steam will rust the inside. To prevent the creaking of a door. Rub a bit of soap on the hinges. A Strong Paste for Paper. To two large spoonfuls of fine flour, put as much pounded rosin as will lie on a shilling; mix with as much strong beer as will make it of a due consistence, and boil half an hour. Let it be cold before it is used. Fine Blacking for Shoes. Take four ounces of ivory-black, three ounces of the coarsest sugar, a table spoonful of sweet oil, and a pint of small beer ; mix them gradually cold.

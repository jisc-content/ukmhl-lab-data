POVJ.TnV-YAKP. 2/0 nnd it is very wrong to pursue tliem, as many ignorant people do, in the idea of hringiug them liome ; for it (udy causes the hen to carry the young ones through dangerous {daces, and by hurrying shetreadsupon them. The cock kills all the young chickens he can get at, bv one blow on the centre of the head with his bill ; and he does the same by his own brood before the feathers of the crown come out. Nature therefore impels the hen to keep them out of his way till the feathers rise. Guinea liens Lay a great number of eggs; and if you can discover the nest, it is best to put them under common hens, which are better nurses. They require great warmth ; quiet; and careful feeding with rice swelled with milk, or bread soaked in it. Put two pepper-corns down their throat when first hatched. Pigeons Bring two young ones at a time; and breed every month, if well looked after, and {)lentifully fed. They should be kept very clean, and the bottom of the dove- cote be strewed with sand once a month at least. Tares and white peas are their pro{)cr food. They should have plenty of fresh water in their house. Starlings and other birds are apt to come among them, and suck the eggs. Vermin likewise are their great enemies, and destroy them. If the breed should be too small, put a few tame pigeons of the common kind, and of their own colour, among them. Observe not to have too large a proportion of cock-birds; for they are quarrel- some, and will soon thin the dove-cote. Pigeons are fond of salt, and it keeps them in health.

Bay-salt and cummin-seeds mixed is an universal re- medy for the diseases of pigeons. The backs and breasts are sometimes scabby; in which case, take a quarter of a pound of bay-salt, and as much common

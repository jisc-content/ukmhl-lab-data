Of the largest green walnut kind, take and cut tlie bud end in four quarters, leaving the stalk end whole; pick out the seeds, and with a strong needle and thread fasten five or si.x together, bv running the thread through the bottoms, till they are of the size of a hop. Lay vine- leaves at the bottom of a tin preserving-pan, cover them with the hops, then a layer of leaves, and so on; lay a good many on the top, then fill the pan with water. Stop it so close down that no steam can get out, set it by a slow fire till scalding hot, then take it olf till cold, and so do till on opening while cold, the gooseberries are of a good green.

If the ho]>s are to be dried, which way they eat best, and look well, they may be set to dry in a week ; but if to be kept wet, make a syrup in the above proportions, adding a slice of ginger in boiling; when skimmed and clear, give the goose- berries one boil, and when cold, pour it over them.

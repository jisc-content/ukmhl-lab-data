Small close Cahbar/es, laid on a stone floor before the frost sets in, will blanch and be very fine, after many weeks keeping. PICKLES, Rules to he observed icilh Pickles. Keep them closely covered ; and have a wooden spoon, with holes, tied to each jar ; all mettle being improper. They should be well kept from the air; the large jars be seldom opened ; and small ones, for the different pickles in use, should be kept for common supply, into which what is not eaten may be returned, and the top closely covered. Acids dissolve the lead that is in the tinning of sauce-pans. When necessary to boil vinegar, do it in a stone jar on the hot hearth. Pickles should never be put into glazed jars, as salt and vinegar penetrate the glaze, which is poisonous. Lemon Pickle. Wipe six lemons, cut each into eight pieces ; put on them a pound of salt, six large cloves of garlick, two ounces of horse-radish sliced thin, likewise of cloves, mace, nutmeg, and Cayenne, a quarter of an ounce each, and two ounces of flour of mustard ; to these put two quarts of vinegar. Boil a quarter of an hour in a w'ell-tinned sauce-pan ; or, which is better, do it in a strong jar, in a kettle of boiling water: or set the jar on the hot hearth till done. Set the jar by, and stir it daily for six weeks ; keep the jar close covered. Put it into small bottles. Indian Pickle. Lay a pound of w'hite ginger in water one night; then scrape, slice, and lay it in salt in a pan till the other ingredients shall be ready. Peel, slice, and salt a pound of garlick three days, then put it in the sun to dry. Salt and dry long pepper in the same way.

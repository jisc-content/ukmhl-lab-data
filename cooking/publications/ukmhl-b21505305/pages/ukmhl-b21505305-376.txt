294 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Hard Pomatum. Prepare equal quantities of beef-marrow and mutton* suet as before, using the brandy to preserve it, and ad- ding the scent; then pour it into moulds, or, if you have none, into phials of the size you choose the rolls to be of. When cold, break the bottles, clear away the glass carefully, and put paper round the rolls. Pomade Divine.

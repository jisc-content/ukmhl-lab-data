Their eggs should be daily taken away except one, till they seem inclined to sit; then leave them,and see that there are enough. They require no attention while sitting, except to give them food at the time they come out to seek it; and there should be water placed at a moderate distance from them, that their eggs may not be spoiled by their long absence in seeking it. Twelve or thirteen eggs are enough ; in an early season it is best to set them under a hen ; and then they can be kept from water till they have a little strength to bear it, which in very cold weather they cannot do so well. They should be kept under cover, especially in a wet season; for though water is the natural element of ducks, yet they are apt to be killed by the cramp before they are covered with fea- thers to defend them. Ducks shouM be accustomed to feed and rest atone place, which would prevent their straggling too far to lay. Places near the water to lay in are advantageous ; and these might be small wooden houses, with a parti- tion in the middle, and a door at each end. They eat any thing; and when to be fattened, must haveplenty, however coarse, and in three weeks they will be I'at. Geese Require little expense; as they chiefly support them- selves on commons or in lanes, where they can get water. The largest are esteemed best, as also are thewliiie and grey. The pied and dark-coloured are not so good. Thirty days is generally the time the goose sits, but in warm weather she will sometimes hatch sooner. Give them plenty of food, such as scalded bran and light oats; and as soon as the goslings are hatched, keep them housed for eight or ten days, and feed them with barley-meal, bran, curds, &c. For green geese, begin to fatten them at six or seven weeks old, and feed them

Haise common boiled crust into either a round or oval form, as you choose; have ready the trimming and small bits of pork cutoff when a hog is killed ; and if these are- not enough, take the meat off a sweet bone. Beat it well with a rolling-pin ; season with pepper and salt, and keep the fat and lean separate. Put it in layers, quite close up to the top : lay on the lid ; cut the edge smooth round, and pincli it; bake in a slow soaking oven, as the meat is very solid. Directions for raising the crust will be given hereafter, dlie pork may be put into a common dish, with a very plain crust; and be quite as good. Observe to put no bone or water into pork pie ; the outside of the pieces will be hard, unless they are cut small and pressed close. Mutton Pie.

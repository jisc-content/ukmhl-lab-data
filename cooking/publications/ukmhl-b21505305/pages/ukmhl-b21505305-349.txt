DAIRY. 2G7 To preserve Butler for Winter, the best teat/. AVhen the butter has been prepared as above directed, take two parts of the best common salt, one part good loaf-sugar, and one part of saltpetre, beaten and blended well together. Of this composition put one ounce to sixteen ounces of butter, and work it well together in a mass. Press it into the pans after the butter is become cool; for friction, though it be not touched by the hands, will soften it. The pans should hold ten or twelve pounds each. On the top put some salt; and when that is turned to brine, if not enough to cover the butter entirely, add some strong salt and water. It requires only then to be covered from the dust. To manage Cream for Whey Butter. Set the whey one day and night, skim it, and so till you have enough; then boil it and pour it into a pan or two of cold water. As the cream rises, skim it till no more comes; then churn it. Where new-milk cheese is made daily, whey-butter for common and i>re- eent use may be made to advantage. To scald Cream, as in the West of England. In winter let the milk stand twenty-four hours, in the summer twelve at least; then put the milk-pan on an. liot hearth, if you have one ; if not, set it in a wide brass, kettle of water, large enough to receive the pan. It must remain on the fire till quite hot, but on no account boil, or there will be a skin instead of a cream upon the milk. You will know when done enough, by the undulations, on the surface looking thick, and having a ring round the pan the size of the bottom. The time required ta scald cream depends on the size of the pan and the heat of the fire; the slower the better. Kemove the pan into the dairy when done, and skim it next day. In cold weather it may stand thirty-six hours, and never less than two meals. The butter is usually made in Devonshire of cream thus prepared, and. if properly it very firm.

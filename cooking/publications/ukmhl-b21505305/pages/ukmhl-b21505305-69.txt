( xxix ) neatly take off the two sidesmen, and the whole will be done. As each part is taken off, it should be turned neatly on the dish : and care should be taken that what is left goes properly from table. The breast and wings are looked upon as the best parts ; but the legs are most juicy, in young fowls. After all, more advantage will be gained by observing those who carve well, and a little practice, than by any written directions whatever. A Pheasant.—The bird in the annexed engraving is as trussed for the spit, with its head under one of its wings. When the skewers are taken out, and the bird served, the following is the way to carve it: Fix your fork in the centre of the breast; slice it down in the lines a, b; take off the leg on one side in the dot- ted line b, d\ then cut off the wing on the same side, in the line c, d. Separate the leg and wing on the other side, and then cut off the slices of breast you divided be- fore. Be careful how you take off the wings; for if you should cut too near the neck as at g, you will hit on the neck-bone, from which the wing must be separated. Cut off the merrythought in the line/, g, bypassing the knife under it towards the neck. Cut the other parts as in a fowl. The breast, wings, and merrythought, are the most esteemed : but the leg has a higher flavour. Partridge.—The partridge is here represented as just taken from the spit; but before it is served up, the skewers must be withdrawn. It is cut up in the same manner as a fowl. The wings must be taken off in the lines a, b^ and the merrythought in the line c, d. The prime parts of a partridge are the wings, breast, and merrythought. But the bird being small, the two latter are not often divided. The wing is considered as the best, and the tip of it reckoned the most delicate morsel of the whole.

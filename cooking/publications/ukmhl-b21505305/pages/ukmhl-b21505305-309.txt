227 PRESERVES. taste by a little roughness; if there be too much it will spoil the fruit. Put as many gooseberries into a large sieve as will lie at the bottom without covering one ano- ther. Hold the sieve in the water till the fruit begins to look scalded on the outside ; then turn them gently out of the sieve on a cloth on the dresser, cover them with another cloth, and put some more to be scalded, and so on tillall be finished. Observe not to put one quantity on another, or they will become too soft. The next day pick out any bail or broken ones, bottle the rest, and fill up the bottles with the alum-water in which they were scalded ; which must be kept in the bottles; for if left in the kettle, or in a glazed pan, it will spoil. Stop them close. The water must boil all the time the process is carry- ing on. Gooseberries done this way make as fine tarts as fresh off the trees. Another way.—In dry weather pick the gooseberries that are full grown, but notripe; top and tail them, and put into open-mouthed bottles; gently cork them with new velvet corks; put them in the oven when the bread is dravvn, and let them stand til! shrunk a quarter part ; take them out of the oven, and immediately beat the corks in tight, cut oft the tops, and rosin down close; set them in a dry place; and if well secured from air they will keep the year round. If gathered in the damp, or the gooseberries’ skins are the least cut in taking off the stalks and buds, they will mould. 'I'he hairy sort only must be used for keep- ing, and do tliem before the seeds become large. Currants and damsons may be done the same. To keep Damsons for winter Pies. Put them in small stonejars, or wide-mouthed bottles; set them up to their necks in a boiler of cold water, and lighting a fire under, scald them. Next day, when per- fectly cold, fill up with spring water; cover them. Another way.—Boil one third as much sugar as fruit with it,over a slow fire, till the juiceadheres to the fruit,

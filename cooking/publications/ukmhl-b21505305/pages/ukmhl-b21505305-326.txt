DOMLSTIC COOKtUT. 24-} The Reverend Mr. Ilagget's economical Bread. Only the coarse flake-bran is to be removed from the floui ; of this take five pounds, and boil it in rather more than four gallons of water; so that when perfectly smooth, you may have three gallons and three quarts of bran-water clear. With this knead fifty-six pounds of the flour, adding salt and yeast in the same way and proportions as for other bread. When ready to bake, divide it into loaves, and bake them two hours and a half. Thus made, flour will imbibe three quarts more of bran-water than of plain; so that it not only produces a more nutritious substantial food, but makes an increase of one-fifth of the usual quantity of bread, which is a saving of one dayâ€™s consumption out of six ; and if this was adopted throughout the kingdom, it would make a aving of ten millions sterling a year, when wheat was at he price it stood in the scarcity, reckoning the con- sumption to be 2 hundred thousand bushels a day. The same quantity of flour which, kneaded with water, produces sixty-nine pounds eightounces of bread, will, in the above way, make eighty-three pounds eight ounces, and gain fourteen pounds. At the ordinary price of flour four millions would be saved. When ten days old, if put into the oven for twenty minutes, this bread will appear quite new again. Rice-and-Wheat Bread. Simmer a pound of rice in two quarts df water till it becomes perfectly sofc; when it is of a proper warmth, mix it extremely well with four pounds of flour, and yeast and salt as for other bread; of yeast about four large spoonful; knead it extremely well; then set it to rise before the fire. Some of the flour should be re- served to make up the loaves. The whole expense, in- cluding baking, will not exceeed three shillings, for which eight pounds and a half of exceeding good bread will be produced. If the rice should require more water, it must be added, as some rice swells more than others.

( xviii ) Many good laundresses advise soaping linen in warm water the night previous to washing, as facilitating the operation wdth less friction. Soap should be cut with a wire or twine, in pieces that will make a long square when fisrt brought in, and kept out of the air two or three weeKs; for if it dry quick, it will crack, and when wet, break. Put it on a shelf, leaving a space between, and let it grow hard gradually. Thus, it will save a full third in the consumption. Some of the lemons and oranges used for juice should be pared first to preserve the peel dry ; some should be halved, and when squeezed, the pulp cut out, and the outsides dried for grating. If for boiling in any liquid, the first way is best. When these fruits are cheap, a pro- per quantity should be bought and prepared as above di- rected, especially by those who live in the country, where they cannot always be had; and they are perpe- tually wanted in cookery. When whites of eggs are used for jelly, or other pur- poses, contrive to have pudding, custard, &c. to employ the yolks also. Should you not want them for several hours, beat them up with a little water, and put them in a cool place, or they will be hardened and useless. It was a mistake of old, to think that the whites made cakes and puddings heavy; on the contrary, if beaten long and icparately, they contribute greatly to give lightness, are an advantage to paste, and make a pretty dish beaten with fruit, to set in cream, &c. If copper utensils be used in the kitchen, the cook should be charged to be very careful not to let the tin be rubbed off; and to have them fresh done when the least detect, appears, and never to put by any soup, gravy,

DOMESTIC COOEERT, f Whitings.—The firmness of the body and fins is to be looked to, as in herrings ; their high season is during the first three months of the year, but they may be had a great part of it. Mackerel.—Choose as whitings. Their season is May, June, and July. They are so tender a fish that they carry and keep worse than any other. Pike.—For freshness observe the above marks. The best are taken in rivers : they are a very dry fish, and are much indebted to stuffing and sauce. Carp live some time out of water, and may therefore get wasted ; it is best to kill them as soon as caught, to prevent this. The same signs of freshness attend them as other fish 'Pencil.—They are a fine-flavoured fresh-w'ater fish, and should be killed and dressed as soon as caught.— When they are to be bought, examine whether the gills are red and hard to open, the eyes bright, and the body stiff'. The tench has a slimy matter about it, the clear- ness and brightness of which shew freshness. The sea- son is July, August, and September. Perch.—Take the general rules given to distinguish the freshness of other fish. They are not so delicate as carp and tench. Smelts, if good, have a fine silvery hue, are very firm, and have a rel'reshing smell like cucumbers newly cut. —They are caught in the Thames and some other large rivers. Mullets.—The sea are preferred to the river mullets, and the red to the grey. They should be very firm. —Their season is August. Gudgeons.—They are chosen by the same rules as other fish. They are taken in running streams ; come in about midsummer, and are to be had for five or si.x months. Eels.—There is a greater difference in the goodness of eels than of any other fish. The true silver-eel (so called from the bright colour of the belly) is caught in the Thames. The Dutch eels sold at Billi:igsgate are very bad; those taken in great floods are generally

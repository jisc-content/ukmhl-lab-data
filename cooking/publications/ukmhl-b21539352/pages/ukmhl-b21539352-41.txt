SAVOURIES AND SWEETS. 25 cooked; it must not be brown. Turn the contents into a mortar, pound until the meat is fine, then rub through a hair sieve. The vegetables are merely to give the liver a nice flavour, so need not be pounded or passed through a sieve. Marrow Toasts. For Four Persons.—2 marrow bones; 1 teaspoonful of minced parsley; a few drops of lemon juice; 5 squares of fried bread or toast. ' Boil two marrow bones, and when they are suffi- ciently cooked, take out the marrow and place on small squares of hot buttered toast; sprinkle chopped parsley and a squeeze of lemon juice on each. Serve very hot. Egg and Ham Toasts. For Four Persons.—5 rounds of fried bread; 2 ozs. o. ham; x gill of cream; 5 eggs; 1 spoonful of chopped parsley; 1 teaspoonful of lemon juice. Fry some rounds of bread sufficiently large to hold a poached egg. Before frying, mark them lightly with a cutter about an inch from the edge all the way round. The bread must be an inch in thickness. When fried, run a knife round the mark and take out the middle; care must be taken so as to leave about half an inch thickness at the bottom. Fill up the space with finely chopped ham moistened with cream; add chopped parsley, a little lemon juice and cayenne. Place a poached egg on the top of the mixture and serve very hot.

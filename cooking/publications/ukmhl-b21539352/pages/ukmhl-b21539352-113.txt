SAVOURIES AND SWEETS. 97 Take six penny sponge cakes and lay them in a large glass dish; cover them with ratafias and maca- roons ; pour over the whole half a tumbler of brandy and sherry mixed, sufficient to moisten the cakes, but not enough to run out. When the mixed wine and brandy is quite absorbed, stick the cakes with blanched almonds cut lengthways, cover between the almonds with apricot jam put on thickly. Sweeten the juice of one lemon, and pour over the jam. The day before it is required to be used, whip a pint of good cream which has been warmed, having pre- viously stirred into it a wineglassful of sherry and one of brandy, the juice of one lemon, and six lumps of sugar on which the rind of the lemon has been rubbed. Whisk the whites of two eggs to a stiff froth, and lightly mix it with a fork into the cream mixture. Whisk until the whole is frothed; set it on a sieve in a cool place until the next day. It will take between one and two hours to whip the cream. Cover the soaked cakes with the cream, piled as high as possible; ornament with flowers. Stone Cream.

PREFACE. Emboldened by the kindly reception given by the public to “ Breakfast Dishes,” and the flattering notice of the Press, I have ventured to bring out “ Savouries and Sweets,” trusting that it will be as favourably received as its predecessor. The -first part of the book will be found to contain a large number of receipts for those piquant little dishes that are now so universally served at dinners be- tween “ the sweets ” and “ the dessert,” including a great many savoury omelettes and fondus. The second part consists of a varied collection of receipts,- both old and new, for puddings, tarts, fritters, pancakes, jellies, custards, creams, souffles, syllabubs, junkets, and sweet omelettes, which I can confidently recommend as delicious and easy of preparation. I must here express my indebtedness to E. J. B. for her practical help, which has been of the greatest service to me in the compilation of this little book. M. L. A.

415 CHEERFULNESS IN A WIFE A cheerful temper—not occasionally, but habitu- ally cheerful—is a quality which no wise man would be willing to dispense with in choosing a wife. It is like a good fire in winter, diffusive and genial in its influence, and always approached with a confidence that it will comfort and do good. Atten- tion to health is one great means of maintaining this excellence unimpaired, and attention to household affairs is another. The state of body which women call bilious is most inimical to habitual cheerfulness ; and that which girls call having nothing to do, but which I should call idleness, is equally so. I have always strongly recommended exercise as the first rule for preserving health; but there is an exercise in domestic usefulness which, without superseding that in the open air, is highly beneficial to the health of both mind and body, inasmuch as it adds to other benefits the happiest of all sensations, that of having rendered some assistance or done some good. Let me entreat my young readers, if they feel a tendency to causeless melancholy, if they are afflicted with cold feet and headache, but above all, with impatience and irritability, so that they can scarcely make a pleasant reply when spoken to,— let me entreat them to make a trial of the system I am recommending—not simply to run into the kitchen and trifle with the servants, but to set about doing something that will add to the general comfort of the family, and that will, at the same time, relieve some members of the family of a portion of daily toil. I fear it is a very unromantic con- clusion to come to, but my firm conviction is, that half the miseries of young women, and half their ill tempers might be avoided by habits of domestic activity. mrs. ellis

THE DUDLEY RECIPES 178 COLD RAISED HARE PIE /^iLEAR the fillets, the minion fillets and the ^ legs of all tendons ; moderately lard them and season ; set them in a dish with an equal quantity of truffles and fat bacon strips. Sprinkle with some brandy and leave to marinade for one hour. With what remains of the meat take some fillets of veal and pork in the proportion of six ounces to one pound of hare, fresh fat bacon in the proportion of one and a half pounds to one pound of hare ; add spiced salt and prepare a forcemeat finished with one egg and three tablespoonfuls of brandy per one pound of forcemeat. Rub through a tammy and add a portion of the hare’s blood. Line an oval or round buttered mould with raised pie paste and completely cover the paste with slices of bacon ; then coat the inside with force- meat and fill up the mould with alternate layers of forcemeat, hare’s fillets, truffle and bacon-strips. Finish with a layer of forcemeat ; cover with a slice of bacon ; sprinkle over a pinch of powdered thyme and bay leaf ; close the pie with a layer of paste, which should be sealed down round the moistened edges. Pinch the crust inside and out, and finish off the pie by means of imitation leaves made from paste. Bake in a moderate oven and when the pie is almost cold pour some jelly, flavoured with hare essence, into it.

While hot, lay the mixture on the greased parts, allowing it to remain on them from ten to twelve hours, after which it may be scoured off with sand and water. A floor much spotted with grease should be completely washed over with this mixture the day before it is scoured. Fuller’s earth and ox-gall boiled together form a very powerful cleansing mixture for floors or carpets. Stains of ink on floors are removed by the application of strong vinegar or salts of lemon.

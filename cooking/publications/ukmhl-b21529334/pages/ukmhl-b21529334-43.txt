30 SOUPS c 5 SPLIT PEA SOUP AN EXCELLENT RECIPE A CCORDING to quantity required, so you vary the amount of split peas. If you have stock at hand, use that; if not, water will do, but of course the stock improves the soup. Put the split peas on in cold water, throw in onions, carrots, turnips, celery and parsley—small quantity, as too much will spoil it—also green mint if obtain- able, if not dried mint will do. Add a ham bone or ham trimmings, or bacon, or a little salt pork.

Care must be exercised in the use of curry powder and sugar. I cannot give you the exact quantities ; practical knowledge teaches this, and it is according to the quantity of soup required.

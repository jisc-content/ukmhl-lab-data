417 CHEERFULNESS-A LIFE INSPIRATION Be cheerful, no matter what reverse obstruct your pathway, or what plagues follow in your trail to annoy you. Ask yourself what is to be gained by looking or feeling sad when troubles throng around you, or how your condition is to be alleviated by abandoning yourself to despondency ? If you are a young man, nature designed you “to be of good cheer ” ; and should you find your road to fortune, fame, or respectability, or any other boon to which your heart aspires, a little thorny, consider it all for the best, and that these impediments are only thrown in your way to induce greater efforts and more patient endurance on your part. Far better spend a whole life in diligent, aye, cheerful and un- remitting toil, though you never attain the pinnacle of your ambitious desires, than to turn back at the first appearance of misfortune, and allow despair to unnerve your energies, or sour your naturally sweet and cheerful disposition. If you are of the softer, fairer, portion of humanity, be cheerful, though we know full well that most afflictions are sweet to you when compared with disappointment and neglect ; yet let hope banish despair and ill- forebodings. Be cheerful; do not brood over fond hopes unrealised, until a chain, link after link, is fastened on each thought, and wound around the heart. Nature intended you to be the fountain- spring of cheerfulness and social life, and not the travelling monument of despair and melancholy. HELPS

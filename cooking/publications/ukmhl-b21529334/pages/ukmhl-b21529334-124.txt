THE DUDLEY RECIPES 84 put in the rabbit. Let each piece become of a nice brown colour; season with salt and pepper; sprinkle in the flour ; let it get nicely brown, and moisten with the stock ; add the wine and bouquet garni. Let it come slowly to a boil; skim ; put in the onions, and let the whole simmer very gently for about an hour and a quarter. The saute pan should be kept well covered when once the con- tents commence to simmer, so as to prevent as much as possible the steam from escaping. About ten minutes before the above-stated time put in the liver, well washed, and cut into four. Before dishing up, take out the pieces of rabbit, onion and liver, and put in another saute pan ; add the bacon. Take off the fat from the sauce and strain over the rabbit. Place a round piece of toasted bread in the centre of a dish ; dress the pieces of rabbit neatly on it, and put the garnish over and round it. Boil up the sauce, and pour over the meat. â– S CROQUETTES OF WILD RABBIT rriAKE a cooked rabbit, minced and prepared into a salpicon with thick Bechamel sauce ; shape into croquettes (cork or cutlet shapes);

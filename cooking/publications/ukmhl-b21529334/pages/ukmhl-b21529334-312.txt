THE DUDLEY RECIPES 268 ORANGE PUDDING ^V/fTX half a pint of strained orange juice with half a wineglassful of brandy and half a liqueur glassful of rum, the yolks of two eggs and two ounces of sifted sugar. Crumble into this three very stale penny sponge-cakes and the same number of macaroons. Pour the mixture into a buttered and papered mould, and bake in rather a quick oven. Or else, pour into a deep piedish and cover with rich puff paste, and bake and serve writh whipped or Devonshire cream. BANANA FRITTERS OELECT some nice bananas, peel them and split ^ them lengthways, and trim off the ends. Put into a deep piedish, and sprinkle over them a glass of Kirschwasser. Prepare a frying batter, dip the bananas into this, then drop them into very hot clarified butter or lard. Fry them a nice colour, drain on paper or sieve ; dredge with castor sugar, dish up, and serve hot. If liked, a little ground cinnamon can be mixed with the castor powdering sugar.

THE DUDLEY RECIPES 20 COLD CONSOMME /^|NE pound of knuckle of veal, two pounds of shin of beef (no bone), one soup fowl, three pounds of lean topside of beef, one carrot, one stick of celery, two leeks, one onion, a little parsley, eight peppercorns, and two cloves. Place the veal and shin of beef and soup fowl in a stock-pot with sufficient cold water to cover the meat. When it comes to the boil, skim off the sedi- ment as it rises; then add the vegetables, and let all boil very gently for six hours ; strain through a soup-cloth. The next day clear the liquid. Pass the meat (including the lean topside) through a mincer ; place it in a bowl, and mix with it a quart of cold water. Put the stock on to warm, free from all grease ; then put into the stock the chopped meat, and mix well together, stirring over the fire until it boils ; then draw to the side of stove, and let it simmer gently to clear for one hour ; strain, and season to taste. This must not be allowed to set in a jelly, as it should be served in a liquid form, but cold. The above is for a very small quantity of consomme. %

A bottle of cold tea without either milk or sugar is, according to Mr. Colqulioun, of “ The Moor and the Loch” the best thirst assuager a sportsman can carry out with him. % 'Tis a little thing To give a cup of water ; yet its draught Of cool refreshment, drained by fevered lips, May give a shock of pleasure to the frame More exquisite than when nectarean juice Renews the life of joy in happiest hours. TALFOURD, “ ION,” I, ii % Wine, Wine, thy power and praise Have ever been echo'd in minstrel lays ; But water, I deem, hath a mightier claim To fill up a niche in the Temple of Fame. Traverse the desert, and then ye can tell What treasures exist in the cold deep well ; Sink in despair on the red parch'd earth, And then ye may reckon what water's worth. 9Tis mighty easy o'er a glass of wine On vain refinements vainly to refine. To laugh at poverty in plenty's reign, To boast of apathy when out of pain. CHURCHILL

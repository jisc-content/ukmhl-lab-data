MISCELLANEOUS 401 TO PRESERVE STEEL GOODS FROM RUST AFTER bright grates have been thoroughly cleaned, they should be dusted over with un- slacked lime, and thus left until wanted for use. Coils of piano wires, thus sprinkled, will keep from rust for many years. Table knives which are not in constant use ought to be put in a case in which sifted quicklime is placed about eight inches deep. They should be plunged to the top of the blades, but the lime must not touch the handles. TO REMOVE OIL OR GREASE FROM HEARTH OIL or grease may be removed from a hearth by covering immediately with hot ashes, or with burning coals. FOR CLEANING BRASSES ON MAHOGANY FURNITURE FT SE either powdered whitening or scraped rotten- stone, mixed with sweet oil, and rubbed on with chamois leather.

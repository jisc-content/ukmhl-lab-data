When thick, add a tablespoonful of thin glaze, and place it in the bottom of a casserole dish. Have ready some strips of bacon and potatoes fried. Sprinkle some more sauce in with a layer of bacon and potatoes and then the rest of the chicken, and serve. % BLANQUETTE OF CHICKEN MAKE a very light souffle of chicken. Butter rather a deep border mould, and place the souffle mixture in it and steam gently. When ready, turn it out into the dish in which it is to be served. Mix some small fillets of chicken, mush- rooms, slices of truffle and quenelles in a good white sauce, and place in the centre of dish, and arrange round the dish some small cooked green cucum- bers.

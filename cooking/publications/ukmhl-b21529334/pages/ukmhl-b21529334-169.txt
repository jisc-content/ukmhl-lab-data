HOT MEAT DISHES 127 NECK OF LAMB A LA BOULANGERE FRY the neck of lamb with butter in an earthen- ware dish, cooking it all but a third, and surround it with four large sliced onions just tossed in butter that they may colour slightly, also eight large peeled potatoes cut into rounds half an inch thick. Sprinkle this garnish with the grease of the joint and then complete the cooking of the joint and its garnish. Serve in the dish in which the joint has been cooked. Shoulder or leg of lamb can also be cooked a la Boulangere, the quantity of onions and potatoes used should be in quantities in proportion to the size of the joint. BEEFSTEAK WITH HERBS PLACE the steak over a hot fire, without adding any salt. Turn it over once and cook for twenty to twenty-five minutes, according to thick- ness. When done, add a little butter, some finely minced parsley, a pinch of salt and pepper, and a few drops of vinegar or lemon juice. Garnish with watercress or fried potatoes.

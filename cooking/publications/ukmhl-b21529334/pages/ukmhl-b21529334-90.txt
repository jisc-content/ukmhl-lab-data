THE DUDLEY RECIPES 52 up into eighteen small quenelles and place on one side. For the Salmon Matelote : Take two to three pounds of salmon cut into half-inch slices, two ounces of butter, twro dessertspoonfuls of finely chopped herbs (parsley, chervil, tarragon and chives), the juice of one lemon, one glass of Chablis or Sauterne, three truffles, eighteen small mush- rooms, fresh or preserved, twelve small braised onions, half a pint of rich Espagnol sauce, one ounce of meat glaze, the eighteen fish quenelles, and seasoning. Wipe and pare the slices of salmon, melt the butter in a large saute pan ; place in the salmon ; sprinkle over with the chopped herbs ; season with pepper and salt; add the lemon juice and wine, and cover with buttered paper. Cook in a fairly hot oven for ten minutes, basting the fish con- stantly. Poach the quenelles of fish ; drain them and put them into a saucepan. Cut into small slices the truffles and mushrooms, toss them in a little butter, and add them to the quenelles ; also the meat glaze, and warm up to boiling-point. Take up the fish and lay it neatly on a hot dish. Strain the liquor from the fish into the sauce ; boil up and skim, and pour over the fish. Garnish nicely with the braised onions, truffles, etc., and serve hot. %

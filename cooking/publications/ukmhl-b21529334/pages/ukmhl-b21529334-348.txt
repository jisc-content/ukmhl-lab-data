VENISON One cut from vert son to the heart can speak Stronger than ten quotations from the Greek ; One fat sirloin possesses more sublime Than all the airy castles built by rhyme. PETER PINDAR % Thanks, my Lord, for your venison, for finer or fatter Ne'er ranges in a forest, or smoked in a platter ; The haunch was a picture for painters to study, The fat was so white, and the lean was so ruddy. 9 GOLDSMITH He that strikes The venison first shall be lord o' the feast. SHAKESPEARE HUNGER Famish'd people must be slowly nurs't. Or fed by spoonsful else they always burst. BYRON, “ DON JUAN,” 2, XV, viii Dire was the clang of plates, of knife and fork. The mere'less fell like tomahawks to work. PETER PINDAR

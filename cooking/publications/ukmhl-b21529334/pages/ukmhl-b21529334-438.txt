THE DUDLEY RECIPES 390 HOW TO BOTTLE MUSHROOMS rriAKE one to two pounds of very small button mushrooms, rub them with a dry cloth, trim off the stalks and peel them ; then put them in a basin and sprinkle over with plenty of fine salt (large button or cup mushrooms are treated in a similar manner, but the red portion and the stalks should be removed). Those mushrooms which are black round the stalks are unsuitable for preserv- ing in bottles. Pour sufficient white wine vinegar, well diluted, over the mushrooms, and bring them slowly to the boil. Shake them while in the pan ; pour off the liquid and drain the mushrooms on sieves or a cloth ; boil them a second time with a fresh lot of diluted vinegar. As soon as boiling point is reached, remove the pan from the fire and bottle when cool with enough vinegar to keep the mush- rooms covered. Cork and seal. Another way to bottle button mushrooms is to use salt water and lemon juice, proceeding as above. The bottles, as soon as corked, must then be wrapped round with straw and steamed or boiled from two to three hours, according to size of bottles. This is a more tedious process than the former, but the mushrooms will be found to have more flavour.

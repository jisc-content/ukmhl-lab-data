THE DUDLEY RECIPES 318 VENISON CONSOMME FT1AKE six or seven pounds of the knuckle-end of a haunch of venison, three pounds of knuckle of veal and one soup fowl. Place the meat in a stockpot. Cover it with cold water. Let this come to the boil. Skim off the sediment which rises, then add two leeks, two carrots, two onions, a bunch of parsley and a little salt. Let boil gently for six or seven hours, strain, and, when cold, remove all fat and place again on fire in a large pan. When lukewarm, add four pounds of the gravy part of a haunch, which has been passed through a mincing machine and mixed with one quart of water. Add to this, one carrot, two leeks, a little parsley and celery cut into small pieces. Place on fire and allow it to boil, stirring all the time. When it boils, draw to side of stove and allow it to simmer gently. Roast the fowl and place it in the pot. Let all cook for five or six hours, then strain through a soup-cloth, which has been wrung through hot water to remove all taint of soap. Take care that the consomme is clear and bright. Some very small quenelles of venison should be served in the consomme. %

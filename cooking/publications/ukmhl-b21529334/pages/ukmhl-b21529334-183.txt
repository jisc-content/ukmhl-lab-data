HOT MEAT DISHES 141 FRICANDEAU OF VEAL FTIAKE a piece cut from the cushion of veal, cut with the grain of the meat. It should not be thicker than one and a half inches. After beating it with the flat of a chopper or a cutlet-bat, to break the fibres of the meat, lard it finely on the cut side with strips of bacon ; braize it and glaze it with its own gravy reduced ; dish it up with a garniture of veal quenelles, slices of sweetbread, mushrooms and truffles, and serve with the following “ Sauce Madere.” A cushion of veal is taken from the haunch. The fat lying over the cushion should be carefully preserved. ■a SAUCE MADERE REDUCE three-quarters of a pint of sauce Espagnol with one and a half gills of good gravy (strained and freed from fat); allow to simmer for fifteen minutes ; season with a pinch of pepper and add one large wineglass of sherry or Marsala ; reduce a little longer and finish with a meat glaze. r«

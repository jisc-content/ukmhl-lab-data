THE DUDLEY RECIPES 314 DEER’S LIVER /~^UT the deer’s liver in slices, dip each piece in ^ flour, dust with salt and pepper and fry in clear butter until it is a golden brown. If used for breakfast, lightly mask it with demi-glaze. If for lunch, serve with a good brown sauce poured over it, to which is added a squeeze of lemon juice and a little chopped parsley. Some pieces of fried bacon can be served with the liver. DEER’S PUDDINGS r 11AKE some deer’s sausage skins and wash in water in which is a very little salt, turning the skins inside out to be thoroughly cleansed, but not removing the fat which adheres to the insides of the skins. Take a large cupful of finely chopped venison or beef suet, a handful of coarse oatmeal and a little finely chopped onion to season, also salt and pepper. Fill the skins, tie the ends and prick well with a needle to prevent bursting. Boil for three-quarters of an hour and then brown in a saute pan with some hot fat, or grill for fifteen minutes, and serve very hot. This recipe was included in the “ Dudley Cookery Book,” published by Mr. Arnold in 1910.

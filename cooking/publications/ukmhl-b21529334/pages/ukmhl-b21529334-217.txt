He was a kind and thankful toad, whose heart dilated in proportion as his skin was filled with good cheer ; and whose spirits rose with eating as some men's do with drink. He could not help, too, rolling his large eyes round him as he ate, and chuckling with the possibility that he might one day be lord of all this scene of unimaginable luxury. WASHINGTON IRVING I Honours a thing too subtle for his wisdom ; If honour be in eating, he's right honourable. BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER He hath never fed of the dainties that are bred in a book ; he hath not eat paper, as it were ; he hath not drunk ink. SHAKESPEARE, “ LOVE’S LABOUR LOST,” IV, ii r«# CHRISTMAS Lo ! now is come our joyful'st feast ! Let every man be jolly. Each room with ivy leaves is drest, And every post with holly. Now all our neighbours' chimneys smoke And Christmas blocks are burning, Their ovens they with bak'd meats choke And all their spits are turning. WITHER, 4c CHRISTMAS CAROL”

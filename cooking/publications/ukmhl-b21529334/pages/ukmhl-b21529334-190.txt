THE DUDLEY RECIPES 148 A SAVOURY HOT-UP mAKE a few slices of cold meat—beef, mutton J- or pork—and sprinkle well with finely chopped onion and pepper. Add a little pepper and salt, and fry in butter or dripping. Serve hot. This is a very savoury dish, and quickly cooked. A FRENCH FAMILY DISH PLACE in cold water, without salt, two pounds or three pounds of bacon, salt pork or mutton. Add a sausage or two, cut into pieces. When these boil, add a few potatoes, a cabbage, a carrot or two, and any green vegetable in season—such as French beans, peas or Brussels sprouts. Boil gently and let simmer for four hours, and serve. What meat is left over can be eaten cold next day, and what vegetables remain can be mixed together with a little butter or dripping and fried in the shape of a thick pancake.

The camomiles should be German camomiles, and can be procured at Roberts, French chemist, in Bond Street, or any good chemist. English camomiles are large and very bitter, and should not be used for this. The camomiles should be prepared like ordinary teaâ€”by infusion in boiling water, then served in a tea or coffee pot or silver jug, very hot, after having been strained through muslin or a strainer.

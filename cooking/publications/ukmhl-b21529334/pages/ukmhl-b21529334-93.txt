FISH DISHES 55 AN AMERICAN FISH PIE HALF a pound of cooked turbot, cod or had- dock, three-quarters of a pound of mashed potatoes, two ounces of butter, half a pint of white Bechamel sauce, two ounces of grated Parmesan cheese, one whole egg, the yolks of two eggs, pepper, salt and a pinch of nutmeg. Break up the fish into flakes, removing the skin and bones ; put into a stewpan with half an ounce of butter ; stir a little over the fire, and add half the sauce and half the cheese ; season to taste, and heat up. Heat the potato puree with an ounce of butter and a little thick cream ; stir well ; season to taste, and bind with the yolks of the two eggs. Line a well-buttered pie-dish with a layer of the prepared potatoes about half an inch thick ; put in a layer of sauce; then the prepared fish ; cover with another layer of the sauce, and lastly cover all with more potato puree. Smooth the surface ; brush over with beaten egg ; sprinkle with grated Par- mesan and a sprinkle of cayenne. Mark the top neatly with the point of a knife. Place the dish in a pan containing a little water, and bake in a quick oven for twenty minutes, until the pie is thoroughly hot and the top a nice rich brown colour.

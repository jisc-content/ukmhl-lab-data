SAUCES 245 ounce of sugar, a pinch of pepper, five pounds of raw tomatoes (or two quarts mashed) and one quart of white stock. Fry the pork with the butter in a deep, thick- bottomed saucepan. When the pork is nearly melted, add the carrots, onions and aromatics ; cook and stir the vegetables ; then add the flour, which should be allowed to cook until it begins to brown ; then add the tomatoes and white stock. Mix all well, and set to boil on an open fire. Add the seasoning, and a crushed clove of garlic ; cover the saucepan and place in a moderate oven where it may cook for one and a half hours. Then pass the sauce through a tammy, and it should boil whilst being stirred. Finally, pour it into a sauce tureen and butter its surface to prevent the formation of a skin. When the puree of tomato is required to add to another sauce, it should be prepared in exactly the same way, only omitting the flour and using only half the quantity of stock.

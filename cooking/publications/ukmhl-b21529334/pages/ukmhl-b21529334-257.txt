VEGETABLES AND SALADS 215 SOUFFLE OF ASPARAGUS TAKE about thirty good heads of fresh green asparagus, wash and pick the green tender part only. Boil until tender in water to which a little salt has been added; drain well, and when cold pass through a fine wire sieve, and place on one side. Put into a saucepan a small pat of butter, and when melted, work in a large teaspoonful of flour ; when smooth, add a little milk sufficient to make a creamy sauce and boil. Mix well with this the puree of asparagus, stirring it over the fire. Season with pepper and salt, then place the mixture in a basin to cool. Whisk one gill of cream lightly until rather stiff, the whites of two eggs very stiff. Mix this in very lightly with the puree mixture, place in a souffle case and freeze for two hours. Place some green asparagus cut into lengths of about three inches on the top in small bunches, and serve.

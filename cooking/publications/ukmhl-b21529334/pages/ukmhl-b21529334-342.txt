THE DUDLEY RECIPES 298 MACARONI A LA CAPRICE TWO ounces of macaroni, the pulp of two large tomatoes, one ounce of grated Parmesan cheese, a little anchovy essence, salt and cayenne, and one pint of white or Bechamel sauce. Boil the macaroni until tender and chop up roughly ; then add the pulps of tomatoes, white sauce and cheese, and flavour with the anchovy essence. Stir all together, and pour into a fire- proof dish. Keep back a little of the sauce, and add a small quantity of the grated Parmesan cheese to it. Pour this over the top of the mixture in the dish, and bake until very hot. The top can be browned with a salamander, if required. MACARONI CHEESE mHIS is a cheap, nutritious and easily cooked J- dish. Boil (say) half a pound of macaroni— the straight not the curled kind—for an hour in plenty of water ; strain thoroughly. Add a small piece of butter, and return to the pan for a minute. Remove, and sprinkle on the surface about half a teacupful of grated cheese. Serve very hot.

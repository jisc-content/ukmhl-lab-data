TO “ POELER ” POULTRY, GAME, Etc. rTlHE following method is adopted :— Take a deep frying-pan, or fireproof earthen pan, and lay in it a bed of vegetables, bacon, etc. (a mirepoix), seasoning, bouquet, etc. Upon this lay the poultry or game. The bird should be trussed and prepared as for an entree, the breast covered with slices of fat bacon. It should be well mois- tened with stock, then placed upon burning embers or hot coals, and its contents gently cooked until tender. Only a little liquid should be used, but frequent basting is necessary, and the liquid must be replenished as it reduces, so that the same quantity always remains.

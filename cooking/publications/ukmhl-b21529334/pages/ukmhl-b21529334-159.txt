55 HOT MEAT DISHES 117 MUTTON CUTLETS REFORM TRIM six mutton cutlets, taking two cutlets to one bone ; flatten with cutlet bat ; dip them in melted butter and roll them in breadcrumbs combined with very finely chopped ham, in the proportion of a third of the weight of the bread- crumbs ; then cook them gently in clarified butter. Dish them lengthways on a hot dish and send the following sauce to table with them in a sauce- boat. Take a small saucepan and mix therein three tablespoonfuls of half-glaze and the same quantity of Poivrade sauce and one small teaspoonful of red-currant jelly ; add one small teaspoonful of each of the following garnishes, cut into short julienne, to the sauce, some hard-boiled white of egg, some very red smoked tongue, gherkins, truffles and mushrooms. The garnish, with some of the sauce, should be served in the dish with the cutlets ; the remainder of the sauce served separately in a boat.

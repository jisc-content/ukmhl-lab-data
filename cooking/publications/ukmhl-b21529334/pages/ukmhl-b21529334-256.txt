Stir in the yolks of two eggs and one whole egg; this must be done gradually. Whisk the whites of two eggs to a stiff froth and mingle with the mixture and season with a little cayenne or Nepaul pepper. Three parts fill some paper or china ramequin or souffle cases. Bake in a hot oven for about ten minutes ; arrange the cases on a dish with folded napkin, and serve immediately. SOUFFLE OF GREEN PEAS /^lOOK one quart of green peas with a handful ^ of spinach to give a very green colour. Rub through a fine sieve. Work in with the puree half an ounce of fresh butter, the yolks of three eggs and two tablespoonfuls of Bechamel sauce. Work well over the stove, season and remove. When cool, add the well-beaten whites of two eggs ; mix lightly and place in a well-buttered mould, with a band of paper bound round to support it. Steam gently until cookedâ€”this will take about thirty minutes, according to the size of the mould. Tomato souffle can be made the same way, only baked in the oven instead of being steamed.

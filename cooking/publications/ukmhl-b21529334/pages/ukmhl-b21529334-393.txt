BREAKFAST DISHES 345 minutes, stirring all the time. Season with salt, pepper and grated nutmeg ; remove the bay leaf and add the yolks of two eggs. Spread this on a buttered plate to get cool. Divide the mixture into eight portions, shape into round flat cakes, egg and crumb them and fry in very deep hot fat to a golden colour. Drain, dish up, and serve hot. WHITE PUDDINGS FOR BREAKFAST f I TAKE some well-cleaned pigs’ skins, as for sausage making, and fill them with the following mixture :■— One teacupful of chopped suet, not too finely chopped, one teacupful of medium Scotch oatmeal, a little finely chopped parsley, and one onion which has been chopped small and simmered in a little butter long enough to remove its rawness. Season well with black pepper and a little salt; mix well, and when quite full prick the skins with a needle to prevent bursting. Blanch slowly in water over the fire, but when up to boiling heat, place the pan on side of stove for fifteen minutes ; dry the sausages, fry a golden brown in bacon fat or dripping, and serve on toast.

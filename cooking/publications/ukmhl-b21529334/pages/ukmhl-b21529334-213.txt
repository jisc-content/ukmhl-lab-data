HOT MEAT DISHES 155 TOURNEDOS OF BEEF TjMLLET steaks are cut laterally from the thickest part of the fillet of beef. They ought to be about one and half inches thick, and weigh from six to seven ounces. Tournedos are half fillets as to weight. The thickness of a tournedos should be about one and a quarter inches, and they should be cut into a nice round shape. % TOURNEDOS BEARNAISE SEASON the tournedos and grill them. Set them on round crusts half an inch thick, fried in clarified butter, and take care not to over-cook them. Cut a nice piece of fat and lay it on the top of each tournedos. Arrange them neatly in a dish (or on a silver grid). Arrange a heap of souffle potatoes in the centre of the dish, and serve with a Bearnaise sauce served in a sauceboat. %

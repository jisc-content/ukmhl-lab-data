THE DUDLEY RECIPES 22 CONSOMME VELOUTE QUANTITIES FOR MAKING THREE QUARTS rTlHREE pounds shin of beef, three pounds lean topside of beef, one soup fowl, one pound of carrots, three-quarters of a pound of leeks, two turnips, one head of celery, and a little parsley. Place the shin of beef in a stock-pot, with five quarts of cold water. When it comes to the boil, skim off all grease and add the vegetables. Let all cook gently for five or six hours, then strain. When cold, remove all fat from the surface. Take the three pounds of lean topside, which has been previously passed through the machine, mix it with one pint of water, and add it to the above. Stir gently over the fire until it boils ; then add, chopped very finely, one carrot, one leek, one piece of celery, a little parsley and the soup fowl, which has been roasted in front of the fire. Let all again cook gently for two hours ; remove with paper any fat from the surface, and pass through a soup napkin. The garnish for this soup is a printanier of vegetables and rounds of marrow bones cut about three-quarters of an inch thick ; these should be poached and served in a little of the consomme with the garnish of vegetables.

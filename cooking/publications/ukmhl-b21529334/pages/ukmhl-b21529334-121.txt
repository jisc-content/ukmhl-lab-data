POULTRY AND GAME DISHES 81 add a small bunch of parsley and a bay leaf or thyme. Remove this before serving. If desired, the above can be browned in a frying- pan, but it rather hardens the meat. 9 FRIED RABBIT ONE young rabbit, one egg, two ounces of butter, breadcrumbs, Tartare sauce, seasoning and frying fat. Skin, draw, wash and wipe the rabbit; cut it into neat joints, and fry in butter in a saute pan until three-parts done; sprinkle with a little pepper and salt; put the pieces to cool ; then trim ; dip each in beaten egg and crumb them ; when set, dip in oiled butter, and egg and crumb again. Place the pieces in a frying basket, and fry a golden colour in clarified fat or lard ; drain ; dish up on a hot dish with a folded napkin or dish paper. Garnish with fried or fresh parsley, and serve with Tartare sauce. Garnish with strips of fried bacon. %

COLD DISHES 177 served cold in a sauceboat, without having been either clarified or cleared. A macedoine of cold vegetables mixed with Mayonnaise sauce, or tomato salad, should be served at the same time. The ficandeau—fillet or loin of veal—is equally good cold and served in the same way. « DAUBS OF VEAL IN ASPIC f IIAKE a fillet of veal, roll it as if for braising, and place it in a casserole with some small carrots and button onions. Let it cook gently until tender. Dish up the veal and vegetables ; add a little good gravy to the same pan in which the veal was cooked, and let it simmer a little. Remove any grease, season, and serve this in a sauceboat separ- ately. Next day, slice the veal into small rounds ; line a deep dish with the cooked carrots and onions, and lay in the slices of veal. Make hot the gravy in which it was cooked, adding two leaves of gelatine. Remove any fat. When sufficiently cool, pour it over the meat and vege- tables in the dish, a little at a time until all is set pretty firmly. Let it remain on ice until required, then turn out, and it will be nicely jellied. Serve with any kind of green or cold vegetable salad.

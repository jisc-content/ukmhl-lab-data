SWEETS AND PUDDINGS 283 ready some buttered cups, fill them with the mixture and bake for half an hour. Serve with a wine sauce. 9 GOLDEN BALLS X)OIL together in a pan three-quarters of a pint of water, a pinch of salt and rather more sugar, and one ounce of butter. When this is absolutely boiling, stir in gradually sufficient flour to make a stiff paste, that requires some effort to stir. Let this simmer for rather under half an hour, then draw the pan from the fire and let it cool a little. Stir in five eggs, one at a time, stirring in the first thoroughly before adding the next. Then turn this paste into a basin and let it stand for at least three hours. When about to use this, stir in two table- spoonfuls of orange-flower water (or any other flavouring to taste). Then break up the paste into pieces about the size of a walnut and fry in very hot butter in a frying-pan. They must not be touched whilst frying, as the motion of the butter will turn them. As soon as they are golden brown, lift them out with a skimmer, drain well, dust with powdered sugar, and serve at once.

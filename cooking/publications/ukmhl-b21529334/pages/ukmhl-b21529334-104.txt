THE DUDLEY RECIPES 64 POACHED CHICKEN WITH MUSHROOMS POACH the pullet and lay it on a dish ; coat it with the following sauce, well flavoured with mushrooms, and when serving surround it with about twenty cooked and very white small mushrooms :â€” Take the yolks of five eggs, one pint of cold white stock, one quart of veloute sauce, the juice of half a lemon, three-quarters of a pint of mushroom liquor, salt and pepper. Put the various ingredi- ents into a thick-bottomed saute pan and mix them carefully ; then put the pan on an open fire, and stir the sauce with a metal spatula, lest it burn at the bottom ; when the sauce has been reduced to about one quart, add one-third of a pint of fresh cream to it and reduce further for a few minutes. It should then be passed through a fine strainer into a sauce tureen and kept moving until it is cold. When heated again, pour the sauce over the pullet. A very small quantity of butter and a small addition of cream should be added to the sauce at the very last moment, and away from the fire.

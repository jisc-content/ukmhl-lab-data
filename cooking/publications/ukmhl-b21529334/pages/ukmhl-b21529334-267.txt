VEGETABLES AND SALADS 225 crumbs, one ounce of suet, one teaspoonful of chopped parsley, one ounce of grated Parmesan cheese, one egg, salt, pepper and one gill of half- glaze sauce. Cut the egg-plants lengthwise in twos; remove a portion of the interior to make room for the stuffing. Chop the bacon, mushrooms and suet finely. Put the butter and bacon in a stewpan ; when hot, add the shallots and fry a little; mix in a basin the suet, parsley, breadcrumbs (previ- ously soaked in a little milk), and Parmesan cheese. Season with pepper and salt; add butter and shallots, also the yolk of an egg, or, if necessary, the whole egg. Mix well, then put this stuffing in the egg-plants. Range them in a buttered saute pan ; sprinkle with a mixture of breadcrumbs and grated cheese and bake in a moderate oven for half an hour or more. Dish up, and serve with half- glaze sauce. AUBERGINES PROVENCALES CUT some aubergines into halves ; stuff them with Duxelle or mushroom mixture; flavour with a suspicion of garlic and brown in the oven.

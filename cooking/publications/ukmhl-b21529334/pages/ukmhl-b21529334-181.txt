STUFFED BREAST OF VEAL T)ONE the piece of veal and open it where it is thickest, without touching the ends. A kind of pocket is thus obtained, into which the pre- viously prepared stuffing should be placed, care being taken to spread it very evenly. Sew up the opening with coarse cotton, and remember to with- draw the cotton when the veal is cooked. The veal should be braised ; the moistening should be short and the cooking process gentle. For a piece weighing about four pounds, when stuffed, allow three hours in a moderate and regular oven. It should be glazed at the last moment.

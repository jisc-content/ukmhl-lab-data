SOUPS 17 spoon until hot. Then add the rice, previously washed and drained ; fry a little and moisten with the fish stock; add the onions and cloves and let simmer until the rice is quite tender, stirring frequently; soak the soft part of the roll in a little milk and add this to the soup ; pass through a tammy or fine sieve : return to the stewpan ; season to taste ; reheat and add the cream. Just before serving, add the lemon juice and the cray- fish tails and serve with a plate of small fried bread croutons. A little butter must be added to the puree at the last moment to prevent a skim forming whilst it is waiting to be served. The bisque should be smooth and creamy. BISQUE OF LOBSTER rTlHIS is prepared in the same way as the above recipe for Bisque of Crayfish, only substi- tuting for the crayfish a raw lobster, weighing about three pounds cut into small sections. Also the garnish in the soup should be pieces of lobster meat cut into small dice. It is also preferable to use velout6 sauce instead of white consomme; otherwise the whole preparation is identical as for the Bisque of Crayfish. The bisques, when prepared, should be smooth and creamy.

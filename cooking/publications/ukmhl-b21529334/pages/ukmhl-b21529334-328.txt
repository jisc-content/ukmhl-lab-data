THE DUDLEY RECIPES 284 GOLDEN FRITTERS CUT some stale rolls into rounds and soak in a mixture of one beaten egg and a little sweetened milk, flavoured with vanilla. Dip these in thick batter ; roll in breadcrumbs, and fry in butter. Serve with sifted sugar, and quarters of orange, or any other compote of fruit. BROWN BREAD PUDDING OlX ounces of breadcrumbs, half a pint of milk, ^ three ounces of butter, four ounces of sugar, three eggs, two ounces of mixed candied peel, grated nutmeg, one teaspoonful of ground cinna- mon and a pinch of salt. A glass of sherry may be added, if liked. Boil up the milk and pour over the breadcrumbs ; add the cinnamon, candied peel (finely chopped or shredded) and a pinch of salt. Work the butter and sugar to a cream ; add the eggs one at a time ; mix in the soaked breadcrumbs and add a little grated nutmeg. Put the mixture in a well-buttered mould ; cover with a buttered paper and steam for about two hours. If wine is used, it should be added last of all. Unmould the pudding on a hot dish, and serve with fruit syrup or custard sauce. This pudding is equally nice served cold.

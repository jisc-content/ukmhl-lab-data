THE DUDLEY RECIPES 112 Wash the rice; blanch it in slightly salted water; drain and cook till tender with a little stock and the game sauce ; season with pepper and salt. Put the rice in a buttered plain-border mould ; pack tightly and turn out on to a hot dish. Chop the mushrooms finely and put with the chicken. Add a few drops of lemon juice and cook a few minutes longer. Dish up the chicken in the centre of the rice ; add the sauce, and serve very hot.

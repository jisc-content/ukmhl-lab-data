THE DUDLEY RECIPES 140 STUFFING FOR BREAST OF VEAL TT^OR a piece weighing four pounds, add to one pound of fine sausage meat two ounces of dry Duxelle, two ounces of butter, a pinch of chopped parsley, tarragon and chives, a well- beaten egg and a little salt and pepper. The sausage meat is prepared by cutting into large cubes one pound of fillet of pork and the same weight of fresh fat bacon, seasoned with one ounce of spiced salt. Chop well and pound finely in a mortar ; finish with one beaten egg and one tablespoonful of brandy. Dry Duxelle is prepared as follows :— Slightly fry one teaspoonful of onions in one tablespoonful of butter and oil mixed. Add to this four tablespoonfuls of mushroom stalks and parings, chopped and well pressed in a towel to expel the vegetable moisture. Stir over a brisk fire until the moisture has completely evaporated ; season with salt, pepper and nutmeg and one small teaspoonful of well-chopped parsley, mixing the whole thoroughly. Transfer to a jam-pot or bowl; cover with a piece of white buttered paper and put aside until it is required. Dry Duxelle is used for many things—such as stuffing vegetables, etc.—mixed with other in- gredients.

VENISON 317 u Demi-Glaze Sauce is made as follows :— Reduce three-quarters of a pint of Espagnol sauce with one and a half gills of good gravy (strained and freed from fat). Allow to simmer for about fifteen minutes, and season with a pinch of pepper and salt. HAUNCH OF VENISON ROASTED WHOLE 11/TAKE a very firm paste of common flour and -*-*-*- water. Beat it well and let it rest for a few minutes, then roll it out the thickness of one inch. Butter or grease well a sheet of kitchen paper and first wrap the haunch in this, then encase the joint in the paste and again wrap in kitchen paper (this is to preserve the fat). Lace it well with twine to keep the paper on the paste. Then roast in front of a large fire for three hours—or longer if it is a large haunch. When cooked, remove the paper and the paste, and dish up very hot. Serve in boats, red-currant jelly and gravy.

THE DUDLEY RECIPES 54 FRENCH SALMON TART TYEMOVE the skin from a slice of salmon of moderate thickness and cut it into neat fillets. Free the trimmings from skin and bone, and pound them in a mortar with a few chopped mushrooms and about an ounce of butter. When smooth, incorporate two tablespoonfuls of creamy Bechamel sauce, and season with salt, pepper and aromatic spice. Line a flan, or French tart mould, placed on a baking sheet, with plain short- crust paste ; prick the bottom Avith a fork and spread over the prepared mixture. Upon this arrange neatly the fillets of salmon ; sprinkle over some chopped parsley and seasoning, some lemon juice and oiled butter ; cover with a layer of puff paste ; ornament the surface with the aid of a knife, and brush over with beaten egg-yolk. Bake in a moderate oven for forty minutes. Remove the cover carefully and take off the fat which has accumulated. Have ready a ragout of prawns or large shrimps, which place on the top of the salmon fillets. Replace the paste crust cover, dish up, and serve very hot. %

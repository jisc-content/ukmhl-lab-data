THE DUDLEY RECIPES 316 For flavouring, it is better to put into the roast- ing pan a few slices of celery, onion and carrot. Strain through a sieve before serving, and serve some of the sauce separately in a sauceboat. BRAISED HAUNCH OF VENISON REMOVE the spine-bone from a small haunch of venison, trim it and put it in a braising pan with a mirepoix consisting of two carrots, one large onion cut into slices, a head of celery, a few sprigs of thyme and parsley, two bay leaves, twelve peppercorns, three cloves and two blades of mace. Add half a pint of claret and sufficient stock to cover the venison. Cover with buttered paper; bring it to the boil and put the lid on to the pan, and cook in a moderate oven for about three hours. Baste the surface of the venison with its own braise from time to time. When it is done, put it into a baking pan with about a gill of its own liquor well reduced, and brush it over with meat glaze. Keep it hot. Strain the remainder of the braise-stock liquor, add a glass of port wine and a pint of demi-glaze sauce ; reduce well and skim occasionally ; season to taste with salt and cayenne. Serve with some fried onions in a separate dish, or stewed Spanish onions.

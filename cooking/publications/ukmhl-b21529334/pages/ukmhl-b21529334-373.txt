325 25 EGG DISHES CROQUETTES OF EGGS FOR BREAKFAST OR LUNCH li/TAKE a creamy Bechamel sauce in this way:â€” Cut into small pieces a little carrot, onion, celery, a sprig of parsley, a very little thyme and bay leaf, and a few grains of whole pepper. Put all these ingredients into the saucepan with a piece of butter and allow them to colour during a few minutes. Take a large spoonful of flour and wet this plentifully with milk and a little cream; season well, and allow the Bechamel to reduce slowly over a small fire, for at least an hour, and then pass. Cut into small dice five or six eggs which have been boiled for ten minutes ; put this into a dish with a little chopped parsley. Pour over sufficient of the sauce to obtain a compact mixture. Mould this at once into little well-buttered moulds, and place upon ice until firm ; then remove from the moulds. Yellow them with egg and fry quickly a nice colour; serve on a dish with fried parsley, and very hot.

THE DUDLEY RECIPES 164 whipped aspic, enough to make a light but rather firm souffle, otherwise it will not stand firm ; pile the foie gras high and smooth on the carcase and mask all over with clear aspic jelly; keep in a very cold place until wanted. Cut the fillets from the breast into nice cutlets and Chaud-froid over with the remainder of the sauce. Lay them neatly on the dish round the poularde and garnish with aspic jelly. WHITE CHAUD-FROID SAUCE T>OIL one pint of veloute in a stewpan and add three-quarters of a pint of melted white poultry jelly. Put the stewpan on an open fire. Reduce the sauce by a third, stirring constantly the while, and gradually add half a pint of very fresh cream. When the sauce has reached the desired degree of consistency, rub it through a tammy and stir it frequently while it cools, for fear of a skin forming on its surface, for if this happened it would have to be strained again. When dishing up, this sauce should be cold, so that it may properly coat immersed solids and yet be liquid enough to admit of the latter being easily steeped in it.

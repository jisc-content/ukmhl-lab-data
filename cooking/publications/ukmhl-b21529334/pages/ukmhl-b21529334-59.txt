SOUPS D 21 CONSOMME A LA FERMIERE T>UT into fine julienne one carrot, one turnip, the white heads of two leeks, one small onion, and one white head of celery. Slightly stew these vegetables in two ounces of fresh butter, and moisten with a pint or more of light consomme made chiefly from chicken or veal stock. Add two ounces of green cabbage cut in julienne, and simmer all together gently. Remove any fat that may rise. The consomme must be clear. Brown lightly some small rounds of bread cut thin, and serve separately on a plate. LARIFY one quart of stock (made of shin of beef, knuckle of veal and soup fowl in the usual way). Add four ripe tomatoes cut into halves ; boil gently for half an hour, season and pass through a clean napkin so that it should be very clear and to have a pink tinge. For garnish, a pluck of chervil leaves. This soup is good, hot or cold. CONSOMME A LA MADRID

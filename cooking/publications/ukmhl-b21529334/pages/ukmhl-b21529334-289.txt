SAUCES 247 tomato pulp, one gill of claret, one glass of sherry and some mushrooms, either fresh or preserved. Wash and peel the carrot, turnip and onion, and cut them up small and put in a stewpan with the bouquet, cloves, peppercorns and the veal and ham, both cut into pieces. Add an ounce of butter and stir over the fire until of a nice light brown colour. This forms a true “ mirepoix.” Pour off the fat, and moisten the mirepoix with the stock, claret, sherry, tomato pulp and mushrooms ; boil gently for about an hour; skim occasionally. Meanwhile prepare a brown roux, by melting three ounces of butter in a stewpan, stir in the flour and cook very slowly over a moderate fire, stirring all the while with a wooden spoon, until it acquires a chestnut brown colour. Allow the roux to cool a little ; pour in gradually the prepared stock, etc., and stir over the fire until it boils ; then let simmer slowly for another hour, skim well and pass through a tammy or fine sieve. If found too thick, add a little more stock. To prevent a thick crust forming on the top of the sauce, stir occasionally until quite cool. Keep the sauce in a stone jar, or pan, until wanted, and be sure and boil up the sauce each day if not all used up at one time, adding a. little fresh stock, if necessary.

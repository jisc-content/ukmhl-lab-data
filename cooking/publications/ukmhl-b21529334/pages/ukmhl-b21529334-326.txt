THE DUDLEY RECIPES 282 GERMAN FRITTERS MAKE a batter with one pint of milk boiled up with one ounce of butter and a dust of salt. When boiling, stir in very gradually four ounces to five ounces of the finest sifted flour and stir till the batter leaves the sides of the pan, when it should be left to stand till quite cold. Then add three whole eggs and a teaspoonful of rum, mixing them in gently. Have the frying fat fairly hot, but not actually boiling, and drop in the batter in small teaspoonfuls, when it will form round balls, which must be kept constantly moved to preserve their shape, and colour them evenly. When little cracks appear on their surface, they are ready. Serve with liqueur-flavoured cream. â€¢a GERMAN PUFFS BEAT twenty-six almonds very finely in a mortar, with a spoonful of orange-flower water to prevent their oiling.

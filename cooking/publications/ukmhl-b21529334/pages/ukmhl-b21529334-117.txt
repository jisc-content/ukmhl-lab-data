POULTRY AND GAME DISHES 77 G CUBBAB OF CHICKEN AN INDIAN DISH npAKE a very good tender chicken and cut it A- up into about twelve pieces ; place them in a terrine of cold water, and allow them to soak for an hour ; drain, and replace them in a dry terrine. Wet all over with a large tablespoonful of best olive oil, and sprinkle over them a teaspoonful of “ Turmric ” powder ; turn them over lightly with a palette knife. Spit the pieces upon a long skewer and grill them in front of a good roasting fire, turn- ing them every two minutes. Twenty minutes suffices to cook them properly ; then remove from the skewers and season well with salt and, very lightly, with cayenne. Cook in the same way half a dozen chickens’ livers. Place all the pieces on a dish together, and serve separately some savoury rice and a little chutney in its bottle.

74 HOT POULTRY AND GAME 63 DISHES POACHED CHICKEN WITH MAIZE 1I>LACE a nice white fat Surrey fowl in a covered stewpan with sufficient good light stock to cover it; add one onion, one carrot, a bouquet, two cloves and a few peppercorns. Bring to the boil, draw to one side, and allow it to simmer for about an hour—to poach, rather than boil. When tender, serve whole or cut into neat pieces. Place on dish, and sauce over with very good Supreme sauce flavoured with mushrooms, and finished with a little cream. Serve some of the sauce in a boat. The maize is drained from all moisture and placed in a stewpan with a piece of butter the size of a nutmeg, one onion and pepper and salt. Cook for an hour or more until quite tender, taking care to keep it from burning. When tender, add one table- spoonful of Supreme sauce and a little cream. Mix, and serve in a vegetable dish at the same time as the chicken. The maize should be new maize, and can be pro- cured from Jackson’s, Piccadilly, or any good grocer’s.

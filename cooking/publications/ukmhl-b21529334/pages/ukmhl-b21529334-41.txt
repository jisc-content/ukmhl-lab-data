WANT OF PUNCTUALITY Amongst other follies, Beau Brummell had that of choosing to be always too late for dinner. Wher- ever he was invited, he liked to be waited for. He thought it was a proof of his fashion and conse- quence ; and the higher the rank of his entertainer, the later was the arrival of this impudent “ parvenu The Marquis of Abercorn had for some time sub- mitted to this ojt-repeated trial of his patience, but at length he would bear it no longer. Accordingly, one day, when he had invited Brummell to dine, he desired to have the dinner on the table punctually at the time appointed. The servants obeyed, and Brummell and the cheese arrived together. The wondering beau was desired by the master of the house to sit down. He vouchsafed no apology for what had happened, but coolly said, “ I hope, Mr. B., cheese is not disagreeable to you.” It is said that Brummell was never late in that house in future. AMELIA OPIE % Socrates said, “ Bad men live that they may eat and drink, whereas good men eat and drink that they may live. Cheerfulness is health ; the opposite, melancholy, is disease. HALIBURTON

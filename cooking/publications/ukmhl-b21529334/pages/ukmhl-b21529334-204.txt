THE DUDLEY RECIPES 174 pound of ham, liver farce or foie gras, one table- spoonful of chopped mushrooms, one tablespoonful of chopped truffles, one teaspoonful of chopped parsley and pistachios, half a pint of good stock and chopped aspic. Make a paste of the flour, mixing the butter and milk into it hot ; add the yolk of egg and a little salt; mix and knead well. Line a raised pie-mould with this paste, about a quarter of an inch thick. Mince the veal and pork together ; season with salt, pepper, cayenne and nutmeg. Place this mince all round the mould inside the paste ; fill in the centre with fillets of pigeon and pheasant or grouse, or else use strips of ham, larks and quails stuffed with liver farce. Sprinkle over the chopped mushrooms, truffles, pistachios and parsley, and a little pepper and salt ; cover over with some of the mince ; wet the paste round and lay on the top cover ; close it well round the edge ; trim it ; and work up the trimmings of paste to make an ornament for the top. Tie a band of buttered paper round the mould about three inches from the top, and bake it in a steady oven for three hours. When the pie is nearly cold, move the top ornament of paste and pour in about half a pint of good stock—not too liquid, or it will soak through the paste—replace the ornament, and when quite cold dish up the pie. Garnish it with chopped aspic and parsley.

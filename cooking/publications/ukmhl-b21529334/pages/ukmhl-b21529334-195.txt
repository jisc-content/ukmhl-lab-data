COLD DISHES M 165 MAYONNAISE OF CHICKEN ALEXANDRA rpAKE one Surrey fowl and boil it gently. When cold, remove the fillets and cut them into neat pieces (not too small); and mix with a good Mayonnaise sauce. Trim and wash two cabbage lettuces. Line a pudding-basin with aspic jelly, and when set ornament it with ox-tongue and truffles cut in pieces. Place in the basin a little of the lettuce mixed with Mayonnaise, then the chicken, the slices of tongue, and so on, until the basin is full. Season and sauce each layer, and coat with aspic. Place on ice until well set, then dip the basin into warm water, and turn out just before serving. Serve with the above the following green sauce:â€” Bruise in a mortar a little parsley, two spring onions, two gherkins, a tablespoonful of capers, one leaf of spinach, and three tablespoonfuls of thick Mayonnaise sauce. Pound and pass through a sieve, and mix with cream. %

For he on honey-dew hath fed, And drunk the milk of Paradise. % COLERIDGE Let me have men about me that are fat. Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o’ nights : Yond’ Cassius has a lean and hungry look ; He thinks too much : such men are dangerous. SHAKESPEARE, “ JULIUS C.ESAR,” I, ii Though gay companions o'er the bowl Dispel awhile the sense of ill; Though pleasure stirs the maddening soul The heart—the heart—is lonely still From wine what sudden friendship springs !

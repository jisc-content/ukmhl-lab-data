MISCELLANEOUS 2 A 393 has passed through the sieve into an air-tight box, which must be kept dry. Before being used, the spice should be mixed with table-salt, which should be dried and passed through a sieve. TOMATO PICKLE SIX pounds of tomatoes, two teaspoonfuls of ground ginger, a quarter of an ounce of garlic, one pint of vinegar, one teaspoonful of allspice, one tablespoonful of salt, and one tablespoonful of castor sugar. The tomatoes must be quite ripe. Take and bake them in an oven until tender ; remove the skins and place the tomatoes in a stone jar with the above ingredients. Mix together thoroughly and keep in a cool place for a few days ; then rub all through a sieve (a silk or cotton one); boil up in a copper or earthenware pan with sugar and vinegar—rather more sugar than vinegar—let cool, then put it into bottles, cork and seal well, and store away in a cool but dry place. Capsicums, green and red, shallots and lemon juice can be used in the preparation of the tomato pickle, as it then becomes more of a condiment.

A FRENCH WAY OF ROASTING A LEG OF MUTTON /CHOOSE a small leg of fat mutton ; trim and ^ bone it, i.e. remove the hip and thigh bones. Season with salt and pepper, finely chopped parsley, one finely chopped shallot and a bruised clove of garlic (garlic introduced into raw meat loses its objectionable acidity and odour; it renders the meat more appetising and imparts a very fine flavour). Tie up the meat and place it in a baking-tin with a few slices of carrot, one sliced onion and two ounces of butter. Bake it in a hot oven for twenty minutes ; baste frequently, and finish baking or roasting in a slacker oven until tender. The usual time allowed for boned and rolled joints is twenty minutes to every pound and twenty minutes over. When done, pour off the fat from the tin and add some thin brown sauce or stock for the purpose of making the gravy. Season it and pour round the meat.

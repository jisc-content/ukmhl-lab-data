Sprinkle lightly over all a little rasped gratin, and lay on top of this an ounce of butter cut into small pieces. Place in oven to cook gently for thirty minutes, and serve in the dish in which it was cooked. CHICKEN TURBOT FERMIERE OPRINKLE on the bottom of a buttered tray ^ two minced shallots, a few rounds of carrot and onions, some parsley, thyme and bay leaf. Lay on these the chicken turbot, and season mode- rately. For a fish weighing two pounds, moisten with two-thirds of red wine and add half an ounce of butter cut into small pieces. Poach gently, taking care to baste frequently. Meanwhile toss three ounces of minced mushrooms in three ounces of butter. When the turbot is ready, drain and dish it, surround with the tossed mushrooms, and keep it hot. Strain the cooking liquor into a vege- table pan, and reduce it to half the quantity, and add three ounces of butter. Pour this sauce over the turbot and its garnish, and set it to glaze quickly. Serve very hot. Large soles can be cooked in the same way.

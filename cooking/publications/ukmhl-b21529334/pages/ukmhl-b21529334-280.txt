The sauce to meat is ceremony, Meeting were bare without it. SHAKESPEARE â€œ MACBETH 1 A good crier of green sauce. % RABELAIS Give us the luxuries of life and we will dispense with its necessaries. % MOTLEY Of herbs and other country messes Which the neat-handed Phyllis dresses. % If ever I ate a good supper at night I dreamed of the Devil, and waked in a fright. THE NEW BATH GUIDE SURFEIT As Surfeit is the father of much fast, So every scope by the immoderate use Turns to restraint. SHAKESPEARE

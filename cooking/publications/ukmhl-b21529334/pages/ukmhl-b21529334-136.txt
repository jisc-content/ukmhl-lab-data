THE DUDLEY RECIPES 96 SALMIS OF PHEASANT TT> OAST the pheasant, keeping it moderately Av underdone. Quickly cut into eight pieces two legs, two wings (separated from the pinions), and the breast cut into four lengthwise. Skin the pieces and trim them neatly and keep them at a temperate heat in a covered vegetable pan, with a small quantity of burnt brandy and a little clear, melted meat glaze. Pound the carcase and the trimmings and add to them half a bottle of red wine (almost entirely reduced), three chopped shallots and a few mignon- ette peppers. Add one quarter of a pint of good Espagnol sauce ; cook for ten minutes and then strain through a strainer. Reduce this sauce to about one-third and remove all scum; strain it once more through a close strainer; add a small quantity of butter and pour the sauce over the pieces of pheasant, to which add a finely sliced truffle and six grooved mushroom heads. Some croutons fried in butter can be placed round the salmis, if liked. This dish should be very quickly prepared and served, so that it should be eaten very hot and not allowed to stand. Â«

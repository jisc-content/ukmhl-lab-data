Ring for your valet—bid him quickly bring Some hock and soda water, then you'll know A pleasure worthy Xerxes, the Great King : For not the best sherbet, sublim'd with snow, Nor the first sparkle of the desert spring, Nor Burgundy in all its sunset glow, After long travel, ennui, love, or slaughter, Fio with that draught of hock and soda water. ^ BYRON, “ DON JUAN ” Ftfto things surpass old wine ; and they may preach Who please—the more because they preach in vain. Let us have wine and women, mirth and laughter, Sermons and soda-water the day after. BYRON, “ DON JUAN,” 2 clxxviii Three cups of wine a prudent man may take ; The first of them for constitution sake ; The second to the girl he loves the best; The third, and last, to lull him to his rest. Brisk wine some hearts inspires with gladness, And makes some droop in sober sadness ; Makes politicians sound to battle, And lovers of their mistress prattle : While with “ potations pottle deep ” It lolls the serious sot to sleep.

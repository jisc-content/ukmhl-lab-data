SHAKESPEARE A merry heart goes all the day, A sad tires in a mile. The most manifest sign of wisdom is continued cheerfulness. montaigne Cheerfulness, Sirs, is principal ingredient in the composition of health. murphy 5Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam, Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home. J. HOWARD PAYNE % Never put off till to-morrow what you can do to-day. Never trouble another for what you can do yourself. Never spend your money before you have it. Never buy what you don't want because it is cheap. Pride costs us more than hunger, thirst and cold. We seldom repent of having eaten too little. Nothing is troublesome that we do willingly. How much pain the evils have cost us, that have never happened. Take things always by the smooth handle. When angry, count ten before you speak. JEFFERSON

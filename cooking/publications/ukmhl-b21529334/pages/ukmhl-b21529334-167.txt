HOT MEAT DISHES 125 LEG OF MUTTON BOULANGERE REMOVE the bone from a leg of mutton; season it well inside and tie up with string. Place it in an earthenware dish and brown it well in the oven on both sides ; then complete its cooking all but about a third ; this done, set round the joint four large sliced onions, just tossed in butter that they may acquire some colour, and eight large peeled potatoes cut into rounds half an inch thick. Sprinkle this garnish with the grease of the joint and then complete the cooking of the joint and the garnish. Serve in the dish in which the joint has been cooked. If preferred, the joint can be stuffed with a sage and onion stuffing with a little thyme added.

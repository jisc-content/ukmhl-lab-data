SAVOURIES 193 CROUTES OF SMOKED HADDOCK HALF a dried haddock, half a pint of milk, two eggs, one shallot, one teaspoonful of chopped parsley, one ounce of butter, a little brown bread and some seasoning. Scald the fish ; remove the skin and bones ; break up the flesh into small pieces and put it in a saute pan with the milk. Cook until tender ; take up the fish ; drain and shred it as finely as possible. Melt the butter in a stewpan ; put in the shallot, peeled and finely chopped, also the parsley; mix a little but do not allow it to brown ; then add the fish and stir over a gentle fire. Beat up the eggs ; add about two tablespoonfuls of the milk in which the fish was cooked ; season with a pinch of pepper and a pinch of nutmeg, and stir this into the pan containing the fish. When it begins to set, remove it from the fire. Have ready some neatly cut croutes of fried brown (or white) bread ; dress the mixture upon these, well heaped up ; garnish with parsley, and serve. This dish is good either for breakfast or lunch, or as an after-dinner savoury.

THE DUDLEY RECIPES 36 SOLES NAPOLITAINES rpWO medium-sized soles, one ounce of flour, one tablespoonful of mushroom juice, two ounces of butter, one and half ounces of grated Parmesan cheese, one gill of milk, salt, pepper and nutmeg. Skin, trim and wipe well two medium-sized soles; place them in a buttered saut6 pan ; season with salt and pepper, and pour over them the mushroom juice ; cover with a buttered paper and cook from fifteen to twenty minutes, according to the heat of the oven. Meanwhile put the milk to boil. Melt the butter in a stewpan ; add the flour and stir over the fire until the flour becomes a light brown colour; then add the boiling milk with about an ounce of the grated Parmesan cheese and a little boiling water. Stir over the fire until it boils ; then allow it to simmer for ten minutes, adding a little more water or fish stock (if you have any at hand). If the sauce should appear too thick, season with salt, pepper and a little grated nutmeg. Place the cooked soles on an oblong flat dish ; add the liquor which remains in the saute pan to the sauce ; strain it and pour over the fish ; sprinkle with the remainder of the grated Parmesan. Place the dish in the oven, or under a hot salamander, just long enough for the top to take colour, and serve in the same dish.

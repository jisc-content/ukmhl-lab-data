THE DUDLEY RECIPES 230 SPANISH SARDINE SALAD REMOVE the skin and bones from twelve to sixteen sardines ; cut them into short pieces, and mix in a basin with two tablespoonfuls of capers. Season with salt, pepper and vinegar, and mix with some finely shredded lettuces. Arrange this in a salad bowl, and garnish with stoned Spanish olives filled with anchovy butter. 9 COLD TOMATOES AMERICAINE CHOOSE six or eight even-sized, but firm, tomatoes ; hollow out as much as possible of the soft centre portions ; remove the seeds and mix the pulp with an equal quantity of stiff Mayonnaise sauce ; to this add some finely chopped celery and a very little chopped ripe pineapple. Fill the tomatoes with this mixture, and place them in an ice-box for at least two hours. When serving, place each tomato on a fresh lettuce leaf in a glass dish with small lettuce leaves ranged round the tomatoes.

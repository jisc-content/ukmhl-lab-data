MISCELLANEOUS 387 HOW TO MAKE GOOD OATMEAL PORRIDGE TO make good porridge, the oatmeal should be rather coarse, what is called “ medium ” oatmeal. Put into a saucepan about three-quarters of a pint of water, and allow it to come to the boil. Shake into the boiling water gradually, two large handfuls of the oatmeal (about six large, heaped-up tablespoonfuls) and add half a teaspoonful of salt. Keep on stirring the porridge with a wooden spoon until it is well mixed, then draw the pan to the side of the fire and allow the porridge to simmer for about twenty minutes. Pour into an earthenware or china basin, and serve. OATMEAL GRUEL SOAK for two hours, four ounces of coarse Scotch oatmeal in one pint of water, or half milk and half water; then strain and boil until it thickens. If too thick add a little more hot milk. The gruel is greatly improved by adding to it a small quantity of cream.

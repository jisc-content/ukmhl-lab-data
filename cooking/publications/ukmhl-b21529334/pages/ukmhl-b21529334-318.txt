THE DUDLEY RECIPES 274 A FRUIT SWEET TNTO a pint of cream whisk well three eggs, six stale sponge cakes, crumbled, six tablespoon- fuls of the syrup of preserved strawberries, three ounces of sifted sugar and three ounces of ground almonds. This should all be well mixed to the consistency of a custard, or a little thicker. Butter a mould and pour in half the mixture, then a layer of preserved strawberries, and fill up with the remaining half of the mixture. Bake in a brisk oven until it becomes a golden yellow. This sweet is equally good hot or cold.

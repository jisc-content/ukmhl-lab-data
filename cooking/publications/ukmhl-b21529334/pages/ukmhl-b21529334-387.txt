EGG DISHES 339 MEYERBEER EGGS r 11AKE the number of dishes so that there is one for each person. Heat sufficient butter in each dish to cover the whole of the bottom; break two eggs carefully into each dish ; baste the yolks with a very little hot butter ; salt slightly and push the dish into the oven. As soon as the white of the eggs assumes a milky white colour, they are cooked and should be withdrawn from the oven and served immediately. Special care must be taken that the eggs are not cooked too much or too quickly, particularly as it should be remembered that the heat of the dish completes the cooking to a certain extent after it is removed from the oven. For the meyerbeer, place a small grilled sheep’s or lamb’s kidney on each dish with the eggs and surround with a thread of Perigueux sauce. Serve immediately.

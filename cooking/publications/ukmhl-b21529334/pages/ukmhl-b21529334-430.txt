382 TOASTS Here's to the maiden of bashful fifteen ; Here's to the widow of fifty ; Here's to the flaunting extravagant quean, And here's to the housewife that's thrifty ! Let the toast pass ; Drink to the lass ; I'll warrant she'll prove an excuse for the glass. SHERIDAN, “ SCHOOL FOR~SCANDAL,” III, iii J-S 7 7

Stuff the pullet with a mixture of one pound two ounces of “ Mousseline ” forcemeat of chicken, combined with one-third of a pound of puree of foie gras. Spread this preparation in layers, and between each of the layers set alternate slices of the supremes of chicken and truffle. Reconstruct the bird exactly ; smooth its surface, and place the dish upon which it stands on a deep tray con- taining a little boiling water, and poach in a moderate oven. The steam of the boiling water assists the poaching process. When about to serve, coat the pullet with German sauce, flavoured with truffle essence.

BREAKFAST DISHES 343 ROGNONS SAUTES AUX CHAMPIGNONS Ij^OUR to five sheeps’ kidneys, one ounce of butter, two small shallots, eight to ten fresh or preserved mushrooms, one gill of half-glaze sauce, a glass of Madeira, parsley, fried bread croutons cut into squares and seasoning. Remove the skin and core from the kidneys and cut into slices ; season with pepper and salt ; mince finely the shallots and slice the mushrooms. Put the butter into a saute pan, and when hot add the shallots and allow them to colour light brown ; then add the kidneys, and either shake or toss well over a brisk fire for about six minutes ; add the Madeira and cover the pan and allow the contents to infuse for a few seconds. Put in the sauce (which has previously been well reduced) and the mushrooms. Allow the whole to get thoroughly hot, but not to boil, else the kidne\s will become hard. Dish up with the croutons of fried bread placed round the dish and a very little very finely chopped parsley sprinkled over them. Calves’ liver or kidneys may be prepared in the same way. %

THE DUDLEY RECIPES 142 BRAISED AND STUFFED SADDLE OF VEAL X) RAISE the saddle and when it is ready put it on a dish. Draw a line within half an inch of its extreme edge on either side and ends, pressing the point of a small knife along the meat in doing so. Remove the fillets from the joint, severing them from the bone with care. Cut the fillets in regular collops, keeping the knife rather at a slant. In the double cavity left by the fillets spread a few tablespoonfuls of Bechamel sauce, seasoned with paprika; return the colloped fillets to their respective places in the joint, reconstructing them in suchwise as to make them appear untouched, and between each collop pour one half tablespoon- ful of Bechamel sauce, laying in also two slices of truffle. This done, cover the whole surface of the joint with Bechamel sauce, seasoned with paprika, and set under the salamander to glaze quickly. With the help of a large fish-slice, transfer the saddle carefully to a dish. Serve separately in a sauceboat the braising liquor of the saddle, cleared of all grease and reduced. Serve also in a separate dish some savoury rice. r%

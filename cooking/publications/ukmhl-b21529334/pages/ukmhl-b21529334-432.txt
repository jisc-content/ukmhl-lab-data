Wipe the oranges and lemons and pare off yellow rind, leaving white pith. Cut the rind into small chips ; soak these in salt and water for an hour ; wash repeatedly ; then boil for half an hour in four large breakfast cups of water ; change the water twice, and boil until the chips are soft. Take the white pith off the oranges and lemons and throw it away. Cut up the pulp and put it in a preserving pan with twelve breakfastcups of water, boil gently for half an hour, stirring now and again, and strain through a jelly-bag. Next day put the strained liquid, sugar and chips, and the liquid they were boiled in, into the preserving pan, and boil for from twenty to thirty minutes, skim- ming carefully. Put into glass jars for use, with oiled paper tied over the top of each jar.

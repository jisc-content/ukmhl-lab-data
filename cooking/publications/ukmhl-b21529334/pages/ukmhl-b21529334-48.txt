THE DUDLEY RECIPES 10 PUREE OF BEETROOT /~\NE quart of stock, one ounce of butter, one ounce of flour, one small onion, one or two cooked beetroots (according to size), one gill of cream, salt and pepper to taste, mustard and cress. Melt the butter in a stewpan and fry in it the onion peeled and sliced. Do not allow it to brown. Stir in the flour and fry for a few minutes ; add the stock and stir until it boils ; then allow to simmer for half an hour. Peel the beetroot and slice it finely ; sprinkle it with a little salt, pepper and mixed vinegar, Orleans tarragon, and a very little chillies, just enough to cover the slices of beetroot. Add the beetroot and vinegar to the soup and cook for fifteen minutes, not longer, otherwise the colour is spoiled. Pass the soup through a hair sieve, but rub through it only half the beetroot ; if too much beetroot juice is added, the soup will be too sweet. Then reheat ; pour into a soup tureen and put some very finely shredded mustard and cress on the top. Some cream in a sauceboat can be served with this soup, also croiltons, if liked.

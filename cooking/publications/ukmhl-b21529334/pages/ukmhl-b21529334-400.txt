352 FRIENDLINESS OF A FIRE A fire's a good companionable friendâ€” A comfortable friend, who meets your face With welcome glad, and makes the poorest shed As pleasant as a palace. Are you cold ? He warms you. Weary ? he refreshes you. Hungry ? he doth prepare your food for you. Are you in darkness ? he gives light to you. In a strange land ? he wears a face that is Familiar from your childhood. Are you poor ? What matters it to him. He knows no difference Between an Emperor and the poorest beggar ! Where is the friend, that bears the name of Man Will do as much for you ? MARY HO WITT

VENISON 315 POTTED VENISON r 11AKE the meat of cooked venison and pound it T in a mortar until thoroughly bruised. Add one ounce of fresh butter, a few peppercorns, a grate of nutmeg, pepper and salt to taste. When well mixed and pounded, pass through a fine wire sieve and place in a small potted-meat dish. Melt a little fresh butter and run it over to cover the top. Put in a cool place until cold. A little thick cream can be added to the potted meat, whilst being pounded, if this is liked. SADDLE OF VENISON A Lâ€™ALLEMANDE rTIAKE a small saddle of venison and cut away the flaps. Butter a pan and lay the saddle in it, pouring some butter over the top. Cook it briskly for about twenty minutes, and when it is beginning to turn brown (about half an hour before the meat is sufficiently done) pour half a pint (less or more according to size of joint) of thick, sour cream over it, basting it well until it turns a rich brown. Then add some more sour cream (about half a pint), and allow again to turn brown. If the sauce is not thick, add a very small quantity of flour.

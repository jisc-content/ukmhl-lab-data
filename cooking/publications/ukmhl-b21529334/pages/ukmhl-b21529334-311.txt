SWEETS AND PUDDINGS 267 Put the milk into a pan, and allow it to come to boiling heat. Place the yolks of the eggs and sugar in a basin, and work together. Pour over them the boiling milk, mix well, and return to stewpan. Place this pan in another pan of hot water, and stir until it becomes thick like a custard. Remove, and let it cool; then add the gelatine, which has been soaked and melted in a spoonful of water. When this becomes quite cool, add the whipped cream and, lastly, the whipped whites of egg. Mix lightly, and pour into a deep silver bowl. Place on ice to get very cold. Run over the top a little cherry jelly, and serve some fresh ripe cherries as a compote, flavoured with cherry brandy. COMPOTE OF GRAPES TAKE some nice large firm grapes—black or white—skin and stone. Place them in a dish, and pour over a small cupful of syrup made of sugar and water, boiled, and two tablespoonfuls of brandy or Maraschino, or any other liqueur pre- ferred. This compote is excellent served with sweet jelly —the jelly to be served in glass cups.

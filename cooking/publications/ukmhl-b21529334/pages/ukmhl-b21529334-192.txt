THE DUDLEY RECIPES 150 TO POACH MEAT OR FISH FT1HE definition of poaching is a boiling that does not boil. The term “ poach ” is extended to all slow processes of cooking which involve the use of a liquor. The time allowed for the cooking in each case must differ somewhat widely from the rest. The treatment of them all, how- ever, is subject to one unalterable principle—that the poaching liquor must not boil, although it should reach a degree of heat as near as possible to boiling point. Another principle is that large pieces of fish or poultry should be set to boil in cold liquor, after which it should be brought to the required tempera- ture as quickly as possible. The case may be the same with fillets of sole or poultry, which are poached almost dry, but all other preparations whose mode of cooking is poaching, gain by being immersed in liquor which has reached the required temperature beforehand. * * FOR BRAISING WHITE MEATS EXCEPT for veal sweetbread, which is always blanched before being braised, the meats or poultry should always be slightly stiffened and browned in butter on all sides. This is not essential

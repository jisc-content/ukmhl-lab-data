PREFACE HE Recipes contained in this volume are nothing very new or elaborate— merely what I think to be a useful collection to have at hand, as a sort of Memorandum Book for the mistress of a household when ordering meals, and when the inevitable question arises, “What on earth shall I order for luncheon and dinner to-day ? ” Many of the Recipes are very homely and simple, and, I think, may be useful in small households—showing how cold meat, etc., may be used up and turned into appetising dishes, as is done in France, and therefore much waste saved. The Recipes are interspersed with a selec- tion of quotations, which I hope may be interesting. GEORGINA DUDLEY. b

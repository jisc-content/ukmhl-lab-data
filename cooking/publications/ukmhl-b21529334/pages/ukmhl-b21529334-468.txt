418 TEA In China cold water is disliked and considered unwholesome, and therefore tea is taken to quench the thirst, which it does best when unmixed, without either milk or sugar. The practice of scenting tea is very common in China, and various odoriferous plants are employed for this purpose. In Russia, a squeeze, or a slice, of lemon often takes the place of our cream ; and in Germany, where the tea is made very weak, it is common to flavour it with rum, cinnamon or vanilla. “ The most perfect way of using tea” says Professor Johnson, “ is that described, I think, by Captain Basil Hall, as that practised on the Coast of South America, where the leaves, after being exhausted by infusion, are handed round the company on a silver salver, and partaken of by each guest in succession. The exhilarating effects of the hot liquid are in this practice followed by the nutritive effects of the solid leaf.” A Chinese legend relates that a pious hermit, who in his watchings and prayers had often been overtaken by sleep, so that his eyelids closed, in holy wrath against the weakness of the flesh, cut them off and threw them on the ground. But a god caused a tea shrub to spring out of them, the leaves of which exhibit the form of the eyelid bordered with lashes, and possess the gift of hinder- ing sleep. DR.

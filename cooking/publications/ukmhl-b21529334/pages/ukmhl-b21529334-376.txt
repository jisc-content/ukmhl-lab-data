THE DUDLEY RECIPES 328 FRIED EGGS ANY fat, provided it is well purified, can be used for frying eggs, but pure olive oil is the best. Also to do these eggs properly, they should be done one at a time. Heat some oil in an omelet pan until it begins to smoke slightly ; break the egg on a plate ; season it well and let it slide gently into the pan ; then with a wooden spoon quickly cover up the yolk with the solidified portions of the white, in order to keep the yolk soft. Drain the egg on a piece of stretched linen and proceed in the same way with the other eggs, until the required number is cooked. Serve the eggs on a hot dish, with fried bacon laid round them. POACHED EGGS WITH TOMATO SAUCE T30IL up a pint of tomato sauce in a saute pan. Skim, if necessary, and drop in carefully five or six eggs. Cook them until the whites are firm, basting them well all the time with the sauce. Lift them out very carefully, trim and dish them up on a piece of fried or toasted bread. Pour over the sauce, which must have been seasoned with minced shallot, salt and pepper, and serve very hot.

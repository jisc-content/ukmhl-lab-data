POULTRY AND GAME DISHES Take a young rabbit and cut it into neat joints ; lay them in cold water to draw off all the blood ; when this is done, wipe the pieces carefully and place them in the same pan as the sauce (which has been strained through a fine sieve); allow all to cook gently, skimming off the grease as it rises. Season to taste, and serve with boiled rice in a separate dish, and serve some of the sauce in a boat. The rice should be carefully boiled and drained, so that each grain is separate. '# SAUTED CHICKEN CHASSEUR /'ANE fat chicken or fowl, half an ounce of butter, a quarter of a gill of salad oil, one glass of sherry, one onion, two ounces of raw ham, six ounces of rice, one gill of salmis or game sauce, half a pint of Espagnol sauce, ten fresh or pre- served mushrooms, pepper, salt and lemon juice. Draw, singe and cut the fowl into neat joints ; put the oil and butter in a saute pan ; when hot, put in the pieces of chicken. Season with pepper and salt and fry a light brown colour over a quick fire. Add the onion, finely chopped, and the ham cut into slices or squares ; fry a few minutes longer ; drain off the fat ; add the sherry and Espagnol sauce and allow to simmer slowly for about half an hour.

THE DUDLEY RECIPES 168 PATES OF TURKEY OR CHICKEN PREPARE a good light puff paste and make some small patty cases. The cases must be empty, i.e. the soft portion must be removed from the centre of the pastry. To make the mixture for filling, proceed as follows :â€” Mince (not too finely) six to eight ounces of cooked turkey or chicken, freed from bone, skin and sinew (a little cold veal may be mixed with it if needed), three to four ounces of cooked ham or tongue and a few preserved mushrooms cut into dice. Melt an ounce of butter in a small stewpan ; stir in three-quarters of an ounce of flour ; blend this over the fire without browning ; then gradually add not quite half a pint of stock and milk. Allow it to boil whilst stirring. Cook for ten minutes, then strain and add the minced meat, etc. Season with salt, pepper, grated nutmeg and tiny pinch of cayenne ; also add a tablespoonful of cream and a teaspoonful of lemon juice, and let the whole stew very gently for another ten or fifteen minutes. Reheat the patty cases and fill them with the prepared mixture. Dish up ; garnish with parsley, and serve. These pates are delicious either hot or cold.

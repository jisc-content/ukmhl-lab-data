Returning to town in the stage coach which was filled with Mr. Gilman's guests, we stopped for a minute or two at Kentish Town. A woman asked the coachman, “ Are you full inside ? " Upon which Lamb put his head through the window and said, “ I am quite full inside ; that last piece of pudding at Mr. Gilman's did the business for me." There are men that would make you books, and turn them loose into the world, with as much despatch as they would do a dish of fritters. CERVANTES % MOTHER EVE’S PUDDING If you want a good pudding,, to teach you I'm willing, Take twopennyworth of eggs, when twelve for a shilling, And of the same fruit that Eve had once chosen, Well pared and well chopped at least half a dozen ; Six ounces of bread (let your maid eat the crust) ; The crumbs must be grated as small as the dust; Six ounces of currants from the stones you must sort, Lest they break out your teeth and spoil all your sport; Six ounces of sugar won't make it too sweet, Some salt and some nutmeg will m.ake it complete. Three hours let it boil, without hurry or flutter. And then serve it up—without sugar or butter.

RICE AND MACARONI DISHES 299 SOUFFLE AU MAIS OPEN a tin of maize, put on a sieve and let thin syrup run through, then pass the corn through. Have ready some very thick Bechamel sauce, in which a little onion was fried, and add the puree of maize to this, also a little sugar, pepper, salt, the wâ€™hipped whites and yolks of three eggs, and a little nutmeg, if liked. Work the yolks in before adding the whites of the eggs. Bake for three-quarters of an hour in a slow oven, and at the last in a hot oven. This souffle requires great care in baking. If kept waiting, it does not matter as long as it is kept in a slow oven, but it must be put in a hot oven to finish. Any souffle that remains can be used next day if put in a gratin dish with a little cream and paprika, and is as good as the original souffle. Also it is quite good as a plain vegetable, and makes a very nice dish to serve with game, if all the liquid is drained from it, and it is mixed with a nice creamy sauce.

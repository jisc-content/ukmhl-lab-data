THE DUDLEY RECIPES 102 thyme, marjoram (half a teaspoonful of each), one glass of port wine, one egg, a spoonful of red- currant jelly, a little stock and a suitable paste crust. Skin the hare and wash it several times in fresh water ; cut into joints and bone each. Put the carcass in a stewpan with water, to make stock ; flavour with cloves, a little sauce, bay leaf and salt. Skim as it boils, and cook gently for one hour. Wipe the meat; cut it into slices and fry in an ounce of butter ; add the shallot, peeled and chopped; take out the meat and let cool. Add the remainder of butter to the stewpan in which the hare was fried ; when hot put in the calfâ€™s liver, previously sliced thinly, and two ounces of the bacon ; fry for a short time and pound all in a mortar till smooth. Rub this through a wire sieve and mix with a well-beaten egg. Season with salt, pepper and aromatic seasoning. Line a raised pie-mould with hot water; prick the bottom and sides with a fork ; line the sides and bottom with thin slices of bacon and with a layer of the prepared farce ; fill up the mould with the fried pieces of hare. Sprinkle the powdered herbs and seasoning in between ; moisten each layer with port wine and red-currant jelly ; cover the top with farce and lay on the crust; fix the latter firmly. Decorate with pieces of paste. Make a suitable incision in the centre of the cover of crust, to allow the steam to escape whilst cooking. Bake in a moderate oven from one and a half to two

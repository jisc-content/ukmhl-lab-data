200 HOSPITALITY Bless'cl be that spot, where clieerjul guests retire, To pause from toil, and trim their evening fire ; Bless'd that abode where want and pain repair, And every stranger finds a ready chair. Bless'd be those feasts with simple plenty crown'd, Where all the ruddy family around Laugh at the jests or pranks that never fail, Or sigh with pity at some mournf ul tale : Or press the bashful stranger to his food, A nd learn the luxury of doing good. GOLDSMITH, “ THE TRAVELLER,” line 13

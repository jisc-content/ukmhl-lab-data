THE DUDLEY RECIPES 34 SOLE DUGLERE rriAKE one and a half ounces of chopped onion, half a pound of peeled and roughly cut up tomatoes, a little roughly chopped parsley, a pinch of table salt, a very little pepper, and the eighth of a pint of white wine. Lay the sole in a buttered dish with the vege- tables and wine ; set to poach gently, and then dish the sole. Reduce the cooking liquor ; thicken it with two tablespoonfuls of fish veloute; com- plete with one ounce of butter and a few drops of lemon juice. Pour the sauce over the fish, and serve. SOLE SUR LE PLAT TDARTLY separate the fillets from the bones on the upper part of the fish and slip a piece of butter, the size of a walnut, under each. Lay the sole on a very plentifully buttered dish ; moisten with one-fifth of a pint of the fishâ€™s cooking liquor, and add a few drops of lemon juice. Cook in the oven, basting often with butter until the cooking liquor has, by reduction, ac- quired the consistency of syrup, and covers the sole with a clear and glossy coat.

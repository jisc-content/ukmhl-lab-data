A CHEERFUL WOMAN She was a soft landscape of mild earth, Where all was harmony, and calm, and quiet Luxuriant: budding : cheerful without mirth, Which, if not happiness, is much more nigh it Than are your mighty passions. byron % Comfort, like the Golden Sun, Dispels the sullen shade with her sweet influence And cheers the melancholy house of care. ROwe r# Frugality may be termed the daughter of prudence, the sister of temperance and the parent of liberty. He that is extravagant will quickly become poor, and poverty will enforce dependence and invite corruption. % The sweetest honey Is loathsome in its own deliciousness, And in taste confounds the appetite. SHAKESPEARE % Man, through all ages of revolving time, Unchanging man, in every varying clime, Deems his own land of every land the pride. Belov'd of heaven o'er all the world beside : His home, the spot of earth supremely blest. A dearer, sweeter spot than all the rest. J. MONTGOMERY

VENISON 319 VENISON COLLOPS riWKE one pound of raw venison cut from the loin and free it from fat and sinew. Mince it and place it in a stewpan with three ounces of butter and one large onion cut in four pieces and wet with a pint of good light stock, either made from venison or any stock there may be at hand. Season well with salt and pepper and let all cook ; then remove the onion. Have ready a border of mashed potatoes, pre- pared with a little butter or cream and nicely browned. Pile up the collops in the centre, and serve. The mince should be thick and firm.

HOT MEAT DISHES 149 HOW TO COOK TRIPE 11HIE tripe should be very white, and should be cut into nice pieces and placed in a stewpan with enough water to cover. Season well with salt and pepper, and add six finely sliced onions. Allow to cook gently for two hours. Strain away all liquor, and make a very good white sauce, with one ounce of butter, one tablespoonful of flour and a little milk. Stir this continuously until it boils ; then pour over the tripe and onions and allow all to simmer for half an hour. Add a little cream, if desired, which, of course, improves the sauce. % MACARONI PIE O WELL four ounces of pipe macaroni in milk ^ with a large onion. Put a layer at the bottom of a pie-dish, with some bits of butter and scraped Gloucester cheese sprinkled lightly over it. Cover the whole with well-seasoned beefsteak, then some more macaroni, then a fowl cut in joints and seasoned, and then another beefsteak. Cover the whole with macaroni, pieces of butter and grated cheese instead of crust. Bake in a slow oven.

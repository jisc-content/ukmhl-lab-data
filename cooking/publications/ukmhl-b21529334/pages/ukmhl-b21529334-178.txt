THE DUDLEY RECIPES 136 TO MAKE HALF-GLAZE SAUCE 13 EDUCE three-quarters of a pint of Espagnol sauce with one and a half gills of good gravy, strained and freed from fat; allow to simmer for about fifteen minutes and season with a pinch of pepper. ■a STEAK AND KIDNEY PIE TV/TAKE a paste crust; cut about a pound of rump or buttock steak into thin slices ; dip each slice into a mixture of flour, salt and pepper, and roll a slice of bullock’s or sheep’s kidney and a tiny piece of fat into each slice of beef. Place them in a piedish ; pour in enough water or stock to come half-way up the dish ; wet the edges of the dish and line with a strip of paste ; brush the edge of the crust with egg, milk, or water, and place on a cover of paste. Make a small incision in the centre of the paste and decorate with a few fancifully cut leaves of paste. Brush over with beaten egg-yolk and bake for about one and a half hours. Veal and ham, pigeon, and rabbit pies are made in the same manner. Hard-boiled eggs cut into quarters or slices can be used with the filling ingredients, if liked. A rough puff or flaky crust is eminently suitable for all kinds of meat pies.

THE DUDLEY RECIPES 74 FRICASSEE OF CHICKEN r 1TRUSS a young fowl for boiling, and put it to cook in a large stewpan with one quart of hot water. Let it come slowly to the boil; when it reaches this point, remove the scum and add a couple of stalks of celery, three or four sprigs of parsley, a bay leaf, two slices of onion and a carrot; season with salt and pepper. Simmer for three- quarters of an hour, closely covered. As soon as done (test it with a fork), take it from the stock ; untruss, and cut it into neat joints. For the Sauce :â€” Cook together in a saucepan two tablespoonfuls of butter and two of flour for a few minutes, but do not allow it to brown ; add slowly a pint of the strained stock of the fowl and boil for ten minutes. Mix in another pan the yolks of two eggs, three tablespoonfuls of milk, one of melted butter and a tiny pinch of cayenne pepper ; add this carefully to the hot sauce, stirring all the time ; let the sauce get thoroughly hot, but do not let it boil again ; add a teaspoonful of lemon juice, and strain over the pieces of the fowl. Dish up the cooked fowl (the skin may be removed, if liked) on a bed of cooked rice. Sauce over carefully, and serve very hot. Needless to say, the pieces of fowl must get thoroughly hot in the sauce before dishing up.

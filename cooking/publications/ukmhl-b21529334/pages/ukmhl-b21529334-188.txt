THE DUDLEY RECIPES 146 Serve in a boat the following sauce :— Chop very finely some of the calf’s brain, also a little onion, parsley and chervil. Add some capers, a little French mustard, pepper and salt, a tablespoonful of salad oil and half a tablespoonful of French vinegar. Mix all well together and serve in boat. This sauce should be quite thick. If liked, two hard-boiled eggs chopped very finely can be added. BOSTON BAKED PORK AND BEANS ONE pint of white beans, half a pound of salt pork, one level teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of white pepper and tablespoonful of New Orleans molasses. Wash and soak the beans overnight ; cut the pork into small pieces about one inch square ; add salt and pepper and molasses and mix well with the beans. Put into a crock with plenty of water, cover, and bake in a slow oven for five hours, stir occasionally and, if the beans become dry, add more water. When cooked, the beans should be light brown in colour, unbroken but not too dry.

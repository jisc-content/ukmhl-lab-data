VENISON 313 This is an excellent dish for a shooting lunch. The mashed potato is best prepared with a little UT some thin slices, with plenty of fat, off a haunch of venison which has been cooked the previous day. Place this ready in a stewpan with cover, and prepare the following sauce :— Take two tablespoonfuls of red-currant jelly, one tumbler of port wine, one tumbler of claret, three bay leaves, six black peppercorns, four cloves and one pint of good brown sauce which has been made of venison essence (the shoulder and sinewy parts serve for this). First melt the jelly, then add the wine, spice and bay leaves. Let this reduce a little, then pour in the brown sauce and allow all to simmer for about ten minutes, and strain through a tammy or muslin. This should be poured over the sliced vension, and all made very hot, but not allowed to boil. Serve in silver dish over a lamp or hot water, with slices of venison fat cut very thin and laid on the top. If the haunch has little or no fat, thin slices of white beef fat can be substituted. This recipe was included in the “ Dudley Cookery Book,” published in 1910 by Mr. Arnold. cream. HASHED VENISON

THE DUDLEY RECIPES 256 SAUCE BORDELAISE PUT into a vegetable pan two ounces of very finely minced shallots, half a pint of good red wine, a pinch of mignonette pepper and bits of thyme and bay leaf. Reduce the wine by three- quarters and add half a pint of half-glaze. Allow the sauce to simmer for half an hour. Skim from time to time and strain through a sieve. When dishing it up, finish with two tablespoonfuls of dissolved meat glaze, a few drops of lemon juice and four ounces of beef marrow, cut into slices and poached in slightly boiling water. This sauce may be buttered to the extent of about three ounces per pint, which makes it smoother, but less clear. It is very good served with grilled meats.

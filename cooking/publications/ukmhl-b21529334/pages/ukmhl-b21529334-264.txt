THE DUDLEY RECIPES 222 BEETROOTS IN OIL fTlAKE some thick slices of cooked beetroot and fry slightly in sweet oil ; flavour with chopped onion also fried slightly, and finish in a red wine sauce. â€˜S CAULIFLOWER GRATIN nnHOROUGHLY clean a cauliflower and boil it ; drain it free of all water. Place in a frying-pan about one ounce of butter and a large tablespoonful of breadcrumbs. Stir over fire until a light brown colour, add pepper, salt and a squeeze of lemon juice, and pour quickly over the cauliflower, which should be served very hot. SPINACHE A LA CREME PREPARE the spinach by well cleansing in plenty of water, and pick the leaves from the long stems. Cook in boiling water which has been salted. When tender, strain and press in a cloth to free from all water, and pass through a sieve. Place in a stewpan over the fire, and work in one gill of cream and a little meat glaze. Season, and serve.

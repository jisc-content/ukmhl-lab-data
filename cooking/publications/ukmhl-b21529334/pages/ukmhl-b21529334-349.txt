A BANQUET A table richly spread in regal mode, With dishes piled, and meats of noblest sort And savour ; beasts of chase, or fowl of game, In pastry built, or from the spit, or boil'd, Gris-amber steam'd ; all fish from sea and shore, Freshet or purling brook for which was drained Pontus and Lucrine Bay and Afric Coast. MILTON A general welcome from his Grace Salutes ye all: this night he dedicates To fair content, and you : none here he hopes, In all this noble bevy, has brought with her One care abroad ; he would have all as merry, As first—good company, good wine, good welcome Can make good people. SHAKESPEARE, “ HENRY VIII ” % A hundred thousand welcomes; I could weep, And I could laugh ; I am light and heavy !— Welcome ! Shakespeare, “ coriolanus ” % Sir, you are very welcome to our house : It must appear in other ways than words ; Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy. SHAKESPEARE

MEAT, POULTRY, GAME. 106 spoonfuls of chili vinegar, and four of oil. Mix all well together; whip half a pint of cream, which add by degrees to the sauce, and pour over the salad; do not mix it till you help it. 278. Salmi de Chasseur. Roast three partridges as for other salmis ; put into a stew-pan three spoonfuls of oil, half a glass of claret, or other red wine, salt and pepper, cayenne, and the juice and zest of a lemon; put in the partridges previously cut up, toss them over the fire in this sauce till they are very hot, and serve. 279. Salmi A lâ€™Ancienne. Prepare three partridges, lard and roast them, let them be underdone; when cold cut them in pieces, take off the skin, pare and arrange them in a stew-pan, pour over a little stock, and set them to simmer; add six shallots and a little lemon-peel, also four large spoonfuls of re- duced espagnole (see Sauces), let it reduce half, pass the sauce through atammy. Take the trimmings and parings of the partridges, moisten them with a little of the sauce, pound them in a mortar as fine as possible, and rub through a tammy; pour this puree over the partridges in the stew-pan, heat it in a bain marie, arrange the salmi in a dish with fried croutons of bread between each piece, and pour the sauce very hot round. Pheasant is excellent dressed the same way, but should have the addition of a glass of red or white wine, the juice and a small bit of the peel of a Seville orange.

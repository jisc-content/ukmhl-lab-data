Put three handfuls of fine white oatmeal to steep a day and night in cold water; then pour the water off clear, and add as much more water; let it again stand the same time; then strain it through a fine hair sieve, and boil it till it is as thick as hasty pudding, stirring it all the time ; add to it, while boiling, a spoonful of sugar and two of orange-flower water. When ready, pour it into shallow dishes. Wine, milk, or cream are eaten with it. 821. Dutch Flummery.

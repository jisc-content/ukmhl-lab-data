Put a pint of new milk on the fire ; when it boils up pour in a glassful of wine—sherry or madeira; if one glassful is not enough, add more—it must be enough completely to turn the milk; let it boil up once, and set it aside till the curd subsides; pour the whey gently oft’, add a little boiling water, and sugar to taste. 840.

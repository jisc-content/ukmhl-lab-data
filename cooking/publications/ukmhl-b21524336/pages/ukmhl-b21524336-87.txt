FISH. 69 160. Filets de Sole A lâ€™Orlie. Clean tlie soles and cut them entirely open by the back from head to tail. Make each into four neat fillets, and steep them in lemon-juice, salt, parsley, and sliced onions. Shake them occasionally in this marinade, where they ought to remain an hour. When ready to serve, drain, dip them in flour, and fry till they are firm and of a good colour. Serve under them an Italienne or tomato sauce. (See Fish Sauces.) 161. A Good Way to Dress a Turbot. Lay the fish you are to boil in a pint of vinegar seasoned with salt, pepper, sliced onion, and a faggot of thyme, marjoram, and parsley. Leave it in an hour; then put the fish and pickle carefully into a fish-kettle of boiling water; add to it a few cloves, some mace, four or five anchovies, and a bit of horseradish. When done enough, take out your fish and let it drain; be careful it is not boiled too fast, and in only just enough liquor. For the sauce take half a pint of the well-strained liquor of a quart of oysters, half a pint of white wine, the flesh of the body of a lobster, a little mixed spices, a bit of lemon- peel, and two anchovies. Let it stew about twenty minutes, then strain and add a pound of butter, and as much flour as will make it a good thickness ; then put in the oysters, and the tail and claws of the lobster, previously boiled and cut in dice. Put the sauce on the stove again for a few minutes, and serve very hot. Cod and other fish are good dressed in the same way.

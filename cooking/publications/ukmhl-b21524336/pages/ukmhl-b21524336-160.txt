Large even potatoes should be chosen. 350. Potato Chips. Cut raw potatoes into neat round slices rather more than an inch thick, and then into thin spiral shavings, going round and round in the way you peel an apple ; throw these carefully into hot lard or oil; fry them very crisp of a light brown, and serve as hot as possible. A little salt should be sprinkled over them. 351. Potato Salad (German). Cut cold boiled rather waxy potatoes into moderately thick slices, put them in a bowl, and add to every pound a table-spoonful of vinegar, two of oil, half a teaspoonful of salt, a quarter of a one of pepper, and a little minced parsley. Slices of beet-root and Portugal onions are a great improvement to the salad. 352. To Stew Peas. The peas should be young. Put them, with a bit of butter, a sprig of mint, and one of parsley, tied together, and a lump of sugar, into a stew-pan, and cover them up close. Stew them till they are soft ; take out the mint and parsley; add a little stock and a pinch of flour; mix well together, and stew till they come to a boil.

320 PEPPER POT. This soup, which is of West Indian origin, should be made in an earthen pot, which always remains by the side of the fire, where the contents simmer but do not boil. These should consist of an equal admixture of fish, flesh, fowl, and vegetables, seasoned with chilis or Cayenne pepper and salt,â€” the only attention it requires being occasional skimming and the addition of a little water when it gets too dry. Anything and everything may be put into it; and as it should at all times be simmering by the fire, a good meal is always ready for any guest that may chance to come uninvited.

Let the whole simmer slowly nearly an hour and a half; now add to the whole, half a bottle of good claret, and continue to simmer for two hours longer, when it will be ready to serve. Care must be taken not to have too much fire, or it will become dry. 297. Filets de Lievre en Poivrade.

Place it in a stew-pan with some sauce poivrade (see Sauces) ; make it very hot, but do not let it boil, and serve with sippets of fried toast. i

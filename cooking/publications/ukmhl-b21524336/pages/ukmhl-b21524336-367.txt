Many people, however, leave them to cool in the water they were boiled in, pretending that you can then with a greater certainty know if they have been perfectly soldered; if this is the case the lid will be slightly depressed inwards, if not, it will be bulged outwards, and then they must be done over again. This also is a certain sign by which you may know, on examining the boxes (which you should do from time to time), if they are keeping well; any that are bulged should be immediately opened and used, if they are still fit for it.

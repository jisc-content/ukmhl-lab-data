Stew pared and cored apples in a saucepan over a slow fire, with a little bruised ginger, three or four cloves, a bit of lemon-peel, and some brown sugar. Boil a quarter of a pound of rice with a pint of milk or cream, an ounce of butter, two ounces of sugar, and half a lemon-peel grated; make it stiff enough to put round a dish. Put the apples in the centre, pour a custard over. Beat the whites of eight eggs to a stiff froth, which will take half an hour; place this over all, sprinlde with sugar, and bake in the oven a nice light brown. 591. Apples with Jelly. Take the largest apples you can get, peel and cut them in half, remove the core, and hollow them out a little, put them in a broad saucepan nearly full of water, turn them occasionally in the water, and when they are pretty soft take them out, drain and place them on the dish with the hollow side uppermost. When they are cold fill them with the following apple-jelly:â€”Take twenty golden pippins, pare and quarter them, leaving in the cores ; put them in a pipkin with a pint of spring water, and boil them till they are tender and sink to the bottom, then rub them through a colander. To every pint of the juice put half a pound of fine sifted sugar, and set it on to boil as fast as possible. When if begins to jelly, put in the juice of two lemons and a little cinnamon. The rind of a pine-apple boiled with the jelly is a great improvement.

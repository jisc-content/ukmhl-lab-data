The sauerkohl must be lightly pressed, and if very sour, washed, then placed in a well-tinned saucepan, with as much water as will cover it, an onion, and a piece of lard or goose-fat, and boiled slowly for from three to four hours; mix a little flour and butter together, stir it up with the cabbage, take out the onion, pour a glass of wine over it, and let it stew slowly a little while longer. Some people add sugar and apples to it; the great art in cooking it is that it should not be greasy, and neither too dry nor liquid. 27. Green or Eed Cabbage, with Chestnuts.

The sauce must afterwards be thickened with a little flour, and mixed carefully with the cabbage, which must again be set on the fire for a few minutes; mean- while the chestnuts must have been freed from both their shell and their skin, boiled tender in broth, with salt and sugar, then arranged in the middle of the dish, with the cabbage round it.

ADDITIONAL RECEIPTS. 342 the leg of the beaver to marinade for three or four days in vinegar, with slices of onions, carrots, turnips, some herbs, and spices. Then roast it, basting it continually with the marinade, till it is well done; at the last baste with sour cream, froth it, and serve. 50. Stewed Beaver’s Tail. This is considered a great delicacy, and is thus pre- pared :—Clean, and wash it well, and place it in a sauce- pan, with slices of onion, carrot, and turnip, one or two bay-leaves, a bunch of sweet herbs, some whole pepper, and a few slices of lemon from which the pips have been removed, add a little salt, two spoonfuls of vinegar, and as much red wine as will cover the whole. Let it stew slowly, often basting it with the sauce till very tender. Take it out, strain and skim the sauce, thicken it with brown roux, heat up again the beaver’s tail in it, and serve. 51. Puffer or Potato Pancake. Choose large sound well-flavoured potatoes, peel and wash them well, and grate them on an iron grater, then mix them in the proportion of from ten to twelve potatoes to half a pint of milk, a quarter of a pound of white bread, four eggs, two tablespoonfuls of thick sour cream, some salt, and not quite half an ounce of yeast. The grated potato should soak for an hour in cold water, and then be pressed in a cloth. Warm the bread and milk together, and well mix them ; set in a warm place to rise. The paste must not be made too thin, and should rise as high again, when it must be put into the frying-pan, with plenty of clarified butter and lard, half of each, or, what is still better, goose- flit. They must be fried a light brown, over a fire not too hot, so that they are neither raw nor dried up.

SOUPS. 15 FISH SOUPS. 27. Stock for Brown or White Fish Soup. Take a pound of skate, four or five flounders, and two pounds of eels; clean them well, and cut them into pieces; cover them with water, and season with mace, pepper, salt, an onion stuck with cloves, a head of celery, two parsley roots sliced, and a bunch of sweet herbs. Simmer all together in a stew-pan closely covered for an hour and a half, then strain it off for use. If for brown soup, first fry the fish brown in butter, and then proceed as above. It will not keep more than two or three days, and is best used quite fresh. 28. Salmon Soup. Take a fowl or an equivalent piece of veal, a piece of lean ham, a few anchovies, and half a pound of salmon ; put them all together in a stew-pan, with a piece of fresh butter, on the fire; let it stew for half an hour, taking care it does not brown; add three quarts of water, and skim well; add to it a head of celery, two or three onions, a little parsley, two or three cloves, and a little allspice and white pepper ; let it boil an hour and a half, and strain it through a lawn sieve ; then take a pan with a bit of butter and a spoonful of flour, stir them together till it comes to a light brown, then add the stock and stir till it boils ; take care and skim off all the butter; now stir in a piece of salmon, previously boiled, pounded, and rubbed through a tammy with a little cream, and if you have it, some lobster spawn, which gives it a fine colour. Have ready a slice of salmon, boiled quick in water;

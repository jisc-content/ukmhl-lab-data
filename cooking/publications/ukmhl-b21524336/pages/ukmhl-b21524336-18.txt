Having given this specimen of a German fine dinner, it may not be unamusing to an English sportsman to read what their German brethren con- sider necessary for their sustenance on a shooting expedition. This is a verbatim translation from a celebrated German cookery-book, to which German housewives have much recourse, and in which they place great faith :— ‘ JAGD FKUHSTUCK. * A Shooting Breakfast or Luncheon. * Gentlemen usually prefer eating this about the middle of the day, in the open air, with their fingers, in order that they may lose no time; so it is not generally necessary to send knives and forks or tablecloths ; but you must take care, in order not to make them angry, that the luncheon is there at the right place and time.

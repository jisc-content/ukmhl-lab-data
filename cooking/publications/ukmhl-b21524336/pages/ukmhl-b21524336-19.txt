PREFACE. XV * This luncheon should, in the first place, consist of bread and butter,—a penny-loaf cut in two is the best. (Of these each gentleman should be allowed four.) You are to fill them with different sorts of meat, veal, ham, pork-rolls, and sausages, or cheese, or these and other such things may be cut in thin slices and offered on plates. A large cold pie or sausage should also always be sent, as well as a cake cut up, and two or three pieces reckoned for each gentleman. Apples, eggs, pepper, and salt must also not be forgotten. ‘ For drink, both red and white light wine, as well as Port and Madeira, should he served, and, particularly in cold weather, punch and mulled wine, which ought to be sent in jugs with a woollen cover over them, that they may be kept as hot as possible; not less than half a bottle is to be allowed for each gentleman. * Also for the gamekeepers, should be allowed as much bread and butter as for their masters, but of a commoner sort, and with only one kind of meat and cheese, and to each half a bottle of ordinary wine.

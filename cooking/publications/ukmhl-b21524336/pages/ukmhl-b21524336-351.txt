323 ADDITIONAL RECEIPTS. 6. Brown Mustard Sauce. Melt in a saucepan a piece of butter, add to it a finely minced sbalot and as much flour as will thicken, stir till it has acquired a fine yellow colour, add some good brown gravy, a spoonful of wine vinegar, some salt and sugar; stir till it is smooth, pass it through a sieve, and work into it three or four spoonfuls of mustard. This is good both with boiled meats and fish. 7. Eel Soup, a Hamburgh Receipt. Set three or four pounds of beef on to boil, with salt and sufficient water to cover it well; skim it carefully. After it has boiled an hour, add to it a soup-plateful of the fol- lowing vegetable roots cut in dice :â€”Carrots, turnips, celeriac_(or the turnip-rooted celery), and parsley-root, but only half as much of this last as of each of the others. Now put in, all cut fine, a handful of young celery leaves (those from the heart), the same of parsley and majoram, half a handful of thyme, burnet, and sorrel, a few leaves of tarragon, sage, and leeks. Let the soup stew two hours longer, and add a soup-plateful of young shelled peas, some cauliflower, and a few pears with their skins on. If the pears are not to be had, a few French plums may be added at the same time as the roots. Meanwhile boil two pounds of eel (leaving the skin on, cut in pieces, but omit the head and point of the tail), in salt and water till tender, then add them, with the water they were boiled in, to the soup; melt a good piece of butter, to which you add a large spoonful of flour, beating together over the lire till it acquires a fine colour ; stir this into the soup just before serving, season with pepper, a teaspoonful of sugar, and a tablespoonful of vinegar.

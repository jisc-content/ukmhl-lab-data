236 BAKING. then put it into the pan with the rest of the water and two ounces of hops ; let it boil twenty minutes, strain it into a large jar, and add to it by degrees, that it may be well mixed, a pint of flour. Let it stand till it is about milk-warm, and then pour into it a bottle of yeast. Let it stand ten hours in a warm place, when it may be bottled and is fit for use. This yeast must not be kept in too cold a place. In making bread you must use at least two-thirds more than of common yeast. There cannot be a better method. 655. To Clarify Yeast. Take a quart of yeast; put it in two gallons of cold water ; let it remain one night. By the next morning the yeast will have fallen to the bottom. Drain off the water, and any yeast that may be floating on the top. Your yeast will now be white and sweet. When it is to be used, mix about half a handful of bran with it, and then strain from the bran through a sieve into the flour you are going to make your bread of. This makes it perfectly sweet. 656. To make Fine Bread or Bolls. To three pounds of flour add one pint of warm milk and a quarter of a pint of clarified yeast; stir it thinly into part of the flour, and leave it all night. Next morning warm another pint of milk; add it to the flour and yeast, stir it round a few times, and then work in lightly the rest of the flour ; let it remain half an hour, then make up your rolls. Let them rise till they are quite light, and bake in a hot oven. This paste for loaf-bread should be made somewhat stiffer than for rolls.

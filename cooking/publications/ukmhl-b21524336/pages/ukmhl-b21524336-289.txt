LIQUEURS, CUPS, ETC. 261 cask to work for three weeks more, then acid to every six gallons of vine one quart of good brandy, and close up the cask; it should stand at least six months before it is bottled. If made with white currants, it closely resembles champagne, and a pint more juice to the same quantity of water should be used. The currants should be picked clean from the stalks, slightly bruised, so as not to break the seeds, and the juice strained through a hair sieve. This is an excellent receipt. 730. Green Gooseberry Wine. Pick from the stalks and bruise the gooseberries, and to every pound of them add one quart of water; let it stand three days, stirring twice a-day; then strain it; and to every gallon of juice put three pounds of loaf-sugar; barrel it, and to every five gallons of the wine allow a bottle of brandy and a piece of isinglass ; bung the cask, and in six months, if the sweetness is gone off, but longer if not, bottle it. 731. Raspberry Vinegar. Mash two quarts of raspberries; put them in a dish, and cover them with white wine vinegar; let them stand twelve hours or more, then run the juice through a jelly- bag ; to each pint allow two pounds of sugar, which you have previously pounded, melted in a little water, and clarified with the whites of four eggs. When it boils, skim it well, and add it to the juice. Let the whole boil half an hour, and when cold, bottle; cork, seal it over, and keep in a cool dry place.

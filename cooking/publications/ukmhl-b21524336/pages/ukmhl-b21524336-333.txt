DAIRY—CHEESE, BUTTER, etc. ♦ S49. To Prepare Rennet. Take a calf’s maw and turn it out of tlie bag; then take nutmeg crushed small, a large handful of sweet bay leaves minced, and a large handful of salt; when well mixed together put it into the bag. Boil a strong pickle of salt and water; when cold, pour three pints of it over the bag; cover it up, turning it every day for a fortnight, and pricking it with a fork ■ then squeeze it all through a cloth, and bottle for use. A few nettles boiled with the water are considered an improvement. Or it may be prepared thus:—Take out the stomach of a calf just killed, and scour it well with salt and water both inside and out; let it drain ; put two large handfuls of salt in it, and sew it up; dry it, and soak a bit in fresh water when wanted; or it may be left wet in the salt and water. 850. A Cream Cheese. Dip a cheese-cloth in salt and water; take the thickest cream you have; lay it in a shape (which should be square); pour the cream in, and leave it untouched one day ; then turn it on to a dry cloth, and put a weight of four pounds on it; change the dry cloth once more. On the third day it is ready to eat. x

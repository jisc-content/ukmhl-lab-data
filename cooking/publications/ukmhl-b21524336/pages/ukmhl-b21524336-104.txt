76 FISH. spoonful or two of curry powder, a bit of butter rolled in flour, and four spoonfuls of rich cream. Season to taste, with salt and cayenne. Stew it slowly till done. Serve with rice, or in a rice border. 205. Kedgeree. Boil a breakfast-cupful of rice twenty minutes, and four eggs ten minutes. Take any kind of cooked white fish; pull it in pieces; take care there are no bones left; chop the eggs very fine ; add three or four ounces of fresh butter ; season with salt and cayenne pepper (fresh green minced chilis are better). Beat the whole together, and serve as hot as possible. A little chutnee sauce eaten with it is a great improvement. 206. Oysters Stewed (American Way). Take a dozen large oysters in their own liquor ; let them just boil; add salt, pepper, a piece of butter the size of a nutmeg, and half a teaspoonful of chopped chervil. 207. Another American Way. Open a dozen oysters ; put them in a small stew-pan with two grains of black pepper, a pinch of sugar, a little salt butter, and cayenne. Set them on the stove for three or four minutes ; give them just a slight boil, and put in a bit of butter the size of a walnut, which you have previously mixed with half a teaspoonful of flour. Shake the stew-pan round till it is melted; put the pan again on the fire to simmer for a minute or two. Serve very hot on toast. Any quantity may be done in the same way. A little cream is an improvement.

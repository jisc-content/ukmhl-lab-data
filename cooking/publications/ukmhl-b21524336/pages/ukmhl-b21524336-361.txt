Place, in a large, rather shallow frying-pan, a piece of ribs of pork, cover it half over with water, add some salt, cover the pan closely, and let it cook on a moderate fire for from an hour to an hour and a quarter; it should get quite brown, then take it out, cover the pan with slices of peeled potatoes, cut round, and then lay the ribs again on this, with their hollow side up, but do not forget first to sprinkle the potatoes with a little salt and pepper,â€”now fill the hollow side of the ribs with good sour cooking apples, peeled, cored, and cut in four pieces, pour a cup of water over all, cover the pan again closely, and let them cook slowly, turning them over till the potatoes are soft and brown. Serve in a deep dish, garnishing the meat with the apples and potatoes. 32. Potatoes and Apples. Wash and peel the potatoes, cut them in pieces; peel, core, and cut in quarters the same quantity of sour apples; parboil the potatoes in water, with some salt, strain them, add the apples, a good piece of butter and a little water, stir them often, and let them cook till quite tender.

Young Carrots and Green Peas. Wash and clean young carrots, cut them lengthways in four or five pieces, shell and wash the same quantity in proportion of young green peas; boil both together in broth,

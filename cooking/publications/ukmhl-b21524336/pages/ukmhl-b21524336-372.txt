ADDITIONAL RECEIPTS. 344 cold, grated, and the grate carefully weighed ; the butter must be beaten to a cream, then the sugar, almonds, lemon, and cinnamon added ; the yolks of eggs must be stirred in by degrees, and then the potatoes. When the mass has been thoroughly mixed, work in first the bread- crumbs, and then the firmly whipt whites of the eggs. The pudding may be either baked in a mould for one hour, or boiled for two, and served with either a wine or fruit sauce, such as strawberry or cherry juice. This is enough for sixteen persons. It is highly to be recom- mended. 55. Grape Pudding. A quarter of a pound of butter, the same of finely pounded almonds, eight eggs, two ounces of sifted sugar, a little cinnamon and lemon-peel, three-quarters of a pound of the crumb of white bread, and a soup-plateful of picked grapes, which are better if not quite ripe. Soak the bread in cold milk, and squeeze it; beat the butter to a cream, mix the yolks of the eggs, the sugar, spice, and bread, beat it well, and then stir in lightly the grapes and the whites of the eggs, previously whipped to a strong froth ; put the mass into a buttered mould, and let it boil or steam for two hours, and serve with the following sauce :â€”Two fresh eggs well beaten, a glass of wine, a tea- spoonful of flour, two tablespooufuls of pounded sugar, a little whole cinnamon, and a slice or two of lemon. Whisk all this together over a sharp fire till it comes to a strong froth, when it just begins to boil, take it immediately off the fire, as it would spoil if it boiled, take out the lemon and cinnamon, continue to beat it for a moment, pour it into the sauce boat, and serve. These quantities make pudding and sauce sufficient for eight persons.

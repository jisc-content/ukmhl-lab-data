COOKERY FOR THE SICK AND POOR. â€¢f96 817. To make Arrowroot. For one cupful take a teaspoonful of the best arrowroot, and mix it by degrees with cold water till it is quite smooth, but so stiff that the spoon will only just turn round in it; have ready a kettle of quite boiling water, and fill the cup up, pouring at first slowly and then more rapidly, and stirring all the time in the same proportion. The result should be a perfectly clear jelly, to which you may add a tablespoonful of brandy or sherry, or flavour it with lemon, and sweeten with sugar to taste. It is much better made in this way than boiled. 818. Porridge. Fill a pan with water, and while it is boiling add a little meal and as much salt as you think will be necessary to season the porridge ; then take the porridge-stick (a round stick like a thin rolling-pin) in the right hand and the oatmeal in the left, and when the water begins to rise shake in the meal with one hand and stir with the other quickly, but adding the meal by degrees ; continue putting it in till it is thick enough not to fly over when stirred; continue to boil it for some time, well beating it with the porridge-stick. It may be made thinner or thicker according to taste. Barley-meal por- ridge is made in the same way, and should be served in a soup plate, which is better than a wooden bowl, in which oatmeal porridge is best. They are both eaten with milk and cream, or ale and brown sugar. Nothing is so wholesome and nourishing for children.

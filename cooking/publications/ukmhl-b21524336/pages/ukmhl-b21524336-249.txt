221 PUDDINGS, JELLIES, PASTRY, ETC. 605. Apple-Jelly. Reduce two pounds of juicy apples boiled witb a teacupful of water, rub them through a sieve, add half a pound of sugar, the juice of two and the peel of one lemon. Have ready half an ounce of isinglass boiled in half a pint of water to a jelly, add it to the apples, and boil all together ; strain it, take out the lemon-peel, and pour it into your mould ; set it in a cool place. If half an ounce of isinglass is not enough to stiffen it, more may be added; but as little as possible should always be used. Pine-apple is an excellent addition. 60 6. Red Strawberry-Jelly. To a pint and a half of calvesâ€™-foot jelly add, when melted, two spoonfuls of cochineal; arrange whole strawberries in the mould; pour in the jelly; when cold and set turn it out. Other fruit may be done in the same way. 607. Raspberry-Jelly. Put the fruit into a mortar, with a sufficiency of sugar to sweeten it; mix together, and add a little water. When all the juice is extracted pass it through a jelly- bag, add isinglass to stiffen it (the quantity depends upon how much fruit you have), then put it into a mould, with ice over and under. No salt must be mixed with the ice. When set, turn it out. Do not bruise the fruit too much, or the small seeds will spoil the flavour. Strawberry and currant may be done the same.

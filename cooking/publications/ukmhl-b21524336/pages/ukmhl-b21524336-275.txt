A quarter of a pound of butter to two pounds of oat- meal, then add as much water as will just work them together, but the less the better, and hot water is best; roll them out with a rolling-pin as thin as possible. One side should be done on the girdle and the other on the toaster. Oat cakes may also be made without any butter, mixed with hot water, and a pinch of salt added.

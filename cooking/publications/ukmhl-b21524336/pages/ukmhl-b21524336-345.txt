VARIOUS RECEIPTS FOR MAKING COFFEE. 317 strong linen bag, sewn to a ring which fits into the top of the pot; the coffee is placed in the bag, which is shaped like a funnel, and boiling water poured over it; it runs through quite clear. Care should be taken to scald the bag every time it is used. Many prefer the bag to be made of flannel, or use bothâ€”one inside the other, the first being made rather shorter. In Germany I have seen a very ingenious coffee-machine for making coffee yourself in the drawing-room. It consists of two vases, one of glass and the other of china; the latter is stopped close with a cork at the top, and is provided with a tap to draw the coffee off; the two are connected -with a syphon, which passes into both, and the end in the glass vase is fitted with a fine strainer ; a balancing weight is also attached on the side of the glass vase. The requisite quantity of coffee is placed in the glass, the water in the china vase; a lamp is then lit under the latter ; as the water boils, the pressure of the confined steam forces the water up the syphon and into the glass vase ; as the water as- cends, the weight being removed from the china vase, it rises, and the lamp underneath, which is also pro- vided with a cover and a balancing weight, is ex- tinguished by the cover falling on it; at the same time the strainer at the end of the syphon descends and presses the coffee down, the water forces itself through the coffee, and bubbles up in the glass. The atmospheric air now meets it coining through the hole down which the syphon passes, and forces the coffee back into the china vase, which, as the weight falls into it, again de- scends into its original place, and the coffee is ready to be drawn off clear and good. It may be passed in tins

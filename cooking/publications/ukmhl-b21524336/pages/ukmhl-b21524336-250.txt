If the peaches are very fine you may leave them almost raw.

Choose a plain mould, and pour some into it, and set it on the ice ; when quite firm drop the peaches on to the jelly, and lay the kernels between ; pour some more jelly over, and let it freeze ; then fill the mould gently, and again put it on the ice. A great quantity of ice, with some salt, should be round the mould, as this jelly is very delicate and extremely liable to break. 609. Cr£me au Gelee. Take half a pint of jelly and half a pint of cream; the jelly must be warm ; whip them well together, till it is about milk-warm; put it into a mould, and set it in a cool place.

Three-quarters of a pint of thin cream, the yolks of six eggs, a small quantity of lemon-peel, a teaspoonful of arrowroot, one laurel-leaf, and as much loaf-sugar as will

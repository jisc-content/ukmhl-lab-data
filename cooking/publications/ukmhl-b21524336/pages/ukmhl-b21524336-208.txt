PUDDINGS, JELLIES, PASTRY, ETC. ISO a little nutmeg, and some sugar. Bake in a dish or shape lined with puff-paste half an hour. 487. Bread-and-Butter Pudding. Cut thin slices of bread and butter, and lay them in a well-buttered mould or pudding-dish; between each layer strew currants and a little powdered cinnamon and sugar ; fill your dish or mould thus three parts full, and pour in a oold custard made with four or six eggs (according to the size of the pudding), beaten up with cream or milk, and flavoured with lemon-peel; pour it in by little at a time so that the bread may absorb it without floating ; when full, bake one hour. If wished rather richer, when made in a mould, a little wine or brandy may be poured on the bread before the custard. • 488. Batter Pudding. Two spoonfuls of fine flour, the whites of two eggs and yolk of one, with milk enough to moisten; beat well together and boil twenty minutes. Serve with wine- sauce, or eat it with cold butter and brown sugar, which is much the best. 489. Batter Pudding Baked. Take six ounces of fine flour, three eggs, and a pinch of salt; add by degrees as much milk as will when well beaten make it the consistence of thick cream. Pour into a pudding-dish, and bake three-quarters of an hour ; or it may be boiled in a basin, buttered and floured, and tied up in a cloth. It will require two hours’ boiling.

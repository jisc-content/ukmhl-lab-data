PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION. xxi inclined to dispute. Now, by what is called plain cooking, per se, she understands Roasting, Broiling, Baking, and Boiling; and if these are well done, nobody can justly complain of having a bad dinner. How much rather would not any one prefer a well- broiled mutton-chop—brovjn, tender, and succulent— tempting you, by its appearance, to eat, even as much as that of the other deterred you from the attempt! So with a joint of well-roasted beef, or mutton, and well boiled or baked potatoes; if not appetising, they at least satisfy your hunger without nauseating, and you cannot say you have dined badly, though your dinner has not been very recherchd But there are occasions when even a good appetite palls, upon the too frequent repetition of such heavy viands, and when that of the delicate invalid will turn with loathing from such solid, though wholesome food, It is then, the writer hopes, reference will be made to this little volume of “ Dainty Dishes,” and that the good appetite may be gratified, and the delicate one renovated.

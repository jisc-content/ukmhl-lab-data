SAUCES. 28 62. Balbirnie Salad Sauce. Two eggs boiled twenty-five minutes and well bruised, two spoonfuls of salt, two yolks of raw fresh eggs, eight tablespoonfuls of oil, mixed slowly in a cup with a wooden spoon. When half the oil is mixed in, a little at a time, add half a teaspoonful of mustard, and then the remainder of the oilâ€”by so doing it will become as thick as a paste; then add two tablespoonfuls of French tarra- gon vinegar, and mix well. This is excellent to eat with beetroot. 63. German Salad Sauce. Six tablespoonfuls of oil, and eight of the best vinegar, two of tarragon vinegar, and one of chili, and a small quantity of cayenne pepper ; stir together and mix well with the salad. The red wine vinegar of Germany and olive-oil, mixed in the proportion of one tablespoonful of vinegar to two of oil, and a little salt and pepper, makes the best possible summer salad sauce. 64. Salad Sauce. The yolk of one hard-boiled egg mixed with one raw one and a little water, a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of mixed cayenne and black pepper, and one of mustard, a tablespoonful of vinegar, one of anchovy sauce, and five of either oil or thick cream.

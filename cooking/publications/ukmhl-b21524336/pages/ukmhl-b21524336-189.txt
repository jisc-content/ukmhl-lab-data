EGGS, CHEESE, ENTREMETS, ETC. 1G1 435. Omelette aux Fines Herbes. Break six very fresli eggs into a basin; add a teaspoon- ful of salt, a quarter one of pepper, two of minced parsley, and half a one of minced onion; beat them well together. Put into a clean dry frying-pan two ounces of butter; set it on the fire, and when the butter is hot pour in the eggs. Keep mixing quickly with a spoon till it is lightly set, then tilt the pan sideways so as to let the omelette slip to the edge, which will make it of an oval shape. Let it set a minute, and turn it over on to a hot dish and serve. If you wish it to be flavoured with parmesan or grayere cheese leave out the parsley and onions, and put two tablespoonfuls of the cheese grated to the eggs. 436. Buttered Eggs. Put in a stew-pan two ounces of butter; break four fresh eggs into it; add a tablespoonful of chopped mushrooms or truffles, half a teaspoonful of salt, and a quarter one of pepper. Set it on the fire and stir continually with a wooden spoon till it is of a good consistency. Have ready some slices of buttered toast on a hot dish ; pour the eggs on to them, and serve. 437. Eggs A la Bonne Femme. Cut a middle-sized onion in dice ; fry them in a stew-pan with a pat of butter a light brown ; add a teaspoonful of vinegar when done; then butter a dish lightly, spread the onions over it, break the eggs into it, and put the dish in the oven. When the eggs are done, strew them over with fried bread-crumbs, and serve very hot. M

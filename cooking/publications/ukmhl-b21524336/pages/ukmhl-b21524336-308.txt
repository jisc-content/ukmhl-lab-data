Stone and peel the apricots ; take equal weight of sugar and fruit; clarify and boil the sugar to candy; put in the apricots, and let them boil very quick till they are well broke, and bruise them a little with a spoon ; blanch the kernels and add them. A little white currant jelly boiled with the apricots is also an improve- ment. Take the pan off, and when the jam is cool, pot and tie it down. Greengages and other plums may be made into jam in the same way. 770. CompOte dâ€™Abricots. Take apricots nearly ripe ; remove the stone without breaking them ; put them in a pan of water on the fire, but do not let them boil; for every twenty-five apricots take a pound of sugar ; clarify it, and put in the apricots; set them on a very slow fire, that the sugar may incor- porate ; when quite tender, they are done. If they are to be preserved for future use, drain them, boil the syrup next day, and pour it, when cold, over the fruit; con- tinue doing this for five days, adding each time a little more sugar, as it is necessary the fruit should be quite covered with the syrup. On the last day put the apricots into the boiling sugar, and give them a gentle boil; skim them well; and peaches and quinces may be done in the same way, either for present use or to keep a year.

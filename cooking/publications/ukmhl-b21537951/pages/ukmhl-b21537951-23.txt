Preserving Pan, for making Bain-marie Pan and Pots, for jams, jellies, marmalades, &x. keeping sauces and entrees hot, &c. Stock-pot. Braising Pan.—The food to be braised is put into the lower part of the pan. The lid is covered well with red-hot ashes or charcoal. Full directions for braising are given farther on. The stew-pdVi is a valu- able utensil; it will in case of need serve as a braising pan, if the lid be made to go a little into the edge of the pan as some are made. Stock Pot.—The stock pot receives in it bones, trimmings of meat, remains of cold game, &c. &c., in short everything available for ordinary or good soup. It is to be wished that every English artizan’s wife possessed one ; it is the pot-aufeu of the French workman, who thus obtains nourish- ing soup and well-dressed meat at the same time.

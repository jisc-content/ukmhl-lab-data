Hints to Housekeepers. 7 boiled. Tlie scrag end of mutton is very good stewed with rice. Lamb should be small; of a pale eoloured red, and fat. Lamb is generally roasted. The leg of “house lamb" (which is in season just before Cliristmas), is sometimes boiled and served with white sauce. Venison.—Venison is not very often bought, but when it is you can tell as to its being “high” or not, by running a skewer I into the shoulder, and observing the scent | on it when withdrawn. The fat should be thick and clean. If the cleft of the haunch is smooth and close, the animal is young. Pork. — Buy pork of a respectable butcher ; or get it from some place where you know it has been carefully fed ; from a dairy farm is the best place, or from a miller’s, or even from some country neigh- bour, as diseased or bad pork is very dan- gerous food. The fat of pork should be firm, and the lean white, and finely grained. The rind or skin thin and smooth. If the flesh feels clammy to the touch the pork is bad. If the fat has kernels in it the pig has . been measly, and the meat should not be eaten. Pork should be perfectly sweet to I be good, therefore do not hang it long. The PIG is divided thus :— 1. Spare rib. 2. liand. I' 3- P'elly- 1 4. Fore 'oin, 5. Hind loin. 6. Leg.

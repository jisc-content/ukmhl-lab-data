A calf's head is a delicacy. Calf’s feet are also valuable boiled, stewed, or used for jelly. Veal makes the best stock for rich soups and gravies. It is a most useful meat for made dishes of all kinds, on account of its delicate flavour. Mutton.—Wether mutton is the best. It may be known by its having a knob of fat on the upper part of the leg. It should be dark coloured and have plenty of fat. The colour is important, as it is a proof of age, and the older mutton is the better it is. It should, properly, be the flesh of a sheep four or five years old, to be in perfection, but such meat is rarely to be bought at a butcher’s ; one tastes it only at the houses ol country gentlemen who kill their own animals. All the joints of a sheep may be roasted. The saddle is the best. The haunch is next best to the saddle ; it is the leg and loin undivided. The leg and neck are fre- quently boiled. The leg and loin, sepa- rated, are the best joints after the haunch. Chops are cut from the loin ; cutlets from the thick end of the loin, best end of the neck, or middle of the leg. The leg is sometimes cured and smoked as a ham. The breast of mutton is often salted and A DEER is cut up in four portions. I. Haunch, 8. Neck. L 3. Shoulder. 4. Breast.

Kitchen Utensils. 12 KITCHEN UTENSILS. The young and inexperienced house- keeper will, we believe, be glad of some guidance in the selection of the utensils needed in her kitchen, so that she may not be at the mercy of those who desire more than is really required, or who are ignorant of the necessity and use of many articles of the first importance in the art.

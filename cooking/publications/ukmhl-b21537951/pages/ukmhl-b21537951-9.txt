PREFACE. This Edition of the Model Cookery Book for the People has been carefully adapted to the use of housekeepers of moderate means. The receipts are, therefore, as inexpensive as possible, though care and atten- tion should be given to their preparation (as indeed to all cooking) if they are to prove a success. Good Cookery h in itself economical, as it makes the best of its materials and creates no waste; and the careful preparation of ordinary dishes will soon give sufficient skill for the execution of more difficult branches of the art. Indeed, omelets and soufflds, which are often thought beyond the skill of ordinary cooks, may be admirably achieved by a little care and practice; and it is to be wished that the omelet, especially, oftener found a place upon our table. ' Receipts for a few more expensive dishes have been added for home entertainments, and as occasional practice for those 'who desire to progress in the art. The book has also been revised, some now old-fashioned suggestions have been removed, and a fresh receipt has occasionally replaced the old ones. The Publishers hope that this New Edition may receive the same favour from the public that its predecessors obtained.

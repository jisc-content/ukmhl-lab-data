BAKING BISCUITS AND CAKES. An oven to bake well should have a re- gular heat throughout, but particularly at the bottom, without which bread or cakes will not rise, or bake well. An earthen basin is best for beating eggs, or cake mixture. Cake should be beaten with a wooden spoon, or spatula ; butter may be beaten with -the same. Eggs should be beaten with rods, or a broad fork ; a silver fork, or one made of iron wire, is best, as it is broadest ; eggs should be clear and fresh for a cake. It is well, as a general rule in cake mak- ing, to beat the butter and sugar (which must be made fine) to a light cream ; indeed, in the making of pound cake, the lightness of the cake depends as much upon this as upon the eggs being well beaten ; then beat tire eggs and put them to the butter, and gradually add the flour and other ingre- dients, beating it all the time. In common cakes, where only a few eggs .arc used, beat them until you can take a spoonful up clear from strings. In receipts in which milk is used as one ingredient, either sweet or sour may be used, but not a mixture of both. Sour milk makes a spongy light cake ; sweet milk makes a cake which cuts like pound cake. To blanch almonds, pour boiling water on them, and let them remain in it until the skins may be taken off; then throw the almonds into cold water to whiten them, drain them from the water, but do not wipe them ; the moisture will prevent their oiling. In making cakes, if you wish them to be pleasing to the palate, use double-refined sugar, although light brown sugar m.akes .a very good cake. For icing cakes, the sugar must be rolled and sifted, or pounded in a mortar. To ascertain whether a cake is baked enough, if a small one, take a very fine splint of wood and run it through the thickest part ; if not done enough, some of the doughj or unbaked cake will be found stickingto it; if done, it will come out clean.

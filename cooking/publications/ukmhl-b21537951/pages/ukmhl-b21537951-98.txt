Pick and singe the fowl; cut off the neck close to the back ; take out the crop, and with the middle finger loosen the liver and other parts ; cut off the vent, draw it clean, and beat the breastbone flat with a rolling- pin. Cut off the nails of the feet and tuck them down close to the legs. Put your finger into the inside and raise the skin of the fowl, then cut a hole in the top of the skin, and put tlie legs under. Put a skewer in the first joint of the pinion and bring the middle of the leg close to it; put the skewer through the middle of the leg and through the body ; do the same on the other side ; open the gizzard, remove the contents, and wash well, remove the gall bladder from the liver. Pat the gizzard and liver in the pinions, '.urn the points of the pinions on the back, and tie a string over the tops of the legs to keep them in their proper places. To Boil Fowls or Chickens.

When done, put them on a hot disli, remove the skewers, and pour over them a little parsley and butter, oyster, lemon, celery, or white sauce, serving the sauce also separately in a tureen.

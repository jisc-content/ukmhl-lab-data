135 SAVOURY PIES. Bake a crust over a dish, with a little lining round the edge, and a cup turned up to keep it from sinking. When baked, open the lid and pour in the stew. Parsley pie. Lav a fowl or a few bones of the scrag of veal sea- soned, into a dish : scald a colander-full of picked pars- ley, in milk; season, and add to it the fowl or meat, with a tea-cupful of any sort of good broth, or weak gravy. When it is baked, pour it into a quarter of a pint of cream scalded, with the size of a walnut of but- ter, and a little flour. Shake it round to mix with the gravy already in. Lettuces, white mustard leaves, or spinach, may be added to the parsley, and scalded before put in. Turnip pie.

Put two or three good spoonfuls of milk in. You may add sliced onion. Cover with a crust. Potatoe pie. Skin some potatoes, and cut them into slices: season them: and also some mutton, beef, pork, or veal. Put layers of them and of the meat. An Herb pie.

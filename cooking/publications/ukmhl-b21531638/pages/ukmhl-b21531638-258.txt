1S1 DOMESTIC COOKEDY. [Repeat tlie boiling vinegar, and stop them up again in- stantly ; and so on till green; the last time put pepper and ginger. Keep in small stone jars. To Pickle young Cucumbers. Choose nice young gherkins, spread them on dishes, salt them, and let them lie a week—drain them, andput- tingthem in ajar, pour boiling vinegar over them.

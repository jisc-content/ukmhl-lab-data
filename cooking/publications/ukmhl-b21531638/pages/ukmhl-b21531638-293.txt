SWEETMEATS. 219 on a quick fire a quarterof an hour. Grate a little lemon- peel before boiled, but if too much it will be bitter. Apple Jelly for preserving Apricots, or for any sort of Sweetmeats. Let apples be pared, quartered and cored ; put them into a stew-pan with as much water as will cover them; boil as fast as possible; when the fruit is all in a mash add a quart of water; boil half an hour more, and run through a jelly-hag. If in summer, codlins are best; in September, gol- den rennets, or winter-pippins. Heel Apples in Jelly. Pare and core some well-shaped apples; pippins or golden rennets if you have them, but others will do; throw them into water as you do them; put them in a preserving-pan, and with as little water as will only half cover them ; let them coddle, and when the lower side is done, turn them. Observe that they do not lie too close when first put in. Mix some pounded cochi- neal with the water, and boil with the fruit. When sufficiently done, take them out on the dish they are to be served in, the stalk downwards. Take the water and make a rich jelly of it with loaf-sugar, boiling the thin rind and juice of a lemon. When come to a jelly, let it grow cold, and put it on and among the apples; cut the peel of a lemon in narrow strips, and across the eye of the apple. Observe that the colour he fine from the first, or the fruit will not afterwards gain it; and use as little of the cochineal as will serve, lest the syrup taste bitter. Dried Apples. Put them in a cool oven six or seven times, and flat- ten them by degrees, and gently, when soft enough to bear it. If the oven be too hot they will waste; and at first it should be very cool. The biffin, the minshul crab, or any tart apples, are the sorts for drying. To preserve Jargonelle Pears most beautifully. Pare them very thin, and simmer in a thin syrup;

CAKES. 233 be thoroughly and long beaten, as the lightness of the cake depends much on their being well incorporated. Whether black or white plum-cakes, they require less butter and eggs for having yeast, and eat equally light and rich. If theleven be only of flour, milk and water, and yeast, it becomes more tough, and is less easily di- vided than if the butter be first put with those ingre- dients, and the dough afterwards set to rise by the fire. The heat of the oven is of great importance for cakes, especially those that are large. If not pretty quick, the batter will not rise. Should you fear its catching by being too quick, put some paper over the cake to prevent its being burnt. If not long enough lighted to have a body of heat, or it is become slack, the cake will be heavy. To know when it is soaked, take a broad-bladed knife that is very bright, and plunge into the very centre, draw it instantly out, and if the least stickiness adheres, put the cake immediately in, and shut up the oven. If the heat was sufficient to raise, but not to soak, I have with great success, bad fresh fuel quickly put in, and kept the cakes hot till the oven was fit to finish the soaking, and they turned out extremely well. But those who are employed ought to be particularly care- ful that no mistake occurs from negligence when large cakes are to be baked. Icing for Cakes. For a large one, beat and sift eight ounces of fine sugar, put into a mortar with four spoonfuls of rose- water, with the whites of two eggs beaten and strained, whisk it well, and when the cake is almost cold, dip a feather in the icing, and cover the cake well; set it in the oven to harden, but don’t let it stay to discolour. Put the cake into a dry place. To ice a very large Cake. Beat the whites of twenty fresh eggs ; then by de- grees beat a pound of double refined sugar sifted through a lawn-sieve; mix these well in a deep earthen ^an; add orange-flower • water, and a piece of fresh

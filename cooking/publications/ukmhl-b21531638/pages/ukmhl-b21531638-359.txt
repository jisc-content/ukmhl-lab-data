SICK-COOKEEY. 235 French Milk Porridge. Stir some oatmeal and water together; let it stand to be clear, and pour off the latter; pour fresh upon it, stir it well, let it stand till next day; strain through a fine sieve, and boil the water, adding milk while doing. The proportion of water must be small. This is much ordered, with toast, for the breakfast of weak persons abroad. Ground-Bice Milk. Boil one spoonful of ground-rice, rubbed down smooth, with three half pints of milk, a bit of cinna- mon, lemon-peel, and nutmeg. Sweeten when nearly done. Sago. To prevent the earthy taste, soak it in cold water an hour ; pour that off, and wash it well; then add more, and simmer gently till the berries are clear, with le- mon-peel and. spice, if approved. Add wine and sugar, and boil all up together. Sago Milk. Cleanse as above, and boil it slowly and wholly with new milk. It swells so much, that a small quantity will be sufficient for a quart, and when done it will be diminished to about a pint. It requires no sugar or flavouring. Asses' Milk Far surpasses any imitation of it that can be made. It should be milked into a glass that is kept warm, by being in a bason of hot water. The fixed air that it contains gives some people a pain in the stomach. At first, a tea-spoonful of rum may be taken with it, but should only be put in the moment it is to be swallowed. Artificial Asses' Milk. Boil together a quart of water, a quart of new milk, an ounce of white sugar-candy, half an ounce of eringo- root, and half an ounce of conserve of roses, till half be wasted.

To collar Pig's Head. Scour the head and ears nicely ; take off the hair and snout, and take out the eyes and the brain; lay it into water one night; then drain, salt it extremely well with common salt and saltpetre, and let it lie five days. Boil it enough to take out the bones; then lay it on a dresser, turning the thick end of one side of the head towards the thin end of the other, to make the roll ot equal size ; sprinkle itwell withsalt and white pepper, androll it with the ears ; and if you approve, put the pig’s feet round the outside when boned, or the thin parts of two cow-heels. Put it in a cloth, bind with a broad tape, and boil it till quite tender: then put a good weight upon it, and don’t take off the covering till cold. If you choose it to be more like brawn, salt it longer, and let the proportion of saltpetre be greater; and put in also some pieces of lean pork; and then cover it with cow-heel, to look like the horn. This may be kept either in or out of pickle of salt and water boiled with vinegar; and is a very convenient thing to have in the house.

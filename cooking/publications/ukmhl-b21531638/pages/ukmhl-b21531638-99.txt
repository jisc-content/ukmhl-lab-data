29 VENISON. When you ■wish fried things to look aswell as possible, do them twice over with egg and crumbs. Bread that is not stale enough to grate quite fine, will not look well. The fat you fry in must always bo boiling hot the moment the fish, meat, &c. are put in, and kept so till finished ; a small quantity never fries well. To keep meat hot.—It is best to take it up when done, though the compauy may not be come; set the dish over a pan of boiling water, put a deep cover over it so as not to touch the meat, and then throw a cloth over that. This way will not dry up the gravy. VENISON. To keep Venison. Preserve the venison dry, wash it with milk and water very clean, and dry it with clean cloths till not the least damp remains; then dust pounded ginger over every part, which is a good preventative against the fly. By thus managing and watching, it will hang a fortnight. When to be used, wash it with a littlo lukewarm water, and dry it. Pepper is likewise good to keep it. To dress Venison. A haunch of buck will take three hours and a half or threequarters roasting: doe, only three hours and aquar- ter. Venison should be rather over than underdone. Spread a sheet of white paper with butter, and put it over the fat, first sprinkling it with a littlo salt; then lay a coarse paste on strong paper, and cover the haunch; tie it with fine packthread, and set it at a distance from the fire, which must be a good one. Baste it often; ten minutes before serving take off the paste, draw the meat nearer the fire, and baste it with butter and a good deal of flour to make it froth up well. Gravy for it should be put into a boat, and not into the dish (unless there isnone in the venison), and made thus: Cut off the fat from two or three pounds of a loin of old mutton, and setit in steaks, onagridironfor afewminutes just to brown one side; put them into a sauce-pan with a quart of water, cover quite close for an hour, and simmer

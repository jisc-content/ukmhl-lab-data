Toast a slice of bread onboth sides, and butter it; toast a slice of Gloucester cheese on one side, and lay that next the bread, and toast the other with a salamander: rub mustard over, and serve very hot, and covered. Cheese Toast.—Mix some line butter, made mustard, and salt, into amass; spread iton fresh-made thin toasts, and grate or scrape Gloucester cheese upon them. Anchovy Toast.—Bone and skin 6 or 8 anchovies; pound them to a mass with an ounce of fine butter till the colour is equal, and thenspread it on toasts or rusks. Another way.—Cut thin slices of bread into any form, and fry them in clarified butter. Wash three anchovies split, pound them ina mortar with some fresh butter, rub them through a hair-sieve, and spread on the toast when cold. Then quarter and wash some anchovies, and lay them on the toast. Garnish with parsley or pickles. To poach Eggs.—Set a stew-pan of water on the fire; when boiling, slip an egg previously broken into a cup, into the water; when the white looks done enough, slide an egg-slice under the egg, and lay it on toast and butter, or spinach. As soon as enough are done, serve hot. If not fresh laid, they will not poach well, and without breaking. Trim the ragged parts of the whites and make them look round. Buttered Eggs. Beat four or five eggs, yolk and white together, put a quarterof a poundof butter in a bason, and then put that in boiling water, stir it till melted, then pour that butter and the eggs into a sauce-pan ; keep a bason in your hand, just hold the sauce-pan in the other over a slow part of the fire, shaking it oneway, as it begins to warm; pour it into a bason, and back, then hold it again over thefire, stirringit constantlyin the sauce-pan, and pour- ing it into the bason, more perfectly to mix the egg and butter, until they shall be hot without boiling.

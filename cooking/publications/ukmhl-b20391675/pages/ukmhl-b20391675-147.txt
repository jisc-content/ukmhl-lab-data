CHAPTER YIII. VEGETABLES, FRESH. Artichokes, French, Plain Boiled.—Put the artichokes to soak in some well salted water, Upside down, as otherwise it is impossible to get rid of the insects that are s )metimes hidden in the leaves. Trim ojff the ends of the leaves and the stalk, and all the hard leaves round the bottom should be pulled off. Put the artichokes into a saucepan of boiling water sufficiently deep to nearly cover them. The tips of the leaves are best left out; add a little salt, pepper, and a spoonful of savoury herbs to the water in which they are boiled. French cooks generally add a piece of butter. Boil them till they are tender. The time depends upon the size, but you can always tell when they are done by pulling out a single leaf. If it comes out easily the artichokes are done. Drain them off, and remember in draining them to turn them upside down. Some kind of sauce is generally served with artichokes separately in a boat, such as butter sauce, sauce Allemande, or Dutch sauce. Artichokes, Broiled.—Parboil the artichokes and take out the part known as the choke. In the hollow place a little chopped parsley and light-coloured bread-raspings soaked in olive oil. Place the bottoms of the artichokes on a gridiron with narrow bars over a clear fire, and serve them as soon as they are thoroughly hot through. Artichokes, Fried.—The bottoms of artichokes after being boiled can be dipped in batter and fried. Artichokes h la Provencale.—Parboil the artichokes and remove the choke, and put them in the oven in a tin with a little oil, pepper and salt, and three or four beads of garlic, whole. Let them bake till they are tender, turning them over in the oil occasionally ; then take out the garlic and serve them with the oil poured over them, and add the juice of a lemon.

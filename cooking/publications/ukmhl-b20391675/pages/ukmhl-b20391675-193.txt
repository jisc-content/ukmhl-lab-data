CHAPTER XIY. PIES AND PUDDINGS. In vegetarian cookery, as a rule, pies and puddings are made in the same way as in ordinary cookery, with the exception that we cannot use lard or dripping in making our pastry. Nor are we allowed to use suet in making crust for puddings. It would have been quite impossible to have given even one quarter of the recipes for the pies and puddings known, and we must refer those who wish for information on this subject to " Cassell's Shilling Cookery," where will be found a very complete list, but which would have occupied the whole of the space which we have devoted to recipes where vege- tarian cookery, as a rule, differs from the ordinary. We will, on the present occasion, confine our attention to the two points we have mentioned, viz., how to make pastry without lard or dripping, and pudding crust without suet. The first of these two points causes no difficulty whatever, as the best pastry, especially that known as pufi" paste, is invariably made with butter only as the fatty element; but there is one point we must not overlook. Vegetarians are divided into two classes : those who use the animal products—butter, milk, cream, and eggs—and those who do not. This latter class contains, probably, the most respected members of the vegetarian body, as it will always be found that there is an involuntary homage paid by all men to consistency. How then are strict vegetarians to make pastry, butter being classed with the forbidden fruit 1 We fear we cannot tell them how to make good pufi* paste; but " Necessity is the mother of invention," and naturally olive oil must supply the place of butter. Pastry without Butter.—We will describe how to make a small quantity, which is always best when we make experi-

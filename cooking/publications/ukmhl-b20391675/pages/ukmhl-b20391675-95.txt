85 EGGS AND OMELETS. Eggs and Spinach.—Make a thick pur^e of spinach; take some hard-boiled eggs, cut them in halves while hot, after remov- ing the shells, and press each half a little way into the puree, so that the yellow yolk will be shown surrounded by the white ring. Be very careful not to smear the edge with the spinach. N.B.—Sometimes eggs are poached and laid on the spinach whole. Eggs and Turnip-tops.—Proceed exactly as above, using a puree of turnip-tops instead of spinach. Eggs and Asparagus.—Have ready some of the green parts of asparagus, boiled tender, and cut up into little pieces an eighth of an inch long so that they look like peas. Beat up four eggs very thoroughly with some pepper and salt, and mix in the asparagus, only do not break the pieces of green. Melt a couple of ounces of butter in a small stew-pan, and as soon as it commences to froth pour in the beaten-up egg and asparagus; stir the mixture quickly over the fire, being careful to scrape the bottom of the saucepan. As soon as the mixture thickens pour it on some hot toast, and serve. Eggs and Celery.—Have ready some stewed celery on toast. {See Celery, Stewed.) Poach some eggs and place them on the top. Hard-boiled eggs, cut into slices, can be added to the celery instead of poached eggs. When stewed celery is served as a course by itself, the addition of the eggs and plenty of bread make it a wholesome and satisfying meal. Egg Salad.—{See Salads.) Egg Sandwiches.—{See Sandwiches.) Egg Sauce.—{See Sauces.) Egg Toast.—Beat up a couple of eggs, melt an ounce of butter in a saucepan, and add to it a little pepper and salt. As soon as the butter begins to froth, add the beaten-up egg and stir the mixture very quickly, and the moment it begins to thicken pour it over a slice of hot buttered toast. Eggs a la Dauphine.—Take ten hard-boiled eggs, cut them in halves and remove the yolks, and place the yolks in a basin

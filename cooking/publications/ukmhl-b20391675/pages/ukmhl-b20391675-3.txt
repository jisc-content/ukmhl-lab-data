Translated from the French of Baroness Staffe by LADY COLIN CAMPBELL. Cheap Edition, 2s. 6d. " This is a work which no member of the unbeautified sex should be permitted to glance at—except for purposes of review, and no member of the beautified should admit that she has glanced at—except under the same saving clause. A large circulation amongst persons of both sexes is, then, a foregone conclusion. To reveal the mysteries of The Lady's Dressing-Room to the public gaze would appear to us to be a betrayal of sacred confidence, but the book has been sent to us for review, there- fore we are exonerated."—The Queen. A book which every woman ought to have, and hide."—77/^ World. The Elements of Modern Dressmaking. By JEANETTE E. DAVIS. Illustrated. 2s.

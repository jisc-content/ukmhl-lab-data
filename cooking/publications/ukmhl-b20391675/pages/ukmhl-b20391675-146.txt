VEGETARIAN COOKERY 136 already been given, as well as for the recipes in the present chapter. Lentils, Boiled.—The lentils should be placed in soak over- night; and those that float should be thrown away. Suppose we have half a pint of lentils, they should be boiled in about a pint and a half of water. Boil them till they are tender, which will take about half an hour, then drain them off and put them back in the saucepan for a few minutes with a little piece of butter, squeeze over them the juice of half a lemon, and serve hot. Some people make a little thickened sauce with yolks of eggs and a little butter and flour mixed with the water in which they are boiled. Lentils, Curried.—Lentils are very nice curried. Boil the lentils as directed above till they are tender. When they are placed in a vegetable-dish make a deep well in the centre and pour some thick curry sauce into it. (^See Curry Sauce.) Lentils a la Provencale.—Soak the lentils overnight and put them into a stew-pan with five or six spoonfuls of oil, a little butter, some slices of onion, some chopped parsley, and a teaspoonful of mixed savoury herbs. Stew tbem in this till the lentils are tender, and then thicken the sauce with yolks oi eggs, add a squeeze of lemon-juice, and serve. N.B.—Haricot beans can be cooked in a similar manner.

Almond Soup.â€”Take half a pound of sweet almonds and blanch them, i.e., throw them into boiling water till the outside skin can be rubbed off" easily with the finger. Then imme- diately throw the white almonds into cold water, otherwise they will quickly lose their white colour like potatoes that have been peeled. Next, slice up an onion and half a small head of celery, and let these simmer gently in a quart of milk. In the meantime pound the almonds with four hard-boiled yolks of egg, strain off* the milk and add the pounded almonds and egg to the milk gradually, and let it boil over the fire. Add sufficient white roux till the soup becomes of the

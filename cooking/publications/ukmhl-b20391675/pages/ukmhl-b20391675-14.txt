"The standard of hSghest purity."-zanat Cadbura'^ COCOA ^ Absolutely Pure, therefore Best. REFRESHING, NOURISHING, INVIGORATING. Gadbury's Cocoa is entirely free from all admixtures, such as Kola, Malt, Hops, &c. No alkali used to darken the colour (and so deceive the eye). ''Cocoa is in itself a perfect food, and requires no addition of drugs whatever,"—Dr. Andrew Wilson. When asking for Cocoa, insist on having CADBURY'S —sold only in Packets and Tins—as other Cocoas are often substituted for the sake of extra profit. Back of Contents.]

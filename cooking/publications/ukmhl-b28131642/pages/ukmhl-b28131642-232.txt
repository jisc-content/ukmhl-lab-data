232 CHAPTER VII. PIES AND MEAT PUDDINGS. Sufficient attention is not generally given to the seasoning and moistening of home-made Pies. It is not enough to cram a pie-dish with whatever meat may be at hand, to cover it with coarsely-made crust, and then to bake it. Pies, to be good, need care and judgment. One most important ingredient in pies, the jelly gravy, is too often neglected. Without this addition Pies might just as well be made of pieces of leather. General Directions for Pies baked in a Pie-dish.â€” 1. Rub the dish with a shallot. 2. Make from scraps of meat, or giblets, a pint of gravy, strengthening it with half an ounce of glaze, and flavouring it with a slice of ham, or bacon, or bacon rind, an onion, a dessertspoonful of herbs, and a tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup. A tablespoonful of Marsala may be added, when the gravy has simmered for an hour. Then strain into a bowl, and take off all fat. 3. Butter the pie-dish, and sprinkle finely-chopped parsley over the bottom. Do not pack the pie too tightly, and arrange between the pieces of meat or bird minced cooked mushrooms, and grated or thinly-sliced ham or tongue, and slices of bacon. Season well with herb-pepper. Garnish the surface with halves or quarters of hard-boiled eggs, and strew finely-minced parsley over all. 4. Pour in half a pint of the jelly gravy through a funnel very gently. The gravy should not fill the pie, but you should be just able to see it between the pieces of meat an inch from the top.

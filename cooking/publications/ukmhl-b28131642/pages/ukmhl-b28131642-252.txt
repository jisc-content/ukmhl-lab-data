Chickens are always popular, varying as they do from the Poussin of the very smartest dinners to the skinny “ half-fowl ” of the railway-station luncheon basket.

Now, Monsieur Arnoult, on his poultry-farm at Granibois, not far from Paris, rears quantities of Poussins, or, as the French call them, Poulets mignons, or Poulets de lait. M. Arnoult feeds the little chickens on boiled milk just at first, and then on boiled milk thickened with the best barley flour. On this food the chickens fatten so well that at six weeks old, when they are considered to be in perfection, they weigh a pound and a quarter. The flesh is firm and delicate, and very digestible.

The American “ broiler ” is in perfection at eight weeks old ; and properly-fed English cockerels weigh nearly five pounds at twelve weeks old. But all Poultry requires careful fattening if it is to be good. Cramming never gives a good result. One recipe of old days advises the feeding of fowls with treacle,

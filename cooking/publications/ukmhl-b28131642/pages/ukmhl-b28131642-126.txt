126 CHAPTER IV. SAUCES. A well-considered and well-made Sauce will give a character of its own to any dish, and two or three of such Sauces will raise the quality of a dinner. Sauces can be good and distinct in flavour without being elaborate, and without expensive adjuncts. But to succeed in making Sauces it is absolutely essential that the materials should be of the best, that directions should he carefully followed, and that the quantities, and the time required for using them, should he exactly measured. Sauces should be made on the gas-stove, as the heat must he carefully regulated. Sometimes a good Are is needed, at others the flame must he reduced to a mere flicker. Many Sauces can he made some hours before they are wanted—perhaps even the day before. They are warmed in the bain-marie when required. One important point to remember is that in adding eggs to a Sauce it must be done off: the fire, or the Sauce will curdle. Another point, equally important, is in thickening the Sauce to add the Sauce to the thickening and not to stir the thickening into the Sauce. The usual allowance for a roux is an ounce of butter and an ounce of flour to a pint of broth. Cream makes Sauces too rich, and should not be used except in one or two cases, snch as for Bread Sauce and Bechamel Sauce. Instead of using cream it is much better to beat up the yolk of a raw egg in a tablespoonful of the Sauce put into a cup, and to stir it into the Sauce, off the fire, just before serving. Many cooks make far too much Sauce; half a pint is generally enough for four people, sometimes for six. It is much better not to follow the advice given in most cookery books and to “ wring ” Sauces

357 MRS. C. W. EARLE’S STEWED PEAS onion, a sprig of parsley, and four ounces of butter kneaded with flour. Put the butter in small lumps on the Peas, and add a lump of sugar and a very little salt. Cover the saucepan, and let it simmer slowly for about three-quarters of an hour. (A bunch of mint should be added, and might by many people be preferred to the parsley.) Green Peas with Lettuces.—For this dish stew two large Cabbage Lettuces as on page 347. Boil the Peas in water in which the shells have been boiled, with a good bunch of mint, a bouquet of parsley, a green onion, some lettuce leaves and stalks. When the Peas are done remove these leaves and the bouquet, put the Peas in a very hot dish with some morsels of butter melting on them, and arrange the stewed Lettuces round them. Puree Of Peas.—Boil the Peas well, and rub them through a sieve. Add half an ounce of butter, a tablespoonful of cream, a dust of pepper, and of sugar, and a very little salt. SALSIFY. Salsify is a somewhat tasteless root, in appearance like a white carrot. It is best when slowly simmered for half an hour, then cut into pieces three inches long, and fried in batter. When the pieces of Salsify are dry, grated cheese should be dusted over them. Salsify is considered to taste like oysters, and is served in scallop shells, as Mock Oysters. The Salsify is well boiled, cut in slices, slightly mashed, and warmed up in white sauce. Now fill the shells, sprinkle the Salsify with breadcrumbs and a little grated cheese, and brown the surface in the oven. “Wyvern’s” Salsify. —Take one quart of water, a tea- spoonful of salt, a tablespoonful of vinegar, and four ounces of melted beef dripping, and stir all over the fire till boiling. Cut two pounds of Salsify into two and a half- inch lengths, and put it in. Slowly simmer for half an hour, the stewpan not quite closed, adding a tablespoonful of flour to the water to whiten the Salsify. Drain

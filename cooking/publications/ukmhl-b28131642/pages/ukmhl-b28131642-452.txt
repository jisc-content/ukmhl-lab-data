452 CHAPTER XVII. ON PASTRY MAKING. The art of making good Pastry is a gift rather than an acquire- ment. It requires a light touch, cool hands, practice, and dexterity, as well as the most scrupulous cleanliness. But any- body who will take pains and closely follow a few simple rules may at least improve in making Pastry, even if perfection in the art cannot be attained. To begin with, Pastry should be made in a cold place, and early in the day. It must be baked as soon as it is made, but it can then be set aside in a cold larder and heated in the oven when required. If paste is left for even twenty minutes before it is baked it will become dull and heavy, instead of being pliant and elastic. Numbers of recipes have been given for Pastry, from which it would appear that there are numbers of kinds of Pastry. But in reality these may be reduced to four. (1) Puff Paste, used for vol-au-vmts, patties, tarts, mince pies, etc. (2) Pie Crust, for meat pies baked in pie-dishes. (3) Raised Pie Crust, for cold game or cold pork pies. (4) Short Crust, made with sugar and used for tarts as well as Puff Paste. Before beginning to make Pastry the cook should have every- thing at hand which she will want, and she must see that the oven will be ready for the paste as soon as it is made. A marble slab is much better for making Pastry than a pastry board, as marble retains cold much more readily than wood, and the slab should be made as cold as possible by pouring very cold water slowly over its surface. The cook must have close to her flour, butter, salt, and a jug of very cold water. In summer iced water

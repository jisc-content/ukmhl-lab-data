355 PEAS spoonful of salt and the same quantity of sugar should be added to every quart of water, for both salt and sugar prevent the escape of the juices of the Peas. One pint of Peas will require a quart of water. If liked, add half an ounce of fresh mint, but early Peas are best without any addition. On no account use any soda; it ruins young Peas. Let the Peas boil fast, with the cover off the pan, for ten to twelve minutes. Take the Peas out, drain them in a colander, and serve at once in a hot dish. Do not boil Peas in a tinned saucepan. Some people add an ounce of butter, a dusting of pepper and salt, and a little sugar, to the Peas, blending and working all well together in a saute-pan before turning out the Peas into their hot dish ready for serving.

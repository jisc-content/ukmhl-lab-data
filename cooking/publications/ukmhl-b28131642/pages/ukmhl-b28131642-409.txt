409 SWEET OMELETTES add a tablespoonful of kirsch. Keep this hot in a cup set in a basin of hot water, and just as the Omelette is ready to be doubled over pour the preserve quickly over the surface. It can, of course, be spread with the knife, but pouring is quicker. Cold jam would chill and spoil the Omelette. Flavourings such as rum, vanilla, ratafia, lemon, etc., are often liked. For these mix a tablespoonful of any flavouring selected with the yolks of the eggs when the sugar is added.

4io CHAPTER XII. MACARONI AND RICE. Macaroni, so excellent when prepared by an Italian, is often ruined by an English cook. Macaroni is the principal f6od of many thousands of Italians, and Sir Henry Thompson considers that “ weight for weight, Macaroni may be regarded as not less valuable for flesh-making purposes than beef and mutton.” He specially recommends Macaroni as a luncheon dish for those who have to give close attention to business during a long after- noon, for it is easily digested, very sustaining, and does not cause dulness or sleepiness. English cooks generally spoil Macaroni by over-cooking it, and by soaking it in cold water. It must be acknowledged that all Macaroni is dirty (although the eye may not detect it), for it has necessarily been much handled by the extremely dirty Italians who manufacture it. But Macaroni must never be touched by any liquid which is not absolutely boil- ing. A great authority has wisely said “ Washing Macaroni is “ useless and unnecessary. Putting it on to cook in cold water is “ a blunder. Soaking it is a crime.” Messrs. Cozenza, in Wigmore Street, have excellent Macaroni in all shapes and sizes, made from the finest Semolina, or wheat flour. A manufactory has lately been established by M. G6taz at Rolle, in Switzerland, in which the Macaroni is made by machinery, and never touched by the hand. The best Macaroni—that is, the kind made from Semolina—should always be bought. It may take longer to boil, but it never loses its flavour, as Macaroni made with inferior flour is sure to do. The Neapolitan Macaroni is much better than that made at Genoa.

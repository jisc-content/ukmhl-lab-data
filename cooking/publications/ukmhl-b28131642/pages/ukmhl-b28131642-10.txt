PREFACE IV “ shall make.” Miss Seward : “ That would be Hercules “ with the distaff indeed.” Dr. Johnson : ‘ No, Madam, “Women can spin very well, but they cannot write a good “ book on Cookery.” [Life of Johnson, Gf. B. Hill— vol. iii, p. 285.] Most of the Family Recipes given in this book have been in constant use since 1807. I have to express my gratitude to Colonel Kenney Herbert (Wyvern). who has most kindly looked over my proof-sheets ; and to Mr. Edward Arnold for permission to quote from Common Sense Cookery and from Colonel Kenney Herbert’s smaller books, Fifty Breakfasts, Fifty Luncheons, and Fifty Dinners, which ought to be in every household in which good cooking is valued. The recipes given in these small volumes, like those in his larger works, are all clear, practical, and accurate in the smallest particulars. I have also to thank Mrs. Charles William Earle very heartily for the permission to use some of the recipes given in her delightful Pot-Pourri from a Surrey Garden. JULIA ANNE ELIZABETH EOUNDELL.

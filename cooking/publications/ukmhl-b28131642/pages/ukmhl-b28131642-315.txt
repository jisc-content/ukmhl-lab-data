3i5 VEGETABLES—PART I. ARTICHOKES. Artichokes, especially the Globe Artichoke, “that Noble Thistle ” as it is called by John Evelyn, are among the best of English vegetables. Globe Artichokes must be carefully soaked in salt and water to get rid of insects. When the Artichokes are to be served quite plain, cut the stalks off close under the flower or head. Set the Artichokes head downwards in slightly-salted boiling water, and boil them till the leaves part easily from the choke, or core. This, if the Artichokes are young (as they should be for plain boiling), will be in about half an hour. Drain the Artichokes well, lay a napkin folded in three thicknesses on a hot dish, and serve them upon the napkin. Melted butter should be handed with Artichokes plainly boiled. Globe Artichokes can be dressed in various ways. They should be prepared before boiling. Wyvern's excellent method is as follows. Place the raw Artichoke bottom downwards on a board, and with a very sharp knife at once cut it straight down, dividing it in half. Then divide each half into two, so that you have four quarters. Pare out the choke from each quarter, as you would core an apple, and trim off the leaves, leaving about the eighth of an inch of them unsevered and adhering to the trimmed quarters. Be most careful to let each piece drop from your fingers the moment it is prepared, into a basin of cold water in which a tablespoonful of Orleans vinegar or the juice of a whole lemon has been put. If you do not attend to this at the moment, the pieces of Artichoke will turn black. When you have prepared as many pieces of Artichoke as you need for one dish throw them into boiling water with a, dessertspoonful of salt and the same of vinegar. In about fifteen minutes, when nearly done, lift the Artichokes out and drain them. Artichokes thus prepared are excellent as Beignets. For

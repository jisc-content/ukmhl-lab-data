CROQUETTES OF GAME 251 condition has been reached, mark the mixture off into portions about the size of a bantamâ€™s egg, flour them, egg, and roll them in finely-sifted crumbs. Let them rest for half an hour for the crumbing to dry, then egg again, and roll again in the crumbs. Let this coating dry, then fry a golden colour in plenty of boil- ing fat. Drain and dry the Croquettes, and serve on a hot napkin with the rest of the sauce in a boat. Chicken is good done in the same way. Gelatine is advised because it becomes moist during the frying, and does not dry up as eggs do when used for fixing the Croquettes. Serve with the Croquettes two heads of well-washed and trimmed celery, cut lengthwise, tied together with twine, and simmered very gently in broth till tender. Drain, remove the strings, arrange the celery on a hot dish, and smother it with this sauce. Strain, skim, and slightly thicken the eau de cuisson, and finish, off the fire, with two yolks of eggs beaten up in a teaspoonful of lemon-juice, and add a dessertspoonful of finely-minced parsley.

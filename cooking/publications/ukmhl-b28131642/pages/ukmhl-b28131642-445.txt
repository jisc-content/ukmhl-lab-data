INFANT’S FOOD 445 fresh every day, but who, in such cases, would grudge any amount of trouble ? Take one pint and a half of skimmed milk, and scald it. Then add a piece of cured rennet (or bagskin) about an inch square to the milk, and set it aside to curdle. Heat the milk again, and strain it through a sieve. Add to it one pint of new milk, and six lumps of sugar. This is the baby’s food for the day. Essence of Rennet does not answer for this food. To prepare the Rennet take out the stomach of a calf just killed, and scour it well with salt and water both inside and out. Let it drain. Then put two large handfuls of salt into it, and sew it up. Dry it, and soak a bit in fresh water when wanted for use. Food fop a Child from Six Weeks Old, when the Digestion is Delicate and the Brain too Active.—One teacupful of well-washed pearl barley thoroughly boiled in a pint and a half of water, wdth one teaspoonful of carraway seeds. Strain, and give in the bottle every three hours. As the child gets older, boil the barley longer, so as to make the food as thick as liquid jelly. At eight months old cook some Robb’s biscuits with the barley. When the child is ten months old begin spoon- food—that is, bread and milk, and a little beef tea. For young children subject to sleeplessness and brain irrita- tion, no food is better than this. This recipe and the former one have commended themselves to me from personal knowledge of their efficacy.

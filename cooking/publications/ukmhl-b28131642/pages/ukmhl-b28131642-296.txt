296 RABBITS whilst you rapidly thicken the broth in a stewpan with a roux ready to receive it made of an ounce of butter and the same of flour. Bring to the boil, skim, stir in a tablespoonful of cream, and pour the sauce through a strainer over the Rabbit and celery. Garnish with rolls of fried bacon. The broth should be made the day before the dish is wanted. For the rolls of bacon, lay them after rolling in a small baking-tin, and put that into the oven. Watch, and when nicely cooked, take the tin out, and arrange the crisp rolls of bacon as garnish. [ Wyvern.]

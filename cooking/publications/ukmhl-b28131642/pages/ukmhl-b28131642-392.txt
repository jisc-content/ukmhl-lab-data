392 FANCY BUTTERS finely as possible enough of it to fill a tablespoon. Mince and pound capers enough to fill a teaspoon. Now colour the butter pale green by working the spinach colouring into it as lightly as you can. Then add the minced parsley and capers by degrees, and when they are thoroughly worked into the butter form it into little pats. This sort of Fancy Butter can be varied in an infinity of ways. For instance, Ravig’Ote Butter is made by working in equal quantities of chervil, burnet, tarragon, and chives, all blanched in scalding water for two minutes, and pounded. Or minced olives or gherkins can be added, or mustard and cress, or a little minced cooked mushroom. Tomato Butter is made by adding a little tomato conserve to the butter, enough to colour it red. For Watercress Butter pick, wash, and scald three ounces of watercress leaves, weighed after picking. Pound in the mortar, blend with five ounces of butter, and six well- pounded capers, and pass through the sieve. Pass all flavourings through the sieve. Other Fancy Butters can be made with Anchovies, Herring Roes, etc. For Anchovy Butter allow four full-sized anchovies. Scald, drain, and wipe them free from any trace of oil, pick out their spines, and pass them through the sieve. Work the anchovy pulp into four ounces of butter. For Herring’ Roe Butter pound the soft roes of two bloaters to a cream with one ounce of butter. Pass through the sieve, season with Nepaul pepper, and a dust of mace if liked. Work it into three ounces of butter coloured with spinach, adding a teaspoonful of anchovy vinegar. Or tint the butter yellow with hard-boiled yolk of eggs passed through the sieve, and instead of the anchovy vinegar flavour the herring roes with a teaspoonful of pounded capers, passing all through the sieve. Cod roes can of course be used. Recipes for Lobster Butter and Shrimp Butter are given elsewhere, also for the Green Butter and Black Butter eaten with fish.

GUDGEONS iox lightly rolled in flour or oatmeal, and fried. Before flouring, dip each Gudgeon in milk. Or Gudgeons can be split open, buttered, seasoned with pepper and salt, and either broiled on the gridiron or cooked in the Dutch oven. Fried Gudgeons were a special dish at the celebrated York House Hotel at Bath, and at the Pavilion Henri Quatre at St. Germain, near Paris. Lampreys and Lamperns.—The best Lamperns are caught in the Severn at "Worcester, and do not exceed fifteen inches in length. Lampreys are much larger, sometimes twenty-eight inches long, and are found in the sea as well as in rivers. Both fish are most indigestible, but some people con- sider them great delicacies.

Lamperns are served whole. Lampreys are cut up like eels. They are bluish in colour, and very rich. Henry the First died after eating freely of Lam- pems.

They are apt to hide the tastelessness of Pond Fish by all sorts of stuffings and garnishes, and even by larding, but French cooks have two excellent rules which we should do well to follow. One of these is never to boil Pond Fish (or indeed any Fish) in plain

231 REAL ASPIC JELLY set, either fill the mould with jelly, or make alternate layers of jelly and fish or whatever is to be used. Finish with jelly, cover the top with ice, and let the mould stand on ice till the shape of Aspic Jelly is to be turned out. Borders can be filled in the same way. Some of the Aspic very finely minced makes a pretty bright garnish. To do this spread a clean piece of paper on the pastry board, and mince the Aspic Jelly into minute scraps as recommended for suet (page 226). To coat cutlets or pieces of chicken with Aspic, pour the jelly on a large flat dish, and when it has set lay the cutlets or joints of chicken upon the surface. Then pour liquid lukewarm Aspic gently all over them, leave them to get quite cold, and cut them very neatly out. Diamonds or other shapes can be stamped out with cutters in the same way. As Aspic Jelly is often wanted, it is wise to keep a flannel on purpose for straining it. It is sure to leave a flavour in the most carefully washed jelly-bag, and it is scarcely worth while to have a jelly-bag on purpose for Aspic.

45S ON PASTRY MAKING an improvement. Some cooks have a plan of making quantities of Cheese Straws at once, and keeping them in a biscuit-tin to be heated up when required. This custom should never be allowed, as the Cheese Straws soon get stale, and even musty. The greatest attention must be paid to the state of the oven in Pastry making. It must be hot and brisk enough to raise the Pastry, but not so fierce as to scorch it. Burnt Pastry is a sign not only of too fierce an oven but of a careless cook.

525 CHAPTER XX. BREAD, BISCUITS, AND CAKES Xo Bread can ever equal the old-fashioned household bread made with brewers’ yeast, and baked in a brick oven heated by faggots of wood. But brick ovens for oi'dinary use, and the brewers’ yeast of old days, are things of the past. Modern methods of brewing have substituted so many ingredients for the simple malt and hops of old days that brewers’ yeast is now too bitter to use for bread. As a substitute for a bi'ick oven I can recommend pans made of the same material as red flower-pots. They can be ordered at axxy lai’ge potteiy where common flower-pots are made, such as Messrs. Sankey’s, at Bulwell, near Nottingham. A convenient size to order is eight inches long, four wide, and four to five inches deep. Fresh German yeast is quite satisfactory, and never has a bitter taste. German yeast looks like firm putty-coloured paste; the inside ought to be rather moist, and should smell like new bread. It is a good plan to drop it into an uncovered jug of cold water, allowing a pint of water to an ounce of yeast. This keeps it fresh, and makes the yeast-plant grow more readily when it is wanted. One ounce of German yeast (or one pennyworth) is enough to make three pounds and a half of flour into bread; indeed many practised hands use less. Baking-powder should never be used for bread. Flour should be ground three months befoi'e it is used, or the bread will be lumpy and heavy. It must be kept perfectly diy, or it will acquire a most unpleasant musty flavour whiclx no process can remove. The following table will be found use-

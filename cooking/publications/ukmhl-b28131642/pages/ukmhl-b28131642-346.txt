346 VEGETABLESâ€”PART II. LAVER. Laver is a sea-weed, indigenous in this country, but unknown in France. There are two kinds, each with leaves like broad ribbons. One, Poiphyra vulgaris, is purple, and is thought the best. The other, Diva latissivia, is green. Sir Henry Thompson says that Laver, like Mushrooms, ranks much higher in nutritive value than green vegetables. It is best eaten with roast mutton. Laver is in season from October to March. When gathered fresh from the rocks soak it in two waters, about an hour in each, to get rid of the salt. Then simmer the Laver in hot water till it is quite soft and mucilaginous. Cook it like Spinach with a little stock or butter, and a squeeze of lemon- juice. Serve as hot as possible in a dish over a spirit-lamp, and always help Laver with a little wooden spoon. Such shops as Messrs. Cobbett and Morel, in Pall Mall, supply Laver three times a week during the winter. This Laver has been soaked already, and only needs warming up in stock and moistening with a little butter. LEEKS. Leeks are best stewed. Take off the coarse leaves, cut the Leeks in four-inch lengths, wash them, and blanch them twice in boiling water, adding salt the second time. Drain very thoroughly. Simmer the Leeks gently in either broth or milk, but use as little liquid as possible, as Leeks are a watery vegetable. More liquid can easily be added, but if Leeks are stewed in too much they will be sodden. Wyvern says that Leeks in the form of puree with a dusting of grated cheese make a good savoury toast. Leek Milk is excellent for a cold. For this, cut up the Leeks, using every part, including the green tops, and boil them in milk till it becomes quite thick. Salt must not be added.

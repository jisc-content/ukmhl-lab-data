WATERCRESS 37i chicken, or as a vegetable by themselves. Lay the Watercresses in strong salt and water, pick them carefully, wash them well, and stew them in water for ten minutes. Then drain and chop them, return them to the stewpan with a bit of butter, some pepper and salt, and stew till tender. Just befoi’e serving put in a. little delicate vinegar. Serve sippets of fried bread, or Wyvern’s shortbread biscuits, with the Watercresses. VEGETABLES—PART III. PICKLED VEGETABLES. Gherkins.—Gherkins, the cornichons of French cookery, are a small form of Cucumber. They are pickled in salt and vinegar (foreign cooks add garlic, tarragon, capsicums, and cloves), and used, cut in thin rings or slices, as a sharp flavouring. A few of these rings, plainly pickled, give an excellent flavour to melted butter, and a teaspoonful of tarragon vinegar should be added. For haddock or whiting this sauce is much to be recommended. Capers.—Capers, the French capres, are the buds of the Caper shrub. They are only used in a preserved state, like Gherkins, for although the Caper is tolerably hardy in the South of England it- is only cultivated as an ornamental shrub. The small Capers imported from the South of France are the best. For Caper Sauce see page 178. Cepes.—These young shoots of the vine may be good when eaten fresh in Southern Europe. But when imported they are hard and tasteless, and it is waste of money to buy them. MACEDOINE OF FRESH VEGETABLES. Boil the vegetables lightly, and be careful not to over-cook them. Choose equal quantities of four separate vegetables, and boil them separately. They are spoilt for a Macedoine if they are boiled together. The vegetables must not be mashed, but they must be quite distinct in little heaps. If possible, have two green vegetables in a Macedoine, such as peas and asparagus, or French beans and flageolets.

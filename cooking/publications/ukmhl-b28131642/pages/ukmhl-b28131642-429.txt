429 RASPBERRY VINEGAR through a cloth. Add two pounds of sugar, and let all simmer for ten minutes. This quantity makes six bottles, and is sufficient every year. (A gill of Raspberry Vinegar mixed in a tumbler of iced seltzer water makes a very refreshing drink.) King* Cup.—(Family Recipe.)—Take the thinly-pared rind of one lemon and all the juice of the lemon, a small piece of bruised ginger, and two lumps of sugar. Pour a pint and a half of boiling water over them and let it stand to get cold. When quite cold stir in a glass of sherry. Fruit Drink.—Mash one pint of fruit in the juice of two lemons, a pint of water, and a little syrup. Strain through a hair sieve. Strawberries, raspberries or mulberries are the best fruit to use. The Long1 Drink.—(Family Recipe.)—Take a large tumbler, if possible one that has a pocket for ice. Bruise twelve straw- berries till they yield a tablespoonful of juice. Put the juice into the tumbler with a tablespoonful of cream (or milk if preferred), and fill up with soda water. Orange, pineapple, or any fruit will do, only you must get a tablespoonful of juice out of it.

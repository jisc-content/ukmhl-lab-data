CHEESE 524 hang it up in the dairy. It may he eaten in twenty-four hours. The napkin must be changed night and morning for a fresh one wrung out in cold water.

Cream Cheese.—Take a small table-napkin, dip it in boil- ing water, squeeze it, and lay it inside a sieve (the size of the sieve depends on the quantity of cream), put a little salt to the cream, and pour it in not more than two inches deep (less will do). Set the sieve upon a plate, and lay a cover over it to keep off the dust. Change the plate beneath the sieve every day. The Cheese will be ready in a week or a fortnight, according to the weather. It is worth while to do this with even so little as a teacupful of cream which will not keep for other purposes, and cream which has begun to get a little sour is equally good for the purpose.

Devonshire Cream.—Let the milk stand twenty-four hours. Then put it in a pan over a low fire, or set the pan in boiling water. The milk must be thoroughly heated, but on no account boil.

In summer let the milk stand only sixteen hours.

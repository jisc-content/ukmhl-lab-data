66 GARNISHES FOR CONSOMMES & CLEAR SOUPS Wyvern’s Boules de Neige garnish is excellent, pretty, and uncommon. Cut as many tiny round balls as possible out of a root of celeriac and a seven-ounce turnip—an equal number of each. Simmer them in melted butter, drain and cook them gently till tender, being careful not to overdo them. Do the turnip balls first, as they will take longer than the celeriac, drain, and set them aside. Add this garnish at the last moment before serving the clear soup.

446 CHAPTER XVI. ENGLISH AND FRENCH COOKERY. The first Earl of Dudley, who died in 1833, was one of the most celebrated gourmets of his day. He declared with truth that a good soup, a small turbot, a neck of venison, ducklings with green peas or chicken with asparagus, and a green apricot tart, was a dinner for an emperor, and that such a dinner could only be served in England. It is much to be regretted that in these days dinners of simple, wholesome excellence, such as Lord Dudley’s, have too often given place to a number of “messy attempts to keep pace with foreign cookery,” and to an unfor- tunate habit, not only of gaudy colouring of entrees, but of trying to make things look what they are not. To this class belong horse-shoe shapes of creme-de-volaille studded with truffles to imitate nails; shapes like playing-cards with the “pips” imitated in tongue or truffles; royal initials and laurel wreaths carried out in morsels of chervil; and, worst of all, moulds to represent birds or animals, for which one well-known cookery book suggests glass eyes as a great improvement. In sweet cookery yellow and pink colouring may be allowed, but i^ everything to do with meat brown and white are the only colours which should be seen, with the addition of ham or tongue, and the green of vegetable. Coloured patterns traced on meat by forcing-pipes are absurd as well as vulgar, and they do not tend to make an appetising dish. It is curious that this fashion of colouring food seems to repeat itself at intervals. When Lord Bacon complained of what was in his time carpet gardening, he said: “You may see as good sights, many times, in tarts.” Miss Edgeworth

347 LETTUCES. It is a great mistake to think that Lettuces can only be eaten as salad, and it is another mistake to let gardeners over- look them till they are running to seed. If, however, the stalks can be captured when they are just beginning to run to seed they are excellent if cooked like celery, or cut to one length and stewed. Wyvern gives two excellent methods of cooking Lettuce hot. Both are applicable to the cabbage Lettuce (the French Laitue) and to the long Cos Lettuce (Laitue Romaine). Cos Lettuce derives its name from the fertile island of Cos, one of the Cyclades, now belonging to Greece, where Lettuces have been cultivated from the earliest ages. Stewed Lettuces.—Choose three fair-sized Lettuces, soak them like cabbages to get rid of slugs and insects. Trim them neatly, casting away all bruised or faded leaves, plunge them into boiling water (salted) for ten minutes to blanch them, drain them, pour cold water over them, press the moisture from them, cut them in two, season with a sprinkling of salt, tie the halves together with tapes, put them into a stewpan with sufficient broth to cover them, add two table- spoonfuls of melted dripping or stock-pot fat, an onion, a bunch of parsley, and a couple of cloves ; cover with a round of buttered paper, and simmer for two hours. When serving sever the tapes and pour about half a pint of good brown sauce made from their cuisson over them. “ Wyvern’s ” Laitues Farcies. —After blanching the Let- tuces and cutting them in halves, carefully pick out a few leaves from the centre of each so as to form a hollow for the reception of a dessertspoonful of chicken or veal forcemeat. Close the halves again and proceed as in the foregoing. Lettuces can be cooked like Mrs. C. W. Earle’s Celery en branches. MUSHROOMS. Mushrooms ought to be cooked as simply as possible, so as to preserve their distinctive flavour. Tinned Mushrooms are flavourless and leathexy.

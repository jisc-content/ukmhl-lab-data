Roasting1.—Many cooks imagine tliat Roasting a joint and baking it in tbe oven are the same thing, and that the same resnlt is obtained by the direct heat of the open fire, and the reflected heat from the sides of the oven. As to this error, the wise words of Mr. Buckmaster, the great authority on English cooking, ought to be a sufficient correction. He says, “ The “ essential condition of good Roasting is constant basting, and “ this the meat is not likely to have when shut up in an iron “ box.” For Roasting it is absolutely necessary to use not only the jack but the screen lined with polished metal which protects the fire from draughts and keeps in the heat. The joint should be wiped over with a clean damp cloth, to remove any traces of the handling which it must have met with on its way to and from the butcher’s cart; but it must on no account be washed. The fire must be carefully made up, and the joint (hung on the hook of the rotating jack) placed close to it for from six to ten minutes, according to the thickness of the meat. This hardens, or “ seals ” the surface, and prevents the escape of the juices of the meat, whilst the inside of the joint is kept tender. After this “ sealing,” draw the joint further away from the fire. See that the fire is good and equal throughout the Roasting of the joint; let the thickest part of the meat hang rather below the centre of the fire ; and be most careful not to cook it too fast. Baste the meat at least every ten minutes. For this it is important to begin basting with broth or stock till the joint

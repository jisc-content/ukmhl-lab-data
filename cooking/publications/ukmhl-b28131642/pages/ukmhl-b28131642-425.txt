425 CHAPTER XIY. BEVERAGES. Clear Barley Water.—{Family Recipe.)—Wash a pound of Pearl Barley very well in two or three waters. Put it into a quart jug with a lump of sugar. Fill the jug with boiling water, and let it stand to get cold. The Barley will settle at the bottom, and the liquid will be quite clear. For the Flavouring, either put the rind of a lemon pared very thin into the jug with the Barley and sugar before the boiling water is added. Or (which is a better way) pare the lemon rind very thin, put it into a break- fast cup, pour boiling water upon it, and let it stand half an hour. Strain, put the liquid in the glass jug the Barley Water will be served in, and pour the Barley Water upon it. Set the glass jug on ice before serving. Lemonade.—For one quart of Lemonade allow six ripe lemons, or eight if they are not juicy. Rub the outside of two of the lemons thoroughly with lumps of sugar to get the “ zest,” or essential oil, of the rind. Pick out the pips of all the lemons, and squeeze out every drop of juice. Put the lumps of sugar and the lemon-juice into a jug, and pour nearly a quart of boiling water upon them. Cover the jug till the Lemonade is cold. More sugar may be added, but the Lemonade is generally sweet enough if four lumps of sugar have been used. Another way is to pare one lemon as thinly as possible, and to skin all the lemons, removing every particle of the white, which is very bitter. Take out the pips, slice the lemons, and put them and the one lemon paring into the jug, allowing two lumps of sugar to each lemon. Fill up with boiling water, let the Lemonade get cold, and strain it before serving.

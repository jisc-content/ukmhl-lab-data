297 CHAPTER IX. GENERAL RULES FOR COOKING VEGETABLES. Vegetables should certainly be clean, but all needless washing should be avoided. If vegetables are squeezed to get the wet out of them after a necessary washing they will be bruised and the best of their juices will be lost. They will drain themselves perfectly if placed in a colander, or on a sieve, by the fire. All fresh vegetables must be put on in really boiling salted water.

Green vegetables—that is, all those which consist of seeds (like peas), pods (like French beans), leaves (like spinach), and stalks (like asparagus),—must be boiled with the lid of the pan off, and in a roomy pan which is not tinned. This will preserve the colour if plenty of water is used, as the steam can escape freely. The old-fashioned plan of boiling a bit of soda in the water in order to preserve the colour of the vegetables should never be followed. It does preserve the colour, but it injures the flavour of the vegetable and makes it unwholesome. When vegetables are done they should be drained at once. If they are left to soak they are spoilt. In boiling Cabbage put into the water a piece of breadcrumb tied up in a fine white rag. After a quarter of an hour’s boiling take it out and burn it instantly. The bread will have absorbed much of the disagreeable smell proceeding from the

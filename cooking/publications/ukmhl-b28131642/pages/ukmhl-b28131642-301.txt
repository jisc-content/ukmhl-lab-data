RULES FOR COOKING VEGETABLES 301 is used. Salt should be added with a very sparing- hand in the kitchen, for, once in, it can never be got out of the vege- table, and those who like more salt can please their taste from the salt-cellars on the dinner table. When cheese is used it generally contains sufficient salt for the vegetable, without adding more. In these days of excellent Creameries and Butter Dairies, and with the aid of the Parcel Post, any family can be supplied with good butter at a reasonable price. Good butter is so essential for good cookery, and especially for vegetable cookery, that where expense has to be considered it is better to economise in anything rather than in butter. The sickening compound called Kitchen Butter, but which is really adulterated fat, is, we hope, a thing of the past. But, in vegetable cookery, even the best butter must be most carefully used. Unless the vegetables are actually fried in butter, the proper quantity of cold butter should he stirred into the dish just before serving, so as to avoid all danger of greasiness. Our native vegetables should depend on their own natural flavour, escaping both the drowning and soaking in water of English cooks, and the lavish additions of butter and various flavourings of foreign chefs. Cold cooked vegetables should be set aside, as they may be served again in various ways. Potatoes can he sliced as salad, or mashed up with other vegetables as a puree. Any remains of vegetables can be mixed with melted butter, dusted with cheese, and baked; or used as a puree with buttered eggs; or warmed up in the bain-marie, mixed with white sauce, and served as a macedoine. Several of the vegetables mentioned in these chapters are, properly speaking, fruits, such as Chestnuts, Olives, Capsi- cums, and even Aubergines, Marrows, Cucumbers, and Tomatoes. But as recipes are given for cooking them as vegetables I have thought it best to make no distinction.

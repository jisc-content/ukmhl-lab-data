RICE 4iS England. When the Rice is cooked it should be emptied from the pan over and round the fowl, and served steaming hot. Rice is excellent with fish, especially when, after blanching, it is simmered in strong fish stock. The fish, such as salmon or cod, which has yielded the stock should be pulled to pieces, seasoned, and tossed in the hot pan with the Rice and a little extra butter. This makes a superior form of Kedgeree.

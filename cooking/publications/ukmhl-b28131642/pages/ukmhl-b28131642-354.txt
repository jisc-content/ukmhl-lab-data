354 ONIONS tarn them about with a wooden spoon over a good fire to colour them. Then put them into a saute-pan, moisten with enough broth to cover them, roll them about in this with the spoon over a quick fire, and as the broth reduces it will form a glaze. Baste the Onions with this so as to glaze them evenly, and when that has been done they are ready. PARSNIPS. No vegetable suffers more from bad cooking than the Parsnip. It would not be too much to say that the mess of half-cooked sweetish sticks, or lumps, usually served as Parsnips is uneatable. There is a great deal of nourish- ment in Parsnips, and although their sweet taste will always be disagreeable to some people they are, if properly cooked, a most wholesome and digestible vegetable.

Let the Parsnips simmer till tender, which will be about an hour and a half. Do not add anjr water in the course of simmering, and let the water the Parsnips were put on in reduce to the fullest extent, so that when they are tender there will hardly be a drop to drain off. The simmering should result in melting the Parsnips, so that the rich sugary flavour is not lost, and only a creamy pulp full of nourishment remains. Serve in a very hot dish. Parsnips, cooked in this way, and not mashed, are considered- to be one of the most wholesome vegetable foods in the world. v PEAS. G-reen Peas should be served as plainly as possible to suit English tastes. No Peas are so good as those grown in England, and it is a great mistake to use the various additions which are in favour abroad. Young Peas should be shelled as soon as gathered, and must on no account be washed. They should be put into fast boiling water, but the water must only just cover them. A dessert-

TOFFEE 5Â°7 water, and try if it breaks crisp and clear between the teeth ; if it does, the Toffee is ready. Pour it on to well-buttered dishes, plates, or baking sheets, adding a little lemon-juice to each. Before the Toffee gets cold, mark out with a sharp knife the dice or other shapes in which you wish to divide it, for it will not break easily afterwards. Shred almonds can be added before the Toffee is poured on to the plates. Or treacle can be used instead of the sugar.

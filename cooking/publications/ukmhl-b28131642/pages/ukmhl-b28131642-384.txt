HERBS 3&4 much milder than any Onion. They are indigenous in England. Chives are extremely tender, and the leaves, finely-minced, are very useful. The Fourniture of a Salad is brought on a small plate if the Salad is mixed in the dining-room. This Fourniture in France is made of delicately-minced chervil, tarragon, chives, and the neglected pimpernel of our English fields. In England equal proportions of finely-minced chives, chervil, buraet, and tarragon, are used. Or, as sometimes is liked, very small spring onions, or Onion Threads, can be substituted for the chives. Whether the Salad is mixed in the dining-room or else- where, the Fourniture should be added at the last moment, and briskly stirred into the salad; a wooden spoon and fork should be used, in order to thoroughly amalgamate the Fourniture with the Salad. A variety of pot-herbs, added to a variety of fresh vege- tables, gives infinitely better flavour to dishes than any amount of artificial flavourings and grocersâ€™ sauces. The French Bouquet Garni, and our own Bundle of Herbs or Bunch of Herbs, consist of a small bunch of parsley, a sprig of thyme, and one bay leaf. Blanch the parsley, and fold it over the thyme and the bay leaf, being careful to tie the little bundle together with twine. In this way the Herbs are easily removed when they have served their purpose of flavouring. It is often a good plan to sew up Herbs in a bit of muslin, making a little bag. After long simmering the Herbs will have become absorbed in the broth, and only the muslin will need removal. It should be remembered that one measured teaspoonful of dried herbs is equal to one dessertspoonful of fresh herbs. A teaspoonful is reckoned equal to a quarter of an ounce dry measure, a dessertspoonful to half an ounce, a tablespoonful to one ounce. Herbs, if dried, should be measured when powdered and freed from all bits of stalk. If fresh, they should be measured when they have been finely minced.

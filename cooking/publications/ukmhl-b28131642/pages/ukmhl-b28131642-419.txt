419 CHAPTER XIII. CURRIES. English cooks have much to learn as to the making of good Curries, but the art can be acquired without incurring the expense, as is sometimes the case, of keeping an Indian servant on purpose to make and serve Curries. The most common mistakes with regard to English-made Curries are that they can be quickly made with very little trouble, that any remnants of meat several days old are quite suitable for Curry, and that these remnants only require smearing with Curry-powder and hasty stewing in any kind of white sauce.

Curries are better made of fresh meat, but very good Curries can be managed with cooked meat. Curries of fish and of vegetables are excellent, and are not nearly so often seen as they should be. Curries should be made in an earthenware casserole, and served in it with a napkin pinned round it. All Curries are better when warmed up a second time, so that the remaining contents of the casserole should be carefully set aside. Both Curry-powder and Curry-paste are required, as the paste contains several ingredients which cannot be worked into the powder. Both should be bought from a first-rate London shop. Curries require a peculiar flavour which can only be given by an infusion of nuts.

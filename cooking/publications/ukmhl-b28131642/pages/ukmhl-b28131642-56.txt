SOUPS 56 herbs, seasoning of salt and pepper, and one loaf of bread. Wash the rice and the peas, wash and cut up the vegetables, and cut the loaf up small. Stew for at least five hours in eight quarts of water. Strong1 Broth.—(Family Recipe.)—Put three pounds of gravy beef and one calf’s foot into three quarts of water. Just let it boil up so as to skim it clean. When skimmed add one onion, one carrot, and one young turnip, also three spoonfuls of washed rice or pearl barley. Put in also a very little browning of sugar and water, which makes the taste softer and rather darkens the colour. Now let the broth simmer for five hours. Before it is done the calf’s foot becomes quite a pulp, almost like hasty pudding. When the simmering is done, the meat, bones, and vegetables are taken out with a spoon, but the rice or barley is left in. The strength of the broth is judged of wdien cold; if right it will be quite a jelly. Heat up enough for a broth basin as wanted, and do not add salt till then. PUREES. Purees are among the best of soups, as they are among the easiest to make. But, as with most things, time and patience are needed if a satisfactory result is to be obtained. Tough game and old poultry can be made into excellent Purees. Shell-fish make a better Puree than other fish. A good broth is essential to a Puree. This, in the case of game and poultry, must be made from the crushed bones, giblets, and scraps of the birds. Por vegetable Purees vegetable stock, or second stock, must be used, and for Purees of fish the broth must be made of the trimmings and bones of fish. All Purees must have a liaison—that is, a thickening or binding together of the materials used. If this is omitted the Puree will look like a wretchedly thin soup with all the pulp soddening at the bottom of the tureen, because the stock aud the pulp have never been incorporated with each other. French cooks use cream, eggs, and milk as a liaison for Purees,

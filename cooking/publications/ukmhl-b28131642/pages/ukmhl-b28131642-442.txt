442 SOOTHING DRINKS FOR A COLD. Linseed Tea.—(Family Recipe.)—Take a teacupful of linseed and two ounces of liquorice root. Pour over this three pints of boiling water, and simmer for one hour and a half. Or, put four tablespoonfuls of linseed, four lumps of sugar, and the rind and juice of one lemon, into a quart of boiling water. Let it stand for half an hour, strain, and serve cold in a jug. (Linseed, which is flax seed, is most soothing in a severe cold or hoarseness.) Barley Water with Honey.—Put two teacupfuls of well- washed pearl barley into a large jug, with the juice and rind of one lemon, and one tablespoonful of honey. Pour a quart of boiling water upon it, let it stand for half an hour, strain off the liquid, and serve. For Leek Milk see page 346. REFRESHING DRINKS. For Lemonade, Orangeade, Raspberry Vinegar, Clear Barley Water, and Toast and Water, see Chapter XIV. Lemon Drink.—Slice a lemon, take out the seeds, and pour a pint of boiling water over the slices. When quite cold, strain it, and add a very little sifted sugar. Orange and Lemon Drink.—Cut up two oranges and one lemon, put the slices into a jug with one ounce of sugar candy. Pour into the jug a quart of boiling water, and stir occasionally. When quite cold serve without straining. The orange and lemon pips must be taken out. Drink a little of the liquid at a time. Tamarind Whey.—Boil two ounces of tamarinds in two pints of milk. When the tamarinds are dissolved, strain and serve cold. Apple Water.—Cut three large apples into slices, but do not remove either peel, core, or pips. Pour a quart of boiling water on the apples, cover the jug, and let it stand till quite cold. Strain, add a squeeze of lemon, and a very little sugar. Or boil the sliced apples with a strip of lemon-peel for one hour. Boil very gently, and then cover the jug till the liquid is quite cold. Strain, and add a very little powdered sugar.

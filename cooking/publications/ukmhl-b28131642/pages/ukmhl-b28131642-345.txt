GARLIC 345 That evening the Sprats appeared as a bonne bouclie at supper, a meal "which the unlucky guest had owned that she enjoyed. “ There was therefore no retreat from the maze in which her “ insincerity liad involved her, and eat she must. But when “ slie again smelt on lier plate the nauseous composition, which, “ being near the bottom of the pot, was more disagreeable tban “ ever, human patience and human infirmity could bear no “ more; the scarcely-tasted morsel fell from her lips, and she “ rushed precipitately into the open air, almost disposed to “ execrate in her heart potted Sprats, the good breeding of her “ officious hostess (who, not eating supper herself, bad been at “ liberty to attend entirely to the wants of her guest), and even “ Benevolence itself.” HORSERADISH. Horseradish does not belong to the same family as the small Radishes eaten uncooked. It is one of the earliest vegetables known to cultivation, and the root is eaten, when grated, either in a raw state or made into sauce. Much Horse- radish is imported from Germany and elsewhere, but it is not nearly so good as that grown in England. (Those who cultivate Horseradish in gardens should be careful never to grow Aconite, or Monk’s Hood. The root of this plant is a deadly poison, and has often been mistaken for Horseradish, with fatal results.) Large roots have not so delicate a flavour as the young and tender Horseradish, but scrapings of them are very useful in fish-cookery, especially for pond or river fish. The value of Horseradish in this respect is mentioned by Izaak Walton, in his Gompleat Angler, published in 1653, and his advice is followed by wise cooks in the present day. It is a good plan at the beginning of winter to slice a root of Horseradish, and dry it before the fire. When quite dry pound it in a mortar, grate, and keep the powder in a labelled bottle for use.

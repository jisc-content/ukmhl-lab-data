459 CHAPTER XVIII. SWEET DISHES. Tarts and Compotes.—The Lord Dudley already referred to would never sit down to dinner without being certain that an Apple Pie would be served. He scorned the name of Apple Tart, declaring that the word tart meant open pastry, only fit, in his opinion, for children and servants. An Apple Pie is really the only tart which is good when served hot. Various plans have been suggested for overcoming the difficulty of baking the crust without baking the fruit, but the problem has at length been solved by Mrs. Earle. She says : “ All my tarts throughout the “ year are made with the crust baked apart, and the fruit, stewed “ previously, juicy and cold. Shortly before dinner make the “ paste; crumple up kitchen paper into a mound the height you “ wTish your crust to be, place it in the pie-dish—the round- “ shaped dishes are the prettiest—cover this with a clean sheet “ of buttered paper, lay your paste over this, bake in the usual “ way. When done lift off the crust, take out the paper, pour in “ the fruit (which can be iced if desired), put a little raw white “ of egg round the rim of the pie-dish, and replace the crust. In “ this way an orange or a strawberry tart can be made without “ cooking the fruit at all, except in the usual compote wray of “ pouring boiling syrup over it.” [Pot-Pourri from a Surrey Garden, page 27.] Apple Pie.—(Family Recipe.)—Always use one of the six- penny pie-cups with a perforated stem, and a deep pie-dish. The pie-cup prevents the juice from running out of the pie. Always leave a little hole at the top of the pie ; this chimney allows the gas which is generated in cooking to escape. Pare some Apples as thinly as possible and core them.

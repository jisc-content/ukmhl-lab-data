Sandwiches are among the smaller items of Cookery which have so greatly improved of late years, probably owing to their popularity at five o’clock tea. It is no longer thought that Sandwiches can be cut anyhow and by anybody, and that all that is required is to have slices of cold meat, coarsely smeared with mustard, laid between thick pieces of buttered bread, so that a hungry traveller who can get nothing else may be glad to eat them. Sandwiches should always be cut from yesterday’s loaf, and the loaf should be a tinned one and close in the grain. The bread should be cut an eighth of an inch thick, and about two inches long. The crust should be pared off the bread before the slices are cut, and it can then be used for raspings or bread- crumbs. If slices of meat are used every particle of skin and gristle must be removed, but pounded meat or puree of game is generally preferred. A small leaf of crisp young lettuce, or some mustard and cress, is a great improvement. If Sandwiches have to be cut some time before they are wanted, a damp cloth laid over them will keep them moist. If exposed to the air, or covered with a dish, Sandwiches dry up very quickly.

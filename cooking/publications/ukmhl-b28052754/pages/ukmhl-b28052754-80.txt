64 Orange Salad a la Chinoise. The Chinese peel their oranges and cut them into slices as we do, but they sub- stitute oil for cognac, salt for sugar, and lemon juice for vinegar. The slices of oranges are put into a bowl with fresh wal- nuts picked and steeped in vinegar, then oil, salt, ginger, and lemon-juice is added. Apple Salad a la Moscovite. Boil some peppercorns, three bay-leaves, a dozen cloves, and some honey in vinegar. When this is cold arrange the apples in layers in a small cask, separating the layers with rye straw. When the cask is full pour in the liquor, which should en- tirely cover the apples. Close the cask, which should be air tight, and put into a cool place. Apples are served this way in winter in place of salad. Pears, apri- cots, peaches, and plums may be prepared in the same way, replacing the straw by vine, cherry, or fig leaves. Slices of Melon in Salad. Skin a ripe melon, removing the hard part of the flesh. Cut the eatable part into thick slices. Spread these on a dish and season them ten minutes before serving with salt, pepper, and lemon juice or vine- gar. Then arrange them on an oval dish. Marinade of Small Melons. Wash some small melons which have not ripened and prick them, using only those about the size of a walnut. Then put them into a brine, leaving them for six or eight hours, stirring them up from time to time. Put into a jar some small onions, a little tarragon, four cloves, half a bay-leaf, a sprig of thyme, and some peppercorns. Then put in the melons and cover with white vinegar. They will be ready for use in about a fortnightâ€™s time.

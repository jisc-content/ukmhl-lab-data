The ingredients of this are three smoked herrfngs, four kidney or new potatoes, two russet apples, three or four gherkins, and a tablespoonful of capers. Soak the herring fillets for an hour, cut them into large dice, and put them into a bowl first rubbed with a clove of garlic. Cut also into dice the apples, kidney potatoes, and gherkins, and add them to the herring and capers. Season with oil, tarragon vinegar, and chopped chives and chervil. Just be- fore serving the salad, mix with beetroot, seasoned beforehand and cut into dice. In all cases where beetroot is used in a salad, it should be mixed immediately be- fore serving, otherwise its juice will colour the ingredients of the salad. Sauer-kraut Salad. This salad requires little preparation. The sauer-kraut should be washed in seve- ral waters, and then pressed free from moisture. It is put into a salad bowl and seasoned like an ordinary salad, but with less salt, as the sauer-kraut itself is salted.

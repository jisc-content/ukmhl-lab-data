3 hour. Then prepare a chicory salad, as above, and immediately before serving mix in the haricots. Rampion. The rampion is a plant with bell-shaped flowers, and its young leaves and root are eaten in salad. It is seasoned like other salads, and garnished with chives, tarra- gon, and chervil. 'Dandelion. The dandelion is a wild plant with dent- ated leaves, something like the leaves of chicory. It has blood-purifying and sto- machic qualities. The young leaves make an exquisite salad which needs no gar- nish, having sufficient flavour of their own. Oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper provide all the necessary dressing. It is usual, how- ever, tO' serve slices of beetroot with the salad, the sugar of the root counteracting very agreeably the bitter of the dandelion. Purslane. Purslane is a kitchen-garden annual, which has anti-scorbutic properties. There are several varieties of it, the best known being the golden purslane which, properly dressed, makes a tasty and much appre- ciated salad. ^ It is prepared like an ordi- nary salad with the addition of pimpernel, chervil, and tarragon. The stalks of pur- slane can be pickled in vinegar like gher- kins. Cos-lettuce Salad a la Suisse (Swiss style). Prepare a cos-lettuce salad as usual, then add chopped pimpernel and tarragon, and some fresh Gruyere cheese* cut into strips. Gruyire, with a “a tear in every eye ” as the Swiss say, is almost unobtainable in England.—Tr. ^ B

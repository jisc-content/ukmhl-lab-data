Let them steep in this for an hour, and serve in a salad bowl or fruit dish. In the latter case they should be decorated with glac6 or candied cherries. Currant and Raspberry Salad. Pick half a pound of white and red cur- rants and the same quantity of raspberries. Put these into a salad bowl with a glass of maraschino and about an ounce and a half of castor sugar. Mix by shaking the bowl without touching the fruit with a spoon. Green Walnut Salad. Green walnuts are ready about the mid- dle of August. After taking them from the husk they are split in two and put into a bowl with salt water to which a little vine- gar has been added tO' prevent them from turning black. Now stone a bunch of green grapes, and pound them, in a mortar with two cloves of garlic, pepper, salt, and a little grated nutmeg. Pass the juice thus obtained through a strainer, add a little vinegar to it, and after draining the wal- nuts pour it over them. This is served as a hors d'auvre. Melon Salad a VOrientale. Choose a small ripe lemon; with a sharp knife skin it and cut away the hard part which cannot be eaten. Then cut it length- ways in slices with the seed still attached.

Then put the slices together in the original form of the melon without the skin, and put it on ice until it is served.

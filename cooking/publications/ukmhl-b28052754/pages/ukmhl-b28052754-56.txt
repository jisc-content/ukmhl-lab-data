40 Calves' Brains a la Ravi gate. After having steeped the brains in cold water for at least an hour take off the skin and then boil them for a quarter of an hour in a stewpan with salt, two spoonfuls of white vinegar, a few peppercorns, an onion cut in rings, a sprig of parsley, a bunch of thyme, and a few bay-leaves. When the brains are cooked, drained and cold, serve on a dish with ravigote sauce.* Chicken Crapaudine a la Tartare. Take a young chicken and cut it along the back in order to take away the skin, which must be done completely. Disjoint the l^s, draw back the wings, and flatten the breast, so that the chicken has a uni- form surface. Season with salt and pep- per, cover completely with oiled butter, then put on each side a layer of new bread- crumbs, pressing it on with the blade of a large knife. Twenty minutes before serv- ing grill it on a slow fire, turning it from time to time. Serve with a sauce Tartare. Ducks with Mayonnaise a la Bigarade. A duck may be cooked especially for this dish, but it is a useful way of serving the remains of a cold one. The duck is cut up without removing the skin, which is the most succulent part. It is then steeped in oil, vinegar, pepper, and salt, with an onion cut in slices and a few sprigs of parsley. At the end of half an hour the duck is taken out of this dressing and drained on a napkin. Make a mayonnaise, and in- stead of chopped herbs add to it an orange bigarade, that is to say, a julienne of the rind of one or two oranges with the white entirely removed, and then boiled in salt * The recipes for the sauces in these recipes are given in a succeeding chapter.

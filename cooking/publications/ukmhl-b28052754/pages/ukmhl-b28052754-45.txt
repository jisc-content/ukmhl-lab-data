Put into the salad bowl a large spoon- ful of mustard and work it up with oil, vinegar, salt, black pepper, and a sprink- ling of cayenne. Add to this seasoning some celeriac, celery, and endives, cut into a fine julienne. Cut also into julienne strips some lean ham, tongue, and two or three rather sour apples and beetroot. Mix well, and decorate with a border of truffles and potato salad. The beetroot should not be added until the last minute, and seasoned separately. Cabbage Salad a la Viennoise. Take off the outer leaves of a cabbage, and cut the rest into quarters. Scoop Dut the heart, stalk, and the coarse ribs, then mince each quarter and blanch in boiling water for ten minutes. Drain in a col- ander, and freshen with cold water. Dry on a napkin, and put the cabbage into a salad bowl. Season as usual, adding some chopped garnish. Crosnes Salad. Crosnes are vegetables of a Japanese origin. They were imported into France and cultivated with success by M. Pailleux de Crosnes. In taste it is something be- tween a Jerusalem artichoke and a globe artichoke, and it is easily cultivated, its principal merit being that it is harvested just when everything else is out of season. Cut the small root off each end of the cros- nes. Wash and cook in salt water for a quarter of an hour, drain and season either with oil, vinegar, or with a light mayon- naise.

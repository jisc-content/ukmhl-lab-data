59 Chapter V. FRUIT SALADS. Strictly speaking, the term salad should be applied only to dishes the seasoning of which consists simply of oil, pepper, vine- gar, and especially salt, since the word salad comes from the Latin word sal, salt. Nevertheless it has been very generally used to describe raw fruit simply sprinkled with sugar, moistened with liqueurs, and flavoured with any aromatic substances. The word has probably been used in order to differentiate this dessert dish from the compote which is usually composed simply of fruits stewed in syrup. Strawberries. Strawberries may be served without pre- paration in a fruit dish, but a more elegant way is to arrange them in a bowl with the stalk towards the centre, and a bed of vine leaves between each layer of fruit. Castor sugar is served separately. Salad of Wild Strawberries. The small wild strawberrv is the best for a salad. The preparation is very simple. The strawberries are picked and put into a salad bowl a few minutes before serving with a sufficiency of sugar and a glass or two of white or red wine. They are care- fully stirred up to mix the wine and the sugar, and turned into a fruit dish. The wine may be replaced by kirsch or Madeira.

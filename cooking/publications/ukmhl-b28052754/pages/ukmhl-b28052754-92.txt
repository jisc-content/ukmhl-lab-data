The analysis of this salt shows that it is exclusively a salt of potash. The domestic animals eat salt eagerly, and the beasts of the field are fond of it. In certain countries it is mixed with fodder. Salt must not be merely con- sidered as a condiment, as it plays a great part in the digestion of food.

Salt is found in nature in solution and as a solid. An inexhaustible source is sea water, from which it is obtained by evaporation. As a solid it occurs in the tertiary earth, and is found all over the earth. In France there

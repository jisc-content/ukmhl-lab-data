49 claws and legs and split the tail. If there is any coral in the lobster put them on one side. Break the claws and the shell care- fully and take out the flesh. Cut this up in uniform pieces, and put them on a large dish, season with salt, pepper, and vinegar, and let them steep in it for about an hour. Prepare a rather highly flavoured mayon- naise and wash three lettuces, putting the hearts on one side. Drain the lobster and the lettuces, and cut the latter into coarse julienne, and arrange it on a dish. Put the pieces of lobster on the lettuce, and give them a coating of mayonnaise, alter- nating the lettuce and lobster until a pyra- mid is formed, leaving the best pieces of lobster for the outside. Then cover the whole with mayonnaise and ornament the base with hard eggs cut in quarters and the hearts of the lettuces. The lobster coral should be chopped up finely and sprinkled over the final dressing of mayonnaise, or it may be pounded with butter, passed through a hair sieve, and used tO' decorate the border. Some sprigs of tarragon and fillets of anchovies arranged with taste help to give this mayonnaise an appetising appearance. Lobster Salad a la Lucullus. Cut up the meat from the claws and tail of one or two lobsters into small pieces, slice five or six truffles cooked in cham- pagne. Put these together in a salad bowl with oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, chopped chervil, and tarragon, and the champagne the truffles were cooked in. Let them steep for an hour, and before serving drain and cover with mayonnaise. Strew over the surface the lobster coral, garnish with hearts of lettuce cut in two and ploversâ€™ egrg-s.

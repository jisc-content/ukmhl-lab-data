e.s the same way. (Both these are gross errors.) It is preferable to operate in the warmth rather than in complete cold, as the oil in congealing is an obstacle in the assimila- tion of the liquid with the yolk and vine- gar and the sauce rapidly decomposes. As for the belief that the spoon or whisk should be turned one way rather than the other, it is too ridiculous to trouble our- selves with. The recipe herewith may be considered infallible, not only because the ingredients are different to those ordinarily employed, but because of the method of operating and mixing the ingredients. Put into a round bowl the yolks of two eggs, half a teaspoonful of salt, half this quantity of white pepper, a teaspoonful of mustard, and the same of vinegar. Mix these ingredients vigorously with a small metal whisk, add the oil gradually without stopping stirring. Great care must be taken not to allow the mayonnaise to be- come too thick. This can be avoided by adding a few drops of vinegar or cold water. The method of mixing the yolks with the mustard, vinegar, salt, and pepper to begin with is the main point of the re- cipe, and the reason why success is cer- tain, as the mixture assimilates easily with the oil, and it is not even necessary to add it drop by drop, but it may be put in spoon- ful by spoonful without fear. The prin- cipal advantage of the method of operat- ing is that sufficient mayonnaise for six people can be prepared in five minutes, whereas the old way would take a quarter of an hour. The use of a whisk in place of a wooden spoon is of great im- portance. Green Mayonnaise. Take a large sprig of parsley, one of chervil, chives, and tarragon. Wash,

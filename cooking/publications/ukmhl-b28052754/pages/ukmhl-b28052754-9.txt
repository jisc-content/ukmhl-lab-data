V. PREFACE. There need be no apology for offering a book on salads, because few manuals are in existence which deal exclusively with this important section of the culinary art. Salads are recognised as an indispensable course for any lunch or dinner, and for the sake of health some kind of salad ought to form an item in every family menu throughout the year. Such being the case, it is well to have a pleasing variety of reliable combinations at one’s command. To many persons, the word “ salad ” re- presents but a very limited opportunity, and yet every month of the year practically brings in some kind of material wherewith a delicious salad can be made. Salad mak- ing is not as a rule classed as an art, inas- much as everybody thinks he or she can make a salad, but there is, I venture to as- sert, a great difference between a well dressed salad and the dishes one meets with at times, which are given that name. This book of recipes is the most complete work of its kind I have as yet seen, and considering the fact that Mons. A. Suz- anne is one of the most renowned chefs of the present day, this manual should find its way into thousands of kitchens. Every recipe given reflects the genius of a masterhand in the art of making salads.

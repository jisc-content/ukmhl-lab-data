65 Salade Cauchoise. Two pears, two russet apples, and two Seville oranges. Peel the pears and the apples and cut them in quarters. Take away the pips and the core, then shred them finely lengthways, so as to get slices in the form of a half-moon. Remove the skin and white part of the oranges, and divide them into quarters, taking off the skin which separates the quarters and re- moving the pips. Place the fruit thus pre- pared in a salad bowl with castor sugar and twO' or three glasses of brandy, and let them steep in it for an hour, shaking the bowl from time tO' time. Chrysanthemum Salad. Knowing the eccentric manners and tastes of the Japanese, it is not astonishing to find that they use chrysanthemum, flowers as a salad, seasoning them like let- tuce with salt, pepper, oil, and vinegar, after having wash^ and drained them. It seems that this is a popular dish, and at Yokohama when the chrysanthemum is in flower all the greengrocers sell them care- fully washed and picked. The most ap- preciated variety is that with dark yellow flowers. Nasturiium Salad. Salads are sometimes decorated with the flower of the nasturtium. It is looked upon rather as an ornament than as a part of the salad itself, as it has no particular taste. The buds and young seeds can be pre- served in vinegar like capers and are used in seasoning certain salads.

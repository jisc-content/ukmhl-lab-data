58 put a small sprig of tarragon or chervil. Arrange on the border of butter, and sur- round with chopped jelly. T0 serve Prawns. Another elegant and original way of serving prawns consists in suspending them by the tail around a large wine-glass. The glass is put on a dish garnished with parsley, and just before serving is filled with water to the brim. The tail then acts as a syphon, and the water runs out of the glass and drips on to the dish, producing a very picturesque effect. Prawns served in this way should be chosen of equal size. Anchovy Salad. Fillet some Gorgona anchovies, cut each fillet in two lengthwise, and arrange in lat- tice fashion on small glass dishes. Gar- nish with quarters or slices of hard-boiled eggs and capers. Pour over a little olive oil, sprinkle with chopped chives or pars- ley, and serve.

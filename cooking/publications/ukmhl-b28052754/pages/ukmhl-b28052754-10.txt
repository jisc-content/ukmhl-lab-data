VI. The reception accorded to Monsieur Suz- anne’s L'Art de Treparer et d'Accommoder Us Salades, of which the present work is a translation by A. M. Garance, has been very flattering, and justly so, because it is a work on a popular subject, and supplies a want felt by every maitre d'hdiel, cook, and housekeeper. The various chapters on salads con- tained in this book give a number of new salad combinations, and include many which have recently been introduced. The Spanish proverb as illustrated on the front of book is full of meaning to the salad mixer. It runs : — To make a perfect salad four persons are needed. There should be a miser for the vinegar, a spendthrift for the oil, a wise man for the salt, and a mad-cap to stir up the ingredients and mix them well. It would, however, be more correct to say that a patient, discreet, painstaking, and careful man or woman should per- form the seasoning and mixing of a salad, since the French say, II faui bien fatiguer la salade.

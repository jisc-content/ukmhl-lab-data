45 Put all the ingredients together into a dish, and season with vinegar, oil, salt, pepper, chives, chervil, and tarragon. Mince separately in the same way the leaves of a cos lettuce, and mix with the other ingredi- ents just before serving. Picnic Salad. An excellent thing for a picnic, and a dish that can be carried about without risk, is a chicken salad. A very simple and in- genous method of packing it is to procure a well-baked loaf. Cut the upper crust in a single slice, take out the crumb, which may be used for bread and butter pudding, pack the interior with the salad, and re- place the lid. Toâ€™ make the salad, cut up a cold boiled or roast chicken, and season it in a bowl with salt, pepper, vinegar, oil, chervil, and terragon, and add some coarsely cut cos lettuce. Mix the whole well together. In packing this into the loaf spread butter around to prevent the seasoning from oozing out, then put in the salad, and cover with a layer of mayon- naise. The loaf can be wrapped in paper and put into the picnic basket. Polish Salad. This salad is made with new potatoes, apples, smoked salmon, anchovies, ham, gherkins, celery, and cos lettuce. Cut all these ingredients into coarse julienne. Mix them all with mayonnaise to which some chopped herbs have been added and a little cayenne. Serve the salad with a border of hard-boiled eggs alternated with stoned olives.

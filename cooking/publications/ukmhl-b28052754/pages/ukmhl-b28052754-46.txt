30 Salsify Salad. Scrape the salsify and cut off the leaves, divide the stalks into short lengths, and throw them into a bowl of fresh water with a little vinegar to prevent them from turn- ing black. Boil in salt water with a little vinegar added, season as usual or with a mayonnaise to which some chopped garnish has been added. Artichoke Salad with Truffles. Pluck the leaves of half a dozen young and tender artichokes, scrape the bottoms, and rub them with lemon juice and mince finely. Put into a bowl and sprinkle with salt. Leave them for twenty minutes, then let them drain on a napkin. Mince the same quantity of preserved truffles, and put all together into a bowl, having first rubbed the interior with a clove of garlic. Pass the yolks of twOâ€˜ hard-boiled eggs through a sieve, and put them into a bowl with a teaspoonful of mustard moistened with oil and tarragon vinegar. Season with salt, pepper, and mix this sauce with the arti- chokes and truffles. Scorsonera Salad. The scorsonera, called also Spanish sal- sify, differs from the salsify properly so- called in its exterior colour, which is black, but the flesh is perfectly white with a very fine texture. After having scraped them throw them intO' a bowl of fresh water, with a little vine- gar to prevent them from turning black. Then boil in salt water and vinegar, to which a spoonful of flour has been added. When they are boiled drain and cool. Cut into short sticks and season them in a salad bowl with oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, chervil, and pimpernel, or with mayon- naise.

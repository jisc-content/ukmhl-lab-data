2 three pinches of pepper for a salad for four persons. Sprinkle the vinegar over the leaves to begin -with, dissolve the salt and pepper in it, then add the oil and mix thoroughly with a salad fork and spoon. The ingredients must be added in this order; otherwise, if the oil is put in first, the leaves impregnated with it will not absorb the vinegar. As for the pepper, it is better to grind it than to use already ground pepper, which has left the best part of its aroma at the grocer’s. Of course, it is of the highest importance that the vinegar and oil should be of first quality. Green salads should be dressed immedi- ately before serving. Lettuce Salad with Plovers' P^ggs. Prepare three lettuces as in the previous recipe. Boil six plovers’ eggs for eight minutes, put them into cold water, then shell and divide lengthways. Put the lettuce in a salad bowl with a handful of cress, some chopped chervil and tar- ragon, three tablespoonfuls of oil, one of white vinegar, half a teaspoonful of salt, and a sprinkling of pepper. Mix all up lightly and arrange the cut plovers’ eggs on the top with the white upwards. “ Cuite " or “ Conf.te ” Salad. The French call a green salad “ cuite ” or “ confite ” when it has been prepared some hours in advance, and the leaves have be- come flaccid by remaining too long in the oil and vinegar. They retain their flavour, but lose all the crispness which should be the chief virtue of a salad, and are flabby and discoloured. In spite of this, plenty of people prefer these salads. i.

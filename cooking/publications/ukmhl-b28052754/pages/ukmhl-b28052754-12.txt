Vlll, a bad dinner at which two salads were served, one of yellow purslane, the other of wilted green stuff, both smelling of ran- cid oil and swimming in strong vinegar. This shows that then as now the quality of the oil and vinegar used was considered of first importance. But the excellence of these is not the only requisite for a good salad, the other flavouring ingredients must be in correct proportion and skilfully added. A salad at dinner is a necessity, almost a passion with some people; the craving v' for it may be compared to that of an in- veterate smoker for his pipe, of English women for tea, and the Chinese for opium. ^ Of the large number of green plants that T may be eaten as salad the principal are lettuce, chicory, watercress, barie f. (blanched dandelion—a species grown like ( celery), corn-salad, rampion, purslane, ft dandelion, and endive. ■ In spite of the apparent homogeneity of R these plants they differ essentially in taste; E each kind therefore requires special pre- ■ paration and seasoning. S The leguminous vegetables that can be used in the form of salad are numerous. The chief of these are white and green haricots, lentils, beetroot, celery, potatoes, salsify, cucumber, truffles, tomatoes, and carrots. The fish used in salad are such as have a firm flesh; for instance, salmon, turbot, sole, trout, mackerel, and tunny. But her- rings and anchovies are used as flavour- ings. Boiled and braised meat (beef, as a rule), poultry, and game can be served in the same way.

b Ostrich Eggs in Salad. The chief difficulty is to obtain a freshly- laid ostrich egg. Having “ caught ” your egg, boil it in water for a quarter of an hour, then put it into cold water, and shell it. Cut it in two lengthways, and take out the yolk. Then slice the white, and crown a prepared salad of cos-lettuce with it, de- corating the white with truffles and an- chovies. Make a mayonnaise with a part of the hard yolk, and serve in a sauce-boat. An ostrich egg is equal in bulk to about ten hen eggs. This may be useful to our South African subscribers. Endive Salad. This excellent vegetable comes from Bel- gium, and is braised (stewed in a tightly closed pan) in gravy, like celery. It is also good as salad. The outer leaves are cast aside and the others are stripped off and washed thoroughly. They are then allowed to steep in water for half an hour. After drying, they are cut into pieces and seasoned with oil and tarragon vinegar in the proportion of three spoonsful of the former to one of the latter. Pepper, salt, and a little mustard are added. As a refinement, some sliced beetroot and a little chopped chervil may be added, but the beetroot should be dressed separately, and added to the salad immediately before serving. Barbe de Capucin. Barbe is a cultivated form of the roots of wild chicory, which are blanched like ce- lery. It is rather a bitter salad, and to tone this down a little beetroot should be served with it. The usual .seasoning is used, three spoonfuls of oil to one of vinegar and pepn per and salt.

74 Chapter VII. OIL, VINEGAR AND CONDIMENTS. Oil. The quality of the oil is of great import- ance in the seasoning of a salad, and too much attention cannot be paid in this re- spect. Olive oil is reputed to be the best and purest found in commerce. It is sold in several grades, but that which is known as huile vierge (virgin oil, i.e., that which runs out of the olive without any other pres- sure than that of the heaped-up fruit) is preferable to the other brands. It has little colour and a very agreeable flavour. Inferior oil is recognised by its yellow colour, its peculiar odour, and its rather acrid flavour. It thickens in cold weather and solidifies in a sharp frost. Pure oil, on the other hand, only slightly congeals in cold weather, preserving a limpid and colourless surface. Virgin oil is the first from the press before boiling water is thrown on the olives, and when this has been done they mostly produce a poor quality of oil. The high price of olive oil has caused it to be an object of considerable adulteration with oils of inferior quality. Unfortunately, there is no method of dis- covering these adulterations, and so far the chemists have not been able to work out a method of analysis. Oil which is not pure deteriorates gradually in the presence of air, turning rancid after long exposure. Even the best does not improve with keep- ing, and acquires a bad flavour with age.

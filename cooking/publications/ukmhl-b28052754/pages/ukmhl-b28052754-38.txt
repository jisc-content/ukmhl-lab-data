Then drain away the liquor, and put the cabbage into a pickle jar with some pepper pods, two bay leaves, and a little thyme. Pour boiling vinegar over the cabbage, and tie up tightly. In about a fortnight the pickle will be ready. It is used generally as hors-d'oeuvre, or may be eaten with cold meat. Black Radish Marine. Black radish is used as an hors-d'oeuvre.

32 toes than mussels. Add some fresh truffles cut in slices, salt, pepper, oil, vine- gar, and a little chopped tarragon. Tomato Salad. Choose very red and very firm toma- toes, steep them in boiling water to take off the skin, cut them into slices, and take out the seeds. Place the tomatoes on a dish, and season lightly with salt, pepper, and a few slices of onion, which should be taken away in about an hour. Then drain away all the juice and season the tomatoes as usual, adding a little chopped herbs. This is often served with hors-d'oeuvre. Marrow and Tomato Salad. Here is a recipe for a new salad which is sure to be appreciated by lovers of cooked and green salads. Peel thinly a large firm marrow, cut it in half, remove the seeds, and cook in salted water till almost tender. It must not be cooked quite as much as when served hot. Take up the marrow and drain on a sieve. When cold cut into neat slices. Skin three or four large, ripe, firm tomatoes, and cut them into slices. Pre- pare a mayonnaise or an ordinary salad dressing, but use the best quality of oil (Provence or olive oil). Have ready some green salad lettuce and endive, etc. Ar- range the marrow and tomatoes alter- nately in a round deep dish or flat salad bowl, put a teaspoonful of salad dressing in the centre of the dish, and pile on this the green salad. Pour some dressing over the border, decorate with slices of hard- boiled egg, tarragon leaves, and small cress, and serve.

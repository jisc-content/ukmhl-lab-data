46 Chapter IV. FISH SALADS. Salmon Mayonnaise. Divide some cooked salmon, free from skin and bone, into pieces of even size and let them steep in a little tarragon vinegar for an hour. Then drain on a napkin. Wash two lettuces, and cut the leaves into strips, keeping the hearts in re- serve. Make a mayonnaise. Boil some eggs for ten minutes, shell them, and when they are cold cut them into quarters and form a border of them round the lettuce, on which arrange the pieces ofsalmon with a spoonful of mayonnaise on each. Put a fresh bed of salad over this, then more sal- mon, and so on. Cover the whole with the rest of the mayonnaise, to which a little chopped tarragon has been added, and de- corate with anchovies. The lettuce hearts are cut into quarters and served as a border with the egg. Trout with Green Sauce. Boil two large trout in court-bouillon*. Take off the skin and let them go cold. Then coat with a thin layer of fresh but- ter and decorate the trout with very thin slices of truffle, so as to imi- tate the scales of the fish. The trout are served on a bed of rice, the base of which is decorated with spoonfuls ♦ Court bouillon is a stock composed of water and wine, to which is added kitchen herbs and spices partly fried in butter. —Tr.

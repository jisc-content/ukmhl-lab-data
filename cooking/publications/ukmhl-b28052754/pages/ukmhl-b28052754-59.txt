Season with salt, pepper, oil, and vinegar, and spread over the meat some slices of onions, two or three sprigs of thyme, and a few bay-leaves. Let it remain for an hour, then drain the slices of beef, and arrange them on a dish. Serve with cold horse- radish sauce. Cold Horse-radish Sauce. This sauce is used in England with roast beef or with cold meat. To make it take a root of horse-radish and scrape with a knife, then grate with a cheese-grater, and put the pulp thus obtained intO' a bowl. Add to it salt, pepper, the same quantity of new breadcrumbs passed through a sieve, a teaspoonful of castor sugar, the same quantity of vinegar, and three or four spoonfuls of cream. This sauce should have the consistency of mayonnaise, and should be made an hour before serving. Veal and Tongue Salad. Cut the remains of the roast veal into small pieces and put them into a salad bowl with the same quantity of tongue, a few chopped gherkins, and slices of celeriac stamped into rounds the size of a shilling with a cutter. Season with salt, pepper, oil, vinegar, chervil, tarragon, and thoroughly mix. Just before serving bind with two or three spoonfuls of mayon- naise.

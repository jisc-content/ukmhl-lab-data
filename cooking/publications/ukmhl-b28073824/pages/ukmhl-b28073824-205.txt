Septembei* September 2.—Flowery September.—September is a lovely spring month, and the whole country is a flower-garden in the western or rather south-western part of the Cape Colony. Its beauties can hardly be realized unless experienced by a trip to Malmesbury, Saldanah Bay, Darling, and Tulbagh. In ordinarily good seasons the whole country round for miles is perfectly fragrant with number- less wild flowers. So many people say the flowers at the Cape have no scent, but there are so many that have ! The purple “ Africander ” for one, and the brown Africander is most deliciously sweet, a kind of gladiolus, I think, and the avond bloemtjes and the creeping protea, which smells like apricots, and very many with very strong scent which only smell sweet after sunset—by day you would say they had no scent. There is a flower very like an attenuated geranium, the leaves creep along the ground and the flower is on a long stalk—local name, Beer- blom. It has the sweetest scent you could imagine. It is not beautiful to look at, but one in a room fills it with a sweet perfume. There is a blue baviana growing very close to the ground, one of our earliest spring flowers, also very sweetly scented. i8g

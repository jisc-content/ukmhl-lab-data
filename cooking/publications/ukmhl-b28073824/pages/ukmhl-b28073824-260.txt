244 Dec. ICING. “JUMBLES.” ROCK CAKES and when nearly cold cut in layers ; while the cakes are cooling make the icing. Before quite cold, build the layers of cake together, the icing between slices, so that the plain cake, the pink and the brown come alternately, and pour the rest of the icing over the outside. Half this quantity will make a nice-sized cake. Lemon icing in between and over all is very nice. Icing for Cakes (Mrs. Griffith’s recipe).—Two large cups of fine white sugar, with just enough hot water to melt it; set it to boil in an earthenware saucepan, stirring occasionally till it threads from the spoon ; beat the whites of two eggs to a stiff froth, and put into a deep basin, and pour the boiling sugar over the stiffly beaten whites, beating all the time.

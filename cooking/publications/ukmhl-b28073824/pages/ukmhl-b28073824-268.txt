GHERKIN PRESERVE. APPLES Dec. 252 December 30.—(xherkin (Young Cucumber) Preserve (Miss Breda’s).—Take equal weight of sugar and fruit; a few cloves.

Next day boil slowly for three or four hours, flavour with a few cloves, or a few pieces of ginger tied in a piece of muslin. Take out the bag when the preserve is ready. Bottle, boiling-hot, in Hazel jars.

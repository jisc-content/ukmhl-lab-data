72 BATTER. APPLE-RINGS. GINGERBREAD “lady" is said to have been “loaf-giver"—implying a person as practical as Solomon’s beautiful description (Prov. xxxi.) of the^ “ virtuous woman" whose “ price is far above rubies,’’^ and the heart of whose husband “ doth safely trust in her,” and of whom it is specially said, “ She looketh well to the ways of her own household, and eateth not the oread of idleness.” February I5.-Batter for beef fritters.-To-day some cold beef had to be used up for luncheon, so I used the recipe at p. 76 in Hilda's Where is it, for fritters, but the batter I made differently, and as follows, from Mrs. Higham’s recipe Put I lb. flour in a bowl, and in the middle of it drop 2 dessertspoonfuls of Lucca oil, stir it a little and add I pint of tepid water (make this of two-thirds cold water and one-third boiling). Stir this smoothly into the batter, beating well; a little salt is also required. Last of all add to it the stiffly-whipped whites of two eggs. This batter is lovely for cold minced beef fritters, and is also very nice for apple-rings. Apple-rings should be first washed and soaked for a minute in hot water, and then dipped into the batter, and fried in boiling ox-marrow (which you get in tins those I use are marked The Armour Canning Co., Superior Ox- Marrow, Chicago, U.S.A.), and which is, by the way, also excellent for short crust and scones. I prefer it infinitely to lard. February 18.—Gingerbread with brown flour.—I have been given some interesting notes from the Hon. Mrs. Cecil Parker’s manuscript recipe-book. Gingerbread made with brown flour instead of white is excellent—more crumbly and “ more interestine.” Parkyn.—Gingerbread made with oatmeal is, Mrs. Parker

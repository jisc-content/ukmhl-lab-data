June HASH AND VENISON SAUCES 153 with doing up cold meat will be glad to know of a good sauce for hashed beef. The note on this recipe says, “ Good for venison, beet, mutton, wild-fowl.” I pint clear good gravy. 1 tablespoonful of onion, chopped very fine. A little cayenne. A pinch of salt. 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of port wine (but a later note in the margin says, “wine not recommended”). 2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup {or Harvey sauce—do not use both). Boil these, and when boiling put in the meat, cut very thin; turn it three or four times, and in four or five minutes send it to table to be eaten immediately, and not stand. “No flour—no other acid,” is noted as a warning to those who might think of adding to the ingredients. Currant Sauce for Venison (Miss Meinertzhagen’s, from an old recipe).—Boil i ounce of dried currants in half-pint of water a few minutes; then add a small teacupful of bread-crumbs, 6 cloves, and a glass of port wine ; also a bit of butter. Stir it till the whole is smooth. Banana Salad.—I see I have also against mayonnaise sauce made note—we have not tried it yet, however—of what a friend told me the other day made a good salad, though it sounds very quaint, and that is mayonnaise sauce over slices of banana. She says apples may also be used with mayonnaise sauce. I believe it is a German plan. Though bananas do not ripen with us, we get such quantities brought to the Cape from Natal that we are always glad to know new ways of using them. June^ 19.—Miss Leisching’s Almond Pudding.— 1 have

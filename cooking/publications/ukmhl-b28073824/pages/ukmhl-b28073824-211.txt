195 PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS Sept. great dislike to its coming up to table in the shape in which the calf wore it, I decided we would cook it German fashion (Mrs. Carl Becker’s recipe), as “ mock turtle ragout.” This is a dish which may be served with mushrooms or truffles, and so done makes a very nice entree. The recipe says— Boil a nicely-cleaned calf’s head in water, add to it some salt, 20 peppercorns, a few bay leaves, and a white onion. Boil for three hours, or until quite tender, and see that the bones can easily be removed. Cut the meat into square pieces. Now make a sauce in a frying-pan by taking 2 ozs. butter, let the butter get brown in the pan, then add a tablespoonful of flour and stir it about till it is nice and smooth ; add to this a cupful of the stock in which the meat was boiled, add also a wineglass of sherry, and some cayenne pepper. Let this gravy get quite boiling hot, then put the squares of meat in it before serving. Should we not do well to consider the pecuniary and sanitary, to say nothing of the moral advantage, of kind- ness to animals killed for food ? The little leaflets published by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to A nimals have much struck me, and by kind permission of the Society I print some of their papers in the Appendix, describing how to kill calves, rabbits, and poultry with least pain to the creatures. I reproduce the directions in hope of sparing suffering to the animals.

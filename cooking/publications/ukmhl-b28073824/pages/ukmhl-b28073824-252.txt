Dec. 236 A WEEK AT CAPE POINT The ladies look after the hampers, as there are no shops at Cape Point, and only the lighthouse-keeper (who by the way is generally most hospitable and kind). We must not foiget anything—least of all the gridiron. We will take a piece of nice corned beef, which should be boiled slowly foi four or five hours and pressed, putting a weight on a plate turned over it. This is a nice piece de resistance., and a leg of mutton turned into sasaties. (See Hilda’s Where is it foi lecipe.) Or we take the leg of mutton with us, and when we outspan cut it into chops to be cooked on the gridiron or pronged stick over the flame. Of course, one caters in proportion to the size of the party. Some cold roasted chickens and cold frickadel keeps well, wrapped up in sandwich-paper. Ileie is a good dish for picnics. Cut any pieces of mutton or beef (uncooked) in tiny shreds. Whisk up an egg or two with some finely-shred bread-crumbs, a little nutmeg, pepper, some hard-boiled eggs chopped up, a little parsley, a suspicion of white onion finely chopped. Mix all well together. Butter some paper and put a spoonful in each paper, folded en papillate, and fry in a pan in boiling fat, laid, oi dripping. Ihis is very good, and a nice dish for such occasions. Then we generally can get fish. A nice “Hottentot” fish, oi a galjeon—both are equally nice done on coals, just broiled with the scales on them. We also take down a few dozen mutton patties, which, when home-made, will keep for two days. A tin canister contains a few sponge-cakes, buns, moss bolletjes, some turn-overs, and any fruit that is in season, apricots, green almonds. In another basket we pack some cups and saucers, tea-pot, essence of coffee (yHilda s Where is it, p. 35). Milk we buy from the people

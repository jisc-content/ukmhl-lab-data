Nov. ANCIENT HISTORY OP PARKIN 226 for All Souls Day. Farmers used to make quantities of these cakes to give away. Miss Burne prints the following recipe for the genuine old Shropshire soul-cake, as given by the family of a lady who kept up the old custom till her death in 1884 :—“ Three lbs. flour, | lb. butter (or \ lb. if the cakes are to be extra rich), \ lb. sugar, 2 spoonfuls of yeast, 2 eggs, allspice to taste, and sufficient new milk to make it into a light paste. Put the mixture (without the sugar or spice) to rise before the fire for half-an-hour, then add the sugar, and allspice enough to flavour it well; make into rather flat buns, and bake.” This was clearly a more luxurious cake than parkin, which consists chiefly of oat- meal, treacle, and ginger. . . . Throughout Italy, Sicily, and Sardinia, various kinds of sweets and confectionery are eaten on All Souls Day, November 2. One curious mixture, made in Sardinia, consists of almonds, nuts, and walnuts, bruised and mixed with sugar and grape-juice, forming a kind of stiff paste, which suggests our northern parkin. A strange practice connected with these Italian sweetmeats on November 2 is that the folk who eat them on that night are accustomed ^ to leave a dish of them on the table when they go to bed, for the delectation of the ghosts of the departed, who, on the.night of All Souls, will be abroad and will revisit their old haunts. There can be no doubt . . . that the parkin, and the “ saumas ” loaves, and the soul-cakes, still eaten or given to children, are simply survivals of the ancient belief, although no maker nor eater of parkin now-a-days ever thinks of any connection between the cake and the souls of the dead.—Globe, November 2, 1901.

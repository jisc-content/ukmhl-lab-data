178 A COOKING BEE Jug. but much fatter during the months of September, October, November, and December, as the pasturage is much more luxuriant then in the Western Province. August 4.—A Cooking Bee.—The nieces and young cousins are very fond of a cooking bee, so, as we had some extra cooking in prospect, I suggested they should come and help me make the things we had promised to send to the luncheon to be given to-morrow to the Missionary Conference visitors. Our contribution was to be—2 Swiss rolls, a lady cake, an orange jelly, a fairy cream, a lemon sago, and a sago and pontac shape. The cousins bargained that if they helped us we should give them scones for tea, and modestly added that for luncheon they should like a beefsteak pie, a German tart, and macaroni cheese, a somewhat odd combination, but their own selection. I give the recipes for all below. All preliminaries having been settled, they arrived early, and having donned their pretty, if not very business-like aprons, tucked up their sleeves and set to work—and a very merry day we had, and some very successful cooking, of which I will record the recipes. I insisted that all the cleaning up of pots and pans, as well as the more interesting preparations, and cooking itself, should be done by my amateur kitchen-maids, for I think people do not always realize how long all the cleaning and tidily putting away takes, when the real cooking is over. The scones were greatly appreciated when tea-time came, and the only regret was that more had not been made; while at luncheon the beefsteak pie and German tart and the macaroni cheese disappeared like magic.

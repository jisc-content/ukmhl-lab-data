133 FLUMMERY. GLAZE, RISOTTO May May lo.—Flunimery.—I must not omit to take down the flummery recipes I mentioned above. The first is— To make flummery (yellow). Take i oz. isinglass and dissolve it in a little water, then add i pint of sherry wine, the yolks of 4 or 5 eggs, the juice of 2 lemons, and sugar to your taste. Let it boil a few minutes, then strain it into a clean basin, and keep stirring it till it is near cold. Wet your moulds with water, and fill them. To make flummery (white). For a pint of flummery take I oz. isinglass, boil it in a little water till it is quite dissolved, then add i pint of cream, 2 tablespoonfuls of brandy. Chop a few bitter and sweet almonds, the peel of I lemon, and a little sugar to your taste. Boil it a few minutes, then strain it through a fine sieve; keep stirring it till it is near cold. Wet your moulds well with clean cold water before you fill them. May 13.—Glaze.—To make a clear dark-brown glaze, which so much improves the look of cold pressed beef or tongue, you must have ordinary good gravy, and by constant boiling reduce to, say, a quarter the original quantity, which when cold will jelly. You can make it as thick a glaze as you like by suc- cessive coats being brushed over the meat, but be sure the under one is dry before you brush the meat over again with the glaze. Risotto a la Milanaise.—This is a nice savoury dish, and will be specially liked by people fond of cheese. It is, as you see, Italian, and I am indebted to Miss Adeane for it. Put a good-sized piece of butter in a stew-pan and add a small quantity of minced onion. Let it just colour, but not brow7i. Take a cupful of rice and let it cook in the butter about five minutes, adding sufficient stock to cook the rice.

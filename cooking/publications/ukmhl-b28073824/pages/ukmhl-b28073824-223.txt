FISH PIE. PASTRY Oct. 207 open the door for half-an-hour or more after putting it in. Be earefid not to slam the oven-door^ or the cake will go down. I have read somewhere that the way confectioners get a smooth outside to their sponge-cakes is by (after greasing the mould) dusting the inside of the mould with fine sugar and flour in equal quantities, before pouring in the mixture. Fish Pie.— Remains of cold fish. 2 onions fried in dripping. Pepper. Salt. Mustard. I oz. butter. Tomato sauce. Mashed potatoes. Eggs. Break the fish in nice little pieces, mix well with onion, butter, seasoning, and some mashed potatoes. In the tomato season slices of raw tomato in between are very nice. Pack the fish in a dish with a spoonful of butter or dripping at the bottom, then mash the potatoes with a little butter, and pack on the top of the fish; brush over with an egg before baking. A few hard-boiled eggs mixed with the fish would be a great improvement, and some of the gravy formed in the fish-dish. October 7.—Pastry.—One is always wanting pastry of different sorts, so I have been collecting good recipes for various kinds and writing them all together under P in my copy of Hilda!s Where is it., so as to know where to find them at once. Here they are.

192 Sept. FRUIT. PISH. BREAKFAST DISHES Cover with paper and bake one hour. Dish up with good gravy.

This time it was some slices of cold boiled bacon that would otherwise have been wasted. These were sprinkled with bread-crumbs and fried, and served hot. September 7.—I find in the larder we now have the remains of a ham—not enough left to look well at table, so I shall divide it and use it for two different dishes, as

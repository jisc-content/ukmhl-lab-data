GUAVA MOULD. FRUIT SALAD May 126 an-inch thick; put them in an enamelled preserving-pot (or a copper one is best, but must be very clean) with enough water to cover them well. Let this boil slowly till the fruit is soft, and then strain it through an enamelled colander (as tin vessels discolour the guavd), or if you have not an enamelled colander at hand, a piece of coarse white muslin will do for straining the fruit. The next day take 2 cups of sugar to every 3 cups of guava juice and boil briskly in a very clean copper pot. It jellies quicker when done in small quantities. When it bubbles up very quickly and froths sputtering up, put a little on a flat plate, and if it gathers a sort of cream and hardens quickly it is good. Don’t mind if it has a troubled look when you add the sugar, it becomes clear in boiling, and ought when done to be of a rich dark ruby colour. In Hilda's Where is it, p. 122, is another recipe for guava jelly, which is rather different, as they are peeled. Guava Mould.—Another excellent way of using guavas is according to the following recipe for guava mould. This is made by first peeling them and slicing and pulping them, adding a little water and straining out the seeds; you then add I cup of sugar to every 3 cups of juice and let it boil well for 5 or 10 minutes. Some gelatine should mean- time have been soaked, and you then add \ packet of soaked gelatine to about every 4 cups of the guava. Boil the mixture up again and pour it into a porcelain mould. Custard should be served with it, or no doubt cream, especially Devonshire cream, would be delicious with it. Fruit Salad.—Slices of pineapples, bananas and oranges in layers sprinkled with sugar are excellent, with half a wine-glass of Van der Hum poured over.

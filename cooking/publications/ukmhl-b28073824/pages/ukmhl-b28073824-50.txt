Jan. RAISIN YEAST. POULTRY 34 be baked while the dinner is cooking, which is, of course, a great saving. Raisin Yeast is used in the eastern part of Cape Colony. Crush in a mortar half a cupful of raisins, and put in a 2 lb. fruit bottle, with i tablespoonful of sugar ; fill the bottle to within two inches from the top with tepid water. It will be fit for use when all the raisins Jioat on the sur- face. This quantity is sufficient for 4 lbs. meal. Mix and knead the dough over-night, use all the liquid, pouring it on the flour in the bowl and adding warm water to the yeast sufficient to mix into the ordinary consistency. Start at once making fresh yeast by putting in the same quantity of raisins, but dorit wash the bottle, and leave a few old raisins in it. This sets it fermenting next time. Poultry.â€”Just a few words on this subject, strongly to advise poultry farming in connection with any other kind of farming you may undertake. Many books and hints have been written on the subject, so I will not go into detail, but just say that I find Minorcas excellent layers ; but Buff Orpingtons are splendid birds for growing, being hardy, and fit for killing in five or six months. I speak from experience, and would say that everything depends on judicious feeding and physicking. I have never had any disease in my poultry run. Once a day the fowls have a good hot mash of bran (about 1 lb. of bran to 18 fowls) and scraps, and early in the morning some mixed food, such as supplied by Calder and Co., Forage Merchants, Main Road, Wynberg, at ioj. per 100 lbs., consisting of mealies, barley, oats, and split mealies. This is very whole- some ; and the reason why so many people lose their fowls is owing to mealies being given as the sole food. At night we give them just a sprinkling of dry food again. Before

145 L TROTTERS STEWED, AND IN BATTER Jime boil together. Have ready some porcelain moulds dipped in water, or moistened with vinegar. Garnish the mould with fresh red chillies cut up, a few slices of lemon, parsley, and even a slice or two of beet-root and hard-boiled eggs. If you have any remains of cold tongue, or little sheep’s tongues, it will improve the brawn. Take out the muslin bag and pour the brawn into the mould. Some of the hard-boiled egg, and other garnishings, can be inter- spersed by adding pieces when you have poured a little brawn in, and then adding more brawn over, and so on, so that the egg is imbedded in the brawn. (Two calves’ feet can also be cooked this way equally well.) Stewed Trotters.—Prepare and boil some trotters as for brawn, and in the same way; when quite tender remove the bones and fat. Then stew the trotters with a few slices of onion. The onion may be slightly browned in fat, or it may be put in just as it is, with pepper, a small piece of mace, a dash of grated nutmeg, and thickened with some finely-grated bread-crumbs. (Any pieces of stale white bread, dried in a cool oven and pounded, are most useful for thickening soups, or rolling cutlets or fish in for frying —far nicer than fresh crumbs. They should be kept ready, tightly corked in glass bottles.) To the stewed trotters add, just before serving, the juice of a lemon, whisked up with the yolk of an egg. This dish makes a nice entree, and is inexpensive—half-a-dozen trotters costing 6d. Trotters in Batter.—When you are stewing trotters for brawn, reserve some of the pieces of meat, without the jelly. Dust a little pepper, salt, and nutmeg over each piece. Have ready, meantime, a nice batter (as described p. 72). Fry the pieces of meat in this. It is a nice dish

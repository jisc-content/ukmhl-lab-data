June 154 ALMOND AND DATE PUDDINGS to-day got two pudding recipes to add to my collection —one IS Miss Leisching’s almond pudding, from an old recipe, as follows. Ingredients I breakfast-cupful of fine bread-crumbs. I pint of sweet milk. I lb. butter (2 ozs. will do). 200 almonds, blanched and minced (or instead 01 this a cupful of desiccated cocoanut). 5 lb. white sugar. 3 eggs. I oz. candied citron. I teaspoonful of finely-pounded cassia. First you soak the bread in the milk, then beat up the butter, sugar, and yolks of the eggs together; now squeeze the milk out of the bread-crumbs and mix them with the other ingredients and the almonds. Whisk the whites stiffly, and add them, beating all the time. Butter a pudding-dish, pour the mixture into it, and bake for three-quarters of an hour, with a buttered paper over the dish. This pudding may be steamed in a mould instead of baked, and in that case should be garnished with slices of citron preserve. Date Pudding.—The second of Miss Leisching’s recipes is date pudding, for which the list of ingredients is as follows I lb. stoned dates. I lb. chopped suet, with some salt. I lb. sugar. 1 cup of bread-crumbs. lb. flour. 2 eggs.

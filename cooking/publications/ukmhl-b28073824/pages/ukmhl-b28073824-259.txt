Dec. BERG RIVER. RIBBON CAKE 243 Berg river, the home of the Melcks, who have splendid thoroughbred horses and prize sheep. On this farm ostriches roam in large droves, and the lovely Berg river winds in and out, running level with its banks, which are wooded with willow, blue-gum, and black-wood, forming a lovely oasis. The soil all along the Berg river is very rich, being much mixed with limestone, and grows fine crops of wheat, oats, rye, and barley. Vineyards do not thrive there, but apricots, peaches, and lem.ons ; the trees die away after three or four years and new ones have to be planted, there not being sufficient depth of soil; but it is a lovely homestead, known far and wide for its hospitality. The river affords much enjoyment, with boating and swimming; there is, however, no fishing. Shooting is a favourite pastime, game abounding. The hippopotami used to be numerous in the river in olden days, but being very dangerous to the inhabitants the last one was shot, and now adorns the museum in Cape Town. The ostriches find their own food here—the saline bush, with succulent leaf, which forms their staple food at Graaf Reinet and Outshoorn, growing all along the banks of the river.

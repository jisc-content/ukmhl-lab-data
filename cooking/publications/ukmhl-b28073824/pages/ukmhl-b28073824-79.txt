63 ATJAAR. LEMBTJES SAUCE AND COMPYT Feb. parboil, putting the peel into water that is boiling; drain but don’t squeeze. ’ To 5 lbs. sugar add 6 lbs. fruit, while it is still hot and let It simmer for about half-an-hour after the sugar is melted. Let it stand for a night, and preserve next day If the syrup seems too little, add a little more syrup made by mixing equal parts of sugar and water, then preserve till the-fruit IS clear and the syrup nice and thick. To know when done, test it as you did the last recipe. Red Cabbage Pickle (Atjaar).—Cut the cabbage into strips, removing the hard stems, sprinkle salt over it and leave until the next day, then drain and lay open on a cloth to dry. ^ When all the moisture has disappeared, put It into sufficient boiling vinegar and allow to boil for a minute or two, adding a few small pickle onions, some red chillies, and some allspice. When cold, bottle and cork well. Limes Sauce (Lemetjes Sauce).—Take 50 limes, cut a cross at one end, but not deeply enough to separate them into pieces. Put on them \ lb. of salt in a deep jar or bowl, pour on them 6 bottles of good colourless vinegar, let them stand a month, stirring them occasionally with a wooden spoon. When settled, bottle the clear liquor, and the thick liquor when filtered ; the limes can be used for flavour- ing soups, pie-meat, or any savoury dish. The best vinegar for the above is acetic acid, which makes common-strength vinegar by mixing one part to six parts of water. To Preserve Limes (Lemetjes Comfyt).—Pare the limes very thinly and lay them in fresh cold water for three days. Then take them out of the water, cut a cross at one end of each hme, put them in a preserving pan with cold water, and set them to boil until they can be easily pierced

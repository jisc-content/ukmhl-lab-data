191 VEGETABLES. BRAISED LETTUCE SepL found every where, even in the barren Karroo ; and later on in October and November there is a white variety from which the bees gather delicious honey. This variety grows at Berg river, and other districts near the sea. The bavianas, dark-blue with crimson centres, and light- yellow, and at Tulbagh bright crimson ones, grow in all the moist paits. Ixia local name, Calossie—is another lovely wild flower of which there are endless varieties in South Afiica. One of the prettiest is the green ixia j it would take too long to tell all the shades of colour in which they are found. As a friend of ours just arrived from England said. One cannot believe that all these flowers are wild, but think they must have strayed out of some one’s con- servatory.” As I write I am sitting by my bedroom window 3-t Wynberg, and before me is my sweet little flower- garden, with its borders of violets and beds of stock so fragrant , and all the lovely oaks with their fresh green leaves, and bloomdng peach and pear trees, so pretty! Truly this spring-time is a glorious season full of promise and hope. September 5.—Kitcheii-garden.—Vegetables.—This month peas, broad beans, potatoes, parsnips, cabbages, spinach, and lettuce are plentiful. Braised Lettuces.—We have so many lettuces now in the garden that it is difficult to keep ahead of them and find use for them before they run to seed. Wash the lettuces well and boil them two minutes, then take them up and place in a pan of cold water. Drain off all the v/ater and place them in a Yorkshire-pudding tin, with bacon top and bottom, onions and carrots, and a bay leaf.

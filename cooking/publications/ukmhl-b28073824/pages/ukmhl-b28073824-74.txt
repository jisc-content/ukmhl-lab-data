58 Feb. INDIAN CORN SALAD. GREEN MEALIES “ Potatoes grow in India and other hotte regions, of which I planted divers roots (that I bought at the Exchange, London) in my garden, where they flourished until winter, at which time they perished and rotted.'’ He goes on to say, “ they were roasted in the ashes; and some when they be so roasted, infuse them and sop them in wine ; and others, to give them the greater grace in eating, do boil them with prunes and so eat them. And likewise others dresse them (being first roasted) with oil, vinegar and salt, and every man according to his taste and liking.” Indian corn salad, from an excellent recipe.—This is made of mealies, and of course where the recipe says to use a tin of Indian corn, we can use fresh mealies boiled. (A green pea salad can be made in the same way.) To I tin of Indian corn add 2 tablespoonfuls of mayon- naise sauce, J pint whipped cream, pepper and salt to taste, and sufficient aspic to set it. Line a mould with aspic jelly, and fill with the mixture. Turn out when cold. A salad of mixed vegetables done in this way would be very nice, especially if the carrots, turnips, etc. were stamped with a fancy vegetable cutter into pretty shapes. Green mealies can also be prepared by stripping off the leaves or hairy part; lay a few of the leaves at the bottom of the saucepan, then lay the mealies on them, sprinkle with salt and cover with more leaves. Fill the saucepan with cold water and boil for an hour. They are very popular too grilled, and sent up very hot on a napkin, to be eaten (bone fashion) with butter. You can make an excellent tomato sauce, which you will find useful in a great number of dishes, from the following recipe—

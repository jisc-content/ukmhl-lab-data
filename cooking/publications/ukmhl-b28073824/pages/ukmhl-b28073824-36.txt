MY OLD HOME 20 loof. 1 he front has some well-preserved stucco-work, which is still much admired by visitors. The wine-making in my young days was done in the old classic way of “ treading out the grape ” (of late years the best of machinery is used), and the world-famed Sweet Constantia took the.first prize at many a French and English exhibition. Mr. Cloete imported the choicest varieties of grapes, and it is to them the Colony owes the delicious" Saschelas, a delicate pale-pink grape for eating; the “ Hermitage,” a beautiful bluish-red grape, which makes a sort of claret, and other endless varieties. The enormous vats, filled with the wines of different vintages, were made of teak-wood, beautifully kept and almost polished; they always impressed me with a sense of the neatness and order which pervaded the whole place. From the long cellar a door opened into a bright room, hung with most interesting old maps—since then bought by the Royal Geographical Society, and now in London old weapons and other relics, some quaint old-fashioned chairs and escritoires ; this was Mr. Cloete’s own sanctuary. From this room the door opened on to a most exquisite view. First there was a flight of one hundred steps leading down to the valley, where was the peach orchard, vegetable- garden, and endless pear trees and bananas, also some coffee bushes brought from Mecca, or raised from seeds of the Mocha coffee, I am not quite sure which. The view from that door looking east up to the mountain, with its dark wooded ravines and its lower slopes clothed in bright pink heather and gladiolus, according to the season of the year, is one never to be forgotten. The place is still in excellent order, and now belongs to the Cape Government, and beautiful wines are still made.

130 May CREAM CHEESE. “ LEMON SOLID ” piesently, for they sound very good, but I must finish what I have to say about our little luncheon, which is merely that we had dessert on the table and a cake, cream cheese, and butter; and finished afterwards with coffee on the garden stoep. The cake we had was Mrs. Van der Byl’s sponge-cake, of which the recipe is printed in Hildas Where is it, p. 28. There are many recipes for cream cheeses. Here is one of Mrs. Longley’s from the book of 1835, which I mentioned previously. Cream Cheese.—Put a dry cloth in the mould and fill it with thick cream, when it must remain undisturbed till it stiffens (about two days), then turn into a fresh cloth and replace in mould. Do the same daily till firm enough, then sprinkle a little salt on it and fold in a cloth for two 01 three days in a cool place, when it will be ready for use. Coffee as the French make it—Talking of the coffee after luncheon reminds me of a quaint extract in Mrs. Longley’s book, marked as being from the Household Almanack—no doubt an annual of those days. It is headed—“ To make coffee as the French make it.” “ Have a coffee-pot with a lip ; pour into it as many cups of boiling water as you wish to make cups of coffee. Let the water boil, then put in as many tablespoonfuls of coffee as there are cups of water. Stir it and let it simmer till the ‘ head falls. When the coffee is done take it off the fire, pour in a cup of cold water, set the coffee on the hearth, and let it stand ten minutes, when it will be fine. For breakfast put one cupful of this coffee to three or four cups of boiled milk and sweeten to taste, and you will find it a luxury at a small expense as great as wealth can procure ! ” May 9.—Lemon Solid.—Mrs. Fife’s recipe for lemon solid

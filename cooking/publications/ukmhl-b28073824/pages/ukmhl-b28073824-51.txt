Jan. 35 THE POULTRY YARD moulting begins I give them daily, for a week, a table- spoonful of sulphate of iron, dissolved in hot water, for 12 fowls and mixed up with the bran mash ; and once a year when moulting, they get sulphur in the same proportion for a week or more. Unless fowls have a very large run they require these tonics. Our poultry run is about 60 feet long and 25 feet wide, and we keep 12 hens and i cock. Mealies are too fattening for laying hens, unless you have a very large field and only feed them with it at night. The supply of eggs and poultry is not equal to the demand near large towns, so one should always be able to get a market for oneâ€™s poultry and eggs. Poultry, if properly managed, can be made a great success.! A gentleman who came out for his health (neither he nor his wife being able to live in England) took a small farm on the Wynberg Flats of about five acres. He grows successive crops of green forage, and one crop of potatoes, which he puts in when his vlei (or pond) dries up; this vlei fills with water in winter, and is ready for planting in January. Of poultry he keeps 200 hens and 10 cocks, both Orpingtons and Minorcas. The former are splendid mothers, and the chickens grow out very quickly, being quite fit to kill in five or six months, and the young chicks are very hardy and find their food in a most in- dependent manner. The Minorcas are the best for laying; ^ Those interested in rearing poultry for sale should study the methods of the National Poultry Organization Society, 12, Hanover Square, London, who issue many interesting leaflets on Hatching and Rearing, Suggestions for Collecting Depots, etc. As the seasons at the Cape are the opposite of those in England, it is possible that by good organization our summer eggs would find a good sale in the London winter months.

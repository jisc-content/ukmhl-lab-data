HOUSEHOLD HINTS App. 291 some description of earth closet, of which many excellent kinds exist—as earth is itself a great disinfectant. “ If nothing else is possible, a quite simple plan is two iron buckets, which can be kept quite clean and limewashed constantly (and used alternately), with the usual wooden seat. An old coal-scuttle full of earth and a scoop to put it on with is kept in the shed used, the earth being kept under cover or specially dried. All must be kept as dry as possible—no slops should be emptied in an earth closet. “ A trench is dug in a corner of the garden and the pails emptied into that and filled over.” To Clean Old Silver.—Make a paste of cream-of-tartar and cold water. Spread this on the silver thickly and wrap up in flannel; leave for a week. Wash well in clean water, and the silver will appear as bright and, clean as when new. A friend says—“ If your silver is very much discoloured, I would advise you to boil it with spirits of ammonia and water (in an earthen vessel). If not very black, brushing with a plate-brush and some ammonia will do.” Probably the former would be best for filigree silver, which hard brushing might injure, or you might try a little whiting, moistened with methylated spirits, put on and left to dry, and then brushed off with 2.soft brush; it cleans ordinary silver well. Stains on silver, caused by medicine and neglect, can be removed by using a little sulphuric acid with a soft flannel pad, and carefully rinsing the silver at once in clean water. , For less ingrained stains the pulp of a lemon, well rubbed in and then washed off, is good, and the silver, when dried, should be cleaned with ordinary plate polish to brighten.

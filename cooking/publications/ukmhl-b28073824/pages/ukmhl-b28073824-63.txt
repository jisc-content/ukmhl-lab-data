Jan. 47 CAPE PISH AND FISH-CARTS along the coast. The fish as they are caught are put into boxes, and when the trawler comes in, Kalk Bay is quite a sight. The fish are all laid out on the sands—and sold by the bunch to Malay fish-carts and private people who go down to market for themselves. These carts drive up to all the suburbs, and furiously blow their horn to announce their arrival, and kitchen-maids and cooks run for all they are worth to secure a good “ stockfish ” or “ elft,” but very often only the commoner kinds are to be had. Soles are very often caught by the trawler, but where they are sold I don’t know, the ordinary householder never is fortunate enough to buy any. There are a few shops in Wynberg on the main road that have been enterprising enough to retail tempting-looking fish. There is much to learn yet before we at the Cape can compete with other places. The best fish used all to be bought up by a company as soon as it was caught and sent up to Johannesberg, in a cool chamber, by train. Well, this month we have “silver fish,” one of the cheapest kinds ; it is very good for frying and makes excel- lent balls or rissoles (for a good recipe see Hilda's Where is it, pp. 69 and 206). Then there is “ stockfish,” one of the best Cape fish, which is also in season in the spring and summer months. “ Crayfish,” or “ kreeft,” is also plentiful all through the summer. We also call it “ Cape lobster.” Here is a good recipe for cooking it. Scalloped Kreeft.— 3 lbs. kreeft. \ pint milk. A little blade of mace boiled in the milk. 2 ozs. butter.

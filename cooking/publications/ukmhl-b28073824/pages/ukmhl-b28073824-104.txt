March 88 HONEYCOMB GINGERBREAD icing, as described in Hilda's Where is it, pp. 105-6, or as follows— Vanilla Icing.—Take i large cupful of white sugar, and put it in a clean enamelled saucepan, with just as much boiling water as will melt the sugar, adding this little by little. Stir over the fire and let it boil till it threads off the spoon. Beat the white of i egg, flavour when well whisked with half a teaspoonful of vanilla or lemon, and put into a round basin, over which pour the boiling syrup— beating all the time. When nearly cold, spread this over the tops of the little cakes. Anothei thing the children are very fond of, and which is always an item of the birthday menu, is transparent honey- comb gingerbread. Honeycomb Gingerbread.—[This is from a manuscript lecipe-book of i835> which belonged to Mrs. Longley, wife of the Archbishop of Canterbury of that name, and from which a friend has copied and sent me some very good recipes.] Ingredients— lb. flour. ^ lb. treacle. 6 ozs. moist sugar. 4 oz.s. fresh butter. Ginger to taste. Boil the treacle, butter and sugar together 5 minutes, and then mix in the flour and ginger. Pour into a well- buttered dish. When cold, cut in thin slices and lay in a tin to bake. This is more like “ Brandy snacks.” Marmalade.—The marmalade used for one of the sponge- cakes as mentioned above was made from the following recipe, kindly given by Miss Adeane, of Llanfawr, Holy- head, from amongst her Welsh recipes.

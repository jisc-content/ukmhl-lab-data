AGRICULTURAL JOURNAL. LOCUSTS April lished by the Department of Agriculture, Cape of Good Hope. It gives very useful hints, and by kind permission I am inserting their last paper, on Locust Destruction^ in the Appendix to this book. The Department is also going to publish handbooks on the best methods of cultivation of cereals in different parts of the Colony, and regarding the best breeds of cattle, sheep and goats, which will be well worth careful study.

/n>aucb March i.—Autumn.—This is our first autumn month, and IS often very hot and the most trying of the whole year. Fish.—The best fish this month are “ geelbek,” or Cape salmon, and “ Cabeljon ” (Marinade, p. io6), both good for boiling or frying. March 3.—Storing Fruit.—Early in March all our winter fruit, such as pears, apples, etc., are picked and stored. At Constants and Groote Poste in old days the pears and apples were laid carefully on the boards. In houses that have thatched roofs it is a good plan to stick the stalks of the quinces, which are purposely picked with a stalk attached, into the under-side of the thatch. Grapes, too, with a piece of woody stem stuck in the thatch or care- fully suspended will keep for nearly a month. Fruit that is stored should be often looked over, and any that has become bad picked out and thrown away, or buried, as it spoils the rest. Chestnuts and Chestnut Pudding.—Chestnuts come into season now, and they grow well in the Cape Peninsula at Stellenbosch, Paarl, Worcester and other districts. ^ Here is a nice French recipe for a chestnut pudding, given me by Mrs. Hiddingh.

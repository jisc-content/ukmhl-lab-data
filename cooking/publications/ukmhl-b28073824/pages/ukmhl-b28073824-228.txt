Oct. MENUS AND INDIGESTION nutmeg, a little piece of butter, a few spoonfuls of milk, and a beaten-up egg, and bake in a pie-dish. Try some kidneys slowly with a little pepper and salt and a spoonful of dripping, and serve in an entrde-dish or flat dish. Put spoonfuls of potato in a ring all round, and put some gravy over the kidneys. This dish of kidneys would also do for breakfast. “Another Man’s Poison.”—Regarding digestibleness, the housekeeper should always remember that the old proverb, “ one man’s meat is another man’s poison,” is literally true, so she must provide for the health of those she is catering for, to suit individual requirements. For instance, I know a lady who cannot touch anything with egg in it, which has always been a great trouble to her, especially if staying with friends who have not arranged to make puddings and cakes without eggs ! But as the result of taking even a small quantity of egg was to make her swell all over, it was obviously poison to her. Another person—a man this time—could not touch anything with cocoanut in it; but he himself only recognized the difficulty when staying in Ceylon, where they put cocoanut in some form into almost every dish. He could not at first imagine what should have caused the sudden feeling of illness—of choking—as though his throat were closed and he could not breathe; but proved eventually that it was cocoanut which was poison to him. Again, a lady I heard of used to faint if she ate but one strawberry 1 And the papers lately mentioned a man who was poisoned if he ate as much as three grains of rice. I imagine these varieties of suitableness are far greater than we imagine, and, of course, such sympathies and antipathies must be borne in mind in menus.

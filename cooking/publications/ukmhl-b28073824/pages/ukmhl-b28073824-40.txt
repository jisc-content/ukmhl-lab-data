MY OLD HOME 24 hard material we want to stitch with our machine, without blunting our needled Different days of the week had different duties. Monday the washing went out; the water used for it came from natural springs a little higher up than the pond described ; the bleaching-ground and big iron pot for hot water were by the washing fountain. The drinking fountain was some way off. Thursdays and Fridays were ironing days —one of the women on the farm doing the washing and another the ironing. The baking was done on Tuesdays and Fridays, by our man cook Abraham. Friday the dining-room was turned out and floors polished; and Saturday the drawing-room was done, and fresh flowers arranged in a hanging basket in the centre, and all the innumerable vases filled; it was such a bright, cheery room with its large windows. We always trained young servants to help the elder ones ; sometimes an orphan was indentured to us ; and we taught them all to read and write and work, and so life went on with its many duties and responsibilities; and I would assure those who may settle down on a lonely South African farm, that life need not be all drudgery, on the contrary, all work done—as unto the Lord—ennobles the humblest task, and the exer- cise of faith and trust makes bright and happy lives and homes wherever we are. ^ Both Dutch and English recipes for soap are to be found in an excellent book.

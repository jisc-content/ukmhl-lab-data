Oct. 214 CHOPS. QUAIL PIE. POLONIES neck of mutton to use up, and we tried stewed chops from my own recipe. These are prepared first by beating them with the blunt edge of a knife, and then laying them in a little milk for a few minutes. Next lay them in a flat stewing-pot, not deep saucepan, sprinkle over them a few thin slices of onion, fried a nice light-brown, some salt, pepper, a dash of nut- meg, a layer of fine bread-crumbs ; repeat layers, same order. Cover close and let it stew gently for half-an-hour, shake the saucepan, add half a cup of stock or water, and let it stew gently for half-an-hour more. Serve as entree. A Luxurious Q,uail Pie.—As quails are very plentiful in October and November at the Cape, this recipe is worth remembering (I see in Hilda!s Where is it I have only mentioned about cooking them in a baking-pot, or having them as a curry); it is called “A Luxurious Quail Pie.” You should have 12 quails, and 2 lbs. steak. ‘'Put a spoonful of pate de foie gras inside each bird,” says the recipe, but if that is not at hand, we use other rich but not strong-flavoured stuffing. Wrap each bird in a thin slice of bacon. Add a smalhtin of truffles, half a bottle of black Worces- tershire mushrooms, 6 hard-boiled eggs, each cut in half, and some Worcester sauce—fill in with rich stock. Cover with a good crust and bake sloivly. Polonies.—For breakfast, or for sandwiches, picnics, etc., polonies are very useful. They are made as follows:—12 lbs. beef, 2 lbs. fat (beef fat can be used ; at the Cape we use the fat of the Cape sheep cut into very small dice—it will keep for months if smoked or dried), pepper, nutmeg, salt, coriander seeds, and 2 ozs. little saltpetre. Mince and flavour to taste, and put into sausage-bags

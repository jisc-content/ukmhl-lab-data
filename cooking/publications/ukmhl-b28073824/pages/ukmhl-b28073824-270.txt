POT-POURRI. GOOD-BYE! Dec. 254 m giving an old English one. There is nothing so sweet as the old pot-pourri which has been kept for years in the splendid old jars of Chinese porcelain, and somehow the scent of it always makes you realize you are in a home. No hotel ever indulged in pot-pourri! Dry the rose-petals well in the sun, also jasmine, orange- blossoms, lavender, sweet lemon, verbena-leaves, myrtle, thyme, sweetbriar, bay, rosemary, marjoram, and some thin dried rind of lemon. Take— ^ lb. bag of salt. One shilling’s-worth of ambergris. 12 ozs. orris root and gum benzoin. 2 ozs. powdered cloves and cinnamon. I oz. each of mace, storax, calamus aromaticus, and cypress. Pound all in a mortar with a pinch of musk. Lay a thick '' bed of coarse salt at the bottom of a jar; then a layer of dried flowers ; sprinkle on them the mixed spice and some bay salt, then another layer of flowers, and so on till the jar is full; finish up with a thin layer of spices and salt,'N Put on the top a board with a weight on it to press it all together. Do not stir it for two or three months ; then b mix all together daily with a wooden spoon. Add a few ' •' dried rose-petals or flowers each year, and a little salt, and stir, but no more spices will be needed. Some add a dried Seville orange stuck full of cloves.

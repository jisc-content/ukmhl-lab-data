July LEMON BISCUITS. LIMPET SOUP Lemon Biscuits.—The lemon biscuits are always favourites of ours. They should not be made in a great quantity at a time, as they are best eaten quite fresh. I lb. flour. I lb. butter. 1 lb. sugar. 2 lemons. 2 eggs. The flour should be well dried and slightly heated, then rub the butter into it, then mix in the sugar and the peel of the lemons grated. Beat the eggs well and add to the juice of the lemon. Stir the whole together and knead well; roll out the paste thin, cut it into shapes and bake to a light- brown on a tin.

They also scraped the shells quite clean of all smaller shellfish, sea-weed, etc., and washed them again in clean water. Then the shells were well pounded in a mortar, before putting in a cooking-pot, covering with water and boiling for stock. When all the strength was boiled out the liquid was strained through a coarse linen cloth, and to it was added good beef or mutton stock in the proportion of one cup to every three of the peri- winkle broth. A couple of onions had been boiled in the meat stock before it was strained. One dozen peppercorns i68

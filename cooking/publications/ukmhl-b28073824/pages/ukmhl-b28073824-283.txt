App. LOCUST DESTRUCTION 267 to eat their way out, leaving the carcase like an empty shell. There is another fly which also wages war on the locust by attacking the egg masses. The Government Entomologist has reared some of these from larvae sent him with a view of determining the species. Once more we would urge upon farmers the duty of combining to destroy locusts as they make their appear- ance—if each one will work with his neighbour, and if the work is taken in hand as soon as the Voetgangers hatch I out, the result cannot fail to be encouraging—but to ensure .-success, the work must be energetic, systematic, and taken in hand without delay. [Note.—An interesting article in the Agricultural Journal (describes the screens used in Cyprus—a method which There proved more effectual than any other in defending The crops from the locust plague, for whereas in 1882 the ; British authorities in Cyprus paid £12,262 for egg collect- iing, with little result, in 1883, ;^i2,5ii spent in the screen ; and trap system resulted in practically freeing the country cof locusts. Roughly speaking, the screens are made half- ;.a-yard high, edged at the top with three or four inches cof American cloth, so as to give no foothold to the insects. IPits three feet deep are dug on the side of the screen from ■which the swarm approaches, and into these the locusts [fall, and, as there is a strip of tin projecting over the edge (of the pit, they cannot get out and are easily destroyed. 1 Earth is put on the lower edge of the canvas screen to {prevent the locusts getting through. The screens are kept (.erect by wires and poles.]

238 Dec. LIGHTING- A FIRE OUT OP DOORS tion ; if there is room in the cart, I would suggest a few dry fir-cones and chips of wood should be taken. It is no easy task to light a fire in the open. A Kaffir or Hottentot is wonderfully smart at doing so. I have seen them lighting a fire with a tinder-box (every herd about fifty years ago carried a brass tinder-box), and striking fire from a stone they carried about with them. Old stockings (white ones) used to be in great request to make the tinder by burning it, matches years ago not being within reach of the poorest. Break up the driest twigs, and get if possible out of the wind behind a bush or mound ; put a few stones under so as to raise the twigs, and set alight with a match (not tinder-box this time). Don’t be in a hurry, coax it to bttrn little by little till the flame is large enough to allow of thicker pieces of wood, any stumps or dry roots. When the fire is burning well put on the saucepan of water for the potatoes or rice ; by the time either of this is done, say half-an-hour, boiling all the time, there ought to be hot wood coals enough to grill the sasaties ; put on the gridiron, raising it slightly, so that the coals don’t get choked. Sasaties will take about ten minutes on a bright ' fire ; throw a little coarse salt over the coals, it will make it burn brighter. When the sasaties are ready, let the juice in which they were prepared boil in a pan or saucepan, and serve with the sasaties as hot as possible. But alas for picnics!—something is sure to be forgotten, and the cooking is not always a perfect success, and yet we seem to enjoy even the failures which we would grumble over at home. When we get to the stage of coffee, the milk is boiled, and the cup filled three parts with it, and just an oz. or two of coffee-essence added, and I may safely say that nothing

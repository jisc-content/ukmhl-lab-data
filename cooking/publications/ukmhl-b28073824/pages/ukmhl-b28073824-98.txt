March CHESTNUT SNOW. CHIPOLATA 82 with I pint of cream, or milk, and 4 ozs. butter ; stir over the fire till the mixture thickens. As soon as it ceases to adhere to the bottom of the pot, take it off and let it cool. Beat up separately the yolks and whites of 4 eggs and mix them with the chestnuts when latter are cold ; flavour with teaspoonful of vanilla essence, and add a good pinch of salt. When all is thoroughly mixed, butter a plain mould, put in the mixture, and steam for two hours. Serve hot with melted apricot-jam sauce. Here is another way of cooking chestnuts, a very nice sweet dish for Sunday supper, and for which I am indebted to Miss O’Connor Eccles, a well-known authority on cooking. Chestnut Snow.—Boil ^ pound of chestnuts, rub them through a sieve, mix with them 2 tablespoonfuls of castor sugar, and flavour with ^ teaspoonful of vanilla. Line a glass dish with strawberry jam, cover this over with the chestnut, sprinkle over them a few brown bread-crumbs, and put whipped cream on top of all. (The cream should be slightly sweetened and flavoured with vanilla.) Chipolata.—When chestnuts are ripe, a good way to use them is in a “ chipolata,” from Miss Adeane’s recipe, as follows :—Take i pound of chestnuts (skinned) and put them into a stew-pan with a little consomme, sift a little castor sugar over them, and braize for 2 hours. Then cut sausages in pieces the size of a walnut. Also cut truffles, tongue, ham or lean bacon in squares and mix together. Dish all in separate groups in an entree-dish, chestnuts at one end, ham squares at the other, sausages along one side, and use mushrooms the other. Vegetables.—Cauliflowers begin to come in, in March, and good potatoes may be had, and it is well to lay in

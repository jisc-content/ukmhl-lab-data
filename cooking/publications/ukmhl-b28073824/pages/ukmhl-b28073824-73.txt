57 jfebniar^ February i.—Still hot.—In England they say, “There are three fine days in the year, and two of them are in February,” but at the Cape all the twenty-eight days of February are generally hot and fine, and fruit and vege- tables, as well as flowers, are as a rule very plentiful in all parts of the Western Province. Vegetables.—Potatoes, marrows, beans, cucumbers, par- snips and green mealies are in abundance. When cucum- bers turn yellow they may be utilized in cooking, and are very good if scooped out, stuffed with forcemeat, and curried, following recipe in Hilda's Where is it, p. 45. Tomatoes too, which are so universally popular, are usually very plentiful this month. Rice and tomatoes.—K writes that she saw rice served so nicely as a vegetable, in the following way— Some tomatoes were cooked and cut in half, and the soft inside taken out and mixed with the boiled rice so that it looked pink. Then the tomato skins were laid on the top of the rice, and filled up with forcemeat with a good deal of truffle in it. She says the result was excellent, looked ornamental and tasted very good. Potatoes.—It is curious to see how potatoes were treated when they were a new importation. Here is an extract from Gerarde, the herbalist, who wrote of them in 1597.

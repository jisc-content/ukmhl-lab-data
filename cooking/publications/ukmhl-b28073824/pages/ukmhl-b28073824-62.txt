46 Jan. aRBBN ROSBS. BBGONIAS. PISH Whoever wrote it evidently thought much of altering the natural colour of flowers, for there follows “To obtain green roses. Plant the rose near a holly oak and take a small part of peel (bark) from both,” I suppose it is meant that the peeled parts should be tied together? And again—“Plant carrot or beet near rose, pass the branch through the carrot and cover with earth till branch has rooted, then transplant.” What the result of this last experiment would be is not explained. Begonias strike well from cuttings at this time of year, and all the different varieties make such pretty plants for the stoep or verandah, or for pots in the sitting- rooms. Watering. Where much water is given to plants, manure- water should be given twice a week. A little chicken manure, or guano, say as much as an old condensed milk- tin would hold, put into a large watering-can filled with water and left for a day or two, and then about a cupful given to every plant, will make them thrive (the plants should be well watered afterwards). Rosps, especially, are fond of plenty of “ good stuff.” Geraniums ought to be watered once a week with water in which a lump of rock ammonia has been dissolved, and begonias also like ammonia, and should be watered in a similar way.

App. NATAL Pietermaritzburg also abounds in verandahed bungalows and excellent gardens, with the rose in common use as a hedge plant, and every variety of begonia grows profusely. Servants.â€”Servants used to be plentiful in the country districts at ioj-. per month and food (consisting of mealie porridge only) for groom or farm work ; young boys at 6s. per month; but in towns wages are higher. The high wages paid at Johannesburg has naturally had the effect of raising the prices in Natal; but coolies from India, in- dentured for five years, can always be had on application, and make good house servants, Kaffir boys make fair cooks, house-boys, etc., with very little training, as they are very observant; but to those who can afford it, I should say, especially where there are children, bring an English nurse with you !

April POPULAR CORNED MUTTON 107 fine bread-crumbs, seasoned with cayenne or ordinary pepper and salt Fry them slowly in butter or dripping till nice and tender; when done cut in tiny squares like dice. Take four eggs (two will do if eggs are scarce), beat them up with a little milk, then mix in the minced kidneys and fry all in a pan as you would “scrambled eggs,” and pour over squares of toast, buttered, before serving. This quantity makes a large dish. Corned Mutton.—Another old-fashioned Cape breakfast dish is corned mutton, as we used to do it at Groote Poste. For this you want— 6 lbs. breast of mutton. 2 ozs. salt. I oz. brown sugar. ^ oz. saltpetre. Cut off all the shoulder-part and joint the mutton before corning. Lay the meat in a flat bowl, first rough-salting it with just a sprinkling of salt and throwing away the liquid formed. Now take the mixture of salt, sugar and saltpetre and rub all well into the meat and leave in the bowl for three days. Then boil it in water at boiling-point till ^uile te^ider, when the bones will come out easily. Let it cool, putting a flat plate and a weight on it to flatten it. When cold it can be put on the side-table like a ham, or for breakfast or luncheon slices are nice grilled, with a sprinkling of bread-crumbs and pepper. Scarify the upper part of the rib before sprinkling. We call it “ribs,” but it is really part of the breast, about six pounds of Welsh mutton. Eaten cold, plain-boiled, it is very good also. When out in the veldt picnicking or travelling, slices of corned mutton stuck into a stick cut like a toasting-fork and held over a clear-burning fire are very appetizing. As

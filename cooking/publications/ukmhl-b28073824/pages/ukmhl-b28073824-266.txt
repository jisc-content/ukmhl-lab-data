ASPIC JELLY Dec. 250 Three hard-boiled eggs. Any remains of cold chicken or lamb. Cut up the meat over-night into pieces an inch square, put into a saucepan with a quart of water, bring it slowly to a boil, and skim ; then add vegetables and salt and simmer for five hours, when the liquid will be reduced to one pint; if it be less, add a little water ; strain into a basin. Next day remove the fat; soak half a packet of gelatine, or if the weather is hot a little more, in a pint of cold water. Boil up the stock, and when the gelatine has soaked put into the boiling stock, then pour into a basin to cool ; flavour with a little tomato sauce, lemon, or Worcester sauce. Pour a little of this jelly into a mould, and when it is set put some slices of hard-boiled eggs on it, fill up with more jelly and more hard-boiled egg, pieces of veal, ham, or sausage, slices of tomato, if in season, or beetroot, adding jelly in alternate layers, and finishing up with jelly. Aspic.—For aspic (Mrs. Mitchison’s recipe), dissolve a whole quart packet of gelatine in the stock prepared as in former recipe for “ meat jelly,” first soaking it in cold water, and then pouring the boiling stock on to the gela- tine and strain. (I find an ordinary thin glass-cloth, washed and dipped in boiling water and tied to the legs of a kitchen chair turned over on the hearth, the best way for straining or clarifying jelly.) The next day skim carefully every particle of fat, and clear the stock with raw meat— half-a-pound of gravy-beef shred fine. Put it in the sauce- pan with the stock and toss over the fire till a white scum or froth begins to rise to the surface, and as it is on the point of boiling leave off at once (it is a mistake to stir too long). Let it remain on the fire until it boils and bubbles,

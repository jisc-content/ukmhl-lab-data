85 PEARS IN JELLY AND STEWED March Pears in Jelly.—Another pretty variety of stewed pears she mentioned was for each half-pear to be laid in an ordinary saucer with the round side of the half-pear down- wards ; the saucer is filled with pink jelly to the brim, and turns out when cold in a pretty shape with pear right side up, and is served with whipped cream.

Pish in White Sauce.—Here is a recipe (Miss Le Sueur’s) which is worth remembering for cooking fish in white sauce.

Flavour with lemon, cayenne, chopped par,sley, pepper and salt. Cut up the fish, which must be raw, into neat pieces sufficient for a helping, and let it simmer in this mixture for a few minutes.

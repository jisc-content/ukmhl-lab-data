175 Hucjust August and Cold Days.—Though properly speaking the first of our spring months, August is often the coldest time of the year, so winter clothing is still necessary. - Vegetables.—To. the vegetables which were in season in July .may now be added green peas, broad beans, and spinach—all popular ones ! Fruits.—Oranges, bananas (which make such good fritters), and pineapples from Natal. Guavas, Seville or bitter oranges are now in season, which make excellent marmalade, for which a recipe was given in Hilda's Where is it, p. 140, and others in this book. Banana Pudding.—In Pollok’s Reminiscences of India is the following recipe for banana pudding (copied by kind per- mission of the publisher, E. Arnold). There are not too many recipes available for cooking bananas. Take some plantains, have them 'fried in their skins ; when done you must peel and cut the fruit in slices; add sugar to taste, and the juice of two or three limes (.? would lemons or oranges do as well), and the peel of one cut into small thin pieces ; add also a glass of white wine, half a tea- spoonful of pounded cloves, with a little butter. Make a paste as for apple pudding, and put this mixture in it, and boil. Cream, or lemon and sugar with butter is a great improvement (.? as a sauce).

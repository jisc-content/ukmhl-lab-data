Jan. TO KEEP BUTTER COOL Half of a 6d. packet of gelatine. The whites of 3 eggs. A small teacupful of white sugar. The juice of 3 lemons. Lemon essence.

Then pour over it one pint of boiling water and stir till melted, now add the sugar and stir awhile till dissolved, and then add the juice of the lemons, and a little lemon essence. Stir all together and let it set. When quite cold beat this mixture with a large fork until it looks like snow. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth and stir into the mixture. Dip a fancy porcelain mould into water and put the pudding into it—standing it in a cool place to harden. Make a rich custard of the yolks of the eggs to serve with it.

Pour cold water in which a pinch of saltpetre, and a little salt also, has been dissolved, round the butter-bowl (this water may be as deep as the soup-plate will hold, but must not overflow

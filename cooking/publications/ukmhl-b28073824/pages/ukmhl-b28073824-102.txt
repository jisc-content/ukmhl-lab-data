THE BIRTHDAY MENU March 86 in the garden for them to find—a great excitement. For to-morrow one dish is to be— Vienna Biscuits (Miss May Van Renen’s recipe, given I her by Mrs. Drummond Hay), made as follows:—A pinch of salt, I oz. castor sugar, and 2 ozs. butter are rubbed into I lb. flour; you then beat up the yolk of an egg and I tablespoonful of milk together, and add to the flour. Roll out this paste very thinly and stamp it out in rounds with a small tumbler, and out of half the number cut a smaller round from the centre; bake all on buttered paper on tins in a moderate oven a quarter of an hour. Now chop up or grate 2 or 3 ozs. plain chocolate, put it in a small saucepan with 2 tablespoonfuls of water and let it boil 4 5 niinutes. Then stir in 4 or 5 ozs. icing sugar. Let it just come to the boil, and spread quickly on the biscuits—the whole ones—and then press on to them those which have the centres cut out, filling up the cavity in the centre with crystallized cherries or other candied “ comfyt,” or with cream whipped very stiffly. As little V is very fond of “hundreds and thousands,” we have used cream for the filling, and sprinkled the “ hundreds and thousands ” over it. Birthday-cake.—The birthday-cake itself will be from Mrs. Andrew’s recipe in Hildas Where is it, p. 22, and iced and ornamented as described there also, p. 105, as the children will expect the cake to be decorated with name and date. Birthday Menu.—“Brawn” Biscuits.—The menu will of course include plenty of brown and white bread-and-butter, and we shall have some jam sandwiches; a large ginger- bread cake made with brown flour as previously described,

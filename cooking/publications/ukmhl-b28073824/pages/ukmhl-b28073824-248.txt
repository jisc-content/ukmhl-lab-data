6 lbs. sugar. Dec. GREEN PIG PRESERVE. GINGER-BEER serve (from Mrs. Cloete’s, of Alphen, recipe). Take, say lOO green figs, which should weigh about 4 lbs.—if you can get the “white fig” it needs no peeling or scraping. Lay them for a night in a basin, sprinkle a handful of salt on the figs and cover them with cold water, keeping a plate ovei the figs to prevent them from drifting. The next day throw away the water and boil the figs in clean boiling ivater (letting the water boil before you put in the figs). When the figs are soft enough to be pierced with a leed, take them out and throiv them into veiy cold tvater for a minute, and let it drain through the colander. Have leady a syrup made of 6 lbs. of sugar to every 4 lbs. of figs, boil and strain it, and let the figs lie in the syrup for a night. Then the next day preserve them very slowly, it should take about four or five hours. Dry sugar (taking about two cups less of water than of sugar) may be used equally successfully, but the syrup is the oldest and perhaps the safest way. In the dry sugar way the figs aftei being drained are put in the copper preserving-pan and covered with sugar and a few cups of water only, and then boiled very slowly four hours with closed lid. Bottle the figs boiling hot, as you do preserved fruit, in caiefully washed and dried “ Hazel jars.” « The test as to whether the preserve is good is to put a little of the syrup on a flat plate, and if it ripples and looks creamy it is ready.

App. LOCUST DESTRUCTION 266 favourite food moistened with the fungus, and, after the food has been eaten, return the locusts to the swarm. (4) Collect a large number of locusts which have died from the fungus. Dig a hole in the ground about eighteen inches deep and one foot wide. Strew some locusts over the bottom, then sprinkle some water over them. Repeat with locusts and again sprinkle until the hole is full. Do not press the locusts into the hole, but leave them lightly packed. Then cover over with a piece of tin or board and keep the whole thus care- fully covered for four or five days. If very warm weather, four days will be sufficient, but if colder a longer time will be required. At the end of this time remove the locusts, and spread them out in the sun for an hour or two, or until thoroughly dry. Now grind them into a meal. Of this meal, which may be kept dry for a long time until wanted, take two tablespoonfuls and add it to a large tumblerful of water, in which some^sugar has been placed. Leave this in a warm place for 12 to 48 hours, and then treat live locusts by dipping, etc., just as one does in using the fungus when supplied in tubes. Spraying the locusts with paraffin has been tried with success; so also has Paris green, arsenite of lead, and various sheep-dips, but the use of these latter ingredients should be very carefully guarded^ as the veldt cannot be used for pasture, and unless stock can be kept off the locality for some time they would be liable to be poisoned. It may be of interest to note that amongst the natural enemies of the locust is a small fly {Cynomia pictifacies) which deposits its eggs on the locustâ€™s neck, and the larvae penetrate the body of the Voetganger, and then proceed

127 MEDLAR JELLY. CITRON PRESERVE May Medlar JeUy.—For medlar jelly there is a good recipe from Swellendam, in Hilda’s Where is it^ p. 122. Lady Adela Goff’s Medlar Jelly.—Another recipe for medlar jelly, very similar to the above, is Lady Adela Goff’s, but as it varies in some particulars I copy it here, as the medlar jelly made at Hale Park is, I am told, most excellent, and very similar to guava jelly.

Set the pan on the fire to boil till the fruit is soft enough to pierce with a reed or blunt skewer. Then take the pieces of citron out with a spoon, and put them into very cold

197 “BLIND HARE.” A NICE GRAVY Sept. September 19.—“Blind Hare” (Mrs. Becker’s).—Take— li lbs. steak finely minced (mutton will do). 2 slices of stale bread, soak in milk and squeeze dry. 8 cloves, finely pounded, and a few coriander seeds. 2 egg-spoon of ground pepper. Some salt. A dash of nutmeg, oz. butter or dripping. A very thin slice of onion, minced. The yolk of an egg. Mix all these ingredients well together, and shape the mixture into a little roll, bake in an enamelled dish in which you have put some good dripping ; and before put- ting in the oven, cut thin strips of bacon and lay it in this way on the top of the mince, this imparts a very nice flavour to the meat. It takes about one hour and a quarter to bake in a good oven. Serve with the gravy formed in the dish when baking, to which add a little stock and cream, if you have it, and just let it boil up, then serve. It is also very nice to eat cold, cut in thin slices, and is excellent for picnics. A Nice Gravy.—This is a good gravy for mutton, beef, game, or poultry. When the roast is well done, remove some of the fat from the brown sauce in the baking-dish, add a cup of thick cream (or half a cup of milk with a tea- spoonful of maizena stirred into it), mix it with the brown gravy, put into the baking-pan with a spoonful of good dripping; stir about till it boils, then add a little cream, and stir all well over a quick fire to brown, but not burn.

Here are some of them most worth remember- ing. Some are from hearsay, some I have seen in news- papers or made a note of in books I was reading. I can only say that at the time I thought them reliable authorities. To avoid Tough Pastry.—If you do not wish your pastry to be tough, be sure not to re-open the oven door till the paste is set. It is the checking of the even heat which spoils and toughens the pastry. To keep in Gravy.—To keep gravy in the joint put it at once into boiling water, and after a few minutes add some cold—to reduce heat; after this heat again and simmer till done.

Time for Cooking Various Joints, etc.—Large joints should be allowed 15 to 20 minutes for each pound weight of meat. Smaller ones 12 to 15 minutes. A chicken takes 20 minutes, and turkey i| to 2 hours. Rabbits should be cooked a long time, and in plenty of water—close on 2 hours.

We were a large family. The girls were educated by governesses at home—and my brothers had tutors to begin with, and then were sent to school or college—but all the boys chose to be farmers. The two elder settled near the old home, William at Karnmelkfontyn {i.e> Buttermilk-spring, from the white colour of- the water before they sunk the deep well), and Fred at Orangefontyn —and they came over on Sundays, when the family generally gathered in time for Sunday service, which was always conducted by my father according to the Church of England Prayer-book; or if they went instead to service at Darling in the morning, they would turn up in the afternoon for tea at Groote Poste.

It was a busy month, the threshing of the grain took up some time ; later on steam threshing-machines were introduced, and what took a month to thresh out in my young days is quite finished in a week now by the machine. The grain, when threshed, was carted to Malmesbury, the nearest railway-station, the empty wagons bringing back supplies of groceries for the year, as well as whatever was re- quired on the farm—guano for fertilizing the soil, etc. The sheep would be “ dipped ” this month,^ and there were ^ Sheep have to be dipped three times a year. Now a special “ Scab Act” makes dipping compulsory, and special officers under Government travel about the country to see it is done.

176 PINEAPPLES AND GRENADILLAS Pineapple Fritters.—With so many pineapples now coming from Natal, we can have pineapple fritters for ciinner to-day from a recipe in the same book as above. Pare and core a pineapple; cut it into slices and stew them with a little water, sugar, and lemon-peel. When soft, add a little white wine and the juice of half a lime, with a bit of butter. When cold, make a batter of 3 spoonfuls of fine flour, 2 spoonfuls of cream, a glass of white wine, some sugar, and 4 eggs. Beat it all very well together. Put a little butter into a frying-pan, throw the fruit into the batter you made, and taking it out in spoon- fuls, fry them one by one in the butter to a nice light- brown. Put them on a sieve before the fire to dry, and serve hot, with plenty of pounded sugar over them on a white napkin. To Preserve Pineapples (Miss Frances Cloete’s recipe).— Meiely peel and slice them and let them preserve in very thin syrup ^ for several hours. A lemon or two squeezed into the preserve shortly before it zs done improves it very much. August 3.—Green Grenadilla Preserve.—Green grenadillas (a species of passion-flower well known in Natal, the Eastern Piovince, the Paarl, etc.) make a very good preserve as follows. Take about fifty grenadillas when the peel is still soft, cut a cross at one end, and scrape or peel very thinly. Take about a tablespoonful of lime and mix with cold water; lay the fruit in a deep bowl, cover with this lime water for one night; then for a night in fresh water. The third day boil in fresh water, to which a tablespoonful of salt has been added to make it rather brackish—boiling for ^ Syrup made of sugar the same weight as fruit, as for all preserves.

LOCUST DESTRUCTION. 263 INFORMATION FROM THE AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY REGARDING LOCUST DESTRUCTION.^ In view of the appearance of Voetgangers^ in large numbers in various divisions of the Colony, the question of combined systematic efforts on the part of farmers demands early consideration. It is in their earlier stages—when the Voetgangers are hatching out, and for a few weeks afterwards—that most good can be effected, and at the smallest expenditure of time and labour; but to be of any permanent effect, active measures should be taken at once, and should most emphatically be the result of combined effort on the part of all the farmers in the locality in which the Voetgangers appear. We would not underrate the value of individual effort, but to be effective it must be the combined effort of ^ A friend draws my attention to a passage in the Life of Lord Lilford^ by his sister, in which he mentions receiving “ seventeen sacks of dried locusts from Larnaca, not very fresh, but much appreciated by more of my birds than I can well enumerate.” Is it possible they could be used as food for poultry or pheasants ? ^ The young locusts generally appear after the first summer rains, as soon as the crops are cut.—H.

NATAL App. 271 storms occur, and bad hail-storms about Christmas are common. I am told that in Italy experiments have been tried to dispel hail-storms by firing cannon, I do not know with what success. Frosts.—In the high lands the first frosts appear in May, and till August the nights are cold, with hot sunshine and a cloudless sky all day. There is no frost on the coast lands, but often a dry, hot wind through the winter, and in summer plenty of rain. Clothing, for the coast as thin as possible all the summer ; a thin serge could be worn in the winter sometimes ; on the high lands clothing practically the same as here; warm wraps are a necessity if much driving is done. House rent, much the same as in the Cape Colony, higher in large towns than in small villages; in Greytown we paid ;^i8 a year for a good four-roomed house; it would be more in Maritzburg or Durban. Farms as a rule are large, looo acres being considered a small farm in Natal. Little plots of ground on the coast are rented by Indian coolies, who grow fruit and vegetables and undersell every one else, and so agriculture does not pay on a small scale, besides which the country and soil is so fruitful that every house (even in towns) has its own garden, in which there is room for a cow! and a vegetable garden ; and as irrigation is nearly always possible, crops can be grown nearly all the year round. Fruits.—On the high lands apples, apricots, plums, peaches, pears, strawberries, and Cape gooseberries grow profusely, while on the coast pineapples, bananas, grena- dillas, guavas, mangoes, pawpaws, oranges, lemons, and naartjes are to be grown in abundance. The suburbs of Durban are full of pretty houses with lovely gardens.

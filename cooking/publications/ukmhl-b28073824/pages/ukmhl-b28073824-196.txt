180 ^Jug. MACARONI CHEESE. SCONES this way, and with strips or stars of pastry laid in the treacle. Macaroni Cheese.—This is a very nice savoury dish (Miss Le Sueur’s recipe).

Beat well with a knife for a few minutes, and roll out and stamp into round shape with a wineglass. Put them on to baking-tins and bake in a warm oven as for pastry.

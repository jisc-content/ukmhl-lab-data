MY OLD HOME It is worth a visit from any one coming to the Cape. Carts at the Wynberg Station take people over, but a permit is required, and can be had on applying to the Agricultural Department, Cape Town. I have before said that the Cape Dutch were famed for their hospitality, not only to the English and Dutch, but French and Russian. My uncle and his eldest son, who married my eldest sister, spoke French fluently, and every French man-of-war that came into Simons Bay, on their way to the East or from there, would always be called on and some invited to lunch. What fun it used to be! and they would invite the family back to lunch or dejeuner on board in Simons Bay. How well I remember, on one special occasion, driving down against wind and tide, for no railroads or even hard roads existed then, and unless you crossed “ the beaches ” at low tide there was consider- able danger. All this, no doubt, added to the excitement and pleasure of a dance on board. The English naval people were always made most wel- come, and the officers enjoyed riding up, and there would be picnics on the hills, and walks up Table Mountain ; the party meeting at Hout’s Bay Neck, driving there by six in the morning and returning to dinner at Constantia in the evening, full of happiness, and none too tired even for a round dance or song. Life in those days, in the seventies, was most enjoyable, but the rush of life now seems to have swept much of the old- world hospitality away, people seem too busy now, but there is no doubt that, given a moderate income, the conditions of life at the Cape can be made most enjoyable. The climate lends itself to outdoor excursions, walks and pic- nics. Gardening is a most enjoyable occupation.

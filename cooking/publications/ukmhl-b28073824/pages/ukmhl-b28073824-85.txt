Feb. 69 ROSES. SHEEP’S BRAINS lb. Valentia almonds minced. 2 bottles of vinegar (Crosse and Blackwell’s, or very good Cape vinegar). Boil all these ingredients together till nice and clear, stirring all the time, and when done put in small jars and cork well. I shall use this recipe to turn to account the abundance of red chillies this month. Blatjang made this way will keep for a year. I have sent it to England several times, and have had orders for another supply from those who prefer it to chutney. If fresh chillies are not available use \ lb. cayenne pepper instead, but it will not have such a nice red colour. All the ingredients should be passed through a very fine mincing-machine.

Roses.—In the hot summer months I find that a little top-dressing of rotted straw, with a sprinkling of fowl manure, is splendid for roses; watering liberally every evening. The roses we budded in January must be kept very moist, and the buds carefully supported with a stake in case of strong wind ; and old wood cut back.

I wanted to prepare some- thing to tempt her, and as she was ordered only to have something quite light, I thought first of getting some sweetbreads, but they were very expensive, and so it oc- curred to me to try a recipe I have for cooking sheep's brains,

183 SAG-O AND PONTAC SHAPE Az^g. teacupful of sago and 2 teacupfuls of boiling water. Stir over the fire till clear; if too thick add a little more water. Add the juice of 2 lemons and the grated rind, and sweeten with golden syrup. Garnish the mould with slices of lemon, pour in the mixture, and add a layer of slices on the top. Sago and Pontac Shape.—Mrs. Clayton’s recipe for sago and pontac shape is as follows. Take a cupful of sago and boil in sufficient water to make it clear. Sweeten with a cup of sugar and stir in a glass of pontac. Put in a mould to cool. August 24.—Plower-holder.—I must note down how prettily S arranged the flowers for luncheon. There was a large old blue-and-white bowl, so wide for its depth that it was difficult to make the flowers stand in it. She quickly twisted some coarse wire about till it resembled a large ball—with one flat side on which it stood—of large open meshes. K said it looked like a battered old muzzle, which well describes it. This was laid in the bowl, and the stalks of the flowers held by the network of meshes so that they stood out beautifully, as well as the light grass and maidenhair-fern leaves. We shall always keep this mesh netting for placing in our big bowl in future. It has the same sort of result as the strips of lead the Japanese use to hold long-stalked flowers in position in a shallow bowl.

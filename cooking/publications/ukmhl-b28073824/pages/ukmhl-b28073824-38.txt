MY OLD HOME 22 By November and December summer has set in and the fields are ripe for the harvest. What a pretty sight it is to see the reapers ! Some twenty-five years ago reaping- machines were not so common as now, and though the work is now quickly and far less expensively done, it is not so interesting as watching the band of trained men as they gracefully handle the scythe with that peculiar swing, and neatly lay down the golden sheaves. Soon all is safely garnered in and ready for the threshing- machine, and if there has been no rust in the wheat, what grateful rejoicing there is at the “ Harvest Home,” when the labourers are generally regaled with some extra dainties. And so the .sheep having been shorn and the crops gathered and the men settled with, there comes a lull in the busy farm life; though the vineyards have to be sulphured for oidium,i and the sheep dipped, the.se are but minor matters. I forgot to say that ostriches roam about in small numbers in their natural state in the Flats towards the seaside, and I remember one summer’s evening, near Christmas time, our faithful old Hottentot ox-herd came in, gravely saluting “the master,” and scratching his head, as they are wont to do, said, “ Master, I have found a nest with seventeen ostrich eggs a little way inside your boundary ” (in those days the farm was not small). Of course there was great excitement, for just then ostriches were at a premium, and in due course of time these eggs were hatched and the young ones caught and brought home. The heart-broken parents were left, I am sorry to ^ The blight that ravages the vineyards and spoils the grapes unless sulphured constantly.

196 Sep. HERRING SALAD. PENGUIN EGGS Dutch Herring Salad.—For the Dutch herring salad (Mrs. Spence’s recipe) take— 3 salted herrings. I large Spanish onion. A tablespoonful of chopped parsley. I hard-boiled egg, separating yolk from white. Soak the herrings in cold water for a night, then boil for five minutes and separate the fish from the bones. Cut the onion in thin slices, pour boiling water and salt over them to take off the roughness of the onion, drain it off and strain, mix the fish and onion together with some salad oil, pepper, and vinegar. Garnish the dish with chopped parsley and hard-boiled eggs (white chopped and yolk crumbled), and beet-root cut in slices and stamped out with a cutter, arranged prettily in a pattern on the top of the salad. Penguin Egg Savoury.—The savoury will be a very nice one, made of hard-boiled penguin eggs mashed very fine, add a little piece of butter, some anchovy paste, a little cayenne and salt, and spread on hot buttered toast. Pen- guin eggs are brought in quantities from a small island on the West Coast, and are plentiful in June, July, and August. Fruit Pudding.—The cold fruit pudding is one we often have for Sunday supper. Boil I lb. of any kind of fruit—apples, quinces, plums, etc. —to a pulp, and sweeten to taste. When cold add a very little butter, and four well-beaten eggs. Butter a mould well and sift into "it a thick layer of bread-crumbs, pour the fruit gently into the mould so as not to disturb the crust of crumbs, then cover the top of the mould with a layer of crumbs half-an-inch thick. Bake for an hour in a moderate oven, and turn out when cold. This is Mrs. E. Eksteen’s recipe.

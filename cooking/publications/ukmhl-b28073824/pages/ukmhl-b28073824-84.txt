68 Feb. A PRETTY KITCHEN-GARDEN. BLATJANG it requires a strong, deep soil, and where one can easily irrigate it in dry weather. A pretty Kitchen-garden.—How few think also of the possibilities of arranging a kitchen-garden ornamentally! But what pretty effects might be had with such a beautiful variety of foliage and fruit as, say, parsley, the crimson leaves of beet, some of the handsome kinds of curly kales—almost like miniature palm trees in their growth—carrot leaves which change to such beautiful tints, the blue flowers of borage, hedges of scarlet-runners, great clambering plants of cucumber and vegetable- marrow or melon, clusters of scarlet or yellow tomatoes— one could make an endless variety of beautiful groups. February y.—To-day I have been looking through my old recipe-books to see how I could best use the red chillies while they are so plentiful, and I find there is a good recipe, which will keep well, for blatjang (the Malay condiment)—this keeping kind is my own invention. All Cape housekeepers know how useful blatjang is to add to fish sauce, etc. My recipe for it is as follows— Blatjang.—Soak i lb. dried apricots over-night in vinegar. Take ^ lb. fresh red chillies, and (after removing the seeds) pass them twice through the mincing-machine. Take 12 large flat white onions, and after taking off the outer skins, bake them in the oven in an enamelled dish, and then pass them also through the mincing-machine. Now mash or mince up the apricots you soaked over-night in vinegar. Besides the apricots, chillies, and onions, you will want— 1 lb. brown sugar, lb. salt. 2 tablespoonfuls coriander seeds. I large garlic.

38 Jan. aARDBNING. WELLS AND WATER tigation has shown that fowls remain in as healthy a condition, and lay as many or more eggs, when kept in unfloored houses as they do when kept in houses pro- vided with floors.” Gardening.—I have so often been asked by new arrivals from England, who are contemplating making this land of ours their home—“ Can’t you write us a little book on gar- dening } and give us a few hints when to sow our seeds, as you gave us recipes in Hilda's Where is it to make your Colonial dishes and preserves.” I would advise them to get an interesting shilling pamphlet. Hints on Gardening Generally, by William Gowie, published by Grocott and Sherry, Grahamstown. There is another pamphlet, also a shilling, called Garden Notes for the Colonies and Abroad, by Messrs. Carter, High Holborn, London, which would be useful. If you are living in any part of the colony where rain falls in summer, such as the Eastern Province— Grahamstown, Queenstown—these books would be specially helpful. If you live in the Cape peninsula itself, you might sow your seeds a month later, unless you can water freely. Storing Water.—Water is always needed in the garden. In places where it is scarce many people have large under- ground tanks as well as dams. Artesian Wells are common now-a-days, and air motors are much used for pumping the water up wherever the house stands on higher ground. At the Towers, where one of my brothers lives, they have an “ air motor ”—something like a windmill—in the garden, which sends the water up to the house. I hear there is a man out here now who was very suc- cessful in finding water in Egypt and the Soudan, but I don’t know if this water-finder has been equally successful

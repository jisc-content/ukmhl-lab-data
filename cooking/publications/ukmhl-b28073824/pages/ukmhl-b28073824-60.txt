GREEN BEANS. CREAM SAUCE Jan. 44 Where is it, p. 218; and for Aspic, Hilda, p. 119. But instead of a quart of boiling water in latter recipe, I dissolved the gelatine in well-flavoured stock. It was pronounced excellent. Green Beans.—It is in January that green beans are plentiful, and we pick the young French beans every day, so that they do not become coarse or stringy. We then get a large earthenware jar and lay in it alternately a layer of freshly-gathered French beans, and on them a sprinkling of salt, and so on till the jar is filled, ending with plenty of salt at the top. If preserved like this they keep well; and when wanted we take them out, wash them well and lay them in water for a time to prevent their being too salt. (A friend tells me in England they do the same, using an earthen jar with a slate on top weighted with a stone or brick, and buried below the reach of frost.) The beans can be boiled, cut up or whole whichever is preferred, then drained, warmed up, and a lump of fresh butter and a squeeze of lemon added, and a little chopped parsley on the top ; or they can be served with white cream sauce made as follows— Cream Sauce.—Dessertspoonful of butter, ditto fine flour or maizena rubbed well together. Add 2 spoonfuls of boiling water or milk, a little salt; and when stirred quite smoothly over the fire for a few minutes add a tablespoonful or more of cream. Serve over any boiled vegetable.—My own 7'ecipe. “Waste not, want not.”—Green beans preserved this way have more flavour than tinned ones ; and besides, the principle of not wasting anything should never be lost sight of in housekeeping! They keep all through the winter. In the Karroo they cut up and sun-dry the green beans, and in that dry air they keep very well.

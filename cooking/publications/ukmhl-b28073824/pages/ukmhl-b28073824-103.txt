To make a variety, one of these two sponge-cakes will be flavoured with orange and then coated with a layer of marmalade, as described in the same book, p. 105, and the icing over it also flavoured with orange, and various biscuits and little cakes, among them some “Brawn” biscuits (named after a place), which are very quickly made as follows :—Put a handful of flour on a board and mix with it half a teacupful of cream. Roll out thin and cut with tumbler or wineglass. Bake in a very hot oven for a few minutes.

Butter about I dozen little tins and pour in the mixture. Bake in a quick oven and turn them out carefully, when done, on a sieve to cool.

MY OLD HOME 7 the fermented juice of the fresh “ Steen ” grape, or “ Hane- pot,” for the yeast made of raisins. The Hanepot grape was also now made into Grape jam.^ The fruit remains whole if carefully preserved. We used sometimes also to make raisins. The grapes, after being sorted and all the bad ones taken out, are put into small baskets, and dipped into a large pot of boiling “ lye,” made of the ashes of a shrub called Gouna, growing on the Karoo—which contains a quantity of potash or soda. This extract is made so strong that an egg could float on it, and the grape after being immersed in the boiling mixture for a few minutes cracks ; we then lay them out on mats on our flat roofs, and in a fortnight they will be beautifully clear and dry for packing away. Excellent raisins are made at Worcester and Robertson, Cape Colony, it being very dry and warm there. Many of the farm labourers, whose homes were at the nearest Moravian Mission Station, “ Mamre,” got a holi- day at the end of March, and were allowed to go home for a few weeks. Everything after a long South African summer has a burnt-up and very dry appearance at the end of March, and every one welcomes the first showers. In the Western Province, where my home was, less rain falls in the summer than in some other parts of the Colony, and those who saw the country with its brilliant carpet of wild-flowers in September and October, would hardly believe it was the same desert-looking place they saw in the latter part of March, and yet it is marvellous how the sheep and cattle find their food on the hills, every scrubby little bush affording pasturage. The climate during the month of April is most delightful. ^ Hilda's Where is il, p. 84.

ASPIC Dec. 251 then draw aside, place the lid on the saucepan, just leaving a crack for the steam to escape; let it stand in a warm place for twenty minutes, then pour through the cloth or serviette tied at each corner to the leg of a kitchen chair. If these instructions are carefully observed it will run clear after two or three times passing through the bag or cloth. If by accident it should not be clear, boil up again and let it stand as before; it is sure to become bright. Having cleared the stock, arrange the aspic in an orna- mental design. Place a tin mould in a basin and pack it round with ice, or, if no ice is to be had, cold water into which a handful of salt and saltpetre has been thrown, and placed in a current of air, will soon cool it. Pour a little jelly in the mould, and when set, make any pretty design with the white of egg, such as a large daisy, the petals being cut from the hard-boiled white, and half the hard-boiled yolk forming the yellow centre of the daisy. Add some more jelly, and when that is set rub the yolk of the egg through a wire sieve on the jelly; pour a little more jelly on that, then a little more egg, taking care the jelly sets each time. After having made this band half-an-inch deep of this “gold-dust,” proceed to fill up with clear jelly, a few pieces of cold chicken, tongue, etc. Aspic for Garnishing.—Chicken or lobster salad are often served inside a rim of aspic jelly, or simply garnished with pieces of aspic jelly cut in fancy shapes, or crumbled. To make the rim or border put the aspic into what is called a narrow border moidd. When ready to serve turn out on a dish and fill the centre with chicken or lobster salad. Sprigs of parsley and a few radishes may be arranged in the aspic to give it a good effect.

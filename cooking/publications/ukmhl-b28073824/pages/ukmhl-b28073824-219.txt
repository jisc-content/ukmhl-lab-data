203 ©ctobei* October 2.—A most enjoyable month.—October, like Sep- tember, is a most enjoyable month, and flowers abound, and the oaks with their fresh leaves make the Cape Peninsula perfectly lovely. Many varieties of heath are brought in from the country districts. Fruit.—Strawberries come into season, but not plentifully. Loquats, oranges, naartjes, etc., are to be had much the same as in September. October 3.—Nut Cake (Miss Le Sueur’s).— i|- breakfast-cupfuls of sugar. 2 tablespoonfuls of butter. 2 eggs. 1 tea-cupful of milk. 2 teaspoonfuls of baking-powder. 2 tea-cupfuls of fine flour. I cupful of walnuts, crushed with a rolling-pin or chopped. Mix the sugar and butter to a cream, then add the eggs, well beaten, then the milk. Mix the baking-powder with the flour and stir in gently, lastly the walnuts. Stir all well and put into a well-buttered mould and bake in a moderate oven for an hour. Walnuts, hickory-nuts, and butter-nuts are best, but other nuts will do.

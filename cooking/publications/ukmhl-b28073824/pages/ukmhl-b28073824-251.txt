December 20.—Christmas Picnics.—How funny to tho.se unaccustomed to our summer December day.s is the adver- tisement which so much amused our friends in Fngland, to whom we had .sent a Cape paper, of Shady hats for Christinas Picnics!—\mt in our colony this is the great picnic time. And Chri.stmas will soon be here, .so we provide our.selves with nice shady hats at Duncan Taylor's for 9</., and trim them lightly and prettily in readiness for a stay at the .sea- side. Many people like the more wild and unfrequented place.s—.such as Gordon’s 15ay, near Sir I^.>wrie's l^’a.ss, and Hermannspetrusfontyn in the Caledon di.strict, which is particularly lovely ; and soon there will be a railway running clo.se to it. At pre.sent the journey is accomplished by cart or wagon. There is game shooting in the neigh- lx.»urhood as well as fi.shing. Camping-out for a few day.s is mo.st enjoyable. Cape Point is well worth a visit, with its grand scenery and the drive over the hills. Well, .shall we go to Cape Point for a week during the Christmas holidays? We all agree it will be delightful! The gentlemen of the party make arrangements with a farmer living at Simonstown over Red Hill to provide a tent-wagon and good span of oxen. We also take a .small tent for .some of the party to sleep in, the rc.st will sleep in the wagon-; for each, rugs, a light gutta-percha mattress that folds up, a pillow. All this tidily strapped up goes down by train to Simon.stown.

MY OLD HOME 23 say, to mourn their loss, for indeed ostriches are most affectionate parents. My eldest brother, who had a great many on his cattle-farm, has often told me it was heart- rending to see them when robbed of their young. The young birds throve splendidly under our care—fed on cut-up lucerne, bran, and chopped hard-boiled eggs just at first—and were sold at ;^’i5 apiece when a year old. Ostriches are such voracious creatures that many practical farmers have found it does not pay to keep them in camps in large numbers, if they have to be entirely fed. If kept in large enclosures, they find their own food from a succulent saline shrub which grows in the eastern pro- vincial parts, and also at Berg river, where the Messrs. Melck still have large numbers of birds.^ Living so far away from town or village, everything possible was made on the farm ; for instance, the hard fat from the sheep and goats that were killed was con- verted into excellent candles, for kitchen and stable use. Though they gave a bright light, they constantly required snuffing, which was very awkward. Perhaps we could have escaped this difficulty by plaiting the wicks. Candle-making, I fear, is a thing of the past everywhere. In the most out-of-the-way place the trader goes to, shops spring up and paraffin and candles are sold. Soap was also made. Now that also is easily got everywhere. Fat or tallow is used by the Boer people for soap-making a lady who lived at Potchefstroom told us how every house- hold made their own soap—and we are often supplied with a piece of Boer soap from Berg river for rubbing on any ^ An interesting practical book on Ostrich Farming in South Africa, by Mr. Arthur Douglas, of Fleatherton Towers, Grahamstown, is pub- lished by S.

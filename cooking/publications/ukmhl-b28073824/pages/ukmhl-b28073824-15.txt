PREFACE My former hook, Hilda^s Where is it of Recipes, vjdiS most kindly received by the public both in England and South Africa, and it has occurred to me that it would be a help to many who, like myself, were born in South Africa, as well as to those who intend to make their home at the Cape, or whose official duties bring them out here for several years, if I wrote down some more of my house- keeping notes. I shall be glad indeed if what I have learnt by lifelong experience and experiment should lighten the labour of those beginning the responsibilities of housekeeping in our dear old Colony, under conditions new and strange to them. In order to avoid repetition, wherever a recipe has already been given in Hilda's Where is it, reference to it is made instead of the recipe itself being quoted. I have also noted down from reliable sources some information regarding other parts of South Africa with which I am not personally acquainted. H. J. D.

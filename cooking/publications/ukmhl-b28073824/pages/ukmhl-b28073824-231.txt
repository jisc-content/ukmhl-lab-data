215 FILLET DE ROMANO. SARDINE SAVOURY Oct. procured from the butcher (or, if on a farm, use the ox-guts well cleaned). Tie up in quarter-yard lengths, and hang in the smoke for a day—boil them the next day for about lo minutes, and then hang in a dry place. They will keep for months. Fillet de Romano.—Mrs. Honey’s recipe for Fillets de Romano is very good—i-^ lbs. of under-cut of beef, cut into little fillets and fried as you would steak. They should be stacked neatly in the dish when done, and the following sauce poured over them. Sauce.—One cup of any good stock, the yolk of 2 eggs, a little pepper, salt, cayenne, a tablespoonful of tarragon vinegar, a little lemon-juice, and some chopped parsley, all well mixed. Let the stock boil, and beat up the yolks with some lemon and add to the boiling stock as you would make thin custard. October 29.—Sardine Savoury.—Sometimes one wants a little savoury that is quickly made. Here is one of sardines. Bone the sardines, and halve. Fry in a small omelet-pan with a mixture of the oil in the tin, cayenne, and anchovy sauce. Or bake in a hot oven and serve on toast hot.

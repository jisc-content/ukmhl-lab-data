MINCE-MEAT FOR CHRISTMAS Nov. 223 November 15.—Preparation for Christmas.—With a view to Christmas festivities we must prepare the traditional mince- pies and plum-pudding, however hot the weather may be, and these are usually prepared six weeks beforehand. Many people in the Colonies are sent plum-puddings now-a-days straight from home, and it is astonishing to learn in these days of quick posts how many go out to the Cape, to Canada, to Australia, and China, and India. I am told that London confectioners annually send thousands to the Colonies. We must, however, record some good recipes for those of us who are not likely to receive such solid Christmas presents, and I think we may promise ourselves good mince-meat and plum-pudding if we carefully follow these recipes of Mrs. Mitchison’s (we make ours beginning of December). Mince-meat.— I lb. suet. I lb. currants. I lb. apples. \ lb. mixed candied peel. I lb. sugar. I nutmeg, grated. I- teaspoonful mixed spice. The peel and juice of a lemon. A teaspoonful of salt. Chop the suet fine; wash and pick the currants, stone the raisins and mince them, peel and core the apples and mince or chop them up, cut up the candied peel, grate the nutmeg and the peel of the lemon, then add sugar and spice and mix the whole well together. Put the mixture into jars, pressing it down as closely as possible to exclude the air, and cover with brandied paper.

95 ALMOND PUDDING. TAPIOCA CREAM March March 24.—Almond Pudding (Miss Adeane’s).— Can one have too many pudding recipes ? Here is one for almond pudding. Cover a dish with thin paste; spread raspberry jam at the bottom. Beat up yolks of 8 eggs and the whites of 2. Mix with them ^ lb. powdered sugar, lb. butter, melted and flavoured with almonds (bitter and sweet almonds in equal proportions, well dried and pounded). Mix all well together and pour upon the raspberry jam. Bake the pudding in a slow oven i|- hours. March 26.—Do we enough appreciate tapioca } I don’t think it appears as often as it might in recipes. I am told that a great many of the ready-made jellies which are to be bought in London are made of tapioca instead of isinglass or gelatine, but “ boiled and boiled for any length of time ” till clear and thin. I suppose mixed with orange juice, or whatever it may be, to flavour. This tapioca cream is excellent (Miss Adeane’s recipe). Tapioca Cream.—To half-a-pint of whipped cream add an equal quantity of tapioca that has been well boiled in milk. Add a little pounded sugar and a few drops of essence to flavour. Serve cold in a glass dish. March 29.—Another letter on cookery books from my friend in London says— “ Do write down the following names on your Cookery Library list.

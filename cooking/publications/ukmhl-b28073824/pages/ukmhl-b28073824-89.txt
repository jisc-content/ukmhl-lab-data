73 “TALKE O’ THE HILL” GINGERBREAD Feb. says, practically “ Parkyn,” for which the following pro- portions are good— 2 lbs. sifted oatmeal. 2 lbs. treacle, lb. coarse brown sugar, lb. butter rubbed in a little brandy. Ground ginger to flavour. This should be baked in a very slow oven, and is good in flat cakes the size of a saucer or bigger. Fruit Gingerbread.—Another variety of gingerbread mentioned in the same collection has currants, raisins and candied peel added to the usual ingredients, but I should think that would rather destroy the characteristics of gingerbread ? “ Talke o’ the Hill” Gingerbread Loaf.—Another good form of gingerbread is from a recipe of Mrs. MacHutchin’s, whose husband is Vicar of “ Talke o’ the Hill,” in Staf- fordshire—a curious name for a village. I am told Talke ” means a hill or high ground, and has nothing to do with conversation ! Anyway, here is the recipe. Put I lb. butter into i lb. flour, add ^ lb. coarse sugar, ^ oz. baking-powder, i oz. caraway seeds, 2 ozs. ground ginger, 2 ozs. candied peel, cut small, I lb. raisins, chopped, 2 eggs, a wineglassful of sherry, i lb. treacle (which generally requires warming). Mix all well together and bake three hours in a slow oven. Allow plenty of room in the tin for rising, and if the cake begins to brown too soon, cover it with paper. It strikes me that this must be of the nature of “ fruit gingerbread,” on which I have been casting doubts ! But the result of this recipe is, I am told, delicious.

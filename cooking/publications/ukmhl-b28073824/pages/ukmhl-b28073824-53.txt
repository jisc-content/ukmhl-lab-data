37 FEEDING AND HOUSING OP POULTRY Jan. suits of investigations conducted at the West Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station will be received with much interest. The first object was to test the respec- tive values of nitrogenous and carbonaceous rations for laying hens, and the second to ascertain the influence of floored and unfloored poultry-houses on the health of fowls. In the first experiment three lots, comprising as many breeds of fowls, were fed for seven periods of thirty days each on a nitrogenous ration consisting of middlings, linseed meal, ground oats, and maize meal in varying proportions, together with ground fresh meat and bone; and a like number of lots for a similar period received a carbonaceous ration, of which maize meal was the principal constituent In addition all the lots had either boiled potatoes or steamed clover hay, and at night all the whole grain they would eat, consisting of maize, oats, and wheat screenings, maize predominating for the lots fed with the carbonaceous ration. The result was emphatic. The fowls receiving the nitrogenous ration gained in weight at the rate of Ii8 lbs. per hundred fowls, as compared with 11 lbs., and though their food cost slightly more money, their advantage is accentuated by better returns in eggs. Not only were the eggs of the hens getting the nitrogenous foods more numerous, but they were larger, more fertile, hatched better, and produced far more vigorous chickens than those of the other birds. Both lots of fowls remained in good health throughout. A subsequent experiment has substantially confirmed the foregoing verdicts, though 'the gain in weight was not so pronounced in favour of the winning lots. The experi- ments as to the flooring of poultry-houses were perhaps a little surprising in their results. Two yearsâ€™ careful inves-

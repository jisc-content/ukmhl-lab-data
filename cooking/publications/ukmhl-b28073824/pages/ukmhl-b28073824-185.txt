Work together 5 ozs. of icing sugar with 2 ozs. of fresh butter; to this add i-| tablespoonfuls of essence of coffee, or coffee made very strong; let it cool before adding to the butter and sugar. Spread this mixture evenly on the cake ; do not cut till wanted. I believe a plain flat sponge-cake is best, and I shall try it for tea to-morrow. The coffee essence we use for picnics {Hildas Where is it, p. 36) would do. Baked Bread-pudding.—H also sends me a very old German recipe for a baked bread-pudding, which she describes as follows. Soak some slices of bread in a pint of milk and three eggs, beaten together. When well moistened fry in a pan with butter. Meanwhile boil in a saucepan a tumbler of light wine, half a cup of stoned raisins, twenty-five blanched almonds, cut in strips, a small cup of sugar, and some pounded cassia (outer bark of cinnamon). Boil all this well. Lay the fried bread when ready in a dish and pour this sauce over it, and serve hot or cold.

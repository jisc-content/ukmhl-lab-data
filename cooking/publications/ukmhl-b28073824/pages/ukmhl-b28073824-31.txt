MY OLD HOME 15 after the happy couple left, we wound up the festive day with a little dance. I often wonder whether people had more energy or strength in those days, for certainly nothing seemed to be a trouble or worry then, though we did so much of planning, arranging, and carrying things out our- selves. Living many miles away from a town, everything was cooked at home. There was the large oven (built into the kitchen), which took a cartload of wood to heat; by wood I mean “ rhenoster bush,” which grows on the hills, and strange to say, wherever land has been under culti- vation, in a few years it is covered with this bush, which makes excellent firewood, and was put round the kraals as fences as. well. When this oven was heated twice a week for baking all the bread required on the farm, we generally made a supply of sponge- and tea-cakes at the same time, and turn-overs for picnics. The lofts in the winter months were well stocked with pears and quinces (apples did not thrive so well, but the large calabash pear, baked in the oven and served with sugar and cream, was delicious). There was always nice fresh butter, and a well-stocked poultry-yard, and with all these home supplies it never seemed a difficulty to have friends staying in the house. There were two visits we always looked forward to with great delight as children. After the harvest was garnered in, in December, my father and mother, with all of us and our nurse, would go and stay with our mother’s only sister, who married Mr. Philip Cloete, and lived on a beautiful estate called “ Klapmuts ” in the Stellenbosch neighbourhood. It took us a whole day to drive there in our family coach, which was a double Cape cart on four wheels, drawn by eight spanking horses. The goodies were packed in the box which formed the front seat of the wagon, (“ voor kesse ”) ;

Feb. WATER-MELON PRESERVES 62 There are no instructions as to what is to be done with the “ thrid ” eventually. February 4.—Water-melon jam should be made now (see Hilda, p. 118), and I have also a recipe for ice-cream water-melon preserve, as follows— “ Ice-cream Water-melon ” Rind Preserve.—Take the rind and scoop away most of the red part, but leave a little of this red part on, peel away thinly the hard green outer part, then cut the rind into squares or any fancy shapes. Lay the squares in a bowl and cover with water, into which a small spoonful of lime and a little salt has been stirred, leaving them in it 12 or 14 hours. Then wash them clean and drain. Rub a very clean copper or enamelled preserving-pot slightly with sweet (Lucca) oil, put the water-melon rind squares, with their weight in sugar, in it and add a few cups of water. (If you have 4 lbs. peel, 4 lbs. sugar, add 4 cups of water.) Let it come to the boil, and then set it on a cooler part of the range and let it simmer for 3 or 4 hours with the lid closed. If not convenient to boil in one day, it may be set aside and boiled again next day till done. A good test of when it is sufficiently done, is to put a little of the syrup in a flat plate ; if the syrup is oily and thick enough, little ripples come on the top as it cools. It ought not to sugar, which it will do if boiled too quickly. Bottle it boiling hot, first warming the bottles to prevent cracking, and cork quickly. This makes a nice dessert dish. Water-melon Preserve with, dry Sugar.—Prick and lay in lime for a night like the peel for any other mode of making the same preserve. Rinse in fresh water in the morning,

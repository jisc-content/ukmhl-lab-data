108 April A GOOD COOOANUT PUDDING it grills the meat so quickly, chops done like this are also supposed to be very nice. April 17. A Good Cocoanut Pudding.—Among puddings we have had lately and liked is this good cocoanut pudding (Miss Breda’s recipe), which is well worth recording. For this you want— 2 ozs. butter. i" grated or desiccated cocoanut (you can buy it in half-pounds). ^ breakfast-cup of fine bread-crumbs or stale sponge- cake crumbled fine. 2 ozs. sugar. A large teacupful of milk. 4 eggs. ^ teaspoonful of vanilla essence to flavour. Cream the butter and add the sugar and the beaten yolks of the eggs, well whisked, then put in the cocoanut and stir well before adding the milk and the bread-crumbs, and lastly the whites of 2 eggs, whipped to a froth. Pour this mixture into a pie-dish, which should not be quite full, and bake it half-an-hour. Have ready the 2 whites of the other eggs, whipped up to a stiff froth, with I oz. sifted sugar and | teaspoonful of vanilla essence. Pile this in large spoonfuls on the top of the pudding and put it back in the oven, to get slightly brown, for a few minutes. You can decorate the pudding with crystallized cherries or candied citron, before piling on the whisked whites. Another recipe (also Miss Breda’s) says—3 ozs. butter, 6 and 3 ozs. sugar to same amount of crumbs and cocoanut. The eggs being divided as in preceding recipe, and half the whites put in at different times.

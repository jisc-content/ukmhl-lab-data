Orange Jam.—Now that oranges are getting more plentiful I shall as soon as possible make some orange jam (from Mrs. Burrel’s recipe), for which I shall need 12 oranges, 3 lemons, 9 pints of water, 10 lbs. sugar. You make the jam as follows— Cut up the oranges and lemons in thin slices, being caieful to take out all the seeds. Pour the water on the cut-up fruit and let it stand 24 hours. The next day boil it for i| hours, then add the sugar and boil until the syrup is jellied. July 19.—I see on looking back at my last year’s diary that this day last year, when we had a party for little F ’s birthday, among other cakes, etc., for tea we had two kinds of almond cakes, some lemon biscuits, and some little drop tea-cakes, of which the description in my book is marked specially, “ This recipe is very good!'

P'or this you will need— -I lb. butter. ' 3 ozs. flour. 3 eggs. ^ lb. sifted or rolled sugar.

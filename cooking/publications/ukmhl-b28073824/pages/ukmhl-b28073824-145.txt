MISS ELLIOTT’S STONE CREAM May 129 K knife, this process makes it very tender; lay it in a pie- dish and pour some milk over it, leaving it to soak for an hour. Now take some onions, cut in rings, and fry them a light-brown in fat. Take them out of the pan and keep hot. Put half-an-ounce of butter in the frying- pan and let it heat well. Now roll the beefsteaks in a mixture of flour, fine bread-crumbs, pepper and salt, and fry them in the hot pan on a quick fire, turning constantly. Be very careful 7iot to put a fork into the steaks, or all the richness will ooze out, but turn them with a knife.

Put at the bottom of a glass dish 3 spoonfuls of lemon-juice with a little of the peel grated and some apricot sweetmeat, chopped small. Then take i pint of rich cream with ^ oz. of isinglass dissolved in two-thirds of a pint of water, and sugar to your taste. Let it boil 5 minutes, stir- ring it all the time ; strain it into a jug that has a spout or lip to it, and when the cream is almost cold pour it over the apricot in your dish, pouring round and round the dish till all is in. You may ornament the cream with what sweet- meat you please. The recipe adds—“ It is not intended this recipe should be as stiff as flummery.” What a nice old-fashioned name “Flummery” is! it sounds like nothing later than the end of last century, and that I dare say is the date of the “yellow flummery” and “white flummery ” which are among the old recipes belong- ing to Miss Elliott (of Holyhead). I will write them out

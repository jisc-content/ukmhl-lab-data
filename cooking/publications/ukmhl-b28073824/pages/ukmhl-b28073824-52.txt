Jan. STILL POULTRY AND £ s. d. 36 during September my friend sold 1200 eggs on an average of 2s. id. per dozen. It cost him about I2J. a month to feed them, the fowls having about two acres of ground to run on. He considers a feed of pollard and bran in the morning {Jiot by preference), and a little mealies in the evening, the best food. Hens should be set early in September—or even the end of August, and then again the last week in February —taking care to set the hens in a cool place on sand, and being careful to dust them with insect-powder or tobacco- dust to keep insects away.

It is a great comfort to have fresh eggs, which we are never without, and I also rear about fifty chickens, more or less—twenty-five in September, and twenty-five in March—and this enables us to have plenty of nice pullets. I attribute never having any disease amongst my fowls to being very careful to keep the run nice and clean, and giving the birds good water, and mixed food, which is not too fattening. I always let them have a run for an hour in the afternoon, and give them cabbage-leaves, etc., every morning. This newspaper cutting lately sent me will have interest for keepers of poultry. I do not know what paper it is from, nor the date. “Feeding and Housing of Poultry.—Experiments in the feeding and housing of poultry are far from common in this or in any other country, consequently the re-

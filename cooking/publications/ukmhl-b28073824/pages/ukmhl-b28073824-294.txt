The struggling which follows is not a result of pain, but reflex action. “ The operation is carried out in the following manner :— The head is taken in the right hand with the thumb against the back of it, the neck being seized with the left hand, then with a quick jerk with the right hand, the thumb being pressed downwards at the same time, the vertebrae are dislocated. Another method is to strike a sharp blow on the back of the neck with a heavy stick. Whichever process is adopted, the body may be hung up, and the large veins of the neck divided. The bird bleeds just as freely with this method as when it is bled to death without the neck being dislocated.—A. J. SEWELL, M.R.C.V.S., 53 Elizabeth Street, Eaton Square, London.”

198 Sept. MAYONNAISE. ST. LUCIA PUDDING September 21.—Mayonnaise Sauce (Mrs. Becker s).—Here is a German recipe for mayonnaise sauce. The yolk of one hard-boiled egg mashed very fine, add to it the yolks of 2 raw eggs and 2 tablespoonfuls of best Lucca oil, the oil to be added drop by drop, stirring con- stantly one way until quite thick; to this add 2 table- spoonfuls of vinegar, some pepper, salt, mustard, and a little pinch of sugar and of cayenne.

I teaspoon ful of salt. I large teaspoonful of baking-powder. Mix the baking-powder with the flour, then add in all the ingredients mixed well, and lastly the milk. Boil in a greased bowl three hours. Serve with a good pudding sauce. September 28.—Tortoises.—The eatable tortoises are at their best in September and October. We used to get them from Saldanah Bay. The tortoise is most nourishing, and scalloped with bread-crumbs, butter and lemon and salt, is most appetizing. Their eggs taste very like hens’ eggs. The coloured people have wonderful faith in the restora- tive powers of the tortoise. A recipe for tortoise soup is in Appendix, among home remedies. Tortoises have been known to live for six months with- out food or water. At Groote Poste one was forgotten by mistake in a seed-basket, which was hung on a beam in the loft from June till April, and when found was still alivp, and had probably hibernated all that time.

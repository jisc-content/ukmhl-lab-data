MY OLD HOME 4 neath the dining-room and drawing-room windows were beds of mignonette, stocks, brilliant masses of poppies and cornflowers, and hedges of pale-blue plumbago. About thirty yards below the front of the house was a small lake, or rather, a large pond ; on the lower side of this w'as a strong bank, cemented inside.

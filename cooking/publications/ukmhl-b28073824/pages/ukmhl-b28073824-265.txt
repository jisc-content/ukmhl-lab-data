Savoury Jellies.—For lunch or breakfast in hot weather nothing is more acceptable than a cold meat jelly. The savoury meat jelly which is not cleared is of course very simple and made quickly. The aspic or clear requires more attention, but will not be found difficult by any cook who will carefully follow the instructions given in the following recipes. It is necessary that the stock used for an aspic should be very strong, consequently it will be found better to clear it with raw meat instead of the white of egg, as the meat always adds more flavour than it takes away in the process of clearing. No turnip should ever be boiled in the stock of which an aspic is made, as it is apt to cause it to turn sour. All vegetables have this tendency in some degree, but none to the same extent as the turnip. Savoury Meat Jelly (Mrs. Mitchison’s).— ^ packet of gelatine, pints of water, lbs. shin of beef or gravy.

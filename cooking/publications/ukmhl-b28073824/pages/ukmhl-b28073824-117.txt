Hprtl April 2.— One of the best months.—April is generally considered one of our best months at the Cape, the atmo- sphere being very clear and pleasant, and no “ south-easters ” blowing. Fruit.—Fresh fruit is not very plentiful, though apples and many varieties of French pears are to be had. Farms.—In reply to inquiries from a friend about small farms near Cape Town, I am writing to say that in those on the Cape Flats poultry farming can be successfully carried on. Some time ago the Government located some German emigrants on land on the Cape Flats ; these men have all done so well that they have built themselves comfortable houses, and most of them keep a few cows and sell eggs and vegetables. Water is plentiful, and artesian wells have been sunk in many parts where there were no natural springs. Good roads have been made, and soon there will be a railroad. The Claremont Flats are much the same ; land is not nearly so expensive out here as in Europe, but then, perhaps, it is not so fertile ; still it is wonderful how soon the most barren-looking spots are turned into gardens by careful cultivation and manure ; guano, sold in Cape Town,

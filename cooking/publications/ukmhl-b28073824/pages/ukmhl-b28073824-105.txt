89 MARMALADE. “ MEBOS ” Mai'ch “ Mrs. Marshall’s Marmalade ”— 12 Seville oranges. 3 lemons. Divide the oranges into quarters and slice them all through into thin slices. Put the pips into a basin. To each pound of fruit add 2\ pints of water. Let all stand 24 hours. Then boil the mixture slozvly till the fruit is perfectly soft. Let it stand again 24 hours. Meantime cover the pips in the basin with water and keep them covered for 48 hours, then strain out the pips and add the water to the marmalade mixture. Weigh this, and to every pound of fruit add i lb. sugar. (The recipe says lbs. sugar, but we have found i lb. enough.) Boil all together slozvly and steadily till the juice forms into a jelly. This is generally in if hours’ time, but the exact time can easily be known by putting a little into a saucer to cool. The mixture must boil till the jelly forms.

The mebos itself can be had at any grocer’s at the Cape, and to crystallize it you make a thin syrup of sugar and water, and pour when boiling hot over about 50 mebos. When they are soft take them out and drain them. Then rub each into crys- tallized sugar and roll up. They will keep well in jars in a dry place, and it makes a very pretty dish for dessert. Or I cup of sugar and i cup of water just boiled and poured over the mebos soaks it. It is then strained and rubbed into the sugar. In Hilda!s Where is it, we say lime-water, but this boiling hot syrup is much better. March 20.—A friend has sent me- an interesting list of

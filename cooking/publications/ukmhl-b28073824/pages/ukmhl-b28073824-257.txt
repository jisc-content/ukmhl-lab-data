Dec: HORSES ENJOY A ROLL IN SAND R 241 here again the wild flowers are perfectly lovely—bavianas, dark blue with crimson centre ; kalossies, from pale yellow to bright orange with black centre, or whole flowers metallic- blue ; bright crimson mesembryanthemums. That night we slept at a cousin’s farm, and started early next morning. After a drive of fifteen miles we outspanned where there was water, and the horses were knee-haltered and allowed to have a good roll in the soft sand, powdering themselves all over. It seems an instinct with all horses to roll after a long drive or ride, and my father always said nothing cooled or refreshed an animal more, I always feel sorry for horses when I see them led about to cool, instead of, what is far more natural to them, allowing them to have a good stretch on soft ground. I think the grooms object to the extra brushing they have to give the horse !—a long digression on the merits of rolling and knee-haltering, my friends will say ; but in travelling it is so necessary to know why a thing is done. The horses being a most important factor in travelling, their wants are always care- fully attended to, and some one of the party watches that some thirsty one does not run to the water before it is quite cool! The coachman meanwhile ties the travelling manger to the pole of the wagon. This manger is made of canvas, and it is so much safer feeding the horses in this way than throwing the forage on the ground, where they might eat sand with the cut hay. Our hamper was next unpacked. Bread, butter, hard- boiled eggs, corned breast or ribs of mutton ; frickadels, that is minced mutton, with bread-crumbs, spices, etc., made into little balls and fried—they are excellent for travelling. We were not far from a farm, and they kindly sent us a jug of hot boiled milk, which we enjoyed.

MY OLD HOME 8 The nights are very dewy, and refreshing rains begin to fall, and soon the country has a soft tinge of green. The farm is all alive, the labourers return from their holiday. All the manure which has been collected in the stables and kraals where the sheep and cattle sleep is soon carted on the lands prepared for ploughing, and when that is done there will be time for a short fortnight at the seaside. May and June are busy ploughing months, when all the farm is astir early and late. The lambs have to be attended to, and sometimes on cold wet evenings we would make a bowl of hot “egg-flip” for our brothers and the young men learning farming on the estate, who came in from collecting any stray lambs on the hills. This egg-flip, by the way, is most delicious and nourishing ; made by boiling some “young wine” {i.e. wine of a year old made on the farm), adding some water, cinnamon, cloves and sugar, and pouring the boiling mixture into a bowl in which half-a-dozen eggs have been well whisked—it was keenly relished and appreciated by the tired men who had been out all day in all weathers. The shooting season closes on the ist of July, and we generally had friends to stay about the 20th of June, when buck and partridge shooting would be the order of the day, a large number of the neighbours alternately meeting on each other s pro- perties, and going sometimes for a day’s shooting to the cattle-farms on the seaside belonging to my brothers and cousins. Meanwhile, the flower-garden gave ample occu- pation to those of us who loved gardening, and we would beg for an active man to dig it while we did the planting it being impossible to get a man spared for work in the garden when the farm work is in full swing. o In July the farmer prepares new land for wheat

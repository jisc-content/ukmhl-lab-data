30 Jan. LAUNDRYWORK. RENT. FIREWOOD lays the table, and prepares breakfastâ€”coffee, bacon, etc. Then we have prayers, and breakfast. Next the butcher comes for orders, and often a cart calls bringing vegetables, or the Damara women living at Constantia bring baskets of greens to your kitchen door. Then the ferns are watered and flower-stands attended to in summer. Hosing the flower-beds takes quite an hour. The maid does the bedrooms until 10.30 and then attends to the kitchen. Most colonial people do a little home dressmaking, and so the days go by. Laundrywork at the Cape still continues to be largely done by Malay women in wash-houses put up by the Municipality in Cape Town. There are a few laundries, but they always seem to become insolvent. On farms the washing is always done by some local person. House rent near Cape Town is rather high, and living not so cheap as in England. Servants also are a difficulty, yet, notwithstanding these drawbacks, the housekeeper need not despair. The climate is beautiful, and makes up for much, and at Wynberg, and the other Cape Town suburbs, every requisite is brought to the door. Firewood is brought to the door, and a very expensive item it is ! I find coke and wood the most economical fuel. Paraffin stoves are a great boon and help to the house- keeper, and excellent toast can be made on a Beatrice stove by adjusting the flame and putting the slice of bread on the top, where you would place your saucepan or kettle. Give the stove a careful wiping beforehand, and the most dainty person would not detect any taste of paraffin, advantage of this sterilizing milk by steam rather than by boiling is that the best part does not rise to the top as a skin, which is skimmed off.

QUINCES AND PEARS March 84 end of a leg of mutton, or of veal, or any white meat, and when boiled and strained add a teacupful of milk as you would for potato soup. Q,uinces—Quinces are now plentiful, and a most useful fruit, much sweeter at the Cape than in England. Most of the old-fashioned large gardens in the Cape Colony near Cape Town had hedges of quinces round them. There are recipes for quince jam and jelly fin Hildds Where is it, p. 179; and for a quince “ sambal ” [i.e. green chutney— a Malay recipe), p. I99 book. ^ auince Jam.—But another old-fashioned recipe from an Eno-lish book is worth recording;—First boil your quinces for"half-an-hour, take off the outer thin skin (as you do tomato), cut the quinces in half, remove the core, and pulp them ; to every pound weight of quince pulp add h pint or cupful of the water in which the quinces have been boiled. Peel carefully and cut up some Blenheim apples, and take i lb. sliced apple to every pound of quince pulp, and i lb. sugar to every pound of fruit. Put iiito a copper or enamelled preserving-pot, rubbing this first slightly with Lucca oil; boil for 3 hours, stirring carefully till done. , March 8.—Stewed auince and Pear.—K tells me that when they have stewed pears for dinner they always put slices of stewed quince between each stewed half-pear, in the circle of fruit, and that this is a great improvement. I should think a most excellent cold tart could be made of these two fruits with a good syrup, and the crust cooked separately as described elsewhere. Baked Pears.-K also told me that they often have pears plainly baked, just as apples are done, and that they Le excellent so. We used to bake Calabash pears at home.

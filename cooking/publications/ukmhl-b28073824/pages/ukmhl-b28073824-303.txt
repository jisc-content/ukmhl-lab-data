INVALID COOKERY App. 287 morning add the rest of the wine and boil slowly for half- an-hour. Tortoise Soup.—The edible tortoise we call sculpatje, its learned title is—Order, Chelonia reptilia. Tortoise proper belongs to sub-order or Family Testudinidae. I know of several instances where children seemed to be just wasting away 2X the ages of two and three, and have been strengthened and restored by a soup made by boiling down the whole tortoise, after chopping off its head, scrubbing it well, and then boiling it till the parts separate. The juice strained and taken. To kill a tortoise, our old cook Abraham used to scratch its back, and when the tortoise put out its head he chopped it off. The legs of the tortoise after it is boiled, and the liver (which is a special delicacy), after removing the gall-bag, eaten with lemon and pepper and salt, is much appreciated by invalids when they can take nothing else (of course it is an acquired taste). It is also very nice when scalloped with a little butter and bread-crumbs.

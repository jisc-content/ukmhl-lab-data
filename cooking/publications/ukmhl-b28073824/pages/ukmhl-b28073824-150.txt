134 May ANOTHER RISOTTO. QUIN’S SAUCE When cooked add about the same quantity (a cupful) of grated cheese, and little rounds of tongue (cut slices flat and then punch out with a cutter about the size of a shilling, into rounds). Bake till brown. Put a little grated Parmesan cheese and butter on the ^top, and serve very hot. A similar dish I have seen mentioned elsewhere was said to be improved by the addition of some sausages fried and served with it, but I see that recipe had no cheese in it. Another Risotto.—Another risotto recipe (Mrs. Clark’s), from Genoa, has much less cheese and would therefore be all the better for a breakfast dish. 4 tablespoonfuls of cooked rice. I tablespoon ful of ham (or tongue), chopped fine. I tablespoonful of chicken or pheasant, chopped fine. I hard-boiled egg, chopped fine. 1 small onion, chopped fine. Put a small pat of butter to get hot, and put the onion in it to cook a little first, then add the other ingredients. When serving up add a spoonful of grated Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper to taste. Serve very hot. May 19.—QiUin’s Sauce.—This, which is a sauce for flat fish, is from a manuscript book belonging to Miss Whiteman, and inscribed Lady Piggotfs Receipts, 1808, and is called Quin’s sauce for flat fish. 2 heads of garlic, each clove cut in half. 1 oz. cayenne pepper. 2 spoonfuls of India soy. 2 spoonfuls of walnut pickle. To be all mixed in one pint of vinegar. Shake it well and cork it. N.B.—It will be fit for use in a month, and will keep good for years.

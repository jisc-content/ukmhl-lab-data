HOUSEHOLD HINTS App. 292 kind to girls going home and not having many friends to make such arrangements for them, is to mention that the Travelle}^s Aid Society (3, Baker Street, London) are always ready, with four clear days’ notice before arrival, to meet eirls or women at train or steamer and tell them of safe lodgings or otherwise see them on their way. The object of the Society is to guard 5/oung women as they move from place to place, and they have agents in London, South- ampton, and other large towns at home and abroad, and placards at most large stations in England giving names of local helpers. In these days of “running to and fro” the address of their head office is one to keep, and their annual report is a pamphlet of vivid interest; in it will be also found the terms, which vary from \s. to 5^-. for meeting the travellers. Young women going to the Colonies would do well to x consult the United British Womeds Emigration Association, which publishes much interesting information on our differ- ent Colonies, and through whom beneficial arrangements can be made as to passages and advice had as to where to go, etc. The office is at the Imperial Institute, London.

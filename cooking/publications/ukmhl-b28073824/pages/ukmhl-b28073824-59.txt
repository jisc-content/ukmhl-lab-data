The best thing if any one is bitten is to tie a handkerchief tightly above the bitten part, and suck out the poison and apply ammonia, Sal volatile is also given in frequent doses. During the harvest season there were sometimes instances of the labourers being bitten ; perhaps they had put a few sheaves on the ground without noticing a small hole in the ground, and out of that the venomous creature would creep and bite. If discovered at once, and the poison sucked by a friend or snake-doctor, no ill effects were felt. We had an old Hottentot, Moos Julies, who was very good at it; and he had a brother who was believed in as a “snake- doctor,” sucking the poison of every snake he found. He wore a cap which was n^ver washed, and the victims of the snake-bite were allowed to boil it up a7id drink the extract as an antidote ; horrid, is it not}—but he always cured our patients by applying ammonia and giving sulphuric acid in water, and after that brandy and milk.

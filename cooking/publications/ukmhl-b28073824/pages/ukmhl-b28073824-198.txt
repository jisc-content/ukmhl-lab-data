182 Aug. ORANGE JELLY. FAIRY CREAM as oranges are still too acid to be really enjoyable un- cooked, one is very glad to have both these recipes. For orange jelly you want 4 eggs, 6 sheets of white tianspaient gelatine, 2 sheets of red—this combination gives the jelly a lovely colour (but if you cannot* get that, a 6d. packet of gelatine will do)—i small cupful of sifted sugar, the juice of 4 oranges, strained, and the rind of one orange this should be peeled off very thin and put into a jug with boiling water for a few minutes to draw out the flavour before usine.

94 March TO PATTEN CHICKENS. CHEESES (poultry, etc.), add a piece of crumb of bread and a little butter or beef suet will do. This softens the water, keeps the colour, and preserves flavour of joint. Tinned Fruit, etc.—Tinned or bottled fruit should be kept in the dark—a dry cupboard is best for them. If the ends of the tins which contain fruit or meat are bulged out it has fermented, and should not be tcsed on any account. To Fatten Chickens.—Rice boiled with butter-milk and mixed with chopped suet. Of this give them two good meals a day, but nothing else besides; keep them in the dark and only have three or four together. Good Coffee.—I have cut this verse, which embodies the points of good coffee, from a newspaper— “ J’aime le cafe Chaud comme I’enfer, Noir comme le diable, Et doux comme un ange.” Seasons for Cheeses (mem. from Miss Adeane’s MS. book)— Cheddar is said to be best from February to October. Alezcf Roquefort in April. Port Salut, Bondons, Gournay, Neufchatel, Mont Dore, and cream cheese, May to September. Brie, October to April. Camembert, October to May. Stilton, November to June. Gruyere, Roquefort, Parmesan, and Dutch cheeses, all the year round. Grouse.—Grouse are excellent roasted “with bacon iackets on.”

44 ORNAMENTAL CONFECTIONER Y. In the thin cream you may place two or three swans, and should the glass or dish have a broad edge, you may cover it with green sugar, and set on it two or three lambs, which will have a pretty effect. If you had rather that the liquor would represent water, use sherry only. Snowballs. Pare and take out the cores of 7 large baking-apples ; fill up the holes with quince or apricot marmalade, then make some good hot paste and roll it out thin, covering each apple neatly with it; set them on a baking-sheet and bake them in a mo- derate oven. Great care must be taken that they do not crack. As soon as this is done prepare some icing, and when the apples are baked and nearly cold, cover each with the icing in as neat a manner as you can. At the top of the ball you may lay icing in a light fashion to represent snow lately fallen ; set them in a warm stove for half an hour, and then place over them a silver web lightly spun. To make a Trifle. Provide a handsome glass and build in it a pyramid consist- ing of macaroons, ratafias, French savoys, and fruit and sponge biscuits ; pour on every part a small quantity of sherry, until the whole is properly steeped. Great care must be taken not to break any part. Then lay your whipped cream upon the biscuits in as romantic a manner as you canâ€”the more like a rock and the higher it is the better. On the top place a sprig of myrtle, and round the sides ornament it with coloured sugar, green citron, and angelica. If you wish for a richer trifle, cover the pyramid of biscuits with a good custard before you lay on the whipped cream.

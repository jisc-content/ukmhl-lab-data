INTR OD UCTION. 5 Some one may ask very pertinently, “ If we put a model of a building on the top of the cake, will not the leaves of the flowers, &c., be always proportionately too large?” Yes, we say ; if you let the leaves of the flowers cover any part of the model; they must be kept well away; your own eye will tell you that. If we had to make a cake and put a castle on the top, it would not be beyond our capacity to make the cake roughly represent a natural hill, with rocks, woods, waterfalls, &c., about it, so that it should look like a model of a natural object. It might be shaped with a knife first, and then covered with almond paste and sugar-work. By nondescript decoration we mean the extraordinary shapes that some people put on cakes by means of pipes. We may call them dots, or drops, or festoons, or curves, or whatever you like; but what are they? what do they represent? Can any man, looking at them, say that is “ such a thing,” and this is “ such a plant ” ? No, they are utterly meaningless, and therefore senseless. Scrolls and all these things are very good if they are representations of some natural objects—not neces- sarily exactly true in every particular; they may be imitations, and imitations only. Principles of Colour in Confectionery Work. Of the cakes here referred to, wedding and christening cakes have quite distinct associations connected with colour—or rather the want of it—from those of Christmas and birthdays, so that they require different treatment. Let us take the two which are so closely associated with bright and strong colours —Christmas and birthday cakes. How often do we see these over-decorated—a fault common to all low art—and the colours so inharmoniously blended that an artist instinctively turns away from the object as from something painful. The confec- tioner is not to know this unless he is taught; but how can he

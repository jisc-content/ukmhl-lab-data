13 INTR OD UCTION. unusual in a confectioner bordering his cake in that way; but this particular cake had the chain or half circle turned up instead of down. I wondered and tried to think how it could be done, but try as much as I liked I could not see how the soft icing was to keep that half-circle position. Had it been gum paste I could have understood it, but being royal icing I could not. I went three or four times to that shop window to try and master that particular position of the half-circle, but could not manage it, until the very day I was leaving London I went to take a last look, and presto ! the secret was out. Since my last visit one or two of the chains had got broken, and there, neatly put on the cake was a row of small wires made in half-circles and the chains piped neatly over the wires, forming as neat a design and as prettily finished a cake as one could have seen or desired. Another simple and effective method by which chains may be made to stand upright on a cake—where the cake is not too large and the handling of it is practicable—is to turn your cake upside down on the icing stand and pipe chains to your fancy round the cake; let the cake stand inverted until the chains are thoroughly dry, then turn the cake into its upright position, and proceed to pipe and ornament.

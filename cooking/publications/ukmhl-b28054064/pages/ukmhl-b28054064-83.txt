Plate IV. The wreaths shown in this plate will be found very effective when piped round the side of a cake. Figs. 15 and 16 are scroll wreaths, and by an ingenious piper any number of these wreaths can be easily conceived— only let him bear in mind that his designs in scroll must harmonize and be in accord with other ornamentation piped on his cake. Scroll designs can often be picked up in very unlikely places — sometimes, for instance, on painters’ sign-boards, on fancy advertising bills, and in illustrated books and journals. Beau- tiful designs are sometimes seen also on window screens, tapestry, and woven goods of all kinds ; but the man who can conceive his own designs, and has originality, is the true master of his profession, in confectionery as elsewhere. Fig. 17.—This angel wreath in this design is a pretty design for the side of a cake, but is very seldom seen. A paper bag is best to use for this wreath, as you can cut the bag to the required size. The figure of the angel should be worked out by two squeezes from the bag—first from the head to the waist, then from the waist to the foot, then the under leg and foot; then add the arms with flower in hand; then the hair, wings, and flowing drapery, and finish with a wreath of roses and rose-leaves. There is plenty of work in this wreath to call forth the ingenuity of a good amateur, or even of a so- called “ professor.” Fig. 18.—The convolvulus wreath here shown requires con- siderable skill and practice; but with perseverance a pupil who has any intuition can soon master it.

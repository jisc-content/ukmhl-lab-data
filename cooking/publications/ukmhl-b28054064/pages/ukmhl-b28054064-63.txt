47 A CHANTILLY BASNET. it to another part of the blancmange to make a light stone colour; the third part must remain white; then wet your temple mould and fix it firm and straight in salt, fill the top of the temple with red blancmange, and the four points with white; fill up the mould with stone colour and let it stand till next day. Before you turn it out run a small-pointed pen- knife round the inside and shake it loose very gently; do not on any account dip the mould into warm water, as that will take off the gloss and injure the colour; when turned out place a sprig of myrtle in each point, which will not only strengthen it but will improve its appearance. Garnish the dish with jumballs, apple paste, and rock candies. To make a Chantilly Basket. Prepare small ratafias well dried; boil a small quantity of clarified sugar to the degree called caramelled,* and the moment it is ready put the bottom of the pan in cold water to prevent the sugar from discolouring; then dip one side of a ratafia a little in the sugar and fix it on your dish, and so on until you go round one height. The ratafias must be quite close and upright. Continue to do the same until you have built four or five heights agreeable to your fancy. Be careful you do not grain the sugar, which will prevent the ratafias fix- ing to each other. You may, if you please, fix a handle over the basket by using a small shred of tin until the sugar is set. N.B.â€”You may grain the sugar by stirring it too much in the pan when it is boiling, or after it is boiled. Grained sugar always turns white, and will fix nothing. A teaspoonful of lemon juice put to it when it first boils is of great use to pre- vent it graining. * See Bread and Biscuit Baker's and Sugar Boiler's Assistant. Lon- don: Crosby Lockwood & Son.

The shortest and best way is to strike the mould with a mallet, and the figure will come out directly; but in this case the moulds must be bound with iron, or the strokes of the mallet (which must be struck on the same side as the figure) will split the board.

It is not so difficult to learn the art of modelling as may be supposed. Accustom yourself to handle the paste, and how-

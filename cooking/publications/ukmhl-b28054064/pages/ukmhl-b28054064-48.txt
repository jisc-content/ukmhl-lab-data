ORNAMENTAL CONFECTIONER Y. 32 Plaster Moulds. Take the vase or figure you intend to mould, whether in wood or any other composition, and according to its form prepare to make your mould in two or four parts or divisions. With a view to its delivering well, put round each of these divisions a fillet or wall of pipeclay, to retain the liquid plaster and prevent it from running over. Run some plaster in it about 2 inches thick, and when it is set (which you will know by its being hot) take that piece or division off, repair it neatly, and with a knife cut notches in the edges, that the parts may fit closely when joined. Oil it with a hair pencil, and put it again on the object with pipeclay. Repeat the operation with another division, and you will have then one half of your mould formed in two pieces. Repair and cut notches in the fresh quarter, that the parts may fit each other and be firm. Make the other two divisions in the manner already described, and you will then have the whole of your mould in four pieces. These you must dry in the stove, and when dry you may harden them by rubbing on some linseed oil, dry afterwards again in the oven, and oil and dry several times as before.

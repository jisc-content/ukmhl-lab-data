i8 ORNAMENTAL CONFECTIONERY. Carmine. Carmine No. i isâ€™the best, though the dearest, as the inferior article is generally adulterated with cinnabar; but you may easily manufacture carmine, as follows: Take a boiler suffi- ciently large to contain 2\ pailfuls of river water, perfectly clear, put it on the fire, and when it boils shake in gently i lb. of cochineal ground in a new coffee-mill, stir it with a clean hair pencil, and if the heat be too great lessen your fire and throw in a glass of cold water, that the cochineal may not boil over; let it boil for half-an-hour, and then add an alkaline lye, prepared as follows : Boil f oz. of pulverised soda in 2 quarts of water for eight or ten minutes, take it off, filter it, put it into your cochineal and let it boil up five or six times; take off the boiler, place it in a slanting position that the cochineal may deposit, and add to it f oz. of powdered alum; stir it well to dissolve the alum, and let it stand for twenty-five minutes. See if it takes a fine scarlet colour. Pour off the liquor very gently into another clean boiler, and do not stir it much so as to avoid dividing the deposit. Beat up the whites of 2 eggs in a pint of water, and pour the mixture into the colour. Stir it well, put the boiler on the fire till it nearly boils, when the whites of the eggs will coagulate and precipitate with the colouring particles which are to form the carmine. Take the boiler off and let the carmine settle for twenty-five minutes, then pour off the liquid till you see the carmine at the bottom; it will be like thick milk. Pour it into an earthen pan or bowl, strain it through a fine cloth to let the moisture run from it, and drain the carmine. You must strain the liquid several times until it is quite clear. When the carmine is drained, and has a proper consistence, take it up with a silver spoon, lay it on plates to dry in the stove, and when dry grind it on the stone.

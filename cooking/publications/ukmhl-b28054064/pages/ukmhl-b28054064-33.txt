II. COLOURS FOR CONFECTIONERY. Before proceeding to the subjects of icing and gum paste work, I will give here the mode of preparing colours for con- fectionery, as suggested by W. A. Jarrin. The colours used in ornamental confectionery (it may be mentioned) are generally harmless; and in point of fact no one thinks of eating an ornament or figure, yet such colours as vermilion, verdigris, yellow ochre, and others which are poison- ous, should be avoided wherever possible. Cochineal. In choosing cochineal you should see that it be large, clean, and dry, of a silvery shining colour, and when bruised of a dark red. To prepare it, take i oz. of cochineal, and pound it well. Make a soft lye with wood-ashes boiled in water, clearing it off through a flannel bag; take i pint of it, let it boil up, and put in your cochineal. (If you cannot obtain wood- ashes, you can substitute 2 ozs. of wormwood salts dissolved in 1 pint of water.) Pound % oz. of alum and \ oz. of cream of tartar, and add them to the cochineal, and reduce it by boiling till it becomes of a very dark fine red. If it is for keeping add pulverised sugar. You may use this colour in everything, particularly in gum paste, compotes, preserves, jellies, ices, &c. c

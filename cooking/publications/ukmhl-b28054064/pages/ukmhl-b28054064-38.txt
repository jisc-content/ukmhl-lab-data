Take some pure icing sugar and sift it through a lawn sieve ; then take any number of whites of eggs and put them into a large pan or basin; mix the sugar pretty stiff, and add one tablespoonful of soft gum-dragon prepared for the purpose; beat all together with a spatter, adding a little lemon juice at intervals, or add a pinch of tartaric acid, which will assist the colour; keep beating it up until very light (this you may know by its rising to more than double the quantity, which is a cer- tain criterion). If you want icing for cakes, you must test the stiffness of it by taking a little up with a scraper and dropping it on a tin plate; if it keeps its shape it is proper to lay on cakes, but if it runs it must be made stiffen N.B.â€”Gum-dragon proper for icing must be put in water two days at least before wanted, and must be nearly as thin as white of egg; when wanted for use it should be strained through a clean cloth. Icing for Common Goods. Instead of whites of eggs, you may use % oz. of French glue to i pint of boiling water, when icing is required for common goods only.

53 WORK IN BUTTER. A Butter Pat as a Lamb or Bird. Model neatly as many as you want, and let them lie in water until perfectly stiff; then take one out at a time on to a small dish or plate, force butter through a very fine sieve, cover the body neatly with it, and make a bushy tail, and so on until you have got the number you wish for. In like manner figures of other animals or birds must be modelled in their respective shapes, and laid in water until stiff. To ornament Hams. Cut and pare a boiled ham neatly, particularly at the shank ; model the devices for it, and put the ham into cold spring water until the butter is properly stiff; then take the ham out and lay it on a board, smooth and finish your work. The devices may be set on each side, or in the front of the ham. You may then place round the ham single and double loops in butter forced through a squirt, or you may place any ornament you please on the topâ€”such as flowers or the crest and arms of the family for whom the work is intended.

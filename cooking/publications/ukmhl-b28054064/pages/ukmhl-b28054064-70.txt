(54) VIII. ORNAMENTAL WAX WORK. Wax for Modelling. Put into a new pipkin 6 ozs. of resin, i lb. of beeswax, 2 ozs. of lard, and 4 ozs. of flour. Colour it with vermilion and stir the whole on a gentle fire; and when melted and well mixed, pour it into a paper case to use for modelling figures, &c. To make a Wax Basket. Take \ lb. of the best white wax and a small mould candle. Scrap them fine into a pipkin, and set it on a warm part of the stove or on a very slow fire to melt; run the melted wax in a regular manner into your basket mould, which must have been previously oiled with a little sweet oil; when cold, turn out carefully. If the basket is to be upon a bottom stand, run the wax in the same way into the mould for the stand, and when both are turned out fix them together with hot wax. Paint them as your fancy directs.

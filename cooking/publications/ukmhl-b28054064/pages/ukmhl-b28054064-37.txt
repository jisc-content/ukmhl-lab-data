21 COLOURS FIT TO EAT. Bol Ammoniac. This is of a reddish colour, something like cinnamon, and is used for gilding or to paint gum paste, as well as brown umber and bistre. The colours above mentioned are those used to paint gum paste. They are ground on a marble slab, and are moistened with water and a little gum-arabic dissolved and strained through a cloth, with a pinch of fine powdered sugar or sugar- candy. The gum is to fix the colour, and the sugar to make it shine. If you have no gum, you may use isinglass; but then the colour must be warm. Colours Fit to Eat are cochineal, carmine (diluted), saffron, spinach green, Prus- sian blue, and colours made with chocolate and caramel. Caramel should be diluted with a little water, as it goes fur- ther than the dry powder. Yet in some cases it must be used dry, as with royal icing, and in articles for the small oven. Saffron must be infused in hot water, consequently you must put the necessary quantity to your sugar a moment before it is done. It will require a few minutes more boiling, as the saffron will lessen the degrees of heat. Spinach green is used to colour opaque bodies. Such as are transparent must be coloured with a little Prussian blue, mixed with yellow. If blue alone be wanted, it must be ground with a little water, taking care to use but a small quantity of it. Browns may be made of chocolate, a strong decoction of coffee, or caramel burnt and dissolved in water. Violet colour is made with red and blue : orange with saffron and red; and green with yellow and blue.

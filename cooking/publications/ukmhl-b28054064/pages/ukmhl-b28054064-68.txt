52 ORNA ME NT A L CONFECTIONER Y. you make the birds a pale yellow, to represent a canary, or black for a blackbird, or brown for a robin, with a red breast. Any of these will make a very handsome device. To ornament a Tongue as a Bridge. Boil a large tongue, bend it with a bow, like an arch, and when cold pare it neatly, and cut the tip end off to make it stand ; then form scrolls on the sides with butter forced through a squirt, and place butter on the thick parts of the sides to form the stone-work; on the top part of the sides fix lengths of butter. Put through a wide butter-squirt at a proper distance to represent posts, and from these fix lengths of butter put through a finer squirt for the railing; you may also (if you please) put butter round a piece of wire for lamp-posts, and on the top place the figure of a lamp ; then model six or seven geese, put a bit of small whisk in each neck and one through the body; set each upon two pieces of whisk which will form the legs ; put them all in a flying attitude and nearly all together; then model a fox, and set it in a galloping attitude in pursuit of its prey. For variety on another tongue you may place a Reynard, tunning up a bridge ornamented as above with a goose on its aack, holding the neck in its mouth-. Butter Pats. Wood moulds are generally to be procured, which open in the middle and are fixed with pegs. The moulds must be wet when the butter is forced in, and when opened the pat must be let out into the water. Moulds of this sort are made for lambs, swans, and a variety of birds; but the work is much more effective when modelled.

(62) Plate VII. Figs* 35, 36, 37, 38.â€”Four different styles of bunches of grapes, used to ornament; cakes, are shown here. To make a bunch of grapes on a cake, take the leaf tube and throw a leaf on your cake, making it thin at one end and a little thicker at the other. Then take either No. 2 or 3 tube and dot your leaf all over to represent grapes, and finish it off by giving it a leaf or two with a stalk. For good and effective work a good deal depends on the ingenuity of the operator.

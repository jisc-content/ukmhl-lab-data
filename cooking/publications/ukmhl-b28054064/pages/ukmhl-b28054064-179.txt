(91) Plate XXXVI. Fig. 118.—Dressed ox tongue. This dish offers the pastrycook a nice opportunity for dis- play of taste. Fig. 119.—Hedge-hog cake. This form of cake is not so popular as it used to be, but is an attractive cake for window show. Bake in a sponge mould of the shape of a hedge-hog, and after baking stick large strips of blanched almonds to represent the hedge-hog’s quills or prickles. Two currants will serve for the eyes. Fig. 120.—Marble cake in section (page 40). Figs. 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127—Iced and piped fancy biscuits. In fancy biscuits such as are shown here the young beginner has a chance to exercise his skill and ingenuity without spoil- ing much material, for any reasonable design will do for the top of a biscuit, and the confectioner can supply himself with tubes of various designs, to throw ornaments at once on to the biscuit.

20 ORNAMENTAL CONFECTIONER Y. Saffron. This should be chosen very dry and soft, in long shreds of a fine red colour, and of a pleasant balsamic taste. When required for use, it must be infused in warm water. It is a good stomachic. Sap Green. This is prepared from the fruit of the buckthorn. It is in a hard paste, and must be dissolved in water for use to paint gum paste. It is not good to eat in large quantities. Spinach Green. Take the necessary quantity of spinach, pound it well, and squeeze the juice through a cloth; put it in a pan on a strong fire, stir it with a spoon, and as soon as you see it look curdy take it off the fire and strain the liquor through a silk sieve. What remains on the sieve will be the colouring matter. Ivory Black. This is made with ivory cut in small pieces, and calcined in the fire in a covered pot or crucible till it ceases smoking. It is only used to paint gum paste. Prussian Blue. Prussian blue is to be prepared by the confectioner, though it must be used sparingly. The turnsole and indigo afford a bad colour. Vermilion and Cinnabar. These are two different shades of a lively red colour; they are equally dangerous, and should never be used in confec- tionery unless absolutely indispensable.

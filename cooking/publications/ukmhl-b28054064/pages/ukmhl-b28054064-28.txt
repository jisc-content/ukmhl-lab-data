12 ORNAMENTAL CONFECTIONERY. proud to say that some of these young ladies can handle the piping tubes as smartly as some of their sempstress sisters can handle a needle. No mystery there; no locking of doors there. In some of our leading factories it is really surprising to see how rapidly an iced cake is got out—sometimes thou- sands of cakes in one day, and it is interesting for an outsider to watch the different processes a cake has to go through till the finish is reached. First there is the creaming, then the baking; then the cake has to be stripped, topped, and orna- mented on the top ; and after drying, plain iced, bordered, and finished, taken to the drying-room to dry, then papered, and, last of all, packed ready for the market.

A piece of good workman- ship can be displayed with a horse-shoe tube, especially if the tube is in the hands of an experienced person. Some twenty years ago, when in London on a short visit, I was taking a ramble in the East End, and (as our craft is very apt to do) was criticising in my own mind any work of art seen in the bakers’ and confectioners’ windows.

The chain generally hangs down in a half circle, and at that time there was nothing

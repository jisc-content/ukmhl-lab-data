(82) Plate XXVII. pig. 99.—Cake in gum paste with fountain. In decorating this cake, roll out a piece of gum paste square ; cut it into long lengths, twist them, and lay them on a smooth board ; bend them towards one end, and so on, until you have a good number in the same way. Then turn a piece of paste —about three inches long—upon a round ruler; next morn- ing set it up in the middle of the top of the cake ; fix it with soft gum paste, and as many gum-paste leaves as will go round it in different heights so as to represent a fountain. This de- vice makes a beautiful middle piece for a small table, or an end or corner piece for a large one.

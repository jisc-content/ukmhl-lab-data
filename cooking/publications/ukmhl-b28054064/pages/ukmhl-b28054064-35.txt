19 PREPARING COLOURS. Vegetable Carmine. Take 2 lbs. of Brazil-wood, 2 ozs. of cochineal, 2 ozs. rock alum, 2 ozs. sal-ammoniac, 8 ozs. spirit of salt, 1 lb. of nitric acid, 8 ozs. of pewter filings, and 2 ozs. of cream of tartar. Divide the alum into four parts, and boil the Brazil-wood in 8 pints of water with the pulverised cochineal tied in a piece of cloth; when reduced to half, take it from the fire, put into it one of your parcels of alum, strain the decoction through a cloth into a pan, and put back the chips on the fire with the same quantity of water; reduce it as at first, strain it off, and repeat the process four times ; put in one part of the alum each time. At the last boiling add 2 ozs. of sal-ammoniac, and put the whole together into a pan, keeping it warm; put your nitric acid into a long-necked bottle with the 8 ozs. of spirit of salt; place it in a pan full of water, fix it so as not to move, warm the water more than lukewarm, and put in your pewter filings by small quantities, and continue this gradually as you see it dissolve. When the whole is dissolved pour it into the decoction, mix it well, strain it through a cloth, and let it stand for twenty-four hours; then pour off the yellow water till you come to the colour. Fill up your pan with clean water, and repeat this morning and evening for eight days, when you will find the water quite clear, leaving no salt or acid in the colour. Keep it in a pot for use, always having some clean water on it to preserve it in a liquid state. Gamboge. This is a gum, and must be dissolved in cold or lukewarm water. If used to colour gum paste in large quantities, it would act as an emetic and cathartic.

INTRODUCTION. 9 have been transferred to pastrycooks and cooks, who have disfigured, if not destroyed, the most beautiful part of the work of the confectioner. For good work in gum paste, great care and dexterity, much patience, some knowledge of mythology and history, and of the arts of modelling and design, are requisite—qualifications which are seldom possessed by the mere pastrycook. W. A. Jarrin, the Italian confectioner, tells us in his valuable book, that at a dinner given by the city of Paris to Napoleon I., the Emperor of the French, on his triumphant return from Germany, he con- structed a group two feet in height. The Emperor—whose figure in the composition bore a striking resemblance to the great original—was represented standing, in the act of sheath- ing his sword, and as led by Victory, who was attended by several allegorical figures representing the various high qualities so liberally attributed by the French to Napoleon, so long as success attended him. This group was made for the centre of the table, and the Emperor, who rarely noticed anything which ornamented the table, observed his portrait, and with his characteristic attentiveness to works of ingenuity, was pleased to encourage the artist by expressing his approbation. Icing and Piping. I am more than surprised that practical confectioners and others who have been in a position to give good advice on the art of icing and piping, in royal icing, have said or published so little on the subject. It cannot be from want of knowledge, and the reason for their silence is not easily understood. I am sure there is a splendid field open for them in this branch of our business. Neither W. A. Jarrin (whom I consider the father of confectionery) nor Charles Elme Francatelli, nor Gunter (in the Modern Confectioner), does more than touch upon it, and I hope I shall not be considered too presumptuous

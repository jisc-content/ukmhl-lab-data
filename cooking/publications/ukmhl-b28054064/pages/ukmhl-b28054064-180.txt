(92) Plate XXXVII. Fig. 128.—Scotch shortbread, in round shape, with “The Compliments of the Season ” piped on and leaves for edging. Fig. 129.—Scotch shortbread, in square shape, with “A Merry Christmas ” piped in and a twisted edging. Scotch shortbread is now mostly squared off and pressed into blocks to represent the nipping round the edges. This is certainly a quicker mode than nipping with the fingers, but I question if it is more artistic, as I have known workmen who could nip in three or four different styles, and we have yet to see the block that can produce work equal to it. The piping shown in the illustrations is, perhaps, not very artistic, but I have given here what is commonly offered for sale. I have seen, however, devices displayed on cakes of shortbread that were real works of art. The operator has plenty of room for the display of talent in this class of goods, and he may construct and vary his devices as his fancy dictates. The following are amongst the most popular of the mottoes commonly shown on shortbread :— A New Year’s Greeting. For Auld Lang Syne. A Happy New Year. Land of Cakes. Wishing You Many Happy Returns. Scotland Yet. May God Prosper the Shamrock, Rose, and Thistle. Be Just and Fear Not. But in fact there is no limit to the mottoes which may be used, and the operator may select or adopt whatever he thinks is most likely to please the popular fancy, providing he keeps each motto in harmony and does not overcrowd the cake.

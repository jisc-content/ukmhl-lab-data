50 ORNAMENTAL CONFECTIONER Y. proceed to fill them with prepared meat, then lid them ; after which you start to ornament them, cutting out different devices to place round the sides with a rose in the centre, which you can make by cutting out small round pieces of paste and gathering them one at a time in your hand to form a rose. This requires practice; or roll out a piece of dough very thin, say 3 inches square, and fold it up into a round ball, with the folded ends in your hand, and cut it across each way, and then shape it in the form of a rose. Egg your pies, top and sides, place greased paper round each, fastening the end of the paper with a pin, or you can bake them in pie rims or hoops. Have previously made some rich gravy from the bones left after cut- ting your pie meat, adding a little gelatine, with sufficient water, to stew well together in the oven ; season to your taste, and when your pies are nearly cold break a hole in the lid, and fill with the gravy. Ices in Fruit Moulds. These moulds, which may be procured of almost any shape suitable for ices, are made of pewter, and are fastened by a hinge. If you desire to represent a fruit, mould your ice accord- ingly, having first given it the proper flavour. Clean your mould, fill it with the ice and insert in the small hole at the end a stem or a couple of leaves of the fruit represented, or artificial leaves will do. Close the mould, the stem and leaves being outside, and cover it with paper; then bury it amongst the ice and salt in the tub, taking care that the ice covers it. It will be ready in about an hour and a half. If you are imitating a stone fruit the natural stone may be cleaned and inserted in the ice mould. A tin box with shelves, open in the front, and sufficiently small to fit in the ice, will be found useful for keeping moulded ice fruit in.

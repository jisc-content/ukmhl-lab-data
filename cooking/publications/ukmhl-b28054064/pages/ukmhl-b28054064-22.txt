6 ORNAMENTAL CONFECTIONER Y. learn ? Why, let him go to a picture-gallery, and, taking a pic- ture by a good artist, note on a piece of paper the colours of the same, their varied proportions, and the relative degree of brightness of each colour. Let him watch the setting sun, and see the tints of the sky : here is harmony of colour in Nature’s own book; see how while one colour fades another has changed at the same time, and so on. The three colours from which all others come are yellow, red, and blue. Each of them has its appropriate opposite contrasted—or, as artists call them, complementary colours— which are known as secondary. The opposite of yellow is purple; of red, green ; of blue, orange. Whenever you see a picture with any one of these colours in, you are sure to find its opposite. The orange corn-field has its blue sky; the green wood its red cottage; the yellow fields their purple mists. It is on this basis that confectioners should work, and if they follow these fundamental lines they cannot get wrong. White and black are not called colours by artists, so that when you make .your cake with white sugar you are like the painter who copies the snow-covered ground. Red, green, and blue go well with this ; if the marking-be yellow, then purple, and blue, and red, and so on. Self-training in these days in the elements of knowledge of a general character is now comparatively simple and easy; it is really within the certain scope of all; and we are perfectly sure that he who follows his vocation in the enlightened spirit of one really desiring to equip his mind properly for each task before him, is the man who is bound in the issue to attain to eminence in his craft—be that what it may; and for him, indeed, the prize of supreme success is not only possible, but probable.

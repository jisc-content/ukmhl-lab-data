The time necessary for drying varies very much according to the goodness of the oil, the season, and the heat of the room; sometimes six hours are sufficient, but at times twelve hours are required. Mould Making. The art of moulding and counter-moulding is one of con- siderable utility, as by means of it we obtain with ease from casts of figures already made, moulds which it would have been very difficult and expensive to engrave. By the practice of this art, however, we have only to procure a good cast of an object we approve, and from this we are enabled to form our own mould at a very trifling expense. You must proceed as follows :â€”Almost all the small figures, or animals made in France or Germany being executed in common paste, they are consequently liable to take damp. Put the figures you wish to mould into a pasteboard or deal box, between two towels or other linen; place them in a cellar for eight days, or if made of very common paste even three days will be sufficient. They may then be easily parted in two with the blade of a knife, and then moulded. These figures are generally put together with light paste, moistened with water, but whatever the cement may be that part of the figure where it is joined is the weakest, consequently by putting them on a warm stove or in an oven, the great dryness which takes place will open your figures in two parts. If they are made of fine sugar, you must have two figures alike, placing the back of one to the face of the other on wet linen. You can easily fit them together afterwards. Place them on a marble to receive the composition, and if your mould is in plaster, you must put some prepared linseed oil on it, that the sugar may not melt.

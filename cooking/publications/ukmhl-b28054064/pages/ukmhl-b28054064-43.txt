ANIMALS IN PASTE. 27 top, and ends ; or if you wish to raise the cake you may model a family crest, or any other device you please. Modelling Flowers in Fine Gum Paste. Divide your paste into the principal colours—as white, red, blue, and yellow—and with these colours make the compounds green, violet, dark and pale orange, employing the colour nearest to that of the flower you intend to represent; for ex- ample, in modelling a rose you must have for the calyx of the flower (for which you will have wooden mould) you will re- quire paste coloured green ; the heart you must model in yellow paste, fixing it by a wire to the calyx, and with a little saffron cut fine and moistened with gum arabic you can imi- tate the seed. Roll out your red paste very fine, and with a tin cutter cut out the leaves; take them singly, and with a model- ling tool roll them in your hand as thin as nature; then take up the leaves and fix them one by one round the heart. When you have fixed a sufficient quantity of leaves, push * the calyx in the mould and finish the whole, so as to imitate nature in the best possible manner. Small Animals in Fine Paste are commonly made with the double moulds, giving the back and front representations of the objects, which are afterwards to be joined together; you must push the whole quantity of fronts you would have, and place them in order on boards or very smooth plates, that they may dry perfectly straight, taking care when you push them to put pieces of fine wire in the legs, &c., as they are apt to break. The next day you push the backs, which you must loosen gently in the moulds. Put the dry fronts to the backs, touching the fronts with some liquid paste inside, that the two parts may stick each to the other, * Everything made in a hollow mould is said to be pushed.

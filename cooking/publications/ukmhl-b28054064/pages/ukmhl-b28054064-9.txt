PREFACE. The gratifying success which has been attained by my two previous works—“The Bread and Biscuit Baker’s and Sugar Boiler’s Assistant,” and “The Pastrycook and Confectioner’s Guide ”—has encouraged me to issue this further manual for the use of those members of our craft who desire to devote themselves to the higher branches of Con- fectionery work—of which, however (I need hardly say), it does not profess to treat exhaustively. I trust that the work will also be found useful in private families where the ladies of the house, or their cooks, aim at embellishing the table with examples of artistic work. As in the case of my other books mentioned above, I am proud to be able to add that everything given in the following pages is the outcome or suggestion of my own practical expe- rience, so that nothing appears in this book, whether in the way of instruction in the text or of illustration in the plates, which has not been verified in actual work, or found accep- table to my patrons in business.

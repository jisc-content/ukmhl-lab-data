Take 2 ozs. of butter, 4 ozs. of lump sugar, and 1 lb. of flour; boil the sugar and butter in a small cup full of beer; when cold beat up 3 eggs and put them to the other ingre- dients ; mix the whole with the flour into a stiff paste, roll it out thin, and cover a crocanth with it, having previously oiled the mould. You may then take red chalk and draw out a basket of flowers or any other device ; after you have sketched out your design, take a small pointed penknife, and cut out such parts as have not to appear ; you may then bake it in a very slow oven, and when cold take it carefully off the mould and cover it over with cream, or stewed pears, or other fruit. N.B.â€”You may build pyramids or castles with this paste, which was formerly very much in use before the modern de- velopments of confectionery. A Floating Island. Mix 1 pint of cream with ^ pint of sherry, a little lemon- juice and sugar, with or without a tablespoonful of orange- flower water ; put this into a handsome glass bowl for a middle or corner dish; on this liquid place a strong froth, whipped the night before with a little raspberry jam ; then whisk up the whites of 5 eggs and sweeten \ lb. of the pulp of apples, dam- son, or wine sour, and put it to them; beat the pulp with them until it will stand high ; lay it upon the cream, making it as romantic as possible. You may use strings of angelica, and run them round the parts that project. Green sugar may also be introduced with effect, as well as a few fine gum paste shells or dragees.

4 ORNAMENTAL CONFECTIONERY. and bring flowers whose habits and surroundings we are un- acquainted with. Then notice, also, how we not only use foreign flowers, but we make creepers of plants that never creep; we stick a vase on the top of a cake, and make a drooping spray of two or three different plants, not one of which is a creeper. If a painter were to paint a pig flying, he would be smothered with ridicule, and equally ridiculous is the common practice in decoration of cakes with flowers. Now why should not some- body try natural colours for flowers? Let him take the violet, the primrose, the wild rose, the daisy, the wild crab-blossom, the cowslip, and all the flowers our British poets sing about, and ornament his cake with these. The primrose being a symbol used by a political party, surely for Conservative fes- tivities at least it might be introduced. The rose, thistle, and shamrock might also, for special occasions, be used. The blue- bell or wild hyacinth, the cuckoo pint, the water-lily, and hoc genus omne, should all be laid under contribution. The creep- ing convolvulus might be splendidly utilised. Instead of the customary wreath on a wedding cake, when a brewerâ€™s daughter, or a brewer himself, is to be married, take the hop and let it creep round the cake; apart from its appro- priate associations in such a case, the hop itself is a charming plant. What I am venturing to urge on my brethren in the craft is to throw away the silver leaves of plants which never existed, and replace them with those that grow in our own land, gardens, or in our own hedgerows. Every leaf or flower that is foreign I would have discarded on a wedding cake, and the best of those of British growth Substituted. Have nothing unnatural among the decorations. I do not urge natural flowers, and those only; but I do urge that the artificial flowers should be made as near as possible to the natural.

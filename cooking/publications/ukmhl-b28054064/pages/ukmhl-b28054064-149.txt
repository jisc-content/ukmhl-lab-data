(80 Plate XXVI. Fig. 98.â€”Bride cake ornamented in gum-paste. The gum paste must be made according to the directions given (p. 24), and must be tough with gum, and worked up to a proper stiffness with starch powder. Before you use the moulds they must be dusted with starch powder tied up in a piece of cloth. The paste should be rolled out on a marble slab, put tight down into the moulds, and cut off with a smooth sharp knife. Take out as many borders as will go round the bottom of the cake, and lay them on a straight board; if they do not come out very readily, put a bit of gum paste to them in different parts ; give it a touch, jerk it, and the border, &c., will come out immediately ; then touch the first border with a camel-hair pencil dipped in thin gum water, place it neatly on the bottom of the cake, and so on until it is ornamented round. Be careful to make the joinings so as not to be observed. Then take out more borders of a different pattern* for the top ; and afterwards take out trophies for the sides, top, and ends. G

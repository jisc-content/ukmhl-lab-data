ORNAMENTAL CONFECTIONERY. 40 mix in the 12 yolks with 12 ozs. of castor sugar and the rasp- ings of 2 lemons ; whisk this over a slow fire, or on the top of hot water, till you see it come quite thick and light; then take it off the fire or hot water, and whisk it till it is quite cold ; then stir in lightly 4 ozs. of flour and 6 ozs. of rice flour. Bake in nicely papered hoops, and slightly dust with sugar on the top; bake on double sheet tins in a moderate oven. Marble Cake. Take the quantity you want of the same mixture as for Savoy biscuits,* and divide it into four portions ; dissolve an ounce of chocolate, and add it to two of the portions, in unequal quantities, so that one may be dark and the other light; for the other two portions take vegetable carmine and mix it with a little saffron to make an orange colour; give one of the por- tions a pale and the other a deep orange colour; make a paper case and put in the mixtures with a spoon to intermix the colours, so that when baked the cake may cut out like variegated marble, or the portions may be subdivided and laid in veins like strata of rock : put in a slack oven that the cake may be two or three hours in baking, and when cool cut it in pieces to represent the marble or rock you want. * See Bread and Biscuit Baker s and Sugar Boiler's Assistant.

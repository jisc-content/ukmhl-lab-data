But such instructions as I think may be useful I shall feel pleasure in trying to make as clear as possible.

This mode of decoration and embellishment was once in great vogue, and the most magnificent and costly ornaments have been made of gum paste, but it has fallen comparatively into disuse, and (what is worse for the confectioner) the fragments of the art

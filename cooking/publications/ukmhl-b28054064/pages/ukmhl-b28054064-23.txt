INTRODUCTION. 7 Essentials of Good Work. Of all things necessary to be observed by the worker in con- fectionery, cleanliness is most essential; for although you may attend to the directions to be found in the following pages with the greatest care, yet be assured that if cleanliness is neglected you will ultimately fail.

It is not intended to compete with those excellent cookery books which have been published for use in large establishments or hotels, but is for households where variety must be combined with economy, and, amongst other things, it aims at preventing waste, by using food which might otherwise be useless. 1 claim the indulgence of housekeepers for its many shortcomings and imperfections, and trust that even the most experienced may find some suggestions in this book which may be of advantage. My best thanks are due, and are hereby tendered, to Mrs. A. B. Marshall, of Mortimer Street, VV., for her kind and courteous permission to reproduce some of her recipes, which have frequently proved of great value to myself. M. Jebb Scott.

The syrup, strained off the nuts, is then poured once more over the chestnuts, which are left to soak overnight, this process being repeated four times, while the sugar on the last occasion is boiled a little longer. To glace them, they should be dipped in a fresh syrup made very thick and rich, the chestnuts finally drying on a waxed sheet. DROP SCONES.

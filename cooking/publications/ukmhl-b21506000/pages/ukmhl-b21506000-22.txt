The line between these two dotted lines, is that in the direction of which the edge or ridge of the blade- bone lies, and cannot be cut across. Leg of Mutton.—A leg of wether mutton (which is the best flavoured) may be known by a round lump of fat at the edge of the broadest part. The best part is in the midway, at 0, between the knuckle and farther end. Begin to help here, by cutting thin deep slices to c.

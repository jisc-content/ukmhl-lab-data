Pour in a little gravy or stock mixed with a teaspoonful of “Lemco,” place the fried bacon on top, and cook for five minutes longer. Serve hot. Tossed Calf’s Liver. (Foie de Veau saute.) Cut half a pound of fresh calf’s liver into very thin slices, and proceed to cook it in the same manner as described for “ Kidneys a la Minute,” on page 28. Calf’s Brains with Eggs. (Cervelles de Veau aux CEufs.) Soak in salted water half a calf’s brain, wash it well and remove the veins, then blanch it, drain, and chop it into small pieces. Melt an ounce of butter in a chafing dish, when hot put in four well-beaten eggs, and the chopped brain. Season with salt, pepper (paprika or white pepper). Stir in a table-spoonful of cream and allow the mixture to cook whilst stirring for about five minutes. Serve with fingers of toasted bread. Calf’s Brains with Parsley Sauce, (Cervelles de Veau a la Poulette.) Soak and wash carefully a calf’s brain, removing the veins, then blanch or parboil it in salted water. Drain, and cut it into small pieces. Melt an ounce of butter in a chafing dish, stir in half an ounce of flour, and add half a pint of milk, continue to stir till it boils, season to taste with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Then put in the pieces of brain, boil up, add a teaspoonful of chopped parsley and a few drops of lemon-juice. At this stage the yolks of two eggs may be added, if liked.

Baked Curried Tomatoes. (Tomates au gratin a I’lndienne.) Blanch six to eight tomatoes, remove the skins, and place them in a deep fireproof dish (previously buttered). Mix half a pint of tomato sauce with a dessert-spoon- ful of curry paste and a table-spoonful of red cur- rant jelly ; boil for five minutes. Season the tomatoes, and pour over them the prepared sauce. Sprinkle with grated cheese, Panurette or breadcrumbs, and a little oiled butter. Bake in a hot oven for fifteen minutes. Fry a few slices of streaky bacon, place these on top of the tomatoes, and serve with a small dish of plain boiled rice. Plain Omelet. Beat up four fresh eggs, and season with salt and pepper. Melt in an earthenware omelet pan three-quarters of an ounce of butter ; when hot pour in the beaten eggs, and stir over the fire till they begin to set; then shape into an oval at one end of the pan, folding in the ends ; allow it to set and take colour, and turn out into a hot dish. Kidney Omelet. (Omelette aux Rognons.) Skin two sheep’s kidneys or half a small veal kidney; cut it into thin slices, season to taste, and fry with one ounce of butter blended with a very small chopped shallot; add a little brown sauce and keep hot.

26 Chicken Omelet. (Omelette de Volaille.) Cut some cold boiled or roast chicken, free from bone, skin, and gristle, into small dice, season to taste, and heat up in a little white sauce. Beat up six eggs with one table-spoonful of milk, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Melt three-quarters of an ounce of butter in a chafing dish, pour in the egg mixture, and stir over a quick fire till the eggs begin to set, then put the chicken mixture in the centre. Fold in the sides and shape neatly (oval cushion shape), allow the omelet to take colour, and serve. Mutton Cutlets a la Minute. Mutton or lamb cutlets, cut rather thinly, well flattened, and trimmed neatly, can be cooked in the same manner as directed for Fillets of Beef, see page 24. These may be served with creamed peas, stewed tomatoes or other vegetable garnish. Tripe with Cream Sauce. (Tripe a la Creme.) Wash half a pound of honeycomb tripe, wipe it dry, and cut into very fine shreds. Put half an ounce of butter into the chafing dish, and fry in it a peeled and chopped shallot ; then put in the tripe, season with salt and pepper, and besprinkle with a dessert-spoonful of flour. Cook whilst stirring for about six minutes, then moisten with a gill of hot milk and two or three table-spoonfuls of cream. Allow to simmer, stirring often for half an hour longer. More milk or stock may be added if found neces- sary. A little grated nutmeg is considered an improve- ment by many. Serve hot with croutons of fried bread or puff paste crusts (fleurons). Broiled Calf’s Liver. (Foie de Veau frit.) Wipe a piece of calf’s liver weighing about half a pound, and cut it into slices. Dip each slice into seasoned flour

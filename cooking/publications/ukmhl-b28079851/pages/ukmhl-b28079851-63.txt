59 liver and let it brown gently, pour off the fat, add about half a pint of rich brown sauce and a gill of good stock. Season with pepper and salt, and let simmer gently for about an hour. Then add a glass of sherry or port wine, the juice of half a lemon, and a small quantity of finely- chopped parsley. Boil up, take up the liver, let the liquid reduce, strain and remove the fat. Replace the liver in the casserole and put it on a dish, sauce over carefully, and serve Stewed Beef with Macaroni. (Ragout de Boeuf au Macaroni.) Procure two pounds of rump or buttock steak, cut rather thick, and cut it into two-inch pieces. Peel and slice an onion of medium size. Scrape two carrots and cut them into neat cube shapes. Melt two ounces of butter in a large casserole and fry in it the onion to a pale or amber colour. Then put in the steak and fry to a nice brown over a quick fire. Stir in an ounce of flour and let it get slightly browned. Season with salt and pepper, and half a teaspoonful of ground ginger. Moisten with a pint of good brown stock ; bring it to the boil and skim well. Now put in six ounces of macaroni or spaghetti (a species of very small macaroni) ; these must be previously blanched in salted water, and drained ; put in also the carrots. Cover the casserole and let the whole simmer slowly for about an hour or a little less, till the meat, vegetables, and macaroni are quite tender. Before serving, skim off the fat from the sauce. NOTE.â€”A blade of mace and one or two cloves may be added to the stew, but these must be removed after cooking.

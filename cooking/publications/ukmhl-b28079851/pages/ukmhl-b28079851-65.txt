6i eight preserved mushrooms (champignons), and put them with the stew, then cover and simmer slowly for about forty minutes, stirring occasionally and adding one or two table-spoonfuls of cream when the meat is cooked tender. One or two yolks of eggs beaten up with a little milk or cream may also be added at this stage. Re-heat thoroughly, but do not allow the fricassee to boil again after the eggs are added. Remove the bay-leaf and slices of lemon before serving. Hot-Pot or Hodge-Podge. This is an exceedingly popular luncheon or supper dish for those who appreciate an old-fashioned stew. Either mutton, beef or pork can be used for it, the formula of preparation being the same. Wash, peel, and slice thickly one pound of potatoes, peel and cut into slices a good- sized onion, blanch both potatoes and onion separately. Trim about one and half pounds of neck or loin of mutton, and cut into con- veniently sized pieces, par-fry them in a pan containing an ounce of dripping. Line a hot-pot jar with alternate layers of potatoes, meat, and onion. Season each layer with salt and pepper and a pinch of dried savoury herbs. Moisten with a pint of good stock or water, cover the jar, and place it to cook in a fairly hot oven for about 11 hours. The stew must cook slowly, and the fat must be carefully removed before the dish is sent to table. When ready for serving sprinkle a little chopped parsley on top. KOTE.â€”If liked, a handful of cooked peas or a few mushrooms can be added to the stew about ten minutes before serving it.

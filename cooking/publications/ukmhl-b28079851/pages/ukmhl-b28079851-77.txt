buttered. Place them on a baking sheet and bake for about fifteen minutes in a fairly-hot oven. Dish up, garnish with crisp parsley, and serve. NOTE.—If liked, one or two ounces of fine-chopped ham or tongue can be added to the above mixture before it is baked. This will make the dish more tasty, especially if served as an entree. Carrots a la Maitre d’Hotel. (Garottes a la Maitre d’Hotel.) Wash and scrape one or two bunches of young carrots, ■cut them lengthwise into quarters, and boil in salted water till tender. Drain them and put them in a casserole with 1 oz. of butter ; saute them quickly over the fire ; add a dessert-spoonful of finely-chopped parsley and a tea- spoonful of lemon juice. Shake the pan over the fire for some minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of castor sugar. Just before serving add a teaspoonful of liquified meat glaze or meat extract. Turnips au Gratin. (Navets au Gratin.) Pee! thinly eight or nine medium-sized young turnips, cut them into slices and wash them. Drain them tho- roughly. Melt two ounces of butter in a stew-pan, when hot put in the turnips and stir over a brisk fire, season with pepper and salt, moisten with a little stock, and cook till tender. Rub half through a sieve as puree. Arrange the slices on the puree in a well- buttered gratin or pie dish. Sauce over with a well-reduced bechamel sauce, sprinkle the surface with fine bread- crumbs and grated cheese, adding a few tiny bits of butter here and there.

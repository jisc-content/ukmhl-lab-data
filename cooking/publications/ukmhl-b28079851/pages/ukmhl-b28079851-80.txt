76 Italian Risotto. Wash in cold water half-pound of Patna or Carolina rice, dry it well, and put it in a casserole stew-pan containing two ounces melted butter. Stir this over the fire for a few minutes with half a small finely-minced onion ; the latter must not be allowed to brown. Now add about half a pint of stock and let reduce, then add half a pint of tomato pulp, and more stock. Continue to cook whilst stirring. Season with salt, pepper, and a handful of chopped pimientos. Lastly add about an ounce of grated Parmesan cheese. Nearly all the moisture must become, absorbed by the time the rice is cooked. Eggs en cocotte. Butter six or eight little cocotte pans, put a dessert spoonful of fresh cream into each. Break carefully as many fresh eggs, placing one into each pan containing the cream. Sprinkle over a little salt and pepper to season, then cook in a fairly hot oven for about six minutes by which time the eggs should be sufficiently set. Dish up and send to table hot. Eggs a la Rouennaise. Prepare a puree of ham mixed with a little foie-gras and well seasoned with rich brown sauce.

Pour a little hot white sauce over each* egg and besprinkle with a little finely chopped ham. Dish up and serve hot.

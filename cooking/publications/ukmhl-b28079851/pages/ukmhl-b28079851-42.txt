Orange Omelet. (Omelette Soufflee a I’Orange.) Separate the yolks from three eggs and cream them with an ounce of castor sugar. Add the juice of an orange and the stiffly-whisked whites of three eggs, to which a pinch of salt should be added. Melt three - quarters of an ounce of butter in the chafing-dish blazer ; when hot pour in the egg mixture and allow to cook whilst stir- ring for two or three minutes, then let it take colour and by means of a pallet knife care- fully turn it over so as to brown the other side. Slit the omelet in the centre, and insert two table-spoonfuls of orange compote, that is, slices of orange stewed in syrup, or failing this use orange marmalade. Fold over the omelet carefully, dredge with sugar, and serve. NOTE.—For other omelettes see pages 22 and 26. French Apple Fritters. (Beignets de Pommes.) Peel four large, tart cooking apples, cut them into slices, and remove the core from the centre of each slice. Put the slices on a plate, sprinkle over with castor sugar, a table-spoonful of cream, and a few drops of lemon juice. Drain the apple slices, dip them in white of egg, and then in flour. Heat up four ounces of clarified butter in the chafing dish ; when very hot but not burning, drop in the apples, a few at a time, and fry the slices on both sides to a golden colour. Take them up, drain, and dredge with castor sugar mixed with a little ground cinnamon. BLAZER.

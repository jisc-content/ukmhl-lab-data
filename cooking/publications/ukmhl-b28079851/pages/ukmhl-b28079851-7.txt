PREFACE. —— This Manual is designed to show the culinary })ossil)ilities of a chafing disli, which is looked u])on by many as one of those delightful and practical toys which make cooking a real pleasure. In a like manner it shows the handy use to which earthenware casseroles and marmites can be adopted in cookery. The former is intended chiefly for things that are quickly prepared, whilst the latter, “ casserole cookery,” is more especially adapted for so-called long or slow cooking processes. Cooking by the help of a chafing dish affords great pleasure, and at times amusement, though it has a solid basis of usefulness, for there are some decided advantages to be gained in being able to prepare dainty dishes quickly for either breakfast, luncheon or supper. Many house- wives take a real delight in chafing-dish cookery for ordinary purposes, whilst for sick-room cookery a chafing dish will prove a most valuable - friend, for there are many dishes suitable for invalids which can be prepared with its aid. The number of dishes which can be cooked in a chafing dish or in a casserole is almost endless. The collection of recipes contained in this book have been specially compiled for sucli dishes which are most readily prepared in the chafing dish or in stoneware cooking pans. It is hoped that these meet the long-felt want so often ex- pressed by many of my colleagues and friends, for whose benefit this volume has been pulfiished. C. Herman Senn.

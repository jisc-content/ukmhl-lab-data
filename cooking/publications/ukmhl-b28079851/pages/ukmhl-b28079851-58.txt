54 Spiced Shoulder of Mutton. (Epaule de Mouton epicee.) Bone a small shoulder of mutton, lay out the meat flat on a board, skin downwards, and rub in a mixture of salt, coarse brown sugar, pepper, ground mace, ground ginger, and ground cloves ; use only very little of the latter three ingredients. Roll up the meat, and keep in the larder till next day. Repeat this operation for three or four days, then roll up the meat and tie it with string. Place it in a casserole with enough seasoned stock to cover, and let it simmer slowly for about 21- hours, more or less, according to size. Remove the string, and serve hot or cold ; if served cold it should be brushed over with meat glaze after the meat is cold. Braised Loin of Mutton a la Soubise. (Longe de Mouton braise a la Soubise.) Bone a moderate sized loin of mutton, and remove most of the fat, leaving only a thin layer on top. Place the trimmed fillet in a braising pan on a mirepoix, /.e., a bed of sliced carrot, onion, bacon, and a small bunch of herbs ; put it in a hot oven, and par-roast for about twenty minutes. Then pour off the fat, Â»dd one pint of thin brown sauce and season with salt and pepper, and return to the oven for about an hour ; baste the meat frequently during the process of cooking. Prepare a soubise puree, as directed below ; take up the cooked loin of mutton, cut it into slices (fillets), and dress them neatly in a casserole. Re-heat the brown sauce, strain it, remove the fat or skim carefully, and pour over the slices of meat.

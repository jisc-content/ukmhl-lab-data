37 Scrambled Eggs with Ham. (CEufs brouilles au Jambon.) Proceed the same as directed in the recipe for “ Scram- bled Eggs.” Chop finely, or cut into small dice two ounces of cooked lean ham, fry this in the butter, then pour in the beaten eggs, and stir till sufficiently cooked, that is till the eggs begin to set; serve with toasted bread. NOTE.—Scrambled eggs, when properly cooked, should be moist and very light. If over-cooked they become dry Sardine Eggs. (CEufs aux Sardines.) Proceed as above, but use four to six sardines, skinned, boned, and cut in small pieces, in place of the ham, and serve on toasted bread. Savoury Omelet. (Omelette aux Fines Herbes.) To make an omelet of this description, put the chafing dish over the lamp (lire), melt in it about half an ounce of fresh butter, and fry half a finely chopped shallot to a light golden colour. Have ready two or three eggs well beaten, seasoned and mixed with a table-spoonful of cream and a teaspoonful of chopped parsley. Pour this into the chafing-dish blazer and cook whilst stirring continuously with a fork till the mixture begins to set; then fold in the two ends so as to form a cushion shape ; allow it to take colour ; the omelet is then ready for serving Rum Omelet. (Omelette au Rhum.) Beat up four eggs with a table-spoonful of cream, a tiny pinch of salt, and a teaspoonful of castor sugar. Melt about half an ounce of butter in a chafing dish; when hot pour in the mixture and cook whilst stirring, until it will not run in the pan or till it begins to set, then roll carefully and turn out on a hot dish, sprinkle freely with powdered sugar, pour round the sides half a glass of rum, set it on fire, then with a spoon pour the burning liquid over the omelet as long as it will blaze, then serve.

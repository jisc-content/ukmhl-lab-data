52 Place the ham in an earthenware double pipkin or roasting pan, lined with fat bacon or ham rind, and a few prunes. Pour over sufficient lard or butter to baste, put on the lid, and bake in a slow oven from two to tv/o and half hours, according to size ; baste it frequently and freely. When done take up the ham, remove the fat and the ham rind from the pan, return the ham to the pan and add half a pint of rich gravy or brown sauce and a glass of sherry or Madeira. Continue to cook over the fire for another ten minutes ; it is then ready for serving. Neck of Mutton en Casserole. (Carre de Mouton en Casserole.) Bone a neck of mutton weighing from 3 to 4 lbs., remove the superfluous fat, stuff the boned side with a mixture of breadcrumbs, beaten egg, chopped ham or tongue, and chopped parsley. Tie up the meat into neat shape, and place it in a deep earthenware fireproof pan, which must be previously lined with slices of fat bacon, sliced carrot, turnip, and a small onion ; put the pan on the fire and fry its con- tents'^'over a brisk fire till the meat has acquired a light brown colour. Then moisten with a pint of good and well seasoned stock (the bones from the neck should be utilised for this). Place the cover on the pan, and put it in a fairly hot oven for about one or one and a quarter hours. Baste the meat occasionally with its liquor during the process of cooking ; and lastly, remove the fat which has accumulated on top of the liquor. About ten minutes before serving, take up the meat and place it on a dish and keep hot; add half a pint of brown sauce to the liquor remaining in the pan, boil it up, strain off the vegetables, skim the sauce well, and season to taste ; now return the meat into the pan, cook for another ten minutes, and send to table in the pan in which it was cooked.

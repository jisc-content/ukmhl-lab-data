stirred Eggs. (CEufs Mollet.) Put into the blazer of the chafing dish half an ounce of fresh butter ; when melted drop in four or five eggs, season with salt and pepper, and stir them gently till sufficiently cooked ; serve on or with buttered toast. Poached Eggs. (QEufs poches.) Three parts fill a hot-water dish with boiling water ; season with salt, and add a little lemon juice or vinegar. Carefully break and drop in some new-laid eggs, only three or four can be poached at one time, and the water must be boiling. Cook the eggs till they are set, then take them up and trim them neatly ; serve on hot buttered toast. NOTE.â€”It is advisable to use special egg poachers for this dish, as by their use the eggs will be of better shape when cooked. It is necessary to butter the rings of the poachers before using them. Eggs and Bacon. (CEufs au lard fume.) Cut some streaky or other part of bacon into very thin slices, remove the rind part. Heat the blazer of the chafing dish, place in the bacon, and fry till quite crisp, turning each slice as it gets crisp. Take up the fried bacon and keep hot; add a little butter to the bacon fat, when hot carefully drop in the required number of eggs, and fry them nicely ; trim each egg a little, and place them on top of the bacon ; sprinkle a pinch of salt and a pinch of pepper over each egg, and serve. Tomato Eggs. (CEufs aux Tomates.) Fry in the blazer of a chafing dish half a small finely minced onion in one ounce of butter ; when of a pale brown colour, add three peeled and sliced tomatoes. Cook for five minutes, season with salt and pepper, stir in four well-beaten eggs, slightly seasoned, and a teaspoonful of chopped parsley. Cook them like scrambled eggs, and serve on pieces of toasted and buttered bread.

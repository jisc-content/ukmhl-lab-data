It is best to place the chafing dish on a tray so as to prevent any danger of a flaring flame igniting an unpro- _tected table cloth. The tray, flagon, hot plates, fork, and spoon should be put on the side of the tray. The hot-water pan must be always used where slow cooking is required for creams, sauces, and rarebits. For frying, broiling, remove the hot-water pan and place the pan near to the flame, which is done by raising the lamp on a standard supplied for this purpose. CHAFING DISH FORK AND SPOON. Have the lamp filled with good alcohol, and closely covered until ready to light. Fill the pan one-fourth full of hot water, if handy, otherwise with cold, covering closely until hot. Let the prepared foods be served from the chafing dish on to the hot plates, and never attempt anything in the line of elaborate garnishing. Neither should an elaborate meal be attempted, especially if only one chafing dish is used. It requires at least two chafing dishes, and sometimes three, to carry out a whole meal successfully. Near at hand should be a small table containing the materials for preparing the meal. The flour, salt, pepper, and sugar should be accurately measured. Place small pats of butter or butter-balls on a dish. When whipped cream is used, prepare it beforehand, place it in a deep dish or bowl, and keep in a cool place until wanted. By having the meats seasoned and ready to form into whatever cooked dish is wanted, the cheese grated, eggs wiped clean, and placed near at hand, the work of cooking is simplified.

36 Eggs a la Jardiniere. Drain in a colander or sieve half a pint of vegetable macedoine. Melt one ounce of butter in the chafing dish, and fry in it four to six finely chopped mushrooms, then put in the vegetables, and fry them together for a few minutes. Now moisten with one gill of bechamel or other good white sauce, place on top four hard-boiled eggs, cut into slices, and season to taste with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Shake the dish so as to mix its contents, simmer gently for ten minutes, and serve hot with fingers of toast. Anchovy Eggs. (CEufs brouilles aux Anchois.) Cut the fillets of six anchovies into small dice, mix them with six well-beaten eggs, to which a table-spoonful of cream or milk has been added, and season with pepper, but no salt. Pour this into the chafing dish containing three-quarters of an ounce of melted butter, stir till the eggs commence to set, and serve on pieces of toasted and buttered bread. Scrambled Eggs. (CEufs brouilles.) Break six eggs into a basin and beat up with a fork, season with salt and pepper, and add a table-spoonful of milk or cream. Melt half an ounce of fresh butter in the chafing dish, pour in the eggs, etc., and stir over the spirit flame till the eggs commence to set; serve on hot plates with sippets of toasted bread. Scrambled Eggs with Shrimps. (CEufs brouilles aux Crevettes.) Pick half a pint of fresh, large shrimps, and fry them quickly for a few moments in an ounce of butter, previously melted in the chafing-dish blazer; next pour in five well- beaten and seasoned eggs mixed with a table-spoonful of milk and cream. Stir over the spirit flame till the eggs commence to set, then serve with fingers of toasted bread or celery biscuits.

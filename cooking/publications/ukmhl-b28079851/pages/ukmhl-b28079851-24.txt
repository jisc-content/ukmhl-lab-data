20 Fried Scallops. (Escaloppes frites.) Cut four or five fresh scallops in halves, wipe them and season with salt, pepper, a very little paprika or Krona pepper, then dip them in oiled butter ; drain again, and roll them in finely crushed vermicelli, plain biscuits or coarse breadcrumbs ; heat up two ounces of butter in the chafing dish, when quite hot drop in the prepared scallops, and fry to a golden colour. Take up, drain, dish up, and garnish with slices of lemon and parsley, and serve hot. Soles a la Parisienne. I Skin and fillet two small soles, season with salt, pepper, and lemon juice, and roll up each fillet. Melt half an ounce of butter in the chafing dish, place in the fillets of sole, sprinkle over a small finely minced shallot and a dessert-spoonful of finely chopped parsley ; moisten with half a glass of white wine, Chablis or Sauterne, also two table-spoonfuls of well reduced bechamel sauce ; then cover the dish and cook the fish slowly from 15 to 20 minutes, according to the size of the fillets. Just before serving, add a pat of fresh butter, divided into little bits, and shake the dish so as to dissolve the butter more quickly. Creamed Lobster. (Homard a la Creme.) Pick the meat from the claws and body of a medium- sized boiled lobster, and chop it rather small. Melt one ounce of butter in the chafing dish, stir in one table-spoonful of flour, cook a little without browning, then moisten with half a pint of milk, and boil up whilst stirring ; season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg ; put in the lobster mince, and let simmer whilst stirring for about ten minutes ; now add one teaspoonful of lemon juice and two table-spoonfuls of cream, re-heat, but do not let it boil again ; the dish is then ready, and should be served with thinly cut buttered brown bread.

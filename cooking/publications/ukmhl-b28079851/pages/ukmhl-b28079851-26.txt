22 Salmon Omelet. (Omelette de Saumon.) Free four ounces cooked salmon from skin and bones, and flake it finely, heat it up in a little butter and white sauce, just enough to moisten.

Melt an ounce or more of butter in the chafing dish, add a peeled and finely-chopped shallot, and half an apple, peeled, cored, and chopped. Fry for a few minutes, and then add the crab, and fry for another five minutes.

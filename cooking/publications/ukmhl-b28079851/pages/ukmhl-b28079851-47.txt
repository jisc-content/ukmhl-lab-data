43 Some Advantages of a Casserole. Less heat is, as a rule, required to cook in a casserole. Food in a casserole may be cooked either on the stove or in the oven. Occasional basting is desirable. When the contents of the pan or pot is cooked gently, it is not only more economical, but tough meat will be more tender, and may thus be used with excellent results. A braise or stew cooked in an earthenware stewpan can be served in the casserole, thereby securing its being “piping hot.” A clean serviette is sometimes folded neatly round it, and the dish, called “ en casserole,” is always appreciated. Any dish which requires slow, gentle cooking (simmer- ing, stewing or braising) can be prepared in this way ; thus, a ragout, braise ; as well as rechauffes such as Miriton, mince, and hash, are decidedly better in flavour when re-cooked in earthenware than in metal stewpans. Petite Marmite. This dish, which forms the standard dinner item of the average French household, is best prepared in an earthen- ware marmite stock-pot, for it is an acknowledged fact that a petite marmite cooked in stoneware is far more palatable, and for this reason this mode of cooking is especially recommended. Petite marmite is so typically French that no other equivalent has as yet been found. It is a kind of soup usually served in little earthenware pots, which just hold enough for one person, but in some places it is sent to table in the actual pot in which it is cooked. Recipe.—The following ingredients will make a dish sufficient for eight to ten persons: 2 lbs. of rump or round of beef, 1 small piece of marrow-bone, half an ox-tail, 3 quarts of water, 2 carrots, 1 turnip, 1 leek, half-stick celery, half small cabbage, 1 bay-leaf, 2 cloves, 12 pepper- corns,^and salt.

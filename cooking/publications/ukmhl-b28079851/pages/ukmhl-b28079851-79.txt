75 Macaroni au Gratin. Blanch and cook in salted water half a pound macaroni or spaghetti ; when done, drain them in a colander or sieve, and let cool. The macaroni may, if liked, be cut into short pieces. Heat up an ounce of butter in a stew- pan, put in the cooked macaroni, season with salt and pepper to taste, also a good pinch of Krona or Paprika pepper, and moisten with a gill of good white sauce. Mix carefully, so as not to mash the macaroni, with an ounce of grated cheese. Pile this neatly in a buttered gratin-dish, pour over a little more white sauce if needed, then sprinkle over with grated cheese and breadcrumbs, also a little oiled butter, and bake in a sharp oven for ten minutes. Italian Macaroni Pie. Cut half to three-quarters of a pound of cold beef or mutton into thin slices, peel and slice thinly half an onion, slice likewise three or four firm but ripe tomatoes, and boil quarter-pound of macaroni in slightly salted water till tender. Cool and drain the macaroni and cut it up rather small. Line a buttered baking dish with macaroni and range the meat, onion, and tomato slices in layers on the baking-dish. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, pour over a little sauce or stock, and cover the top with macaroni. Sprinkle over some breadcrumbs and grated cheese, then bake for about thirty minutes in a hot oven.

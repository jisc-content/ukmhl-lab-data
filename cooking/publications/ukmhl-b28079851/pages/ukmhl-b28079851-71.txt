6/ blade of mace, and a sliced carrot. Put in the partridge and cook over a brisk fire for about ten minutes, long enough to brown the birds a little. Then moisten with a pint of good stock. Trim and wash a small cabbage, cut it into quarters, and cook it in salt3d water till half done, drain well, press it in a cloth and tie up with string. Put the cabbage in the pan with the birds, season with salt and pepper, add two blanched pork sausages cut in short pieces, and cook the whole in the oven ; it will take about an hour. Take up the partridges, untruss them, also the cabbage, and remove the string. Strain the liquor or stock and return it to the braising-pan with about a gill of well-reduced brown sauce. Boil up and skim, now place in the partridges, the portions of cabbage, and the pieces of sausage, cover the pan, and let it cook gently for another ten minutes. The dish is then ready for serving, and should be sent to table. French Chicken-Pot. (Poule-au-Pot.)

Arrange them on an oblong dish, strain the liquor over the'^pieces of fowl, garnish with small braised onions and slices of carrot, or serve in a roundâ€™terrine.

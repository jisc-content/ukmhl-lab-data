// Egg Coquilles with Spinach. Have six or eight very small coqiiille or marmite pots, or china souffle cases, butter ' them and put a table-spoonful of prepared and seasoned spinach in each ; upon this put about a dessert-spoonful of cream. Break a fresh egg in each, season with pepper and salt, and bake care- â€¢ fully in a moderately heated oven for eight minutes. Dish up and serve quickly. Baked Stuffed Tomatoes. (Tomates farcies.) Chop finely four ounces of cooked cold ham, one ounce of beef-suet or fat bacon, and three or four mushrooms. Mix these with one teaspoonful of chopped parsley ; add a grate or two of lemon rind. Fry these ingredients in a little butter, then season, and moisten with a beaten egg. Remove the stalks from four large ripe but firm tomatoes. wipe them and cut each in halves. Scoop out some of thc- pulp, which may, if liked, be mixed with the stuffing. Put enough of the mixture in each half of tomato to ccm- pletely fill them ; sprinkle the top with breadcrumbs, and put a small piece of butter in the centre of each. Put them on a buttered fireproof dish, and bake in a fairly hot oven for about twenty minutes.

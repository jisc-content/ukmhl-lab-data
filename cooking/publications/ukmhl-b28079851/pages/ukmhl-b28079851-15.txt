THE CHAFING DISH. Oh, I mu a festive chafing dish, I fomn, and froth, and bubble, I sing the song of meat and fish, And save a deal of trouble. In Jtitchen realm and dining hall The housewife notv is able, JVheu I respond unto her call, To cooli dinner on the table. CHAFING-DISH cookery is by no means a new invention, for it was practised in olden times for so-called rechauffes of game and poultry in rich and highly-flavoured wine sauces. The use of this convenient cooking apparatus has been revived in America, probably on account of the great dilTiculty experienced there among private families to get qualified cooks. The increasing knowledge of good cookery among all classes in this country as well as in the United States may also be responsible for the increasing popularity of the use of the chafing dish as the most handy and convenient cookery utensil for the preparation of tasty and quickly-cooked dishes. Some few years ago chafing-dish suppers became fashionable in London, and from that time the use of the chafing dish has become more and more popular. It is only right to say that if ever there was an article whose use was abused, whose object was misunderstood, and whose ability, or shall we say possibility, was undervalued.

When the cauliflower is done enough, take it up, place it on the dish in which it is to be served, and squeeze it gently together in a clean cloth, held with both hands. Stir half the cheese into the sauce, and then pour the sauce gently all over the flower; sprinkle the remainder of the cheese over the top, and brown it as maccaroni is browned. Serve it very hot.

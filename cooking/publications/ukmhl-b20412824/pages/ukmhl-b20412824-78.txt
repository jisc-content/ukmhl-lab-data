72 HIGH-CLASS COOKEEY. Cutlets a la Rachel. Ingredients, Six or seven Mutton Cutlets. One pound of Calf's Liver. Quarter of a pound of fat Bacon. A Pig's Caul. One small Carrot. One small Onion. Parsley, Bay-leaf, Thyme, all tied together. One Shalot. One Clove Garlic. Twelve Peppercorns. A small blade of Mace. Cut up the bacon and fry it for five minutes, having added the liver and other ingredients (except the cutlets and caul). When the liver is quite cooked, put all into a mortar and pound well; add seasoning to taste, and pass all through a wire-sieve; this makes foie gras. Trim the cutlets neatly; cook them, and press them between two dishes until cold. Mask them on one side with the foie gras; cover each one with a piece of caul; put in the oven to get hot; brush over with glaze. Dish in a circle on spinach or mashed potatoes; pour a little half-glaze round some macedoine in the centre, and serve.

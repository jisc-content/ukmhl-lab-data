HIGH-CLASS COOKERY. Stewed Trout. Ingredients. One Trout. Four Shalots. One pint of Fish Stock. One ounce of Butter. Two Cloves. One teaspoonful of Salt. Two saltspoonfuls of Cayenne. One Carrot. One Bay-leaf. One tablespoonful of Basil and Thyme mixed. A bunch of Parsley. Chop up the shalots and carrot, put them in a stewpan with the butter and parsley; let this get hot, add the stock, cloves, herbs and season- ing ; let all this simmer for one hour. Clean and wash the trout, tie round with broad tapes to prevent it breaking. Put the trout into a stewpan, strain the stock over it, add three glasses of port wine ; let it simmer gently till the fish is cooked ; it will take about half an hour. Take off the tapes carefully so as not to break the fish, reduce the stock it was cooked in, and pour over it. Hand lemon.

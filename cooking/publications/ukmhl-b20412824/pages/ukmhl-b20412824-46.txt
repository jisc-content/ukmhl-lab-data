40 HIGH-CLASS COOKEEY. Sole a la Colbert. Ingredients. Two Soles. Six Anchovies pounded. One Clove Garlic. Skin and fillet the soles. Fold them, by placing each fillet round the left thumb and twisting the two ends tightly together. Put them on to a baking sheet, previously buttered. Sprinkle them with a little salt and lemon-juice, cover with buttered paper, and bake in a quick oven for ten minutes. When done, stuff them with Maitre d'Hotel butter, roll in brown bread-crumbs. Dish in a circle, and pour sauce round. Sauce. Bone and pound the anchovies. Add them, with the clove of garlic, to half a pint of good melted butter, made with one ounce of butter, half an ounce of flour, and half a pint of fish- stock made from the bones of the soles; boil for six minutes, and strain before serving. Fish sauce is always better if it is made from â™¦ fish stock.

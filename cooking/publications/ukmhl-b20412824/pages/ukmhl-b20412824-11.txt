PEEFACE. The Eecipes for Plain Cookery," published about a year ago, written in a simple and concise form, have been so kindly received by our Stu- dents and the Public, that I now offer some of our High-Class Recipes, written in the same style, and hope they will give satisfaction, at all events to our Pupils. I have written these somewhat hastily during an extra pressure of work entailed by the Inventions Exhibition; and must^ therefore, ask forgiveness if, in some cases, the recipes are not as neatly worded as they should be. The recipes themselves I believe to be correct, and that is the great point. I have adopted the present style, hoping to avoid the fault of most cookery books, namely, that you must be a good cook before you can cook satisfactorily from the instructions given, which, in quantities at least, leave a great deal to the imagination. From time to time I hope to add to these Recipes, as **new dishes" suggest themselves, and are taught in the School. EDITH CLARKE, Lady Buperintendent, 23rd June 1886. *^* By an unfortunate oversight a fount of type which did not admit of the insertion of the usual accents was selected for the headings to the recipes; each will, however, he found properly accented in the Index.

108 HIGH-CLASS COOKBEY. Plain Salad. Ingredients, Lettuces, Watercress, Mustard and Cress, Endive, Cucumber, Celery, a little of each. Beetroot. One or two Spring Onions. Two tablespoonfuls of the best Salad Oil. One tablespoonful of Tarragon Vinegar. Pepper and Salt. Half a teaspoonful of made Mustard. One teaspoonful of Castor Sugar. (Cold boiled vegetables can be used as well, such as Potato, Carrot, Turnip, Cauliflower, etc.) Wash all the ingredients carefully to remove dirt and grit. Dry them well in a clean cloth; break up the leaves into small pieces and put them into the salad-bowl; do not use a knife to the green vegetables. Put the salt, sugar, and mustard into a tablespoon; fill it with tarragon vinegar, and stir to melt the salt and sugar and mix the mustard. Pour this over the salad, shake over some pepper, and add the oil last, mixing all well together. Kemember the old saying in making a salad, The vinegar should be measured out by a miser, the oil by a spend- thrift, and a maniac should mix it."

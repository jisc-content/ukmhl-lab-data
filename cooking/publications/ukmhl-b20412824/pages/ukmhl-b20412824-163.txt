HIGH-OLASS OOOKERT. 157 almonds chopped, and lastly the whites only of the eight eggs, whipped to a stiff froth. Bake in a moderate oven for one hour. Savarin. Ingredients, One pound of Vienna Flour. Half an ounce of German Yeast. Quarter of a teaspoonful of Castor Sugar. Two gills of Milk. Five Eggs. Three quarters of a pound of Butter. Warm one gill of milk, mix the yeast and sugar together, and stir the warm milk to them. Sift the flour into a basin, make a well in the middle, and pour in the milk with the yeast and sugar in it; just mix a little flour with it, and put it in a warm place to rise. When this sponge has risen to twice its original size, add the other gill of milk and two eggs; beat it well with the hand, adding by degrees the other three eggs and the butter beaten to a cream. Work all this well together, and put it into a mould to rise; when it has risen, bake it in a moderate oven for forty- five minutes. Turn it out, and when cold pour a good rum syrup over it.

One Clove Garlic. Two Cardamoms. One inch of Cinnamon. One tablespoonful of Curry-powder. One tablespoonful of Curry-paste. Quarter of a pound of Butter. Lemon-juice. Salt. Cut the meat in pieces; slice the onions and put them in a saucepan with the butter, carda- moms, garlic, and cinnamon; cook all this over the fire until the onions are quite tender, taking care that they do not brown; then stir in the powder, paste, meat, and salt.

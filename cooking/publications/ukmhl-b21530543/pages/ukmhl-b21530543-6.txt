4 is a way many people take uncl-r af- dictions, but she was not aware how wrong it was to weep away that time which might have been better spent in drying the tears of others. It was happy for her that Mr. Simp- son, the Vicar of Weston, was a pious man. One Sunday he happened to preach on the good Samaritan. It was a charity sermon, and there was a collection at the door. He called on Mrs. Jones after church, and found her in tears. She told him she had been much moved by his discourse, and she wept because she had so little to give to the plate; for though she felt very keenly for the poor in these dear times, yet she could not assist them. “ Indeed, Sir,” added she, “ I never so much regretted the loss of my fortune as this afternoon, when you bade us go and do likewise.” te You do not,” replied Mr. Simpson, “ enter into the spirit of our Sa- viour’s parable, if you think you cannot go and do likewise, without being rich. In the case of the good Samaritan you may observe, that charity was afforded more by kindness, and care* and medi- cine, than by money. You, Madam, were as much concerned in my sermon, as Sir John with his great estate; and to speak plainly, I have been sometimes surprised that you should net put yourself in the way of being more useful.”

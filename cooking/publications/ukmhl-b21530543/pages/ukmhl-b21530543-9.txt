7 ' Mrs. Jones resolved to spend two or three days in a week in getting ac- quainted with the state of the parish, and she took care never to walk out without a few little go$>d books in her pocket to give away. She found that among the numerous wants she met with, no small share was owing to bad management or to imposition. She was struck with the small size of the loaves. Wheat was now not very dear, and she was sure a good deal of blame rested with the baker. She sent for a shilling loaf to the next great town, where the mayor often sent to the bakers’ shops, to see that the bread was the proper weight. She weighed her own loaf against her country loaf, and found the latter two pounds lighter than it ought to be. This was not the sort ol grievance to carry to Sir John : but luckily the Squire was also a magistrate, and it was quite in his way. He told her he could remedy the evil, if some one would lodge an information against the baker. She dropt in on the blacksmith. He was at dinner. She inquired if his bread was good. “ Aye, good enough, mistress, for you see ’tis as white as your cap, if we had but more of it. Here’s a six- penny loaf, you might take it for a penwy roll !” He then heartily cursed Crib the baker, and said he ought to be hanged.

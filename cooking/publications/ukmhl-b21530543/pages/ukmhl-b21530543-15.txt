I will tell you the truth. When I first married, our John went to the Checquers every night, and I had my tea and fresh butter twice a day at home. This slop, which con- sumed a deal of sugar, began to rake my stomach sadly, as I had neither meat nor milk; at last (L am ashamed to own it) I began to take a drop of gin to quiet the pain, till in time I looked for my gin as regularly as for my tea. At last the gin, the ale-house, and the tea, began to make us both sick and poor, and I had like to have died with my first child. Parson Simpson then talked so finely to us, that we resolved, by the grace of God, to turn over a new leaf, and I promised John if he would give up the Checquers, I would break the gin bottle, and never drink tea in the afternoon, except on Sundays, when he was at home with me. We have kept our word ; and both our consciences are the better for it. Though meat is sadly dear, we can buy two pounds of fresh butter, and it gives five times the nou- rishment. And dear as malt is, I contrive to keep a drop of drink in the house for John, and John will make me drink half a pint with him every morning, and a pint a day when I am a nurse,”

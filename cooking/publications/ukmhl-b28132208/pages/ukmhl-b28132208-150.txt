146 PROPER METUOD OF CLEANING KITCHEN UTENSILS, DIRECTIONS FOR SERVANTS. THE PROPER METHOD OF CLEANING KITCHEN UTENSILS. The proper and thorough cleaning of all utensils used in cooking is, as wo before remarked, of the utmost importance; we therefore give directions for cleaning the principal of these. All pans should of course be kept scrupulously clean, but this remark applies especially to the fish-kettle, for if the smallest particle of the fish remains in the corners of the kettle, the flavour of the fish next cooked in it is apt to become tainted. To obviate this, it is always better before using a fish-kettle to place it over the fire for a few minutes with a little boiling water in it; the water should then be poured away, and the kettle well rinsed before it is used. To clean Iron Saucepans.â€”Fiist wash the saucepan well inside and out with plenty of hot water and soda, and then with a pot-range (a bunch of stiff twigs tied tightly together and cut evenly across) scour it thoroughly with hot water, fine sand, and, if necessary, a little soap. When the pan is quite clean and bright, rinse in fresh hot water, and set by the side of the fire to dry. Then put away in the proper place, turning it up so that the air may get in. Clean the lid of the saucepan in the same manner. If onions have lieen cooked in the pan, fine ashes may bo used instead of sand; they will help to remove the disagree- able odour. A saucepan that is clean on the outside will cook more quickly than one which is dirty.

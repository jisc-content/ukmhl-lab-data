BOILINGâ€”BOILED SALTED BOUND OF BEEP. 32 BOILING. Boiling is cooking food in sufficient water to cover it well. First, wipe the joint with a dry cloth, and, if necessary, tie it into proper form; then weigh it and allow twenty minutes to each pound and twenty minutes over. Have ready a pan of water boiling over the fire, and plunge the meat into it; allow it to boil very quickly for four or five minutes, then throw in a little salt, and skim. Draw the pan to the side of the fire, and allow it to simmer very gently for the rest of the time. The scum must be removed as it rises, and, if necessary boiling Avater must Ije added from time to time to keep the meat covered. The strings should be cut and removed before the joint is sent to table, and a silver skewer inserted if necessary to keep it in shape till it is cold. Directions for boiling salted meat and poultry are given under the receipts for those dishes. Boiled meat is considered to be more digestible than that which is roasted, baked, or broiled. All parts of mutton and lamb may be roasted, but only the leg, neck, and head should be boiled. TO BOIL A SALTED ROUND OF BEEF. 1 round of beef. I 4 carrots. 1 bunch of grreens. I 2 white turnips.

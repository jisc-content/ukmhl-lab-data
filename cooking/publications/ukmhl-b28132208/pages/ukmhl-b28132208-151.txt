PROPEB METHOD OP CLEANING KITCHEN UTENSILS. H7 Enamelled Pam.—Clean as directed for iron saucepans, using broken egg-shells instead of sand. Should the enamel have become slightly burned, this will be removed by the use of the egg-shells. Frj/in()-pans.—These should be washed in hot water and soda, without sand or soap, and then rinsed, dried thoroughly, and kept in a dry place. Copper Vessels.—The bright linings of copper vessels are best cleaned with the tips of the lingers, or soft rag. Rub well with soft soap, using just sufficient warm water to moisten it. When the inside is quite bright and clean, rinse, and then clean the outside by rubbing it with half a lemon dipped in powdered bath-brick, until all stains are removed. Rinse the vessel, dry it carefully, and put away. The skins of lemons from which the juice has been squeezed may be kept for cleaning coppers. 2'ins.—Rirst wash the tins in very hot water and soda. Moisten some whiting with water, dip a piece of flannel into it, and rub the tins all over with the mixture, taking care to go into all the corners; let the whiting dry on the tins, and then rub it off with a duster; polish with a chamois leather. Cake-iim,—A cake-tin should never be washed or polished inside. After it has been used, and while it is still hot, it should be rubbed first with a twist of paper, and then with a dry cloth. If it is wetted, the next cake -which is baked in it will be apt to stick, and break on being turned out. To scrub Tables, Shelves, Boards, —First brush or sweep away all dust, &c.j then wash the table with a flannel wrung out in liot water, sprinkle a little fine sand over it, soap a scrubbing-brush, and scrub with the grain of the wood (this will keep it smooth), until it is quite clean. Care- fully rinse away all the soap and sand, and dry the table with a cloth. Wood ash is sometimes used instead of sjind, and is supposed to help to keep the wood white.

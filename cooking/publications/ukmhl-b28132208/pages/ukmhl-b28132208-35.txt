FRIED BACON—LAMB’s OR CALF’s LIVER—CALF’s FEET. 31 TO FRY BACON OR HAM AND EGGS. 6 slices of ham or bacon. | 3 or 4 eggs. The bacon should be cut very thinly in slices, not more than a quarter of an inch in thickness. The best bacon is that which is alternately streaked with fat and lean. No butter or dripping is required in the pan when frying bacon, but constant turning is necessary. When done, take the slices from the pan, and place them in a hot dish before the fire. Have the number of eggs required previously broken, each in a separate cup, and place them gently in the pan, so as to preserve them in a round flat shape. Let them remain in the pan till the white is sot; take them out carefully with a slice, and place them on the bacon. The tasteful appear- ance of this dish is spoiled if the eggs be either broken or ragged, which is very apt to be the case if they are not first broken into cups.

140 MINCED PARSLEY—TEA—COFFEE COCOA. TO MINCE PARSLEY. First wash the parsley well, pick away all the stalks, and wring it in a cloth until quite dry. Then chop it with a sharp knife; toss it upon some porous paper, and it is ready for use. TEA. Tea of good quality is the cheapest in the end. To make good tea, the tea-pot should be heated and the water freshly boiling. Put in one teaspoonful of tea for each person and one more, pour in sufficient boiling water for the first round only, and infuse for from five to seven minutes. Add more water as required, and the result will be that the tea will be always fresh for use, and the tannic acid in the leaf will not be released as would be the case were the tea boiled or stewed. Some people prefer tea infused for fifteen or twenty minutes, but the method above described is that which is now generally recommended as being the most wholesome. COFFEE. It is well to buy ground coffee in small quantities, as it is best when freshly groimd. Put a table-spoonful of ground coffee in a jug or coffee-pot, add about half a pint of water when boiling, and let it stand five minutes to draw. Clear it by pouring a little into a cup, and pouring it back again. Do this three times. Put the lid on, and let the jug or pot stand in a sufficiently hot place for it almost to simmer for ten minutes. Serve with sugar and hot milk. Gafe- au-lait is made by taking a pint each of hot clear coffee and boiling milk; serve hot in the coffee-pot. COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. Put cocoa to taste in a breakfast cup, add a little cold milk, and make it into a smooth paste; then stir in equal quantities of boiling water and milk; sweeten and serve. Another method is to simmer it gently for about five minutes, which improves it. Chocolate is simply cocoa ground up with sugar and flavoured. It is more used as a sweetmeat

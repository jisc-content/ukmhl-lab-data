14 COOKING AND KITCHEN APPARATUS. COOKING AND KITCHEN APPARATUS. Kitchen Range.—The most important part of the cooking apijaratus is tlie range or grate. In general, too little care is bestowed by young persons, when setting up housekeeping, on the choice of this article. The size of the range should be in proportion to the size of the kitchen and of the household. The close range has almost entirely superseded the old- fashioned open one, and the kind in most general use has the fireplace in the centre, with an oven at either side, a high-pressure boiler being fitted at the back. Sauce and Stew-pans.—The choice of these vessels will depend on the requirements and judgment of the purchaser. Those generally used for ordinary cooking are made of iron, well tinned inside, and may be had of all sizes. It is con- venient to have one or two of the very smallest dimensions, made of block-tin, and also a few enamelled pans for delicate stews, &c. It is well also to have a few shallow saucepans, to be used for stews, or where only a small quantity of liquid is required.

CUTTINQ UP MEAT. 10 From 1 to 8 is the hind-quarter, and from 9 to 17 is the fore-quarter. According to the English plan, the meat is cut up more advantageously for roasting and broiling than by the Scotch plan. For instance, the rump and aitch bone, No& 2 and 3 (fig. 1), are cut in such a manner that the meat atfonls a much better steak than when cut as in fig. 2. The Scotch plan, on the other hand, gives more pieces for boiling; and thus each way seems suitable to the taste of the people who have resix'ctively adopted them. Fig. 3 represents the Siglish plan of cutting up mutton.

47 SOUPS AND BROTHS. SOUPS AND BROTHS. No middle-class kitchen should be without a stock-pot, which with ordinary care and attention will, by the proper selection and use of scraps and bones, supply the stock without which no soup, sauce, or stew can be satisfactorily prepared. Into the stock-pot should be put all bones from roasted or boiled joints broken up, the carcasses of poultry and game, if not too high, gravy, and scraps in general; if necessary, a few pounds of bones can bo bought and added. Cover these well with water, or the liquor in which a joint has been boiled; bring it to the boil; throw in a little salt and a few flavouring vegetables, and allow to simmer gently for five or six hours. Then strain the liquor into a basin, and set aside to get quite cold. Remove the fat from the top before using. In w'arm weather this stock must be reboiled every day, and in winter once in three days. The stock-jx)t must be washed and well scoured, rinsed, and dried each time after use. Another and vcr}- nutritious stock may be made from fish l)ones and trimmings, except those of mackerel, herring, and dried Jish. I^ut them into a pan, with sufficient water to cover them, and a small piece of the various flavouring vegetables, twelve peppercorns, and a blade of mace. Cover and simmer for two hours, skimming carefully and frequently. Strain through a sieve and allow the stock to cool. Then remove the scum from the top, and it is ready for use. This stock forms the foundation for many fish soup.s. A cod’s head may Ije used instead of bones and trimmings, or the litpior in which a turbot has been boiled. The stock for the more elaborate soups, such as brown, clear, and white souj)S, must be specially made from fresh meat. It is better flavoured when inade from different kinds of meat. If brown stock is wanted, brown meat must pre- dominate ; if a paler stock, brown and white meat in equal quantities; and if white stock, white meat only must be used.

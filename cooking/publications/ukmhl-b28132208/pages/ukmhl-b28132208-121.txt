Store in a dry and cool place; if it is the least damp the jam will turn mouldy. By careful attention to these rules, jam may be kept good for any length of time. GOOSEBERRY J.AM. 6 lb. gooseberries. | 6 lb. preserving sugar. Pick, top, and tail red gooseberries, thoroughly ripe. Boil them for twenty minutes, skimming frequently as required. Add the sugar. Boil for half an hour after the sugar is added. Skim well, and pour hot into earthenware jars. Cover and store as directed. If it be wished that the goose- berries should remain whole, dissolve the sugar in a little water or currant juice, and as soon as the sugar is melted and clear, put in the gooseberries. Shake the pan to prevent the jam burning. If it is stirred, the fruit may break. RASPBERRY, STRAWBERRY, BLACK CURRANT, AND APRICOT JAMS. These are made in the same maimer as gooseberry jam.

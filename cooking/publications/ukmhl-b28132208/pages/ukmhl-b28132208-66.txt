OATMEAL PORRIDGE. The best oatmeal for porridge is that which is coarse in the grains or particles, and which has been stored for twelve months. New meal is heating in its quality. Put a sauce- pan on the fire with water proportionate to the quantity of porridge required. Salt it to taste. When the water boils, begin sprinkling in the oatmeal with one hand, while you stir with a stick with the other. Endeavour to calculate what quantity of meal will be necessary to produce the desired thickness, and sprinkle it in as quickly as possible, so as to let it all boil equally. A common error is to continue putting in meal to the last. After aU the meal is in, continue boiling and stiiring for about ten minutes, taking care that no knots or lumps are formed. When sufficiently boiled, pour the porridge into dishes. This is genuine Scotch porridge, which is eaten when partially cool, with sweet milk. SAUCES. MUSHROOM SAUCE. 24 mushrooms.

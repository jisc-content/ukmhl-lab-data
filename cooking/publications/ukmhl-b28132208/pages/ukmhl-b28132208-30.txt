BROILED BEEFSTEAKâ€”MUTTON CHOPS. 26 use when the meat has been sufficiently hung, and may do more harm than good, by expelling the juices. TO BROIL BEEFSTEAK. 1 lb. beefsteak. I 2 oz. fresh butter. Pepper. I Salt. A beefsteak is the most suitable of all kinds of meat for broiling, and is universally relished. There are several parts of beef used for steaks, but in every case it should not be too newly killed. The best .steak is that cut from the rump (called in Scotland the lieuk-bone), because it is the most juicy and well flavoured. Steaks should be cut in slices of from three-quarters of an inch to an inch in thickness, and then into pieces of a convenient size for turning. Some persons dust the steaks with pepper before putting them to the fire, by which means the flavour of the pepper is infused through the mass. When placed on the gruliron, turn them very frequently. It is impossible to state any exact length of time to be employed in cooking a steak, for much depends on the tenderness and thickness of the meat, and on the strength of the fire. The taste of the individual who is to eat the steak must also regulate the length of time; some prefer steaks in a half-raw state, others like them well done. When they arc cooked, place the steaks on a hot dish, with a little good fresh butter and fine salt on each. Beefsteaks should be carried to table immediately on being dressed, and eaten forthwith, in order to be in perfection. If they stand, they lose a portion of their flavour and juice. When sauce is lequired, either mushroom or oyster sauce may be used. TO BROIL MUTTON CHOPS. 2 mutton chops. | Salt. Mutton chops should be cut from the middle of the loin, and about the same thickness as steaks. They are broiled in the same manner as steaks, and require equal attention. No butter is to be used in dishing, as the ehops are suffi- ciently fat in themselves. Sprinkle a little salt over them, and carry to the table immediately. Mushroom sauce may be used.

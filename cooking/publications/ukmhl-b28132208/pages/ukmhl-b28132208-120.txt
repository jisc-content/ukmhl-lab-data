116 JAM-MAKING. JAM-MAKING. Home-made jam, when properly and carefully prepared, is much cheaper and superior to that Avhicli is offered for sale. AVhen making jams or preserves, great care and attention must bo given to carrying out the following rules. (1) Let the fruit be sound, dry, free from dust, and if possible gathered under a morning sun. (2) Preserve the fruit upon the same day that it is gathered, and as soon after gathering as convenient. (3) Let the sugar be of the finest quality, whether white or brown. Good loaf-sugar, or the large crystallised white sugar, we consider the best for delicate fruits sucli as strawberries, apricots, &c., and for making syrups, but the raw brown sugar may be used for ordinary jam. Sugar tliat is extracted from the beetroot and other vegetables does not easily solidify, and so frequently causes jam made with it to ferment. There is no economy in using infeiior sugar: it throws up a great deal of scum, which has to Ije removed, and a large proportion of the jam is thus wasted. (4) Never stir with iron or pewter spoons, as they are liable to spoil tlie colour of the fruit; use a wooden spoon or spatula for the purpose. (5) If you do not possess a brass preserving pan, sub- stitute a porcelain-lined saucepan, but do not use an iron or tin-lined pan. Take care tliat the pan is scrupulously clean. Do not let it rest immediately on the fire, but fix it at least two inches above; the fruit and sugar are very apt to burn when close to the fire. (6) Skim away all froth as it rises, and continue to do this until no more comes. (7) If you wish to preserve the colour and flavour of the fniit, boil quickly and stir almost constantly, until the syrup will solidify when a little is dropped upon a cold jilate. Then pour the jam at once into dry and sound jars, and set it aside for twenty-four hours to become cold and firm.

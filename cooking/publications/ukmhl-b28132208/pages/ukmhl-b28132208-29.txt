The hare should be dished back upwards, as represented in fig. 7, and served with rich beef gravy and currant jelly. IIAKING MEAT. !Meat is prepared for baking in the same manner as for roasting. It should be placed in a deep dish and raised on a stand, to prevent the grease from soaking into it. Few joints are so good when baked as they are when roasted. The time allowed for baking meat should be the same as for roasting, and constant and careful basting is absolutely neces- sary. The sauce may be prepared in the same way as for roasting. BROILING.

Let it be heated on the fire for a few minutes before placing the meat upon it. If the bars, when warm, be rubbed with a piece of brown paper, and fat or suet, it will ]irevent the meat from sticking to them. The operation of broiling requires a clear strong fire, with no smoke. In almost all cases the meat ought to be frequently turned, which may be best done by means of a pair of small tongs; a fork should on no account be used, for it breaks the meat, and allows the gravy to run out. Broiling is applicable only to meat which is to be eaten immediately on being dressed. This is an advantage when expeditious cooking is required, but a disadvantage when there is any uncertainty as to tlie time at which the meat is to be eaten. Some cooks beat meat before broiling, as well as before frying, for the purpose of making it tender; this is of no

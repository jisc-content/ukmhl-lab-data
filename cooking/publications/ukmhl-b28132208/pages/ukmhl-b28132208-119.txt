115 GOOSEBERRY FOOL—TRIFLE. and flavour with cinnamon or any other spice. When the moss is dissolved, leaving nothing but a few thready fibres, strain it through a sieve into a mould. When cold, it will turn out easily, and have all the appearance of a firm blanc- mange. It is inexpensive, and is also agreeable to the palate, and very nutritious. GOOSEBERRY FOOL. 1 quart unripe gooseberries. I i lb. sugar. 1 cupftil water. I J pint cream. This is a simple way of preparing gooseberries, and very wholesome for children. Take full-grown unripe gooseberries. Top and tail them, and put them into a saucepan with the water. Cover them, and let them heat very slowly. AVhen the gooseberries are soft, but not broken, strain the water from them, put them in a dish and bruise them to a fine pulp, with sufficient sugar to sweeten. Let them stand till cold, and then mix the cream with them. Serve in a hash- dish, or large bowl. TRIFLE. 1 pint cream. 1 lemon (juice only). 12 ratafia biscuits. Raspberry jam. Nutmeg. 0 penny sponge-cakes. 1 gill sherry. 1 pint boiled custard. 3 oz. sifted sugar. 2 oz. candied peel. Take the cream, and put it in a basin, with the sugar and lemon-juice, ^^’hisk them well, and as the froth rises, lift it off with a flat spoon or fish-slice, and lay it in an unbroken state on the bottom of a hair-sieve turned up. Set a plate below to catch the drip from it. Continue to whisk till no more froth rises. This should be done a few hours before the cream is to be used. Next, place in a trifle bowl the sponge-cakes, grated nutmeg, and candied lemon-peel cut small. Upon these spread some raspberry jam, then pour in the wine and let it stand for a short time to soak the cakes, then pour over all the custard. It is now ready for the froth to bo piled neatly on the top. Garnish the edge with the ratafia biscuits, and the top with some thin shreds of candied peel or some pink crystallised sugar.

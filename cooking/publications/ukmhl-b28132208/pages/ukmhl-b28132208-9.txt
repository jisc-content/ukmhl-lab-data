COOKERY AND DOMESTIC ECONOMY. C O 0 K E K y. )OKERY is an art upon which so much of our daily comfort and heirlth depends, that it is of the higliest importance that it he well done. Every housewife may not be able to procure the finest kinds of food, but every one has it in her power to make the most of that which she can procure. By a certain degree of skill and attention, very humble fare may be dressed in such a manner that it will almost rival the more expensive dishes, both in savouriness and nutritiousness. A good housewife suffers nothing to be lost or spoiled. Mere scraps, Avhich a careless individual would perhaps throw away, are put to a proper use, and by means of certain auxiliary seasoning, brought to table in a now and attractive guise. Even if little or nothing be absolutely saved by these economical arrangements, the dressing of food in a tasteful manner is a point of some importance. When a dish has a slovenly appearance, is smoked, underdone, or prepared with rancid or unclean seasoning, both the eye and the palate are offended, independently of the injury which may possibly bo done to the stomach of the eater. In every respect, therefore, it is consistent with good judgment to prepare food for the table in the most tasteful and agreeable manner.

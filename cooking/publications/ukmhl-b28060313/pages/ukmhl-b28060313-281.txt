FRESH-WATER FISH. 261. —Fresh-water Fish are equally nutritious with those of the sea; they are much lighter as food, and therefore easier of digestion ; they are, however, more watery, and it is requisite to use salt, in order to extract the watery particles. Every sort of fresh-water fish ought, therefore, as soon as killed and cleaned, to have salt well rubbed inside and outside, and should be allowed so to remain for some time before it is cooked, when it should be well washed out with pure spring water, and wiped thoroughly dry witli a clean cloth. If bred in ponds, it often acquires a muddy smell and taste ; to take off which, soaking in strong salt and water, or, if of a size to bear it, scalding in the same, will have the proper effect. SALMON 262. —Has ever been looked upon as the most pre-eminent of all fresh-water, and indeed, by some, of every species of fish ; but those who have lived in the neighbourhood of salmon fisheries can alone have tasted this monarch of the floods in fitll perfection. It should be dressed before it has lost a tide. Families who purchase a whole salmon, and like it quite fresh, should parboil the portion not required for the day’s consumption, and lay it aside in the liquor, boiling up the whole together when wanted; by which means the curd will be set, and the fish be equally good on the following day. If new, and in season, the flesh is of a fine red (the gills parti- cularly), the scales bright, and the whole fish stiff. When in greatest perfection, there is a whiteness between the flakes, which gives great firmness; by keeping, this melts down, and the fish becomes more rich, but suffers somewhat in flavour. The Thames salmon bears the highest price, both in conse- quence of its generally acknowledged superiority, and its great scarcity; we have known 12s. a pound paid for it when in the

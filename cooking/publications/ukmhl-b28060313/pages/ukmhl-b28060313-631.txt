ENGLISH WINES. 824.â€”English wines may be made very advantageously by families who have gardens, as, from the reduced price of sugar, they cost but little comparatively with foreign wines, all of which pay heavy duties. They should^ however, be thoroughly fermented, and be made of such strength as to keep sound for 3 or 4 years, and never be drunk until they are more than a year old ; whereas those housewives who look too closely to economy weaken them so much with water as to cause them soon to turn sour. In the south of Europe the grape contains all the chemical properties which enable it to undergo complete fer- mentation, and from which perfect wine can be produced ; but the artificial composition of the fluids on which the maker of domestic wine in England has to operate makes it advisable that a few words should be said upon the subject. The sub- stances essential to vinous fermentation are sugar, vegetable extract, the tartaric or malic acids, and water. None of these can be dispensed with, and it is in the balancing of them that the art greatly consists. Sugar is the most essential of these, as it is from its decomposition that alcohol is derived. The most saccharine juices therefore may be made to produce the strongest wine: hence the absolute necessity of adding sugar th all English fruit, in which the malic acid so largely predominates ; and it is from the judicious mixture of sugar and water with this acid that our best native wines are produced, as by this only will the process of fermentation be effectually carried on. Any one attempting to make wine from the juice of currants or gooseberries, or even ripe grapes, alone, would at once perceive this. The use of brandy is quite unnecessary

MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXVII. 550 CHAPTER XXVII. CAKES, BUNS, AND GINGERBREAD. CAKES. 770.— Observations.—In making- cakes it is indispensably ne- cessary that all the ingredients should be heated before they are mixed together; for which purpose everything should be prepared for an hour or two previously to their being wanted, and placed near the fire or upon a stove—the flour thoroughly dried and warmed; the currants, sugar, carraway-seed, and anything else required, heated in the same way; butter and eggs should be beaten in basins fitted into kettles or pans of warm water, which will give them the requisite degree of temperature. Without these precautions, cakes will be heavy; and the best materials, with the greatest pains, will fail to produce the desired results. The following observations should also be strictly attended to:— Currants should be very nicely washed, dried in a cloth, and then set before the fire. If damp, they will make cakes or puddings heavy. Before they are to be used, a dust of dry flour should be thrown among them, and a shake given to them, which causes the cakes to be lighter. Eggs should be very long beaten, whites and yolks apart, and always strained. Sugar should be pounded in a mortar or rubbed to a powder on a clean board, and sifted through a very fine hair or lawn sieve. Lemon-peel should be pared very thin, and, with a little sugar, beaten in a marble mortar to a paste ; and then mixed with a little wine or cream, so as to divide easily among the other ingredients. The pans should be of earthenware; nor should eggs or batter and sugar be beaten in tins, as the cold- uess of the metal will prevent them from becoming light.

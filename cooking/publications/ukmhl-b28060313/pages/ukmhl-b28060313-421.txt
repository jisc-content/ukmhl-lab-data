Chap. XXI.] EICE. 389 RICE CAUDLE. 508. —When the water boils pour into it some ground rice mixed with a little cold water ; when of a proper consistency, add sugar, lemon-peel, and cinnamon, and a glass of brandy to a quart. Boil all smooth. Or :—Soak some Carolina rice in water an hour, strain it, and put 2 spoonfuls of the rice into 11 pint of milk ; simmer till it will pulp through a sieve, then put the pulp and milk into the saucepan, with a bruised clove and a bit of white sugar. Simmer 10 minutes: if too thick, add a spoonful or two of milk, and serve with thin toast. RICE FL UMMER Y. 509. —Boil with a pint of new milk a bit of lemon-peel and cinnamon; mix with a little cold milk as much rice-flour as will make the whole of a good consistence ; sweeten, and add a spoonful of peach-water, or a bitter almond beaten ; boil it, but take care it does not burn; pour it into a shape or pint basin, taking out the spice. When cold, turn the flummery into a dish, and serve with cream, milk, or custard, round; or put a teacupful of cream into i pint of new milk, a glass of white wine, ^ a lemon squeezed, and sugar, and pour over it. Rice Paste.—Take ground rice and butter, work it like short crust, adding a little sugar to make it eat crisply, only using wheaten flour to roll it out with on the board; more or less butter must be added, according to the richness required. Or. if for relishing things:—Clean and put some rice, with an onion, and a little water and milk, or milk only, into a saucepan, and simmer till it swells. Put seasoned chops into a dish, and cover it with the rice; by the addition of an egg the rice will adhere better.

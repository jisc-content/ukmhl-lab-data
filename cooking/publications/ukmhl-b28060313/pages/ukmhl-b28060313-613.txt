Rye-bread may be made in the same manner as wheaten, and if both be mixed, as meslin, it has a very agreeable flavour, approaching to acidity. The grain, though dark- coloured, and the flour very brown, yet forms excellent bread at half the price of that made of wheat, and very far superior to that of maize.

Warm a gill of milk and water; make a hole in the middle of the flour and put into it a gill of brewer’s yeast, making it all into a thin batter, which must be stirred until quite free from lumps: then strew a handful of flour over it ; set it in a warm place, and leave it to rise, which will take 2 hours or more; let it,

( i" ) PREFACE. The advanced state of the art of Cookery having rendered Mrs. Rundell’s book insufficient for the guidance of the modern cook, it has been found necessary to remodel her work, and to replace those receipts which have become obsolete by others founded upon the newer methods adopted by the best cooks of the present day. The present enlarged collection of original receipts will be found to possess strong claims to attention, having been carefully selected from family MSS., tried and vouched for by the parties from whom they have been obtained. In the choice of them great attention has been given to the subject of economy, and the arrangement of the whole work, previously enriched with the valuable contributions of the late Miss Emma Roberts,a has been placed under the careful inspection of a Lady well versed in the art of which it treats. The book has had the • further advantage of being thoroughly revised by a profes- sional gentleman of great repute in London, who has also sup- plied several valuable receipts. Without wishing to disparage any of the numerous modern productions which have been given to the public, it may be affirmed that, although the treatises of professional cuisiniers on the subject are valuable to those who are competent to cany out their receipts, yet, generally speaking, they are too scientific for the comprehension a The receipts marked E. It. were contributed by Miss Roberts. a 2

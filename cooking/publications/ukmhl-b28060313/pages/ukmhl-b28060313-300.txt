268 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVI. CHAPTER XVI. SHELL-FISH. 278.—Although crabs and lobsters may be seen at the fishmongers’ the whole year round, they are yet only in high season and plentiful from the month of April till the close of October. They should be always purchased alive, for many are found dead in the cobles in which they are brought from Norway, and are then boiled and sold under pretence of their having been just killed.

Many people are shocked at the apparent cruelty of thus kill- ing them, but death takes place immediately, and life cannot be taken away without pain. When sent to table to be eaten cold, the tail and body shoulc be split from end to end, the claws cracked, but not unshel e ,

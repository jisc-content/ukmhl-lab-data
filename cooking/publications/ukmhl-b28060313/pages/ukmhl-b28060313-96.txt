64 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VI. To choose a Codfish.—Select a short fish. The gills should be very red, and the eyes full and glossy; for if dull and pale, it is a sure sign of the fish being stale. It should be round and thick at the neck, from which the body swells and carries its fulness nearly down to the tail. It should be perfectly stiff, and elastic to the touch; for if, when pressed by the finger, the mark of the indentation remains, it will eat less firm and flaky, and should therefore be rejected. The colour of the liver should be of an opaque white cast, and the whiter the liver the better the fish: when out of season, the liver becomes red. It is improved by being crimped, as this increases its firmness, and then it requires keeping one day before using. Mackerel.—The eye should be full, and the stripes on the back distinctly black: those on the male are straight, those on the female are wavy. The male fish is the best. The body should be full from the shoulders. Salmon.—If fresh and in season, the flesh is of a fine red, the scales silvery, very firm in the belly, and the whole fish stiff.

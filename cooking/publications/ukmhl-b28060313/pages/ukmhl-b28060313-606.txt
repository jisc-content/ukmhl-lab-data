MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXVIir. 574 CHAPTER XXVIII. BREAD. On the making of bread a few previous observations are ne- cessary. FLOUR. 804.—With regard to that most essential object, the quality of the flour, we need hardly insist that it should' not only be good but of the best corn, that being the best economy, both in point of price, and the kind, as well as quantity, of the bread made from it. Cheap bread must ever be of indifferent quality. The flour of which it is made is always ground either from damaged wheat, or that of the most inferior kind, mixed by the miller with a little of the better sort, and made up by the baker with potato starch, alum, and soda, to render it apparently good. If you grow your own wheat, winnow it, screen it, scutch it, air it, and do not send it to the mill until 12 months old: even then, do not trust it to the miller, unless under your own eye or that of a confidential servant. The value of wheaten flour consists, besides its purity, in the quantity which it contains of that portion of the grain termed “ gluten,” of which there is more in that grown in the southern climates than in those of the north; which may in some degree account for the superiority ascribed to the Ame- rican flour imported into this country from Virginia.11 The flour should never be made from corn that is not some months old, and should be kept in a dry part of the house for a few weeks before being baked. Household Bread of very wholesome quality may be made with coarser flour, or even by merely screening off the out- n The American flour imbibes more water than the English on making it into bread ; for it has been stated, in comparative experiments, that a stone of 14 lbs. weight of the American flour will make 21 lbs. of bread, but the best sort of English flour only produces about 18£ lbs.

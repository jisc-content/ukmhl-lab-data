SAUSAGES. 436.—In making sausages there is so great a variety of both meat and condiments, that the cook need not be tied down to any rule of composition. The usual mode is to put the pre- paration into the cleaned skins of the entrail-puddings of the smaller animals; in which the sausages, being always well seasoned, will keep sound for a few days, and are then broiled as a garnish for large dishes, or fried for breakfast. As these skins are, however, not always to be found, the sausage-meat may then be bound together with the yolk of egg and bread- crumbs, made into the form of sausages, or as croquettes of any small size; then floured, nicely warmed, and browned in the frying-pan or Dutch oven until perfectly done. If more be made than is wanted for immediate use, it may be put away in a cool place, packed closely down in a stone jar, and securely covered for some other occasion. For the spicing of sausages no rule can be laid down, as tastes and custom are constantly varying. Common Sausage-meat.—Take any quantity of lean beef or pork, with half the quantity of fat, and having freed the lean of every particle of skin, sinew, and gristle, then mince both it and the fat as fine as possible ; putting to each pound of meat a large teaspoonful of pepper and the same quantity of salt; strew this on the meat, and mix the whole thoroughly together, as a stock for further seasoning. Take 6 lbs. of meat, fat and lean ; cut the fat into small pieces, and pound the lean portion in a mortar, with 2 table- spoonfuls of salt, one of moist sugar, a teaspoonful of saltpetre, and 2 tablespoonfuls of mixed spices. To this may be added the grated peel of a lemon, and a small portion of sage and thyme, jvell chopped. Or:—To the meat of a leg of pork of about 4 lbs. weight

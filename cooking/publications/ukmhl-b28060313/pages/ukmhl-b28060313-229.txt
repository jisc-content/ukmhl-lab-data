197 POULTRY AND GAME. Chap. XIII.] A la Braise.—Take out the breastbone of the turkey; fill it with sausage-meat; lard the breast, braise it, and serve with celery, oyster, or chestnut sauce. Observe:—A small hen-bird boils better than a cock, and the best mode is to roast the cock-turkey and boil the hen. Turkey pulled and grilled is a mode of preparing the remains of cold turkey by mincing the white meat and fricasseeing it with white sauce; the legs being scored, peppered and salted, broiled, and sent up over the mince. Or devilled, as thusOn the rump, gizzard, and a drum- stick, put salt, pepper, and cayenne. Let them be broiled, and brought to table as hot as possible; cut them in small pieces, pour- over them a ladle of mustard, ditto of melted butter, a spoonful of soy, ditto of lemon-juice, and some of the gravy out of the dish; mix quickly and hand round. It forms an admirable relish; fowls may be treated in the same manner. CAPON, OR POULARDE, 209.-—Should be stuffed and roasted, or otherwise dressed, in . precisely the same manner as turkey. They are the male and female of the common fowl, but, when caponed, grow nearly to the size of turkeys, and are very rarely, if ever, boiled. A la Provengale.—Half roast the fowl; cut it in pieces; take a dozen onions, cut them in rings, add a little parsley chopped. Place them in a stewpan, laying a bed of onions and parsley, then fowl, till the whole are used: add a glass of oil or cream with 1 or 2 bay-leaves and salt; let them simmer slowly ; dish the fowl, put the onions in the middle, add a little sauce, and send it to table. FOELEE TO BOIL FOWLS IN. 210.—Take 2 lbs. of veal and 2 lbs. of bacon; cut both into large dice; cut also 2 large carrots and 2 onions into dice; put them, with a pound of butter, into a stewpan, the juice of 4 lemons, a little thyme or sweet fennel, and 2 laurel-leaves bruised ; season it with salt and pepper; put them on a good fire; add a spoonful of boiling broth, and boil it.

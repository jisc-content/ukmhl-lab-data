248 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIV. SPRA TS 260.—May be smoked, dried, and potted like herrings, but the most common mode of cooking is to fry, or rather to broil, them on a close-barred gridiron, as their oiliness, when fried, increases the rankness of their flavour. They ought not to be gutted with the knife, but, if the head be cut off, the gut may be drawn out at the same time. They come into the London market on Lord Mayor’s Day, and go out of season at the close of January. Most people eat them with salt alone, but a little lemon-juice, with a few grains of cayenne pepper, will be found an improvement. As they must be eaten quite hot, and are by many consi- dered very nice, yet, as their odour in the parlour is disagree- able, it is not unusual among amateurs to have them at supper “ as a sprat feast,” at the kitchen fire.

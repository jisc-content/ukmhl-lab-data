The great excellence of English Jish, and the fresh state in which it is, in London, generally brought to table, combined with the simplicity of our national tastes in cookery, render it unnecessary to resort to much art in the preparation of the finer kinds, which are usually preferred simply boiled, broiled, or fried ; but this only holds good with the superior varieties, whereas skate, halibut, ling, plaice, flounders, mackerel, and many others, may be much improved by the method of dressing them.

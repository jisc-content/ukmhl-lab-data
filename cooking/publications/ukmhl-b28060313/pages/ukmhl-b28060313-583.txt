Chap. XXVII.] CAKES. 5o 1 Use no flour but the best superfine; for if the flour be of inferior quality the cakes will be heavy, ill-coloured, and unfit to eat: but if a little potato-flour be added, it will improve their lightness. Cakes are frequently rendered hard, heavy, and uneatable, by misplaced economy in eggs and butter, or for want of a due seasoning in spice and sugar. After all the articles are put into the pan, they should be thoroughly and long beaten, as the lightness of the cake de- pends much on their being well incorporated. Unless you are provided with proper utensils as well as materials, the difficulty of making cakes will be so great as in most instances to be a failure. Accuracy in proportioning the ingredients is also indispensable ; and therefore scales, weights, and measures, down to the smallest quantity, are of the utmost importance. Iron ovens are desirable, as well for their economy of fuel as for the short time in which they can be heated, and on account of the celerity and convenience with which one person may prepare large quantities of small pastry, and bake it also. The most vigilant care and attention are necessary in order to secure success in the baking of delicate pastry or cakes ; for however well they may have been prepared, if not equally well baked, the result will be unsatisfactory; we there- fore recommend a newly- invented moveable oven, made of iron, as represented in the cut ; it is manufac- tured in Paris, but will no doubt be soon copied in London. The hearth, at a, is placed underneath ; and the smoke of a charcoal fire escapes through a flue at the back, after heating the oven, b, by means of a flue passing round it. It also may be made to act as a stove for many other purposes.1 The heat of the oven is of great importance, especially for large cakes. If not lighted long enough to have a body of heat, or if it is become slack, the cake will be heavy. If n ‘ La Cuisinifcre (le la Campagne,’ p. 26.

21 Chap. II.] CARVING. pieces may be cut from them. The ribs are reckoned the finest part; but some people prefer the neck end, between the shoulders. Hare.—Put the point of the knife under the shoulder at b, and so cut all the way down to the rump, 31011" the sides of the backbone, in the line b, a, cutting- it in moderately thick slices ; or, after removing- the shoulders and legs, cut the back crosswise in 4 or 5 pieces; but this can only be done when the hare is very young or when it is boned. To separate the legs and shoulders, put the knife between the leg and back, and give it a little turn inwards at the joint, which you must endeavour to hit, and not to break by force. The shoulders may be removed by a circular cut around them ; but, although called the “ sportsman’s portion,” are generally thought in- ferior, and are seldom served until the other parts have dis- appeared. The back is the most delicate part, and next to that the thighs. A portion of the stuffing should be served with each slice. The brains and ears of sucking-pig, hare, and rabbit, are also considered epicurean tit-bits, which must •not, be neglected ; wherefore, when every one is helped, cut off the head, put your knife between the upper and lower jaw and divide them, which will enable you to lay the upper flat on your plate ; then put the point of the knife into the centre, and cut the head into two. Roast Rabbits.—Proceed as for hare. Roiled Rabbits.—The legs and shoulders should be first taken off, and then the back cut across into 2 parts, which is easily done by a bend of the knife in the joint underneath, about the middle of the back. I lie back, as in the hare, is the best, and some of the liver should always accompany it.

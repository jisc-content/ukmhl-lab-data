MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVIII. 348 the sauce till the moment the salad is wanted, or it loses all its crispness and becomes sodden. On which Mr. Ford quotes a Spanish proverb which says, “ To make a good salad four persons are wanted,—a spend- thrift for oil, a miser for vinegar, a counsellor for salt, and a madman to stir it all up.” Vegetable Salads, made of roots which have been boiled, also make good winter salads, amongst which potato salad is perhaps the best. Cut the roots into thin slices, season them with pepper and salt, and pour over them the salad mixture, to which may be added, if the flavour be not disapproved, a few slices of raw onion. For Vinaigrette.—Take any kind of cold meat, chop it finely, and lay it in a dish ; chop the whites of the eggs em- ployed for the salad very finely with small onions ; add any kind of herb, and pickled cucumbers, all chopped finely: make a garnish round the meat, serve it with salad mixture, but do not stir it together, as it would spoil the appearance of the dish, which looks very pretty with the eggs and herbs in a ring. Beet-root, celery, Spanish onions, carrots, and broccoli may also in winter be cut small, and served with the same mixture as that employed for vegetables in their raw state. In summer, purslain, an herb formerly much cultivated in England, is an excellent ingredient among the many raw materials; and tomatas boiled, left until cold, sliced, not very thin, and eaten either with or without onions and any other vegetable, also make a very nice salad, in either summer or winter, as they may be preserved nearly the whole year round. When very delicately made, cream is sometimes substituted for oil in salads, as it pleases some palates, and many persons object to oil as disagreeing with their stomachs; but, in point of richness, its flavour is generally thought inferior.

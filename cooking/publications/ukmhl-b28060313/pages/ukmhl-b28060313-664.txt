MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXXI. 632 flower water and a bitter almond or two : then pour 1 quart of milk and water to the paste. Sweeten with sugar or capil- laire. This is a fine drink for those who have a tender chest; in the gout it is highly useful, and with the addition of ^ oz. of gum arabic has been found to allay the painfulness of the attendant heat. 4 a glass of brandy may be added if thought too cooling in the latter complaints, and the glass of orgeat may be put into a basin of warm water. Orangeade, or Lemonade.—Squeeze the juice, pour boiling water on a little of the peel, and cover close. Boil water and sugar to a thin syrup, and skim it. When all are cold, mix the juice, the infusion, and the syrup, with as much more water as will make a rich sherbet; strain through a jelly-bag. Or :■—Squeeze the juice, and strain it, and add water and capillaire. It is, however, still better when made with the juice of unripe grapes. The usual mode, however, of making Lemonade is to pour 1 quart of boiling water on the rinds of 6 lemons, and let it stand for 3 or 4 hours ; add the juice of the lemons witli ! lb. of sugar ; simmer it wel l and skim it; then add another quart of boiling water. Either run it through a jelly-bag, or mix a glass of calf’s-foot jelly, which will make it rich. Tamarinds, or Cranberry Juice, with double the quantity of water, also form a pleasant drink for an invalid, when ap- proaching to convalescence.

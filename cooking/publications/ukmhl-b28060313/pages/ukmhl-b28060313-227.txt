A large fowl will take 1 of an hour, a middling one 4 an hour, and a small one 20 minutes. Care must be taken that they are well and thoroughly done. A small turkey will take 11 hour, turkey-poults only 1 hour, a goose 1 hour, larger turkeys and geese 11 hour: both should have the breasts papered. Chickens take t an hour; pigeons 20 minutes, and may be dressed as soon as killed. Ducks and ducklings the same as fowls and chickens, but all must vary in proportion to their difference of size, the temperature of the air, and the state of the fire; and the cook must acquire cor- rectness by experience. The French adopt the following method to make old poultry eat tender:—Let the bird soak in cold water for 24 hours, \yith a handful or two of wood-ashes; pick off the feathers, and let it hang for another 24 hours; truss it, and let it boil for i of an hour in a little veal-broth ; take it out, lard, and roast it; when nearly done, baste it with very hot butter. By observing tl^ese directions, you will impart to an old bird all the delicate flavour of a young chicken. In drawing poultry the cook must be careful not to crack the gall-bladder, for then no washing will remove the bitter- ness. Ignorant cooks sometimes draw fowls by cutting a hole in their side, but it should be done through the vent, and, that being cut off, a string should fasten the rump close to the front part.

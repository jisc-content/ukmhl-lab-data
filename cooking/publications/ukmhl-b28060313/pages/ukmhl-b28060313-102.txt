MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VII. TO If soups or gravies are too weak, do not cover them in boil- ing, that the watery particles may evaporate; but if strong, cover the stewpan close. If they want flavour, the gravy from spiced and hunter’s beef, or most of the prepared sauces, will give it to meat-soups ; and herring-brine, or anchovy, with walnut ketchup and soy, will add to those of fish ; but must be used cautiously. When fat remains on any soup, a teacupful of flour and water mixed quite smooth, and boiled in it, will make it rise as scum, when it may be taken off’. If richness or greater consistency be wanted, a good lump of butter mixed with flour, and boiled in the soup, will give either of these qualities. Long boiling is necessary to give the full flavour of the ingredients, therefore time should be allowed for soups and gravies. Skim frequently and simmer slowly ; but do not let the broth cool until it is completely made. Be sparing in the use of pepper, salt, and spices. If onions are too strong, boil a turnip with them, and it will render them mild. Do not keep either soups or gravies in any vessel of tin or copper; and in stirring soup, do it always with a wooden spoon. MEAT-SOUPS. The basis of all well-made soups is composed of what our English cooks call “ Stock, or broth, made from all sorts of meat, bones, and the re- mains of poultry or game ; all of which may be put together and stewed down in the “ Stock-potthe contents of which are, by the French, termed Consomme. This is chiefly used for the preparation of brown or gravy soups: that intended for wlnte soups being rather differently compounded, though made in nearly the same manner.

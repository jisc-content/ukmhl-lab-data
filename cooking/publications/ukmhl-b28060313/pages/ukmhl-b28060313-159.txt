BEEF TONGUE. 94.—If it has been dried and smoked, before it is dressed it should be soaked overnight; but if only pickled, a few hours will be sufficient. Put I it into a pot of cold water, and I set it over a slow fife for an hour or two before it comes to a boil; then put it aside, and keep it simmering for 34 to 4 hours, according to its size : you can ascertain when it is done by probing Tougue Garnished, it with a skewer. Peel it, trim the root, glaze it, and before serving surround the root with a paper frill, and stick a flower or two on the top. Its appearance, and its flavour also, may be improved by rubbing it over, when skinned, with yolk of egg, on which crumbs of bread and finely-minced sweet-herbs may be strewed ; then slightly basting it with butter, and browning it with a salamander. To stew Tongue.—Salt a tongue with saltpetre and common salt for a week, turning it everyday; boil it tender enough to peel ; when done, stew it with a moderately strong gravy ; season with soy, mushroom-ketchup, cayenne pepper, pounded cloves, and salt if necessary. Serve with truffles, morels, and mushrooms stewed in gravy.

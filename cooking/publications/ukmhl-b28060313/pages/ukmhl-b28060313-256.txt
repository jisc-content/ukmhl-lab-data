224 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIII. FRIED BREAD FOR GARNISHING. 239.—Take slices of stale bread about a third of an inch thick, cut them into shapes with a paste-cutter, fry them in fresh batter a light brown, lay them upon a cloth to dry, and place them round the dish. They may be made to adhere by brushing the under part with a little flour mixed with white of egg. Bread-crumhs.—All game and small birds are improved by the addition of bread-crumbs, either fried or toasted; the latter is the more delicate preparation : grate the crumbs, and put them into a tin shallow dish before the fire, shaking thent occasionally until they are well browned: send them up in the dish ; with a tureen of good brown gravy made from the insides and trimmings of'the birds, but without any kind of seasoning.

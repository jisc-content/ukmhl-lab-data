MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIX. 592 CHAPTER XXIX. COFFEE, TEA, AND CHOCOLATE. 820.—Either coffee, tea, or chocolate, forms the constant foundation of our English breakfast; and the two former are also such a common evening refreshment that it would be unpardonable to pass them over without remark. Formerly coffee was hardly ever seen at the breakfast-table in England, and was, indeed, only rarely brought forward in the evening, except for a party, and along with tea. It was also then made insufferably weak—consequently bad— and without any knowledge either of the proper mode of pre- paring it, or care for the original quality of the berry ; which ought to be rather pale in colour, small in size, and of a roundish form. Nothing can be more grateful to the stomach, or more favourable to digestion, than a cup of good strong coffee —or, as the French call it, cafe noir—soon after dinner ; and if it be followed by a small glass of liqueur, as chasse cafe, it will be found equally agreeable to the palate. Still, however, there is much to be learned respecting the best mode of pre- paring it; and as this is more scientifically done in Paris than in London, we here offer a few directions on the subject. Independently of the mode of making, the coffee should be of good quality, or the flavour will suffer in proportion to its inferiority. The Mocha is the best, and the Java good; but the sorts most commonly used in this country arc the Jamaica and the Berbice, which are both excellent when well chosen and undamaged. To this must be added the age to which it should be kept: for, if used soon after being gathered, it has an unpleasant coarseness of flavour. In those countries where it is grown it is seldom used until 3 years old; and if older will be all the better. It should always be exposed to the air, and kept very dry. The best mode is, to buy it raw, and keep it for a

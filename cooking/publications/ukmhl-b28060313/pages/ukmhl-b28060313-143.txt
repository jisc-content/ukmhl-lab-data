SOUPES MAIGRE. Chap. VII.] Ill N.T).—This will be found a most excellent soup, and, being easily and quickly made, is useful upon an emergency, when such an addition is suddenly required to the dinner. ONION SOUP MAIGRE. 74. —Slice a dozen large onions—Spanish, if they can be got—with a couple of turnips and 2 heads of celery. Fry them in J-lb. of butter until quite brown, but not allowing them to burn. When of a nice colour, put them into a gallon of boiling water, with either a soft-roed red herring, or 2 or 3 anchovies, or a tablespoonful of anchovy sauce, seasoned with a few blades of pounded mace and some grains of allspice, pepper, and salt, and let the whole stew until it is tender enough to pulp. When ready, have the crumb of a couple of French rolls boiled in milk, and pass them along with the vegetables through the colander. Put it again on the fire to stew for a few minutes till quite hot; and if not sufficiently thick, add the yolks of raw eggs, to be beaten up into the soup when just going to be put on the table. CABBAGE, SPINACH, AND LETTUCE SOUPES-MAIGIiES. 75. —Put from 4 lb. to a lb. of salt butter in a stewpan, according to the quantity wanted: throw in 3 or 4 sliced onions to brown; when nicely coloured, add the vegetables .cut fine, along with a small handful of peppercorns, a handful of chervil and sorrel, a few cloves, and the necessary quantity of salt, and let all simmer together until tender, though not so soft as to become a pulp. That done, beat up the yolks of a few eggs with the pith of a French roll or two wetted in some ginger-wine until they become thoroughly soaked; beat them up with a fork, and mix them gradually with the soup to thicken it. It should then be served immediately. A squeeze of lemon may be added.

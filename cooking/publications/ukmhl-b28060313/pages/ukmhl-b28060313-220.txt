MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIT. 188 rub it after the first. When it is to be dressed weigh it: let it lie ^ an hour in cold water to make it white : allow pof an hour for every lb., and 4 an hour over, from the time it boils up : skim it as soon as it boils, and frequently after, but do not boil it fast, or it will be hard. Allow water enough. Save some of the water to make pea-soup. Some boil it in a cloth, floured, which gives a very delicate look, but destroys the value of the liquor for making soup. PORK CUTLETS. 190. —Perhaps few things of a simple nature, and served in a plain way, are better than a hot pork chop, cut about 4 an inch thick, trimmed neatly, and broiled upon the gridiron.

PORK CURRY. 191. —Take pork cutlets, cut rather fat, and proceed as for veal curry. SADDLE OF PORK. 192. —Have a saddle of pork cut as a saddle of mutton ; roast it with the rind on. When sending it to table, remove the crackling, and serve with tomata-sauce. LOIN AND NECK OF PORK 193. —May be roasted and served with the same accompani- ments as a porker. Or :—Simmer the best end of either of the joints till nearly fit for the table, strip off the skin, put it into a cradle-spit, wet

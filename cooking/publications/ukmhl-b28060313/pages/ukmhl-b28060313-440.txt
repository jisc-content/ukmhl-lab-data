BEIGNET. 534.—Mix and work well together £ lb. of flour and 2 oz. of butter, or 3 tablespoonfuls of sweet oil, and make it into a batter with some warm water; then mix into the batter a couple of raw eggs, keeping the yolk of 1 for browning. The materials may thus be made of any degree of consistence, so as to act as thick batter, or as thin paste by the addition of a little flour; and being made into small balls, are spread with the remaining yolk of egg, powdered usually with sugar, and fried in hot lard; and, when ready to be served, put them for a moment on a hair sieve, to drain off the fat. If made solely with paste, without mince of any kind, they should have another egg, and the batter be more continually beaten, so as to render the beignets light; then, when prepared for dressing, take a spoonful of the batter formed into a ball, and drop it into the boiling lard. A large dishful will be fried in 6 or 7 minutes.

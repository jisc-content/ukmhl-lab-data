MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVIII. 344 hot. In India a portion of the vegetables is taken from each dish, chopped up while hot with pepper and salt, and put into a silver saucepan, with a piece of butter; and, when well heated over a lamp, sent round the table. A VEGETABLE OLIO. 430. —Boil 3 heads of small, close cabbage, carrots, turnips, potatoes, and small onions; drain them from the water, and cut them in pieces. Mix all with 2 handfuls of spinach- leaves, 2 oz. of butter, 3 spoonfuls of cream, a little salt and pepper, and stew them as closely covered as possible 2 hours; then stir in a bit of butter rolled in dour, over a clear fire. In summer, peas, cucumbers, spinach, celery, lettuces, and young onions may be dressed the same way. BRED IC OF VEGETABLES (a Dutch disk).—E. R. 431. —Brown 4 or 6 onions sliced and chopped in a little butter, then add different kinds of vegetables chopped, which have been previously boiled; stew them all together, stirring the whole time. When half done, add a few tomatas sliced, with chilis also sliced, and salt to the taste ; moisten if neces- sary with gravy, and either add a glassful of vinegar or a handful of sorrel. VEGETABLE CURRY.—E. R. 432. —Put 2 oz. of butter into a stewpan, then roll celery, onions, and broccoli in curry-powder, and stew them until tender; add a cupful of good gravy, a small quantity of mashed potatoes mixed up with curry-powder, and salt. Stew the whole together until sufficiently done. Or:—Take broccoli, cauliflower, or any other vegetable, and boil it in water until tender; then throw out the water, cut them in rather large pieces, and add either shrimps, prawns, or any minced meat, if you think proper to make such an addition; or if not, then put some fried onions with a bit of butter, a pint of water, and the usual quantity of rice and curry-powder; stew all together and add lemon-juice to the taste. If the materials be well chosen, it will be found very delicate.

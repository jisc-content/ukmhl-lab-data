Chap. XVII.] GRAVY, SAUCES, AND CURRY. 285 to see that it does not burn or stick to the bottom. It will generally be browned sufficiently in i an hour. If kept in a very cool place and covered closely in a stone jar, it will keep good for 2 or 3 days in summer, and more than a week in winter, but should not be thickened until it is meant to be used. Tarragon and knotted marjoram, by some called “London thyme,” are a great improvement to gravies, as also all those condiments enumerated in the chapter on soups, but should be added only a short time before serving. Truffles and morels also thicken and improve the flavour of gravies and soups : i oz. being carefully washed of each, simmer them in a pint of water, and add the whole. In the preparation of large dinners for company, it is indis- pensable to procure strong gravy to colour and impart flavour to sauces and ragouts, and this can be done by using coarse pieces of the lean of beef or veal, and the giblets or trimmings of poultry and game, with a small portion of a knuckle of ham; but for this purpose it must be stewed for a long time, skimmed, strained, thickened, and afterwards flavoured with whatever condiments are most suited to the dish it is to accompany. STOCK FOR GRAVY. 304.—A good mode of making stock for gravies is to cut lean beef thin, put it into a gravy pot without any butter or fat, and set it on a fire covered, but take care it does not burn; let it stay till all the gravy that comes out of the meat is dried up into it again, often shaking it; put as much water as will cover the meat, and let that stew away. Then put to the meat a small quantity of water, herbs, onions, spice, and a bit of lean ham; simmer till it is rich, and keep it in a cool place. Do not take off the fat till going to be used. Or, an excellent stock may be made in this manner:—Put into a casserole 3 oz. of butter, 4 large carrots, 6 middling Gravy Pot.

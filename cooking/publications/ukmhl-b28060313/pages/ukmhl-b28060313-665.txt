Oil of amber (the foreign is the best) to be rubbed every night at bedtime on the palm of the hands, the soles of the feet, the small of the back, and the pit of the stomach. The oil, if good, is so essential that 4 a teaspoonful is enough for a child at one time of rubbing. Or:—A dozen cloves of garlic steeped in •§ pint of rum for 24 hours : rub a dessertspoonful over the pit of the stomach at bedtime. This has been found of great benefit.

PREFACE. IV of common cooks, as well as too expensive for the greater number of private families. It has, therefore, been thought advisable to confine this work to a collection of plain and useful receipts, the result of experience and practice, adapted for those families of moderate fortune in which a certain degree of elegance is combined with attention to domestic economy. The number of editionsa which Mrs. Rundell’s celebrated work has passed through is the best test of its utility ; and it is confidently expected that the number and value of the additional receipts and precepts which are contained in this will place it still higher in public estimation. Among the novel features in this volume as now offered to the public may be mentioned—1. the great increase in the number and variety of receipts, set forth in a clearer type than before; 2. a greater simplification of language in order to render the receipts more easy of comprehension ; 3. the illus- trative woodcuts which adorn the present volume; 4. the new system of numbering every separate receipt to facilitate reference; 5. the mode of printing in figures all numbers and quantities for the sake of clearness; and 6. the Tables for computing household accounts. All these improvements will, it is hoped, contribute much to the utility of the work and to facilitate the use of it. a Upwards of 200,000 copies have been sold.

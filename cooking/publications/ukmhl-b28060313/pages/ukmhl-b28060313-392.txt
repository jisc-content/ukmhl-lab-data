360 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIX. Eggs for Turtle.—Beat 3 hard yolks of eggs in a mortar, and make into a paste with the yolk of a raw one; roll it into small balls, and throw them into boiling water for 2 minutes to harden. Though formerly much used, they have latterly gone out of fashion. PASSOVER BALLS FOR SOUP.—E. R. 457.—Chop an onion and i lb. of suet very finely; stew them together until the suet is melted, then pour it hot upon 8 spoonfuls of biscuit-flour; mix it well together; add a little salt, a little grated nutmeg, lemon-peel, and ginger, and 6 eggs. Put the balls into the soup when it boils, and boil them for i of an hour. The quantity of eggs and flour may appear disproportioned, but the flour employed is of a peculiar kind, used for the purpose in Jewish families. Nothing can exceed the excellence of the balls made after this receipt: they are applicable to any kind of soups.

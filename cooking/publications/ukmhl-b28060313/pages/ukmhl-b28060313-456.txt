424 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXII. breast of house-lamb is one of the most delicate things that can be eaten. It should be very lightly seasoned with pepper and salt, the bone taken out, but not the gristles; cover it with puff paste, and put in a small quantity of jelly gravy hot. SQUAB PIE 560. —Is a favourite dish throughout Devonshire and Corn- * wall, and is there generally made of mutton. It is made thus: Cut apples as for other pies, and lay them in rows with mutton chops and shred onion ; sprinkle with pepper and salt, and also some sugar. Bake the pie in a deep dish, cover it with a thick crust, and eat it hot; it must be well done, and will take 2 to 3 hours baking. In the midland counties it is usually made of beef cut into dice, with some lean bacon seasoned and mixed with the apples. POTATO PIE. 561. —Have a tin dish (as in the cut), take out the plate, lay pieces of meat at the bottom of the dish, seasoned with pepper and salt, and a little water. Re- place the plate, which is perfo- rated with holes, fill up the dish to the handles of the centre pillar with mashed potatoes; bake it; when put on table, lift up the plate of potatoes, which will have received all the flavour of the Potato-pie Dish. baked meat. VENISON PASTY. 562. —The neck, breast, and shoulder are the only parts of the deer used in this country for a pasty ; and even the neck is more generally roasted. A shoulder and breast, boned, make a good pasty ; but, the shoulder being sinewy, it will be of advantage to rub it well with sugar for 2 or 3 days ; and when used wipe it per- fectly clean. A mistake used to prevail that venison could not be baked too much ; but 3 or 4 hours in a slow oven will be sufficient to make it tender, and the flavour will be preserved. Cut the venison in pieces; put it into a stewpan with a little port wine, 2 shalots, an onion, bay-leaf, faggot of parsley

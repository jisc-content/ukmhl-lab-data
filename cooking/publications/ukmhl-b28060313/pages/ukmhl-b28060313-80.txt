MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. IY. 48 Four tablespoonfuls, or half a gill, will fill a common wine-glass. Four wine-glasses will fill a half-pint or common tumbler, or a large coffee-cup. A quart black bottle holds in reality about a pint and a half. Of flour, butter, sugar, and most articles used in cakes and pastry, a quart is generally about equal in quantity to a pound avoirdupois (sixteen ounces). Avoirdupois is the weight designated throughout this book. Ten eggs generally weigh one pound before they are broken. A tablespoonful of salt or brown sugar is generally about one ounce. Sieves, of various descriptions, are very essential. Every utensil for cookery should be of various sizes, so as to suit the quantity of which the dishes may be composed; and each should be kept in a fixed place, as well as washed and dried immediately after using. The cook should also be charged to take care of jelly-bags, tapes for the collared things, &c., which, if not perfectly scalded and kept dry, give an un- pleasant flavour when next used.

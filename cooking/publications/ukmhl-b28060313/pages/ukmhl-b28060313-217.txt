Chap. XII.] PORK, 185 CHAPTER XII. PORK. Tnis meat requires to be very well roasted, is never boiled unless salted, and in every form should be thoroughly cooked. | It is not the fashion to stuff it, as heretofore, with sage and j onions, the meat frequently disagreeing with delicate persons without the addition of so strong an adjunct, but it forms a i very savoury addition. A part of the objection may be re- | moved by boiling the sage and onions, and mixmg them with bread-crumbs and a chopped apple ; and if thus prepared, the stuffing will be found mild, and of excellent flavour.

If you kill a young pig of 4 or 5 months, take off the skin I of the fore quarter, roast it, ancl serve with mint-sauce and I salad.

When quite clean, wasli it well with warm water, and then in 2 or 3 cold waters,

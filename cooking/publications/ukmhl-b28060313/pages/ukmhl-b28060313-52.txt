MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. II. 20 esteem, the little animals are usually killed at a few weeks old, and are then roasted whole. Pork.—In helping the roast loin and leg, your knife must follow the direction of the scores cut by the cook upon the skin which forms the crackling, as it is too crisp for being conveniently divided, and cannot therefore be cut across the bones of the ribs, as in loin of mutton. The scores upon the roasted leg are, however, always marked too broadly for single cuts ; the crackling must therefore be lifted up from the back to allow of thin slices being cut from the meat: the seasoning is under the skin at the larger end. Ham.—Serve it with the back upwards, sometimes orna- mented, and generally having, as in France, the shank-bone c covered with cut paper.

The first slice should be wedge-shaped, that all the others may be cut slanting, which gives a handsome ap- pearance to them. Many persons, however, prefer the hock at d, as having more flavour; it is then carved lengthwise from c to d. Hoiled Tongue should always be cut crosswise, not going through to the fat, which, if required, can be cut by putting the knife under.

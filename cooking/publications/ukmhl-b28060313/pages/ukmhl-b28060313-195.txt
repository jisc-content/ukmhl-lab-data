Chap. XT.] VEAL. 163 CHAPTER XI. VEAL. Directions for choosing veal have already been given. To keep it, we have to observe—the first part that turns bad of a leg of veal is where the udder is skewered back. The skewer should be taken out, and both that and the whole of the meat wiped every day; by which means it will keep good 3 or 4 days in hot weather, if the larder be a g'ood one. Take care to cut out the pipe that runs along the chine of a loin, as you do of beef, to hinder it from tainting. The skirt of the breast is likewise to be taken off, and the inside wiped and scraped, and sprinkled with a little salt.

FILLET OF VEAL ROASTED. 153.—Take out the bone, fill the space with a fine stuffing, and let the fat be skewered quite round; stuff it also well under the skin—as much depends on the quantity and flavour of the stuffing—and send the large side uppermost. Put a paper over the fat; and take care to allow a sufficient time for roasting ; put it a good distance from the fire, as the meat is very solid, and must be so thoroughly done as not to leave the least appear- ance of red gravy ; serve it with melted butter poured over, and gravy round. Ham or bacon should be served witli it, and fresh cucumbers if in season. Although considered very indigestible, it is a favourite joint in England, where it is generally roasted, although it may be m 2

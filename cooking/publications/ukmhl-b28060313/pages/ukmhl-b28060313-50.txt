18 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. IE Should it be intended to reserve a portion of the joint to be eaten cold, all this undermost part should be first cut away and served separately, both as it eats better hot than cold, and as the upper remaining part will appear more sightly on the table. Loin of Mutton.—Cut the joints into chops and serve them separately ; or cut slices the whole length of the loin; or run the knife along the chine-bone, and then slice it, the fat and lean together, as shown in the cut of the saddle, below. Neck of Mutton.—It should be prepared for table as follows :—Cut otf the scrag ; have the chine-bone carefully sawn off, and also the top of the long bones (about 1C inch), and the thin part turned under; carve in the direction of the bones. The scrag of mutton, when roasted, is very frequently sepa- rated from the ribs of the neck, and in that case the meat and bones may be helped together. Saddle of Mutton.—Cut in long and rather thin slices from the tail to the end, beginning at each side close to the back- bone, from a to b, with slices of fat from c to d; or along the bone which divides the two loins, so as to loosen from it the whole of the meat from that side, which you then cut crosswise, thus giv- Saddle of Mutton. mg with each slice both fat and lean. The tail end is usually divided and partly turned up. Some butchers also skewer the kidneys across the incision, but it is not usual at genteel tables, and the inci- sion is better omitted. Haunch of Mutton.—A haunch is the leg and part of the loin, and is cut in the same manner as a haunch ol venison. Fore- Quarter of Lamb.—Pass the knife under the shoulder in the direction of a, c, b, d, so as to separate it from the ribs- without cutting the meat too much off the bones. A Seville orange or lemon should then be divided, the halves sprinkled with salt and pepper, and the juice squeezed over the under part.

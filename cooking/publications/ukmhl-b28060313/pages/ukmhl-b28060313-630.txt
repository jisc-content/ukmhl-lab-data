598 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIX. It is always made very thick, so that a small spoon will nearly stand upright in it, and nothing eaten with it but a rusk, or dry toast: after which there is usually taken a draught of cold spring water. The usual mode of making it is to boil a pint of water in the pot, put to it a cake of chocolate cut into very small slices, mill it off the fire till quite melted, then put it on a gentle fire till it nearly boils, milling it all the time. Pour it into a basin, and it will keep in a cool place for several days. When used put a couple of tablespoonfuls of it into milk, warm it with sugar, and mill it well. COCOA. 823.—An excellent breakfast beverage may be made by simply pounding the nut—which is the substance of choco- late—and boiling it in the same manner in either water or milk. The best quality is that of Cctraccas, which is small, very dark-coloured, and appears as if partly mouldy or broken ; while that usually to be found in the shops is plump and glossy, and the patent sort, or paste, still more inferior; it being always made from the cheapest kind, and not unfre- quently from that which has been damaged. Cocoa Shells or Nibs, or, as they are more appropriately called in Ireland, “ Miserable,” are the thin coverings of the cocoa kernel, and can only be had at some chocolate manu- factory, where they can be bought at a very low price, and form a light food for an invalid, when taken warm. Soak them in water during the whole night, and then boil them in the same water until reduced to i the quantity: they should boil 2 hours, and should then be mixed up with milk.

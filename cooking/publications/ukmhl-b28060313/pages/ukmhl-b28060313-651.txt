It may be necessary to premise that a choice should be made of those things most likely to agree with the patient, and, as invalids require variety to indulge their appetite, fre- quent changes should be provided, but great simplicity ob- served in the preparation. Perhaps jellies and meat broths, together with various kinds of farinaceous food, are the lightest on the stomach, as well as, generally speaking, the most nutritious. JELLIES. 860.—A good Jelly.—Soak 12 shanks of mutton 4 hours, then brush and scour them very clean. Lay them in a saucepan with 3 blades of mace, an onion, 20 Jamaica and 30 or 40 black peppers, a bunch of sweet herbs, and a crust of bread made very brown by toasting. Pour 3 quarts of water to them, and set them on a hot hearth close covered ; let them simmer as gently as possible for 5 hours, then strain it off, and put it in a cold place. This may have the addition of a pound of beef, if approved, for flavour. It is a remarkably good thing for people who are weak. Sheep’s heads and trotters are also good restoratives; savoury jelly may also be made in the same manner, without lemon, wine, or sugar, but flavoured with ham and spice. Dr. Ratcliffe's Pork Jelly.—Take a leg of well-fed pork, just as cut up; beat it, and break the bone. Set it over a gentle fire with 3 gallons of water,, and simmer to 1. Let i oz. of mace and the same of nutmegs stew in it. Strain through a fine sieve. When cold, take off the fat. Give a chocolatecupful the first and last thing, and at noon, putting salt to taste.

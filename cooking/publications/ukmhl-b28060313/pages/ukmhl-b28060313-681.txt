In large dinners, 2 Soups top and bottom and 2 dishes of Fish. The entrees, or corner dishes, for the first course, should be small, and those which can be dressed in a crown, like cote- lcttes or fillets of various kinds, are preferable; they should not require carving. For this reason, chickens, vol-au-vents, or such like, should be served for “ flancs.” When the dinner admits only of 4 entrees, 2 should be light and 2 solid ; the latter may be made to look light by being carried to a height corresponding to their breadth.

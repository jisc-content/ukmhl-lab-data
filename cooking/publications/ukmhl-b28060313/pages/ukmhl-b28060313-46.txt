Necessity of Practice in Carving — Beep : Bound or Aitch-bone — Ribs — Sirloin. — Veal : Fillet — Neck — Loin — Breast — Shoulder — Calfs Head.—Mutton : Leg — Shoulder — Loin—Neck—Saddle — Haunch. — Fore-quarter of Lamb. — Venison : Haunch — Neck. — Roebuck — Kid — Pork — Ham — Tongue — Sucking Pig — Hare — Rabbit — Winged Game and Poultry — Fish. Although carving with ease and elegance is a very neces- sary accomplishment, yet most people are lamentably deficient not only in the art of dissecting winged game and poultry, but also in the important point of knowing the parts most generally esteemed. Practice only can make good carvers; but the directions here given, with accompanying plates, will enable any one to disjoint a fowl and avoid the awkwardness of disfiguring a joint. In the first place, whatever is to be carved should be set in a dish sufficiently large for turning it if necessary ; but the dish itself should not be moved from its position, which should be so close before the carver as only to leave room for the plates. The carving-knife should be light, sharp, well- tempered, and of a size proportioned to the joint, strength being less required than address in the manner of using it. Large solid joints, such as ham, fillet of veal, and salt beef, cannot be cut too thin ; but mutton, roast pork, and the other joints of veal, should never be served in very slender slices. A Round (buttock) or Aitch-bone of Beef.—Pare off from the upper part, of either, a slice from the whole sur- face, of about h an inch thick, and put it aside; then cut thin slices of both lean and fat, in the direc- tion from a to b. The soft fat, which resembles marrow, lies at the back of the aitch-bone, below c, Aitch-bone of-Beef.

41 Chap. III.] FOOD AND COOKERY. Tongues, palates, &c., are said to be blanched, when, after long boiling, the skin can be peeled otf; and the latter will become thicker by being put into cold water afterwards. To keep meat hot, it is best to take it up when done, though the company may not be come; set the dish over a pan of boiling water, or in the bain-marie, as described in Chapter IV., on Culinary Utensils; else, put a deep tin cover over it so as not to touch the meat, and then throw a cloth over that. This way dries the gravy less than hot hearths of iron; but in whatever way the heat be preserved, it is a very essential article in serving a dinner, and every requisite should be allowed for the purpose. The most effectual way is in a warm closet, which is now made so as to be heated by the steam from the boiler attached to most kitchen ranges.

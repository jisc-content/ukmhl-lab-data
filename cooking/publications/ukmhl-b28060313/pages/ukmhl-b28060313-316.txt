284 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVII. CHAPTER XVII. GRAVY, SAUCES, AND CURRY. There is nothing that requires more attention on the part of the cook than the sauces which are wanted to all made dishes ; and those who are clever and economical will always contrive to procure the basis of these sauces in the manner pointed out in various parts of this volume. Where a calf’s head or a breast of veal is stewed, nothing more will be required, as both will yield an abundant supply, and it will only be necessary to give it the proper flavour with ham, or beef-bone, and ketchup. GRAVY May be made quite as good of the skirts of beef, kidney, or milt, or of the liver of a fat ox, as of any other kind of meat, if cut in pieces, fried with onions, and seasoned with herbs and spices, as other gravies. A clever servant will contrive to supply, at a trifling expense, as much gravy as is wanted for the use of a small family by stewing down the trimmings of meat and bones. It may even be made of the shank-bones of legs and shoulders of mutton: they should be thrown into water, and, after a good soaking and brushing, be long boiled. The water in which they are done will add greatly to the richness of gravy, as does the jelly of cow-heels. The latter must lie all night in water, which causes the jelly to be of a good colour. When boiled 3 hours, and become cold, let the fat be carefully taken off; and when apparently quite clear, lay some white paper upon it, rubbing it close with a spoon, which will remove every particle of grease, and it will be as pure as the jelly of a calf’s foot. In preparing meat to stew for gravy, beat it witli a mallet or rolling-pin, and score it across in various places, as this will make it give out its juices; season it with pepper and salt, and put it into a stewpan with butter only, heating it gradu- ally until it becomes brown, but shaking the pan frequently

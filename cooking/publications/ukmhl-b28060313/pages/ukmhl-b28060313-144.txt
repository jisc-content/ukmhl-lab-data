112 MODERN" DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VIII. CHAPTER VIII. BEEF. Beef is dressed in various ways all the year round ; but, for roasting, the best season is from November to the end of March. For joints, the only really good roasting pieces are the sir- loin and the long ribs; the short ribs, which are cut near the neck, never roast well, and should not be used for this pur- pose ; the middle ribs are the best. The under part, or fillet, of the sirloin, if cut out, may be made into a delicious stew; or, if cut crosswise into steaks, they will be found more tender than those of the rump. Some persons divide the round, and roast the half called the upper side, which in young beef is tender and full of gravy. The silver side should be salted, being one of the best boiling pieces in the ox. The aitch-bone, although almost invariably salted and boiled, yet, if roasted when fresh, makes perhaps the richest gravy of any part of the ox; but, when cold, is not so good as if salted. Beef requires to be hung a long time, in order to ensure its being tender. When, however, the weather is not favourable for keeping, it will be much improved by being laid for a few hours previous to roasting in a marinade of this kind—three parts water to one of vinegar, some salt, with a few pepper- corns. Each joint must be carefully examined before it is spitted, and any portions that may have been injured cut away. In Scotland, meat of every sort is preserved by covering it completely with oatmeal, taking it out every day, wiping it, and then replacing it in the meal; and should it appear at all tainted, it is soaked for some hours in oatmeal and water before being dressed: or strewing over it some coarsely-powdered charcoal will materially assist in its preservation.

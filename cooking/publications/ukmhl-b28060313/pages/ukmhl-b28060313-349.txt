VEGETABLES. 376.—The fresher all green vegetables are used after being taken from the ground the better ; and therefore nothing can be comparable to cutting them from your own garden ; but, when purchased in the market, care should be taken that those of the cabbage tribe should appear crisp and vividly green : not too small, nor yet overgrown in size. When about to be used, the outer leaves should be stripped, the stalks cut short, and the vegetable immersed for an hour or two in cold water, into which should be put a handful of salt, for the purpose of thoroughly cleansing it from slugs, and those insects with which the leaves are commonly infested. All green vegetables should be put into boiling water. Never boil any species of greens with meat. Boil them in plenty of pure water, with salt, to which a little vinegar may be added ■with advantage; do not cover the saucepan, but keep up a steady fire, so that they shall not be allowed to stop boiling until thoroughly done : drain them instantly, for if Overboiled they lose their flavour and become insipid ; they should be well done, for, if that be neglected for the pur- pose of preserving their crispness, they will be rendered indigestible. Hard water spoils the colour of such vegetables as should be green, but a very small bit of soda or carbonate of ammonia will soften it, and even improve their brightness. The prac- tice of putting pearlash in the pot, to improve their colour, should be strictly forbidden, as it imparts an unpleasant flavour; as will also soda if not cautiously used.

HINDOSTANEE KUWAB FOWL.—E. R. 375. —Rub smooth in a mortar tr oz. of coriander-seed, 3 onions, a drachm of red pepper, the same of pounded ginger, and 4 cloves. Put 4 oz. of salt butter on the fire in a stewpan. Rub a fowl inside and outside with the pounded ingredients; truss it nicely; put it into the butter, and fry it a fine brown, turning it continually. This is a sort of salamander very ac- ceptable to the lovers of fiery dishes: it should be eaten with lemon-juice squeezed over it.

INFANT’S FOOD. 1ST by boiling. As the teeth come, animal and vegetable food may be gradually added in small quantities, but the diet of young children should consist chiefly of milk and eggs, either taken separately or made into puddings with semolina, rice, arrowroot, etc. (see page no). . It must be understood that the foregoing remarks are quite general in their nature, and subject to mocli- fication for even healthy infants. The patent foods suit some children; a little beef-tea before weaning agrees well with others. Warning.—Mothers cannot be too strongly warned against giving infants either spirituous liquors or opiates—that is, soothing syrups, etc. Spirituous liquors cause inflammation of the coats of the stomach, and lay the foundation of many diseases in afterlife. Opiates injure the nervous system, make the child nervous and irritable, and hurt digestion. All soothing powders contain opium (even Dalby’s Carminative), and should only be used when ordered by a doctor.

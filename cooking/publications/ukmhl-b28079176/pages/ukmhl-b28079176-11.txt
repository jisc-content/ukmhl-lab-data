9 THE MATERIALS OF FOOD. CHAPTER I. THE MATERIALS OF FOOD. Before learning the principles of Cookery, it is impor- tant to know something about the composition of the different kinds of food, in order to choose those that are best fitted to keep the body in health and vigour. For this purpose let us consider one or two of our most important foods. Milk is the most perfect human food that we have; infants live on it alone. We find that if milk stands for a little, the cream or fatty part separates and rises to the top, leaving the skim milk below. The cream is the principal part which gives warmth, but it does not repair the used-up materials of the body. The skim milk does this. Skim milk can be separated into curd and whey. Curd is, strictly speaking, the flesh- forming part: whey supplies water, sugar, and mineral substances. Bread is another very important kind of food. If we take a little of the flour of which it is made, tie it in a cloth and squeeze it in cold water, we shall find that a milky or cloudy liquor will be formed in the water. The same can be got out of various grains, especially rice; also out of potatoes, arrowroot, tapioca and sago. This milky appearance is caused by starch, another of the materials which will keep up heat, but will not form flesh. Inside of the cloth there will be found a grey sticky or glutinous paste, which will be spoken of presently. Sugar also is an important agent in producing and keeping up warmth. These three substances—fats, starch, and sugar—may therefore be named—

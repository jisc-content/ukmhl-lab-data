EGGS. 126 The omelet will be larger and lighter if a third white can be allowed to the two yolks. A savoury omelet may be made by adding half a teaspoonful of mixed herbs or chopped parsley to the yolks instead ot sugar. An omelet pari should not be washed • it should be scraped and dry rubbed. Pancakes.—Required: 2 oz. flour ; 1 egg ; 2 oz. clarified fat; 1 gill milk; 2 oz. sugar ; 1 small pinch of salt. 1 Put the flour and salt in a basin ; add the egg and stir well with a wooden spoon ; then pour in the milk gradually, stirring all the time, being careful to have no lumps in the batter. Put two and a half table- spoonfuls of the batter in a cup ; melt a fourth of the fat in a small frying pan. When hot pour in the batter from the cup, holding the pan so that the batter should cover the whole of it. Let the pancake set, then with a knife see that it does not stick anywhere. Shake it a little and either toss it over or turn with a long thin knife. When a golden brown on both sides put it on a plate, dredge with sugar, fold the pancake in three, or roll it up and dredge again with sugar. Serve very hot. The above quantities will make about four pancakes. When time permits prepare the batter some hours before, as it is improved by standing. If preferred, pancakes may be made a little lighter by adding only the yolk at first to the flour, &c.; then add the milk as directed Whisk the whites to a stiff froth, just before the pancakes are to be cooked, and add lightly. A few drops of lemon juice squeezed over each pancake is a great improvement. Snow Eggs.—Required: 1 egg; 1% gills of milk ; inch stick cinnamon ; 1 heaped teaspoonful sugar.

SAUCES. 127 Break the egg; separate the yolk from the white. Put the milk, cinnamon, and sugar into a small pan (enamelled preferred). While this is coming to the boil beat the white with a knife on a dry plate to a very stiff froth. Dip a tablespoon in cold water, scoop out the froth in spoonfuls and drop into the boiling milk ; boil slowly for three minutes, tuna the froth over, and cook the other side for three minutes. Put this snow on a cloth to drain. Stir the yolk in a cup with a spoon until it is creamy; add gradually the milk slightly cooled ; remove the cinnamon. Put the milk and egg back into the saucepan, and stir always one way over a slow fire till it thickens, but it must not boil. Pour this custard into a shallow dish and when cold place the snow upon it. XXII.—SAUCES. Melted Butter.—Required: 1 oz. flour; 1 oz. butter ; pint cold water; 1 pinch of salt.

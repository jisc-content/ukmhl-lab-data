BREAD, ETC. 133 inch of thickness. Cut into neat pieces, bake on a girdle; when cooked on one side, turn them. In kneading, you must be careful to take up the oatmeal gradually, as, if it be added too quickly, there will be lumps of dry oatmeal found in the scones. A girdle before using should first be put on the fire till it is very hot; then have it raised up from the fire while you are baking on it; this prevents the scones from being burned. Flour may be used instead of oat- meal. Soda Scones.—Required: y2 lb. flour; ^ of a small teaspoonful carbonate of soda; x/2 teaspoonful cream of tartar; nearly ]/2 pint butter milk ; y tea- spoonful salt.

Bake them on a tin in a hot oven for about five minutes. When they are risen and the surface is smooth, turn and cook for five minutes longer. They should be a very pale colour. Or put them on a hot girdle and cook first on one side and then on the other, as in the oven. Serve hot or cold. Sugar may be used instead of salt, and they may be made richer by rubbing 1 oz. butter or dripping into the flour before the butter milk is added. Dropped Scones.-—Dropped scones are made with the same materials as soda scones, except that about a pint of butter milk is used instead of half a pint, as the batter must be thin like pancake mixture. Grease the hot girdle with a little dripping or suet. Pour the batter in tablespoonfuls on the girdle, keep- ing each well separated; when slightly firm and little

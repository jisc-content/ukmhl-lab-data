38 GENERAL DIRECTIONS—ROASTING. Turnips.—Wash and brush well in cold water. Pare thickly, so far as a line a little in from the skin. The part next the skin is stringy, indigestible, and bitter. Cut up in the way directed for carrots, and lay in water till required. Onions.—Skin. Before onions are cooked, they must be “ prepared ” in the following way, to make them digestible :—Place them in a basin, cover them with boiling water, and add a piece of washing soda, the size of a pea. In about a quarter of an hour the water will become quite green. Pour this away. If the onions are to be used for soup, cut them in four, downwards, and then into small pieces ; if they are to be fried, cut them into thin slices, and dry them well. French Beans.—Remove the strings from each side; cut each bean slanting into two or three pieces. Place in water till required. Spinach.—Wash well in cold water. Double each leaf together, and tear off the stalk with its continua- tion down the back of each leaf. VI.—GENERAL DIRECTIONS. Roasting. Meat for roasting should be kept hanging till the fibre becomes tender. The length of time required depends on the state of the weather and the season, ranging from a few days, or, in summer even a few hours, to three or four weeks in a dry cold winter. In frosty weather the meat must be brought into the kitchen for a few hours, before using it, to soften it. To ascertain the length of time required for roasting, weigh rhe Treat and allow in roasting one quarter of an hour Co each pound and one quarter of an hour

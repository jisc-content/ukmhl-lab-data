THE SCHOOL COOKERY BOOK. PART I. THEORETICAL. INTRODUCTION. Motion and warmth are two essential conditions of the life of human beings. Even when the body seems to be quite still, movement is going on in every part of it. The blood is constantly being pumped by the heart, and carried to all parts of the body; the lungs move with every breath ; a change is caused in the brain by every thought. To produce movement, either external or internal, some force or exertion (not necessarily voluntary) is used, and all force involves wear and tear. This wear and tear takes place in the flesh and blood, the fat and bones, and other materials of which the body is composed. If these used-up materials are not replaced, the body will wear away, and the animal become exhausted and die. All living human bodies are warm.1 If the warmth 1 The temperature of th6 human body is about 98° Fahr., and in healthy persons is nearly uniform both in hot and in cold weather. Thermometers, instruments formeasuringheat, have been constructed by various persons : the one made by Fahrenheit is in most general use. Freezing point is 320 (° means degrees); temperate, 55°; summer heat, 76°; blood heat, 98°; boiling point (water), 213°.

40 GENERAL DIRECTIONS—BROILING. gravy left in the pan, mix well, add a little salt, and pour round the roast. Roasting in the Oven.—This is usually called baking meat. Place the meat in a baking tin in a very hot part of the oven for five minutes to harden the outside and keep in the juice. Baste it as soon as the fat melts; then remove it to a cooler part; place beside it a cup or basin of hot water to keep the air of the oven moist without cooling it. Baste the meat frequently. For the length of time required, see preceding directions. All ovens in which meat is cooked should be properly ventilated in order to allow the escape of an injurious vapour produced by meat when cooked in a close oven. Meat roasted in the oven is not considered so digestible as when roasted before the fire. Roasting in the Pan.—Melt and heat i oz. of dripping in an iron pan.1 Brown all sides of the meat in this, so as to harden the outside and keep in the juices. Then draw the pan aside, and let the meat cook slowly with the lid on, basting it constantly. For the length of time required, see preceding direc- tions. This way of roasting is especially suitable for small pieces of meat, and is economical because of the small quantity of fuel required. Broiling. Broiling is cooking over a hot clear fire on a gridiron. Place a thoroughly clean gridiron over the fire; let it become quite hot, as the hot metal will help to harden the outside of the meat, and so keep in the juices ; rub the gridiron with suet to prevent the meat sticking to it. Place the meat on the hot gridiron, turn it 1 Tinning is apt to melt with the great heat and small amount of moisture.

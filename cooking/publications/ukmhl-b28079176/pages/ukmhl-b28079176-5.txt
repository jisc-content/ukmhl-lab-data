PREFACE. This “ School Cookery Book ” has been written chiefly for the use of cookery classes in elementary schools. The theory of food is therefore explained in simple language, the recipes are given in small quantities, and the directions are very minute. It is hoped, however, that the book may prove useful also to others who desire to study the theory and practice of good economical cookery. The text is complete without the footnotes, which are inserted for the benefit of teachers and older people. The theoretical part has been submitted to, and approved by, an eminent chemist and two physicians. The Editor desires to express her obligation to Sir Thomas D. Acland, Bart., M.P., for valuable criticisms and suggestions.

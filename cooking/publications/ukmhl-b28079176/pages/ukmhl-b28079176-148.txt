Mustard Poultice.—Required: dry mustard; cold water. Mix enough cold water thoroughly with the mustard to make it into a thick paste ; continue to stir for two or three minutes. Spread it upon a piece of cotton. Cover the side to be applied to the patient with a piece of pocket handkerchief, or washed cotton or muslin; fold down the edges and tack them with a needle and thread to prevent the mustard escaping. To prevent the poultice chilling the patient, hold it for a few seconds to the fire, or put it on a heated plate. Be careful not to make the poultice larger than neces- sary. A mustard poultice is generally kept on from ten to twenty minutes. When it is taken off, a piece of clean wadding should be placed on the skin, or a piece of soft cotton, or flour should be dredged over the part, and a piece of soft cotton spread over it. Bread and Milk Poultice.—Required: stale bread; cold milk.

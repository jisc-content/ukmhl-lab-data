MEAT—BOILING. 67 thoroughly, removing the tender gristle from the nostril. Tie the head together; put the head and pluck, including half of the liver, into a pan; cover them with boiling water; simmer till quite tender about two hours. Remove the head and pluck (pre- serving the liquor to make soup); cover the head with bread-crumbs. Place 1 oz, of dripping in small pieces over the head, and brown it before the fire or in the oven. Mince the heart, half of the lights, and half of the liver; stew this for twenty minutes*with 1 pint of the liquor the head has been boiled in, the pepper and salt, and the flour broken with a little cold water. Cut the uncooked half of liver into neat pieces, heat the 2 oz. of dripping in a frying-pan, and fry the pieces, taking care not to cook so long as to make them hard. Place the head in the centre of a dish ; arrange the stewed mince round it; on the mince place fried liver and brain cakes alternately. Brain Cakes.—Required: brains ; 2 heaped table- spoonfuls bread-crumbs ; 1 teaspoonful chopped pars- ley ; 1 oz. dripping; 1 tablespoonful milk; 1 table- spoonful vinegar; 1 pint cold water; 1 pinch salt; 1 pinch pepper. Wash the brains in vinegar and cold water, then put them into the boiling liquor the head is cooking in; boil for ten minutes, drain, chop, and put them into a basin with the bread-crumbs, parsley, pepper, salt, and enough milk to make them into a moist paste; drop this paste in spoonfuls into a little of the hot dripping; fry till a golden colour. Brain cakes are much improved by having a beaten egg added to the mixture, or else by being egged and bread-crumbed before frying, like fish (page 58). If egged and bread-crumbed, they must be fried in plenty of fat.

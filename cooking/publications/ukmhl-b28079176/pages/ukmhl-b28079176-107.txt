Spread one piece of the dripping over the paste, fold up the paste, and roll it out. Turn the side of the paste towards you, then spread the second piece of dripping in the same manner, fold up the paste, and roll out again. Do the same with the remaining piece of dripping, roll out the paste, and fold it again several times till the patches of dripping are no more seen. The crust is now ready for covering a pie.

CHEAP DISHES WITHOUT MEAT. 91 Sweet Rice Croquettes.—Required: 1 teacup- ful of rice; % lb- bread crumbs ; 2 oz. sugar ; a small piece of lemon-rind; 1 pint milk; 1 egg; frying fat. Wash the rice well; put it into a small saucepan; cover with cold water, and bring to the boil. _ When the water has been absorbed, add the lemon-rind and pour in the milk by degrees; simmer till quite soft and almost dry, stirring the rice very often. Add the sugar; mix well; remove the lemon-rind; put the mixture on a plate to cool. Flour a corner of a board or table ; form the rice into small shapes, and roll each in flour. When all the shapes are ready, break the egg on a plate, beat it with a fork; brush each piece with the egg; cover with bread crumbs; fry. When sufficiently cooked, place them on paper to dry; then pile them on a dish, dredging them over with white sugar. Savoury Rice Croquettes.—These are made in the same way as sweet croquettes, only the rice is cooked in water or stock instead of milk, and grated cheese or onions boiled and chopped added in place of sugar. Savoury Potatoes. — Required: x lb. boiled potatoes; i}4 oz. grated cheese; 1 oz. dripping or butter; 1 gill cold milk; ^ teaspoonful salt; 1 pinch pepper. Mash the potatoes (cold potatoes will do) till no lumps remain. Add the salt, pepper, milk, and half of the cheese; mix well. Place the potatoes smoothly in a small greased pie dish, sprinkle the remaining cheese on the top, also the dripping in small pieces; bake in a brisk oven or before the fire for a few minutes till it is a golden colour. If it is possible to add on the top a little gravy from any roast meat, it will be found an improvement. Serve very hot.

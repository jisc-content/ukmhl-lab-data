MEAT-STEWING. 70 hour before serving, add the salt, pepper, and ketchup. Serve hot and garnish with small pieces of toast. Stewed Beef.—Required: lb. stewing beef; y carrot; turnip; x onion ; i oz. dripping; i pint warm water; oz. flour; i dessert spoonful of ketchup; y teaspoonful salt; i pinch pepper. Cleanse, prepare, and slice the carrot and turnip; skin, scald, and slice the onion. Brown the piece of beef in a stew-pan, then brown slightly the vegetables. Pour away the dripping; add the water and ketchup to the beef and vegetables. Break the flour with a little water, stir it smoothly in. Simmer with the lid on for an hour (longer if the meat is tough, or if a large piece is used), but do not allow it to boil; stir fre- quently to prevent the flour sticking to the pan. When nearly ready add the salt and pepper. Arrange neatly on a dish.

Cut the meat into two neat strips, say about 3 inches wide. Rub the dripping and bread finely together; add the parsley, salt, and pepper; stir in the milk to bind the mixture. Roll half of this into each strip of meat; tie each roll with a piece of string or thread. Place in a small stew-pan, add the warm water and browning; break the flour with a little cold water, add it gradually to the stew ; stew slowly for about three-quarters of an hour, stirring frequently to prevent the flour sticking to the pan. When cooked, remove the string, arrange the olives neatly on a dish with the gravy round, and serve.

ADAPTATION OF FOOD. IV. Different States of Health. Diets for those in health are embodied in the pre- ceding remarks. In sickness, much of the progress of the patient towards recovery depends on the giving of judiciously chosen and well prepared food.

In convalescence give broiled or boiled (not fried) white fish, whiting is best; later give eggs and animal food beginning with tripe and mutton.

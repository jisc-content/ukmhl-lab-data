24 ADAPTATION OF FOOD. for out-door workers light and quickly digestible; it is more important to have them solid and supporting. For example, in suet puddings and dumplings, baking powder and bread crumbs need not be used. Porridge may be made with hot water instead of cold. Crappit heads, fat brose, haggis, poor man’s goose, fried liver and bacon (see recipes), and other nutritious but some- what indigestible articles, may safely form part of the diet of labouring men. Most labourers can obtain cheese, bacon, flour, barley, oatmeal, rice, peas, and beans. With these and with potatoes and fresh vegetables, grown it may be in their own gardens, a few flavouring herbs (as thyme, mint, marjoram, sage, and parsley), which could easily be cultivated in a small garden, they may obtain a thoroughly nutritious and varied diet. Cheese especially ranks near animal food in the amount of nourishment it contains. A dinner of bread and cheese, accompanied by half a lettuce (too little used by the poor), or an apple, water cress, or a few dan- delion leaves, gives all the kinds of food needed to support the body in health. But these materials even when more lightly pre- pared are unsuitable for children’s diet, without the addition of milk, and it is much to be regretted that this important element of diet is so difficult to be obtained in country districts. The custom of allowing each cottager grass for a cow, seems to be rapidly dying out, and one consequence of it is that children are insufficiently nourished. Landed proprietors and tenant farmers could hardly confer a greater benefit upon their cottagers, than by providing a plentiful supply of milk for them to purchase. In places where there is insufficient pasturage for cows, goats might be kept.

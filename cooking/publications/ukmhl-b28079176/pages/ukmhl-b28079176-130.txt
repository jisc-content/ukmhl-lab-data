SAUCES. 128 Put the dripping into a small saucepan, melt it, then draw the pan to the side of the fire ; add the flour and mix well with the back of a wooden spoon. Add very gradually the water and salt, stirring con- tinually till there are no lumps. Stir over the fire till the sauce boils, boil it for three minutes, take it off the fire and stir in the butter. White Sauce.—Prepare in the same way as melted butter, but use milk instead of water. Parsley Sauce.—Required: melted butter; i teaspoonful chopped parsley. Wash the parsley, wring it dry in a cloth, pick it carefully off the stalks, chop small and stir into the melted butter. Caper Sauce.— Required: melted butter; i dessert spoonful capers. Add the capers to the melted butter. Onion Sauce.—Required: melted butter; r large or 2 small onions; i pinch pepper. Skin and boil the onions until soft; mince small; stir in with the pepper to the melted butter. This sauce should be quite thick. It is more delicate if the onions are rubbed smooth with the back of a spoon before adding them to the melted butter. Egg Sauce.—Required: melted butter; i hard boiled egg. Put the egg into boiling water, boil ten minutes, then dip it into cold water to preserve the colour. Take off the shell ; mince the yolk and white and add it to the melted butter. Sweet White Sauce.—Prepare in the same way as melted butter, but use milk instead of water, and a teaspoonful of sugar instead of salt. It may be flavoured with nutmeg, cinnamon, or lemon juice.

VEGETABLES. 97 nice mashed and mixed with mashed turnips, a little dripping or butter, and a pinch of salt. Turnips.—Prepare the turnips (see p. 38). Cook in the same way as carrots ; they take rather less time. Cabbage.—Required: 1 cabbage; boiling water; 1 teaspoonful salt to 1 quart of water. Prepare the cabbage (see p. 37). Place it in a saucepan with enough boiling water to cover it. Let it boil uncovered and very fast, till the stalk end of the cabbage is soft, for about half an hour to three quarters of an hour. Place it in a colander, and press with a plate to squeeze out the water. Place in a dish and cut into quarters. Colcannon.—Required: equal quantities of cold potatoes and cold cabbage ; 1 oz. dripping to 1 lb. of vegetables; teaspoonful salt; % teaspoonful pepper; 1 oz. dripping to grease the basin. Crush the potatoes with a fork ; chop the cabbage small; mix both together and place in a saucepan with the dripping, pepper, and salt. Stir over the fire till the dripping has melted and mix with the vegetables. Grease a basin or pie dish ; place the mixture in it; put it in a hot oven for about half an hour. Turn out on a dish ; serve hot. Cauliflower.—Required: 1 cauliflower; boiling water; 1 teaspoonful salt to 1 quart of water. Prepare the cauliflower (see page 37). Place it with the flower downwards in enough boiling water to cover it. Boil uncovered for twenty minutes to half an hour, till the stalk end is tender. Place the cauli- flower in a colander to drain off the water. Serve with melted butter. Peas.—Required: peas; boilingwater; 1 teaspoon- ful sugar to a quart of peas.

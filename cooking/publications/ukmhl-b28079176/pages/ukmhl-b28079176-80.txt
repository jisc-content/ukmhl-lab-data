Trim the cutlets neatly, leaving about an inch of the bone bare; sprinkle with the pepper and salt; cover slightly with the flour. Break the egg on a plate, beat slightly with a fork; cover each cutlet well with the egg, using a feather or brush; toss them in the bread crumbs in a sheet of kitchen paper. Melt the butter in a thick frying-pan, but do not let it dis- colour. Place the cutlets in the pan, and fry very slowly till the butter round each cutlet begins to brown. Then turn carefully with a knife; cook the other side in the same manner; when ready, place them on kitchen paper to absorb the butter. Serve neatly with mashed potatoes, and garnish with parsley.

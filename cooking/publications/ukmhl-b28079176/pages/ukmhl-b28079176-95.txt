CHEAP DISHES WITHOUT MEAT. 93 Welsh Rabbit—Required: x round of stale .bread; about 2 oz. strong cheese; 1 oz. butter; 2 tablespoonfuls milk; y4 teaspoonful made mustard; x/ teaspoonful salt; 1 pinch of pepper. Toast the bread on both sides; put it on a hot ■plate in front of the fire; spread it with the butter. Cut the cheese into small pieces ; melt them in a small pan with the milk, pepper, salt, and mustard; stir till smooth; spread quickly over the buttered toast. Unless served immediately, the rabbit becomes tough. Mealy Puddings.—Required: some long pud- ding skins; 1 lb. oatmeal; ^4 lb. minced beef suet; 3 small or 2 large onions (parboiled); % teaspoonful salt; % teaspoonful pepper. Get from the butcher some long skins for puddings; wash them well in warm water, then lay them to soak all night in cold water and salt. Rinse them well. Toast the oatmeal to a light golden colour before the fire or in the oven, stirring it to let it toast equally. Chop the suet very fine, also the cooked onions; mix all together, with the pepper and salt. Tie the end of the pudding skin with thread, then put in enough of the mixture to make it the length of a sausage; tie the skin again, but leave room for the pudding to swell. Leave about an inch of the skin, tie it again, then fill another, and so on. (The space is to allow each pudding to be cut off without letting out the mixture.) Have a pan with water in it nearly boiling, and a little salt. Prick the puddings all over with a darning needle, to prevent them bursting, and boil them for twenty minutes or half an hour. Serve hot. Currant Puddings.—Required: some long pud- ding skins; ^ lb. stale bread crumbs; 2 oz. flour; lb. minced beef suet; % lb. currants; 2 oz.

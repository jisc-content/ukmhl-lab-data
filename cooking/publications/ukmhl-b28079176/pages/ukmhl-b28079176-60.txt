To Fry Fish.—(See general directions for frying, page 43.)—Clean and dry the fish well, cut it into neat pieces, and prepare them for frying in one of the following ways :— 1 st. Break flour with enough of cold water to make it a thick batter; dip each piece of fish into this, and fry. 2nd. Brush the pieces over with milk ; toss them in flour in a sheet of kitchen paper; shake oft" the loose flour ; fry. 3rd. Dip the pieces into batter No. 1 (as above); toss them in stale bread crumbs in a sheet of kitchen paper ; shake off the loose crumbs ; fry. 4th. Break an egg on a plate ; beat it up slightly; dip the pieces in this; toss them in stale bread crumbs in a sheet of kitchen paper; shake off the loose crumbs; fry. Instead of bread crumbs prepared from the crumb of bread alone, crusts or any stale bread may be used, which are dried in the oven (not allowed to brown), pounded and kept in tightly corked bottles for use. Pounded rusks or water biscuits may be used instead of bread crumbs. Filleted Fried Fish.—A thick fish, such as haddock, should be filleted before frying. This is done by cutting the flesh off at the back, beginning at the head, using a sharp knife. The bones should be used for soup or sauce.

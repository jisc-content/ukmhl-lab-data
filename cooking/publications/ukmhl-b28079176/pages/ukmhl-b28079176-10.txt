INTRODUCTION. 8 is not kept up they die. In keeping up this warmth something is used up, and this must be replaced. Food replaces the materials used up by the move- ment of our bodies, keeps up warmth, and gives power of movement, or, as it is more correctly called, force. Food cannot, however, accomplish these ob- jects in its natural state. It must be reduced into a lluid form so as to be able to pass through very small channels, and to be carried along in the blood. After it enters the bloodvessels it must mix with air,1 drawn in through the lungs and skin, and through the changes effected by the air and by various other organs of the body, the food is gradually made fit to replace all wasted and worn-out materials. I he wholesomeness of food depends on three con- ditions :— 1. On the selection of the right materials, whether animal or vegetable, and on their use in proper pro- portions. 2. On cooking the materials in such a manner as to make them digestible,—that is, capable of being readily turned into material fit for replacing the waste of the body already spoken of. 3. On adapting the use of food to the different cir- cumstances of age, employment, climate, and state of health. 1 That part of air called oxygen.

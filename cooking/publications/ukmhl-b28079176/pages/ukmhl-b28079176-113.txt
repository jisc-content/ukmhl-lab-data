MILK PUDDINGS. m sago, barley, and semolina puddings may all be made without eggs. In this case the pudding must be longer simmered so as to thicken the mixture; and in macaroni the milk should be thickened with oz. flour. It is best to add the yolk and the white of the egg separately. Beat the yolk and put it into the pudding; then whisk the white and add it. If, however, there is not time to separate them they may be beaten together and added to the pudding. A mixture should always be allowed to cool before an egg is added to it, as great heat makes the egg curdle. If cooked too long the egg loses part of its nutritive quality. When a pudding is cooked with the heat coming from below, as is generally the case in an oven, the dish should be greased to prevent the pudding sticking to it; when the heat comes from above, as when a pudding is cooked before the fire, it is unnecessary to grease the dish. A steamed pudding is ready, if, when you press your finger on it, no mark is left.

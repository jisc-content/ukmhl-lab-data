VEGETABLES. IOI Boiled Rice with Meat—About twenty minutes before serving the meat, put a good cupful of well washed rice into the broth or stock, and cook slowly for twenty minutes. Pour the stock through a colander to separate it from the rice and arrange the rice round the meat, adding a little of the stock as gravy. Plain Boiled Macaroni.—Required: % lb. macaroni; 2 quarts hot water; teaspoonful salt. Put the macaroni into hot (not boiling) water with the salt; leave the saucepan uncovered; allow the macaroni to boil for about twenty minutes till quite solt and swollen; pour through a colander to dram away the water. Serve hot, with or without parsley sauce. Haricot Beans.—Required: 1 pint beans; 2 quarts cold water; 1 teaspoonful salt. Wash the beans in cold water; put them into a basin and cover them well with cold water. Soak for one night, pour away the water; put the beans into a saucepan with plenty of cold water; boil for about two hours, till the beans are quite soft, but not broken. Pour them into a colander, so as to drain the watei well away. When ready, serve with parsley sauce poured over them. Mushrooms—Some mushrooms are edible; many are poisonous. The commonest edible mushrooms are generally found in meadows and on open ground, and are in greatest abundance in August and Septem- ber. The top is smooth, never warty; the underside is pink in young mushrooms and brown in the older ones. The stalk is firm and fleshy. Mushrooms are good for flavouring soups and stews, or may be used separately as a vegetable. Grilled Mushrooms.—Required: 6 small or 3 large mushrooms; oz. butter; 1 pinch pepper; 1 pinch salt.

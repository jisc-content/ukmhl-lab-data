GENERAL DIRECTIONSâ€”STEWING. 42 it at this heat till the meat is cooked, allowing a quarter of an hour to each pound, counting from the time the water begins to boil, and one quarter of an hour over. If it is a large piece of meat, allow half an hour over. Add a little salt when the meat is nearly ready. For salt meat or pork allow twenty minutes to each pound. Salt meat is put on with cold water. For fish allow ten minutes to the pound, and, when thick, ten minutes over. Green vegetables should be boiled briskly and without a lid on the pan: this helps to preserve the colour. Stewing. In stewing juicy meats the outside should be hardened by browning (see page 46) in order to keep in the juices. The meat is then placed in a stewpan and a small quantity of hot water or stock poured round it. This is slowly warmed and then allowed to simmer slowly, and must on no account be allowed to boil. Stewing chiefly differs from boiling in the quantity of water used, and in the length of time of cooking. The juice that is drawn out of the meat is served in the gravy. Coarse pieces of meat may be made tender by careful and long stewing, but they should not be browned. If very tpugh, they may be dipped in vinegar to soften the fibre. Gristly pieces should be put on with cold water and simmered till tender, but not allowed to boil fast. Another and a good way of slewing is to put the stew in a stone jar with a closely fitting lid, or cover of greased paper. The jar is placed on the hob, or in a slow oven, or i:i a sauce pan with water kept boiling round it.

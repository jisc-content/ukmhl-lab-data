MEAT—STEWING. 68 XII.—STEWING. The flavour of stews may be inexpensively varied by the use of various herbs. See remarks, page 46. Although the gravy of stews may be made with water, they will be richer and more nourishing if, instead of water, they are made with the liquor in which meat has been boiled, liquor from the stockpot, stock made with a few cooked or uncooked bones, or gravy left over from previous stews. When it is not convenient to add the water or liquor warm, it may be added cold. Irish Stew—Required: y2 lb. flap (in England called brisket) of mutton, or any fat scraps ; 1 lb. of potatoes; 2 onions ; about 1 pint warm water; y tea- spoonful salt; % teaspoonful pepper. Clean, pare, and parboil the potatoes ; cut them into slices ; skin and scald the onions, cut them into slices. Cut the meat into small pieces; put a layer of potatoes in the bottom of the pan, then some meat, onion, pepper, and salt; then more potatoes, meat, onion, &c., till all the meat, onions, and salt, and half of the potatoes are in. Add the water ; simmer slowly for half an hour; add the rest of the potatoes and simmer for another half hour. If the meat is tough it may be cooked a little longer. Irish stew may be made of cold fat meat or Australian meat, by cooking the potatoes and onions first, then letting the mixture cool, and only adding the meat to warm it thoroughly through. To vary this recipe the meat may be browned with a little dripping before stewing it. Haricot Mutton.—Required: lb. lean mutton ; Y turnip; y2 carrot; 1 onion ; y2 oz. dripping; y pint warm water; y teaspoonful browning; y tea- spoonful salt; 1 pinch of pepper.

The sticky or glutinous substance4 which was left in the cloth alter the starch was squeezed out of the flour, is a flesh former; also parts of almost all grains, such as oats, and including the glutinous matter5 of peas and beans. All these substances will make flesh that is, wil replace the used-up materials of the body and we shall therefore call them II. Flesh-formers.6 Table showing the Chief Flesh-forming Foods. Animal. Lean. Meat. Fish. Poultry. Skim Milk. Cheese. White of Egg. It will be seen from this table that both the animal and vegetable kingdoms supply flesh-formers. Half a pound of animal food contains a larger amount of flesh-forming power than half a pound of vegetable food. But the same amount of flesh-forming power may be derived from certain vegetable products (which are much cheaper) if taken in large quantities. The vegetable products which yield the greatest amount of 1 Albumen. 2 The juice and fibre of lean meat consist almost entirely of albumen and fibrin. 3 When milk is turned into cheese, this substance is called casein. 4 Glutin. D Legumin. 6 Technically called Nitrogenous Foods, as nitrogen is the flesh- forming element common to them all. They are also called albuminoid— i.e., white of egg like. Vegetable. Flesh-forming Material exists largely in— Peas. Flour, ) made Beans. Macaroni, > from Lentils. Semolina, ) wheat. Oatmeal. Rye. Barley. Maize.

Healthy adults should be able to take a free mixture of all wholesome foods, variously cooked, and taken at intervals of about five hours. I he circum- stances of climate and employment must, however, be considered. The digestive powers of elderly people are weaker than in middle life, the food should, therefore, be nourishing and easy of digestion \ it should be taken warm and at shorter intervals than in middle life. As the system is apt to become lowered during the night a light nourishing supper is advisable, and in cases of debility, also a little warm food during the night. II. Climate. More exercise is usually taken in cold than in hot climates, and this causes a more rapid wearing out of the materials of the body. 1 he increased rapidity of breathing caused by exercise, promotes the mixture of the oxygen of the air with the minute particles of food in the blood, and so uses or burns up more of these, and causes demand for increased supplies of food. Animal food is stimulating and exciting; it is there- fore more suitable for cold and temperate climates than for hot. When a false appetite is created for it in hot climates by the use of condiments, it is apt to produce various disorders. Fat is not easily digested unless exercise is taken freely : more oxygen must be mixed with it to produce heat than is required for starches and sugars. There is more oxygen in the air

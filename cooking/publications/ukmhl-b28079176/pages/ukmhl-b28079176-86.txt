Fat thus rendered down is generally called clarified fat or dripping, and may be used for pastry, cakes, and puddings,, for.frying, and for greasing dishes. To Clarify Dripping.—The same dripping or clarified fat may be used for a very long time for fry- ing. When it becomes brown and mixed with sedi- ment, place it in an iron pan, let it heat till a steam rises. Have ready a deep basin containing hot water; pour the hot dripping into this, very little at a time; to prevent it flying up; stir well.

Cut off the head; separate the skin from the neck, and fold the skin back over the breast; then cut off the neck close to the body. Draw out the crop carefully and then the wind- pipe.

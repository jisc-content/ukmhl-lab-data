general DIRECTIONS-FRYING. 43 Frying. Frying is cooking in hot fat. Tne ordinary bat wrong way of frying is to use a shallow frying pan and a small quantity of fat. This is extravagant and un- wholesome. Put into a stew-pan enough fat to cover the article to be cooked. Make the fat hot. It is at the proper heat when it is quite still and a slight vapour rises from it; do not wait till it smokes, for then it will burn. The fat may also be tested by- putting into it a small piece of crumb of bread ; if it becomes quickly a golden colour, the fat is at the right heat. Prepare the pieces to be cooked by covering them with a coating of egg and bread crumbs, or flour and milk, or flour and water. This covering hardens with heat, and makes a case to hold m the juices and also prevents the fat getting in and making the meat greasy. Do not have the pieces thicker than about an inch, unless the materials have been previously cooked Put them into the hot fat, but not many at a time, as the fat would be too much cooled. When they become a golden colour remove them ; place them for a few seconds on kitchen paper near the fire to absorb the fat, and then serve.1 .. , A A Oil, butter, lard, and dripping, or clarified tat, are, used for frying. Oil and butter are very expensive, and should only be used in high class cookery ; laid is apt to make what is fried in it greasy; dripping or clarified fat is the most suitable for use m an ordinary kitchen. . .. Dry Frying.â€”In dry frying a very small quantity of fat is used, and it is usually done in a fiying pan ; i A frying basket made of wire, and fitting the stew-pan is very convenient. The pieces arc laid in the basket and it is placed in the hot fat till they are cooked.

147 SICK-ROOM COOKERY. Boil stale bread for five minutes with enough milk to make it into a thick pulp. Spread it on a piece of cotton and apply it very hot, without any cloth be- tween, to the part affected. A few drops of warm oil rubbed over the part, prevents the poultice from sticking. When a bread poultice is to be applied to an open sore, it is better to use water than milk, as milk is apt to become sour. Bread poultices are cleansing and soothing. Linseed Meal Poultice.—Required: linseed meal; boiling water. Heat a basin with boiling water; place the basin in a larger one with boiling water round it to keep it hot. Place the linseed meal in the smaller basin ; stir in enough boiling water to make the meal into a moist paste. Then beat it quickly till it looks oily (about three minutes). Sew up three sides of a bag of flannel or cotton the size required; place it on a heated dish, or the heated back of an old tray; put the linseed meal into it; fold over and sew up the opening quickly. Apply the poultice to the affected part as hot as can be borne. If mustard is ordered with this poultice, stir a tablespoonful of dry mustard into it when nearly ready. Linseed meal poultices are especially valuable be- cause when well made they form a thick pulp from which no water trickles down to annoy the patient; they are generally given to allay inflammation. Oatmeal Poultices.—Required: oatmeal; boiling water. Make in the same way as porridge. Cnarcoal Poultice.—Required: 1 teaspoonful powdered vegetable charcoal; a small poultice of bread and water or linseed meal, or porridge.

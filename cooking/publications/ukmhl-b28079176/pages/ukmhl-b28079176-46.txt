44 GENERAL DIRECTIONSâ€”BAKING. the meat or vegetables should be frequently turned to prevent hardening. Bacon does not require fat at all as its own melting fat is sufficient. Chopped vege- tables, such as cabbages and potatoes mixed (the bubble without the squeak), are excellent food, with a nttle flnppmg, and may be done in a frying-pan. Cold pudding may be cut in slices and fried in this way. Baking. Baking is cooking by means of heated air in a confined space called an oven. Bread, cakes, and pastry are usually cooked in this way. As a general rule, anything containing starchy materials, as flour, airowroot, etc., should, if not previously boiled, be first placed in a hot part of the oven to burst the starchy grains and enable them to mix thoroughly with the surrounding liquid; they should then be removed to a cooler part, to cook slowly without scorching. If pastry is put at first into a cool part of the oven, the fat melts; but as the starch grains of the flour are not burst, they cannot absorb the fat, which runs out and makes the paste greasy and heavy. 1 he proper management of an oven must be the result of experience, as it is impossible to give exact rules. A large brick oven gives the most steady heat. Iron ovens become easily overheated, and small iron ones are apt to scorch what is cooked in them unless carefully regulated. Therefore, bread should be divided into smaller loaves when baked in a small oven, to prevent the outside being browned while the inside is still uncooked. 1 o test an oven, put into it a piece of stale crumb of bread; if in five minutes it is a golden colour, the oven is hot enough for cooking pastry or bread; if, on the contrary, the bread becomes dry and only slightly

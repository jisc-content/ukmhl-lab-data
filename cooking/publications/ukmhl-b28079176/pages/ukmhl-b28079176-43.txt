4i GENERAL DIRECTIONS—BOILING. continually, so as to let the inside of the meat cook slowly and so remain tender. Be carelul to put the fork into the fat or skin. If you pierce the lean, you will allow the juices to escape. If tongs are used, do not squeeze the meat. The length of time required depends chiefly on the thickness of the meat to be cooked. A separate gridiron should, if possible, be kept for fish. When the top of the fire cannot be used (as in close ranges), suspend a hanging gridiron in front of the fire with the meat between the two halves of the gridiron, which must be turned with the meat. Steaming. In steaming, the food to be cooked is placed in a tin or earthenware vessel, covered with a tight cover or greased paper.1 The vessel is placed in a pan of boiling water, which comes half way up its side. If the water boils away, more boiling water must be added. Puddings, etc., when steamed, do not require to have so much liquid in them as when baked. The dry air of the oven dries them; steaming keeps them moist. Boiling. Meat covered with water and cooked in it is said to be boiled, but it must not be supposed that the water should be kept at boiling point. Plunge the meat into boiling water (2120 Fahr.), enough to cover it. This hardens the. outside, and keeps in the juices. After the water (cooled by the meat) again comes to the boil, let it remain boiling for about five minutes, then skim carefully, and add cold water, or move the pot to a less hot place, till the water simmers instead of boils (about 170° Fahr.). Draw the pot aside, keep 1 No printed paper should be used in cooking’.

Wash the beetroot in cold water rubbing it with a soft brush not to break the skin.’ Put it into a pan with plenty of boiling water; boil uncovered for from an hour to an hour and a half; press it with the finger, if soft it is ready; do not prick it with a fork or the juice will run out and bleach the root. Let it cool in the water, then remove the skin and the top, and cut into thin slices. Arrange these on a dish and put a little vinegar, pepper, and salt, over them; if wanted to keep, put the slices into a jar, and cover with boiling vinegar. Beetroot can also be served hot (the skin and top being removed) with melted butter. Rice for Curry—Wash the rice well; put it into a saucepan with plenty of boiling water; stir well with a spoon to separate the grains; boil for from fifteen to seventeen minutes till the rice is well swollen and soft, but the grains must not be broken. Pour into a sieve or colander to drain away the water; let it dry in front of the fire and serve round the curry. If the rice is cooked too much and the grains do not separate, hold the sieve under the cold water tap, and let the water run freely over the rice, then put the sieve or colander in the oven for a few minutes to warm the rice. Patna rice is the best for curry.

Blanch the sweetbreads, i.e., place them in a stewpan with enough cold water to cover, add a little salt, and let boil; strain off the water and allow cold water to run over freely. Wash and trim them where necessary (removing any skin or sinews), and put them under press. Cut the carrot and onion into slices.

When cooked, take up and let cool. Warm up the tomato and veloute sauce, add to it the strained liquor from the sweetbreads ; dissolve the gelatine in a little water or stock, and strain into the sauce, which should be of a pale pink colour. (A few drops of liquid carmine or cochineal may be added if found necessary.) Strain the sauce into a basin, and put in a cool place. Cut the sweetbreads into quarter-inch thick slices, mask each side with the above sauce as it becomes consistent enough to coat. Decorate one side of each slice with'fancifully cut strips of truffle and slices of pimiento or chilli skin (crown or star shapes are most effective), fix the garnish with aspic, and when set, mask over the whole with a thin layer of aspic jelly.

’Recherche ‘Entrees. 148 Entrees of Game, Epigrammes de Faisan aux Petits Pois. (Epigrammes of Pheasant with Green Peas.) Remove the fillets from two pheasants, flatten them with a cutlet bat, trim them into neat heart shapes and season with pepper and salt. Dissolve an ounce of butter in a saute-pan, put in the fillets and fry a little on both sides until firm ; then press lightly until cold. Trim each epigramme neatly, immerse in nearly cold Allemande sauce, then set them to cool. Next egg and crumb them with fresh bread-crumbs or Panurette. Braise the carcases of the birds, remove the meat, and prepare a farce with 2 whites of eggs, a soaked French roll, cream and seasoning. With this same fill up a buttered border mould and cook, i.e., steam in the oven. Fry the epigrammes in clarified butter or lard, insert short pieces of macaroni to imitate cutlet bones, in the small ends. Dish up in a circle on the forcemeat border, and fill the centre with cooked green peas, previously tossed in butter and seasoned with salt, pepper and a pinch of castor sugar.

(Bordeaux Pigeons, Maltese style.) 2 Bordeaux pigeons, 6 preserved artichoke bottoms, I table-spoonful port wine, 6 fresh eggs, i oz. butter, i gill rich brown sauce, i gill rich veloute or supreme sauce, seasoning. Truss and roast the pigeons in the usual manner. Re- move bones and skin, and pound the meat in a mortar till quite smooth ; then add the butter, and season to taste with pepper, salt and nutmeg. Boil the eggs till hard, remove the shells, and cut a piece off the bottom to make them stand, cut also a piece off the top so as to scoop out the yolks ; put the latter with the pigeon puree again into the mortar, and mix the whole thorough- ly with this and the brown sauce ; then rub all through a fine sieve and add the wine (the latter m^ay be omitted if liked). Put the prepared farce in a forcing bag, and fill the whites of egg shapes by means of this. Place each on an artichoke bottom (fond dâ€™artichaut), force a thin border of farce round the edge, and range them on a buttered saute-pan. Heat up thoroughly in the oven, previously placing a buttered paper over the top ; then dish up and sauce over with hot supreme or veloute sauce.

76 Recherche Kntrees. Ris de Veau d la Chevali^re. (Braised Sweetbread, Chevaliere Style.) Blanch and trim a pair of sweetbreads, press them, and then lard with strips of fat bacon, tongue and truffles; arrange these in alternate rows. Place them on a mirepoix (bacon, carrot, onion, bou quet garni, etc.), moisten with a glass of Madeira wine and white stock. Braise the sweetbreads in this manner, taking care that the surface does not take colour, i.e., get brown. When done, cut each slantways into 4 or 5 slices, replace to original shape and dress on fried bread croutons. Garnish the dish with preserved mushroom heads (champignons), small glazed truffles, and cocksâ€™ combs, fill the centre of the dish with a delicate ragout of small chicken quenelles, and sauce over the sweetbreads with a well prepared supreme sauce. To improve the dish further, 2 or 3 silver skewers, each replete with a very small tomato, truffle, and champignons, should be inserted into the sweetbreads. Vol-au-Vent aux Quenelles de Veau.

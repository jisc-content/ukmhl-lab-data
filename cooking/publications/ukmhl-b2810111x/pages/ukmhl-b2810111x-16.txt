Recherche ~Enirees, lO those which are served with a sauce, and such which are served without a sauce, which is frequently the case with light Entrees. There are a large number of Entrees composed of slices of meat, sauteed, fried, grilled, broiled, or braised, dressed plainly with a good sauce, or if applicable with a dainty vegetable garnish. This garnish and sauce may also be applied to Removes (Releves) ; these, however, differ from Entrees inasmuch as in the former case the pieces are dressed small, whilst in the latter they usually consist of a boned joint, which is served whole. On the other hand there are other dishes of a more elaborate kind, both in preparation and garnish. All these come under the heading of Hot Entrees, solid, otherwise known as the small hot meats garnished, such as cutlets, Fillets, Grenadins, Escallops, Tournedos, large Pates, Sweetbreads, Fricandeaux, Ragouts, Fricassees, Boudiils, Quenelles, Salmis, Compotes, Timbales, etc., etc. Cold Entries.â€”This is known as the Cold Service. It is the most elegant and most artistic branch in Cookery in general, especially so when large dishes for special occasions are to be prepared, such as is the case for ball suppers, banquets, wedding breakfasts, grand buffets, etc., where the moulding or ornament in wax, fat, rice, etc., is at times required. Flowers, figures, etc., are occasionally introduced in a great variety. A great deal of skill and study is required for this branch of the art, which of late has, as before stated, been considerably modified, so much so that socles of wax and fat are no longer in vogue. This does not imply that no decora- tion is needed, so long as it is of an edible character.

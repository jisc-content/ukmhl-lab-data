70 Recherche Rntrees. Chartreuse de Veau a la Cr6cy (Cold). (Small Veal Fillets with Young Carrots.) I lb. lean veal, freed from skin and sinews, i small bunch new carrots, scraped and cooked, \ pint aspic, J oz. meat glaze, i glass Marsala, 3 sheets gelatine, chopped parsley, i oz. butter, i lemon, 2 truffles, i pimiento or beetroot for garnish, i gill Espagnole, cocks’ combs and kernels, oil, vinegar, seasoning. Cut the veal into rather thin slices of even size, and trim into cutlet shapes or small fillets. Streak them with semi-circles of truffle slices graduated in size, and carefully place them in a saute-pan containing J ounce of melted butter, season carefully with salt and pepper, and sprinkle over the juice of a lemon. Poach them thus in the oven, covered with buttered paper. When done, take up, drain and let cool. Next mask them well with aspic. Place a cylindrical or cone mould in a pan of crushed ice, coat the inside and bottom with a layer of aspic, and decorate the sides with an even chain of rounds of slices of truffle, pimientos and carrot, alter- nating the colours. When quite set, dip the decorated fillets of veal in half-set aspic, and range them round the sides of the mould. Heat up the sauce and reduce with the meat glaze and the wine, season to taste, and strain in the gelatine, previously soaked and melted, also a little aspic ; let cool. To this add sufficient cocks’ combs and kernels, the trimmings of truffles, and a few sliced cooked carrots, to fill the mould. Leave it on the ice to set for about an hour. Prepare a salad with the carrots, left whole or cut into quarters, to which a little shredded beetroot or pimiento can be added. Mix with oil and vinegar, add salt and pepper to taste, and sprinkle over with chopped parsley. Unmould the shape on to a cold entree dish, range the salad neatly into the centre cavity, decorate with a few sprigs of cress or endive, and serve.

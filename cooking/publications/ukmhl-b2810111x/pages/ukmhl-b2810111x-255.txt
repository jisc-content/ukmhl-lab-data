Sauces and Auxiliaries. 189 with the stock in a stew-pan. Cut the celery into small pieces, beat up the whites of eggs a little, and mix with the stock. Stir over a brisk fire continually until nearly boiling, then add the wine, vinegar, and lemon juice, and let boil up. Move the stew-pan on the side of the stove for about twenty minutes. Strain through a jelly bag or cloth, repeat straining until perfectly clear. Keep the aspic in a basin, and use as required. Note.â€”During the summer months the quantity of gelatine used for aspic and cream should be rather less than that stated in the recipe, but the stiffness of aspic should in all cases be tested before being used. Tomato Aspic. Heat up half a pint of tomato pulp, add to it half-ounce leaf gelatine (previously soaked in water), half-gill of aspic, and one table-spoonful of meat glaze ; stir until it boils, season to taste with salt and a pinch of cayenne pepper, rub it through a sieve, and use as directed. Tomato Mayonnaise. To a pint of well prepared and fairly stiff mayonnaise add half as much tomato puree or cold tomato sauce. Mix gradually and season to taste. Aspic Cream. One and half gills aspic jelly, half-gill double cream, one teaspoonful lemon juice, a pinch of white pepper, a pinch of castor sugar. Put the cream into a basin, stir with a whisk, and gradually add the aspic, which must be liquid, but on no account hot ; then add the lemon juice and seasoning, rub through a silk sieve, and use as directed.

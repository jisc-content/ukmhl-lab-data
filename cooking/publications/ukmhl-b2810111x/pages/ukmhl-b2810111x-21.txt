Entrees, 13 a similar kind in colour following. All Entrees should, as already stated, be handed round at table and not served from the sideboard. When light Entrees are served, or when two or even three Entrees are included in the same menu, the dishes should on no account be substantial enough to entirely satisfy the hunger of the diner, they should then be more or less in the form of relishes, so as to stimulate the appetite for the more heavy or substantial dishes which are to follow. The service of Entrees should never be hurried at a dinner, so as to allow each guest ample opportunity to eat of any or all the dishes served under this heading.

Recherche Entrees. 14 Schemes for Decoration.â€”The suggested decorations on this and the previous page are especially suitable for small timbales, darioles, parfaits, pains, mousses, or souffles, cold as well as hot. Truffles, hard-boiled whites of egg, green peas, pistachio kernels, pimientos, chillies, cucumber, cooked ham or tongue, and other edible and suitable ingredients may be used for this purpose. All of which must be cut into thin slices or so shaped as to suit the style of decorative design which may be decided upon.

Recherche Kntrees. 8 of a well balanced dinner depends largely the success of the meal. It therefore becomes a matter of great importance that the dishes served under this heading should be well thought out and prepared with the greatest possible care. Of late years, the term Entree has been modified and has in some respects undergone an entire change. Dishes that used to be served as hot Hors-d’CEuvre and even as Releve are now often given a place under the Entree course. In bygone days Entrees were served in conjunction with the joints as so-called “ side dishes,” but now these form a distinct course, and one of considerable im- portance. Some people are under the erroneous impression that by Entrees some sort of Ragout is meant. A white or brown Ragout of meat or poultry may, of course, be included as Entrees, but it by no means follows that these are the only dishes called by that name. Many simple Entrees can be, and are, with ad- vantage and economy, prepared from cold meats, poultry or game, from which excellent and tasty as well as dainty dishes are produced. In such cases great care must be taken by the cook to supplement the exhausted juices of such meat, poultry or game which has already been once cooked. This can only be done by careful manipulation and application of the required heat, and by the use of some good and rich stock or sauces, otherwise the dishes will scarcely be worthy of the name Entree, for they will neither be nourishing nor appetising.

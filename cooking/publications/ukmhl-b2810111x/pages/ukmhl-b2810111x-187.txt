Prepare a ragout with the sweetbread, cut in dice, mixed with the trimmings of truffles chopped up coarsely, and moisten with a little sauce. Put about a dessert- spoonful of this into each mould, and fill up with the re- mainder of the farce. Poach first on the stove, and then in the oven, for 20 minutes in all.

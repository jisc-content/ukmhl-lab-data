Pound whilst hot in a mortar, removing the herbs ; when smooth, add the sauce, and season to taste. Rub this through a fine sieve, and spread over the pheasant. Cut the foie gras, freed from fat, into fairly thick slices, and place them on top of the farce, roll up the bird neatly, and tie up with string. Put it in a fire- proof terrine or casserole, lined with fat bacon, spread a little butter over the top, cover the pan, and cook in a fairly hot oven for about 40 minutes, basting the bird occasionally. When done, pour away the fat, and take out the pheasant. Cut up the carcase, and fry it in the remaining fat, adding a little butter if necessary. Pour off the fat when fried, and moisten the carcase with a little good stock or gravy, and the wine. Boil for 20 minutes, then strain and add the sauce demi-glace. Par-roast, peel and boil the chestnuts in stock, and finish in glaze. Cut some raw ham into slices, and fry in butter.

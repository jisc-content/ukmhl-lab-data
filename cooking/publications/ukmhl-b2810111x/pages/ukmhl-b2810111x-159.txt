”5 EnirUs of Mutton. Cotelettes de Mouton d I’Americaine. (Mutton Cultets, American Style.) Trim 8 mutton cutlets, flatten, and pare them nicely ; season both sides with salt and pepper, and put in a saute-pan with 2 oz. of melted butter ; fry the cutlets a light brown on both sides, drain, and put them between two tin sheets with a weight on top. When cold, im- merse the cutlets in bechamel or other rich white sauce, so as to completely coat them. Place them on a wire tray and let cool. Crush finely a few cracknel biscuits, and roll the coated part of the cutlets in this, then dip them in beaten egg, and crumb with Panurette. Keep the bones of the cutlets perfectly clean. Fry them to a nice colour in hot clarified butter, drain and dish up in a circle. Fill the centre of the dish with sliced tomatoes tossed in butter and seasoned. Put small paper frills on the cutlet bones. Serve hot with cold cucumber sauce (see Sauces). Filets de Mouton a la Tyrolienne. (Fillets of Mutton, Tyrolean Style.)

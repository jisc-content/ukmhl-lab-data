6 concisely as possible, in order that any cook possessing the necessary rudimentary knowledge should be able to carry out the directions without great difficulty. Every recipe is complete in itself, and cross references, so common in many cookery books, have as much as possible been avoided. A special feature has been made of the illustrations given, which are taken from actual photographs of the dishes made according to the recipes. It will be noticed that the decorations and garniture suggested in the various dishes, and more especially those for “ cold service,” are all edible and wholesome. Over- decoration and extravagance in the use of materials, especially purely ornamental decorations, have been rigidly excluded. At the same time, elegance as well as excellence, so essential in dishes of this description, has been aimed at in every case. London, April, 1907.

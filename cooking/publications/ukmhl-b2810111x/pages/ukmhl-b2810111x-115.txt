Put the head in a stewpan containing enough water to well cover it, add a small handful of salt and boil up, then skim, add I carrot, i peeled onion stuck with 2 cloves, i turnip, a small bouquet of herbs, parsley, thyme and bay-leaf. Allow the head to cook gently for about 2| to 3 hours, when done, take up and let cool a little, then remove the meat from the bones, return the latter to the stewpan with more water and continue to boil for stock. Cut the meat of the calf’s head into conveniently sized pieces, put them in a stew or braising pan, with a glass of sherry, I pint of brown (demi-glace) sauce, i gill of stock, 10 ■ preserved mushrooms and 1-2 sliced truffles. Allow the whole to cook gently for another half-hour, skim occasionally and dish up neatly on a hot dish. Garnish the dish with the brain, fried yolks of eggs (fried in olive oil), or hard-boiled eggs cut into quarters, pickled gherkins, and fried croutons of bread, brushed over with meat glaze.

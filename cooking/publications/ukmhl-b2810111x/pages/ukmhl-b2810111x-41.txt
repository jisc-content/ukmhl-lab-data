Heat up the bechamel sauce, add the remaining ve- loute sauce and egg yolk, stir well over the fire. When hot, finish with a little cream, and add the remaining butter bit by bit and season carefully. Turn out the little shapes on to an entree dish, pour the sauce round, not over them, and serve hot.

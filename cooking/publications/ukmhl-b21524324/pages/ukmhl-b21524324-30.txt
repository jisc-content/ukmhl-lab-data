Dried vegetables are far less used by people of all classes than they ought to be; less meat and more of this vege- table diet ought to be introduced, not alone on account of the economy, but for health’s sake. In fact, the nitrogenous qualities of beans, peas, and oatmeal are far greater than those of meat, whilst the cost is widely different. Vegetables, such as the potato, parsnip, carrot, onion, cabbage, turnip, and marrow or gourd plants, are very useful, especially some of the first named. The potato is a valuable antiscorbutic. Since its introduction into England, and by the more constant use of vegetables, that dire disease, leprosy, has disappeared ; and, no doubt if they were more freely used now, many skin diseases and some kinds of consumption, which are but forms of scrofula on the lungs, would also gradually die out.

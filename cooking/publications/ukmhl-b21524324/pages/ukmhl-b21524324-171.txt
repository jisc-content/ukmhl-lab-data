HOW TO TEACH THE RUDIMENTS OF GRAMMAR AND ANALYSIS SUCCESSFULLY, Being a Series of Model Lessons for Teachers. In the Press—Ready October ist, 1878. The Difficulties of ENGLISH GRAMMAR and ANALYSIS SIMPLIFIED, WITH A COURSE OF EXAMINATION QUESTIONS. Teachers have long felt the need of a manual of this kind, as the ordinary Grammars which the student consults with a view to clear up some difficulty, are silent on the very points upon which he most needs help. Many knotty questions—similar to those set by the various public examining bodies—are here fully discussed and explained. It will thus be seen that the volume may be used with advantage as a companion to any text book on Grammar and Analysis. The Examination Questions are selected from the Pupil Teachers, Queen’s Scholarship, Certificate, College of Preceptors (diploma), Oxford and Cambridge (senior), and the London Matriculation Papers.

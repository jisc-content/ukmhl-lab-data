FOR THE USE OF SCHOOLS. 21 recent article in Blackwood's Magazine that herrings are richer in nitrogen than beef, also that “ fish-eaters are spare, sinewy, and strong, and free from those mountains of flesh and masses of blubber which characterise the prosperous beef-eater.” Per- haps this is not as elegantly expressed as it might have been, but it conveys a good deal of truth. There is not the slightest doubt of the highly nutritious character, the easy digestibility, and the immense value of fish above many kinds of flesh foods. The coarser kinds of fish are, fortunately for the poor, richer in nourishment than that which we fre- quently meet with at the tables of their richer brethren. Skate, conger eel, dabs, haddock, plaice, together with her- rings, are among the cheapest fish, but they are popular and good articles of diet. A recent analysis of a skate gave the following returns:— ater ... ... 64*3 Fat ... ... ... 27 Fibrine ... ... ... 19-1 Albumen ... ... ... 7.4 Gelatine and other matters... 6-5 100.0 Shellfish, such as crabs, crayfish, lobsters, whelks, mussels, &c., are very often indigestible. Unlike their cousin, the land snail, a clean-feeding creature, the sea Crustacea are coarse feeders, not over particular in the kind of diet they indulge in. Still they have been pronounced good brain-feeders by some scientific men, and until some new theory is started we are bound to believe them. Tinned lobsters are very good if fresh, but are rendered poisonous to some constitutions by being placed in the shop windows, and the sun’s rays allowed to pour upon them all day. It has been found that they thus generate bad gases, which, when taken into the system, produce sensations of poisoning. Lesson IX. Vegetable Foods now claim the attention of the student. The most highly nitrogenous vegetable foods are dried haricot beans, peas, oats, whole wheaten meal, barley, Indian corn, &c. The following table of the average comparative value of dried

PREFACE. Though primarily written for Teachers ancl Students of Cookery, this little manual will be found thoroughly adapted for ordinary domestic use. Under the head “ Artizan Cookery” are re- cipes suitable both for the cottage home and the tables of the middle classes. A course of twelve lessons on “ Upper-class Cookery," containing many original recipes, has also been added. B. W. G. Sholing, Hants, September, 1878.

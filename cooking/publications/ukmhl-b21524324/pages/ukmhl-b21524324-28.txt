20 LESSONS ON COOKERY, able flesh parasites. Pork is not so nutritious as beef or mutton and requires a greater amount of cooking. Never buy pork with a dark, clammy skin. If it is used at all, it should be delicate, tender, and juicy, with not too great a proportion of fat, the rind thin, the fat firm and white. Ham and Bacon are closely allied to pork. It is a universal household resource, and the chief of dried and salted meats. The following analysis of a slice of bacon will give the student some idea of its component parts, taking the various per- centages as— Water • • • 24‘6 Fat, chiefly Oleine • • • 58-3 Fibrine • • • 7*2 Albumen • •• 2-8 Scllt ••• • •• • •• • • • 5'1 Other Matter • •• 2 "O IOO’O Poultry may be classed in this descriptive and analytical cata- logue of meats. Poultry dealers generally judge by the beak of the birds, the spur, legs, and breast bone. The lower por- tion of the beaks of game and poultry when young are soft and pliable, the spur hardly formed, the legs and comb smooth, the skin thin. The flesh cf fowls having black legs is, as a rule, whitest when cooked. Geese and ducks may be tested by the lower part of the bill being pliable, the feet smooth, bright in colour and limber, i.e., easily bent to and fro. An old turkey has rough scales on the legs, callosities on the soles of the feet, the claws strong and long. In the male bird, when young, the tuft on the breast is just sprouting, the wattles on the neck small, smooth feet, and bill tender. Turkeys are best braised. Lesson VIII.—Fish as a Flesh-producer. Fish ranks next to beef. The herring is very valuable as an article of nutriment. The idea that eels, herrings, and mackerel are not nutritious or suitable as flesh foods has had its day, and careful analysis proves the new theory correct, and the old ideas the remnant of an exploded theory. It has been shown in a

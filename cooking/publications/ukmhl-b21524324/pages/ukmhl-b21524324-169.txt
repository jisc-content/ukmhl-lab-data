Tuns Passage, Paternoster Square, E.C. * HUGHES’S EDUCATIONAL COURSE. 13 (just issued.) LANGLER & HUGHES’S STANDARD GEOGRAPHIES Standard II. and III., each Id.; IV., V. and VI., October, 1878. These little Manuals are not hasty compilations, but have been prepared with the utmost care, and fully meet, in every respect, the requirements of the New Code, 1878. Teachers desirous of using books combining scientific accuracy with an arrangement of the text which reduces to a minimum the labour of committing to memory, are confidently invited to examine this series. New Book for Pupil Teachers, Students in Training Colleges, &c. Suitable also as a Reading-Book in the Upper Classes of Public Elementary Schools. 1 2mo. THREE SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCE, EXTRA CLOTH, LETTERED. HARMONIZED AND ARRANGED IN SHORT READINGS. By Rev. EDMUND FOWLE, AUTHOR OF “EASY LATIN AND GREEK BOOKS,” ETC. The Schoolmaster, says : “ It has been most carefully prepared, and must commend itself to everyone engaged in teaching Scriptural facts. It is an excellent aid to the young student of the Gospels. Teachers will find their labours lightened by the tabular arrangement of parables, miracles, discourses, &c. We heartily commend the book.” The School Guardian, says : “ Mr. Fowle has the happy art of producing books that are useable, books that one can teach from. Himself a teacher, he has found by experience what boys can learn, how they can learn, and how far it is expedient that their teacher should help them, or how far the books they use should be suggestive of help. He has utilized this insight in the preparation of the Gospels Harmonized, and has succeeded, perhaps as far as any one ever can, in harmonizing the facts and dates of the four evangelical narratives. We think it will make a capital class-book for the hotter kind of schools, and will be, as it is designed to be, exceedingly useful to teachers, pupil-teachers, and for family reading.” TESTIMONIALS.

Tuns Passage, Paternoster Square, E.C. *' : * HUGHES'S EDUCATIONAL COURSE. 11 NO"W READY.—Price Three Shillings and Sixpence. A SYSTEM OF itata fax fjttpl fodjm BASED UPON GRAMMATICAL ANALYSIS: WITH COPIOUS EXTRACTS FROM THE BEST AUTHORS. By W. S. ROSS, Author of “ The Book of English Literature,” etc. This work is not more especially intended for a manual of Elocution proper, than as an Advanced Reading Book. While it embraces all the better features of every system of Elocution extant, it is at the same time boldly and intelligently original. The fundamental principles of the system are entirely new. The principle of every mode of utterance, from the easiest colloquy to the sublimest eloquence, is deduced from concise reason- ing and common sense. The publishers leave the book with confidence to the appreciation of all those who desire to speak their mother-tongue naturally and well. It is the production of an author not only of high general attainments, but a most successful practical teacher of Elocution. OPIKIOHS, “It seems to me that your fundamental principle is right, and that all real grace and propriety of utterance must be founded on a perception of the logical relations of the successive sentences, and of their several parts.”—Professor Fitch, M.A., one of H.M. Inspectors of Schools. “ I can also testify to the complete success of your System of Elocution by the excellent practical results produced by it in this establishment.”— Rev. J. M. Pollock, M.A., LL.D., Clare College, Scorton. “ I have examined your new work on Elocution, and heartily recommend the work to the attention of teachers and advanced students.”—The Head Master, Royal Academy, Inverness.

I LESSONS ON COOKERY. CHAPTER I. Lesson I. The cleanliness of the kitchen and of the apparatus used therein is truly the foundation of good cookery. It is therefore of the utmost consequence that students should open their course of training by acquiring an intimate knowledge of the various methods of cleaning the kitchen and its furnishings, not only theoretically, but practically if possible. To Clean Silver.—This metal is usually cleaned with plate- powder applied with a piece of soft cloth, flannel, or a brush. After being moistened with water or spirit, it is then rubbed with a clean cloth and polished with a leather. Paraffin has also been used. The method is to take a piece of soft rag, drop on to it 2 or 3 (not more) drops of this mineral oil, rub the metal lightly and quickly till all stains are removed, then rub with a clean cloth of soft texture, and polish with a leather. This is particularly valuable for cleaning silver not required for immediate use; as stores of spoons, forks, silver candle- sticks, &c. Paraffin acts like a varnish and preserves the silver from tarnishing. Copper and Brass are best cleaned by the use of paraffin applied with flannel to the surface, and the addition of a little bathbrick or rottenstone, if very much stained. After rubbing well, polish with a soft cloth and a leather. Steel.—Knives are cleaned by machinery or on a board either with knife-powder or bathbrick ; the latter is most general. Fenders, &c., with turpentine and bathbrick, thus : scrape some of the bathbrick into an old saucer or plate, moisten it with a little turpentine, apply with flannel to the steel, rubbing vigorously ; polish off with a soft cloth. In cases where steel has become very much rusted, brush over with paraffin once or twice, and rub with emery-paper; polish after as above described. Steel knives, dipped in paraffin and dried, may be kept from rusting by placing them in well-dried sawdust. B

PUDDINGS AND SWEETS 76 second with strawberry syrup, and colour it with a few drops of carmine, the third with orange noyeau, and whip this last till quite frothy. Have ready a mould, and put these in, in layers. Leave it till set. Coffee Jelly (Cold). 1 pint strong coffee, 1 oz. gelatine, 2 oz. sugar, and flavouring to taste. Put the coffee into a pan with the gelatine and sugar, and let it dissolve. Strain it into a basin, add a few drops of vanilla, if liked; when cool, pour it into a border mould. When set, turn out, and fill the centre with whipped cream garnished with preserved cherries. Fruit Jellies (Cold). Decorate a mould lined with jelly with peaches or apricots, or any fruit to taste, and fill the mould with jelly flavoured to taste. Bananas are excellent for this. Wine Jelly (Cold). Made exactly like lemon jelly, only using 2 gills of sherry, and 1 gill of lemon juice instead of the 3 gills of lemon juice.

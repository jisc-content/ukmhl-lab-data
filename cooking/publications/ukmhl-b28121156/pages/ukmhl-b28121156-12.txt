PUDDINGS AND SWEETS 8 even blazes up at once, the oven is manifestly too hot. If, after a stay of 2 or 3 minutes the paper turns a dark, almost ehocolate brown, the oven is “ hot,” fit for patties and small pastry generally. If, after the same time, the paper, becomes of a Havanah or cigar brown, the over is “ quick,” and ready for tarts, vol-au-vents, and such like. If the paper ’ in the same, time, only turns a yellowish brown (the shade of a deal plank), the oven is a “ moderately quick” or “ soaking” one, ready for bread, large meat or game pies, pound cake, etc. If, lastly, when left in the oven for this time, the paper, is barely tinged with a yellowish shade, spongecakes, meringues, and such like may be put in, that require only light baking. Of course there are degrees between all these shades ; but experience soon teaehes the cook to differentiate and act accordingly. But broadly speaking these tests are reliable. When using the Indicator 450 degrees corre- sponds with ehocolate, or dark brown paper, and indicates a “hot” oven. 400 degrees corresponds with eigar-brown paper, or a “quick” or “sharp” oven. 350 degrees equals a yellowish-brown paper, or a “ steady” or “ soaking” oven. 275 to 250 degrees equals a very faint yellow, or a “ slack ” oven.

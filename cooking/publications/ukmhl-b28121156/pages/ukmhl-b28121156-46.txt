42 CHAPTER III SOUFFLES, PANCAKES, FRITTERS, ETC. People are very apt to confuse puddings and souffles, and often describe, and think of a souffle as a very light pudding. So undoubtedly it is, but it is also a pudding which has been lightened by adding cream or white of egg ; and one, moreover, with a cooked foundation to which has been added raw eggs, or other materials which do not need much cooking. Of course there are many different souffles, but they all must start with a foundation of thick sauce or batter, to which the eggs are added (generally in the proportion of 3 or 4 to every gill of milk used in the sauce), and finally the particular flavouring chosen. The only exception to this is the Omelet Souffle. A Mousse is simply a very light form of souffle, and for this an extra egg and a tablespoonful of cream must be allowed to every gill of liquid. Granted this is borne in mind a souffle should not present any great difflculty to the cook of average intelligence.

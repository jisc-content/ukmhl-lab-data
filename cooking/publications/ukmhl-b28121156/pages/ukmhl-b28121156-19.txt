Put it all into a stone jar, cover down tightly, and leave for a month before using. Apple Pudding (Hot). Line a basin with a suet paste. Peel, core, and slice sufficient apples that the dish may be well piled up in the middle. To every pound of apples allow from 2 to 3 oz. of Demerara sugar, according to the sweetness of the fruit, flavour with a few cloves, the grated rind of a lemon, and a little of the juice. When the basin is filled, cover with a lid of paste, and boil or steam for about 2 hours. If it is boiled tie up the basin in a cloth ; if to be steamed—which is by far the better plan—lay a buttered paper on top.

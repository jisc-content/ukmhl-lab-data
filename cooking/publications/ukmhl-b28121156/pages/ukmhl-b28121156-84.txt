CHAPTER VI VARIOUS SWEETS There are several different kinds of sweets, such as trifles, fools, fruit salads, compotes, etc., which come under no particular head, and which, therefore, it seems best to group in a chapter by themselves. Fruit Salad (Cold). This can be made of almost any fruits, such as bananas peeled and sliced, fresh or preserved cherries, oranges broken up into sections, straw- berries, cherries, currants, raspberries, etc. If the fresh fruit is unobtainable, use canned apricots, peaches, pineapple, etc. Stone, and cut up the fruit used with a silver knife, and let it all soak for an hour or so in liqueur flavoured S5n-up, and a little sugar. Serve in a china or glass bowl with whipped cream. 8o

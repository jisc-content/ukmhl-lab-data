PUDDINGS, BAKED, BOILED & STEAMED 33 o Bread and Butter Pudding (Hot). 2 oz. of sultanas, washed and dried, 4 thin slices of bread and butter, 1 dessertspoonful of sugar, 2 whole eggs, and a pint of milk. Put the sultanas at the bottom of a buttered piedish, cut up the bread and butter into small pieces, and put it on the sultanas, sprinkle the sugar over this ; beat up the eggs and milk to- gether, and pour it over the bread and butter, etc. Bake for about 45 minutes in a moderate oven. Cabinet Pudding (Hot or Cold). Butter a plain mould or basin, and ornament it with preserved halved cherries, fill it up with alternate layers of spongecake and ratafias or macaroons, pour over this 1 pint of custard, of whatever richness preferred ; (see p. 55, Chapter IV.); cover the mould with a buttered paper, and let it stand for some time, an hour if pos- sible. Then steam for IJ to 2 hours. If to be served cold, decorate it with more fruit, and serve it with whipped cream. Of course this pudding can be made much more simply with half bread and butter and sponge- cakes, or bread and butter alone ; raisins being used instead of the cherries, or other preserved fruit.

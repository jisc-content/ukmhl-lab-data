Boiled Custard (Cold). I pint of milk, 2 lumps of sugar, and 1 egg. Bring the milk to the boil with the sugar ; break the Ggg into a basin and pour the milk, when it has cooled a little, on to this, stirring it well; then strain this into a jug. Place the jug in a saucepan of boiling water, and stir the milk, etc., till it is quite smooth and creamy ; when it is beginning to cool, add in a few drops of vanilla, and pour it into glasses. Of course this may be made richer by using more egg yolks, and using half milk and half cream, or by adding | a gill of cream as the custard begins to cool. If to be moulded, use about | oz. of leaf gelatine to every pint of milk ; boil it up with the milk, and strain this on to the eggs to prevent the custard turning out lumpy. Chocolate Custard (Cold). Make a custard with 1 pint of milk, 2 oz. loaf sugar, the yolks of 3 eggs, and the white of one, flavouring it with 2 or 3 oz. of vanilla chocolate powder.

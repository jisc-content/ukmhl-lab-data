CUSTARDS AND CREAMS Beat up the eggs with the sugar and a table- spoonful of milk. When the milk boils, put in the gelatine, and stir it till it dissolves, then strain it on to the eggs, stirring well, and add the pineapple. Have ready a wetted mould, pour the mixture into this, and leave it to set. Turn it out and serve with a little of the pineapple syrup with it. Canned pineapple answers very well for this. Fruit Ballettes (Cold). pints of rich custard, 1 gill of cream, ^ oz. leaf gelatine, 1 oz. crushed macaroons, and 3 oz. stale spongecake crumbs. Add the cream to the custard, and stiffen it with gelatine. Pour the custard while still hot on to the macaroons and spongecake, and flavour with liqueur syrup. Leave it to cool. Line a ballette mould with this, and when just setting fill up the centre with a compote of any fruit to taste. Gooseberry Cream (Cold). 1 pint of gooseberries, 4 oz. loaf sugar, 2 gills cream, and ^ a wineglass of brandy. Top and tail the gooseberries, and stew them with a little water and the sugar to a pulp ; 6i

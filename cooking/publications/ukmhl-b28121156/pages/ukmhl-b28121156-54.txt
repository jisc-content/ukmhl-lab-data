Flavour some cliou pastry with vanilla, or lemon, etc. Have ready some hot fat, drop small spoonsful of the pastry into this ; fry till of a bright, golden brown. When these fritters come to the top of the fat, keep them well turned to prevent their breaking. They take from 10 to 15 minutes to cook. Apple Fritters (Hot). Peel and core some apples so as to leave them in rings, roll them in sugar, coat with batter, and put them into a pan of very hot fat with a skewer ; when coloured on one side, turn them, but be careful not to let the fritters touch one another. When cooked, drain on kitchen paper, and serve very hot dusted with castor sugar. Always reheat the fat before putting in a second lot. Any fruit can be used in this way, though if preferred it can be marinaded in sugar, lemon juice, liqueur, wine, spirit, or Hqueur syrup to taste for an hour before coating it with batter.

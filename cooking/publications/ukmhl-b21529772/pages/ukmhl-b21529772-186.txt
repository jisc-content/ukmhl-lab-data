Put half a pound of the best macaroni in boiling water, with a little salt and butter; when done, drain it, and place it in all its length on a napkin: line the timbale mould with very red lobster butter to colour the macaroni, which you will wind, one tier above another, round the bottom and sides of the mould, forming a coil with the macaroni, which thus produces a crust; cut the ends of the pieces square, that they may meet; then cover the macaroni inside with an inch thick of farce for game quenelles (No. 34), with rather more panade in it than usual: be careful not to displace the macaroni. Fill this timbale within half an inch of the top with a o-ood scollop of fillets of larks, red partridges, pheasants, or wild rabbits, with truffles or mushrooms, sauced with a good Spanish sauce, with game flavour; put this ragout in a cold place; mask it thusâ€”make a round of farce, half an inch thick and four and a half wide, on a sheet of buttered paper; turn this over on the ragout; the paper will come off* by applying a warm cover to it a moment; close the edges of this round with the farce at the sides of the timbale. When the timbale is completed, put it in a stewpan with hot water, and let it set; the water must not boil; it will take an hour and a quarter about.

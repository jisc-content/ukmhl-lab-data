101 LARGE REMOVES. No. 237. Boiled Leg of Lamb and Spinach. Take the hind quarter of a ewe lamb, with a fine udder; take off the loin, which divide into about twelve neat cut- lets; put these into a saute pan with clarified butter, sprinkled with a little pepper and salt, and cover them with buttered paper. The leg is generally thrown into cold water, about an hour beforehand, to make the fat as white and as delicate as possible. Prepare a poele thus:â€”Cut into dice about a pound of beef suet, half a pound of bacon fat; add a quarter of a pound of butter, a faggot of parsley, with a sprig of thyme, an onion stuck with a clove, a few pepper-corns, a carrot, a turnip, and a lemon cut in slices, without the peel. Put your leg of lamb into an oval kettle, having a slice in it, that you may get out the lamb more readily; cover it with water, and put in the above ingredients. As soon as it boils, put it on a back stove: it requires about an hour and a half. About five minutes before you take it up, sautez your cutlets on a brisk fire; when one side is done, take off the paper, and turn them; when nearly done, drain off the butter as much as pos- sible, and pour in a little light thin glaze; sautez them and turn them again. Drain the leg of lamb; dish it; on each side place six spoonfuls of spinach (No. 104), on each spoonful place a cutlet, the fat towards the edge of the dish, then put another spoonful of spinach on each cutlet, so that part of the cutlet is seen. Put a ruffle on the shank, and a spoonful of spinach across the joint. The neatness and symmetry with which joints, See., are dished, are as essential as dressing them well. No. 238.

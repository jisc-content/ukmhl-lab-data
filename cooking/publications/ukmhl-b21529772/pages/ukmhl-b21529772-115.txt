Koll a sheet of nouille paste out very thin, which cut in stiips about a sixth of an inch broad, and these cut in pieces three-fourths of an inch long: you may fold your paste, lightly dusted with flour, which will enable you to cut several at a time: blanch them in boil- ing water, after which drain and cool them; put them into a stewpan with a ladle-ful of good consomme (No. 5), to stew on a slow fire twenty minutes; strain, and add as much consomme as is wanted.

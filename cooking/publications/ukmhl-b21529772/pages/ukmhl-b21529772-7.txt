PREFACE. The main object in this collection of recipes has not been to extend them beyond the limits of utility, but to select a sufficient number to answer all the purposes of variety, and, at the same time, to insert only such as have been tried and generally approved of. Enough of my time has not been devoted to the perusal of fan- ciful disquisitions on gastronomical history, to entertain those whocondescend to take this volume in hand with highly-wrought and far-fetched curiosities of the art, or with the sayings of persons eminent as practitioners, either in the kitchen or at the table : I shall feel sufficiently gratified if, in the course of my work, it appear that, in addition to recipes for elegant as well as palatable preparations, I have interspersed the whole with information immediately connected with the practice of cookery, and founded on good and close observation and experience. What I have gathered is chiefly from a school, than which none ever afforded a wider field to the learner, and over which a taste highly keen and cultivated was known to preside : I allude to his late Majestyâ€™s kitchen. I have endeavoured to make the explanations as clear as possible, and, hoping it may not fail of encouragement from those Ladies who take pleasure in making themselves acquainted with all that belongs to domestic matters, I have been at some pains, that, when my book falls into their hands, they may not reject it as savouring too strongly of the kitchen, and that they may understand rfif meaning without having the head-ache, or exerting their own ingenuity to find it out. a 2

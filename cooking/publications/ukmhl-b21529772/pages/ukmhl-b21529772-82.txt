SAUCES. 38 duce, add a little sauce tournee (No. 43): season with a little pepper and salt. When this sauce is for poultry or any meat, it is usual to add a little glaze. It should be of the consistency of double cream. No. 86. White or Royal Financiere. Blanch some quenelles of chicken (No. 34) or of game; put some lambâ€™s sweetbreads whole, or veal throat sweet- breads, into a white braise (No. 14), or pass them in a saucepan with a little clarified butter; the veal sweet- breads when done are cut in scollops. Prepare some bot- toms of artichokes ;* put all these with prepared cocks- combs and kidneys (No. 23), mushrooms done white (No. 21), together with fat livers which have been blanched and nicely trimmed; some egg balls of various sizes, to imitate the eggs taken from the inside of pullets, into a stewpan, with some good supreme sauce (No. 45). Add a few truffles cut into little balls, and stewed in a glass of dry Madeira or Rhenish. Move your stewpan about from time to time, that the contents may not catch to the bottom. If not sufficiently white add a little cream, and work it with a little butter. Keep it hot in the bain marie. No. 87- Toulouse. Prepare the ingredients of the preceding article as there directed, without wine or truffles; throw them into a good Allemande or German sauce (No. 4/) instead ot using supreme. * Bottoms of artichokes become black without great care. Tear off the outside leaves, leaving just a few round the choke. Turn the bottoms as you would a mushroom. Rub them with lemon juice and throw them into cold water and salt. Blanch them till you can easily take oft u leaf, and throw them into cold water. Remove the chokes; leave the bottoms who e or shape them to your fancy. They must be afterwards passed with a little buttered lemon juice and water. Let them simmer till quite tender.

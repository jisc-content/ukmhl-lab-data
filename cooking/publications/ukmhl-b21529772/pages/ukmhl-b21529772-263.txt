219 ENTREES OF VEAL. No. 593. Tendons of Veal with Endive. Prepare them as the tendons a la poulette (No. 584); glaze them, and serve them on stewed endive (No. 103). No. 594. Tendons of Veal and Stewed Lettuces. Prepare the tendons as in No. 584; blanch a few more cabbage lettuces than you have tendons; cool them and drain them on a cloth; cut off the green leaves and the stalk very close; line a stewpan with layers of fat bacon; season the lettuces with pepper and salt, and put them in; cover them with slices of fat bacon, and put them on a back stove to simmer an hour and a half; drain them again; shape them neatly; put them in a saute pan, and stew them in the oven again, with a few spoonfuls of strong consomme, and a little brown sauce (No. 63), to which add a little pounded sugar, and glaze: dish them en miro- ton, a lettuce and a tendon alternately. Serve it with the sauce with which the lettuces were stewed. No. 595. Tendons of Veal with Lettuces Farced. Prepare the tendons and the lettuces also as above; when the latter are blanched nip out the hearts, and fill the vacancy with a little quenelle farce (No. 34), and flatten the lettuce down to the shape and size of the tendons. Dish and serve as above. No. 596. Friteau of Tendons of Veal. Any of the above, previously served, may be marinaded with a little oil, vinegar, sliced eschalot, a little pepper, and salt; when drained on a cloth dip them in batter (No. 17); fry them in lard; when nicely coloured drain them; dish them, and garnish them with fried parsley. Serve poivrade (No. 66) in a boat.

ENTltE.ES OF BEEF. 205 No. 540. Palates of Beef with Truffles. Prepare the palates as in No. 538; cut them up with a plain round cutter. Sautez some truffles with a little butter, or truffles previously served whole will do; cut them up with a fluted cutter rather larger than the plain one; dish them en miroton, with a border of mushrooms, done white, neatly placed round them. Fill the middle with a salpicon made from the trimmings of the palates, mushrooms, and truffles, and supreme sauce (No. 45), with half a glass of white wine added to it; scrape the point of a knife on a piece of garlick, and pass it in the sauce. Mask the border of mushrooms with the sauce. No. 541. Palates of Beef with Italian Sauce. Cut the palates up in pieces of the size of a crown piece. Reduce some brown Italian sauce (No. 68), very thick, throw in the palates, let them simmer a little, sautez them; add the juice of a lemon, and serve. Gar- nish them with flowerets of puff paste glazed. No. 542. Palates of Beef with Cucumbers. Prepare and cut the palates as in No. 538; throw them into a stewpan, and cover them with a good supreme (No. 45), in which trimmings of cucumbers have been stewed.

When about to serve, throw in a couple of dozens of pieces of cucumbers, stewed in white consomme, and kept hot in white cucumber sauce (No. 62).

Form a ring in the bottom of a buttered mould; place the little round fillets of truffle on the cray fish tails, regularly intermixing with them small fillets of fowl, set in butter, and trimmed: thus line the sides of the mould. Chop the trimmings of the truffles small, line the bottom of the mould, and on this lining put another of quenelle farce, about an inch thick ; then line the vegetables already placed round the sides: fill the middle with a blanquette of chicken, lambâ€™s sweetbread, or scol- lops of fillets of game, or a ragout a la financiere (No. 86), or h la Toulouse <No. 87). Only fill the mould within half an inch of the top, and let the ragouts be cold. On buttered paper, form a lid of farce, half an inch thick, and place it over the chartreuse; the garnish of which is thus enclosed in farce. A warm cover, applied a moment, will enable you to take off the buttered paper. Close the edges of the farce; place the chartreuse, thus finished, in the bain marie, with a sheet of buttered paper over it. When it has remained there a good hour and a halt, dish it, take off the mould, and serve. Put a circular border of mushrooms on the top, with an ornament in the middle of small fillets of chicken truffled, and cut in crescents. * F.n surprise signifies as a catch; no. tended as a surprise. appearing what it really is, in

Haunch of Venison. Wipe the haunch dry with a cloth, and cover it with paper rubbed with butter, to prevent, as much as possible, the fat from wasting; cover this thickly with a paste made* of flour and water, mixed with a little pollard; round this tie three or four sheets of white kitchen paper. It is a material advantage to roast it in a cradle spit; the fire must be strong; keep it well basted or the paper will burn: it will take about four hours, or four hours and a half. When nearly done, cut the string, take off the paste, and baste the haunch with butter; dredge it lightly with flour, and let this take a light brown colour. Serve with good strong gravy, without seasoning, and with plain cold currant jelly, in separate boats. For another sauce, see rump of beef the German wav (No. 212). 3 Or this, a pint of port, with a pint of mutton gravy, ■ trong, brown, and clear, and a table-spoonful of currant jelly; let these merely boil up.

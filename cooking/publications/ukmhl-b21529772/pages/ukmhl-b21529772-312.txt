Pink Champagne Jelly.

No. 759- Wine Jelly. Reduce a calfâ€™s feet stock (No. 11) from four quarts to two; add a pound of sugar, the peel of two lemons, only the yellow part of the peel (zest), the juice of six, a small piece of cinnamon, a quarter of an ounce of coriander seed, a bottle and half of Madeira, and about a quartern of the best French brandy; beat together the whites and shells of six eggs ; mix with this a ladle-ful of the stock; then put the whole together, and whisk it over the fire until it boils; draw it off, cover it, put some fire on the top, and let it stand a quarter of an hour ; pass hot water through the jelly bag, and, when this is drained off, pass the jelly through; put some in a glass, and put it back in the bag until perfectly transparent and bright; pour it into the mould. I recommend the box stands, which keep away all currents of air, and prevent the jellies from being chilled before properly strained. No. 7^0. Jelly filled with Fruit. Make the jelly as above; put a little in the mould; on this place fruit, preserved or raw, and fill up with jelly, so that the fruit appears embodied in the jelly.

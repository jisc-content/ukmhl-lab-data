260 PASTES. body; no strength or pressure must be used ; and your paste cannot fail to be good. When you pull the paste out a little, if it draws back upon itself, it is tough, and not well made ; spread it out, and put pieces of butter as large as a nut in different places on it; work the paste again, and it will attain the proper consistency. It should not be too soft nor too firm,â€”just between the two. The butter must be worked sufficiently to soften it, that it may mix easily with the other ingredients. This applies to the cold season. When too soft, in summer, put it in iced water in pieces; to use it, take it out, and work out the water in a napkin. Roll out the paste to a square, place the butter on the middle, and enclose it in the paste, which must be equally thick all round it; let this be done quickly; roll it out on a slab or dresser; when the sheet of paste is about three feet long and one wide, fold it on itself, length- ways, in three, equally ; turn up one end first, then the other over that; turn it sideways, that is, bring next to the right hand the corner which was nearest to your left; roll it out as before; fold it a second time, shifting the position as before, and roll it down two inches longer than it is wide, and quickly place it on a baking sheet dredged with flour ; place it on pounded ice; put a nap- kin round the paste, and a baking sheet with pounded ice over this: this is to keep the surface of the paste cool, and especially to prevent its being softened by a warm atmosphere : in three or four minutes turn it over, cover it, repeat this operation, and then roll it two more turns as above described ; replace it on ice, and turn it over as before; then roll it a turn and a half or two turns, accord- ing to its use.

(j MANAGEMENT OF A LARDER. Necks and loins answer either for chops or roasting; they should be sprinkled with salt before they are hung up. The hand is generally salted for boiling.* VENISON. Venison is reckoned the choicest meat in use, and is oftener spoiled than any other. The cooks generally get the blame, but the fault lies mostly with the park-keeper, for want of precaution in killing them. This ought to be done at day-break, when it could be effected immediately; for the bucks herd together, and when first they are roused stand to look about them ; the keeper, always being ready on the spot, would be enabled to take a sure aim. Having been present, I can speak to the fact; and it is impossible for meat to keep that is hunted three, four, and even five hours, which is too often the case. The haunch is the finest joint. The keeper should bring it in as early in the morning after killing as possi- ble. There is a kernel in the fat the same as a leg ot mutton, that should be taken out, and the part wiped very dry, and a little ground pepper and ginger rubbec on the inside, which will keep the flies from it. t is t le best keeping meat of any, particularly if what I have mentioned be strictly attended to. _ The neck is the next best joint, which requires nothing but wiping it well with a clean dry cloth. The shoulder and breast are generally used in two or three days for a pasty. . . . The keeper in general draws the shoulder, which is sure to spoil the neck. The shoulder should not be taken off until quite cold, and then raise it the same as a shoulder of mutton. The fattest venison is the most esteemed. * Good pork is fine grained, fat, and fair; when inferior it is red, coarse, and unsightly.

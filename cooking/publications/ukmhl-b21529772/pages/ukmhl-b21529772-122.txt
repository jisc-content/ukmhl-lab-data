FISH FOR REMOVES. 78 No. 176. Salmon a la Tar tare. Marinade and broil the salmon as in No. 173; mix six yolks of eggs in a round bottomed basin, with half a table-spoonful of made mustard and a little salt; place it on ice, and work in gradually about a pint of the finest olive oil; this would serve for two or three slices: add by degrees a table-spoonful of tarragon vinegar, and one of Chili vinegar, with cayenne pepper and lemon juice.

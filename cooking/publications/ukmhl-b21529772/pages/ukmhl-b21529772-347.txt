Line a dozen and a half of tartelet moulds with short paste (No. 741); fill them with mince meat (No. 746); cover each of these with puff paste, a quarter of an inch thick ; trim them round; make a hole in the middle ; egg them, and bake them in a moderate oven; take them out of the moulds, and send them up hot. No. 862. Windsor Tartelets. Line a dozen and a half of tartelet moulds with very thin tart paste (No. 745) ; fill them with bottled goose- berries, damsons, or other fruit, either bottled or green ; put a little pounded sugar in each; cover them with tart paste, very thin; press them down at the sides, leaving the middle domed; pinch them closely round; trim the edges ; wet the covers, and mask them with pounded sugar; bake them white in a moderate oven. To fill them with stone fruit, pound the stones, boil them in a little syrup, which strain off, and pour a little in each of the tartelets when cold. No. 863. Tartelets a la Conde. Pound three ounces of macaroons and one of ratafias, and pass them through a hair sieve ; add an ounce and a half of sugar pounded fine, and work the whole with two whites of eggs; with this nearly fill tartelet moulds, lined with trimmings of puff paste twice turned ; mask them with sugar, pounded, and with a slight jerk of the hand shake off that which is loose; bake them in a moderate oven; cover them with paper when nearly done, and put them in a hotter part of the oven, so that the crust may be well done.

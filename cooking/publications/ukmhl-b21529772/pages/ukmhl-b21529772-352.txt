308 SWEET ENTEEMETS. No. 875. Spanish Bread. Take eleven yolks, six whites, six ounces of sugar, three of flour, and three of starch powder ; whip the yolks and sugar together with a whisk, till they become quite white and firm; whip up the whites to a strong snow, and mix them lightly with the first ingredients; stir in the flour and starch powder as lightly as possible with a spoon; put it into a tin, six inches long, four wide, and one and a half deep, which lightly butter; put into a very slack oven,—twenty minutes will suffice; turn it out immediately on the back of a hair or wire sieve; the next day cut it up into square pieces. The above quantity should give two dozen.

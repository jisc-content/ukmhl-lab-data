FLANKS, OK LARGE ENTREES. 135 good piece of butter. Cut a fine cucumber in four, pare it, and with a cutter shape it in long round pieces, half an inch thick; sautez these with a small spoonful of salt; drain them and dry them on a napkin, throw them into six ounces of clarified butter, rather warm, and pass them on a moderate fire.

262 PASTES. Work this the same as the preceding, only fraise it one turn more. This paste is used for flanks of fruit and cream. No. 739. Fine Paste (Pate Fine) for Timbales. Three quarters of a pound of flour, eight ounces of butter, two yolks of eggs, and two drachms of salt. Proceed according to the foregoing directions. No. 740. Pat6 Fine (Fine Paste) for Entrde Tourtes. Three quarters of a pound of flour, ten ounces of but- ter, two yolks of eggs, and two drachms of salt. Proceed as in No. 7375 paste for raised pies; let this be a little softer. No. 741. Pate Brisee (Short Paste), or Demi-Puff Paste. Three quarters of a pound of sifted flour, two drachms of salt, two eggs, half a glass of water, and ten ounces of butter ; mix it as puff paste (No. 736), only let this be rather stiffer: the butter must be in pieces; so that having rolled it four times, the same as puff paste, it will have a little of the effect of puff* paste in baking. No. 742. Nouille Paste. Six ounces of sifted flour, in the middle of which a pinch of salt, and seven or eight yolks of eggs ; mix ; the paste should be firm ; fraise it five turns ; cut it in four equal parts, and roll them down as thin as possible ; cut the first sheet in strips two inches wide ; dredge them lightly with flour; place four of these strips on each other, and cut them across as thin as possible; detach them by moving them about a little; put them on covers. They form a sort of vermicelli.

BROTHS AND CONSOMMES. 10 may be aaded. Put also a few slices of ham and a sea- soned faggot, that is, bay-leaves, sweet basil, a couple of cloves, and a few blades of mace, tied in a bunch. If you are about to use truffles with game, add the parings, with mushrooms, to your stock, which strain through a silk sieve for use. No. 5. Blond de Veau, or Veal Gravy, or Brown Stock.

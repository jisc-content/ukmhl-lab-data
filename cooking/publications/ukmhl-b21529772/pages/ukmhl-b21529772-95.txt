51 SOUPS. d 2 two turnips, slice them thin and blanch them; take the white part of two leeks, two heads of celery, and two onions, sliced, and pass the whole over the fire with a piece of lean ham and a little butter ; drain your carrots and turnips when they have been well blanched and cooled; throw them into the stewpan with the other roots, and cover them with a good veal consomme (No. 2), not too brown: put them to simmer, with the crust of a French roll, on a gentle stove till thoroughly done. Then, having carefully skimmed off the fat, pound the whole, which pass, adding a quart or three pints of con- somme, through a tammy. Put this just to boil, then draw it to the corner of the stove. Be most particular in taking off the scum, of which a great quantity rises: this soup must not be thicker than brown sauce (No. 63), and requires a small quantity of sugar. Serving the soup a second time, you may add any of the Italian pastes, or rice, as directed in No. 111. No. 121. Aurora Soup. This soup is made from the outside only of the short- horn carrots, generally the first in season ; these require no blanching, but are passed in a stewpan with one onion, butter and ham, and the crust of one French roll. The rest as above. No. 122. Green Peas Soup. Take three pints of green peas, not too old, and let them sweat thoroughly on the fire with a faggot of green onions, parsley, a little mint, and a quarter of a pound of ham. When done, pound and moisten them with a good white stock (No. 2) to about the same consistence as the other puree soups. Set this to boil gently about twenty minutes at the corner of the stove, and skim well. When

SAUCES. 25 of the quantity used remain. Make up the quantity thus reduced with boiling cream. When well incor- porated, pass it through the tammy into a stewpan, which put in the bain marie. Work in a little fresh butter. This sauce should be thicker than cream, luscious and savoury. No. 46. Bdchamel Sauce. Take some of the preceding sauce, which reduce nearly one-half. Replenish with boiling cream ; reduce again, on a brisk fire, till the sauce is brought to the con- sistency of double cream. Strain it through the tammy, work a little butter, and put it in the bain marie. For Meager Bechamel, boil a quart of milk, quite new ; melt a piece of butter, of the size of an egg, with which mix enough sifted flour to make a white roux: dilute it with a fourth of the milk, and pour in the re- mainder by intervals. When the whole boils, put the bechamel at the corner of the stove, add the red part of a carrot, an onion, a bunch of parsley, a few eschalots, thyme, bay-leaf, sweet basil, and a little salt. Let it simmer an hour, pass it through the tammy, and reduce it on a strong fire : add, if you think proper, salt, a little nutmeg, and a piece of butter. Pass it through a tam- my to serve with fish. It should be of the consistence of thick cream. \ ou may add mushroom parings. No. 47. Allemande, or German Sauce. Have some veloute (No. 44), which stir till boiling on a brisk fire; let it reduce till it thickly masks the spoon with which you stir it. Add a liaison (No. 22). Stir theun well with the reduced veloute, which will curdle if it boil after the liaison is added ; when well mixed, pass the whole through the tammy, work in a little butter, and put it in the bain marie. c

FLANK'S, OR LARGE ENTREES. 133 fuls of seasoned butter on this; add mushrooms and sliced truffles, and the soft roes, between which the remainder of the oysters and two spoonfuls of the butter: above these range the fillets of soles, the remainder of the truffles and mushrooms. Mask the whole with the rest of the butter and two bay-leaves. Finish as before- Bake an hour and a quarter. To serve, take away the bay-leaves, all the liquor, and mask with a ragout of cray-fish tails, mushrooms, a few truffles, sauced with a thin Spanish sauce (No. 64) thick- ened with lobster butter (No. 27), or tomata sauce (No. 75) also thickened with lobster butter. This is a delicious dish. No. 334. Raised Pie of Fillets of Whitings Stuffed. Raise the fillets of fifteen middle-sized whitings; wash and trim them; without taking off the skin, spread them out on the table. Season them well with salt, rough pepper, and nutmeg. Lightly mask them with a little farce fine of fish, with lobster butter (No. 27), truffles, or mushrooms. Then roll each fillet on itself, from the most fleshy end, that it may be round; line the bottom and sides of the crust with the same farce of fillets, and place, upright, ten fillets, which should cover the bottom. Mask these with two spoonfuls of butter scarcely melted; place over these ten more, then butter; the last ten, and four spoonfuls of butter and two bay-leaves. Finish and bake an hour and a quarter. To serve, skim off the fat, take off the bay-leaves, and mask with a ragout of soft roes of carp, oysters, cray-fish tails, mushrooms, and bottoms of artichokes, sauced with a tomata sauce (No. 75), or a thin brown sauce (No. 64). For fillets of soles you would proceed in the same way, though you would skin these: the flesh is more solid than that of the whiting, and would keep together better in baking. u

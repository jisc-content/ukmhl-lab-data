68 sours. with cream, as it may require, which you ascertain by blanching a little of it. Pass the whole through a hair or wire sieve; season with a little pepper, salt, and nut- meg, very moderately. Form your quenelles by rolling them on the table dusted with a little flour, to the thickness of your little finger, and cut them about an inch long. Put them, when blanched, in two quarts of chicken consomme (No. 3). No. 150. Brunoise Soup. Cut the red part of three or four carrots, with two or three turnips, into small dice. When these vegetables are very young, they are merely sweated down with a piece of butter, ham, and a little sugar, without being blanched or separately boiled, as is done in No. 139. Cut three cabbage lettuces and a handful of sorrel in small squares, with a little butter and a piece of ham, over the stove; sweat them over a brisk fire, and when drained, add them to the carrots and turnips. Fill up with two quarts of clear brown consomme (No. 5), and put it at the corner of the stove to throw up its scum. In this hang a small faggot of chervil. A few minutes before serving, add asparagus peas, green peas, and French beans, blanched, and the latter cut small, to suit the others. Serve with the crust of a French roll, cut to your idea, but put it in the tureen only just before serving. Add a few button onions if agreeable. No. 151. Julienne Soup. This soup is precisely the same as the foregoing. The only difference is the addition of a head or two of celery, a leek, and the shape to which the vegetables are cut: these ought to be in shreds about an inch long, and one line thick.

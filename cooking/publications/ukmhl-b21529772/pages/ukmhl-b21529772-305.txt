Three pounds of flour, four yolks of eggs, a pound and a quarter of butter, and an ounce of salt. Sift three pounds of flour; make a hole in the middle, in which put an ounce of salt, four yolks of eggs, a pound and a quarter of butter, worked in winter, and a glass of water; mix the butter and the liquid first, then the flour, which gradually moisten, mixing and pressing it lightly; then fraise it, once in summer, and twice or three times in winter, that is, rub the whole by degrees between the wrists and the dresser till it becomes a uniform body of paste, firm, but not tough ; spread the paste out, and sprinkle a few drops of water on it, to moisten it to point, but beware of making it too soft; work it; gather up a fourth of it, which press firmly between the hands and the board; in about a minute it will become very malleable; do the same with the other quarters ; put them one on the other, mix the whole, and put it in a damp napkin if not used immediately. Quickness is an essential point in this operation, as the heat of the hands, especially in summer, is very unfavourable to this paste; it occasions it to break in working it; when such is the case, cut it in slices; moisten these lightly at the surface, and mix again ; put it in a damp napkin, and set it aside half an hour. The wetting to point is the main difficulty in this paste. No. /38. Paste for Hot Raised Pies.

Take the hind quarters, that is, the saddle and tv o legs together, of a lamb; trim off the shank bones as short as possible; take out the two ribs from under the saddle; the skin of the saddle you will carefully trim off, as well as the fat which covers the flesh on both sides of the chine; take off a piece of sldn as large as the palm of your hand from each of the thighs, at the back part; lard these and the fillets of the saddle carefully. Put the lamb on the spit; cover it with buttered paper, which fix with string, be careful not to crush the larded parts. A few minutes before you take it up, sprinkle salt over it, and flour over the parts which are not larded; the larding you glaze with a liwht and thin glaze, that they may have a nice colour. Serve with a sauce a la poulette (No. o3), or a maitie d'hotel (No. 5-1), or simply with its own gravy. 1 •: , « See note to No. 29.

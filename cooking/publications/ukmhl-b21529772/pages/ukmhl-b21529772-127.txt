83 FISH FOR REMOVES. parsley, and salad oil; season with pepper and salt: fill the incision with this; what remains put under and over the mackarel, with a sufficient quantity of oil to keep it all moist. Let them lie in this marinade three hours before broiling : let the gridiron be quite hot, oil the bars, and put your mackarel to broil, having first taken out the herbs; let them he done on both sides and on the back. When done, take out the back-bone, cutting it through near the head and tail, and taking it out without dis- figuring the fish. Into this introduce a cold maitre d’hotel sauce, thus prepared:—a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, worked with a little chopped eschalot, tarra- gon, if approved of, fennel, and parsley, with pepper, salt, cayenne, and lemon-juice. Dish them carefully, and serve them with a maitre cfhotel sauce (No. 54), adding a little chopped fennel. No. 190. Mackarel the Italian way. Take the soft roes from five or six fine mackarel, through the opening at the gills. Put them into a stew- pan, and cover them with clarified butter; add pepper and salt, and put them into a sharp oven ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. When done, put them in a cool place till wanted. Cut off the tails, ends, and noses of the mackarel close to the eyes, and pass your knife along the backs about half an inch deep. Put them into a stewpan, with a slice under them, and add half a bottle of white wine, with a few slices of onions, a few slices of carrot, sprigs of parsley, half a bay-leaf, and salt. Let them stew gently, and when done drain them ; draw out the back-bones; dish them ; garnish with the soft roes, which must be made hot and drained on a napkin. Sauce with a white Italian (No. 49), mixed with a little of the liquor reduced, and serve.

Prepare the croustade as above, form it with seven ribs; let it be lined an inch thick with farce. Bone seven quails; lightly glaze them with glaze of fowl or game : season with a little salt and nutmeg. Put a little farce in each of them, and place one in each rib of the croustade. Fill the middle with farce : insert one claw in the middle of each quail. The quails must rise more than half an inch above the sides of the croustade, the sides and top of which line with sliced fat bacon. Sur- round it with strong paper, which tie on, with buttered paper on top. Bake it in a moderate oven about an hour; when the quails are firm, take it out. Take off the bacon, and the farce from the middle. To serve, put it on the dish, and turn into the middle a ragout of combs, kidneys, truffles, or mushrooms; glaze the sides of the croustade and the quails; put on each a ring formed of small fillets of chicken, decorated with scolloped truffles, and in this a black truffle, of the size of a nut- meg ; through each of which pass a claw to fix them. A mushroom may be placed in the same way. With larks, snipes, partridges, and pigeons, au gratin, proceed in the same way.

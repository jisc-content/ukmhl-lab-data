SAUCES. 44 Season with pepper and salt, and rub it through the tammy. No. 101. Celery Sauce. Celery sauce is made in the same way as the preceding; the celery is cut much larger, and instead of a thorough reduction and rubbing through the tammy, work in a little butter kneaded with flour; season with a little pepper and salt, adding two or three spoonfuls of cream and a little glaze. No. 102. White Puree of Onions, or Soubise. Slice a dozen middle-sized onions, throw them in cold water as you cut them; blanch them in plenty of water: when tender, cool and drain them ; squeeze them dry in a cloth. Put them in a stewpan, and stir them over a fire to dry out the remainder of the liquor; add half a pint of cream, and a spoonful of sauce tournee (No. 43); work in a piece of butter as large as a walnut, kneaded with a little flour: season with pepper and salt and a little glaze; rub the whole through the tammy, and keep it hot in the bain marie. No. 103. Endive Puree. Take about two dozen heads, according to the size; blanch and cool them, drain them dry, and chop them fine; put them into a small stewpan with a ladle-ful of white consomme (No. 2), a piece of ham, and a knob of sugar. When the whole lias boiled till tender, put it into a large stewpan and reduce it, adding a little butter and flour, kneaded together, some pepper and salt, and a little cream. When sufficiently reduced, put it into the bain marie to keep hot.

SAUCES. 39 No. 88. Chipolata. Take the same ingredients as for the white financiere (No. 80â€™) ; have them of much smaller size; add small pork sausages, a few small chesnuts boiled in a little con- somme (No. 2), a few combs cut out of streaky bacon. Throw these into a sauce tourne (No. 43). No. 89. Brown Financiere. The ingredients are the same as for the white finan- ciere (No. 86), worked in a good double Espagnole (No. 64), well truffled, rather stronger in wine, and not so thick. No. 90. Chambord Garnish for Fish, Is again Composed of the same ingredients as the financiere (No. 86). It requires double the quantity of wine, and the quenelles must be made of fish forcemeats (No. 35). Work your garnish with a little anchovy butter, and, when dished, decorate with cray fish, from the tails of which you have taken the shells ; you will take off the small claws also. The marinade in which your fish has been boiled is usually reduced and added ; however, you would only use the whole of it when you have a less luscious fish. Salmon is rich and oily, and it would render the sauce so, if too much of the liquor were used. No. 91* Godard Sauce. This sauce is made with the ingredients used for the brown financiere (No. 89), with the addition of a few young pigeons and lambs1 sweatbreads, larded with truffles and bacon : these must be braised by themselves first, and are used to decorate the ragout.

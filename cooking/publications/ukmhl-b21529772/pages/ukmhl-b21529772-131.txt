87 FISH FOR REMOVES. No. 200. Carp an Bleu, or with Court Bouillon. Clean a carp, -without opening the belly too much, and without damaging the scales. Take out the gills without spoiling the tongue; place it in a kettle that will just hold it. Boil half a pint of red vinegar, with which sprinkle the carp, to give it a blue colour, being careful to use it boiling. Stew it in a court bouillon ; to make which fry some sliced carrots, two or three, as many onions, and some parsley, with a little butter, till brown; to these add two bottles of port, and half as much water, a seasoned faggot (No. 16), with a little sweet basil. Stew these an hour, and strain the moisture for use. Vinegar is sometimes used, but only when wine is scarce. Dish the carp on a napkin, and send up anchovy sauce in a boat. No. 201. Pike au Bleu. See carp au bleu (No. 200). No. 202. Pike a la Chambord. Scale the pike; to do which, hold the tail in one hand, and run a knife from you, along each side of the fish, between the two skins. Let it be thoroughly cleansed from the blood. Take off some pieces of skin from the sides, and lard the places thus uncovered. Bake the pike in a wine marinade, composed of sliced carrots, onions, mushroom parings, parsley, a sprig of thyme, and a bay-leaf, a blade of mace, a couple of cloves, and a few pepper-corns. Pass this on the fire with a little ham, butter, and a scraped horse-radish. When this has well sweated, pour in half a bottle of white wine, and a ladle- ful of consomme: boil this half an hour, and put it into a baking dish with the pike. Twist the fish as you would

SAUCES. 40 No. 92. Macedoine. Take all sorts of roots and vegetables, such as carrots, turnips, button onions, cucumbers, peas, French beans, asparagus, peas, knobs of cauliflower, artichoke bottoms, &c.: these are blanched and boiled separately, and cut in small fancy shapes. When the whole are done, they are drained and put together in a stewpan, and covered with supreme sauce# (No. 45). No. 93. Jardiniere, or Gardener's Sauce. Take roots and vegetables as above, only they are cut larger, and dished in small heaps, each vegetable in a separate heap, in one dish. You previously blanch and reduce the carrots, turnips, onions, and cucumbers, to a glaze, separately; the others are merely blanched till tender, and drained. Add bechamel sauce (No. 46), but do not mask any vegetable except the cauliflower with it. No. 94. Flemish Sauce. Cut some carrots, turnips, and cucumbers, rather large; blanch and boil them separately; blanch and boil some button onions and some large Spanish onions ; the latter must simmer gently and steadily till they come to a half glaze : they must not be broken. Put all except the Spanish onions into a stewpan with a ladle-ful of double Espagnole (No. 64) : let the whole simmer at the corner of the stove; skim and add a little sugar and glaze: keep it in the bain marie for use. When you serve, put your Spanish onions and pieces of cauliflower, well boiled, round the dish at equal distances. * Livernoise sauce is the same as the preceding one, only use double Espagnole instead of supreme sauce.

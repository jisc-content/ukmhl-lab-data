SAVOURY ENTREMETS. 257 two; separate the whites from the yolks; pound the yolks with a quarter of a pound of butter, salt, a little grated nutmeg, spices, and three raw yolks; slice the whites thin, put them into bechamel sauce (No. 46), reduced and warm ; sautez them without letting them boil ; let them be rather thick; dish them; take the yolks from the mortar, put them on the bottom of a large sieve, and rub them through on what you have dished; garnish with bread cut in corks, and fried; colour the whole lightly with the salamander, wipe the border of the dish, and serve. No. 727. Plain Omelette. Break half a dozen eggs in a basin ; season with salt; add a little water ; beat them well up ; melt in a frying- pan a piece of butter as large as a walnut; do not let it be brown ; pour in the omelette, beating it still; place the pan over a clear sharp fire; expose the sides more than the middle of the pan to the heat, shaking it to and fro, that it may not burn; when nearly done, put a small piece of butter between the omelette and the pan, fold the omelette, and, when nicely coloured, turn it on the dish, and serve. No. 728. Omelette with Fines Ilerbes. As the above; with the addition of salt, pepper, and a table-spoonful of fines herbes, an ounce of butter broken in small pieces, and a cup of cream ; dish it, and pour a little brown sauce (No. 63) round the edge. No. 729. Omelette with Sorrel. Serve a plain omelette (No. 727)> with two spoonfuls of sorrel puree (No. 99) put into it when you fold it; glaze the omelette, and serve.

227 XIV. ENTREES OF LAMB. No. 624. Lamb Cutlets. These are prepared in the various ways described for cutlets of mutton. They should not, however, be served as a haricot. No. 625. Breasts of Lamb in Cutlets. Cut off the red bone which runs along the tendons, and braise the breast in a strong braise; when done so that the bone would readily come from the flesh without the assistance of the knife, take them out with a slice, place them between two dishes, and let them cool. Cut through the tendon, dividing the breast into cutlets, having two or three ribs in each ; cut them so as to leave the end of a rib projecting about an inch from the middle of the thin end of the cutlet; trim off the skin and fat, and pare the edges round : put them into a deep saute pan with a little consomme; cover them with a sheet of paper, and make them hot in the oven. Glaze them ; dish them en miroton : serve them with a puree of sorrel, tomatas, endive, or celery. You may also orna- ment them with small heaps of vegetables, in season, cut in short columns, or in balls the size of cherries. Sauce with clear brown consomme. You may then call them the gardenerâ€™s way. No. 626. Breast of Lamb in Cutlets with Stewed Lettuce. Prepare the cutlets as above: serve them with stewed lettuce (see No. 594); glaze the cutlets, and mask the lettuce with a good brown sauce (No. 64).

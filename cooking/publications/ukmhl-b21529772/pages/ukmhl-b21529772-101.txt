57 sours. d 5 sweat in a good sized pot, and on them place as much of the tender parts of the turtle as you can, and fill up with common broth made from a leg or brisket of beef; the remaining parts put into a pot by themselves; fill up with the best broth you have to spare. In each pot put a good faggot of basil, a little thyme, two bay-leaves, a little winter savory, parsley, a few large onions stuck with six cloves, carrots, and two or three heads of celery: keep your pots well skimmed and gently boiling. Season with a little allspice, long and whole pepper, a few blades of mace, and a little salt. As soon as the softer parts can be separated from the bones, they must be taken off, the bones returned to the pots, and the meat put on flat dishes to cool. Make a roux, scarcely brown (No. 41), in proportion to the quantity of your sauce : if your meat be thoroughly done in your stock-pot, strain it off through a lawn sieve, and mix your roux as for an ordinary sauce, but much thinner. When it boils, draw it to the corner of the stove to clarify. In the mean time cut up your turtle into pieces about an inch square (and not two inches square, as suggested by some gallant, who probably for- got those small delicate mouths from which such pieces would be excluded but for the trouble of further cutting) ; two of the fins are generally kept for flanks. Put your turtle into a stewpan and strain your sauce over it. Boil two bottles of Madeira or good sherry down to half the quantity, and throw it into the soup, with as much of the puree of herbs as the quantity may require ; with this add the stock of the second pot, reduced to a half glaze. b or the puree, take a good handful of sweet basil, a little marjoram, winter savory, all of them green, a little thyme, two or three bay-leaves, a pottle of mushrooms, a little parsley, a large onion cut in slices, half a dozen eschalots, four anchovies, a few blades of mace, allspice,

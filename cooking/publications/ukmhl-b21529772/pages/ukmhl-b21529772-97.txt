Moisten the puree with the con- somme; rub this through a tammy ; after which it must be made thin enough, by adding more stock, to allow all impurities to rise in boiling gently at the corner of the stove. This soup you must keep as red as possible. Serve with bread in dice. No. 125. Puree of Cucumber Soup. Take six or seven fine young cucumbers; cut three or four of them in parts about an inch long, each of which divide in three equally, cutting from one end to the other: cut off the rind of these and the seedy inside ; trim the edges. You must not use within an inch of that end of the cucumber next the stalk, as it has a very earthy flavour. Throw your cucumbers into cold water as you prepare them; blanch and drain them dry; then boil them in a little good consomme (No. 2) to a half glaze, with a piece of ham and sugar. This process must be quickly gone through, or they would boil to a pap. Pare and cut out the middles of the remaining cucum- bers : slice them, and fry them with half an onion and butter in a three quart stewpan. Be careful that these take no colour. Add a quart of good white stock (No. 2), the crust of a French roll, well rasped, together with a quarter of a pound of York ham. When these are tho- roughly done, take out the ham, skim your soup, and pass it through a fine tammy; put it back into a soup pot, and add about a pint of sauce tournee (No. 43). When this has boiled about twenty minutes, throw in the cucumbers first prepared, and mix the whole with a liaison (No. 22) of eight yolks of eggs, with a little cream and butter.

No. 826. Savoy Biscuit. Fourteen fine eggs, one pound of sugar, the zest of an orange, and seven ounces of potatoe flour. Put the whites of the eggs, which break one by one, lest there be a bad one, in an earthen pan, and the yolks in another. Weigh a pound of fine sugar, on which you have rubbed the zest of an orange ; let it be perfectly dry when used. Put half a pound of this in the yolks, and stir them up, so as to leave no lumps; add the remainder, and work it well twenty minutes; whip the whites very firm; but, to prevent their turning to snow, add a good pinch of cal- cined and pulverised alum. When sufficiently whipped, which you will know by the whites forming little risings where the whisk is taken out, take some of them on the whisk, and mix them with the yolks; work the whites still, or they will turn to snow: pour the yolks gently to the whites, which stir with the whisk ; pass the whole through the tammy, and over this seven ounces of po- tatoe &flour, which mix as you pass it. The mixture should run from the spoon, forming a thread smooth and thin. Thin a few spoonfuls of the paste, which pour into the bottom of the mould, that no air may remain, which would cause air bubbles on the biscuit when done; put the remainder of the paste in the mould, and place it on a baking sheet; on this you previously put ashes an inch thick: put the biscuit in the middle of a mode- rate oven, which keep close an hour.

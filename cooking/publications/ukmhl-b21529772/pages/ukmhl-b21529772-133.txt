89 VII. LARGE REMOVES. No. 204. Rump of Beef Braised. Prepare a brown braise (No. 13). Take a fine rump of beef, bone it, and tie it up. Break the bones, and put them with the beef into the braise, which should moisten it to three-fourths of its thickness. The outside part of the beef is placed downwards ; close your braising pan, and when it boils, put it on a back stove to simmer: turn it in an hour and a half. There must be fire on the top: let it remain two hours and a half more. It must be perfectly tender. When done take it out on the slice ; let it drain : trim it, and cut off the strings; glaze it, and put it in the oven two or three minutes; glaze it again, and dish it up. It sometimes requires three coats of glaze. No. 205. Braised Rump of Beef au Naturel. As the above, served with a little consomme under it, a few greens, carrots, and turnips, plain boiled. No. 206. Braised Rump of Beef with Sauer Krout. Prepare some sauer krout (No. 96), which lay thickly and closely round the beef (No. 204). No. 207. Braised Rump of Beef in the Italian way. Dish your beef (No. 204) with a good chopped sauce (No. 69). No. 208. Braised Rump of Beef in the Flemish way. Dish your beef (No. 204), and serve with a Flemish sauce (No. 93).

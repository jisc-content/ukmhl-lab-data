SOUPS. 59 with half a pound of ham in slices ; on your ham put a couple of knuckles of veal and about two pounds of shin of beef, half an old hen, and a couple of calf’s feet. It is better to put your roots after boiling down your soup, as then they cannot burn, which, if they did, would greatly injure the flavour of the broth. Add a ladle-ful of the calf’s head liquor, and let the whole sweat down till reduced to a slight glaze; then fill up with common broth (No. 1), or the liquor in which the head was boiled: when this has boiled up, skim it, season with a good faggot of turtle herbs and parsley, a couple of carrots, three large onions stuck with four cloves, a blade or two of mace, black pepper, and a little allspice. Make a light roux (No. 41) with about a quarter of a pound of butter, which dilute with your stock when done a little thinner than melted butter; throw in a handful of mushroom parings, and stir over the fire till it boils : set it to clarify at the side of the stove; skim it well and strain it over the calf’s head, to which add about a pint of Madeira (which must be boiled), the juice of a lemon, and cayenne. You will have prepared forcemeat balls of quenelle farce of veal (No. 34), seasoned with a few chopped turtle herbs, and a few fines herbes (No. 10) : these quenelles must be more highly seasoned than they generally are. For egg balls take the yolks of six eggs boiled hard, which pound with the yolk of one raw one, a piece of butter as large as a yolk; seasoned with salt, pepper, and a little nutmeg, and throw into the soup a few minutes before serving.* These and the forcemeat balls arc formed by rolling them on the dres- ser with a little flour, and then blanch them in boiling water.

46 SAUCES. No. 107. Purte of Truffles* Chop about a pound of peeled truffles. Bear in mind that converting your truffles into a puree will not prove a cure for a musky flavour, should any of them be tainted with it; and in this they will not prove less disagreeable than they would in any other form in which you might serve truffles. Having chopped them, put them with a little game, or chicken consomme (No. 3 and 4), accord- ing to what they are intended for; let them simmer gently with a very small piece of garlick, half a bay-leaf, and a piece of ham. If for game, add a glass of Ma- deira. When done, take out the bay-leaf, ham, and garlick, and pound the rest fine, adding a spoonful or two of double Espagnole (No. 64), and rub them through a tammy : add a little more Espagnole after this. Your puree should be of the consistency of sorrel sauce. No. 108. Puree of Tomatas. This is made exactly as Tomata sauce, but it requires to be reduced much more. No. 109. Puree of Mushrooms. Turn as many mushrooms as you may want, and put them in water and lemon juice to keep them white. Chop them with a little lemon juice, and pass them in a stew- pan with a small piece of butter; let them sweat a few minutes, and add a little supreme (No. 45), or becha- mel (No. 46). They become black if they boil too long. Rub them through the tammy. f l saw ti)is puree nouvelle served by that much esteemed cook, M. I\lcra, at the then Marquis, now Duke, of Clevelandâ€™s, five years ago. It is served under entries of chicken, game, &c.

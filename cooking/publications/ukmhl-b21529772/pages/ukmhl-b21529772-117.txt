SOUPS. No. 164-. Puree of Venison Soup. The method is precisely the same as shown in No. 162; using the flesh of a roast haunch or neck used the day before. No. 165. Queeiis Soup. Well butter a sheet of strong white kitchen paper; cover it all over with a thin layer of fat bacon: slice a small carrot thin, and a couple of onions, which put on the bacon, with a little parsley, a sprig of thyme, a blade of mace, and a bay-leaf pulled in pieces, two or three cloves, and a few pepper-corns. Wrap this round two pullets, putting a small piece of butter inside each, and placing them in a line, the breast ends together; tie them up with twine, put a lark spit through them, and tie them on your meat spit: these require nearly an hour: baste them well to prevent the paper from burning. When they are done, tear off the skins; take the flesh from the bones; throw the bones into a chicken stock, which you have prepared from the flesh; trim away all fat and nerves; chop them, and immediately pound them, with the yolks of four hard eggs, and the crumb of a French roll, soaked in a light chicken consomme (No. 3), with which moisten your puree, and rub it through a tammy: put it in a stewpan, with half a pint of cream, which has been just boiled and skimmed; set it on the fire till hot,â€”but by no means boiling, or it will surely curdle; do not leave off stirring; skim, and put it au bain marie. Previous to serving, add a little butter, which work in. You should have rather more than two quarts of soup; add bread fried in dice to a gold colour. If expence be an object, use the legs only, leaving the fillets for an entree; or use a fowl previously served. Many add a few almonds to the fowl when pounded. This soup is also served with rice or vermicelli.

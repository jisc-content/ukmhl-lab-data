COMPLETE MODERN COOK. REMARKS ON THE REGULATION AND MANAGEMENT OF A LARDER. Without cleanliness and order, a larder is of no use more than any other place where provisions might be heaped together. Every morning, and most especially in the summer season, let all the shelves and dressers be scoured and washed with cold water. The cold meat must be put on fresh dishes, in the most airy place : look to all the soups and sauces, and see if they want boiling up, a thing which should be done every morning in close and sultry weather. Let the pans into which you afterwards put them be perfectly dry, or they will assuredly turn sour. The strictest and most minute attention is requisite in this respect. Should they begin to turn, the best way is to boil them down to a half glaze, which will answer every purpose of stock, by adding water to it as you want it. When you put the sauce on to boil, do not omit to add a little stock, to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the stewpan. Whatever is done in braises in the summer should be made stronger than in winter, or they will not keep to be of service. u

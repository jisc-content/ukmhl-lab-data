Prepare some bottoms of artichokes, very white; cut them in pieces, and throw them into the sauce, as in No. 471, after you have passed it; keep one bottom whole; cut the edge fancifully; place it on the top, and fill it with a little sauce. The artichokes being used instead of mushrooms is the only difference between this and No. 471. No. 474. Fricassee of Chickens a la Perigord. Proceed as in No. 471; only use a fat liver in scollops, and truffles, instead of mushrooms. With the point of a knife scrape a small piece of garlick, which work into the sauce. The fillets may be larded with truffles, and braised; these are done apart, and dished on the top of the fricassee. No. 475. Fricassee of Chickens a la Chevalier. Cut up and prepare the fricassee as in No. 47I, with the exception of the fillets; you will cut off the skins of these; lard them neatly with bacon fat, and lay them in a stewpan with slices of fat bacon at the bottom, a sliced onion, carrot, a seasoned faggot, and a little consomme; set them on a stove to boil; when boiling, take them off, and put burning embers on the top; glaze the larding well, and dish them on the top of the fricassee, after you have sauced it. The under fillets may also be larded, baked, glazed, and served with these.

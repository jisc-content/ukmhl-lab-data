7 MANAGEMENT OF A LARDER. POULTRY". Poultry must be kept as cool as possible: it keeps much better with the breast downwards, on a shelf or marble slab, than hung up. The crop and the gut of the rump are taken out. Take fowls with a thin transparent skin, white and delicate. Pigeons are scarcely fit for a delicate stomach when full fledged, as they are hard to digest. With regard to turkeys, while I had the honour of serving T. W. Coke, Esq., of Holkham-hall, Norfolk, I had an opportunity of witnessing the good effects of keep- ing turkies wild, as they are kept by that gentleman, to whom they afford the same sport as any other bird in cover. This is the red American turkey, which is far superior in flavour to any other. The only way to obtain any thing like them is with the brown Norfolk turkey, which must be cooped up four days previous to being killed. The first day after feeding as usual, an entire walnut with the shell, and having been soaked twelve hours in water, must be crammed down the birdâ€™s throat. The second day after let it have two more walnuts in the same way, and three on each of the two following days. This is for roasting only. The flesh becomes darker, and takes a flavour of game, which has been greatly approved of.

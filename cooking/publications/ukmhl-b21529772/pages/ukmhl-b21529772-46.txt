2 MANAGEMENT OF A LAEDEE. All lardings, if they return to the kitchen whole, should be put in the braise in which they were done, and covered with the layers of bacon used to cover them in the stew- pan. Tendons of veal and lamb, ox-tail, rump of beef, in short, all the different articles usually done in braises, should be taken particular care of, and the same attention should be paid to putting by those dishes that may be served again, as in dressing the dinner ; for these may be equally as good and serviceable the second time as the first. All dressed meat intended to be kept until cold, whether boiled or roast, should be thoroughly done, particularly in summer; for if the gravy be left in either, it will not keep more than two or three days, but if done quite dr}, it will keep a week or longer. Roast meat should be well sprinkled with salt before taken from the fire, and boiled beef that is intended to be eaten cold should be at least fourteen days in salt; if a few days longer it will eat all the better when boiled; if not well salted, being boiled rather more than it would be to be sent to table hot, it will eat insipid. For undressed meat, when in the country in summer, and the meat is not killed at home, have the meat brought in as early as possible in the morning, not later than six if within a few miles; otherwise, when the heat of the day is advanced, it is almost impossible to prevent it from being fly blown.

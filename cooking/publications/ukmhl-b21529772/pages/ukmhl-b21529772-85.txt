SAUCES. 41 No. 95. Sauer Krout. This article is generally bought ready-made at the Italian warehouses. I will give the receipt for those who feel disposed to make it themselves. Pick off the outer leaves of some white winter cab- bages ; cut the cabbages up in shreds with a knife, or plane made on purpose, if you make a great quantity. Put your cabbage to ferment in a tub, twelve hours at least, and twenty-four at most; after which press the moisture from it as much as possible. Cylindrical stone jars are the best things that you can use to put them in. If you have not these, take a cask with the head out. Mix a few juniper berries or carraway seeds with your cabbage. Put a layer of salt in the bottom of the cask, over which a layer of cabbage four or five inches thick. Lay them evenly, and press them as closely down as you can : con- tinue thus to fill the cask within an inch or two, with alternate layers of salt and cabbage. Cover the top with a layer of salt: on this place a lid, as large as the head of the tub. Place heavy stones on the lid. Mind they must not be calcareous stones, or the acid would eat into and dissolve part of them. As soon as a crust is formed on the moisture produced from the cabbage, your sauer krout is fit for use. As it must not come in contact with the air, and the cover is smaller than the tub, press a wet towel in round the edge, which wash in cold water every time you have to take out sauer krout. You must carefully wipe with a dry cloth those parts of the tub that are left dry as your sauer krout gets lower. There is enough moisture when it covers the cabbage. Your cover must be stout and strong, and entirely of wood. Keep your sauer krout

SOUPS. 16 and cut the head off with a strong and very keen knife : this is done by skilful hands in one cut. An assistant should hold the fins; the body is then suspended by the hind fins, that it may drain into a vessel placed under it; then probe the knife into the thin part behind the back fins, which will let the air escape and hasten the extinc- tion of sensation in the turtle.

Wash the shells before blanching them. Pick out the green fat from the shoulders and sides of the turtle, and cut out the remains of the hind fins and neck bone, which must be done by twisting and then cutting them ; tear the lungs away from the back; wash the flesh in cold water, and blanch the parts adhering to the shell in a pot of boiling water, which must be in readi- ness : you will saw the pieces to a convenient size.

Put on a good stock, according to the size of your turtle and quantity of soup to be made : for your stock use a leg and two or three knuckles of veal, an old lien or two, a knuckle of ham, four calves feet; let these

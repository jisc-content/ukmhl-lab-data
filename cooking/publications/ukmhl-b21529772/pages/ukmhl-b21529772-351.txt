SWEET ENTREMETS. 307 deep : decorate them by glazing them to your fancy ; add any flavour you like. No. 871. Genoises Pralinees with Almonds. They are the same as above, masked with almonds chopped fine, sugar, and white of egg ; they are dried in the oven. No. 872. Genoises Rough Sugared. When the Genoises are baked dip them in sugar done to a crack, and rough sugar them. No. 873. Madelaines, Lemon Flavour. Put into a stewpan nine ounces of fine sugar, flavoured with zest of lemon, eight of sifted flour, four yolks and six eggs, two spoonfuls of rum or brandy, and a little salt; stir well; when the paste is mixed only stir one minute longer, more would do harm; clarify ten ounces of butter; when cooled a little fill a Madelaine mould with it; pour this into another, thus lining eight moulds ; then pour what remains back into the stewpan ; thus butter thirty-two moulds ; add the remaining butter to the paste, which place over a gentle fire ; stir, and when it begins to be liquid take it off, fill the moulds, and put them in a moderate oven : if they rise too much it is fiom working the paste too much before or after the addition of the butter; in twenty-five minutes they should be firm; if nicely coloured draw them. No. 874. Madelaines with Currants. When you are about to fill the moulds as above mix in the paste some fine currants, well dried at the mouth of the oven.

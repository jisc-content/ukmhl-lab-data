115 VIII. FLANKS, OR SMALL REMOVES. No. 287- Fillet of Beef Larded. Take the inside fillet of a sirloin of beef, and lard it from one end to the other, leaving a piece of the fat at the side; then marinade it in oil, salt, pepper, sliced onion, bay-leaf, and parsley, four-and-twenty hours. Braise it as you would a fricandeau (No. 294). Glaze it, and serve under it a poor manâ€™s sauce (No. 67), and po- tatoes cut round of the size of marbles. No. 288. Fillet of Beef Braised in Madeira. Cut the fillet from the sirloin or ribs, trim it neatly, and lard it as the foregoing. Bottom a stewpan with a few carrots and onions sliced, and a seasoned faggot. Put round the stewpan slices of fat bacon; place the fillet on the vegetables, with half a pound of grated bacon fat; moisten with half a bottle of Madeira, and as much con- somme : add a little salt, and set it on a strong fire. When it begins to boil, cover it with thick buttered paper, put a cover on the stewpan, with red-hot embers on top, and slacken with ashes the fire which is under, so that it may simmer gently. When done, or nearly so, pass the greater part of the liquor through a silk sieve, and put it in a stewpan with a ragout spoonful of Spanish sauce (No. 63). Let the whole reduce to the consistency of a demi-glaze; drain the fillet, glaze it, and dish it neatly. Finish the reduction with a little butter and sugar; pass it through a tammy, and serve it round the beef. No. 289. Fillet of Beef with Cucumbers, Is the same as No. 287, with cucumber sauce instead

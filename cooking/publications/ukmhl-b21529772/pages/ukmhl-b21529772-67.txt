23 IV. SAUCES. No. 41. White Roux, or Thickening. Clarify four ounces of butter, with which mix about eight table-spoonfuls of flour in a stewpan, on a slow fire ; stir it well with a wooden spoon till perfectly smooth. Be particularly careful that it is not deeper coloured than cream. Place it over a dead fire a quarter of an hour, stirring occasionally; you may use it directly if wanted, or it will keep, for which purpose put it in a pot. The above, when mixed with about five pints of stock, will be of the consistence of cream. No. 42. Brown Roux, or Thickening. As above, observing that you use six table-spoonfuls of flour, as it must not be so thick. Make this on a rather stronger fire, and let it take a nut brown colour very gradually: be careful that it does not burn, for the slightest catch would cause it to be speckled with dark spots, andyembitter your sauces. No. 43. Sauce Tournee.* Add boiling veal consomme to some white roux, not over the fire, mix it well in, then add consomme gradually rill your sauce is of the consistency of good melted butter ; put it on a brisk fire, stirring without interruption; let it * Sauce yournde and vcloute are not the same, nor lias the latter name been substituted by the moderns for the former. Sauce tournde is of itself an unfinished sauce; it is of itself a basis for many other white sauces, but is in no instance served by itself as a sauce with any entree or entremets. , e.ouie is served with hashes of chickens, veal, boudins a la reine, eminces and entrees of quenelles, &c. This must set at rest all idle contro- crsy on tins subject, as no cook could say that the above is not the case.

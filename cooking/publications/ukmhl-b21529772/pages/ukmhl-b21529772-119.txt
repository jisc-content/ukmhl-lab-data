75 VI. FISH FOR REMOVES. No. 169. Salmon Plain. Take spring water, first let it boil, that your fish may be firm; put in a handful of salt, and skim the water; then put in the fish ; the thicker it is the more gently it must boil, and the more boiling it will require. If it is a piece, you will know when it is done by raising the slice of the fish kettle ; the bone of the fish does not adhere to the meat: if the salmon is a whole one, try the bone by putting a knife into the back. It is generally served with lobster sauce (No. 84). No. 170. Larded Salmon and Genoese Sauce. From one side of the salmon take off three strips of skin, about two inches broad, slanting from the back to the belly, and take off on the other side pieces from the parts corresponding with those where the skin remains on the side first done; neatly lard all the parts thus skin- ned ; put it in the form of an S, or serpent, as it is called ; braise it in a fish kettle, with fire top and bottom, and moistened with a Genoese sauce (No. 83). When it is done, drain the fish, glaze the larded parts, strain the sauce through a tammy, and put it to simmer, that it may throw up all fat and scum. Season with lemon juice, cayenne, and anchovy butter. Then put in a ragout of large quenelles, combs, mushrooms, &c. (see financiere, No. 86) : put this carefully round the fish, garnishing with cray fish and lambs’ sweetbreads larded. This is also called a la Chambord. I£ 2

80ups. 63 trimmed, and left in one piece, with the bones very short, when done, must be taken out and put to cool. Wash thoroughly clean about three ounces of barley, boil it about twenty minutes, after which cool it, by throwing it on a hair sieve, and passing cold water on it; put it in the stewpan again, with about a quart of the mutton broth, to boil on a slow fire till you can crush it between your finger and thumb. It requires to be kept amply moistened, or it will become thick and pappy. Take two small leeks, which cut in rings, a head of celery cut small, three turnips in small dice; these are first blanched, and then boiled separately with a little con- somme (No. 2): after this cut the mutton put aside into cutlets, which neatly trim. Put the whole together in one small soup pot, with the remains of the consomme strained over it: let it boil gently up; skim again. Add at the top of the tureen a few parsley leaves, blanched very green, and serve.—The parsley is for appearance’s sake. No. 139. Peasant's Soup, or Good Woman. This soup is generally made when you have had a rump of beef braised a day or two before. Proceed thus:—Cut two cabbages in quarters, blanch and stew them with brown stock (No. 5), enough to cover them ; they must simmer gently till well done.* Cut up the thin end of the rump of beef, about a pound, in slices about half an inch thick, nicely trimmed round; lay these in the bottom of your soup tureen, if your tureen has a lining, as you will not run the risk of breaking your meat * Let it be observed, that vegetables for soups or garnishes, except peas, 1 rench beans, and asparagus, must be blanched separately, and sepa- rately boiled down to a demi-glaze with a little consomme, white or brown, as the case may^ require, adding a little sugar and a small piece of ham to each. 1’cas, 1'rench beans, and asparagus peas, are only blanched, and put into the tureen the last thing, to preserve the colour.

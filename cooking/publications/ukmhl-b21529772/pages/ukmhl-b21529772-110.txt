66 SOUPS. No. 144. Hochepot of Game, in the same way as above. In the winter, use members or roast pheasant or par- tridge, with trimmings, legs, and backs, or any pieces which you may have. Serve the members with two quarts of game consommd (No. 4). No. 145. Quenelles of Chicken Soup. Take chicken forcemeat (No. 34), which form into quenelles with two small spoons: take a spoonful of farce, which smooth on the top with a knife to such a shape, that when boiled the quenelle, which will swell out, may be in the form of a pigeonâ€™s egg. When you have shaped it thus, with another hot spoon passed under the quenelle, you turn it out on a well buttered stewpan cover; make about three dozen, and half an hour before serving, blanch them in boiling common broth (No. 1); take them out with a cullender spoon, and drain them on a napkin, and add them to two quarts of light brown consomme (No. 5), very clear. These quenelles will serve another day, if taken out of the soup the moment it comes from table: they will serve for a financiere or ragout of any description. No. 146. Pheasant Soup a la Londonderry. Stew in a good mire-poix two fine pheasants. hen cold raise the fillets, and cut them in scollops; then pound the rest of the flesh to make a pur6e; add half a ladle-ful of consomme (No. 4), and six yolks of eggs, rubbed through the tammy. Pour it into a plain mould, lightly buttered, and put this cake of game in a bain marie*, that it may set; pass the bottom of the mire-poix through a silk sieve, and add it to the consomme, which you have seasoned with a bunch of leeks and celery,

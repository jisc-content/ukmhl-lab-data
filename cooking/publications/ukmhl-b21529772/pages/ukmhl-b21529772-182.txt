Put a pound of macaroni in boiling water, with salt and butter; let it simmer on a gentle fire; when the maca- roni swells and becomes mellow, drain it on a sieve; put half of it in a stewpan, strew over it half a pound of grated Parmesan cheese, half a tea-spoonful of coarse pepper, and half a pound of butter; place here and there a spoonful of veloute (No. 45), and as much beef gravy (No. 6); add the remainder of the macaroni, and half a pound more cheese; toss the whole together, and mix it well. No. 339. Turban of Rabbit. Form a ring of good farce a quenelle (No. 34) of old hen or rabbit on a baking sheet, covered with buttered paper; make it about an inch thick, and as high; the vacancy in the middle should be about two inches wide; egg it and bake it: in the middle of this place crumb of bread cut to the proper shape about four inches high, and surrounded with thin fat bacon; raise the farce round this; it must be less at the top than at the foot. Lard the fillets of four rabbits, and put the small ends inside at the top of the farce, over which let them fall outside, sloping to the bottom; between the fillets stick scolloped wafers of truffle or pieces of tongue. JBake the turban thus formed with buttered paper round it; when done, take out the bread and bacon; pass a thin blade under the farce, and, with a slice, place it on the dish. Glaze the fillets and fill the hollow in the turban with an emince ^No. 466), a salpicon (No. GfJ), or scollops; on the top place a lambâ€™s sweetbread, larded with bacon, or truffles, or a handful of green peas. This dish re- quires a thoroughly practised hand.

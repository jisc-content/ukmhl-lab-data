IV PREFACE. Racine, we are told, when writing from the country to a friend in Paris, complained that from frequent conversation with a provincial friend whose style was extremely bad, he found his own become incorrect: I crave indulgence for faults, but dare trust that they will not prove such as may tend to corrupt the taste of those who may honour me with their attention. To the first course I have devoted my especial care. It would not have been possible to keep tbe work within reason- able bounds had I attempted to go as fully into the Second Course. I think that I have given sufficient for ordinary purposes; and to those whose study it is to make themselves thoroughly masters of both, I beg to announce that it is my intention to produce a work exclusively treating of the Second Course and Cold Entrees, which will contain bills of fare for public breakfasts, luncheons, ball suppers, and the best information and the most approved productions of which the most eminent cooks have put us in possession. Generally speaking, cookery has within a few years made vast progress in England ; and as the public taste becomes more refined, in this as in all matters, so will men be found to minister to it. We shall sift away impurities and impro- prieties, till, by degrees, we arrive at a point where, in public estimation, we shall not ccdcr le pas to our hitherto masters on the Continent. I trust that the bills of fare will prove highly useful, assisted by the tables containing the articles in season. To the practised cook, as well as to the inexperienced, I confidently think that these will be an acquisition which has been long wanting. For the convenience of those whose employers wish to have their bills of fare in French, translations of the various dishes are given in the alphabetical lists; and as no pains have been spared to make this a useful production, a discerning Public will pronounce how far these endeavours are entitled to their approbation.

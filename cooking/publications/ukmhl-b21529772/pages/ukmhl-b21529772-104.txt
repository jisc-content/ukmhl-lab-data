SOUPS. 60 No. 133. Hare Soup. Take a full grown hare, not old; in paunching be care- ful to save the blood which is in the breast; cut your hare in pieces: place it on a dish, with six ounces of butter, two onions stuck with three cloves, half a carrot, a faggot of parsley and sweet basil, a bay-leaf and a sprig of thyme, a quarter of a pound of ham, a few pepper-corns and a little allspice, a knob of sugar, a blade of mace, and a little lemon peel. Put the whole in a deep frying-pan on a brisk fire, where turn it till it is set; dredge with two table-spoonfuls of flour; and when the whole is perfectly browned, but above all, not burnt, to which it is liable if left a moment, dilute with three pints of good consomme (No. 2), and, after a little boiling, turn the whole into a stewpan of a suitable size with a pint of port or Madeira (port is generally used); then put it in a back stove with a little fire top and bottom, just to keep it simmering. when your pieces are tender, having well skimmed off the fat and butter, take them out, trim the best of them, put them in another stewpan, and strain the sauce over them, which must be about as thick as Espagnole, No. 64 (brown sauce).

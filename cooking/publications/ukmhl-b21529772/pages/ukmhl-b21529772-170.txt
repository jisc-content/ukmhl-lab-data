126 FLANKS, OR LARGE ENTREES. â€¢ See note to No 29. quarter of a pound of butter, melted, as much grated bacon, a spoonful of parsley, two spoonfuls of mushrooms, four of truffles, the whole chopped fine, with a small eschalot, chopped and blanched. Season with herbaceous mixture* and salt, and a little grated nutmeg. Let the snipes set, by simmering about twenty minutes on a moderate fire, during which time turn them. Let them cool; then chop the trail and pound it: add four table- spoonfuls of quenelle farce, or farce fine (see those articles, No. 31), two spoonfuls of fines herbes, and a little nutmeg. Raise the paste about seven inches wide and four high ; line the bottom and sides with farce. Having trimmed the half snipes, cutting out part of the bones to bring them to a good shape, place them in rings in the pie, adding sliced truffles between them : mask the whole with the moisture in which the birds were passed ; put in a bay-leaf and slices of bacon fat; cover them with a sheet of paste. Pinch the pie all round the edges, and decorate it to your fancy ; egg it all over, and bake it in a brisk oven. When the top is lightly browned, put a knife through the cover so that it may not break, and cover it with thick paper: let it bake an hour and a half. It should be done just when wanted, or the pie loses part of its flavour. Take off the cover and the top of the inside, skim off the fat, and mask the inside with a brown sauce (No. 65) and an emince of truffles, and lightly glaze the crust of the pie. The sauce is not thick, but strong, as it is worked with game flavour, with truffles, and a reduction of Spanish wine. The covers are not served. No. 319. Raised Pie of Pheasant, with Truffles.

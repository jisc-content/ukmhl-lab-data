SWEET ENTREMETS. 280 eighteen whites of egg very firm ; to these add eight ounces of pounded sugar ; mix the fourth of this with the marmalade: mix the whole, which forms a souffld without butter or flour; put it into a souffle dish with a buttered paper round it, or a croustade like that of the raised pie a la financiere (No. 328) ; put it into the oven at a moderate heat, and let it bake an hour. Serve it, glazed white, with pounded sugar. The marmalade must be boiled as dry as possible, that it may mix well with the whites of egg. No. 796. Lemon Souffle. Mix a quarter of a pound of potatoe flour, and a quar- ter of a pound of butter, in a stewpan over the fire; of these form a paste without lumps; dilute these with a quart of milk, putting in a little first, and then the whole ; half a pound of sugar, on which you have rubbed the zest of a lemon, and a little salt; put this on a moderate fire ; when it begins to thicken take it oft to mix it well; put it on again, and let the moisture evaporate a few minutes without boiling; take it off, and mix in eight yolks of eggs, one after the other ; beat the whites up very strong till they will bear the weight oi an egg, lightly mix them in, and pour the whole into a crust like the preceding ; bake it, at a moderate heat, from halt to three quarters of an hour. Serve it glazed or pow- dered with fine sugar. No. 797- Orange Flower Souffle, Is the same as the foregoing ; the only difference, is in the flavour, using orange flowers instead of lemon peel, or orange flower water.

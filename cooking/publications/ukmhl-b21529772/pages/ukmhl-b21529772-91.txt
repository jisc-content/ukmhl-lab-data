SOUPS. 47 To make this puree brown, you would use Espagnole (No. 63), instead of supreme. No. 110. Ragout of Chestnuts. Take the first skin from the chesnuts, and sautez them in a little butter, that you may get off the second skin. Stew them in half a pint of Madeira or sherry, and half a pint of brown consomme (No. 5). When done, take out the chesnuts so that they may not come to pieces. Reduce the sauce, add half a pint of Spanish sauce, (No. 63), pass it through a tammy, and put it with the entire chesnuts. V. SOUPS. No. 111. Vermicelli, Macaroni, and other Italian Pastes. Blanch a quarter of a pound of vermicelli (which is a proper quantity for a tureen of soup for eight persons). Strain, it, and put it into cold water; when it has lain in this a few minutes, strain it off. Before you mix it with soups or consommes, it must be stewed in some strong broth, with a leg of fowl, a head of celery, and a piece of ham. Let it boil quite slowly; skim it care- fully to keep it clear. If your vermicelli is not broken before blanched, it will be in long threads, which would render it unpleasant for use. When Nouille and macaroni soups are served, send a plate of grated Parmesan to the side table. No. 112. Vermicelli Soup a la Reine. Blanch and drain your vermicelli, then throw it into some good chickei^ consomme (No, 3), well seasoned.

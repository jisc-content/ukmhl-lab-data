SAUCES. 32 (No. 63), and one of consomme (No. 5). Stir it on the fire till boiling, and draw it to the corner of the stove to imbibe flavour ; skim it, and pass it through a cullender spoon. This sauce should be kept very thin. No. 68. Brown Italian Sauce. Chop an eschalot, pass it in a stewpan with a spoon- ful of oil or a little butter, a clove, a blade of mace, a few pepper-corns, a little ham, and a small piece of bay- leaf ; when fried a little, add two table-spoonfuls of mushrooms chopped very fine, which pass also a few minutes : add two ragout spoonfuls of Spanish sauce (No. 63) and one of brown consomme (No. 5). Stir the whole over the fire till it boils ; draw it to the corner and let it simmer fifteen or twenty minutes; skim it and strain through a cullender spoon. No. 69- Chopped Sauce.* Take some good brown Italian sauce (No 68), to which, a few minutes before serving, add a table-spoonful of chopped capers; turn two gherkins, which slice very thin and slanting, to form ovals; work in a piece of anchovy butter of the size of a walnut. Serve with a little lemon juice and cayenne. No. 70- Perigueux Sauce. Chop about a quarter of a pound of truffles very fine, put them into a stewpan with about half a pint of Madeira; cover your stewpan closely, and let it boil about eight or ten minutes; add a small clove of garlick and a bay-leaf; fill up with double Espagnole (No. 64); * This sauce appears to be condemned by some ; notwithstanding, it was in frequent use in his late Majestyâ€™s kitchen. It is a good sauce for rein deer, larded fillets of beef and mutton, &c. &c.

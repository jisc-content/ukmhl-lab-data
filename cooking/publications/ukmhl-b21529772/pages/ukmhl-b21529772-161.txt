FLANKS, Oil SMALL REMOVES. I]/ hoursâ€”if new and fresh, six hours, before dressing it. Put plenty of cold water in the boiler with the tongue, and let it heat very gradually; about three hours, or three hours and a half boiling will suffice. Take it out, skin it, cut off the root, and trim it neatly: glaze it, and garnish it with tufts of roots of whatever may be in season, and bechamel sauce (No. 46). You may also serve it with mashed turnips, spinach, carrots, &c. No. 294. Fricandeau of Veal. Cut a piece about two inches thick from a fillet of veal (I generally use the neck), trim away the skin and sinews, and bring it to the form of the back of a turtle, high and round in the middle, and thinned off to the edges: according to your dish, make it round or oval. Lard it neatly and closely; put the trimmings into a stewpan, forming a rising in the middle, on which the fricandeau is to rest, so as to have as much as possible the shape of a dome. Put in a sliced onion, carrot, a small seasoned faggot, a blade of mace, a few pepper-corns, and a couple of cloves: cover them with thin slices of bacon fat; on these put the fricandeau, covered with buttered paper; moisten with a ladle-ful of good consomme, up to the edges of the larding. Put red-hot embers on the cover of the stewpan, and have enough fire under to keep it simmering. See that the moisture does not boil away too much. A good sized fricandeau requires about four hours, when nearly done, take off the buttered paper1, and put fresh embers on top. A few minutes before serving glaze it two or three times, keeping the fire very hot on the top. Serve under it, tomata sorrel, or endive! No. 295. Shoulder of Lamb Stuffed. Bone a shoulder of lamb, leaving the shank bone only ;

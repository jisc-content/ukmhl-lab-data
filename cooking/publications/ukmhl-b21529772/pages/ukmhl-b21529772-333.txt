SWEET ENTKEMETS. 289 six ounces of rough sugar. Lightly colour, in a gentle oven, four pounds of sweet almonds, each cut in ten equal fillets. 1 ake them out, and put a pound and a half of them hack in the oven. Put twelve ounces of fine sugar on a moderate fire; when it begins to boil stir it where the bubbles rise; when it boils nearly all over the surface, and when the bubbles are of a clear red, take it off, and put the almonds, quite hot, in the sugar, stirring; pour a third of this on a baking sheet; put the rest at the mouth of the oven or in the hot closet. 1 ut on a plate half the rough sugar and pistachios ; take some of the nougat from the baking sheet, put it on the sugar and pistachios, and then into a large mould in the form of a melon; take some more from the baking sheet and proceed, moulding lightly, that you may not crush the rough sugar; press with a lemon: put some more from the pan on the baking sheet; the almonds must be gently stirred from time to time: you must be quick, as the nougat must not have time to cool. Thus line the mould, which is a ribbed one: line the last rib only half way up, so that when you bring the two halves to- gether they may form a round melon. The mould mav be of any form. J While the nougat is cooling warm a pound of the al- monds m the oven ; warm the pan, take out the remaining nougat, add hot water, and clean it out dry: put ten ounces of sugar in it, and proceed as before. Havino- rushed the melon, make eighteen small nougats in danole or Madelaine moulds.

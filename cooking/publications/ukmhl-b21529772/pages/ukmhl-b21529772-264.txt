ENTREES OF VEAL. 220 No. 597- Blanquette of Veal a la Poulette. This is generally cut from the fillet of a neck or loin of veal previously served: trim off the skin and sinews; cut it into round scollops as large as a halfpenny; put it into a stewpan with a little supreme sauce (No. 45); let it sim- mer, and add a liaison of three or four yolks of eggs. To finish, work in a small piece of butter, a little lemon juice, and chopped and blanched parsley; dish, and garnish it with flowerets of puff paste. This is used for garnishing vol-au-vents, timbales, &c. No. 598. Blanquette of Veal with Cucumbers. Prepare it in the same way as above, with bechamel (No. 46) instead of supreme sauce. A few minutes before serving add a few pieces of cucumbers, blanched, and boiled down in consommd, then drained, and kept hot in a little white sauce. There must be no liaison in this. Dish it as above, or in a border of rice. No. 599. Blanquette of Veal with Mushrooms. Prepare it as in No. 597- Slice half a pottle of turned mushrooms, very fresh and white; throw these into a stew- pan with half a pint of supreme (No. 45), and reduce it on a strong fire to the consistency of bechamel, adding two ragout spoonfuls of cream; when it has boiled for a few minutes rub it through the tammy; pour it on the scollops of veal, to which add a dozen mushrooms, turned and done white, and keep the whole warm in the bain marie.

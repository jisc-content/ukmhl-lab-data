ENTREES. 153 h 5 and two inches high. When cold, cut them with a cutter, round, oval, square, or in lozenges. Beat eight eggs in a tureen; in these dip the croustades, one by one, and drain them; roll them on fine bread crumbs; repeat this; and roll on the dresser: mark the cover with a knife: fry them in rather warm lard, and take them out when nicely coloured: take olf the covers or lids, and scoop out the insides. To serve, fill them as the truffle croustades (No. 368). Vermicelli croustades are made in the same way. No. 370. Small Chartreuses the French way. Make these chartreuses as in No. 364; fill each of them with a lark, boned, which may be dressed with cab- bage, but take out the larks when done, as the cabbage takes more time. Take off the string which keeps them in shape; trim them, and put them in the chartreuses; put these in the bain marie, half an hour at least. To dish them, use a small slice or skimmer. 3. he chartreuses are formed in small dariole moulds, two inches high and two wide. Turn the moulds upside down on the slice; you "will thus be enabled to dish them without disfi^unn0* them. No. 371. Small Casserolettes of Rice. To form them, see casserole (No. 350). Let them be three inches high and two wide. Make twelve, and bake them on a sheet, in a hot oven; let them be delicately coloured; clear them out; and to serve, fill them with any of the ragouts given for truffle croustades (No. 368). Glaze the sides lightly. For a cover or top, put an under fillet of chicken larded, and glazed with light-coloured glaze, form these in rings, in the middle of which put a small turned truffle, and serve.

86 FISH FOIt REMOVES. liquor from the fish; let the sauce boil, and strain it into another stewpan. Put the small onions and mushrooms into a small stewpan; let the sauce boil again and reduce; skim it; keep the fish hot; drain it. Dish it with the heads in the middle of the dish, intermixing them. Gar- nish them with fried bread, mushrooms, and onions, large quenelles, and a few cray-fish: mask with the sauce. No. 198. Carp Farced. Cut off the heads and tails of two moderate-sized carp; take otit the bones of the carcasses, and make a quenelle farce of the flesh (No. 35). Cut a piece of crumb of bread to replace the part cut out; it should be about half an inch thick. Place it between the head and tail, on a buttered baking sheet, and all over this place the farce. Shape it as nearly as possible to imitate the fish; with a round cutter you will form the scales, having first egged the farce. Mind to dip the cutter continually in hot water. Bake it: put a skewer through it to ascertain when it is done. Dish and glaze it. Serve it with a white Italian (No. 49), or a rich anchovy sauce. Two small ones have a good effect. \ ou may serve it also with a double Espagnole reduced (No. 64), or a ragout of soft roes, mushrooms, and bottoms of arti- chokes, in a white wine sauce. No. 199. Carp d la Chambord. Fill the belly of a good sized carp with the soft roes of small ones, seasoned with chopped parsley, salt, pepper, and spices. Lard the side partly with truffles, and partly with bacon. Cover the truffles and the parts not larded with thin slices of bacon fat. Put it in a fish-kettle, and proceed as in No. 1 /0.

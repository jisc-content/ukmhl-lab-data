Stew the quails as in the preceding article : serve them with lettuce, blanched and braised (see No. 594) ; when done, drain them well between two cloths; dish them round the dish, the breasts outwards; a lettuce under each and a few in the middle : glaze the breasts of the birds, put fried bread between them, and mask with a good Spanish sauce (No. 64). A reduction of Madeira is a good addition to this dish No. 439. Quails au Gratin. Bone nine quails ; cut a piece of bread in the form of a cork, about two inches and a half in diameter, and two inches and a half high ; surround it with a very thin slice of bacon fat; place it in the middle of the dish ; garnish this round with farce fine (No. 34), sloping off to the edge of the dish all round. Season the quails with a little herbaceous mixture,* fines herbes, and salt; fill them with farce, so as to give them their original plump- ness ; place these with the breasts outwards on the farce: put a little more farce on the birds, so as to leave the breasts bare only ; cover these with a thin slice of fat bacon, and bake them in a sharp oven about three quarters of an hour: when done, take out the roll of bread, and, with a sponge, soak up all the fat; fill this well with a good brown Italian (No. 68), or scolloped truffles, in a gipsey sauce (No. 71)- When served with truffles, an under fillet larded with truffles may be served between the birds; otherwise put a fried comb of bread or larded fillet. Glaze the breasts and serve.

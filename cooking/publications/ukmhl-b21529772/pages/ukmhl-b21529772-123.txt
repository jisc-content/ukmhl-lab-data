79 FISH FOR REMOVES. again. Serve it with a napkin or slice under it, and garnish it with parsley. It is also served at large dinners, garnished with smelts, whitings, and fillets of soles fried.

Rub the turbot dry with a cloth, and make four or five incisions on both sides of the bone and on the upper and under side of the fish ; tie the head up, to prevent the jaws from opening when broiling ; take a small hand- ful of parsley, slice three onions or a dozen green ones, add three or four bay-leaves, two or three sprigs of -thyme, half a dozen cloves, a little mace, and pepper- corns ; pour about half a pint of oil over these ; mix them well together, and lay them in the incisions; oil the fish all over; it must lie in this marinade two or three hours: to dress it, clear away all particles of spice and roots, lay it on a gridiron very hot and rubbed with oil, and place it on a slow fire; when done on one side (the back is exposed to the fire first) turn it as shown in No. 173. This dish requires particular care and atten- tion ; when the meat will leave the bone easily it is done. Rub the white side of the fish with a little fresh butter kneaded with cayenne pepper, and serve it with cham- pagne or Madeira sauce (No. 57). No. 180. John Dory. Marinade and broil it precisely as above : for a plain dinner serve with a napkin under it, and garnish it with parsley. Serve with anchovy or caper sauce (No. 60). 1

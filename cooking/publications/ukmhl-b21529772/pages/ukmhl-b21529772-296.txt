252 SAVOURY ENTREMETS. No. 711 â€¢ Fried Potatoes. Cut up some potatoes in round pieces half an inch thick; turn them in ribbons as long and as thin as possi- ble ; tie them in knots and bows, and throw them into a basin of cold water; drain them about half an hour before you fry them, that all the water may run from them ; fry them in very hot lard ; drain them on a nap- kin; and season them well with cayenne and fine salt. It is very much the taste of the day to serve these when the cheese goes on table. No. 712. White Beans* the Steward's ivay. Soak these beans if not quite new; put them on in cold water, with a piece of butter as large as a walnut; let them boil, skim them, and draw them to the corner of the stove ; when half done stir them up gently, and pour in a glass of cold water; when they are done put about a quarter of a pound of butter into a stewpan, with parsley and green onions chopped, salt, and pepper; drain the beans, and throw them in; stir them up, that they may be sauced all over ; add a little lemon juice; dish, and serve. These are very good with joints of roast mutton ; jou then add a little glaze. No. 713. Turnips Glazed.

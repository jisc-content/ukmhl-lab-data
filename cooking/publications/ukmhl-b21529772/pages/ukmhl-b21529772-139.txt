LARGE REMOVES. 9S bones short; and stuff the parts from which you have taken the tendons with stuffing (No. 37): braise it; drain it; dish and glaze. Serve it with stewed peas, sorrel, en- dive, or tomatas. No. 223. Noix of Veal Larded a la Bedeau. Cut the noix and udder attached to it, from the lee of a fine cow-calf; trim it as for a fricandeau, leaving the udder with it; lard the noix thickly over the surface; braise it as the fillet (No. 216): lay thin slices of fat bacon over the udder, to keep it as white as possible. When nearly done, glaze your veal, and close your kettle a few minutes; drain it; and dish it very carefully. Serve it with a macedoine, and ornament the udder with French beans: sorrel, or tomata sauce, may be served with this noix. No. 224. Leg of Mutton Braised. Daube a leg of mutton with fat bacon: when you have cut the bacon in pieces, as thick as your little finger, roll in a little herbaceous mixture (No. 29, note) and chopped paisley; these must be stuck through the mutton in the same direction as the bone. Trim off the ends of the bacon, which, with the rest of the trimmings, put into a stewpan, together with a pound of veal, cut in pieces, two carrots’ two onions, and a seasoned faggot, two cloves, a blade of mace, a bay-leaf, and a few pepper-corns. Stir them over the fire till they begin to catch; then put in the leo- 0f mutton, with a ladle-ful of good consomme: let it sinTmer gently about four hours, with fire on the top. When done, take it out; strain the liquor; put back the mutton till your gravy has been boiled up, well skimmed, and reduced to a glaze, with which you glaze the mutton: dish it, placing round it white beans, a la maltre d’hotel (INo. 709), or a lyonnaise (No. 74).

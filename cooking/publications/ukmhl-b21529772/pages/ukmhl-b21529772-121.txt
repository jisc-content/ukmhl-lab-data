FISH FOR. REMOVES. 77 cayenne pepper, and a little anchovy butter. This sauce must be of the consistency of bechamel. You will have replaced the fish during this time in the braising kettle, to keep it hot. Dish it neatly, masking it with some of the sauce, the remainder of which send up in a boat. No. 173. Broiled Salmon and Caper Sauce. Take two or three slices of salmon; put them in a mari- nade of oil, parsley, green onion, salt, and pepper; let them remain some hours, turning them once or twice; broil them on a moderate fire, sprinkling them with the marinade. Serve with butter sauce and capers (No. 60). To turn your salmon on the gridiron, lay a stewpan cover on the salmon, turn the gridiron over, and the salmon will be on the cover; wipe the gridiron well, make it quite hot, that the salmon may not stick; rub the bars with a little of the marinade, and glide the salmon gently from the cover on to the gridiron. No. 174. Broiled Salmon and Tomata Sauce. Prepare the salmon as above. Serve it with a tomata sauce (No. 75). No. 175. Salmon au Bleu. Put some slices of salmon in a fish-kettle with about a pint of port wine, carrots cut in slices, onions sliced also, four cloves, a couple of bay-leaves, a handful of parsley, a few sprigs of thyme, salt, and pepper; let it boil very gently; it is done when the flesh will easily leave the bone. It must be covered by the liquor in which it is boiled. If served as an entree, take off the skin when the fish is done, and mask it with a good butter sauce, in which put capers, sliced gherkins, and a little anchovy butter (No. 26).

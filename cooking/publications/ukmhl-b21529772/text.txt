The main object in this collection of recipes has not been to extend them beyond the limits of utility, but to select a sufficient number to answer all the purposes of variety, and, at the same time, to insert only such as have been tried and generally approved of. Enough of my time has not been devoted to the perusal of fan- ciful disquisitions on gastronomical history, to entertain those whocondescend to take this volume in hand with highly-wrought and far-fetched curiosities of the art, or with the sayings of persons eminent as practitioners, either in the kitchen or at the table : I shall feel sufficiently gratified if, in the course of my work, it appear that, in addition to recipes for elegant as well as palatable preparations, I have interspersed the whole with information immediately connected with the practice of cookery, and founded on good and close observation and experience. What I have gathered is chiefly from a school, than which none ever afforded a wider field to the learner, and over which a taste highly keen and cultivated was known to preside : I allude to his late Majesty’s kitchen. I have endeavoured to make the explanations as clear as possible, and, hoping it may not fail of encouragement from those Ladies who take pleasure in making themselves acquainted with all that belongs to domestic matters, I have been at some pains, that, when my book falls into their hands, they may not reject it as savouring too strongly of the kitchen, and that they may understand rfif meaning without having the head-ache, or exerting their own ingenuity to find it out. a 2IV PREFACE. Racine, we are told, when writing from the country to a friend in Paris, complained that from frequent conversation with a provincial friend whose style was extremely bad, he found his own become incorrect: I crave indulgence for faults, but dare trust that they will not prove such as may tend to corrupt the taste of those who may honour me with their attention. To the first course I have devoted my especial care. It would not have been possible to keep tbe work within reason- able bounds had I attempted to go as fully into the Second Course. I think that I have given sufficient for ordinary purposes; and to those whose study it is to make themselves thoroughly masters of both, I beg to announce that it is my intention to produce a work exclusively treating of the Second Course and Cold Entrees, which will contain bills of fare for public breakfasts, luncheons, ball suppers, and the best information and the most approved productions of which the most eminent cooks have put us in possession. Generally speaking, cookery has within a few years made vast progress in England ; and as the public taste becomes more refined, in this as in all matters, so will men be found to minister to it. We shall sift away impurities and impro- prieties, till, by degrees, we arrive at a point where, in public estimation, we shall not ccdcr le pas to our hitherto masters on the Continent. I trust that the bills of fare will prove highly useful, assisted by the tables containing the articles in season. To the practised cook, as well as to the inexperienced, I confidently think that these will be an acquisition which has been long wanting. For the convenience of those whose employers wish to have their bills of fare in French, translations of the various dishes are given in the alphabetical lists; and as no pains have been spared to make this a useful production, a discerning Public will pronounce how far these endeavours are entitled to their approbation.ALPHABETICAL INDEXES.

Without cleanliness and order, a larder is of no use more than any other place where provisions might be heaped together. Every morning, and most especially in the summer season, let all the shelves and dressers be scoured and washed with cold water. The cold meat must be put on fresh dishes, in the most airy place : look to all the soups and sauces, and see if they want boiling up, a thing which should be done every morning in close and sultry weather. Let the pans into which you afterwards put them be perfectly dry, or they will assuredly turn sour. The strictest and most minute attention is requisite in this respect. Should they begin to turn, the best way is to boil them down to a half glaze, which will answer every purpose of stock, by adding water to it as you want it. When you put the sauce on to boil, do not omit to add a little stock, to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the stewpan. Whatever is done in braises in the summer should be made stronger than in winter, or they will not keep to be of service. u2 MANAGEMENT OF A LAEDEE. All lardings, if they return to the kitchen whole, should be put in the braise in which they were done, and covered with the layers of bacon used to cover them in the stew- pan. Tendons of veal and lamb, ox-tail, rump of beef, in short, all the different articles usually done in braises, should be taken particular care of, and the same attention should be paid to putting by those dishes that may be served again, as in dressing the dinner ; for these may be equally as good and serviceable the second time as the first. All dressed meat intended to be kept until cold, whether boiled or roast, should be thoroughly done, particularly in summer; for if the gravy be left in either, it will not keep more than two or three days, but if done quite dr}, it will keep a week or longer. Roast meat should be well sprinkled with salt before taken from the fire, and boiled beef that is intended to be eaten cold should be at least fourteen days in salt; if a few days longer it will eat all the better when boiled; if not well salted, being boiled rather more than it would be to be sent to table hot, it will eat insipid. For undressed meat, when in the country in summer, and the meat is not killed at home, have the meat brought in as early as possible in the morning, not later than six if within a few miles; otherwise, when the heat of the day is advanced, it is almost impossible to prevent it from being fly blown. It is hardly necessary to state that o-rcat attention is necessary in watching the meat closely [n summer, the heat of the weather frequently turning it suddenly. , , Cattle intended for slaughter should never be over- driven, and should be kept fasting at least twenty-four hours before killed; for if the beasts be full then, the meat will not keep more than a day or two: they should be3 MANAGEMENT OF A LARDER. killed early in the morning or late in the evening—the evening is preferable, as the meat has time to cool during the night; have it cut up early next morning, as there are then no flies about. BEEF. When the beef is cut in proper pieces, for instance, the sirloin, ribs, rump, and brisket, in the first place examine well and see that there are no fly-blows about them, as in the sirloin the flies are very apt to get under the loose side of the fat; wipe it well with a clean dry cloth, sprinkle the fat with salt, and rub salt also on the chine bone; take out the pipe that runs along it, the kernel that is in the fat at the chump, and also the pith; let these places be well rubbed with salt, as likewise the out- side of the two ends. It will keep good a week in hot weather by strictly observing these rules. Ribs.—Rub the chine bone with salt, cut out the piece of skirt that is mostly left in, and rub the inside well with salt, as also the outsides, the two ends, and the top of the ribs ; it may then be hung up. Rump.—Cut off the fat that is generally left in by the butchers, and take out the kernel that is near the small end; wipe it quite dry with a cloth and hang it up. Brisket.—The part which is generally kept for stewing is the thick end; as to the size, it must depend on the judgment of those who are to use it. It should be wiped quite dry with a clean cloth before it is hung up. The pieces that are intended for boiling require equal attention. There are two kernels in a round of beef, one in the middle, commonly called the Pope’s eye, the other in the thick fat: be careful in seeing that the butcher takes them out, otherwise no quantity of salt will preserve it from spoiling, particularly in the summer. In the b 24 MANAGEMENT OF A LARDER. thick flank there is also a kernel in the middle of the fat, which must be cut out, as well as one which is in the H bone, where the rump is taken off. There is also a kernel which, according to the different modes of cutting up, is sometimes found in the shoulder, sometimes in the neck piece, which must be carefully taken out. Joint the brisket, by way of letting the salt in, and the flat ribs the same. When all this is done, see that the butcher rubs the salt well into each piece, and fills all the joints with salt; when properly done, put it down tight in the salt bin, the prime pieces at the bottom, and cover all well over with salt; the coarse pieces at the top to be used first; and by adhering strictly to these rides, the salt beef will be as good in summer as in winter.* S VEAL. Leg.—The first part that spoils is where the udder is skewered back ; that skewer should be taken out, and the under part of the udder wiped very dry, then rubbed with a little salt, and the kernel taken out from the thick fat. N. B. Veal requires to be wiped dry with a clean cloth every morning. Loin.—Cut out the pipe that runs along the chine bone, wipe it well with a cloth, and under the kidney the same. There is a kernel under the fat that is in the inside of the chump, which must be taken out. Sprinkle a little salt on the chine bone. The shoulder is seldom kept above a day or two, as it is generally either used for the family or put in the stock-pot. Neck.—There is a pipe that runs along the chine bone, which should be cut out, as well as the chine bone; the * The flesh of a young ox is full grained, and deeper coloured than cow-beef.MANAGEMENT OF A LARDER. 5 inside of the ribs wiped very dry with a cloth, and then rubbed with a little salt. Breast.—Cut the loose fat out from the inside, and the piece of skirt, and wipe it very dry with a cloth.* MUTTON.*1" Chine.—The fat should all be taken out, also the pipe that runs up the back bone, and two small kernels near the tail. Sprinkle the inside with salt. The leg is a joint that spoils sooner than any part of the sheep. There is a kernel in the fat, which must be taken out, and the place filled up with salt; indeed, the butcher ought to take it out when he is dressing the sheep. The neck is a joint that will keep the best of any. Cut the pipe out that runs along the chine bone, and rub it dry with a cloth. Shoulder.—There is a kernel in the inside, which should be taken out. Breast.—Cut the skirt out and wipe it dry.j IAMB. Lamb should be managed the same as mutton ; it is cut up in the same manner as a sheep. Though the flesh is not high in colour, it is of a healthy appearance, and the fat white. PORK. Leg.—The legs are generally salted for boiling ; if the leg be intended for roasting it ought to be hung up. 1 he best veal is very white and fat, and more wholesome when it is so- .1" 12arl Cowper’s establishment, mutton is never killed till it is six years old ; and whoever has had an opportunity of judging, as I have, must acknowledge the very great superiority of this meat, both in quality ar.d + ^ oung mutton is insipid and pale ; prime mutton is dark, plump, the flesh marbled, and the sinews small and transparent, the fat firm and white.(j MANAGEMENT OF A LARDER. Necks and loins answer either for chops or roasting; they should be sprinkled with salt before they are hung up. The hand is generally salted for boiling.* VENISON. Venison is reckoned the choicest meat in use, and is oftener spoiled than any other. The cooks generally get the blame, but the fault lies mostly with the park-keeper, for want of precaution in killing them. This ought to be done at day-break, when it could be effected immediately; for the bucks herd together, and when first they are roused stand to look about them ; the keeper, always being ready on the spot, would be enabled to take a sure aim. Having been present, I can speak to the fact; and it is impossible for meat to keep that is hunted three, four, and even five hours, which is too often the case. The haunch is the finest joint. The keeper should bring it in as early in the morning after killing as possi- ble. There is a kernel in the fat the same as a leg ot mutton, that should be taken out, and the part wiped very dry, and a little ground pepper and ginger rubbec on the inside, which will keep the flies from it. t is t le best keeping meat of any, particularly if what I have mentioned be strictly attended to. _ The neck is the next best joint, which requires nothing but wiping it well with a clean dry cloth. The shoulder and breast are generally used in two or three days for a pasty. . . . The keeper in general draws the shoulder, which is sure to spoil the neck. The shoulder should not be taken off until quite cold, and then raise it the same as a shoulder of mutton. The fattest venison is the most esteemed. * Good pork is fine grained, fat, and fair; when inferior it is red, coarse, and unsightly.7 MANAGEMENT OF A LARDER. POULTRY". Poultry must be kept as cool as possible: it keeps much better with the breast downwards, on a shelf or marble slab, than hung up. The crop and the gut of the rump are taken out. Take fowls with a thin transparent skin, white and delicate. Pigeons are scarcely fit for a delicate stomach when full fledged, as they are hard to digest. With regard to turkeys, while I had the honour of serving T. W. Coke, Esq., of Holkham-hall, Norfolk, I had an opportunity of witnessing the good effects of keep- ing turkies wild, as they are kept by that gentleman, to whom they afford the same sport as any other bird in cover. This is the red American turkey, which is far superior in flavour to any other. The only way to obtain any thing like them is with the brown Norfolk turkey, which must be cooped up four days previous to being killed. The first day after feeding as usual, an entire walnut with the shell, and having been soaked twelve hours in water, must be crammed down the bird’s throat. The second day after let it have two more walnuts in the same way, and three on each of the two following days. This is for roasting only. The flesh becomes darker, and takes a flavour of game, which has been greatly approved of.RECIPES. I. BROTHS AND CONSOMMES. No. 1. Common Broth. Cut up a leg of beef in thin slices, break the bone, and put it into a pot that will hold about fourteen quarts: fill it up with cold water and put it over the stove : when it begins to boil, skim it well, and add about a pint of cold water, stirring the meat up from the bottom to make the scum rise. Every time you skim it add a little cold water to stop the boiling. You must watch it so as not to let it boil fast, and you must skim it as long as any scum rises. When quite clear, draw it to the corner of the stove to boil very gently; thus the broth will not waste, and you will keep it clear. It should continue thus about four hours. When ready, strain it off* into clean dry pans, then fill the pot up again with boiling water, and let it boil until the last thing before leaving the kitchen. In winter the broth should be made the day before it is wanted, as there is no danger of its turning sour: but in summer be very careful that your pans are perfectly clean and dry before you strain broth into them, and also not to have more than four quarts in one pan, as where there is a large body of it, it is very apt to ferment. 1 here should not be any roots put to this broth in summer. It will be found of great advantage to place broths, soups, and9 BROTHS AND CONSOMMES. sauces, on trivets when put aside, that the air may cir- culate under them, both winter and summer, otherwise they draw the damp under them, and are more liable to ferment. No. 2. White Consomme, or Veal Stock. Take a knuckle of veal, half a pound of good ham, trimmings of meat, and any veal or poultry which you may have; put them in your stock-pot to stew on a gentle fire, and moistem them with a ladle-ful of common broth; add a bunch of parsley and green onions: let these sweat thoroughly. If, on piercing the meat with a knife, no blood follow, it is heated through ; fill up with boiling broth, and after four hours1 gentle boiling this stock will be fit for making- sauces, or stocks of poultry or game. By being too long on the fire the flavour of the stock degenerates, becomes stong and unpalateable, and it contracts too high a colour. Carefully remove the fat and scum of all stock, and fill up your pots to avoid too much colour. No. 3. Consomme of Poultry, or Chicken Stock. Lay a few slices of ham in a stewpan, with some veal,— the knuckle is best. Lay backs and trimmings of fowl on the veal, which moisten with veal stock, and put them to sweat. When your meat is heated through, cover it with veal stock, to which you add mushrooms, a bunch of parsley, and green onions : fill up and skim as in the preceding article. Strain your stock through a silk sieve for use. No. 4. Consommd of Game, or Game Stock. Put the backs of roasted pheasants or partridges on some pieces of veal in a stewpan: carcases of rabbits b 5BROTHS AND CONSOMMES. 10 may be aaded. Put also a few slices of ham and a sea- soned faggot, that is, bay-leaves, sweet basil, a couple of cloves, and a few blades of mace, tied in a bunch. If you are about to use truffles with game, add the parings, with mushrooms, to your stock, which strain through a silk sieve for use. No. 5. Blond de Veau, or Veal Gravy, or Brown Stock. Lay slices of York ham on the bottom of a thick stew- pan, buttered, on these some pieces of veal—the chump may be used: add enough stock to moisten the meat half-way up, and let it sweat over a brisk fire. Attend closely lest it burn, and when the moisture is reduced, pierce the meat to let all the gravy run from it; reduce the liquor to a glaze, and let it stew till brown. Put your pan on red-hot ashes, to prevent its burn- ing; stir without ceasing, to colour your glaze uni- formly throughout; turning your meat from time to time, that it may not stick to the pan. Moisten with hot broth when your glaze is sufficiently coloured; it will burn if it is sticking to the stewpan when placed on the fire. Season with mushrooms, parsley, and green onions. An hour and a half’s boiling will suffice. Take off the fat, as in the preceding, and strain the gravy through a silk sieve. No. 6. Beef Gravy. Garnish the'bottom of a thick stewpan with slices of fat bacon; on these place three large onions, cut iu halves, the flat part downwards; over which slices of beef, as in the preceding article; and moisten the whole with a little common broth. Let this sweat, and when reduced prick the meat, to let all the gravy run from it; let it stew on a slow fire till the gravy be lightly coloured. Add common broth, with a large bunch of parsley and greenBROTHS AMD CONSOMMES. 11 onions, a little salt and black pepper-corns; boil an hour and a half, skim off the fat, and strain through a silk sieve, for use. The browner this gravy the better, but it will be bitter if at all burnt. No. 7* Aspic, or Savoury Jelly. Boil a handful of burnet, chervil, and tarragon, in white vinegar, till the latter is well impregnated with the aroma of the herbs; then pour into the stewpan some chicken stock reduced. When your jelly is well seasoned, beat the whites of four eggs with a whisk in an earthen pan, into which throw the aspic; put the whole in a stewpan, and place it on the fire; continually beat and stir the jelly till it becomes white; it then nearly boils. Draw it to the corner of the stove, and on the stewpan put a cover, with some red embers upon it. When perfectly transparent, strain it through a napkin or jelly-bag, a sieve being too coarse. When to be used for decorations, such as borders, &c. the aspic must be sufficiently stiff. For this purpose take two or more ladle-fuls of strong brown stock, well seasoned with roots and aromatic herbs. Put this in a stewpan, with two spoonfuls of tarragon vinegar, a little isinglass, and four whites of eggs, some salt and pepper. Whisk the whole on the fire till it nearly curdles, then draw it to the corner of the stove, covered with a few red embers on the top. When per- fectly clear, stain it for use, as an aspic; otherwise omit the vinegar, as jelly for a pie or galantine requires no acid. Let it be observed that any thing which requires clarification requires also a higher seasoning, as that operation diminishes the flavour. No. 8. Beef Tea. The beef for this purpose should be cut from the12 BROTHS AND CONSOMMES. mouse round, in very thin slices. Put the quantity re- quired of boiling water over it, and let it boil gently for half an hour at the corner of the stove; be very par- ticular in skimming it. It should be strained through a napkin. A pound of beef will make a quart of tea. N. B. Tea from the fillet or knuckle of veal is made in the same way. No. 9. Chicken Broth. Cut up an old hen into a stewpan with about three pints of water and a few blades of mace; put it on the fire : when it begins to boil, skim it thoroughly, and add a little water to stop its boiling. When it begins to boil ao-ain, skim it, draw it to the corner of the stove to boil for half an hour, then strain it through a fine napkin : fill the stewpan up again, and let it boil two hours, then strain it off for use. No. 10. Mutton Tea. Cut about a pound of the lean only of a loin of mutton into thin slices; put them into a stewpan with a few spoonfuls of water, and put them on the fire to draw down. When all the liquid is boiled away, add a quart of water, and let it boil very gently half an hour. It must be very clear. Strain it through a napkin. II. RUDIMENTS. No. 11. Calces-foot Stock. Bone four calves' feet and put them into a stew-pan that will hold about three quarts (when .mended to be13 RUDIMENTS. used as a dish, you must take them up before they are too much boiled); let them boil gently for about three hours, then take out the meat part and put it into cold water ; when cold trim them for any use they are intended for: put the trimmings back into the stock, and let it boil until you think it sufficiently strong ; it matters not how long it boils. Four feet should give you two quarts of stock. This should be made the day before it is wanted; remove the oily surface when cold, and wipe the top well with a napkin. No. 12. White Poele. Put a calf’s udder to blanch in a stewpan-ful of cold water; when it has boiled about a quarter of an hour, take it off, and put it into cold water for a few minutes; then cut it in small pieces, which put into a stewpan with about an ounce of butter, one or two onions, a seasoned faggot, a few blades of mace, a lemon well paired and cut in thin slices; add a few spoonfuls of water, and put it over a slow stove; stir it for a few minutes, then add common broth according to what you want to braise. It is generally used for tendons of lamb, veal, chickens, pigeons, or any thing that is to be white. No. 13. A Brown Braise. Cut some beef suet, trimmings of mutton, or Iamb cutlets, or other trimmings of meat; put them into a braising pan with four or five onions, three or four cloves, a well-seasoned faggot, a little mace, trimmings of celery, two or three carrots, cut in slices, and a few bay leaves ; add about a pint of water, and let it draw down for about half an hour on the stove : when the liquid is quite reduced, add common broth, or any broth which you may have to spare, to prevent it burning at the bottom.rudiments. 14 If for a ham or a rump of beef, a pint of white wine will add much to the flavour of either. This braise is used for beef, mutton, ham, and veal, or any thing to be eaten mellow. No. 14. A White Braise. Put the trimmings of beef, mutton, or veal, into a stew- pan (according to what is intended to be braised) with three onions, a faggot of sweet herbs, a few blades of mace, and a hay-leaf, a bit of carrot, and some trimmings of celery ; add as much common broth as will come about half-way up the meat, and put it over the stove about an hour and a half to reduce: add about as much as you think has boiled away; then cover the meat over with a lemon cut in thin slices, and with layers of fat bacon, 01 the fat of ham, if convenient; then lay on whatever is to be bruised: it is the best method for doing all lard- mas. They take rather more time, but they eat s much the better, and the larding looks better for being kept from the liquid. No. 15. Poeli. Cut two pounds of veal in large dice, which fry in a -uarter of a pound of butter till white : cut a pound o E „e, an^ a pound of bacon fat in the same way. Put the whole in a stewpan; add about two quarts of boilimr water, salt, a hay leaf, thyme, an onion stuck w“h three cloves, a faggot of parsley, green onions, and the pulp of a lemon cut in slices. Boil the whole gen y. Poel“s give whiteness and savour to whatever is done hi lhcm The lean of bacon, from the saltpetre used in curing it, would redden your meats.15 RUDIMENTS. No. 16. Faggot, Is a bunch of parsley (the size varies of course), a bay- leaf, and a sprig of thyme, tied up closely. When any thing beyond this is required, it is specified in the article. No. 17. Batter for Frying. Dilute twelve ounces of sifted flour with lukewarm water, in which you have melted two ounces of butter. Incline the vessel and blow off the butter first on the flour, and pour in enough water to form a rather thin paste without lumps; then add enough water to form a batter. It should be sufficiently thick to mask whatever is dipped into it, but should run freely. Add a little salt, and two whites of eggs, well whipped. No. 18. Fines Herbes. Four table-spoonfuls of chopped mushrooms, with lemon juice squeezed over them, or they will turn black ; a table-spoonful of chopped parsley; four eschalots, chopped very fine, or a piece of onion. Put in a stewpan on the fire a piece of butter, as large as an egg, with the onions 01 eschalots; stir a few minutes, put in the parsley ; stir again a couple of minutes, with the addition of a bay-leaf, a little pepper, and salt; add your mush- rooms, and stir the whole over the fire about ten minutes more.. Take out your bay-leaf, and put your fines herbes in a jelly pot for use. When parsley has been well chopped, to prevent its clotting together, and in order to be able to sprinkle it as you would pepper or salt, put it in the end of a cloth, which dip in water, and then squeeze out the liquid; chop it again. A spoonful of16 RUDIMENTS. water should be thrown over onion or eschalot to keep the colour from changing, and to keep the strength of them from the eyes, which it does in a great measure. Wash it as the parsley, and chop it again. No. 19. Spinach Green. Take two or three handfuls of fresh spinach, thoroughly washed, pound it, and squeeze the juice through a cloth, as it discolours the tammy, and makes it unfit for deli- cate sauces. Put the juice in a stewpan on the fire with a little salt, stirring without leaving it, and the moment it curdles take off the pan and put cold water into it; drain your spinach green on a hair sieve, put it between two cloths to extract all the moisture from it; if for colouring sugar and sweetmeats, mix it well wit 1 a little sugar passed through a silk a sieve.

Mushrooms for Ragouts and Sauces, called Mushrooms a Blanc (done 11 lute). Peel your mushroom neatly, cut the stalk i ery lo clear off the part underneath to the white pulp; whether sliced or whole throw them into a bason of water with a little lemon juice; then put them with a piece of butter a large as a walnut, the juice of a lemon, and two or three spoonfuls of water, into a stewpan: let them s.m- mer ten minutes. Put them in a jelly pot foi use. No. 22. Liaison, or Thickening. Add a tea-spoonful of cream for every raw yolk of egg; mitt well, and pass through a fine Steve. Mr. oley,17 RUDIMENTS. cook to the late Duke of Sunderland, invariably added a little potatoe flour. The sauce masks its entree the better for it. No. 23. Cock's Combs. To clear the skins off, put the combs in the middle of a coarse cloth, with a little salt, and dip them into boiling water, holding the corners of the cloth ; hold them thus a few seconds; take them out and rub them together. If all the skin be not off, redip them, but bearing in mind that you must not let the blood set in them, as you could not then get it out, and your object is to whiten them. Cut oft* the points of the combs, and put them in a stewpan of water at the corner of the stove: the water must not become more than lukewarm, or it will set the blood, and your combs are then blackened and spoiled. When white, cool them. For use, stew them in a poele (No. 15) till tender; try them frequently, for they break in the sauces if too much done. The kidneys must not be allowed to boil, or they would also break. No. 24. Montpellier Butter. Well wash a small handful of chervil, the leaves of a dozen sprigs of tarragon, as much burnet, and a few small green onions; blanch and cool them. Boil four eggs hard: drain and squeeze your herbs dry: pound them with ten anchovies, boned and wiped, one spoonful of capers, the yolks of the eggs ; scrape a little garlick with the point of your knife, and rub it into your butter: after this add four ounces of butter, a little whole pepper, a little salt and grated nutmeg ; the whole well_ pounded. Add two table-spoonfuls of fine olive oil, and a tea-spoon- ful of elder or tarragon vinegar.

Take equal proportions of parsley, tarrogan, and chervil; chop them very fine; season with a little pepper and salt; rub a table-spoonful in with a quarter of a pound of fresh butter: put it on ice to set. If used for breakfast, or served at the side-table, cut it with a warm cutter in pieces of whatever shape you please. This butter may always be used as a garnish for salads. No. 26. Anchovy Butter. Pick and wipe half a dozen anchovies, which pound with two ounces of fresh butter; rub it through a fine hair sieve ; used as above, and for fish sauces as hereafter directed. No. 27. Lobster Butter. Take boiled lobster spawn, which pound with a little butter, and rub it through a hair sieve. The colour should be a bright red. No. 28. Panade. Put in a stewpan the crumb of a French roll, and about half a pint of consomme of fowl; place it on a moderate fire, and stir continually till the moisture is nearly ex- hausted; you have then a soft thick paste: add two yolks of eggs, and stir till it no longer adheres to either spoon or stewpan. Put it to cool on a plate, and cover it with buttered paper.19 III. FORCEMEATS AND STUFFING. No. 29. Forcemeats for Pies. Take a pound of lean veal, trim off all nerves and skins, and chop it with a pound and a half of fat bacon ; pound these with five drams of herbaceous mixture,* two spoonfuls of fines herbes (No. 18), a few' chopped truffles, a little salt, two eggs, and a spoonful of white or brown sauce. , No. 30.

A fat liver, let it disgorge and blanch in lukewarm water, cut each half in four fillets, which trim ; pound two of these fillets with the trimmings and flesh of a par- tridge, and an equal quantity of fat bacon ; season highly * The herbaceous mixture is sold at all the Italian Warehouses in the kingdom, and strongly recommended for soups, farces, pies, game, civets, &c., and all things requiring high seasoning.20 FORCEMEATS AND STUFFING. with herbaceous mixture (see note No. 29) and salt: add fines herbes and the yolks of two eggs in pounding. No. 33. Godiveau Forcemeat. Half a pound of the lean of veal, twelve ounces of very mealy beef suet, free from the sinews and skins, and chopped very fine, with sufficient herbaceous mixture (see note No. 29) to season it well, and two eggs ; pound the whole till no fragment be perceptible. In summer, take it out and put it on ice an hour or two. Pound it again, in summer, with small pieces of clear ice; in winter, with a table-spoonful of sauce tournee (No. 43), adding a good spoonful of fines herbes ; roll up a small ball, and blanch or put it in the oven a few minutes. If not sufficiently stiff it will not hold together; then add another egg; if too stiff it will not swell out; you must then add another spoonful of sauce tournee. The ice facilitates the incorporation of the suet in warm weather. No. 34. Quenelle Forcemeat, or Farce for Quenelles. Scrape a sufficiency of veal or the flesh of a fowl, rabbit, or game, as the case may require, pound it, pass it through a wire sieve, and put it on a plate ; boil a calf’s udder in your stock-pot, or in common broth; let it cool, trim it, pound four ounces of it, and pass it through the sieve: pound three ounces of panade (No. 28) with five of flesh, till thoroughly incorporated, then add the udder ; and, having pounded the whole fifteen or twenty minutes, add a spoonful of fines herbes (No. 18), one yolk and one egg, and a couple of table-spoonfuls of white or brown sauce, according to your meat: season with a little nutmeg, pepper, salt, and cayenne; pound five minutes more; blanch one quenelle in a little boiling broth, and, after a few minutes’ boiling, the quenelle should beFORCEMEATS AND STUFFING. 21 soft to the touch; when cut in two the inside should be very smooth, extremely mellow, and agreeable to the palate. If not of sufficient consistency add a yolk ; if too close, add a little sauce. No. 35. Farce for Quenelles of Fish. Cut out and scrape the fillets of two middling size whitings, which pound thoroughly and pass through the wire sieve; well soak in milk or broth the crumb of a French roll, then squeeze it firmly in a napkin to get out the moisture, in order to pound it more easily, which you will do for ten minutes, then pass it through the sieve. Weigh six ounces of the panade, ten of flesh, and six of butter; pound the panade and the flesh some minutes, then add the butter, and pound the whole a quarter of an hour; season very lightly with a little pepper, nutmeg, salt, and cayenne, and three yolks of eggs ; pound the whole a few minutes more, after which, add two spoonfuls of fines herbes (No. 18) passed with butter, and a spoonful of white sauce. When well pounded, put the whole in a basin. To use it, mix in a whipped white of egg. You may use carp, pike, and haddock, in the same way. No. 36. Stuffing for Roast Goose, Duck, and Pork. Chop an onion very fine, half its weight of green sage leaves, twice as much of bread crumbs, a piece of butter as large as a walnut, the yolk and white of an egg, and a little pepper and salt; a minced apple is sometimes added. No. 37. Hare Stuffing. Chop two ounces of beef suet fine, add three ounces of bread crumbs, a couple of eschalots, and season with about two drachms of herbaceous mixture (see note No. 29) ; add the white and yolk of an egg. The stuffing22 FOBCEMEATS AND STUFFING. must be stiff. The liver is added when sound ; it is par- boiled and minced. No. 38. Stuffing for Roast Veal, Turkey, fyc. Take three ounces of beef suet, or marrow in pre- ference, and three ounces of bread crumbs ; season with herbaceous mixture (see note No. 29), parsley, and onion, chopped as fine as possible: pound all these ingredients together with one entire egg and one white. This quantity suffices for veal or fowl; a turkey re- quires twice as much. No. 39. Stuffing for Boiled Fowls and Turkeys. Take some godiveau or farce a quenelles (Nos. 33 or 34), add the soft part of about a dozen blanched oysters to it, and an anchovy. A little ham or tongue grated gives a still greater relish. They sometimes stuff turkeys and fowls with pork sausage meat. No. 40. Sausage Meat. Chop two pounds of lean pork and one pound of fat, not too fine, with the crumb of a penny loaf, which must be soaked in water for an hour previous. "W hile chop- ping add a spoonful of water, two eggs, a little sage, pepper, and salt to your taste, and a small quantity of nutmeg, if you like it. These ingredients must be well mixed together. If to make sausages, the skins must be a little more than half filled. These are plain, but very delicate and nice.23 IV. SAUCES. No. 41. White Roux, or Thickening. Clarify four ounces of butter, with which mix about eight table-spoonfuls of flour in a stewpan, on a slow fire ; stir it well with a wooden spoon till perfectly smooth. Be particularly careful that it is not deeper coloured than cream. Place it over a dead fire a quarter of an hour, stirring occasionally; you may use it directly if wanted, or it will keep, for which purpose put it in a pot. The above, when mixed with about five pints of stock, will be of the consistence of cream. No. 42. Brown Roux, or Thickening. As above, observing that you use six table-spoonfuls of flour, as it must not be so thick. Make this on a rather stronger fire, and let it take a nut brown colour very gradually: be careful that it does not burn, for the slightest catch would cause it to be speckled with dark spots, andyembitter your sauces. No. 43. Sauce Tournee.* Add boiling veal consomme to some white roux, not over the fire, mix it well in, then add consomme gradually rill your sauce is of the consistency of good melted butter ; put it on a brisk fire, stirring without interruption; let it * Sauce yournde and vcloute are not the same, nor lias the latter name been substituted by the moderns for the former. Sauce tournde is of itself an unfinished sauce; it is of itself a basis for many other white sauces, but is in no instance served by itself as a sauce with any entree or entremets. , e.ouie is served with hashes of chickens, veal, boudins a la reine, eminces and entrees of quenelles, &c. This must set at rest all idle contro- crsy on tins subject, as no cook could say that the above is not the case.24 SAUCES. boil up, adding consomme till it is sufficiently thin to clear itself of its scum and butter ; put it at the corner of the fire to clarify, with a few mushroom trimmings and a small faggot (No. 16), with a few green onions. When thoroughly cleared of the scum and butter, strain it through a tammy into a basin, stir it occasionally till cool: this will prevent a skin or film forming on the top. No. 44. Veloute Sauce. Put to stew two pounds of veal, or the legs, backs, and trimmings, of two raw fowls, about two ounces of lean ham, with a small ladle-ful of white consomme (No. 2) ; put the stewpan, covered, on a strong fire; when the con- somme is half reduced damp your fire, to let the veal sweat and throw out its juices, prick it through the thick of it, and let it remain a quarter of an hour at least. When reduced quite low, but without being in the least coloured, throw a sauce tournee (No. 43) into it, and stir till boiling takes place; the fire being renewed, drav the stewpan to the corner of the stove, put in a few mushrooms, a small onion, stuck with a clove, a blade of mace, and a few white pepper-corns. Cover and let it simmer till the meat is done. Skim it thoroughly, and pass the sauce through a tammy. If put aside, stir from time to time till cool. When you have any dishes to mask with this sauce, work a little fresh butter into it, and a spoonful of boiled cream ; after this the sauce must not boil. The addition of the butter and cream gives to this sauce the smoothness to which it owes its name, veloute (velvetive). No. 45. Supreme Sauce. Reduce some of the foregoing sauce, before you have added any butter or cream, till only three-fourthsSAUCES. 25 of the quantity used remain. Make up the quantity thus reduced with boiling cream. When well incor- porated, pass it through the tammy into a stewpan, which put in the bain marie. Work in a little fresh butter. This sauce should be thicker than cream, luscious and savoury. No. 46. Bdchamel Sauce. Take some of the preceding sauce, which reduce nearly one-half. Replenish with boiling cream ; reduce again, on a brisk fire, till the sauce is brought to the con- sistency of double cream. Strain it through the tammy, work a little butter, and put it in the bain marie. For Meager Bechamel, boil a quart of milk, quite new ; melt a piece of butter, of the size of an egg, with which mix enough sifted flour to make a white roux: dilute it with a fourth of the milk, and pour in the re- mainder by intervals. When the whole boils, put the bechamel at the corner of the stove, add the red part of a carrot, an onion, a bunch of parsley, a few eschalots, thyme, bay-leaf, sweet basil, and a little salt. Let it simmer an hour, pass it through the tammy, and reduce it on a strong fire : add, if you think proper, salt, a little nutmeg, and a piece of butter. Pass it through a tam- my to serve with fish. It should be of the consistence of thick cream. \ ou may add mushroom parings. No. 47. Allemande, or German Sauce. Have some veloute (No. 44), which stir till boiling on a brisk fire; let it reduce till it thickly masks the spoon with which you stir it. Add a liaison (No. 22). Stir theun well with the reduced veloute, which will curdle if it boil after the liaison is added ; when well mixed, pass the whole through the tammy, work in a little butter, and put it in the bain marie. cSAUCES. 26 No. 48. Ravigote Sauce. Reduce two or three spoonfuls of tarragon vinegar, with a little ham, tarragon, chervil, and a sliced shalot. TV hen the moisture is nearly boiled down, add a spoonful of con- somme with three or four of sauce tournee (No. 43), Let this simmer some minutes at the corner of the stove; skim well and pass it through the tammy. A few mi nutes before serving add a little tarragon and chervil, chopped very fine, blanched and drained. Sometimes a little lemon juice and cayenne are added. No. 49. White Italian Sauce. Take half a teaspoonful of eschalots, chopped very fine ; put them into a stewpan with a table-spoonful o oil, a small piece of bay-leaf, a few pepper-corns, and a very small piece of ham. Pass these a few minutes over the fire, and add a few chopped mushrooms, very white. When the whole is fried a little add three or four spoon- fuls of sauce tournde (No. 43), and one of white con- sonant (No. 2): stir the whole till boiling, and draw it to the corner of the stove to simmer and clarify, bkim it well, and pass it through a cullender spoon into a small stewpan to be kept hot. This sauce should be rather thin than otherwise. No. 50. Tarragon Sauce.

Mditre (VHotel (Steward’s) Sauce. Take three ounces of fresh butter and a tea-spoonful of flour, which knead well together in a stewpan; add two ragout spoonfuls of consomme, and a tea-spoonful of chopped parsley. Put it on the fire, and stir it till it nearly boils, after which take it off and work in a small piece of fresh butter and a little lemon juice seasoned with pepper and salt. Some make this sauce with sauce tournee. No. 55. Cream Sauce. Slice half an onion, which put in a stewpan with a few sprigs of parsley, a piece of ham, a few pepper-corns, and part of a blade of mace.

Take out the garlick and bay-leaf, skim your sauce, and pass it through the cullender spoon. This sauce, rather thin of itself, must have plenty of truffles put into it. No. 71. Gipsey Sauce. Sweat two ounces of truffles, chopped very fine, in a glass of Madeira or sherry, with half a bay-leaf and a little garlick; fill up with brown Italian sauce (No. 68). When it has sufficiently boiled, take out the garlick and bay-leaf, skim and pass it through the cullender spoon. No. 72. Orange Sauce. Peel two Seville oranges as thinly as possible, taking off the yellow peel only, which cut in thin shreds about an inch long, and blanch it in boiling water till perfectly tender; drain them, and put them into a stewpan with two or three spoonfuls of Espagnole (No. 63), a little brown consomme (No. 5), and a little sugar; let the whole simmer gently at the corner of the stove ten minutes; skim it, and serve it with the addition of a little lemon juice, the juice of half an orange, a little glaze, and cayenne. This sauce must be kept rather thin. No. 73. Robert Sauce. Cut an onion in small dice, previously remove the skins from between the coats of the onion; fry it to a nice brown in a little butter, which keep stirring; add two or three spoonfuls of Espagnole (No. 63) and a little consomme (No. 5): as soon as it boils, draw it to the34j SAUCES. corner of the stove to clarify. Skim it, and serve with a spoonful of made mustard mixed with it. No. 74. JLyonnaise Sauce. Slice three onions, which pass in a little butter with a small piece of ham ; when nicely browned, add Espagnole (No. 63) according to the quantity wanted, and a ragout spoonful of consomme (No. 5) ; let it boil; draw it to the corner of the stove to throw up the fat; skim well, and pass it through a tammy: put it into another stew- pan with button onions cut in rings, fried brown, and drained in a cloth; let it boil five minutes. Take off any butter which may rise, and keep your sauce hot in the bain marie. Some call this Bretonne Sauce. No. 75. Tomata Sauce. Crush half a dozen (more or less as required) very ripe tomatas, and put them in a stewpan over a quick fire, so as to sweat the water from them; then put them on a sieve that the water may drain from them ; slice three or four eschalots, and put them into a stewpan with an ounce of ham, and a dozen pepper-corns; fry these a few minutes, then add the apples ; stir them over a brisk fire till the moisture has evaporated ; then add half a pint of brown sauce (No. 63) with a little consomme (No. 5); let this simmer a quarter of an hour: rub it through a tammy and put it into a stewpan, thinning it sufficiently with consomme for the scum and butter to rise. \\ hen well skimmed, season with a little glaze and a little lemon juice. No. 76. Tomata Sauce a la Vilmet. Chop half a dozen of eschalots very fine, put them into a stewpan with a little white vinegar, and let it reduce35 SAUCES. almost to a glaze; fill up the stewpan with the above sauce and a little consomme (No. 5), that it may be very thin and strong. Pass it through the cullender spoon, and keep it hot for use. No. 77* Brown Cucumber Sauce. Slice a button onion and the trimmings of a cucumber, a little ham, and a few pepper-corns; pare off some of the lean outside of a roast leg of mutton; pass this with the rest on the fire; add some Espagnole (No. 63) and a little consomme (No. 5). Let your sauce simmer gently, skim it, add a little sugar, and rub it through the tammy. To be of the consistence of bechamel. No. 76. Mushroom Sauce. The same as the above without the addition of the mutton and cucumber; and it must be rather thinner, unless for hashes. No. 79- Game Flavoured Sauce. Put into a stewpan some pieces and all the trimmings of whatever game you may have occasion to use, with a small piece of ham, a little sliced onion, a bay-leaf, a small sprig of thyme, and six grains of allspice ; add two or three spoonfuls of consomme (No. 4), and let the whole sweat eight or ten minutes, the stewpan being closely covered : fill up with double Espagnole (No. 64) ; let it 6immer fifteen or twenty minutes ; skim it well, pass it through the tammy, and put it in the bain marie.

Pound the whole well, rub it through a tammy, and keep it in the bain marie. If you have wild ducks, woodcocks, or snipes to serve, add two glasses of boiled claret; if not, use Madeira or sherry, also boiled. No. 81. Aspic of Tarragon. Take a sliced eschalot or two, a few sprigs of tarragon, a few pepper-corns, a little parsley, and half a pint of strong brown consomme (No. 5); let the whole simmer ten minutes or a quarter of an hour ; whip half a white of an egg, into which gradually pour the consomme, stir while you pour: when mixed, stir these on the fire till boiling; then let it simmer ten minutes on the corner of the stove, closely covered, and with red embers on the cover; the egg is then separated from the consomme, which you pass through a napkin. Serve with a fev tarragon leaves cut to any shape, and blanched \ ery green. No. 82. Geneva Sauce. Take a few mushrooms, onions, carrots sliced, parsley, a sprig of thyme, a bay-leaf, two ounces of ham, tvo cloves, a blade of mace, and pepper-corns; pass the whole over the fire with a little butter. "W hen it becomes clear, add a table-spoonful of flour, stir it well over the fire a few minutes, and add good consomme (No. 2) to bring it to the consistency of cream; with this put half a bottle of sherry or Madeira. Let the whole simmer until the roots are done ; skim it well, and strain it o\er whatever fish you have occasion to dress. When the37 SAUCES. fish is done, take it carefully up with a slice, drain it, and put the sauce into a stewpan ; boil it, and skim off the fat. The moisture from the fish will thin your sauce ; you will, therefore, reduce it by boiling. Add a little flour and butter kneaded; finish with a little anchovy butter, lemon juice, and cayenne; and mask the fish with it. No. 83. Genoese Sauce. Take some good browm Italian sauce (No. 68), to which add some boiling red wine.* No. 84. Lobster Sauce. Cut up your lobsters into good sized dice, pound the spawn with a piece of butter as large as a walnut, and rub it through a sieve; put it into a stewpan, adding as much melted butter as required for the sauce; season with a tea-spoonful of essence of anchovy, a little lemon juice, cayenne, pepper, and salt: stir it on the fire till nearly boiling, and strain it through the tammy over your lobster. Add a small piece of glaze. No. 85. Oyster Sauce. Blanch two dozen of fine natives, let them simmer a few minutes, and put them on a sieve to drain; take off the beards and the gristly parts, then put the soft part with a little milk and water in the bain marie, to remain hot till you serve the sauce, which make in the following manner:—Knead about an ounce of butter with a tea- spoonful of flour, to this add the liquor from the oysters, and stir it over the fire with the addition of a little cream. Should you want more sauce than your liquor will pro- There are several sauces made for particular dishes, and made with them. These are given with the receipts for those dishes.SAUCES. 38 duce, add a little sauce tournee (No. 43): season with a little pepper and salt. When this sauce is for poultry or any meat, it is usual to add a little glaze. It should be of the consistency of double cream. No. 86. White or Royal Financiere. Blanch some quenelles of chicken (No. 34) or of game; put some lamb’s sweetbreads whole, or veal throat sweet- breads, into a white braise (No. 14), or pass them in a saucepan with a little clarified butter; the veal sweet- breads when done are cut in scollops. Prepare some bot- toms of artichokes ;* put all these with prepared cocks- combs and kidneys (No. 23), mushrooms done white (No. 21), together with fat livers which have been blanched and nicely trimmed; some egg balls of various sizes, to imitate the eggs taken from the inside of pullets, into a stewpan, with some good supreme sauce (No. 45). Add a few truffles cut into little balls, and stewed in a glass of dry Madeira or Rhenish. Move your stewpan about from time to time, that the contents may not catch to the bottom. If not sufficiently white add a little cream, and work it with a little butter. Keep it hot in the bain marie. No. 87- Toulouse. Prepare the ingredients of the preceding article as there directed, without wine or truffles; throw them into a good Allemande or German sauce (No. 4/) instead ot using supreme. * Bottoms of artichokes become black without great care. Tear off the outside leaves, leaving just a few round the choke. Turn the bottoms as you would a mushroom. Rub them with lemon juice and throw them into cold water and salt. Blanch them till you can easily take oft u leaf, and throw them into cold water. Remove the chokes; leave the bottoms who e or shape them to your fancy. They must be afterwards passed with a little buttered lemon juice and water. Let them simmer till quite tender.SAUCES. 39 No. 88. Chipolata. Take the same ingredients as for the white financiere (No. 80’) ; have them of much smaller size; add small pork sausages, a few small chesnuts boiled in a little con- somme (No. 2), a few combs cut out of streaky bacon. Throw these into a sauce tourne (No. 43). No. 89. Brown Financiere. The ingredients are the same as for the white finan- ciere (No. 86), worked in a good double Espagnole (No. 64), well truffled, rather stronger in wine, and not so thick. No. 90. Chambord Garnish for Fish, Is again Composed of the same ingredients as the financiere (No. 86). It requires double the quantity of wine, and the quenelles must be made of fish forcemeats (No. 35). Work your garnish with a little anchovy butter, and, when dished, decorate with cray fish, from the tails of which you have taken the shells ; you will take off the small claws also. The marinade in which your fish has been boiled is usually reduced and added ; however, you would only use the whole of it when you have a less luscious fish. Salmon is rich and oily, and it would render the sauce so, if too much of the liquor were used. No. 91* Godard Sauce. This sauce is made with the ingredients used for the brown financiere (No. 89), with the addition of a few young pigeons and lambs1 sweatbreads, larded with truffles and bacon : these must be braised by themselves first, and are used to decorate the ragout.SAUCES. 40 No. 92. Macedoine. Take all sorts of roots and vegetables, such as carrots, turnips, button onions, cucumbers, peas, French beans, asparagus, peas, knobs of cauliflower, artichoke bottoms, &c.: these are blanched and boiled separately, and cut in small fancy shapes. When the whole are done, they are drained and put together in a stewpan, and covered with supreme sauce# (No. 45). No. 93. Jardiniere, or Gardener's Sauce. Take roots and vegetables as above, only they are cut larger, and dished in small heaps, each vegetable in a separate heap, in one dish. You previously blanch and reduce the carrots, turnips, onions, and cucumbers, to a glaze, separately; the others are merely blanched till tender, and drained. Add bechamel sauce (No. 46), but do not mask any vegetable except the cauliflower with it. No. 94. Flemish Sauce. Cut some carrots, turnips, and cucumbers, rather large; blanch and boil them separately; blanch and boil some button onions and some large Spanish onions ; the latter must simmer gently and steadily till they come to a half glaze : they must not be broken. Put all except the Spanish onions into a stewpan with a ladle-ful of double Espagnole (No. 64) : let the whole simmer at the corner of the stove; skim and add a little sugar and glaze: keep it in the bain marie for use. When you serve, put your Spanish onions and pieces of cauliflower, well boiled, round the dish at equal distances. * Livernoise sauce is the same as the preceding one, only use double Espagnole instead of supreme sauce.SAUCES. 41 No. 95. Sauer Krout. This article is generally bought ready-made at the Italian warehouses. I will give the receipt for those who feel disposed to make it themselves. Pick off the outer leaves of some white winter cab- bages ; cut the cabbages up in shreds with a knife, or plane made on purpose, if you make a great quantity. Put your cabbage to ferment in a tub, twelve hours at least, and twenty-four at most; after which press the moisture from it as much as possible. Cylindrical stone jars are the best things that you can use to put them in. If you have not these, take a cask with the head out. Mix a few juniper berries or carraway seeds with your cabbage. Put a layer of salt in the bottom of the cask, over which a layer of cabbage four or five inches thick. Lay them evenly, and press them as closely down as you can : con- tinue thus to fill the cask within an inch or two, with alternate layers of salt and cabbage. Cover the top with a layer of salt: on this place a lid, as large as the head of the tub. Place heavy stones on the lid. Mind they must not be calcareous stones, or the acid would eat into and dissolve part of them. As soon as a crust is formed on the moisture produced from the cabbage, your sauer krout is fit for use. As it must not come in contact with the air, and the cover is smaller than the tub, press a wet towel in round the edge, which wash in cold water every time you have to take out sauer krout. You must carefully wipe with a dry cloth those parts of the tub that are left dry as your sauer krout gets lower. There is enough moisture when it covers the cabbage. Your cover must be stout and strong, and entirely of wood. Keep your sauer krout42 SAUCES. in a cool place; if in a cellar, it must be airy and not damp. About two pounds of salt are required to twenty middling-sized cabbages. No. 96. To Dress Sauer Krout. Take the sauer krout from the tub or jar with your hands: squeezing it as dry as you possibly can. Put as much as you want into a large stewpan with a small knuckle of ham, a lean piece of raw beef, and a good piece of butter. If you have no ham, use bacon, and an onion stuck with a few cloves. Cover the whole with soft water, and then with buttered paper. Put the whole to boil, and as soon as it boils, put it on a back stove to simmer, with fire over and under it. It will require about four hours1 gentle simmering. When tender, take out the beef, onion, and ham, and turn the whole on a large sieve over a dish, into which the liquor may fall. Put half a pound of butter into a stewpan, and work a little flour into it to make a thin roux (No. 41). After you have worked this over the fire a few minutes, dilute it with a sufficient quantity of the liquor from the dish to bring it to the consistency of bechamel (No. 46); season with pepper. Throw in you sauer krout, mix it well, and put it in a basin for use. Keep it covered with a sheet of buttered paper. No. 97- Macaroni, luith a Demi-Glaxe, Is generally cut into pieces about an inch long, after it has been blanched and boiled (No. 340). Stew these well in a very strong consomme (No. 2), nearly down to a half glaze; season with a little coarse white pepper, commonly called by the trade mignonette.SAUCES. 43 No. 93. Nouilles. Take a sheet of Nouille paste, rolled very thin, and cut it in shreds about two inches long, or any other shape ; blanch them in boiling water, and immediately cool them; drain them on a cloth, and stew them in good consomme (No. 2) to a half-glaze : season with mignonette. Nouilles are sometimes served with an Allemande (No. 47), or a bechamel (No. 46.) No. 99- Purde of Sorrel. Sweat three or four handfuls of sorrel with the white part of two or three heads of lettuce, over a moderate fire. When the moisture is drawn from them, put them on a sieve to drain. Put an onion cut in slices, a piece of ham, a blade of mace, and a few pepper-corns, to fry with a piece of butter, together with some mushroom parings. When the whole is browned a little, put in the sorrel and lettuce, add consomme (No. 2), and a ladle-ful of brown sauce (No. 63). Let the whole reduce, stirring all the time. When of the consistency of double cream, or rather thicker, rub it through the tammy for use, adding a little glaze and sugar. Some add a little boiled cream. No. 100. Pnr6e of Celery. Slice half a dozen heads of celery, which blanch in plenty of water. Drain them, and put them into a steAv- pari with a ladle-ful of white consomme (No. 2) and a small piece of ham. Let this boil, and then put it on a back stove to simmer until done. Take out your ham, and put it into a larger sized stewpan; then put it on the fire and stir till well reduced, adding two or three spoonfuls of sauce tournee (No. 43), and a little cream.SAUCES. 44 Season with pepper and salt, and rub it through the tammy. No. 101. Celery Sauce. Celery sauce is made in the same way as the preceding; the celery is cut much larger, and instead of a thorough reduction and rubbing through the tammy, work in a little butter kneaded with flour; season with a little pepper and salt, adding two or three spoonfuls of cream and a little glaze. No. 102. White Puree of Onions, or Soubise. Slice a dozen middle-sized onions, throw them in cold water as you cut them; blanch them in plenty of water: when tender, cool and drain them ; squeeze them dry in a cloth. Put them in a stewpan, and stir them over a fire to dry out the remainder of the liquor; add half a pint of cream, and a spoonful of sauce tournee (No. 43); work in a piece of butter as large as a walnut, kneaded with a little flour: season with pepper and salt and a little glaze; rub the whole through the tammy, and keep it hot in the bain marie. No. 103. Endive Puree. Take about two dozen heads, according to the size; blanch and cool them, drain them dry, and chop them fine; put them into a small stewpan with a ladle-ful of white consomme (No. 2), a piece of ham, and a knob of sugar. When the whole lias boiled till tender, put it into a large stewpan and reduce it, adding a little butter and flour, kneaded together, some pepper and salt, and a little cream. When sufficiently reduced, put it into the bain marie to keep hot.45 SAUCES. No. 104. Pur4e of Spinach. Put the spinach in plenty of boiling water; when clone throw it into cold water; squeeze it dry, and chop it fine. Put it in a stewpan with a little clarified butter, in which you have fried bread cut in triangles, if for a second course ; if not, the shape is immaterial, as you only wish to flavour your butter with the bread. Stir it about ten minutes, that the moisture may evaporate; add a ladle- ful of Espagnole (No. 63 ;) season with pepper and salt; a small piece of glaze may be added. For entrees rub this through the hair sieve. No. 105. Puree of Turnips, or Mashed Turnips. Slice a dozen turnips, which boil in plenty of water till tender; cool them, and squeeze them as dry as possible in a cloth: pass them through a sieve; put them in a stewpan, with a piece of butter as large as an egg; add half a pint of milk and as much cream, both boiled. Reduce these over the fire about ten minutes: add a ra- gout spoonful of bechamel (No. 46). Season with a little white pepper and salt. No. 106. Puree of Carrots. 1 ake the red outsides only of some carrots, and boil them in plenty of water: when tender cool them; squeeze them dry in a cloth, and rub them through a sieve. Put them into a stewpan with a piece of butter, as large as a walnut, kneaded with a little flour. Reduce the whole with a ladle-ful of brown sauce (No. 63). Season with a little sugar, salt, and pepper. You may add a little glaze.46 SAUCES. No. 107. Purte of Truffles* Chop about a pound of peeled truffles. Bear in mind that converting your truffles into a puree will not prove a cure for a musky flavour, should any of them be tainted with it; and in this they will not prove less disagreeable than they would in any other form in which you might serve truffles. Having chopped them, put them with a little game, or chicken consomme (No. 3 and 4), accord- ing to what they are intended for; let them simmer gently with a very small piece of garlick, half a bay-leaf, and a piece of ham. If for game, add a glass of Ma- deira. When done, take out the bay-leaf, ham, and garlick, and pound the rest fine, adding a spoonful or two of double Espagnole (No. 64), and rub them through a tammy : add a little more Espagnole after this. Your puree should be of the consistency of sorrel sauce. No. 108. Puree of Tomatas. This is made exactly as Tomata sauce, but it requires to be reduced much more. No. 109. Puree of Mushrooms. Turn as many mushrooms as you may want, and put them in water and lemon juice to keep them white. Chop them with a little lemon juice, and pass them in a stew- pan with a small piece of butter; let them sweat a few minutes, and add a little supreme (No. 45), or becha- mel (No. 46). They become black if they boil too long. Rub them through the tammy. f l saw ti)is puree nouvelle served by that much esteemed cook, M. I\lcra, at the then Marquis, now Duke, of Cleveland’s, five years ago. It is served under entries of chicken, game, &c.SOUPS. 47 To make this puree brown, you would use Espagnole (No. 63), instead of supreme. No. 110. Ragout of Chestnuts. Take the first skin from the chesnuts, and sautez them in a little butter, that you may get off the second skin. Stew them in half a pint of Madeira or sherry, and half a pint of brown consomme (No. 5). When done, take out the chesnuts so that they may not come to pieces. Reduce the sauce, add half a pint of Spanish sauce, (No. 63), pass it through a tammy, and put it with the entire chesnuts. V. SOUPS. No. 111. Vermicelli, Macaroni, and other Italian Pastes. Blanch a quarter of a pound of vermicelli (which is a proper quantity for a tureen of soup for eight persons). Strain, it, and put it into cold water; when it has lain in this a few minutes, strain it off. Before you mix it with soups or consommes, it must be stewed in some strong broth, with a leg of fowl, a head of celery, and a piece of ham. Let it boil quite slowly; skim it care- fully to keep it clear. If your vermicelli is not broken before blanched, it will be in long threads, which would render it unpleasant for use. When Nouille and macaroni soups are served, send a plate of grated Parmesan to the side table. No. 112. Vermicelli Soup a la Reine. Blanch and drain your vermicelli, then throw it into some good chickei^ consomme (No, 3), well seasoned.48 SOUPS. When you are going to send it up, thicken with a liaison (No. 22) of eight yolks of eggs, well mixed with cream, and pour the vermicelli into the tureen, lest your liaison set from remaining too long near the fire. Remark, that all soups with a liaison or purees of meat should be heated au bain marie. No. 113. Vermicelli Soup a la Windsor. Take a pound and a half of lean veal cut in dice, a turnip, a faggot, and about two ounces of ham, a head of celery, an onion stuck with a clove, a few white pepper- corns, a blade of mace, and a quarter of a pound of butter; let the whole sweat over a brisk stove ; then thicken with three spoonfuls of flour diluted with two quarts of white consomme (No. 2). This must be done by degrees to avoid its being lumpy. Add a handful of mushroom trimmings: as soon as it boils, draw it to the corner of the stove, that the scum and fat may rise, which carefully remove; strain this through a tammy on the vermicelli, which has been prepared as directed in No. 111. On serving, throw in a few chervil leaves wrell blanched and very green. N. B. This was a very favourite soup with his Ma- jesty George III., from whose kitchen it was first served. With his more Epicurean successor it was equally a favourite. No. 114. Plain Vermicelli Soup, White and Brown. Boil a quarter of a pound of vermicelli as directed (No. Ill); on which pour two quarts of good chicken stock (No. 3), for a white soup; for brown, use • two quarts of brown veal stock (No. 5) instead of chicken.49 SOUPS. No. 115. Plain Rice Soup. Pick out all the broken and husky grains from a quarter of a pound of the best rice, and wash it in several waters until it appears quite clearly in the water. Blanch it in a quart of cold water; as soon as it boils, take it off, and throw it into a sieve, over which pour cold water; drain it well, and throw it into two quarts of good white or brown consomme (No. 2 or 5), with the leg of a chicken, a head of celery, a piece of ham, and a little parsley, tied all together. Let this boil three quarters of an hour at the corner of the stove : skim it well, and take out the faggot previous to serving. No. 116. Rice and Chicken Soup. Boil two chickens in your veal consomme (No. 2) ; when done, but not too much, put them by to cool. Wash and blanch a quarter of a pound of the best rice as in No. 115. When thus prepared, stew it in a quart of the consomme in which the chickens have been boiled; into which, when the rice is done, put your chickens, cut up in pieces, and skinned; add three pints more of the consomme; just boil the whole up and skim it well. Add a little salt if necessary. No. 117. Puree of Rice Soup. Prepaie the rice as above in a very white consomme (No. 2 or 3); take the crumb of a French roll, with the yolks of two or three hard eggs, which soak with the roll in some consomme. When the rice is sufficiently boiled, so as to crush between the finger and thumb, pound it, together with the bread and eggs, and moisten with a good strong consomme to about the consistence of potage a la reine (No. 165). Pass it through a tammy with i)50 sours. half a pint of cream that has been previously boiled. This soup must be warmed au bain marie, and served with fried bread in dice. No. 118. Puree of Barley Soup. This is the same as the preceding, with this difference only, that you omit the yolks of eggs, and use strong con- somme (No. 2), in which mutton and a faggot of two beads of celery, with parsley, have been boiled. This may be put on the fire, and stir until it boils. No. 119. Puree of Turnip Soup. Take eight or nine turnips, more or less according to the size ; slice them, and if, in the winter, you have strong turnips, blanch them slightly. 9. ake a laige onion, half a head of celery, both of which slice and pass with a little butter, in a three-quart stewpan. Let your turnips be well drained, if blanched, and thrown into the stewpan with about a quarter of a pound of lean ham, and the crumb of a French roll. If intended for a brown soup, add the crusts of two rasped French rolls instead of the crumb of one. Cover this with a quart of brown or white consomme (No. 2 or No. 5), which put to simmer on a back stove (small stove) with a little hot ashes on the top. When thoroughly done, which will be in about three quarters of an hour, well mash your turnips with a spoon, and pass them through the tammy. Tins soup must not be quite so thick as any of the other purees ; therefore it will require about another quart of consomme, which add while you rub through. No. 120. Carrot Soup. Take the red part only of about a dozen carrots, more or less according to the quantity of soup to be made;51 SOUPS. d 2 two turnips, slice them thin and blanch them; take the white part of two leeks, two heads of celery, and two onions, sliced, and pass the whole over the fire with a piece of lean ham and a little butter ; drain your carrots and turnips when they have been well blanched and cooled; throw them into the stewpan with the other roots, and cover them with a good veal consomme (No. 2), not too brown: put them to simmer, with the crust of a French roll, on a gentle stove till thoroughly done. Then, having carefully skimmed off the fat, pound the whole, which pass, adding a quart or three pints of con- somme, through a tammy. Put this just to boil, then draw it to the corner of the stove. Be most particular in taking off the scum, of which a great quantity rises: this soup must not be thicker than brown sauce (No. 63), and requires a small quantity of sugar. Serving the soup a second time, you may add any of the Italian pastes, or rice, as directed in No. 111. No. 121. Aurora Soup. This soup is made from the outside only of the short- horn carrots, generally the first in season ; these require no blanching, but are passed in a stewpan with one onion, butter and ham, and the crust of one French roll. The rest as above. No. 122. Green Peas Soup. Take three pints of green peas, not too old, and let them sweat thoroughly on the fire with a faggot of green onions, parsley, a little mint, and a quarter of a pound of ham. When done, pound and moisten them with a good white stock (No. 2) to about the same consistence as the other puree soups. Set this to boil gently about twenty minutes at the corner of the stove, and skim well. WhenSOUPS. 52 about to serve, colour your soup with a little parsley and spinach green, as dry as you can obtain it between two cloths. Mix your green with about two ounces of butter, well worked in a cloth, that no moisture may remain in it; if any wet particles remain either in the green or butter, it will cause them to curdle in the soup, instead of producing a smooth opaque green. Put your green and butter in a round bottomed basin ; stir them with a wooden spoon, while you gradually moisten with soup, till the whole forms one and the same body. Serve im- mediately with fried bread. No. 123. Faubonne Soup. Cut three or four cabbage lettuces and a handful of sorrel, in small squares; put them with a little butter and sugar, and a good piece of ham, on the fire, to sweat till tender ; then drain them on the back of a sieve, and add them to pea soup (see No. 122). Some of the rulers of the roast give the above name when this addition is made to carrot soup : I have only to say that my authorities are Messrs. Vilmet, Badoi, and Cneppm, of his late Majesty George the Fourth’s kitchen, with whom, if they be wrong, even some of our great cooks ot the day need not be ashamed to be in error. No. 124. Purde of Reel Bean Soup. Soak a pint and a half of red beans about two hours in lukewarm water: drain them, and put them into a stewpan with an onion stuck with two or three cloves, a faggot of half a carrot, a leek, a little parsley, two or three green onions, a sprig of thyme, a bay-leaf, and a blade of mace ; a good piece of ham, or half a pound of the breast of bacon. Moisten the whole with strong light brown consommd (No. 5). When these have boiled till53 SOUPS. quite tender, drain them on a sieve, and pound the beans, together with the crust of a French roll which has been soaked in the liquor. Moisten the puree with the con- somme; rub this through a tammy ; after which it must be made thin enough, by adding more stock, to allow all impurities to rise in boiling gently at the corner of the stove. This soup you must keep as red as possible. Serve with bread in dice. No. 125. Puree of Cucumber Soup. Take six or seven fine young cucumbers; cut three or four of them in parts about an inch long, each of which divide in three equally, cutting from one end to the other: cut off the rind of these and the seedy inside ; trim the edges. You must not use within an inch of that end of the cucumber next the stalk, as it has a very earthy flavour. Throw your cucumbers into cold water as you prepare them; blanch and drain them dry; then boil them in a little good consomme (No. 2) to a half glaze, with a piece of ham and sugar. This process must be quickly gone through, or they would boil to a pap. Pare and cut out the middles of the remaining cucum- bers : slice them, and fry them with half an onion and butter in a three quart stewpan. Be careful that these take no colour. Add a quart of good white stock (No. 2), the crust of a French roll, well rasped, together with a quarter of a pound of York ham. When these are tho- roughly done, take out the ham, skim your soup, and pass it through a fine tammy; put it back into a soup pot, and add about a pint of sauce tournee (No. 43). When this has boiled about twenty minutes, throw in the cucumbers first prepared, and mix the whole with a liaison (No. 22) of eight yolks of eggs, with a little cream and butter. I his soup is served with the crust of breadsours. 54 in rounds of the size of a shilling, or in diamonds. To be kept hot, or warmed up again, it must be put in the bain marie. No. 126. Dutch Soup. Take a small handful of young sorrel and the white part of three or four cabbage lettuces; take the stalks out of the whole, and tear the. leaves in small pieces. Sweat them on a gentle fire, with about two ounces of butter, about an ounce of ham, a small faggot of green onions, with a little chervil; then add a quart of white consomme (No. 2), and a ladle-ful of sauce tournee (No. 43). While this is simmering gently, cut up two cucumbers, as in No. 125, pass them in a little butter, and add them to the rest; also a few pieces of artichoke bottoms, if in season. When you have well skimmed the soup, take out your faggot and ham, and thicken with a liaison (No. 22) of a little cream, a few knobs of butter, and eight yolks of eggs. To be kept hot au bain marie, and served with crust of French roll, cut in small rounds or diamonds. No. 127- Puree of White Bean Soup. The method is the same as for red bean soup (No. 124), only white stock is used, with an addition of cream, worked with a little fresh butter before serving up. The white beans must be soaked longer. No. 128. Asparagus Soup. This soup requires about three hundred heads of aspa- ragus. Cut the heads off about an inch long, pick and scrape the remaining parts ; break them off as low down as they are tender. The heads are blanched separately, and put into cold water till wanted ; the other parts aresours. 55 blanched, drained, and put into a stewpan with two ounces of ham, a faggot of green onions and parsley, the crumb of a French roll, and a knob of sugar. Moisten with a pint of good consomme (No. 2). When stewed tender, pass them through the tammy, and add three pints of sauce tournee (No. 43). Put them then to boil on a gentle fire, that they may throw up the white scum. Colour them with green of parsley (No. 20) ; drain the heads, and throw them on a cloth till free from liquid, and afterwards put them into your soup, and serve with crusts of bread. This soup should be rather sweet. No. 129- Carmelite Soup. This soup is made with soup a la reine, and a puree of lentils, or white beans (No. 127). No. 130. Flemish Soup. Slice six onions, cut six heads of celery into small pieces, and slice about twelve potatoes. Put about a quarter of a pound of butter, with two ounces of ham, into a stewpan, with a little white stock (No. 2) ; set it to stew slowly for half an hour ; then fill up with good consomme (No. 2). Let it boil on gently half an hour more, or until the potatoes are dissolved; then rub it through a tammy with the crumb of half a French roll, soaked in the broth, and add half a pint of cream that has been boiled, and a liaison (No. 22) of four yolks of eggs. Work a little fresh butter in the soup previous to serving; keep it hot au bain marie. No. 131. Turtle Soup. The head of the turtle should be cut off over night; lay the turtle on its back on a dresser, and, as soon as it protrudes its head, instantly and firmly with your left hand grasp the skin of the throat, pressing downwards,SOUPS. 16 and cut the head off with a strong and very keen knife : this is done by skilful hands in one cut. An assistant should hold the fins; the body is then suspended by the hind fins, that it may drain into a vessel placed under it; then probe the knife into the thin part behind the back fins, which will let the air escape and hasten the extinc- tion of sensation in the turtle. Throw the head into cold water, where let it remain till morning. In the morning take the carcass down, and, having laid it on its back, cut off the four fins, but not close to the body ; then apply your knife, about an inch deep, to the line where the back and belly meet, which follow all round, leaving the stumps of the fins attached to the back; with one hand raise the belly, and, with a long knife in the other, detach the belly from the intestines and fleshy parts : take out the gall as soon as possible, with great-care not to break it; take out the shoulders and flesh attached in two pieces; the turtle being turned up on one end, the entrails will all come away with little effort. Wash the shells before blanching them. Pick out the green fat from the shoulders and sides of the turtle, and cut out the remains of the hind fins and neck bone, which must be done by twisting and then cutting them ; tear the lungs away from the back; wash the flesh in cold water, and blanch the parts adhering to the shell in a pot of boiling water, which must be in readi- ness : you will saw the pieces to a convenient size. If a very large turtle the back bone is never used. As soon as you find that you can pull off the shell, which will be in two or three minutes, throw the blanched pieces into cold water, and remove the shell from the other parts. Put on a good stock, according to the size of your turtle and quantity of soup to be made : for your stock use a leg and two or three knuckles of veal, an old lien or two, a knuckle of ham, four calves feet; let these57 sours. d 5 sweat in a good sized pot, and on them place as much of the tender parts of the turtle as you can, and fill up with common broth made from a leg or brisket of beef; the remaining parts put into a pot by themselves; fill up with the best broth you have to spare. In each pot put a good faggot of basil, a little thyme, two bay-leaves, a little winter savory, parsley, a few large onions stuck with six cloves, carrots, and two or three heads of celery: keep your pots well skimmed and gently boiling. Season with a little allspice, long and whole pepper, a few blades of mace, and a little salt. As soon as the softer parts can be separated from the bones, they must be taken off, the bones returned to the pots, and the meat put on flat dishes to cool. Make a roux, scarcely brown (No. 41), in proportion to the quantity of your sauce : if your meat be thoroughly done in your stock-pot, strain it off through a lawn sieve, and mix your roux as for an ordinary sauce, but much thinner. When it boils, draw it to the corner of the stove to clarify. In the mean time cut up your turtle into pieces about an inch square (and not two inches square, as suggested by some gallant, who probably for- got those small delicate mouths from which such pieces would be excluded but for the trouble of further cutting) ; two of the fins are generally kept for flanks. Put your turtle into a stewpan and strain your sauce over it. Boil two bottles of Madeira or good sherry down to half the quantity, and throw it into the soup, with as much of the puree of herbs as the quantity may require ; with this add the stock of the second pot, reduced to a half glaze. b or the puree, take a good handful of sweet basil, a little marjoram, winter savory, all of them green, a little thyme, two or three bay-leaves, a pottle of mushrooms, a little parsley, a large onion cut in slices, half a dozen eschalots, four anchovies, a few blades of mace, allspice,SOUP.". 58 long and black pepper, and three cloves; these must be all sweated together with about a quarter of a pound of butter. You must endeavour to keep them as green as possible, putting a little fire on the top as well as under- neath. When well done, rub the whole through a tammy for use. Take a good quenelle farce of veal (No. 34), with the addition of fines herbes (No. 18), a few chopped turtle herbs, and seasoned higher than for any other farce. This must be a little firmer, for which use a little flour and two yolks of eggs more than usual; blanch them in salt and water. When your soup is made, put it away in small tureens of three pints or two quarts each ; dividing the meat as equally as possible. In order to keep it three weeks or a month, cover it about an inch thick with lard, with which a little oil has been mixed ; it should be poured on when it will only just flow. To be kept as cool and dry as possible. N. B. Before serving your turtle, add lemon juice and cayenne to your judgment. To re-warm it, use the bain marie only. If the green fat be plentiful, do not put too much in your tureens; it is usually served by itself on the side table, with a little sauce from the soup, and handed round. No. 132. Mock Turtle. Split a calf’s head with the skin on it, take out the brains, wash the head in lukewarm water, and, having boiled it till tender in a sufficiency of water to cover it well, take it out, immerse it again in cold water, drain it, clear all the flesh from the bones, and cut the flesh and the tongue into square pieces, which may not require cutting again to be eaten, and put them by to cool. Butter the bottom of an eight-quart stewpan, which lineSOUPS. 59 with half a pound of ham in slices ; on your ham put a couple of knuckles of veal and about two pounds of shin of beef, half an old hen, and a couple of calf’s feet. It is better to put your roots after boiling down your soup, as then they cannot burn, which, if they did, would greatly injure the flavour of the broth. Add a ladle-ful of the calf’s head liquor, and let the whole sweat down till reduced to a slight glaze; then fill up with common broth (No. 1), or the liquor in which the head was boiled: when this has boiled up, skim it, season with a good faggot of turtle herbs and parsley, a couple of carrots, three large onions stuck with four cloves, a blade or two of mace, black pepper, and a little allspice. Make a light roux (No. 41) with about a quarter of a pound of butter, which dilute with your stock when done a little thinner than melted butter; throw in a handful of mushroom parings, and stir over the fire till it boils : set it to clarify at the side of the stove; skim it well and strain it over the calf’s head, to which add about a pint of Madeira (which must be boiled), the juice of a lemon, and cayenne. You will have prepared forcemeat balls of quenelle farce of veal (No. 34), seasoned with a few chopped turtle herbs, and a few fines herbes (No. 10) : these quenelles must be more highly seasoned than they generally are. For egg balls take the yolks of six eggs boiled hard, which pound with the yolk of one raw one, a piece of butter as large as a yolk; seasoned with salt, pepper, and a little nutmeg, and throw into the soup a few minutes before serving.* These and the forcemeat balls arc formed by rolling them on the dres- ser with a little flour, and then blanch them in boiling water.SOUPS. 60 No. 133. Hare Soup. Take a full grown hare, not old; in paunching be care- ful to save the blood which is in the breast; cut your hare in pieces: place it on a dish, with six ounces of butter, two onions stuck with three cloves, half a carrot, a faggot of parsley and sweet basil, a bay-leaf and a sprig of thyme, a quarter of a pound of ham, a few pepper-corns and a little allspice, a knob of sugar, a blade of mace, and a little lemon peel. Put the whole in a deep frying-pan on a brisk fire, where turn it till it is set; dredge with two table-spoonfuls of flour; and when the whole is perfectly browned, but above all, not burnt, to which it is liable if left a moment, dilute with three pints of good consomme (No. 2), and, after a little boiling, turn the whole into a stewpan of a suitable size with a pint of port or Madeira (port is generally used); then put it in a back stove with a little fire top and bottom, just to keep it simmering. when your pieces are tender, having well skimmed off the fat and butter, take them out, trim the best of them, put them in another stewpan, and strain the sauce over them, which must be about as thick as Espagnole, No. 64 (brown sauce). Strain the blood through a fine sieve into a basin, with a few small pieces of butter; add gradually a pint of the sauce, as you would for any other liaison, and mix it well into your soup, which ‘keep hot au bain marie. Serve. No. 134. Hare Soup a la St. Georges. Raise the fillets of two leverets; cut the carcasses in pieces, and pass them in a middle-sized stewpan with a little butter, on a moderate fire, and add a small ragout spoonful of flour; pass the whole again a few minutes afterwards; mix half a bottle of champagne and one ofSOUPS. 61 good claret with it, and four ladle-fuls of good consomme (No. 2), half a pottle of mushrooms, a truffle cut in four, two onions, and a seasoned faggot of half a bay-leaf, a little thyme, basil, marjoram, winter savory, whole pepper, two cloves, mace, cayenne, and a little garlick. When it boils, draw the stewpan to the corner of the stove; skim the sauce well, pass it, and reduce it one-fourtli on a strong fire. To serve, pour it into the tureen, in which you have put the fillets of leverets, saute in scollops, and about thirty small quenelles of farce of partridges (No. 34); add a pottle and a half more of turned mushrooms, and four truffles, thinly sliced, and saute in butter. The garnish of this soup must not boil, or the fillets would become hard. No. 135. Giblet Soup. Take two sets of giblets, cleaned and singed; cut each pinion into about four pieces, and the necks into about six; cut the beak off close to the eyes, and split the head; cut the feet into three pieces, the gizzard into about eight, the liver and heart in pieces of about the same size: blanch these in lukewarm water; when they have well disgorged wash them in cold water. Put them into a soup pot with five pints of the best stock: when these are becoming tender, make a light brown roux (No. 42), and dilute it with the consomme (No. 2), in which the giblets have been done: add a good piece of ham, with a faggot of turtle herbs, a handful of mushroom parings, and a few shalots, an onion stuffed with two cloves, a little allspice, a blade of mace, and a few pepper-corns. While this boils gently at the corner of the stove, trim your giblets, and put them into a stewpan that will just hold your soup, with a pint of Madeira, reduced one-fourth: skim your soup, and when it has fully imbibed the flavour of the02 SOUPS. herbs, &c., strain it through a tammy, over the giblets. Previous to serving, add a little cayenne and lemon juice. No. 136. Mullaga-Tawny Soup. Put into a stewpan about a quarter of a pound of butter, an onion, three apples, a few eschalots, and two ounces of ham, all sliced; fry them a little with an ounce of curry powder, a tea-spoonful of turmeric, a table-spoonful of flour, to form a roux, which dilute with three pints of white consomme (No. 2): take two small chickens, which cut up as for a fricassee, and put them into your stewpan-, stirring until it boils; your soup must not be thick, or it will not throw up the scum; skim it carefully. As soon as the chickens are done take them out and trim them; put them into another stewpan, to which add the soup, rubbed through a tammy. A plate of hot boiled rice is always sent to the side table when this soup is served. No. 137. White Mullaga-Tawny Soup. Mix the above gradually with a liaison (No. 22) of six yolks of eggs, half a pint of good cream, and the same quantity of almond milk, a lump of butter the size ot a walnut, broken in small pieces. If kept hot, put it au bain marie. No. 138. Scotch Barley Soup. Put a small knuckle of veal, half a hen, a small piece ot ham, about six cutlets of the best end of the neck, and two scrao-s of mutton, which put to sweat with half a ladle-ful of second stock on a brisk fire, with a couple of turnips, a head of celery, a couple of leeks, and a carrot: season with a few pepper-corns, a little salt, a faggot of parsley, with a sorio- of thyme and half a bay-leaf: fill up with common broth (No. 1). The six cutlets, which have been nicely80ups. 63 trimmed, and left in one piece, with the bones very short, when done, must be taken out and put to cool. Wash thoroughly clean about three ounces of barley, boil it about twenty minutes, after which cool it, by throwing it on a hair sieve, and passing cold water on it; put it in the stewpan again, with about a quart of the mutton broth, to boil on a slow fire till you can crush it between your finger and thumb. It requires to be kept amply moistened, or it will become thick and pappy. Take two small leeks, which cut in rings, a head of celery cut small, three turnips in small dice; these are first blanched, and then boiled separately with a little con- somme (No. 2): after this cut the mutton put aside into cutlets, which neatly trim. Put the whole together in one small soup pot, with the remains of the consomme strained over it: let it boil gently up; skim again. Add at the top of the tureen a few parsley leaves, blanched very green, and serve.—The parsley is for appearance’s sake. No. 139. Peasant's Soup, or Good Woman. This soup is generally made when you have had a rump of beef braised a day or two before. Proceed thus:—Cut two cabbages in quarters, blanch and stew them with brown stock (No. 5), enough to cover them ; they must simmer gently till well done.* Cut up the thin end of the rump of beef, about a pound, in slices about half an inch thick, nicely trimmed round; lay these in the bottom of your soup tureen, if your tureen has a lining, as you will not run the risk of breaking your meat * Let it be observed, that vegetables for soups or garnishes, except peas, 1 rench beans, and asparagus, must be blanched separately, and sepa- rately boiled down to a demi-glaze with a little consomme, white or brown, as the case may^ require, adding a little sugar and a small piece of ham to each. 1’cas, 1'rench beans, and asparagus peas, are only blanched, and put into the tureen the last thing, to preserve the colour.64 sours. in shifting it from the pan to the tureen; otherwise use a stewpan, and take your meat out carefully with a small slice when hot. Put two quarts of brown clear consomme, with equal portions of carrot, turnip, a fourth part of as much cucumber, all cut about an inch in length, and shaped to your fancy ; also a dozen and a half of small button onions: let the whole simmer toge- ther at the corner of the stove for half an hour; skim well; pour in a small quantity of cold water to make the scum rise. When your cabbages are done mellow, drain the fat well off, pass your knife a few times across it, and put it with the beef. To serve, add your consomme and vegetables, with crust of French roll about the size of a shilling. No. 140. Ox-Tail Soup. Blanch two ox-tails, cut into pieces of a size suited to be served at table; drain them, and put them in a stew- pan with a quart of brown consomme (No. 5), an onion, a fao-o-ot (No. 16), and thyme. Put these to simmer on a o-entle fire, till the meat comes readily from the bones. They are generally prepared a day beforehand. Take out your meat, and put the best pieces into a stewpan with carrots, turnips, cut in balls or lozenges, about an inch long, and a few button onions. If the liquor in which the meat has been stewed is not perfectly clear, clarify it with the addition of a quart of good brown con- somme (No. 5), which strain through a napkin on to your roots and meat. This soup should be rather highly seasoned with black pepper. No. 141- Hochepot of Veal Tendons.

Let them boil very gently, having a paper over them, and being closely covered, with a few ashes on the top. These will take about four hours; they must be perfectly tender. When done, take them out carefully with a small slice, and place them between two dishes till cold. Trim them to equal size as nearly as you can, and put them into a stew- pan with three pints of a good brown consomme (No. 5), and the liquor in which they were stewed well skimmed and clarified, with a very small faggot of chervil: add roots cut in lozenges, blanched and prepared as in note to No. 139- No. 142.

Quenelles of Chicken Soup. Take chicken forcemeat (No. 34), which form into quenelles with two small spoons: take a spoonful of farce, which smooth on the top with a knife to such a shape, that when boiled the quenelle, which will swell out, may be in the form of a pigeon’s egg. When you have shaped it thus, with another hot spoon passed under the quenelle, you turn it out on a well buttered stewpan cover; make about three dozen, and half an hour before serving, blanch them in boiling common broth (No. 1); take them out with a cullender spoon, and drain them on a napkin, and add them to two quarts of light brown consomme (No. 5), very clear. These quenelles will serve another day, if taken out of the soup the moment it comes from table: they will serve for a financiere or ragout of any description. No. 146.

A few minutes before serving, add asparagus peas, green peas, and French beans, blanched, and the latter cut small, to suit the others. Serve with the crust of a French roll, cut to your idea, but put it in the tureen only just before serving. Add a few button onions if agreeable. No. 151. Julienne Soup.

Roll out a sheet of nouille paste, about a line in thickness, and large enough to cut out with a fluted cutter a dozen and a half round pieces as large as a native oyster-shell. On each piece place a little of the farce, not exactly in the middle, and fola the paste over it, so that the edges come together; wet t e edges, and press them together. With the point of the knife make a small hole at the top. Blanch these m common broth (No. 1) that is boiling: they will be done in about eight minutes, after which take them carefully out, drain them on a napkin, and put them into two nuarts of good brown consomme (No. 5): simmer ten minutes on the stove. A plate of Parmesan is served at the side-table.sours. 71 No. 159- Nouille Soup. Koll a sheet of nouille paste out very thin, which cut in stiips about a sixth of an inch broad, and these cut in pieces three-fourths of an inch long: you may fold your paste, lightly dusted with flour, which will enable you to cut several at a time: blanch them in boil- ing water, after which drain and cool them; put them into a stewpan with a ladle-ful of good consomme (No. 5), to stew on a slow fire twenty minutes; strain, and add as much consomme as is wanted. Grated Parmesan should be handed round. No. 160. Prince's Soup. Put a small leg of mutton to roast: cut an onion and two turnips in slices; fry them a little on a brisk fire, in a stewpan, with the crust of a French roll, a ladle- ful of strong consomme (No. 5), and a little salt and pepper, to boil slowly, with a little fire on the top. When your mutton is well done, trim away all fat, sinews, and bone, which put into a good brown stock in preparation : chop the meat very fine, and put it into a mortar, together with the onion, turnips, and bread crust, which you have carefully skimmed; pound the whole well; and add suffi- cient of your brown stock to bring it to the consistence of cream, and pass it through the tammy. Put it au bain mane to keep hot; and serve with bread cut in dice and ned; work a little butter in it.—This soup was much es ecmed at Carlton-house, where it was first served. Observe that soup puree, in general, should be fre- quently agitated with a spoon in the bain marie, to avoid an) curdling, and to keep it as a uniform body. No. 161. Purte of Game Soup. Make a puree of game from roasted pheasants or par-72 SOUPS. tridges, or both: to do this, pound the flesh, with the yolks of four hard eggs, and the crust of two French rolls which have been soaked in a game consomme (No. 4); then rub them through a tammy, with some consomme of crame, to the consistency of cream. Keep it hot au bain marie’: to serve, work in a little butter, and add fried bread in dice. No. 162. Puree of Hare Soup. Cut up the remains of a hare that has been roasted for a former dinner: put a few slices of ham into a stewpan, then the hare, two whole onions, a blade of mace, two quarts of stock, and a faggot of a sprig of thyme, parsley, a little basil, and two cloves: set it on a stove to sunmer two hours or more; strain it oft', and pull all the meat from the bones, and pound it with the lean ham boiled with it, and the crust of two French rolls which have been soaked in consommd; rub the whole through the tammy, with a pint of boiled claret or port, and enough consomme to bring it to the consistency of cream; put it m a stew- pan au bain marie. Work a little butter into it; and serve with bread fried in dice. No. 163. Pure'e of Game Soup the Sportsmans way. Roast four partridges, surrounded with sliced bacon fat; when cold, take off all the flesh, and pound it; and add to it an ounce of rice done in consomme (No. -), with the fourth of the crumb of a French roll, weighing half a pound; pound the whole well; add two spoonfuls of good bechamel (No. 46), one of brown sauce (No..64), and eight of consomme; warm the puree on a moderate fire, and rub it through a tammy. To serve, add, a little at a time, consommd in which you have stewed the carcasses of the birds. Serve fried bread in the soup.SOUPS. No. 164-. Puree of Venison Soup. The method is precisely the same as shown in No. 162; using the flesh of a roast haunch or neck used the day before. No. 165. Queeiis Soup. Well butter a sheet of strong white kitchen paper; cover it all over with a thin layer of fat bacon: slice a small carrot thin, and a couple of onions, which put on the bacon, with a little parsley, a sprig of thyme, a blade of mace, and a bay-leaf pulled in pieces, two or three cloves, and a few pepper-corns. Wrap this round two pullets, putting a small piece of butter inside each, and placing them in a line, the breast ends together; tie them up with twine, put a lark spit through them, and tie them on your meat spit: these require nearly an hour: baste them well to prevent the paper from burning. When they are done, tear off the skins; take the flesh from the bones; throw the bones into a chicken stock, which you have prepared from the flesh; trim away all fat and nerves; chop them, and immediately pound them, with the yolks of four hard eggs, and the crumb of a French roll, soaked in a light chicken consomme (No. 3), with which moisten your puree, and rub it through a tammy: put it in a stewpan, with half a pint of cream, which has been just boiled and skimmed; set it on the fire till hot,—but by no means boiling, or it will surely curdle; do not leave off stirring; skim, and put it au bain marie. Previous to serving, add a little butter, which work in. You should have rather more than two quarts of soup; add bread fried in dice to a gold colour. If expence be an object, use the legs only, leaving the fillets for an entree; or use a fowl previously served. Many add a few almonds to the fowl when pounded. This soup is also served with rice or vermicelli.74 SOUPS. No. 166. Tar tuffe Soup, or Mock Meager Soup. Take a puree as above; warm it au bain marie, and colour it with green of spinach (as for pea soup, No. 122); it must not boil: add, in your tureen, bread cut in dice, and fried as usual. To serve, put on the top two or three spoonfuls of carrots and turnips, cut in fillets, blanched, and stewed in consomme (No. 2). Strew these very lightly on the top. No. 167- Oyster Soup. Pound three dozens of fine fresh natives; put the paste thus formed into three pints of white broth (No. 2), and let it stew gently half an hour; put the crumbs of two Prench rolls, and the yolks of three eggs, boiled hard; pass the whole through the tammy, and keep it hot au Pain marie. Serve with fried bread in dice. This soup is considered very strengthening and wholesome. No. 168. Cray Fish Soup. Wash half a hundred of cray fish, and boil them on a brisk fire, with salt, whole pepper, a little nutmeg, and a piece of butter; toss them and stir them without inter- mission,-a quarter of an hour will suffice. W hen they are all red, take out the meat from the shells; and from the belly take the gut which goes to the end of the tail. Pry some bread till brittle and brown, and pound it with the meat, reserving a few fine pieces; dilute with hg it veal consomme (No. 2), to the thickness of cream: add the butter in which your cray fish were done, coloured with red lobster spawn; pound it well, and add it to your mlr&. then pass the whole through the tammy, and keep it hot au bain marie. Serve vith fried bread, cut m dice.75 VI. FISH FOR REMOVES. No. 169. Salmon Plain. Take spring water, first let it boil, that your fish may be firm; put in a handful of salt, and skim the water; then put in the fish ; the thicker it is the more gently it must boil, and the more boiling it will require. If it is a piece, you will know when it is done by raising the slice of the fish kettle ; the bone of the fish does not adhere to the meat: if the salmon is a whole one, try the bone by putting a knife into the back. It is generally served with lobster sauce (No. 84). No. 170. Larded Salmon and Genoese Sauce. From one side of the salmon take off three strips of skin, about two inches broad, slanting from the back to the belly, and take off on the other side pieces from the parts corresponding with those where the skin remains on the side first done; neatly lard all the parts thus skin- ned ; put it in the form of an S, or serpent, as it is called ; braise it in a fish kettle, with fire top and bottom, and moistened with a Genoese sauce (No. 83). When it is done, drain the fish, glaze the larded parts, strain the sauce through a tammy, and put it to simmer, that it may throw up all fat and scum. Season with lemon juice, cayenne, and anchovy butter. Then put in a ragout of large quenelles, combs, mushrooms, &c. (see financiere, No. 86) : put this carefully round the fish, garnishing with cray fish and lambs’ sweetbreads larded. This is also called a la Chambord. I£ 276 FISH F0K KEMOVES. No. 171. Salmon a la Rothschild, garnished with Hatelets. Place on the slice, well buttered, a fine salmon, the surface of which mask half an inch thick with quenelle farce, made of whitings ; smooth it with the blade of the knife, which dip in warm water ; egg it, and cover it with crescents of truffles to imitate scales ; put the salmon in the fish-kettle with a good mire-poix (see the sturgeon, No. 184), moistened with about three bottles of cham- pagne, and passed through a silk sieve ; season well; let it boil on a strong fire, cover it with a sheet of paper thickly buttered, place the lid on, and bake it in a gentle oven; or place it on a back stove, with fire top and bottom, that it may boil gently and uninterruptedly two hours ; then take it out, drain and untie it; dish and surround with a ragout of scollops of fillets of soles and a white Italian sauce (No. 49); to which add picked shrimps and muscles: garnish the salmon with eight hatelets, composed of smelts, bread crumbed and fried. Serve with a white Italian sauce, worked with a little anchovy butter and essence from the scollops of soles. Serve salmon trout in the same way. No. 172. Slices of Salmon and Genoese Sauce. You will take from three to five slices of salmon, about three inches thick, put them on a slice in a braising kettle; add sufficient Genoese sauce (No. 83) to cover them, and let them simmer gently three quarters of an hour : take out the fish upon the slice ; put the sauce 111 a stewpan, and let it throw out the scum and fat; skim .it well, and add a lump, as large as a walnut, of fresh butter kneaded with flour, the juice of a lemon, a littleFISH FOR. REMOVES. 77 cayenne pepper, and a little anchovy butter. This sauce must be of the consistency of bechamel. You will have replaced the fish during this time in the braising kettle, to keep it hot. Dish it neatly, masking it with some of the sauce, the remainder of which send up in a boat. No. 173. Broiled Salmon and Caper Sauce. Take two or three slices of salmon; put them in a mari- nade of oil, parsley, green onion, salt, and pepper; let them remain some hours, turning them once or twice; broil them on a moderate fire, sprinkling them with the marinade. Serve with butter sauce and capers (No. 60). To turn your salmon on the gridiron, lay a stewpan cover on the salmon, turn the gridiron over, and the salmon will be on the cover; wipe the gridiron well, make it quite hot, that the salmon may not stick; rub the bars with a little of the marinade, and glide the salmon gently from the cover on to the gridiron. No. 174. Broiled Salmon and Tomata Sauce. Prepare the salmon as above. Serve it with a tomata sauce (No. 75). No. 175. Salmon au Bleu. Put some slices of salmon in a fish-kettle with about a pint of port wine, carrots cut in slices, onions sliced also, four cloves, a couple of bay-leaves, a handful of parsley, a few sprigs of thyme, salt, and pepper; let it boil very gently; it is done when the flesh will easily leave the bone. It must be covered by the liquor in which it is boiled. If served as an entree, take off the skin when the fish is done, and mask it with a good butter sauce, in which put capers, sliced gherkins, and a little anchovy butter (No. 26).FISH FOR REMOVES. 78 No. 176. Salmon a la Tar tare. Marinade and broil the salmon as in No. 173; mix six yolks of eggs in a round bottomed basin, with half a table-spoonful of made mustard and a little salt; place it on ice, and work in gradually about a pint of the finest olive oil; this would serve for two or three slices: add by degrees a table-spoonful of tarragon vinegar, and one of Chili vinegar, with cayenne pepper and lemon juice. This sauce should be very sharp, but, above all, do not let it be thin, as it must be worked on the ice till it is suffi- ciently stiff to bear the weight of the salmon; cover the dish about half an inch thick with the sauce, within half an inch of the edge all round; glaze the salmon as you take it from the gridiron, place it on the sauce, and ser\ e imme- diately. Bear in mind that the dish must be kept cold. No. 177. Trout the Dutch way. Boil a trout in salt and water; when done, drain and skin it, place it on a dish, and mask it all carefully, ex- cept the head, with a Dutch sauce (No. 58) rather thick. It is a very good method, if time will allow, to put the fish in the oven a few minutes before saucing. No. 178. Turbot. Put the fish an hour or two before dressing it in cold spring water, into which throw a good handful of salt; make two or three cuts across the back, or the fis 1 "°u <■ break as it swells ; put your fish on in water as above, and skim it well, when near boiling, adding a little more cold water; then let it boil at the side ot the stove, and very gently, about half an hour: when done, drain it, ,pUt the slice across the kettle, put a wet cloth over the fish a few minutes before serving, and dip it in the liquor79 FISH FOR REMOVES. again. Serve it with a napkin or slice under it, and garnish it with parsley. It is also served at large dinners, garnished with smelts, whitings, and fillets of soles fried. The usual sauces are Dutch (No. 58) and lobster (No. 84). Sea water is preferable to any other for boiling all sea fish. No. 179. Broiled Turbot. Rub the turbot dry with a cloth, and make four or five incisions on both sides of the bone and on the upper and under side of the fish ; tie the head up, to prevent the jaws from opening when broiling ; take a small hand- ful of parsley, slice three onions or a dozen green ones, add three or four bay-leaves, two or three sprigs of -thyme, half a dozen cloves, a little mace, and pepper- corns ; pour about half a pint of oil over these ; mix them well together, and lay them in the incisions; oil the fish all over; it must lie in this marinade two or three hours: to dress it, clear away all particles of spice and roots, lay it on a gridiron very hot and rubbed with oil, and place it on a slow fire; when done on one side (the back is exposed to the fire first) turn it as shown in No. 173. This dish requires particular care and atten- tion ; when the meat will leave the bone easily it is done. Rub the white side of the fish with a little fresh butter kneaded with cayenne pepper, and serve it with cham- pagne or Madeira sauce (No. 57). No. 180. John Dory. Marinade and broil it precisely as above : for a plain dinner serve with a napkin under it, and garnish it with parsley. Serve with anchovy or caper sauce (No. 60). 1FISH FOR REMOVES. 80 No. 181. Cod-fish a la Naoarino. Boil a cod-fish, and dish it on the belly; garnish it round with cray fish placed on parsley; add a row of boiled smelts; then stick in it eight or ten ornamented silver skewers, garnished with truffles and soft roes of carp; and serve with it in boats a Dutch sauce (No. 58), garnished with a ragout of mushrooms, shrimps, tails, and muscles, with a spoonful of parsley chopped and blanched. Add to the sauce a little fish glaze, and eight ounces of butter, which mix in before adding the ragout. No. 182. Sturgeon Roast. Prepare a marinade thus:—Take equal quantities of white wine, vinegar, and common broth ; some salt, pep- per, and spices; you may add lemon juice, and even substitute it for vinegar : let the piece of sturgeon lie in this four-and-twenty hours at least, having previously larded it with bacon cut a good deal larger than usual: roast it, wrapping it up in strong paper buttered, and tie it on the spit with a skewer through. Reduce half a pint of marinade, to which add some brown sauce (No. 63), a quarter of a pound of fresh butter worked with a little flour, cayenne, lemon juice, and anchovy butter. Glaze the larding carefully, and serve the sauce round the fish. No. 183. Sturgeon the Dutch way. Boil it as the turbot (No. 178); when done, drain it, and mask it with Dutch sauce (No. 58), and put a little cavice in it. No. 184. Sturgeon Braised. Dauhe the sturgeon with fat bacon, put it in a braising kettle just large enough for it, with a mire-poix of grated bacon, four onions cut in slices, two carrots also shced, a81 FISH FOE REMOVES. good seasoned faggot, salt, pepper, spices; season well; moisten with white wine and a ladle of consomme ; let it boil over a strong fire. Serve with a white or brown poivrade sauce (No. 66) ; reduce the liquor in which the fish has been stewed, skim off all the fat, and add it to the poivrade. Champagne or Madeira sauce is also used. No. 185. Baked Sturgeon. Prepare it as in No. 182, adding a few eschalots, slieed, a bay-ieaf, a sprig of thyme, a little parsley, a blade of mace, and two cloves to the marinade. Put as much of this into a baking dish as will only come up to the larding: cover the whole closely down with strong paper, buttered, basting it two or three times; when done, glaze it and serve it with a little of the marinade reduced, and thickened with a little kneaded flour and butter. No. 186. Boiled Cod. Put two or three slices of cod-fish in plenty of cold spring water well salted. Tie the three slices together, the smallest in the middle, wrapping the flaps round them : about twenty minutes will suffice. When done, drain and dish them; then take off the string: o-arnish them with fried fish and parsley. Oyster sauce (No. 85) is usually served with them. No. 187. Soles au Grutin, or aux Fines Herbes. Take a dish that will stand the fire, in which put a few spoonfuls of fines herbes (No. 18), well seasoned, with rather more butter than usual. On this put the soles, closely trimmed, and without the heads, placing them half over each other. Cover them well with fines lerbes, which smooth over with the knife. Over these strew bread crumbs, from the bottom crust of the loaf,82 FT3H FOR REMOVES. grated and passed through a hair sieve. Half an hour before serving, put them into a sharp oven. In a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes take them out; incline the dish, and skim the fat away : the remaining moisture you take out and strain into a white Italian sauce (No. 49). Let this boil up, and mask round the edges of the dish. If a little can be introduced without disturbing the bread crumbs, it will render the dish more savoury. No. 188. Soles a la Londonderry. Marinade two or three soles, as the turbot (No. 179)> an hour; wipe them, and mask them an inch thick with quenelle farce (No. 34) of whiting, and lobster butter {No. 27) ; smooth it with the blade of the knife, dipped in lukewarm water. Place them on the slice, well but- tered, and put them in the fish-kettle ; add half a bottle of sautern, half a pound of butter, a little salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg. Let them boil on a strong tire; sprinkle them with their liquor; place them on a gentle fire to simmer three quarters of an hour. Put a little fire on top, and sprinkle the fish every ten minutes: dish it ; skim the liquor, and reduce it; add the half of it to a small ragout of mushrooms, cock’s-combs, cray fish, quenelles of whiting, with supreme sauce (No. 45), adding four ounces of butter : mask the soles with two-thirds ot the remainder, and serve the rest in a boat. No. 189. Maclcarel d la Maitre d'Hotel. Take from five to six soft-roed mackarel, wipe them dry, and cut the noses off close to the eyes ; run your knife, an inch deep, along the bone, commencing at the back of the neck, and leaving off within an inch ot the tail. Slice two or three onions, mixed with fennel,83 FISH FOR REMOVES. parsley, and salad oil; season with pepper and salt: fill the incision with this; what remains put under and over the mackarel, with a sufficient quantity of oil to keep it all moist. Let them lie in this marinade three hours before broiling : let the gridiron be quite hot, oil the bars, and put your mackarel to broil, having first taken out the herbs; let them he done on both sides and on the back. When done, take out the back-bone, cutting it through near the head and tail, and taking it out without dis- figuring the fish. Into this introduce a cold maitre d’hotel sauce, thus prepared:—a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, worked with a little chopped eschalot, tarra- gon, if approved of, fennel, and parsley, with pepper, salt, cayenne, and lemon-juice. Dish them carefully, and serve them with a maitre cfhotel sauce (No. 54), adding a little chopped fennel. No. 190. Mackarel the Italian way. Take the soft roes from five or six fine mackarel, through the opening at the gills. Put them into a stew- pan, and cover them with clarified butter; add pepper and salt, and put them into a sharp oven ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. When done, put them in a cool place till wanted. Cut off the tails, ends, and noses of the mackarel close to the eyes, and pass your knife along the backs about half an inch deep. Put them into a stewpan, with a slice under them, and add half a bottle of white wine, with a few slices of onions, a few slices of carrot, sprigs of parsley, half a bay-leaf, and salt. Let them stew gently, and when done drain them ; draw out the back-bones; dish them ; garnish with the soft roes, which must be made hot and drained on a napkin.

Chop some truffles, a little parsley, and green onions, which work with a piece of butter, salt, and pepper, and with this stuff two fine mackarel; wrap them up in vine leaves and slices of bacon fat; surround the whole with strong buttered paper, the outside of which rub with oil. Put a little butter inside at the bottom; put a sheet of buttered paper on the gridiron, and the mackarel on this : let them do over a gentle fire. When done on one side, turn them : when done, serve them in the paper. No. 192. Red Mullet, with Geneva Sauce. This fish should not be emptied. Put them in a deep saucepan, having wiped them, and pour over them a Geneva sauce (No. 82). Put them in the oven, or on a back stove, with fire top and bottom. They will not re- quire more than fifteen or twenty minutes. When done, the liquor must be strained from them, boiled, skimmed, strained, and worked with a little butter. Having dished your fish, mask it with this. No. 193. Red Mullet the Italian way. Wipe the fish dry, and wrap them up in writing paper, well oiled, putting a tea-spoonful of fines herbes under the gills, and a little along each side of the fish. Broil them, or bake them. Take them out of the paper, and serve them, masked with a white Italian sauce (No. 49). No. 194. Red Mullet aiuv Fines Herbes. Put the fish into a deep saute pan, with a ladle-ful of sauce tournee (No. 43), two or three table-spoonfuls of fines herbes (No. 18).

Well scrape the scales away from the fish ; score them as closely as possible, along each side ; season with pep- per and salt, lay on them a few spoonfuls of fines herbes, and finish as for soles au gratin (No. 187). No. 196. Crimped Skate with Burnt Butter. Boil it in water, with vinegar and salt added to it, and a few slices of onions; only let it just boil up: when done, serve it with burnt butter made thus:—boil two good spoonfuls of vinegar, with salt and pepper : at the same time fry some butter till it becomes very brown, and pour it on the vinegar. Garnish with fried parsley. No. 197- Matelotte of Carp, Tench, and Eel's. Cut the carp and tench in pieces; take out the bitter stone from the head of the carp, at the end of the spine. Skin the eels, which cut also in pieces. Take a stewpan, put into it onions cut in slices, two carrots sliced, sprigs of parsley, a few green onions, two bay-leaves, thyme, two cloves, a pinch of herbaceous, salt, pepper: cover these with port wine. Let the eels be half done, then add the tench, and then the carp. Let the fire be strong; cover the stewpan. The carp will require very little time to be done. Fry about thirty small onions in butter till brown : take them out. Have in readiness turned mushrooms, a few artichoke bottoms, fish quenelles rather large; make a roux (No. 41) in the stewpan in which the butter is, which served for the onions; moisten the roux with the86 FISH FOIt REMOVES. liquor from the fish; let the sauce boil, and strain it into another stewpan. Put the small onions and mushrooms into a small stewpan; let the sauce boil again and reduce; skim it; keep the fish hot; drain it. Dish it with the heads in the middle of the dish, intermixing them. Gar- nish them with fried bread, mushrooms, and onions, large quenelles, and a few cray-fish: mask with the sauce. No. 198. Carp Farced. Cut off the heads and tails of two moderate-sized carp; take otit the bones of the carcasses, and make a quenelle farce of the flesh (No. 35). Cut a piece of crumb of bread to replace the part cut out; it should be about half an inch thick. Place it between the head and tail, on a buttered baking sheet, and all over this place the farce. Shape it as nearly as possible to imitate the fish; with a round cutter you will form the scales, having first egged the farce. Mind to dip the cutter continually in hot water. Bake it: put a skewer through it to ascertain when it is done. Dish and glaze it. Serve it with a white Italian (No. 49), or a rich anchovy sauce. Two small ones have a good effect. \ ou may serve it also with a double Espagnole reduced (No. 64), or a ragout of soft roes, mushrooms, and bottoms of arti- chokes, in a white wine sauce. No. 199. Carp d la Chambord. Fill the belly of a good sized carp with the soft roes of small ones, seasoned with chopped parsley, salt, pepper, and spices.

Stew it in a court bouillon ; to make which fry some sliced carrots, two or three, as many onions, and some parsley, with a little butter, till brown; to these add two bottles of port, and half as much water, a seasoned faggot (No. 16), with a little sweet basil. Stew these an hour, and strain the moisture for use. Vinegar is sometimes used, but only when wine is scarce. Dish the carp on a napkin, and send up anchovy sauce in a boat. No. 201. Pike au Bleu. See carp au bleu (No. 200). No. 202. Pike a la Chambord. Scale the pike; to do which, hold the tail in one hand, and run a knife from you, along each side of the fish, between the two skins. Let it be thoroughly cleansed from the blood. Take off some pieces of skin from the sides, and lard the places thus uncovered. Bake the pike in a wine marinade, composed of sliced carrots, onions, mushroom parings, parsley, a sprig of thyme, and a bay-leaf, a blade of mace, a couple of cloves, and a few pepper-corns. Pass this on the fire with a little ham, butter, and a scraped horse-radish. When this has well sweated, pour in half a bottle of white wine, and a ladle- ful of consomme: boil this half an hour, and put it into a baking dish with the pike.

Strain the marinade through a sieve; make a roux (No. 41), and dilute it with the sauce; finish it with a little anchovy butter (No. 26), cayenne, and lemon juice. Skin the pike carefully, all except the head, and mask it with the sauce, which must be of the consistency of bechamel.89 VII. LARGE REMOVES. No. 204. Rump of Beef Braised. Prepare a brown braise (No. 13). Take a fine rump of beef, bone it, and tie it up. Break the bones, and put them with the beef into the braise, which should moisten it to three-fourths of its thickness. The outside part of the beef is placed downwards ; close your braising pan, and when it boils, put it on a back stove to simmer: turn it in an hour and a half. There must be fire on the top: let it remain two hours and a half more. It must be perfectly tender. When done take it out on the slice ; let it drain : trim it, and cut off the strings; glaze it, and put it in the oven two or three minutes; glaze it again, and dish it up.

Necks and shoulders of venison are served in the same way. The Germans sometimes serve the haunch in this manner. Make your sauce as follows. Put a pound of prunes into a stewpan, with a bottle of port wine, half a pound of currant jelly, a quarter of an ounce of cinnamon, four cloves, and grated sugar which has been rubbed with the zest of two Seville oranges, a lemon, and the juice of one orange. When these have simmered on a very slow fire until the prunes are tender, rub them through the tammy. Your sauce should be of the consistency of good bechamel.

Put the lamb on the spit; cover it with buttered paper, which fix with string, be careful not to crush the larded parts. A few minutes before you take it up, sprinkle salt over it, and flour over the parts which are not larded; the larding you glaze with a liwht and thin glaze, that they may have a nice colour.

Take the hind quarter of a ewe lamb, with a fine udder; take off the loin, which divide into about twelve neat cut- lets; put these into a saute pan with clarified butter, sprinkled with a little pepper and salt, and cover them with buttered paper. The leg is generally thrown into cold water, about an hour beforehand, to make the fat as white and as delicate as possible. Prepare a poele thus:—Cut into dice about a pound of beef suet, half a pound of bacon fat; add a quarter of a pound of butter, a faggot of parsley, with a sprig of thyme, an onion stuck with a clove, a few pepper-corns, a carrot, a turnip, and a lemon cut in slices, without the peel. Put your leg of lamb into an oval kettle, having a slice in it, that you may get out the lamb more readily; cover it with water, and put in the above ingredients. As soon as it boils, put it on a back stove: it requires about an hour and a half. About five minutes before you take it up, sautez your cutlets on a brisk fire; when one side is done, take off the paper, and turn them; when nearly done, drain off the butter as much as pos- sible, and pour in a little light thin glaze; sautez them and turn them again. Drain the leg of lamb; dish it; on each side place six spoonfuls of spinach (No. 104), on each spoonful place a cutlet, the fat towards the edge of the dish, then put another spoonful of spinach on each cutlet, so that part of the cutlet is seen.

The turkey must be thoroughly filled, and closed with a needle and thread. Hang it up by the pinions a week or ten days, if the weather will allow. For use, pick and truss it; for braising, wrap it up in slices of bacon fat, with parsley, a little thyme, two bay-leaves, half a dozen eschalots, two blades of mace, two or three cloves, and a few pepper- corns; cover the whole with strong buttered paper, tie it up, and put a lark spit through it, which fix on a com- mon spit.

Having trimmed the half snipes, cutting out part of the bones to bring them to a good shape, place them in rings in the pie, adding sliced truffles between them : mask the whole with the moisture in which the birds were passed ; put in a bay-leaf and slices of bacon fat; cover them with a sheet of paste. Pinch the pie all round the edges, and decorate it to your fancy ; egg it all over, and bake it in a brisk oven. When the top is lightly browned, put a knife through the cover so that it may not break, and cover it with thick paper: let it bake an hour and a half. It should be done just when wanted, or the pie loses part of its flavour. Take off the cover and the top of the inside, skim off the fat, and mask the inside with a brown sauce (No. 65) and an emince of truffles, and lightly glaze the crust of the pie. The sauce is not thick, but strong, as it is worked with game flavour, with truffles, and a reduction of Spanish wine. The covers are not served. No. 319. Raised Pie of Pheasant, with Truffles.

Raised Pie of Vegetables the modern way. From May to August you may have this exquisite and beautiful dish in perfection. First prepare an essence of roots thus:—Put into a middle-sized pot twenty carrots, twenty turnips, twenty onions, all young, eight heads of celery, four lettuces, and four cloves: moisten the whole with good broth, very little salted; skim and let them simmer gently. When the carrots are well done, pass the moisture from them through a napkin, and let it settle, to become clear. Turn from young carrots about a hundred pieces of the form and size of a small olive: blanch them in boiling water, and put them into cold water afterwards. Do the same with about thirty pieces of turnips. Put these vege- tables in separate stewpans, with broth, some of the essence, and a little sugar; let them simmer, and when nearly done, though still firm, place the stewpan on a strong fire: reduce the moistening to glaze, and set them aside. In the mean time, you will have blanched and stewed together eight lettuces, and twelve heads of celery, cover- ing them with sliced bacon fat, and moistening with con- somme and fat skimmed from fowls or butter. Then put in boiling water, with a little salt and butter, a cauli- flower, and half a pint of green peas, half a pint of young Windsor beans, all separately; let the waters be sa t enough, as these undergo no other dressing; the tops of half a bunch of asparagus, an equal bulk ot French beans, cut to the length of the small carrots. Then turn four bottoms of artichokes, which put in boiling water, with butter, lemon juice, and a little salt. Turn a pottle of fine mushrooms, which dress with lemon juice and aFLANKS, OK LARGE ENTREES. 135 good piece of butter. Cut a fine cucumber in four, pare it, and with a cutter shape it in long round pieces, half an inch thick; sautez these with a small spoonful of salt; drain them and dry them on a napkin, throw them into six ounces of clarified butter, rather warm, and pass them on a moderate fire. When lightly browned, drain them on a napkin, and put them into a small stewpan. Pick about thirty small onions; put them in a saute pan, buttered; moisten them with broth, essence of vege- tables, and a little sugar; let them simmer; when done, reduce them to glaze on a moderate fire. None of these vegetables must be too much done, or, when mixed, they are crushed and broken. Drain all except the carrots, turnips, and onions, on a folded nap- kin; arrange on a plate those that are to form the top of the pie. Round the border of the pie form a ring of small cauliflowers and small brocoli sprouts; on this form an- other of glazed onions, then one of small carrots, the points upwards; above these a ring of fine mushrooms, very white. For the middle of the top, a fine artichoke bottom, in which form a pyramid of French beans and carrots. Afterwards you mix and sauce the vegetables in a good bechamel (No. 46), the veloute of which has been worked with a consomme of fowl with essence of mushrooms, and with vegetable essence. First, put in the stewpan a spoonful of French beans, one of carrots, one of peas, one of cucumber, one of asparagus, one of Windsor beans, one of artichoke bottoms (cut as the cucumber, with a cutter), one of carrots, one of mushrooms,; then begin again: only take as much as will fill the pie two-thirds, and sauce well. Put the stewpan in the bain marie, and when you put them into the pie sautez them once or twice only. Then, having pressed and trimmed the lettuces,136 FLANKS, OR LARGE ENTREES. as for an entremet (second course dish), make a ring of them at the bottom of the pie; in the middle, put celery and some cauliflowers: form a ring of small pieces of cau- liflowers, then one of glazed onions, and anothet of brocoli sprouts (these are sometimes omitted). Put the pie, covered, in the hot closet, some time before dinner, that the vegetables may be quite hot. Fill the pie, a spoonful at a time; raise the vegetables in the middle, like a dome, and put on the cover, prepared before. No. 336. Raised Pie—Anglo-French. Trim the fillets of four necks of mutton: cut them in scollops; season them with salt, pepper, and nutmeg; just melt half a pound of butter, in which put two spoonfuls of parsley, four of mushrooms, and as many truffles; the whole chopped fine, with an eschalot chopped and blanched. Raise the crust (see No. 318), dip the fillets in butter and fines herbes, and place them round the inside; in the middle, fine mushrooms, turned and dressed very white, sliced truffles, or bottoms of artichokes, or scollops of lamb’s or calf’s sweetbreads; mask the whole with the remainder of the butter and fines herbes: finish (see No. 318), and bake an hour and a half. To serve, take off the bay-leaves and bacon, and mask with a halt-glaze of mutton worked with essence of mushrooms, of truffle, and the juice of a lemon. You may serve with a brown sauce (No. 64-), with a o-arnish of mushrooms, truffles, bottoms of artichokes, sweetbreads, or a tomata sauce (No. /o)• The same process will serve for fillets of veal, for beef, fresh pork, roebuck, wild boar, See.137 FLANKS, OR LARGE ENTREES. No. 337. Raised Pie the Russian way. Cut in scollops a small slice of salmon; pass it with fines herbes, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Do the same with a small fat liver. Then chop twelve yolks of eggs, boiled hard; raise the crust as in No. 318; line the bottom and sides with rice stewed in consomme of a fowl (No. 3); the rice must be cold, as well as the rest of the garnish: line the bottom with scollops of salmon, on which strew yolk of egg; place on this half the scollops of fat liver, and cover them with yolk of egg. Repeat this, and on the top put the butter with the fines herbes, in which you have passed the salmon and fat liver; cover the whole with the remainder of the rice: finish as before directed: bake it an hour and a half, and serve. The Russian cook adds no sauce; if you like to serve one, let it be a good Spanish sauce (No. 64). No. 338. Timbale of Macaroni the Milanese way. Make two pounds of phte a dresse (No. 736), and four yolks of nouille paste (No. 742), to which add a small tea-spoonful of pounded sugar. Butter the timbale mould well with sponged butter, and have worked and rolled out very thin the nouille paste; form and place the decoration to your fancy; roll out the first paste, cut a round to fit the bottom of the mould, and a long band to line the sides; place the round in first; roll up the band, and un- rol it as you fit it to the mould, pressing it on the decora- tion first put in; make a long thin strip, like a small cord, which place all round the bottom, where the sides and bot- tom are joined, and press it to close the join. Put in the macaroni, prepared as under; moisten the edges of the timbale, and cover it closely with a thin sheet of paste, turning the edge of the timbale over it; lightly wet the whole, and cover it with a second sheet of the width of the138 FLANKS, OR LARGE ENTREES. mould; egg it, score it with the knife, make a hole in the middle, and put the timbale in a brisk oven; let it bake an hour and a half, and serve, having lightly glazed the crust. Put a pound of macaroni in boiling water, with salt and butter; let it simmer on a gentle fire; when the maca- roni swells and becomes mellow, drain it on a sieve; put half of it in a stewpan, strew over it half a pound of grated Parmesan cheese, half a tea-spoonful of coarse pepper, and half a pound of butter; place here and there a spoonful of veloute (No. 45), and as much beef gravy (No. 6); add the remainder of the macaroni, and half a pound more cheese; toss the whole together, and mix it well. No. 339. Turban of Rabbit. Form a ring of good farce a quenelle (No. 34) of old hen or rabbit on a baking sheet, covered with buttered paper; make it about an inch thick, and as high; the vacancy in the middle should be about two inches wide; egg it and bake it: in the middle of this place crumb of bread cut to the proper shape about four inches high, and surrounded with thin fat bacon; raise the farce round this; it must be less at the top than at the foot. Lard the fillets of four rabbits, and put the small ends inside at the top of the farce, over which let them fall outside, sloping to the bottom; between the fillets stick scolloped wafers of truffle or pieces of tongue. JBake the turban thus formed with buttered paper round it; when done, take out the bread and bacon; pass a thin blade under the farce, and, with a slice, place it on the dish. Glaze the fillets and fill the hollow in the turban with an emince ^No. 466), a salpicon (No. GfJ), or scollops; on the top place a lamb’s sweetbread, larded with bacon, or truffles, or a handful of green peas.

Season them with a little salt and pepper, very fine; mask them with clarified butter; add pepper, salt, and a sheet of buttered paper. Cut six pieces of bread in the form of the fillets, and fry them in butter to a fine golden colour: take the nerve out of the under fillets, and decorate them with scollops of truffles, by making small incisions, in which introduce the truffles. Let these fillets be in hall circles, and put them into a small saute pan as you did the others. Sautez the large fillets on a sharp fire : turn them in about two minutes. When firm to the touch they are done; then drain them on a napkin, trim them again, put the butter aside, and replace the fillets in the saute pan, with a few spoonfuls of Spanish sauce, game flavoured (No. 79) : sautez them a few minutes. You will sautez the small fillets in butter, and glaze the fillets of bread.

A pound of flour, a pound of butter, two drachms of salt, and the juice of half a lemon. Place on the dresser a pound of sifted flour ; make a hollow in the middle ; in this put two drachms of salt, a piece of butter as large as a walnut, and about half a pint of water; stir with the right hand only, spreading your fingers; mix the flour gradually, adding more water if necessary, to form a paste, which must be rather firm ; then work it, pressing the hand on the dresser, so that in a few minutes the paste may be soft to the touch, and as smooth as satin. Do not spread the flour so as to let the water escape, but work it up lightly, so that there may be no hard or soft parts, or your paste will not be good. Only take time to work it up lightly and gradually into a uniform260 PASTES. body; no strength or pressure must be used ; and your paste cannot fail to be good. When you pull the paste out a little, if it draws back upon itself, it is tough, and not well made ; spread it out, and put pieces of butter as large as a nut in different places on it; work the paste again, and it will attain the proper consistency. It should not be too soft nor too firm,—just between the two. The butter must be worked sufficiently to soften it, that it may mix easily with the other ingredients. This applies to the cold season. When too soft, in summer, put it in iced water in pieces; to use it, take it out, and work out the water in a napkin. Roll out the paste to a square, place the butter on the middle, and enclose it in the paste, which must be equally thick all round it; let this be done quickly; roll it out on a slab or dresser; when the sheet of paste is about three feet long and one wide, fold it on itself, length- ways, in three, equally ; turn up one end first, then the other over that; turn it sideways, that is, bring next to the right hand the corner which was nearest to your left; roll it out as before; fold it a second time, shifting the position as before, and roll it down two inches longer than it is wide, and quickly place it on a baking sheet dredged with flour ; place it on pounded ice; put a nap- kin round the paste, and a baking sheet with pounded ice over this: this is to keep the surface of the paste cool, and especially to prevent its being softened by a warm atmosphere : in three or four minutes turn it over, cover it, repeat this operation, and then roll it two more turns as above described ; replace it on ice, and turn it over as before; then roll it a turn and a half or two turns, accord- ing to its use.PASTES. 261 It must be baked six or eight minutes after this, or it relaxes, in some measure, and turns grey in baking. No. 737- Paste for Raised Pies. Three pounds of flour, four yolks of eggs, a pound and a quarter of butter, and an ounce of salt. Sift three pounds of flour; make a hole in the middle, in which put an ounce of salt, four yolks of eggs, a pound and a quarter of butter, worked in winter, and a glass of water; mix the butter and the liquid first, then the flour, which gradually moisten, mixing and pressing it lightly; then fraise it, once in summer, and twice or three times in winter, that is, rub the whole by degrees between the wrists and the dresser till it becomes a uniform body of paste, firm, but not tough ; spread the paste out, and sprinkle a few drops of water on it, to moisten it to point, but beware of making it too soft; work it; gather up a fourth of it, which press firmly between the hands and the board; in about a minute it will become very malleable; do the same with the other quarters ; put them one on the other, mix the whole, and put it in a damp napkin if not used immediately. Quickness is an essential point in this operation, as the heat of the hands, especially in summer, is very unfavourable to this paste; it occasions it to break in working it; when such is the case, cut it in slices; moisten these lightly at the surface, and mix again ; put it in a damp napkin, and set it aside half an hour. The wetting to point is the main difficulty in this paste. No. /38. Paste for Hot Raised Pies. Tor a hot pie, served as an entree, three quarters of a pound of flour, six ounces of butter, two yolks of eggs, and two drachms of salt.262 PASTES. Work this the same as the preceding, only fraise it one turn more. This paste is used for flanks of fruit and cream. No. 739. Fine Paste (Pate Fine) for Timbales. Three quarters of a pound of flour, eight ounces of butter, two yolks of eggs, and two drachms of salt. Proceed according to the foregoing directions. No. 740. Pat6 Fine (Fine Paste) for Entrde Tourtes. Three quarters of a pound of flour, ten ounces of but- ter, two yolks of eggs, and two drachms of salt. Proceed as in No. 7375 paste for raised pies; let this be a little softer. No. 741. Pate Brisee (Short Paste), or Demi-Puff Paste. Three quarters of a pound of sifted flour, two drachms of salt, two eggs, half a glass of water, and ten ounces of butter ; mix it as puff paste (No. 736), only let this be rather stiffer: the butter must be in pieces; so that having rolled it four times, the same as puff paste, it will have a little of the effect of puff* paste in baking. No. 742. Nouille Paste. Six ounces of sifted flour, in the middle of which a pinch of salt, and seven or eight yolks of eggs ; mix ; the paste should be firm ; fraise it five turns ; cut it in four equal parts, and roll them down as thin as possible ; cut the first sheet in strips two inches wide ; dredge them lightly with flour; place four of these strips on each other, and cut them across as thin as possible; detach them by moving them about a little; put them on covers. They form a sort of vermicelli.263 PASTES. Cut the whole up in the same way. When thus prepared, if for an entree, put them in boiling broth ; for an entremet, in boiling cream. No. 743. Brioche Paste. Three pounds of flour, an ounce of yeast, an ounce of salt, an ounce of sugar, half a glass of cream, twenty- eight to thirty eggs, and two pounds of butter. Sift three pounds of flour ; take one-fourth of it, and make the hollow in the middle; add a glass of lukewarm water, an ounce of good yeast, which dilute directly, and, little by little, mix lightly; add enough lukewarm water to form a rather soft and light paste: when you have beaten and worked it some minutes, it should come easily from the dresser or the hand ; gather up this paste to put it into a small stewpan, which set in a moderately warm place ; lay a napkin over it. Place the remainder of the flour on the dresser, an ounce of salt in the middle, an ounce of pounded sugar, and half a glass of cream; stir this; and add from twenty ’ six to thirty eggs, according to the size ; when all the eggs are broken, add, in small pieces, two pounds of butter ; then mix in the flour gently : fraise it three turns in the winter, so as to mix the butter through the whole body of the paste, which should be rather soft; if not add eggs ; the yeast paste being fully up, add it to the other, and mix the two thoroughly; put the whole in a arge wooden bowl; fraise a little of what sticks to the board, lightly flour the paste, cover it with a napkin, gen tieUt ^ ^ ^ n° dl'aught and the heat is Phis paste is usually made over-night for use the next day ; when this is the case, lightly flour the dresser the first thing m the morning, spread out the paste on it, andPASTES. 26-4 fold it on itself; put it back in the pan, and repeat this in three or four hours. When used it requires a strong and thoroughly heated oven. Air bubbles at the surface, softness, and elasticity, are symptoms which denote good paste ; otherwise it is dead, sticks to the fingers, and will only be heavy, close, and unpalatable; the fermentation has not been good. It must not be made more than twenty-four hours before baked. No. 744. Pate cTOffice (Confectionary Paste). A pound and a half of butter, a pound of sugar, two eggs, and three or four yolks, and a pinch of salt. ° Mix the eggs and sugar in the middle before you work in the flour; afterwards fraise it five or six turns, and the paste should be very smooth and supple, or you would and a yolk or a white ; roll it out, and cut it to the form required, and bake it on a baking sheet very lightly buttered; previously you will press it carefully on the baking sheet, that all the air may be expelled, for if any remain it deforms the paste when baking; if any blisters or bubbles rise, notwithstanding, prick them with a knife. No. 745. Tart Paste. Sift a pound of flour ; add six ounces of butter in pieces ; and rub the whole between the hands; make a hollow in the middle ; add two ounces of sugar and a pinch of salt, four yolks of eggs, and two wine-glasses of water ; mix this well together, to form a stift paste: it too much worked it will crack and break, being what is technically called burnt. In this case add a little water.JIINCE MEAT, &C. 265 No. 746. Mince Meat.

Weigh a pound of fine sugar, on which you have rubbed the zest of an orange ; let it be perfectly dry when used. Put half a pound of this in the yolks, and stir them up, so as to leave no lumps; add the remainder, and work it well twenty minutes; whip the whites very firm; but, to prevent their turning to snow, add a good pinch of cal- cined and pulverised alum. When sufficiently whipped, which you will know by the whites forming little risings where the whisk is taken out, take some of them on the whisk, and mix them with the yolks; work the whites still, or they will turn to snow: pour the yolks gently to the whites, which stir with the whisk ; pass the whole through the tammy, and over this seven ounces of po- tatoe &flour, which mix as you pass it. The mixture should run from the spoon, forming a thread smooth and thin. Thin a few spoonfuls of the paste, which pour into the bottom of the mould, that no air may remain, which would cause air bubbles on the biscuit when done; put the remainder of the paste in the mould, and place it on a baking sheet; on this you previously put ashes an inch thick: put the biscuit in the middle of a mode- rate oven, which keep close an hour. Observe the biscuit:291 SWEET ENTREMETS. o 2 if it takes colour too fast put a few sheets of paper over it: in an hour take it out; if nicely coloured and firm to the touch, pass a baking sheet over the mould, turn it upside down, and take it off; put a double band of paper round the bottom of the biscuit and tie it on; put the biscuit at the mouth of the oven a few minutes. Should the biscuit be soft to the touch when taken out continue to bake it till firm. You can use wheaten flour instead of potatoe flour: dry it an hour in a very gentle oven, then sift it: nine ounces will be the quantity. Butter the mould with clarified or sponged butter; then put in sugar, sifted fine, and mask the inside of the mould with it, shaking it and turning it: let it stand some minutes, and do this again. There must not be too much butter, or you will have too much sugar, and the colour of the cake will be spoiled. No. 827. Savoy Biscuit filled with Whipped Cream.

YEASTS. Hops loose their flavour by exposure to the air and damp. They should be kept in a dry close place, and lightly packed. Take a single handful of hops, and boil them well, then put half a pint of flour into a basin or pan, pour the hops through a strainer on to the flour, whilst boiling hot; stir this well, to about the consistency, of pancake batter, and add a tea- spoonful of salt, then pour it into a jug to ferment j after it has perfectly fermented add just yeast enough to cause it to rise: say to one quart of this preparation a cup of yeast; after it is entirely done fermenting cork it up tightly, and keep it in a cool place. Potato Yeast. Take one quart of medium sized good Irish potatoes, boil them, pare and mash them with a wooden spoon, then pour boiling water over them until they are of the consistency of paste ; strain this through a cullender, and to one quart of this add a wine glass and a half of good yeast, and three large spoonsful of brown sugar ; stir this well together, and put it into a perfectly clean stone jug ; if kept moderately warm it can be used in twenty-four hours. In summer this will keep four or five days, and in winter a week or ten days.

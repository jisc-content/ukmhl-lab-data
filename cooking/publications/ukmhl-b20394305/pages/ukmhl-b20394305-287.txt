279 Preserving, &c Tomatoes to Keep for Cooking. Select good ripe tomatoes; scald and skin them; then chop them but not very small; put them into strong pint porter bottles; do not fill up the bottles to the cork with the fruit, or the bottles will burst; put the bottles thus filled and corked into a large boiler of lukewarm (not more) water; let it gradually heat, and be kept boiling seven hours; the boiler must then be removed from the fire, and the bottles allowed to cool in the water; then dip each bottle corked tightly into the cement made as directed; keep them in a cool, airy place. Preserved Green Rose Peppers. Select the green rose pepper, as many as required; cut out with a sharp knife all the seeds; make a strong brine; lay them in this for six days, until they become yellow; then put them in clean cold water for four days; change the water daily to soak out the salt; then place them in a preserving kettle, with alternate layers of green cabbage leaves and peppers; place the kettle containing them over a very moderate heat; let them remain until quite green, then remove them from the kettle and make a strong ginger water, and let them remain in this water four days ; then make a syrup as directed of loaf sugar; drain the peppers well and put them in a deep dish or pan, and pour over the warm syrup ; let them remain in the pan for two hours; then pour off all this syrup and again heat it, and pour it warm over the peppers; let them lay in the syrup all night; in the morning pour off the syrup and add to it one pound and a half of loaf sugar, to every pound of peppers; shave very thinly the oily part of the rind of four fresh lemons, according to the number of peppers, just to flavor the syrup; boil the rind in the syrup; put the peppers into glass jars; and pour the syrup over them warm; fill up the jar well with the syrup; then lay on a piece of linen and cork lightly, and dip the corks in the cement; in a month they are fit for use; and if this direction is strictly observed they are very delicious.

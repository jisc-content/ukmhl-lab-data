Jellies and Jams. 293 Gi^APE Jam. Boil the grapes in just water enough to make them tender, strain them through a colander, then to one pound of pulp put one pound of good brown sugar, boil this half an hour; the com- mon wild grape makes a nice jam. Gelatine Jelly. Take three ounces of gelatine, two quarts of water, one pint of wine, three lemons squeezed, one and a half pound of sugar, three eggs and shells; boil twenty minutes without touching; pour all through a flannel cloth into a colander, and cool for use, Easpberry Jam. Take three pounds of raspberries, mash them and boil them twenty minutes; put one pint of currant juice, and coddle them as for jelly; then add three-quarters of a pound of sugar to each pound of the fruit, and boil it until it will jelly. To Preserve Cocoanut. Make a hole in the shell and pour off the milk ; then break the nut and pare off the brown skin, grate and add the milk after a teacupful of crushed sugar is put into it, and dissolved; after it is put into the preserving kettle stir it constantly, to prevent burning, about fifteen minutes, or perhaps twenty; then turn it out to cool. 25*

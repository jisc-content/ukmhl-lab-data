Bread and Cakes. 198 pounds of cleaned currants, five grated nutmegs, half an ounce of pounded cinnamon, one tea-spoonful of ground cloves sifted, one pound of citron cut into thin slices; these must be well mixed; bake in a buttered pan in rather a moderately heated oven. This improves by keeping. Twelfth CakeÂ« Cream two pounds of butter and two pounds of sifted loaf sugar; take one large nutmeg grated, half an ounce of ground alspice, one tea-spoonful of ground cinnamon, the same of gin- ger, the same of coriander seeds, and one wine-glass of brandy; mix these well, then beat very light eighteen eggs; cut into thin slices half a pound of citron, and the grated rind of two lemons; beat this for at least half an hour until perfectly light; line the pan with buttered white paper, and bake in rather slow heat for four hours: when nearly cold, ice it as directed. Macaroones. Take twelve whites of eggs, beaten to a froth with one pound of sifted sugar; add half a pound of blanched and pounded sweet almonds, and a little rose water; this must all be beaten to a stiff froth; when done, with a spoon place this mixture on a paper in a circular form, or as fancy may dictate ; if too soft add more sugar. Put them on the baking tins, in a moderately heated oven; avoid opening the oven until they are done. A few nonpareils sprinkled over them improve their appearance; it must be done before putting them into the oven; when a light brown they are done. Almond Macaroones. Blanch and pound three-fourths of a pound of sweet almonds, and one-fourth of a pound of bitter almonds ; rub into this paste one pound of pulverized white sugar, the whites of four eggs beaten to a froth, and a table-spoonful of orange-flower water;

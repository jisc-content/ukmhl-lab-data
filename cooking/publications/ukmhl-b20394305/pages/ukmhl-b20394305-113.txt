The principal skill required in accomplishing this dish is the boning, this must be done with a very sharp knife, com- mence on the underside of the joint, passing the knife under the skin until exactly over the bone, then cut down to it, pass the knife round close to the bone right up to the socket, then remove the large bone of the thickest end of the leg, seeing the meat is clear of the bone ; you may then draw out the re- maining bones easily. Put in the orifice a highly seasoned forcemeat, fasten the knuckle end tightly over, replace the bone at the base of the joint, and sew it in. It must be well basted, and should be sent to table with a good gravy; when dished pour over it a wine glass of wine. Serve hot. Pigeons in Jelly. Make some jelly of calf's foot, or if you have the liquor in which a knuckle of veal has been boiled, it will answer the same purpose; place in a stew-pan with a bunch of sweet herbs, a blade of mace, white pepper, slices of lean bacon, some lemon peel, and the pigeons, trussed and their necks propped up to make them appear natural, and stuifed with salt oysters. Bake them; when they are done, remove them from the liquor, but keep them covered close, that their colour may be preserved. Eemove the fat, boil the whites of a couple of eggs with the jelly to clear it, and strain it; this is usually done by dipping a cloth into boiling water, and straining it through it, as it prevents anything like scum or dirt sweeping through the strainer. Put the jelly rough over and round the pigeons. Young chickens are nice if done in the same manner. This is a supper dish, as it is served cold.

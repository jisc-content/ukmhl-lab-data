A Nice Pufe Paste. Sift into a pan one pound of best flour; cut into this three- quarters of a pound of best butter, then moisten it with one pint of very cold water; mix it with a knife, then dust your pie- board well with flour and turn out your paste, then cut up into small thin slices a quarter of a pound more of butter, and add this in three rollings, using a quarter of a pound of sifted flour for the rollings; handle it as little as possible, and use a knife for mixing the paste; paste should be made in a cool place, and in summer laid on the ice for an hour before using. Oyster Pie. Pour boiling water on the oysters, a few at a time; open them carefully, strain the juice so as to be free from all particles of shells; then lay the oysters thickly in the bottom of the pie dish; put the juice on the fire; while simmering, skim it well, throwing in a spoonful of whole alspice, and a few whole pepper grains; grate some nutmeg in, and salt to the taste; then stir into a cup of cream a large spoonful of flour; when quite smooth stir it into the juice while boiling; then cut up into small pieces a quarter of a pound of good butter and stir in ; pour this over the oysters, in the dish; fill it nearly full of oysters and juice. While this is cooling make a nice puff paste, and when the oysters are cold lay a margin of paste all around the edge of the dish ; then roll out the covering for the top, and lay on ; pass a knife around the edge and make it smooth; ornament the top covering with a rose of paste; beat up the yolk of an egg with a very little water, and spread it thickly over with a featherâ€” this gives a pretty glazed appearance to the paste; bake half an hour, and serve hot.

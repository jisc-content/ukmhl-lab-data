â€¢ 23 266 SALTING MEAT. This is a most important operation in the culinary prepara- tions ; the best pieces for corning are the ends of the rump, the thin end of the sirloin, and the edge bone; if alternate streaks of fat and lean are prepared, the pieces called the brisket and round are very good; the edge bone affords the lean meat; so much for beef. The choice pieces are the shoulder and hams for pork. A brine for beef is made strong enough to bear an egg, with alum salt, and a tea-spoonful of saltpetre to every ten pounds of beef; let it remain in nine days only; the best piece for chipping is the round; hang that up to dry but not to smoke; all the other pieces for boiling must have a little smoking to keep, and for the flavour, two hours for two or three days only in the smoke; if this is strictly followed, it will (the beef being of a good quality) be very fine; smoke to be made of hickory wood; then to be hung in a dry place for use. Curing Hams. Pack the hams and shoulders in a cask; a bushel of alum salt to the thousand weight of pork, a tea-spoonful of pounded saltpetre to every pint of salt; let this all be very accurately proportioned; then lay in the pork skin side down, then the salt and saltpetre; another layer of pork, then salt and saltpetre; so on until the cask is full; not a drop of water used with it, as it makes its own pickle : cover it up for six weeks, then hang up and smoke with hickory saw-dust or chips, for four or five days;

Desserts, Jellies, Blanc-Manges, &c. 307 Cream Cheese. Take your rennet and cover it with scalding water; let this remain in for two days. Then to a large milk pan of new milk add one quart of rich cream; strain into it as much boiling water as will make the milk warm; then add as much water from the rennet as you think will turn it, say two table-spoonsful; when it is sufficiently turned lay a thin cloth in a sieve^ and put in your curd to drain ; then put a cloth in your press, lay on something to keep it down; let it remain until the whey is well drained from it; then take out the curd, and put it in a dry place with the hoops over it; salt the side that is up, the next day turn it and salt the other side. Devonshire Cream. Set the risen cream on a warm place, and as it rises skim it off and set it aside; sweeten it, and grate nutmeg over it; this is very nice for tea, with sweetmeats. Apple Float. Twelve large apples, quartered, cored and boiled in as little water as possible and passed through a sieve; when cold add two whites of eggs, beatenâ€”-sweeten to taste; beat all up with a spoon till quite stiff. Have made previously a soft custard, with the two yolks. Flavor and sweeten slightly. Lemon Cream. Pare the rind very thin from four fresh, lemons ; squeeze the juice and strain it, put them both into a quart of water, sweeten to your taste; add the whites of six eggs beaten to a froth; put it on the fire, and keep stirring it until it thickens; but do not let it boil; pour it in a bowl; when cold, strain it through a sieve; put it on the fire again, and add the yolks of the eggs; stir until quite thick, and when cold serve up in small glasses, and on each glass lay a maccaroon.

105 Stews, &c. Stewed Calf's Liver. The liver must be fresh and well washed. Put the heart and haslet on to cook in just enough cold water to cover them. While they are cooking—which must be done in the early part of the morning—lay the liver in cold water and vinegar, with plenty of salt, until ready for cooking; then let the heart and haslet simmer for half an hour, skimming the water well while boiling, and slice two or three onions and boil with them ; take out the onions and strain the water in which they were boiled. Then prepare the liver, by making incisions in it, and cutting narrow strips of corned pork, un- cooked, and putting into the openings in the liver; the more it is thus larded with pork, the better will be the flavour. Lay a little bundle of summer savory and parsley, with a fresh sliced lemon, into the bottom of the stew-pan, and on this lay the liver ] then pour over it the gravy made by the heart and haslet, and put in about a dozen allspice, six or eight whole cloves, and a few pepper corns. Let this only simmer slowly—tightly covered, for an hour and a half, then pour off the gravy, strain it and mix with a little of the gravy a large spoonful of flour ; when smooth stir it into the gravy, pour this into a saucepan, and add a wine glass full of Claret wine or mushroom catsup ; let it simmer for five minutes. Dish the liver and pour over it plenty of the gravy. Send the rest to the table in a sauce-boat. This is a delicious dish if carefully prepared. To Stew Ducks. No. 1.

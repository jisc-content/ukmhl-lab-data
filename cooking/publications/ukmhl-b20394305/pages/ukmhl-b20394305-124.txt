Stews, &o. 118 Forcemeat Balls. Take one pound of juicy tender lean beef, and half a pound of nice beef suet, chopped very finely, then take the crumb of a stale loaf of bread, about the size of a large tea cup, soak it a few minutes in cold water, and squeeze it very dry, grate the rind of a lemon with the juice, half a teaspoonful of ground ginger, a saltspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of finely rubbed summer savory, and a little cayenne. Mix these well together, stir in the yolks of three eggs, well beaten, to make them stick together when cooked, divide this in half, the one-half put into the stew-pan, with a wine glass of wine or mushroom catsup. Cover it tightly and let it stew slowly for thirty minutes. The other half make into small balls, the size of a walnut, roll them in flour, and fry a light brown. When the stew is done, lay it in a nice form on the dish, and place the forcemeat balls around it. Garnish with parsley. Toasted Cheese. This is one of those dishes rarely well prepared, but when rightly done is very nice. Cut a slice of stale bread about an inch thick, (a day old) pare off the crust and toast it a light brownâ€”without making it hard, then cut a slice of good fat mellow cheese, (English, Gloster or Cheshire is the best,) a quarter of an inch in thickness, but not as large as the bread by half an inch on each side, cut off the rind and lay it on the toast in a cheese toaster, carefully watch it that it does not burn, and stir it with a spoon to prevent a pellicle or thin skin forming, have ready some good mustard, cayenne, and salt. This is a " rare bit." It must be eaten as it is prepared.

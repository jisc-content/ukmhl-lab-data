229 Puddings, Fritters^ &o. Sweet Potatoe Pudding. Grate three or four good sized raw sweet potatoes; lay some slices of good butter into a dish ; on this sprinkle some of the grated potatoes, about one half; grate on the potatoe half a nut- meg and a very little cinnamon, and scatter over two large spoonsful of brown sugar ; then the rest of the potatoes; more butter and sugar j and mix one wine-glass of rose water, and a cup of cream together; and one wine-glass of wine and brandy mixed; stir all these ingredients well together; bake very slowly two hours ; serve hot as a dessert. CocoANUT Pudding. Grate one pound of cocoanut carefully; beat to a cream one pound of crushed- white sugar, and half a pound of good but- ter ; beat the whites of eleven eggs to a stiff froth; stir the cocoanut, butter and sugar, well together; add one wine-glass of rose water, one wine-glass of wine and brandy mixed; beat these well; grate in half a nutmeg; and add lastly the froth of the eggs; have the dishes ready lined with puff paste, and bake half an hour. Lemon Pudding. Stir to a dream, one pound of butter, and one pound of sugar ; grate in the oily rind of three fresh lemons, and squeeze in the juice; mix this in with the butter and sugar; beat very lightly the yolks of eleven eggs ; add to the butter and sugar one wine- glass of wine and brandy mixed, with one wine-glass of rose water; beat these in well; lastly, stir in the eggs. Line the dishes with puff paste, and bake half an hour. It is most eco- nomical to make lemon and cocoanut puddings on the same day, as the yolks can be used for the lemon pudding, and they will keep for several days if kept in a cool dry place.

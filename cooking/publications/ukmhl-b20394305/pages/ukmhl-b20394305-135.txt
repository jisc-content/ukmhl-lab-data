Stewed and Fried Fish, &c. 129 then some of the pork, then fish, sliced potatoes, seasoning, a little more onion, and then the rest of the pork ; on the top strew very thickly grated or powdered crackers, and over the whole pour a pint of clam or oyster juice—clam is the best. Then mix in a bowl, two tablespoonsfu-1 of flour and half a pint of cold water very smoothly, pour it over the whole. It must be covered up and not opened until cooked, which must be done slowly in three-quarters of an hour. Serve very hot. Lobster Salad. Extract the fish from the shell, place it in the centre of the dish in which it is to be served, in the form of a pyramid : arrange the salad round tastefully, and add salad mixture. This dish is not infrequently garnished with the smallest claws of the fish. This is a matter of fancy—or thus :— The first row is formed of cut cucumbers, the second of eggs boiled hard, and each egg split into four pieces, and the points laid round the salad; the third and bot- tom row is composed of slices of beets and lobsters, garnished with parsley. Scolloped Oysters. Toast several slices of bread quite brown, and butter them on both sides; take a baking dish, and put the toast around the sides instead of a crust. Pour your oysters into the dish, and season to your taste with butter, pepper, and salt, adding mace or cloves. Crumb bread on the top of the oysters, and bake it with a quick heat about fifteen minutes.

199 Bread and Cakes. beat these well together, and drop a spoonful on paper; when the oven is nearly cool lay the paper on a board, and place it in the oven; a short time will cook them. Jumbles. Beat one pound of butter with half a pound of white sugar to a cream, reserving the other half pound of sugar to roll them with; beat to a froth the whites of three eggs, with a little grated nutmeg and rose water; then stir in with a knife as much flour as will thicken them to the consistency of smooth soft dough; then turn them out and roll in the reserved sugar. Either cut round with a wine-glass or roll them long, and unite the ends in about eight inches in circumference. Nice Iceing for Cakes. Whip the whites of three eggs; add half a pound of good crushed sugar sifted in; beat this until quite white and cream- like ; add a little orange-flower water, or a few drops of essence of lemon j then lay it thickly over the cakes with a knife when the cake is cold; harden it by returning the cake a few minutes near the oven or fire. Meringues. Beat the whites of ten eggs to a stiff froth; adding slowly ten table-spoonsful of sifted crushed sugar, but which must be very finely powdered; when well beaten and quite stiff, put it in the form of a large egg on paper ; then glaze with the glazing sugar, and lay the paper on a tin in a moderately warmed oven; when of a light brown take them out, and remove from beneath all that which is not cooked with a spoon; this must be done with care, placing them in the oven when cold to dry; then put any kind of delicate preserves in each, and flavour with anything fancied, and put two together; either quince, calves foot, apple^ or wine jelly is very nice in them.

109 Stews, &c. suet, three large spoonfuls of bread crumbs, a little finely pow- dered summer savory and thyme, a little cayenne, then lard the heart well with strips of corn pork, fat only, lay some slices of corn pork in the bottom of a stew-pan, stuff the opening of the heart well, sew it up and lay it in the stew- pan with twelve allspice and twelve pepper corns, pour on one pint and a half of cold water, cover it very closely, and let it simmer very slowly for two hours, then make a rich sauce; rub some flour and butter together, and on it pour from the stew-pan half a pint of the gravy, one large spoonful of mushroom catsup, and let this simmer ; pour some over the heart when dished, and send the remainder to the table in a sauce-boat. Serve hot. Eagout of Eabbits. Clean with great care, as they require attention in clean- ing, and washing through many waters. When perfectly clean, cut them up into nice pieces, lay them in a stew-pan with water to cover them entirely, sprinkle in a teaspoonful of salt, and a few blades of mace ; let this simmer for an hour and a half, and remove all the scum as it rises, as they must be kept white; then put on to boil six white onions in salt and water, and boil them until tender. When the rabbits are done pour off some of the broth, rub a large spoonful of butter with a spoonful of flour and stir it into the gravy; put this into a saucepan to simmer, then strain off the onions, put them into the broth gravy, add a cup of cream, and a little grated nutmeg. Dish the rabbits and garnish them with parsley, and pour over some of the gravy and all the onions. Send some of the gravy to the table in a sauce- boat. 10

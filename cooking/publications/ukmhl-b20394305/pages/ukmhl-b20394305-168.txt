162 Bread and Risen Cakes. and insert it in the thickest part of the cake or loaf, if it does not stick to the straw the baking is finished. In breaking eggs be careful that none of the yolk escapes with the white, as the least particle will prevent a stiff froth; always whip the white in a very clean large shallow dish; strike a sharp quick stroke the whole length of thÂ© dish; they will come sooner for being whipped in a cool place. Never stop when you commence until they are light, and whip them until you can turn the dish over without their slipping. For creaming butter and sugar a wooden spaddle or flat mush stick is the best^ two inches wide and two feet long, of cedar or hickory. A Light Cake. Take three pints of sifted flour, a pint and a half of milk, and a spoonful of lard; stir into the flour three teaspoonsful of cream tartar, dissolve one teaspoonful of soda in a cup of milk, and a ^little salt; mix this all well together, and beat very lightly with a wooden spoon; roll this out rather thin and cut into cakes, or bake in two small pans. Serve hot, and split open and butter. Steam Baked Bread, a La Vienna. It has been known for some time at Vienna, that if the hearth of an oven be cleansed with a moistened wisp of straw, bread baked therein immediately afterwards presents a much better appearance, the crust having a beautiful tint. It was thence inferred that this peculiarity must be attributed to the vapor, which being condensed on the roof of the oven, fell back on the bread. At Paris, in order to secure with certainty so desirable an appearance, the following arrangement is prac- tised : the hearth of the oven is laid so as to form an inclined plane, with a rise of about eleven inches in three feet, and the arched roof is built lower at the end nearest the door, as compared with the farthest extremity. When the oven is charged, the entrance is closed with a wet bundle of straw.

91 Stews, &o. Malina Pie. Take cold mutton or veal, chop it very finely; then to one pint of minced meat, stir in the yolks of four well beaten eggs, the juice of one lemon, and the rind thinly grated, two small onions very finely chopped, half of a grated nutmeg, two large spoonsful of mushroom catsup, a very little cayenne, and salt to the taste. Mix this well together, and cut up into very small pieces a half quarter of a pound of butter and stir through it, then line a dish with good paste, and put ^ this in to bake until it is a nice brown. Serve with a nice gravy made of the bones of the cold meats Calf's Liver Fried. Lay the liver in vinegar for twelve hours, it will render it firm; dip it in cold spring water and wipe it dry, cut it in even slices, sprinkle herbs, rubbed finely, over it, add pepper and salt, and dredge with flour; fry in rather thin slices of corn pork or bacon laid in the bottom of the frying-pan ; this is preferable to lard, or butter ; remove the liver when fried a nice brown, pour away a portion of of the fat, and pour in a cup full of water with a small lump of butter well rolled in flour, in which a spoonful of white wine vinegar or lemon juice has been stirred; boil it up, keeping it stirred all the while, and serve the liver up in it. The thin slices of hot fried bacon should be sent to the table with it. All served hot. Another. Cut the liver and heart across the grain, wash it well, pour boiling water on, and let it stand a few minutes, then drain and season it with salt and pepper, flour it and drop it in hot lard; when it is brown on both sides, dish it; dust a little flour in the pan, and pour in some water, let it boil a minute, stirring in a seasoning of parsley, thyme, or sweet marjoram ; pour the gravy over the liver. This is a good breakfast dish.

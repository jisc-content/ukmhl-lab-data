76 Soups, &o. Split Pea Soup. Take beef bones, or any cold meats, and two pounds of corned pork ; pour on them a gallon of hot water, and let them simmer three hours, removing all the scum. Boil one quart of split pease two hours, having been previously soaked, as they require much cooking ; strain oiS* the meat and mash the pease into the soup; season with black pepper, and let it simmer one hour ; fry two or three slices of bread a nice brown, cut into slices and put into the bottom of the tureen, and on them pour the soup. Eel Soup. Take two good sized onions, peel, wash and slice them, and put them into the soup pot; put a lump of butter in and brown them. Have ready cleaned and washed five or six good sized eels, cut them into pieces and pour on them three quarts of boiling water; remove ail the scum; when the pot begins to boil, tie in a bundle some thyme, summer savoury and parsley, and also add half a teaspoonful of allspice and the same of pepper corns and salt. Cover this tightly and let it boil slowly for two hours ; then strain it carefully. Have ready, in a stew-pan, some thickening—two spoonsful of but- ter melted in the pan and flour dredged in to a paste—on this pour the soup, and let it simmer ten minutes.

Soups, &c. 83 rind of a lemon thinly cut—added with the first infusion. This has an advantage over the onion, as it never leaves an unpleasant taste in the mouth, or affects the breath, and imparts to chops, steaks, hashes or sauces a fine flavour. Chili Vinegar, or Essence. Those who are fond of cayenne will find this far superior to the article sold as cayenne. Cut in half or pound fifty red English chilies, which can be purchased at the wholesale druggists ;—it is a peculiar fine flavour. On the chilies pour a pint of the best wine vinegar or good brandy ; put it into a bottle, cork tightly and let it stand fourteen days. A very little of this seasons delightfully, and is preferable to the deleterious substance sold as cayenne. Essence of Lemon Peel. Wipe six fresh lemons and cut the rind very thinly ; put it into a quart of good brandy. This, in three weeks, will have a very fine flavour. For sauces or cake. Essence of Gtinger. Take three ounces of fresh grated green ginger, and the rinds of two lemons, thinly cut; put them into a quart of the best brandy or proof spirit. Cork. Essence of Allspice. Take three ounces of allspice and put into a pint of good brandy. In two weeks it has all the flavour of the spice. For sauces, hashes or soups.

Ham is a necessary ac- companiment to roast and boiled poultry. Tongue. A tongue should be soaked twelve hours in cold water, if salted and dried ; if a green or fresh one from pickle, two hours soaking in cold water is sufiicient. Put it on to cook in plenty of cold water, and let it gradually warm ; give it four hours slow cooking. In selecting a tongue for cooking, ascertain how long it has been dried; pick the plumpest and smoothest, which is an evidence of its being young and tender. Never cut off the root of the tongue be- fore boiling. When boiled, let it stand as the ham for ten or fifteen minutes in the water ) then take it out and skin it. Garnish it with mashed white potatoes and parsley sprigs. Tripe. Select fresh, fat tripe ; it is usually prepared by the butcher —cleaned and laid for several days in salt and water.

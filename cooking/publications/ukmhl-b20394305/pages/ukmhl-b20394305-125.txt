119 Stews, &o. Omelette. The great merit of an omelette is, that it should not be greasy, burnt, or overdone j if too much of the white is used it becomes hard. To dress an omelette, the fire should not be too hot, as it is an object to have the whole substance heated without too much browning on the outside ; the ome- lette must not be too thin, therefore it must be thick and have a full, rich, moist flavour. They should be fried in a small pan, with a small quantity of good butter. Five or six eggs will make a good sized omelette. Break them into a basin, separating the whites from the yolks, mince very finely a tablespoonful of fresh parsley, beat up the yolks well, and to it add the parsley and a little salt, and a very little cay- enne, then whip the whites to a stiff froth; put about a large spoonful of butter into the hot pan, and while it is melting mix with the yolks two tablespoonsful of good cream, then . beat in the whites when well mixed, and pour it into the pan ; shake it in the pan until the eggs begin to set, then turn up the edges, and when a nice brown, it is done. Then have a hot dish and lay it on the pan and turn it upside down on the dish. Never make it until it is wanted at table, as it must be eaten as soon as made. They can be flavoured with finely chopped onions, or oysters, or cooked and chopped ham. The above is the basis of all omelettes, only omitting the cream if anything else is used. Omelet au Naturel. Break eight or ten eggs into a pan, add pepper, salt, and a spoonful of cold water, beat them up with a whisk to a stifl" froth j in the mean time put some fresh butter into a frying pan, when it is quite melted, and nearly boiling, put in the eggs. As it is frying, take up the edges, that they may be properly done ; when cooked double it. Serve very hot.

StewS; &c. 112 Chicken Salad. Take a pair of fowls and either boil or roast them; when they are entirely cold remove all the skin and fat, and disjoint them; cut the meat from the bones into very small pieces, not exceeding an inch ; wash and split two large heads of celery, and cut the white part into pieces also about an inch long, and having mixed the chicken and celery together, put them in a deep china dish; cover it and set it away. Just before the salad is to be eaten, the dressing should be put on, which is made thus : Take the yolks of eight hard boiled eggs, put them into a flp-t, dish and mash them to a paste with the back of a spoon; add to the egg a small teaspoonful of fine salt, the same quantity of cayenne pepper,, half a gill of made mustard, a wine glass and a half of French vinegar, and rather more than two wine glasses of sweet oil; then add the yoke of one raw egg well beaten, or a tablespoonful of cream; mix all these ingredients thoroughly, stirring them a long time, till they are quite smooth. After you pour it on the chicken and celery, mix the whole well together with a silver fork. EOGNON DE MOUTON A LA FrANCAISE.

70 Soups, &c. some rice boiled dry, and garnish the chicken, which can be taken out of the gumbo, and makes a nice dish. Serve all hot. Clam Soup. Wash fifty of the small sand clams very clean. Put them into an iron pot, set it in a hot place and cover it up. When they become heated, the clams open ; then take them from the shells. Put the clams aside in a pan, and pour the juice into a stew-pan ; let it simmer for five minutes, strain it and rub two tablespoonfuls of butter and one of flour smoothly together ; put the juice on to cook, and slowly add the flour and butter, stir it well together, add half a teaspoonful of salt, half of a nutmeg grated, and a pint of good cream; stir this well, let it simmer for ten minutes, chop up some parsley and throw in ; then pour in the clams. One boil-up finishes, as the clams, like oysters, require very little tjooking* If you use the large clams, they must be chopped. PlLLAFF AN ORIENTAL DiSII. Take a leg of mutton, cut off the meat into small slices, put them into a pan with a good sized lump of butter and fry them a light brown. With the remainder of the meat and bone make a rich soup, by pouring on three quarts of cold water and letting it simmer three hours, tightly covered. The meat must not be fried until the soup is nearly done. Put into the soup ten skinned, sliced tomatoes, three thinly sliced onions, fried a light brown, and a small piece of garden pepper—it is strong and requires but little—salt to the taste. About half an hour before the soup is done, add a large tea cup full of well washed rice, stirring it all constantly until cooked — then put in the slices of fried meat; let it simmer for five minutes. When properly prepared, the grains of rice are all whole but cooked. Cold roast beef is equally as good as mutton for a pillaff. Serve hot.

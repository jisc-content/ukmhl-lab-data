Cut two slices of stale bread half an inch in thickness; cut off the crust; toast them a nice brown ; butter both sides with good fresh butter while they are hot; cut them into squares of two inches in size; lay them in a bowl, sprinkle a little salt over them, and pour on a pint of boiling water; grate a little nutmeg. Cracker Panada. Grate four water crackers into a saucepan; to a spoonful of white sugar add a little salt, stone and cut in half two large spoonsful of bunch raisins; over this pour one pint of boiling water ; let it slowly simmer five minutes; pour it into a bowl, and it is ready for the invalid. Tapioca. Soak two table-spoonsful of very clean tapioca in two tea-cups of cold water over night; in the morning add a little salt; one pint of milk, or water if milk cannot be taken ; simmer it until quite soft; stir well while cooling; when done pour into a bowl, and if allowed add sugar, a spoonful of wine, and a little nutmeg. Arrow Root. Bermuda arrow root is the best, but it is, unless purchased from a reliable person, much adulterated; put in your saut3epan to boil one pint of milk; stir very smoothly into a cup of cold milk two spoonsful of arrow root, and a little salt; when the milk boils stir in the arrow root; continue to stir until it is cooked, which will be in five minutes; then remove it from the fire, and sweeten to the taste; if allowed, a little grated nutmeg; it is very nice cold and eaten with cream.

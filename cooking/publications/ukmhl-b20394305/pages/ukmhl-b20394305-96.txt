90 Stews, &c. Ham and Chicken Pie. Cut some thin slices of cold cooked ham, lay them in the bottom of a dish, and cut a cold boiled fowl up as for a fri- casse ; lay one half of the fowl on the ham, and season with a very little pepper and salt, and a little grated nutmeg. E,ub the hard boiled yolks of two eggs, a spoonful of flour, and a large spoonful of butter, and stir this into half a pint of any nice broth, then pour this over the chicken, then another layer of thin slices of ham, and then the remainder of the chicken; then pour on a little more broth, and cover the whole with a nice paste, and bake it slowly half an hour. Serve hot. Alamode Beef or Yeal. Take about ten pounds of the round, let it be fat and juicy. Make a stuffing of four tablespoonsful of fat corned pork chopped finely, and the same of bread crumbs ; cut an onion in slices into cold water, and drain off the water and chop it up, then mix these together, adding a little ginger and salt; make deep incisions in each side of the beef and introduce freely this stuffing, tie a string two or three times around the beef to keep it in shape, then dredge it well with flour and lay the meat into a stew-pan and pour over it two quarts of cold water, one teaspoonful of whole allspice, a little bundle of basil and parsley tied together ; let this only simmer for three hours,â€”skim it carefully whilst cooking. When quite tender take out the beef and make a nice gravy of about one pint and a half of the broth ; skim all the fat off of that in- tended for the gravy, then dredge in some flour, a wine glass of tomato catsup, and if made in summer put some thinly sliced tomatoes in the broth while the beef is stewing. Pour some of the gravy over the beef and some in a sauce-boat. The beef is better if laid for twelve hours in good wine vine- gar, before preparing it for cooking.

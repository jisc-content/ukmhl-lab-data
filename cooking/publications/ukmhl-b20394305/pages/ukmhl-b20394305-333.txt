323 Drinks and Food for the Sick. Panada. Put into a clean saucepan one pint of hot water; set it on the fire; add one wine-glassful of white wine; a spoonful of white sugar, the rind of a lemon very thinly pared, and a very little grated nutmeg; as soon as it comes to a boil stir in two large spoonsful of stale bread crumbs; stir this until well mixed, then take out the lemon peel, and pour the panada into a bowl. Syrup for a Cough. Take one pound of brown sugar; one pint of vinegar; boil together until it becomes a thick syrup; a short time before it is done, add half a pound of raisins seeded; one tea-spoonful is suffi- cient for a dose unless the cough is very troublesonie, then take two every two hours; this is most excellent. Toast Water. Cut a slice of stale bread half an inch thick a finger length long; cut off the crust, and toast it quite brown, but not scorched; while hot put it into a half pint pitcher; pour over half a pint of boiling water; cover it tightly, and when cool remove the bread. Scotch Toast. Lay in a pan three or four hard water crackers; the '^Trenton cracker'^ is the best for soaking; pour on them boiling water to cover them; sprinkle a little salt over until well softened ; then put on each a piece of good sweet butter, and set it in the oven for ten minutes, and if allowed a little cream poured on. Lemon Water. Cut the rind of a fresh lemon very thinly, and squeeze the juice of half the lemon; put it into a pitcher and pour on one pint of boiling water; cover it tightly until cold; then sweeten to the taste.

When the syrup becomes quite cold, to one half-pint of the syrup, add half a pint of the best alcohol (obtained from a reliable importer), for on the quality of the alcohol depends the keeping of the fruit; poui this thus proportioned over the fruit, quite covering it; then cork very tightly, being careful to lay a piece of muslin or linen between the cork and the fruit; then dip the jars into the pre- pared cement to exclude the air; thus prepared, fruit will keep for years.

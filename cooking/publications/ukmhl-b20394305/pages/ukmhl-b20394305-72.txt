When the gravy is almost dried up, fill up the pot with some water-—more than the soup re- quires, as much of it evaporates and in skimming some is lost. When it begins to boil, remove all the fat and scum, which should be put into the soap fat. Always keep a jar expressly for cold soups or scraps, which is useful for making what is termed " stock." A scrap jar is indispensable in a kitchen ; it must be kept very clean, and scalded with hot soap-suds once a week, and kept in a cool, dry place.

STEWS, MADE DISHES AND FRIES. These are very economical, and, if rightly prepared, ex- ceedingly palatable. Cold meats are rarely acceptable, with the exception of roast beef, ham, pork and poultry, but if re- heated, without being overdone, lose none of their flavour or nutrition. Mutton Stew. Cut the cold mutton into not very thin slices j trim off all the sinew, gristle and skin ; put into the stew nothing but that which is to be eaten ; lay the prepared pieces into a saucepan, and put the scraps into a jar, which should always be kept as a reservoir for scraps, to be converted into soups, broths or gravies. If you have no mutton or beef gravy, make some from these scraps, by putting them into a sauce- pan and pouring over them a pint of boiling water ; then add a bundle of sweet basil and celery heads tied together, a little salt, and a few whole pepper corns. Cover it up and stew it for half an hour, and then pour it over the prepared slices of mutton ; let the meat slowly warm in this gravy. Just before dishing, take out the meat, cover it and keep it warm; then dredge some flour into the gravy to thicken it j simmer it five minutes, and serve very hot. This is a nice dish. S

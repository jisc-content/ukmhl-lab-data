A good criterion of the ripeness of poultry for the spit is the ease with which the feathers can be plucked ; always leave a few on to pluck to as- certain this. A full grown fowl requires about an hour and a quarter for cooking; it is prepared and dressed exactly as a turkey, only not much, if any, stuffing in the belly of the fowl.

The goose is best in the autumn and early part of winterâ€”never good in spring. What is called a green goose is four months old. It is insipid after, although tender. Pick well and singe the goose; then clean carefully. Put the liver and gizzard on to cook as the turkey's. When the goose is washed and ready for stuffing, have boiled three white potatoes, skin and mash them* chop three onions very fine, throw them into cold water; stir into the potatoes a spoonful of butter, a little salt and black * pepper, a table- spoonful of finely rubbed sage leaves ; drain ofi" the onions,- and mix with the potato, sage, &c. When well mixed, stuff the goose with the mixture, have ready a coarse needle and thread, and sew up the slit made for cleaning and introducing the stuffing.

Apple sauce is indispensable for roast goose.

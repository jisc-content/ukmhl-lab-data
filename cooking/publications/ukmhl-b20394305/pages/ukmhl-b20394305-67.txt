61 Boiling. Calves' Feet. Clean and wash a set of feet (four); put them on in cold water and let tliem boil slowly two hours. Whilst boiling, throw in a teaspoonful of salt ] skim them carefully. Pish them, but remove the large bones. Sauce, the same as for calf's head ; they are very delicate and nice. The broth is good for jelly. Corned Pork Must be soaked for three or four hours before dressing; it must be well washed and scraped. When delicately dressed, it is a favorite dish. It must not be boiled fast; put on in cold water and gradually warm through; skim it fre- quently whilst boiling. A leg weighing s-even pounds requires three hours and a half slow simmering. When you dish the pork, skin it very carefully. Some prefer the skin remaining on, as it loses much of its juices by skinning;— and is very nice cold. Pork must be well cooked. Parsnips are usually eaten with corned pork, but nicely boiled homony and beans are very necessary with boiled pork. Boiled Bacon. If much salted, it must be scraped and soaked in warm water for two hours before dressing. A piece of three pounds will require two hours very slow boiling • remove all the scum as it rises. A nice way of dressing it is (after it is ooiled,) to take off the skin, and grate bread crumbs over it and set it in the oven to brown. I)o not let it remain longer than browned, as it will dry too much. 6

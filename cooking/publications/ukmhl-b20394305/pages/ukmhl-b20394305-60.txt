Roasting Meats. 64 out the pepper, and rub the rice and onion through a sieve into a clean saucepan. If too thick, add a little cream ; let it simmer once ; add a little salt, and serve hot with the bird. This is a delicate and nice sauce. Teal. It requires the same cooking as a duck, and dressed in the same manner. Onion sauce only must be served with teal, prepared as follows : Take six good sized white onions, peel them, cut them in half, lay them in cold water for half an hour, drain off that water and boil in fresh water a quarter of an hour. Take them out of the water and chop them very finely; cut up with them a stick of celery washed care- fully. Put them into a clean saucepan, with a large spoon- ful of butter, set on a slow fire, keep turning until the onion is browned, then dredge in a little flour. Pour over this any nice broth or stock, which a careful cook is never without. Stir it well, add a little salt and very little pepper ; let this simmer for ten minutes, then rub it through a seive, and add a wine glass full of claret wine. Serve this hot with the bird. Pigeons. Pigeons are better for being freshly cooked; their flavour passes off in a day or two. When cleaned and ready for roasting, prepare some stuffing of bread crumbs and about three oysters to each bird, a spoonful of butter, a little salt and nutmeg. Mix these well together, and fill the belly of the bird. They must be well basted with melted butter, and require thirty minutes careful cooking. When full grown, and in the autumn, they are best. For a sauce, take the gravy which runs from them, thicken with a very little flour and some chopped parsley. Serve hot. This bird is in per- fection when it has just done growing.

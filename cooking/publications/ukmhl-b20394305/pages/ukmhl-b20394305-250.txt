242 Puddings, FritterS; &o. CocoANUT Pudding. Cut with a pen-knife the rind off three cocoanuts; grate them fine, then add three-quarters of a pound of butter, three-fourtha of a pound of sugar to every pound of cocoanut; let the butter and sugar be well incorporated first; then to each pound add the whites of nine eggs beat to a froth; six crackers rolled fine, or the same amount of dry bread wet with a wine glass of rose- water', (a wine-glass of wine is good but not needful,) and all the milk of the nuts; a little variation of the above is to use five eggs, putting in both yolks and whites; the three nuts makes one and a half pounds, or twelve small puddings. Cocoanut Custard. One nut grated into one pint of milk and three eggs, sugar to taste, butter the size of a walnut; grate in the outside of a lemon, and add nutmeg. Custard Pudding. Beat together the yolks of five eggs; add one quart of milk; sweeten with white sugar to taste; flavor with French extract of vanilla and nutmeg; if baked in cups let there be cold wa- ter poured in a pan, and the cups placed in that for the oven, to prevent injuring the china; if in a basin, cut a little bread very thin, first spreading it with butter, and lay on the top. Dried Apple Puddings. > Stew one quart of dried apples well, sift them through a col- ander, and add one pound of butter beaten light with an equal weight of sugar; beat seven eggs light, and mix all together, flavor- ing to the taste; mace, nutmeg and rose-water make them excel- lent, or squeeze in the juice of four oranges or lemons; cream may be used in place of so much butter. These puddings are deli- cious, and may be made at mid-winter, when green apples cannot be obtained.

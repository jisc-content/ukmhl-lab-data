278 Preserving, &o. watery particles evaporate; when the pears are cold put them into the jarS; and when the syrup is quite cold pour it over the pears, and let the lemon peel remain in; cork tightly. Preserved Peaches. Select the free-stone yellow peach, not too ripe; pare and halve them; weigh them, take their weight in sugar; make a strong ginger tea by putting good ground race ginger in a bag, and boiling it in a pint of water, until the water becomes strongly flavoured; then pour off this water and strain it into the loaf sugar; that will be all the water required; when the syrup is melted lay in the peaches, let them slowly warm, and then simmer until they are quite clear; then take them out and lay in a dish and pour over them some good brandy; return the syrup to the fire and let it simmer fast for twenty minutes; when the peaches become cold drain them, and put them care- fully into glass jars, free from the syrup in the dish; when the syrup is quite cold pour it over the peaches; quite fill thj^ jar; cork tightly, and seal. Crab Apples. Select those free from defects; pour over them boiling water which removes the skin; then core them with a strong goose quill; weigh them, and take their weight in loaf sugar; lay the apples into a preserving kettle; cover them with water; let them slowly simmer until soft; then drain them well on a sieve, and then make a syrup, when it is dissolved and hot, lay in the apples and let them slowly simmer fifteen minutes; it is a great improvement to have nicely scraped green ginger boiled in the syrup, it imparts a fine -flavour to the syrup; when the apples look clear, lay them on dishes to cool, and when cold place in the jars; return the syrup to the fire after the apples are taken out, and let it simmer for ten or fifteen minutes; when cold pour it over the apples; cork tightly.

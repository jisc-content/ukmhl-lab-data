Bread and Cakes. 206 Patent Flour. Pulverise six pounds flour, mix five teaspoonsful of dry soda all through it, then six teaspoonsful cream of tartar, and six tea- spoonsful of salt.

Take half a pint of Indian meal, pour on it a pint of boiling milk, then add a pint more cold milk, beat three eggs a little, and put in salt sufficient to season it, then thicken it with wheat flour to a stifi" batter (stiffer than you do buckwheat cakes), add yeast sufficient to rise them ; when risen, bake them just as you do buckwheat cakes; butter them^ and send them hot to table. Saleratus Cake. Quarter of a pound of butter, one pound good sugar, four eggs, the rind and juice of one lemon, half a pint of sour milk, in which mix a teaspoonful of saleratus, when mixed with the milk pour it to the butter, sugar, &c.; add flour enough to make it as thick as pound cake; bake in small cups; eight or ten currants in each cup is a pretty addition.

One pint and a half of milk, three-quarters of a pound sugar, half a pound butter, and one nutmeg. Make a sponge of these over night. They are good as possible. Fry in hot lard.

22^ 257 PICKLING AND CATSUPS. Pickles have been properly termed the sponges of vinegar;" the Eastern mode of pounding them is the best; we do not ap- prove of their use; in no country are they indulged in to the same extent as in our own; and they are only vehicles for the introduction of vinegar and spices into the stomach, as the flavour of whatever is pickled is lost in the mixture of garlic, spice, &c., used. The best quality of wine or cider vinegar should be used, not the store compound sold under that name; vinegar must not be boiled, as the strength of both spices and vinegar is lost by evaporation. The pickles should be scalded in the brine until parboiled; this saves time and does away with the necessity for soaking six or eight days in brine; take them out of the brine and let them get cold, and cover them in unglazed earthen ware or glass with the prepared pickle here given. Bruise in a mortar half an ounce of black pepper corns, the same of alspice, the same of cloves, one large spoonful of grated horseradish, one tea- spoonful of mustard seed, one table-spoonful of chopped garlic, and one tea-spoonful of table salt; put these into an unglazed jar, on them pour three pints of the best wine or cider vinegar; close the jar tightly, so as to prevent all evaporation; set this by the side of a fire, to heat only^ for three days; shake it frequently during that time. Put the pickles prepared by parboiling in the sieve to drain perfectly dry; then to enable them to imbibe thoroughly the pickle, as they are put into a jar run a * Harding pin'' through them ; then lay them into jars, covering them with the above prepared spiced vinegar, which must be warm only, not hot; sprinkle in each jar before pouring on the vinegar a

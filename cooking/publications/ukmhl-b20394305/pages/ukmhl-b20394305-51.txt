Roasting Meats. 45 quarter of an hour before it is done, remove the paper and paste carefully ; then baste and dredge with flour. This is equal to venison. Serve with currant jelly. Pour over the mutton when dished a glass of good cooking wine, but no gravy—serve that in a sauce-boat. Veal. Yeal requires particular care to roast a nice brown. Let the fire be the same as for beef. Put it at some distance from the fire at first, to let it roast thoroughly, as it must be well done, but not driedj then draw it near to finish it brown —basting well. For sauce, remove the juices of the meat from the bottom of the roaster, and skim all the fat off, mix in a little flour, salt and pepper, then simmer and serve hot. Fillet of Yeal. A fillet of twelve or fourteen pounds will require nearly four hours' roasting before a good fire. Make some stuffing of a quarter of a pound of finely chopped beef suet, and as much bread crumbs, a large spoonful of finely chopped pars- ley, a little sweet marjoram, the rinds of two lemons grated, a tablespoonful of grated horse-radish, a little black pepper and salt; these all mixed together well with two hard-boiled, smoothly-rubbed yolks of eggs. Introduce this through the fillet, secure the stuffing with skewers and twine, baste it wellj and make a gravy of the dripping, skim off the fat and thicken with flour. Serve hot. Yeal Sweetbread. Take two fresh sweetbreads, par-boil them for five minutes, then lay them in cold water. This process is called blanch- ing. Beat up the yolks of two eggs, grate some bread crumbs. Yfhen the sweetbreads are quite cold, wipe them very dry, run a skewer through them, dip them in the egg

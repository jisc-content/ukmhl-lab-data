Roasting Meats. 55 Reed, and other Small Birds. Reed birds, and all other small birds, when picked and cleaned, must have a lump of butter the size of a hickory nut put into the belly; then roll them in the yolk of an eggâ€”- then in bread crumbs : tie them and truss them on the bird spit ; baste them well. While they are roasting, sprinkle bread crumbs over them. They require only fifteen minutes if they have a quick fire. Garnish them with sliced lemons. Wild Ducks, or Teal. You must be very particular in not roasting these birds too much; teal about twenty minutes, with a good fire; baste them very frequently; your fire and motion of the spit must be attended to, and when you dish it, unless preferred to be done by the gentleman at the table, draw your knife four times down the breast; have ready a little hot butter, and juice of a lemon, cayenne pepper, a little dust of sugar, a glass of port wine, pour it all hot, the last minute, over your teal; the re- mainder left of these birds the next day makes excellent hash, taking care of all the gravy that may remain, to stew it in. Wild Ducks. These birds require clean plucking and washing, which may be done by pouring warm water through the body after it has been drawn ; half an hour before a brisk fire will sufBce to roast them, and stuffing is not required. When it is sent to table, the breast should be sliced, and a lemon squeezed over it. The slices of the breast and the wings are the only parts really worth eating to a sensitive palate, the strong flavour of the bird rendering it a dish only for those with peculiar tastes. Currant jelly must be served with them.

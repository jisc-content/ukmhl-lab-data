Pastry. 215 Apple Pie. Fill a pudding dish with pared and cored applesâ€”the tart baking apple; fill each hole of the apple with good brown sugar; cut very thinly the oily part of the rind of two lemons; then cut it into narrow strips, and lay on the top of the apples; squeeze the juice of the lemons into a cup and add a little cold water; pour this over the apples, and sprinkle over more sugar, quite thickly; then cover the whole with a nice puff paste, and bake it rather slowly one hour; serve hot. Peaches are very nice done in the same way, with the stones left in and only pared, but no lemon, and very little water as they make their own juice. Baked Apple Dumplings. Prepare a paste as for boiled dumplings; only instead of one large one, make several small ones; avoid lapping the paste, as much as possible, after the fruit is introduced; butter the pan in which they are baked, to prevent their sticking; lay the folded side down; bake three-quarters of an hour; serve hot; eaten with cream. Baked Blackberry Dumplings. They are prepai*ed precisely as the apple; cranberries are also very nice, only the cranberries must be partially stewed and cooled before putting into the paste. Peaches are very nice, prepared as the apples. Potatoe Crust. Boil six good sized mealy white potatoes, pare and mash them through a colander; add a tea-cup of sweet cream, and a little salt; sift in just flour enough to make them stick and to roll out; work it as little as possible; if properly made this is an excellent paste; it must be rolled rather thicker than ordinary paste; it is excellent for pot pie, or any kind of boiled dumplings.

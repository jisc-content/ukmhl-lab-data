Vegetables. 149 four eggs well beaten, pepper and salt, as much as sufficient; stir all well together, and bake four hours in a buttered dish. Some add to the other ingredients a quarter of a pound of sugar, and eat the pudding with sauce. It is good, cold or warm, with meat or sauce, but epicures of the most exquisite taste declare for it hot, and with the first service. Spinach a la Francaise. Cut and wash, place it in a saucepan with a little salt and boiling water; when tender strain off the liquor, and throw the spinach into clear cold spring water, take small portions of it, and having pressed the water from it, chop it finely. Lay in a stew-pan a piece of butter, add the spinach to it, keeping it stirred until the butter is absorbed by the vegetable, dredge in a spoonful of flour, until it is commingled with the spinach, add three large spoonsful of rich veal gravy, let it boil quickly, keep it stirred ; it may be served up plainly or with sliced hard boiled egg round it. The dish is sometimes dressed by pouring boiling cream sweetened with white sugar to the spinach instead of the veal gravy. Spinach Ragout. Having well picked and cleaned the spinach, put it into plenty of boiling water, throw in a small handful of salt; as soon as it readily separates it is done enough ; strain off the liquor; put it into fresh water for ten minutes; strain ofi" the water completely, chop the spinach, lay it in a stew-pan with a piece of fresh butter, keep it stirred; when the butter has been absorbed, as much well seasoned gravy soup as will make the consistence of cream may be added, with a little grated nutmeg. Serve hot. 13*

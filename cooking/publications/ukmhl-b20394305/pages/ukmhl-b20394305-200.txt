194 Bread and Cakes. Almonds. Almonds should be kept blanched and dried ready for use. The peach kernels should be saved in peach season and dried. They are, when mixed with almonds, nice for cake. In pounding them always use rose water, or orange flower water, to prevent the oiling of the almonds. Sugar must be used in pounding, if no flavouring is wanted. Buns. Sift four pounds of flour, add to it one pound of good brown sugar; make a cavity in the centre of the pan, and stir in slowly one gill of good yeast with one pint of lukewarm new milk, using just flour enough to make the yeast and milk into a paste the consistency of rich cream. Cover this over, and let it stand two hours; then cut up one pound of good butter into one pijit of warm milk, with a little salt; then mix all the ingredients together, dust the top with flour, and let them stand one hour; then make them into buns about the size of a large egg; butter the pans, and lay them in rows three inches apart; bake them in a hot oven, a nice brown color; when done, as soon as they are drawn from the oven, wipe them on the top with a soft brush dipped in milk. Crullers. To six heaping spoonsful of sugar, add six spoonsful of warmed not melted butter, and six well beaten eggs; beat these well to- gether J grate half a nutmeg, add a very little pounded mace, and the grated rind of two lemons ; beat them well together, and sift in as much flour as will make a soft dough; have ready some boil- ing lard, and cut the dough into any shape; fry them brown, and dry them in a hot colander free from fat. Serve hot. Sift over them pulverized white sugar.

275 PRESERVING, &o. An iron kettle lined with porcelain is the best for preserving; the most important thing after the fruit is properly selected and prepared, is to make a rich, clear syrup; this must be well clari- fied, if brown sugar is used. Preserves require very careful and slow cooking, as the least scorch spoils the flavour; and in fast boiling, the sugar does not penetrate so well as in moderate cooking ; too much cooking darkens the fruit, and renders some kind of fruits very hard; a preserving spoon with a drainer is indispensable for preserving, and is easily obtained at a small ex- pense ; an apple corer is another important article; a gimlet with a long screw of about half an inch in circumference, and two or three inches long, is a great convenience in preparing many kinds of fruits for preserving, as it removes the cores at the blossom end of the fruit, without removing the stem; a nice sound cork stuck full of large sized needles, is very useful for pricking the fruit, which has the tender skin on. Grlass jars are preferable for preserves, as they can be examined from time to time, and the moment a tendency to fermentation is shown the fruit can be attended to; this must be done by first removing all the scum which has risen on the top, and then set the jars into a pot of lukewarm water; if hot, it will break the jars ; let the water gradually heat; let the jars remain in the hot water one hour, then remove the pot and let the jars cool in the water; then put on a fresh piece of cotton or linen, and cork tightly. They must be kept in a cool, dry place, as dampness acts in- juriously on preserves. If the preserves are in stone jars, they can be set in a moderately heated oven, and kept in for two

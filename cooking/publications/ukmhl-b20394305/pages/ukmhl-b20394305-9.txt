PUBLISHER'S ADYERTISEMENT. The publisher, in presenting these receipts to the public, feels an assurance of their being well received, from a knowledge of the source from whence they come. The lady was a pupil of the justly celebrated Mrs. GooDFELLow, who was for many years in this city, pre-eminent in vhe art of cooking. Besides this advantage of being a practical cook, she has obtained some of the best receipts from experienced house- keepers of the south, who understand well the art of compounding good things. Many of the receipts are from Europe, presented to her by travelling friends, and experimented on by the authoress, and adapted to American palates. All these considerations are calculated to make it, not only an acceptable, but a valuable household assistant, in arranging that most important branchâ€”the culinary department. As such, the publisher has great pleasure in offering it to his countrywomen, with the belief that, if they will only follow the rules herein set forth, they will be enabled to become as good housekeepers as the authoress.

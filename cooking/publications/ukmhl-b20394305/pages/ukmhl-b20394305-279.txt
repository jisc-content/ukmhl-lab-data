(271) BRANDIED FRUITS. This requires care and experience, first, in the selection of the fruits, then in the preparation. The fruit must be just matured, free from defects, and wiped with care 3 and if having any down, that must be removed by immersing in saleratus water, but not allowed to remain in the ley sufficiently long to injure the flavour of the fruits, or become soft, after which each one must be well pierced to the very stone with a sharp needle to prevent the fruit shrivelling; after simmering in the ley only five minutes, they must be put into a pan of clear, cold water, then laid into a large vessel of boiling water, ample room given for each one to be well heated and acted on by the boiling water ; the heat of the fire then reduced to let them gradually cool in the water; let them remain for two hours quietly in this water, then place the vessel again on the fire, and only come to a boil; then take the fruit out with great care separately, and lay them in cold water. This second boiling is done to restore the colour, and for thin skinned fruits a small piece of alum must be added, while this second boiling is going on. In this second boiling the water ipust boil quickly, if that is not attended to the flavour of the fruit is lost, and be careful in putting the fruit into cold water; the fruit must then be laid on a hair sieve to drain perfectly dry 3 t^en make a rich syrup of white, broken loaf sugar, the drained fruit dropped into this syrup whilst it is boiling; let the fruit remain in until it becomes soft to the touch, which is easily ascertained by removing one from the syrup. When all are doi^e in the syrup, beat up the whites of two fresh eggs in a little o water, and stir this into the syi^up

14^ (161) BREAD AND RISEN CAKES- Directions for Making Cake. Flour used for making cake must always be dried and sifted ^ always break the eggs used for cake separately in a saucer; it is a good plan to lay the eggs to be used for a few hours in very cold water before breaking; they whip into a much better froth for being cold, and in hot weather they are better for being in the ice over night; always beat separately the whites and yolks. When soda is used always dissolve it before adding it to the general mixture, and be careful not to use the hands in mixing, but a knife or wooden spoon which is kept for that purpose alone is the best. In winter soften, but do not melt the butter in the milk used. Cake not raised with yeast should be baked as soon as made. Never use strong butter for cakes or cooking. When the butter is washed, which is neces- sary in even good firkin butter, drain it well or the cake will be heavy. Fresh eggs are necessary for nice white cakes; those kept in lime or in other ways, will answer for ordinary cakes, or for those which are raised. Never add the fruits un- til ready for baking, and for raised cakes spread them on the top, and only stirred a little below the surface, or they will set- tle at the bottom. Currants require much and careful clean- ing before using; wash them first in warm water, rubbing them well between the hands, the water drained ofi", and then spread on a cloth and rubbed dry, pick them over, dry and lay them then aside for use. In baking cake which requires long baking, take white pa- per and lay on the sides and bottom and top; it is easily re- moved when the cake is done. Experience and attention alone will teach when cake is sufficiently baked; to ascertain when a loaf or dry soft cake is done take a clean stiff straw, double it

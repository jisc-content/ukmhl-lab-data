Bread and Eisen Cakes. 165 batter, stirring it fast; let it boil a few minutes, then add sifted meal by the handful, till it is quite thick, and a spoon- ful of salt. Keep it boiling slowly, and stir it frequently, the more it is stirred, and the longer it is boiled, the better the mush. To be wholesome, it must be boiled at least two hours. This is a good receipt. Fried Mush. Mush to be fried, should be boiled an hour longer to evapo- rate the water, and have half a pint of wheat flour stirred into it about half an hour before it is done. Take it out of the pot, and put it in an earthen dish and let it stand until per- fectly cold, then cut it in slices half an inch thick, and fry them brown. Crumpets. Take one quart of dough from the bread, at an early hour in the morning ] break three eggs, separating the yolks from the white, both must be whipped to a light froth, mix them into the dough, and gradually add milk-warm water, until it becomes to a batter the consistency of buckwheat cakes ; beat all well together, and set it to rise until breakfast time j have the griddle clean and hot, and nicely greased, pour on the batter in small round cakes, and bake a light brown. Serve hot. SouELE Biscuits.

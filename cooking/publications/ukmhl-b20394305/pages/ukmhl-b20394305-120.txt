Stews, &c. 114 be left as useless, cut up three or four fowls, a bunch of cooking herbs, twelve onions, three or four pounds of lean ham, and a bottle of Madeira, simmer it down for one hour, then fill it up with the liquor previously strained from the bones and shells, keep it all boiling gently for several hours, then strain it off, taking care of what lean meat you require for your tureens, put it in your soup pot to keep hot, with a little of the stock, and one pint of mushroom catsup. Have the entrails cleaned and scalded, then cut them into pieces two inches long, and put them on to blanch in cold water, wash them out, line a stew-pan with fat bacon, let them stew very gently for about three hours, then thicken the stock as for mock turtle, and rub it through a sieve, add egg balls, or hard boiled eggs, cut in half, and force-meat balls, the green fat to be boiled by itself in good strong broth, a little to be added to each tureen of soup. If to be sent up in the shell, put a pretty rim of raised pie paste round the top shell ] add the juice of lemons and a little more wine before you serve it up. Season with sugar, cayenne pepper, and salt. This is on a large scale, but may be reduced, observing the pro- portions, or the whole prepared and kept in a cool place for use. Force-meat Stuffings. Force-meat meat should be made to cut with a knife, but not dry or heavy ; no one flavour should predominate. For veal stuffing, chop some suet fine, a little parsley, a small piece of shalot, rub through a dry sieve a small quantity of basil, some sweet marjoram and thyme, then add these to your suet, a grated lemon, a few grates of nutmeg, a few bread crumbs, and one or two eggs, mix all well up together, and season with pepper and salt. If for game, scrape the raw livers into the stuffing, prepared as above, only in addition pound it all fine.

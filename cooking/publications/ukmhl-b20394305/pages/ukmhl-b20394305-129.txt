123 Stews, &c. are cooked, beat up an egg, and have ready some bread crumbs, then dry the cutlets in a cloth, have ready the frying pan with boiling lard, grate some nutmeg over each cutlet, a little salt and cayenne, then dip it into the egg, and strew them with bread crumbs, and lay them in the boiling fat, and let them cook slowly for ten minutes, first on one side and then on the other to a nice brown. They must be well cooked, and when quite done, lay them in a hot dish, and make the gravy; dredge into the pan where they were cooked, some flour, stir it well, pour in some hot water and a little chopped parsley, and pour this over them when dished for the table. Beef Steak Broiled. The fire must be bright and clear ; good coals are requisite for broiling. The gridiron should be clean and made with fluted bars, which form channels to the gutter, and prevent scorching. The gridiron should always be previously heated and rubbed with suet, before placing the steak on to prevent it from marking or adhering to the bars ; a constant watch must be kept over it while broiling, and frequent turning; no seasoning should be put on until it is cooked, then have ready a hot dish with butter, salt, and a little pepper, into this lay the steak and serve very hot. Mutton chops are pre- pared in the same way. To Make Sausages. Take eleven pounds of the fillet of nice fresh pork, and ten pounds of chine fat, chop them very finely, and add five ounces of salt, two and a half of black pepper, one and a half ounce of sage, half an ounce of savory, and little thyme ; work this well together. If closely covered, it will keep some weeks in a cool place.

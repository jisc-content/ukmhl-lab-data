Miscellaneous Receipts. 339 How TO Treat your Boots and Shoes when Partially Burned. On one of the coldest days of the present month, I pulled off my boots and set them close to a stove which was very hot. The room was filled with a smell as of something burning. Turning round, I saw my boots smoking at a great rate. I seized them and immediately besmeared them with soft soap, much of which, owing to their highly heated condition, quickly disappeared in the leather. When they became cold, the leather was soft and pliable; and now, after several days of subsequent wear, they exhibit no marks of having been burned. A Hint for Housekeepers. A few drops of carbonate of ammonia, in a small quantity of warm rain-water, will prove a safe and easy anti-acid, &c., and will change, if carefully applied, discolored spots upon carpets, and indeed all spots, whether produced by acids or alkalies. If one has the misfortune to have a carpet injured by whitewash, this will immediately restore it. To Grease Eggs eor Winter. In the spring when eggs are plenty and cheap, it is very well to put up several hundred, to use in the winter, when it is very difficult to get them, even in the country. Grease each egg with melted lard, and as you do so, lay them in a keg or jar, or old tin vessels that are out of use; put them in a dry closet, and keep them covered over; if they are put in the cellar, they are liable to mould, which spoils them entirely. Do not put in any cracked ones, or they will injure the rest. In this way they have been known to keep a year, and were nearly as good for puddings, or batter cakes, as fresh eggs. They do not do to boil, or make pound or sponge cake, as they lose part of their lightening property.

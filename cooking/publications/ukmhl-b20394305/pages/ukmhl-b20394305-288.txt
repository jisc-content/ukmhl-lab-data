280 Preserving, &o. Quinces. They may be prepared if of a small size whole, or in quarters if large; pair and core them, and lay them as they are pared into cold water to prevent their becoming dark; when all are pared and cored, put the cores and parings into a preserving kettle and cover them with cold water; let them simmer four hours, keep- ing the quinces in the cold water during the time; then strain off the juice from the parings and cores, and into it put the quinces to cook; let the quinces simmer in it until they are perfectly tender, then remove them carefully and lay in a sieve to drain, and make the syrup as directed; when the syrup boils lay in the quinces, and let them cook slowly fifteen minutes and no more, or they will become hard and dark ; then take them out of the syrup and lay them on dishes to cool; return the syrup to the fire and evaporate all the watery particles by a smart boil for ten minutes; when the quinces are quite cool put them into small sized glass jars, as when large jars are used the frequent openings to take out preserves injure the fruit; when the syrup is quite cold pour it on the quinces and fill the jars well up; cover with a cloth and cork up tightly; keep them in a cool dry place; then take the juice in which the fruit was cooked and to every pint of juice add one pound of the best brown sugar; let it simmer slowly for thirty minutes and it will become a nice jelly, and is delightful with blanc-mange. Damsons. Select full-grown ripe but not soft damsons, free from defects; stick each one well; then make a syrup as directed, and put in your fruit; let them only simmer very slowly for one hour; then take them out and lay them on dishes to cool, whilst they are on the dishes pour over them good brandy; this tends to keep them from fermenting; return the syrup to the fire and let it simmer ten minutes ; when the fruit is perfectly cold take them carefully from the dishes and place them in small sized jars; when the syrup is quite cold pour it over the fruit, cork tightly, and keep them in a cool dry place.

When quite tender, take out and mix with the liquor a large spoonful of flour, then stir it into the Btew-pan, simmer it for five minutes and strain off the gravy, then pour it back into the stew-pan and skim off every par- ticle of fat, and add a wine glass full of walnut catsup, then lay the leg of mutton in until dished. Pour over some of the gravy when dished, and the rest in a sauce boat. This is a delightful dish, and is called " le gigot de sept heiires^'^ so fa- mous in the French kitchen. Some of the loin is left on for a gigot en veritc,^^ Currant jelly to be served with it. Stewed Eump Steaks. The steaks must be thicker than for broiling, but all the same thickness. Put two tablespoonsful of butter with two sliced onions into a stew-pan, and when the butter is melted lay m the steaks and let them stand over a slow fire for five minutes, tightly covered; then turn the steaks and fry the other side ; have ready boiled a dozen small sized onions, pour the water in which they were boiled over the steaks, and if it does not cover them pour more over them, and put in a dozen pepper corns and a little salt. Let this simmer for two hours very slowly, then pour off about half a pint of the gravy, then skim off all the fat and mix in a spoonful of flour with a cup of the gravy, then add it to the whole with a wine glass of tomato or mushroom catsup, a little pepper and salt, and let it sim- mer for five minutes ; (a wine glass of Claret is a great im- provement,) and lay the steaks in until they are dished. Serve hot. 8^

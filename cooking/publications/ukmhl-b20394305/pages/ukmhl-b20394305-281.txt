Brandied Fruits. 273 been well mixed; cork the jars tightly, and seal them; keep them in a dry and cool place. Brandied Cherries. Select large ripe red cherries, let the stems remain on; make a small hole with a large needle at the end opposite the stem; put them into cold water, then drain them, and put them into clean jars; pour over them a rich syrup of boiling sugar; leave them one day in this; drain off this entirely, and boil it again, and add to it a proportion of one pint of syrup to a quart of the best white brandy; then pour this over the fruit, on the top of each jar put a thin muslin bag containing quarter of an ounce of cloves, half an ounce of coriander seed, half an ounce of anise seed; this imparts to the syrup a pleasant aromatic flavour; cork up tightly and expose them to the sun at least a month; then remove the spice bags, cork again tightly, and shake the jar so as to impart to all the syrup the aromatic flavour. In taking out the cherries for use, be careful to cork the mouth of the jars tightly to exclude the air.

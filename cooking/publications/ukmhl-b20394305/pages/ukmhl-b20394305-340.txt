To Render Hard Water Soft. For every hundred gallons take half a pound of the best quick lime, make it into a cream by the addition of water, then diffuse it through the hard water in a tank or reservoir, and allow the whole to stand; it will quickly be bright, the lime having united with the carbonate of lime, which makes the hard water, will be all deposited.

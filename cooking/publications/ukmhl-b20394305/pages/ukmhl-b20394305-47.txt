ROASTING MEATS. The operation of roasting is intended to loosen the fibres^ and prepare it for digestion in the stomach. In roasting, meat will bear a greater and longer heat than in either boiling or stewing. Eoasting is considered by very many, if rightly done, more digestive than boiling or stewing; for although roasting is one of the commonest and most sim- ple processes, yet it requires more attention than to make most made dishes—" to have it done to a turn." The cook must have her roaster clean and bright; a clear, brisk fire. It is impossible to give a specific rule as for time, but slow roasting is important. The season of the year— the length of time which the meat has been kept—all has an influence. As a general rule, a quarter of an hour to the pound is the best. The young and tender should be roasted; the strong and full grown animal boiled or stewed. Basting is a most important operation in roasting, as the more meat is basted, the sooner and better it is roasted. Never pour gravy over either roasted or boiled joints, as many prefer the juices of the meat to gravy which is made. A well selected roasting piece of beef—the noble sirloin of about fifteen pounds—will require about three hours and a half. The beef should be kept for several days after it is killed, if the weather will allow ; in winter a week. Have ready the spit and roaster before putting it down.

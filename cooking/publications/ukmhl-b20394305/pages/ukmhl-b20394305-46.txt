Pigeons, when fresh, have supple feet, and the vent will be firm 5 if discoloured and supple they are stale. Plovers, when fat, have hard vents ; but, like almost all other birds, may be chosen by the above rules. Hares.—When a hare is young and fresh, the cleft in the lip is narrow, the body stiff, the ears tear easily, and the claws are smooth and sharp ; and old and stale hares will be the opposite of this. Eabbits the same. Partridges.—Yellow legs and a dark bill are signs by which a young bird may be known, and a rigid vent when fresh. When this part is green the bird is stale. Pheasants may be chosen as above ; the young birds are known by the short or round spur, which in the old is long and pointed. TABLE CUTLERY. The same rule applies to Table Cutlery as to all other cut- ting instruments, viz., that they must be frequently sharp- ened. A servant who understands knife-cleaning, will, be- fore taking them off the board, draw them briskly a few times from back to edge (raising the back a little) first on one side, then on the other, and thus produce an excellent edge ; whereas a clumsy inexperienced hand will (by not holding them flat on the board) contrive to give the best steel a dull edge. Hence the necessity of an - efficient steel, in using which, care should be taken to raise the back of the knife a quarter of an inch from the steel. Servants are apt, in cleaning knives, to allow the arm to take its natural ball and socket, or half-circular movement, this of course, must completely round and thicJcen the edge and wear the bade. Strict injunctions should be given to keep the knife always jiat on the board. The best knives when new, will not cut, unless the above directions are strictly enforced.

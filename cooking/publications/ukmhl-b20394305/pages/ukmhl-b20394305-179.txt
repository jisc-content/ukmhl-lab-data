Bread and Risen Cakes. 173 er, one tumbler of rich milk or cream, and a teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in as much luke-warm water as will cover it, and mix them all well together in a pan. Beat three eggs till very light, and add them to the mixture. Throw in a teaspoonful of powdered cinnamon or nutmeg, and beat the whole very hard about ten minutes, butter a deep pan, put in the mixture, and bake it in a moderate oven. Yeast. Boil a large handful of hops in two quarts of water, strain it off; while hot, pour it on a sufficient quantity of rye meal to make it a stiff batter; put in a handful of salt, and beat it well, or smooth, let it stand till cool, then put in some yeast, (not brewhouse yeast) and let it stand in an open vessel until it is sufficiently fomented. This is the ordinary way to make jug yeast. Then stir, and knead in a sufficient quantity of Indian meal to make it a stiff dough, then roll it out thin, and cut it into the size of doughnuts, dry them on tables in the garret, but not where the sun will shine on them, turn them once, they will dry in about a week, put them away in a bag out of the reach of mice, and in a dry place. One of these cakes dissolved in a little water, (perhaps it will take two hours to dissolve it) is sufficient to lay a sponge for seven pounds of flour. Cake without Eggs. Pour sufficient boiling milk over stale bread to soften it, mash it through a cullender, add as much wheat flour and as much more milk as to make it the consistency of buckwheat batter, add an yeast powder and bake immediately. Delicious Bread Cake. Two tea cups of risen dough, half tea cup of sugar, half cup butter, two eggs, and raisins, mix these and add a mite of soda and cream of tartar; mix the cream of tartar with the dough, and dissolve the soda in a little milk and add lastly.

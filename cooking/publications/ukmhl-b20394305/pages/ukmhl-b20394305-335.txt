Drinks and Food for the Sick. 325 spoonful of salt; cover it closely and let it slowly simmer three hours; then take it from the fire; mash it well with a spoon, and put it into small moulds to cool; it will keep in a cool place for two or three days; eat with cream. Mulled Wine. Put cinnamon or alspice (to the taste) into a cup of hot water to steep, add three eggs well beaten with sugar; heat to a boil a pint of wine, then put in the spice and eggs while boiling, and stir them until done, which will be in three minutes. A Hint to Oyster Eaters. When too many oysters have been incautiously eaten, and are felt lying cold and heavy on the stomach, we have an infallible remedy in hot milk, of which half a pint may be drank, and it will quickly dissolve the oysters into a bland, cream jelly. Weak and consumptive persons should always take this after their meals of oysters. Syrup oe Vinegar. Take eleven ounces of French vinegar, obtained at the drug- gists, and fourteen ounces best loaf sugar; cover the vessel tightly and let them simmer slowly fifteen minutes, stirring oc- casionally ; when the sugar is entirely dissolved, pour it into a bottle for use, and cork tightly; this is very refreshing in ice water in fevers, and can be added to barley water. A Vegetable Soup. Take an onion, a turnip, two pared potatoes, a carrot, a head of celery; boil them in three pints of water till the vegetables are cooked; add a little salt; have a slice of bread toasted and buttered, put it into a bowl, and pour the soup over it. Toma- toes when in season form an agreeable addition. 28

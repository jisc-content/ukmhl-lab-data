It is best in spicing pickles, particularly fruits, to make several little thin muslin bags, and after the spices are mixed to sew them into the bags, and lay a bag on each jar before corking up; turn the jars occasionally upside down to allow the flavour to pass through. Sweet Pickled Peaches. Select firm morris whites;'^ rub off the down with a coarse towel; stick the peaches well with a sticking cork; weigh them, and allow to one pound of fruit one pound of good brown sugar and one pint of best vinegar, half an ounce of cloves, one quarter of an ounce of mace 3 dissolve the sugar in the vinegar; put all cold into a stone jar, and set it in a vessel of boiling water; let it remain in the water on the fire until the peaches are soft; then cork up closely and keep in a dry place. Peach Mangoes. Select large ripe open yellow peaches, but not too ripe 3 lay them in a strong brine for eight hours; take them out and drain them ; remove the stones carefully; close the peach by tying it together and laying four hours more in the brine; then prepare a stuffing of two ounces of celery seeds, two of coriander seeds^ two ounces of white mustard seed, two ounces of tumeric, two dozen very small onions chopped small, and one table-spoonful of horse-radish; bruise the coriander seed and the mustard seed in a mortar; then stuff the peaches and tie them ; lay them in glass jars, and prepare a spiced vinegar, and when cold pour over the peaches; lay on the top of each jar before closing a small bag of tumeric; cork very closely; for a day or two turn the jars occasionally upside down; this stuffing will do a peck of peaches; they are very fine.

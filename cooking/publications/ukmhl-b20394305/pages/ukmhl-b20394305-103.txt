As many cutlets as are required may be prepared in this manner; lay each one on a cloth near the fire to keep hot and free from fat, then fry some large oysters and garnish the cutlets. Lay the cutlets on a trivet in the saucepan, pour in the bottom of the sauce- pan one pint of the juice of the oysters, a glass of wine, half a nutmeg grated, chopped parsley, and a little salt and cay- enne ; set this in a hot place to simmer, cover it very tightly and cook for twenty minutes.

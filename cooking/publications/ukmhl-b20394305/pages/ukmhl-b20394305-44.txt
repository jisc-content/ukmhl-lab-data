88 To Choose Meats. TO CHOOSE MEATS. Venison.—The choice of venison should be regulated by the appearance of the fat, which, when the venison is young, looks bright, thick, clear, and close. It first changes towards the haunches. To ascertain whether it is sweet, run a knife into that part; if tainted it will have a rank smell. It should not be cooked if too high. Beej^.—True, well-fed, beef may be known by the texture and colour) the lean will exhibit an open grain of deep coral-red, and the fat will appear of a healthy, oily smooth- ness, rather inclining to white than yellow. The suet firm and white. Yellow fat is a test of meat of an inferior qual- ity. Heifer beef is but little inferior to ox beef; the lean is of a closer grain, the red paler, and the fat whiter. Cow beef may be detected by the same signs, save that the older the beast the texture of the meat will appear closer, and the flesh coarser to the sight, as well as harder to the touch. Yeal.—When you observe the kidney well surrounded with fat, you may be sure the meat is of a good quality. The whitest is not the best veal; but the flesh of the bull-calf is a brighter colour than that of the cow-calf. The fillet of the latter is generally preferred, on account of the udder. There is a vein in the shoulder very perceptible ; and its colour indicates the freshness of the meat; if a bright red or blue, it is recently killed ; if any green or yellow spots are visible, it is stale. The suet will be flabby, and the kid- ney will smell. Mutton.—The best is of a fine grain, a bright colour, the fat firm and white. It is better for being full-grown. The meat of the ewe is not so bright, while the grain is closer. The ram mutton may be known by the redness of the flesh.

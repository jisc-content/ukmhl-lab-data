Vegetables. 142 Asparagusâ€”Italian Fashion. Take some asparagus, break them in pieces, then boil them soft and drain the water off, take a little oil, water and vine- gar, let it boil; season it with pepper and salt, throw in the asparagus, and thicken with the white of two eggs beaten to a froth. Endive, done this way, is good j green peas, done as above, are very good, only add a lettuce cut small and two or three onions, and leave out the eggs. Cabbage. The green savoy is best for boiling. Before cooking cut the head in half and pour boiling water on it to prevent the disagreeable odour which arises from cooking. Cabbage is best boiled with the broth from salt meat, and is a nice accom- paniment to corned beef It requires an hour slow simmer- ing, and must be skimmed constantly while cooking. If not cooked with salt meat broth, put some salt in the water. Cauliflower. Select those that are close and white and of the middle size \ trim off the outside leaves, cut the stalk off flat at the bottom, let them lie in the salt and water an hour before you boil them. Put them into boiling water with a handful of salt in it; skim it well, and let it boil slowly until done, which a small one will be in fifteen or twenty minutes, take it out the moment it is done, as more boiling will spoil it, and pour over it some nice drawn butter. Serve hot. Broccoli is prepared in the same way.

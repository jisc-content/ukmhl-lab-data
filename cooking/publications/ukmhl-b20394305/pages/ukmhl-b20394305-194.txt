Bread and Cakes. 188 Sponge Cake. This requires very fresh eggs; to the yolks of twelve eggs, beaten very lightly with a broad bladed knife, add one pound of sugar; grato in one large sized fresh lemon, (only the oily part of the rind, avoid the bitter white skin,) and stir this well. Whip the whites to a froth ; stir in half a pounds f sifted flour; add the whites last. Bake one hour. Sponge cake is much lighter if the eggs are beaten separately, and the flour and sugar sifted together, and the eggs added lastly; it is liable to be sticky in inexperienced hands if the yolks and sugar are mixed together. Sponge Cake. Take sixteen eggs; separate the whites from the yolks; beat them very lightly ; sift into the yolks one pound of flour, adding a few drops of essence of almond, or lemon, to flavour with ; then add one pound and a quarter of pulverized loaf sugar; beat this well with a knife; then add the whites whipped to a stiff froth. Have ready the pans, and bake. Almond Cake. Take ten eggs, beaten separately, the yolks from the whites; beat the yolks with half a pound of white sugar; blanch a quarter of a pound of almonds by pouring hot water on them, and remove the skins; pound them in a mortar smooth; add three drops of oil of bitter almonds; and rose water to prevent the oiling of the almonds. Stir this also into the eggs. Half a pound of sifted flour stirred very slowly into the eggs; lastly stir in the whites, which must have been whipped to a stiff froth. Pour this into the pans, and bake immediately three-quarters of an hour.

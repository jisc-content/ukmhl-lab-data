PUDDINGS; Fritters, &c. 232 ElCE PuDDING; OR ^' ElZ AU LaIT/' This pudding if properly prepared is better without eggs; wash a Coffee-cupful of rice well; put it into one quart of new milk over night to soak; in the morning add a large spoonful of butter, a little salt, grated nutmeg, and a little ground cin- namon, then one pint more of new milk; then put it into the oven; and when it has begun to warm stir the pudding without removing from the oven ; stone a quarter of a pound of the best raisins, and add at this time; then let it cook until the rice is perfectly done. Baked Flour Pudding. Beat very light six eggs, separating the whites from the yolks; sift into a pan seven large spoonsful of wheat flour; on this pour some milk, just enough to make a smooth batter; then stir in the yolks of the eggs, and a very little salt; then the remainder of the milk, which must be in all a quart; a large spoonful of brandy stirred in; then add the whites beaten to a stiff froth; butter a baking dish, and pour in the batter. The lightness of this pudding depends on the whipping of the eggs. Bake it in rather a quick oven half an hour; send to table the instant it comes from the oven ; serve with it wine sauce.^' A EiCH Wine Sauce. Stir into a table-spoonful of sifted flour, one half pint of cold water; mix it perfectly smooth; put this into a very clean sauce- pan, and put it over the fire; let it simmer until it becomes a starch ; then rub to a cream half a pound of good brown sugar, and a quarter of a pound of good butter; when it is well creamed stir it into the starch; then add a wine-glass of wine, and a table-spoonful of orange flower water; just as it is done grate in a little nutmeg; this is a very delightful sauce.

Bread and Cakes. 183 Delicious Bread. One tumbler full of good rice flour, one teacupful of wheat flour, one teaspoonful and a half of cream of tartar stirred in, one large spoonful of butter cut up very finely, a little salt, one egg well beaten, and one teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a large teacup of new milk; mix these well together, and bake in a pan, like pound cake. Serve hot for tea or breakfast. Indian Pound Cakes. To one pint of corn-meal add one half pound of flour; cream one-half pound of butter with three-fourths pound of sugar; beat eight eggs very light, and stir into the butter and sugar with one teaspoonful of ground cinnamon, half a nutmeg grated, one wine glass of wine, one of brandy; these must be added slowly, and well stirred in; then add slowly, with a knife, the meal and flour. Nice Kolls. Two pounds of flour, a little salt, two large spoonsful of good brown sugar dried and sifted; three spoonsful of butter, cut up into one pint of good new milk; set the sponge to rise over night. If you have any bread sponge, mix the above ingredients into it, adding two well beaten eggs; make this into rolls, and set them to rise early in the morning, if for breakfast, and bake on the tins, without disturbing after having risen. Never put sugar into any cake before rising, but add it afterwards. Corn-Meal Cakes. One quart of meal, one pint of boiling milk, a teaspoonful of salt, a large spoonful of soda; set it to rise in a warm place; when risen, add as much flour and corn-meal as will make a stiff batter; then let it stand half an hour, then pour into the tins. Bake two hours. This requires beating until very light.

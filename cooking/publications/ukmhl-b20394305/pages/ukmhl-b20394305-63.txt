Boiling. 57 is better and more juicy for slow simmering ; the slower it boils the tenderer, plumper and whiter it will be. Twenty minutes to the pound for fresh, and rather more for salted meat, allowing for the weather and the thickness of the joint. In cold weather, meat requires more cooking than in warm. This, also, requires practice and experience. Fresh killed meat takes longer than that which butchers call ripe ) if fro- zen, it must be thawed before cooking. For a small family, th© best article for boiling purposes is a tinned saucepan, of a large size, with a closely fitting top, to prevent evaporation by which the nutritive parts are lost.

Beef and mut- ton a little underdone is better, but pork and poultry must be thoroughly cooked—or they are uneatable—but not over- done. It is an excellent plan to place a trivet in the bottom of the pot, and then lay that which is to be boiled on it; it prevents contact with the bottom of the pot. An inverted soup plate answers as well as a trivet. A good housekeeper never has a boil without converting the broth into soup, either the same day or the next. The broth should always be put away carefully in a clean vessel kept exclusively for that purpose.

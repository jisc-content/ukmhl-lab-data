PRESERVING; &0. 286 till the next day, when put the apples in glass jars or large bowls, spread the lemon peel about them, and put the syrup on the top; paste several thicknesses of paper over, and set them in a dry cool closet. If you only want the apples to keep a few weeks, they may be done with half a pound of sugar to a pound of apples, and will look and taste quite as well. Limes. Take green limes and put them into salt and water, strong enough to bear an egg, for six weeks (first making an incision in each one of them the length of the lime); at the end of six weeks take out all the seeds, and put them into cold water twenty-four hours, changing the water several times; then boil them in soda water till tender enough to put a straw through; say one tea- spoonful to six quarts of water. Put them again in cold water for twenty-four hours, changing the water several times. To each pound of limes, two pounds and a half of crushed sugar, and three pints of water. Boil syrup fifteen minutes, then put in limes; boil them slowly one hour and a quarter. They are then clear. Let the syrup boil fifteen minutes more, and they are all done. One hundred limes make about two pounds weight. These preserves are delicious. Tomato Figs. Take six pounds of sugar to one peck (or sixteen pounds) of ripe tomatoesâ€”the pear-shaped look best; put them over the fire (withoutpeeling) in your preserving kettle, their own juice being sufficient without the addition of water; boil them until the sugar penetrates and they are clarified. They are then taken out, spread on dishes, flattened and dried in the sun, or in a brick-oven after the bread is taken out. A small quantity of the syrup should be occasionally sprinkled over them whilst dry- ing; after which, pack them down in jars, sprinkling each layer

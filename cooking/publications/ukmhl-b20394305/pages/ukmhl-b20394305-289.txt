281 Preserving^ &c. To Preserve Tomatoes. Pick off the stems from green tomatoes and weigh them, make a strong tea of green ginger, simmer them slowly in the tea for two hours, and then take them out and spread on dishes; make a syrup, allowing one pound of sugar to one pound of tomatoes; take the pieces of ginger that were in the tea, and put them in the syrup, put in the tomatoes, and let them boil until quite clear; when sufficiently cooked, lay them on dishes to cool; boil the syrup some time longer, leaving enough to cover the tomatoes when poured over them; put the ginger away with the tomatoes. Preserved Citron. Take some fine citron melons; pare, core and cut them into long slices; then weigh them; and to every six pounds of melon allow six pounds of the best loaf sugar, and the juice and yellow rind pared off very thin of four large fresh lemons; also a half pound of race ginger. Put the slices of melon into a preserving kettle; cover them with a strong alum-water, and boil them half an hour, or longer, if they do not look quite clear; then drain them, lay them in a broad vessel of cold water, cover them, and let them stand all night; in the morning tie the race-ginger in a thin muslin cloth, and boil it in three pints of clear pump or spring water till the water is highly flavored; then take out the bag of ginger; having broken up the sugar, put it into a clean preserving kettle, and pour the ginger-water over it; when the sugar has all melted, set it over the fire, put in the yellow peel of the lemons, and boil and skim it till no more scum rises; then remove the lemon-peels, put in the sliced citrons, and the juice of the lemons, and boil them in the syrup till the slices are all quite transparent, but not till they break; when done, put the citrons and syrup into a large tureen, set it in a dry, cool, dark place, and leave it uncovered for two or three days till all the watery particles have exhaled; afterwards put the slices carefully into wide-mouthed glass jars, and gently pour in the syrup.

The flour must always be dried and sifted before using; the butter wMch is employed washed, and all the water worked out; the best paste is made with beef suet. Eender six pounds of nice beef suet; strain it through a hair sieve into a clean pan ; to this add a bottle of the best olive oil; stir it well, and then put into jars, each contain- ing about three pounds; cover tightly, and keep in a very cool place. Not more than two jars should be prepared at a time for a small family, as the suet is liable to become musty, and will not keep long. In making the pastry for pies, when you require it flaky and particularly good, sift one pound of best flour into a pan, then cut into it three-fourths of a pound of the prepared suet; be careful to use the hands as little as possible, and the less worked the better; when all the required suet is cut up add salt to the taste, mois- ten it with cold water, (in summer ice water,) then flour your pasteboard, which must be always very clean, and never used twice without scouring; roll it as little as possible, and add another quarter of a pound of the suet in thin slices ; between each rolling add the suet in thin slices, and dust in with flour; the more thinly it is rolled the lighter the paste. Have ready the pie plates, or pudding; be careful in rolling that you always roll from you, and make it as quickly as possible. For meat pies, the nicest paste is made by sifting into a pan one pound of flour, make a hole in the centre of the dry flour, cut into this hole some suet three-fourths of a pound not prepared, but strip ofi" all the skin, then pour over this suet half a pint of boiling

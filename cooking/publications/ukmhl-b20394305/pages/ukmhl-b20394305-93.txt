Cut a neck or loin of mutton, that has been kept until ten- der, into chops ; trim off some of the fat, and lay them in a stew-pan with a large spoonful of butter. Have a quick fire, or they will not brown nicely. While the chops are brown- ing, peel and boil one dozen of little white button onions in three pints of cold water for twenty minutes j set them aside and pour the water in which they were boiled into the stew- pan with the chops, as soon as they are brown. If that does not cover them, add more boiling water j then set them on the fire to stew slowly for half an hour, skimming care- fully. When tender, pour off all the gravy through a sieve, and skim off every particle of fat. Have ready boiled four or five turnips and two or three carrots; pour all the water from them and cut them into slices; thicken the gravy with a spoonful of butter; stir it in and let it simmer five minutes, then add the carrots, turnips and onions.

Stews, &c. 120 Omelet Souffle Break six eggs; leave out the whites, put them in a cold place until required; add to the yolks a little powdered sugar, a little grated lemon, a little nutmeg, a few drops of lemon juice, and beat all together, add a few spoonsful of cream; then beat up the six whites very stiff; put a piece of butter in your omelet-pan upon a slow fire 5 when hot pour in the ome- let, mix in your whites very gently, turn it out on your dish, glaze it with pounded sugar, put it in the oven, sprinkle more sugar, and send it to table very hot. Omelet Souffle in a Mould. Break six fresh eggs, separate the whites and yolks, put to the latter three spoonsful of powdered sugar, four crushed macaroons, a spoonful of potato flour, a little orange flower water, stir them well together, whip the whites of the eggs to a froth, mix them with the yolks, and pour the whole into a buttered mould, but do not fill it; set it in a moderate oven the same as for biscuits, and when done, turn it out on a dish, and serve it. This omelet should be of a clear colour, and shake like a jelly. Poaching Eggs. The eggs must be fresh for poachingâ€”two days laid are the best. Have ready the boiling water in a shallow pan, break the eggs separately in a saucer, as one bad one will spoil the others, then slip the egg gently into the boiling water ; when all are in the water, put the pan on a moderate fire until the water boils, and the white is perfectly set, then with a slicer lay the eggs on buttered toast or broiled ham.

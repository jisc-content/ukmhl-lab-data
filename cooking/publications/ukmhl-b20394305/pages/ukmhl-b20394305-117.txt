Ill Stews, &c. Stewed Leg of Veal, Select; a good fat leg with a small portion of the fillet left on, crack it in two or three places, and wash it and lay it in a stew-pan. Slice two lemons very thinly and lay on it, a small blade of mace broken up finely, sprinkle a little salt, and a shake of pepper ; on this pour just enough cold water to cover the leg, set it in an oven and cover the pan tightly. Let it cook slowly for four hours, and skim it occasionally, so as to be entirely free from scum or fat; if it becomes dry add a very little cold water. When done pour off any gravy in the pan, and rub a small spoonful of flour and half a spoonful of butter well together, and stir it into the gravy. Let it simmer, and just before dishing add a wine glass of good cooking wine. Pour some of the gravy over the leg, and serve the rest in a sauce-boat. This is nice sliced for tea if any is left cold. Tomato Stew. Take eight pounds of the plate of beef, put it on to boil in a gallon of water, with a dozen of tomatoes, the same of okras, six potatoes cut small, two carrots cut lengthwise, two onions; season it to your taste with pepper and salt; let it stew slowly four hours; skim all the fat off the gravy, and garnish the meat with the potatoes and carrots. Corn Fritters. Grate six ears of corn; add one tablespoonful of flour, and two eggs; pepper and salt to your taste; to be fried like oysters.

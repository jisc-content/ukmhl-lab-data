Miscellaneous Keceipts. oZo Hints to Lovers of Flowers. A most beautiful and easily attained show of evergreens in winter may be had by a very simple plan, which has been found to answer remarkably well on a small scale. If geranium branches are taken from healthy and luxurious trees just before the winter sets in, cut as for slips, and immersed in soap and water, they will, after drooping for a few days, shed their leaves, put forth fresh ones, and continue in the finest vigour all the winter. By placing a number of bottles filled in flower baskets, with moss to conceal the bottles, a show of evergreens is easily insured for a whole season; they require no fresh water. To Remove Rust from Steel. Rub the article with olive oil well, then sprinkle a little hot slacked lime over, lay the steel article then in a dry place for forty-eight hours, take some finely powdered fresh unslacked lime, and rub on it quick and hard until the rust all disappears, then polish with dry whiting and a soft leather. Cold Cream. Two ounces of the oil of sweet almonds; half an ounce of spermaceti; half an ounce of white wax, melt these together, then stir in two large spoonsful of rose water, and while hot put into little pots; this is very nice for chapped lips. Superior Method of Keeping Butter. Take two quarts of the best dairy salt; one ounce of good sugar ; one ounce of saltpetre, mix these well together; then one ounce of this mixture to one pound of the best made butter, work this well into the butter, and when all the butter is worked with this proportion put it into stone vessels tightly covered, and keep in a cool, dry place; it is not impregnated with the salt before a month. Butter thus prepared, if of a good quality, retains all its original flavor and no saltness, and will keep for a year sweet and fresh.

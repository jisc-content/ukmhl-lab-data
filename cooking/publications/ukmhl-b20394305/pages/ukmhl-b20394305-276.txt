Salting Meat. 268 To MAKE Mutton Hams. Take four mutton hams or legs of mutton, good, tender, and rather fat meat, and mix for them a quart of salt, a quarter of a pound of coarse brown sugar, and one ounce of saltpetre; mix these well together, and rub the hams with the mixture for a considerable time; then put them into a tub or tray, rub them with the brine they yield every other day for twelve days; then wipe them carefully, and hang in the smoke house the thick end upwards. To Prevent Insects or Worms from getting into Hams OR Shoulders. Take two bottles of cayenne, the best quality, in all about a quarter of a pound to about one thousand weight of the pork, and mix in with the salt and saltpetre, but rubbed freely in be- fore packing ; if properly looked after and kept in a dry place, there is no danger of insects; if the weather becomes sultry and damp during the summer, a very little smoke occasionally will prevent any bad consequences. When the hams are hung up, if any apprehension is felt about insects, make a thin paste of one pound of wheat flour and three quarts of water; when cold, add two pounds of good black pepper, and a quarter of a pound of cayenne; with this cover the hams well and no insect will ever touch them. To Cure Beep and Beef Tongues. To four gallons of water, add eight pounds of rock-salt (Turk's Island), two ounces saltpetre, and one pint of molasses; dissolve them well in water, cold or boiling, as choice may dictate; if the latter, when cold pour it over the meat, which must be kept down with a weight, though not too heavy. Drying pieces to remain in only ten days. This same receipt will apply equally to hams, but they must not be cured together; if of the weight of ten to twelve pounds, keep them in four weeks, larger, five or six weeks, in proportion.

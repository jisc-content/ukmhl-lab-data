345 Hints about Varied Meals. Monday's dish, and the gravy and trimmings left will make nice soup for Monday; no soups on Sundays, as every considerate mistress regards her domestics, and as an evidence of that should render their Sabbath labour light, consistent with the comfort and health of the household. This ^^bill of fare'' can of course be added to, or retrenched; it is only a nucleus for the catering ideas of a young mistress of a household so as to vary each day's provision; soup should be a daily dish at the board ; it can be made in small or large quantities, and if prepared with care is acceptable and nutritious, particularly to the aged, who have no longer the full powers of mastication; it is economical as it is better made from gravies and broths, than in any other way. The family health is very much promoted by changing the food, and on the mistress this of course depends, to the inexperienced it is often very perplex- ing to effect this. Made dishes of course cannot be included in this limited bill of fare/^ and as the receipts afford a great variety, the house- keeper cannot be at a loss to make an addition to the table when one is required, and a nicely prepared stew or mince is often pre- ferred to a joint. With regard to desserts they must be varied according to taste, the book provides a great number of excellent puddings, pies, and light fancy desserts ; in the summer fruits relieve from all difficulty on that score. Stewed fruits can be prepared at all seasons, and are generally not in sufficient use in families, they are much preferable to preserves, more healthy, and retain if rightly prepared more of the flavour of the fruit, particularly the apple and peach. Corn bread is not enough honoured at Northern tables; the ^ difficulty oi having it well prepared has been one of the causes, as all who go South enjoy it; it is stated that a difference exists between the Northern and Southern meal, there is something in that; but it can be very deliciously prepared here if the mistress will superintend the compounding, her success will reward her for the labour.

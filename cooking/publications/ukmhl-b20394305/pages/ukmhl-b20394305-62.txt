56 BOILING. This most simple culinary process is not often done pro- perly. The great requisites are, to skim your pot well, and keep it boiling slowly, and to know how long it requires boil- ing, and to take the article from the pot at the moment it is cooked. These comprehend the whole mystery and art. This, however, demands vigilance. The cook must take care that the pot is kept boiling ; on the scum being carefully re- moved as it rises depends the good appearance of all boiled things. When the scum is first removed, throw in some cold water, which will cause the rest of the scum to rise. The oftener skimmed, the cleaner and sweeter will be the meat. If thoroughly and often skimmed, there is not any neces- sity of wrapping in a cloth; and, in fact, muffling affects the flavour of meat or fowls. Put your meat into cold water in the proportion of about a quart of water to a pound of meat, and it should be kept covered during the whole process of boiling. It is desirable that boiling pieces should be of an equal thickness, if not, the thick parts are not done before the thinner are overdone. The water should be gradually heated 5 if the water boil before the meat becomes thoroughly heated, the meat will be rendered hard, and shrink up; by keeping the water a certain time heated before boiling, the fibres of the meat are dilated, and it yields a quantity of scum, which must be taken off as soon as it rises.

MISCELLANEOUS EECEIPTS. Pop Corn. Put some nice fresh lard into a pan; when boiling, drop in the corn and cover tightly, to prevent it popping out of the pan ; when done popping, remove the corn from the pan and put them into a colander to drain; have ready some nice steam syrup, heat it and flavour with either Seville orange juice or lemon juice; when simmering drop in the corn ; let it simmer for ten minutes; take it out in large lumps and lay on buttered dishes to cool. For Chillblains. Cut up two white turnips without paring into thin slices; put the slices into a tin cup with three large spoonsful of best lard; let it simmer very slowly for two hours, then mash this through a sieve, when cold spread it on a soft linen cloth, and apply to the chillblain at night; one or two applications will cure the most inveterate chillblain, or frost feet. To Destroy Caterpillars. Hang pieces of woollen cloth amongst the bushes and shrubs; the caterpillar will during the night take shelter on the cloth, and in that way thousands may be destroyed every morning. Patent Linen Polish. One pint of flour starch, two ounces of gum-arabic, one ounce and a half of white bees-wax, a small piece of alum, stirred in while boiling; boil one hour slowly. S28

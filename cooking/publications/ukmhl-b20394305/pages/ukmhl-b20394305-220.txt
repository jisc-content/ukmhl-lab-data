214 Pastry. a few blades of brokea-iip mace; chop up a little fresh parsley and scatter through as the pieces of rabbit are laid in; take about a pint of the water in which the rabbits were cooked, and having rubbed a spoonful of flour and two spoonsful of butter together, stir it into the water, a very little cayenne to be added; when the butter and flour are smoothly stirred into the water, pour it over the rabbits; cover them over with a nice paste, and bake half an hour; serve hot. Veal Pot Pie. Take a shank bone, the neck, or any nice piece of veal; wash them and joint well, and crack the bones; put the piece into a stew pan, and on the top lay a bunch of summer savoury and parsley tied together with an eschalot, add a little salt; on this pour cold water enough just to cover it; let it simmer for twenty minutesâ€”then line a stew pot with good potatoe crust; put in a layer of the separated parts of veal, and cut very thin slices of corned fat pork, and thin slices of white potatoes; then another layer of veal, pork, and potatoes; so on until all is in; then take a pint of the water in which the veal was cooked, and stir into it two large spoonsful of flour; when smoothly mixed add a little pepper, and pour it over the meat; cover the top with paste, close tightly, and bake three-quarters of an hour; should it become dry make a small hole in the top, and add more of the broth; it must be baked a nice brown, but care taken that the paste doQg not scorch; before lining the pot grease it to prevent the paste sticking. Serve hot. Cream Crust. This is the least objectionable kind of crust which is made; take either sour or sweet cream, and stir in as much sifted flour as will make a stiff" paste, and add a little salt; if the cream used is sour dissolve in it some soda in the proportion of a teaspoonful to one pint of cream; if sweet cream one half as much soda; mould this as little as possible.

PRESERVING; &0. 276 hours; then put on fresh coverings and cork tightly. The finely pulverized sifted sugar from some cause in the preparation does not answer for either preserves or jellies; the only kind to be used, is the loaf sugar of the best quality; there is economy in using it. To Clarify Sugar. Break up two pounds of loaf sugar; put it into a porcelain saucepan; pour on one pint of cold fresh water, when this is perfectly dissolved set the saucepan on a moderate heat; beat the white of one egg, and before the syrup becomes hot stir in the egg well through; watch it very carefully, and when it begins to boil remove the scum as it rises; continue to boil it until no more scum rises; then remove it, and either bottle it for future use, or use it at once for preserving; this is the basis of all syrup; it can be increased to any quantity, only preserving the above proportions in preparing it; this will keep for months in a cool place. GURAgOA. To one pint of the strongest rectified spirits of wine or pure alcohol, add two drachms and a half of the sweet *^oil of orange peel," obtained at the druggists; shake these well together; then add one pint of the above clarified syrup; shake these well together; this is an admirable liqeur and flavors cake pleasantly. Orange Syrup. Select ripe and thin skinned fruit; squeeze the juice of the fruit through a sieve; to every pint of juice add one pound and a half of loaf sugar; simmer this very slowly; remove the scum which rises; continue to do so, as long as any is on the surface; then let it become cool; then bottle it off; cork very tightly; two table-spoonsful of this will flavor sauce for puddings delight- fully, and is very nice to flavor custards; fresh lemons can be prepared in the same way, observing the same proportions.

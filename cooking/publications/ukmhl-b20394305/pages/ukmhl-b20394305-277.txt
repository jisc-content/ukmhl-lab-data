269 Salting Meat. Another to Cure Beef and Tongues. To one hundred pounds of beef, take six gallons of water, six pounds of salt, four ounces of saltpetre, and one pound and a quarter of brown sugar; the beef to remain in eleven days, then hang to dry. For Curing Hams and Beef. Take as much water as will cover your beef, add clean salt till it will bear an egg, so that the egg will show above the pickle as large as a shilling, half ounce saltpetre to a gallon, and molasses enough to make it the color of good molasses and water, or cider color; let the beef lay in ten days, and then hang to drain in a cool place. For hams, make the same as for beef, except saltpetre, of which add a tablespoonful for a large ham. Do not pack them too tight, keep them well covered with pickle, and remove all scum. They should lay in pickle about six weeks. Take them out, and hang them up to dry. When dry outside, commence smoking; a light mahogany color is best, and bag before the flies come. Hickory or apple tree chips are best for smoking. The above are superior to the mode of dry salting and rubbing, as practised by some, also less trouble, and making a more juicy and highly flavored ham. 23^

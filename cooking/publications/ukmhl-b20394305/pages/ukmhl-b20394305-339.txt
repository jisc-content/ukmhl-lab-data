Every one eats walnuts, everybody knows how to make pickle of walnuts; few, however, know the medical virtue of walnuts. Now, the fact is, walnuts, when properly prepared, are an excel- lent medicine and alterative, and this is the way to prepare them: Get the green walnuts fit for pickling; put them in a stone jar filled up with sugar, in the proportion of half a pound to a score of walnuts; place the jar in a saucepan of boiling water, for about three hours, taking care that the water does not get in, and keep it simmering during the operation. The sugar, when dissolved, should cover the walnuts; and if it does not, add more, cover it close, and, in six months, it will be fit for use; the older it gets the better it is.

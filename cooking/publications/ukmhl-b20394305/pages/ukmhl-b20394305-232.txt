Pastry. 224 Plain Oyster Pie. Take from the shell as many oysters as you want to put into the pie; strain the liquor, put it with them over the fire and give them one boil; take off the scum, put in, if you wish to make a small pie, a quarter of a pound of butter, as much flour mixed in water as will thicken it when boiled, and mace, pepper, and salt to your taste; lay a paste in a deep dish, put in the oysters and cover them with paste; cut a hole in the middle, ornament it any way you please, and bake it. A shallow pie will bake in three-quarters of an hour. Another. Take fifty oysters—strain the liquor—line a dish with good crust, take two hard-boiled eggs, chop them fine, mix them with a slice of bread crumbled fine; add pepper, salt and nutmeg to your taste; then to each layer of oysters sprinkle some of the mixture; it is best to reserve some of the oyster liquor for gravy. To be served in a gravy dish. A Rich Oyster Pie. Strain off the liquor from the oysters, and put it on to boil, with some butter, mace, nutmeg, pepper and salt; just as it boils, stir in a thickening of milk and flour; put in the oysters, and stir them till they are sufficiently stewed; then take them off, and put in the yolks of two eggs, well beaten; do not put this in while it is boiling or it will curdle. Line a dish, not very deep, with puff paste; fill it with white paper, or a clean napkin, to keep the top paste from falling in; put on a lid of paste and bake it. When done take off the lid carefully; take out the paper or napkin, and pour in the oysters. Send it hot to table.

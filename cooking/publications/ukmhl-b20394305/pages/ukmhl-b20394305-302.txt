Core and pare any quantity of good tart apples, weigh an equal quantity of good brown sugar, then chop up the apples; grate some fresh lemon peel, and shred some white ginger; make a good syrup of the sugar and skim it well; then throw in the apples, lemon peel, and ginger; let it all boil until the fruit looks clear and yellow: this is a delicious jam. ^ Raspberry Jam. Pick them over very carefully, as this fruit is very liable to worms; weigh equal quantities of berries and sugar, put the fruit into a kettle, and break it with a ladle and stir continually; let it boil quickly; when the watery particles are all evaporated, add the sugar, this is better than adding the sugar at first; let it dimmer slowly for twenty minutes, then put in jars and cover.

Take the poorest of quinces 3 pare, core, and boil them iii as little water as will cover them; when quite soft, put them on a sieve, and when cold weigh them, and break them with a ladle ; to a pound of fruit add one pound of good brown sugar; put them on the fire and simmer slowly for one hour, stirring con- stantly in them; put it into jars for use, covering very tightly; a great improvement is to add one-third of sweet apple to the quince; this requires no addition of sugar.

Select not too ripe pears, wash and parboil them soft, when cold rub them through a colander; to two pounds of pears allow one pound of good brown sugar; simmer slowly for one hour, then put into jars; cork tightly.

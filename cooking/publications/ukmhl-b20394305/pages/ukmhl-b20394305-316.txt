S06 Desserts, Jellies, Blanc-Manges, &c. pound them in a mortar, continually moistening them with half a tea-spoonful of water at a time, to prevent their oiling. When they are pounded as fine as possible take them out of the mortar, and put them into a pan, then with a silver spoon beat up your almonds gradually with five glasses of water; after this spread a napkin over an oval dish, and put your almonds upon it, then gather up the corners of your napkin, and wring it very tight to press out all the milk from the almonds, then put into this milk twelve ounces of crystallized sugar broken into small pieces. When the sugar is dissolved pass the whole through a sieve, and then add to it one ounce of clarified isinglass rather warmer than lukewarm, and when the whole is well incorporated together pour it into your mould; your mould should be previ- ously put into pounded ice; when your blanc-mange is ready to serve, which will be in two hours after it has been put into the mould, you must take it out. Apples a la Turque. Pare and core ten good pippins, put them into a kettle with clarified sugar, cover them closely and simmer very gently, turn- ing often so as to have both sides well cooked; when soft and clear take them out and lay on a dish with wet white paper over them; put around the margin of the dish a rim of puff paste; when the paste is done fill the holes of the apples with raspberry or currant jam, beat the whites of six eggs to a stiff froth, and add to them four large spoonsful of white sifted Sugar, beat this in with the whites; put this on the apples; sift some fine white sugar over the whites; set in the oven until baked a light brown. Curds and Cream. Turn to curd three or four pints of milk with runnet; before serving drain off the whey, and pour over some cream; then sweeten half a pint of rich cream and grate nutmeg over it; serve this with the curd.

223 Pastry. Mince Pies. Take four pounds of beef after it has been boiled and "chop- ped, one of suet, two of sugar, two of raisins, and four of chop- ped apples; mix these together, with a pint of wine and cider, to ^ make it thin enough; season to your taste with mace, nutmeg and orange peel; if it is not sweet enough, put in more sugar. Warm the pies before they are eaten. Where persons are not fond of suet, put butter instead, and stew the apples instead of so much cider. Corn Pie. Take a young tender chicken and cut up as for frying, salt it and let it lay for several hours ; then take eight or twelve ears of corn, if large eight will do, grate it off the cob, scrape all that adheres, to this add three or four well beaten eggs, quarter of a pound of butter, seasoned highly with pepper, and one pint of new milk. Put in the chicken and the liquid which is around it. If more salt be required stir it up well before putting in. Put the above in a pan deep enough to allow of its puffing. When it first begins to cook stir it well several times, as the rich- ness is apt to settle. When it begins to puff mash it down. Bake it in a moderate oven an hour and a half; brown it before taking it out. Chicken Pie. Cut up the chickens, and if they are old, boil them fifteen minutes in a little water, which save to put in the pie; make a paste like common pie crust, and put it round your pan or dish; lay in the chicken, dust flour over, and put in butter, pepper and salt; cover them with water, roll out the top crust quite thick; and close the pie round the edge; make an opening in the middle with a knife; let it bake rather more than an hour. If you warm a pie over for the next day, pour off the gravy and warm it separately, and add it to the pie.

A Receipt eor Salt Spiced Hams. This is for six hams only, and is very excellent, and for legs of mutton also : take quarter of a pound of pounded saltpetre, three quarts of fine dairy salt, one pound and a half of good brown sugar, six ounces pounded cloves, six ounces best ground cayenne pepper; mix these well together, divide it into six equal parts accurately, then rub each ham well with the mixture of its own portion, lay them in a firkin or salting tub, the skin side down, closely packed, and any mixture not used sprinkled over; let them remain thus for three days, then change their position by placing the top ones below and those beneath above; do this every third day for six weeks, and on each removal pour over the pickle they have made themselves ; if the hams have absorbed the salt, &c., sprinkle some more salt each time they are changed; at the end of six weeks take them out and smoke them with hickory chips or saw dust, but be careful in removing them not to remove any part of the mixture which covers them; the hock should be well rubbed with it.

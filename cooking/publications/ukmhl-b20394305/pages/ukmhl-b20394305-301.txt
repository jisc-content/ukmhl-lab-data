Jellies and Jams. 291 apricots into the cold water from the saleratus water; when all are removed put in more apricots, if the saleratus is not discoloured, if it is, make fresh; take the apricots out of the cold water and wipe them on a coarse cloth, to remove the down; when all the fruit is ready place them into a preserving kettle, and just cover them with water; let them simmer very slowly, and un- covered to evaporate the water; after they have become soft take out all the stones; break the stones, and blanch the kernels by pouring the water on them; then put the blanched kernels into the kettle with the marmalade as they improve the flavour; let this be thoroughly well cooked; then press the pulp through a colander; to guard against the pulp sticking whilst it is cooking, it is a good plan to lay when it is first put into the kettle a large dining plate in the bottom of the kettle. After the pulp is all strained through, add one pound of crushed white sugar, to one pint of the pulp and juice of the fruit; simmer this only twenty minutes stirring carefully to prevent scorching ; then put it into jars and cork tightly; any kind of fruit may be prepared in the same manner; only not requiring the saleratus water; that is done to remove the down. Pine Apple Jam. Select large ripe pine apples; pare them carefully; then grate them; preserve all the juice with the pulp in grating; then weigh the fruit and juice, and put it all into a kettle; let it slowly heat, stirring very carefully, or else placing a plate at the bottom, which is best; having weighed the juice and jam as directed, allow an equal quantity of the best white crushed sugar, put the sugar in,when it has simmered fifteen minutes; great care must be used to guard against the least scorch, or the deli- cate flavour of the pine apple will be affected; let it simmer ^ thirty minutes after the sugar is added, then add one pint of white brandy to one kettle of jam, stir this through gently, so as to become incorporated with the mass ; this prevents fermen- tation ; let it simmer five minutes slowly after the brandy is stirred in, then put it into jars, cork tightly, covered, and keep

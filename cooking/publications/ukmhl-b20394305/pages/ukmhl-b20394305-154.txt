Cranberries Stewed for^eats and Poultry. Pick and wash one quart of cranberries, pour them into a cullender to drain, then put the berries into a tinned or por- celained saucepan, but no water, excepting that which remains on them from washing ; mix through when in the saucepan three-quarters of a pound of light brown sugar, then cover tightly, and set them in the oven to cook slowly.

282 Preserving, &c. Lay inside of each jar upon the surface of the syrup a double white tissue-paper cut exactly to fit, and then close the lids of the jars; this will be found a delicious sweetmeat, equal to any brought from the West Indies, and is well worth doing. To Preserve Pine Apples. Take one pound of sugar to one pound of fruit; make a syrup as directed; slice the apples in it, letting them stand about twenty minutes, then boil twenty minutes, and boil the syrup fifteen minutes after taking out the apples; lay the apples on a dish and let them stand one night before adding the syrup; the thin syrup which comes from the apples in the dish should not be added, as this would cause them to ferment. To Preserve Pine Apples without Cooking. Take one pound of sugar, to one pound of fruit, putting into ^ small sized glass jars a layer of fruit and of sugar alternately; to each jar add about half a tumbler of the best white brandy, varying the quantity according to the size of the jar; these must be corked and sealed to make them air tight, and it is a good plan to turn the jars bottom up occasionally for a few days after they are first put up. To Preserve Gages Green. Lay in the bottom of a saucepan a thick layer of grape leaves well washed, on these place a layer of gages, each having been pricked with needles to prevent their bursting; then another layer of leaves; again the gages; so on until all the fruit is in; then cover them with spring or soft cold water; place them in a situation to heat but not to cook; keep them covered, let them remain for six hours; then take them out very carefully, they will be yellow, and lay fresh grape leaves alternately with the gages to green them, covered with the same water in which they were yellowed; then keep them in a warm place for four hours;

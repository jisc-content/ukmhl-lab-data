28 ALL ABOUT PIPING, [chap Plate ii. their tubes are worthless, and a hindrance' to the display of abili- ties in piping. Their clumsy, old-fashioned tubes, with screws and shoulders; their monstrous indiarubber bags with screws, I have never seen equalled in all my world-wide travels. These nstruments were in fashion over seventy-five years ago, when our grandfathers were in the trade ; but these times are over—over for ever. Throw these so-called tubes in the fire, to-day—not to- morrow—as they are a detriment to your business rather than a help. If the manufacturers of such deformed tools only had any idea about piping, they could not and would not sell such shameful rubbish. The purchase-money is only thrown away, for a real piper could never w^ork with such instruments. The English confectioner, until he does away with these mon- strous things, will never get a piper. Only a practical confectioner may say how a proper tube has to be—nobody else ! The British " Baking Outfitter " understands the tube question just as much as the Mail in the Moon I Such is the case ! I am the man who opened the eyes of the British confectioner as to how a proper tube ought to look. t^A f As a matter of course, these " bakers' outfitters " are not much in love with me, as I offer real workable tubes for one-third of the price they demand for their rubbish. I was attacked on several different occasions with regard to this question. In reply to which attacks I assured these persons that the future would decide the question of the superiority of my tubes over theirs, as a real good thing always makes its own way. And already—after the lapse of only a few years—there are many imitations sold by travellers, who offer them as my make.

i8 ALL ABOUT PIPING. [chap. Cakes of Thus cakes with two tiers or more have to be treated in two and g^^zing and piping as two or three separate cakes. It is impossible more tiers. glaze and pipe them as one cake. When dried and piped place them simply one on top of the other. If delivering the cake directly to the wedding house, their fastening them together with icing would only embarrass the person who had to start cutting the cake, who is generally the bride herself. It will be quite another matter if the cake has to be sent by rail in a box to a great distance. In this case, having glazed and piped each tier separately as before, they must be fastened together. In order to do so I recommend the space of the lower central tiers, which has to be occupied by a smaller cake, to be only glazed. When putting them together apply some icing between, which makes them stick. Let me also recommend that the lower outside part of the smaller cake, which has to be placed on a larger one, should be left unpiped, and better only filled out by the bag when fastening the two cakes together, thus making them stick better, and gives a greater solidity and resistance to the effects of a long journey by rail. Dummies advisable to place real bride-cakes for show in the window or on the counter, or under the influence of the sun's action; any cake having been exposed to the power of the sun for a while soon loses its appearance and qualities, and after a two months* exposure only may be unfit for sale. As dummies answer the purpose admirably, there is no necessity to incur this risk. In the case of dummies, glazing and piping is just the same as with a real cake; a wooden or tin block, or a cheese-box, or any other foundation will do, and may be employed for that purpose. 1

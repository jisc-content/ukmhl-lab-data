[chap. 26 ALL ABOUT PIPING. Filling bag lower end sufficiently to let a tube pass the opening for about half with icing, length, you may drop the tube into it and fill the bag, say about half full. Take up the icing with the lowest top extremity of the spatel> to prevent the icing dropping in a larger, broader shape than the opening of the bag allows. Avoiding any hanging of the icing on the paper's sides try to drop it into the very centre of the bag. The best method to prevent any such hanging on the sides of the bag^ is to take only a small portion of icing on the spatel and let it Plate io. drop, then a bit more, and so on, until you think the bag is about half filled. Later on, on your becoming more experienced in that business, you will, of course, then fill the bag with one spatel only. If the icing hangs already at the entrance of the bag, you will get it soon in your hands and fingers, which may be easily avoided. With this kind of bag made with piping paper, you have it en- tirely in your power to keep your hands and fingers clean and free from any icing. Any piper piping in a modern style can and must keep his hands and fingers free of any icing whatever; he may pipe for hours or days. As shown in the plate, the spatel in icing is to be held by the right fist.

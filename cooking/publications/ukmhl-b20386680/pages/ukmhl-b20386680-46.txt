[chap. ALL ABOUT PIPING, 32 You may lose or spoil a tube now and then, but you cannot wear them out with work. My tubes last a lifetime. In my opinion, when other dealers in this article make so much noise about the superiority of their tubes, it is merely for the sake of their charges. My stock of tubes comprises upwards of 160 different numbers of tubes. I retail them in sets of 18, and double sets of 36. A double set of 36 tubes does not mean that each of the tubes of a small set is twice represented. A double set contains a greater variety of tubes. I am in possession of hundreds of freely forwarded testimonials as to the nature of my tubes, and I think I ought to know how to make a good tube. This speaks for itself.

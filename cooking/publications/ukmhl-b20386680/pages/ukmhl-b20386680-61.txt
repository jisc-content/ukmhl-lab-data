VIII ] COLOURS FOR PIPING PURPOSES, 47 Any colour gets dry after a time. In summer sooner than in winter. In this case fill the colour glass occassionally with water, turn it over and let the water run out again; this will keep them moist. Do not stir the colour with a nail or any metal instrument, wood is the best thing to use. Good colours are very sensitive. If you leave a nail in a yellow, or pink, or blue colour, in a few days the colour will be quite black. To prevent any colour from drying out too quickly, and getting hard or being attacked by dust, keep these colours constantly corked. Any paste colour having become hard like stone through neglect cannot be again useful for piping. Pulverised colours are the things for dry colouring, such as for fondants, marzipan, &c., but are not suitable for piping, and are therefore useless to the piper. Gold and silver may here and there be very well adopted for ornamentation at the confectionery; not only that, we apply them as gold and silver leaves, &c. Say, for instance, you have an inscription written by the bag on a tablet of pink material, tragrant or marcipan, and you would bronze it over, after being a bit dry, with some liquid gold, to be had ready for use; it will make a superb improvement. The same with silvering over any inscription applied on a foundation of white, or light blue, will make a magnificent impression. Pupils with me in lesson, of course have the opportunity of getting more acquainted with all and everything in this respect. Colours to be kept moist. Pulverized colours. Gold and Silver.

ALL ABOUT PIPING. CHAPTER 1. OF ICING IX GENERAL, ICING for confectionery, that is to say, for piping and orna- menting, may be operated with the whites of fresh eggs, condensed whites, or with McGhie's icing powder, which has great analogy with gelatine or glue icing. The modus operandi with each of these three varieties of icing is in each case identical. A basin of icing can readily be prepared for useâ€”with scru- pulous cleanliness no mistake is possible. Delicacy and cleanliness must be the guiding stars of the operator during the whole course of the work. All the extra labour thus incurred will be amply compensated for eventually, and it will save an endless amount of work in the long run, and a great waste of material. Firstly, let the icing bowl and spatel be absolutely clean and dry. Enamelled bowls, which are now to be got anywhere, are most suitable for the work; their lightness is a great advantage and they last longer than any other kind of basin, it being almost impossible to break them. Besides, they can be thoroughly cleaned, without trouble, after having been employed for some other purpose. China or any earthen basin may also be employed without any inconvenience for icing purposes, except that of their brittleness, which is frequently a source of great expense. Wooden or tin dishes ought not to be employed. If, by chance, it is absolutely necessary to make use of a tin basin, no icing should be left in it \ one day's contact with the metal is sufficient to spoil the icing. Enamelled bowls are most suitable. Tin or wooden basins should not be used for icing.

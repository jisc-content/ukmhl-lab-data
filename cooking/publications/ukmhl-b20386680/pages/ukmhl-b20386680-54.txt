40 [chap. ALL ABOUT PIPING. Piping ^ good piper is required to be able to pipe a great deal without a without a tube altogether, only with the plain paper bag, which tube. means cutting the bag's lower end off in the shape and required size for piping. In this way the bag once emptied cannot be re- filledâ€”once piped out, it has to be thrown away. If it is merely a question of piping a few small pieces of pastry, for instance, when a single bag is sufficient, then no tube need be used. But it is not advisable to start piping a bride's-cake with a plain paper bag ; this would not answer. Different Whites icings are never employed on the continent for the styles of glazing of any kind of cakes or tarts; this is not relished, it being piping in thought too common. different Whites of eggs icing, once dried on the cake, is not very tasty countries, indeed. Abroad the glazings for cakes are water or fondant glazings, and every glazing is flavoured. Plate i6. The piping of the tart's top, which, of course, is done with whites icing, is nothing in comparison with the thick coating on an English bride-cake. The four or five different tubes I mentioned are the principal tubes any piper must be acquainted with. All the other kinds I give are either similar or very simple as regards their employment, and I consider any further explanation unnecessary, as a full description on paper as to what may be done with is difficult, if not impossible.

In piping I generally refill a bag four or five times, or even more, until the feel of the paper proves to me that it is giving way, or might burst. The bag then, I think, has done its duty, and I pipe it out and throw the paper away.

The best place for its storing is in any drawer, but out unrolled, of the bakehouse, in order that it may not be taken by those flat in who do not know its value, and use it up for cleaning tins, which sheets, would not be new to me.

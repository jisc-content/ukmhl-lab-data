Advertiseiimits. With respect to the advertisements that follow I wish to say that I have only accepted them where I have carefully examined and approved of the articles offered. Some of these I have used for years and found superior to anything else of the kind on the market. I can therefore conscientiously recommend them. My rule in these matters is that the best things go the farthest, and are therefore the cheapest in the end. HERR WILLY.

Pound a few boned and skinned sardines (say 4) Avith 1 teaspoonful of gravy, 1 ounce of butter, and pepper. Make it hot, and serve on fried sippets or buttered toast. 411.—Anchovy Toast. Butter some toast; spread a little anchovy paste over. Now put the well-beaten yolks of 2 eggs in a saucepan, with a quarter of a pint of cream; set it to thicken over the fire, but not to boil.

The things fried must be the colour of biscuits, and must be dry. If they are not, it is because there is not enough fat, or because it is not hot enough. The fat must always be clear, and have no specks; the same fat can be used frequently, and must be clarified always before using it again. 436.—To keep Butter for Winter Use. Put the butter, which must be quite fresh and without salt, in a large stewpan; let it gradually warm by the side of the fire for 1 or even 2 hours; if necessary, skim it. Now pour it into earthenware jars, taking care to leave the sediment in the pan, and not on any account to pour any into the jar. Cover the pots carefully, as you would jam, and keep for use. N.B.—When butter is very cheap, instead of salt- ing it and keeping it for winter cooking, it is very much better to proceed as above. Salt butter is not nice for cooking; I cannot repeat this too often. 437.—Proportions for Frying Batter. 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, 1 yolk of egg, 1 spoonful ot salad oil, 2 tablespoonfuls of milk.

sours. 21 egg; let it simmer a moment, but not boil, or the egg will curdle. 29.—Plain Vegetable Soup (without Meat). Carrots, turnips, onions, leeks, celery, pepper, and salt. Cut all into small pieces; toss them up in 1 or 2 ounces of butter, till they are thoroughly browned. Place all this in the saucepan with the water some lentils or haricot beans have been boiled in; simmer for 4 hours. Put in your tureen some fried sippets; pour the hot soup over. 30.—Simple Pea Soup. Put some young green peas in some boiling water; pepper and salt. When thoroughly cooked, add 2 ounces of fresh butter. Pour this in the tureen, over some sippets already fried in butter (those who object to butter may use 1 or 2 gills of cream). 31.—Rice and Pumpkin Soup. Cut some pumpkin into small pieces; put it in a saucepan, with some onion, a clove, piece of celery, pepper, salt, and water. When thoroughly cooked, pass it through a hair sieve. Put it back on the fire, with some rice which has previously soaked in warm water; add a little butter; simmer until the rice is cooked, and serve.

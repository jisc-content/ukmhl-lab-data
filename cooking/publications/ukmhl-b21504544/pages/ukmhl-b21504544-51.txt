Dish the cod and potatoes up on one dish; strain the gravy on to some nice slices of French roll into another dish, and serve the contents of both dishes together. Slightly salted cod may be cooked as above. 61.—Eouille a Baisse. Take a variety of fishes, such as mullet, whiting, soles, haddock—a small lobster if shell-fish is liked; cut them in pieces. Put in a wide and tolerably shallow saucepan a wine-glass of oil, 1 chopped onion, a bay leaf, a clove of garlic; toss all this together. Then place your pieces of fish in; add some salt to taste, a few slices of lemon, a few slices of tomato, a pinch of powdered saffron, a glass of white light wine ; add enough water to cover the fish; boil up quickly on a hot fire. The fish ought to be cooked in a quarter of an hour, and the gravy sufficiently reduced. Take the fish out, strain the sauce, put it back on the fire ; add a spoonful of finely chopped parsley, and a very little flour (not enough to make the sauce thick, but enough to prevent it being quite thin); place some slices of French roll in a deep dish; pour the sauce over. Place the fish in another dish, and serve the two dishes together. N.B.—Of course the true bouille a baisse is made D

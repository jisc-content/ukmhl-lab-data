171 SUNDMES. alone does not agree with them. In those cases use water, and add a little cold milk when you drink it. I find the best chocolate for this purpose is that of the Compagnie Coloniale, without vanilla. 429.—Meat Tea. Take 1 pound of lean beef, mutton, or chicken. Cut it into very small pieces; put it in a jar with 1 pint of cold water; put the jar in a saucepan of cold water, and let it gradually become warm, and let it simmer for 3 or 4 hours. It must not boil. Pass it through a hair sieve; flavour with salt, and, if liked, pepper. This meat tea can be taken plain, or thick- ened with sago, arrowroot, or bread-crumbs; or a little cream can be stirred in, or a couple of yolks of eggs, if the patient is allowed eggs. 430.—Barley Cream. 1 pound of veal. Skin it, and remove all fat; cut it in pieces, and put it in 1 quart of cold water and 1 ounce of barley. Simmer it slowly till it is reduced to 1 pint. Strain the liquor through a sieve, and then rub the meat and barley through a sieve. Add the liquor to it; it ought to be of the consistency of thick cream. Add salt to taste; and if the patient is allowed cream, a tablespoonful of cream well beaten in is an improvement.

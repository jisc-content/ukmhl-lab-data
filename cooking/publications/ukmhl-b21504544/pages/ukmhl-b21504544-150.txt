Stir them over the fire, with a good pinch of flour; gradually mix in half a pint of milk, some cinnamon, and candied lemon-peel; add a pounded maccaroon. Stir all the time, so that the mixture does not stick to the bottom of the saucepan, and be careful it does not boil. Now put the dish in which the sweet is to be served on the side of the fire, with some castor sugar and enough water to melt the sugar; when the sugar has coloured, stir the custard into it and serve at once. 329.—Bavaroise. 1 pint of double cream, 1 glass of rum or cura^oa or maraschino, three-quarters of an ounce of gelatine dissolved, 6 ounces of sugar. Whip the cream to a stiff froth; then mix the other ingredients in quickly and thoroughly. Pour into a mould, and serve when set. In warm weather it may be wise to embed the mould in ice.

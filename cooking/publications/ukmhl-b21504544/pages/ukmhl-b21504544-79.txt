VEGETABLES, ETC. 61 beaten, ancl 2 whites of eggs beaten to a froth. Place this high up on a baking-dish, smooth it with a knife, pour over some hot butter, and bake it in the oven. Must be served immediately it is cooked. 139.—Potatoes and White Sauce. Boil the potatoes, and peel them and cut them in slices; at once arrange them on the dish and pour over a white sauce. 140.—Cauliflower “ au Gratin.” Boil a cauliflower about two-thirds; divide it into branches. Make a melted butter sauce, into which you mix some grated Gruyere and Parmesan cheese. Place a layer of cauliflower on a baking-dish, then cover with sauce; then another layer of cauliflower and another layer of the sauce; sprinkle a little cheese over the whole, then a few bread-crumbs; pour a little hot butter over the top, and bake. N.B.—Unless the cauliflower is divided into layers it will not be good, as the sauce must cover every portion. It is also a great mistake to simply sprinkle cheese over the top; some must be mixed in the sauce too. For those who do not like cheese, a cauliflower # can be prepared in this manner with a plain melted butter, leaving out the cheese.

54 WHOLESOME COOKERY. 120.—Sweet Swiss Sauce. 1 gill of cream, 1 wine-glass of sherry, half a dessert- spoonful of flour (blended with the sherry). Boil the cream; then stir in the flour and sherry, and add 1 dessert-spoonful of castor sugar, three-quarters of a teaspoonful of grated nutmeg; boil together a quarter of an hour. 121.—Brown Butter. Put some butter in a small fryingpan, and let it melt until it is a rich brown colour. Be careful that it does not burn. Pour it over the fish or vegetable it is intended for; then pour a few drops of vinegar or lemon-juice into the pan, and pour that also over your dish of fish or vegetable. 122.—Anchovy Butter. Beat up some anchovy paste and butter together until the butter is a pink colour; keep to use on steaks or fried fish. A simple and quick anchovy toast may be made by spreading some on hot buttered toast. 123.—Horse-radish Butter. Grated-horse radish ; add salt to taste; pound up with butter. Good on broiled steaks.

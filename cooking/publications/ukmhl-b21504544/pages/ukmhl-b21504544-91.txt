Cut the turnips into slices, boil them for a few minutes, drain them; put them in a saucepan, with a lump of butter, pepper, salt, and some stock; simmer slowly until done. When cooked, pass through a sieve; put them back on the fire, add a little cream or butter, and serve up hot. If the puree should be too liquid, add a little potato flour at the same time as the cream, and simmer together for a few minutes. 176.—Glazed Turnips.

Now butter a stewpan, place the turnips side by side, pour over them some good stock or gravy; sprinkle over a little castor sugar, salt and pepper, and a very little mace. As soon as they begin to boil, cover the saucepan with a buttered paper and the lid; let them simmer until cooked. Take out the turnips; add a little gravy to what remains in the saucepan; boil up once or twice, and pour over the turnips.

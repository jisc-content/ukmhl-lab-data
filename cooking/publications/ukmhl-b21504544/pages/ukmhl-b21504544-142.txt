WHOLESOME COOKERY. 124 I 307.—Fried Oysters. Scald and beard the oysters; dip each separately in batter; drop them into boiling fat and fry crisp; drain them, and dish them up with fried parsley. They must be quite dry and crisp. 308.—Kromeskys. Mince some cold meats of any sort, and mushrooms, if you have them. Fry some onion slightly in butter, then toss in the mince for a couple of minutes; next moisten with gravy or stock; season with pepper and salt and minced parsley. Stew for a few minutes until it is in a tolerable paste; put it on one side to get cool. Cut up some slices of cooked bacon (rather fat)—the slices must be of the thinnest—place some of the savoury meat on each slice, roll them up neatly, and keep them in a cool place; then dip them in batter and fry them.

360 CHAPTER XI CAPSICUMS The capsicums or chilies used as a spice, either dried, pickled, or in the form of cayenne or red pepper, are the fruits of one or more species of the genus Capsicum, belonging to the order Solanaceae, and are originally natives of Central and South America, but now spread all over the warmer parts of the world. A considerable number of species, about fifty, have been described and named, but only three or four are of importance as spices or condiments, and the separation of these into species is not easy, as they are very closely allied and the forms appear to hybridise readily. It is pos- sible that the three or four forms commonly recognised as separate species may be only cultivated forms of one original wild plant. The three important species are: (1) Capsicum minimum, Roxb., bird pepper or bird’s-eye pepper; (2) C. frutescens, L., chilies or capsicums; (3) C. grossum, wild bell pepper or bull-nose pepper ; and of these there are a considerable number of forms, differing in shape and colour, of the pods cultivated in gardens in Europe as well as in various parts of the tropics. 1.

SPICES 350 CHAP. with a good draught of wind. The cardamoms took longer to dry than if they had been exposed to the sun, but there was no perceptible difference between them and the sun-dried ones. However, the sunlight would no doubt be of advantage to partly bleach the cardamoms and make them of an attractive colour. In case of sudden showers Owen suggests putting the drying trays on wooden rails 3 ft. above the ground and to have a tarpaulin covering which can be readily spread over them on the approach of rain. Formerly coffee planters used to have a somewhat similar apparatus for drying the coffee, which, however, was quicker and more convenient; the roofing was fastened to a frame which ran on wheels, and a simple push sent the roof quickly along so as to cover a whole row of trays at once. The Curing-house.â€”This is required in damp or dull weather. It is a simply constructed building of wood, roofed by the ordinary local thatch. Owen recommends that the walls be open, of louvre-boarding, or open trellis round the room, with plain shutters to close when the weather is rainy. Thus you get a free current of air when it is dry, and a protection from damp in the rain. It should have as many glazed windows as possible to admit the light. During wet weather one or two stoves, according to the size of the house and amount of the crop to be dried, are requisite. Owen suggests the connecting of the two stoves by a pipe traversing the room with one smoke pipe for the outlet of the smoke for the two stoves. This, of course, will economise the heat. He recommends trays of wire gauze, 24 meshes to the inch, but this is expensive. More usual are the ordinary trays of split bamboo, which, he suggests, should be partly covered with gunny bags, so as to prevent the seed falling through. This, however, I should say, would hardly be wanted, as it is easy in any Oriental village to get bamboo trays which are not

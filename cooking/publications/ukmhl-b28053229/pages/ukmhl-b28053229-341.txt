IX 323 LONG PEPPER to give an artificial strength to wines, beer, spirits, and vinegar. Though it is by no means an injurious drug, an Act was passed in the reign of George III. that no brewer or beer-dealer should have any Grains of Paradise in their possession, or use it in making beer, under a penalty of a fine of £200, and any druggist selling it to a brewer was fined £500. The use of it is not, however, so great nowadays as it was in medieval times, when it was one of the main exports from Western Africa. It is probable that then the shorter distance which it had to be conveyed, as compared with that of the black pepper of the Indian region, caused its trade to be so extensive, especially as from the same region Guinea pepper (Piper Clusii, DC.), was exported in some quan- tity, though it has long ago disappeared from our markets. Melegueta has, however, always held its own as an independent spice, and Queen Elizabeth is said to have been very partial to it. Cultivation.—I have no record of its cultivation commercially anywhere, but it could doubtless be easily cultivated in the same way as cardamoms, were there a sufficient demand for it. The wild plants, how- ever, seem sufficient to supply all that is needed for the trade.

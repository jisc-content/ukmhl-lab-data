It is advisable to support the leaf stalks with stakes to which they are attached with plantain bast, or some such fibre, in order to prevent their being beaten down by wind or rain, especially if the position is much exposed. In well sheltered spots this is less necessary. Weeding and Manuring.â€”There used to be, it appears, a popular idea that weeds did not grow under the shade of cardamoms, but, at least for the first year, some weeding is necessary. After the cardamom fields are well and densely grown, weeding becomes unnecessary, as the plants crowd out the weeds. Some amount of clearing up, removing dead stems, and weeding is usually required about the end of the second or third year. A single rhizome will produce as many as twenty stems or more, and these stems die after a few years, and are replaced by new ones. Manure does not seem to be often used anywhere, but in Bombay it is usual to give leaf-manure in March and April of each year, if the supply is abundant, but if not it is supplied every second year. There is little else to do besides keeping a look-out for pests and blights till the plants commence to fruit, which takes place in the first year after planting out, or about three years from seed. CROPPING The first crop is usually a small one, the second one a partial crop, and the third, that is five years after planting, a full crop. The smallness of the first crop is accounted for by several causes. The plants have not, by the third year, fully developed, and have only a few leafy stems. The supplies are not yet in bearing, and those that are fully developed for their age are more liable to the attacks of insects and other enemies. Probably, also, a large

xxv TURMERIC 437 chemistry of its colouring matter is to be found in Watt’s Dictionary. Medicine.—As a drug, turmeric is no longer used in European medicine, except as a colouring matter. It is extensively used in native medicine, especially in skin disease, and as a powder for sores among the Malays. Children with excessive perspiration are often covered with the powdered rhizomes used in much the same way as orris root is in England. Women after confinement are often rubbed all over with it, and it is used largely as a cosmetic. In Java, I have seen children on the way to a circumcision ceremony so coated with turmeric that they appeared entirely of a bright yellow colour, giving them a most extraordinary appearance. It is recommended both in India and Malaya for bruises, leech bites, and skin diseases, but so far as I have seen in the case of sores, with more injurious than beneficial effects. It is said to relieve pain in purulent conjunctivitis, and to be beneficial burnt as a fumigation in catarrh and hysteria, and as powder with alum is blown into the ear in chronic otorrhoea. OTHER SPECIES OF CURCUMA There are several other Curcumas which are more or less cultivated and also wild in India and the Malay region, and which are used for various purposes by the natives, chiefly as drugs, dyes, and as starch producers, but not as spices, and so need be no more than mentioned. Curcuma Amada, Roxb., mango ginger, is used in medicine and as a condiment and vegetable in Bengal. C. angustifolia, Roxb., East Indian arrowroot. Cultivated for its starch. C. aromatica, Salisb., yellow zedoary. Cochin turmeric, used as a dye and cosmetic and as a drug. C. coesia, Roxb., black zedoary. C. caulina, Gresham, and C. leucorrhizcc, Roxb., and other spices are used to make a form of arrowroot.

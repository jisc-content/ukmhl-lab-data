248 SPICES CHAP. the spikes. The spikes are small, I to 2 in. long, and densely crowded with fruit. The flowers are less than their diameter apart. The stamens are abundant, and the plant is very fruitful and flushes early. Intermediate forms between this and the other two forms occur. Mr. C. P. Kaunan Nair (in Tropical Agriculturist, June 1906, p. 562) describes four varieties cultivated in Malabar. Saclharana valli, a common form and a good cropper. Kallivcdli already described, the best kind. Utharam valli, easier to propagate than either of the preceding. It has thicker shoots, and broader leaves. The pepper- corns larger and lighter, and the yield small. jKoltavalli, so called because the stems interlace like a basket. It grows easily without care, but the yield is poor. Short-leaved pepper has light-coloured, uniform, short, broad, flat, oval leaves, 4 in. long, 2^ in. wide, with indistinct veins, the vines tending to high growth with a very large number of small spikes, all exactly of the same stage of maturity. The branches stick out and branch dichotomously. The whole vine has a thinly-clad appearance. The spikes are 2 to 3 in. long, very numerous, apparently without stamens. The plant cultivated in the Malay Peninsula and Borneo resembles the short-leaved pepper, as far as description goes, in many respects. It is not a tall pepper, and is only cultivated up to about 12 ft. height. The leaves are oval, or lanceolate, dark green with prominent nerves; the spikes numerous and short, not branched; the flowers about twice their length apart, fully hermaphrodite; the stamens in pairs or solitary on each side of the pistil; the fruit spikes full, the peppercorns not large. Some other forms are mentioned by Barber as occur- ring on the Madras estates, and two jungle peppers have found their way into the cultivated area. The bigberry, unisexual vines, as in most wild forms ; the females with small, dark green, flat, narrow, hard leaves, and hairy

VANILLA II 25 V. pompona is a native of Southern Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Surinam, Venezuela, and Trinidad, and has been cultivated in Martinique and Guadeloupe. The pods are thicker and more fleshy than those of V. planifolia, and fetch a lower price. HISTORY OF THE PLANT Vanilla was used by the Aztecs for flavouring chocolate before the discovery of America, and its use was adopted by the Spaniards. It was, according to Morren, brought to Europe about 1510, and first described by Hernandez in 1651, in the Rerum Medicarum Novae Hispanae Thesaurus. It was introduced into England in the beginning of the nineteenth century, it is said, by the Marquis of Blandford, and flowered and fruited in 1807. In 1812 plants from the gardens of the Right Hon. H. C. Greville were sent to Dr. Somme, Director of the Botanic Garden of Antwerp, who in 1819 sent two plants to Buitenzorg in Java, where one that had survived the voyage flowered in 1825, but did not fruit. Professor Charles Morren of Liege was the first to produce fruits in quantity, and proved that Vanilla planifolia was the true vanilla of commerce. He showed the method of fertilisation by hand, and suggested that vanilla might be readily cultivated in tropical countries. Vanilla cultivation on a systematic basis was intro- duced into Java by M. Teysmann, Director of the Botanic Gardens at Buitenzorg, in 1846. In Reunion cultivation commenced between 1850 and 1856, and in 1857, 1917 kilos were exported to France, increasing to 44,000 kilos in 1874, of the value of 4,098,600 francs. From Reunion it was introduced into Mauritius. It was also cultivated in Tahiti, Fiji, Zanzibar, and Java. The cultivation of vanilla soon became of great importance. In 1875 the British Consul at Reunion states in his Report (May 1, 1875):â€”

85 II VANILLA Reference is made to the American Pure Pood Law, which compels the makers of commodities for consumption to indicate, in a plain manner, whether their products are perfumed with vanilla or vanillin. It is interesting to note, in passing, that the follow- ing measures are proposed for the purpose of putting prices in the French vanilla market on the most satisfactory basis :— 1. A tax of 416 francs per kilogram (about (£7 :10s. per lb.) on vanillin. 2. Application of the adulteration laws to vanillin. 3.

Evidence as to the increased production of vanilla is also given in the Diplomatic and Consular Reports, No. 4243, Annual Series, Report for the Year 1908 on the Trade of Reunion.

Kilos. 1906- 1907 35,588 1907- 1908 48,865 1908- 1909 70,000 It is further stated that, of the last crop, 44 tons was exported up to February 26, 1909, when prices varied between 6s. 4d. and 9s. per lb. for first quality, and 3s. 2d. and 4s. 9d. for inferior quality. The final opinion given is : “ there has been a great over-produc- tion of vanilla during the last five or six years, and prices are likely to go still lower as new plantations come into bearing. The Semi-Annual Report of Schimmel and Co., dated October 1909, contains the following :— The French Government has received a memorial, containing 2500 signatures, from vanilla planters in the French colonies, urging the imposition of a sufficient excise duty upon vanillin to enable the vanilla producers, who describe themselves as

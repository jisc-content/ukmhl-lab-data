CHAPTER XII 384 CORIANDER, ETC. Coriander, the fruits of Corianclrum sativum, is a herbaceous annual belonging to the order Umbelliferae. It is apparently indigenous to the Mediterranean region and the Caucasus, and used to be cultivated in England, but is also largely cultivated in Northern India. It is an annual herb, with a slender, solid, smooth stem, 1 to 2 ft. high, corymbosely branched in the upper part. The lower leaves are pinnate, on long petioles with nearly sessile rounded leaflets, the margins crenate- serrate, the upper leaves finely cut, with narrow, linear lobes, bi- or tripinnate. The flowers are borne in umbels 1^ in. across, small, white or pink. The fruit is nearly globular, Â£ to in. long, with two slender spreading styles on a short process, the stylopod. They consist of two halves, the mericarps, which easily separate, and are very concave within, with primary ridges, sinuous, and larger, straight secondary ridges on the outside. They possess a peculiar flavour suggestive of bugs, due to the aromatic oil contained in them when unripe; when ripe and dry it has a more pleasant aromatic taste. The Bombay seeds (that is to say the fruit) are said to be larger and more elongate in shape than the European form.

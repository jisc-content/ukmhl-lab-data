SPICES 374 CHAP. allowed to lie in the sun for one day after being picked, in order to toughen the stems and prevent them break- ing during the process of curing. Stringing.—A common method Is to cut strings of strong smooth twine ft. long. Draw this through a needle about 10 in. long, which is often made of a bicycle spoke. Peppers having any break or blemish must be thrown away, as they would decay before drying properly. Of course, where there is an evaporator in use these can be saved. After the strings are full and tied they are hung on nails driven into a rough pole or other frame- work, standing about 6 ft. from the ground, and left until dry, or, if shelter is available, they may be moved before becoming fully dry and hung closely together under the shelter, but where there is a free current of air. Evaporating.—Many growers prefer evaporating instead of drying. The evaporators should be large enough, when the peppers are dried on strings, to hold not less than 500 strings. The usual plan is to have a furnace with several turns of 8 to 10 in. pipe in the basement, the peppers being placed in a second story over a very open floor, and with good ventilation. The temperature can be kept at 110° Fahr., and in this way the house can be refilled every four days. Yield and Price.—Both of these vary of course with the season, soil, and water-supply. Two hundred and fifty strings of 5 lbs. each is called a good paying crop, but with all things favourable, including a late warm season, as high as 400 strings or even 2,400 lbs. of dried pepper per acre may be grown. Prices range from 35 to 75 cents (American dollar) per string if sun-dried, and 7^ to 12^- cents per lb. if evaporated.

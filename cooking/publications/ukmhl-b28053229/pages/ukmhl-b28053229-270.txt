252 SPICES CHAP. of cloth, 5 pairs of gloves, 2 barrels of vinegar, and 10 lbs. of pepper, as a tribute at Christmas and Easter. Later, in parts of England pepper rents were estab- lished, by which the tenants had to supply their lord with a stated quantity of pepper, usually 1 lb. A peppererâ€™s guild existed in the time of Henry II. (1154 to 1189), the traders being known as Pepperers (Piperarii), or in French Poivriers or Pebrieres. This guild was later incorporated with the Grocers. The price of pepper was very high in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, being valued at Is. (equivalent to 8s. of modern times) per lb., and between 1250 and 1360 it rose to 2s. per lb. In France, in 1370, it cost 21 francs 30 cents, and in 1542, 11 francs per lb. The demand for this spice, and its costliness, were the main inducements to the Portuguese to seek for a sea passage to India. The Venetians and Genoese had practically a monopoly of the spice, but when the Portuguese found the sea route in 1498, the price of pepper fell, and in spite of the efforts of the Venetians to retain the traffic, it passed out of their hands into that of the Portuguese, who retained it till the seventeenth century. Under the Portuguese Malacca became the great emporium for pepper. The cultivation spread to the islands of the Malay Archipelago, and the trade on the Malabar coast fell off. When the Dutch got control of the Malay Islands, they attempted to control the export and cultivation as they did with the other Oriental spices, but pepper was cultivated to too large an extent in countries not controlled by them, to permit them to form a monopoly, as they could with nutmegs and cloves. In 1801, Mr. Hogendorp gives the following returns, from the head of the first commercial houses, of the amount of pepper procurable from the Malay region (Raffles, History of Java, vol. i. p. 238): Sumatra, Bencoolen, 1,200 tons per annum. Susu and Acheen, 2,000 tons. Palembang, 700 tons. Lampong, 500 tons. Malay Peninsula, Penang, 100 tons; Tringanu and

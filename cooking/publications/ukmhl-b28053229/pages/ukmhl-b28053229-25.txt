INTRODUCTION I 7 to an insufficient food supply, but it is also occasionally due to excessive exposure to heat and sunlight. The destruction or injury to the roots may be due to an underground fungus or to some insect such as the grub of a cockchafer biting through them; again, it may be due to their having reached poor soil, or having exhausted most of the accessible nutriment. The yellowing of the leaves is also noticeable in plants growing in water-logged soil. When a plant is weak from insufficient food it is much more liable to attacks from insects and fungi, and where a plant has been injured by a pest, it is advisable to manure it, so as to give it a fresh start and enable it to resist the attacks of the pest. In the case of turmeric and ginger, the yellowing of the leaf is a preliminary stage in the death of the leaf, and is one of the signs that the plant is passing into a resting stage. At this time the plant is ready for digging, and the yellowing is therefore a normal con- dition. INSECTICIDES Many different insecticides have been placed on the market by horticultural firms. In most of them the poisonous part consists of nicotine, or some form of arsenic. Nicotine solutions are prepared by soaking common or waste tobacco in water, enough being used to cover the tobacco. When the solution is of the colour of strong tea it is diluted and sprayed or watered over the plants. Usually, in the East at least, tobacco good enough for this purpose can be obtained cheaply. Arsenites of copper, Paris green and London purple are often used, but I think it is better to avoid them, as they are apt to burn the foliage, and there is a probable risk of poisoning from them. Kerosene emulsion is one of the best insecticides. It may be made with condensed or sour milk or with soap, the latter being more generally used.

283 PEPPERS VIII The difference in the length of time it takes to commence bearing in different places is due probably to the method of cultivation. Where the plant is allowed to grow 20 ft. up a betel-nut palm, it naturally takes longer to come into bearing than on the 8 or 10 ft. post of the Chinese. There are records of a plant bearing well at thirty years of age, but the cultivator may reckon the vine has lasted well if it lasts for twenty years in good bearing condition. Fruiting.â€”Pepper will commence to fruit as early as a year after planting, but it is not advisable to allow the flower-spikes to remain on so early. It is usual rather to wait till the vine is fully developed, in the second or third year. When the vine is fully grown it completely covers the stake, and is well provided with spikes covered entirely with closely appressed berries. The berries do not ripen all at once. At first dark green, they become yellow, and then red. When one or two are red on a spike it is plucked by hand. As the stakes are tall, the gatherer requires a step-ladder in order to reach the top of the vines. Ladders resting against the vine cannot be allowed, as they bruise and break the branches. The crop is collected in September and the following months till January in Sumatra, and in March or April in India. In most parts of the East there are two crops, the larger one in August or September, the smaller one in March and April, but frequently gathering goes on all the year round. Much depends on the season, abundance of rain, and sun. It is not uncommon to see flowers, half ripe and ripe berries on the vine at the same time. There is a considerable variation in the fullness of the spikes. In an ideal bunch the peppercorns are close pressed together, with no empty space between, and all the fruit full-sized or nearly so, and all approxi- mately of the same developmental stage. The irregular ripening of the fruit prevents their all being actually

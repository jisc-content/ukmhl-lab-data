SPICES 264 CHAt. removed. This was the season of ploughing and padi-planting, or, as will be inferred, the commencement of the rainy season, and as the catkins or flower spikes are borne in the axils of new growths, the vines would not be over-shaded in the growing season. The Chinese in the south of the peninsula do not use shade trees, but it must be remembered that the dry season in Siam is much longer and more marked than it is in the south of the peninsula. But even here a light shade is certainly good for the pepper, as is shown by the fact that it is necessary to throw waste gambir leaves or cut grass over the pepper roots during a dry spell to protect them from the great heat of the sun. The mengkudu tree is a comparatively small one, and never attains the bulk of an Erythrina. It is a native of the Malay region, occurring commonly round villages in a semi-wild condition. Its roots were formerly used for a red or red-brown dye, obtained from the bark of the larger roots. In Sir William Hunter’s account of pepper cultiva- tion in Penang in 1803, given as an appendix, he says that the Chinese planters say that the pepper on Erythrina lasts longer than that on Morinda and gives some evidence to show the superiority of the former. Erythrina certainly has the advantage of rapid growth, and is easy to handle. It is also obtainable all over the tropics and can be had in quantities. It grows readily from seed, but it is for the purpose of pepper-growing best propagated from cuttings. These cuttings should be stout boughs cut into pieces, 3 ft. or more long, and about 2 in. through. One good-sized Erythrina will supply a considerable number, enough for 1 acre or 2 at least. Its main objections seem to me its smoothness of bark which the pepper cannot always grip firmly, and its liability to die from wound fungi. In Planting Opinion, 1899, p. 689, “Producer writes:—“ Till some fifteen years ago pepper was

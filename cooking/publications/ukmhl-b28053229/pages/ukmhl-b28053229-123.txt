Ill 105 NUTMEGS AND MACE nutmeg and clove plantations, the limit is reached at under 1000 ft., above which the tree will not grow. The highest point of Great Banda is 1500 ft. CLIMATE It is commonly said that nutmegs must be able to smell the sea, and cloves must see it, and it is certain that if proximity to the sea is not altogether essential for the success of the cultivation, there have been very few, if any, really successful plantations of nutmegs at any distance from the sea. It will be noticed that all the great cultivations of this plant have been on islands, viz. the Moluccas, Penang, Grenada, and Trinidad, while attempts to cultivate the plant far inland never seem to have been attended with much success. With regard to temperature, Dr. Oxley gives the temperature of Banda as ranging from 76° to 86" Fahr. in the south-east monsoon, and from 80 to 92° in the north-west monsoon. In the Straits Settlements the temperature is rather less regular, ranging from 64" to 93°, with an average of 79° for Penang, and 81 for Province Wellesley. The temperature of Trinidad is given as from 7 5° to 90°. Rainfall.—The rainfall of Banda is described as similar to that of the Straits Settlements, that is to say, from about 87 to 142 in. per year. This rain is constant, and there is no dry period. Occasionally, in the Straits Settlements, a month or even two may occur with very little or no rain, but this is not a constant occurrence, and usually there is a little rain every day, with heavier storms at the break of the monsoon. In Penang there is distinctly more of a trace of a dry season than there is in Singapore, and farther north in the Lankawi Islands, within sight of Penang, it is still more marked. A little drying of the air in the months of June and July does not seem to hurt the tree, even if grown with full exposure, as in Penang

The cultivation soon increased, and continued a prominent feature of the country till about 1896, when, partly from the low price, and partly from the exhaustion of firewood for cooking the gambir, and making burnt earth for the pepper, and also of suitable timber for pepper posts, both the gambir and pepper plantations dwindled away, and in 1906 hardly one was left. During this period, the area under pepper and gambir was very large, and almost the whole of the original forest of the island was destroyed to make way for the two plants. After the abandonment of the ground, it became covered with lalang grass, and eventually with secondary scrub, and was valueless for many years. The cultivation was carried on exclusively by Chinese, and the pepper was grown more as an adjunct to gambir than as an independent crop. Singapore has for many years been the great emporium for pepper. In 1872, 25,000,000 lbs. was imported into England from Singapore and Penang, while British India sent only 256,000 lbs.; and in 1877, 26,500,000 lbs. was exported. Most of the white pepper in trade comes from Rhio and the Straits Settlements. The following are the trade figures given to me by Mr. W. C. Kiln, the Registrar of Imports and Exports of Singapore, since 1875, for each fifth year :â€” Imports White Pepper. Value. Black Pepper.

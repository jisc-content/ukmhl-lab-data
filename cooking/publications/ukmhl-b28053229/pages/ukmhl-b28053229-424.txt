SPICES 40G OHA P. The rhizomes, on examination by Mr. Howard, showed dark areas containing the mycelium of a fungus with numerous chlamydospores, frequently arranged in chains, as occurs in Allantospora radicicola, a sugar- cane disease in Java, to which this fungus appears to be allied. The disease is due to this fungus, which travels underground by means of rhizomorphs, or black mycelial strands. The rhizomes are filled with this mycelium, which collects in strands, and spreads to other roots through the ground. The ginger growers carefully dig out affected plants and those next to them, even if they look healthy, and destroy them. It is recommended to wash the rhizomes thoroughly in clean water, and steep them for half an hour in Bordeaux mixture before planting them. This treatment has proved very successful in the case of sugar-cane cuttings liable to the attack of a similar fungus. A cemented tank was made and partially filled with a rather weak solution of Bordeaux mixture, and into this the cuttings were thrown for some hours, after which they were planted. The same might be done with any underground stems liable to fungus attacks, such as ginger. Infected ground should be treated with lime, or a light dressing of sulphate of iron. This disease spreads rapidly, and if neglected a whole patch may be destroyed. Cork-rot.â€”This is another disease met with in Jamaica. Its origin appears to be unknown. The rhizomes when dug up are found to be corky in texture, and valueless. One planter stated that out of a crop estimated to yield fifty to sixty barrels of ginger, he only got five barrels of healthy rhizomes, the rest being spoiled by cork-rot. Dried ginger, like many other products, is liable to the attack of the drug-store beetle, Sitodrepa panicea. This is a very small and destructive insect, about y\y in. long, light brown in colour, and covered with a greyish

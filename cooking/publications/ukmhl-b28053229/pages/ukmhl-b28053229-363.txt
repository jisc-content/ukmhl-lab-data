X CARDAMOMS 345 shoots and stems must be pulled off, but this does not amount to a very large percentage. It would of course be much easier to cut the racemes off, and clip the ripe fruits off afterwards, but by this means a great deal is wasted, as the unripe fruit on the raceme has to be thrown away. A good coolie accustomed to the work can pick from 12 to 15 lbs. of fruit a day, but 8 to 10 lbs. is the average picking. PESTS The Cardamom Butterfly (Lampides elpis, Godart). —A complete account of this the worst pesfc of the cardamom plant is given in Indian Museum Notes, vol. i. p. 11, from observations made by Mr. T. C. Owen in the notes on cardamom cultivation, and from letters by Mr. E. Green. Mr. Owen writes :— Of the enemies which attack cardamoms the most serious is an insect which bores a circular hole in the capsules, and clears out the inside. Young plantations seem more liable to this pest than older ones. In the former case as much as 80 to 90 per cent will sometimes be attacked and destroyed in this way: proximity to patana seems also the cause of increased liability to these attacks. Applications of lime, wood ash, or anything of a like nature are said to be beneficial. Mr. Owen was unable to discover what the insect was that caused the damage, but Mr. Green succeeded in finding an adult larva in one capsule, and bred it out into the beautiful little blue butterfly, Lampides elpis, a very common insect over the Indo-Malayan region, occurring in India, Ceylon, Burma, the Malay Peninsula and Islands. The male butterfly is about 1^ in. across the wings, of a pale metallic azure blue on the upper side, with a narrow black border to both wings ; the hind wings have sometimes a series of black marginal spots, and there is always a short, black tail with a white tip near the anal extremity.

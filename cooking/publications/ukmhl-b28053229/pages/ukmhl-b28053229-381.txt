363 CAPSICUMS XI pepper (a spherical fruit, extremely hot), bull-nose, sweet mountain, monstrous Spanish, mammoth, red tomato, all not or hardly at all pungent, and consequently seldom if ever used as a spice. I have, however, seen a cold cayenne pepper made from this form, which had a very pleasant flavour, and might find a market as a condiment. It is probable that C. grossum is only a highly culti- vated form of annuum. It is, however, given in many books as a distinct species, as is the hot flavoured cherry capsicum, under the name of C. cerasiocarpum, which is generally now considered a variety of C. grossum. HISTORY There is no doubt that all the species of capsicum were originally natives of Central and South America and the West Indies, although the plants are now spread widely over the whole world except the colder regions. The earliest mention of this spice is found in a letter written by Chanca, physician to the fleet of Columbus, in his second voyage, to the Chapter of Seville in 1494. He says that the natives of Hispaniola (Mexico) live on a root called “Age” (yam), which they season with a spice named “ Agi,” also eaten with fish and meat. This “ Agi ” signifies capsicums, and is still the common name in Spanish. It was later described by Fernandez (Historia cle las Indias, i. p. 275) in 1514. A plant so easy of transport by seed was not long in reaching the East Indies, and thence was carried to Europe. Fuchs, in the Historia stirpium, fol. 733 (1542), describes and figures it as Siliquastrum, or Calicut pepper, brought from India into Germany a few years before. Clusius states that the plant was brought from Pernambuco by the Portuguese, and cultivated in Castile and Moravia abundantly in 1585. Garcia da Orta, 1593, writes: “This capsicum or Indian pepper (rather American pepper) is diligently cultivated all over Castile by gardeners, as also by women in hanging

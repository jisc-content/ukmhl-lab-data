It is, however, advisable in any case to keep the ground clear of weeds around the young plants, and to see that climbers do not strangle them, and that they get sufficient light. Hart recommends weeding up to the twentieth year, and after that considers it unneces- sary. A good deal has been written, of late, as to the effects of the poisons excreted by grass roots (the root- toxins) on other plants grown in the same soil. A good deal more research is wanted in this direction, but even if the root-toxins did delay the growth or injure the tree to some extent, the injury caused by rain-wash and denudation of the soil, and exposure of the young roots to the excessive heat of the sun, cannot be ignored, and the question resolves itself into the choice of two evils. If clean weeding is practised the weeds should not be removed from the ground, as that entails a loss of potash, sodium, and nitrogen, which will have to be replaced in the form of manure. They should be rotted down in a pit, with dead leaves, sticks, etc., and re- applied to the tree as a mulch, or they may be burnt and the ash utilised. Manuring.—In 1860, when the great collapse of the nutmeg plantations occurred in the Straits Settlements, the cause of the disease was attributed by Mr. Jos4 d’Almeida, in Collingwood’s article, to over-manuring. The trees were said to have been unnaturally forced by digging trenches too closely around the spongioles (i.e. the young root-ends), and by too rich and long continued manuring, by which heavy crops had been obtained, but which at last exhausted the trees. To a certain extent this was corroborated by the fact that in Penang, where the planters were rich and could afford much manure, the destruction when the disease came was more complete than in the plantations of the poorer owners in Malacca. This, however, had probably little to do with the

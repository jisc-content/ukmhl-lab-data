438 SPICES CHAP. ZEDOARY Zedoary, the rhizomes of Curcuma Zedoa/ria, is one oi those spices which attained its greatest popularity in medieval times, but practically dropped out of commerce many years ago. It is still, however, cultivated by natives of the East Indies, and used in curry powder, as well as medicines. The plant is a very handsome one, and to some extent resembles turmeric, but is larger. The leaves are produced in a tuft, and are about 18 in. tall and 6 in. wide, erect, oblong, ovate, acuminate, bright green, with a slash of purple brown colour running up the centre. The flower-spike appears from outside the leaves, and with them or frequently alone after the leaves have withered. It is borne on a stout peduncle 18 in. long, and has the form of a cylindrical cone, 6 in. long, of spreading bracts. The lower bracts on the spike are bright green tipped with pink, gradually passing upwards into deep crimson ones forming the top of the spike. The flowers, of which there are four to each bract, are pale yellow, and produce one or two at a time on the spike. The rhizome is large, fleshy, and rounded, like that of turmeric, and bears also oblong, rounded tubers, wdiitish orange to orange inside, less brilliantly coloured than turmeric, and often nearly white. They possess a distinct aromatic taste, not, however, very strong, and not at all pungent. Cultivation.—The plant is grown in just the same way as turmeric, but is even stronger in growth. It is even found growing in abandoned cultivations covered with the rank Lalang grass (Imperata cylindrica), having persisted and thriven long after the cultivation has been abandoned. Use.—Zedoary is more used as a drug than as a spice, even in the East, and as a perfume. There seems to be somewhat of a trade in it in America, as it is quoted in the Midland Druggist of Columbus, Ohio,

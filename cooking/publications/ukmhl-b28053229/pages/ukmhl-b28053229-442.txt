SPICES 424 CHAP. in Tamil; Katha, Cingalese ; Kunyet in Malay, Kuong- huyuh in Cochin-China, and Kiang-hoang in Chinese. The English word turmeric is of unknown deriva- tion, and the old word for it, terra-merita, seems rather to be derived from it. From the Arabic Kurkum, we get the Latin Curcuma. HISTORY Turmeric does not seem to have been known as early as ginger, and never ranked in importance as high as that spice, being chiefly valued for its colour. Dioscorides, a.d. 77 or 78, mentions a kind of “cyperus” which resembles ginger, but when chewed has a yellow colour and bitter taste,—doubtless turmeric. Marco Polo men- tions it as occurring at Koncha (the neighbourhood of Fokien, in China) in 1280, describing it thus: “There is also a vegetable which has all the properties of true Saffron, as well the smell as the colour, and yet it is not really Saffron. It is held in great estimation, and being an ingredient in all their dishes, it bears on that account a high price.” This could only refer to turmeric, though it is used more as a dye-stuff in China nowadays than a spice. In medieval times it was commonly known as Indian Saffron (crocus indicus), by which Latin name Garcia da Orta mentions it. He states that in his time much was produced in Cananor and Calicut, and a small quantity from Goa. Great plenty was imported by the Arabs, Persians, and Turks, who obtained it from India. VARIETIES There does not seem to be much variation in the plant or its produce. In the trade, however, it is dis- tinguished into China, Madras, Bengal, and Cochin. China turmeric is the most esteemed, but is seldom to be met with in the market. Madras and Bengal are the ordinary trade turmerics. Cochin turmeric does not appear to belong to Curcuma longa at all, but to be the produce of C. aromatica.

135 Ill NUTMEGS AND MACE moulds. This is found on both surfaces of the leaf in the form of more or less rounded patches, which may run together, covering the leaf to a considerable extent. In the one which occurs on the nutmeg, the black mycelium forms a much-branched network, and has a knotted appearance under the lens, caused by an abundance of short rounded branchlets. The fruit generally found towards the centre of the mycelium patch is in the form of minute globular sessile balls. A very similar plant grows on Stephanotis. These soot-moulds are usually stated to occur only on the excreta of one of the coccids, or scale-'insects, and to be harmless to the plant. In the case of the one on the nutmeg leaves, I have found no trace of insects on the leaves at all. Eutypa erumpens, Massee.â€”This fungus is reported as causing the death of nutmeg trees as well as cocos and other trees in Trinidad and Grenada. It is probably a wound parasite. It forms irregular black patches on the bark, varying in size from \ in. to 2 in. across. The patches have a dull rough surface, in which the perithecia of fungus are sunken, and only the ostioles project; they are short and beak-shaped. The asci are club-shaped, 8-spored, and borne on long stalks. The spores are unicellular and transparent {Bull. Agric., Trinidad, 1909, p. 61 ; West Indian Bulletin, x. 3, p. 243). The Eutypas have a habit of not appearing in the fruiting stage until after the tree is quite dead, sometimes not for a week or more. Nothing can be done when a tree trunk is badly attacked to save it, but the disease should not be allowed to spread by having dead trunks or branches about the estate, so that the fungus can develop its spores and infect other plants. All dead wood should be removed and burnt. FRUIT GANGRENE This disease of the nutmeg fruit is due to a fungus which attacks the husk and produces an opening of

302 SPICES CHAJ*. could easily be grown successfully. Formerly it was extensively cultivated in Zanzibar, and in one of the consular reports (undated), quoted in the book All about Spices, we read that in one year 315,000 lbs. were grown, valued at 36,000 dollars. Later falls in price seem to have caused the abandonment of its cultivation, for Mr. Lyne, in July 1909, writes me, “ Pepper is here, but not cultivated.” West Indies and South America.—Though no doubt pepper could be grown well and productively in the New World, very little has ever been done in its cultivation there. Mr. Hart writes (Kew Bulletin, 1894, 79) that the pepper in Trinidad gave a good crop, and a crop of 200 lbs. was harvested from some vines giving 2 lbs. each. Messrs. W. and D. Harvest report on the sample that it was clean and bold, and resembled the better qualities of Tellicherry black pepper, except that it had rather more husk. The value at the date at which it was prepared was 2f d. to 2^d. per lb. ; but the markets were then depreciated and an immense stock had been received from the Straits Settlements. A short time previously the Trinidad sample would have fetched 5d. to 5|-d. per lb. In Jamaica, pepper plants fruited in 1897 for the first time, but only two plants (Jamaica Bulletin, December 1897). There seems to have been some difficulty about the plant in Jamaica. Plants and seeds of good strains were sent from the Singapore Botanic Gardens on several occasions, but they never appear to have done well. USES OF PEPPER The use of pepper as a spice or condiment for flavouring dates from very early times. Its strong pungency and stimulative action on the digestive organs made it very much in demand for cookery. Black pepper is more pungent, and contains more of the

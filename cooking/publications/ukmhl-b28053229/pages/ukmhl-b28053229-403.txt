385 CHAI>. XII CORIANDER, ETC. under the name of Kustumburu. It is also mentioned in the Bible as resembling the manna (Exodus and Numbers). It is mentioned, too, by Cato in the third century, and Pliny states that the best came in his time from Egypt. It has been cultivated to a larger or smaller extent in Europe, North Africa, and India ever since. The name Coriander is derived from the Greek Coris, a bug, from its odour. In England, the farmers formerly called it Col. In India it is Dlianya, in Hindu, Danga (Nepal), Kuzbardh, Kurbuzah (Arabic), Kotamalli (Tamil), Naunau (Burma), Jintan (Malay). USES Coriander, as a spice, forms an important ingredient in curry powder, and there is a very large trade in it in the East. It is also used in confectionery, and in flavouring gin and other spirits. In medicine, it is carminative and stimulant, and used in dyspepsia and colic by natives, and also in veterinary medicine. Its chief part in European medicine is to disguise the taste of unpleasant drugs, and it is used as a constituent of syrup of senna among other medicines. The leaves are used by the Chinese cooks in Singa- pore and elsewhere for flavouring soups, and as a sumbul in curries. The oil is obtained by crushing the fruits between rollers and distilling with water. It is pale yellow or colourless. The fruits chiefly used are from Russia, Moravia, and Thuringia. These give '08 to 1 per cent of oil. The oil must be obtained from ripe fruit, or it has an unpleasant bug-like taste and smell. The exhausted and dried fruit, after extracting the oil, is used as a cattle food (Volatile Oils, Gildemeister and Hoffmann). 2 c

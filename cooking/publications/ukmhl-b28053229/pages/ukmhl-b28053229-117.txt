Ill 99 NUTMEGS AND MACE NAMES OF THE PLANT AND ITS PRODUCTS The nutmeg is known in France as Noix Muscade; in Germany as Muskatnuss. In Malay, Pala; Bali, Pa.

HISTORY Nutmeg and mace do not appear to have been known to the Greeks and Romans, though von Martius (Flora Braziliensis, fasc. 11, 12, 133) maintains that it was alluded to in the Comedies of Plautus. The words macer, macar, or machir found in the works of Dioscorides, Galen, and Pliny evidently do not refer to mace, but to the bark of a tree, probably Ailantus malabaricus of Malabar. These spices, however, were imported from the East Indies by the Arabian traders in early days, and Aetius, resident at the court of Constantinople about a.d. 540, mentions Nuces Indicae among other aromatics, such as cloves, costus, and spike- nard, as an ingredient of the Suffumigium moschatum. Masudi, who visited India in a.d. 916-920, pointed out that the nutmeg, like cloves and sandal-wood, was obtained from the eastern islands of the Malay Archi- pelago, and about the thirteenth century the Arabian writer Kaswini identified the Moluccas as the source of the nutmeg. The first record of nutmegs in Europe is in a poem written about 1195 by Petrus Dâ€™Ebulo, describing how at the entry of the Emperor Henry VI. into Rome, before his coronation, the streets were fumigated with nutmegs and other aromatics. By the end of the twelfth century the spices were both well known in Europe, but very costly, for it is recorded that about 1284, 1 lb. of mace cost 4s. 7d. the value then of three sheep, or half as much as a cow.

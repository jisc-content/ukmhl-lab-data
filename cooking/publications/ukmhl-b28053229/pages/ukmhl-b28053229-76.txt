58 SPICES CHAP. folded over all, and the lid put on. The boxes are put into halves of wine-barrels, which are filled with water up to the lids of the boxes, care being taken that no water gets into the boxes. The barrel is then covered with a piece of sacking and left for the night. Next morning the pods are taken out and exposed to the air to dry, and then for two or three days kept under woollen coverings in full sunlight. Now the pods are ready for the drying process, which is effected by the use of closed boxes of galvanised iron containing chloride of calcium. The boxes are 1 metre square, with a hinged door, closing on an india- rubber edging to ensure air-tightness. Each box has eleven trays. In the sixth tray and on the bottom of the box are placed 18 kilos of calcium chloride. The rest of the trays contain 45 kilos of vanilla. The trays should not be made of resinous or strong-smelling wood, as vanilla absorbs and retains odours it meets with. The bottom of the tray is made of split rattan in the form of a hurdle. Several layers of vanilla are placed in each tray. The calcium chloride is put in double- bottomed vessels, the inner one perforated to allow the escape of the liquid calcium chloride. Whenever the boxes are opened the chloride is examined and replaced or added to, as may be required. The doors are hermetically closed. The vanilla is examined every two or three days, and damp pods removed and put aside to be sunned. In twenty-five or thirty days the pods will be sufficiently dry. After being taken out of the box the vanilla is put on frames in a covered, well ventilated place for several days, and then transferred to tin boxes, each containing 15 to 20 kilos. There it remains for several weeks, being examined every few days, and any pods showing mildew are carefully wiped. When it is thought that it has reached perfection and the perfume is well developed, it undergoes a treat- ment to remove any dust and spores of mildew upon it.

Kelway Bamber (Agricultural Bulletin of Straits Settlements, vol. vii. p. 581). In these stiff clay soils, weak in potash, manuring is absolutely essential, and the Chinese use burnt earth, which has been already described, and which is rich in potash. Poor, however, as this class of soil is, some of the best pepper in the world has been grown on very similar soils. The fine pepper grown at Kamuning Estate, in Perak, was cultivated in a considerably richer soil—old forest humus, rich in lime from the neighbour- ing limestone rocks. But such soil cannot always be met with. Where virgin jungle is procurable, the soil is naturally richer and should be used, and in abandoned plantations which have become covered with secondary scrub of from three to ten years’ growth, the plantation may be successfully made. The ground is cleared, the forest felled, and when the brushwood and branches are dry they are set on fire, and when thoroughly burnt, the pepper is planted. Such ground has, in addition to the humus, the potash, carbon, etc., of the burnt forest, and this is very suitable for the pepper. Owing, however, to the heavy rains, much of the soluble constituents of the soil, as well as the finer particles, are soon washed out, and manuring in these soils (as treated of later) becomes absolutely essential. According to Marsden, in Sumatra pepper throve

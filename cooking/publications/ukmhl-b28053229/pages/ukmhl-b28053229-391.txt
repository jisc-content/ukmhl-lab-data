„ CAPSICUMS 373 account of cultivation of capsicums in California, thus :— 1. How Plants are Grown.—A hot-bed is made by excavating about 16 in. deep, fill in to within 4 in. of the top with stable manure, tramping down very solidly. Spread about 4 in. of sandy loam over the manure. The seed is sown quite thickly over the loam, and then about ^ in. of loose sandy soil placed evenly over it, and all kept damp. When the plants have two or three leaves, thin to 1| in. each way. The plants must be watered while in the hot-bed by sprinkling. Soil and Preparation.—Rich sandy soil is the best for the chili pepper. It should be ploughed deeply, and be put in a state of thorough cultivation. Ridges should be made 3 ft. apart, and the plants set ft. apart on the ridges. All plants should be on a water- line, and to get this the ridges should be made high enough to let the water run down the furrows and the plants placed about 2 in. above the water-mark. This ensures every plant receiving water when irrigated. Plant as soon as danger from frost is past. Cultivation.—Frequent cultivation is necessary until the plants get too large to allow of a cultivator and horse passing between the furrows. All weeds should be pulled out. When the plants are set as above noted all the ridge will be on one side. This must be worked down with a cultivator, and then a plough used to throw earth on either side of the furrow, so that the plants will be midway on the ridge. Irrigation.—While the plants are small, water will be needed about once in twenty days, but as they get larger it will be required as often as once a week, though always in small quantities. The plants seem to have no deep roots, consequently the surface soil must be kept damp. Picking.—The field should be gone over about once a week after the peppers begin to ripen, all that are fully ripe being taken off. Great care must be taken to pick all the stalks with the pepper. They should be

CHAP. XII SPICES ,‘388 Cumin seed was well known to the ancients, and is mentioned by Isaiah. It is exported to Europe from Morocco, Sicily, Bombay, and Calcutta. It is cultivated in India in the same way as coriander and dill, as a field crop. It is used, as above stated, as an ingredient in curry, and also to a certain extent in native medicine. It seems to have gone out of European medicine, being replaced by caraway seed, which has a more agreeable flavour. The oil has an aromatic, bug-like taste. East Indian cumin gives 3 to 3‘5 per cent on distillation.

21 I INTRODUCTION Second Year Upkeep ........ $7,500 This upkeep will be continuous annually till the seventh year, but the cost of weeding will be less after three or four years. To these expenses must be added cost of land, survey fees, etc. When the crop begins to come in, buildings for stores, drying sheds, etc., will have to be provided. This rough estimate would do also for cloves, cinnamon, pepper, and plants of that nature, subject to a few alterations due to differences in cultural methods. The cost of felling and burning naturally varies according to the class of jungle to be cleared, whether it be heavy forest or secondary scrub, or grass and fern, the former being the most expensive. Nowadays, with a view to avoiding injury from fungi attacking the young trees, it is customary to root out all stumps and roots which are liable to harbour parasitic fungi. This is expensive, but it generally pays in the long run. Figures for forming estimates for field and garden crops are given under their respective chapters. The races which supply the coolie labour of the tropics are the Tamils (natives of southern India), Javanese, Chinese, and Negroes; Papuans and Anna- mites are used in their respective countries. This labour is comparatively cheap ; white labour in the hot parts of Australia costing about eight times as much, and it is on the cheapness of black labour that many of these cultivations depend. Much of the work, such as felling and burning, is given out on contract. Literature General Ferguson, A. All About Spices. Watts, Dr. Dictionary of Economic Products of India. Simmonds.

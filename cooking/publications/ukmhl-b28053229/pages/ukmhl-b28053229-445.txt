TURMERIC XIV 427 according to some accounts, 1 ft. to 2 ft. wide. One foot apart is, however, quite enough for the ridges in ordinary circumstances, but where irrigation between the rows is necessary it would be advisable to make them wider. The rhizomes are set about 1 ft. apart, in holes dug for the purpose, and are covered with soil from 4 to 6 in. deep. In dry places and seasons watering is required at first, and often even later, e.g. in the North-west Provinces as often as once a week. The amount of sets required is variously given as 900 sets, or three maunds (250 lbs.) to the acre. The returns are given as from 2,000 to 5,000 lbs. of fresh rhizomes per acre. In Coimbatore, a somewhat different system is adopted. The ridges are made 2 ft. apart, and the rhizomes are planted in June or July, at a cubit’s distance apart, and watered every three or four days from then to the end of December, and then less often to March and April, when they are dug up. Between the ridges or on different ridges other crops such as onions are grown, so as to shade and somewhat protect the plants. As a rule, turmeric is not grown more than once in three years, and is followed by rice or ragi (Eleusine coracana) (Watt’s Dictionary). During its growth weeding is more or less necessary, according to circumstances. The plants spring up in about a fortnight. The rhizomes are usually dug about a year later, or even less, generally between October and April of the following year, according to the date at which it is planted. In some parts of Bengal it is not considered good practice to lift the roots the first year, but they are kept growing for a year and nine months. It is said that the produce when raised the first year is less in quantity and inferior in quality than when it is left in the ground for a second season. In the Toungoo district, according to A. M. Sawyer, the rhizomes are selected for planting in January to

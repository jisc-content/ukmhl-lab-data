The natives attribute the inferiority of locally dried capsicums to the want of sufficient sun-heat, and say that they do not like artificially dried ones. India.â€”Chilies are grown in India extensively as a field crop, being grown in rotation with pulse seeds, oil seeds, or after potatoes. N. G-. Mukerji gives an account of their cultivation in his Handbook of Indian Agriculture. He says that sandy loam and newly formed alluvium on the banks of rivers do well for this crop, but dry rock soils containing plenty of lime produce the best crop. The seedlings are raised in nursery beds in a cool and shady spot. The soil is well pulverised, and rotted manure and lime and ashes applied. The seed is sown in May, and when the seedlings are 6 or 7 in. high, they are transplanted after a good shower of rain at a distance of 27 by 18 in. apart. This is done in July and August. The land for planting out is prepared very early in the season ; in December or January this is effected with the hoe, or by the local plough and grubber. The ground should be worked over by the grubber once a month till the planting season. The cultivation of field-crops in India is far more common and better understood than anywhere else in the tropics. The whole system is very different from anything in Ceylon and the Straits Settlements. It is done on a much larger scale, and as it has been pursued probably far longer than in any other part of the tropical East, the ground is in a more cultivated condition than else- where. The flat open plains ploughed over continu- ously for unknown generations can be more easily worked, and a larger series of agricultural implements

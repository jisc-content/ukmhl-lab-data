The Malays are acquainted with three forms, which they know as Halyia betul, Halyia bara or Halyia padi, and Halyia hudang. Halyia betul (true ginger) is the name given to a form with rather broader leaves and white flesh to the rhizome. It is taller also than the others. It is the one used for making sweetmeats, and also as an adjunct to curry. Halyia bara or Halyia padi (bara, hot coals ; padi, rice), on account of the hotter taste and narrower leaves, is a smaller plant with yellowish rhizome. This is a more pungent variety, and is used in medicines. Halyia hudang (prawn, i.e. red ginger) is a Sumatran variety used in medicine. It much resembles the last, but the base of the stem is redder. It is chiefly used in native medicines. In Jamaica the planter divides the plant into “ blue ” and “ yellow ” ginger, so called from the colour of the rhizome. The names “ turmeric ” ginger and “ flint ginger ” are also used for the yellow and blue respec- tively. The turmeric ginger must of course not be confused with the true turmeric. Kilmer states that he cannot distinguish between the plant producing blue and yellow ginger, and says that many intelligent planters are unable to distinguish them apart without inspecting the rhizomes. He suggests that the “ blue ginger ” is a degenerate form. The root of the blue ginger is hard and fibrous, yields a smaller proportion of powder, is less pungent, and less valuable commercially. In another part of his paper he talks of the better quality as “white ginger.” Yellow ginger of Jamaica has gradually, it appears, driven out the inferior blue ginger as being a more valuable kind, but where the ground is too poor to grow the best variety the in- ferior form may be grown. The blue kind seems to have been the first introduced into and cultivated in

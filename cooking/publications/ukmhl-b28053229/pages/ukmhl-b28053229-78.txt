SPICES GO £32 0 0 CHAP. from the trays and packed while hot into tins, old 40-lb. biscuit-tins being used. They remain in the tins lor two days, and are then spread out in the trays again, but alter the first sweating in the tins, must always be covered with blankets when exposed to the sun heat. During the sweating in the tins the pods exude much water. From this time onwards the processes are alternated, one day in the sun, one or two in the tins, till they are nearly dry. When they have begun to shrivel and become soft and pliant they can be left for a couple of weeks at a time in the tins, so long as they are air-tight or nearly so. The best pods take the longest time to dry, and the dry ones must be taken out each day before the exposure to the sun. When they are nearly dry they should never be exposed more than half a day at a time, and should be turned over at least twice, to prevent their being sun-burnt. They must never be spread singly in the trays, or the stalk end will burn. Another plan is to remove the pods when they have lost about half their weight, and are distinctly wrinkled, to frames covered with wire-cloth or thin sacking. These frames are put in a well-ventilated drying-house, and the pods are dried there. This plan is safer, but requires more house room. COST AND PROFIT Mr. Howard Newport, in the Queensland Agri- cultural Journal (May 1910), p. 239, gives an estimate for opening up a 5-acre plantation of vanilla in Queens- land.

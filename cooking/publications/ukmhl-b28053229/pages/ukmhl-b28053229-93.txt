75 II VANILLA and later a good deal was grown in European planta- tions, notably near Dumbara, where a native gardener, from a small vanillery, obtained pods to the value of £100 to £150 per year. The plant was introduced about 1853, or probably earlier, and both Dr. Thwaites and Dr. Trimen strongly urged its cultivation. Samples to the amount of 64 lb. were sent home in 1866 from the Peradeniya Gardens. In 1884, eight packages, valued at 1245 rupees, were sent to. England and Australia.

Malay Peninsula.—Both Vanilla planifolia and V pompona have been cultivated at the Botanic Gardens in Singapore, and good pods produced. The region, however, seems to be too wet for successful plantations. V. planifolia produces its fruit during the wettest part of the year, and when heavy rain-storms occur during the ripening period most of the pods fall. There have been no successful commercial plantations in Malaya. India.—Comparatively little seems ever to have been done in the cultivation of vanilla in India. Mr. A. J. B. Gisseleire, Superintendent of the Agri-Horti- cultural Society’s Gardens in Calcutta, in a paper quoted in Planting Opinion (June 16, 1900, p. 419), said that the cultivation of vanilla had been taken in hand more than once, but had never had a thorough trial. The experiment was not continued long enough, although it was shown that this plant grows and fruits in Bengal without any difficulty. “ The experiments in the Alipore Gardens have not been carried out on such an elaborate scale as was attempted in several places in Bengal some years ago; in fact, the plants

SPICES 392 CHAP. Sanskrit Sanjabil, through the Arabic ZanzabiL The Greeks and Romans appear to have obtained it from the Arab traders to the East, who doubtless brought it from India. Its original home is unknown, as no one seems ever to have met with it in a wild state anywhere, and it was very early distributed over tropical Asia, from India to China. The spice was well known in England before the Norman conquest, and in the thir- teenth and fourteenth centuries was nearly as common in trade as pepper, costing no more at that time, when spices were expensive luxuries, than Is. 7d. per lb., or about the price of a sheep. In the fourteenth century the Italians classified the spice in three forms :â€” 1. Belledi or Baladi, country or wild ginger. 2. Colombino, i.e. from Columbiun (Quilon, in Southern India). 3. Mecchins, i.e. imported through Mecca. Marco Polo is probably the first traveller who saw the plant alive, but he does not describe it (1280-1290). He met with it in China, Malabar, and Sumatra. It is first described by John of Montecorvino in 1292, and by the traveller Nicolas Conti. Preserved ginger in syrup, known as green ginger, was imported into Europe as a sweetmeat as early as the Middle Ages. As the rhizomes of ginger are very easily transported in a living state for considerable distances, it is not to be wondered at that the plant was introduced into America very soon after the first discovery of the New World, and before any other Oriental spice. It was brought to New Spain (Mexico) by Francisco de Mendoca, and the rhizomes were ex- ported from San Domingo as early as 1585, and from Barbados in 1694; and Renny (History of Jamaica) says that, in 1547, 22,053 cwts. were exported from Jamaica to Spain. Since that time Jamaica has been a continuous source of ginger, for which it has always been famous.

122 SPICES CJIAP. tiecs piove females, and there is no need for troubling about the comparatively few males. The Chinese in Penang and Province Wellesley cut down every pure male tree as soon as it is possible to distinguish the sex, so that the few bisexual trees they possess have to supply all the pollen for the females. In Malacca they leave the males, unless there are too many in the plantation, when they cut them out, and in any case do not waste any manure on them. Besides manuring, occasional pruning and destroying parasites and insect pests, and such weeding as is absolutely necessary, there is little for the planter to do till the trees begin to fruit, which is usually about the sixth year. GROWTH OF THE TREE The trees in Banda grown in rich soil and under shade attain a much greater height than those of the Straits Settlements grown in full sun and in poor soil. In Banda 50 or 60 ft. in height is not an uncommon size, and Dr. Oxley states that he saw some which he thought could not be less than 70 ft. tall. They commence to fruit generally in the eighth or ninth year, and are not considered in their prime until they are about twenty- five years old. They are said to bear well up to sixty years, and even longer. The male tree is said to be shorter lived than the female. In Penang, on the other hand, the trees are much shorter, usually about 20 to 25 ft. tall, bushy and com- pact. Old trees grown in shade have often a wide spread, but they do not attain any great height. They commence to fruit between the fifth and sixth years, occasionally earlier, but many (and this is preferred) only commence to fruit in the eighth or ninth year. They are at their best in fifteen years, and fruit well for ten or twenty years more. Thus the whole life history is shorter in the Straits Settlements than in the Moluccas. This is presumably due to the somewhat unnatural method in which the cultivation is carried on in the

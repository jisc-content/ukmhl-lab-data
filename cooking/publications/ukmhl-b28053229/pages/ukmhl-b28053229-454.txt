VALUES OF TURMERIC I he local values of fresh rhizomes in Singapore is from 6 to 10 dollars a picul, the usual price being about 6 dollars (the dollar is now valued at 2s. 4d., the picul is 133^ lbs.), or a little over 1 penny a pound.

A special variety is used in dyeing in India which has a harder rhizome than the aromatic one used as a spice. The colouring matter is only produced with age, and it is probable that the dye- yielding forms have been obtained by careful selection of hard, well-coloured rhizomes. The colour is rather fugitive, especially in the presence of sunlight and when acted on by alkalis, and the Malays say that the dye from Zedoary (Curcuma Zedoaria) is preferable as being much more durable. It seems, however, to be still used in India commonly for dyeing calico and paper. The colouring matter is known to chemists as Curcumin. A good account of its properties as a dye and the

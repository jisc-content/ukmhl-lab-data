SPICES 148 CHAP- USES Mace is chiefly used as a spice, occasionally only in medicine, and then more as a flavouring agent. It contains about 8 '2 per cent of a volatile oil, consisting for the most part of macene. The oil is colourless and very fragrant, and is quite unlike that of the nutmeg seed. The percentage of oil varies in different samples. It is given as 6^ per cent (Herrings and Co.), 8*2 per cent (Fluckiger and Hanbury), and as much as 11 and 16 per cent by Schimmel. There is always a good demand for it, and it usuallv costs more per pound than the nutmeg itself. THE NUTMEG The husk and mace having been removed, the seed in its thin, brittle outer coat, the testa, is to be dried, to be prepared for export as the nutmeg of commerce,, and after drying the testa is to be removed before pack- ing. The testa is not broken off till the seed is dry, or it would run a great risk of being attacked by beetles. The seeds are often merely dried in the sun, being exposed in trays of basket-work every day till quite dry. But in Banda and other places, where large quantities of nutmegs are handled at one time, fire is used to dry them. The nuts are spread on gratings about 8 ft. above a slow charcoal fire, in a drying-house built for the purpose, and exposed to the fire for from six weeks to two months. Dr. Oxley preferred to have the stages 10 ft. above the fire, and urges that it is best to commence by drying the seeds at first by exposure to sun heat for an hour or two a day in the morning, and gradually increasing the length of the exposure, till in eight or ten days they rattle in the shell, and then transfer them to the drying-house to be finished. Care must be taken not to raise the temperature too high, or the seed will shrivel and be less valued by the dealers.

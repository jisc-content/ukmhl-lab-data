SPICES 440 CHAV. 86lJ to 885. In a list of produce from a country he called “ Sila ’ (probably China), he mentions galangal. Edrisi, in 1153, mentions it among the productions of the Far East brought from India and China to Aden, the port then used lor Asiatic produce coming to Egypt and Europe. Garcia da Orta says it was unknown to the ancient Greeks, and only imperfectly to the Arabs. He distinguishes between the greater and the lesser galangal, giving the correct Malay name Lancuas (Lankwas) to the former. Marco Polo mentions it as produced in abundance at Kachanfu (near the Hoang-ho), at Kinsai (Tokien), and Kuelin-fu (Kien-ning-fu) in the same province. It was imported very early into England with pepper and other spices, and is often mentioned in the literature of the Middle Ages. It was then mainly used as the culinary spice. In England it was called galingale, a name which has also been applied to the sedge, Cyperus longus. Cultivation and Use.—The plant seems never to have been cultivated elsewhere than in Southern China. Like all plants of the ginger tribe, it is easily propagated from portions of the rhizome. The commercial spice consists of pieces of the rhizome 1-^ to 3 in. long, rarely f in. through, and commonly much less, brown, cylindric, often branched, and marked with the rings left by the fall of the scale leaves. It is dry and firm, tough and shrivelled, rather paler inside (but never white, or buff colour, as in the greater galangal), with a darker central column. It is aromatic and spicy, somewhat pungent in taste.

The odour is due to the essential oil. This oil is a greenish yellow, slightly viscid liquid of a camphor-like odour. Its only known constituent is Cineol. Oil of galangal was manufactured very early, and is

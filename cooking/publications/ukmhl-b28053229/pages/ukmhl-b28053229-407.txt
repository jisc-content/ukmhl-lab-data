CHAPTER XIII 389 GINGER The ginger is a herbaceous perennial plant, belonging to the order Scitamineae, and known as Zingiber officinale, Roscoe. It possesses a white, pungently aromatic rhizome, covered with scale leaves, which emits at intervals leafy stems, usually about 2 ft. tall, and rather slender, and covered with the sheaths of the leaves. The blades of the leaf are lanceolate acuminate, ending in a long point, light green and herbaceous, about 6 in. long and f in. wide. The inflorescence is normally borne on a separate stem rising directly from the rhizome, but occasionally is found terminating a leafy stem. It is in the form of a cylindrical cone of bracts, about 3 in. long, pale green, and borne on a peduncle about 1 ft. tall. From between the bracts appear at intervals, usually one or two at a time, thin, yellowish white flowers, with a black and yellow marbled lip. The stamen projects over the lip, and has an oblong, yellowish white anther, terminated by a long white horn, the connective. The style, which runs up through the anther, is slender and filiform, with a small round stigma. The fruit, which is very rarely produced, is in the form of a thin-walled capsule containing a number of small, black, angled seeds.

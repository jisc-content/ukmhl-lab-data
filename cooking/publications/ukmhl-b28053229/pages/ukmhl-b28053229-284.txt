SPICES 266 CHAP. these are not always procurable and it is not uncommon for the posts to fall when loaded with a well developed vine. The Dutch sometimes cultivate the pepper on trellises, but these are even more liable to decay and require constant renewing in a hot damp country where termites and fungi very quickly destroy any but the hardest woods. On the whole, the stout hardwood stakes of the Chinese planter are, if procurable, the most convenient supports. This system, however, presupposes the existence of an accessible forest "with suitable trees, which is not always at hand, and the exhaustion of the suitable timber near the plantations was given by the Chinese as one of the causes of the abandonment of the cultivation in Singapore in 1896. It must also be pointed out that the posts practically give no shade to the roots of the pepper, at least at first. The Chinese obviate this by covering the ground between the posts with cut lalang-grass and refuse, gambir leaves, etc. Growth.—As the vine ascends the post or tree, it is tied with a soft bast or twine. When it reaches the top it has been the custom to pull it down, and wind it round the base of the support, when it throws out more shoots, which climbing to the top cover it with a dense bushy mass. Some pull down the vines thus more than once. The prostrate portion of the vine round the base of the support is covered with soil to induce growth of the ascending shoots. This method was in vogue among the Achinese, and also formerly among the Chinese, but the latter have abandoned the method in Borneo, according to Mr. Dalton in Mr. Hewitt’s paper above referred to. They now allow three shoots to climb up the post, tying them at every internode. If a single stem only rises to the top of the support, it requires to be cut back or pulled down, so as to cause it to branch heavily, as a good pepper plant should completely cover the post with a dense mass of stems and branches.

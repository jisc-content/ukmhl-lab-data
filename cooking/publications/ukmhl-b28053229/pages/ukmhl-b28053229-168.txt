150 SPICES (Hi Y. Dr. Oxley says they are packed in wooden bins filled up with lime and water to the consistency of mortar. The nutmegs remain in the bins, which are carefully closed, for three months. After this they are taken out, sorted into grades, and packed in the teak casks. In the Malay Peninsula liming has never, I believe, been resorted to, and indeed with reasonable care to keep the store-rooms free of the godown pests, it is hardly necessary. There are a number of beetles which attack nutmegs when stored in the godown. These beetles deposit their eggs in the seed, and the larvae bore holes in it, destroying it or at least reducing its value considerably. Mr. Hart, in a circular note published in Trinidad, gives a list of those found in godowns there destroying the nutmegs. They are all very small, the largest, Trogosita mauritanica, being only § in. long. They are— Trogosita mauritanica, Lam. Tribolium ferrugineum, Fabr. Carpophilus sp. Loemophloes sp. Hypotliemenus sp. Lasioderma sp., near if not identical with L. testaceum, the too well known cigar-beetle. Mr. Blandford, who identified them, thiuks that the first two are probably the really injurious kinds. All are well-known godown pests, destroying flour, meal, and all kinds of warehouse goods. In the account given by Mr. Hart, he states that imported horse and cattle food had been stored in a room which adjoined the one in which the nutmegs were kept, and the beetles were probably brought in with this food. Grain and beans are very liable to the attacks of these little pests, and should be kept away from the nutmegs as much as possible. Should the godown be infested with these insects, it should be thoroughly cleaned, and white-washed internally to get rid of them. Sorting.—Nutmegs are valued according to size. The largest are about 1 in. long and 4 in. in diameter, O w

I 9 INTRODUCTION one most regularly used by the Chinese, in the Malay Peninsula, for treating their vegetable and other erops. The plant known as tuba (Derris elliptica) is a woody climber propagated by cuttings. It will grow in any corner of the garden and soon develops into a fairly large mass of stems, lying on the ground. The roots are pounded up in water and the decoction poured or sprayed over the crop, where it will kill all cater- pillars, grasshoppers, and other insects. It is perfectly harmless to any plants. The decoction is poisonous to human beings, but only when taken in large quantities, and risk from it in the case of any of our spice plants is infinitesimal. The best of all these is the preparation known as Bordeaux mixture. This consists of a mixture of copper sulphate and lime in water. The best formula is :— No estate should be unprovided with a bag or two of copper sulphate in case of an outbreak of any kind of fungus. I have arrested many outbreaks of different kinds of fungi on roots, stems, and leaves of plants by the use of this excellent mixture. It is sometimes complained that under certain circumstances it burns the leaves of young plants. I have never seen this occur. A very complete account of the making and use of Bordeaux mixture was published by Mr. E. S. Salmon in the Journal of the Board of Agriculture, vol. xvi. No. 10. I reprint the following extracts from his article :— In purchasing copper sulphate, an article of 98 per cent purity should be demanded; substance described as “ agricultural FUNGICIDES Copper sulphate (bluestone) Quicklime (in lumps) Water .... 50 gallons. 4 lb. 4 lb.

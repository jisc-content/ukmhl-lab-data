291 PEPPERS VIII REGIONS OF PEPPER CULTIVATION India.—The pepper plant being indigenous to the Malabar coast, was first cultivated and exported thence, and that in very early times. From this region it gradually spread over other parts of Asia, but at what dates is not clear. From the earliest recorded times till the fifteenth century at least, the greater part of the spice in the markets of the world was derived from the west coast of India. The whole of this region, from Cape Comorin to Kanara, was the pepper-country for many centuries, producing not only the greatest amount, but also the spice of the highest reputation. Nearly all the pepper was shipped at Madras, being conveyed there by the coasting trade from the various centres of cultivation. The development of the industry in Sumatra, the Straits Settlements, and Cambodia, however, broke through the monopoly of the trade possessed by India, and the exports diminished materially. In 1829, Milburn reports (quoted in the Dictionary of Economic Products of India) that while the produce of Sumatra was estimated at 168,000 piculs, that of the islands south of Sumatra 12,000 piculs, of the Malay Peninsula 28,000, the Gulf of Siam 60,000 piculs, and Borneo 20,000 piculs, that of India was only 30,000 piculs; and in 1872, out of 27,576,710 lbs. imported into England, 25,000,000 lbs. came from the Straits Settle- ments, and only 256,000 lbs. from India; and in 1889, the total imports into England from the whole of the British East Indies being 28,555,304 lbs., 28,041,096 lbs. came from the Straits Settlements. The Indian trade, however, increased largely in recent years, as the follow- ing tables show, taken in quinquennial periods :— 1875-1876 to 1879-1880 . . . 5,420,963 lbs. 1880-1881 to 1884-1885 . . . 5,061,098 „ 1885-1886 to 1889-1890 . . . 7,652,334 „ A considerable quantity of pepper was imported into India from the Straits Settlements, Java, etc., in

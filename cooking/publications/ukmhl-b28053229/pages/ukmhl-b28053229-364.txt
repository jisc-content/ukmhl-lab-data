34G SPICES CHAP. % The female is dull (not metallic) bluish white on the upper side, the outer black borders much broader, and the black spots on the lower wings considerably more prominent. The under side in both sexes is pale brownish, crossed by numerous more or less broken prominent white lines. It is very abundant in the cardamom fields, and at low elevations flies all the year round, and there is probably a constant succession of broods. The female probably lays its eggs on the flower buds of the cardamoms (as an allied fruit-eating blue butter- fly does), and after a few days the larvae commence to burrow into the young fruit and to devour the centre. The full-grown caterpillar is described by Mr. Green as â€¢55 in. long, dull pale green, tinged with red on the dorsal area, with three reddish dorsal stripes, minute black spiracles and a small brown head retracted beneath the second segment. The chrysalis is smooth, pale, dull yellowish brown, marbled and spotted with darker brown, the spots coalescing into three irregular dorsal stripes. The caterpillar before pupating leaves the fruit, cutting a large round hole in the side. Otherwise, it does not leave the fruit it commenced on unless it some- how becomes unsuitable, when it would seek a fresh one and bore into that. The caterpillar probably pupates among the leaves and dead stalks. The allied butterflies, however, pass the pupa stage in the fruits. Mr. Green estimates the destruction to be ordinarily from 5 to 10 per cent of the capsules. Mr. Owen, as mentioned above, says that sometimes 80 to 90 per cent of the capsules are destroyed. There is considerable difficulty in dealing with a pest of this nature. Mr. De Niceville, in the Indian Museum Notes, suggests that small boys should be employed with butterfly nets to catch the insects, and should be able to secure the greater part of them in a plantation. The destruction of the gravid females would check the injury very largely.

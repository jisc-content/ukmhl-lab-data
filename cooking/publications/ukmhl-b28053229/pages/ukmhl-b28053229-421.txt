XIII GINGER 403 They are then dried in the sun for eight days, and again shaken in the basket, and after two daysâ€™ more drying are ready for sale. The shaking in the basket is to remove the skin and scales. In Bombay the rhizomes are rubbed with tiles to remove the skin, and then baked and dried in the sun.

It is usual for the most skilful peelers to peel between the toes, the easier sides of the rhizomes being done by children or less experienced persons.

The water acquires a slimy feeling, and if concentrated becomes mucilaginous, and acquires a warm and aromatic taste.

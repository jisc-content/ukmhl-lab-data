SPICES 228 CHAP. stout short style and a small bilobed stigma. The fruit resembles that of the true cinnamon, but is rather smaller. It is black, pulpy, and aromatic, elliptic in outline, and seated in a cup lobed at the edge, the remains of the perianth. It contains a single seed. The flowers are fertilised by flies chiefly, and the seed is dispersed by birds, which swallow the pulpy fruit as soon as it is ripe. The dried fruits are known as Cassia buds. HISTORY Cassia has been known from the earliest times as a spice. It is mentioned constantly in the Bible, and by many of the early Creek authors, and in Chinese herbals as early as 2700 B.c. A great part of this early recorded bark was undoubtedly the Chinese Cassia, especially as the Arabian and Persian name for the bark is Darctcliini, from Dar, wood, and Chini, Chinese. At the same time the Indian Tamala, or Tajpat, and the Malay barks may have been also among the oriental imports into Europe and Arabia under the name of Cassia. The origin of the Chinese bark, however, was un- known till 1882. Mr. Ford, Superintendent of the Botanical and Afforestation Department of Hongkong, made an expedition to the West river, Canton province, to report on the cultivation of the plant. His account was published in a Report to the Hongkong Govern- ment, and also in the Linnean Society's Journal, vol. xx. p. 19, by Mr. (now Sir) W. Thiselton Dyer, in a note on the origin of Cassia lignea. Cassia was known in Western Europe as early as the seventh century, and is mentioned in medical books in England before the Norman conquest. It was sold as Canel in England in 1264 at lOd. per lb., and in the fifteenth century was mentioned in the Boke of Nurture, by John Russell, as resembling cinnamon, but being in- ferior.

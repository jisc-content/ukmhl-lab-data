Another method sometimes used is to employ a thin flat stick and to press the rostellum upwards beneath the anther cup, pressing this with the thumb so as Vanilla Fertilisation. A.

This method, however, is not so satisfactory as the° first one. It is rougher and perhaps easier to effect, but there is a certain amount of uncertainty as to whether the pollen has quite reached the stigma and is well inside.

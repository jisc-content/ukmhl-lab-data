158 SPICES r.UKV. flower consists of a cylindric thick ovary, \ in. long, above which are four fleshy ovate sepals, and above this the four white rounded petals which form a ball in the bud and fall off when the flower opens, displaying a very large number of slender stamens, in the midst of which is the slender style. After fertilisation by some insect the stamens and style fall off, and the lower part of the flower, with the calyx, develops into a fleshy, dark-pink, one-seeded drupe, about 1 in. long and in. through in the thickest part, with a narrow base dilated upwards, obovate in outline. The sepals are reduced to short, fleshy triangular points. The seed is oblong, § in. long, rather soft in texture, and grooved on one side. Rumphius (Herbarium Amboinense, vol. ii. p. 1) describes three forms of clove plants. The first has the buds hardly red when ripe; the second, called bugu lawan kiri, is smaller and red when ripe, and chiefly occurs in Hitoe and Ley Timor ; the third form is hardly red when fit for gathering, and the fruit is white,—this he calls female cloves. HISTORY The clove tree appears to be indigenous only to a small number of islands in the Moluccas, namely, Tidore, Ternate, Mortir, Machian, and Batchian, volcanic islands in the neighbourhood of Gilolo. It does not, however, appear to be wild in the last mentioned island. The earliest record of this spice is in Chinese books dating from 266 B.c. to 220 B.c., wherein officers of the court are required to hold cloves in their mouths when addressing their Sovereign. A spice which was probably cloves is mentioned by Pliny as occurring in India, and resembling pepper- corns, but longer and more fragile, and called Caryo- phyllum. The Greek word caryophyllon is supposed to be derived from caryon (a nut) and phyllon (leaf), and to refer to the ball-like mass of petals and stamens which terminate the bud; but as the word is

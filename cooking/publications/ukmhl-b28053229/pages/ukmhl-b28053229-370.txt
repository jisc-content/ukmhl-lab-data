352 SPICES CHAP. In Coorg the cardamoms are either merely exposed to the sun on mats or trays, or dried over a slow fire. The oven is a long brick and mud structure, the roof of which is either fiat and formed of zinc sheeting, or a hollow trough. The fruit is spread out over° the oven to dry, after which the stalks are cut off and the fruit is ready for sale. The Hindus pickle the green fruit and use it in confectionery dried. (Evers in Agricultural Journal of India, iv., 1909, p. 104.) BLEACHING The light bright colour of good cardamoms is obtained by some process of bleaching. This is not a very elaborate process in Ceylon. The capsules are there treated by sprinkling them with water, or dipping them and exposing them immediately to the full sun. This increases the amount of split fruit considerably, and Owen affirms that in good sunny weather a very good colour is obtained without any bleaching process. A correspondent of the Observer recommends steep- ing the fruit in boiling water for a minute before drying, but this bleaches the fruit excessively, more than would be appreciated by the London brokers. In India the natives have an elaborate process of bleaching which is described by E. Cozanne (Mollison, “ Lesser Cardamom in the Bombay Presidency ”). A large earthenware jar is filled with water, into which is put 2 lbs. of pounded soap-nuts, Sajnndus saponaria, and ^ lb. of the pods of Acacia concinna, to 5 gallons of water. This soap mixture is sufficient for 130 lbs. of cardamoms. Another jar contains a strong solution of common soap in water. Two women seated place an earthenware pan before them, into which they put 8 quarts of water and 3 quarts of the soap-nut mixture. Then 10 lbs. of cardamoms are put into the tub, and the women stir it vigorously with the hand for one minute, rest for a minute, and stir it again. The cardamoms are now baled out and put into a basket to drain. They

SPICES 232 CHAP. OIL Mr. V. Cayla, in the Journal d’agriculture tropiccde, (June 30, 1909, p. 164), gives some further account of the Chinese cassia under the name of Le Gannelier. He says : “ All parts of the plant—bark, flowers, branches, peduncles, and leaves—produce essences of which the properties are nearly exactly the same, and the cinnamic aldehyde (which ought to compose 73 to 90 per cent of the essence) varies but little. The essence distilled and exported to Hongkong from China usually comes from a mixture of these parts. “ A great deal of the Chinese cinnamon comes as bark to Canton, whence it is shipped to Europe. “ The leaves are chiefly used for distilling, flowers and peduncles are not separately collected, and the bark detached goes in with the leaves. “ The still used consists of a metallic recipient fixed in a brick furnace for boiling the water; a cylinder half full of leaves and branches stands above the receptacle; all is covered with a cap of a special form, furnished at the base with a pipe in which is collected the essence, afterwards cooled by passing through receptacles arranged in stages. With more care im- provements could be made on the Chinese method and product. The receptacle is often made of lead, which has this disadvantage, that some of the cinnamic aldehyde becomes acidified and acts on the lead, forming cinnamate of lead, which makes it necessary for the extract to be purified before its use in pharmacy.” The Chinese adulterate the oil with cedar-wood oil and other similar oils, and for ten years used a mixture of resin and petroleum, which was detected at length by Schimmel Bros.’ firm. The adulterated essence pre- served the density of the pure essence, but possessed a disagreeable odour. It would, of course, be easy to procure nowadays cheap and convenient iron or copper stills, such as are used for citronella and lemon-grass distillation, and make a good pure extract of cassia.

CAPSICUMS XI 379 of being soft they are firm, and eventually develop pustules white or pinkish in colour, turning black. A somewhat similar fungus I have also met with in Chinese gardens in Singapore. It appears as an oval or circular blotch gradually spreading, at first of a black colour, but as the tissue is destroyed becoming brown and dry with a black margin. The epidermis is cracked and pushed up, and the whole pericarp is affected and dies; eventually the fruit shrinks and withers up. This fungus the Chinese say is worse in wet weather, and causes a considerable loss. I have not seen the fruit of it, so am unable to identify it. The treatment recommended is spraying with copper carbonate solution or potassium sulphide. Copper sulphate might also be used in the form of Bordeaux mixture. The Chinese leave the infected fruits on the plant, or merely throw them on the ground. They should be collected and destroyed. Mukerji states that in India chilies are very subject to fungoid diseases, but less so to those of insects, and mentions two fungus diseases by local names, Dolbhanga- rog and Kutelaga, no description of which is given, and I am unable to find any identification of them, but of these he says : “ When these overtake a crop it is not feasible to stop them. In fact, chili cultivation has to be given up for two years successively in a locality affected by either of these diseases before it can be taken up again. Bordeaux mixture and invigorating manures have been used in vain.” CAYENNE PEPPER Cayenne pepper is the finely ground powder of chilies. The kind generally used is the bird’s-eye chili, and this is the source of the Japan and Zanzibar cayenne pepper. Nepal cayenne pepper, remarkable for its violet odour, is made from a small variety of Capsicum annuum. Its colour is not bright red as is the case in Japanese, but brownish. A condiment, sold

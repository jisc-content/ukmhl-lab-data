The nuts were few and inferior in quality, notwithstanding every necessary care was bestowed on their cultivation. In 1883 as much as 230 acres of nutmegs were returned in the Ceylon Directory as cultivated. , The tree is recorded, however, as bearing freely in Ratnapura, and seems, by Dr. Trimen’s Report, to have done well at Peradeniya. One writer in the Ceylon Observer mentions the failure of trees at Gala from their being planted “ kabook,” which is, I believe, a Ceylon term for laterite soil, in which they do very well in the Malay Peninsula. There seems, however, to have been at this time an idea in Ceylon that manuring was fatal to the tree, and possibly want of manure had much to do with this failure. The cultivation seems by now to have quite died out. Indeed, it was always more of an experimental than a practical cultivation in Ceylon. In Africa the nutmeg was introduced into Zanzibar by Sultan Sayyed, but though it grows well it is not extensively cultivated. It bears freely, I learn from Mr. Lyne. It has been also introduced from time to time into West Africa, but no cultivation of any importance has been made there. In Mauritius and in Bourbon it has received more attention, and in 1864 2500 kilograms of nutmegs and 4500 kilograms of mace were exported from Bourbon. In 1865 only 1365 kilo- grams of mace and nutmegs were obtained, and still less in 1871, after which the cultivation was abandoned.1 In South America.—Poivre sent it to Cayenne in 1772, and it was cultivated to a small extent from 1832 to 1836, but the greatest output was only 200 kilograms in 1835, after which the cultivation dwindled away. It was a long time ago introduced into Brazil, British and Dutch Guiana, but no extensive cultivation has ever taken place in any of these places. 1 Simmons, Tropical Agriculture.

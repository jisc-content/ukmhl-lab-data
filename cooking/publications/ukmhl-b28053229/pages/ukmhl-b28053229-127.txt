NUTMEGS AND MACE Ill 109 of bamboo pots lies in the facility with which the young plants can be transported to any part of the estate with a minimum of risk. I never think, however, that plants grow as well in bamboo pots as they do in a nursery bed. Conical baskets of split rattan are better for this kind of work. Sowing seed at stake is occasionally practised, but is hardly to be recommended. If it is found more convenient to do so, two seeds should be put in each hole, and after germination the weaker plant should be removed. Sexes of the Plant.â€”The nutmeg tree is normally monoecious, that is to say, is either male, bearing only male flowers, or female, bearing only female ones, and it is stated by some that the males never become females, nor the females males. It is, however, often stated that male trees have been known to produce at first a few, and later all female flowers in from two to six years. There are, however, also trees which produce both kinds of flowers at the same time, and these are known, according to Rumphius, as Boy-trees (Pala boi) in Amboyna. The origin of this name is unknown. Dr. Oxley seems to have considered that these hermaphrodite trees are inferior, as they have a tendency to produce double nuts, and the nuts themselves are inferior in quality and quantity. Janse, in the Annals of the Buitenzorg Gardens, 1904, in treating of double and triple nuts, says that the hermaphrodite trees bear more or fewer nuts each year, that a large percentage of these have double or triple nuts, and that such nuts are not produced at all by female trees. Dr. Oxley states that the female flowers of weakly trees (by which he seems to mean hermaphrodite trees) are entirely yellow instead of being of a greenish colour at the base, and are im- perfectly urceolate, approaching in form more nearly to the staminiferous flowers of the male trees. I cannot say that I have noticed this, nor do I find

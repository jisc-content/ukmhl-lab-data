20 SPICES CHAP. Agriculture, like everything else, has no code of rules, and it is impossible to lay down strict laws for every local condition. A successful planter is one who is always studying and learning, often inventing simple little improvements which save cost and time or increase the value of his product. ESTIMATES In a book written for use in all parts of the world it is difficult to give estimates of cost and profit which can be strictly depended upon for all countries. Expenses vary in different places and at different times. It is only possible to give a general idea as to costs subject to local conditions. The cost of land, the expensiveness of labour vary in different places, and either may rise in countries undergoing development. A sample of expenses likely to be incurred, say, in opening up an estate of nutmeg trees, from high forest, is here given, modified from H. C. Belfield’s Handbook of the Federated Malay States.

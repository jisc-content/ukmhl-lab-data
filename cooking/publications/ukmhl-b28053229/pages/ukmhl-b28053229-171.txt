NUTMEGS AND MACE Ill 153 This substance is used for certain soaps, and as an outward application for rheumatism and sprains, and is an important ingredient in pitch plaster and other similar plasters. It has a certain amount of acridity, and will blister the skin after being rubbed in for some time. The field for nutmegs as a spice is much larger than that as a material for oil, and the suggestion to make the oil and ship it from the West Indies, instead of the nutmeg itself, would hardly be worth trying. Messrs. Schimmel, in their semi-annual Report for October 1909, state, “ the nutmeg oil remans unchanged at low prices. There has been no lack of cheap nutmegs suitable for distilling.” OTHER SPECIES OF NUTMEGS There are several species of wild nutmegs in India, the seeds of which are used chiefly for oils and soaps. My ristica canarica, Bedd., has a small seed like a marble, about 1 to 1| in. long. It is a native of Southern India. The seeds are only used in making locally used candles. M. malabccrica, Lam., has an oblong, tawny and hairy seed, longer than the true nutmeg, and as broad. The seed is 1L in. long and | in. through. The shell is black and wrinkled longitudinally, and the kernel is full of a red oily juice. The seeds are only used for the oil, made into an ointment for ulcers and rheumatism, and as an adulterant for the true nutmeg. The aril is also used for adulterating mace, and is known as Bombay mace. It is deficient in the aromatic essential oil. M. Bicuhyba, Schott., and M. officmalis, Mart., and M. sebifera, Sw., from Brazil; M. Otoba, IT. B. K. of New Granada ; M. guatemalensis, of Guatemala ; M. surina- mensis, of West Indies; M. ctngolensis, Welw., of Gaboon; and M. laurifolia, of Ceylon and Malaya, have all been utilised as vegetable - fat producers. They have no value as spice, however, as they are usually deficient in myristicin.1 1 D. Hooper, Agricultural Ledger, 1907, 3.

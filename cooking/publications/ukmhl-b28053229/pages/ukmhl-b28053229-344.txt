326 SPICES CHAP. Its most remarkable feature is that the racemes instead of spreading over the surface of the ground are borne perpendicularly from the bulbs, and the fruit grows in clusters of five and seven. This form is best suited for growth at higher elevation than the Malabar, and stands exposure and wind better. The value of the produce is not less than that of Malabar. The best figure I have seen of the plant is the original one in White’s Malabar Cardamom; there is also a tolerably good coloured figure in Trimen’s Medical Botany, but the figure in Schumann’s Zingiberaceae published in the “ Pfianzenreich ” is hardly recognisable. Schumann distinguishes the forms above described, viz. the varieties majus and minus, as species, which I think can hardly be maintained. There is also a photograph of the plant in the Journal of the Horticultural Society, vol. xxxviii. fig. 137. HISTORY There was a spice known to the Greeks and Romans as cardamomum and amomum, but it appears to be certain that these spice plants, whatever they were, were not the cardamoms of the present day, although the name of this spice, as we know it, is evidently taken from these words. The spice was known to Indian and Arabic writers in very early times. The Indian writer Susruta (about the eighth century) mentions it under the Sanskrit name Eta, which with variants is the prevailing name over India and Arabia, and it is mentioned in the list of spices liable to duty at Alexandria in a.d. 176-180. It was mentioned by Edrisi as a production of Ceylon about a.d. 1154, and was probably a trade spice in Europe long before that, though there is no definite record of it. Marco Polo does not mention it in his travels. Barbosa, the Portuguese traveller, mentions it as a product of Malabar coast in 1514. Linschoten mentions both the lesser and greater cardamom as used in Southern India. Of the former he writes : “It most

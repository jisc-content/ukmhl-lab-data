PEPPERS 243 VIII Barber’s description of the fertilisation, as observed in India, is as follows : — Each new leaf is followed by a spike in the pepper at the flowering time, the spike arising at the same joint as the leaf, but on the opposite side. In the course of a few weeks the spike is seen to be elongated, and to be covered with the little, white, starlike stigmas. These are very delicate, and in the continued showers become covered with the wandering pollen from more advanced spikes. A further lengthening will then show the stigmas faded and the small pollen-sacs peeping out on each side of the ovaries, ready to burst and scatter their pollen to other later flowers. According to this view of the fertilisation of the pepper flowers, a long hot spell after the monsoon’s commencement would cause the stigmas to dry up before fertilisation could be effected, and many spikes would drop off, for any unfertilised flower is quickly thrown off by plants. The life of the male element is short. On the other hand, a succession of short spells of rain and sunshine would be beneficial, since sunshine is necessary for the growth of the leaves and especially for the maturing of the fruits. It is probable too, that very heavy rainfalls, especially on plants not sufficiently densely grown, would be injurious by washing away the pollen. VARIETIES OF PEPPER The pepper cultivated in the Malay Peninsula is, so far as I have seen, of one variety only. It is the variety from which the above description of the pepper plant is taken. It possesses deep green leaves with strongly marked veins and straight edges. The leaves are not as large as in the big forms of Southern India, and the spikes are not very large, but the plants are always hermaphrodite with plenty of stamens, so that they are heavy fruiters, and in good strong plants the spikes contain a fruit for every flower. The peppercorns when dried are not as big as in some other varieties,

278 SPICES CHAP. blackened, and the blackening extends to the stem. The fungus spreads rapidly through the tissues, most rapidly through the vessels, causing the appearance of black streaks outlining the affected parts of the vascular system. An abundance of gum or oil is formed, which further obstructs the water circulation. The pepper commences to die from the top, as is usually the case when the water-supply is cut off by root-death. After the fungus has developed luxuriantly in the tissues of the pepper, it begins to form spores. A brick-red efflorescence appears on the bark overlying the blackened streaks of the wood. This is composed of myriads of minute spores which easily separate and fall to the ground, or are blown by the wind far and wide, and thus may infect other plants. This is not the only form of reproduction possessed by this fungus, for there are no less than four ways in which it can reproduce. In one form it appears as small round bodies, bright red in colour, smaller than a pin-head. Within these are slender sacs containing eight spores each. One of these spores sown in water germinates and produces one or two long transparent threads which soon produce a small branched erect plant bearing balls of minute spores (the form known as Cephalosporium). Another form consists of spindle-shaped bodies, or appears in the form of cushions on the stem, forming the red patches on the withered vines (Fusarium form). In any of these forms the fungus can infect another vine and cause its death. Mr. E. J. Butler, in the Agricultural Journal of India, i. p. 31, gives a further account of the diseases of the pepper in Malabar. He says that the supports for pepper in the Wynaad are mostly jungle trees, that the nature of the standard does not appear to affect the disease, and that the worst destruction took place in the hills, though dead and dying plants were not infrequent in the plains. He gives the following account of the appearance of the sickness :â€”

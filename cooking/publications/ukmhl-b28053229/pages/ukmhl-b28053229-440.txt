The outside of the rhizome, which is usually rather closely ringed, is brown and scaly; the inside is of a bright orange colour, and possesses a very distinct odour and taste. The rhizome is the portion used as a spice, under the name of turmeric. The main part of the rhizome is known as long turmeric; the tuberous portions are known as round turmeric. The leaves are borne in a tuft, and are about 2 ft. tall, but frequently shorter. They are thin, rather flaccid, and light green in colour, lanceolate acuminate, with rather a long leaf-stalk.

The spikes are shorter than the leaves and supported by a stout peduncle. They consist of a great number of thin, greenish-white, ovate bracts, the uppermost ones being usually pink and rather longer than the lower ones. In each bract are

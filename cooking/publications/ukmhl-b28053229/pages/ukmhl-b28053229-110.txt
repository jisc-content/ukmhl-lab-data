92 SPICES CHAP. sapwood of certain pine trees. Since then a number of processes for the manufacture of artificial vanillin on a commercial scale have been devised. In 1891 be Laire commenced to work a process for forming it from eugenol, the substance to which oil of cloves owes its characteristic odour. This process was carried on from 1891 to 1896 without producing any material change in the price of natural vanilla, but in 1897 a period of competition set in between various continental firms, which resulted in the fall on the price of vanilla from £9 per lb. in 1890 to £1 : Is. per lb. in 1903. The vanillin being made from eugenol, the price of it depended on that of oil of cloves, from which the eugenol was obtained. But in 1891 a patent was taken out for making vanillin electrolytically from sugar. Vanilla, however, kept its price up to from 17s. to 19s. 6d. per lb. till November 1904, in spite of the fact that an equivalent amount of artificial vanillin could be purchased for a thirtieth part of the cost of the natural product. This was perhaps due partly to the conservatism of the consumers of vanilla, and partly due to an idea that there were other aromatic substances in the pods which were not in the artificial substance.1 The French vanilla-growers have formed a “ Ligue a la defense de la vanille,” and have attempted to obtain the passing of legislation to compel users of artificial vanillin to mark it on their products, and to tax the import of it into France. Although artificial vanilla is so much cheaper and can be put on the market at so much lower a figure, the cultivation of the real thing is by no means one of the past. Good vanilla is in request, and will probably always remain so, and though the large profits formerly made in this cultivation will probably not be obtained again, still it is well worthy of attention by the tropical planter, and if carefully managed should bring a good substantial profit. 1 Bulletin of the Imperial Institute, 1904.

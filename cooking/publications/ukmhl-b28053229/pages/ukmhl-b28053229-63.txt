VANILLA 45 II continuance of the disease depends entirely on the diseased dead leaves lying on the ground. In the Seychelles it was observed by the first reporter of the disease that it was confined to a certain area of flat, damp land, insufficiently drained, and during his experiments Mr. Massee found that the presence of an excess of moisture in the leaf favoured the develop- ment of the fungus. Macfarlane, too, in describing a very similar disease, observed that it was worst in rainy weather and in dense shade. Thus overcrowding and excessive dampness in the estate are things to be avoided. This disease has been seen in Mauritius, the Seychelles, Reunion, Antigua, New Granada, and apparently the same fungus in Tahiti, where also a fungus known as Colletotrichum Vanillae has been met with attacking the foliage. Calospora Vanillae has also been seen attacking other orchids, viz. Oncidiums and Dendrobiums at Kew. INSECT PESTS These are comparatively few. The most destructive one recorded is a bug, Trioza Litseae (Hemiptera, Psyllidae) recorded from Reunion. It seems first to have attacked an introduced tree, Litsea laurifolia, and later attacked the vanilla. It attacked the buds and flowers of the plants, puncturing them and pro- ducing spots of decay. When it attacked the column no fruit was produced. Another bug (Heteroptera), known as the emerald bug, Nezara smaragdula, a small grass-green insect occurring all over the world, lays its eggs on the leaves and stalks of the vanilla, and the insects when hatched suck the sap of the stalks and flower-buds. It is not as destructive as the previous insect. A moth caterpillar, Conchylia vanillana, attacks the rudiment of the young fruit after fertilisation, and if it does not cause the fruit to dry up, it produces

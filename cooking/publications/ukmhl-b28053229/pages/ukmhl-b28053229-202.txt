184 SPICES CHAP. Our heaviest day was November 24, when we picked 874 pishi with 135 men, an average of 6'4 pishi per head. At Dunga our average was much less, by reason of there being fewer cloves; besides, having to visit more trees the people never became so expert. Our best picker brought 6 and 7 pishi, while our average was between 3 and 4 pishi per diem. Approximate Yield per Tree.—The number of clove trees at Marseilles was stated to be 5,000, but on recounting we found there were 7,500 bearing trees at Marseilles and 1,000 at Kitumba—together 8,500. On December 31 we had gathered, approximately, 1,300 fraslas, and might, I think, safely count upon another 300, making a total of 1,600 fraslas. This gives an average yield of over 6J lbs. per tree. A good proportion, about was left upon the trees ungathered through lack of labour. With sufficient labour we should, I think, easily have reached 2,000 fraslas; the approximate yield per tree is, there- fore, brought up to over 8 lbs. The trees at Dunga were just as heavily laden with buds, but they never ripened properly; at least half the crop failed. We reached about 350 fraslas, which from 3,000 trees gives an average of 4 lbs. per tree. Returns.—Our actual sales at the end of December amounted to 873 fraslas, which realised 5,535 rupees, while we had on hand at the custom-house unsold and in the plantation godown an estimated quantity of 424 fraslas which, valued at the current rate at 5i rupees a frasla, was worth 2,332 rupees. Our gross returns up to December 31 may therefore be taken as R.7,867. Our expenditure to that date was 1,725 rupees, or about 22 per cent of the gross returns, and our net profit is shown as R.6,142. Account Statement to December 31 873 fraslas sold ......

The amount, 1,725 rupees, as the actual cost of gathering 1,297 fraslas, works out to 1 rupee 22 pice per frasla, and differs slightly from my first estimate of 1 rupee 13 pice. This dis-

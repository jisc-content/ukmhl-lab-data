IX 317 LONG PEPPER adult it flowers and fruits all the year round, and 30 or 40 spikes can be taken from one plant every few days. They are merely dried in the sun. The plant is figured, and some account of it is given by Rumphius in the Herbarium Amboinense, vol. v. p. 333, under the name of Piper longum. He states that it was abundant in his time in Java, Bali, and Uliasser, but only cultivated in a few gardens in Amboyna, and gives the well-known Malay name, Chabei, and also Lada padang, as used by Malays. The Amboinese word is Maritsja ammo or Marisa am mu. He states that it was cultivated on the stems of the tree Moringa (the Ben-nut), or on coco-nut trunks, but not on stakes as black pepper is. Natives of Java say, however, that they cultivate it on posts just as black pepper is grown. Miquel, Elustrationes Piperacearum (111. xxxix.), gives a good figure of it. The Javanese use it in curry and in native medicine. It is chiedy grown in Java, Bali, Rhio, and other islands. I cannot find that it has ever been cultivated in the Straits Settlements, though it is mentioned by Hunter in his Plants of Prince of Wales Island (Penang), as “ cultivated and used as long pepper, but a very distinct species from the Malabar or Bengal long pepper,” in 1802. Uses, etc.—The spikes are gathered when they begin to turn red or yellowish, and quickly dried in the sun, or over a dre, as they are very liable to rot if not speedily dried, and especially if gathered when red. The dried spikes are cylindrical and somewhat taper- ing to the tip, and marked with superficial spiral furrows. They are 1 in. or 4 in- in length, and ^ in. through ; of a brownish or greyish white colour (said to be caused by rubbing them with lime), and when washed they have a deep brownish red colour. The pepper is very much more pungent than black pepper, and has a pleasant aromatic taste. As a spice it is chiedy used in pickling, and also as ground pepper for preserves, and in Malay curries. It

235 CASSIA BARK VII Imports for 1884-1885 Cwt. Value in Rupees. To Bombay To Bengal To Madras . 13,308 2,01,944 2,226 41,460 235 4,940 14,769 2,48,244 Of this China sent 13,557 cwt., valued at 2,24,805 rupees, and the Straits Settlements 1,212 cwt., valued at 23,536 rupees (this latter was probably Malayan cassia). The bark, re-exported, went to Persia, 2,785 cwt. ; Arabia, 980 cwt. ; and Turkey in Asia, 715 cwt. Thus at least the greater part of the cassia bark in commerce is derived from the Chinese Cinnamomum cassia. In French Indo-China some interest has been taken in this bark by the French colonists. M. Eberhardt and Professor Perrot published recently an article on “ Les Canneliers d’lndo-Chine,” in the Bulletin des sciences pharmacologiques, in Paris. They come to the conclusion that there is only one type of cassia bark tree, and that is Cinnamomum obtusifolium, Nees, the cassia bark of Cochin-China (C’ Loureiri, Nees) and the Chinese cassia (C. Cassia, Bl.) being only varieties of the Annamese (C. obtusifolium). There is one fairly extensive plantation of the tree in Quang N’gai (Annam) of 1,000 trees, a few plants in the Tea Gardens of M. Lombard, near Tourane, and some native cultivations in Bink-Na. The different sorts of Annam cassia are valued by the Chinese buyers according to appearance and source. The most highly valued is the “ Cannelle Royale ” of Thank Hoa, which is valued at more than its weight in gold. It is obtained exclusively from wild trees. The writers estimate that a tree, 15 to 16 metres tall, giving this class of cassia, brings 1,200 to 1,500 francs to the owner. Mr. Crevost (Bull. econ. lndo-Chine, No. 77, 1909, p. 150) states that the average price of the bark of Thank Hoa cassia ranges from 202 to 337 francs a

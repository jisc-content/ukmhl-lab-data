53 VANILLA II The fruit is at first dark green and smooth, but when it' is ripe it becomes yellowish. In Vanilla pompona, which is not liable to split, the pod is left until it becomes quite distinctly yellow, or even until the lower end becomes brownish. The pods of Vanilla planifolia have a tendency to split in ripening, which, should it occur, reduces their value as a commercial product. The pod cannot for this reason be left to hang long on the plant, and is gathered when it begins to turn yellow in the lower part, or even when the line along the side becomes yellow. Care must be taken, however, not to cut them too soon. During the ripening attention must be paid to the position of the pods, to see that they hang straight down and are not curved or bent. As the flowers appear one by one on the raceme, the fruits will also ripen one by one, so that those at the upper end of the hanging bunch will be ripe long before those at the lower end are ripe. A fully ripe pod of V planifolia is a cylindric, fleshy capsule about 5 or 6 in. long and \ in. thick. That of V. pompona is shorter and thicker. It is quite scentless, not developing its pleasant scent till the fermentation produced in curing takes place. During this process it passes from a yellow colour to a dark chocolate brown tint, and as it dries has a tendency to split more or less completely into two valves, one of which is larger than the other, and is grooved down the centre. The seeds are very numerous, minute, and black. They are surrounded by a dark-coloured oil known as balsam of vanilla. Those of the cultivated plants (which it will be remembered are self-fertilised) are usually sterile. Formerly many attempts were made to raise the plant from seed in Bourbon and elsewhere, but without success. Orchids are usually troublesome to raise from seed, but probably the self-fertilisation of the flowers in the cultivated plants was the cause of the failure.

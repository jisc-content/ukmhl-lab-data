59 VANILLA II Into a perfectly clean receptacle is put 25 to 30 litres of water at about 140 Falir., and 15 to 20 kilos of vanilla are thrown in and vigorously stirred up by hand. The pods are then taken out, lightly wiped, and put to dry in the shade. It is claimed for this process that it saves much of the perfume lost in the open air or stove treatment, and saves a good deal of hand labour. Mcicfctrlane’s Process. — Macfarlane adopts a different process for Vanilla pompona from that used for the pods of V. planifolia, for the process used for the first named cannot be applied to the latter without the loss by splitting of many of the pods. Vanilla Pompona.—The pods when gathered are taken to the house and spread out where the sun cannot strike them, 6 or 8 in. deep, upon shelves or on the floor until they turn brown. This takes from one to three weeks, according to the ripeness of the pods when picked. Pods gathered too soon sometimes lie for six weeks before turning brown. Thoroughly ripe pods begin to turn brown at the tip, the immature ones at the stem end or in the middle. When they are of a uniform deep red brown colour they can be exposed to the sun. For this purpose wooden trays are used 3 ft. by 6 ft., and 2 in. deep. The pods are spread on the trays about 1|- in. deep. For the first two or three days it is immaterial whether the pods are covered with blankets or not. They must be turned over two or three times a day, so that all are equally exposed to the sun. This is of the utmost importance throughout the whole process of curing, for if neglected some of the pods are sure to be burnt red by the sun. About 3 p.m., or whenever rain threatens, while the pods are still hot, the trays are removed to the house, stacked one upon another, and covered with blankets, so as to keep warm through the night. After the third or fourth day the pods are removed

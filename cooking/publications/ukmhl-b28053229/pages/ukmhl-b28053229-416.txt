He makes little difference between the cultivation of the two plants, and his general method is described under turmeric. He gives the output of ginger at 50 maunds (2,600 lbs.), but says that three times as much can sometimes be obtained. The ginger can be sold undried at 4 rupees per maund of 25 lbs., and the cost of cultivating comes to about 50 rupees per acre, which at 50 maunds to the acre gives 200 rupees, or a profit of 150 rupees per acre. Growth of the Plant.—Some investigations were made in Jamaica with the object of securing a regular shaped growth, with more or less straight fingers, as this form commands a higher price in the market. In the growth of the plant, a stem starts from the eye or bud of the cutting, and from this stem in turn lateral shoots or branches develop in pairs, the pairs generally alternating on opposite sides. It was observed that if the soil was well worked and pulverised before planting, the growth was straighter than when planted in hard soil, and that if the parent plant was well developed and vigorous, the resultant root-stock was of a better type than when the parent was small, gnarly, and crooked. To get the best results, therefore, the planter should carefully select his stock for planting, and should be particular about pulverising and thoroughly breaking up his soil. The amount of rhizomes required for planting is estimated in Bengal at 4 maunds (100 lbs.) for 1 bigha (1,600 square yards), and in the Punjab twice that amount. The cost of the rhizomes selected is estimated in Bengal at 4 rupees a maund, and in the Punjab 8 to 10 a rupee. The planters in Jamaica distinguish between “plant ginger” and “ratoon ginger.” By the former is meant ginger from fresh cuttings, which gives the best result, and is indeed the best method of cultivation.

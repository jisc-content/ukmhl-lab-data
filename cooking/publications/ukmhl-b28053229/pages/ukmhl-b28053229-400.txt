There is therefore a good market for it, grown as a market vegetable near towns. For this purpose the greatest demand seems to be for Capsicum annuum, though the Malays at least seem to prefer the birdâ€™s-eye chili (C. minimum) on account of its greater pungency. Its easier cultivation perhaps accounts to some extent for its greater popularity. The price of the garden vegetable varies according to its abundance at the time, and rises and falls constantly, and this abundance depends to a large extent on the weather, as unseasonable weather causes a great loss of fruit from fungus. In a good season, with not too heavy rains, the crop is good and the fruits cheap. On such occasions, when the supply is in excess of the demand, the fruit is usually dried for storing and export to countries where the plant is little or not at all grown. There is a fairly steady demand for dried capsicums even in some countries where it can be and is easily grown. Thus in Singapore, in 1875, 2,526 piculs, and in 1880, 4,882 piculs of dried capsicums were imported from India, though the plant is commonly cultivated in the island by the Chinese. There is also a considerable demand for capsicums by pickle manufacturers, who use both fresh and dried fruits, and finally there is a demand for the manufactured article, cayenne pepper. The cultivation might well be taken up by the planters of permanent crops as a subsidiary or catch- crop, especially in cases where there is a good market for the fresh fruit accessible, but it should be in any case rotated at intervals with other crops, as it does not do well as a permanent annual crop, continuously grown on the same ground.

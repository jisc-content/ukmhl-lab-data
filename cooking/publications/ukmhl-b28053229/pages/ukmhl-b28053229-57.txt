39 VANILLA II covered with hairs had found their way to the manures where previously no roots were found. Propagating.â€”The vanilla plant is always propa- gated by cuttings. Though it has been raised from seed, in any ordinary case it would not be worth while to attempt to grow it from seed, as it is easy enough to propagate from cuttings. There is some difference in the length of cuttings used in different places. The Mexicans make cuttings 3 or 4 ft. long or even more. It is more common, however, to make short cuttings of a foot or so in length. It is claimed that plants grown from long cuttings commence flowering in the first year. The short cuttings certainly take longer, not coming into bearing until about the third or fourth year. When long cuttings are used, the stem is laid on the ground in a circle up to half its length, or is coiled round its future support. Its tip requires to be protected from the sun, and the plant must be frequently watered. I find also that it is advisable to cover the prostrate stem with a light layer of soil or rotten leaves to save it from injury and hasten its growth. In planting short cuttings, the base is inserted in the ground for about an inch, and a stick put close to it to start it climbing, or it may be put close to the tree on which it is to climb. At least two joints of the stem must be above the ground. After a week or two the plant puts out a shoot from one of the leaf axils, which soon lengthens, and sending out roots commences to cling to the support. The leaves of the young branch are usually brighter green, smaller and narrower than those of the original cutting. Eventu- ally, however, they attain their full size and deep green colour. For convenience the cuttings may be started in a nursery and removed to the garden when they have commenced to grow. The nursery beds should be made of good, rich leaf-mould, and shaded. As a rule, at least in the Straits Settlements, the cuttings require water-

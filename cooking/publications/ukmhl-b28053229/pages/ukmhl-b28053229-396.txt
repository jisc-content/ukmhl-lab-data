SPICES 378 CHAP. beans, tobacco, and attacks chiefly the seedling capsi- cums. The seedling beds can be protected by putting round them the leaves of Euphorbia neriifolia, which the caterpillars eat and which are fatal to them. The birds known as Mynahs kill a great many, and a parasitic fly (a Tachinid) destroys a number of them. Removal of hedges and weeds in which the cater- pillar can pupate will also be effective in driving them away. Hemicliionaspis minor, Masked.—A very trouble- some coccid also attacks the capsicum. This small white species injures many plants in the West Indies. It occurs also in New Zealand, North America, India, and Ceylon. It is devoured by the larva of a species of lady-bird. Another injurious insect is one of the fruit flies, Dacus caudatus, the maggots of which feed on ripen- ing fruits. They do not attack the seeds, but prevent the ripening of the fruit, so that the whole fruit is destroyed. It is rather difficult to deal with this class of insects, as it is impossible to catch these active flies in any quantity, and no insecticide will deal with a maggot inside a fruit. In the case of an outbreak of this pest, all infected fruits should be taken off and destroyed, care being taken not to leave any on the ground so that the animal can pass into the pupa state and hatch out as flies to continue the destruction. Two or more species of Epilachna, E. territa, Muls., and E. pusillanima, Muls., attack the leaves of capsi- cums, as well as those of other plants of the order Solanaceae, by biting holes in them, and may do a good deal of damage. They are small lady-bird-like beetles, of a dull pinkish colour, and usually more or less hairy. Fungi.—According to Tubeuf, the fungus known as Gloeosporium piperatum attacks the fruits of Capsicum annuum. It is closely allied to, if not identical with, Gl. fructigenum, the ripe-rot fungus of apples. This causes brown spots like decay on the fruit, but instead

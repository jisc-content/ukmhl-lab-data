CARDAMOMS X 343 proportion of the flowers are unfertilised. The flowers of this plant are fertilised by insects, and it frequently happens with plants in the tropics that the first flowers produced by a plant, especially if new to its locality, fail to set fruit, as the insects which can and do fertilise it appear not to have found the flowers. There does not seem to be any record from Ceylon or India as to what insects fertilise the flowers, but it is probably effected by some species of bee or possibly a fly. In the Singapore Botanic Gardens I found a Dipteron visiting the flowers, from which it was sucking honey, licking with its long tongue the purple streaks on the lip and the base of the stamen. The fly was ^ in. long, mostly dull ochre yellow, the eyes, centre of thorax, and six longitudinal lines -down the abdomen black. It is one of the fruit flies (Dacidae). I did not see it actually fertilise the flowers. The importance of the attendance of the fertilising insect at the right time must be very great, and its absence probably accounts for the smallness of the crops on some occasions. The plants flower somewhat irregularly in Kanara in April and May; in Ceylon almost all the year round, but chiefly from January to May. Those grown in the Singapore Gardens flowered in the early part of the year, but continued rather irregularly till much later. The fruits form in June and July, and ripen in August, or the beginning of September, lasting till April in Ceylon, from September to December being the heaviest cropping time. In Bombay they chiefly ripen in September and October. They are said to require light showery weather during the season of flowering; absence of this causes a failure to crop, and Mollison recommends protecting the growing fruit by a light covering of leaves and brush- wood when the rains are heavy during ripening. As the flowers on the scape do not appear simul-

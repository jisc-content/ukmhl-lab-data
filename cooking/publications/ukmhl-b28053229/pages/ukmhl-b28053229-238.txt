SPICES 220 CHAP. a strip of bark on the stick, and holding it firm with his foot, scrapes off the outer skin with a small curved knife. The operator then takes a bundle of prepared slips and sorts them into different qualities, selects a slip suitable for the outer cover of the pipe, trims it and cuts the end square with a pair of scissors, and on a board 3 ft. long, prepared for the purpose, proceeds to pack as many of the smaller pieces as it will hold ; when dry, he adds another slip, and goes on till he has got the proper length. The pipes or quills are arranged on parallel lines stretched across the shed, where they are left till they are firm enough for handling. After this the pipes are finished off by pressing in the edges of the outside pieces and dressing the ends. Then they are spread out on stages in the sun, but covered with a mat, as the direct rays of the sun are apt to warp them. First-class pipes are of uniform thickness, colour, and quality, the edges neatly joined in a straight line from end to end; the joints of the pieces that compose the outer cover are close and neat; the ends resemble a roll of paper, and the whole pipe will be firm and compact. The sizes of the pipes vary according to the quality, finer sorts running from 15 to 20 to the pound, inferior sorts 10 to 15. They are eventually made up into bundles of 100 lbs. weight, covered with gunny cloth. The bark of good cinnamon is then often no thicker than stout paper, light brown, dull and faintly marked with wavy lines, showing here and there marks of the points of attachment of leaves or buds, slightly flexible, breaking with a splintery fracture. It has an agree- able, aromatic taste, and is slightly sweet. When chewed it becomes soft, and seems to melt in the mouth. The bark of large shoots or thick branches is coarse. That of the young shoots is thin and of a light straw- colour, with very little flavour. Shoots exposed to sun during growth are more acrid and spicy than those

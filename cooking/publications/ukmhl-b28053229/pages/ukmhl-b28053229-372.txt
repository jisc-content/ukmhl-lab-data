SPICES 35 4 CHAP. scissors. The women in India squat on the floor, and, resting the right elbow on the ground, feed the scissors with the left hand. The stalk is very small, and requires some care and practice not to cut the fruit itself. These women work very fast, and Mr. Ozanne, who describes it, saw an old woman clip 90 cardamoms a minute. These women are paid at the rate of \ anna for the clipping of 1 padi (10 padis are 26 lbs.). Some can even earn 2^ annas a day, and therefore must clip 13 lbs. a day. In Ceylon the coolies cannot clip more than 3 lbs. a day, but this includes picking out broken and brown capsules as well. SORTING The crop is sorted, when dry, into split and entire capsules, and the entire capsules are sorted according to colour ; the perfectly cured ones, of a straw colour ; those which are discoloured with a brownish tinge or stained on one side; and those which are nearly black, due usually to gathering and curing in unfavourable weather. Cardamoms are valued not only according to their colour, but according to their plumpness and heaviness, and the sound and mature conditions of their seeds. Good samples afford about three-fourths of their weight of seeds. Thus 200 lbs. shelled at various times during ten years afforded 154^ lbs. of seed. (Messrs. Allen and Han bury, in All about Cardamoms, by A. M. and J. Ferguson.) There are several forms of the capsule known in commerce; of the Indian forms there are two classes, according to size, the ovoid or nearly globular, J to § in. long, termed shorts, and those of a more elongated form tV t0 TU in- l°ng> called short longs. They are also distinguished by the names of localities, Malabar, etc. ; the most valued occur as shorts and short longs. They are most highly valued, and are shipped from Bombay to Europe. Madras are chiefly long forms (short longs), and are

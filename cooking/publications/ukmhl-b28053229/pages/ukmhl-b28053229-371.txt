CARDAMOMS X 353 are then transferred to two other women, who wash them in like manner in another tub containing 7 quarts of pure water, 1 quart of the soap-nut mixture, and 1 quart of the soap mixture. After again being put into a basket to drain they are thrown upon a mat, and sprinkled at intervals of half an hour all through the night with well water. Next day when the sun has risen the cardamoms are borne to the roof of the house and spread on mats to dry for four or five hours. STARCHING This is done by sprinkling the cardamoms with a solution of starch while the capsules are being rubbed by hand. The starch is prepared by pounding together rice, wheat, and country soap with buttermilk, and dissolving the paste in water. This gives them a white colour, which is popular at least among local con- sumers. Neither of these processes is apparently in use in Ceylon, or the greater part of the Indian cardamom region, the light colour obtained by simple sun drying- being deemed sufficient. CLIPPING When the fruit is dried before packing, it is necessary to clip off the stalk and the little dried calyx at the top of the fruit. In some parts of India the fruit is merely rubbed against the bottom of a basket, after which the women separate the bits, empty capsules, and the loose seeds, preserving the latter. This is said to be very trying, as the dust produced by rubbing the capsules against the basket is very pungent, and produces illness among the coolies, who have to wear a veil over their faces, and this operation cannot be performed in wet weather, as the capsules would absorb moisture and be spoilt. In most places, however, the stalk and calyx are removed by clipping them off with a pair of English 2 A

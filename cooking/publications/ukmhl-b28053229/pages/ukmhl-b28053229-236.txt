SPICES 218 CHAP. most likely to appear in overcrowded plantations, where during the rainy season the air can never get dry, and the too dense bushes remain permanently wet. It may be taken as a sign that the plants are too close and require thinning. The fungus is apt to spread through an estate, but irregularly, and frequently disappears as soon as the weather is dry. All twigs or shoots attacked by it should be cut off below the fungus and burnt, and should it appear to be abundant, spraying with copper sulphate solution, or Bordeaux mixture, will destroy it. CUTTING The cutting and peeling season is supposed to commence in May and November, but often later, according to the rains. The flush follows the first rains of the season, and continues a longer or shorter time, according to the quantity that falls. As the flush or young red leaf assumes the normal dark green, the sap begins to circulate between the wood and the bark, and while this circulation continues the sticks peel freely, and these are the periods for cropping. It is best if the crop can be got out at one cutting, but this does not often happen. If the season is not a good one the bushes may have to be cut over two or three times. After every cutting one or more young shoots spring from every stump, and as there are two cuttings a year there is a succession of young wood of different ages in the stocks. The bulk of the crop is the wood of two years’ growth, but if the whole two years’ growth is not cut, in consequence of a bad season or insufficient labour, the sticks that promise to peel at next cutting are left, but in pruning every stick older than two years is cut out, whether it will peel or not. It takes about two hours for 150 men to cut over a 10-acre block. The shoots selected are usually from 3 to 4 ft. long and \ to f in. thick. To see if they are fit for cutting the peeler makes a small cut obliquely into the bark

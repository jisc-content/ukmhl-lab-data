IV 169 CLOVES topped, but in Amboyna and other parts of the Eastern Archipelago, where it grows to 20 or as much as 40 ft. in height, it is advisable to top it so that the buds can be easily reached by the pickers. Besides this work there is little to be done to the plantation except weed- ing where necessary when the plants are young, and cleaning the trees of parasitic mistletoes, and of moss and epiphytic ferns, to which they are rather liable, destroying borers and other pests, and manuring, until the trees commence to produce the flower buds. PESTS AND DISEASES There are not many recorded diseases of the clove tree, but one of those known is a very troublesome and destructive pest. It is a parasitic alga known as Cephaleurus my coidea, Karsten, or “ Red-spot.” The attack of this parasite appears to the naked eye as a dark red spot visible on both surfaces of the leaf, more or less rounded or oval in outline, and from about in. across to ^ in. in diameter. Commencing quite small, it increases gradually in size; eventually the spot becomes hard and black in the centre, with the oil glands much enlarged and swollen, and at last the centre becomes dead, greyish in colour, surrounded by a black and outer red ring. The dead portion falls out, leaving a circular hole in the leaf. The spots are scattered over the leaf usually nearer to the edge than to the centre, and frequently run into each other. The leaf is often attacked when it has just opened, and before it has attained its full green colouring, and in many cases it appears that the bud is attacked and quite often destroyed. In any case the attack seems to commence in the early stages of the opening of the leaf. At length, when the leaf is getting yellow and dying, the alga commences to fruit on the under side of the leaf. In the blackened spot can be seen with a lens some fine white hairs, tipped with yellow. On examination with the micro- scope these hairs are seen to be fine filaments, bearing at

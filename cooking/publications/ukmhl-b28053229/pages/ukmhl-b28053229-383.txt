XI 365 CAPSICUMS CULTIVATION The capsicums are grown from seed, and are plants easy of cultivation. The soil required is light and friable, and should be worked up to a depth of from 4 to 6 in., and brought to a fine tilth. If the soil is poor, it should be manured with cattle dung during the preparation of the soil, and this should be well mixed with the earth till it is decayed, and combined with the soil. In some countries the natives sow the seed broad- cast, and so leave it. This is not, however, at all advisable, and the proper system is to raise the plants in nurseries, and when sufficiently tall to plant the seedlings in rows, on ridges, banked up. The seeds, when sprinkled broadcast over the land, produce about 15,000 plants to the acre; planted out from nurseries 6,000 go to an acre (Drieberg). In Ceylon, the plants are planted out in April, and the crop commences in June, and continues on and off for six months. During the growth of the plant, the ground may be improved with a dressing of ashes, and the soil banked up around the plants. In India, when the plant begins to flag from continuous picking, a top-dressing of castor-cake, 600 to 1,000 lbs. to the acre, is given to prolong the cropping season. In Ceylon, the favourite manure consists of the leaves of Croton lacciferum. Cow-dung, given at this stage, is too strong, and causes the plant to develop leaf at the expense of fruit, the leaves becoming large and unhealthy. In Europe, the soil recommended is a light rich soil composed of tufty loam, rotted leaf mould, and cow manure in equal parts with a little silver sand. It must be remembered that in the tropics strong manure like fresh cow-dung and horse-dung (a valuable manure in a cold country) cannot be used in the same way as they can in a temperate climate. It seems probable that in a hot climate the decomposition of

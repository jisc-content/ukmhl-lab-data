SPICES 190 CHAP. IV century, and at the beginning of the nineteenth century they were commonly mixed with clove buds and distilled, in order to cheapen the price of clove oil (Gildenmeister and Hoffmann, Volatile Oils). Mother-Cloves.â€”These are the dried fruits of the clove. They contain less clove oil than the buds, but are occasionally exported to Europe for making clove oil. 1,050 bags were sold in England in 1873 at 2d. to 3d. per lb. In the old days of clove cultivation in Penang most of the mother-cloves went to China, the Chinese having a fancy for them for medicine. The planters had an idea, however, that the production of mother-cloves exhausted the tree, which is possible. As a rule, the planter naturally gathers his whole crop of flower buds, so that no mother-cloves are left on the trees, except those required for propagating, but frequently in picking a certain number of flowers are left here and there, which develop into mother-cloves. There is nothing to be gained by leaving them to fruit, however, as there is a better demand for the clove-buds than for the mother-cloves. Literature Buee.

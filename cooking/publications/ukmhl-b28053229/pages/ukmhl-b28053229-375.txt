CARDAMOMS X 357 OTHER CARDAMOMS Nepal Cardamom (Amomum subulcttum).â€”This plant is pretty extensively cultivated by the in- habitants of Eastern Nepal. It is essentially a swamp plant, and comes in usefully as a crop for irregular patches of ground by the sides of streams which are unsuitable for rice, than which it is more profitable (Dr. King, Journal Linnean Society, xvii.). The plants are cultivated in much the same way as the true cardamoms. According to N. G. Mukerji (Handbook of Indian Agriculture), it is grown in the lower valleys of Bhotan and Sikkim, where the beds are made alongside mountain streams, whence water is taken along narrow channels, alongside of which the cardamoms are grown on ridges. This arrangement secures constant moisture and freedom from water- logging. The plant is known as Bara-dachi, or the greater cardamom, or Kala-dachi, the black cardamom. The plant attains a height of 3 to 6 ft., and the flowers are produced in a dense short spike close to the ground. In fruit this spike is ovoid, 3 to 4 in. long, densely crowded with bracts. The fruit is about 1 in. in length, ovoid, three-cornered, and marked with thin jagged ridges, and coarsely striped. The fruit splits readily into three valves, and encloses a mass of about 60 to 80 seeds embedded in a pulp. The seeds are highly aromatic, and used by natives chiefly. There is practically, it appears, no European com- merce in these cardamoms, but they are in some demand in India. Round Cardamoms (Amomum Cardamomum, L.) is a native of Cambodia and Siam. It has stems about 4 ft. tall, with a short cluster of pink and white flowers at the base. The fruit is produced in small compact bunches, and is globular (whence the name round cardamoms); ^ to ^ in. through, longitudinally furrowed; the capsule is thin, fragile, buff - coloured when dry, and somewhat hairy. The seeds resemble

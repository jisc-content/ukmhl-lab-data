SPICES 202 CHAP. The trees vary in yield, but some give as much as 150 lbs. of fresh, or 112 lbs. of dried berries. The returns are considerably affected, by the weather during the fruiting season. Thus in 1906-1907 the crops were short, owing to heavy and. destructive rains while the fruit was forming, and the next crop was short again from a prolonged drought. This raised the price from the average of 15s. per 100 lbs. to 21s., but it has run higher than this, frequently being 25s. to 28s. per 100 lbs. weight, and Koxburgh quotes it as selling at one time at 40s. The sale price in England is about 4d. to 6d. per lb. Plantation pimento fetches a higher price than that from wild trees, as more care is taken in its preparation. The highest export of late years has been 6,857,830 lbs. in 1870-1871, valued at £28,574; in 1877-1878, 6,195,105 lbs., but it has been higher even than that, as mentioned above, within the last few years. The maximum export from Jamaica is given as of the value of £78,900 in 1906. About one-third of this goes to North America, the remaining two-thirds to England.

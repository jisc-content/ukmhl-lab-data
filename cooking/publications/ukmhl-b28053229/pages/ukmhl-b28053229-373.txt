X 355 CARDAMOMS paler ; they are shipped from Madras and Pondicherry. Aleppy are usually shorts, plump, beaked, and of a peculiar greenish tint, shipped from Calicut. Ceylon cardamoms, as has been said, are derived from a second type of plant. They are 1 to 2 in. long, and to X4X in. through, three-sided, often curved, and always dark greyish brown. The seeds are larger and more numerous, and somewhat different in taste (Ferguson, l.c.). Owen, however, says that perfect Ceylon cardamoms are of a light straw colour. He says that the distinction into shorts and short longs has no value and may be ignored, the capsules only being sorted according to colour. PACKING The capsules are packed in wooden cases holding 65 lbs. each, and measuring 22-| in. by 15 in. by 12 in. They should not be lined with lead or zinc, but with light gunny cloth. In packing great care should be taken that the capsules are quite dry. CULTIVATION AREAS Practically the whole of the cardamoms of commerce are produced in India and Ceylon. The plant has been introduced into most other tropical countries, but no cultivation of any extent has resulted there. In India the exact amount of cardamoms produced is difficult to arrive at, as much is consumed in the country. Shipments, in 1872-1873, from Bombay amounted to 184,800 lbs., of which 118,160 lbs. went to England. In Ceylon the export is very large, as will be seen from the tables below; of this product more than half is sent to India, the rest to Europe. In Ceylon cardamoms have been one of the most important crops for many years. The output is given by Owen and others for the last few years as follows :â€”

I 5 INTRODUCTION are not adapted especially for this region do not thrive here. Most of the trees of this region are leafless in the dry season, and trees like the nutmeg and clove, which are not deciduous, but evergreen, succumb at the first dry spell. In this region the annual field crop spices—coriander, cumin, chilies—are commonly grown, as well as the rhizomatous ginger and turmeric, which in this climate lose their leaves during the dry spell. Some of the tropical spices, such as capsicums and ginger, have a wider cultivation area than most of the others, and go almost outside the tropical area, but on the whole the areas of successful cultivation are limited. It is rather remarkable that so large a proportion of the spices of the tropics are successfully grown on islands only, or in close propinquity to the sea. Among these are nutmegs, cloves, vanilla, clove barks, and perhaps we may add cinnamon and cardamoms as island plants. SOILS The various soils suited for the different spices are mentioned under their respective headings. There seems to be increasing evidence that with most plants the physical characteristics of the soil are more important than its chemical constituents. Its water capacity, permeability, and capillary conduction or power of absorbing water, are its most important characteristics. Different crops require different degrees of moisture or dryness. Most, however, of the plants described in this work require a greater average moisture in an accessible and utilisable form than the plants of colder climates, as their natural habitat is in the wetter part of the tropics. Plants have a great power of adapta- tion to surroundings, though at the same time there is a limit to their endurance. In soil where it cannot obtain its food and water in sufficient quantity a plant becomes pale and weak. The leaves show an unmistak- able yellow tint instead of the rich green, whether light

Lecomte are correct, it is clear that it is advisable to dry the vanillas, partly, at least, in the sun before submitting them to the action of steam or boiling water, and in any case to be careful to keep the platforms on which the vanillas are put out to dry clean of mildew or of anything which may encourage the growth of mildew. SORTING AND PACKING It is recommended to keep the vanilla for a month at least before packing it for export, to make sure of its being sufficiently dry. The pods are first sorted into classes for packing. In Mexico five classes of vanilla are known. The bast is ‘primera, the pods of which are 24 cm. long and proportionally thick; the second are called chica prima, the pods being shorter and two counting as one ; the third is sacate; the fourth, vesacate, are still smaller, and are gathered before they are ripe; the fifth quality is basura, with small, spotted, and much broken pods. Usually, however, the pods are first sorted into qualities and then according to length. The first- class pods are oily, strongly perfumed, black, and with- out defects. The second class contains the over-dried pods, reddish in colour, with a rough outside. In the third class are put those that have split. The pods of Vanilla pompona, known as vanillons, would of course not be mixed with the other kind, but kept and packed separately. There is only one class for these. When the pods have been sorted out into the classes above-mentioned, they must be measured and sorted according to length. For this a measuring board or table is used. A most convenient form consists of a piece or 4- in. broad, 3 in. wide and 14 in. long. A strip of wood is nailed at one end, and a scale of £ in. interval from 4 to 11 in. is marked from the strip of wood, as even when cut with the chisel the marks are soon obliterated by the oil of

But it was after the failure of coffee in Ceylon in 1878, that the industry developed to its greatest. So successful was this cultivation that it is recorded that an acre of cardamoms produced as much as Â£300 worth. The price, however, owing to increased production, fell, but even at 2s. per lb. cardamoms give a handsome profit. The present price is about 4s. per lb. USES Cardamoms are used in curry-powder, and for flavouring cakes, especially in Bussia, Sweden, Norway, and parts of Germany. They are also used in the manufacture of liqueurs, Ceylon cardamoms being almost exclusively used for this purpose. In European medicine they are chiefly used in tincture of cardamoms, as a stomachic, and in combina- tion with other drugs as an aromatic.

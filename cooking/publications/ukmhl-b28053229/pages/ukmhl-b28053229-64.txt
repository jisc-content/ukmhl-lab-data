46 SPICES CHAP. irregular marks on the pod which spoil this, or lower the value of the product. The caterpillar is black with ash-grey spots, and hardly 7 to 8 millimetres long. It runs with remarkable rapidity. If the eggs are laid on the flower just after fertilisation has been effected, the pest can be destroyed. Another moth caterpillar, Plusia aurifera, common in Reunion, Madagascar, Africa, Saint Helena, Teneriffe, and even southern Europe, is troublesome in eating the buds of the plant. The caterpillar is pale green, about 3 centimetres long, with few hairs. The moth is reddish brown, with a broad band of gold across the upper wings; the lower wings are grey, the head and collar red, thorax and body grey. The caterpillar of Simplica inarcualis is also re- ported as occasionally attacking vanilla. A small lamellicorn beetle, Hoplia retusa, and an ashy-grey weevil, Cratopus punctum, bite holes in the flowers and often destroy the column. But the most destructive is a weevil (Curculionidae), Perissoderes ruficottis, which inhabits Madagascar. The grub burrows up the stems of the vine, completely destroying it, and all the parts attacked turn black and die. The grub pupates in its burrow in a cocoon of dried fibres of the stem. The branches affected should be at once cut off and destroyed.1 Large and small snails (Achatincc and Helix) and a slug in Tahiti attack all parts of the plant, and a green dove in Tahiti eats the flower - buds. These, however, do not appear to be very destructive, and are easily dealt with. FERTILISATION In its native country of Mexico the flowers of the vanilla, are naturally fertilised by small bees of the genus Melipona, and also by humming-birds. But, although there are plenty of bees in other parts of the world where the vanilla is cultivated, for some 1 E. Bordage, Revue des cultures colonialcs (1901), July, p. 50.

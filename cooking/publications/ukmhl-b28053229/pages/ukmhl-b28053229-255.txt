VII CASSIA BARK 237 Kulit Laivang of the Malays (Kulit, bark; Lawang, clove), is a native of the Malay Islands and Peninsula. It has a strongly aromatic bark, and is one of the cassia barks of commerce. The calyces of the fruit of this plant are sold in Singapore under the name of Bunga Laivang (clove bark flowers). They are small stalked cups, curiously lobed, about in. across, black when dry, with a slender stalk. They are expensive, costing about a cent apiece, and highly valued in native medicine, and for curries. Cinnamomum Sintoc, Bl.—The Sintok of the Malays is a large tree occurring in Java and the Malay Peninsula. It has also a very aromatic bark, which is collected and sold. These jungle cassia barks are usually thicker than the Chinese cassia barks, probably being taken from the trunks of old trees only. Sumatra produces a consider- able quantity of one of these cassia barks, probably C. Sintoc. From Padang was exported, in 1871, 6,127 piculs of cassia bark, of which a large portion was shipped to America (Fliickiger and Hanbury). Large quantities are shipped from Java, Timor, and other islands to Europe. They are variable in form and thickness, from the thickness of cardboard to more than £ in. They vary also in colour, some being of a pale cinnamon colour, others deep brown. It may be doubted if any of these Malay cassias would be worth cultivating, though no doubt the bark produced thus would be of a much finer quality than that from the jungle, for they are mostly inferior to Chinese cassia, which would be as easy to cultivate. MASSOI BARK This bark is the product of a tree of large size occurring in the forests of New Guinea. The bark which is taken from old trees in the jungle is thick and aromatic. The natives seek the tree in the forest, and

205 CHAPTER YI CINNAMON The cinnamon of commerce is the bark of the tree Cinnctmomum zeylanicum, Breyn, of the aromatic order of Laurineae. The tree is a native of Ceylon, occurring in moist low country to an elevation of 2,000 ft. (Trimen, Flora of Ceylon), and is said to occur also in Southern India, Burma, and the Malay Peninsula. I have seen no specimens from the Malay Peninsula, undoubtedly wild, but the allied tree Cinnamomum iners, Bl., is one of the commonest low country trees, and so closely resembles the true cinnamon that, except for the taste and odour of the bark, I find it very difficult to separate the two plants botanically, and it seems probable to me that the true Ceylon cinnamon is a very aromatic form of C. iners. The bark of this latter varies a good deal in its aroma, but is never as highly flavoured or scented. The Malays use it, however, in medicine and as a spice, though only to a small extent and as a substitute for true cinnamon, which they much prefer. Curiously, although so similar the two trees do not flower and fruit simultaneously, for when C. iners is in flower (all trees in the neighbourhood flowering at one time), C. zeylanicum is not to be found in flower or fruit, the flowers usually appearing later. DESCRIPTION The tree when full grown is usually about 20 ft. in height, but occasionally reaches 40 ft. It has a

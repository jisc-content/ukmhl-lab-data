NUTMEGS AND MACE Ill 145 sugar is required. The jelly, when well prepared, is of a bright red colour, and quite clear and transparent. It possesses a very pleasant flavour of nutmegs. The natives also slice the husk and salt it as an adjunct to curries, and also as a thirst stimulant, and in the lower class of drinking shops it is usually supplied for this purpose. The husks vary in price, but usually sell in Penang for about 10 cents for a large basket.

It is only attached to the seed by the base, which is known as the heel of the mace. When fresh it is of a brilliant red colour, rather tough and leathery, and possessing a peculiarly turpentine flavour. It is taken off and dried by preference in one piece, “ double-blade,” or separated into two halves, “ single-blade.” The double blades have a better appearance, and seem to be more popular. The mace after removal is flattened out by hand, or sometimes between two boards. In Banda the coolies tread upon it to flatten it. It is then dried in the sun in flat baskets or trays of bamboo, or on mats. The Dutch planters sometimes sprinkle it with sea- water before putting it to dry, in order to prevent its being attacked by insects, but this is not necessary if proper care is taken, and can hardly be said to improve the mace, though it is said also to improve the aroma and to make the mace more supple. In most cases it is necessary to expose the mace to the sun for four or five hours a day for a fortnight (Lumsdaine), but in good, dry weather the sun-heat should dry it sufficiently in two days. Before nightfall it must be brought into a drying-shed so as to avoid its being wetted by the dew. In Banda and Minahassa it L

CARDAMOMS 347 X Boarmia Bhurmitra, Wik.—A brown twig-like caterpillar of this species of Geometer moth was found by Mr. E. Green to have destroyed the foliage of a large number of cardamom plants in Ceylon. The insect really attacked the Grevillea robusta trees used as shade for tea plants and the cardamoms, and having devoured all the leaves of the grevillas attacked the next plant they could eat, which happened to be the cardamoms. This is a common occurrence when cater- pillars of any kind become so abundant that they too soon eat all their proper food-stuff, and have to supple- ment the failure by something else. The moth is about 1^ in. across, brown with transverse streaks and dots of darker colour. The case is recorded in Watt’s Pests of the Tea Plant. Coccidae.—There is a small but common Coccid which I have found attacking the under side of the leaf of cardamoms. The insects, which are very small, not in. long, are when adult of a reddish brown colour, tortoise-shaped, and bearing all round their bodies a fringe of oblong white powdery wax processes. The adults remain stationary on the leaf, crowded closely together. The young ones move about on the leaf in a more active way. They are more yellowish, with longer legs and less wax on their edges. In very wet seasons serious losses are sustained by the rotting off of fruit and racemes before maturity. It is probable that this is due to a fungus, but no investigations appear to have been made on the subject. A so-called disease in the Kanara gardens is described by Mollison. The affected plants become unthrifty ; the leaves in part become yellow, and these parts wither and the plants have no vigour of growth. The unhealthy appearance was at first local, but later the disease spread and extended over large areas. This, Mollison thinks, is due to degeneration from continuous planting without change of seed, rotation of other crops, or fallowing. This is very probable, as many of the plants of the

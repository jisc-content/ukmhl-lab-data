Ill 151 NUTMEGS AND MACE and weight is about four to the ounce. They are sorted, therefore, according to weight. Broken or worm-eaten nuts, and those too small to be worth selling whole, are used for making butter, as described below. Packing.—The nutmegs are packed in casks which have been slightly smoked inside, and then treated to a thin coat of lime and water, or in chests. Care is to be taken that the cracks in the boxes are sealed up with dammar or other resin, to prevent the incoming of water. West Indian nutmegs are imported in barrels containing 1-^ to 2 cwt., but sometimes in bags or even tea-chests. It is usual to sort them into sizes before packing, but this is not always done, the sorting being done on their arrival in Europe.1 The main use of nutmegs is as a spice, and for trade purposes they are valued according to size, as has been stated above, and smoothness, light colour, and freedom from admixture with long nutmegs, which are mixed with the oval form, not that the long form of the genuine nutmeg is any way inferior to the oval one, but it is liable to be confused with the wild long nutmeg (Myristica argentea) of Papua. Singapore nutmegs are frequently darker in colour than those of Banda, Penang, and Ceylon, but the West Indian ones occasionally show darker patches of colour. Defective or broken nutmegs are used either by being ground to make powdered spice for seasoning sausages, or for making nutmeg butter.2 The nutmeg contains a quantity—about a fourth of its weight—of fat, which forms the nutmeg butter of 1 E.

Trang pepper, too, stands the milling process in London better than any other; the local Malay Peninsula varieties being apt to break up, being too brittle, and for these reasons Trang pepper always obtains the highest price in the market. Sumatran Varieties.—Marsden, in The History of Sumatra, mentions three varieties cultivated by the natives, Lada Raivur, Lada Manna, and Lada Jo/rnbi. The first of these, also known as Lampoon (Lampong), is the strongest he says, and bears the largest leaf and fruit, is slower than the next in coming to perfection, but of much longer duration. The fruits of the second variety, Lada Manna, are somewhat smaller, and its peculiarity is that it bears soon, and in large quantities, but seldom passes the third or fourth year crop. The Jambi, which had, he says, fallen into disrepute, is the smallest in leaf and fruit, very short-lived, and not without difficulty trained to its post. Dwarf Pepper.—A non-climbing pepper of erect habit, and dwarfed, is described by Mr. W. E. Broadway, the Curator of the Botanic station in Grenada, West Indies, in the Agricultural Neivs (vol. ii. p. 69). He says that this form never fails to produce a good crop, and its low habit is very convenient for gathering the fruit, while the climbing pepper fruits irregularly. Though this is an interesting variety, and might, under special circumstances, be used profitably, one would hardly be inclined to recommend it for cultivation. It is obvious that this dwarf pepper, however closely packed on the ground, could not give as big a return from an acre as a good vine growing from 12 to 20 ft. tall. HISTORY Pepper is one of the earliest known spices in the world, and was formerly the staple commodity of trade between India and Europe. It is mentioned by Theophrastus in the fourth century B.c., who mentions two kinds, apparently black pepper and long pepper.

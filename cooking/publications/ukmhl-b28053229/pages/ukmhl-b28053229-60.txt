SPICES 42 CHAP. Raising from Seed.—In 1902, M. Dupont made experiments at the Government Botanic Station of the Seychelles to raise vanilla from seed in the follow- ing manner. Fully ripe pods were allowed to blacken, and the seeds when removed were soaked in alcohol for twenty-four hours, and shortly after were thoroughly washed and planted. The seedlings are reported to have grown well. Though it is probable that growing vanilla from seed as a regular or common thing might be too slow a process for the planter, there is a good deal to be said for this being occasionally done. Plants which like vanilla have been for many generations grown continuously from cuttings, are very apt to deteriorate and become weak and liable to disease. Nature, it is «aid, abhors perpetual self-fertilisation. And it may be said that nature still more abhors perpetual asexual reproduction. A fresh strain of vanilla in estates would be very desirable. In raising plants from seed it would be advantageous to use pollen from a different plant for fertilising a flower. Pruning.—The old stems should be cut off after flowering, even if they still carry buds. The plant will replace them with good and strong stems bearing more flowers, and probably better fruit than the old stems would by the next flowering season. Pruning the young stems has been productive of good results in some cultivations and a failure in others. The opiuion of Delteil is, that if a planter wishes to get a rapid return from the vanillery, and does not intend to keep it going for more than two or three years, pruning is suitable. It produces an excessive crop of fruit, but always at the expense of the plant. In cases where the planter has a number of young plants and wishes to have a succession of good fruiting plants,—one lot ready while the next is coming on,— the system of pruning may pay very well. At the first flowering of the young stems the ends of the branches

SPICES 348 CHAP. ginger family degenerate in a few years if grown con- tinuously on the same soil. In Kanara borers and grubs are found to cause much damage. They cut through the bases of the leafy stems and bite through the rhizome. “ Some of the grubs are identical with the large fat ones commonly found in farmyard manure.” These are evidently large lamelli- corn beetle-grubs, but no further account of them is given. It is said that leaf mould made of astringent tree- leaves keeps off these insects. Eats and wild pigs are in Ceylon and elsewhere very destructive to the cardamoms, and it is said that many cases of snake-bite are due to the hiding of poison- ous snakes in the clumps of cardamoms, where they are lying in wait for rats. In the Singapore Gardens squirrels, also, took a part in the destruction of fruits, and also frequently ate the flowers. For these smaller animals poisoning is perhaps the best treatment. The pigs, which not only eat the fruit but gnaw the rhizomes as well, must be hunted and shot. Thieves in Ceylon are most troublesome, taking bulbs or fruit, according to which is in demand. There is great difficulty in detecting and bringing the persons to justice, even with the aid of night watchmen, who are absolutely necessary in some parts of the country. This form of larceny is common in many plantations, and most legislatures have utterly failed to deal with it at all. YIELD The first crop is a small one, but it is said that the individual capsules are larger, and also that the capsules picked earliest in the year are larger than those obtained later in the season. The yield under favourable conditions is very large. In Ceylon, Owen gives 150 lbs. per acre in the fourth year, and 300 lbs. per acre in the fifth and succeeding years, as the amount which may be looked for.

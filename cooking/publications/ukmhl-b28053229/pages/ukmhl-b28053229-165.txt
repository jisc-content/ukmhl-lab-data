147 NUTMEGS AND MACE Ill 3. Singapore Mace.â€”An inferior kind, probably one of the wild island nutmegs imported into Singapore, as mace is not produced on the island. Banda mace is the aril of the true nutmeg, and is practically the same as Penang, though Penang mace is generally considered the best in the market. As met with in commerce it is pale orange brown or brownish yellow, flattened, 1-^- to If in. long, f to 1 in. wide, the forked segments having rounded axils. The tips are usually folded over into a kind of cap. The surface is dull. The flavour like that of the nutmeg, but distinct, but there is no acridity. Bombay mace is the mace of the Indian nutmeg Myristica malabarica. It is of little or no value, though it appears in commerce. It is longer than genuine mace, not flattened, of a deep reddish-brown, about 2f in. long, f to 1 in. wide, and is cut up into numerous divisions, mostly with extremely narrow axils, and more forked at the tips. It has a polished surface and a sweetish taste, somewhat mucilaginous, with a very faint flavour without any pungency (E. M. Holmes, Pharmaceutical Journal, November 21, 1908, p. 652). Bombay mace and such other maces are only used to adulterate true powdered mace. PACKING Mace is packed in casks containing about 280 lb. each. The casks are made of teak, and care is taken to seal up any cracks with dammar resin or any other suitable material, for the spice is apt to be injured seriously by any leakage of sea-water. If teak casks are unprocurable, any wood, not resinous, and sound, would do. In packing, a man stands inside the cask and treads the mace down with bare feet, while another pours it in from a basket.

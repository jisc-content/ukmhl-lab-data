The plants will grow on ridges and in inferior soil, but their fruiting powers are but small and their growth stunted. It is, therefore, unadvi^able to plant large blocks with them, as a considerable pro- portion of the land cannot fail to be unsuitable. The most successful method is to devote the banks of streams and damp hollows alone to cardamom cultivation, planting the ridges and all exposed or poor land with some hardier product.” Very damp spots, waterlogged or periodically flooded, will not suit the plant. Stiff clayey soil is equally unsatisfactory. In such places, though they may grow luxuriantly, they will give but little fruit. Climate and Altitude.—The plant is strictly a tropical one, but seems never to have been very suc- cessful south of Latitude 7° nor north of Latitude 25'. It requires a hot, rainy region, with a rainfall of 100 to 121 in. a year, and a mean temperature of 72c Fahr. The Indian varieties are found indigenous at an altitude of between 2,500 ft. and 5,000 ft. The Ceylon variety occurs chiefly in the low country. It has not been successful in the low country of the Malay peninsula, which is farther south, and has a truly equatorial climate, with heavy and continuous rains, and a some- what higher mean temperature. At the higher elevations the plants take longer to come into bearing and seem very backward for a year or two, but when they come into bearing fruit freely, says Owen. The robust Mysore variety grows and

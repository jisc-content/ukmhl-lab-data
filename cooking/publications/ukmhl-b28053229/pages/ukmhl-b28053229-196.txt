He also points out that in gathering the buds should be picked in the best condition, neither too young nor too old. The Zanzibar cloves are small and often shrivelled, and of a poor colour, much inferior to Penang and Amboyna cloves. This may be due to the slow method of drying or to carelessness of the native workman. It is probable that careful drying by heat would give finer results than can be obtained under the best circumstances by sun-heat, and in the tropics one can never depend on having good drying days wThen the cloves are ripe for gathering. In any case it would be as well to have a good drying-room available for use in wet weather, in which the temperature could be raised, or a series -of good drying ovens. The average weight of cloves produced by each tree in a season in Amboyna is given as 5 lbs., in Sumatra 6 or 7 lbs., in Penang 5 lbs., while in the Moluccas 4A lbs. is given as the usual crop. Allowing 100 trees to the acre, and that two-thirds of these are in full bearing condition, an acre will produce 375 lbs. of dry cloves. Consul Pratt of Zanzibar, in a Consular Report, estimates the produce of a tree much higher. He says a ten-year-old plantation should produce an average of 20 lbs. of cloves to a tree, and that trees of twenty years should give upwards of 100 lbs. each. This seems certainly to be exaggerated. PACKING Cloves are usually exported in gunny bags, but in Zanzibar double mat bags are used in preference. They are very liable to injury from sea-water, so that it is essential that the bags be sound and stored in a safe place on board. The best cloves are large and plump, but little wrinkled, and of a light purplish brown with

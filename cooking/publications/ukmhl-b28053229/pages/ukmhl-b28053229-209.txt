IV CLOVES 191 source of the largest part of the supply of cloves in the world, although its produce is the lowest priced of the three classes in commerce at the present day, viz. Penang, Amboyna, and Zanzibar. The cultivation attained its maximum before 1872, when its export was 10,500,000 lbs. of cloves. In this year, however, a disastrous hurricane destroyed most of the trees in Zanzibar, but those of Pemba, situated on the west side of the island, were more protected and escaped better. The cultivation is chiefly in the hands of the Arabs. Zanzibar cloves are very dry, and larger and redder than Pemba cloves, hence they are known as “ Zanzibar red-heads.” The Pemba cloves are smaller and! blacker and less dry. They are disposed of as soon as possible, as otherwise the buyer has a loss in weight from drying. The Zanzibar cloves lose about 8 per cent in weight on the passage from Zanzibar to Europe. The local trade weight is the “ frasla,” equivalent to 35 lbs. The exports from Zanzibar in 1890 are given as 124,929 fraslas, i.e. 4,372,515 lbs., and from Pemba 385,981 fraslas, or 13,509,335 lbs., altogether nearly 18,000,000 lbs. In 1891 Zanzibar produced 62,017 fraslas (2,160,595 lbs.), and Pemba 326,986 (11,564,510 lbs.). Besides the cloves, clove-stalks are shipped from Zanzibar in immense quantities. The cloves are shipped to Bombay, and also direct to Hamburg and the United States, and also, in less amount, to the Red Sea ports. They are sold at about 9 dollars for 35 lbs., about 6d. per lb. Mascarene Islands.—The cultivation in the Seychelles was practically abandoned in 1902 on account of the scarcity of labour and the irregularity of crops. In Reunion the tree was introduced in 1772 by Intendant Poivre, and cultivated well till a few years ago, but the produce was irregular in amount, and the frequency of destructive cyclones discouraged the planters. In 1820, 150,000 kilos (330,000 lbs.) were

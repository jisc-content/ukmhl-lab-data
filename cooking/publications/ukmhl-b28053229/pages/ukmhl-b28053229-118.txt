100 SPICES CHAP. Mace seems at this time to have been much more in request than nutmegs, which are hardly mentioned in these early days in Europe. The Portuguese located the home of the plant in Banda in 1512, and held the trade in these spices until they were driven out by the Dutch, who held the monopoly for many years. They endeavoured to limit the trees to Banda and Amboyna, destroying all the trees in the other islands, but it is said that the fruit pigeons more or less frustrated their efforts by swallow- ing the seeds and transporting them to other islands in the neighbourhood. The accumulations of nutmegs and mace in Holland were so large that it is said that the crops of sixteen years were in their warehouses, and in 1760 an immense quantity of nutmegs and cloves were burnt at Amster- dam to keep the prices up. Prices were very high till much later, for we read of the import price of mace in London in 1806 being 85s. to 90s. per lb., with an import duty of 7s. Id. per lb. added. But now Sir Stamford Raffles had begun to foster the cultivation of the spices in Bencoolen, in Sumatra, and in Penang, and to break down the monopoly of the Dutch. In Bencoolen he records in 1820 that he had 100,000 trees, of which one-fourth were in bearing, but on the abandonment of that settlement by the British, all cultivation disappeared and cultivation centred in Penang. IN PENANG The history of the cultivation of the nutmeg in Penang dates almost from the first colonisation of the island by the British. The founding of the settlement by Captain Light took place in 1786. At that time the Dutch had the monopoly of nutmegs and cloves, and it was hoped that it might be possible to break this monopoly down by the introduction of these spices into English colonies.

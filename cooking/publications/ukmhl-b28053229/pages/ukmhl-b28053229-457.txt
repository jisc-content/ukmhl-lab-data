439 TURMERIC XIV April 1910, at 25 cents U.S.Cy. per lb. The root has a musky odour, which is not appreciated as an adjunct to curries. As, however, the plant is commonly grown with turmeric, I include it here. GALANGAL There are two spice plants known as galangal, the lesser and the greater galangal. Both are species of the genus Alpinia, viz. Alpinia officinarum, Hance, and Alpinia Galanga, L. The former is the lesser galangal, and is the most important of the two. THE LESSER GALANGAL ~Alpinia officinarum, Hance (Scitamineae).—This plant, which belongs to the same order as the ginger, is a herb with smooth, cylindrical, reddish brown rhizomes, about or f in. through, covered with large pale sheaths, which leave a scar when fallen. The stems are 2 to 4 ft. tall, with numerous narrowly lanceolate acuminate, sheathing leaves, the blade 9 to 14 in. long. The flowers are arranged in a terminal raceme 3 or 4 in. long, of a medium size and white, with narrow petals and an ovate, entire, or bilobed lip, with a crisp or denticulate edge, f in. long, white, with dark-red veins coalescing into a fan-shaped spot near the tip. The fruit is ^ in. long, brown, tomentose. The part of this plant which is used is the rhizome, and though the spice has been known for very many centuries, the plant itself was only discovered in 1867. It was first found by Mr. Sampson at Tung-sai, on the peninsula of Lei Chan-fu, at the extreme south of China, opposite to Hoihow in Hainan, but apparently only an escape from cultivation. It was discovered later by Colonel Swinhoe, wild, in Hainan itself. History.—The earliest reference to this spice is that of the Arabian geographer Ibn Khurdabah, who wrote a work on the products and tributes of the Khalibs in a.d.

SPICES 372 CHAP. recorded, however, that in 1906 chilies to the value of £19,000 were exported, but the next export in 1908 was of the value of £485 only. Sierra Leone pepper resembles that of Zanzibar in its pungency, but is yellowish red when dried, that of Zanzibar being dull dark red. Natal red pepper imported into Europe in the form of dried pods (a variety of Capsicum annuum) is dark red and very pungent, and till recently supplied all the bright red cayenne pepper in commerce (Holmes’ Pharmaceutical Journal). There are no accessible records as to the amount of chilies or capsicums exported from Sierra Leone or Natal, but it is recorded (Blue Book of Sierra Leone, 1871, Fliickiger and Hanbury) that in 1871, 7,258 lbs. were exported from Sierra Leone, and from Natal (Blue Booh for 1871) 9,072 lbs. Turkey.—An article from the Journal de la Chambre de Commerce de Constantinople, quoted in All about Spices, says that the cultivation of red pepper occupied a very important place among the several branches of cultivation practised in Turkey in the Vilayet of Salonica. The plant there prefers a humid sandy soil, where it grows sometimes almost in water. It produces 340-80 lbs. to 1,136 lbs. per dennum (of 40 square paces), and gives a profit of 300 to 350 piastres per dennum. The greater part is exported to Europe, about one-fourth being used in Turkey. Japan supplies a large number of chilies, chiefly those of Capsicum minimum, of a peculiar bright colour, which has of late years commanded a higher price than any other variety, but is less pungent than that of Zanzibar. When powdered it is indistinguishable from Natal cayenne pepper, obtained from Capsicum annuum (Holmes, Pharmaceutical Journal, 1897, December 11, p. 519). CULTIVATION IN CALIFORNIA Mr. J. B.

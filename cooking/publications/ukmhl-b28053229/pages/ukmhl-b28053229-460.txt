442 SPICES CHAP. as a large pea, with one or two seeds. The rhizome is much larger than that of the lesser galangal. The plant is known as Lankwas by the Malays. Garcia da Orta distinguishes it from the lesser galangal, and gives a rough woodcut of its rhizome dried. As he says, it is inferior to, and weaker in strength than the true galangal. The dried rhizome is readily distinguished by its greater size, and the pale buff colour of the inside contrasting conspicuously with the orange brown outer skin. It seems to be little used except as an inferior sort of galangal. Pomet (Livre des drogues) says it is used in the manufacture of vinegar. It is sold in the Singapore markets in a fresh state for use in curries, being considered a necessary ingredient. CALAMUS ROOTâ€”SWEET FLAG Calamus root is the rhizomes of Acorus Calamus, L.. of the order Aroideae, a native of northern Asia from the Black Sea to China and Japan and North America. It occurs also in Europe as far north as Scotland and northern Russia, India, Burma, Ceylon, and the Malay region, but is probably introduced into these countries. Although, especially in the Indo-Malay region, it is chiefly valued as a drug, it is in some request for flavour- ing beer, and hence may be classed as a spice. Acorus Calamus, L., is a herb with a cylindrical rhizome, branched and emitting numerous roots, and erect, narrow, sword-like acute leaves, about 3 in. long and 1 in. wide, arranged distichously. The inflorescence is a dense cylindric spike, borne laterally upon a flattened leaf-like stem, which is terminated by a short sword-like leaf, so that it appears as if the spike were borne on the side of a leaf. The flowers are very small and closely packed together, of a green colour. The plant grows on the margins of streams, lakes, or ponds, or in damp ditches, and is commonly cultivated in small patches all over the Eastern tropics.

IV 159 CLOVES also met with under the forms of Garophul, Karpophul, and Garofalo, it is probably a word of Asiatic origin Hellenised. Rumphius, in the Herbarium Amboinense, gives the words karumpfel, calafur, or caraful as Arabic words from which caryophyllus may be derived. It is indeed probable that the Arab traders, who doubtless introduced it to Europe, introduced the Arabic name with it. Garcia da Orta, in the Historia aromatum, says that neither Dioscorides nor Galen mention it, but Kosmas Indicopleustes, in a.d. 547, mentions it as an import from China to Ceylon, and says it was thence imported to other parts of the world. It seems, there- fore, that the Chinese, who traded much with the Eastern islands, were the first to discover and use the spice. From the eighth century onwards it was regularly imported into Europe, but was very costly, being valued in 1265 at from 10s. to 12s. a pound. Marco Polo, like other writers of his date, describes it as being obtained from Java, and also from Ivaindu, a part of China. Nicolo Conti, a Venetian merchant (1424 to 1448), was the first to discover the real source of the spice, saying that it comes from Banda ; but more correct localisation was obtained by the Portuguese in the sixteenth century, and Pigafetta described the plant more fully in 1521. Garcia da Orta says that in his time it was not cultivated anywhere, but that it grew in the Moluccas, in Gilolo, and also in Ceylon and some other places, but it was not so productive any- where as it was in the Moluccas. Probably, like Marco Polo, he mistook the ports whence it was shipped, Ceylon and the other places, for the home of the plant. It was exported to Malacca, as were the other Eastern spices, for shipment to Europe. The Portuguese held control of the Spice Islands till 1605, when they were expelled by the Dutch, and by this time the plant had been introduced into Amboyna, Ley Timor, and Uliasser

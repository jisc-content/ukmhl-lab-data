219 CINNAMON VI with a small chopper, and opens the cut to see whether the bark separates readily or not. If it does not he leaves it for a future time. Some shoots never arrive at a fit state for peeling. The shoots fit for peeling are cut down and the tops and branches cut off, and the sticks collected, tied in bundles, and carried to the peeling shed. The bits left on the ground should not be removed, but used with a mulch of weeds, etc. to manure the ground, as already described. PEELING This is done with a specially made knife, small and round-pointed, with a projecting point on one side for ripping the bark off. The peeler, sitting down on the ground beside the bundle of sticks, takes one in his left hand and makes a longitudinal slit from end to end, working the knife between the bark and the wood till he has raised it \ in. wide. Then turning the stick he makes a parallel slit, and working the knife on that side detaches the slip of bark. Sticks that do not peel freely he rubs with a piece of hard wood. From time to time the slips are packed together, the convex side of one to the concave side of the next, till about 8 or 9 in. wide and about 1\ ft. long. The packs are piled in a small enclosure of sticks, and when the day’s work is done the heap is covered with scrapings and a mat is tied over it. This is called “ fermenta- tion ” by some people, but hardly amounts to that. The object is to keep the bark moist for the next operation. PIPING On the morning of the second day three sticks are driven into the ground at such an angle that they will cross each other about 1 ft. high, and tied firmly at the point of crossing. They are used for supporting one end of a fourth stick, the other end of which rests on the ground. The operator sits down on the ground, places

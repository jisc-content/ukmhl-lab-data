SPICES 6 CHAP. or dark, of the normal plant. It makes but little growth, and is liable to attacks of insects and fungi. It is, in the first place, of the greatest importance to select a suitable soil. Sandy spots, except in the case of cinnamon, water-logged soils, and soils formed almost exclusively of vegetable debris, or impregnated with salts, should be avoided. It is possible in most of these cases to improve the soils, but the cost may be too great to be worth while. In prospecting for a good site for the estate, the ground should be dug to a depth of at least two feet, in order to form an idea of the subsoil, which is often different from the surface layers. DISEASES The diseases from which plants suffer are due to insects or fungi. Bacteria, which play the chief part in diseases of animals, seem seldom to be the cause of disease among plants. The known diseases of each plant are described in each chapter dealing with the species. The careful watching for disease is one of the most important duties of the planter. No attack, however mild, should be over- looked as unimportant. In an outbreak a disease often begins very slowly, a plant here or there dies, and no notice is taken of this. More are attacked, and usually the disease appears in patches about the estate. Too often it is not until a considerable number of plants are dead or dying that the planter takes any steps to stop it. Sometimes the disease assumes a virulent nature, spreading rapidly from each centre of infection, and before the planter has time to fairly combat it, the estate may be ruined. In any case, when it has once reached the virulent stage the expenses of checking it will be great, while earlier action when the disease first showed itself would have cost but a trivial sum. A yellowing of the leaves of a plant is usually a sign that it is in an unhealthy state. It may be due to starvation from destruction of a portion of the roots, or

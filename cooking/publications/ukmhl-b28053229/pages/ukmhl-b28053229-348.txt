In some forests there would be too much of this under- growth to be left on the ground even in piles, and some would have to be removed in some way. The system of leaving the weedings, branches, etc., just pulled into heaps or lines if abundant, or left where it falls if scanty, is the plan adopted in the cultivation of gutta-percha, a shade-lover in the Malay peninsula, and I have cultivated nutmegs, cloves, camphor, and ramie in the same way. The ordinary planter, how- ever, has a horror of seeing rubbish left on the ground, and prefers an extensive and thorough conflagration, which is, of course, impracticable where shade trees are to be left. The Malabarese, according to White, recommend it as an infallible sign of fertility if the large trees on falling cause a trembling of the soil, and this he accounts for by the fact that where the soil is of great depth with a spongy mass of roots or fibres the shock of a big tree falling will be felt, while where there are strata of rocky or gravelly nature it would be less readily noticed, and thus the trembling of the earth shows that the soil is rich and deep. Ludlow, in talking of the tradition among the Coorgs, says that in olden times the people noticed that it only grew in places where the ground had been shaken by the fall of some large tree or of a large branch thrown down by the force of the wind, especially when this had happened a short time previous to the falling of the annual showers in March and April. In imitation of this during the months of February and March they selected in their jungles the largest trees and felled them, previously cutting down all the smaller surrounding trees and brushwood, which would otherwise have lessened the shock given to the ground. The mere clearing of the ground and letting in the light would account for the springing up of the plants, if their rhizomes and seeds were in the ground. Scitamineous plants frequently appear in abundance on the felling of

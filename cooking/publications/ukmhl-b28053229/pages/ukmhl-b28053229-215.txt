197 CHAPTER V PIMENTO OR ALLSPICE Pimento or allspice consists of the dried unripe fruits of Eugenia pimenta, DC. (Pimenta officinalis, Lindley), belonging to the order Myrtaceae, and to the same genus as the clove tree. The spice takes its popular name from its resemblance in perfume and taste to a mixture of cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. It is also known as Jamaica pepper. In French, Piment des Anglais, Toute-epice, Poivre de Jamaique; in German, Nelkenpfeffier, Nelkenkbpfe. The word pimento is derived from pimienta, the Spanish word for peppercorns, which the spice resembles. It was called by Redi, Pimienta de Chiapa (Chiapas in Mexico) and Pimienta de Tabasco. It seems first to have been imported into Europe about 1601, or a little later, and, according to Parkinson, substituted for round cardamoms. Ray, in 1693, distinguished it as a Jamaica spice under the name of sweet-scented Jamaica pepper or allspice.

In all 520 fraslas were obtained from the 950 trees, an average of 19-f- lbs. of cloves per tree, and a return, after paying export duty of 25 per cent, of E. 1,965. Add R38 for 43 fraslas stems, and the gross returns are E.2,003. h rom this total there are several charges to be deducted: 8 pice per bag for cloves and 5 pice for stems, amounting to R.29, were paid for conveyance to the beach on donkeys, and R76-0-0 for freight to Zanzibar, landing charges, sorting charges, import declaration, and scale fees:— 520 fraslas cloves 43 fraslas stems .... 1,965 38 Total . 2,003 Two overseers, four months .

After paying for digging the shamba (100), baskets, bags, drying mats, bakshish to overseers, etc., the year’s profit was reduced to about R 1,000. The former owner used to make E.200 to E.400 a year out of this shamba, and Arabs now attribute these good results to “ the blessing of God,” though the Canon thinks that they may be accounted for largely by the fact of his having dug the shamba over. It would be misleading to generalise from these results, because doubtless Canon Key had much in his favour: proximity to a large village and a comparatively large supply of labour, a good shamba, and a prolific season. The record is that of a prosperous year, and stands as such for what it is worth. Still, in our opinion it is worth much. The bad years that now and then occur in clove plantations, and which have contributed to their disparagement, may be accounted for by the habit of the clove trees and vicissitudes of seasons, but they may be also due to improper cultivation, or, at any rate, partly so. If clove trees will yield so roundly after years of casual management

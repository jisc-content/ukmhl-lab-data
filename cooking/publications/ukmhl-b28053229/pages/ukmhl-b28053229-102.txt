Toward the end of the article the following statement is made :— Up to the present, the large quantities of vanilla produced in the different countries—quantities which have varied between 500 and 600 tons per annum—have always found buyers. Over-production, in the true sense of the word, has thus not taken place, since there are not at pi'esent large stocks in hand. But it may be stated, definitely, that there is, on one hand, a too abundant production of vanilla, and, on the other hand, this is concurring with a large manufacture of vanillin. This forms an explanation of the low prices that have just been under consideration. 1 In 1905. 2 In 1907.

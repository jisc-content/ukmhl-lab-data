VANILLA 49 n but occasionally two or three are open at once in the same raceme. The best time for fertilisation is from eight o’clock in the morning till one or two o’clock in the afternoon. The flowers take badly when the fertilisa- tion is done during rain or in a prolonged drought, but when there has been rain on the previous day fertilisation succeeds very well. The number of flowers which can be properly fertilised by one individual in a day’s work has been variously stated. Macfarlane says that a quick worker with the vines close together and full of bloom can fertilise 3000 a day, and from 1500 to 2000 is a good average number. Some writers say that 6000 can be done by a man in the day, but this seems absolutely impossible. The day’s work commences at 7 a.m. and ends at 3 P.M., when the flowers begin to close, and are no longer fit for fertilising. METHOD OP FERTILISING The only instrument required for this operation is a small pointed stick of any kind of wood, or a splinter of bamboo, the size and shape of a toothpick, but by preference sharpened at both ends so as to save time in use, as it does not then matter which end is employed. A good number are made and carried in the brim of the hat, or in the coat, so that if one is dropped no time need be wasted in looking for it. With this instrument the operator must transfer the pollen masses to the stigma of the flower. The flower is held in the left hand and the lip pressed down so as to expose the column, which is held between the finger and thumb. The anther cap and the rostellum which covers the stigma are lifted or pushed up with the stick, the upper part of the column being so held that by the pressure of the thumb and finger the anther cup rises, exposing the pollen covered by it. Now the pollen-masses are removed by the point of the stick, to which they will adhere, and placed in the stigma below the rostellum (see page 50). E

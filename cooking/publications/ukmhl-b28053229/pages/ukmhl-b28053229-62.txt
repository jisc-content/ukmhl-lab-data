SPICES 44 CHAP. and figured by Massee in the Kew Bulletin (1892), p. 110, as Calospora Vanillae, Massee. This disease seems to have been noticed first in the Seychelles in 1887, when it was found that hundreds of pods were damping off, and it was observed that the finest and plumpest pods went first. They turned black at the end or in the middle, and in the course of it day or two fell off. The fungus which causes this is a minute species belonging to the group Peronosporeae, which attacks the leaves and stem of the plant. It appears as ex- tremely minute, dull red or amber coloured pustules springing in small groups from discoloured patches. These were found on both surfaces of the leaf, but for the most part on the upper side. This form of the fungus is known as the Hciinsea form. Its mycelium spreading through the leaf destroys the tissue and causes the death of the plant by destroying the organs on which the plant depends for its food and for the regulation of its water supply. In such a case the youngest parts, farthest from the food supply, namely the young fruit and the aerial roots, show the first symptoms of disease, the fruit turning black and falling off, as described. When the leaf has become yellow and is dying from the attack of the fungus in this stage, a second form of the fungus appears in the form of yellow waxy masses, the Cytospora form, eventually presenting a blackened appearance, and finally a third form when the leaf is dead, the Calospora form. This form produces spores which enter the stomata of the leaves and develop into the mycelium of the Hainsea form. The Hainsea form in the diseased leaves cannot re- produce itself, but from its mycelium, when the leaf is dead, are produced the Calospora spores, which can attack healthy leaves and cause the death of the plant. It therefore follows that if all dead and dying leaves of the vanilla are rigorously destroyed by burning, the disease may be checked or exterminated. The

43 II VANILLA are cut off. The result of this pruning is that flower spikes appear from all the leaf axils, and at the same time branch-buds appear lower down in great numbers. The most vigorous of these branch-buds is kept and all the others removed. The next yearâ€™s flowers will be produced from this side shoot. When the pods are ripe the whole of the branch which carries them is cut off, and only the new shoots of the previous year are kept, so that there is no waste of nutriment on the useless portion. As soon as the flower-buds appear on the second stalk, the tip of that is removed. This treatment is continued as long as the plant produces sufficient pods. Plants that have been pruned in this manner require a heavy manuring of burnt earth, leaf-mould, rotting leaves, lime and ashes. To get full success in this way, it is necessary to plant a little at a time, to leave no more stems than are required for the fruit, and to manure the plants not less than twice a year, to give plenty of light and air, and to avoid excess of moisture. Water- ing the plants, however, is necessary in the dry season. Vines grown in this manner are usually exposed to the full sun. They have a yellowish tint and are more slender, contrasting strongly with the rich deep green foliage of plants grown in the shade, but they produce a greater amount of fruit, as good in every way as that of the shade-grown plant. Delteil points out that pruning also has the advantage of keeping the plant free and light, thus avoiding the risk of accidents from high winds and hurricanes such as are common in the Mascarene and Polynesian Islands, where vanilla has been so long and extensively cultivated. DISEASES The most serious disease to which vanilla is subject appears to be one due to the attacks of a fungus described

40 SPICES CHAP. ing for the first few days only, but that depends on the climate and season. In dry weather, watering, at least in the evening, will be necessary. Even if the cuttings are planted, as soon as they are made, in the places the plant is destined to occupy, it is advisable to have a few nursery beds of young plants to use as supplies when necessary. After planting the cuttings require little attention beyond watering. If necessary keep the place clean, and renew the failures from the nursery beds. It is recommended to allow the weeds to grow round the plants for some little distance to keep the ground cool and moist, and prevent any injury from rain-wash. The best months for making the cuttings are, ac- cording to Delteil, in Reunion, November, December, January, and February, the period of heavy rains and great heat. The most suitable period naturally varies in different areas, according to the date of the com- mencement of the rainy season. In the Malay Peninsula, where there is seldom a dry period of more than a week or so at a time, almost any time of the year is suitable, as long as there does not happen to be a dry spell at the time. Should the position of the young plant be too much exposed to the sun, or the soil too dry or not sufficiently rich, the little vine will soon show this by the sickly yellow colour of its stem and leaves, and steps should be taken to remedy this. In planting the cuttings at the supports, whether tree or trellis, they should be placed in close contact with the support, in such a position that the aerial roots may be emitted against the support, and the cutting should be tied to it. The leaves and roots of the cutting itself are best removed with a sharp knife, and it is advisable to put some decaying leaves or straw round it to keep the ground damp. Delteil recommends that the cutting be covered with a layer of leaf-mould and dead leaves and straw,

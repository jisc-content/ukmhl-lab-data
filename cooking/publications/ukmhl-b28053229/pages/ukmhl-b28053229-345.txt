X 327 CARDAMOMS groweth in Calicut and Cananor ” (places on the coast of Malabar). The greater cardamom he refers to is doubtless the Nepal cardamom. Garcia da Orta writes of the two true cardamoms, and says that the long cardamom comes from Ceylon. The spice, as imported, was for very many years obtained from wild plants, both in Malabar and Ceylon. The custom was to fell the trees and cut down the brushwood, only a few big trees being left as shade, and the seedlings of the cardamoms were left to spring up. When ripe the fruit was gathered. The ground was cleared of brushwood every year till the plants were exhausted, and then the spot was abandoned and a new clearing made. This system was in use as the only method till 1803 at least, as mentioned by White in his paper on Malabar cardamoms. The demand, however, of later years being too large for this method sufficing for the supply, cultivation on a large scale became the rule, and it has since been an important industry in Ceylon and India. NAMES Most of the Indian names of the spice are derived from the Sanskrit Eta, such as Elachi (Hindu and Bengali), Yelaki (Kanarese), Eletari (whence the name of the genus Elettaria), Malabar Pala, Bhala (Burmese), Hila (Arabic).

The Malays use the word Kapulaga. CULTIVATION Soil.—The plant being naturally an inhabitant of the forests, requires a soil rich in humus. White de- scribes its locality in Malabar thus : “ Lofty hills whose summits are ever clothed with clouds, a moist atmo-

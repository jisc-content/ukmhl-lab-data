416 SPICES CHAP. record as to whether the cultivation has been carried on later to any extent. Barbados.—Mr. J. R. Bovell gives some account of cultivation experiments here in 1898 (Barbados Botanical Station, Occasional Bulletin, No 9, 1898). The object of these experiments was to find a payable substitute for sugar in fields affected by a cane-disease, while the fields were recovering from the presence of the fungus. The first experiment was made with blue ginger, which gave a return of 19,420 lbs. an acre. Next year both blue and yellow were tried, with the result that the blue gave a crop of 18,150 lbs. to the acre, the yellow 17,226 lbs. When the ginger had been scraped and dried it weighed, of blue 3,076 lbs., of yellow 3,794 lbs. For valuation four samples were sent to Messrs. Wilkinson and Caviller, London, who reported on them as follows :— Sample 1. Whole rhizomes of yellow valued 75s. per cwt. „ 2. „ blue „ 73s. to 74s. „ ,, 3. Pieces of yellow ,, 70s. to 71s. „ ,, 4. ,, blue „ 68s. to 70s. ,, The average value was 70s. per cwt. The firm recommended that ginger of these qualities should not be sorted into grades, but should be sold without sorting, as this ginger would only do for grinding. Only very carefully selected ginger of the finest quality should be separated out as a grade. About this time a consignment of nine barrels of Barbados ginger was sold at auction in London (June 15, 1898). The parcels were not of first quality, but fetched 73s. 6d. per cwt. The reporters said: “The parcels showed a large proportion of nearly green ginger, which of course lessens the value, as dry hard ginger of good strength will always command a market, whereas on a slack market undesirable stuff, viz. green or dirty, is very difficult of sale.” The value of Jamaica ginger of middling quality was then 80s. to 85s. per cwt. The gentleman who shipped this ginger wrote that

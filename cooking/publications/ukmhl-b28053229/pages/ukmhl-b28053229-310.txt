SPICES 292 CHAP. 1875-1876 to 1879-1880 as much as 7,322,176 lbs. This import trade decreased, in 1883 to 1889, to less than half, but rose the next year to 5,707,147 lbs. Nearly all ol this was derived from the Straits Settle- ments. Of late years the cultivation has been much disturbed by the several diseases which became very serious (see Pests and Diseases). Steps, however, have been taken to remedy these evils, which seem to have been largely due to constant propagating from cuttings. In Ceylon.—Pepper is said to have been one of the earliest exports from Ceylon. When this island came under the rule of the Dutch, some attention was paid to its cultivation, and in 1739 it is recorded that they exported 465,000 lbs., the greater part of which was derived from the Kandyan provinces. After the island passed into English hands, the pepper cultivation declined, and though a little was grown for local con- sumption, nothing further was done till about 1879, when it again attracted the attention of planters, and several restarted the cultivation. The plant seems to have grown well, even to an altitude of 2,000 ft., and the produce was considered to be of very good quality, but perhaps from a fall in price the cultivation seems soon after to have lapsed again, and little more has been heard of it for some years. Malay Peninsula.—Linschoten mentions much pepper as being grown around Malacca in 1583, but at that time there was little trade in it there to Portugal, for he says that it was “two years between ea<?h shippe which sailed thence,” and though each ship took some pepper, it was chiefly loaded up with cloves and nut- megs, and other merchandise of China. Most of the local-grown pepper went to Pegu, Syon (probably Siam), and China. Garcia da Orta (1593) says that pepper, in his time, grew in Malacca by the sea, but was inferior in quality et magna ex parte inane, by which I presume he means flavourless.

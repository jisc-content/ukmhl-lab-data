The under- side of the upper wings and a bar across the thorax are sooty in colour. This insect does not seem particular as to what ginger plants it attacks, so long as the stems are not too thick. Stems attacked by it should be cut off and destroyed. It is not, however, easy to see it till it has thoroughly bored through the stem and practically killed it. PREPARATION OF RHIZOMES For local use in curry, turmeric is generally used fresh without any preparation except washing, and quantities are sold for this purpose in the native markets of Singapore and elsewhere in the East. In Bengal, it is said that after the roots are dug out of the ground they are freed from the fibrous roots and cleaned. They are then put into earthen pots, the mouths of which are carefully closed with earthenware covers and cow-dung. The pots are very gradually heated. The turmeric is made to boil in its own juice, which process gets rid of the raw smell of turmeric. It is then dried in the sun for a week or nearly as long, during which it requires to be covered in the night to protect it from dew. In some places it is boiled in water in which a little cow-dung is mixed (Report of the Agricultural Department, p. 55). x Sir E. C. Buck says in the north-west provinces the roots are boiled and dried in the sun, and in this form they are the turmeric sold in the Indian bazaars. For making the yellow dye the roots are boiled again, and powdered while wet and made into a paste. In the Kurnaon district the roots are soaked in lime-juice and borax before being powdered instead of being boiled. In the Punjab, Baden-Powell says the rhizomes are taken up in November, and dried partly by the heat of the sun and partly by fire. In Coimbatore, it is said 2 F

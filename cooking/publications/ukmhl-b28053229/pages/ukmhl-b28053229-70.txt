52 SPICES CHAF. The period during which fertilisation can be carried on and the number of flowers which can be fertilised during the period are shown by the returns of the number of flowers fertilised in a vanillery at Mayotte in 1895. From June 1 to 20 5-280 „ June 21 to July 20 . 8-820 ,, July 21 to Aug. 20 . 233-150 „ Aug. 21 to Sept. 20 . 1-209-640 „ Sept. 21 to Oct. 20 . 524-340 Total 1-981-230 Thus in this region August to September gives the highest return of flowering (Wildeman). The importance of the suitability of the weather during the flowering and fruiting season is shown by the returns given by Dr. Galbraith from a plantation in the Seychelles. 1893.

It takes, however, about four months to become fully ripe. Macfarlane gives nine as the period required for ripening. Delteil says six to seven in Bourbon, or in Cochin-China three to four. In the Straits Settlements I find it takes about four. Delteil considers this quicker ripening unsatisfactory, the fruits being smaller and less powerfully scented. Probably much depends on the weather at the time. I found in Singapore that heavy storms of rain seriously affected the ripening of the fruit, often causing them to fall unripe, and the ripening season, January and February, is unfortunately usually the wettest time of the year in this region.

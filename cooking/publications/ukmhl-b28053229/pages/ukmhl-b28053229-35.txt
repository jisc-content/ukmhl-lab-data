17 ] INTRODUCTION but not water-logged. Small drains should be made to carry off the water in case of heavy rain. The shading should not be too heavy, and should be from 2 to 3 ft. above the soil. Seeds and plants should not be planted too close together. The actual distance depends on the size of the plant before removing. The greater the size of the young plants, the farther apart they should be planted. Thus nutmegs, which remain longer in the nursery bed than most plants, should be at least a foot apart. Occasionally, in the case of small seeds as those of capsicum, there is a considerable loss due to the raids of ants, which remove the seed and devour it. Upon finding a seed-bed the ants often transfer the whole nest to the nursery. These can be destroyed with insecticides, or the bed may be flooded for a short time, in order to drive them out. In planting in lines do not place each plant exactly opposite the one in the next line, but half-way between. This, the quincunx arrangement is now adopted by most planters for all trees. In holing, make the holes wide enough and deep enough, 2 ft. each way being a good size. Mix and break up the soil and manure well before filling in, allowing a 6-in. mound above the ground level in which to put the plant, so that when the soil sinks, as it will after a few days, the surface will be a little above or on the level of the ground, not below it. Otherwise you will find that the sunken pit in which the plant stands will become a catch hole for the rain, the soil eventually becoming water-logged and foul. Draining to some extent is necessary on almost every estate. The depth and size of the drains depends on the location and on the amount of water in the soil. Care must be taken to see that the drains are kept open and do not silt up. If possible, they should be made before planting and while the plants are in the nursery. c

88 SPICES CHAP. resulted in making the French market more important than the London market, and that the Seychelles vanilla is now going there in consequence. In that market he is now paying from 36 to 40 francs per lb. for vanillas which, three years ago, he bought for 12 to 15 francs per lb. We mention these high figures to show you the impossibility of giving you any actual idea of probable prices, for we have seen vanillas here which are not quoted at more than $2.50 per lb. They are, of course, not Bourbon or Mexican vanillas, and are not well dried or well packed. These considerations serve to show the conditions in the different markets, and must be taken into account before, in any particular instance, the matter is discussed in relation to the agricultural aspect. They should be helpful in giving some idea of the purely commercial tenor of the subject (Agricultural News, vol. ix. p. 53).

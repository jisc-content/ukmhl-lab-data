It takes the form of headache, gastric trouble, and urtication, or a kind of rash. The latter is perhaps caused by the crystals of oxalate of lime, which are so abundant all through the plant. The juice of the leaves and stalks of some species at least is very irritating to the skin, and the leaf of the cultivated vanilla is used as a blistering agent in Reunion. That of the wild species of the Malay Peninsula, which produces a considerable amount of irritation on the softer part of the skin, is used by the Malays as a stimulant to the growth of the hair.

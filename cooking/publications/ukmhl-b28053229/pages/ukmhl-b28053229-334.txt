SPICES 310 CHAP. Uses.â€”Long pepper contains the same principles as black pepper, a volatile oil, resin and piperin, and it is used ground up as a spice in the same way as ground pepper, chiefly by natives. As a drug, both the spikes and the dried root and shoots are used by natives. Like black pepper, it has practically gone out of the European Pharmacopoeia, except an occasional use as a stimulant in compound medicines. In native medicines it is especially valued in coughs and catarrhs, and usually mixed with honey for these complaints. It is valued also in indigestion and colic, possessing stimulant and carminative pro- perties similar to those of black pepper, but more powerful, and also by Indians in paralysis, tetanus, and apoplexy, as a liniment for snake-bite, and in the form of a snuff for coma and drowsiness. The roots are used for the same purposes, but are considered weak in action. Piper officinarum, L., Javanese Long Pepper, Chabei (Malay) This long pepper differs from the Indian long pepper in its leaves not being cordate or deeply incised at the base. The lower leaves are lanceolate acuminate at the tip, with a rounded but entire base; they are smooth, dark green above and pale beneath, 3 in. long, 1^ in. wide, with a petiole ^ in. long. The upper leaves are much larger ovate, 6 in. across and a little longer, the base rounded, broad, the tip acute. The stem is about i in. thick, and grey in colour. The inflorescence is much like that of the Indian long pepper, but the spike is less broad at the base and the tip less blunt. When ripe it is red, and when dry it is of the same grey colour as the Indian one, but more pungent. Otherwise it is almost exactly like it. It is grown from cuttings, and, if allowed, would climb very high. The Javanese train it to a stake, and prune it back to about 5 ft. from the ground. Unless this is done they say it would never flower. When

20G SPICES CHAP. stout trunk, much branched low down, about 1 or 2 ft. through, with thick grey bark. The whole tree is very bushy, with strong branches forming a fairly compact and large head. The form and size of the leaves is varied. In some cases rounded ovate and quite obtuse, in others ovate-lanceolate to obtuse; the base is rounded, the apex more or less acuminate, but blunt. In the round-leaved form the apex is often quite rounded and not at all acuminate. In texture and colour they are firm, coriaceous, deep green, paler beneath, rather brittle. They have three or five conspicuous nerves joined at the base of the leaf, and running to the tip, paler green or almost yellow. The length of the leaves varies from 3 to 7 in., the width from 2 to 4 in. The petiole is ^ to 1 in. long. The flowers are borne in lax panicles on long peduncles from the upper axils of the branches, or from the ends of the branches, on long pubescent peduncles 2 or 3 in. long. The branches of the panicles are ^ in. in length, lengthening in fruit. The flowers are small and yellow, Â£ in. long. The perianth tube is campanulate; the segments, six in number, oblong lanceolate acute, pubescent. Stamens, nine complete, the outer six opposite the six perianth lobes. They have a hairy filament and a four-celled anther (the cells opening by valves), and a pair of glands at the base. There are three staminodes, or barren stamens. The ovary is superior, one-celled, and one-ovuled. The fruit is ovoid, a black fleshy drupe, with the enlarged perianth lobes at the base forming a cup. HISTORY Cinnamon seems to have been one of the earliest known spices, but it appears to be doubtful whether the spice mentioned in the earlier writings was cinnamon or cassia bark (Cinnamomum cassia). This latter was undoubtedly imported into Arabia in very early days from China, whence there was an extensive commercial intercourse from the earliest historic times. Both

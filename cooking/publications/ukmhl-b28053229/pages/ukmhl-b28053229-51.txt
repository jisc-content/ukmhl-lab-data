33 VANILLA II many planters use hardwood posts and bars, the bars resting in notches in the top of the posts. They are put at a height of from 4 to 6 ft. from the ground, and the plants being brought over them and looped up as they grow too long. Wire is sometimes used in place of bars of wood, but though it has the advantage of being cheaper, it has other disadvantages. The vines are apt to break over so thin a support. When the plants thicken into a mass there is no fear of this. Distancing.—In the earlier days of cultivation in the Seychelles the vines were planted so closely that the workers could hardly pass between them. The yield per acre was enormous, but when the disease got among the vines the destruction was so rapid and complete that this close planting was abandoned and more space left among the vines. About 9 ft. apart is the distance recommended. Preparation of the Ground.—It is not at all desir- able to clear the ground by felling and burning, as is so commonly done in tropical agriculture. The waste of good plant food by burning is very great, and though in the case of many cultivations it is the most inexpensive method of clearing the ground in the way it requires, there is no need for this in the case of vanilla. The ground should be opened up by cutting down all scrub and unnecessary trees; afterwards chopping them to pieces and allowing them to decay in situ so as to form food for the vanilla. In the case of the ground being bare of shade trees and open and exposed to the sun, banana plants, or in Mexico maize, are utilised as shade for the young- plant until the trees on which it is intended to let the vanilla climb are sufficiently tall to give the necessary shade. Delteil recommends the planter also to plant a hedge of red hibiscus round the plantation to protect the plants from the wind, especially when the site selected is on the seashore. Whether this is necessary or not will depend on the position and exposure of the planta- D

GINGER 401 XIII In the Punjab the leaves are laid over the beds and the manure is laid on the top of them, so that under the influence of the heavy rains of the wet season it gradually soaks in. The system of mulching with dead leaves, cut grass, etc., might be practised more largely for all crops in the East than it is, but it is desirable to bury the mulch with a little soil, as less of the products of decay are lost.

Horse-dung is rarely used here in any cultivation, unless it has been rotted for some years, as it is considered too hot, but old, well- decomposed stable manure, especially when mixed with cow-dung, is very suitable for all cultivations of this type. PREPARATION OP THE SPICE There are two forms in which ginger is usually prepared for the market, viz. dried or cured ginger and preserved or green ginger. In the West Indies and India the spice is prepared as dry ginger, while China supplies the greater part, indeed practically all, of the preserved ginger. DRIED GINGER After the rhizomes are dug up they are cleaned of dirt and the roots cut away, and then are sometimes pre- pared for market by merely gradually seething or scald- ing them in hot water, after which they are spread out every day in the sun till they are sufficiently dry, and packed in parcels of 100 lbs. for the market. This is called Black Ginger. In scalding the rhizomes, a large pot or copper is fixed in the field or some convenient place, and kept full of boiling water. The ginger, cleaned of 2 D

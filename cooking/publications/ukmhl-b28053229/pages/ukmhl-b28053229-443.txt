425 XIV TURMERIC Sawyer, in the Agricultural Journal oj Indict, rv. p. 87, mentions three forms known from Toungoo with local names—Sanwingale, the lesser turmeric; Sanwingye, greater turmeric (perhaps the tubers and rhizomes respectively); and Sanwinpyi, white turmeric with buff-coloured rhizomes and a scent of mangos (perhaps Curcuma amada). It is not used, and is considered to be injurious when it appears with the true turmeric. The first named is considered the best, the second is coarser. The form used in India for dry- ing, known generally as Lok-nandi-haladi, seems to be° a distinct variety with harder rhizomes and richer colouring matter. CULTIVATION The soil selected for turmeric should be rich and friable. Loamy soil, even of very inferior quality, however, will give good results, and even where the ground is sandy it does very well. “ In Toungoo,” says Mr. A. M. Sawyer (Agricultural Journal of India, 1909, iv. p. 87), “the Shans prefer light, free, sandy loams, overlying the yellowish and reddish sub-soils of the Toungoo district. The turmeric,” he says, “ is cultivated by the Shans very carefully. The locality consists of forest-clad hills and dales intersected by winding streams whose waters are clear in the dry months. When it rains, the streams carry a good deal of silt which fertilises the cultivated land in the low valleys.” In the Malay peninsula, the Chinese grow it in the same kind of land as they use for ginger, and treat it in the same way. The stiffer clays they break up with the hoe and render friable, and by adding manure obtain good results. The low-lying black soils of old rice fields or river alluvia seem to suit it equally well. Compared with ginger I find it is a stronger plant, and will grow well where the soil is quite sandy, which ginger will not. In parts of India it is grown as an alternate crop with pulses. In Coimbatore it is stated that it is generally grown as a mixed crop

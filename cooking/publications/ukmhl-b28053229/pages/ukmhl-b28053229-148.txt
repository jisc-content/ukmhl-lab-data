It is imperative, therefore, to prevent the beetles from increasing in such numbers that it becomes im- possible to check them, and this can be done by destroying by burning all sticks that can furnish them with a breeding-ground. It is more difficult to prevent them from attacking the underground part of the stem. I observed, however, that the better class of cultivators were in the habit of covering the ground beneath the tree with cut grass, the common grass known in Malay regions as lalang (Imperata cylindrica) being the grass used, and that trees so treated suffered less from the beetles. This mulching also serves to protect the high-lying roots from the excessive sun-heat, and also supplies a certain amount of nutriment. If a tree, however, has got badly attacked, and it may be considered worth while to try and save it, all affected bark should be cut off and burnt, and tar or lime-wash liberally applied. The underground part of the stem, which is often difficult to get at on account of the close network of roots, could be treated by pick- ing over the soil and loosening it, and pouring over a strong solution of some insecticide, and mulching with cut grass or dead leaves. The Mango-Borer.â€”The caterpillar of a fairly large moth, which is commonly found in the Malay Peninsula boring in the branches of the mango tree, occasionally attacks the nutmeg when there are mango trees in the immediate neighbourhood. Probably this only appears when there are not sufficient mango trees for the moth to lay its eggs on, and may be classed as an accidental attack. Aphis or greenfly occurs occasionally on sickly or weak trees. A small pycliid moth caterpillar, which makes a kind of case for itself out of bits of leaf, I have met with browsing on the stigmas of the female flowers.

II 47 VANILLA reason they do not visit the flowers, or if they do so, fail to fertilise them, and there seems to be scarcely a case recorded of natural fertilisation of the plant under cultivation. It is, therefore, necessary to fertilise the flowers of the plant by hand in order to procure fruit. This, though a matter of some delicacy and skill, is by no means a difficult operation, and can be easily carried out by natives with a little training. HAND FERTILISATION Vanilla planifolia flowers but once a year, usually from September to November, but often beginning as early as June and July. Occasionally it flowers in March, bub this appears to be generally considered as an indication of an unhealthy state of the vine. V. pompona, according to Macfarlane, gives in Tahiti two crops of flowers, with occasionally a few flowers at other seasons. The main season begins about the middle of July, and lasts till September. The second usually begins early in the year, in January, running through February into March. He suggests that both kinds of vanilla should be cultivated on the estate, as they flower at different times, and so the estate can be kept working most of the year with one or the other kind. V. pompona is not as strong a grower as V. plani- folia. Indeed, in the Singapore Botanic Gardens, where the two plants were grown on one tree, planifolia after a few years smothered the pompona and killed it out. Neither are the pods of pompona very highly valued, so that in most places it dropped out of cultivation. Still for the reason given above it might be successfully grown, and add to the profits of the estate. A good strong vanilla plant in full vigour should produce as many as 200 bunches or racemes of flowers at a time. Each raceme carries from 15 to 20 flowers, or even more. Mr. Hart of Trinidad gives as many as 30 to 40 flowers to a raceme. Thus under good condi- tions a plant can give 4000 flowers.

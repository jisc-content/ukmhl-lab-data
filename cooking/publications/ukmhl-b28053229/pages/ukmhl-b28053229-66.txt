SPICES 48 CHAP. Iii no case, however, should all or nearly all of the flowers be fertilised; opinions vary as to how man}' should be fertilised on each raceme, but it is generally agreed that some of the terminal flowers should be removed. In some cases ten fruits may be allowed to ripen on each raceme; in the case of weaker plants two or three are quite enough. Macfarlane, in dealing with Vanillai pompona, would fertilise from 8 to 15 flowers on each raceme, and later removing the shorter beans, would reduce the number from 6 to 12, fertilising one-fifth more flowers than he intended to keep. Vanilla planifolia should have fewer developing fruits kept than F. pompona. If the price is highest for the longest fruits, as indeed it usually is, it is recommended to reduce the number of flowers to be fertilised to fewer, and so get a smaller number of large first-class fruits in preference to a larger number of smaller ones. In order to prevent the plants from being soon worn out by over-production, Delteil recommends that the plantation should be divided into four equal portions, and that only one of these should be fertilised each year. Thus at the end of four years from the time that the plants commence to flower the whole vanillery will have undergone fertilisation once only and, thanks to this prudent method, the plants which have had a rest of three years between each crop will last a very long time and will not be worn out in a few years. Thus the planter, though he gets a smaller return at first, will be certain of seeing his crops constant for many years without the necessity of replanting. The flowers remain open for one day only, so that if there is a heavy bloom on the plants extra labour will be required during the flowering season. Women and children are generally employed for the work of fertilising the flowers, as they are quicker and more skilful with their fingers than men. The flowers open one by one on the raceme each day,

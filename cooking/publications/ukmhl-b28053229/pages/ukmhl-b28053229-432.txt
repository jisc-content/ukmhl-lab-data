414 SPICES CHAP. self. After some difficulties in drying he managed to prepare samples which were attractive in appearance, and of good colour and flavour. Messrs. Lewis and Peat reported that it was good, plump, white, part hard and part soft, and valued at 40s. to 42s. per cwt. Messrs. W. and D. Harvest valued it at 34s. to 36s. per cwt., and considered it very inferior to the ordinary East Indian ginger, or to that produced in the island of Jamaica, being rather hard and unsuitable for many pur- poses for which ginger is used. It much resembled that from Japan. Shortly after this correspondence passed, a note on this ginger appeared in the Pharmaceutical Journal, March 26, 1892, p. 802, by Mr. E. H. Gane. This stated that it was “ remarkable for its exceeding fine aroma and peculiar pleasant taste, recalling that of lemon,” though it was not of such fine appearance as the Jamaica ginger. The rhizomes, which had been carefully dried, as was evidenced by the small amount of moisture present, were rather more fibrous that that of Jamaica, and some of the pieces were heavy and resinous, but otherwise the colour appeared similar. Its powder is of slightly darker colour than a fine Jamaica ginger, but about the same colour as the commercial article and, therefore, much lighter than either Cochin or African. The fine lemon-like odour is much more distinct in the powder. A tincture of ginger made with alcohol was found to be darker than that of Jamaica ginger, and more aromatic and pungent. Some interesting analyses of the different kinds of ginger are given :— Jamaica. Cochin. Africa. Fiji. per cent. per cent. per cent. per cent.

The disease, however, appears to be rare, and I have never come across another instance of it. Loranthi.â€”The mistletoes attack the clove tree as they do the nutmegs (which see), and in Penang I have seen also the parasite Cassytha strangling the branches. It is a yellow, wiry, leafless plant, belonging to the order Lccurinecte, but having more of the appearance of a dodder. This plant only grows on the sea-shore, so that it is not of frequent occurrence in a clove estate, and its presence on a clove tree is evidence of gross neglect. The clove tree in damp spots, or where too closely planted, is very apt to be covered with mosses and hepatics, which grow on the branches as epiphytes. These, though not parasitic, as the mistletoes, but only growing on the outside of the bark, are not beneficial to the tree, but appear to be rather injurious, often interfering with the growth of the twigs and causing the death of the smaller branches. These mosses should be pulled off and the tree cleaned of all such epiphytic growths. CROPPING The clove tree commences to produce flower-buds in the fourth or fifth year after planting, in Penang and Zanzibar. If the soil is inferior it is said to take longer, from six to six and a half years. In the Moluccas from six to eight years is the period given. The buds are ready for gathering in August to December in Zanzibar, and about a month later, that is to say, from November to January, in the Straits Settlements. In the Moluccas the harvest takes place twice a year, namely in July and December. Just before the buds are produced there is a fresh flush of young leaves put forth, and soon after this the

SPICES 226 CHAP. VI 24 tons of bark are annually exported from the tract between Ramganga and the Sarda. The outer bark yields on distillation an essential oil. From 1 cwt. of bark § lb. oil is obtained. The oil has a pale yellow colour and a smell of cinnamon oil, although very inferior to it in quality. It is chiefly used in the manu- facture of soap, especially what is called military soap.1 Bark and leaves are both used in native medicine for colic, diarrhoea, and other bowel ailments. 1 Piesse and Lnbin, in Watt’s Dictionary.

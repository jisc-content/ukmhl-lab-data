57 II VANILLA This stage is recognised by the pod becoming flexible and the skin of a uniform deep chocolate brown, and marked with longitudinal furrows. Over-exposure to the sun makes them dry, of a reddish colour, and less aromatic. They are now removed to a drying-house, usually roofed with zinc, with windows opened during the middle of the day. Here they are arranged on tables, preferably of rattan or perforated, so that a free current of air may circulate round them. The pods remain for about a month or a little more, during which time they require to be frequently turned, so that they dry evenly. Those that are sufficiently dry are removed for packing. They should be black and sufficiently supple to be twisted easily round the finger without cracking. Before sorting, however, the pods are smoothed by passing through the fingers repeatedly, for the pods exude an oil during fermentation, which gives them their suppleness and lustre. 5. Potiers Process, invented by J. Potier.â€”The pods are plunged in rum for twenty to thirty days, then exposed to the air for thirty-six to forty-eight hours without completely drying. Then they are re- placed in the rum, and so shipped. The inventor claims that the process is simple, and that the rum can be used as a flavouring agent as well as the pods. This process is not recommended ; for one thing, it is too expensive. DRYING BY CALCIUM CHLORIDE This method was described in a Report of the British Consul in Reunion in 1897, and the description was republished in the Kew Bulletin for 1898, p. 43. The process of drying is as follows : the pods are put in tin cases (old petroleum oil tins were used), which are fitted with lids closing on the outside of the case and lined with wool. The pods are placed on end, close enough to secure pressure without damage by rubbing. A horizontal layer was put over this, the woollen cover

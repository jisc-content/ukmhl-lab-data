28 SPICES CHAV. and it was formerly grown with some success in Ceylon. It will be noticed that the greatest success has been obtained in insular climates, and possibly proximity to the sea may be an important factor in its successful cultivation. In the Seychelles Islands, which have been famous for the cultivation of this spice, the temperature varies from 90° to 70 Fahr., rarely going as low as 67', the commonest temperature being 80°. The rainfall is 100'8 in., evenly distributed throughout the year, but a dry spell is looked for from July to September. The heaviest rains occur in December, but the air is always moist. In the Seychelles it appears that the heavy rains of December do not affect the crops so much as irregular rains in August, for the Curator of the Botanic Station in his Report for 1905, states that the weather was very promising until the end of July, but the rain fell abundantly in August and September, and the vanilla vines put forth new growth instead of flowering, and he therefore predicts a consequent reduc- tion in the crop of pods. The Colonial Office Report gives the following table of rainfall and temperature for Victoria, in the Seychelles, for five years :— Rainfall. Maximum shade temperature. Minimum shade temperature. 1901 102-26 F. 88-5 68-4 1902 87-81 S8-0 68-0 1903 132-96 88-5 68-0 1904 106-74 87-2 68-2 1905 88-91 88-0 71-0 The average daily maximum was 83'5 and the minimum 78'3. The average rainfall was 100'8, but the value of the rainfall is measured not so much by the inches as by the distribution. Thus in 1904,

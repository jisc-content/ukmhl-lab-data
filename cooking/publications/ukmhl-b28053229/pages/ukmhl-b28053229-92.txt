The vine here grows up to an altitude of 2500 ft. In Great Comoro 45,000 vines gave, in 1901, 1060 kilos of pods.

Anjouan Island possesses 1,200,000 vanilla plants, which gave, in 1901, 16, and in 1902, 18 tons of pods. Mayotte possessed, in 1901, 500,000 vines, giving 13,000 kilos of pods, valued at 40,000 francs.

vui PEPPERS 287 “ Arsina Murtiga ” 1^ lb. per year, and “ Sambar ” only § lb. In Cambodia, M. Adhemar Leclerc (Revue des cultures coloniales, VI. ii. p. 117) states that 400 vines in full bearing give from 8 to 12 piculs a year. A picul is 133 lbs., so that this makes 1,064 to 1,596 lbs. a year for 400 plants, or 2^ to nearly 4 lbs. a vine. In the Bulletin 'economique de V Indo-Chine, 1907, p. 371, M. Le Ray states the average production of a pepper plantation from five to twenty-two years old is very variable, not only from year to year, but also in different spots, according to the amount of care taken in cultivation, and also as to the planter, whether European or Chinese. He gives the following estimates by planters and officials in Cambodia :—M. Bouillod declares that more than 3 lbs. a vine cannot be expected, M. Blanc 3^ lbs., and M. Malescot about 3|- lbs.; a planter, M. Blanc, says that the average of the vines in good plantations give a little less than 3 lbs. M. Apavou gives the following table as the scale of production of 100 plants of from five to twenty-two years of age :— Kilos per plant. Exceptionally good . 3‘000 1 plant Kilos. . 3-000 Very good . . 2-400 20 plants . 48-000 Fine . . 2-100 30 „ . 63-000 Fairly good . 1-600 30 „ . 48-000 Passable . . 1-000 20 „ . 24-700 Total for 100 plants . 186-700 CURING or 311£ lbs.

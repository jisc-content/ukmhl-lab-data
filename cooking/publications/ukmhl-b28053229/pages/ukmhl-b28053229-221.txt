PIMENTO OR ALLSPICE V 203 OTHER USES The allspice is chiefly used for flavouring con- fectionery, pickles, and other such foods. The ripe fruits are used to make a native drink known as “ pimento dram.” Allspice is used in medicine as an aromatic, in the form of pimento-oil or a distilled water—Aqua Pimentae. It is administered for flatulency, or for overcoming griping in purgatives, and locally in rheu- matism and neuralgia. Oil of pimento is a yellow to brownish oil con- taining eugenol, and with practically the same qualities as clove oil. The berries contain 3 to 4^ per cent of oil, which sells at about 6s. a pound. Most of the oil is contained in the pericarp, but the seeds are also aromatic. PIMENTO STICKS In Jamaica, saplings of pimento were so highly valued as walking-sticks and for umbrella-sticks that some alarm was felt lest the dealers in sticks should uproot all the young trees. An article in the Scientific American, quoted by Bernays in Cultural Industries of Queensland, says that in that year half a million of umbrella-sticks were awaiting export at Kingston, Jamaica, to England and the United States, all or almost all being pimento. The average returns for five years showed that 2,000 bundles of sticks were exported from Jamaica annually, and the first three-quarters of 1881 showed an export of over 4,500 bundles, valued at 15,000 dollars. The bundles contained 50 sticks each. These sticks were valued at from l^d. to 3-|d. each. Espeut (Timbers of Jamaica), after referring to the destruction caused by the stick gatherers, urges planting pimento for the stick trade. He estimates that an acre planted for sticks would yield £300 in five years.

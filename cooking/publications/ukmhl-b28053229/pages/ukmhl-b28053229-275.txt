257 VIII PEPPERS with nearly equal vigour in all varieties of soil, between the two extremes of sand which prevailed near the coasts, and the stiff yellow clays of the hills. Sand, however, is quite unsuitable for the plant unless mixed at least with a good proportion of humus, and it is, as a rule, advisable to avoid land which can be definitely classed as sandy. Rocky soil is equally objectionable, though in Ceylon it was said that pepper grew very well over rocks. Under light shade it might do well, provided that the soil between the rocks is rich enough for the plant, but exposed rocks are so strongly heated by the tropical sun that pepper would soon be destroyed by the excessive heat. CULTIVATION FROM SEED Black pepper is almost invariably grown from cuttings, but it may be grown from seed. It is stated that pepper vines grown from seed take a very long time to fruit, and indeed it has been said that in some localities they will not fruit at all from seed. In this case they probably revert to the unisexual form, i.e. the original wild form; on the other hand, there are many places, at least, where pepper is readily raised from seed and grows well and quickly. It is certainly preferable to grow from cuttings, as it is then possible to be sure that a good heavy fruiting strain can be secured, cuttings generally coming true more frequently than seedlings. There are cases, however, where, for some reason or other, it is necessary to raise pepper from seed. Thus in some parts of the world it has been found expensive or almost impossible to introduce pepper by cuttings, which have to travel in a Wardian case, and seed is the only form in which the plant can be introduced. Seed of pepper is, however, by no means a good traveller, and has often failed in cases of long- distance travelling. It is said (Simmondâ€™s Tropical Agriculture) that in Malabar it is often raised from seed, and that s

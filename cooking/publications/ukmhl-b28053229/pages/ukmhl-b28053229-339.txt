LONG PEPPER IX 321 from which spring the large and delicate flowers. In these the corolla has one erect lanceolate lobe, and two narrow linear ones, white or pale violet, and a large, spreading, fan-shaped lip, white tinted with rose, with a red and yellow blotch at the base. The fruit is pear- shaped, 3 or 4 in. long, red or orange, and containing a large number of very small seeds. The seeds are T]<y in. through, hard, roundish, oval, bluntly angular, golden brown in colour, aromatic and pungent. A good figure of this handsome plant is given in Roscoe’s Scitamineae PI. and also in Trimen’s Medical Botany and in Johnson’s Liberia.

The plant was cultivated in Demerara some years ago and throve there, producing fruit 5 in. long, but I find no record of the plant being there now, in referring to the Garden reports of British Guiana, Surinam, etc. History.—This spice was, it appears, earliest known under the name Melegetae, a word derived from Melle (Meli or Mely), a name for an empire in the upper Niger country, formerly inhabited by the Mandingos. The word is also commonly spelt Melegueta, Mellegette, Mallaguetta, Manigeta, and Maniguetta, and the country whence it was obtained was called by the Portuguese Terra de Malaguet, or Costa di Maniguetta, and also was known as the Grain Coast, or Pepper Coast, from this spice. It does not appear that the spice was known to the ancients, and the earliest record of it is in an account of a festival held at Treviso in 1214, in which an imitation fortress, held by twelve ladies and their Y

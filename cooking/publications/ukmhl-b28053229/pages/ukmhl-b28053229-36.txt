18 SPICES CM Ay. MANURE The different kinds of manure to be used are mentioned under the different spices. In the tropics cow-dung, where procurable, is generally considered the best general manure. Stable manure is too hot, and requires rotting for some years before it can be used. The planter, however, often has to depend upon the kind of manure procurable in his locality. In some places poonac and castor cake can be obtained; in others cow-dung, rotten leaves, etc. have to be depended upon.

The weeds and dead leaves, sticks, etc., found on the ground should never be entirely removed.

They can also be decayed in piles or open pits and restored to the ground as a mulch. Manure should not be put close to the trunk of the tree, but should be placed at the point to which the farthermost leaves of the tree project, or in the middle line between two rows of trees, and equally distant from each.

Liquid manure should not be applied to plants before four o’clock in the afternoon, or until the hot part of the day is passed, nor should plants be watered during the heat of the day.

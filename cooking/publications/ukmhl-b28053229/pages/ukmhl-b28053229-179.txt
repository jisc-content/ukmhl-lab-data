IV CLOVES 161 sent to London in 1797. Some time later it was introduced into St. Kitts and St. Vincent, and samples of the spice were sent to England in 1880. Meanwhile an Arab from Zanzibar had conveyed plants to his country from Mauritius, and laid the foundations of the important and extensive cultivations in Zanzibar and Pemba, which are carried on to this day. On the founding of Penang by Captain Light in 1786, the East India Company took steps to break the Dutch monopoly of spices by sending Christopher Smith, their botanist, to the Moluccas to obtain plants of cloves and nutmegs, as described under the account of the introduction of the latter plant. Captain Light had already obtained clove plants from Mauritius, but in 1798 only a few, less than half a dozen, were alive, and these appear to have been of Smith’s first sending, Light’s original plants having previously died. In 1880 Smith sent 15,000 clove plants, and by 1802 there were 6,250 cloves in good condition in the East India Company’s spice garden. There were also several European plantations of some size. The trees, however, seem to have been mostly young, and when the Penang spice gardens were sold in 1805, there were only twenty-three bearing clove trees. The cultivation went on somewhat slowly till 1821, when it rapidly advanced, over 50,000 trees being added between that date and 1836. The cloves of Penang have always been the most highly valued, and have maintained their reputation for superiority from the commencement of the cultiva- tion to the present day. The plantations now, however, have almost entirely passed from the hands of the Europeans into those of the Chinese, as did the nutmegs. In Singapore, Sir Stamford Raffles, shortly after the foundation of the settlement, introduced cloves with nutmegs into the island, but the island does not seem as suitable a locality, and the trees suffer much from M

THE FRUIT The whole fruit consists of three parts, all of which possess certain uses and values. These are the husks, the mace, and the seed or nutmeg of commerce. THE HUSK This is in some demand for making nutmeg jelly, a preserve needing only to be known to be appreciated. In Singapore there is a good demand for it, and the husks are readily bought by the Chinese and Malays. Indeed, there is often locally a greater demand for the unripe fruits for preserving than for the seed and mace.

The husks are somewhat acid, so that a good quantity of

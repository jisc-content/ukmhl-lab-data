A planter in the Indian Planters' Gazette says the rhizomes are sorted into two sizes, the smaller and larger ones, as the latter require more boiling. They are then thrown into separate pots filled with water, with an admixture of cow-dung and tamarind leaves. They are then boiled for two or three hours according to their size and spread out to dry. The boiling and drying makes them shrink to half their original size, and the loss in weight varies from 30 to 40 per cent. Mukerji says that the rhizomes are to be cut in two if too fat, dried and boiled in water mixed with cow-dung, but that as soon as the water begins to boil it should be taken from the fire, and the turmeric taken out and put out in the sun. The heap should be stirred and turned two or three times a day, and the smaller pieces sorted out as they dry, leaving the thicker pieces to dry for another day or two. Daily in the evening the turmeric exposed to the sun should be rubbed, the rubbing making the rhizomes clean and smooth. AREAS OF CULTIVATION There has never been any great amount of cultiva- tion of turmeric outside the East Indies. Its demand is, except for its use as a dye, almost exclusively for curry powder, which has always been associated with the East Indies, and has not found favour in the western world. Nor is it to any great extent in demand in Europe. Its cultivation and use in Western India may be of comparatively recent date, as Linschoten, who spent several years on the Malabar coast from 1596, does not mention it while describing the curry stuffs of that region. The plant has been introduced from the East Indies into most of the Botanic Gardens of the world, but in the greater part of the tropics curry is not the common

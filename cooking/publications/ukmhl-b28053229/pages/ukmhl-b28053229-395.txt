XI CAPSICUMS 377 to 15 cents per 1,000, and in the market 30 cents per 1,000. Dried chilies are sold at 15 cents per lb., averaging 750 chilies to the pound. This appears to be the price given for C. cinnuum. Consul Cane, in a report in 1897, gives the average price of bird’s-eye chilies in Zanzibar as 2"37 dollars per frasila of 30 lbs., against 2'57 dollars in the previous year. N. Mukerji gives the price of capsicums (C. an- nuum) in Bengal as 4 to 7 rupees a maund. Neff, in California, gives 35 to 75 cents (American dollar) as the value of sun-dried capsicums, and 1^ to 12^- cents for evaporated. In Australia they are quoted as saleable at 3d. per lb. fresh and 6^d. dry. In Singapore, dried capsicums cost for the last few years from 16 to 24 dollars a picul imported from India. PESTS Aloa lactinea, an Arctid moth, the caterpillar of which is very destructive to all kinds of herbaceous crops, attacks capsicums also in India, and has been reported very injurious in Baroda (Indian Museum Notes). The caterpillar is at first grey, then as it grows it becomes reddish brown, and in three weeks becomes sluggish, and dark brown sometimes, nearly black on the back. It is then 1-| in. long, and \ in. through. When full-grown it migrates to the hedge, where it pupates. The pupa is ovate, dark brown, § in. long. After from two to ten months the moth comes out. The moth is 1^ in. across the wings. The upper wings are white, with a red margin on one side, and a few black dots scattered over them, one black spot much more distinct at the insertion of the wings; the lower wings are white with no red edge, and the dots larger and more pronounced. The body is striped alternately black and red. The caterpillar eats all kinds of cotton plants,

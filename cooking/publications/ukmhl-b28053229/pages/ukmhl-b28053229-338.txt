DC., Kadok This pepper was described by me in the Bulletin of the Straits Settlements, old series, p. 123, under the name of Piper longum, which it somewhat resembles. It is a low-growing, non-climbing plant, emitting long runners, which creep along the ground ; the flowering stems are erect and about 6 in. tall. The leaves are ovate cordate, polished dark green, 7-nerved, acute, about 4 or 5 in. long, and 3^ to 4 in. wide. The spikes are cylindrical and at first white, brownish grey when ripe, not broader at the base than at the tip, and only ^ in. through. It is less pungent than long pepper, and has a peculiar and rather unpleasant bug-like flavour. It is seldom if ever cultivated, as it grows on shady banks everywhere in the Malay peninsula, and is very readily propagated by cuttings. Its spikes are used more as a medicine by the natives than as a spice. Grains of Paradise, or Melegueta Grains of Paradise, or Melegueta, are the aromatic pungent seeds of one or more species of the genus Amomum, of the order Scitamineae.

The seeds of both species appear to be used and sold commercially, under the name Grains of Paradise. Amomum Melegueta, Roscoe, is a herbaceous plant with a stout rhizome, sending up leafy stems from 3 to 5 ft. tall. The leaves are linear, or linear oblong acuminate. The flowers are borne on a short stem about 2 in. long, hardly rising 1 iu. above the ground, and terminated by a spike of reddish bracts,

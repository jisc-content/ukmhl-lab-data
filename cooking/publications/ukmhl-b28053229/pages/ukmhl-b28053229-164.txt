SPICES 146 CUAJ'. is usually taken at night into the room used for smoking the nutmegs, but in places where the nutmegs are not smoked a drying-room, light and airy, should be provided. Smoking the mace is liable to make it spotted and spoil its colour, so that if owing to the dampness of the weather it should be necessary to use artificial heat, it should be dried over a smokeless fire of charcoal, or at least care must be taken not to allow the smoke to touch it. Great care must be taken to prevent its getting mouldy, to which it is very liable, and which very much depreciates the value of the spice. Mace, at first of a brilliant red colour, gradually becomes orange, and finally yellow, after some months’ drying. A perfect sample of mace should consist of entire double blades, not broken, flattened and of large size, horny in texture and not too brittle, and of a good, clear, and bright colour. VARIETIES OF MACE Pereira (Materia Medico,, 1850) gives three varieties of mace as distinguished by the London dealers in that day, and these three varieties seem to be known in commerce to the present time. 1. Penang Mace.—This is the most highly valued. It is more flaky and well spread than the others, and of good size and colour. 2. Dutch or Batavia Mace.—A fleshy form which fetches a lower price. Possibly he here refers to what is known as Macassar mace, the product of another tree, Myristica cirgentea, which occurs in more or less broken pieces of a brownish colour, and dull and opaque, with the surface often powdery white. The segments have very broad, rounded axils, and are fewer in number and widely separated. They are about ^ in. wide at the upper ends. The flavour resembles that of the true nutmeg, has more of a sassafras teudency and is distinctly acrid.

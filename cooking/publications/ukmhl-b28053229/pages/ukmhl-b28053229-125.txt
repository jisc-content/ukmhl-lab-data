NUTMEGS AND MACE Ill 107 nutmeg, and perhaps the best climate for it would be from 90 to 100 in. in the year, well spread over the different months, with no absolutely dry spells of more than four or five days, and no continuous heavy rains, without sun, for a fortnight. In the Straits Settlements during the wet months from December to February, it is not uncommon to have a day’s rainfall of from 4 to 6 or even 8 in., but this is not continued. After a few days of heavy rain, with perhaps one exces- sive fall of 6 or 8 in., the rain ceases for a time, and the sun soon dries up the excessive moisture. It is during these wet spells that the parasitic fungi are most active, and the continuous dampness of the air is very apt to lead to an outbreak of some fungus disease. This is, I believe, often the reason why, though the rain- fall may be in inches the same in two regions, a plant which succeeds well in one fails in the other. CULTIVATION The Seed.—In selecting seed for growing care should be taken to choose large and well formed seed. Those that are of irregular shape, or of a pale colour, should be rejected, as should also the seed that rattles in the shell, as these are too dry. The native theories as to the possibility of deter- mining the sex of the tree from any given seed are mentioned below. They can hardly be said to be reliable. The seed, like most oily ones, does not keep long in good condition for planting, so that it should be planted within twenty-four hours of gathering, if possible. If it is necessary to send seeds to a distance, they should be packed in small tins in slightly damped powdered charcoal, or fine powdered soil. Nurseries.—The seeds should be planted in beds of good soil, well dug over and manured. Care must be taken to give them sufficient drainage. They should be placed from 12 to 18 iu. apart in rows, and at a depth of about in.

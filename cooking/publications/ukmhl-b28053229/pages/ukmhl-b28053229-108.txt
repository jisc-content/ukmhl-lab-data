In order to obtain the perfume or essence \ lb. of vanilla pods are cut up small, and put into 1 gallon of pure alcohol of a strength known as 60 over-proof, giving the whole a shake- up daily. The ingredients must remain together for four weeks, at which time all that is worth extracting will be found in the spirits, which may then be strained off quite clear and bright. It is then suitable as a flavouring agent, or, when blended with other scents, makes delicious perfumery. These sold under the names of Clematis, Heliotrope, Wallflower, etc. mostly contain half in bulk of vanilla extract (Kevj Bulletin, 1888, p. 80). Vanillin is considered better than ordinary extract of vanilla pods for manufacturing purposes, being soluble in concentrated and diluted alcohol, water, especially hot water, ether, glycerine, and petroleum jelly. In confectionery and chocolate factories, pure crystallised vanillin is best used in the form of a per cent vanilla sugar which, weight for weight, is equal in aroma to the best vanilla. Vanilla sugar is made by taking 6 drachms 13 grams of vanillin crystals, dissolv- ing them in 4 fluid oz. of pure, odourless, absolute alcohol. This is poured on 2 lb. 2 oz. of the finest sugar and mixed so as to be thoroughly distributed through it. The alcohol is evaporated in a warm place, and the sugar when dry is pounded in an earthenware mortar and sifted. Vanilla sugar thus made is ready for use in con- fectionery, etc., and will keep without losing its aroma for an indefinite time. Vanillin crystals should be stored in well-stoppered bottles, as by the exposure to a damp atmosphere it is converted into vanillic acid, which is scentless. The aromatic resinous substances in the pods preserve the vanillin from changing to vanillic acid to a large extent, but it is always advisable to keep the pods in well-stoppered glass jars.1 1 Sawer's Odorographia.

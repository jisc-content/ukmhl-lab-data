Ill 143 NUTMEGS AND MACE PRICES Warburg, in Die Muskatnuss, gives a series of very interesting tables showing the prices of nutmeg and mace in different countries from the earliest times of which there is any record. In England a pound of nutmegs cost in 1310, 3s., and mace as much as 7s., and the spices kept about this price till 1623. When the Dutch monopolised the spice trade, nutmegs cost in England from 9s. to 19s. (in 1805) and mace from 30s. to 90s. in 1806. With the breaking down of the Dutch monopoly they fell from 5s. a pound for nutmegs and 8s. for mace in 1805 to from 9s. to Is. 3fd. for nutmegs, and Is. 4d. for mace in 1865. In 1874 and 1875 nutmegs fetched 2s. 8d. to 2s. 6d. a pound, but has been steadily declining ever since, except for a few large fluctuations. The average price of nutmegs now is about half what it was in 1898, or rather less. Thus 80s. limed are quoted at 6^d. and 110s. limed at 4^d. in 1909 ; mace Is. 8d. to 2s. 4d. a pound, Penang mace being rather higher than Java. This fall in price cannot be entirely due to over- production, as the exports from the Dutch East Indies show no great increase for that period. These are as follows :— 1898- 1899 . 1889-772 kilos 1899- 1900 . 2670-431 „ 1900- 1901 . 2861-518 „ 1901- 1902 . 2391-072 „ 1902- 1903 1903- 1904 1904- 1905 1905- 1906 2840-304 kilos 2686-399 „ 3389-804 „ 2793-090 „ The Dutch East Indies are the principal producers of the spice, and there has not been any great increase in output in Penang (which, indeed, is rather declining) to account for the fall in price. It is suggested that the fall in value is due to a smaller demand consequent on a decreased consumption per capita} There is, I think, a tendency in Europe to use less spice for flavouring in everything in the way of 1 Spice-Mill, 1908, p. / 49, from the Indische Mercuur, quoted in Agricultural Nevis, 1910.

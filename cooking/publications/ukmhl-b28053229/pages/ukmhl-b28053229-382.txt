SPICES 364 CHAP. gardens in their houses.” He mentions it also every- where in the Moluccas and in Calicut. Both Capsicum minimum, the bird’s-eye pepper, and C. annuum, are figured by Garcia, who mentions a yellowish-coloured variety cultivated at Lisbon. C. annuum was cultivated in England by Gerarde in 1597, and it was at that time sold in the shops at Billingsgate under the name of ginnie pepper. By this time it appears to have been well distributed all over the warmer parts of the world, and a consider- able number of varieties have since been established, varying in size and form of fruit, and in colour, black, purple, red, yellow, or white. NAMES The name capsicum (/caifritcov) was first used by Actuarius, a Greek writer of the eleventh century, but it is obvious that it could not have signified the plant now known by this name, as it was not then discovered. Fuchs, in 1542, called it Siliquastrum, or Calicut pepper. Clusius seems to have first called it capsicum, and it was also called, in the sixteenth century, Indian pepper and Guinea pepper. The French call it still Poivre d’lnde or Poivre de Guinee, but more commonly Piment or Piment de Cayenne; the Germans, Spanischer Pfeffer. In English, it is known as Pod Pepper, Red Pepper, Chilies, or Capsicum. The only original native names for the spice are “ Agi,” in Spanish America, and “ Quija” or “ Quiya” in Brazil (Piso and Marcgraf). In Eastern Asia there are no original native names, all being compounds of the local word for pepper, with some qualifying word signifying some locality from which it was derived, or its colour, such as Gawai mirchi (Goa pepper) in Bombay, Lada merah (Red pepper) or Lada China (Chinese pepper) in Malay, showing clearly that it was only known to the Asiatics as an introduction.

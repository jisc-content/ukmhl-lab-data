200 SPICES CHAP. much alike, but experienced planters can distinguish them apart. “ It is held by botanists,” lie says, “ that the so-called male trees are not necessary to the fructifying of the bloom of the bearing trees, and that they are simply barren trees of no use to the grower, and except where they are useful as shade trees are better out of the way. Many growers, however, find it difficult to reconcile this theory with actual experience, holding that when the male trees are cut out the yield of the other trees is not so great.” The pimento is certainly not a unisexual plant like the nutmeg. Being allied to the clove, it has much the same structure of the flower. It is not likely, therefore, that the flowers are, strictly speaking, male and female respectively, but possibly the so-called male flowers possess some defect in the stamens which prevents their fertilisation. Plants in the Singapore Botanic Gardens, though flowering freely, never set a single fruit, on account of some such defect. It should not be difficult to discover the cause of this production of “ male” trees in the West Indies. CROPPING The berries grow in clusters, and are in the best condition for spice when they are full but not ripe, in July and August, while still green. When fully ripe they are black, glossy, sweet, and spicy. The unripe berry is more spicy, and somewhat peppery in taste. They are about the size of a black currant. They are gathered by lads, who climb the trees and pull down the branches with a hooked stick, breaking off the twigs which bear the branches of fruits. The boughs are thrown down, and women and children gather them up, pick off the berries into baskets, throwing away the stems and leaves. Ripe berries are kept separate from green ones. This breaking of the branches does not injure the trees, but, on the contrary, acts as pruning, which is necessary in order to make the trees crop regularly. A good picker can fill a 70 lb. bag a day.

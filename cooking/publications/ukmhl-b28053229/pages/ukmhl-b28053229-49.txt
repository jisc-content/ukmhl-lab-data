II 31 VANILLA slope seems as convenient a place for the plant as any- where, so long as it is not too dry. Macfarlane’s advice is to eschew level ground, and select a piece with a moderate slope, this being easier to work, for vanilla does not care how steep the slope may be, but the workman does. Mr. Howard Newport, in the Queensland Agricultural Journal, April 1910, p. 184, points out strongly the advantages possessed by the Queensland forest for growing vanilla, and illustrates this by photographs. The trees in this form of forest grow regularly and evenly, and by clearing out any undergrowth and un- necessary trees there remains a series of trees which can be connected with bars or poles on which the vanilla can be grown. There is enough and not too much shade in this forest, and the soil is rich in humus and the site seems an ideal one, requiring but little labour to make it perfect. In the ordinary tropical forest the trees are of all sizes, and so irregular in growth that it would be very troublesome to clear the undergrowth so that the trees could be connected by trellises or poles in a con- venient way. So readily adapted a woodland as the Australian bush appears to be, is rarely found. Trees for Supports.—Where there are already suitably branched trees on the ground, or trees that by topping and pruning can be utilised, it is best to use these, supplementing them where necessary by posts, trellises, or additional planted trees. A considerable variety of trees have been recom- mended as suitable for supports of vanilla, but as what is most suitable in one country may not be adapted for another, the selection must depend to a large extent on local conditions. The ideal tree is a fairly fast grower, which is sufficiently strong to support the weight of the plant without breaking down, and which branches regularly and fairly low down, and does not give too dense or thick a shade, so as to interfere with the growth of the vine. One which grows from large-

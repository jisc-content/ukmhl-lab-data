91 VANILLA II A maceration process for extracting the vanillin is suggested by M. Dupont. A number of vases containing vanilla pods are arranged as in a battery, and alcohol at 80 to 85 per cent is poured into a vase and allowed to remain there a week, after which it is transferred to another vase with fresh vanilla. This is carried on until all the vases have received the solution as many times as there are vases, and the extract should then contain all the vanillin in the pods.1 Another method suggested is the following, taken from the Indische Mercuur, and originally published in the Spice-Mill.2 The process has been patented by an American, and is effected by a cylindric boiler with special openings and steam jacketed, into which a mixture of 40 per cent alcohol and 60 per cent water is put with the pods, and the heat gradually raised to about, but not above, 110" Fahr. The essence obtained is said to be strong and good even if inferior pods are used. No further details are given, but the principle of using a gentle heat to extract the vanillin seems to be an excellent one, and would probably be a more speedy method of making the extract than the cold method without any injury to the flavour. For confectionery only the best vanilla can be used. The vanilla of Tahiti resembles that of Vanilla pompona, “ vanillons,” in having a flavour of heliotrope or piperonal, which makes it unsuitable for high-class confectionery, and it is therefore used chiefly for perfumery. ARTIFICIAL VANILLIN Vanillin from the pods of the vanilla was first investigated by Gobley in 1858, and Tiemann and Haarmann in 1874 to 1876, in the course of further investigations, discovered that it could be formed artificially from coniferin, a glucosicle occurring in the 1 Jamaica Bulletin, Colonial Office Report, 1905. 2 Journal d'agriculture tropicale, 1910, 31.

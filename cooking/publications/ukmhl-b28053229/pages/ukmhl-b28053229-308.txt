SPICES 290 CHAP. oft, and the friction gives a fine polished appearance to the pepper, which is much admired. The finest grades of white pepper are made from Singapore and Penang black pepper in Europe in this way, or by soaking it previously and using decorticators. The same process is used in America, but apparently as late as 1899 there were only one or two white pepper factories, most of the white pepper coming direct from the East. An attempt was made by a merchant in Penang some years ago to hull dry pepper with the aid of chemicals and to bleach it afterwards, but the process proved too expensive. In Penang the white pepper is made from Sumatran dried black pepper. The fruits are soaked in milk of lime for some weeks, till the outer coats soften and can be rubbed off with the hand or by trampling with the feet. After this it is slightly coated with lime. When freshly dried the pepper comes out white after hulling, but after being kept some time before hulling, it is apt to be greyish in colour. This grey seed is sometimes polished and rubbed with lime to make it look white (Planting Opinion, 1899, p. 263). Liming pepper to whiten it is not at all uncommon, and limed pepper is often found in commerce, as its whiter appear- ance is popular and allows of its being passed as of a higher grade. The fraud seems to be most generally perpetrated in the country in which pepper is grown. The seed is normal in appearance, but presents a rougher surface than usual, and is generally of a more dead- white colour. It is an objectionable treatment, and limed pepper is disqualified from exhibitions of agri- cultural produce in the East. The best white pepper should be large, even, clean, and of good light colour, with no stains or grey tint. The hulls rubbed off in decorticating are ground up and sold as pepper dust, or as ground black pepper. This substance is liable to heavy adulterations with dirt of all kinds, and even ground olive stones.

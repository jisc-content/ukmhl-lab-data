386 SPICES CHAP. CULTIVATION Coriander is cultivated from seed as an annual. It is sown broadcast in sandy loam, or black soiL The sowing takes place in the cold or rainy season ; sown in October, it ripens in January; occasionally sown in the month of June, ripening in September as a garden crop. When the weather is dry, it requires watering. No particular care seems to be taken with it. The fruits are merely gathered and dried. The system of cultivation in Essex, England, used to be as follows:â€”The seed was sown with caraways, but, being an annual, was gathered the first year, the caraways being left in the ground. The seedling plants were hoed, so as to leave those that remained in rows 10 to 12 in. apart. In the autumn it was cut with sickles, and thrashed out on a cloth in the field. On the best land 15 cwt. per acre was a good crop. In India, the fruit is rubbed in the hand till the two mericarps are separated, and sown broadcast. It germinates about the third day, and only requires weeding once or twice. It fruits in about four weeks. It is then pulled up and beaten with sticks on the floor or trodden by bullocks. It is dried in the sun for a day or two, and packed in bags. It sells in Singapore for 3 or 4 cents per lb., and there is a large demand for it, as it is an essential ingredient in curries. DILL Dill, commonly known in the East Indies as cake seed, is the fruit of Peucedanum graveolens, L., an annual herb of the order Umbelliferae. The stem is from 1 to 3 ft. tall, slightly branched, finely striated. The leaves are stalked with the petiole flattened, the blade tripinnate or even more cut up with very fine segments, narrow, and light green. The small yellow flowers are borne in long-stalked umbels, 2 to 4 in. across. The fruit is about ^ in. long or less, broadly

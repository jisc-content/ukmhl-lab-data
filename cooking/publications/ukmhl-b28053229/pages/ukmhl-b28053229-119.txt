NUTMEGS AND MACE 101 Ill pany therefore deputed Christopher Smith in 1796 to go to the Moluccas to collect spice plants to introduce into Penang and elsewhere in the countries under their control, and in 1798 there were 600 nutmegs and some clove trees in the Penang plantations. In 1800, 5000 nutmeg plants and 15,000 cloves arrived, and in the following years more, until by 1802 Smith had sent 71,266 nutmeg and 55,265 clove plants to Penang. Of these a few were sent to Kew, Calcutta, and Madras, the others were planted in the East India Companyâ€™s spice gardens in Penang, or distributed to planters in various parts of the island. Owing to the shyness of cultivators and their care- lessness in handling the plants, and the ignorance as to methods of cultivation, a large proportion of these died, and by 1802 only about one-third of the number were living. By 1805 the spice gardens contained 5100 nutmegs, 1625 clove trees, and 1050 seedlings, and the gardens were sold for 9656 dollars. The first nutmeg fruited in 1802, according to Hunter, in his account of Penang. The abandonment of these spice gardens by the Government was due, it would appear, to the disappoint- ment in the results of the introduction, and the distrust of the reports of the botanical superintendent. This want of perseverance was certainly much to be regretted. In 1810 there were 13,000 nutmeg trees on the island, but only a few hundreds in bearing. The ignorance of methods of cultivation and the subsequent slow progress produced such apathy that the cultivation showed signs of a speedy extinction. In these early days of colonisation, and for many years after, the importance of a properly equipped botanic garden with a staff of experienced men under Government control, to experiment and assist the planter in cultivating a crop which is slow in returns, and which requires a considerable amount of study, was not understood. All pioneer work was left to the planter, who had

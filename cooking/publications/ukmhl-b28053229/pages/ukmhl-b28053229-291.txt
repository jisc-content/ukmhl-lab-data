PEPPERS VIII 273 This insect is a species of Centrotus, one of the Membracidae belonging to the order of Hemiptera. I have found in Singapore one of these Centroti on the pepper plants and it may be the same as the one described by Mr. Hewitt, but it is rather brown than black. The little animal is \ in. in length, and of a dark amber brown colour, lighter coloured beneath from the pale pubescence on its underside. Its eyes are large and far apart. Its body is somewhat of an inverted boat shape and stout in proportion to its length. From the angles of its square thorax spring two curved horns, giving it from a front view the appearance of a goat’s head. The wings are appressed together and flattened, and from the thorax lying over them for two-thirds of their length is a long horizontal spine. The legs are rather long. This insect attacks the flower spike with its short beak, which it thrusts into the spike to suck the juices. It is a quick, active animal, and can walk, jump, or fly. Indeed, it is rather difficult to catch it. Another small plant bug, which is equally destructive, is a small, black, flattened creature which creeps along the spike, sucking it with its beak. This is known as Elasmognathus Hewittii. Another species of Elasmo- gnathus, probably E. Greenii, is recorded by P. Konigsberger (Bulletin agric. Ind. ne'erlandaises, xx. 6-8) as attacking pepper at Sontang in Borneo. This species punctures the leaves and makes brown spots on them. It does not, however, seem to seriously injure the plant. In Sarawak Mr. Hewitt also found a small, flattened, green bug, peculiar from having its sides fringed with tiny spines. It is an immature form, probably of some species of Centrocnemis. The insect was a very sluggish animal, but a serious pest. The best method of dealing with this class of animal is by spraying the vines with a decoction of tuba-root (■Derris elliptica), or some of the well-known insecticides, such as nicotine. T

In 1904, 11,502 kilos (25,304 lbs.), valued at 6,902 francs, were exported, all being sent to France. The returns of the estates were very irregular. A tree one year would give 10 kilos of cloves and next year only 2, and the planter could only reckon on one good year in five. The cultivation is now practically abandoned. Madagascar exported in 1904, 77,501 kilos, valued at 10,440 francs; in 1905, 48,124 kilos, valued at 86,915 francs. There were then 409 hectares (about 900 acres) in cultivation, of which 152 only were owned by Europeans, the number of trees, young and old, being 113,350. Nearly the whole of the cultivation lay in the isle Ste. Marie, and the produce was exported to France. Malay Peninsula.â€”The cultivation of the clove tree is practically limited to Penang and Province Wellesley, and in the latter province mainly to the large hill known as Bukit Mertajam. The plants are usually grown with or close to the nutmegs (which have been already described), on steep clay hills over- looking the sea, or in the winding valleys leading up from the coast. As the hills are often steep they are terraced, each terrace following the contour of the hills, and being just wide enough to carry one row of trees. Blocks of stone and sticks are used to keep up the edges of the terraces when necessary, and the ground is kept clean by weeding. No shade is used, the trees being exposed to the full sun. Formerly this cultivation was in the hands of Europeans, at least to a large extent, but it has passed for some years now almost entirely into the hands of the Chinese. During the last year or two there has been a little falling off in the cultivation, but the class of cloves produced seems as good as ever. In Singapore the cultivation died out at the same time as that of the nutmeg, about 1866, but I doubt if it ever was as successful as in Penang. The parasite Cephaleurus is too pertinacious, and a recent re-opening

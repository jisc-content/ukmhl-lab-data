Seychelles. — In this group of islands vanilla was for many years the main production, but lately the cultivation has fallen off very considerably. The cause of this has been attributed to a severe drought in 1904, which destroyed half of the vines and injured the vitality of the rest. The low price, due to a certain extent to the artificial vanilla, contributed to the diminution of the cultivation. The chief islands in which it was produced are Mahe, Praslin, La Digue, and St. Anne.

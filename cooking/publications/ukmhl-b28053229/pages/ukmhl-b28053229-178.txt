160 SPICES CHAP. islands. Still, however, comparatively few cloves were produced or exported till the occupation of the islands by the Dutch. As in the case ol the nutmeg, they attempted to form a monopoly ol the spice by confining its cultiva- tion to Amboyna, and by making periodical expeditions to other islands to exterminate it. Though they pursued this policy with great inhumanity, their attempts to keep the trade exclusively in their hands was not altogether successful. Large supplies reached England independently of their Government. Thus, in 16°09, a ship belonging to the East India Company, the Consent, reached England with 112,000 lb. of cloves on board, on which duty to the amount of £1400, and an import tax of as much again was paid ; the cloves sold for from 5s. 6d. to 5s. 9d. a pound. The Dutch, however, maintained almost a complete monopoly of the spice trade till the eighteenth century, at the end of which time attempts were made to wrest it from them. In 1770 M. Poivre, the governor of Mauritius and Bourbon, succeeded in procuring some living plants, both of nutmegs and cloves, and introduced these successfully into the island under his control, for the benefit of the French Government, and from these trees plants were sent to Cayenne about 1789 and onwards. William Urban Buee introduced them from Cayenne into the West Indies in 1789, obtaining one plant that year and fourteen more in 1791, and in 1793 managed with much expense and trouble to secure two boxes of seed ; for exportation from French territory of plants and seed was forbidden. His first two trees fruited in 1795, and the produce was decided to be fit for any culinary purpose, and as good as any of the East Indian cloves. Buee published an excellent Narrative of the Successful Manner of Cultivating the Clove Tree in the Island of Dominica, in 1797. Plants were introduced also into Martinique about this time, and it is recorded that 300 lb. of cloves were

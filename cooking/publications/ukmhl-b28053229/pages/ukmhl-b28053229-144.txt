126 SPICES CHAP. colour, almost black. It is very convex above and has a small, bent-down head, sunk in the throat and orna- mented with a brush of yellow hairs. The antennae are clubbed, the tip of the club being whitish. The elytra is strongly ribbed, with a row of raised dots between each rib. The other beetle is rather larger. It deposits its eggs beneath the bark of the tree, either at the base of the trunk below the ground or in the branches. The very small white grub attacks the cambium layer between the bark and the wood. When it attacks the branches it burrows at the base of the twigs, cutting away the cambium where the twigs join the main branch. In this case the twigs die speedily, and the leaves do not fall, but dry on the twig, and boughs may be seen with all the lower twigs dead and bearing dry leaves while the upper twigs are still alive. After burrowing round the base of the twig the grub often bores into the centre of the woody part. The beetle remains for some time, even weeks, in the boughs and will, unless destroyed, attack other parts of the tree. The subterranean portion of the trunk is next attacked, and sometimes even before the boughs show any signs of the presence of the beetle. Usually the injury to the base of the tree is over- looked till the disease has reached above-ground, when it is almost too late to save the tree. Hence it is commonly said that the tree dies in ten days after it is attacked. In Collingwoodâ€™s description of the destruction of the trees in Penang and Singapore in 1860, which was, I have little doubt, caused by this pest, it is said that a tree would be attacked in the night, and in the morning the topmost branches would be withered. In reality, doubtless the tree had been attacked weeks before, perhaps months, but the injury was not noticed till the tree was at the point of death. As the beetles work away from the parts of the tree they have killed into still living parts, many other

259 PEPPERS VIII and in planting bury them 6 in. in the ground. Some urge that the cutting should have not less than seven joints and two branches, or three for preference, all above the upper branch to be cut off. Much shorter cuttings will grow, but are naturally rather slower in making a good bushy plant. Care is necessary in making the cuttings to detach the roots by which the stem is attached to the stake gently from the wood, and to make the cuts clean and sharp, to avoid bruising the stem or bud. The base of the cutting should be cut smooth just below the swollen node, so that no bit of an internode is left to rot below it when planted and cause an invasion of fungi. The side-branches, except the two youngest, are carefully cut off. Nurseries.â€”It is possible in good localities and good weather to plant the cuttings out in situ, without developing them in a nursery, but it is better to raise them in a nursery before planting out. The nurseries are made in much the same way as those for vanilla and other such plants. The ground is well dug and drained if too wet, and if not sufficiently rich burnt earth and charcoal with some cow-dung may be dug in. The cuttings are planted in the beds, which should be shaded with palm leaves or pandanus leaves, or any other suitable light shade on sticks or poles at some height, say 5 ft. from the ground. The beds should be watered when necessary, being kept damp and cool, but not sodden. The cuttings should remain in the beds till they have struck well and begun to make good growth, when they should be removed to then- future permanent positions. A planter suggests, in the Ceylon Observer, the following plan for a small clearing of 12 acres. All the undergrowth and small trees should be cut down, so as to admit an abundance of light, at the same time affording a moderate degree of shade. Trees to support from 250 to 300 vines to the acre should be retained. The cuttings should, before becoming too dry, be piled

The testa of the seed is deep brown, polished, and marked with shal- low grooves corre- sponding to the flaps of the mace, which overlie it. In the shell a good nutmeg should measure about 1 in. long. The shell is woody and brittle, and encloses the seed, the nutmeg of trade, which is oval but rather variable in shape, a little under 1 in. long. It is hard and woody in texture, and marked inside with brown on a greyish ground, strongly aromatic and oily. When fresh the nutmeg nearly fills up its shell, but as it dries it shrinks somewhat, and when shaken rattles in the testa. Seed used for sowing should not be dry enough to rattle, while for trade purposes it is essential for it to rattle in the testa when shaken. DISTRIBUTION OF THE PLANT The nutmeg is a native of the eastern islands of the Moluccas, known as the Spice Islands from the presence of this plant and the clove tree, and is stated by Blume to be wild in Ceram and the southern and eastern islands of this part of the Malay Archipelago. It is also indigenous to Banda, an island which has long been famous for its nutmegs, Amboyna, Gilolo, and Western New Guinea.

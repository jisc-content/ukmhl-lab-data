223 CINNAMON VI peelers), about 25 lbs. of quills were sent home for report. The report was favourable, considering that the bark had been cut at the wrong time of year and from trees which had been quite neglected. The bark was valued at from 2s. 6d. to Is. a pound. The cultivation, however, was not carried on, probably on account of the low price of cinnamon in later years. USES The bark is mainly used as a spice. It is also used in medicine as a cordial and stimulant, and in the manufacture of incense. Cinnamon oil is chiefly made in Ceylon from inferior pieces of bark, and broken quills, chips, etc. reduced to coarse powder and macerated in a saturated solution of common salt for two days, and then sub- mitted to distillation. The yield of oil varies very much, according to the quality of tlie bark, from ^ to 1 per cent. As imported into London it varies from yellow to cherry red, and it varies also much in value, the paler varieties being most highly valued. When received in London the druggists often redistil the oil, obtaining two yellow oils, one lighter than water, the other heavier. The principal constituent of cinnamon oil is cinnamaldehyde. Essential oil of cinnamon leaf is a brown, viscid, essential oil of a clove-like scent. It closely resembles oil of cloves and pimento, containing a large proportion of eugenol. It is chiefly exported from Ceylon. Oil of cinnamon root is a yellow liquid, lighter than water, with a mixed odour of camphor and cinnamon. It is described by Garcia da Orta as early as 1563. Solid camphor may also be obtained from the root, it is said. This, however, seems to be rarely made or used. Oil from the Fruits.—A fatty oil from the fruits is mentioned by Garcia and other early authors. Trimen (Flora of Ceylon) says that what is known as “ cinnamon suet ” is obtained from the ripe fruit, and

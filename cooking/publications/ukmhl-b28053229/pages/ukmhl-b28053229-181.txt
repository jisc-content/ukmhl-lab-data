CLOVES 163 IV fellen in Belgian, are known as mother-cloves in England. Rumphius gives as Malay names polong and ibu chingkeh. CULTIVATION The plant is usually grown from seed, but can be propagated by layers. In Zanzibar the method of rais- ing from seed is as follows. The seeds are first soaked in water for three days, and when germination has set in, they are planted out about 6 in. apart in shaded beds, with the bud end above-ground. It is usual to put two seeds together to provide against failures. If a large number of plants are put down the seeds are placed about 3 to 4 in. apart. The beds are about 6 ft. wide and of any length. They are shaded by a flat frame- work of sticks, over which is placed a layer of dry grass or coco-nut leaves. The framework is about 3 to 3^ ft. high. The young plants are watered morning and evening by the coolies, wherever the soil has become dry, water being sprinkled by hand from a jar. This is done as long as the seeds are not developed thoroughly. When the plants are above-ground it is done every other day ; when 6 in. high every week or ten days. The plants are kept from nine months to a year in the beds. When they are about 6 in. tall they are gradually hardened off by partially removing the shading, and are then left in the beds exposed to the sun for a month or two before planting out.1 In Amboyna, either the seeds are taken and raised in beds, as above described, or young plants that are found about the estate are taken out and transplanted. The plants raised from seed, though luxuriant, are not thought to be as fruitful as self-sown plants. In Bencoolen, Sumatra, the seeds were planted in rich mould 12 in. apart from each other, screened from the sun and duly watered. They germinate within five weeks, and when 4 ft. tall are transplanted to distances of 30 ft. apart, with a small admixture of sand with the 1 Consular Report, Zanzibar, 1892, p. 266.

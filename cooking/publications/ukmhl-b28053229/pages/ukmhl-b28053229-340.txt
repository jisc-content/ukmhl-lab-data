After this period there are many records of the use of Meleguetta, showing that it was of common occurrence in commerce. Nicolas Myrepsius, physician at the Court of Emperor John III. at Nicea in the thirteenth century, prescribes Menegetai. Grana Paradisi was enumerated among spices sold at Lyons in 1245, and by the Welsh physicians of Myddvai, under the name of Grawn Paris. In the early days the spice was conveyed overland from the Mandigo country through the desert to Tripoli and shipped by the Italians from the port of Monti di Barca on the Mediterranean coast, and as they did not know whence it came they called it Grains of Paradise. Towards the middle of the fourteenth century there began to be commercial intercourse, direct by sea, with Western Africa, and ships were sent there from Dieppe (1364), and, loaded with ivory and Malaguette, sailed from the mouth of the river Cestos (Sestros). In the sixteenth century English voyagers traded to the Gold Coast for gold, ivory, pepper (doubtless that of Piper Clusii), and Grains of Paradise. Trade.—Grains of Paradise are chiefly shipped from the settlements on the Gold Coast, the most important being Cape Coast Castle and Accra, The official Blue book for the Colony of the Gold Coast in 1871 gives the exports as 191,011 lbs. (1,705 cwt.), of which Great Britain received 85,502 lbs., the United States 35,630 lbs., Germany 28,501 lbs., France 27,125 lbs., Holland 14,250 lbs. In 1872, 620,191 lbs. were shipped, valued at £10,303 : in 1875 the export fell to 151,783 lbs., valued at £912. Uses.—Grains of Paradise seem chiefly to have been used in the early days as a substitute for pepper, and according to Pomet (Livre des drogues) as an adulterant by pepper dealers. It was an ingredient in the spiced wine known as hippocras, and in more recent times used

Injuries caused by a species of thrips is mentioned in the Indian Museum Notes, vol. i. p. 109. The thrips is a very small black insect, which attacks the leaves. The eggs are laid on the back of the leaf, and the insect when hatched sucks the sap of the leaf. They become rolled up and turn yellow, eventually dying. This spoils the crop, as the rhizomes are not developed. The insect is known in Madras as “ Sulta- thegulu.” It is suggested that the best way of dealing with the pest is to destroy it by the use of whale-oil soap solution, in the proportion of 1 lb. of soap to 4 or 5 gallons of water, or Pyrethrum powder may be used ; 1 ounce of Pyrethrum in a gallon of water. The turmeric moth (Daclessa evaxaiis). The cater- pillar of this little moth inhabits the stem of turmeric and other plants of the family of gingers, and is often troublesome, boring up the leaf-stems and causing them to fall and die. It is about f in. long when full grown, smooth, except for fine scattered hairs on its back and sides. The head and the first segment are black, the body of a pale semi-transparent pinkish colour, with grey or black dots on warts down the back, and a row just above the spiracles on each side. A pink line just above the spiracles runs the whole length of the body. The insect lives in a burrow in the stems, and can be detected by the exudation of its excreta from the holes in the stem, and the withering of the leaf. The chrysalis is about 1 in. long, and remains in the tunnel bored by the caterpillar. The moth, which is 1 in. across the wings when expanded, is entirely ochre-

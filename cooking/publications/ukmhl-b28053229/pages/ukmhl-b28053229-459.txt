XIV TURMERIC 441 first mentioned in a price ordinance of Frankfurt in 1587. Jakus extracted from galangal, galangin, camphoride, and alpinin. The latter, according to Testoni, is, how- ever, a homogeneous mixture of the other two. Chem. Centralblatt, 71, 26. Use.—The galangal was formerly used in medicine, as an aromatic stimulant like ginger, but its use in European medicine, except as a flavouring, has become nearly obsolete. It is still used, however, in Russia as a drug, and also in veterinary medicine. As a spice it is chiefly used in the manufacture of vinegar and beer, in cordials, and in liqueurs, especially in Russia in a liqueur known as Nastoika. Commerce.—It is shipped from Canton to other ports in China, to India, and Europe. It is difficult to get statistics which give any idea of the total production, but in 1869 Hance gives in the official returns the export of the year as 370,000 lbs., which seems to have been exceptionally high. In 1877, 281,733 lbs. were exported from Kung Chow in Hainan. THE GREATER GALANGAL The greater galangal, Alpinia Gctlanga, L., is a very common plant in cultivation in Java and the Malay Peninsula, where it forms an ingredient in curry, and is also used as a local medicine. It is generally used fresh and appears seldom to be dried, but packages of its dried rhizomes occasionally appear in the London market. The plant is much larger than the lesser galangal, attaining a height of 6 or 7 ft. The stems are numer- ous, forming a thick clump, and bear numerous leaves, lanceolate acute, about 18 in. long and 3^ in. wide. The stems are terminated by panicles of flowers about 6 in. long, with short branches bearing numerous fragrant small flowers with a white calyx, green petals, and a white spathulate lip ornamented with red streaks, and about 1 in. long. It has small red fruits about as big

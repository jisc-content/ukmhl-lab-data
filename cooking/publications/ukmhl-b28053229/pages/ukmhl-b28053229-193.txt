IV 175 CLOVES usually straight and not very long, and not choked up with excreta, as in the tunnels of longicorn beetles and such insects, or some insecticide might be injected into the burrows, but this is less easy. Small boughs bored may be cut off. The adult insect has never been identified, but is undoubtedly some species of moth. In Zanzibar, a leaf-eating caterpillar is recorded, which attacks the trees in the dry weather and denudes the tree of its leaves. The tree, however, is said to recover during the rains. The termites are also said to attack the roots occasionally (Consular Report, 1892, p. 266). No further details, however, are given. I have no record of termites attacking clove trees in the East Indies. A case of the sudden death of a clove tree from termites once referred to me proved to have been due to the attacks of a root fungus, the termites having merely commenced to destroy the already dead parts of the tree. Blights.—I find a species of Mytilaspis attacking the stems and the leaves of young plants, later causing distortion of them. It is a small, white, mussel- shaped coccid, which attacks many plants, especially seedlings, and is described elsewhere in this work. Root Fungus.—In the Botanic Gardens in Malacca, in 1894, a fine young clove tree suddenly died when just coming into fruit. This was supposed to be due to the attacks of termites, as there was a great mass of galleries thrown up at the base of the tree, but on digging away the soil it was discovered that the whole of the bark above the roots was black and putrid, and some of the larger roots covered with a white mildew. The tree must have been attacked some time previously by this fungus, only dying when the destruction was absolutely complete. This fungus was never identified. It prob- ably spread underground, as these parasites often do, as a number of trees were destroyed. In the case of a root-fungus like this appearing on an estate, the trees should be at once destroyed and

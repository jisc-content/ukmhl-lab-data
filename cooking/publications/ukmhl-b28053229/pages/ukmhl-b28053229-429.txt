GINGER XIII 411 especially highly spoken of and considered superior in its very high flavour to that of the Bengal low country. In the North-west Provinces it is extensively grown in the hot valleys in Kumaon, and the Punjab also supplies a considerable quantity of good ginger. The amount of land actually occupied by this spice in India is difficult to estimate as it is elsewhere, because in most places it is grown as a garden plant, that is to say, in small patches, the area of which is very difficult to estimate. The amount exported from India is, however, large and important. Milburn states that the amount imported by the East India Company in 1808 was 2,245 cwt., valued at £5629. P. L.

30 SPICES CHAP. to cool, it is used for manuring. This burnt earth is very suitable for such plants as vanilla and pepper, which require much potash. A certain quantity of lime is recommended to be added to the burnt earth and leaf-mould, especially where soils are deficient in this element. Animal manure, such as cow-dung, is not recom- mended. Orchids of all kinds seem to dislike any animal manure, and vanilla is no exception. Should farmyard manure be used, it must only be very old and well-rotted stuff, and then but little should be used mixed with the leaf-mould. Some planters have recommended that in cases where the soil is stiff' and clayey, and deficient in humus, trenches 3 or 4 ft. long and 1 or 2 ft, deep should be dug and filled with leaf-mould and sand to above the level of the ground (to allow for sinking), and the vanillas should be planted there. Most planters, however, condemn this proceeding, as the holes are liable to become water- logged. Vanilla is a surface feeder, the roots spreading between the humus and subsoil, so that practically the only feeding ground of the plant is the humus layer. Macfarlane even is inclined to condemn digging or ploughing previous to planting, preferring to leave the humus layer on the top of the soil unmixed with the subsoil. Any rotting vegetable matter, such as the leaves and stumps of bananas, coco-nut leaves, grass, etc., should be thrown on the surface and allowed to decay there. The amount of manuring required naturally varies with the nature of the subsoil and the depth of the humus. In Tahiti, Bourbon, and Mexico, where the vanilla is cultivated, the soil is volcanic, and conse- quently richer than the stiff alluvial clays so commonly met with in many tropical regions. In the latter class of soils vegetable manures of the character above men- tioned are necessary. In the Colonial Report of the Seychelles for 1905,

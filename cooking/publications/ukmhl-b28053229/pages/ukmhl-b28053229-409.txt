391 XIII GINGER Jamaica. In India, it appears that only one variety is cultivated, but the quality of the product varies with different localities, and such names as Malabar, or Cochin, Kumaon, or Bengal are names of the product as exported from those localities. Canton ginger, the preserved or green ginger, seems to be a more distinct variety. The rhizome is thicker and more succulent, hence it is used for the sweetmeat, and it is said that it is not possible in Canton to dry it. It is probable that this, to some extent, is due to the absence of sufficient sun-heat in the season when the ginger is dug, but the rhizome is certainly more juicy. There was formerly a little confusion as to the plant which was the source of the Canton ginger. In 1891, plants of what was supposed to be the Canton ginger were sent to Kew Gardens, and eventually turned out to be those of the greater Galangal, Alpinia galanga. Further investigation showed that by an error the wrong plant had been sent to Kew, and it was shown by Professor P. Groom, Mr. Ford, and others, both from the structure of the rhizomes and by the cultivation of the plant, that Canton ginger was Zingiber officinale. Mr. Ford showed, too, that there was a form of the same plant grown in the mountain districts of China, which had a smaller and dryer rhizome, and was prepared dry by the Chinese, who, however, valued it more as a spice.

INTRODUCTION 19 I pains should be spared to make it look as well as the best in the market. Inferior qualities should not be mixed with the best. There is often a good sale for inferior and consequently cheaper stuff, but the planter should attempt to make the best finished sample he can, and if he has by accident any that is not up to the standard, let that be separated and sold as second quality. Many spices suffer much from mildew, and it is impossible to dry spices and keep them free from this unless one has a good dry store, in an open dry spot with proper drainage round it to run off rain-water and prevent its accumulation. Care must be taken to keep the produce free from the attacks of the little godown beetles, which especially attack ginger and nutmegs. These beetles attack all kinds of dried vegetable produce, and may get into the store through infected produce being brought in and overlooked. Grain, coffee, and pulses are not to be stored in the spice godown if possible, as they are very likely to bring these pests. Should these insects appear, the godown should be at once cleared of all its contents, thoroughly brushed out, and completely whitewashed. It may even be necessary to disinfect, especially in corners and such places where the insects can hide, with Jeyeâ€™s fluid or some other such disinfectant. PACKING The directions for packing the produce for market are given in the chapters describing the different spices. All spices must be packed carefully so as to present a good appearance at the sales, in sound gunnies, boxes, or barrels, to avoid injury from water or from insects during the transportation. The spices should be quite dry when packed or they will become mouldy. A small amount of mouldy spice may infect and spoil the whole box or case. Finally, to close these hints, the planter must have his eyes everywhere, letting nothing escape him, and using common sense in his work.

63 II VANILLA portion of water in them. This varied from 32 per cent in a Mexican sample to 49‘5 per cent in a Seychelles sample (which was mouldy). The table he gives shows that if the vanillas contain- ing a large percentage of water are not always mouldy, due perhaps to their freedom from infection (i.e. the absence of mildew on the drying stages), those that were found to be mouldy were among the wettest fruits. The proportion of water in a fruit is excessive when it contains over 35 or 36 per cent of moisture, by weight. The proportions of water in the mouldy fruits were as follows :— Seychelles—49*5, 36*6, 36*4, 47-6. Comoro—39'0, 39*3. The importers of vanilla have noticed that the vanillas of Mexico are less liable to mildew than those from the Mascarene Islands. In the latter region, instead of exposing the fresh pods to the full sun first, the planters plunge them at once into hot water at 80J to 85° C., or some expose them to steam for a consider- able time. This destroys the waxy coat of the fruits more or less, according to the length of time they are exposed to the water and also to the temperature of the water. The vanillas of the Mascarene Islands are there- fore not as bright in appearance as those of Mexico. The absence or rarity of crystallisation (givre) in the Mexican vanilla is probably due to this, for in the Mascarene Islands vanilla crystallises readily, and it seems certain that the waxy coat of the fruit prevents the exudation and consequent crystallisation of the vanillin. M. Lecomte put the dried vanillas in a stove with wet air and found that there was a considerable differ- ence in the amount of water taken up by the different kinds. The Tahiti vanillas took up 49*9 per cent of water; Javanese 10T percent; the Mascarene Islands 5 '2 to 5’6 per cent. The excess of water taken up by the first two he attributes to the almost complete absence

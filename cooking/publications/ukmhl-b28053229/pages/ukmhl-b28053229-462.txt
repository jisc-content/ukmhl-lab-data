SPICES 444 CHAP. XIV and chewed as a cough lozenge, and in Europe for masticating to clear the voice. It is said also to be used by snuff manufacturers, and Mr. A. D. Machado of Perak, Malay Peninsula, found that the powdered rhizome sprinkled round a tree attacked by white ants (termites), destroyed those that were near the surface and prevented others from attacking. As a spice, it is used in the manufacture of certain beers, and for this purpose the oil is used. Mr. Machado exhibited at the Agricultural Exhibition in Singapore in 1906 some samples of calamus oil, which on being sent to England were pronounced to be very good and much in request for beer flavouring. The oil was obtained by distillation of the rhizome. The rhizome in commerce occurs in tortuous sub-cylindrical or flattened pieces a few inches long, and from | to 1 in. in diameter, marked on the upper surface with the leaf-scars, and beneath with a zigzag line of elevated dot-like rings, the root-scars. It is usually rough, shrunk, and dark brown, or orange brown in colour, breaking easily with an aromatic agreeable scent and a bitterish pungent taste. In the outer part are oil-cells containing essential oil, so that peeling the rhizomes before shipping or distilling, as is often done on the Continent, should not be resorted to. The rhizome yields 1 â€˜3 per cent of a yellowish neutral oil of an agreeable odour, containing a bitter principle Acoria, a semi-fluid brownish glucoside. As the oil of sweet flag is wholesome and agreeable in flavour, and is suited for flavouring beers, cordials, and other drinks, and the plant is very readily established in the tropics and grows fast, it might very well be worth while for a distiller to prepare the oil for these purposes.

CLOVES IV 185 crepancy may be accounted for by the alteration in the rating, which was at first per 300 pishi. I wanted the headmen, etc. to receive a fair, but not an excessive wage; as the season advanced I found that I had under-estimated the daily pick, which was about 400 instead of 300 pishi, so I altered the rating accordingly. The spreaders were allowed 3 pice each per day, but at Kitumba, where the quantity of cloves to handle was proportionally much less, the spreaders were paid at a higher rate. This would introduce another slight error into the first calculation. The whole of the Kitumba staff of headmen, etc. should in reality have been rated differently, but this would have led to confusion in the accounts, which were kept by an Arab who, admirably as he did his work, was not familiar with European methods of book-keeping. For the same reason I abandoned at Machui the idea of paying the pickers at the rate of 4 pice for every pishi picked after the first 6. Where super- vision is difficult, as it is in clove picking, this system would most certainly have led to imposture by the people. It would, for instance, have been easy for two or three to have united their day’s gatherings in order to make up the required quantity for the extra pice. At Dunga, which was, I believe, the only place where the system was adopted, we had got a sufficient amount of cloves to judge of its efficacy. The net returns to December 31 are then shown to be R.6,142. Allowing now for the estimated 300 fraslas still to pick, and valuing them at 5 rupees a frasla, the price to which cloves subsequently dropped, the total net returns are increased to R.7,245.

The waste upon the trees, which I have estimated at \ of the crop, would, if collected, have sufficed to pay for the entire expenditure. My object here, however, is to compare our actual expenditure and receipts, and to arrive at a fair estimate

SPICES 208 CHAP. Honourable East India Company possessed the monopoly of cinnamon till 1833. When the monopoly was abolished and the Government ceased to be the sole exporters, the trade passed into the hands of the merchants of Ceylon. There was, however, so large an export duty, viz. from one-third to a half of the value, that the cultivation began to fall off, especially as it had to compete with cinnamon raised in Java and cassia from China. This duty was removed in 1853. The cultivation of the plant was introduced into Java by the Dutch in 1825. NAMES OF CINNAMON The oldest name for the spice seems to be the Greek Kivvafiw[jiov ; Chinese, Tienchu Kwei (Kwei, cassia; lit. Indian cassia); Persian, Arabic, Darchini (China bark), also Hindustani; Malay, Kayu Manis, from which Garcia derives the word Cassia; Arabic, Querfaa or Querfe (Garcia); Singhalese, Cuurdo (Garcia), Kur- undo; Malabar, Cctmeaa; Tamil, Karruwa puttay; Telugu, Sanalinga putta ; Dutch, Caneel; Portuguese, Canelcc; French, Cannelle; German, Kaneel. CULTIVATION Soil.â€”A rather elevated situation is most favourable to the cultivation of cinnamon, and a sandy loam mixed with decayed vegetable matter is recommended as that in which it flourishes best. Like many other cultivated plants, it is reported to grow best near houses. This is doubtless due to the waste and refuse thrown out from the houses acting as manure to the plant. In the Straits Settlements the plant seems to grow readily and well in most soils, not too wet, even flourishing in stiff and inferior clay; red and dark brown lateritic soils, so long as the ground is not rocky or full of stones, has proved quite satisfactory.

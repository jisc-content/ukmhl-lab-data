VANILLA II 27 CULTIVATION Climate.â€”Vanilla requires a tropical climate, hot and moist, with frequent but not excessive rains. It cannot stand dryness nor strong sea-winds, nor does excessive regular moisture suit it. In the Singapore Botanic Gardens it grows very well and strong, but as its period for ripening the fruits coincides with the wet season, it cannot be cultivated in this region with much success, for if there should be heavy rain-storms during the ripening period, the pods are apt to fall off unripe and are spoilt. Both Vanilla plan- ifolia and V pompona, however, have pro- duced good pods there. As the flowers are usually produced in June and July, and the fruits ripen about De- cember or January, it is desirable to select a climate for it where the Vanilla Flowers. rains are not violent at the end of the year. Curiously, a wild species of vanilla, V. Griffithii, common all over the Malay Peninsula, flowers and fruits in almost the same months as the American species, but the heavy rains of December and January do not affect the ripening of its fruit. Unfortunately, this species does not possess the aromatic flavour and perfume of the American plant. The climates of the Mascarene Islands, the West Indies, and parts of the Polynesian Islands, such as Tahiti and Fiji, are those which suit it best,

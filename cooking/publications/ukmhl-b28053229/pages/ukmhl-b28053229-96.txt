Of late years, however, Tahiti vanilla seems to have deteriorated, and its price in 1904 fell very low. There have been many and various suggestions as to the cause of this deterioration. It is suggested by M. Busse that the plant cultivated in Tahiti Is a local variety altered by climatic influences from the original form. Others suggest that the methods of preparation are not suitable, and that the habit of the Chinese of buying up green pods and roughly preparing them, and then fraudulently mixing them with good pods, is the cause of the fall in price; and again, it is pointed out that it is not yet certain that the Tahiti plant is the same as the true Mexican V. planifolia. Whatever be the cause, the result is said to be that the pods are poor in vanillin and have too strong a scent of heliotrope, or piperonal. For this reason the Tahiti vanilla can hardly be used at all as a condiment, and can only be used in perfumery. The fall in price is shown by the following table :— In 1897-1899 1900 1901 1902 1904 d. s. 5J to 5 114 per lb. 4 „ 11 Of „ d. 2 per lb. The export is still, however, very considerable.

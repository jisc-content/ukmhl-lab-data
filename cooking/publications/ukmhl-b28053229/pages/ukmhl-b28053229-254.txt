SPICES 236 CHAP. kilogram, according to quality. The average price of cultivated Annam cassia is only about 80 francs the kilogram. M. Eberhardt found the tree growing pretty nearly all over Indo-China, and a general consensus of opinion that Annam cassia was the best. He is doubtful as to whether the cultivation would ever pay the European, as the age to which it requires to develop before ex- ploiting is great. It could, however, be well utilised as an accessory cultivation.1 It is very probable from these researches that the Chinese cassia, which is not known in a truly wild state, is an introduction from Annam, or other parts of Indo-China, by the Chinese, and that it is a cultivated form of C. obtusifoliurn, a plant of rather wide distribution. As mentioned in dealing with cinnamon, these aromatic barks vary much in value according to the strain or variety, and according to climate and soil. It might be well worth trying if the fine strain of Thank Hoa would not keep true under cultivation, and if it could not be cultivated in Indo-China by the same method as cinnamon is in Ceylon. OTHER CASSIA BARKS There are several other species of Cinnamon which grow wild in the Malay Peninsula and Islands, of which the bark is collected by natives and sold in the local markets, or used locally. None, however, so far as I am aware, are at present cultivated, and indeed even yet but little is known as to the origin of some of these barks, or the habits of the tree. Cinnamomum iners, Reinw.—Kayu Manis hutan (Malay, lit. wild cinnamon) is a very common tree in low swampy ground in the Malay Peninsula. It is closely allied to, if not actually a form of, the true cinnamon, but is much less aromatic. The bark is used in curries, but is not much sought after.

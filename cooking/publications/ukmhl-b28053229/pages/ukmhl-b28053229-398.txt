380 SPICES CHAP. some years ago as Nepal pepper, and having the very pleasant characteristic flavour of that spice, was of a bright orange-yellow colour, possibly made from yellow capsicums. Zanzibar is also said to give a brownish coloured powder. The method of making cayenne pepper in the West Indies is described in Drury’s Useful Plants of Podia, from Lindley’s Commercial Products of the Madras Presidency.

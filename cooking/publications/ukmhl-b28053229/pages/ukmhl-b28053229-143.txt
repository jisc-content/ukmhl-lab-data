125 NUTMEGS AND MACE Ill May and June, and again in August and September. In the Straits Settlements the July and August crop is the heaviest, though fruit can be obtained all the year. This coincides with the season for the cropping of fruit trees. Crawford says that three crops are recognised in the East Indies, one at the end of July and in August, which gives the best nuts; the second in November, the heaviest cropping time; and another at the end of March. Lumsdaine says that the great harvest in Sumatra is obtained in the period from September to December, and a smaller one from April to June. The fruiting seasons in Trinidad are shown in a table published by Mr. Hart in 1895. He gives a daily average of fruit from trees in the Botanic Gardens for five years, thus :— J anuary February March April May June . 65-8 July . 111-2 August . 224-6 September . 374-2 October . . 402-2 November . 442-0 December . 405-4 405-8 304-2 210-6 65-8 55-6 The steady rise from February to June and falling off from July and August to December is well marked. This is quite distinct from the East Indian two-cropping periods, and is probably due to climatic differences. Lumsdaine states that the trees yield most abun- dantly every second year. This is usually the case in fruit trees all over the East. A heavy crop one year is followed by a short crop the next, and vice versa. PESTS Phloeosomus cribratus, Blandford.—The most injuri- ous insect to the nutmeg tree that I have seen is a very small Scolytid beetle belonging to this species which I found in abundance destroying the trees in Penang and Province Wellesley. There seemed to be two species attacking the trees. The first one is a short cylindrical beetle, only j- in. in length, of a dark-brown

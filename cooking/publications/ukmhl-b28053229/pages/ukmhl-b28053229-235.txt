VI 217 CINNAMON stroying the leaves. Though abundant on wild or full- sized trees, it would probably do little harm in the cultivated state of the plant; as the shoots are constantly being cut on an estate, insect and fungus pests have less chance of establishing themselves than in a tree, where the leaves are left on for a long time. Cattle, goats, and squirrels are also recorded as occasionally doing damage by eating or nibbling the shoots. Galls.—Doctors W .and J. van Leeuwen-Reijnvaan, in the Annales du Jardin Botanique, vol. xxiii. p. 120, plates xxiv., xxv., figure and describe cinnamon leaves infected with galls due to a mite known as Eriophyes doctersi, Nal. The animal seems only to attack the true cinnamon, and it appears to occur in many parts of Java. The galls generally appear on the lower side of the leaf, rarely on the upper side, but they are also found on the leaf-stalk and twigs ; when the plant is badly affected the terminal and axillary buds are attacked, and the whole shoot is twisted up. They seem to be most injurious to young plants. The galls are in the form of blunt, hollow cones, and are often densely crowded upon the leaves, quite destroying them. This class of gall, very abundant in the tropics, is very troublesome to deal with. Infected leaves should be removed and burnt, and badly attacked seedlings should be destroyed. Fungi.—Pestalozzia cinnamomi, Raciborski. This minute leaf fungus is described in the Bulletin Institut Botanique de Buitenzorg, vol. vi. p. 13, as attacking twigs and leaves of cinnamon. No account of the injury caused by it is given. Corticium javanicum.—This fungus, which has obtained more notoriety as a pest on the Para rubber tree than on any other plant, occasionally attacks cinnamon shoots, as it does all manner of woody plants, in the wet season. It forms a pale pinkish-white crust on the stems of plants, destroying the cambium layer and causing the death of the shoot or twig. This fungus is

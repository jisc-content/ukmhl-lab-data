II VANILLA 79 Fiji Islands.—A few attempts have been made to produce an extensive culture of the plant here, but there is as yet but little exported. Honolulu.—The Agricultural Station Report of Hawaii for 1903 gives some account of attempts to introduce and develop the industry here. In 1902 two plants produced 300 pods, and in 1903, 150, about a quarter being of good size and quality. The writer says that plants over-cropped soon die, the roots and stalk rot, or the whole vine becomes yellowish, the leaves soft and white, the tendrils (aerial roots) dry and the plant dies. He estimates the following returns from an acre in Honolulu :— Each plant produces 10 pods ; there are two plants to a support, and 680 supports to an acre; this gives 13,600 pods. 1000 fresh pods weigh 45 lb., 13,000 pods give 58 lb., which when cured weigh 120 lb. ; one-half of this should be of good superior quality, valued at 6 to 9 American dollars a pound, the balance valued at 1'25 to 4 dollars a pound, giving a return of 435 dollars, i.e. £87 per acre. Australia.—Nothing seems as yet to have been done in the cultivation of vanilla in Australia. Mr. Howard Newport, however, in an article on vanilla culture in Queensland (Queensland Agricultural Journal, April 1910, p. 184), urges the cultivation to the atten- tion of the planter. He shows the suitability of the forest, soil, and climate, a temperature between 70° and 90° Fahr. and a rainfall from 50 to 60 up to 200, well distributed, with August to October (the flowering season of the vanilla) fairly dry months. His photographs show that he at least has cultivated some successfully, and there really does not seem to be any reason why Australia should not grow its own vanilla. Summary.—It will be noticed from this distribution of the cultivation area that it practically extends from lat. 20 N. to lat. 20 S., but that of this area a consider- able portion is more or less unsuitable ; part doubtless on account of its long dry periods, such as on the mainland

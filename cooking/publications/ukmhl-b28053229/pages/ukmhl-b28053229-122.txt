SPICES 104 CHAP. Province AVellesley in the Malay Peninsula, whence are derived the finest nutmegs in the world. Here the trees grow on the steep exposed slopes of granite hills, the soil of which is the yellow loamy clay so character- istic of what are known as the laterite formations of the Malay Peninsula. The more friable the clay the better the plants seem to thrive. Dr. Oxley affirms that the deeper the tinge of iron in the soil the better it is for the full development of the tree. Bare clay slopes or sandy soils do not suit the plant at all. The rain-wash in such places, especially if it is impossible to grow shade trees to check this, is most injurious. The slopes of the Penang and Province AVellesley hills are rocky, with projecting boulders and masses of granite, and among these the trees do well. In Malacca, at Pringitt, there was formerly for many years an excellent little plantation which throve well and yielded good crops on a hard ferruginous gravel, or pebbles of clay iron-stone (laterite). In Bencoolen, Sumatra, Lumsdaine says that the soil of the plantation was generally of a red colour, with stony fragments or pebbles scattered through it; the surface of the forest lands being of a chocolate colour. In Trinidad, virgin forest with rich soil is preferred, but the soil need not necessarily be very rich, for the plant throve well in red-brick soil, the poorest in the district (Hart, Trinidad Bulletin). Alluvial flats are recommended by Lumsdaine, but in most cases these are too low-lying and wet. AVet or flooded ground is fatal to nutmegs, as is also exces- sively dry ground. Altitude.â€”The limits of successful cultivation in the AA^est Indies are from sea-level to 1000 ft. eleva- tion. In the Straits Settlements it is seldom grown as low as sea-level, but is generally cultivated on hills from about 200 ft. to 2000 ft. above the sea. On the hill known as Bukit Mertajam, in Province AVellesley, where every suitable spot is covered with

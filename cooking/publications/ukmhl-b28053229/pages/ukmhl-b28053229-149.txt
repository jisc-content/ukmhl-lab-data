Ill 131 NUTMEGS AND MACE This, of course, would prevent fertilisation, but it seems to be an infrequent occurrence. A leaf mining caterpillar' has been met with both by myself and Dr. Oxley, who says that these insects rapidly spread and cause great havoc. Batocera Hector, Dej.—A large, brown longicorn beetle, not uncommon all over the Malay region, is accused by Dr. Ivoningsberger of attacking the nutmeg in Java. Its larva burrows beneath the bark and into the wood. It attacks a number of trees, such as Albizzia moluccana and Erythrinas. The larva is about 4 in. long and rather flat. The perfect insect is 3 in. long, with long antennae and a thorn on each side of the thorax. Lcichnosterna sp.—A small brown chafer of the group of Lamellicorns, less than 1 in. long, of a deep chocolate-brown colour, quite smooth except the under parts, which are covered with a soft down, and its legs, which are hairy. The grub is a white larva with a brown head, about 1 in. long and of the usual form of the lamellicorn larvae. This chafer attacks the roots of many plants, the larva burrowing among them and eating them. It has been found attacking nutmegs in Penang. Astychus chrysochloris, Wied. — A green weevil, about % in. long, covered with golden scales, which are easily rubbed off, has given some trouble in various parts of the Malay Peninsula by devouring the leaves of all manner of trees, including nutmegs. Mr. Wray has described it in Perak Museum Notes, vol. ii. 1, 1897. The egg is laid in the ground, and the grub, which apparently feeds on decaying vegetable matter till it grows to a length of § in., forms a chamber in the earth and pupates there, about 2 in. below the surface of the ground. It hatches out at night, and commences to devour the leaves of any tree it comes across. It lives for three months, eating voraciously the whole time, and does not leave a tree till it has eaten every leaf. It breeds a month after hatching, and lays its

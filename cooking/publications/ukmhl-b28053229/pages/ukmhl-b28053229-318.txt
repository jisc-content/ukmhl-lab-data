Cambodia.—The cultivation of pepper in Cambodia forms the subject of an extensive paper by M. A. Leclerc in the Revue des cultures coloniales, 1900, pp. 87 and 116, and another by M. Le Ray, Bulletin economique de VIndo-Chine, 1907, p. 361. The first record of pepper-planting in this country is found in the Voyage lointain au Cambodge by a Dutchman, Wusthof, in 1644, who mentions pepper as furnished by the province of Thbaung Khmoun on the Chileang River. The cultivation seems to have discon- tinued later, and to have been re-started about 1840 in the Kampot province, and about twenty-five years later in Peam and fifteen years later in Treang. M. Leclerc mentions the only pepper producing districts as Peam, Kampot, Treang, and Banteay-mear. These districts are arranged thus in order of importance of the cultivation. In 1884 the amount of pepper exported from Kampot and Peam was 5,000 piculs, but the unsettled state of the country in 1885 and 1886 seriously injured the cultivations. Young plantations were abandoned and many plants in older plantations were destroyed by the bandits, or died from neglect, and the planters ceased to open up fresh ground or plant. The production fell to 2,000 piculs in Peam and to 1,800 in the Kampot province. When the country was at peace the cultivators set to work again, and in 1889 the production had risen to its former amount, the four provinces producing 6,000 piculs. In 1902 the cultivation rapidly increased owing to the exhaustion of the soil in Hatien (Cochin-China) and the superiority of the Cambodian soil, which required no manuring, and which allowed of a first crop in the fourth or even the third year; to the higher taxation of Asiatic aliens in Cochin-China than in Cambodia, and to the objection of the Chinese to certain anthropometrical examinations which entailed

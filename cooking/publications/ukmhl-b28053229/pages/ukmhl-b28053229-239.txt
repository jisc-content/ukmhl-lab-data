CINNAMON 221 VI grown in shade. Cinnamon grown in marshy land is spongy and coarse grained, with very little aroma.1 The best cinnamon is said to come from the middle of the shoot, that of the upper end being of second quality, and that from the base or thickest end the most inferior. The bits trimmed off are known as “ cinnamon chips,” chiefly used for oil, and a thick bark derived from older stems is known to the trade as “ cinnamon bark.” It occurs in flat or slightly channelled fragments, as much as f of an inch thick. It is also used for manu- facturing oil. The bales of cinnamon which arrive in London are always repacked in the dock warehouses, and in this handling there is a. certain amount of breakage. The broken bits are kept separate and sold as “ small cinnamon.” It is often of excellent quality and used in pharmacy. CINNAMON CHIPS This is the name given to the coarsest and most inferior cinnamon that cannot be quilled, and the prunings and waste bits obtained in trimming and peeling. Till 1867 it appears that in Ceylon this was used for extracting the cinnamon oil locally, and not shipped to Europe. It was then, however, found profit- able to export chips wholesale, which resulted in an excessive export of cinnamon in the two forms. The rubbish sent from the island brought the chips into disfavour, and the price of the spice fell. Then followed great discussions as to the advantages to be gained by the planters by preventing the shipping of chips altogether. A native Representative Association agreed in 1883-1884 to give up the preparation and export of chips, but this does not seem to have had much effect, and chips are shipped to the present day. The amount of chips in proportion to the quills was very large in 1880, over one-third of the amount of 1 Experienced planter, and E. Boddain, in All about Spices.

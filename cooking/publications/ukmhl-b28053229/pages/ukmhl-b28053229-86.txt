68 SPICES CHAP. The yearly production varies between 3000 and 4000 kilos, of which nearly all goes to London. Reunion.—The history of the introduction into this island has been previously mentioned. It was first brought in 1793, and again introduced on two later occasions. Its cultivation began to increase largely in 1874, especially in the northern part of the island, which seemed to give the best results. At present there are 4000 hectares under cultiva- tion. The product takes the highest price in value of any in the world except that of Mexico, and with care might perhaps equal or eclipse that. The exportations are given as follows :— 1879-1880 . 44,689 kilos 1888-1889 . . 52,217 kilos 1880-1881 . 1881-1882 . . 23,031 . 27,764 JJ JJ 1889- 1890 . 1890- 1891 . . 48,049 . 85,847 JJ j) 1882-1883 . . 21,095 JJ 1891-1892 . . 90,722 jj 1883-1884 . . 28,049 J J 1892-1893 . . 94,282 )) 1884-1885 . . 48,648 J J 1893-1894 . . 82,943 >j 1885-1886 . . 57,073 JJ 1894-1895 . . 82,000 j j 1886-1887 . . 18,549 5) 1895-1896 . . 60,000 jj 1887-1888 . . 89,067 JJ 1896-1897 . . 65,000 JJ In 1904-1905, 75,000 kilos were exported. As will be seen, this ranks only second to Mexico in bulk of export. Madagascar.—An account of the cultivation of vanilla at Nossibe, in Madagascar, is given by M. Paul des Grottes in the Journal d’agriculture tropicale, which contains many suggestive notes and ideas. The vanilla of Nossibe was, he says, considered by M. Simon, the great vanilla merchant in Paris, to be in the near future of the same rank as that of Bourbon, which is considered the best next to that of Mexico, the finest in the world. The Nossibe cultivations were made under the shade of woods, the shade tree used being Albizzia lebbelc. The support, Jatropha curcas, is a compara- tively small tree, but of fairly rapid growth, and occurs in most parts of the tropics. But some planters having remarked that the pods produced at the edge of the

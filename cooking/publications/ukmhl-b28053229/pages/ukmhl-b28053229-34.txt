CHAP. 16 SPICES made in a few minutes on the estate and will do for any kind of spraying. GENERAL HINTS In selecting seeds of any plant for cultivation, if possible, always take by preference the best stock from well-known, strong and producing trees, even if it costs more than unselected seed. In the tropics the duration of the life of the seed is shorter than in cold climates. Seed kept for any length of time deteriorates, and in germinating often causes disappointment. The seed must be fresh, recently gathered, and kept in a cool, shady spot until sown. Seeds that have been kept too long, especially if hard-coated, such as nutmegs, may be assisted in germinating by soaking in water for a few hours before planting. Warm water is preferred. As a rule, seed does not require to be planted deep in the soil. It should be just covered and no more. Cuttings should always be made with a sharp knife, so as not to bruise the tissue. It must be remembered that roots and buds can only be emitted at a node or joint, and the cut should be made a little below the node, so as to leave a small portion of the internode to hold the cutting in the ground until the roots are emitted. Cuttings are very liable to the attack of fungi. Should it be found that the cuttings in a nursery bed are constantly or much attacked by any fungi, the bed should be abandoned and the soil thoroughly disinfected with Bordeaux mixture and lime. In planting the soil should be pressed firmly against the base of the cutting. Rhizome cuttings, such as those of turmeric and ginger, should be sufficiently large. If there is any fungus disease in the bed from which they are taken, it is advisable to soak them for a few hours in a weak solution of copper sulphate to disinfect them. Nursery beds should be well dug and the sods broken up so as to resemble garden soil. It should be damp,

To the habit of giving manure at mid- day when it is hottest, or to giving manure too strong and unmixed with water, he attributes the rotting of the chili fruits before they are ripe. This rotting of the fruits, I presume, is really the destruction of the fruits by Gloeosporium, or other fungus diseases. It is always an understood thing that liquid manure, and indeed pure water, should not be given to a plant in full sun during the hot part of the day in the tropics. All applications of liquids or water- ing should be given to the plant either in the early morning or, by preference, in the evening not long before sundown.

Of course, the administration of too strong manure does not actually directly produce the fungus, but it probably so far weakens the plant that it is readily affected by it. Over-manured plants of any kind are apt to show the results in the pale yellow colouring of the leaves, quite similar to that caused by starvation or disease of the roots. In Singapore the price fluctuates from 15 cents to 90 cents a catty. The latter price is very high, and is said to be caused by a scarcity due to the heavy and continuous rains. When the crop is very abundant and the capsicums are cheap, the fruit that is unsold is dried on mats in the sun, but no regular drying system is in vogue, nor is there any attempt to make cayenne pepper. The capsicums are very extensively used fresh with the rice and dried fish which forms the ordinary native food. Dried capsicums, however, are imported very extensively from India. Natives say that the locally dried capsicum has not the flavour of the dried Indian fruit. It is 2 B

MOULDINESS IN VANILLA PODS The vanilla pods are much subject to injury from attacks of mildew, which has the effect of reducing their value, for they take on an odour of mouldiness which is nearly impossible to eradicate. The importers of vanilla remove the mildew by rubbing the pods gently with the cloth, and prevent to a certain extent the reappear- ance of the mildew with formaldehyde, but nothing can get rid of the mouldy odour of the pods. In the matter of mouldiness the pods vary, and in the Journal cVagriculture tropicale (August 1905), p. 227, M. Henry Lecomte gives an account of observations and experiments which he has made on this subject. Taking a fruit of Mexican vanilla with the patch of mould on it near the stalk, he found, after keeping it in a glass tube for three months, the patch of mildew hardly increased in size, and by putting a number of partly mouldy fruits of Seychelles vanilla together in a tube he found that the mouldy portions did not infect the healthy parts of the pods, though they were in actual contact. Hence he argues that the only vanillas attacked by mildew are those which have some defect in the preparation, and that under ordinary conditions vanilla appears to resist mouldiness. The mouldiness constantly develops at the base of the capsule near the stalk, which is the part which contains the least vanillin. He suggests that too early a cessation of the drying process may predispose the vanilla to mouldiness. The last phase of preparation, the desiccation of the fruits on platforms, has no fixed period, depending as it does on climatic conditions. There is nothing to show the preparer when they are dry enough, or when they require further drying. This being so, one would expect the commercial vanillas to show great variations in dryness : M. Lecomte obtained, therefore, seventeen samples of commercial vanillas and tested them to find the pro-

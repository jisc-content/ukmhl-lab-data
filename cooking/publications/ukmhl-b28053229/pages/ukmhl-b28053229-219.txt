PIMENTO OR ALLSPICE V 201 We have no record of any disease or pests of the allspice tree. In fact, very little has been written about the tree at all. It appears to be of easy cultivation in Jamaica, though it seems to have failed elsewhere. It is reported to be doing well in Fiji. The area under cultivation in Jamaica varies a good deal, but exclusive of wild plants, the acreage for different years has been returned as the following :— 1871 1874 1875-1876 . 1879-1880 . 717 acres 1,392 „ 2,363 „ 969 „ CURING The pimento, after gathering, is carried in baskets to the barbecue, which is a large paved court, divided into compartments by a low bank, so that pimento gathered on one day and partly dry may not mix with fresher gathered berries. The berries are spread out in the sun and turned over with a wooden rake, so that they may be heated and dried on all sides by the sun. They take from three to twelve days to dry. A good dry breeze naturally helps. Tarpaulins are required for every range of barbecues, so that in case of rain the spice may not get wet. Sometimes an American fruit evaporator is used to dry it, especially in wet weather. Damp spoils the spice by affecting the bright brown colour, which is the chief point looked to by the buyers. The fruit is known to be dry when it rattles with a sharp, dry, crisp sound when a handful is shaken close to the ear. The spice is then stored till the crop is finished, when it is all passed through a machine which fans out dust and bits of leaves, and then it is placed in bags for shipment. CROPS The average annual export from Jamaica is 75,000 bags, weighing 145 lbs. each, or 11,275,000 lbs.

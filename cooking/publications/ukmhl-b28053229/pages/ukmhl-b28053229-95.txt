77 VANILLA II plant ultimately dying outright or to within a foot or so of the surface.” The writer recommends Albizzia moluccana as a support, as its top is not too dense and allows of a broken light and sunshine to penetrate to the plants. It is advised to plant the albizzias 12 ft. apart, and they will be large enough in one year to allow a vanilla to be planted at each tree. The branches of the albizzia should be cut off to about 6 or 7 ft. Thev should be weighted to induce them to grow out horizontally, until they meet with the branches of the neighbouring trees. This seems rather a good idea. Albizzia moluccana is a rapid grower, but normally makes a tall, smooth stem running up to 60 or 80 ft. without branches, and is in this way unsuited for vanilla, which would not be able to grip the bark sufficiently firmly, and if it did would soon climb out of reach. As to mangoes, recom- mended by M. G-isseleire, they are usually considered too dense a shade for vanilla, but were perhaps the best trees available in Bengal. There can be no doubt that vanilla would do well in many parts of India, and might readily be grown as an adjunct to other crops on the estate.

The greater part goes to America. 1874 2435 kilos 1882 . 1,344 kilos 1875 14 „ 1883 373 „ 1876 2297 „ 1884 974 „ 1878 443-5 „ 1885 219 „ 1879 373-5 „ 1886 83 „ 1880 234-5 „ 1887 133-5,, 1881 139 „ 1888 129 „ Polynesia.—Tahiti ranks as one of the great pro-

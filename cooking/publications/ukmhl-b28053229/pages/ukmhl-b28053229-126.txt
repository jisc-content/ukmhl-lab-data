SPICES 108 CHAP. The beds should be shaded with the leaf-roofing known as ataps in the Malay region. These are made of plaited or folded palm or pandanns leaves, arid should be sufficiently loose in texture to let through a certain amount of light. The roofing is supported on sticks about 3 ft. tall. If the place is very exposed, it may be advisable to shade the sides also of the nursery beds. The beds should be watered every other day or oftener, according to the temperature of the air and dryness of the soil. It should not be allowed to get too dry, nor should it be over-saturated. The seeds germinate in a month or six weeks, some- times later. They sprout very freely if they are sound seed, and under ordinary circumstances at least 95 per cent can be raised. During their growth, which is rather slow at first, all that is necessary is to keep the bed watered, and to remove the weeds which spring up in the beds. It is a good plan to lighten the shading of the nurseries as the plants grow, so as to accustom them gradually to full light, and to allow a good current of air to pass through the foliage of the seedlings. The young plants remain in the nurseries till they are about 6 in. tall, or even taller, that is to say, about six months, after which they are planted out in the estate in the positions they are intended permanently to occupy. It is advisable to have the nurseries in close proximity to the plantation, to save trouble and expense in transporting the seedlings. Hart, in the Trinidad Bulletin, recommends that the seeds should be planted in old brandy cases, about 500 or 600 in a dozen cases. When they are 6 or more inches tall, he would transfer them to bamboo pots, to grow for another six months before transplanting. Some planters prefer planting the seeds in bamboo pots and allowing them to germinate and grow there till they are big enough to plant out. The advantage

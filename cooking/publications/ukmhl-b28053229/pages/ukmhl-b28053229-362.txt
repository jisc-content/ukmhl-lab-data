344 SPICES CHAP. taneously, but in ones or twos at a time, the fruits on a scape are not all ripe at a time. There will be blossoms and immature fruit with the ripe fruit on the same scape. The scapes, in fact, go on producing fruit for at least a second season. GATHERING It is common among Indians, and indeed aLso among European cultivators, to pull off the whole racemes, thereby wasting all the fruit which is unripe, and there- fore valueless at that time. This is extravagant and wasteful, and only the capsules absolutely ripe should be gathered, the rest left to ripen for a second picking. The capsules, when ripe, are known to be so by their turning from green to yellow, and should be full and firm at that time. It has been found that cardamoms when plucked are apt to split in drying, and even the pressure of the fingers may crack them. When fully ripe they split of themselves, and as the least touch then causes them to fall, it is necessary to gather before they have turned to the deep yellow of full ripeness. The seeds, however, turn black and develop their full aroma before the fruit is absolutely ripe, but has begun to turn yellow. Considerable practice is necessary before the coolies can tell what is ready for collecting and what is not yet ripe. To obviate the splitting during drying, the fruit should be cut off with a small portion of stalk attached. In Ceylon this is effected by the use of a specially made pair of scissors. The ones recommended by Mr. Owen have very short cutting blades 1 in. long, with handles 4 in. long. The work of collecting with these scissors is long and tedious, and the coolies dislike it, and are apt to get careless in their work. The method is to hold the raceme in the left hand while the ripe fruits are clipped off. The fruit should not be held in the hand, as it might split if it was fully ripe. The fruits out of reach of the scissors among the

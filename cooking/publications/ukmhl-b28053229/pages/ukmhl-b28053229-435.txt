417 GINGER XIII he shipped seven barrels and one box containing 9 cwt. 1 qr. 2 lbs. The produce of the barrels sold at 73s. 6d. per cwt., that of the box 73s. per cwt. Though the yield of his plantation was a poor one, it gave a net profit of £10 per acre. If, remarks Bovell, the yield had been as good as that of the Botanic station it would have been equal to £22:5:6^ per acre. USES Spice.—Ginger is one of the most popular flavour- ing agents known, and has been so used for very many centuries, entering into confectionery, ginger beers, ginger champagnes, and other beverages. In most of these confections the dried rhizome, ground fine, is used, and most of the inferior grades of the spice are sold in the form of ground ginger. The highest grades are, however, commonly sold as imported, and grated for use as required. Like all ground spices, ground ginger is apt to be largely adulterated with wheat flour, ground rice, potato flour, sago, turmeric, mustard husks and cayenne pepper. In the East, fresh ginger rhizomes play an important part in curry, and in the Malay peninsula most of the ginger cultivated is used for this purpose locally. Preserved Gingers.—Practically all the commercial preserved ginger, i.e. ginger preserved in syrup, comes nowadays into the market from Canton. The ginger for this purpose is grown in alluvial flats round Canton, and seems to be a more fleshy variety. The season for preserving in China is July to October, and the United States Consul there gives an account of its preparation in a report quoted in the Agricidtural Neivs, viii. 121 (1909), as follows :—“ The rhizomes are first thoroughly cleaned in water and boiled in earthenware pans for two or three hours. Afterwards transferred to copper pans, in which is put sufficient water to cover the rhizomes, and a quantity of white sugar in the proportion of 5 lbs. of sugar to 10 lbs. of ginger. The mixture is then boiled 2 E

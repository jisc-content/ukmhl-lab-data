SPICES 4 CHAP. others of the spices in various arts. All these uses add to the commercial demand, and are of considerable importance to the planter. Of late years there can be no doubt that the use of spice as flavouring by European nations has consider- ably diminished. In the twelfth and later centuries the use of spice in every household was very large, and was only regulated by their cost. But the last few years have shown a certain amount of falling off in the demand for spiced foods, and the spice-box is not so important a household utensil as it was.

A great portion is occupied by the tropical rain forest region, where the air is constantly moist and there is practically no dry season. This is the great spice-region, where almost every spice mentioned in this work can be cultivated with success. The rainfall is heavy and constant, that is to say, a little falls every day or two, and at the breaks of the monsoon there are generally some very heavy falls, continuing for a whole day or two with little or no break. The temperature is high, but not so great as a little farther north. In this area, beside the rain forest region, we have regions in which there is a distinct dry period, lasting for some months, and followed by heavy rains. During the dry weather the temperature is very high. Such trees as

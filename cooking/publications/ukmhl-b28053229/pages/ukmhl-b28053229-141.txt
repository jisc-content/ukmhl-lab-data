123 Ill NUTMEGS AND MACE Malay Peninsula. Not infrequently a planter will announce with jubilation that his trees have commenced to fruit in the third or fourth year, but this is not a matter for congratulation, as trees which commence to fruit so early are short-lived, and soon crop themselves out. It is much better when they delay fruiting till the ninth year. The fruits ripen in about six months from the flower. When they split and show the seed covered with its brilliant red mace, they are ripe. The fruit is sometimes allowed to fall, and is then picked up, the collector going round the plantation every day and collecting the seed and mace in baskets. But it is more usually gathered by hand, which is preferable. For this a hooked stick is used to pull the fruits off where the tree is low, as it is in the Straits Settlements. In Banda, where the trees are lofty, the gatherer uses a long rod with two deflexed prongs, below which is a small bamboo basket. When the nutmeg is grasped between the prongs and falls off it is caught in the basket, and so does not become bruised by falling to the ground, which injures the mace. Modifications of this rod and basket are used for all kinds of fruits easily injured by bruising all over the Eastern islands. The number of nuts a collector can gather in a day varies according to the height and propinquity of the trees and the amount of crop, but Warburg says a good worker can collect in the full season 1000 to 1500 nuts in a day. In Singapore one man can collect from 100 trees in a day. In Men ado each worker can pluck 40 to 50 trees, and in Banda often 2 or 3 trees will keep a man employed all day. The smaller size of the Malay Peninsula trees is a distinct advantage to the gatherer. YIELD OF THE TREES The actual return in amount of nutmegs given by each tree varies considerably. Some trees are very

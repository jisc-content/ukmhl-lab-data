255 PEPPERS VIII too rapid draining away of the moisture. Level ground lying along a river bank, not too swampy, and free from hooding, is the best situation for a pepper garden. But even if occasionally hooded, little harm is done if the water does not remain over the ground for more than a day. Good drainage is necessary, especially in very low-lying ground, for excessive moisture, as well as excessive dryness, is to be avoided. Salt marshes or ground containing an excess of salt is to be avoided. Altitudes.—Far the greatest amount of pepper plantations lie at about sea-level, or only 200 or 300 ft. above it. Pepper can, however, be cultivated at a higher level with success. Soils.—The richer the soil the more suitable it is for pepper. The plant, like all species of the genus, naturally inhabits dense forests, where it grows on the rich decaying leaf-mould or humus, formed in the woods. The more vegetable soil, therefore, that there is in the ground, the better it is for the vines. The soil in the Straits Settlements and also in Sarawak, where the Chinese have long successfully cultivated the plant, is a stiff yellow clay, very poor in potash and lime. Analyses of similar soils in the Botanic Gardens of Singapore, from spots which were formerly pepper gardens, show the composition of this class of soil to be as follows :— A. B. C.

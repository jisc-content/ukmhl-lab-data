Vli cut off tlie bark as high as they can reach, according to Dr. Schlechter, who made some inquiries for me about this little known cassia bark ; it is not cultivated, nor is the bark of the twigs or shoots taken. The tree is at present very little known. Blume referred it to the genus Cinnamonwm, but Dr. Beccari, who saw some poor scraps collected by Dâ€™Albertis in New Guinea, affirmed that it was not of that genus, but made a new genus for it under the name of Massoia. No description of the plant has yet been published, however ; massoi bark, or meswi bark, as it is called in Singapore, is reported to be very rich in eugenol, but at present is too expensive to be a source of this. Though the plant is not yet in cultivation, I mention it, as there are often inquiries about it.

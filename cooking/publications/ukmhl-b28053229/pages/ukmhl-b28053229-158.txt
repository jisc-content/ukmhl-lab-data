SPICES 140 CHAP. Peninsula gave 200,000 kilos nutmegs and 50,000 kilos mace. West Indies.—The West Indian cultivation appeared first to influence the market in from 1865 to 1874, when 10,000 kilograms of nutmegs and 3000 kilograms of mace were exported ; 1875 to 1885, 10,000 kilos nutmegs and 3000 kilos of mace; 1885 to 1894, 100,000 kilos of nutmegs and 25,000 kilos of mace. The increase of output in the West Indies then increased steadily, so that though the West Indian nutmegs are less hard and more liable to fracture than those of the East Indies, they seem to be gradually ousting the former. Holmes, in tables given by Messrs. Evans, Gray, and Hood (Pharmaceutical Journal, 1909, p. 419), shows that the West Indian nutmegs have trebled in the last ten years, and the price has fallen, apparently in con- sequence of increased supply, to about one-third of the value ten years previously. From an article in the American journal, The Spice-Mill, for November 1908, p. 677, extracted by the editor of the Agricultural News, vol. lx. p. 84, we learn that though the ordinary customer in this country (U.S.A.) never heard of or purchased British West Indian nutmegs under their name, still these articles are being sold to them mixed up with Singapore nutmegs. Owing to the small demand in the United States for the British West Indian nutmegs, because of their inferior quality, the importations are exceedingly light, amounting to 2000 barrels per annum. The nutmegs are shipped principally from Grenada, which island is the heaviest producer of the entire group of the British West Indies, to London. There they are graded as to size and mixed with Singapore nutmegs, then shipped to this market and sold as Singapore nut- megs. The import market value of British West Indian nutmegs is from 10 to 20 per cent below the import price of Singapore nutmegs, both as to size and quality.

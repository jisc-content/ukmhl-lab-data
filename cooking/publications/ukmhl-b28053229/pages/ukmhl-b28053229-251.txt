233 VII CASSIA BARK The oil somewhat resembles cinnamon oil, but has a less pleasant taste. It is exported to London from the south of China, to the extent of 47,517 lbs. in 1869; in 1870, 28,389 lbs. was exported there. Hamburg also takes much of this oil ; thus in 1895 that port received 30,000 lbs. from China and 10,000 lbs. from England; and in 1896, 3,900 lbs. from China and 17,000 lbs. from England.1 CASSIA BUDS These are the dried unripe fruits of the Chinese Cassia. After flowering the sepals of the cinnamons swell up and form a cup in which the small, black, olive- like fruit sits, like an acorn in the cup. These are what, I presume, Cay la, previously quoted, refers to as flowers, as the real flowers are too small to be separated for distilling. The “ buds ” are taken from the Chinese tree when comparatively young ; in the Malayan cassias when adult. They are used in confectionery in place of cinnamon, and, according to Dr. Masters, in the Treasunj of Botany, the Germans and Russians prefer cassia to cinnamon for flavouring chocolate, as it is stronger in taste. Simmonds’s Tropical Agriculture states that the average quantity of cassia buds imported in the thirteen years ending in 1842, was 4,023 lbs., and the consump- tion about 6,700 lbs. He gives the following data of imports :— lbs. Value. 1867 . . 7,356 £467 1868 . . 50,676 3,565 1869 . . 38,861 3,000 1870 . . 29,321 2,226 No later returns are procurable. The earlier exports from China were larger, but decreased. Rondot gives them as 53,333 lbs. in 1848, 31,066 lbs. in 1866, 22,000 lbs. in 1867. 1 Fliickiger and Hanbury, Pharmacographia, p. 532.

284 SPICES CHAI>. ripe at the same time, and one never sees a spike with all the fruits red. There are often many flowers un- fertilised, indeed it would be impossible for every flower on a spike to produce a fully developed fruit; and there are losses from imperfect fertilisation, attacks of insects, and other such causes. A full spike of ordinary length can carry fifty fruits, but a large proportion of spikes are rarely fully filled. In an article in the Koffij Gids, 1900, p. 966, a writer says that the natives of East Java class the fruit- spikes of pepper as follows :— 1. Meritjoh krentil — a bunch furnished well with large peppercorns. 2. Meritjoh ranti—spikes short, and fruit of unequal size. 3. Meritjoh lawee (lawi)—a long bunch with distant, more scanty fruits, ripening at different times. The first of these is nearest to the ideal pepper. Dobree (Ceylon Observer, February 1883) gives an estimate of cost of cultivation for the first three years in Ceylon, which, of course, is to a certain extent dependent on variations in cost of land, labour, etc., but which gives a fair idea of the approximate cost.

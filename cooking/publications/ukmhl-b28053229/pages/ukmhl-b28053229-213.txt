IV CLOVES 195 In medicine clove oil is now but little used, except as a flavouring, and in making pills. Cloves are aromatic, carminative, and stimulant, and are used in cases of dyspepsia, gastric irritation, and in cases of vomiting in pregnancy. The oil is used in decayed teeth, and for toothache generally. In microscopy it is commonly used for clearing sections. For these purposes the mixed oil is generally used, hut it is also largely used in the form of eugenol, the lighter oil being removed. The amount of eugenol in crude oil of cloves varies from 76 to 85 per cent, and especially fine samples contain as much as 90'64 per cent. By the addition of permanganate of potash eugenol can be converted into vanillin, and several patents have been taken out for the processes of this nature. Vanillin is the artificial vanilla used now largely as a substitute for the more expensive natural vanilla (see Vanilla). OTHER PARTS OF THE TREE USED The flower stalks, separated from the cloves when drying, are in some places not wasted. They are dried and exported, chiefly from Zanzibar and Pemba to Bombay and New York, and from the former port are exported to England for adulterating powdered cloves, and for making clove oil. They are moderately aromatic, and yield 5 to 6 per cent of oil of cloves on being distilled, as against 15 to 19 per cent from ordinary clove buds. The stalks are known in Zanzibar as Vikunia; in French as Griffes de Girojle and Pedoncules de Girojleâ€™, in Italian as Fusti andBastaroni; in German as Nelkenstiel. They always fetch a low price, only a few pence a pound. In 1873, 4,200 packages of clove-stalks were sold in London at 3d. to 4d. per lb. Oil from stalks was distilled as early as the sixteenth

Fortunately there was one man, David Brown, who persevered in the cultivation of spices, and after his death his son George continued the work with such spirit and judg- ment that, after thirty years of trial, the cultivation was established on a sound and profitable basis. In 1818 the productive nutmeg trees on the island were estimated at 6900, and in 1836 Captain James Low writes that there were upwards of thirty spice plantations in Penang and Province Wellesley. The biggest of these contained 20,000 trees, and the whole of the estates comprised some 80,000 trees, of which more than half were fully developed and fruiting. The gross annual produce was estimated at 130,000 lb. weight. The Court of Directors in 1803 desired that every encouragement should be given to the Penang spice planters, as Dr. Roxburgh had in the previous year ex- pressed his opinion that this was “ the most eligible spot of all the East India Company’s possession for spice cultivation.” The Penang planters meanwhile com- plained of the duties imposed on their produce, and also desired that the Dutch merchants of Batavia should be prevented from taking advantage of the difference in the taxation of British grown nutmegs and foreign spices, by shipping their produce to Singapore and Malacca, and thence to England and Bengal, to save the extra duty of a shilling a pound imposed on foreign spice.

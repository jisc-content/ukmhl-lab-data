Of course, much depends on the climate in the damp, hot, equatorial rain forest region of the tropics; the growth of all plants is more rapid than in a country with dry seasons or a lower temperature. In the hotter and damper countries from two to three months, and in dryer or colder climates four or five is approximately what may be looked for. RETURNS The returns of capsicums and bird’s-eye chilies are very variously given. A planter in Central Africa, as mentioned above, says he got more than 1 lb. weight per plant, but from 2 to 3 and even 4 lbs. is said to be a good production. These figures are for bird’s-eye chilies. In Montserrat, the Natal variety of Capsicum annuum gave 2,921 lbs. per acre dry, weighing when picked 4,850 lbs., the Nepal variety 2,710 lbs., weighing 7,396 lbs. when fresh. Mukerji says that the yield per acre in India is from 6 to 15 maunds (a maund is 28 lbs.), which sell at 4 to 7 rupees each, giving a value of 24 to 105 rupees per acre, on a cost of production of 50 rupees per acre; not a very good business, and, as he says, unless a tract is known to be particularly adapted for chilies, it is risky growing this crop for profit. PRICES The price of bird’s-eye chilies dried in London varies from £18 to £34 per ton according to their quality and the state of the market. Thus, in August 1900, fair red Zanzibar sold at £39 :10s. per ton, good red Japan at £33 :10s. per ton. A sample from the West Indies fetched £20 per ton. Fresh chilies in Ceylon are worth on the land 10

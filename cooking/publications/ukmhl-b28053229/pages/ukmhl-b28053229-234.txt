PESTS The chief pest recorded as attacking cinnamon is a boring caterpillar, which attacks the shoots. It does not seem to be very injurious. A similar one attacks adult trees in the Malay Peninsula, not only of Cinna- momum zeylanicum, but also of C. iners. It is of a pinkish red colour, and bores into the trunk often quite low down, the entrance to the burrow being usually protected by a web full of the frass of the grub. The insect does not appear ever to have been bred to maturity by entomologists, but it is the larva of a moth. Another pest recorded in the Ceylon Observer1 is the larva of a little moth, Metisor plana, Walker, of the family of Psychidae. It appears to attack many trees and shrubs in the neighbourhood of cultivated land in Ceylon. The larva constructs a portable silken case, more or less covered with bits of stick and leaf of the food plant on which it lives and undergoes its transformation. It eats the leaves and tender tops of the plants, owing to which the cinnamon cannot be peeled. It is difficult to deal with these bag-worms, as they are commonly called, as they are so well protected by their silk case that poisonous liquids thrown on them do not affect them. Mr. Green, who identified them, suggests that washing the trees with lime-water, or syringing with soft-soap and tobacco water might induce them to depart. The “experienced planter’' already quoted mentions a minute beetle which breeds in the leaves, and sometimes does a good deal of injury by retarding the growth and rendering the wood un- healthy and unpeelable. The larva of what is probably one of the Tortricidae moths I have frequently seen in the leaves of adult trees, both of C. zeylanicum and C. iners. It spins two leaves together, feeding on the epidermis and de-

PIMENTO OR ALLSPICE V 199 CULTIVATION The tree is raised from seed. The ripe seed is washed to free it of the pulp of the fruit, which, if not removed, becomes hard and dry, and prevents the germination. However, most of the Jamaica planta- tions have been formed by clearing the bush and allowing the seedlings, which spring from seed carried about and dispersed by birds, to grow. The best results have been obtained when the trees are planted 20 ft. apart. The soil may be poor, so long as it is fairly light and well drained. Mr. W. Bancroft Espeut, in a lecture on the timbers of Jamaica, describes the method of cultivation thus :— It is only necessary to dig the soil in order to loosen it and remove old stumps and roots, to lay, say, 1 in. of leafy mould and sand in equal parts on the surface, water it well if the weather is dry, and scatter, not bury, the quite ripe fresh- gathered pimento berries, and cover the land with straw or some other shade-yielding material, and keep it moist. In a very short time, three or four weeks, thousands of young seed- lings will make their appearance. These should be thinned out, the surplus seedlings being transplanted to other land suitably prepared. Care must be taken not to remove the shade stuff too suddenly, but gradually, so as to harden off the young plants. The trees can be grown to an elevation of about 3,000 ft. in the West Indies, and commence to flower when they are from seven to ten years old. The crops of berries increase each year till the tree reaches maturity, that is to say, when it is about eighteen or twenty years old. It will continue to bear, if properly treated, for a great number of years, longer, indeed, than the average life of a man. Mr. Adam Roxburgh, in an account given in CundalTs Jamaica in 1905, states that growers of all- spice distinguish between fruitful or bearing trees and unfruitful or so-called “ male” trees. The two trees are

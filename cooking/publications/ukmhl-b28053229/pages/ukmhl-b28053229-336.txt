SPICES ,•3 IS CHAP. is used also in veterinary medicines, but has practically gone out of European pharmacopoeias. In Malay regions it is used for indigestion, colic, and flatulency, and as an unguent in paralysis, in much the same way as black pepper is in other parts of the world. The bark of the stem is also used in native medicines for similar purposes, but is less strong. This appears to be the commonest of the two long peppers exported to Europe, and is chiefly shipped from Singapore and Penang. It is imported here mainly from Java and Bali, and is exported again principally to British India, England, Turkey in Asia, China, and a little to the United States, Germany, etc. Out of 3,366 cwt. imported into Singapore in 1871, only 477 cwt. went to England; most of the rest went to India. The export from Penang was about 2,000 or 3,000 piculs annually, probably derived from Sumatra. The following imports and exports into and from the Straits Settlements for every five years from 1885 give some idea of the trade. Previous to that date it o was registered with black pepper, so that figures of earlier date cannot be given.

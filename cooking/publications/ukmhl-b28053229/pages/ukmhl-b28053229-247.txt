VII CASSIA BARK 229 CASSIA BARK OR CASSIA LIGNEA The most valued Chinese cassia bark approaches nearly to cinnamon from Ceylon. It is sold in simple quills, not inserted one within the other. They are less straight, even, and regular, and darker brown, and though some are extremely thin, others are much stouter than fine 'cinnamon. In fact, it is less uniform. The outer coat is removed with less care. It is imported in small bundles about 1 ft. in length and 1 lb. in weight, the pieces being bound together with bits of bamboo. Good cassia has the flavour of cinnamon, and is as sweet and aromatic, though it is often described as less fine and delicate in flavour. It is probable that by more careful preparation and selection, after the methods in use in the cultivation of cinnamon by the Ceylon planters, a form of cassia might be turned out which would be nearly or quite as good as true cinnamon. The plant might be cultivated in many places where cinnamon would not be satisfactory, as it seems to be less particular as to soil and climate. The returns of trade show that there is a good demand for it, though at the same time this is probably due to its being cheaper than the finely turned out Ceylon cinnamon, for it appears to be chiefly used as a substitute for the latter. CULTIVATION Mr. Ford gives the area of cultivation as follows :— There are three chief districts where the cassia is cultivated, viz.: Taiwa, Lat. 23° 34' N. and Long. 110° 18' E., in the Kwangsi province; Lukpo, in Lat. 23° 6' N. and Long. 112° 24' E.; and Loting, Lat. 22° 51' N. and Long. 111° 8' E., both in Kwantung province. These are the market towns of the district, but the cassia is cultivated over a large area of country, stretching to considerable distances from the town. The cultivation was found to be very extensive, especially at Loting, where one of the largest cultivators said there were about 1,000,000 maus (about 52,600

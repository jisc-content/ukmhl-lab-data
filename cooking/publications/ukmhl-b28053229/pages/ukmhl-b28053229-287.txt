VIII PEPPERS 269 Free Press (May 1888) recommended the burning of bulky manures to prevent them attracting termites and other injurious insects, or mixing them with soil. He mentions that he has seen castor cake applied to the vines, both to the surface and below the soil, and that in both cases the result was the death of the vine. There does not seem to be any record of the use of chemical manures or guano, etc., for pepper. C. P. K. Nair in the Tropical Agriculturist, June 1906, p. 562, points out that heavy manuring may damage the support tree, which is serious, as he says that vines transferred to fresh standards do not last more than three years and their yield is affected. The destruction of the support is certainly serious, for apart from the difficulty of transferring the vine without injury, the new tree will take some time to grow before it can support the mass of pepper vine. The Chinese do, however, frequently find a pepper stake fallen and replace it successfully, and in the case of the death of a tree-support, a stake could be used to replace it. But the danger to the support by over-manuring is one which should not be overlooked. PESTS AND DISEASES The pepper is liable to a variety of diseases, both animal and vegetable, as almost every cultivated plant is. Insect Pests.â€”Many years ago I found in the stems of pepper, or more accurately the shoots, a burrowing beetle larva, apparently one of the Rliyncliophora. It was a very small species, boring vertically up the shoot, which blackened and fell off. I failed to rear the insect. In a case of an attack like this, the shoots showing signs of withering should be at once cut off arid burned. I have not met with it since. The roots of the pepper are, in Sarawak at least, subject to the attacks of large larvae of some Lamellicorn beetle, perhaps those of Oryctes rhinoceros. They are

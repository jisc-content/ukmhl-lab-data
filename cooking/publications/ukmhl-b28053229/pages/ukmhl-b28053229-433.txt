GINGER XIII 415 The Fijian ginger is thus seen to be the richest in active constituents. WEST INDIES As has been previously mentioned, Jamaica has been the most important island for the ginger industry, and holds a very high rank in its production. The cultivation commenced before 1547, and has been steady ever since. The actual area under cultivation is difficult to estimate, as a very considerable proportion is in small areas, in fact, in garden plots. The government returns only give, according to Kilmer, 250 acres under ginger, but this amount of acreage would not yield the crop harvested. Many cultivators have beds from 6 ft. square to the size of a building lot, and a few cultivate from 1 to 6 acres. For the most part it is put in the ground in any convenient spot, alongside pineapples, yams, cacao, cassava, or other plants, often in the midst of a dense growth of bush or weeds. Mr. Kilmer judges “ that from 25,000 to 50,000 persons are, more or less, dependent on the ginger crop for such ready money as is essential to maintain their existence.” The following are records of exports from Jamaica.

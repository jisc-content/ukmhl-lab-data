435 XIV TURMERIC food of the native, and there has been no demand for the spice. India.—Turmeric is cultivated in most parts of India, and proves a very remunerative crop, at least to the natives. It does not seem ever to be cultivated by Europeans. It is difficult to get an account of the area under cultivation, but Dr. McCann (Watt’s Dictionary) gives the following estimates as approximate :— The trade in India is, of course, largely local, as so much is used all over the East in curry stuffs and in native medicines and dyes. The export trade is chiefly to England, France, and the United States, and it seems to be there more used as a dye than as a spice. It is said also to be used to adulterate mustard. The exports from Bengal are given by Mr. 0’Conor in his Review of trade in 1876 to 1877 as 123,824 cwt., valued at 10^ lacs of rupees. It fell off in demand next year, and in 1881 to 1882 the exports were 70,783 cwt., valued at 3,66,047 rupees. In 1885 to 1886, it so far recovered that the exports amounted to 156,287 cwt., valued at nearly 14 lacs of rupees. In 1888, they amounted to 140,994 cwts., valued at 10,32,025 rupees. The exports to Europe have never been very large, for, in 1869, we find that only 64,280 cwt. and in 1870, 44,900 cwt., were imported into Europe; Calcutta exporting 59,352 cwt. in 1870 to 1871, and Bombay, in 1871, 29,780. In Ceylon, I find no record of cultivation except very locally, nor does it seem ever to have been exported. In the Malay peninsula and islands it is cultivated for Acres. Punjab . Bengal . Madras .

301 VIII PEPPERS their spending much time at the headquarters of the Colony, added to which was the reduction of the tax on pepper from the French colonies in France. Chinese from Cochin - China settled in Cambodia, and even Cambodians commenced planting. At the time of the writing of this report, M. Leclerc says that in four pepper-producing provinces there were thirty-seven villages engaged in this planting, 3,357 planters, and 1,773,561 plants of different ages on the estates. The greater number of the planters were Chinese, but there were nearly as many Cambodians and a few Malays and Annamites. The author of this report says that France and its colonies use at most 3,000,000 kilograms of pepper. Cambodia and Cochin-China in very good years can produce about 2,325,000 kilos, 1,800,000 in ordinary years, and 1,500,000 kilos in bad years, so that these colonies could produce a large portion of the pepper required by France. The Cambodian pepper, however, cannot compete with that of Singapore, Tellicherry, and Cochin, which are cheaper and better known on the European markets. He gives the following estimate of cost and returns : one hectare of 2,500 to 2,800 vines in good soil and well manured gives 70 to 100 piculs prepared pepper (20 to 30 vines giving a picul at most). Taking the lowest figure, 70 piculs, and the pepper down to 25 dollars, the return is 1,750 dollars a hectare. The expenses are never more than 1,100 dollars for a Chinaman who does not work himself, or 900 for a working Chinaman, so that the planter gets a very fair return for his labour. By 1906 the pepper plantations had so much increased in Cochin-China and Cambodia, according to Mr. Le Roy, that the supply had exceeded the demand in France, and more than half had to be re-exported to other markets, where it had to compete with pepper from other countries often superior in quality and actually cheaper.

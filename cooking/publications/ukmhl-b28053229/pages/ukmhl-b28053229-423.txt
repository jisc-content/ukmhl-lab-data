GINGER XIII 405 chloride, but these did not equal native sun-dried ginger, and slicing and drying resulted, as might be expected, in a loss of aroma, SORTING AND SHIPPING The buyers in Jamaica sort the spice, and value it according to condition, in the following grades. The highest grades are large-sized hands of light and uniform colour, free from any trace of mildew. They are brittle and crack easily, but broken pieces depreciate the value. They should be firm and full, without wrinkles or spots. Shrivelled and small hands form another grade, and dark varieties another; the heavy, tough, and flinty are another grade. Of these grades the best in texture and colour are selected for a second class grade. Ratoon ginger usually brings the lowest price, as the hands are small and soft and less aromatic. When gathered too young the ginger shrivels a good deal, and is less aromatic and pungent. Mildewed ginger is spotted, and acquires a musty flavour, impossible to eradicate. The dried ginger is packed for shipment in barrels, the common kind in bags. Formerly it was exported in casks of a size equivalent to four or five barrels. PESTS I do not find many pests recorded for this plant, nor have I seen any insects or fungi attacking the plant myself. The chief danger seems to be from one or more fungi, of which the worst is known as Black-rot. This disease is described by W. Harris and Mr. Howard in the Jamaica Bulletin, 1901, p. 180, and 1902, p. 42. The disease, says Mr. Harris, is well known in Jamaica, and affected plants are easily detected. The symptoms are sickly yellow foliage, the stem black and decaying, and the rhizomes also black and decomposed.

In this case, allowing that he himself tended the plants till bearing, the outlay would be confined to brushing the scrub, cost of plants, and planting. The estimate is high on account of the higher cost of white labour than black, and on account of the high price of vanilla plants in Queensland at the time. If there were a demand among planters for stock, a Government Botanic Gardens should be able to supply them at two or three pence a piece. In another part of the tropics, where labour is much cheaper, the cost could be very materially reduced. He gives the profit as follows : “ Scrub brushed so as to leave 250 trees to the acre, and two vines to each tree, and producing on an average twenty-five to thirty pods per vine, which in turn on curing, average, say, 125 to the lb., would give a return of 100 to 125 lb. of marketable vanilla to the acre, which at an average of 10s. a lb. represents £50 to £60 an acre. These figures, shown to be readily attainable by the experi- mental plot at Kamerunga, might possibly be exceeded by devoting more detailed attention to the plantation.” The profit per acre is given in the Seychelles at £250, and in Tahiti at £120 or so. Of course, where support-trees have to be planted or trellises made and kept up, these expenses would have to be reckoned, and there are the costs of preparing, packing, and shipping to be added; still with all these there remains a very substantial profit even under

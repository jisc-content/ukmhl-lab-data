106 SPICES CHAP. and Province Wellesley, and I can certainly testify that the temperature of the nutmeg hills in the hotter parts of the hot days in Penang is extremely high. At the same time it must be noticed that on the nights following these extremely hot days there is a very heavy fall of dew, which compensates largely for the loss of water which the plant must undergo in the hot weather. The temperature in the shade during these times is 84Â°. Then again, even during the hotter months, rain-storms are not infrequent, so that there is never a continuous dry spell of some three or four months, as occurs farther north. In estimating a rain- fall as suitable to any form of cultivation, it is not sufficient to take the actual number of inches which fall in the year. Climates may have a full rainfall for the tropical rain forest region, but they may be quite unsuited for a plant of that region, because the rain falls excessively heavy at one time and does not fall at all at another; the result being that the climate is too wet at one time and too dry at another, and either the wet or dry spell may kill the plant. In 1895, Mr. Hart published a circular showing the influence of the rainfall on the fruiting of the plant in Trinidad, from observations taken for five years on the trees in the botanic gardens there. Monthly average of nuts per annum. Rainfall. 1890 . 262 82-90 1891 . 181 53-74 1892 . 257 91-14 1893 . 335 92-49 1894 . 234 52-21 This seems to show that the diminution of the rain- fall is accompanied by a falling off in the crop, the biggest crop being obtained when the rainfall was highest (over 90 in.), the lowest when it was under 60 in. He further says that the rainfall should be not less than 65 in. in the year, but that 80 to 90 in. are better for this cultivation. Certainly 65 in. is low for the

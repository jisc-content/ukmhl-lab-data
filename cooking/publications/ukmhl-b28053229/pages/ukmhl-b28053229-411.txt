XIII GINGER 393 CULTIVATION Climate.—The area in which ginger can be and has been successfully cultivated is perhaps larger than that occupied by any other spice; although there are a good many regions in which it might be grown, but which have as yet not produced any quantities. In India, both in the low country and up to an elevation of 4,000 to 5,000 ft. in the Himalayas, in the wet regions of the Malay Peninsula and the Malay Archipelago, in China round Canton, in Fiji and North Australia, in West Africa and as far south as Natal, and in the West Indies and Central America, it thrives and is cultivated suc- cessfully. It does best, perhaps, where there is a resting period of dry weather, but samples grown in the rain-forest region of Malaya, where there is no dry season, would be difficult to beat anywhere. It requires a tropical or sub-tropical regibn, where the temperature is high for at least part of the year, but it thrives at Canton, where the winter temperature is very low. Brilliant sunshine is necessary for it, as well as a heavy rainfall. In the ginger region of Jamaica the mean annual rainfall is given by Kilmer as 88 in., while that of the Malay Peninsula is about 98. Soils.—The best soil for ginger is a light, free, sandy loam. Stiff clays or coarse sands are quite unsuitable for its cultivation. In the Straits Settlements, where the soil mostly consists of a stiff yellow clay, deficient in lime, phosphorus, and potash, the Chinese grow it successfully by thoroughly digging the soil over and working the manure, chiefly cow-dung, into the soil till it is thoroughly broken up and pulverised. With- out such improvement the plant fails to grow or to produce good rhizomes. The ginger soil of Jamaica is thus described by Kilmer : “ The underlying soil of this district consists of white and yellow limestone, with trappean formations. This is covered, in some of the nooks or valleys, with a pulverulent mould or loam

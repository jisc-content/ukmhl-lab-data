SPICES 198 CHAP. entire, dark-green above, paler and gland-dotted beneath, with a prominent mid-rib 4 to 6 in. long. They are very aromatic when fresh, abounding in essential oil. The bovvers are in trichotomous panicles on the ends of the branches. They are very small, white, and fragrant. The calyx has four rounded lobes. The petals areÂ°four, rounded and greenish white. The stamens are very numerous, longer than the petals, and white. The fruit is a black or purple one-seeded drupe, about the size of a pea, from j? to in. through. When ripe it has a sweet pulp, but then loses much of its aromatic property, and thus is gathered before fully mature. DISTRIBUTION Allspice is a native of the West Indies, occurring on calcareous soil near the coast on the islands of Cuba, Hayti, Trinidad, Domingo, and more or less in all the islands of the Caribbean Sea, but it is most abundant in Jamaica, which island produces the greater part of the commercial spice. The tree occurs also in Mexico, Costa Rica, and Venezuela. The Mexican spice is, however, inferior, larger, but less aromatic. It is believed to be the produce of a distinct variety of Pimenta officinalis, and is known as Pimienta de Tabasco. It does not appear that the tree has been success- fully cultivated in any part of the world, except where it is indigenous, though attempts seem to have been made in most of the tropical colonies. In the Botanic Gardens in Singapore there were a few trees of this plant for many years, and though they dowered regularly they never produced any fruit. Nor does it seem to have done any better in Ceylon, where it is said to have been introduced as early as 1824. Bernays, in Cultural Industries for Queensland, mentions a fruiting tree in the Brisbane Botanic Gardens about 15 ft. tall and fifteen years old, but it does not appear that there was any extension of the cultivation.

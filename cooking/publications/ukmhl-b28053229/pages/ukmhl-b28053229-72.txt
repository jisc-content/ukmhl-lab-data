54 SPICES CHAP. As stated above, however, M. Dupont in 1902 was successful in raising plants from seed. CURING The drying and curing of the pods after gathering is the most important part of the work of the planter, and requires the greatest attention and care, for the value of the product depends more on this process than on any other part of the cultivation. It must be remembered that at first, when the pod is ripe, it has not the characteristic odour of vanilla, which is developed during a process of fermentation which takes place while the fruit is drying. The pod, while green, consists of an acid pulp con- taining raphides and crystals of oxalate of lime; and there is also a citron-coloured oil surrounding the minute seeds. This oil possesses an odour somewhat resembling that produced by the fully-ripened pod. If left on the plant, the pod begins to turn yellow7 at the lower end and gives off an odour of bitter almonds. The pod begins to split into two unequal valves, and a small quantity of a dark balsamic oil, of a brown or red colour, is produced. Gradually the pod darkens in colour from brown to black. The epidermis softens and the real vanilla odour develops. The oil, which is called “ Balsam of vanilla,” then increases in quantity. This balsam is carefully collected by the planters in Peru and other parts of South America, but not sent to Europe. The pods, ripening slowdy upwards from the tip, take about a month to fully ripen. Eventually, if left, the pods become dry and black aud brittle, and are then scentless. The artificial methods in use for curing the vanilla, by the aid of hot water, or sun heat, or stove heat, are intended to hasten the maturity, to produce a uniform ripening of the pod throughout its entire length all at once, and to prevent splitting of the pod and conse- quently loss of the perfume.

SPICES 254 CHAK year 1775 in Sumatra, when, for a period of eight months, scarcely a shower of rain fell to moisten the earth. The vines were deprived of their foliage, many gardens perished, and a general destruction was expected. But this apparent calamity was attended with a con- sequence not foreseen, though analogous to the usual operations of nature in that climate. The vines, as soon as the rains began to descend, threw out blossoms in a profusion unknown before; old gardens which had been unprolific for two or three years began to bear, and accordingly the crop of 1776-1777 considerably surpassed that of many preceding years.‚Äù The necessity (as the Chinese have noticed) for protecting the roots in the open fields against excessive sun-heat by covering the ground with cut grass, or the refuse gambir leaves, and the healthier appearance of vines grown under light shade, among fruit trees and the like, also evidence the fact that pepper does not like continuous and excessive heat and dryness. It is a high-rooting plant, and its roots are very liable to be affected by excessive heat and dryness of the soil, which is often shown in neglected, exposed plantations by the sickly yellow colouring of the leaves. The rainfall in the Straits Settlements is heavy and continuous, being evenly spread throughout the year. In the great pepper region of the west coast of India the rainfall is also very heavy, from 70 to 100 in. a year. SOILS AND SITUATIONS All writers on pepper seem to agree that flat land is more suitable for pepper cultivation than the slopes of hills. The Chinese in Borneo and the Straits Settle- ments make a point of selecting flat spaces among the hills, in preference to the steeper declivities. Gentle hill slopes can be used, and even steeper ones if they are terraced. If the hills are too steep, they are apt to suffer from the heavy wash of the tropical rainstorms, and in the dryer seasons are liable to drought from the

253 PEPPERS VIII Kelantan, 2,000 tons; Borneo, Banjermasin, 12 to 1,500 tons. Java, Bantam, 500 tons ; Siam, Chantabun, 1,000 tons. In 1829 the Malayan cultivation had increased greatly. Milburn (Watt’s Dictionary, p. 819) gives the following figures: Sumatra, 16,800 piculs; Bintang, Lingga, and other neighbouring islands, 12,000 piculs; Malay Peninsula, 28,000 piculs; Siam, East coast, 10.000 piculs; Borneo, 20,000; India, West coast, 30.000 piculs (16'8 piculs make a ton). The cultivation of pepper in Singapore and Johore increased to a very large extent after the founding of Singapore in 1822, the cultivation being in the hands of the Chinese, who combined its cultivation with that of gambir till about 1894, when, owing to the fall in price, and to the scarcity of firewood for cooking the gambir, the plantations gradually died out. A good deal still remains in Johore, however, and of late years (1909, 1910) the cultivation has shown signs of returning.

It requires a heavy rainfall, and though a dry season of some duration does not appear to injure it, a very prolonged dry period, or too long exposure to sun, certainly affects it adversely. Long- continued droughts, as Marsden1 remarks, stop the vegetation of the vines and retard the produce. “ This,” he says, “ was particularly experienced in the 1 History of Sumatra, p. 106.

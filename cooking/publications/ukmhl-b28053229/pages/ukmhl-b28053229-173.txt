155 CHAPTER IV CLOVES The cloves of commerce are the unopened flower-buds of the clove tree, Eugenia caryophyllata, Thunb. This is a small tree belonging to the large order Myrtaceae, which contains a very great number of species of the genus Eugenia, natives of tropical and subtropical regions all over the world. Aromatic as many of the plants of this order are, none are as highly so as this species, and none are as valuable in commerce. The clove tree is usually of no great size, generally about 12 to 20 ft. tall, but in some places they attain a height of 40 ft. The stem is usually forked, and has often two or three erect main branches. The smaller branches are usually sub-erect, and do not spread widely, so that the tree is bushy and more or less cone-shaped. The twigs are slender and rather brittle, with grey bark. The bark of the trunk is also grey, and somewhat smooth. The leaves are lanceolate-acute at both ends, or sub-acute at the tip, and narrowed at the base into a slender leaf stalk. Above, they are dark shining green; below, paler, thinly coriaceous. The nerves are numerous, but not very conspicuous. The blade of the leaf is 3 to 5 in. long and from 1 to 1|- in. wide. The leaves of trees grown in shade are thinner, less stiff, and larger than those grown in full sun.

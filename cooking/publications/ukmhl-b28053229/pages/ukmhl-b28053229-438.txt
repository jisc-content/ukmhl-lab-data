SlMCES 420 CHAP. was greater when the rhizomes were dried by artificial heat than when they were dried by sun-heat. Extracts from ratoon ginger had a more fiery taste and less flavour than those from planted ginger, and yellow ginger had a better and finer odour and taste in the extracted oil than was the case in blue ginger. Upon the addition of water to the extracts to precipitate the resins, it was found that a delightful aroma, a true ginger flavour without fire or pungency, was imparted to the water. But in extracts from old ratoon ginger or mildewed specimens spoiled in drying the aroma was changed, being musty and weak. 95 per cent alcohol was found to give a better result as to flavour than that of a lower strength. Cheap ginger for distilling purposes has been obtain- able from Africa at advantageous rates in Liverpool and Hamburg (SchimmeVs Half- Yearly Circular). CHEMISTRY The rhizomes of ginger contain three constituents of value, viz. starch, oil, and resin. It is to the oil of ginger that the odour of ginger is due; the pungent taste is due to the resin. Mr. J. C. Thresh (Year-Book of Pharmacy, 1879, 1881, 1882) very completely analysed the gingers of commerce, and describes gingerol, the active principle of ginger, as a viscid fluid of the consistency of treacle, of a pale straw colour, devoid of odour, and with an extremely pungent and slightly bitter taste. The essential oil is of a pale straw colour, a somewhat camphoraceous odour, and an aromatic but not pungent taste. He discovered the fact that a selected sample of Jamaica ginger contained only about half the quantity of essential oil found in the Cochin and African samples, and less of the active principle than the African, though about as much as the Cochin gingers. Though less, however, in quantity, the volatile oil of the Jamaica ginger possessed a finer bouquet than the others (Wattâ€™s Dictionary of Economic Plants).

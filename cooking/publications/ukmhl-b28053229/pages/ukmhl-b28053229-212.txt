Cloves are used also for chewing, to sweeten the breath, and are used by betel-nut chewers as an addition to the betel-nut, sirili leaf, etc. They have also long had a reputation as a cure for toothache. A large proportion, especially of inferior cloves, are used for the manufacture of clove oil. Oil of Cloves.—Few plants are as rich in oil as the clove, and the oil is of considerable value. It was first obtained by distillation in the fifteenth century, and is manufactured to the present day in considerable quan- tities chiefly in England. The cloves are distilled either whole or ground up, and according to the method of distillation whether by water or dry steam, the light oil or the heavier one containing much eugenol is obtained. The oil, as collected in receivers, partly sinks and partly floats in water. The light oil of cloves is a sesquiterpene, and is separated either by the method of distilling or by distilling the crude oil. The heavier oil is an oxygenated oil, chiefly consisting of eugenol. Normal oil of cloves is a mixture of the two oils. The crude oil is colourless or yellow, darkening with age and exposure to the air. The amount of oil obtained from the clove buds varies considerably in amount. It is estimated that Amboyna cloves produce as much as 19 per cent of oil, Bourbon and Madagascar 18 per cent, Zanzibar 15 to 17-5 percent. The oil of Madagascar cloves is specially favoured by French perfumers, as having a particularly agreeable perfume. The Zanzibar and Pemba cloves, however, are the ones almost exclusively used for the oil. Uses of Clove Oil.—Clove oil combines well with grease, soap, and spirit, and is thus used for perfumery and articles for the toilet. Essence of cloves, used for flavouring confectionery, liqueurs, etc., is made by dissolving 4 oz. of clove oil in one gallon of spirit.

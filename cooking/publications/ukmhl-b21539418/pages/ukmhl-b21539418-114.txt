IIO CARDS CARDS aijout 4 in 100 only. saries are eight, and you have no hon- our ; but not if you have four trumps, unless you have a sequence. 6 Lead a trump if you have four or five, or a strong hand ; but not if weak. 7 Having ace, king, and two or three small cards, lead ace and king if weak in trumps, but a small one, if strong in them. 8 If you have the last trump, with some winning cards, and one losing card only, lead the losing card. 9 Return your partner's lead, not the adversary’s ; and if you have only three originally, play the best; but you need not return it immediately when you win with the king, queen, or knave, and have only small ones ; or when you hold a good sequence, have a strong suit, or have five trumps. 10 Do not lead from ace queen, or ace knave. n Do not lead an ace unless you have a king. la Do not lead a thirteenth card un- less trumps are out. 13 Do not trump a thirteenth card, unless you are last player, or want the lead. 14 Keep a small card to return your partner's lead. 15 Be cautious in trumping a card when strong in trumps, particularly if you have a strong suit. 16 Having oniy a few small trumps, make them when you can. 17 If your partner refuses to trump a suit of which he knows you have not the best, lead your best trump. 18 When you hold all the remaining trumps, play one, and then try to put the lead in your partner’^ hand. 19 Remember how many of each suit are out, and what is the best card left in each hand. 20 Never force your partner if you are weak in trumps, unless you have a re- nounce, or want the odd trick. 21 When playing for the odd trick, be cautious of trumping out, especially if your partner is likely to trump a suit; and make all the tricks you can early, and avoid finessing. 22 If you take a trick, and have a sequence, win it with the lowest. Second Hand. 23 Having ace. king, and small ones, play a small one if strong in trumps, but the king if weak ; and having ace, king, queen, or knave only, with a small one, play the small one. Third Hand. 24 Having ace and queen, play the queen, and if it wins, return the ace, and in all other cases play the best if your partner leads a small one. 25 Neglect not to make the odd trick when in your power. 26 Attend to the score, and play the game accordingly. 27 Do not part with the card turned up till the last. 28 When in doubt win the trick ; and be sure to 29 Keep your temper.

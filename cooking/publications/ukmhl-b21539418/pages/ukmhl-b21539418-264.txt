260 MEN MEN of the mind, application of cold to the feet, frequent abortions or child-bearing, and whatever will induce great laxity, •as living much in warm chambers, and especially drinking much of warm enervating liquors, such as tea and coffee. Treatment.—Remove immediate- ly all exciting causes of this disease. The flux must not be stopped, but moderated ; avoid an erect posture, and external heat, as warm chambers, and soft beds ; by using a light, cool, and unexciting diet; by obviating costive- ness, as before directed ; or use castor oil and lenitive electuary; the external and internal use of astringents, to con- stringe the vessels of the womb, as the application of cloths sprinkled with vinegar and water over the region of the womb ; and three table-spoonfuls of the following mixture every three or four hours :—red rose-leaves, % oz; Infuse in a pint of boiling water, till cold ; then strain; add elixir of vitriol, 60 drops, tincture of rhatany root, 1 oz. A gentle emetic may be of great service, see page 172. The Diaphoretic Powder page 160, is of great service in this case. An injection of cold water into the rectum may check an immoderate flow. Obstructed Menstruation.—It Is often caused by exposure to cold during the menstrual discharge, to wet feet, cold bathing, great mental fear and anxiety, &c., just before the periodical time of discharge. The obstruction injures the health, if it continues two or three periods. Give the Composition Powder, page 134, or the Diaphoretic Powder, page 160, when the patient is in bed, and place bricks covered with vinegar and water cloths to the feet and sides, or give the Vapour Bath. Take also Peruvian bark infused in port wine. In short, use the same means as pre- scribed under Chlorosis. Take also the Female Pill, page 178. MENTAL CALCULATIONS. RULE I.

Ascertain the amount at one shilling, and multiply it by the price. If 3 pence occur in the price, add one quarter of what it amounts to at a shilling; if 4 pence, add one third; if 6 pence, add half; if 9 pence, add three quarters. If the pence in the price be not an aliqnot part of a shilling, find for the shillings by this rule, and for the pence by the rule for pence, which amounts add together. 80 Gals, at 13s. per gal. 80 at is.=j^4X iSs. =jC6o.

MEN 261 MEN multiplying the ntaillings of the price by the number of £ that the quantity amounts to at is., which will produce the answer in £. 150 Tons at job. ijo=j61 ios. x jo=jFz3J. Am. To calculate evsts. qrs. lbs.—Set down the ousts., to the right put the lit. contained in the qrs. and lit. to which add 13 lbs. for each nut., which will give the total number of lbs. If the price per lb. be pence, con- sider them as pence; if shillings, consider them as shillings. j cwts. 3 qrs. 30 lbs. at 6d. per lb. Thus: —j cwts.; place after the 5 the number of the lbs.

Number of lbs. 1783 lbs. as pence,—£q 8s. 6d. x lojd.—3^77 19s. jd. Ans. In calculating «ru, roods, and perches, reckon the acres as pounds, multiply the roods by J, the product consider as shil- lings, and the perches by i^d. (which is the price of a perch at £1 per acre) which will give the amount of the whole at £1 per acre, which multiply by the number of pounds per acre. 80 acres, 3 roods, 8 perches, at £3 10s. per acre. £. 8. d. 80 3 8 S i* 80 11 ox ji—^381 18s 6d. Am. Troy Wsioht.—The qrs. are to be con- sidered as half-pence, the dusts, as shil- lings, and oxs. as pounds. 13 ozs. 8 dwts. 4 grs. at 6s. 8d. per oz. 6s. 8d.—\£ £12 8 3 £4 3 8} Am. To find the value of an ounce, the price per lb. being given. Take the shillings as farthings, and multiply by 3 for Avoirdupois; for Troy, multiply by 4. Thus i oz. Avoirdupois at 43. per lb. 4x3—13 farthings—3d. Am. The price of a pound of Avoirdupois being known, to find the price of a stone of 14 pounds. For every penny In the price of a pound, take one shilling and twopence for the stone : thus a stone at 3d. per lb. cost 3s. 6d. at 8d. 9s. 4d. For a farthing in the price of a lb. reckon 3$d. in the stone; for a half-penny, 7d.; and, for three farthings, io$d.; as a stone at yid. per lb. comes to 10s. 6d. and 3*d. or ios. qjd. at 4$d., 4s. 8d. and 7d. or 38. 3d. and at 6jd., 7s. iofcd. The price of a pound being given, to find that of a hundred-weight or 113 lbs. For every farthing in the price of a pound,, take twice the number of shillings, and four times the number of pence. Example t 1 cwt. at aid. per lb. agd.—10 farthings. 10 times 3—30, the shillings, 10 times 4— 40, the pence, and these added, make £1 3s. 4d. To find the value of a lb., the price per cwt. being given.—Multiply the shillings in the price by 3, and divide by 7 for the price of a pound in farthings.— Thus, 1 lb. at 14s. per cwt. 14x34-7=6 farthings—lid. Am. From the price of a Cwt., to find that ot a Ton. For every shilling reckon a pound, for threepence, a crown, and for every half- penny over, tenpence. As, at £3 9s. 8d. a cwt., how much a ton ? Am. £bg and 10s. and 3s. 4d. or £bq 133. 4d. By reversing the process, the price of a cwt. may be found from that of a ton, thus, a ton at £34 16s. 8d. how much a cwt? Am. 34shillings, 3 threepences, and 3 half- pence, or £1 14s. iod. When the price of one is known, to find that of 100. For every farthing in the price of one, take twice as many shillings, and once as many pence. Thus, 100 articles at ai each aj—9 far things, 9 times 3— 18s. and gd. give 18s. gd. Am. 100 lbs. at j}d. per lb. 5J—31 farthings, 31 times 3—43 shillings, or £1 33. and aid.— is. gd. then, £3 as. and is. 9d.—£2 38. gd. the price of a hundred at the given rate. To find what any number of pence per day, will amount to in a year. Add together as many pounds, half as many pounds, and as many fi-vepences as there are pence per day, and their sum will be the answer. Examples. What does a boy Who earns 3d. a day gain in a year? Am. £3 and £1 10s. and isd. or £4 ns. jd» What will 8d. a day amount to in a year? £8 and £4 and js. 4d. or £12 3s. ad. Or, take 365 days as pence—£1 ios. Jd. which multiply by the number of pence per day. To find the amount of any number of pence per day, (Sunday excepted) for 2 year. For every penny a day, take so many Guineas, Crowns, and Pence; thus at gd. a day—£g 98. and 9 crowns—£3 js. and’ gd. The sum—j£n 14s. yd. To find the price of a Gross, the price of one article being given.—Take the pence in- the price of one article as shillings, and the number of pence in these shillings will be- the price of a gross in shillings.

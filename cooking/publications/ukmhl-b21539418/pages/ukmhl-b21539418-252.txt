Dorvanlt, an eminent German Chemist. It is suitable for all kinds of white goods. Crystallized nitrate of silver, 1 dr.; water of ammonia, 3 drs,; crystallized carbonate of soda, 1 dr.; powdered gum arabic, x\ drs. ; sulphate of copper, 30 gTS. ; distilled water, 4 grs. Dissolve the silver salt in the am- monia ; dissolve the carbonate of soda, gum arabic, and sulphate of copper in the distilled water, and mix the 2 solu- tions together. MARMALADE CREAM. — Take 2 tablespoonfuls of orange marma- lade ; add to it a quart of cream ; a little, at first, for mincing the marmalade, a wine-glassful of brandy ; 8 ozs. of ground loaf sugar, and the juice of a lemon ; whisk it for half an hour ; and drain. Serve in custard glasses. MARMALADE, Currant. Take white, or red currants ; press out the juice ; add lemon, orange, or rasp- berry juice, and fine sugar, sufficient to sweeten the candy. Boil, and skim, till it becomes a transparent mass. Marmalade may be thus made of any other kind of fruit, and candied. It is a very delicious marmalade. MARMALADE, Orange. Rasp the oranges, cut out the pulp, then boil the rinds very tender, and beat fine in a marble mortar. Boil 3 lbs. of loaf-sugar in a pint of water, skim it, and add a pound of the rind; boil fast till the syrup is very thick, but stir it carefully; then put in a pint of the pulp and juice, the seeds having been removed, and a pint of apple liquor ; boil all gently until well jellied, which it will be in about half an hour. Put it into small pots. Lemon Marmalade can be made in the same way; it is a very good and elegant sweetmeat. MARMALADE, Orange, Transparent. — Weigh the fruit, divide it into quarters, take out the seeds and pips, remove the peek Cut the peel into fine strips, and to every pound of fruit, add 3 pints of cold water, let this mixture stand 24 hours, then boil till the peel is tender, let it remain 24 hours again, lastly to every pound of this mixture, add 1 lb. of hasp augur,

BILLIARDS. The Game of POOL.â€”There are several ways of playing Pool: namely, with as many balls as there are players ; or with two balls only, the players playing in turns, and playing with the alternate balls; playing at the nearest ball ; playing at the last player ; or the player playing at whichever ball he chooses. But the most popular mode is that in which the player plays at the last player. This is likewise the fairest way of playing the game. Rules for playing the game according to the last method : 1 When the coloured balls are used, the players must play progressively, as the colours are placed on the Pool marking-board, the top colour being No. 1. 3 Each player has three lives at starting. No. 1 places his ball on the winning and losing spot; No. 3 plays at No. 1; No. 3 at No. 2; and so on ; each person playing at the last ball; unless it should be in hand, then the player plays at the nearest ball. 3 If the striker should lose a life in any way, the next player plays at the nearest ball to his own ; but if his (the player's) ball be in hand, he plays at the nearest ball to the centre of the baulk line, whether in or out of baulk. 4 Should a doubt arise respecting the

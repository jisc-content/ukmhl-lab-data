34 ATR AST ASTRINGENTS.—Medicines which contract the living fibre. Their more immediate effect is to diminish excretion and secretion, acting subsequently as a tonic; they are remedies for debility, inward or external haemorrhage, injurious secretions from the glands, fluxes, &c.

ATROPHY.-The word is derived from the Greek a, not, and tropke, nourishment; not nourishment, and the want of that nourishment induces ema- ciation, and loss of strength.

I have seen the ves- sels so attenuated as to be scarcely able to contain the blood, and in some cases, the smaller ones congested. The cause may be hereditary, damp houses, rooms, and beds, unwholesome foul air, close and bad ventilated sleep- ing rooms, excessive evacuations, worms, mental anxiety, excessive indulgence in venery, or spirituous liquors. It is in- duced in females by suckling their chil- dren too long. Treatment.—Many diseases are accompanied by Atrophy to a greater or less extent. In those cases, therefore, it is but an effect of a disease, and that disease must be prescribed for. There are cases, however, in which the most careful and repeated scrutiny fails to detect any serious disease of the vital organs, though some important viscus may be affected. If the glands are affected, apply the Tincture of Iodine by means of a Camel Hair brush, or the Ointment of the same. The following formula has been recommended :— Iodine of Potassium, x lira cbm; Coro-

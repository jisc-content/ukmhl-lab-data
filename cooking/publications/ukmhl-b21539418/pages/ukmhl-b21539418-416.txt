When dry, the ceiling is ready for whitewash, which is to be made by mixing whiting and water together till quite smooth, as thick as cream. Dissolve half an ounce of glue in a teacupful of water, and stir it into the whitewash. This sine, as it is called, prevents the white or colour rubbing off the wall, and a teacupful is enough for a gallon of wash. Stone colour is made by mixing a Uttle yellow ochre and blue black with the size, and then stirring it into the whitewash ; yellow or red ochre ore also good colours, and with vermil- llon or Indigo, any shade may be pro, pared, according to taste. If paper is to be used, the wall must; be washed with clean water as before explained, and while wet, the old colour must be scraped off with a knife, or a smooth-edged steel scraper of any sort. It will be best to wet a yard or two at a time, and then scrape. Next wash the wall all over with size, made with half pound of pale glue to a gallon of water; and when this is dry the wall is ready for the paper. This must be cut into- lengths according to the different parts of the room. On one edge the plain strip must be cut off close to the pattern, and the other left with a narrow edge on. If the paper is thick, it should lie a minute ortwo after it is pasted, but if thin, the sooner it is on the wall the better. Begin by placing the close cut edge of the paper at one side of the window, stick it securely to meet the ceiling, let it hang straight, and then press it down lightly and regularly with a clean cloth, or flat whitening brush. The dose cut edge of the next length will cover the narrow edge left on the first one, and so make a neat joining; and in this way you may go all round the room and finish at the other side of the window.

Then take them out, and for every gallon of liquor, put two heads of garlic, *4 lb. of anchovies, a quart of port wine, and 1 oz. each of mace, cloves, long, black, and Jamaica pepper, and ginger. Boil altogether till the liquor is reduced to half. Bottle for use. It is good in fish sauce, or stewed beef. The longer it is kept, the better it is. WALNUT KETCHUP, very Fine.—Boil a gallon of the expressed juice of green tender walnuts, and skim it well; then put in 3 lbs. of anchovies, bones and liquor, 2 lbs. shalots, 1 oz. each of cloves, mace, pepper, and one clove of garlic. Let all simmer till the shalots sink; then put the liquor into a pan till cold ; bottle and divide the spice to each. Cork closely, and tie a bladder over. It will keep twenty years, but is not Rood the first. . Be very careful to

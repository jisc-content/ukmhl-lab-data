The addition of a small quantity of Aloes will render it more effectual. ASPARAGUS, Officinalis.— Asparagus is one of the most wholesome and nutritious of our culinary vege- tables ; it is both a diuretic and a seda- tive, and is recommended in cases of dropsy, stone, and affections of the chest and lungs. For the latter com- plaint the following extract will be found serviceable :—Boil the asparagus in water for several hours, then strain, and evaporate the liquor gradually over a very slow fire until it becomes exceed- ingly 'hick ; then add ft wineglassfpl «f brandy to each pint, and put by in bottles. Take a tablespoonful night and morning in warm milk. ASPARAGUS, to boil.—Scrape the asparagus; tie them in small bunches; boil them in a large pan of water with salt in it; before you dish them up toast some slices of bread, and then dip them in the boiling water ; lay the asparagus on the toasts ; pour on them rich melted butter, and serve hot. ASPARAGUS, ragout of.— Cut small asparagus like green peas; the best method is to break them off first ; then tie them in small bunches to cut, boil them till half done; then drain them, and finish with butter, a little broth, herbs, two cloves, and a sprig of savory. When done take out the cloves, herbs, &c., mix two yolks of eggs, with a little flour, and broth, to garnish a first course dish. But if you intend to serve it in second course mix cream, a little salt, and sugar. ASPARAGUS AMULET.— Beat up six eggs with cream, boil some of the largest and finest asparagus, and when boiled cut off all the green in small pieces. Mix them with the eggs, and add pepper and salt. Heat a slice of butter, and put them in, and serve on buttered toast, ASPARAGUS OMELET,—

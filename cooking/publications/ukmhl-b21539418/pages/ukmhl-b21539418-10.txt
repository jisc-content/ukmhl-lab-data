6 PREFACE. t “ I shall be pleased it you, once my strong and healthy Leader, will, in treading the down-hill of life, sometimes “CONSULT ME.” 1 have made a few corrections and many additions. L now advise that this accumulation of good and well-tried experiences, having passed the careful examination of a recog- nised authority upon the various parts of household economy, health, morals, luxury, moderation and success, should be made a “CONSULT ME” Text Book, recommended by the Author of “ Enquire Within.” There are many very ex- cellent hints upon Simplicity of Living, the avoidance of un- necessary stimulants and condiments, and excesses of many kinds. Accept, therefore, with conscientious regard for the truth, and its sustaining influences upon, the welfare of mankind, a strong recommendation of “CONSULT ME,” by The Author of “ENQUIRE WITHIN.” The Publishers of “ CONSULT ME” have to thank a generous public for the enormous patronage bestowed upon it sinte its first issue many years ago; they have in consequence been induced to publish a NEW EDITION with many Improvements and Additions} which they believe will cause it to be still further appreciated.—January, 1902.

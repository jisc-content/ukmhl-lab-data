The object of the turpentine is to prevent pressure, or pinching caused by evaporation of the ether when applied to a bruised surface. Water does not affect it, hence its value for cracked nipples, chapped hands, and surface bruises, &c, ASAFCETIDA, Tincture of.- This strong solution of asafoetida gun. in proof spirit, in the quantity of thirty to fifty drops, in a glass of pennyroyal or peppermint water, is much and suc- cessfully employed as a remedy for low- ness of spirits, hysteric and fainting fits ; different nervous complaints, spas- modic colic and asthma. The addition of ten drops of sal volatile to each dose will render it more pleasant to the palate, and at the same time coincide with its virtues. A mixture of one-third of tincture of asafoetida, and two of paregoric elixir, taken in the dose of a teaspoonful, has been found particularly serviceable in relieving asthma in languid constitu- tions, and chronic difficulty of breath- ing, by expelling air from the stomach, promoting expectoration, and allaying irritation, (see Asthma.) In the hoop ing-cough, unattended with fever, it will prove equally beneficial, in doses proportioned to the nge of the patient, viz. to a child of two years old, six drops, Increasing two drops for every year.

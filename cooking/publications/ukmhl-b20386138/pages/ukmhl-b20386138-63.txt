( 5i ) CURRIES AND INDIAN DISHES. AS TAUGHT BY A NATIVE COOK IN THE COLONIAL AND INDIAN EXHIBITION, 1886. GENERAL REMARKS ON CURRIES. 1. The quantity of butter depends a great deal on the fatness of the meat curried. 2. The onions should be of a moderate size. If small, more must be used than specified in the recipes; if large, less. 3. The quantity of fluid must depend greatly on the length of time the meat has to be cooked. The cook must use a little judgment in this matter. Curry Powder. Ingredients. One pound and a half of Papaver Somniferum. Two pounds of Turmeric (Powder). Two ounces of YeUow Mustard Seed.

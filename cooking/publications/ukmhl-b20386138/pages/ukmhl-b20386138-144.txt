Butter a stewpan with two ounces of butter, and arrange the arti- chokes in circles in it, sprinkle over a little pepper, salt, nutmeg, and lemon-juice; pour one gill of consomme to them, put the lid on, and simmer gently for half an hour, basting them occasion- ally ; they should colour a deep yellow. Just before serving, roll them in the consomme. Serve with Italian sauce round them. Brussels Sprouts. Ingredients. Two pounds of Brussels Sprouts. Two ounces of Butter. Salt and Pepper.

HIGH-CLASS COOKERY. 66 First make the stuffing. Cut up the bacon and cook it, then add the liver cut up, the carrot, herbs, onion, salt, pepper and nutmeg. When well cooked pound all in a mortar and rub through a wire sieve. This liver farce is now ready for use. Draw and clean the birds, take out the breast-bone and the back-bone but leave the legs. Stuff each bird with the liver farce, tie each one up in a piece of muslin, lay them in a stewpan, cover them over with their bones, chopped vegetables, bay-leaf, thyme, half a pint of stock, and one gill of sherry. Let them cook steadily for half an hour, then take them out of the stewpan and press them lightly between two dishes. Strain the stock the birds were cooked in and reduce it to a glaze, take the muslin off the birds and baste each one several times with this glaze to coat them well. When cold, dish up the birds on chopped aspic jelly with small salad in the centre. Chicken Casuala, Ingredients, One Chicken. Two ounces of Butter. One Onion. One Egg.

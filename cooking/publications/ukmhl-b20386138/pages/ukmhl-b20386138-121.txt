( 109 ) SAUCES. Bearnaise Sauce. Ingredients, Four Shalots. Half a gill of Tarragon Vinegar. Half a gill of Vinegar. One gill of White Sance. Yolks of three Eggs. Three ounces of Butter. Chop up the shalots and put them into a stew- pan with the vinegar, and boil till reduced to a tablespoonful; then add the white sauce, mixing it well; add one at a time the three yolks of egg, whisking each one well in before adding another, and on no account let it toil. When the eggs are in, remove the stewpan from the fire and whisk in the butter in small pieces, taking care that each piece is dissolved before adding the next, as, if the butter is added too quickly, the sauce will oil. Strain it, and it is ready for use.

PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION. The extra Vork entailed upon me for the last twelve months in consequence of moving this School from its old and inadequate quarters in the Exhibition Eoad, South Kensington, to these large premises, built expressly to meet all our requirements, have made it impossible for me to write the new recipes in time for this Edition of my book. I have therefore put them all into a separate book, which I hope my readers will not find inconvenient. Visitors to the old School will be pleased to find us settled in this large building, the handsome kitchens of which are now full to overflowing. Here we can also take some of our pupils to board and lodge, and can promise them very comfortable quarters at reason- able terms. The first floor consists of our sitting rooms, the second floor of ladies' bedrooms and bathrooms, and the third floor of bedrooms for cooks taking lessons. The secretary's room, the restaurant, and six kitchens and sculleries are all on the ground floor, while the basement contains cellars, larders, store rooms, and servants' hall

ENTREES. 91 Cut up a cold fowl into small joints, and steep them for fifteen minutes in a basin with oil, vinegar, pepper, and salt. Then drain them quite dry on a cloth, mask them all over very smoothly with some white mayonnaise sauce stiffened with a little aspic jelly. Dish up these pieces of fowl on a thick bed of well-seasoned salad, shred finely in a pyramid form. Garnish the base with chopped aspic jelly, neatly cut cucumber, and the top with sprigs of tarragon and chervil. Minced Veal. Ingredients, One pound Minced Veal. One tablespoonful of Mushroom Ketchup. The grated peel of half a Lemon. One teaspoonful of Cayenne Sauce. One blade of Mace. Half pint of Stock. Two dozen of Oysters, Sippets of Toast. Mince the veal and make it hot in the stock with the ketchup, cayenne sauce, lemon peel, and mace. When thoroughly hot, take out the mace; scald the oysters in their own liquor, taking off the beards; put the mince on a hot dish, the oysters in the centre and the sippets of toast round.

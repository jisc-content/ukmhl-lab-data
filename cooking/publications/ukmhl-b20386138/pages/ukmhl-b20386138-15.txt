3 SOUPS. Consomme a la Rachel. Ingredients, Clear consomme, to which is added some very small quenelles made in teaspoons. One part coloured with pounded Tarragon. One part coloured with Lobster Coral. One part coloured with Truffles pounded. These quenelles must be all mixed separately, poached separately, and kept in cold water until the soup is ready. Put them into the tureen and pour the boiling consomme on them. Consomme a la Royale. Ingredients, Three pints of Consomme, Custard to serve in the Consomme. Ingredients. Three Yolks of Eggs, One White of Egg. One gill of Stock. A little Salt.

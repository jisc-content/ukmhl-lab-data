NOTE. To insure good frying, the heat of the fat should bo tested by a fryometer; the right heat for Whitebait is not less than 400째, for Fish from 360째 to 375째, and for Meat from 375째 to 380^. If oil is used it must be much hotter than either fat or lajd. The fryometers and oven thermometers used in the School have the correct heats for various cookings marked on the scale, and a^ " made by Messrs. Joseph Davies & Co., Fitzroy Works, S.E.

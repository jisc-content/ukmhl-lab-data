Quarter of a pound of fat Bncon. A Pig's Caul. One small Carrot. Oue small Onion. Parsley, Bay-leaf, Thyme, all tied together. One Shalot. One Clove of Garlic. Twelve Peppercorns.

Dish in a circle on spinach or mashed potatoes; pour a little half- glaze round, some macedoine in the centre, and serve.

HiaH-CLASS COOKERY. 108 cut either small cases, or one ordinary-sized vol-au- vent case, and bake till a nice brown in an oven not too hot; when baked remove the centre. Put in a stewpan— Half a pint of Supreme Sauce. Half a cold Chicken or Sweetbreads, cut in neat pieces. Two ounces of Tongue. Three Truffles, sliced. Six Mushrooms „ Four CJockscombs. A few quenelles of Veal or Chicken. Stir this over the fire until hot, but not boiling; fill in your vol-au-vent, w^hich should only be done on sending it to table, as it makes the paste damp, and does not appear so satisfactory when filled long before serving.

HiaH-OLASS COOKERY. 172 Put two ounces of loaf sugar and a half gill of cold water into a stewpan, and boil quickly, until coffee colour, stir well and pour it quickly into a thoroughly dry, plain soufiflee mould, and let it coat the mould all over. Make a custard of the four yolks, one white of egg, the castor sugar and the milk, thus: break the eggs into a basin, add the sugar, boil the milk, and when a little cool pour it on to the eggs and sugar, then strain it into the mould you have lined with caramel; steam it very slowly for half an hour. Turn it out on to a dish, and some of the caramel will run off and form a sauce. Cocoanut Pudding. Ingredients, Half a pint of Milk. Half a pound of grated Cocoanut. Two tablespoonfuls of Cake-crumbs. Two tablespoonfuls of Castor Sugar. Two ounces of Butter. Half a pint of Cream. Six Eggs. Two teaspoonfuls of Vanilla. Cook the cocoanut in the milk; cream the butter and sugar together, beat up the yolks of egg, and add to the butter and sugar. When the milk is off the boil, stir the eggs, cream, butter, and sugar, the cake-crumbs and vanilla, to it; also add three whites of egg whipped to a stiff froth. Put this into a pie-dish, and bake for half an hour.

HIGH-CLASS COOKERY. 56 White Curry (Chicken): Ingredients. <Dne Fowl. One Onion. Two ounces of Butter. Two tablespoonfuls of Curry Powder. Two ounces of Sweet Almonds. Half a saltspoonful of Salt. The Juice of half a Lemon. Half a pint of Water. Melt the butter in a saucepan, put in the onion sliced and stir over the fire, but do not brown. Then add the fowl cut into rather small pieces, and cook all together for a few minutes. The curry powder should then be sprinkled over the fowl and the contents of the saucepan stirred carefully over the fire for five minutes. Blanch the almonds and pound them with a little water. When they are quite fine put them in a strainer and pour over them the rest of the water, which should come from the almonds looking like milk. Add this almond milk and the salt to the curry, and cook slowly for about half an hour according to the age of the fowl. Add the lemon- juice a few minutes before serving. (Veal may be cooked by this recipe.) Grated cocoa-nut mny be used instead of almonds.

11 SOUPS. Ten Peppercorns. Two quarts of Second Stock. Half a pint of Madeira. Thirty drops of Lemon Juice. A few grains of Cayenne Pepper. Two ounces of Flour. Two ounces of Butter. Salt. Clean the giblets carefully and put them in a stewpan of boiling water to blanch for five minutes. Then put them into cold water, wash and scrape them, and then cut them into pieces about an inch and a half in length. Put the pieces of giblets, the stock, and the vegetables (all cleaned and cut up small) into a stewpan, add the bouquet, cloves and peppercorns, and let the whole boil for two hours, skimming occasionally. Then take out the best pieces of giblets, trim them neatly, but let the stock and remainder of giblets boil half an hour longer. Now melt the butter in a stewpan, put in the flour, and fry for a few minutes ; add the stock strained, the Madeira, lemon-juice, cayenne and the trimmed pieces of giblets, and let the whole boil twenty minutes. Potage a TAmericaine. To one quart of clear consomme add, when boiling, two tablespoonfuls of prepared tapioca; let it boil ten minutes, then add half a pint of puree of tomato, a little salt, and a little sugar. This soup is better made with fresh tomatoes.

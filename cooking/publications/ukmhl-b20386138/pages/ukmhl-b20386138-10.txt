Vi PKEFACE TO THE THIED EDITION". March, 1890. The situation mil be found most convenient, in the Buckingham Palace Eoad, close to Victoria Station, and nearly opposite the Grosvenor Hotel, so that Ave are in easy reach by omnibus and train of all parts of London and the suburbs. Ladies shopping in the Buckingham Palace Eoad will find our restaurant a convenient place for luncheons and afternoon tea; the room is large and airy, and the tables well appointed. The dishes are made of the best materials, well cooked, well served, and the tariff is moderate. The uncheons are a la carte, and next month we hope to serve dinners at a set price in the evenings from 6 to 8 o'clock. Edith Clauke, Lady Superintendent,

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION. This Edition contains a good many fresh recipes of all kinds, and the old ones have been thoroughly- revised. Indian Curries form a new feature, the recipes for which I collected last summer in the Colonial and Indian Exhibition, from a native of Madras. I give also the recipe for making the Curry Powder, which we prepared fresh every morning in the Exhibition; it is a good deal of trouble, but the result is well worth it. Among these Indian dishes will be found one about the name of which I feel very doubtful; our native called it " MoUet" and spelt it so; this conveys nothing to my mind, and I have failed for so far to discover among my old Indian friends any particular meaning for it, so it must go forth on the authority of the native; I have added a sort of explanation and called it an " Indian Breakfast Dish."

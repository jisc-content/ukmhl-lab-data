One gill of Malt Vinegar. One gill of Tarragon Vinegar. Half a gill of Chili Vinegar. Half a gill of Lemon-juice. One Carrot, one Turnip, one Onion. One stick of Celery. A teaspoonful of Salt. A sprig of Tarragon, Chervil and Parsley. The rind of two Lemons. Twenty White Peppercorns. Ten ounces of French Gelatine. Three Whites of Egg whipped and the shells crushed. Ingredients for the Pupils in the Demonstration Kitchen. {One Quart.) One and a half pints of Water. Quarter of a pint of Sherry. Quarter of a pint of these Vinegars mixed: Tarragan, Malt, and Chili. Juice of two Lemons. One Carrot, one Turnip, one Onion. One stick of Celery. Half a teaspoonful of Salt. A small bunch of Tarragon. Chervil and Parsley. The rind of one Lemon. Two ounces and a half of French Gelatine. The Whites and Shells of two Eggs. Ten White Peppercorns. Put all these ingredients into a stewpan to- gether, and whisk over the fire until it boils ; then draw it to the side of the fire for a few minutes, strain it as usual through a clean cloth, scalded and put on a soup stand, and when it is set it is ready for use.* * For all these jellies I have given the Ingredients in two quantities, as the different kitchens require in the School, because the pupils seem to find so much trouble in reducing the quantities in proper proportions. This will, I hope, save trouble to our pupils and to my staff of teachers, and it will not interfere with the general public who use the book.

70 - HiaH-OLASS COOKERY. Cutlets Chaudfroid a la Russe. Ingredients, Best end of a neck of Mutton. One pint of Aspic Jelly. Half a pint of good Glaze. Macedoine of Vegetables, consisting of Carrot, Potato, Cauliflower, Peas, Green Haricots, French Beans, Beetroot, Cucumber, all of which must be neatly- cut in equal sizes, and carefully boiled in separate water, washed in cold water after, ^'to preserve the colour." Half a pint of thick Mayonnaise Sauce. Pepper and Salt. The cutlets must first be cut, a bone to each cutlet, and not very much trimmed, then braized for an hour (in the oven is best) till the meat is quite tender; take them out and press them until cold, when each cutlet should be very neatly trimmed, and dipped in the glaze until they have a smooth glace appearance. Next chop the aspic, cutting from it first a few croutons to arrange round the cutlets. Put the chopped aspic on the dish, arrange the cutlets, and fill in the centre with the macedoine, which should previously be well stirred into the Mayonnaise sauce, leaving the beetroot to add at the last, as it discolours the other vegetables. This entree can be varied or ornamented, according to taste, with cut cu- cumber, small frills, etc.

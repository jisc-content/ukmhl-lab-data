384 the EXF*ERIENCEi^ work both plain and eafy. As to French cooks' and old experienced houfe-keepers, they have no occafion for my affiftance, it is not from them I look for any applaufe. I have not engraved a copper-plate for a third courfe, or a cold colla- tion, for that generally confifts of things extra- vagant } but I have endeavoured to fet out a delfert of fweetmeats, which the induftrious houfe-keeper may lay up in fummer at a fmall cX:pence, and when added to what little fruit is then in feafon, will make a pretty appearance after the cloth is drawn, and be entertaining to the company. Before you draw your cloth, have all your fweetmeats and fruit diflied up in china difhes or fruit bafkcts; and as many dilhes as you have in one courfe, fo many balkets or plates your delfert mufthave; and as my bill of fare is twenty-five in each courfe, fo mufl: your defi'ert be of the fame number, and fet out in the fame manner, and as ice is very often plen- tiful at that time, it will be eafy to make five different ices for the middle, either to be ferved upon a frame or without, with four plates of dried fruit round themj apricots, green gages, grapes, and pears—the four outward corners, pillacho nuts, prunelloes, oranges, and olives—■ the four fquares, nonpareils, pears, walnuts, and filberts—the two in the centre, betwixt the top and bottom, chefnuts and Portugal plums— for fix long dilhes, pineapples, French plums, and the four brandy fruits, which are peaches, nectarines, apricots, and cherries.

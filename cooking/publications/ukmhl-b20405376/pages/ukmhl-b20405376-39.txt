COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. 19 gently for four hours. Finish in the same manner as mutton broth. The French-prepared flours, Fayeux's Fecule de Pomme de terre, and Fleur de riz, are very light and delicate, and to be preferred to all preparations of corn-flour for thickening broth, &c, for invalids. Chicken Broth. Fine young, but not fat, birds are required for this purpose. This broth may be made in an economical manner by boiling the chicken just sufficiently for eating, and then, either having sent the bird to table, or cut off the white meat and put it aside to make a little dish, returning the bones with one or both of the legs to the broth, and allowing it to boil two hours with an onion, a few peppercorns, and salt. Or, the white meat may be cut from the breast, merry-thought, and wings before boiling, and used for making quenelles or some other delicate dish, the remainder of the chicken being cut up to make the broth. Boil rather more than two hours, strain, take off all fat, and serve.

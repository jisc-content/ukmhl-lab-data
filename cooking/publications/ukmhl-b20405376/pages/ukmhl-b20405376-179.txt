157 COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. Preserved Strawberries. Boil one pound of sugar in half a pint of water until it begins to get thick, then put in one pound of carefully picked strawberries, and let them boil gently until the fruit is done, which will be in about a quarter of an hour. Pour the preserve into a basin, and let it stand until the next day, then drain the syrup into the preserving kettle, taking care not to break the fruit; let the syrup boil, skimming it, if necessary, until it begins to jelly, then put the strawberries into it, let them boil together gently for five minutes, put into small pots or glasses, and do not cover down for a week or ten days.

44 COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. Lemonade made with rice water when cold is very- nice and refreshing. Toast Water. This useful beverage, like many other simple things, is too frequently very badly made, and has acquired an evil reputation from the crumbs of charcoal-like character, or little sodden morsels of bread, which too often are found floating on the surface. To remedy these defects take care that the crusts from which toast water is to be made, shall be only a nice deep brown, never allowing them to catch fire or blacken in the toasting, and letting them grow quite cold before immersing them in nice, fresh-filtered water. Whenever from any cause there are morsels of bread floating on the water strain it through muslin. The drink should be made an hour before it is wanted, and never be used after standing twelve hours. Serve it in a water bottle of clear glass.

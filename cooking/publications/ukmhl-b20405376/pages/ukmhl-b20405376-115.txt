Pound the meat of the breast of a fowl in a mortar, mix it with the paste, and work together in the mortar until thoroughly incor- porated; work in the yolk of another egg, and set the mixture in a cool place for an hour or two. Salt is to be added according to taste, and, if liked, a pinch of pepper may be used. When ready to cook the quenelles, flour your hands, take a piece of the paste the size of a dessert-spoon, and roll into an egg-shaped ball. When all are ready, drop them one by one into slightly-salted boiling water, and poach them until they rise to the surface; they will take five or six minutes to cook. Serve immediately on a napkin.

One chicken may be made to serve for two ex- cellent meals by dividing it down the middle, using^ each half for boiling, roasting, broiling, stewing, or as a fricassee.

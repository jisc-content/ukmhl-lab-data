94 COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. For Boiling. — Put the half chicken into enough weak stock, well seasoned with salt, and boiling, and after a minute reduce the heat, and keep the chicken gently simmering for half an hour, more or less, according to size. Serve with parsley or white sauce, and, if allowed, garnish with little rolls of toasted bacon. An onion boiled in the stock gives flavour to the chicken, and sweet herbs may also be used. FOR Roasting.—Brush over the half chicken with dissolved butter; put it in the Dutch oven, and baste continually with butter or lard for half an hour; take care it is nicely browned. Or, fasten a thick slice of fat bacon over the breast, and roast the chicken before the fire; five minutes before serving remove the bacon and let the skin get a nice brown. FOR BROILING.—Dip the half chicken in dissolved butter, and place it on a gridiron over a slow fire, the bones being downwards ; let it remain thus for a quarter of an hour, basting the chicken occasion- ally with a little butter tied in muslin. Turn the chicken at the expiration of a quarter of an hour, taking great care it does not stick to the gridiron

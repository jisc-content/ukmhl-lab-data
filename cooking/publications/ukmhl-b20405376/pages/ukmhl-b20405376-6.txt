LITTLE DINNERS. BY MARY HOOPER. Ninth Edition. Price $s. " We ought not to omit the mention of several very good recipes which Mrs 1 Hooper vouchsafes us, e.g., rump-steak pudding, sheep's head Scotch fashion, ' devilled fowl, rich plum pudding, neck of venison cooked in a V oven, how to cook whitebait, and how to ' scollop' oysters. She has good hints about salmi of wild duck, and her caution on the deliberate preparation of the sauce for the 1 same delicacy, roasted, assures us that—given the means and the heart to put her knowledge in practice—she undeniably knows what is good. . . .

COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. carefully washed and trimmed from skin and gristle. Calf's Liver Saute. Put a bit of butter the size of a walnut in a small stewpan ; when dissolved, let a shalot stand in it for five minutes ; take out the shalot and place in the stewpan a slice of fine and perfectly fresh calf's liver, sprinkle it with pepper and salt and chopped parsley. Set the stewpan at a very low heat so that the liver does not even simmer for half an hour, then turn the liver and let it remain cooking gently in its own juices for another half hour. Be careful to keep the heat low, and if necessary stand the stewpan on a trivet, for if the liver simmers it will be hardened and be unfit for an invalid. At the expiration of the hour, put the liver between two hot plates whilst you prepare the gravy. Put a tablespoonful of beef-tea or any broth into the stewpan, stir it up with the gravy from the liver, let it boil for half a minute, pour over the liver, and serve. This little dish is wholesome and digestible, and for those who like liver will be found useful.

BEEF-TEA, BROTH, &c, &c. NEXT in order to gruel in the invalid's bill of fare comes beef-tea, which, though no longer accredited with virtues it does not possess, is undoubtedly a useful, if not very nourishing form of animal diet. Since the introduction of Liebig's extract of meat, beef-tea has been in danger, as our American cousins say, " of being improved off the earth." The baron's preparation may indeed be useful in an emergency, but is so inferior to that of fresh- killed beef, as to make one marvel at the frequency with which it has been ordered. No doubt one reason why the extract has been so largely substi- tuted for fresh-killed beef, has been that doctors have found it difficult to get the tea properly made from the latter, by average cooks, and have there- fore preferred to order Liebig's extract, which at least is free from grease.

COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. U4 pudding, put it with the macaroni into a tart dish, season to taste, and bake gently for an hour and a half. Savoury Bread Pudding. Pour half a pint of beef-tea, boiling, over the crumb of a French roll. Beat well together, and let it soak for half an hour; then add two eggs beaten with a quarter of a pint of boiling milk. Season with pepper and salt, beat together for five minutes, put the pudding into a buttered tart dish, and bake rather quickly for three-quarters of an hour. If there is no objection, an onion, well boiled and beaten to a pulp, may be added to the pudding. Brown Biscuit Pudding. Soak a Blatchley's biscuit in half a pint of milk for an hour, then boil, stirring all the time, until it begins to get thick, sweeten to taste, and flavour with vanilla. Beat up the yolks of two eggs and the white of one. Mix them in the pudding, put it into a buttered basin, and steam for twenty minutes. Serve with vanilla sauce.

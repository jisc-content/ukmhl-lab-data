COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. J 39 Stewed Prunes. Wash the fruit, and for every pound allow half a pound of raw sugar and one pint of water. Boil the sugar and water together for ten minutes, then put in the fruit, and let it boil gently for two hours or until perfectly tender, so that it breaks if touched with the finger. Drain the syrup from the prunes, and boil it until it becomes thick; then put the prunes back into it, and let them stand until the next day.

COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. 91 Lamb's Sweetbreads. Some care is necessary in choosing these, for, if the lamb is not itself young and tender, the sweet- breads will be stringy and unpleasant to eat. Parboil them in exactly the same way as calf's sweetbread; dip them in egg and seasoned bread crumbs, and fry in a little batter until brown. Toasted bacon may be served with the sweetbreads; in this case no gravy will be required. Sheep's Brains. Having carefully washed the brains, boil them very fast for ten minutes, in order to harden them, in good, highly-seasoned gravy. When done, take them up, and allow them to remain until cold; then divide each lobe into slices, and dip them in egg and seasoned bread crumbs. Fry, and serve as directed for sweetbreads.

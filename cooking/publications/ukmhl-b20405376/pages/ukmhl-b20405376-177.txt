COOKER Y FOR INVALIDS. 155- Apple Marmalade. Peel, but do not core, six pounds of sharp apples, pour over them three pints of cold water, put them in the preserving kettle, and boil until they are soft. Rub them through a wire sieve, and to each pint of puree, allow half a pound of fine loaf sugar ; boil together until the marmalade will set, put into pots, and when cold cover down and keep for use when apples are scarce. If the apples become dry- in the first boiling, a little more water may be added. No rule can be given as some apples are much more juicy than others. Apple marmalade is said to contain much nourishment and is very useful for delicate children and invalids. Orange Marmalade. Choose Seville oranges with fine smooth dark skins. Score the peel in quarters down to the fruit, remove it with as much of the white as will come without drawing the juice" of the orange, throw the quarters of peel as you do them into cold water.

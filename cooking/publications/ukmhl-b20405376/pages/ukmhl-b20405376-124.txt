Mash or rub through a wire sieve potatoes steamed very dry, add to them a little salt and sufficient yolk of egg to make the puree into a stiff paste. Put a few bread crumbs on your left hand, take enough of the potato puree to make a small ball, roll it into shape, dip it in egg and crumbs lightly salted,â€”and if you desire to have a nice crust to the croquettes, repeat the process of egg- crumbling. When all the croquettes are ready, put them in a wire basket, which immerse in a stewpan half full of boiling fat. Shake the basket lightly, and as soon as the croquettes assume a golden tinge, put them on paper to absorb all the fat clinging to them, and serve. Care must be taken to have the fat a proper temperature for frying, otherwise the croquettes will be greasy or burst, and be rendered wholly unfit for an invalid's table.

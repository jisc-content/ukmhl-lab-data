COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. Fruit Pudding. Make a crust in the proportion of four ounces of suet to six of flour, a pinch of salt, and water to make a stiff paste, roll it out thin before putting into a buttered basin, then add the fruit mixed with sugar, except in the case of apples, which are some- times hardened by boiling with sugar; put on a lid of paste, and boil the pudding an hour and a half. Care should be taken to roll the crust thin, in order to get as much fruit as possible into the pudding. It is a good plan to stew a little fruit, and serve it with the pudding, as it should be given to children in large proportion to the crust. Layer Pudding. Make a crust as for fruit pudding. Roll it out and line a buttered basin with it, lay at the bottom a layer of jam or treacle, then a thin layer of crust, and so on until the basin is full. Boil an hour and a half.

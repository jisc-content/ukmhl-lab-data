When done, drain away the gravy from the chop, put it in a basin, which set in another containing cold water, in order that the fat may rise quickly. Having carefully removed every particle of grease from the gravy, boil it in a stew- pan, and thicken it with a teaspoonful of flour mixed in cold water, until smooth. Put the gravy into the stewing-pot with the chop, let them simmer gently for ten minutes, and serve. Lamb Cutlets. Procure the first two chops of a neck of lamb, or, if early in the season, one from the loin ; cut the meat from the bone, trim away nearly all the fat, and divide the chop into two slices. Dip the cutlets in egg, then crumb them and fry gently in butter until brown. Serve with a little beef gravy thickened and slightly flavoured with lemon juice.

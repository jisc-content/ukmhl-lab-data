COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. 122 four minutes or until tender, drain away the water, and put the pastine to a liquid custard, made of one egg, half a pint of boiling milk, sugar, and flavour- ing to taste. Butter a tart dish, put in the pudding, and bake gently for three-quarters of an hour. Rusk Pudding. â€¢ Butter a tart dish, lay in it two slices of rusk made from tea-cake. Beat up an egg, pour on to it half a pint of boiling milk sweetened to taste with lump sugar and flavoured with lemon or vanilla; put this custard to the rusk, and bake the pudding very slowly for about an hour. Turn it on to a dish and spread over the top a little apricot or strawberry preserve, made hot by placing the jar for a few minutes in a saucepan of boiling water. This pudding is much nicer and lighter than one made of bread. It may be varied by spreading a little lemon cheesecake paste between the rusk, or by pouring over it, when ready to serve, a sauce made as for lemon souffle.

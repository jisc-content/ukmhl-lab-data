61 COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. providing some little variety for the invalid's menu. Boiled Sole. Nothing is easier than to convert this dish, ordinarily most insipid, into one that may tempt the most fastidious taste, and as it is ordered frequently for invalids, it is important it should be properly cooked. An hour before cooking the un- skinned sole, sprinkle salt lightly over it, and lay it in a dish with half a teacupful of vinegar. Put the fish and the vinegar into enough hot white stock well seasoned,—or, if you have none, water in which an onion with a little salt and half a dozen pepper- corns have been boiled—to cover the sole, and let it stand ten minutes in this liquor, getting gradually hotter. At the last let it simmer for five minutes, or rather longer, if the fish is thick. Take it up, drain and serve plain, or with parsley sauce. Fillets of sole may be cooked in the same manner, and brill also is very good, longer time being allowed according to the size of the fish.

112 COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. The custard from whites of eggs is excellent, and only to be distinguished from that made with the yolks added by its pale colour. Fried bread will be found not only an economi- cal, but a nourishing and delicious accompaniment to stewed fruits, and there are very few children who will not eat it. By fried bread is not meant either bread sodden in grease in the frying pan, or bread unduly hardened in boiling fat, because in either case it is most unwholesome. Bread properly fried will be just crisp, and a golden brown on the out- side, and not the least hard. If the fat is a proper temperature, bread, to be properly fried, will not require to be immersed in it for more than half a minute. Great care should be taken in flavouring puddings for children. Bought essences, as a rule, are objectionable, whilst flavourings may be easily and cheaply made at home by infusing lemon peel, almonds, or vanilla in spirit. A small quantity of either of these gives an agreeable flavour, and will be found harmless. The lemon peel and almonds,, when the liquor is poured off, will retain some flavour, and will be useful for several culinary purposes.

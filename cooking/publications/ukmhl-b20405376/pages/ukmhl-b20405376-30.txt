COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. IO many good housewives make arrangements to have it sent to them direct from the North. When oatmeal leaves an acrid taste in the mouth it is a sign that it is adulterated or inferior. In all cases oatmeal must be thoroughly boiled, and though so simple, there is no dish requiring more care and attention in its preparation than porridge. Boil a pint of water, drop in with one hand, by degrees, stirring with a wooden spoon in the other, one ounce of oatmeal and half a teaspoonful of salt, let the porridge boil for half an hour, after all the meal is stirred in, stirring it occasionally to prevent sticking to the saucepan. When done, pour it out and serve with milk or cream. Those who like it may be allowed sugar or golden syrup. It is now conceded by most doctors that sugar in any reasonable quantity/is S-ood for children and that the craving for it is dictated by natural laws. Porridge is made lighter by longer boiling, and for dyspeptic people it is best boiled an hour, add- ing a little boiling water should it threaten to thicken.

COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. 42 Black Currant Jam Water. Put two tablespoonfuls of the jam, with a pint of water, into a perfectly bright tin saucepan, and allow them to simmer for half an hour; strain itr and if for a cold take it as hot as possible. When required to allay thirst, the drink will be given cold. In cases of sore throat a tablespoonful more jam will be used. This method of making jam water is better and more economical than merely pouring boiling water on the jam. Apple Water. Wash three or four fine sharp apples, and bake them slowly until done; then break them up, put into a jug with a quart of water, stir up briskly with a silver spoon, and allow it to stand an hour or two. Strain through a fine sieve, and sweeten to taste. Lemon flavouring may be added.

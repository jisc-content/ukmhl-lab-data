COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. 29 coarse part of the meal goes into the soup. Boil the soup for ten minutes, season, and serve. Haricot Soup. Pour boiling water over a quarter of a pint of large white Haricot beans, let them stand covered over for five minutes, then remove the skins in the same way as you blanch almonds. It is better to remove the skin before cooking as it is indigestible, and the beans take much longer to cook unskinned. Put the beans to boil in a quart of water, with about two ounces of pickled pork or fat bacon, and two onions, when the beans are tender, they will probably take three hours, and water must be added from time to time to prevent them sticking to the stewpan, rub them through a sieve, add enough broth or water to make the soup a proper thick- ness, season and add to it the meat cooked with the soup very finely minced, let all boil together, and serve.

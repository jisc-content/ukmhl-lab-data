45 COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. Egg Drinks. These are most useful, and may be made in almost endless variety. Beaten up with milk or cream, with wine or brandy, in tea and coffee, as a substitute for milk, eggs are equally useful. For tea or coffee beat up the yolk of an egg with a little sifted sugar, and a spoonful or two of milk or cream. Pour the tea from the pot on to it, stirring with one hand, and pouring in the liquid with the other. Proceed in the same manner for hot wine or spirit drink. For any cold beverage the white of the egg can be beaten up with the yolk, a little sugar added, and the liquid gradually mixed with the egg. On account of the difficulty of mixing the white of an egg with hot drinks it is often omitted, but it should be used, whenever possible, as the albumen is very valuable. Curdling will be prevented if the yolk and white are beaten together for five minutes, and care must be taken to have the liquid several degrees below boiling point, when adding it to the egg.

INTRODUCTORY PREFACE. Mere parsimony is not economy. Expense, and great expense, may be an essential article in true economy. Economy is a distributive virtue, and consists, not in saving, but selection. Parsimony requires no providence, no sagacity, no powers of combina- tion, no comparison, no judgment. Mere instinct, and that not an instinct of the noblest kind, may produce this false economy in perfection.—Edmund Burke. Hospitality is enjoined by the precepts of Holy Writ, and is carried ont by the most civilised and the most savage nations of the earth. What can be more simple and beautiful than the African mother’s reception of Park ?— “ The winds roared, and the rain fell; The poor white man, faint and weary. Came and sat under our tree. Chorus. He has no mother to bring him milk. No wife to grind his com.” In later days, who has not been delighted with the attention of the uncivilised natives to the explorers—Burke, Wills, and King—and the manner in which these wild children of Australia provided the seed of the Nardoo plant for their sustenance ? • A writer of repute (Dugald Stewart) has said, that cookery and the fine arts are analogous. I cannot discover the resemblance; but I do contend that there is affinity between hospitality and cookery, for the former would be .navailable without the aid of the latter. I offer no excuse, therefore, for the publication of this small matter-of-fact work on the cookery of the present day, for it will be found practically useful to persons in every situation in life—to the English housewife, and to her prototype in the Colonies. The following pages will show the British and Colonial mode of ren- dering the various articles that God has been pleased to give us for our use, nutritious and wholesome, as well as palatable to our tastes. It is a truism, well known, that meat properly cooked is more easily digested.

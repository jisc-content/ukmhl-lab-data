DEDICATION". “ Beautiful land ! Farewell! When toil and strife, And all the sighs, and all the sins of life Shall come about me ; when the light of truth Shall scatter the bright mists that dazzled youth, And memory muse in sadness on the past, And mourn for pleasures far too sweet to last! How often shall I long for some green spot, Where, not remembering, and remembered not, With no false verse to deck my living bust, With no fond tear to vex my mouldering dust, This busy brain may find its grassy shrine, And sleep untroubled in a shade like thine ! ” —Extract from “Australasia," a poem, which obtained the Chancellor’s Medal, at the Cam bridge Commencement, 1823, by the late Wintliorp Maclcworlh Praed, of Trinity College.

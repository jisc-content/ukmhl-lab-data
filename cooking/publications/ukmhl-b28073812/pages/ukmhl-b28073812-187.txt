143 ICE. Sabotiere.—’The apparatus for making ices called sabotiere is composed of two prin- cipal parts—a part which is indented towards the top and covered; and the sabotiere or inner vessel, slightly conical, which is inserted in a pail, on which it rests by a projecting border or rim. This vessel is closed at the bottom like a cup, and open at the top to admit the creams to be iced. It is closed at the top by a cover furnished with a handle and a hook, which fastens it to the rim of the vessel. This apparatus works as follows: The freezing mixture is turned into the pail, and the creams to be iced into the inner vessel; its cover is then fastened by the hook, and the vessel is set into the pail among the freezing liquid; then taking the whole by the handle of the sabotiere, an alternate motion of rotation is given to it for about a quarter of an hour, when the cream is sufficiently frozen. The cover is opened from time to time, and the mixture well stirred with a spoon adapted to the purpose. The freezing mixture must be renewed every fifteen or twenty minutes. Ice.—The ice shipped from America to England is obtained from Fresh, Spy, and IVenham ponds, near Boston. The ice is beautifully transparent, and free from air cells, and is usually cut in blocks a foot thick. Nearly 200,000 tons are shipped from Boston, and 20,000 tons for New York. The American consumption is nearly 300,000 tons.—Hunt’s “ Merchants’ Magazine.” The following table is taken from “ Ure’s Dictionary,” consisting of frigorific- mixtures, having the power of generating or creating cold without the aid of ice, sufficient for all useful purposes, in any part of the world, at any season :— Mixtures.

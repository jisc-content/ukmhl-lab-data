XXXIV—DINNER ACCORDING TO COUNT D’ORSAY. Ford, Well, I promise you a dinner.—Mcrnj TFivcs of Windsor. It is said that the Count was without a rival as a connoisseur in the dining art, except Mr. Walker; we therefore insert the menu of a banquet given by Lord Chesterfield on his quitting the office of Master of the Buckhounds, the bill of fare of which was furnished by the Count. The dinner took place at the Clarendon, a few years since, and the party con- sisted of thirty, and the price was six guineas per head. The extract is taken from the “Art of Dining.” Ude tells us that “Cookery in England, when well done, is superior to that of any country in the world; ” but the same remark may be applied to the cuisine anywhere. Count D’Orsay’s bill of fare was in the French language, but, for the general reader, we have given the English version of it as far as possible:— FIRST SERVICE. Soups : Fish : Removes : Extrees: Side Dishes : Spring, Queen, turtle.

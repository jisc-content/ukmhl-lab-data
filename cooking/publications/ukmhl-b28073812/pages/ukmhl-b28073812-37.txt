GLOSSARY In the hands of an expert cook, alimentary substances are made almost to change- their nature, their form, consistence, odour, savour, chemical composition, &c. Every- thing is so modified, that it is impossible for the most requisite sense of taste to recognise the substance which makes up the basis of certain dishes. The greatest utility of the kitchen consists in making the food agreeable to the senses, and render- ing it easy of digestion.—Majendie. We are not altogether an admirer of French, cookery, yet we are bound to give our Continental friends credit for the goodness of some of their dishes, and the unexceptionably savoury qualities of others—so much so, that we have introduced a few into this work ; and as reference is made in extracts from authors to terms which some of our readers may not well understand, we have thought it desirable to add the following explanation :— Alelets.—Small silver skewers.

till INTRODUCTORY PREFACE 1860 and 1862 from £92,000,000 to £82,000,000; while the exports to British possessions only fell off from £43,000,000 to £42,000,000 ; and to the Australian Colonies, the exports had increased from £9,000,000 to £11,000,000. To come still nearer, the exports to New Zealand and New South Wales had increased from £3,000,000 in 1860, to £4,750,000 in 1862.—Sir S. Nortlicote. Debate in the House of Commons on the Panama Route, July 17th, 1863. I do not covet new territories upon the Continent: ships, colonies, and commerce are what I wish to possess.—Napoleon I. to the Austrian officers after the victory at Ulm, 1805. Thiers' “ Consulate and Empire.” I trust, therefore, it may not be inopportune, even in such a work as this, that I may be allowed to apostrophise my country, in the elegant language of Scott— “ Breathes there a man with soul so dead, Who never to himself has said, This is my own—my native land! ” E. A. Bellekive, Tasmania, 1SG4.

CM—SERVANTS. * “ Bear, and forbear,” thus preached the stoic sages, -And in two words include the sense of pages.—Pope. Employers should be mindful that servitude—“ labour—has its rights as well as its duties,” and we would therefore entreat attention to the warn- ing voice of the honoured British Judge, who shortly after inculcating the propriety of sympathy with our domestics, and thus giving effect to the golden rule of “ doing as we would be done by,” was suddenly stricken with death:— “ The crimes,” he said, “ I will not say exclusively, but in the far greater majority of these cases, come from those districts which are the most rich in mineral treasures, where wages are high, and where no temptation of want can for a moment be set up as an excuse or palliation for the crime; on the contrary, I have observed in the experience I have had of the calendar of prisoners tried at these assizes—an experience, many of you are aware, extending far beyond the period of my judicial labours— I have observed that in times of comparative privation crime diminishes, and that when wages are high, and are earned by a less degree of work, there is a strong temptation to spend them in various indulgences ; and that crime is increased almost in proportion to the state of prosperity by which the criminals have been surrounded. This consideration should awaken all our minds, and especially the minds of gentlemen connected with those districts, to see in what direction to search for a remedy for so great an evil. It is untrue to say that the state of education—that is, such education as can be furnished by the Sunday-schools, and other schools in these districts—is below the general average. Then we must search among other causes for the peculiar aspect of crime presented in these cases. I cannot help thinking myself it may be in no small degree attributable to that separation between class and class which is the great curse of British society, and for which we are all, more or less, in our respective spheres, in some degree responsible, and which is more complete in these districts than in agricultural districts, where the resident gentry are enabled to shed around them the blessings resulting from the exercise of benevolence and the influence and example of active kindness. I am afraid we all of us keep too much aloof from those beneath us, and whom we thus encourage to look upon us with suspicion and dislike. Even to our servants we think, perhaps, we fulfil our duty when we perform our contract with them—when we pay them their wages, and treat them with the civility consistent with our habits and feelings—when we curb our temper, and use no violent expressions towards them. But how painful is the thought that there are men and women growing up around us, ministering to our comforts and necessities, continually inmates of our dwellings, with whose affection and nature we are as much unacquainted

WINES. 176 derson, in Ms “ History of Wines,” informs us that a stony or gravelly soil is preferable to all others, that hills are preferred to plains, and that in rainy seasons the produce will be increased, but that the grapes will be poor and insipid. It requires a hilly and dry climate to produce good dry wines; so that ive may anticipate that Australia Proper will become a Avine country, and that the climate of Hew Zealand will be too moist for the purpose. Mr. Boothby, the compiler of the South Australian statistics, states that last year 20,000 gallons were exported, and that, in his opinion, the wine will become a great export. The acreage in vines, was 4,777. Cool the wine, Doris. Pour it into the cup Simple, unmixed with water. Such dilutition Serves only to wash out the spirit of man. Translation from, Diphilus in the G-reclc Anthology, “ Fraser's Magazine.” The following is a table, showing the quantity of alcohol (of the specific gravity of 825-60) by measure contained in 100 parts of the- respective wines, Australian and American excluded :— BRANDE.

The sherry is noAV stronger. The port much the same. The Marsala weaker. The Burgundy and claret have less alcohol in their composition, and the wines of the Rhine about the same strength. The author of the “ Art of Dining ” gives this good advice :—“ The wines which may be deemed indispensable at a complete English dinner —Avhich, consequently it is of paramount importance to have good—are sherry, champagne, port, and claret. The palate is confused and made indiscriminating by a greater number, although anything good of its- hind Avill always be welcome as a variety.” Shakespeare, in “ As You Like It,” says, that “ good wine needs no bush,” as in days of yore vint- ners always hung up a bush in front of their houses, an ivy bush being held sacred to Bacchus.

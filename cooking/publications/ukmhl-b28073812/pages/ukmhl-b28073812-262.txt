XCV.—LIST OF BRITISH FISH. Water Souchy,—This may be prepared from most kinds of fish, but perch, tench, and flounders are best. The principal thing in preparing water souchy is to extract every particle of goodness from one kind of fish to make a rich soup to dress those whose bodies are to be eaten. To do this you must take one-half the weight and quantity of the fish, and boil them in a mash in about a couple of quarts of water and some broken parsley, until the greater portion of the flesh of the fish may be strained with the gravy through a colander, after which add a little parsley, chopped fine, and place the remainder of the fish in the liquor; season with pepper and salt, and let the fish stew until done. Fish souchy is simply a batch of fish divided into two parts, the goodness of one of which, with herbs, is extracted to dress for the table the other moiety. Alick. Atherine. Barbel. Bass.

Ill AD V ERTISKMENTS. BROWN & POLSON’S PATENT CORN FLOUR, GUARANTEED PERFECTLY PURE. 0 To obtain the full and delicate flavour of Brown & Polson’s Corn Flour, it should be boiled from seven to ten minutes. Some of the following Recces are upon each Package :— BAKED PUDDING, CUSTARDS, BLANC- MANGE, ARBOAVROOT, FRUIT PIE, CAKES, TEA-CUP PUDDING, INFANT’S FOOD, CORN-FLOUR, CREAM THICK MILK. Brown & Polson trust that the superior quality of their Corn Flour will still secure that preference which it has hitherto main- tained, and also protect them from the substitution of other kinds which are sometimes urged upon families to obtain extra profit by the sale. Inferior qualities that are supplied at little more than half-price are made to counterfeit Brown & Polson’s in appearance of package.

LONDON: LONGMAN, BROWN, GREEN AND LONGMANS, PATERNOSTER ROW. 1845,/< f V % London: Printed by Stewart and MurrAy, Old Bailey.DEDICATED TO THE YOUNG HOUSEKEEPERS OF ENGLAND.PREFACE. The proper and wholesome preparation of our daily food, though it may hold in the estimation of the world but a very humble place among the useful arts of life, can scarcely be considered an altogether unimportant one, involving so entirely, as it does, both health and comfort. England is, beyond most other countries, rich in the varied and abundant produce of its soil, or of its com- merce^ which in turn supply to it all that the necessi- ties or the luxury of its people can demand ; yet, until within very recent years, its cookery has remained far inferior to that of nations much less advanced in civili- zation ; and foreigners have been called in to furnish to the tables of our aristocracy, and of the wealthier orders of the community, those refinements of the art which were not to be obtained from native talent. Our improvement was for a long time opposed by our own strong and stubborn prejudices against innovation in general, and against the innovations of strangers in particular; but these, of late, have fast given way before the more rational and liberal spirit of the times :PREFACE. Vlll happily for ourselves, we have ceased fo be too bigoted, or too proud to profit by the superior information and ex- perience of others upon any subject of utility. The pre- sent age is one of rapid and universally progressing know- ledge, and nothing which is really calculated to advance either the great or the small interests of society is now re- garded as too homely or too insignificant for notice. The details of domestic economy, in particular, are no longer sneered at as beneath the regard of the educated and accomplished; and the truly refined, intelligent, and high-minded women of England have ceased, in these days of comparative good sense, to consider their atten- tion to such details as inconsistent with their dignity, or injurious to their attractions:—and who can direct their households with the same taste, the same judg- ment, and the same watchful care for the comfort of others as themselves ? Who, indeed, can guard all the interests of home as they can ? And surely a woman does not preside less pleasingly in her own immediate circle, nor do the honours of her table, or of her drawing- room, with less grace and propriety for having given (often from pursuits much more congenial to her) some portion of the day to the examination and control of her domestic affairs; it is rare, too, we should suppose, for a husband to be otherwise than grateful to his wife for the exertion of a surveillance which, if steadily and judiciously maintained, will affect his ex- penditure beyond all that a careless calculator would.PREFACE. IX imagine possible. This, at a period when the struggle for income is so general, and the means of half the families holding a certain rank in the world are so insufficient for the support of their position, is a con- sideration of very deep importance. Few things are more certain to involve persons of narrow fortune in painful difficulties than the ruinous, because constant (though not alwrays*perceptible), extra- vagance which so often exists in every department of a house of which the sole regulation is left to servants, who, more than any other class of people in the world, would appear to be ignorant of the true value of moiiey, and of the means of economizing it. We speak, of course, of the generality. Some amongst them there are, we know, equally trustworthy and conscientious, who protect their employers’ property from abuse more scrupulously even than if it wore their own; but the greater number are reckless enough in their wasteful profusion when uncontrolled by the eye of a superior: an inexperienced housekeeper cannot be too soon aware of this. It sometimes happens, however, that the young mistress of a family has had no opportunity before her marriage of acquiring the knowledge which would enable her to conduct her household concerns as she could desire ; and that, with a high sense of her duties, and an earnest wish to fulfil them to the utmost, she is prevented by her entire ignorance of domestic affairs from accomplishing her object.X PREFACE. In such a case, unless she should chance to possess that rare treasure of common English life, a superior cook,* the economy of her table will not be amongst the lightest of her difficulties; and she may be placed, perhaps, by circumstances, at a distance from every friend who could counsel or assist her. Thrown thus entirely upon her own resources, she will natur- ally and gladly avail herself of the aid to be derived from such books as can really afford to her the inform- ation she requires. Many admirably calculated to do this, in part, are already in possession of the public; but amongst the large number of works on cookery, which we have carefully perused, we have never yet met with one which appeared to us either quite intended for, or entirely suited to the need of the totally inex- perienced ; none, in fact, which contained the first rudi- ments of the art, with directions so practical, clear, and simple, as to be at once understood, and easily fol- lowed, by those who had no previous knowledge of the subject. This deficiency, we have endeavoured in the * It can scarcely be expected'that good cooks should abound amongst us, if we consider how very few receive any training to fit them for their business. Every craft has its apprentices ; but servants are generally left to scramble together as they can, from any source which accident may open to them, a knowledge of their respective duties. We have often thought, that schools in which these duties should he taught them thoroughly, would be of far greater benefit to them than is the half-knowledge of comparatively un-useful matters so frequently bestowed on them by charitable educationists.PREFACE. XI present volume to supply, by such thoroughly explicit and minute instructions as may, we trust, be readily comprehended and carried out by any class of learners; our receipts, moreover, with a few trifling excep- tions which are scrupulously specified, are confined to such as may be perfectly depended on, from having been proved beneath our own roof and under our own personal inspection. We have trusted nothing to others; but having desired sincerely to render the work one of genuine usefulness, we have spared neither cost nor labour to make it so, as the very plan on which it has been written must of itself, we think, evidently prove. It contains some novel features, calculated, we hope, not only to facilitate the labours of the kitchen, but to be of service likewise to those by whom they are directed. The principal of these is the summary appended to the receipts, of the different ingredients which they contain, with the exact proportion of each, and the precise time required to dress the whole. This shows at a glance what articles have to be prepared beforehand, and the hour at which they must be ready; while it affords great facility as well, for an estimate of the expense attending them. The additional space occupied by this closeness of detail, has necessarily prevented the admission of so great a variety of receipts as the book might otherwise have comprised; but a limited number, thus completely ex- plained, may perhaps be more acceptable to the reader than a larger mass of materials vaguely given.PREFACE. Xll Our directions for boning poultry, game, &c., are also, we may venture to say, entirely new, no author that is known to us having hitherto afforded the slightest information on the subject; but while we have done our utmost to simplify and to render intelligible this, and several other processes not generally well understood by ■ordinary cooks, our first and best attention has been bestowed on those articles of food of which the con- sumption is the most general, and which are therefore of the greatest consequence; and on what are usually termed, plain English dishes. With these we have intermingled many foreign ones which we know to be excellent of their kind, and which now so far belong to our national cookery, as to be met with commonly at all refined modem tables. But we find that we have, in every way, so far exceeded the limits assigned to us for our volume, that we feel compelled to take here, our somewhat abrupt leave of the reader; who will, no doubt, discover easily, without our assistance, both any merit and any deficiency which may exist in the work.CONTENTS.

The art of preparing good, wholesome, palatable soups, without great expense, which is so well understood in France, and in other countries where they form part of the daily food of all classes of the people, has hitherto been very much neglected in England; it is one, there- fore, to which we would particularly direct the attention of the cook, who will find, we think, on a careful perusal of the present chapter, that it presents no difficulties which a common degree of care and skill will not easily overcome. Under the article Bouillon, a full explanation is given of the principles of this branch of cookery, which should be studied by every reader who may be desirous to excel in it. The spices and other condiments used to give flavour to soups and gravies should be so nicely proportioned that none predominate nor overpower the rest; and this delicate blending of savours is perhaps the most difficult part of a cook’s task : it is an art, moreover, not easily acquired, except by long experience, unless great atten- tion be combined with some natural refinement of the palate. Onions, eschalots, and garlic are not only offensive to many persons, but so prejudicial sometimes in their effects, especially to invalids, that they should at all times be used in moderation, when no positive orders are received to the contrary. A zealous servant will take all possible pains on her first entrance into a family, to ascertain the particular B[CHAP. I. 2 MODERN COOKERY. tastes of the individuals she serves ; and will be guided entirely by them in the preparation of her dishes, how- ever much they may be opposed to her own ideas, or to her previous practice. Exceeding cleanliness, both in her personal habits and appearance, and in every department of her work, is so essential in a cook, that no degree of skill, nor any other good qualities which she may possess, can ever atone for the want of it. The very idea of a dirty cook is so revolting, that few people will be induced to tolerate the reality; and we would therefore most strongly urge those who are anxious for their own success in life, and desirous to obtain the respect and approbation of their employers, strenuously to strive against any tendency to slovenliness of which they may be conscious, or which may be pointed out to them by others. Modern Copper Stock-Pot. A FEW DIRECTIONS TO THE COOK. In whatever vessel soup is boiled, see that it be per- fectly clean, and let the inside of the cover and the rim be equally so. Wash the meat, and prepare the vegetables with great nicety before they are laid into it; and be careful to keep it always closely shut when it is on the fire. Never, on any account, set the soup by in it, but strain it off at once into a clean pan; andSOUPS. 3 CHAP. I.] fill the stock-pot immediately with water: pursue the same plan with all your stewpans and saucepans directly they are emptied. Skim the soup thoroughly when it first begins to boil, or it can never afterwards be rendered clear; throw in some salt, which will assist to bring the scum to the surface, and when it has all been taken off, add the herbs and vegetables ; for if not long stewed in the soup, their flavour will prevail too strongly. Remem- ber, that the trimmings, and especially the bones of fresh meat, the necks of poultry, the liquor in which a joint has been boiled, and the shank-bones of mutton, are all excellent additions to the stock-pot, and should be carefully reserved for it. Let the soup heat gradually over a moderate fire, and after it has been well skimmed, draw it to the side of the stove and keep it simmering softly, but without ceasing, until it is done; for on this, as will hereafter be shown, its excellence principally depends. Every good cook understands perfectly the difference produced by the fast boiling, or the gentle stewing of soups and gravies, and will adhere strictly to the latter method. Pour boiling water, in small quantities at first, to the meat and vegetables of which the soup is to be made when they have been fried or browned ; but otherwise, add cold water to the meat. A small proportion of sugar, about an ounce to the gallon, will very much improve the flavour of gravy- stock, and of all rich brown soups; it may be added also to some others with advantage ; and for this, direc- tions will be given in the proper places. Two ounces of salt may be allowed for each gallon of soup or broth in which large quantities of vegetables are stewed; but an ounce and a half will be sufficient for such as contain few or none; it is always easy to add more if needful, but oversalting in the first instance is a fault for which there is no remedy but that of increasing the proportions of all the other ingredients, and stewing the whole afresh, which occasions needlessQchap. I. MODERN COOKERY. 4 trouble and expense, even when time will admit of its being done. As no particle of fat should be seen floating on your soups when they are sent to table, it is desirable that the stock should be made the day before it is wanted, that it may become quite cold, when the fat may be entirely cleared off without difficulty. When cayenne pepper is not mixed with rice-flour, or with any other thickening, grind it down with the back of a spoon, and stir a little liquid to it before it is thrown into the stewpan, as it is apt to remain in lumps, and to occasion great irritation of the throat when swallowed so. Serve, not only soups and sauces, but all your dishes as hot as possible. TO THICKEN SOUPS. We prefer, to all other ingredients generally used for this purpose, the finest and whitest rice-flour, which after being passed through a lawn-sieve, should be thoroughly blended with the salt, pounded spices, catsup, or wine, required to finish the flavouring of the soup. Sufficient liquid should be added to it very gradually to render it of the consistency of batter, and it should also be perfectly smooth; to keep it so, it should be moistened sparingly at first, and beaten with the back of a spoon until every lump has disappeared. The soup should boil quickly when the thickening is stirred into it, and be simmered, for ten minutes afterwards. From an ounce and a half to two ounces of rice-flour will thicken sufficiently a quart of soup. Either arrow root, potato starch, the French thicken- ening called roux, that is, butter mixed with flour (browned or otherwise), may be substituted for the rice-flour in the following proportions : Two ounces and a half of arrow 1 root or potato- starch* to four pints and a half of soup; to be mixed * We find the condiment called Tous les Mois, when really genuine, a more delicate and suitable ingredient for this purpose5 CHAP. I.] SOUPS. gradually with a little cold stock or water, stirred into the boiling soup, and simmered a minute. Six ounces of flour with as much butter, will be required to thicken a tureen of soup ; as much as half a pound is sometimes used; these must be added by de- grees and carefully stirred round in the soup till smoothly blended with it, or they will remain in lumps. All the ingredients used for soups should be fresh, and of good quality, particularly Italian pastes of every kind (maccaroni, vermicelli, &c.), as they contract, by long keeping, a peculiarly unpleasant, musty flavour. Onions, freed from the outer skin, dried gradually to a deep brown, in a slow oven, and flattened like Nor- folk biffins, will keep for almost any length of time, and are extremely useful for heightening the colour and flavour of broths and gravies.* * TO FRY BREAD TO SERVE WITH SOUP. Cut some slices a quarter-inch thick, from a stale loaf; pare off the crust, and divide the bread into dice, or cut it with a deep paste-cutter into any other form. For half a pound of bread put two ounces of the best butter into a frying-pan, and when it is quite melted, add the bread; keep it turned, over a gentle fire, until it is equally coloured to a very pale brown, then drain it from the butter, and dry it on a soft cloth, or a sheet of paper placed before a clear fire, upon a dish, or on a sieve reversed. even than arrow root, which it resembles in appearance, and in the effect which it produces : it should be used in about the same proportions and in exactly the same manner. When good it appears to us to be entirely flavourless,. As it is now constantly adver- tised for sale, the reader will be at no loss to obtain it. * The fourth part of one of these dried onions, (des oignons brul6s) of moderate size, is sufficient for a tureen of soup. They are sold very commonly in France, and may be procured, we should suppose, without difficulty in London, at the foreign warehouses.[CHAP. I. 6 MODERN COOKERY. SIPPETS A LA REINE. Having cut the bread as for common sippets, spread it on a dish, and pour over it a few spoonsful of thin cream, or of good milk ; let it soak an hour, then fry it in fresh butter of a delicate brown, drain, and serve the sippets hot. TO MAKE NOUILLES; (An elegant substitute for Vermicelli.) Wet, with the yolks of four eggs, as much fine, dry, and sifted flour as will make them into a firm but very smooth paste. Roll it out as thin as possible, and cut it into bands of about an inch and a quarter in width. Dust them lightly with flour, and place four of them one upon the other. Cut them obliquely in the finest possible strips; separate them with the point of a knife, and spread them on writing paper, so that they may dry a little before they are used. Drop them gradually into the boiling soup, and in ten minutes they will be done. Various other forms maybe given to this paste at will. It may be divided into a sort of riband macca- roni; or stamped with small confectionary cutters into different shapes. VEGETABLE VERMICELLI. ( Vegetables cut very fine for Soups.) Cut the carrots into inch lengths, then pare them round and round in ribbons of equal thickness, till the inside is reached; next cut these ribands into straws, or very small strips; celery is prepared in the same way, and turnips also are first pared into ribands, then sliced into strips: these last require less boiling than the carrots, and attention must be paid to this, for if broken, the whole would have a bad appearance in soup. The safer plan is to boil each vegetable separately, till tolerably tender, in a little pale broth (in water, if this be not at hand), to drain them well, and put them into the soup, which should be clear, only a few minutesCHAP. I.] SOUPS. before it is dished. For cutting them small, in other forms, the proper instruments will be found at the iron- mongers. BOUILLON. {The Common Soup of France; Cheap, and very Whole- some.) This soup, or broth, as we should perhaps designate it in England, is made once or twice in the week, in every family of respectabi- lity in France ; and by the poorer classes as often as their means will enable them to substitute it for the vegetable or maigre soups, on which they are more commonly obliged to subsist. It is served usually on the first day, with slices of untoasted bread soaked it; on the second, it is generally varied with tfr semoulina. The ingredients are, of French Pot-au-Feu; or, Earthen Soup Pot. in vermicelli, rice, course, often otherwise proportioned than as we have given them, and more or less meat is allowed, according to the taste or circumstances of the persons for whom the bouillon is prepared ; but the process of making it is always the same, and is thus described (rather learn- edly) by one of the most skilful cooks in Europe: “ The stock-pot of the French artizan,” says Monsieur Car£me, “ supplies his principal nourishment; and it is thus managed by his wife, who, without the slightest knowledge of chemistry, conducts the process in a truly scientific manner. She first lays the meat into her earthen stock-pot, and pours cold water to it in the proportion of about two quarts to three pounds of the beef ;* she then places it by the side of the fire, where it * This is a large proportion of meat for the family of a French artizan ; a pound to the quart would be nearer the reality; but it is not the refuse-meat which would be purchased by persons of the same rank in England for making broth.[CHAP. I. 8 MODERN COOKERY. slowly becomes hot; and as it does so, the heat enlarges the fibre of the meat, dissolves the gelatinous substances which it contains, allows the albumen (or the muscular part which produces the scum) to disengage itself, and rise to the surface, and the ozmazome (which is the most savoury part of the meat) to be diffused through the broth. Thus, from the simple circumstance of boiling it in the gentlest manner, a relishing and nutri- tious soup will be obtained, and a dish of tender and palatable meat; but if the pot be placed and kept over a quick fire, the albumen will coagulate, harden the meat, prevent the water from penetrating it, and the osmazome from disengaging itself; the result will be a broth without flavour or goodness, and a tough, dry bit of meat.” It must be observed in addition, that as the meat of which the bouillon is made, is almost invariably sent to table, a part of the rump, the mouse-buttock, or the leg-of-mutton piece of beef, should be selected for it; and the simmering should be continued only till this is perfectly tender. When the object is simply to make good, pure-flavoured beef broth, part of the shin, or leg, with a pound or two of the neck, will best answer the purpose. When the bouilli (that is to say, the beef which is boiled in the soup), is to be served, bind it into a good shape, add to it a calf’s foot, if easily procurable, as this much improves the quality of the bouillon, pour cold water to it in the proportion mentioned above, and proceed as Monsieur Careme directs, to heat the soup sloivly by the side of the fire ; remove carefully the head of scum, which wfill gather on the surface, before the boiling commences, and continue the skimming at intervals, for about twenty minutes longer, pouring in once or twice a little cold water. Next, add salt in the proportion of two ounces to the gallon; this will cause a little more scum to rise,—clear it quite off, and throw in three or four turnips, as many carrots, half a head of celery, four or five young leeks, an onion stuck with six or eight cloves, a large half-teaspoonful of pepper-SOUPS. 9 CHAP. I.] corns, and a bunch of savoury herbs. Let the whole stew very softly, without ceasing, from four hours and a half to six hours, according to the quantity : the beef in that time will be extremely tender, but not overdone. It will be excellent eating, if properly managed, and might often, we think, be substituted with great advan- tage for the hard, half-boiled, salted beef so often seen at an English table. It should be served with a couple of cabbages, which have been first boiled in the usual way, then pressed very dry, and stewed for about ten minutes in a little of the broth, and seasoned with pepper and salt. The other vegetables from the bouillon may be laid round it or not, at choice. The soup, if served on the same day, must be strained, w^ell cleared from fat, and sent to table with fried or toasted bread, unless the continental mode of putting slices or crusts of untoasted bread into the tureen, and soaking them for ten minutes in a ladleful or two of the bouillon, be, from custom, pre- ferred. Beef, 8 to 9 lbs.; water, 6 quarts; salt, 3 ozs. (more if needed) ; carrots, 4 to 6 ; turnips, 4 or 5 ; celery, one small head; leeks, 4 to 6; one onion, stuck with 6 cloves; pepper-corns, one small teaspoonful: large bunch of savoury herbs : (calf’s foot if convenient) to simmer five to six hours. Obs. 1.—This broth forms in France the foundation of all richer soups and gravies. Poured on fresh meat, (a portion of which should be veal,) instead of water, it makes at once an excellent consommee, or strong jellied stock. If properly managed, it is very clear and pale; and with an additional weight of beef, and some spoons- ful of glaze, might easily be converted into an amber- coloured gravy-soup, suited to modern taste. Ohs. 2. — It is a common practice abroad to boil poultry, pigeons, and even game in the pot-au-feu, or soup-pot. They should be properly trussed, stewed in the broth just long enough to render them tender, and served immediately, when ready, with a good sauce. A small ham, if well soaked, washed exceedingly10 [CHAP. I. MODERN COOKERY clean, and freed entirely from any rusty, or blackened parts, laid with the beef when the water is first added to it, and boiled from three hours and a half to four hours, in the bouillon, is very superior in flavour to those cooked in water only, and infinitely improves the soup, which cannot, however, so well be eaten until the fol- lowing day, when all the fat can easily be taken from it: it would, of course, require no salt. CLEAR, PALE, GRAVY-SOUP OR STOCK. Rub a deep stewpan or soup-pot with butter, and lay into it three quarters of a pound of ham freed entirely from fat, skin, and rust, four pounds of leg or neck of veal, and the same weight of lean beef all cut into thick slices; set it over a clear and rather brisk fire, until the meat is of a fine amber-colour : it must be often moved, and closely watched, that it may not stick to the pan, nor burn. When it is equally browned, lay the bones upon it, and pour in gradually four quarts of boiling water. Take off the scum carefully as it rises, and throw in a pint of cold water at intervals, to bring it quickly to the surface. When no more appears, add two ounces of salt, two onions, two large carrots, two turnips, one head of celery, a two-ounce faggot of savoury herbs, a dozen cloves, half a teaspoonful of whole white pepper, and two large blades of mace. Let the soup boil gently from five hours and a half, to six hours and a half; then strain it through a very clean, fine cloth, laid in a hair sieve. When it is per- fectly cold, remove every particle of fat from the top; and, in taking out the soup, leave the sediment un- touched ; heat in a clean pan the quantity required for table, add salt to it if needed, and a few drops of chili or of cayenne vinegar. Harvey’s sauce, or very fine mushroom catsup, may be substituted for these. When thus prepared, the soup is ready to serve : it should be accompanied by pale sippets of fried bread, or sippets d la reine. Rice, maccaroni in lengths or rings, vermi- celli, or nouilles, may in turn be used, to vary it; butSOUPS. CHAP. I.] 11 they must always be boiled apart till tender, in broth, or water, and well drained before they are slipped into it. The addition of young vegetables, too, and especially of asparagus, will convert it into an elegant spring* soup; but they, likewise, must be separately cooked. ANOTHER RECEIPT FOR GRAVY-SOUP. Instead of browning the meat in its own juice, put it with the onions and carrots, into a deep stewpan, with a quarter-pint of bouillon; set it over a brisk fire at first, and when the broth is somewhat reduced, let it boil gently until it has taken a fine colour and forms a glaze (or jelly) at the bottom of the stewpan; then pour to it the proper quantity of water, and finish the soup by the preceding receipt.* Obs,—An excellent English brown gravy-soup may be made with beef only. It should be cut from the bones, dredged with flour, seasoned with pepper and salt, and fried a clear brown; then stew^ed for six hours, if the quantity be large, with a pint of water to each pound of meat, and vegetables as above, except onions, of which four moderate-sized ones, also fried, are to be added to every three quarts of the soup, which, after it has been strained, and cleared from fat, may be thick- * * The juices of meat, drawn out with a small portion of liquid, as directed here, may easily be reduced to the consistency in which they form what is called glaze; for particulars of this, see Chap- ter III. The best method, though perhaps not the easiest, of making the clear, amber-coloured stock, is to pour a ladleful or two of pale, but strong beef-broth to the veal, and to boil it briskly until well reduced, thrusting a knife, when this is done, into the meat, to let the juices escape ; then to proceed more slowly and cau- tiously as the liquid approaches the state in which it would burn. It must be allowed to take a fine amber-colour only, and the meat must be turned, and often moved in it. When the desired point is reached, pour in more boiling broth, and let the pan regain off the fire for a few minutes, to detach and melt the glaze; then shake it well round before the boiling is continued. A certain quantity of deeply coloured glaze, made apart, and stirred into strong, clear, pale stock, would produce the desired effect of this, with much less trouble.12 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. I. ened with six ounces of fresh butter, worked up very smoothly with five of flour. In twenty minutes after- wards, a tablespoonful of the best soy, half a pint of sherry, and a little cayenne may be added to the soup, which will then be ready to serve. VERMICELLI SOUP. {Potage au Vermicelle.') Drop very lightly, and by degrees, six ounces of vermicelli, broken rather small, into three quarts of boiling bouillon, or clear gravy soup ; let it simmer half an hour over a gentle fire, and stir it often. This is the common French mode of making vermicelli soup, and we can recommend it as a particularly good one for family use. In England it is customary to soak, or to blanch the vermicelli, then to drain it well, and to stew it for a shorter time in the soup: the quantity, also, must be reduced quite two ounces, to suit modern taste. Bouillon, or gravy-soup, 3 quarts ; vermicelli, 6 ozs. ; 30 minutes. Or, soup, 3 quarts; vermicelli, 4 ozs.; blanched in boiling water 5 minutes; stewed in soup 10 to 15 minutes. SEMOULINA SOUP. {Soape a la Semoule.) Semoulina is used in the same way as the vermi- celli. It should be dropped very lightly and by degrees into the boiling soup, which should be stirred all the time it is being added, and very frequently after- wards ; indeed, it should scarcely be quitted for a moment until it is ready for table. Skim it carefully, and let it simmer from twenty to five and twenty minutes. This, when the semoulina can be procured good and fresh,* is, to our taste, an excellent soup. * We shall indicate to our readers, in another partof the volume, where this and various other ingredients can be obtained, of the best quality.CHAP. I.] 13 SOUPS. Soup, 3 quarts; semoulina, 6 ozs: nearly, or quite 25 minutes. MACCARONI SOUP. Throw four ounces of fine fresh* mellow maccaroni into a pan of fast-boiling water, with about an ounce of fresh butter, and a small onion stuck with three or four cloves.f When it has swelled to its full size, and become tender, drain it well, and slip it into a couple of quarts of clear gravy-soup; let it simmer for a few minutes, when it will be ready for table. Observe, that the maccaroni should be boiled quite tender; but it should by no means be allowed to burst, nor to become pulpy. Serve grated Parmesan cheese with it. Maccaroni, 4 ozs.; butter, 1 oz.; 1 small onion; 5 cloves; three-quarters of an hour or more. In soup, 5 to 10 minutes. Obs.—The maccaroni for soups should always be either broken into short lengths before it is boiled, or sliced quickly afterwards into small rings not more than the sixth of an inch thick, unless the cut maccaroni, which may be purchased at the Italian warehouses, be used ; this requires but ten minutes’ boiling, and should be dropped into the soup in the same way as vermicelli. Four ounces of it will be sufficient for two quarts of stock. It may be added to white soup after having been previously boiled in water or veal-broth, and well drained from it. POTAGE AUX NOUILLES, OR TAILLERINE SOUP. Make into nouille paste the yolks of four fresh eggs, and when ready cut, drop it gradually into five pints of boiling soup; keep this gently stirred for ten minutes, skim it well, and serve it quickly. This is a less common, and a more delicately flavoured soup than the vermicelli, provided always that the nouilles be made * We must here repeat our warning against the use of long-kept maccaroni, vermicelli, or semoulina ; as when stale, they will render any dish into which they are introduced, quite unfit for table, t For White Soups omit the onion.14 [CHAP. I. MODERN COOKERY. with really fresh eggs. The same paste may be cut into very small diamond squares, stars, or any other form, then left to dry a little, and boiled in the soup till swelled to its full size, and tender. Nouille paste of four eggs; soup, 5 pints: 10 minutes. SAGO SOUP. Wash in several waters, and float off the dirt from six ounces of sago; put it into three quarts of good cold gravy-stock, and let it stew gently from half to three quarters of an hour ; stir it occasionally, that it may not burn nor stick to the stew-pan. A quarter- ounce more of sago to each pint of liquid, will thicken it to the consistency of peas-soup. It may be flavoured with half a wineglassful of Harvey’s sauce, as much cayenne as it may need, the juice of half a lemon, an ounce of sugar, and two glasses of sherry; or these may be omitted, and good beef-broth may be substituted for the gravy-soup, for a simple family dinner, or for an invalid. Sago, 6 ozs. ; soup, 3 quarts : 30 to 45 minutes. TAPIOCA SOUP. This is made in the same manner, and with the same proportions as the preceding soup, but it must be simmered from fifty to sixty minutes. RICE SOUP. In France this soup is served well thickened with the rice, which is stewed in it for upwards of an hour and a half, and makes thus, even with the common bouillon of the country, an excellent winter potage. Pick, and wipe in a dry cloth, eight ounces of the best rice ; add it, in small portions, to four quarts of hot soup, of which the boiling should not be checked as it is thrown in. When a clear soup is wanted, wash the rice, give it five minutes’ boil in water, drain it well, throw it into as much boiling stock or well-flavoured broth asSOUPS. CHAP. I.] 15 will keep it covered till done, and simmer it very softly until the grains are tender, but still separate; drain it, slip it into the soup, and let it remain in it a few minutes before it is served, but without simmering. When stewed in the stock, it may be put at once, after being drained, into the tureen, and the clear gravy soup may be poured to it. An easy English mode of making rice-soup is this: put the rice into plenty of cold water; when it boils throw in a small quantity of salt, let it simmer ten minutes, drain it well, throw it into the boiling soup, and simmer it gently from ten to fifteen minutes longer; some rice will be tender in half that time. An extra quantity of stock must be allowed for the reduction of this soup, which is always considerable. WHITE RICE SOUP. Throw four ounces of well-washed rice into boiling water, and in five minutes after pour it into a sieve, drain it well, and put it into a couple of quarts of good white, boiling stock ; let it stew till tender ; season the soup with salt, cayenne, and powdered mace; stir to it three-quarters of a pint of very rich cream, give it one boil, and serve it quickly. Rice, 4 ozs.: boiled 5 minutes. Soup, 2 quarts : three- quarters of an hour or more. Seasoning of salt, mace, and cayenne; cream three-quarters of a pint: 1 minute. RICE-FLOUR SOUP. Mix with a little cold broth, eight ounces of fine rice- flour, and pour it into a couple of quarts of broth, or gravy-soup, when boiling fast. Add to it mace, and cayenne, with a little salt if needful. It will require but ten minutes’ boiling. Soup, 2 quarts; rice-flour, 8 ozs. : 10 minutes. Ohs.—Two dessertspoonsful of currie-powder, and the strained juice of half a moderate-sized lemon will greatly improve this soup : it may also be converted into a good common white soup, (if it be made of veal£chap. I. MODERN COOKERY. 16 stock,) by the addition of three quarters of a pint of thick cream to the rice. STOCK FOR WHITE SOUP. Though a knuckle of veal is usually preferred for this stock, part of the neck will, on an emergency, answer very well. Whichever joint be chosen, let it be thoroughly washed, once or twice divided, and laid into a delicately clean soup pot, or well-tinned large stout iron saucepan, upon a pound of lean ham, freed entirely from skin and fat, and cut into thick slices. Should very rich soup be wished for, pour in a pint only of cold water for each pound of meat, but otherwise a pint and a half may be allowed. When the soup has been thoroughly cleared from scum, which should be carefully taken off, from the time of its first be- ginning to boil, throw in an ounce of salt to the gallon, (more can be added afterwards if needed,) two mild onions, a moderate-sized head of celery, two carrots, a small teaspoonful of whole white pepper, and two blades of mace ; and let the soup stew very softly from five to six hours if the quantity be large : it should simmer until the meat falls from the bones. The skin of a calf’s head, a calf’s foot, or an old fowl may always be added to this stock with good effect. Strain it into a clean deep pan, and keep it in a cool place till wanted for use. Lean ham, 1 lb.; veal, 7 lbs.; water, 4 to 6 quarts; salt, 1J oz. (more if needed); onions, 2; celery, 1 head ; carrots, 2; pepper-corns, 1 teaspoonful; mace, 2 blades : five to six hours. MUTTON-STOCK FOR SOUPS. Equal parts of beef and mutton, with the addition of a small portion of ham, or very lean bacon, make ex- cellent stock, especially for winter-soups. The necks of fowls, the bones of an undressed calf’s head, or of any uncooked joint may be added to it with advantage. According to the quality of soup desired, pour from aCHAP. I.] SOUPS. 17 pint to a pint and a half of cold water to each pound of meat; and after the liquor has been well skimmed on its beginning to boil, throw in an ounce and a half of salt to the gallon, two small heads of celery, three mild, middling-sized onions, three well-flavoured turnips, as many carrots, a faggot of thyme and parsley, half a teaspoonful of white pepper-corns, twelve cloves, and a large blade of mace. Draw the soup-pot to the side of the fire, and boil the stock as gently as possible for about six hours ; then strain, and set it by for use. Be particularly careful to clear it entirely from fat before it is prepared for table. One third of beef or veal, with two of mutton, will make very good soup ; or mutton only will answer the purpose quite well upon occasion. Beef, 4 lbs.; mutton, 4 lbs.; (or, beef or veal from 2 to 3 lbs.; mutton, from 5 to 6 lbs. ;) water, 1 gallon to 1 J; salt, 1J oz.; mild turnips, 1 lb.; onions,. 6 ozs.; carrots, f- lb.; celery, 6 to 8 ozs.; 1 bunch of herbs ; pepper-corns, J teaspoonful; cloves, 12 ; mace, 1 large blade : six hours. Obs.—Salt should be used sparingly at first for stock in which any portion of ham is boiled; allowance should also be made for its reduction, in case of its being required for gravy. THE LORD MAYOR’S SOUP. Wash thoroughly two sets of moderate-sized pigs’ ears and feet, from which the hair has been carefully removed; add to them five quarts of cold water, and stew them very gently, with a faggot of savoury herbs, and one large onion stuck with a dozen cloves, for nearly four hours, when the ears may be lifted out; stew the feet for another hour, then take them up, strain the soup, and set it in a cool place that it may become cold enough for the fat to be quite cleared from it. Next, bone the ears and feet, cut the flesh down into dice, throw a clean folded cloth over it, and leave it so till the soup requires to be prepared for table; then strew upon it two tablespoonsful of savoury herbs minced c[CHAP. I. MODERN COOKERY. 18 small, half a saltspoonful of cayenne, a little white pepper, and some salt. Put into a large saucepan half a pound of good butter, and when it begins to simmer thicken it gradually with as much flour as it will absorb; keep these stirred over a very gentle fire for ten minutes or more, but do not allow them to take the slightest colour; pour the soup to them by degrees, letting it boil up after each portion is added; put in the meat, and half a pint of sherry, simmer the whole from three to five minutes ; dish the soup, and slip into it two or three dozens of delicately fried forcemeat- balls. (See Chapter VI.) Pigs’ feet, 8; ears, 4; water, 5 quarts; bunch savoury-herbs; 1 large onion; cloves, 12: three and a half to four hours, feet, one hour more.

Minced herbs, 2 tablespoonsful; cayenne and common pepper, each, ^ saltspoonful; salt, ^ teaspoonful or more; sherry, J pint: three to five minutes. Forcemeat-balls, 2 to 3 dozens, Obs.—We have given this receipt with the slightest possible variation from the original, which we derived from a neighbourhood where the soup made by it was extremely popular. We have better adapted it to our own taste by the following alterations. Obs. 2.—This will become a very rich soup if good bouillon (See page 7.) or strong veal broth be used for it instead of water. THE LORD mayor’s SOUP. (Author's Receipt.') We prefer to have this soup made, in part, the even- ing before it is wanted. Add the same proportion of water to the ears and feet as in the preceding directions ; skim it thoroughly when it first boils, and throw in a tablespoonful of salt, two onions of moderate size, a small head of celery, a bunch of herbs, two whole * The safer plan for an inexperienced cook, is to weigh the flour, and then to sprinkle it from a dredging-box into the butter.19 SOUPS. CHAP. I.] carrots, a small teaspoonful of white pepper-corns, and a blade of mace. Stew these softly until the ears and feet are perfectly tender, and after they are lifted out, let the liqour be kept just simmering only, while they are being boned, that it may not be too much reduced. Put the bones back into it, and stew them as gently as possible for an hour; then strain the soup into a clean pan, and set it by till the morrow in a cool place. The flesh should be cut into dice while it is still warm, and covered with the cloth before it becomes quite cold. To prepare the soup for table, clear the stock from fat and sediment, put it into a very clean stewpan, or deep, well-tinned saucepan, and stir to it, when it boils, six ounces of the finest rice-flour smoothly mixed with a quarter-teaspoonful of cayenne, three times as much of mace, and salt, the strained juice of a lemon, three tablespoonsful of Harvey’s sauce, and half a pint of good sherry or Madeira. Simmer the whole for six or eight minutes, add more salt if needful, stir the soup often, and skim it tho- roughly ; put in the meat, and herbs, and after they have boiled gently for five minutes, dish the soup, add forcemeat and egg-balls or not, at pleasure, and send it to table quickly. Moderate-sized pigs’ feet, 8 ; ears, 4 ; water, 5 qts. ; salt, 1 tablespoonful; onions, 2 ; celery, 1 head ; carrots, 2 ; bunch of herbs; pepper-corns, 1 small teaspoonful ; mace, 1 blade: three and a half hours, to four and a half.

Savoury- herbs, 2 tablespoonsful, 5 minutes. Ohs.—Should the quantity of stock exceed five pints, an additional ounce or more of rice must be used, and the flavouring be altogether increased in proportion. Of the minced herbs, two thirds should be parsley, and the remainder equal parts of lemon-thyme and winter-savoury, unless sweet basil should be at hand, c 2[CHAP. I. MODERN COOKERY. 20 when a teaspoonful of it should be substituted for half of the parsley. To some tastes a seasoning of sage would be acceptable; and a slice or two of lean ham will much improve the flavour of the soup. COCOA-NUT SOUP. Pare the dark rind from a very fresh cocoa-nut, and grate it fine on an exceedingly clean, bright grater; weigh it, and allow two ounces for each quart of soup. Simmer it gently for one hour in the stock, which should then be strained and thickened for table. This nut imparts a remarkably fine flavour to any kind of soup or broth, and it is considerably heightened by browning it with a morsel of fresh butter to a fine amber-colour, in a thick stewpan or saucepan, over a slow fire, before the soup is poured to it. It must be stirred constantly, and the greatest care should be taken that no single particle be burned. An ounce of butter will be sufficient for a quarter-pound of the nut, which should be added as soon as the butter is just dissolved. Veal-stock, gravy-soup, or broth, 5 pints; grated cocoa-nut, 5 ozs. : one hour. Flour of rice, 5 ozs. : mace, § teaspoonful; little cayenne • and salt; mixed with J pint cream, if at hand: 10 minutes. For brown soup : butter, 1J oz.; cocoa-nut, 5 ozs. ; 5 to 10 minutes.

JERUSALEM ARTICHOKE, OR PALESTINE SOUP. Wash and pare quickly some freshly-dug artichokes, and to preserve their colour, throw them into spring- water as they are done, but do not let them remain in it after all are ready. Boil three pounds of them in water for ten minutes; lift them out, and slice them into three pints of boiling stock ; when they have stewed gently in this from fifteen to twenty minutes, press them, with the soup, through a fine sieve, and put the whole into a clean saucepan with a pint and a half more of stock; add sufficient salt and cayenne to season it, skim it well, and after it has simmered two or three minutes, stir to it a pint of rich boiling cream.

I. broth, made the clay before, and perfectly cleared from fat, will answer very well as a substitute; milk, too, may in part take the place of cream, when this last is scarce: the proportion of artichokes should then be increased a little. Yegetable-marrow, when young, makes a superior soup even to this, which is a most excellent one. It should be well pared, trimmed, and sliced into a small quantity of boiling veal-stock, or broth, and when perfectly tender, pressed through a fine sieve, and mixed with more stock, and some cream. In France the marrow is stewed first in butter, with a large mild onion or two, also sliced; and afterwards in a quart or more of water, which is poured gradually to it; it is next passed through a tammy,* seasoned with pepper and salt, and mixed with a pint or two of milk, and a little cream. COMMON CARROT SOUP. The easiest way of making this soup is to boil some carrots very tender in water slightly salted; then to pound them extremely fine, and to mix gradually with them boiling gravy-soup, (or bouillon) in the proportion of a quart to twelve ounces of the carrot. The soup should then be passed through a strainer, seasoned with salt and cayenne, and served very hot, with fried bread in a separate dish. If only the red outsides of the carrot be used, the colour of the soup will be very bright: they should be weighed after they are pounded. Turnip soup may also be made in the same manner. Soup, 2 quarts; pounded carrot, 1-J- lb.; salt, cay- enne : 5 minutes. A FINER CARROT SOUP. Scrape very clean and cut away any blemishes from some highly-flavoured red carrots; wash, and wipe them dry. Cut them in quarter-inch slices.

Press them through a sieve or strainer with the soup ; add salt, and cayenne if required; boil the whole gently for five minutes, take off all the scum, and serve the soup as hot as possible. Send it to table with a dish of bread, cut in dice, and fried. Butter 3 ozs.; carrots 2 lbs.: 1 hour. Soup 4^ pints : 50 to 60 minutes. Salt, cayenne : 5 minutes. Obs.—Three ounces of Scotch, or of pearl barley, soaked for one night, and stewed slowly the next day for an hour and a half, in a quart of broth, then mixed with common carrot soup, will make what is considered, by many persons, an excellent potage. A fashionable variety of this soup is also made by diminishing a little the quantity of carrots, and adding to it three ounces of rice previously swelled in broth till tender. COMMON TURNIP SOUP. Wash and wipe the turnips, pare and weigh them ; allow a pound and a half for every quart of soup. Cut them in slices about a quarter of an inch thick. Melt four ounces of butter in a clean stewpan, and put in the turnips before it begins to boil; stew them gently for three quarters of an hour, taking care that they shall not brown. Then have the proper quantity of soup ready boiling, pour it to them, and let them simmer in it for three quarters of an hour. Pulp the whole through a coarse sieve or soup-strainer, put it again on the fire, keep it stirred till it has boiled three minutes, take off the scum, add salt and pepper, if re- quired, and serve it very hot. Turnips 3 lbs.; butter 4 ozs.: § hour. Soup 2 quarts : § hour. Last time : 3 minutes.[CHAP. I. 24 MODERN COOKERY * A QUICKLY MADE TURNIP SOUP. Pare and slice into three pints of veal or mutton stock, or of good broth, three pounds of young mild turnips; stew them gently from twenty-five to thirty minutes, or until they can be reduced quite to pulp; press the whole through a sieve, add to it another quart of stock, a seasoning of salt, white pepper, and one lump of sugar; simmer it a minute or two, skim and serve it. A large white onion, when the flavour is liked, may be sliced and stewed with the turnips. A little cream improves much the colour of this soup. Turnips, 3 lbs; soup, 5 pints : 25 to 30 minutes. POTATOE SOUP. Mash to a smooth paste three pounds of good mealy potatoes, that have been steamed, or boiled very dry ; mix with them by degrees, two quarts of boiling broth, pass the soup through a strainer, set it again on the fire, add pepper and salt, and let it boil five minutes. Take ofi* entirely the black scum that will rise upon it, and serve it very hot with fried or toasted bread.

Dissolve, over a gentle fire, four ounces and a half of good butter, in a wide stewpan or saucepan, and slice in directly two pounds of sweet tender parsnips; let them stew very softly till all are tender, then pour in gradually sufficient veal stock, or good broth, to cover them, and boil the whole slowly from twenty minutes to half an hour; press it with a wooden spoon through a fine sieve, add as much stock as will make two quarts in all, season the soup with salt and white pepper, or cayenne, give it one boil, skim, and serve it very hot.

When the soup is reduced one third by slow simmering, strain it off, and set it by till cold ; then free it carefully from the fat and sedi- ment, and heat it again in a very clean stewpan. Mix with it when it boils, a pint of thick cream smoothly blended with an ounce of good arrow-root, two ounces of very fresh vermicelli previously boiled tender in wTater slightly salted and well drained from it, and an ounce and a half of almonds blanched, and cut in strips;* give it one minute’s simmer, and serve it immediately, with a French roll in the tureen. Yeal, 5 lbs.; water, 3 quarts; \\ oz. salt; onions, 2| ozs.; 20 corns white pepper ; 2 large blades of mace: 5 hours or more. Cream, 1 pint; almonds, 1^ oz. ; vermicelli, 1 oz. : 1 minute. Little thickening if needed. Obs.-~-Cream should always be boiled for a few minutes before it is added to any soup. The yolks of two or three very fresh eggs beaten well, and mixed with half a pint of the boiling soup, may be stirred into the whole, after it is taken from the fire. Some per- sons put the eggs into the tureen, and add the soup to them by degrees ; but this is not so well. If a superior white soup to this be wanted, put three quarts of water to seven pounds of veal, and half a pound of the lean part of a ham; or instead of water, use very clear, weak veal broth. Grated Parmesan cheese should be handed round the table when white or maccaroni soup is served. * We have given this receipt without any variation from the original, as the soup made exactly by it was much approved by the guests of the hospitable country gentleman, at whose elegant table it was served often for many years ; but we would rather recommend that the almonds should be pounded, or merely blanched, cut in spikes, stuck into the crumb of a French roll, and put into the tureen, simply to give flavour to the soup.SOUPS. CHAP. I.] 27 A RICHER WHITE SOUP. Pound very fine indeed, six ounces of sweet almonds, then add to them six ounces of the breasts of roasted chickens or partridges, and three ounces of the whitest bread which has been soaked in a little veal broth, and squeezed very dry in a cloth. Beat these altogether to an extremely smooth paste ; then pour to them boiling and by degrees, two quarts of rich veal-stock; strain the soup through a fine hair sieve, set it again over the fire, add to it a pint of thick cream, and serve it, as soon as it is at the point of boiling, with a French roll in the tureen. When cream is very scarce, or not easily to be procured, this soup may be thickened sufficiently without it by increasing the quantity of almonds to eight or ten ounces, and pouring to them, after they have been reduced to the finest paste, a pint of boiling stock, which must be again wrung from them through a coarse cloth with very strong pressure : the propor- tion of meat and bread also should then be nearly doubled. The stock should be well-seasoned with mace and cayenne before it is added to the other ingredients. Almonds, 6 oz.; breasts of chicken or partridges, 6 oz.; soaked bread, 3 oz. ; veal-stock, 2 quarts; cream, one pint. Obs. 1.—Some persons pour the yolks of four or five hard-boiled eggs with the almonds, meat, and bread for this white soup; French cooks beat smoothly with them an ounce or two of whole rice, previously boiled from fif- teen to twenty minutes. Obs. 2,—rA good plain white soup may be made simply by adding to a couple of quarts of pale veal- stock or strong well-flavoured veal broth, a thickening of arrow-root, and from half to three quarters of a pint of cream * Four ounces of maccaroni boiled tender and well drained may be slipped into it a minute or two before it is dished, but the thickening may then be diminished a little.28 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. I. MOCK TURTLE SOUP. To make a single tureen of this favourite English soup in the most economical manner, when there is no stock at hand, stew gently down in a gallon of water four pounds of the fleshy part of the shin of beef, or of the neck, if more convenient, with two or three carrots, one onion, a small head of celery, a bunch cf savoury herbs, a blade of mace, a half teaspoonful of pepper-corns, and an ounce of salt. When the meat is quite in frag- ments, strain off the broth, and pour it when cold upon three pounds of the knuckle, or of the neck of veal; sim- mer this until the flesh has quite fallen from the bones, but be careful to stew it as softly as possible, or the quantity of stock will be so much reduced as to be insufficient for the soup. Next, take the half of a fine calf’s head with the skin on, remove the brains, and then bone it* entirely, or let the butcher be requested to do this, and to return the bones with it s these, when there is time, may be stewed with the veal, to enrich the stock, or boiled after- wards with the head and tongue. Strain the soup through a hair sieve into a clean pan, and let it drain closely from the meat. When it is nearly or quite cold, clear off all the fat from it; roll the head lightly round, leaving the tongue inside, or taking it out, as is most convenient, secure it with tape or twine, pour the soup over, and bring it gently to boil upon a moderate fire; keep it well skimmed, and simmer it from an hour to an hour and a quarter; then lift the head into a deep pan or tureen, add the soup to it, and let it remain in until two parts cold, as this will prevent the edges from becoming dark. Cut into quarter-inch slices, and then divide into dice from six to eight ounces of the lean of an undressed ham, and if possible, one of good flavour; * This is so simple and easy a process, that the cookmay readily accomplish it with very little attention. Let her only work the knife close to the bone always, so as to take the flesh clean from it, instead of leaving- large fragments on. The jaw-bone may first be removed, and the flesh turned back from the edge of the other.CHAP. I.] SOUPS. 29 free it perfectly from fat, rind, and the smoked edges ; peel and slice four moderate sized eschalots, or if these should not be at hand, one mild onion in lieu of them. Dissolve in a well-tinned stewpan, or thick iron saucepan which holds a gallon or more, four ounces of butter; put in the ham and eschalots, or onion, with half a dozen cloves, two middling sized blades of mace, a half-tea- spoonful of pepper-corns, three or four very small sprigs of thyme, three teaspoonsful of minced parsley, one of lemon thyme and savoury mixed, and when the flavour is thought appropriate, the very thin rind of half a small fresh lemon. Stew these as softly as possible for nearly or quite an hour, and keep the pan frequently shaken; then put into a dredging box, two ounces ofvfine dry flour and sprinkle it to them by degrees ; mix the whole well together, and after a few minutes more of gentle simmering, add very gradually five full pints of the stock taken free of fat and sediment, and made boiling before it is poured in ; shake the pan strongly round as the first portions of it are added, and continue to do so until it contains from two to three pints, when the remainder may be poured in at once, and the pan placed by the side of the fire that it may boil in the gentlest manner for an hour. At the end of that time turn the whole into a hair sieve placed over a large pan, and if the liquid should not run through freely, knock the sides of the sieve, but do not force it through with a spoon, as that would spoil the appearance of the stock. The head in the mean while should have been cut up, ready to add to it. For the finest kind of mock turtle, only the skin, with the fat that adheres to it should be used ; and this, with the tongue, should be cut down into one inch squares, or if preferred, into strips of an inch wide. For ordinary occasions, the lean part of the flesh may be added also, but as it is always sooner done than the skin, it is better to add it a little later to the stock. When it is quite ready, put it with the strained stock into a clean pan, and simmer it from three quarters of an hour to a full hour: it should be perfectly tender,30 fCHAP. I. MODERN COOKERY. without being allowed to break. Cayenne, if needed, should be thrown into the stock before it is strained; salt should be used sparingly, on account of the ham, until the whole of the other ingredients have been mixed together, when a sufficient quantity must be stirred into the soup to season it properly. A couple of glasses of good sherry or Madeira, with a dessertspoonful of strained lemon juice are usually added two or three minutes only before the soup is dished, that the spirit and flavour of the wine may not have time to evaporate; but it is sometimes preferred mellowed down by longer boiling. The proportion of lemon juice may be doubled at will, but much acid is not generally liked. We can assure the reader of the excellence of the soup made by this receipt: it is equally palatable and delicate, and not heavy or cloying to the stomach, like many of the elaborate compositions which bear its name. The fat, through the whole process, should be carefully skimmed off. The ham gives far more savour, when used as we have directed, than when even in much larger propor- tions it is boiled down in the stock. Two dozens of forcemeat balls, prepared by the receipt No. 11, Chap. VI., should be slipped into the soup when it is ready for table. It is no longer customary to serve egg-balls in it. First broth :—shin, or neck of beef, 4 lbs.; water, 4 quarts; carrots, 2 or 3; onion, 1 large mild; celery, small head; bunch savoury herbs ; mace, 1 large blade ; pepper-corns, | teaspoonful; cloves, 6; salt, l oz. : 5 hours or more, very gently.

Obs■, 1 .■—The beef, veal, bones of the head, and vege- tables may be stewed down together when more con- venient : it is only necessary that a really good, well- flavoured, and rather deeply-coloured stock should be prepared. A calf’s foot is always an advantageous addition to it, and the skin of another calf’s head* a better one still. Obs. 2. — A couple of dozen mushroom buttons, cleaned with salt and flannel, then wiped very dry, and sliced, and added to the ham and herbs, when they have been simmered together about half an hour, will be found a great improvement to the soup ; but when they are not procurable, a pleasant flavour may be imparted to it by substituting two or three fresh bay-leaves. Obs. 3.—Claret is sometimes added to this soup instead of sherry or Madeira, but we do not think it would in general suit English taste so well. From two to three tablespoonsful of Harvey’s sauce can be stirred in with the wine when it is liked, or when the colour requires deepening. OLD-FASHIONED MOCK TURTLE. After having taken out the brain and washed and soaked the head well, pour to it nine quarts of cold water, bring it gently to boil, skim it very clean, boil it, if large, an hour and an half, lift it out, and put into the liquor eight pounds of neck of beef, lightly * Country butchers in preparing calf’s head for sale in the ordinary way take off the skin (or scalp), considered so essential to the excellence of this soup, and frequently throw it away; it may, therefore, often be procured from them at very slight cost, and is the best possible addition to the mock turtle. It is cleared from the head in detached portions with the hair on, but this may easily be removed after a few minutes’ scalding as from the head itself, or the feet, by the direction given in Chap. IX.MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. I. 32 browned in a little fresh butter, with three or four thick slices, or a knuckle of lean ham, four large onions sliced, three heads of celery, three large carrots, a large bunch of sweet herbs, the rind of a lemon pared very thin, a dessertspoonful of pepper-corns, two ounces of salt, and after the meat has been taken from the head, all the bones and fragments. Stew these gently from seven to eight hours, then strain off the stock, and set it into a very cold place, that the fat may become firm enough on the top to be cleared off easily. The skin and fat of the head should be taken off together and divided into strips of two or three inches in length and one in width; the tongue may be cut in the same manner, or into dice. Put the stock, of which there ought to be between four and five quarts, into a large soup or stew- pot ; thicken it when it boils with four ounces of fresh butter* mixed with an equal weight of fine dry flour, a half-teaspoonful of pounded mace, and a third as much of cayenne ; (it is better to use these sparingly at first, and to add more should the soup require it, after it has boiled some little time); pour in half a pint of sherry, stir the whole together until it has simmered for a minute or two, then put in the head, and let it stew gently from an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half: stir it often, and clear it perfectly from scum. Slip into it just before it is ready for table, three dozens of small forcemeat-balls ; the brain cut into dice (after having been well soaked, scalded,t and freed from the film), dipped into beaten yolk of egg, then into the finest crumbs mixed with salt, white pepper, a little grated nutmeg, fine lemon-rind, and chopped parsley, * When the butter is considered objectionable, the flour, with- out it, may be mixed to the smoothest batter possible, with a little cold stock or water, and stirred briskly into the boiling soup : the spices should be blended with it. t The brain should be blanched, that is, thrown into boiling water with a little salt in it, and boiled from five to eight minutes ; then lifted out, and laid into cold water for a quarter of an hour ; it must be wiped very dry before it is fried.CHAP. I.] SOUPS. 33 fried a fine brown, well drained and dried; and as many egg-balls, the size of a small marble, as four yolks of egg will supply. (See Chapter VI.) This quantity will be sufficient for two large tureens of soup: when the whole is not wanted for table at the same time, it is better to add wine only to so much as will be required for immediate consumption, or if it cannot conveniently be divided, to heat the wine in a small saucepan with a little of the soup, to turn it into the tureen, and then to mix it with the remainder by stirring the whole gently after the tureen is filled. Some persons simply put in the cold wine just before the s6up is dished, but this is not so well. Whole calf’s head with skin on, boiled 1J hour.

D34 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. I, GOOD CALF’S HEAD SOUP. (Not Expensive.') Boil down from six to seven pounds of the thick part of a shin of beef with a little lean ham, or a slice of hung beef trimmed free from the smoky edges, should either of these last be at hand, in five quarts of water, till reduced nearly half, with the addition, when it first begins to stew, of an ounce of salt, a large bunch of savoury herbs, one large onion, a head of celery, three carrots, two or three turnips, two small blades of mace, eight or ten- cloves, and a few white or black pepper- corns. Let it boil gently, that it may not be too much reduced, for six or seven hours, then strain it into a clean pan and set it by for use. Take out the bone from half a calf’s head with the skin on (the butcher will do this if desired), wash, salt, and bind it with a bit of tape or twine, and lay it into a stewpot, with the bones and tongue; cover the whole with the beef stock, and stew7 it for an hour and a half; then lift it into a deep earthen pan and let it cool in the liquor, as this will prevent the edges from being dry or discoloured. Take it out before it is quite cold ; strain, and skim all the fat carefully from the stock; heat five pints in a large clean saucepan, with the head cut into small thick slices or into inch-squares. As quite the w'hole will not be needed, leave a portion of the fat, but add every morsel of the skin to the soup, and of the tongue also. Should the first of these not be perfectly tender, it must be simmered gently till it be so; then stir into the soup from six to eight ounces of fine rice-flour mixed with a quarter-teaspoonful of cayenne, twice as much freshly pounded mace, half a wineglassful of mushroom catsup, and sufficient cold broth or water to render it of the consistency of batter; boil the whole from eight to ten minutes ; take off the scum, and throw in twro glasses of sherry ; dish the soup and slip into the tureen some delicately-fried, and w7ell-dried forcemeat-balls made by the receipt No. 1, 2, or 3 of Chapter YI.

As much salt as may be required should be added to the stock when the head first begins to boil in it: the cook must regulate also by the taste the exact proportion of cayenne, mace, and catsup, which will flavour the soup agreeably. The fragments of the head, with the bones and the residue of the beef used for stock, if stewed down together with some water and a few fresh vege- tables, will afford some excellent broth, such as would be highly acceptable, especially if well thickened with rice, to many a poor family during the winter months.

Put back into the soup the bodies of the rabbits, with two mild onions of moderate size, a head of celery, three carrots, a faggot of savoury herbs, two blades of mace, a half-teaspoonful of pep- per-corns, and an ounce of salt. Stew the whole softly about four hours, strain it off, let it stand to settle, pour it gently from the sediment, put from four to five pints into a clean stewpan, and mix it very gradually while hot, with the pounded rabbit-flesh : this must be done with care, for if the liquid be not added in very small portions at first, the meat will gather into lumps, and will not easily be worked smooth afterwards. Add as much pounded mace and cayenne as will season the soup pleasantly, and pass it through38 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. I. a coarse but very clean sieve; wipe out tlie stewpan, put back the soup into it, and stir in when it boils, a pint and a quarter of good cream, mixed with a table- spoonful of the best arrow-root: salt, if needed, should be thrown in previously. Young rabbits, 3 ; water, or clear veal-broth, 7 pints : three quarters of an hour. Remains of rabbits ; onions, 2 ; celery, 1 head; carrots, 3; savoury herbs; mace, 2 blades ; white pepper-corns, a half-teaspoonful; salt, 1 oz.: four hours. Soup 4 to 5 pints; pounded rabbit- flesh, 8 ozs. ; salt, mace, and cayenne, if needed ; cream, 1 pint and a quarter; arrow-root, 1 tablespoonful (or 1 oz. and a-half.) BROWN RABBIT SOUP. 'Cut down into joints, flour, and fry lightly, two full grown, or three young rabbits; add to them three onions of moderate side, also fried to a clear brown ; on these pour gradually seven pints of boiling water, throw in a large teaspoonful of salt, clear off all the scum with care as it rises, and then put to the soup a faggot off parsley, four not very large carrots, and a small teaspoonful of pepper-corns ; boil the whole very softly from five hours to five and a half; add more salt if needed, strain off the soup, let it cool sufficiently for the fat to be skimmed clean from it, heat it afresh, and send it to table with sippets of fried bread. Spice, with a thick- ening of rice-flour, or of wheaten flour browned in the oven, and mixed with a spoonful or two of very good mushroom catsup, or of Harvey’s sauce, can be added at pleasure to the above, with a few drops of eschalot, wine, or vinegar ; but the simple receipt will be found extremely good without them. Rabbits, 2 full grown, or 3 small; onions fried, 3, middling-sized; water, 7 pints ; salt, one large teaspoon- ful or more ; carrots, 4 ; faggot of parsley ; pepper-corns, one small teaspoonful: 5 to 5hours.39 CHAP. I.] SOUPS. SUPERLATIVE HARE SOUP. Cut down a hare into joints, and put it into a soup- pot or large stewpan, with about a pound of lean ham, in thick slices, from three to six moderate-sized onions, three blades of mace, a faggot of thyme, sweet mar- joram, and parsley, and about three quarts of good beef- stock, Let it stew very gently for full two hours from the time of its first beginning to boil, and more, if the hare be old. Strain the soup and pound together very fine the slices of ham and all the flesh of the back, legs, and shoulders of the hare, and put this meat into a stewpan with the liquor in which it was boiled, the crumb of two French rolls, and half a pint of port- wine. Set it on the stove to simmer twenty minutes ; then rub it through a sieve, place it again on the stove till very hot, but do not let it boil; season it with salt and cayenne, and send it to table directly. Hare, one; ham, 12 to 16 ozs; onions, 3 to 6; mace, 3 blades ; faggot of savoury herbs ; beef-stock, 3 quarts: two hours. Crumb of 2 rolls ; port-wine, half a pint ; little salt and cayenne : 20 minutes. A LESS EXPENSIVE HARE SOUP. Pour on two pounds of neck or shin of beef, and a hare well washed and carved into joints, one gallon of cold water, and when it boils and has been thoroughly skimmed, add an ounce and a half of salt, two onions, one large head of celery, three moderate-sized carrots, a teaspoonful of black pepper-corns, and six cloves. Let these stew very gently for three hours, or longer, should the hare not be perfectly tender. Then take up the principal joints, cut the meat from them, mince, and pound it to a fine paste, with the crumb of two penny rolls (or two ounces of the crumb of household bread), that has been soaked in a little of the boiling soup, and then pressed very dry in a cloth ; strain, and mix smoothly with it, the stock from the remainder of the hare ; pass the soup through a strainer, season itMODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. X. 40 with cayenne, and serve it when at the point of boiling : if not sufficiently thick, add to it a tablespoonful of arrow- root, moistened with a little cold broth, and let the soup simmer for an instant afterwards. Two or three glasses of port-wine, and two dozens of small forcemeat balls, are sometimes added to this soup with very good effect. Beef, 2 lbs.; hare, one; water, one gallon; salt, 1^ oz.; onions, two ; celery, one head; carrots, 3 ; bunch savoury herbs; pepper - corns, one tea- spoonful ; cloves, 6: three hours, or more. Bread, 2 ozs.; cayenne; arrow-root (if needed), one table- spoonful. PHEASANT SOUP. Half roast a brace of well-kept pheasants, and flour them rather thickly -when they are first laid to the fire. Let them cool; then take all the flesh from the breasts, put it aside, and keep it covered from the air; carve down the remainder of the birds into joints ; bruise the bodies thoroughly, and stew the whole gently from two to three hours in five pints of strong beef-broth; then strain off the soup, and press as much of it as possible from the pheasants. Let it cool, and in the mean time strip the skin from the breasts, mince them small, and pound them to the finest paste, with half as much fresh butter, and half of dry crumbs of bread; season these well with cayenne, sufficiently with salt, and moderately with pounded mace, and grated nutmeg, and add, when their flavour is liked, three or four eschalots, previously boiled tender in a little of the soup, left till cold, and minced before they are put into the mortar; moisten the mixture wdth the yolks of two or three eggs, roll it into small balls of equal size, dust a little flour upon them, skim all the fat from the soup, heat it in a clean stewpan, and when it boils throw them in and poach them from ten to twelve minutes, but first ascertain that the soup is properly seasoned with salt and cayenne. Minced savoury herbs, and even grated lemon-rind, would perhaps to English41 SOUPS. CHAP. I.] taste improve the forcemeat, as well as a small portion of lean barn, a thick slice of which might be stewed in the soup for the purpose. We have recommended that the birds should be partially roasted before they are put into the soup-pot, because their flavour is much finer when this is done than when they are simply stewed; they should be placed rather near to a brisk fire that they be quickly browned on the surface, without losing any of their juices, and the basting should be constant. A slight thickening of rice-flower or arrow-root can be added to the soup at pleasure, and the forcemeat-balls may be fried and slipped into the tureen when they are preferred so. Half a dozen eschalots lightly browned in butter, and a small head of celery may also be thrown in after the birds begin to stew, but nothing should be allowed to prevail over the natural flavour of the game itself, and this should be observed equally witli other kinds, as partridges, grouse, and venison. Pheasants, 2; roasted 20 to 30 minutes. Strong beef broth, or stock, 5 pints : 2 to 3 hours. Forcemeat- balls ; breasts of pheasants, half as much of dry bread crumbs and of butter, salt, mace, cayenne; yolks of 2 or 3 eggs (and at choice 3 or 4 boiled eschalots). Obs.—The stock may be made of six pounds of shin of beef, and four quarts of water reduced to within a pint and a half. An onion, a large carrot, a bunch of savoury herbs, and some salt and spice should be added to it: one pound of neck of veal or of beef will improve it. ANOTHER PHEASANT SOUP. Boil down the half-roasted birds as directed in the foregoing receipt, and add to the soup, after it is strained and re-heated, the breasts pounded to the finest paste with nearly as much bread soaked in a little of the stock and pressed very dry; for the proper manner of mixing them, see Potage a la Peine, page 35. Half a pint of small mushrooms cleaned as for pickling, then sliced rather thickly, and stew^ed from ten to fifteen minutes, without browning, in an ounce or twTo of fresh butter, with aMODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. I. 42 slight seasoning of mace, cayenne, and salt, then turned into the mortar and pounded with the other ingredients, will be found an excellent addition to the soup, which must be passed through a strainer after the breasts are added to if; brought to the point of boiling; and served with sippets a la Reine, or others simply fried of a deli- cate brown and well dried. We have occasionally had a small quantity of delicious soup made with the remains of birds that have been served at table; and where game is frequently dressed, the cook, by reserving all the fragments for the purpose, and combining different kinds, may often send up a good tureen of such, made at a very slight cost. Pheasants, 2; stock, 5 pints; bread soaked in gravy, (see Panada, Chapter VI.,) nearly as much in bulk as the flesh of the breasts of the birds; mushrooms, J pint, stewed in 1 to 2 ozs. of butter 10 to 15 minutes, then pounded with flesh of pheasants. Salt, cayenne, and mace, to season properly. PARTRIDGE SOUP. This is, we think, superior in flavour to the pheasant- soup. It should be made in precisely the same manner, but three birds allowed for it instead of two. Grouse and partridges together will make a still finer one ; the remains of roast grouse even, added to a brace of par- tridges, will produce a very good effect. MULL AG AT AWN Y SOUP. Slice, and fry gently in some good butter three or four large onions, and when they are of a fine equal amber- colour lift them out with a slice and put them into a deep stewpot, or large thick saucepan; throw a little more butter into the pan, and then brown lightly in it a young rabbit, or the prime joints of two, or a fowl cut down small, and floured. When the meat is sufficiently browned, lay it upon the onions, pour gradually to them a quart of good boiling stock, and stew it gently from three quarters of an hour to an hour; then take it out,43 SOUPS. CHAP. I.] and press the stock and onions through a fine sieve or strainer. Add to them two pints and a half more of stock, pour the whole into a clean pan, and when it boils stir to it two heaped tablespoonsful of currie-powder mixed with nearly as much of browned flour, and a little cold water or broth ; put it in the meat, and sim- mer it for twenty minutes or longer should it not be perfectly tender, add the juice of a small lemon just before it is dished, serve it very hot, and send boiled rice to table with it. Part of a pickled mango is sometimes stewed in this soup, and is much recommended by persons who have been long resident in India. We have given here the sort of receipt commonly used in England for mullagatawny, but a much finer soup may be made by departing from it in some respects. The onions, of which the proportion may be increased or diminished to the taste, after being fried slowly, and with care, that no part shall be overdone, may be stewed for an hour in the first quart of stock with three or four ounces of grated cocoa-nut, which will impart a rich mellow flavour to the whole. After all of this that can be rubbed through the sieve has been added to as much stock as will be required for the soup, and the currie- powder and thickening have boiled in it for twenty minutes, the flesh of part of a calf’s head previously stewed almost sufficiently, and cut as for mock turtle, with a sweetbread also stewed or boiled in broth tolerably tender, and divided into inch-squares, will make an admirable mullagatawny, if simmered in the stock until they have taken the flavour of the currie-seasoning. The flesh of a couple of calves’ feet, with a sweetbread or two, may, when more convenient, be substituted for the head. A large cupful of thick cream, first mixed and boiled with a teaspoonful of flour or arrow-root to pre- vent its curdling, and stirred into the soup before the lemon-juice, will enrich and improve it much. Rabbit, I, or the best joints of 2, or fowl, 1 ; large onions, 4 to 6 ; stock, 1 quart: § to 1 hour. 2§ pints more of stock ; currie-powder, 2 heaped tablespoonsful,MODERN COOKERY. 44 [CHAP.

Or,—onions, 3 to 6; cocoa-nut, 8 to 4 ozs.; stock, one quart: stewed, one hour. Stock, 3 pints, (in addition to the first quart); currie-powder and thick- ening each, 2 large tablespoonsful : 20 minutes. Flesh of part of calf’s head and sweetbread, quarter of an hour or more. Thick cream, one cupful; flour, or arrow-root, one teaspoonful: boiled 2 minutes, and stirred to the soup. Chili vinegar, one tablespoonful, or lemon juice, 2 tablespoonsful. Ohs. 1.—The brain of the calf’s head stewed for twenty minutes in a little of the stock, then rubbed through a sieve, diluted gradually with more of the stock, and added as thickening to the soup, will be found an admirable substitute for part of the flour. Ohs. 2.—Three or four pounds of a breast of veal, or an equal weight of mutton, free from bone and fat, may take the place of rabbits or fowls in this soup, for a plain dinner. The veal should be cut into squares of an inch and a half, or into strips of an inch in width, and two in length ; and the mutton should be trimmed down in the same way, or into very small cutlets. Ohs. 3.—For an elegant table, the joints of rabbit or of fowl should always be boned before they are added to the soup, for which, in this case, a couple of each will be needed for a single tureen, as all the inferior joints must be rejected. TO BOIL RICE FOR MULLAGATAWNY SOUPS, OR FOR CURRIES. The Patna, or small-grained rice, which is not so good as the Carolina for the general purposes of cookery, is the sort which ought to be served with currie. First take out the unhusked grains, then wash the rice in two or three different waters, and put it into a large quantity of cold; bring it gently to boil, keeping it uncovered, and boil it softly for fifteen minutes, when it45 SOUPS. CHAP. I.] will be perfectly tender, and every grain will remain distinct. Throw it into a large cullender, and let it drain for ten minutes near the fire; should it not then appear quite dry, turn it into a dish, and set it for a short time into a gentle oven, or let it steam in a clean saucepan near the fire. It should neither be stirred, except just at first, to prevent its lumping, while it is still quite hard, nor touched with either fork or spoon ; the stew- pan may be shaken occasionally, should the rice seem to require it, and it should be thrown lightly from the cullender upon the dish. A couple of minutes before it is done, throw in some salt, and from the time of its beginning to boil, remove the scum as it rises. Patna rice, J lb; cold water, 2 quarts: boiled slowly, fifteen minutes. Salt, one large teaspoonful. Obs.—This, of all the modes of boiling rice, 'which we have tried, and they have been very numerous, is in- disputably the best. The Carolina rice even answers* •well dressed, in this way. One or two minutes, more or less, will sometimes, from the varying quality of the grain, be requisite to render it tender. ANOTHER RECEIPT FOR BOILING RICE. {Not so good as the preceding one.) Wash the rice thoroughly in several waters, and soak it for an hour; drain, and throw it into a large quantity of fast-boiling water. Leave it uncovered, take off the scum, and add salt when it is nearly done. When it has boiled from fifteen to eighteen minutes, drain it well, heap it lightly in a dish, and place it in a gentle oven to dry. Obs.—Rice is of far better flavour when cooked in so much water only as it will absorb; but it cannot then so easily be rendered dry enough to serve with currie, or with curried soups. One pint of rice, washed and soaked for a few minutes, then wiped very dry, and dropped by degrees into five half pints of water, which should boil quickly, and continue to do so, whileMODERN COOKERY. 46 [CHAP. L the rice is being added, and for a minute afterwards, and then placed over the fire, that it may stew very softly for half an hour, or until it is tender, and as dry as it will become without being burned, will be found very good. The addition of a couple of ounces of fresh butter, when it is nearly done, will convert it into a very pala- table dish of itself. VEGETABLE MULLAGATAWNY. Dissolve in a large stewpan, or thick iron saucepan, four ounces of butter, and when it is on the point of browning, throw in four large mild onions sliced, three pounds weight of young vegetable marrow, cut in large dice, and cleared from the skin and seeds, four large, or six moderate-sized cucumbers, pared, split, and emptied likewise of their seeds, and from three to six large acid apples, according to the taste; shake the pan often, and stew these over a gentle fire until they are tolerably tender; then strew lightly over, and mix well amongst them, three heaped tablespoonsful of mild currie-powder, with nearly a third as much of salt, and let the vege- tables stew from twenty to thirty minutes longer; then pour to them gradually sufficient boiling water (broth or stock if preferred), to just cover them, and when they are reduced almost to a pulp press the whole through a hair-sieve with a wooden spoon, and heat it in a clean stewpan with as much additional liquid as will make two quarts with that which was first added. Give any further flavouring that may be needed, whether of salt, cayenne, or acid, and serve the soup extremely hot. Should any butter appear on the surface, let it be care- fully skimmed off, or stir in a small dessertspoonful of arrow-root, (smoothly mixed with a little cold broth or water) to absorb it. Rice may be served with this soup at pleasure, but as it is of the consistency of winter peas soup, it scarcely requires any addition. The currie- powder may be altogether omitted for variety, and the whole converted into a plain vegetable potage; or it may be rendered one of high savour, by browning all47 CHAP. I.] SOUPS. the vegetables lightly, and adding to them rich brown stock. Tomatas, when in season, may be substituted for the apples, after being divided, and freed from their seeds. Butter, 4 ozs.; vegetable marrow, pared and scooped, •3 lbs.; large mild onions, 4 ; large cucumbers, 4; or middling sized, 6; apples, or tomatas, 3 to 6 : thirty to forty minutes. Mild currie-powder, 3 heaped table- spoonsful ; salt, one small tablespoonful: twenty to thirty minutes. Water, broth, or good stock, 2 quarts. CUCUMBER SOUP. Pare, split, and empty from eight to twenty* fine, well grown, but not old cucumbers,—those which have the fewest seeds are best for the purpose; throw a little salt over them, and leave them for an hour to drain, then put them with the white part only of a couple of mild onions, into a deep stewpan, or delicately clean saucepan, cover them nearly half an inch with pale, but good veal stock, and stew them gently until they are perfectly tender, which will be in from three quarters of an hour, to an hour and a quarter; press the whole through a hair-sieve, and add to it as much more stock as may be needed to make the quantity of soup required for table; and as the cucumbers, from their watery nature, will thicken it but little, stir to it when it boils, as much arrow-root, rice-flour, or tous les mois (see page 4), as will bring it to a good consistency; add from half to a whole pint of boiling cream, and serve the soup imme- diately. Salt and cayenne, sufficient to season it. should be thrown over the cucumbers when they are stewing. The yolks of six or eight eggs, mixed with a dessert- spoonful of Chili vinegar, may be used for this soup instead of cream; three dessertspoonsful of minced pars- ley may then be strewed into it a couple of minutes * This is a great disparity of numbers j but some regard must b e had to expense, where the vegetable cannot be obtained with facility.[chap. r. 48 MODERN COOKERY. before they are added; it must not, of course, be allowed to boil after they are stirred in. AN EXCELLENT GREEN PEAS SOUP. Take at their fullest size, but before they are of bad colour or worm-eaten, three pints of fine large peas, and boil them as for table (see Chapter XV.), with half a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda in the water, that they may be very green. When they are quite tender, drain them well, and put them into a couple of quarts of boiling, pale, but good beef or veal stock, and stew them in it gently for half an hour, then work the whole through a fine hair-sieve; put it into a clean pan and bring it to the point of boiling; add salt, should it be needed, and a small teaspoonful of pounded sugar, clear off the scum entirely, and serve the soup as hot as possible, with small pale sippets of fried bread. An elegant variety of it is made by adding a half pint more of stock to the peas, and about three quarters of a pint of asparagus points, boiled apart, and well drained before they are thrown into it, which should be done only the instant before it is sent to table : the fried bread will not then be needed. Green peas, 3 pints: boiled twenty-five to thirty minutes, or more. Veal or beef stock, 2 quarts (with peas) : half an hour. Sugar, one small teaspoonful; salt, if needed. Ohs.—When there is no stock at hand, four or five pounds of shin of beef, boiled slowly down with three quarts of water to two, and well seasoned with savoury herbs, young carrots, and onions, will serve instead quite well. A thick slice of lean, undressed ham would improve it. Should a common English peas soup be wished for, make it somewhat thinner than the one above, and add to it, just before it is dished, from half to three quarters of a pint of young peas boiled tender, and well drained.SOUPS. 49 CHAP. I.] GREEN PEAS SOUP, WITHOUT MEAT. Boil tender, in three quarts of water, with the propor- tions of salt and soda directed for them in Chapter XV., one quart of large, full grown peas; drain and pound them in a mortar, mix with them gradually five pints of the liquor in which they were boiled, put the w'hole again over the fire, and stew it gently for a quarter of an hour ; then press it through a hair sieve. In the mean time, simmer, in from three to four ounces of butter,* three large, or four small cucumbers, pared and sliced, the hearts of three or four lettuces shred small, from one to four onions, according to the taste, cut thin, a few small sprigs of parsley, and, when the flavour is liked, a dozen leaves or more of mint, roughly chopped : keep these stirred over a gentle fire for nearly or quite an hour, and strew over them a half-teaspoonful of salt, and a good seasoning of white pepper or cayenne. When they are partially done, drain them from the butter, put them into the strained stock, and let the whole boil gently until all the butter has been thrown to the surface, and been entirely cleared from it; then throw in from half to three quarters of a pint of young peas, boiled as for eating, and serve the soup immediately. When more convenient, the peas, with a portion of the liquor, may be pressed through a sieve, instead of being crushed in a mortar; and when the colour of the soup is not so much a consideration as the flavour, they may be slowly stewed till perfectly tender in four ounces of good butter, instead of being boiled: a few green onions, and some branches of parsley may then be added to them. Green peas, one quart; water, 5 pints; cucumbers, 3 to 6 ; lettuces, 3 or 4; onions, 1 to 4 ; little parsley; mint (if liked), 12 to 20 leaves; butter, 3 to 4 ozs.; salt, half-teaspoonful; seasoning of white pepper or * Some persons prefer the vegetables slowly fried to a fine brown, then drained on a sieve, and well dried before the fire ; but though more savoury so, they do not improve the colour of the soup. E[CHAP. I. 50 MODERN COOKERY. cayenne: 50 to 60 minutes. Young peas, half to three quarters of a pint. Ohs.—We' must repeat that the peas for these soups should not be old, as when they are so, their fine sweet flavour is entirely lost, and the dried ones would have almost as good an effect: nor should they be of inferior kinds. Freshly-gathered marrowfats, taken at nearly, or quite their full growth, will give the best quality of soup. We are credibly informed, but cannot assert it on our own authority, that it is often made for expensive tables in early spring, with the young, tender plants or halms of the peas, when they are about a foot in height. They are cut off close to the ground, like small salad, then boiled and pressed through a strainer, and mixed with the stock. The flavour is affirmed to be excellent. A CHEAP GREEN PEAS SOUP. Wash very clean, and throve into an equal quantity of boiling water, salted as for peas, three quarts of the shells, and in from twenty to thirty minutes, when they will be quite tender, turn the whole into a large strainer, and press the pods strongly with a wooden spoon. Measure the liquor, put two quarts of it into a clean,, deep saucepan, and when it boils, add to it a quart of full grown peas, two, or even three large cucumbers, as many moderate-sized lettuces stripped of the coarser leaves, and cut small, one large onion (or more if liked), sliced extremely thin and stewed for half an hour in a morsel of butter before it is added to the soup, or gently fried without being allowed to brown ; a branch or two of parsley, and, when the flavour is liked, a dozen leaves of mint. Stew these softly for an hour, with the addition of a small teaspoonful, or a larger quantity if required, of salt, and a good seasoning of fine white pepper, or of cayenne; then press the whole of the vegetables with the soup through a hair sieve, heat it afresh, and send it to table with a dish of small fried sippets. The colour will not be so bright as that of the more expensive soups which precede it, but it will be excellent in flavour.CHAP. I.] 51 SOUPS. Peashells, 3 quarts; water, 3 quarts: 20 to 30 minutes. Liquor from these, 2 quarts; full-sized green peas, 1 quart; large cucumbers, 2 or 3 ; lettuces, 3; onion, 1 (or more) ; little parsley; mint, 12 leaves; seasoning of salt and pepper or cayenne : stewed 1 hour. Ohs.—The cucumbers should be pared, quartered, and freed from the seeds before they are added to the soup. The peas, as we have said already more than once, should not be old, but taken at their full growth, before they lose their colour: the youngest of the shells ought to be selected for the liquor. RICH PEAS SOUP. Soak a quart of fine yellow split peas for a night, drain them well, and put them into a large soup-pot with five quarts of good brown gravy-stock ; and when they have boiled gently for half an hour, add to the soup three onions, as many carrots, and a turnip or tw^o, all sliced and fried carefully in butter; stew the whole softly till the peas are reduced to pulp, then add as much salt and cayenne as may be needed to season it well, give it two or three minutes’ boil, and pass it through a sieve, pressing the vegetables with it. Put into a clean saucepan as much as may be required for table, add a little fresh stock to it should it be too thick, and reduce it by quick boiling if too thin; throw in the white part of some fresh celery sliced a quarter of an inch thick, and when this is tender send the soup quickly to table with a dish of small fried sippets. A dessertspoonful or more of currie-pow'der greatly improves peas soup : it should be smoothly mixed with a few spoonsful of it, and poured to the remainder when this first begins to boil after having been strained. Split peas, 1 quart: soaked one night. Good brown gravy-soup, 5 quarts: 30 minutes. Onions and carrots browned in butter, 3 of each ; turnips, 2 : two and a half to three and a half hours. Cayenne and salt as needed. Soup, 5 pints; celery sliced, 1 large or 2 small heads : 20 minutes.[CHAP. I. 52 MODERN COOKERY. Obs.—When more convenient, six pounds of neck of beef well scored and equally but carefully browned, may be boiled gently with the peas and fried vegetables in a gallon of water (which should be poured to them boiling) for four or five hours. COMMON PEAS SOUP. Wash well a quart of good split peas, and float off such as remain on the surface of the water; soak them for one night, and boil them with a bit of soda the size of a filbert in just sufficient water to allow them to break to a mash. Put them into from three to four quarts of good beef broth, and stew them in it gently for an hour; then work the whole through a sieve, heat afresh as much as may be required for table, season it with salt and cayenne or common pepper, clear it perfectly from scum, and send it to table with fried or toasted bread. Celery sliced and stewed in it as directed for the rich peas soup, will be found a great improvement to this. Peas, 1 quart : soaked one night; boiled in 2 quarts or rather more of water, two hours to two and a half. Beef broth, 3 to 4 quarts : 1 hour. Salt and cayenne or pepper as needed : 3 minutes. PEAS SOUP WITHOUT MEAT. To a pint of peas, freed from all that are worm-eaten, and well washed, put five pints of cold water, and boil them tolerably tender; then add a couple of onions, (more or less according to the taste), a couple of fine carrots grated, one large or two moderate-sized turnips sliced, all gently fried brown in butter ; half a teaspoon- ful of black pepper, and three times as much of salt. Stew these softly, keeping them often stirred, until the vegetables are sufficiently tender to press through a sieve; then rub the whole through one, put it into a clean pan, and when it boils throw in a sliced head of celery, heighten the seasoning if needful, and in twenty minutes serve the soup as hot as possible, with a dish of fried or toasted bread cut into dice. A little Chili53 CHAP. I.] SOUPS. vinegar can be added when liked : a larger proportion of vegetables also may be boiled down with the peas at pleasure. Weak broth, or the liquor in which a joint has been boiled, can, when at hand, be substituted for the water, but the soup is very palatable as we have given the receipt for it. Some persons like it flavoured with a little mushroom catsup. Split peas, 1 pint; water, 5 pints : 2 hours or more. Onions, 2 ; carrots, 2; large turnip, 1 ; pepper, half teaspoonful; salt, 1 teaspoonful and a half: 1 hour to lij. Celery, 1 head : 20 minutes. OX-TAIL SOUP. An inexpensive and very nutritious soup may be made of ox-tails, but it will be insipid in flavour with- out the addition of a little ham, knuckle of bacon, or a pound or two of other meat. Yfash and soak three tails, pour on them a gallon of cold water, let them be brought gradually to boil, throw in an ounce and a half of salt, and clear off the scum carefully as soon as it forms upon the surface ; when it ceases to rise, add four moderate-sized carrots, from two to four onions, according to the taste, a large faggot of savoury herbs, a head of celery, a couple of turnips, six or eight cloves^ and a half-teaspoonful of pepper-corns. Stew thesu gently from three hours to three and a half, if the tails be very large; lift them out, strain the liquor, and skim off all the fat; cut the meat from the tails (or serve them, if preferred, divided into joints), and put it into a couple of quarts or rather more of the stock ; stir in, when these begin to boil, a thickening of arrow root or of rice-flour, (see page 4) mixed with as much cayenne and salt as may be required to flavour the soup well, and serve it very hot. If stewed down until the flesh falls away from the bones, the ox-tails will make stock which will be quite a firm jelly when cold; and this, strained, thickened, and well flavoured with spices, catsup, or a little wine, would, to many tastes, be a superior soup to the above.

For a richer soup, 5 to 6 hours. (Ham or gammon of bacon at pleasure, with other flavour- ings.) Obs.—To increase the savour of this soup when the meat is not served in it, the onions, turnips, and carrots may be gently fried until of a fine light brown, before they are added to it. A CHEAP AND GOOD STEW SOUP. Put from four to five pounds of the gristly part of the shin of beef into three quarts of cold water, and stew it very softly indeed, with the addition of the salt and vegetables directed for bouillon (see page 7), until the whole is very tender; lift out the meat, strain the liquor, put it into a large clean saucepan, add a thicken- ing of rice-flour or arrow-root, pepper and salt if needed, and a tabiespoonful of mushroom catsup. In the mean time, cut all the meat into small, thick slices, add it to the soup and serve it as soon as it is very hot. The thickening and catsup may be omitted, and all the vegetables, pressed through a strainer, may be stirred into the soup instead, before the meat is put back into it. SOUP IN HASTE. Chop tolerably fine a pound of lean beef, mutton, or veal, and when it is partly done, add to it a small carrot and one small turnip, cut in slices, half an ounce of celery, the white part of a moderate-sized leek, or a quarter-ounce of onion. Mince all these together and put the whole into a deep saucepan with three pints of cold water. When the soup boils take off the scum, and add a little salt and pepper. In half an hour it will be ready to serve with or without straining : it55 SOUPS. CHAP. I.] may be flavoured at will, with cayenne, catsup, or aught else that is preferred. It may be converted into French spring-broth, by passing it through a sieve, and boiling it again for five or six minutes with a handful of young and nicely-picked sorrel. Meat, 1 pound; carrot, 2 ozs.; turnip, 1 ounce and a half; celery, J oz.; onion, ^ oz.; water, 3 pints : half an hour. Little pepper and salt. Obs.—Three pounds of beef or mutton, with two or three slices of ham, and vegetables in proportion to the above receipt, all chopped fine, and boiled in three quarts of water for an hour and a half, will make an excellent family soup on an emergency: additional boiling will of course improve it, and a little spice should be added after it has been skimmed, and salted. It may easily be converted into carrot, turnip, or ground- rice soup after it is strained. VEAL OR MUTTON BROTH. To each pound of meat add a quart of cold water, bring it gently to boil, skim it very clean, add salt in the same proportion as for bouillon (see page 7), with spices and vegetables also, unless unflavourecl broth be required, when a few peppercorns, a blade or two of mace, and a bunch of savoury herbs will be sufficient; though for some purposes even these, with the exception of the salt, are better omitted. Simmer the broth for about four hours unless the quantity be very small, when from two and a half, to three, will he sufficient. A little rice boiled down with the meat will both thicken the broth, and render it more nutritious. Strain it off wdien done, and let it stand till quite cold that the fat may be entirely cleared from it: this is espe- cially needful when it;is to be served to an invalid.

Throw into five pints of boiling milk a small quantity of salt, and then drop lightly into it five ounces of good fresh vermicelli; keep the milk stirred as this is added, to prevent its gathering into lumps, and continue to stir it very frequently from fifteen to twenty minutes, or until it is perfectly tender. The addition of a little pounded sugar and powdered cinnamon, renders this a very agreeable dish. In catholie countries milk soups of various kinds constantly supply the place of those made with meat,. on maigre days; and with u§ they are sometimes very acceptable, as giving a change of diet for the nursery or sick room. Rice, semoulina, sago, cocoa-nut, and maccaroni may all in turn be used for them as directed for other soups in this chapter, but they will be required in rather smaller proportions with the milk.

When all these marks are reversed, and the eyes are sunken, the gills very dark in hue, the fish itself flabby, and of offensive odour, it is bad, and should be avoided. The chloride of soda will, it is true, restore it to a tolerably eatable state,* if it be not very much over-kept, but it will Small Fish Kettle, never resemble in quality fish that called a Mackerel is fresh from the water. Kettle. A good turbot is thick, and full-fleshed, and the underside is of a pale cream-colour or yellowish white ; w'hen this is of a bluish tint, and the fish thin and soft, it should be rejected. The same observations apply equally to soles. The best salmon and codfish are known by a small head, very thick shoulders, and a small tail; the scales of the former should be bright, and its flesh of a fine red colour : to be eaten in perfection it should be dressed as soon as it is caught, before the curd (or white sub- stance which lies between the flakes of flesh) has melted and rendered the fish oily. In that state it is really crimp, but continues so only for a very few hours; and it bears therefore a much higher price in the London market then, than when mellowed by having been kept a day or two. The flesh of cod-fish should be white and clear before it is boiled, whiter still after it is boiled, and firm though tender, sweet and mild in flavour, and sepa- rated easily into large flakes. Many persons consider it rather improved than otherwise by having a little salt rubbed along the inside of the back-bone and letting it * We have known this applied very successfully to salmon which from some hours keeping in sultry weather had acquired a slight degree of taint, of which no trace remained after it was dressed.[CHAP. H. MODERN COOKERY. 58 lie from twenty-four to forty-eight hours before it is dressed. It is sometimes served crimp like salmon, and must then be sliced as soon as it is dead, or within the shortest possible time afterwards. Herrings, mackerel, and whitings, loose their freshness so rapidly, that unless newly caught they are quite uneatable. The herring may, it is said, be deprived of the strong rank smell which it emits when broiled or fried, by stripping off the skin, under which lies the oil that causes the disagreeable odour. The whiting is a peculiarly pure-flavoured and delicate Ash, and accept- able generally to invalids from being very light of digestion. Eels should be alive and brisk in movement when they are purchased, but the 44 horrid barbarity” as it is truly designated, of skinning and dividing them while they are so, is without excuse, as they are easily destroyed 44 by piercing the spinal marrow close to the back part of the skull with a sharp pointed knife, or skewTer. If this be done in the right place all motion will instantly cease.” We quote Doctor Kitchener’s assertion on this subject; but we know that the mode of destruction which he recommends is commonly practised by the London fishmongers. Boiling water also will immediately cause vitality to cease, and is perhaps the more humane and ready method of destroy- ing the fish. Lobsters, prawns, and shrimps are very stiff when freshly-boiled, and the tails turn strongly inwards; when these relax, and the fish are soft and watery, they are stale; and the smell will detect their being so instantly even if no other symptoms of it be remarked. If bought alive, lobsters should be chosen by their weight and 44 liveliness. ” The hen-lobster is preferred for sauce and soups, on account of the coral; but the flesh of the male is generally considered of finer flavour for eating. The vivacity of their leaps will show when prawns and shrimps are fresh from the sea. Oysters should close forcibly on the knife when theyCHAP. II.] FISH. 59 are opened : if the shells are apart ever' so little they are losing their condition, andr when they remain far open, the fish are dead, and fit only to be thrown away. Small plump natives are very preferable to the larger and coarser kinds. TO CLEAN FISH. Let this be done always with the most scrupulous nicety, for nothing can more effectually destroy the appetite, or disgrace the cook than fish sent to table imperfectly cleaned. Handle it lightly, and never throw it roughly about, so as to bruise it; wash it well, but do not leave it longer in the water than is necessary, for fish, like meat, loses its flavour from being soaked. When the scales are to be removed, lay the fish flat upon its side, and hold it firmly with the left hand, while they are scraped off with the right; turn it, and when both sides are done, pour or pump sufficient water over to float off all the loose scales; then proceed to open and empty it. Be sure that not the slightest particle of offensive matter be left in the inside; wash out the blood entirely, and scrape or brush it away, if needful, from the back-bone. This may easily be accomplished, without opening the fish so much as to render it unsightly when it is sent to table. The red mullet is dressed without being emptied, and smelts are drawn at the gills. When the scales are left on, the outside of the fish should be wTell washed and wiped with a coarse cloth, drawn gently from the head to the tail. Eels, to be wdiolesome, should be skinned, but they are sometimes dressed without; boiling water should then be poured upon them, and they should be left in it from five to ten minutes, before they are cut up. The dark skin of the sole must be stripped off when it is fried, but it must be left on, like that of a turbot, when the fish is boiled, and it should be dished with the •white side upwards. Whitings are skinned, and dipped usually into egg and bread crumbs, when they are to be fried ; but for boiling or broiling, the skin must be left on.[CHAP. II. MODERN COOKERY. 60 TO SWEETEN TAINTED FISH. The application of the pyroligneous acid will effect this when the taint is but slight. A wineglassful, mixed with two of water, may be poured over the fish, and rubbed upon the parts more particularly requiring it; it must then be left for some minutes untouched, and afterwards washed in several waters, and soaked until the smell of the acid is no longer perceptible. The chloride of soda,* from its powerful anti-putrescent properties, will have more effect when the fish is in a worse state. It should be applied in the same manner, and will not at all injure the flavour of the fish, which is not fit for food when it cannot be perfectly purified by either of these means. The chloride may be diluted more or less, as occasion may require. BRINE FOR BOILING FISH. Fish is exceedingly insipid if sufficient salt be not mixed with the water in which it is boiled, but the precise quantity required for it will depend, in some measure, upon the kind of salt which is used. Fine common salt is that for which our directions are given; but when the Maldon salt, which is very superior in strength, as well as in its other qualities, is substituted for it, a smaller quantity must be allowed. About four ounces to the gallon of water will be sufficient for small fish in general; an additional ounce, or rather more, will not be too much for cod fish, lobsters, crabs, praw ns and shrimps; and salmon will require eight ounces, as the brine for this fish should be strong: the water should alwaj^s be perfectly well skimmed from the moment the scum begins to form upon the surface. Mackerel, whiting, and other small fish, 4 ozs. of salt * The reader will be sure to obtain the best preparation of the chloride of soda, by ordering Beaufoy's, which, with the directions for its use, may be procured a t any Druggist’s, in sealed q uartbottles, at three and sixpence each. It is better adapted to delicate pur- poses than the chloride of lime. We would also recommend the use of Beaufoy’s pyroligneous acid.61 FISH. CHAP. II.] to a gallon of water. Cod-fish, lobsters, crabs, prawns, shrimps, 5 to 6 ozs. Salmon, 8 ozs. TO RENDER BOILED FISH FIRM. Put a small bit of saltpetre with the salt into the water in which it is boiled ; a quarter-ounce will be sufficient for a gallon. TO KEEP FISH HOT FOR TABLE. Never leave it in the water after it is done ; but if it cannot be sent to table as soon as it is ready to serve, lift it out, lay the fish-plate into a large and very hot dish, and set it across the fish-kettle ; just dip a clean cloth into the boiling water, and spread it upon the fish; place a tin cover over it, and let it remain so until two or three minutes before it is wanted, then remove the cloth, and put the fish back into the kettle for an instant that it may be as hot as possible; drain, dish, and serve it immediately: the water should be kept boiling the whole time. TO BOIL A TURBOT. A fine turbot, in full season, and well-served, is one of the most delicate and delicious fish that can be sent to table; but it is generally an expensive dish, and its excellence so much depends on the manner in which it is dressed, that great care should be taken to prepare it properly. After it is emptied, wash the inside until it is perfectly cleansed, and rub lightly a little fine salt over the outside, as this will render less washing and handling necessary, by at once taking oft' the slime; change the water several times, and when the fish is as clean as it is possible to render it, draw a sharp knife through the thickest part of the middle of the back nearly through to the bone. Never cut off the Jins of a turbot when preparing it for table, and remember that it is the dark side of the fish in which the incision is to be made, to prevent the skin of the white side from crack- ing. Dissolve in a well cleaned turbot, or common fish-[CHAP. II. MODERN COOKERY. 62 kettle, in as much cold spring water as will cover the fish abundantly, salt, in the proportion of four ounces to the gallon, and a morsel of saltpetre; wipe the fish-plate with a clean cloth, lay the turbot upon it with the white side upwards, place it in the kettle, bring it slowly to boil, and clear off the scum thoroughly as it rises. Let the water only just simmer until the fish is done, then lift it out, drain, and slide it gently on to a very hot dish, with a hot napkin neatly arranged over the drainer. Send it immediately to table with rich lobster sauce, good plain melted butter, and a dish of dressed cucumber. Lor a simple dinner, anchovy, or shrimp-sauce is sometimes served with a small turbot. Should there be any cracks in the skin of the fish, branches of curled parsley may be laid lightly over them, or part of the inside coral of the lobster, rubbed through a fine hair-sieve, may be sprinkled over the fish ; but it is better without either, when it is very white, and unbroken. When garnishings are in favour, a slice of lemon and a tuft of curled parsley, may be placed alternately round the edge of the dish. A border of fried smelts, or of fillets of soles, was formerly served, in general, round a turbot, and is always a very admissible addition, though no longer so fashionable as it was. From fifteen to twenty minutes will boil a moderate sized fish, and from twenty to thirty a large one; but as the same time will not always be sufficient for a fish of the same weight, the cook must watch it attentively, and lift it out as soon as its appearance denotes its being done. Moderate sized turbot, 15 to 20 minutes. Large, 20 to 30 minutes. Longer, if of unusual size. Ohs.—A lemon gently squeezed, and rubbed over the fish, is thought to preserve its whiteness. Some good cooks still put turbot into boiling water, and to prevent its breaking, tie it with a cloth tightly to the fish-plate ; but cold water seems better adapted to it, as it is desirable that it should be gradually heated through before it begins to boil.CHAP. II.] 63 PISH. TURBOT A LA CREME. Raise carefully from the bones the flesh of a cold turbot, and clear it from the dark skin, cut it into small squares, and put it into an exceedingly clean stewpan or saucepan; then make and pour upon it the cream- sauce of Chapter IV., or make as much as may be required for the fish by the same receipt, with equal proportions of milk and cream, and a little additional flour. Heat the fish slowly in the sauce, but do not allow it to boil, and send it very hot to table. The white skin of the fish is not usually added to this dish, and it is of better appear- ance without it; but for a family dinner, it may be left on the flesh, when it is much liked. No acid must be stirred to the sauce until the whole is ready for table. TURBOT AU BECHAMEL; OR, IN BECHAMEL SAUCE. Prepare the cold turbot as for the preceding receipt, but leave no portion of the skin with it. Heat it in a rich bechamel sauce, and serve it in a vol-au-vent, or in a deep dish, with a border of fried bread cut in an elegant form, and made with one dark, and one light sippet, placed alternately. The surface may be covered with a half-inch layer of delicately fried bread crumbs, perfectly well drained and dried ; or they may be spread over the fish without being fried, then moistened with clarified butter, and browned with a salamander. TO BOIL A BRILL. Proceed exactly as for a turbot; sprinkle lobster coral passed through a fine sieve, over the brill after it is dished, and send lobster sauce and plain melted butter to table with it. This fish, in delicacy and excellence, is little inferior to turbot. TO BOIL SALMON. To preserve the fine colour of this fish, and to set the curd when it i3 quite freshly caught, it is usual to put64) MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XI. it into boiling, instead of into cold water. Scale, empty, and wash ..it with the greatest nicety, and be especially careful to cleanse all the blood from the inside. Stir into the fish-kettle eight ounces of common salt to the gallon of water; let it boil quickly for a minute or two, take off all the scum, put in the salmon and boil it moderately fast, if it be small, but more gently should it be very thick; and assure yourself that it is quite sufficiently done before it is sent to table, for nothing can be more distasteful, even to the eye, than fish which is under dressed. From two to three pounds of the thick part of a fine salmon will require half an hour to boil it; but eight or ten pounds will be done enough in little more than double that time; less, in proportion to its weight, should be allowed for a small fish, or for the thin end of a large one. Do not allow the salmon to remain in the water after it is ready to serve, or both its flavour and appear- ance will be injured. Dish it on a hot napkin, and send dressed cucumber, and anchovy, shrimp, or lobster sauce, and a tureen of plain melted butter to table with it. To each gallon water, 8 ozs. salt. Salmon, 2 to 3 lbs. (thick) \ hour; 8 to 10 lbs., 1 hour and J; small, or thin fish, less time. CRIMPED SALMON. Cut in slices an inch and a half, or two inches thick, the body of a salmon quite newly caught; throw them, into strong salt and water as they are done, but do not let them soak in it; wash them well, lay them on a fish-plate, and put them into fast-boiling -water, salted, and well skimmed. In from ten to fifteen minutes they will be done. Dish them on a napkin, and send them very hot to table with lobster sauce, and plain melted butter; or with the caper fish-sauce of Chapter IY. The water should be salted as for salmon boiled in the ordinary way, and the scum should be cleared off* with great care after the fish is in. In boiling water, 10 to 15 minutes.FISH. CHAP. II.] 65 SALMON A LA ST. MARCEL. Separate some cold boiled salmon into flakes, and free them entirely from the skin ; break the bones, and boil them in a pint of water for half an hour. Strain off the liquor, put it into a clean saucepan and stir into it by degrees when it begins to boil quickly, two ounces of butter mixed with a large teaspoonful of flour, and when the whole has boiled for two or three minutes add a tablespoonful of essence of anchovies, one of good mushroom catsup, half as much lemon-juice or Chili vinegar, a half-saltspoonful of pounded mace, some cayenne, and a very little salt. Shell from half to a whole pint of shrimps, add them to the salmon, and heat the fish very slowly in the sauce by the side of the fire, but do not allow it to boil. When it is very hot, dish, and send it quickly to table. French cooks, when they re-dress fish or meats of any kind, prepare the flesh with great nicety, and then put it into a stewpan, and pour the sauce upon it; which is, we think, better than the more usual English mode of laying it into the boiling sauce. The cold salmon may also be re-heated in the cream sauce of Chapter IY. or in the Maitre dTIotel sauce which follows it; and will be found excel- lent with either. This receipt is for a moderate-sized dish. TO BOIL COD FISH. When this fish is large the head and shoulders are sufficient for a handsome dish, and they contain all the choicer portion of it, though not so much substantial eating, as the middle of the body, which, inconsequence, is generally preferred to them by the frugal housekeeper. Wash the fish, and cleanse the inside, and the back- bone in particular, with the most scrupulous care; lay it into the fish-kettle and cover it well witli cold water mixed with five ounces of salt to the gallon, and about a quarter ounce of saltpetre to the whole. Place it over a moderate fire, clear off the scum perfectly, and let the fish boil gently until it is done. Drain it well* * This should be done by setting the fish-plate across the kettle lor a minute or two. F66 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. II. and dish it carefully upon a very hot napkin with the liver and the roe as a garnish. To these are usually added tufts of lightly scraped horseradish round the edge. Serve well-made oyster sauce and plain melted butter with it; or anchovy sauce when oysters cannot be procured. The cream sauce of Chapter IY. is also an appropriate one for this fish. Moderate-sized 20 to SO minutes. Large § to f hour. SLICES OF COD FISH FRIED. Cut the middle or tail of the fish into ^slices nearly an inch thick, season them with salt and white pepper or cayenne, flour them well, and fry them of a clear equal brown on both sides; drain them on a sieve before the fire, and serve them on a well-heated napkin, with plenty of crisped parsley round them. Or : dip them into beaten egg, and then into fine crumbs mixed with a seasoning of salt and pepper (some cooks add one of minced herbs also), before they are fried. Send melted butter and anchovy sauce to table with them. 8 to 12 minutes. Obs.—This is a much better way of dressing the thin part of the fish than boiling it, and as it is generally cheap, it makes thus an economical, as well as a very good dish. STEWED COD. Put into boiling water, salted as usual, about three pounds of fresh cod-fish cut into slices an inch and a half thick, and boil them gently for five minutes; heat in a wide stewpan nearly a pint of veal-gravy or of very good broth, lay in the fish, and stew it for five minutes, then add four tablespoonsful of extremely fine bread-crumbs, and simmer it for three minutes longer. Stir well into the sauce a large teaspoonful of arrow root quite free from lumps, a fourth part as much of mace, something less of cayenne, and a tablespoonful of essence of anchovies, mixed with a glass of white wine and a dessertspoonful of lemon-juice. Boil the wholeFISH. 67 CHAP. II.] for a couple of minutes, lift out the fish carefully with a slice, pour the sauce over, and serve it quickly. Cod fish, 3 lbs. : boiled 5 minutes. Gravy, or strong broth, nearly 1 pint : 5 minutes. Bread crumbs, 4 tablespoonsful: 3 minutes. Arrow-root, 1 large tea- spoonful ; mace, J teaspoonful; less of cayenne; essence of anchovies, 1 tablespoonful; lemon-juice, 1 dessertspoonful; sherry or Madeira, 1 winegiassful : 2 minutes. Obs.—A dozen or two of oysters, bearded, and added with their strained liquor to this dish two or three minutes before it is served, will, to many tastes, vary it very agreeably. STEWED COD FISH, IN BROWN SAUCE. Slice the fish, take off the skin, flour it well, and fry it quickly a fine brown, lift it out and drain it on the back of a sieve, arrange it in a clean stew-pan, and pour in as much good brown gravy, boiling, as will nearly cover it; add from one to two glasses of port wine, or rather more of claret, a dessertspoonful of Chili vinegar, or the juice of half a lemon, and some cayenne, with as much salt as may be needed. Stew the fish very softly until it just begins to break, lift it carefully with a slice into a very hot dish, stir into the gravy an ounce and a half of butter, smoothly kneaded with a large teaspoon- ful of flour, and a little pounded mace, give the sauce a minute’s boil, pour it over the fish, and serve it imme- diately. The wine may be omitted, good shin of beef stock substituted for the gravy, and a teaspoonful of soy, one of essence of anchovies, and two tablespoonsful of Harvey’s sauce added to flavour it. TO BOIL SALT FISH. When very salt and dry, this must be long-soaked before it is boiled, but it is generally supplied by the fishmongers nearly or quite ready to dress. When it is not so, lay it for a night into a large quantity of cold water, then let it lie exposed to the air for some time, then again put it into water, and continue thus until it is well softened. Brush it very clean, wash it thoroughly,68 MODERN COOKERY. [YlIAP. II. and put it ■with abundance of cold water into the fish- kettle, place it near the fire and let it heat very slowly indeed. Keep it just on the point of simmering, without allowing it ever to boil (which would render it hard,) from three quarters of an hour to a full hour, according to its weight; should it be quite small and thin, less time will be sufficient for it; but by following these directions, the fish will be almost as good as if it were fresh. The scum should be cleared off with great care from the beginning. Egg sauce and boiled parsnips are the usual accompaniments to salt fish, which should be dished upon a hot napkin, and which is sometimes also thickly strewed with chopped eggs. SALT 1’ISH. (A la Mditre cl’Hotel.') Boil the fish by the foregoing receipt, or take the remains of that which has been served at table, flake it off clear from the bones, and strip away every morsel of the skin; then lay it into a very clean saucepan or stewpan, and pour upon it the sharp Maitre d'Hotel sauce of Chapter IY; or, dissolve gently two or three ounces of butter with four or five spoonsful of water, and a half-teaspoonful of flour; add some pepper or cayenne, very little salt, and a dessertspoonful or more of minced parsley. Heat the fish slowly quite through in either of these sauces, and toss or stir it until the whole is well mixed; if the second be used, add the juice of half a lemon, or a small quantity of Chili vinegar, just before it is taken from the fire. The fish thus prepared may be served in a deep dish, with a border of mashed parsnips or potatoes. TO BOIL COD’S SOUNDS. Should they be highly salted, soak them for a night, and on the following day, rub off entirely the discoloured skin; wash them well, lay them into plenty of cold milk and water, and boil them gently from thirty to forty minutes, or longer, should they not be quite tender.FISH. CHAF» II.] 60 as directed in Chapter IV. Clear off the scum as it rises with great care, or it will sink, and adhere to the sounds, of which the appearance will then be spoiled. Drain them well, dish them on a napkin, and send egg sauce and plain melted butter to table with them. TO FRY cod's SOUNDS IN BATTER. Boil them as directed above, until they are nearly done, then lift them out, lay them on to a drainer, and let them remain till they are cold ; cut them across in strips of an inch deep, curl them round, dip them into a good French or English batter, fry them of a fine pale brown, drain and dry them well, dish them on a hot napkin, and garnish them with crisped parsley. TO FRY SOLES. These, and all other fish, must be not only fresh, but quite free from moisture to fry well, particularly when they are dressed with bread crumbs, as these will not otherwise adhere to them. Empty, skin and wash the soles with great nicety from one to two hours before they are wanted for table; wipe them very dry; fold and press them gently in a soft clean cloth and leave them wrapped in it till it is time to fry them; then, cover them equally in every part, first with some beaten egg, and then with extremely fine dry crumbs of bread.* Melt in a large and perfectly clean frying pan, over a brisk and clear fire, as much good lard as will float the fish, (or substitute for this, when the expense is not objected to, fresh, pure-flavoured olive oil, which is far superior to any thing else for the purpose), and let it be sufficiently hot before they are Laid in to brown them quickly; for if this be neglected it will be * The crumbs should be of a stale loaf, finely grated and shaken through a cullender, then well dried in a very slack oven or at a distance from a clear fire, and allowed to become cold before they are used : they are still better when made of bread that has been rendered crisp quite through, and then beaten small,MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. II. 70 impossible to render them crisp or dry. When the fat ceases to bubble, throw in a small bit of bread, and if it takes a good colour immediately the soles may be put in without delay. An experienced cook will know, without this test, when it is at the proper point; but the learner will do better to avail herself of it until practice and observation shall have rendered it unneces- sary to her. Before the fish are laid into the pan, take them by the head and shake the loose crumbs from them. When they are firm, and of a fine amber-colour on one side, turn them with care, passing a slice under them and a fork through the heads, and brown them on the other. Lift them out, and either dry them well on a soft cloth before the fire, turning them often, or press them lightly in hot white blotting paper. Dish them on a drainer covered with a hot napkin and send them to table without delay with shrimp or anchovy sauce, and plain melted butter. Very small soles will be done in six minutes, and large ones in about ten. They may be floured and fried, without being egged and crumbed, but this is not a very usual mode of serving them. Small soles, 6 minutes ; large, about 10 minutes. TO BOIL SOLES. The flesh of a fine fresh sole, when boiled with care, is remarkably sweet and delicate : if very large it may be dressed and served as turbot, to which it will be found little inferior. Clean and wash it thoroughly, but do not skin it; cover it plentifully with cold wTater, throw in a handful of salt and a morsel of saltpetre, about half the size of a hazel nut. When the water boils skim it well, and let the fish simmer very softly from five to ten minutes. Soles of moderate size should be laid into warm water, and will be sufficiently done with five minutes’ simmering. Send shrimp, lobster or anchovy sauce and dressed cucumber to table with them. Yery large sole, 5 to 10 minutes; moderate sized, 4 to 6 minutes.FISH. 71 CHAP. II.] FILLETS OF SOLES. The word fillet, whether applied to fish, poultry, game or butcher’s meat, means simply the flesh of either (or of certain portions of it), raised clear from the bones in a handsome form, and divided or not, as the manner in which it is to be served may require. It is an elegant mode of dressing various kinds of fish, and even those which are not the most highly esteemed, afford an excellent dish when thus prepared. Soles to be filletted with advantage should be large; the flesh then may be divided down the middle of the back, next, separated from the fins, and with a very sharp knife raised clean from the bones.* When thus pre- pared, the fillets may be divided, trimmed into a good form, egged, covered with fine crumbs, fried in the usual way, and served with the same sauces as the whole fish; or each fillet may be rolled up in its entire length, fastened with a small fine skewer, then covered with egg and bread crumbs, and fried in sufficient lard to almost cover it. When the fish are not very large, they are sometimes boned without being parted in the middle, and each side is rolled from the "tail to the head, after being first spread with pounded shrimps mixed with a third of their volume of butter, a few bread crumbs, and a high seasoning of mace and cayenne; or with pounded lobster mixed with a large portion of the coral, and the same seasoning, and proportion of butter as the shrimps; then laid into a dish, with the ingre- dients directed as for the soles cm plat, well covered with crumbs of bread and clarified butter, and baked from twelve to sixteen minutes, or until the crumbs are coloured to a fine brown in a moderate oven. The fillets may likewise be cut into small strips or * A celebrated French cook gives the following instructions for raising these fillets: “Take them up bv running your knife first between the bones and the flesh, then between the skin and the fillet; by leaning pretty hard on the table they will come off very neatly.”72 • MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. II. squares of uniform size, lightly dredged with pepper or cayenne, salt and flour, and fried in butter over a brisk fire; then well drained, and sauced with a good bechamel, flavoured with a teaspoonful of minced parsley. BAKED SOLES. (Soles CIU ‘plat.') GOOD. Clarify three ounces of fresh butter, and pour it into the dish in which the fish are to be served; add to it a little salt, some cayenne, a teaspoonful of essence of anchovies, and from one to two glasses of sherry, or of any other dry white wine; lay in a couple of fine soles which have been well-cleaned and wiped very dry, strew over them a thick layer of fine bread-crumbs, moisten them with clarified butter, set the dish into a moderate oven, and bake the fish a quarter of an hour. A layer of shrimps placed between the soles is a great improve- ment ; and we would also recommend a little lemon- juice to be mixed with the sauce. Baked 15 minutes. Obs.—In France, three or four minced eschalots and a dessertspoonsful or more of finely chopped parsley are sprinkled under and over the fish ; grated nutmeg also is added to the seasoning. SOLES STEWED IN CREAM. Prepare some very fresh middling-sized soles with exceeding nicety, put them into boiling water slightly salted, and simmer them for two minutes only; lift them out, and let them drain; lay them into a wide stewpan with as much sweet rich cream as will nearly cover them, add a good seasoning of pounded mace, cayenne, and salt; stew the fish softly from six to ten minutes, or till the flesh parts readily from the bones; dish them, stir the juice of half a lemon to the sauce, pour it over the soles, and send them immediately to table. Some lemon-rind may be boiled in the cream, if approved ; and a small teaspoonful of arrow-root,CHAP. II.] FISH. 73 very smoothly mixed with a little milk, may be stirred to the sauce (should it require thickening), before the lemon-juice is added. Turbot and brill may also be dressed by this receipt, time, proportioned to their size, being, of course, allowed for them. Soles 3 or 4 : boiled in water 2 minutes. Cream, |- to whole pint; salt, mace, cayenne : fish stewed, 6 to 10 minutes. Juice of half a lemon. Obs. —In Cornwall the fish is laid at once into thick clotted cream, and stewed entirely in it; but this method gives to the sauce, which ought to be extremely delicate, a coarse fishy flavour which the previous boil in water prevents, At Penzance, mullet, after being scaled, are divided in the middle, just covered with cold water, and softly boiled, with the addition of branches of parsley, pepper, and salt, until the flesh of the back parts easily from the bone ; clotted cream, minced parsley, and lemon-juice are then added to the sauce, and the mullet are dished with the heads and tails laid even to the thick parts of the back, where the fish were cut asunder. Hake, too, is there divided at every joint (having previously been scaled), dipped into egg, then thickly covered with fine bread-crumbs mixed with plenty of minced parsley, and fried a fine brown. TO FRY WHITINGS. Clean, skin, and dry them thoroughly in a cloth, fasten their tails to their mouths, brush them equally* over with beaten eggs, and cover them with the finest bread-crumbs, mixed with a little flour; fry them a clear golden brown in plenty of boiling lard, drain and dry them well, dish them on a hot napkin and serve them with good melted butter, and the sauce-cruets, as with well-made shrimp or anchovy sauce. A small half-teaspoonful of salt should be beaten up with the eggs used in preparing the whitings: two will be suffi- cient for half a dozen fish. 5 to 8 minutes, according to their size.MODERN COOKERY. 74 [CHAP. II. FILLETS OF WHITINGS. Empty and wash thoroughly, but do not skin the fish. Take off the flesh on both sides close to the bones, passing the knife from the tail to the head; divide each side in two, trim the fillets into good shape; fold them in a cloth, that the moisture may be well absorbed from them; dip them into, or draw them through, some beaten egg, then dip them into fine crumbs mixed with a small portion of flour, and fry them a fine light brown, in lard or clarified butter; drain them well, press them in white blotting-paper, dish them one over the other in a circle, and send the usual sauce to table with them. The fillets may also be broiled after being dipped into eggs seasoned with salt and pepper, then into crumbs of bread, then next into clarified butter, and a second time into the bread-crumbs (or, to shorten the process, a portion of clarified butter may be mixed with the eggs at first), and served with good melted butter, or thickened veal-gravy, seasoned with cayenne, lemon-juice, and chopped parsley. . Five minutes will fry the fillets, even when very large : rather more time will be required to broil them. TO BOIL WHITINGS. (French Receipt.') Having scraped, cleaned, and wiped them, lay them on a fish-drainer, and put them into water at the point of boiling; throwr in a handful of salt, two bay leaves, and plenty of parsley picked, washed, and tied together; let the fish just simmer from five to ten minutes, and watch them closely that they may not be over-done. Serve parsley and butter with them, and use in making it the liquor in which the whitings have been boiled. Just simmered from 5 to 10 minutes. BAKED WHITINGS A LA FRANqAISE. Pour a little clarified butter into a deep dish, and strew it rather thickly with finely-minced mushrooms,75 CHAP. II.] FISH. mixed with a teaspoonful of parsley, and (when the fla- vour is liked, and considered appropriate) with an escha- lot or two, or the white part of a few green onions, also chopped very small. On these place the fish, after they have been scaled, emptied, thoroughly washed, and wiped dry; season them well with salt, and white pepper, or cayenne ; sprinkle more of the herbs upon them ; pour gently from one to two glasses of light white wine into the dish, cover the whitings with a thick layer of fine crumbs of bread, sprinkle these plentifully with clarified butter, and bake the fish from fifteen to twenty minutes. Send a cut lemon only to table with them. When the wine is not liked, a few spoonsful of pale veal gravy can be used instead; or a larger quantity of clarified butter, with a tablespoonful of water, a teaspoonful of lemon- piclde and of mushroom catsup, and a few drops of soy. 15 to 20 minutes. TO BOIL MACKEREL. Open the fish sufficiently to admit of the insides being perfectly cleansed, but not more than is necessary for this purpose; empty them with care, lay the roes apart, and wash both them and the mackerel delicately clean. It is customary now to lay these, and the greater number of other fish as well, into cold water when the}?: are to be boiled; formerly all were plunged at once into fast- boiling water. For such as are small and delicate, it should be warm, but not scalding; they should be brought gently to a soft boil, and simmered until they are done ; the scum should be cleared off as it rises, and the usual proportion of salt stirred into the water before the mackerel is put in. The roes are commonly replaced in the fish, but as they sometimes require more boiling than the mackerel themselves, it is better, when they are very large, to lay them upon the drainer by their sides. From fifteen to twenty minutes will generally be sufficient to boil a full-sized mackerel : some will be done in less time, but they must be watched, and lifted out as soon as the tails split, and eyes are starting.[[chap. II. 76 MODERN COOKERY. Dish them on a napkin, and send fennel or gooseberry sauce to table with them, and plain melted butter also. Small mackerel, 10 to 15 minutes; large, 15 to 20' minutes. TO BAKE MACKEREL. After they have been cleaned and well washed, wipe them very dry, fill the insides with the forcemeat, No. 1 of Chapter VI, sew them up, arrange them, with the roes, closely together in a coarse baking-dish, flour them lightly, strew a little fine salt over, and stick bits of butter upon them ; or pour some equally over them, after having just dissolved it in a small saucepan. Half an hour in a moderate oven will bake them. Oyster forcemeat is always appropriate for any kind of fish ■which is in season, while the oysters are so ; but the mackerel are commonly served, and are very good with that which- we have named. Lift them carefully into a hot disli after they are taken from the oven, and send melted butter, and the sauce cruets to table with them. J hour. Ohs.—The dish in which they are baked, should be buttered before they are laid in. FRIED MACKEREL. (Common French Receipt.} After the fish have been emptied and washed ex- tremely clean, cut ofr the heads and tails, split the bodies quite open, and take out the backbones ; wipe the mackerel very dry, dust fine salt, and pepper (or cayenne), over them, flour them well, fry them a fine brown in boiling lard, drain them thoroughly, and serve them with the following sauce:—Dissolve in a small saucepan an ounce and a half of butter smoothly mixed with a teaspoonful of flour, some salt, pepper, and cayenne, shake these over a gentle fire until they are lightly coloured, then add by slow degrees nearly half a pint of good broth, or gravy, and the juice of one largeI i FISH. CHAP. II.] lemon : boil the sauce for a couple of minutes, and serve it very hot. Or, instead of this, add a large teaspoonful of strong made-mustard, and a dessertspoonful of Chili vinegar, to some thick melted butter, and serve if with the fish. A spoonful of Harvey’s sauce, or of mushroom catsup can be mixed with this last, at pleasure. FILLETS OF MACKEREL. (Fried or Boiled.) Take of? the flesh quite whole on either side, from three fine mackerel, which have been opened and properly cleaned ; let it be entirely free from bone, dry it well in a doth, then divide each part in two, and dip them into the beaten yolks of a couple of eggs, seasoned with salt arid white pepper or cayenne; cover them equally with •hue dry crumbs of bread, and fry them like soles; or dip them into clarified butter, and then again into the crumbs, and broil them over a very clear fire of a fine brown. Dish them in a circle one over the other, and send them to table with the Maitre d’Hotel sauce of Chapter IV, or with the one which follows it. The French pour the sauce into the centre of the dish; but for broiled fillets this is not so well, we think, as, serving it in a tureen. The roes of the fish, after being well washed and soaked, may be dressed with them, or they may be made into patties. Minced parsley can be mixed with the bread- crumbs when it is liked. MACKEREL BROILED WHOLE. Empty, wash it clean, and dry it well; split the back open without removing the bone; or make an incision on either side of it the whole length of the fish; lay it on a hot gridiron over a moderate fire, loosen it gently, should it stick, and when it is equally done on both sides, turn the back towards the fire: about half ‘an hour will broil it. If a feather dipped in salad-oil or clarified butter, be passed over the skin, before the mackerel is laid on the gridiron, it will be less dry, andMODERN COOKERY. £chap. II. 78 less liable to stick: a yet better plan is, to wrap the fish in a well-buttered sheet of writing paper, which should be just twisted or tied at the ends. This we would especially recommend for whitings also, which are excellent, if nicely broiled, but require a quicker fire, and rather less time than the mackerel. The latter, if very large, will need a few additional minutes’ broiling. When the backbone parts easily from the flesh, it is ready for table: put a cold Maitre d’Hotel sauce into the back before it is served. 30 to 40 minutes. Yfhitings, 20 to 30. MACKEREL STEWED WITH WINE. ( Very good.) Work very smoothly together a large teaspoonful of flour with two ounces of butter, put them into a stew- pan, and stir or shake them round over the fire until the butter is dissolved; add a quarter-teaspoonful of mace, twice as much salt, and some cayenne; pour in by slow degrees three glasses of claret, and when the sauce boils, lay in a couple of fine mackerel, well cleaned, and wiped quite dry ; stew them very softly from fifteen to twenty minutes, and turn them when half done; lift them out, and dish them carefully ; stir a teaspoonful of made- mustard to the sauce, give it a boil, and pour it over the fish. When more convenient, substitute port-wine and a little lemon-juice, for the claret. Mackerel, 2; flour, 1 teaspoonful; butter, 2 ozs.; seasoning of salt, mace, and cayenne ; claret, 3 glassesful; made-mustard, 1 teaspoonful: 15 to 20 minutes.

Raise the flesh entire from the bones on either side of the mackerel, and divide it once if the fish be small, but cut the whole into six parts of equal size should they be large.

We can recommend the dish to our readers as a very excellent one. A garnish of fried sippets can be placed round the fish at will. A teaspoonful of made-mustard should be stirred to the sauce before it is poured over the fish. Mackerel, 2 ; butter, 2 ozs. ; flour, 4 teaspoonful; rind of ^ lemon; salt, cayenne, pounded mace : 2 minutes. Fish, 4 to 5 minutes. Port wine, 2 large glassesful; Harvey’s sauce, 1 tablespoonful; soy and lemon-juice each, 1 teaspoonful: 4, to 6 minutes. Mustard, 1 teaspoonful. Obs.—Trout may be dressed by this receipt. TO BOIL HADDOCKS. Scrape the outsides very clean, open the fish, empty them, wash the insides thoroughly, take out the gills, and lay the haddocks into warm water salted as for mackerel, with a very small bit of saltpetre to render them firm. Skim the water and simmer them from seven to ten minutes, according to their size. Send them very hot to table, with a tureen of melted butter, and one of anchovy sauce. 7 to 10 minutes. Obs.—In Scotland haddocks are skinned before they are boiled, and the heads are taken off, but we see no advantage in this mode of dressing-them. BAKED HADDOCKS. After they have been cleaned, dry them thoroughly,[[chap. II. MODERN COOKERY. 80 then bake them as directed in the common receipt for pike, or fill them with oyster-forcemeat, or with No. 1 of Chapter IV, if more convenient, and proceed as for baked mackerel. 20 to 30 minutes ; longer if very large. TO FRY HADDOCKS. Follow the directions given for fillets of whitings, or, should, a more simple method be preferred, clean and dry the fish well, cut off the heads and tails, take out the backbones, cut each fish in three, egg and crumb them, fry them in boiling lard a fine golden brown, and serve them, well drained and dried, with the same sauces as boiled haddocks. FRESH HERRINGS. (Harleigh Recent.) Scale and clean the fish with the utmost nicety, split them quite open, and wash the insides with particular care ; dry them well in a cloth, take off the heads and tails and remove the backbones ; rub the insides with pepper, salt, and a little pounded mace; stick small bits of butter on them and skewer two of the fish together as flat as possible, with the skin of both outside; flour, and broil or fry them of a fine brown, and serve them with melted butter mixed with a tea- spoonful or more of mustard, some salt and a little vinegar or lemon juice. To broil 20 to 25 minutes; to fry about 10 minutes. TO BOIL PLAICE OR FLOUNDERS. After having emptied and well cleaned the fish, make an incision in the back as directed for turbot; lay them into cold spring water ; add salt, and saltpetre in the same proportion as for cod fish, and let them just simmer for four or five minutes after the water first begins to boil, or longer, should their size require it, but guard against their being broken. Serve them with plain melted butter. 4 to 5 minutes; longer if needful.FISH. 81 CHAP. II.] TO FRY PLAICE OR FLOUNDERS Sprinkle them with salt, and let them lie for two or three hours before they are dressed. Wash and clean them thoroughly, wdpe them very dry, flour them well, and wipe them again with a clean cloth ; dip them into egg, and fine bread crumbs, and fry them in plenty of iarcl. If the fish be large, raise the flesh in hand- some fillets from the bones, and finish them as directed for fillets of soles. Obs.—Plaice is said to be rendered less watery by beating it gently with a paste-roller before it is cooked. It is very sweet and pleasant in flavour while it is in full season, which is only for three or four months of the year. i TO ROAST, BAKE, OR BROIL RED MULLET. First wash, and then dry the fish thoroughly in a cloth, but neither scale nor open it; wrap it closely in a sheet of thickly buttered paper, tie this securely at the ends, and over the mullet with packthread, and roast it in a Dutch oven, or broil it over a clear and gentle fire, or bake it irr a moderate oven: from twenty to thirty minutes will be sufficient generally to dress it in either way, if it be only of moderate size. For sauce, put into a little good melted butter the liquor that has flowed from the fish, a small dessertspoonful of essence of anchovies, some cayenne, a glass of port wine, or claret, and a little lemon-juice. Remove the packthread, and send the mullet to table in the paper case. This is the usual mode of serving it; but it is dished without the paper, for dinners of high taste. 20 to 30 minutes : more, if large. TO BOIL GREY MULLET. This fish varies so much in size and quality, that it is difficult to give exact directions for the time of cooking it. When quite young and small, it may be boiled by the receipt for whitings, haddocks, and other fish of GMODERN COOKERY. fcHAP. II. 82 about their size; but at its finest growth it must be laid into cold water, and managed like larger fish. We have ourselves partaken of one which was caught upon our eastern coast, that weighed ten pounds, of which the flesh was quite equal to that of salmon; but its weight was, wTe believe, an unusual one. Anchovy, or caper fish sauce, with melted butter, may be sent to table with grey mullet. TO FRY SMELTS. When quite fresh, these delicate little fish have a perfume resembling that of a cucumber. Draw them at the gills, as they must not be opened, wash and dry them thoroughly, dip them into beaten egg-yolk, and then into the finest bread crumbs, mixed with a small quantity of flour. Fry them of a clear golden brown, and serve them very crisp and dry, with good melted butter in a tureen. Ohs.—Smelts are sometimes dipped into batter and then fried; when this is done, we wrould recommend for them the French batter of Chapter IV. 3 to 4 minutes. BAKED SMELTS. Prepare them as for frying; pour some clarified butter into the dish in which they are to be sent to table, arrange them neatly in it, with the tails meeting in the centre; strew over them as much salt, mace, and cayenne, mixed, as will season them agreeably; cover them smoothly with a rather thick layer of very fine bread crumbs, moisten them equally with clarified butter poured through a small strainer, and bake the fish in a moderately quick oven, till the crumbs are of a fine light brown. A glass of sherry, a half-teaspoonful of essence of anchovies, and a dessertspoonful of lemon-juice, are sometimes poured into the dish before the smelts are laid in. About 10 minutes.83 CHAP. II.] FISH. TO DRESS WHITE BAIT. ( Greenwich Receipt.) This delicate little fish requires great care to dress it well. Do not touch it with the hands, but throw it from your dish or basket into a cloth, with three or four handsful of flour, and shake it well; then put it into a bait sieve, to separate it from the superfluous flour. Have ready a very deep frying-pan, nearly full of boiling fat, throw in the fish, which will be done in an instant: they must not be allowed to take any colour, for if browned, they are spoiled. Lift them out, and dish them upon a silver or earthenware drainer, without a napkin, piling them very high in the centre. Send them to table with a cut lemon, and slices of brown bread and butter on a plate. SHAD, TOURAINE FASHION. (.Alose a la mode de Touraine.') Empty and wash the fish with care, but do not open it more than is needful; fill it either with the force- meat^No. 1, or No. 2 of Chapter VI., and its own roe; then sew it up, or fasten it securely with very fine skewers, wrap it in a thickly buttered paper, and broil it gently for an hour over a charcoal fire. Serve it with caper sauce, or with Chili vinegar and melted butter. We are indebted for this receipt to a friend who has been long resident in Touraine, and at whose table the fish is constantly served, thus dressed, and is considered excellent. It is likewise often gently stewed in the light white wine of the country, and served covered with a rich bechamel. Many fish more common with us than the shad might be advantageously prepared in the same manner. The charcoal fire is not indispensable : any that is entirely free from smoke will answer. We would suggest as an improvement, that oyster forcemeat should be substituted for that which we have indicated. Broiled gently, 1 hour, more or less, according to its size.£chap. II. MODERN COOKERY. 84 STEWED TROUT. (Good Common Receipt.) Melt three ounces of butter in a broad stew-pan, or well tinned iron saucepan, stir to it a tablespoonful of flour, some mace, cayenne, and nutmeg; lay in the fish after it has been emptied, washed very clean, and wiped perfectly dry ; shake it in the pan, that it may not stick, and when lightly browned on both sides, pour in three quarters of a pint of good veal stock, add a small bunch of parsley, one bay leaf, a roll of lemon-peel, and a little salt: stew the fish very gently from half to three quarters of an hour, or more, should it be unusually fine. Dish the trout, skim the fat from the grayy, and pass it through a hot strainer over the fish, which should be served immediately. A little acid can be added to the sauce at pleasure, and a glass of wine when it is con- sidered an improvement. This receipt is for one large, or for two middling-sized fish. We can recommend it as a good one, from our own experience. Butter, 3 ozs.; flour, 1 tablespoonful; seasoning of mace, cayenne, and nutmeg ;ij trout, 1 large, or 2 moderate sized; veal stock, f pint; parsley, small faggot; 1 bay-leaf; roll of lemon-rind ; little salt: \ to £ hour. TO BOIL PIKE. Take out the gills, empty and clean the fish very thoroughly, and soak it for half an hour with a cup of vinegar thrown into as much water as will cover it well, should there be any danger of its having a muddy taste. Wipe the inside dry, and fill it with oyster forcemeat, or with common veal forcemeat, made either with butter or with suet (for which, see Chapter VI.); curl the fish round, and fasten it with the tail in the mouth, lay it on to the drainer, cover it well with cold water, throw in some salt as soon as it boils, skim it well, and boil the fish gently from half to a whole hour, according to its size." Some persons prefer the scales taken off the pike85 CIIAP. II.] FISH when it is prepared for this mode of dressing ; and many cooks still put the fish into boiling water, well salted and skimmed. Serve it with plain melted butter, the sauce- cruets, and a lemon ; or with Dutch, brown caper, or anchovy sauce. Moderate sized, \ hour ; large, 1 hour. Obs.—We must repeat that it is impossible to give for fish which varies so much in quality as wTell as in size, directions for the exact time which is required to cook it; a few minutes, more or less, must often be allowed ; and it should always be watched attentively, and lifted from the water as soon as it is done, TO BAKE PIKEo (Common Receipt.) Pour warm water over the outside of the fish, and wipe it very clean with a coarse cloth drawn from the head downwards, that the scales may not be disturbed; then wash it well in cold water, empty, and clean the inside with the greatest nicety, fill it either with the common forcemeat. No. 1, or with No. 4, of Chapter YI, sew it up, fasten the tail to the mouth, give it a slight dredging of flour, stick small bits of butter thickly over it, and bake it from half to three quarters of an hour, should it be of moderate size, and upwards of an hour, if it be large. Should there not be sufficient sauce with it in the dish, plain melted butter, and a lemon, or anchovy sauce may be sent to table with it. When more convenient, the forcemeat may be omitted, and a little fine salt and cayenne, with some bits of butter, put into the inside of the fish, which will then require rather less baking. A buttered paper should always be laid over it in the oven, should the outside appear likely to become too highly coloured, or too dry, before the fish is done; and it is better to wrap quite small pike in buttered paper at once, before they are sent to the oven. Moderate sized pike, SO to 45 minutes; large pike, 1 hour to 1J.[CHAP. II. 86 MODERN COOKERY. TO RAKE PIKE. {Superior Receipt.) Scale, and wash the fish, take out the gills, then open it just sufficiently to allow the inside to be emptied, and perfectly cleansed, but not more than is necessary for that purpose. Wipe it as dry as possible in every part, then hang it for an hour or two on a hook in a cool larder, or wrap it in a soft cloth. Fill the body with the forcemeat No. 1 or 3, or with the oyster forcemeat of Chapter YI.; sew it up very securely, curl it round, and fasten the tail into the mouth with a thin skewer, then dip it into the beaten yolks of two or more eggs, seasoned with nearly a half-teaspoonful of salt and a little pepper or cayenne; cover it equally with the finest breadcrumbs; dip it a second time into the egg and crumbs, then pour some clarified butter gently over it, through a small strainer, and send it to a well iieated oven for an hour and a quarter or more, should it be very large, but for less time if it be only of moderate size. As it is naturally a very dry fish, it should not be left in the oven after it is thoroughly done, but it should never be sent to table until it is so. The crumbs of bread are sometimes mixed with a sufficient quantity of minced parsley to give the surface of the fish a green hue. Send plain melted butter, and brown caper or Dutch sauce to table with it. TO BOIL PERCH. First wipe or wash off the slime, then scrape off the scales, which adhere rather tenaciously to this fish; empty, and clean the insides perfectly, take out the gills, cut off the fins, and lay the perch into equal parts of cold and of boiling wTater salted as for mackerel: from eight to ten minutes will boil them unless they are very large. Dish them on a napkin, garnish them with curled parsley, and serve melted butter with them or Mciitre d’Hotel sauce maigre. Very good French cooks put them at once into boil-FISH. 87 CHAP. II.] ing water, and keep them over a brisk fire for about fifteen minutes. They dress them also without taking off the scales or fins until they are ready to serve, when they strip the whole of the skin off carefully, and stick the red fins into the middle of the backs; the fish are then covered with the Steward’s sauce, thickened with eggs. In warm water, 8 to 10 minutes; in boiling, 12 * to 15. TO FRY PERCH OR TENCH. Scale, and clean them perfectly; dry them well, flour and fry them brown in boiling lard. Serve plenty of fried parsley round them. TO FRY EELS. First kill, then skin, empty, and wash them as clean as possible; cut them into four-inch lengths, and dry them well in a soft cloth. Season them with fine salt, and white pepper, or cayenne, flour them thickly, and fry them a fine brown in boiling lard; drain and dry them as directed for soles, and send them to table with plain melted butter and a lemon, or the sauce-cruets. Eels are sometimes dipped into batter, and then fried ; or into egg and fine breadcrumbs (mixed with minced parsley or not at pleasure), arid served with plenty of crisped parsley round, and on them. It is an improvement for these modes of dressing the fish to open them entirely and remove the bones: the smaller parts should be thrown into the pan a minute or two later than the thicker portions of the bodies or they will not be equally done. BOILED EELS. ('German Receipt.') Pare a fine lemon, and strip from it entirely the white inner rind, slice it, and remove the pips with care, pur it, with a blade of mace, a small half-teaspoonful of white pepper-corns, nearly twice as much of salt, and aMODERN COOKERY. 88 [CHAP. II. moderate-sized bmicli of parsley, into three pints of cold water, bring them gently to boil, and simmer them for twenty minutes; let them become quite cold, then put in three pounds of eels skinned, and cleaned with great nicety, and cut into lengths of three or four*inches; simmer them very softly from ten to fifteen minutes, lift them with a slice into a very hot dish, and serve them with a good Dutch sauce, or with parsley and butter acidulated with lemon-juice or with Chili vinegar. EELS. (Cornish Receipt.) Skin, empty, and wash as clean as possible, two or three fine eels, cut them into short lengths, and just cover them with cold water; add sufficient salt and cayenne to season them, and stew them very softly indeed from fifteen to twenty minutes, or longer should they require it. When they are nearly clone, strew over them a tablespoonful of minced parsley, thicken the sauce with a teaspoonful of flour mixed with a slice of butter, and add a quarter-pint or more of clotted cream. Give the whole a boil, lift the fish into a hot dish, and stir briskly the juice of half a lemon into the sauce; pour it upon the eels, and serve them immediately. Very sweet thick cream is, we think, preferable to clotted cream for this dish. The sauce should be of a good consistence, and a dessertspoonful of flour will be needed for a large dish of the stew, and from one and a half to two ounces of butter. The size of the fish must determine the precise quantity of liquid and of seasoning which they will require. By substituting pale veal-gravy for water, and thin strips of lemon-rind for the parsley, this may be con- verted into a white fricassee of eels : a flavouring of mace must then be added to it, and the beaten yolks of two or three eggs mixed with a couple of spoonsful of cream, must be stirred into the sauce before the lemon juice, but it must on no account be allowed to boil afterwards. Rich brown gravy and port wine highly89 FISH. CHAP. II.] spiced, with acid as above, will give another variety of stewed eels. For this dish the fish are sometimes fried before they are laid into the sauce. TO BOIL LOBSTERS. Choose them by the directions which we have already given at the commencement of this chapter; tie the claws together with twine, and throw them into plenty of fast-boiling salt and water, that life may be destroyed in an instant. A moderate sized lobster will be done in from, twenty to thirty minutes; a very large one in three quarters of an hour, or more. After the fish are lifted out, wipe them with a damp cloth, rub a morsel ! of cold butter over them, and wipe them again. Before j they are sent to table, the large claws should be taken off, and the shells cracked across the joints without dis- figuring them; the tail should be separated from the body and split quite through the middle; the whole neatly dished upon a napkin, and garnished with curled I parsley or not, at choice. A good remoulade, or any I other sauce of the kind that may be preferred, should be | sent to table with it ; or oil and Chili vinegar, when | better liked. To 1 gallon water 5 ozs. salt. Moderate sized lobster, 20 to 80 minutes. Large lobster, j hour or more. HOT CRAB. Pick out all the meat of a boiled crab, clear the shell from the head, and clean it well; cut the flesh small, season it highly with cayenne, add salt, nutmeg, and an ounce or two of butter cut small; stir these over the fire till they are very hot, then mix with them a spoonful of made-mustard, and the juice of half a lemon, or a spoon- ful or two of lemon-pickle, or vinegar. Put the meat of the crab back into the shell, cover it thickly with bread- crumbs, pour over a little clarified butter, and brown them with a salamander, or, in default of this, with a kitchen fire-shovel made red hot. Some cooks mix90 MODERN COOKERY. £cHAP. II. crumbs of bread with the fish, others season it with Chili vinegar, and add a morsel of veal jelly. Crabs are boiled like lobsters. TO BOIL CRAYFISH. Throw them into water salted as for lobsters, and wdien they have boiled a quarter of an hour, take them up, and drain them well. 15 minutes. TO BROIL PRAWNS. Let them have plenty of water salted as for shrimps, put them in when it is boiling' fast, clear off ail the scum as it rises, and in from six to eight minutes turn them into a cullender or sieve, and drain them well. Spread them on a large dish or on a soft cloth to cool, and when they are quite cold, dress them upon a very white napkin neatly arranged upon a saucer or small basin reversed in a dish. Garnish the base with curled parsley, and send the prawns to table. They should always be kept in a very cool place until they are served. 6 to 8 minutes. TO BOIL SHRIMPS. Pick out the large ones, and let the smaller be thrown back into the sea. Have ready-boiling plenty of water, add salt in the proportion of from five to six ounces to the gallon, take off the scum, put in the shrimps, and in four or five minutes they will be done. Pour them into a cullender to drain, then spread them on a soft cloth to cool; or, dish them directly on a napkin, and send them hot to table. 4 to 5 minutes. Obs.—Peady-dressed shrimps or prawns may be pre- served fit for eating at least twelve hours longer than they would otherwise keep, by throwing them for an instant into boiling salt and water when they first91 CHAP. II.] FISH. begin to lose their freshness, and then draining them as above. CROUTE AUX CREVETTES, OR SHRIMP-TOAST. Shell two quarts of fine fresh shrimps, bruise the heads, and boil them in a pint and a half of water for half an hour; then strain the liquor through a muslin, or very fine sieve. Set two ounces of butter over the fire in a saucepan, and when it begins to simmer, stir in a teaspoonful of flour, a quarter-spoonful of inace in powder, some cayenne, and a little grated nutmeg, and shake the whole often until the flour begins to brown ; then pour in by degrees the liquor in which the heads [ were stewed, and when the sauce boils, add the ; shrimps ; as soon as they are quite hot through, pour them into a toast made of the bottom crust of a loaf cut more than an inch thick, slightly hollowed in the inside, and fried in fresh butter a light brown. Yeal-broth is a good substitute for the liquor made of the heads, which has rather a peculiar flavour. A few drops of | essence of anchovy are considered by many persons an | improvement to it. A glass of sherry, and a little lemon-juice, are also sometimes added to the above : ! the beaten yolks of two or three eggs stirred in just as it is taken from the fire, will be found a good addition to it. SHRIMP-TOAST A LA REINE. Substitute three quarters of a pint of veal-gravy for the shrimp-liquor of the preceding receipt; boil in it for ten minutes the rind of a very small lemon cut ex- tremely thin, put the same proportion of butter, flour, and spice, as for the Croute aux Crevettes, but pour the gravy to them before the roux begins to brown. Have ready-boiling, a quarter-pint of rich cream, mix it with the other ingredients, put in the shrimps, add a squeeze of lemon-juice, stirring the sauce at the same time. Soak the crust before it is fried, in a little cold cream; or toast, and butter it, and then moisten it well with boiling cream.92 MODERN COOKERY. [[chap. II. Yeal-gravy, f pint; rind of small lemon : 10 minutes. Butter, 2 oz. ; flour, 1 teaspoonful; mace, J spoonful ; little cayenne, and nutmeg: 5 to 7 minutes. Cream, i pint; shrimps, 2 quarts: 1 minute. Squeeze of lemon-juice. OYSTERS. The old-fashioned plan of feeding oysters with a sprinkling of oatmeal or flour, in addition to the salt and water to which they were committed, has long been rejected by all genuine amateurs of these nutritious and excellent fish, who consider the plumpness which the oysters are supposed to gain from the process but poor compensation for the flavour which they are sure to lose. To cleanse them when they first come up from the beds, and to keep them in good condition, they only require to be covered with cold water, mixed with salt (about seven ounces to the gallon); this should be changed every twelve hours. To preserve barrelled oysters, remove the first hoop of the barrel, that the top may be pressed down close to the fish, by means of a heavy weight placed upon it. Oysters should be eaten the instant they are opened. TO STEW OYSTERS. A pint of small plump oysters will be sufficient for quite a moderate-sized dish, but twice as many will be required for a large one. Let them be very carefully opened, and not mangled in the slightest degree; wash them free from grit in their own strained liquor, lay them into a very clean stewpan or well-tinned saucepan, strain the liquor a second time, pour it on them, and heat them slowly in it. When they are just beginning to simmer, lift them out with a slice or a bored wooden spoon, and take off the beards ; add to the liquor a quarter-pint of good cream, a seasoning of pounded mace and cayenne, and a little salt, and when it boils, stir in from one to two ounces of good butter, smoothly mixed with a large teaspoonful of flour; continue toPISH. CHAP. II.] 93 stir the sauce until these are perfectly blended with it, then put in the oysters, and let them remain by the side of the fire until they are very hot : they require so little cooking, that if kept for four or five minutes nearly simmering, they will be ready for table, and they are quickly hardened by being allowed to boil, or by too much stewing. Serve them garnished with pale fried sippets. Small plump oysters, 1 pint; their own liquor: brought slowly to the point of simmering. Cream, J pint; seasoning of pounded mace and cayenne ; salt as needed; butter, 1 to 2 ozs.; flour 1 large teaspoonful. Ohs.—A little lemon-juice should be stirred quickly i into the stew just as it is taken from the fire. Another mode of preparing this dish is to add the strained liquor ; of the oysters to about an equal quantity of rich bechamel, with a little additional thickening; then to heat them in it, after having prepared and plumped them properly. Or : the beards of the fish may be stewed I for half an hour in a little pale veal gravy, and this, j when strained and mixed wTith the oyster-liquor, may be brought to the consistency of cream with the French i ^thickening of Chapter YI. or, with flour and butter, then seasoned with spice as above: the process should be quite the same in all of these receipts, though the com- position of the sauce is varied. Essence of anchovies, cavice, Chili vinegar, or yolks of eggs can be added to the taste. TO SCALLOP OYSTERS. Large coarse oysters should never be dressed in this way. Select small plump ones for the purpose, let them be opened carefully, give them a scald in their own liquor, wash them in it free from grit, and beard them neatly. Butter the scallop shells and shake some fine bread crumbs over them; fill them with alternate layers of oysters, crumbs of bread, and fresh butter cut into small bits; pour in the oyster-liquor, after it has been strained, put a thick smooth layer of bread crumbsMODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. II. 94 on the top, moisten them with clarified butter, place the shells in a Dutch oven before a clear fire, and turn them often till the tops are equally and lightly browned : send them immediately to table. Some persons like a little white pepper or cayenne, and a flavouring of nutmeg added to the oysters; others prefer pounded mace. French cooks recommend with them a mixture of minced mushrooms stewed in butter till quite tender, and sweet herbs finely chopped. The fish is sometimes laid into the shells after having been bearded only. SCALLOPED OYSTERS A LA HEINE. Plump and beard the oysters, after having rinced them well in their own strained liquor; add to this about an equal quantity of very rich white sauce, and thicken it, if needful, with a half-teaspoonful of flour, mixed with a small slice of butter, or with as much arrow-root only; put in the oysters, and keep them at the point of simmering for three or four minutes; lay them into the shells, and cover the tops thickly with crumbs fried a delicate brown and well dried ; or heap over them instead, a layer of fine crumbs ; pour clarified butter on it, and brown it with a salamander. OYSTER SAUSAGES. Beard, rince well in their strained liquor, and mince, but not finely, three dozens and a half of plump native oysters, and mix them with ten ounces of fine bread- crumbs, and ten of beef suet chopped extremely small; add a saltspoonful of salt, and one of pepper, or less than half the quantity of cayenne, twice as much pounded mace, and the third of a small nutmeg grated ; moisten the whole with two unbeaten eggs, or with the yolks only of three, and a dessertspoonful of the whites. When these ingredients have been well worked together, and are perfectly blended, set the mixture in a cool place for two or three hours before it is used ; make it into the form of small sausages or sausage-cakes, flour and95 FISH. CHAP. II.] fry them in butter of a fine light brown; or throw them into boiling water for three minutes, drain, and let them become cold, dip them into egg and bread crumbs, and broil them gently till they are lightly coloured. A small bit should be cooked and tasted before the whole is put aside, that the seasoning may be heightened if required. The sausages thus made are very good. Small plump oysters, 3 dozens and j; bread crumbs, 10 ozs. ; beef-suet, 10 ozs.; seasoning of salt, cayenne, pounded mace, and nutmeg ; 2 unbeaten eggs, or yolks of 3. Obs.—The fingers should be well floured for making up these sausages. TO FRY OYSTERS. They should be large for this purpose. Simmer them for a couple of minutes in their own liquor, beard and dry them in a cloth, dredge them lightly with flour, dip them in egg and fine bread-crumbs, and fry them a delicate brown in boiling lard ; or make a thick batter with eggs and flour, season it with plenty of mace, and white pepper, dip the oysters in and then fry them. RED HERRINGS, A LA DAUPHIN. Take off the heads, open the backs of the fish, and remove the back-bone; soak the herrings, should they be very dry, for two or three hours in warm milk and water, drain and wipe them. Dissolve a large slice of fresh butter, and mix it with the beaten yolks of a couple of eggs, and some savoury herbs minced small; dip the fish into these, and spread them thickly with fine bread crumbs; broil them of a clear brown, over a moderate fire, and serve them on hot buttered toasts, sprinkled with a little cayenne. RED HERRINGS, COMMON ENGLISH MODE. This fish is rendered infinitely more delicate by pouring boiling water on it, before it is dressed, andMODERN COOKERY. 96 Qchap. III. leaving it to soak for half an hour, or more, should it be highly dried. The fresh Yarmouth bloaters do not require this. Cut off the heads and tails, open the herrings at the back, and warm them through before the tire, or upon the gridiron. They may be rubbed with a bit of cold butter, and seasoned with a slight sprinkling of pepper, or cayenne, when these are liked, or served quite plain. ANCHOVIES FRIED IN BATTER. Scrape very clean a dozen or more of fine anchovies, A*|and soak them in plenty of spring water from two to six hours : then wipe them dry, open them, and take out the back-bones, without dividing the fish. Season the insides highly with cayenne, close the anchovies, dip them into the French batter of Chapter YI, or into a light English batter, and fry them a pale amber-colour : in from four to five minutes they will be quite sufficiently done. CHAPTER III. GRAVIES. * INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. Gravies are not often required either in great variety, or in abun- dant quantities, when only a moderate table Gravy Kettle. is kept, and a clever cook will manage to supply, at a trifling cost, all that is generally needed for plain family dinners; while an unskilful or extravagant one will render them sources of unbounded expense.* But however small the propor- * We know an instance of a cook who stewed down two or three pounds of beef to make gravy for a single brace of partridges ; and who complained of the meanness of her employers (who were by- no means affluent), because this was objected to.CHAP. III.] 97 GRAVIES. tions in which they are made, their quality should be particularly attended to, and they should be well adapted in flavour to the dishes they are to accom- pany. For some, a high degree of savour is desirable ; but for fricassees, and other preparations of delicate white meats, this should be avoided, and a soft, smooth sauce of refined flavour be used in preference to any of more piquant relish. Instead of frying the ingredients for brown gravies, which is usually done in common English kitchens, French cooks pour to them at first a small quantity of liquid, which is reduced by rapid boiling to what is technically called glaze; which means very strong, I thick jelly, of a high amber-colour, or of a deep red brown. This process requires great care, as the liquid must be almost entirely evaporated, and yet every precaution taken to prevent its burning. When the glaze has acquired the proper colour, boiling broth should be added in small portions, and well shaken round the stewpan to detach it entirely; the meat may then be stewed gently for three or four hours with a few mush- rooms, should they be at hand, a bunch of parsley, and some green onions, or with a Portugal onion instead. A thick slice or two of an unboiled ham, is an almost indispensable addition to rich soup or gravy; and to supply it in the most economical manner, a large, highly- cured one, or more, not over fatted, should be kept for the purpose, and cut as required. The bones of un- dressed meat will supply almost, or quite as good gravy stock as the meat itself, if well boiled down, particularly those of the loin, or neck of veal; and as the flesh of these may be dressed in many ways advantageously without them, the whole joint may be turned to excel- lent account by so dividing it. The necks of poultry, with the feet properly skinned, a few herbs, a morsel or two of ham or lean bacon, and such slight flavourings besides as the spice-box can supply, with a few drops of good mushroom catsup, will of themselves, if well managed, produce sufficient gravy H98 [CHAP. III. MODERN COOKERY. to serve with the birds from which they are taken ; and if not wanted for the purpose, they should always be stewed down, or thrown into the stock-pot, for which the shank-bones of legs of mutton, and all trimmings of meat should likewise be reserved. Excellent broth for the sick or for the needy, may also be made of them at little cost, when they are not required for other uses. To deepen the colour of gravies, the thick mushroom pressings of Chapter V., or a little soy (when its flavour is admissible), or cavice, or Harvey’s sauce, may be added to it; and for some dishes, a glass of claret, or of port wine. Vermicelli, or rasped cocoa-nut, lightly, and very gently browned in a small quantity of butter, will both thicken and enrich them, if about an ounce of either to the pint of gravy be stewed gently in it from half an hour to an hour, and then strained out. All the ingredients indicated at page 4, for giving consistency to soups, will answer equally for gravies, which should not, however, be too much thickened, particularly with the unwholesome mixture of flour and butter, so commonly used for the purpose. Arrow-root or rice-flour, or common flour gradually browned in a slow oven, are much better suited to a delicate stomach. No particle of fat should ever be perceptible upon them when they are sent to table; and when it cannot be removed by skimming, they should be allowed to become sufficiently cold for it to congeal, and be taken off at once without trouble. It may be cleared from such as have not been thickened, by passing them through a closely-woven cloth, which has previously been laid into, and well wrung from, some cold water. TO HEIGHTEN THE COLOUR AND THE FLAVOUR OF GRAVIES. This is best done by the directions given for making Espagnole. An ounce or two of the lean of unboiled ham, cut into dice and coloured slowly in a small stewpan, or smoothly tinned iron saucepan, with lessGRAVIES. CIIAP. III.] 99 than an ounce of butter, a blade of mace, two or three cloves, a bay-leaf, a few small sprigs of savoury herbs, and an eschalot or two, or about a teaspoonful of minced onion and a little young parsley root, when it can be had, will convert common shin of beef stock, or even strong broth, into an excellent gravy, if it be gradually added to them after they have stewed slowly for quite half an hour, and then boiled with them for twenty- minutes or more. The liquid should not be mixed with the other ingredients until the side of the stewpan is coloured of a reddish brown ; and should any thicken- ing be required, a teaspoonful of flour should be stirred in well, and simmered for three or four mihutes before the stock is added: the pan should be strongly shaken round afterwards to detach the browning from it, and this must be done often while the ham is stewing. Ohs.—The cook who is not acquainted with this mode of preparing or enriching gravies, will do well to make herself acquainted with it; as it presents no difficulties, and is exceedingly convenient and advan- tageous when they are wanted in small quantities, very highly flavoured and well coloured. An unboiled ham, kept in cut, will be found, as we have already said, a great economy for this, and .other purposes, saving much of the expense commonly incurred for gravy- meats. As eschalots, when sparingly used, impart a much finer savour than onions, though they are not commonly so much used in England, we would recom- mend that a small store of them should always be kept. SHIN OF BEEF STOCK. (For Gravies,) There is no better foundation for strong gravies than shin of beef stewed down to a jelly (which it easily becomes), with the addition only of some spice, a bunch of savoury herbs, and a moderate proportion of salt; this, if kept in a cool larder, boiled softly for two or three minutes every second or third day, and each time put into a clean, well-scalded pan, will remain good forMODERN COOKERY. £chap. III. 100 many days, and may easily be converted into excellent soup or gravy. Let the bone be broken in one or two places, take out the marrow, which, if not wanted for immediate use, should be clarified, and stored for future occasions; put a pint and a half of cold water to the pound of beef, and stew it very gently indeed for six or seven hours, or even longer should the meat not then be quite in fragments. The bones of calf’s feet which have been boiled down for jelly, the liquor in which the head has been cooked, and any remains of ham quite freed from the smoky parts, from rust, and fat, will be serviceable additions to this stock. A couple of pounds of the neck of beef may be added to six of the shin with very good effect; but for white soup or sauces this is better avoided. Shin of beef, 6 lbs.; water, 9 pints; salt, 1 oz.; large bunch^ savoury herbs ; pepper-corns, 1 teaspoon- ful; mace, 2 blades. RICH PALE YEAL GRAVY ; OR, CONSOMMEE. The French, who have always at hand their stock- pot of good bouillon (beef-soup, or broth), make great use of it in preparing their gravies. It is added instead of water to the fresh meat, and when this, in somewhat large proportions, is boiled down in it, with the addition only of a bunch of parsley and a few green onions, and a moderate seasoning of salt, a strong and very pure-flavoured pale gravy is produced. When the best joints of fowls, or of partridges have been taken for fricassees or cutlets, the remainder may be stewed with a pound or two of veal into a consommee, which then takes the name of chicken or of game-gravy. For a large dinner it is always desirable to have in readiness such stock as can easily and quickly be converted into white, and other sauces. To make this, arrange a slice or two of lean ham in a stewpan or saucepan with three pounds of the neck of veal once or twice divided (unless the thick fleshy part of the knuckle can be had), and pour to them three full pintsCHAP. III.] GRAVIES. 101 of strong beef, or veal broth; or if this cannot con- veniently be done, increase the proportion of meat or diminish that of the liquid, substituting water for the broth, throw in some salt after the boiling has com- menced, and the gravy has been well skimmed, with one mild onion, a bunch of savoury herbs, a little celery, if in season, a carrot, a blade of mace, and a half salt- spoonful of pepper-corns; stew these very gently for four hours; then, should the meat be quite in fragments, strain off the gravy, and let it become sufficiently cold to allow the fat to be entirely cleared from it. A handful of nicely prepared mushroom-buttons will much improve its flavour; and the bones of boiled calf’s feet, or the fresh ones of fowls will be found excellent additions to it. A better method of making it, when time and trouble are not regarded, is to heat the meat, which ought then to be free of bones, quite through, with from a quarter to half a pint of broth only, and when on probing it with the point of a knife no blood issues from it, and it has been turned and equally done, to moisten it with the remainder of the broth, which should be boiling. Lean of ham, 6 to 8 ozs.; neck or knuckle of veal, 3 lbs. ; strong broth, 3 pints, (or veal, 4 lbs., and water, 3 pints) ; salt; bunch of savoury herbs ; mild onion, 1; carrot, 1 large or 2 small; celery, ^ small head; mace, 1 large blade; pepper-corns, \ saltspoonful: 4 hours or more. Or: ham, \ lb.; veal, 4 lbs.; broth, third of pint: nearly 1 hour. Additional broth, 3 pints: 3£ hours, to 4J. RICH DEEP-COLOURED VEAL GRAVY. Lay into a large thick stewpan or saucepan, from half to three quarters of a pound of undressed ham, freed entirely from fat, and from the smoked edges, and sliced half an inch thick; on this place about four pounds of lean veal, cut from the best part of the knuckle or from the neck (part of the fillet, which in France is often used for it instead, not being generally102 [CHAP. III. MODERN COOKERY. purchasable here; the butchers seldom dividing the joint); pour to them about half a plot of good broth,* and place the pan over a brisk fire until it is well re- duced, then thrust a knife into the meat, and continue the stewing more gently until a glaze is formed as we have described at page 97. The latter part of the process must be very slow ; the stewpan must be fre- quently shaken, and the gravy closely watched that it may not burn; when it is of a fine deep amber colour, pour in sufficient boiling broth to cover the meat, add a bunch of parsley, and a few mushrooms and green onions. A blade or two of mace, a few wdiite pepper- corns, and a head of celery, would, we think, be very admissible additions to this gravy, but it is extremely good without. Half the quantity can be made, but it will be rather more troublesome to manage. Undressed ham, 8 to 12 ozs.; lean veal, 4 lbs.; broth, ^ pint: 1 to 2 hours. Broth, 3 to 4 pints; bunch of parsley and green onions, or 1 Portugal onion; mushrooms, J to ^ pint: 1 hour and j, to 2 hours. GOOD BEEF OR YEAL GRAYY. (English Receipt.') Flour and fry lightly in a bit of good butter a couple of pounds of either beef or veal; drain the meat well from the fat, and lay it into a small thick stewpan or iron saucepan; pour to it a quart of boiling water, add, after it has been well skimmed and salted, a large mild onion sliced, very delicately fried, and laid on a sieve to drain, a carrot also sliced, a small bunch of thyme and parsley, a blade of mace, and a few pepper-corns ; stew these gently for three hours or more, pass the gravy through a sieve into a clean pan, and when it is quite cold clear it entirely from fat, heat as much as is wanted for table, and if not sufficiently thick, stir into it from half * When there is no provision of this in the house, the quantity required may he made with a small quantity of beef, and the trimmings of the veal, by the directions for Bouillon, page 7.GRAVIES. 103 CHAP.

A RICH ENGLISH BROWN GRAVY. Brown lightly and carefully from four to six ounces of lean ham thickly sliced and cut into large dice; lift these out, and.put them into the pan in which the gravy is to be made ; next, fry lightly also, a couple of pounds of neck of beef, dredged moderately with flour, and slightly with pepper; put this when it is done over the ham ; and then brown gently, and add to them two or three eschalots, or a Portugal onion : should neither of these be at hand, one not large common onion must be used instead; pour over these ingredients a quart of boiling water, or of weak but wTell-flavoured broth, bring the whole slowly to a boil, clear off the scum with great care, throw in a saltspoonful of salt, four cloves, a blade of mace, twenty corns of pepper, a bunch of savoury herbs, a carrot, and a few slices of celery: these two last may be fried or not as is most convenient. Boil the gravy very softly until it is reduced to little more than a pint, strain, and set it by until the fat can be taken from it. Pleat it anew, add more salt if needed, and a little mushroom catsup, cayenne-vinegar, or whatever flavouring it may require for the dish with which it is to be sefved: it will seldom require any thickening. A dozen small mushrooms prepared as for pickling, or two or three morels, previously well washed and soaked, may be added to it at first with advantage. Half this quantity of gravy will be sufficient for a single tureen, and the economist can diminish a little the proportion of meat when it is thought too much. GRAVY FOR VENISON. If possible, let this be made with a little of the neck,10 4 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP.

Venison, 1J lb.; mutton broth, 1^ pint: 2 hours. . Obs.—When venison cannot be had, gravy must be made of lean mutton, thus:—Trim away the fat from some cutlets, and lay them into a stewpan; set them over a clear fire, and let them brown a little in their own gravy ; then add a pint of boiling water to each pound of meat. Takeoff the scum, throw in a little salt, and boil the gravy till reduced one half. Some cooks broil the cutlets lightly, boil the gravy one hour, and then reduce it after it is strained. We have known an eschalot or two ordered for this gravy occasionally, but it should only be added when it is especially desired. A RICH GRAVY FOR VENISON. There are few eaters to whom this would be accep- table, the generality of them preferring infinitely the fla- vour of the venison itself to any which the richest gravy made of other meats can afford ; but when the savour of a well-made Espagnole is likely to be relished, prepare it by the receipt of the following page, substituting plain strong mutton stock for the veal gravy.GRAVIES. CHAP. III.] 105 SWEET SAUCE, OR GRAVY FOR VENISON. Add to a quarter-pint of common venison gravy, a couple of glasses of port wine or claret, and half an ounce of sugar in lumps. Christopher North’s sauce, mixed with three times its measure of gravy, would be an excellent substitute for this. ESPAGNOLE (SPANISH SAUCE.) (.A highly flavoured gravy.) Dissolve a couple of ounces of good butter in a thick stewpan or saucepan, throw in from four to six sliced eschalots, four ounces of the lean of an undressed ham, three ounces of carrot, cut in small dice, one bay-leaf, two or three branches of parsley, and one or two of thyme, but these last must be small; three cloves, a blade of mace, and a dozen corns of pepper ; add part of a root of parsley, if it be at hand, and keep the whole stirred or shaken over a moderate fire for twenty minutes, then add by degrees one pint of very strong veal stock or gravy, and stew the whole gently from thirty to forty minutes; strain it, skim off the fat, and it will be ready to serve. Butter, 2 ozs. ; eschalots, 4 to 6 ; lean of undressed ham, 4 ozs.; carrots, 3 ozs. ; bay-leaf, 1 ; little thyme and parsley, in branches; cloves, 3 ; mace, 1 blade ; pepper-corns, 12; little parsley root: fried gently, 20 minutes.

Take the same proportion of ingredients as for the preceding Espagnole, with the addition, if they should be at hand, of a dozen small mushrooms, prepared as for stewing ; when these have fried gently in the stewpan until it appears of a reddish colour all round, stir in a tablespoonful of flour, and when it is lightly browned, add in small portions, letting each one boil up before the next is poured in, and shaking the pan well round, three106 MODERN COOKERY.

When the sauce has boiled gently for half an hour, add to it a small quantity of cayenne, and some salt, if this last be needed; then strain it, skim off the fat entirely, should any appear upon the surface, and serve it very hot. A smaller proportion of wine, added a few minutes before the sauce is ready for table, would perhaps better suit with English taste, as with longer boiling, its flavour passes off almost entirely. Either of these Espagnoles, poured over the well-bruised remains of pheasants, partridges, or moor-fowl, and boiled with them for an hour, will become a most admirable game gravy, and would generally be considered a superlative addition to other roast birds of their kind, as well as to the hash, or salmi, for which see Chapter XIII. Ingredients as in preceding receipt, with mushrooms, 1 2 to 18 ; Madeira, or good sherry, J to \ pint. JUS DES ROGNONS ; OR, KIDNEY-GRAVY. Strip the skin and take the fat from three fresh mutton kidneys, slice and flour them ; melt two ounces of butter in a deep saucepan, and put in the kidneys, with an onion cut small, and a teaspoonful of fine herbs stripped from the stalks. Keep these well shaken over a clear fire until nearly all the moisture is dried up ; then pour in a pint of boiling water, add half a tea- spoonful of salt, and a little cayenne or common pepper, and let the gravy boil gently for an hour and a half, or longer if it be not thick and rich. Strain it through a fine sieve, and take off the fat. Spice or catsup may be added at pleasure. Mutton kidneys 3; butter 2 ozs.; onion 1 ; fine herbs 1 teaspoonful : J hour.

Chop fine a few bits of lean meat, a small onion, a few slices of carrot and turnip, and a little thyme and parsley; put these with half an ounce of butter into a thick saucepan, and keep them stirred till they are slightly browned; add a little spice, and waiter in the proportion of a pint to a pound of meat; clear the gravy from scum, let it boil half an hour, then strain it for use. Meat, 1 lb.; 1 small onion ; little carrot, turnip, thyme, and parsley; butter ^ oz. ; cloves 6 ; corns of pepper 12 ; water 1 pint: hour. CHEAP GRAVY FOR A ROAST FOWL. When there is neither broth nor gravy to be had, nor meat of which either can be made, boil the neck of the fowd after having cut it small, in half a pint of water with any slight seasonings of spice or herbs, or with a little salt and pepper only ; it should stew very softly for an hour or more, or the quantity will be too much reduced. When the bird is just ready for table, take the gravy from the dripping-pan, and drain off the fat from it as closely as possible; strain the liquor from the neck to it, mixing them smoothly, pass the gravy again through the strainer, heat it, add salt and pepper or cayenne, if needed, and serve it extremely hot. When this is done, the fowl should be basted with good butter only, and well floured when it is first laid to the fire. Many cooks always mix the gravy from the pan when game is roasted with that which they send to table with it, as they think that this enriches the flavour; but it is not always considered an improvement by the eaters. Neck of fowl; water J pint; pepper, salt (little vegetable and spice at choice) : stewed gently, 1 hour; strained, stirred to the gravy of the roast, well cleared from fat.[[CHAP. III. MODERN COOKERY. 108 ANOTHER CHEAP GRAVY FOR A FOWL. A little good broth added to half a dozen dice of lean ham, lightly browned in a morsel of butter, with half a dozen corns of pepper and a small branch or two of parsley, and stewed for half an hour, will make excellent gravy of a common kind. When there is no broth, the neck of the chicken must be stewed down to supply its place. QUITE COMMON BROWN GRAVY. Cut a sheep's melt into slices half an inch thick, flour them lightly, and either fry them a pale brown, or dissolve a small slice of butter in a thick saucepan, lay them in and shake them over a moderate fire until they have taken sufficient colour; then pour gradually to them between half and three quarters of a pint of boiling water; add a not very full seasoning of salt and pepper, and stew the gravy very gently for upwards of an hour and a half. Strain, and skim off the fat, and it will be ready for table. When it is to accom- pany ducks or geese, brown a minced onion with the melt, and add a sprig of lemon thyme. This, though a very cheap, is a rich gravy in flavour; but it would be infinitely improved by using for it equal parts of neck of beef (or of beef steak) and sheep’s melt; or the bone and the lean only of a thick mutton cutlet. A little catsup, or a very small quantity of spice, will likewise be good additions to it; and a slice or two of a root of celery, and of a carrot, might be boiled down with the meat. A bit or two of lean ham will heighten greatly the flavour of all browrn gravies. 1 sheep’s melt; butter, \ to 1 oz.; parsley, 1 or 2 small branches : gently browned. Boiling water, \ to f pint; pepper, salt: 1 hour and \ or more. Slowly stewed. (Onion, carrot, celery, mushroom catsup, little spice, or bit or two of lean ham at choice.)

Obs. 2.—The best gravies possible, may be made with the bones of all uncooked meat except pork. GRAVY OR SAUCE FOR A GOOSE. Mince, and brown in a small saucepan, with a slice of butter, two ounces of mild onion. When it begins to brown, stir to it a teaspoonful of flour, and in five or six minutes afterwards, pour in by degrees the third of a pint of good brown gravy; let this simmer fifteen minutes; strain it; bring it again to the point of boiling, and add to it a teaspoonful of made-mustard mixed well with a glass of port wine. Season it with cayenne pepper, and salt, if this last be needed. Do not let the sauce boil after the wine is added, but serve it very hot. Onions, 2 ozs. ; butter, 1J oz.: 10 to 15 minutes. Flour, 1 teaspoonful: 5 to 6 minutes. Gravy, l pint : 15 minutes. Mustard, 1 teaspoonful; port wine, 1 glassful; cayenne pepper; salt. See also Christopher North’s own sauce. ORANGE GRAVY, FOR WILD FOWL. Boil for about ten minutes, in half a pint of rich and highly-flavoured brown gravy, or Espagnole, half the rind of a Seville orange, pared as thin as possible, and a small strip of lemon-rind, with a bit of sugar the size of a hazel-nut. Strain it off, add to it a quarter-pint of port or claret, the juice of half a lemon, and a tablespoonful of Seville orange-juice; season it with cayenne, and serve it as hot as possible.

HI- slowly down equal parts of shin of beef, and knuckle or neck of veal, with a pint of cold water to each pound of meat; but to give it flavour, some thick slices of lean unboiled ham should be added to it, two or three carrots, some spice, a bunch of parsley, one mild onion, or more, and a moderate quantity of salt; or part of the meat may be omitted, and a calf’s head, or the scalp of one, very advantageously substituted for it, though the flavouring must then be heightened, because, though very gelatinous, these are in themselves exceed- ingly insipid to the taste. If rapidly boiled, the jelly will not be clear, and it will be difficult to render it so without clarifying it wdth the wkites of eggs, which it ought never to require; if very gently stewed, on the contrary, it will only need to be passed through a fine sieve, or cloth. The fat must be carefully removed, after it is quite cold. The shin of beef recommended for this and other receipts, should be from the middle of the leg of young heifer beef, not of that which is large and coarse. Middle of small shin of beef, 3 lbs.; knuckle or neck of veal, 3 lbs.; lean of ham, J lb.; water, 3 quarts; carrots, 2 large, or three small; bunch of parsley ; 1 mild onion, stuck with eight cloves ; 2 small bay-leaves; 1 large blade of mace; small saltspoonful of pepper- corns ; salt, f oz. (more if needed) : 5 to 6 hours’ very gentle stewing. Ohs.—A finer jelly may be made by using a larger proportion of veal than of beef, and by adding clear beef or veal broth to it instead of water, in a small propor- tion at first, as directed in the receipt for consommee, see page 100, and by pouring in the remainder when the meat is heated through. The necks of poultry, any inferior joints of them omitted from a fricassee, or other dish, or an old fowl, will further improve it much; an eschalot or two may at choice be boiled down in it, instead of the onion, but the flavour should be scarcely perceptible.CHAP. III.] Ill GRAVIES. A CHEAPER MEAT JELLY. One calf’s foot, a pound and a half or two pounds of neck of veal or beef, a small onion, a carrot, a bunch of parsley, a little spice, a bit or two of quite lean ham, dressed or undressed, and five half pints of water boiled very slowly for five or six hours will give a strong, though not a highly flavoured jelly. More ham, any bones of unboiled meat, poultry, or game, will, in this respect, improve it; and the liquor in which fowls or veal have been boiled for table should, when at hand, be used for it instead of water. These jellies keep much better and longer when no vegetables are stewed down in them. GLAZE. This is merely strong, clear, gravy or jelly boiled quickly down to the consistency of thin cream; but this reduction must be carefully managed that the glaze may be brought to the proper point ^without being burned ; it must be attentively watched, and stirred without being quitted for a moment from the time of its beginning to thicken : when it has reached the proper degree of boiling it will jelly in dropping from the spoon, like preserve, and should then be poured out immediately, or it will burn. When wanted for use melt it gently by placing the vessel which contains if (see article Glazing, Chapter YII.,) in a pan of boil- ing water, and with a paste-brush lay it on to the meat; on which it will form a sort of clear varnish. In consequence of the very great reduction which it undergoes, salt should be added to it sparingly when it is made. Almost any kind of stock winch contains veal may be boiled down to glaze; but unless it be strong, a pint will afford but a spoonful or two; a small quantity of it however is generally sufficient, unless a large repast is to be served. Two or three layers must be given to each joint. The jellies which precede this will answer for it extremely well.[CHAP. III. 112 MODERN COOKERY. ASPIC, OR CLEAR SAVOURY-JELLY. Boil a couple of calf’s feet, with three or four pounds of knuckle of veal, three quarters of a pound of lean ham, two large onions, three whole carrots, and a large bunch of herbs, in a gallon of water till it is reduced more than half. Strain it off; when perfectly cold remove every particle of fat and sediment, and put the jelly into a very clean stewpan, with four whites of eggs well beaten; keep it stirred until it is nearly boiling; then place it by the side of the fire to simmer for a quarter of an hour. Let it settle, and pour it through a jelly bag till it is quite clear. Add, when it first begins to boil, three blades of mace, a teaspoonful of white pepper-corns, and sufficient salt to flavour it properly, allowing for the ham, and the reduction. French cooks flavour this jelly with tarragon vinegar when it is clarified: cold poultry, game, and fish are served in, or garnished with it; when it is to be moulded, with slices of boiled tongue laid in the middle in a chain, or carved fowl or aught else, it will be well to throw in a pinch of isinglass; and hams are often placed on a thick layer of it roughed, and then covered entirely with more for large breakfasts, or cold repasts. It is also used as gravy for meat-pies. Calf’s feet, 2 ; veal, 4 lbs.; ham, j lb.; onions, 2 ; carrots, 3 ; herbs, large bunch; mace, 3 blades; white whole pepper, 1 teaspoonful; water, 1 gallon : 5 to 6 hours. Whites of eggs, 4 : 15 minutes.CHAP. IV.] SAUCES. 113 CHAPTER IY. SAUCES. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. The difference be- tween good and bad cookery can scarcely be more strikingly shown than in the manner in which sauces are Bain Marie, or Water Bath. prepared and served. If well-made, appropriate to the dishes they accompany, and sent to table with them as hot as possible, they not only give a heightened relish to a dinner, but they prove that both skill and taste have been exerted in its arrangements. When coarsely or carelessly prepared, on the contrary, as they too often are, they greatly discredit the cook, and are any thing but acceptable to the eaters. Melted butter, the most common of all, — the “ one sauce” of England, which excites the raillery of foreigners,—is frequently found to be such an intolerable compound, either oiled, or lumpy, or composed principally of flour and water, that it says little for the state of cookery amongst us. We trust that the receipts in the present chapter are so clearly given that if strictly followed, they will materially assist the learner in preparing tolerably palatable sauces at the least. The cut at the commencement of the chapter exhibits the vessel called a bain marie, in which saucepans are placed when it is necessary to keep their contents hot without allowing them to boil; it is extremely useful when dinners are delayed after they are ready to serve. 1114. MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. IV. TO THICKEN SAUCES. When this is done with the yolks of eggs, they should first be well beaten, and then mixed with a spoonful of cold stock, should it be at hand, and with one or two of the boiling sauce, which should be stirred •very quickly to them, and they must in turn be stirred briskly to the sauce, which may be held over the fire, and well shaken for an instant afterwards, but never placed upon it, nor allowed to boil. To the roux or French thickening (which follows), the gravy or other liquid which is to be mixed with it should be poured boiling* and in small quantities, the saucepan being often well shaken round, and the sauce made to boil up after each portion is added. If this precaution be observed, the butter will never float upon the surface, but the whole wiil be well and smoothly blended : it will otherwise be difficult to clear the sauce from it perfectly. For invalids, or persons who object to butter in their soups or sauces, flour only, mixed to a smooth batter and stirred into the boiling liquid, may be substituted for other thickening : arrow-root also will answer the same purpose. FRENCH THICKENING; OR, BROWN ROUX. For ordinary purposes this may be made as it is wanted for use; but when it is required for various dishes at the same time, or for cookery on a large scale, it can be prepared at once in sufficient quantity to last several days, and it will remain good for some time. Dissolve with a very gentle degree of heat, half a pound of good butter, then draw it from the fire, skim it well, give time for it to settle, pour it gently from the sediment into a very clean frying-pan, and place it over a slow but clear fire. Put into a dredging box about seven ounces of fine dry flour; add it gradually to the butter, and shake the pan often as it is thrown in : keep the thickening constantly stirred until it hasCHAP. IV.] SAUCES. 115 acquired a clear light brown colour. It should be very slowly and equally done, or its flavour will berm plea- sant. Pour it into a jar, and stir a spoonful or two as it is needed into boiling soup or gravy. When the butter is not clarified it will absorb an additional ounce of flour, the whole of which ought to be fine and dry. This thickening may be made in a well-tinned stewpan even better than in a frying-pan, and if simmered over a coal fire it should be placed high above it, and well guarded from smoke. WHITE ROUX, OR FRENCH THICKENING. Proceed exactly as for the preceding receipt, but dredge in the flour as soon as the butter is in full simmer, and be careful not to allow the thickening to take the slightest colour : this is used for white gravies o o or sauces. SAUCE TOURNEE; OR, PALE THICKENED GRAVY. This is nothing more than rich pale gravy made with veal or poultry (see Consommee, page 100) and thickened with delicate white roux. The French give it a flavouring of mushrooms and green onions, by boiling some of each in it for about half an hour before the sauce is served; it must then be strained, previously to being dished. Either first dissolve an ounce of butter, and then dredge gradually to it three quarters of an ounce of flour, and proceed as for the preceding receipt; or blend the flour and butter perfectly with a knife, before they are thrown into the stewpan, and keep them stirred without ceasing over a dear and gentle fire until they have simmered for some minutes, then place the stewpan high over the fire, and shake it constantly until the roux has lost the raw taste of the flour; next, stir very gradually to it a pint of the gravy, which should be boiling: set it by the side of the stove for a few minutes, and skim it thoroughly.116 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. IY. Butter, 1 oz.; flour, f oz.; strong, pale gravy, sea- soned with mushrooms and green onions, 1 pint. Obs.—With the addition of three or four yolks of very fresh eggs, mixed with a seasoning of mace, cayenne, and lemon-juice, this becomes German sauce, now much used for fricassees, and other dishes; and minced parsley (boiled) and Chili vinegar, each in sufficient quantity to flavour it agreeably, convert it into a good fish sauce. BECHAMEL. This is a fine French white sauce, now very much served at good English tables. It may be made in various ways, and more or less expensively; but it should always be thick, smooth, and rich, though delicate in flavour. The most ready mode of preparing it is to take an equal proportion of very strong, pale veal gravy, and of good cream (a pint of each, for example), and then by rapid boiling over a very clear fire, to reduce the gravy nearly half; next, to mix with part of the cream a tablespoonful of fine dry flour, to pour it to the remainder, when it boils, and to keep the whole stirred for five minutes or more over a slow fire, for if placed upon a fierce one, it would be liable to burn ; then to add the gravy, to stir and* mix the sauce perfectly, and to simmer it for a few minutes longer. All the flavour should be given by the gravy, in which French cooks boil a handful of mushrooms, a few green onions, and some branches of parsley before it is reduced: but a good bechamel may be made without them, with a strong consommee (See pale veal gravy, page 100,) well reduced. Strong pale veal gravy (flavoured with mushrooms or not), 1 pint: reduced half. Rich cream, 1 pint; flour, 1 tablespoonful: 5 minutes. With gravy, four or five minutes. Obs.— Veloutei which is a rather thinner sauce or gravy, is made by simply well-reducing the cream and stock separately, and then mixing them together with- out any thickening.SAUCES. 117 CHAP. IV.] A LESS EXPENSIVE BECHAMEL. This may be made very good without any meat. Slice a large carrot, and a couple of small onions into a stewpan, and set them over a slow fire, with three ounces of butter, and a large handful of mushroom- buttons, nicely cleaned, when they can be procured, for with us they do not abound so commonly as in France. When these have stewed for half an hour, or until the butter is nearly dried up, stir in two tablespoonsful of flour, and pour in a pint of new milk, a little at a time, shaking the stewpan well round, that the sauce may be smooth. Boil the bechamel gently for half an hour; add a little salt, and cayenne; strain, and reduce it, if not quite thick, or pour it boiling to the yolks of two fresh eggs. ANOTHER COMMON BECHAMEL. Cut half a pound of veal, and a slice of lean ham into small bits, and stew them in butter, with vegetables, as directed in the foregoing receipt: stir in the same pro- portion of flour, then add the milk, and let the sauce boil very gently for an hour. It should not be allowed to thicken too much before it is strained. Obs.—Common bechamel, with the addition of a spoonful of made-mustard, is an excellent sauce for boiled mutton. RICH MELTED BUTTER. This is more particularly required in general for lobster sauce, when it is to be served with turbot or brill, and for good oyster sauce as well. Salmon is itself so rich, that less butter is needed for it than for sauce which is to accompany a drier fish. Mix to a very smooth batter a dessertspoonful of flour, a half saltspoon- ful of salt, and half a pint of cold water; put these into a delicately clean saucepan, with from four to six ounces of well flavoured butter, cut into small bits, and shake the sauce strongly round, almost without cessation.MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. IY. 118 until the ingredients are perfectly blended, and it is on the point of boiling; let it simmer for two or three minutes, and it will be ready for use. The best French cooks recommend its not being allowed to boil, as they say it tastes less of flour if served when it is just at the point of simmering. Cold water, \ pint; salt, J saltspoonful; flour, 1 dessertspoonful: 3 to 4 minutes. MELTED BUTTER. (A good common Receipt.') Put into a basin a large teaspoonful of flour, and a little salt, then mix with them very gradually and very smoothly a quarter-pint of cold water; turn these into a small clean saucepan, and shake or stir them constantly over a clear Are till they have boiled a couple of minutes, then add an ounce and a half of butter cut small, keep the sauce stirred until this is entirely dissolved, then give the whole a minute’s boil, and serve it quickly. The more usual mode is to put the butter in at first with the flour and water ; but for inexperienced or unskilful cooks the safer plan is to follow the present receipt. Water, \ pint; flour, 1 teaspoonful: 2 minutes. Butter, H oz.: 1 minute. Obs.— To render this a rich sauce, increase, or even double the proportion of butter. FRENCH MELTED BUTTER. Pour half a pint of good, but not very thick melted butter, boiling, to the well beaten yolks of two very fresh eggs, and stir them briskly as it is added; put the sauce again into the saucepan, and shake it high over the fire for an instant, but do not allow it to boil, or it will curdle. Add a little lemon-juice or vinegar, and serve it immediately. NORFOLK SAUCE ; OR, RICH MELTED BUTTER WITHOUT FLOUR. Put three tablespoonsful of water into a small sauce-CHAP. IV.] SAUCES. 119 pan, and when it boils add four ounces of fresh butter ; as soon as this is quite dissolved, take the saucepan from the fire and shake it round until the sauce looks * thick and smooth. It must not be allowed to boil after the butter is added. Water, 3 tablespoonsful; butter, 4 ozs. WHITE MELTED BUTTER. Thicken half a pint of new milk with rather less flour than is directed for the common melted butter, or with a little arrow-root, and stir into it by degrees after it has boiled, a couple of ounces of fresh butter cut small; do not cease to stir the sauce until this is entirely dissolved, or it may become oiled, and float on the top. Thin cream, substituted for the milk, and flavoured with a few strips of lemon rind cut extremely thin, some salt, and a small quantity of pounded mace, if mixed with rather less flour, and the same propor- tion of butter, will make an excellent sauce to serve with fowls or other dishes, when no gravy is at hand to make white sauce in the usual way. BURNT BUTTER. Melt in a frying pan three ounces of fresh butter, and keep it stirred slowly over a gentle fire until it is of a dark brown colour; then pour to it two table- spoonsful of good hot vinegar; season it with black pepper, and a little salt.—In France, this is a favourite sauce with boiled skate, which is served with plenty of crisped parsley, in addition, strewed over it. Butter, 3 ozs.; vinegar, 2 tablespoonsful; pepper; salt. CLARIFIED BUTTER. Put the butter into a very clean and well-tinned saucepan or enamelled stewpan, and melt it gently over a clear fire; when it just begins to simmer, skim it thoroughly, draw it from the fire, and let it stand a few minutes that the butter-milk may sink to the120 [CHAP. IY. MODERN COOKERY. bottom ; then pour it clear of the sediment through a muslin strainer or a fine hair sieve; put it into jars, and store them in a cool place. Butter, thus prepared, will answer for all the ordinary purposes of cookery, and remain good for a great length of time. In France, large quantities are melted down in autumn for winter- use. The clarified butter ordered for the various receipts in this volume, is merely dissolved with a gentle degree of heat in a small saucepan, skimmed, and poured out for use, leaving the thick sediment behind. VERY GOOD EGG SAUCE. Boil four fresh eggs for quite fifteen minutes, then lay them into plenty of fresh water, and let them remain until they are perfectly cold. Break the shells by rolling them on a table, take them off, separate the whites from the yolks, and divide all of the latter into quarter-inch dice; mince two of the whites only, tolerably small, mix them lightly, and stir them into the third of a pint of rich melted butter, or of white sauce : serve the whole as hot as possible. Eggs, 4: boiled 15 minutes, left till cold. The yolks of all, wdiites of 2 ; third of pint of good melted butter or white sauce. Salt as needed. COMMON EGG SAUCE. Boil a couple of eggs hard, and when they are quite cold cut the whites and yolks separately; mix them well, put them into a very hot tureen, and pour boiling to them a quarter-pint of melted butter: stir, and serve the sauce immediately. Whole eggs, 2; melted butter, J pint. EGG SAUCE FOR CALF’S HEAD. This is a provincial sauce, served sometimes with fish, and with calf’s head also.

Boil softly in half a pint of well-flavoured pale veal gravy a few very thin strips of fresh lemon-rind, for just sufficient time to give their flavour to it; stir in a thickening of arrow-root, or flour and butter ; add salt if needed, and mix with the gravy a quarter pint of boiling cream. Good pale veal gravy, J pint; third of lemon-rind : 15 to 20 minutes. Freshly pounded mace, third of salt- spoonful ; butter, 1 to 2 ozs.; flour, 1 teaspoonful (or arrow-root an equal quantity); cream, \ pint. Obs.—For the best kind of white sauce see bechamel. VERY COMMON WHITE SAUCE. The neck and the feet of a fowl, nicely cleaned, and stewed down in half a pint of water, until it is reduced to less than a quarter-pint, with a thin strip or two of lemon-rind, a small blade of mace, a small branch or two of parsley, a little salt, and half a dozen corns of pepper, then strained, thickened, and flavoured by the preceding receipt, and mixed with something more than half the quantity of cream, will answer for this sauce extremely well; and if it be added, when made, to the liver of the chicken, previously boiled for six minutes in the gravy, then bruised to a smooth paste, and passed through a sieve, it will become an excellent liver sauce. A little strained lemon-juice is generally added to it when it is ready to serve : it should be stirred very briskly in. DUTCH SAUCE. Put into a small saucepan the yolks of three fresh eggs, the juice of a large lemon, three ounces of butter, aMODERN COOKERY. 122 [CHAP. IV. little salt and nutmeg, and a wineglassful of water. Hold the saucepan over a clear fire, and keep the sauce stirred until it nearly boils : a little cayenne may be added. The safest way of making all sauces that will curdle by being allowed to boil, is to put them into a jar, and to set the jar over the fire, in a saucepan of boiling water, and then to stir the ingredients constantly until tlie sauce is thickened sufficiently to serve. Yolks of eggs, 3; juice 1 lemon; butter, 3 ozs. ; little salt and nutmeg; water, 1 wineglassful; cayenne at pleasure. Obs.—A small cup of veal gravy, mixed with plenty of blanched and chopped parsley, may be used instead of water for this sauce, when it is to be served with boiled veal, or with calf’s head. FRICASSEE SAUCE. Stir briskly, but by degrees, to the well-beaten yolks of two large, or of three small fresh eggs, half a pint of common English white sauce, put it again into the saucepan, give it a shake over the fire, but be extremely careful not to allow it to boil; and just before it is served, stir in a dessertspoonful of strained lemon-juice. When meat or chickens are fricasseed, they should be lifted from the saucepan with a slice, drained on it from the sauce, and laid into a very hot dish before the eggs are added, and when these are just set, the sauce should be poured on them. BREAD SAUCE. Pour quite-boiling on half a pint of the finest bread- crumbs, an equal measure of new milk; cover them closely with a plate, and let the sauce remain for twenty or thirty minutes; put it then into a deli- cately clean saucepan, witli a small saltspoonful of salt, half as much pounded mace, a little cayenne, and about an ounce of fresh butter; keep it stirred constantly over a clear fire for a few minutes, then mix with it a couple of spoonsful of good cream,CHAP. IV.] 123 SAUCES. give it a boil, and serve it immediately. When cream is not to be had, an additional spoonful or two of milk must be used; and as the sauce ought to be perfectly smooth, it is better to shake the crumbs through a cullender before the milk is poured to them; they should be of stale bread, and very lightly grated. As some will absorb more liquid than others, the cook must increase a little the above proportion, should it be needed. Equal parts of milk and of thin cream make an excellent bread sauce : more butter can be used to enrich it when it is liked. Bread crumbs and new milk, each J pint (or any other measure) ; soaked, 20 to 30 minutes, or more. Salt, small saltspoonful; mace, half as much; little cayenne; butter, 1 oz. : boiled 4 to 5 minutes. 2 to 4 spoonsful of good cream, (or milk) : 1 minute. Or: bread crumbs, J pint; milk and cream, each J pint; and from 2 to 4 spoonsful of either in addition. Ohs.—Yery pale, strong veal gravy is sometimes poured on the bread, instead of milk ; and these, after being soaked, are boiled extremely dry, and then brought to the proper consistency with rich cream. The gravy may be highly flavoured with mushrooms when this is done. BREAD SA.UCE WITH ONION. Put into a very clean saucepan nearly half a pint of fine bread-crumbs, and the white part of a large mild onion, cut into quarters; pour to these three quarters of a pint of new milk, and boil them very gently, keeping them often stirred, until the onion is perfectly tender, which will be in from forty minutes to an hour. Press the whole through a.hair sieve, which should be as clean as possible, reduce the sauce by quick boiling, should it be too thin, add a seasoning of salt and grated nutmeg, an ounce of butter, and four spoonsful of cream, and when it is of the proper thickness, pour out the sauce, and send it quickly to table. Breadcrumbs nearly J pint; white part of 1 large[CHAP. IY.

Obs.—This is an excellent sauce for those who like a subdued flavour of onion in it; but as many persons object to any, the cook should ascertain whether it be liked before she follows this receipt. COMMON LOBSTER SAUCE. Add to half a pint of good melted butter, a table- spoonful of essence of anchovies, a small half-saltspoonful of freshly pounded mace, and less than a quarter one of cayenne. If a couple of spoonsful of cream are at hand, stir them to the sauce when it boils; then put in the flesh of the tail and claws of a small lobster cut into dice, (or any other form) of equal size. Keep the saucepan by the side of the fire until the fish is quite heated through, but do not let the sauce boil again : serve it very hot. A small quantity can be made on occasion, with the remains of a lobster that has been served at table. Melted butter, ^ pint; essence of anchovies, 1 table- spoonful ; pounded mace, small J saltspoonful; less than J one of cayenne; cream (if added), 2 table- spoonsful ; flesh of small lobster. GOOD LOBSTER SAUCE. Select for this a perfectly fresh hen lobster; split the tail carefully, and take out the inside coral; pound half of it in a mortar very smoothly with less than an ounce of butter, rub it through a hair sieve, and put it aside. Cut the firm flesh of the fish into dice of not less than half an inch in size; and when these are ready, make as much good melted butter as will supply the quantity of sauce required for table, and if to be served with a turbot, or other large fish, to a numerous company, let it be plentifully provided. Season it slightly with essence of anchovies, and well with cayenne, mace, and salt; add125 CHAP. IV.] SAUCES. to it a few spoonsful of rich cream, and then mix a small portion of it very gradually with the pounded coral; when this is sufficiently liquified, pour it into the sauce, and stir the whole well together; put in immediately the flesh of the fish, and heat the sauce thoroughly by the side of the fire, without allowing it to boil, for if it should do so, its fine colour would be destroyed. The whole of the coral may be used for the sauce when no portion of it is wanted for other purposes. GOOD OYSTER SAUCE. At the moment they " are wanted for use, open three dozens of fine plump native oysters ; save carefully and strain their liquor, rince them separately in it, put them into a very clean saucepan, strain the liquor again, and pour it to them ; heat them slowly, and keep them from one to two minutes at the simmering point, without allowing them to boil, as that will render them hard. Lift them out and beard them neatly ; add to the liquor three ounces of butter, smoothly mixed with a large dessertspoonful of flour ; stir these without ceasing until they boil, and are perfectly mixed; then add to them gradually a quarter-pint, or rather more, of new milk, or of thin cream (or equal parts of both), and continue the stirring until the sauce boils again; add a little salt, should it be needed, and a small quantity of cayenne in the finest powder; put in the oysters, and keep the saucepan by the side of the fire, until the whole is thoroughly hot, and begins to simmer, then turn the sauce into a well-heated tureen, and send it imme- diately to table. Small plump oysters, 3 dozens ; butter, 3 ozs.; flour, 1 large dessertspoonful; the oyster liquor; milk or cream, full | pint; little salt and cayenne. COMMON OYSTER SAUCE. Prepare and plump two dozens of oysters as directed in the receipt above; add their strained liquor to a quarter-pint of thick melted butter made with milk, orMODERN COOKERY. 12 G [chap.

Some persons like a little cayenne and anchovy-essence added to it when it is served with fish: others prefer the unmixed flavour of the oysters. Oysters, 2 dozens; their liquor; melted butter, \ pint. (Little cayenne and 1 dessertspoonful of essence of anchovies when liked.) SHRIMP SAUCE. The fish for this sauce should be very fresh. Shell quickly one pint of shrimps, and mix them with half a pint of melted butter, to which a few drops of essence of anchovies, and a little mace and cayenne, have been added. As soon as the shrimps are heated through, dish, and serve the sauce, which ought not to boil after they are put in. Many persons add a few spoonsful of rich cream to all shell-fish sauces. Shrimps, 1 pint; melted butter, J pint; essence of anchovies, 1' teaspoonful; mace, teaspoonful; cayenne, very little. ANCHOVY SAUCE. To half a pint of good melted butter add three dessert- spoonsful of essence of anchovies, a quarter-teaspoonful of mace, and a rather high seasoning of cayenne; or pound the flesh of two or three fine mellow anchovies very smooth, mix it with the boiling butter, simmer these for a minute or two, strain the sauce if needful, add the spices, give it a boil, and serve it. Melted butter, J pint; essence of anchovies, 3 dessert- spoonsful ; mace, -J- teaspoonful; cayenne to taste. Or, 3 large anchovies finely pounded, and the same propor- tions of butter and spice.

The addition of shelled shrimps, or lobster cut in dice, will convert this at once into a most excellent sauce of either. Pounded mace may be added to it with the cayenne; and it may be thinned with a few spoonsful of milk should it be too thick. Omit the essence of anchovies, and mix with it some parsley boiled very green, and minced, and it becomes a good sauce for boiled poultry. Butter, 3 ozs.; flour, 1 large teaspoonful : 2 to 3 minutes. Cream, \ pint; essence of anchovies, 1 large dessertspoonful (more if liked) ; Chili vinegar or lemon- juice, 1 teaspoonful; salt, -J saltspoonful. SHARP MAITRE D’HOTEL SAUCE. (English Receipt.) . For a rich sauce of this kind, mix a dessertspoonful of flour with four ounces of good butter, but with from two to three ounces only for common occasions; knead them together until they resemble a smooth paste, then proceed exactly as for the' sauce above, but substitute good pale veal gravy, or strong pure-flavoured veal broth, or shin of beef stock (which, if well made, has little colour), for the cream ; and when these have boiled for two or three minutes, stir in a tablespoonful of common vinegar, and one of Chili vinegar, with as much cayenne as will flavour the sauce well, and salt, should it be needed ; throw in from two to three dessertspoonsful of finely-minced parsley, give the whole a boil, and it will be ready to serve. A tablespoonful of mushroom catsup or of Harvey’s sauce may be added with the vinegar when the colour of the sauce is immaterial. It may be served with boiled calf’s head, or with boiled eels with good effect; and, as we have directed in another part of this volume, various kinds of cold meat and fish may be128 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. IV. re-warmed for table in it. With a little more flour, and a flavouring of essence of anchovies, it will make, with- out the parsley, an excellent sauce for these last, when they are first dressed. Butter, 2 to 4 ozs.; flour, 1 dessertspoonful; pale veal gravy, or strong broth, or shin of beef stock, \ pint; cayenne; salt, if needed; common vinegar, 1 table- spoonful ; Chili vinegar, 1 tablespoonful. (Catsup or Harvey’s sauce, according to circumstances.) FRENCH MAITRE D’HOTEL, * OR STEWARD’S SAUCE. Add to half a pint of rich, pale veal gravy, well thickened with the white roux of page 115, a good seasoning of pepper, salt, minced parsley, and lemon- juice ; or make the thickening with a small tablespoon- ful of. flour, and a couple of ounces of butter; keep these stirred constantly over a very gentle fire from ten to fifteen minutes, then pour to them the gravy, boiling, in small portions, mixing the whole well as it is added, and letting it boil up between each, for unless this be done^ the butter will be likely to float on the surface. Simmer the sauce for a few minutes, and skim it well, then add salt should it be needed, a tolerable seasoning of pepper or of cayenne, in fine powder, from two to three teaspoonsful of minced parsley, and the strained juice of a small lemon. For some dishes, this sauce is thickened with the yolks of eggs; about four to the pint. The French work into their sauces generally a small bit of fresh butter, just before they are taken from the fire, to give them mellowness; this is done usually for the Maitre d’Hotel. MAITRE D’HOTEL SAUCE MAIGRE ;+ OR WITHOUT GRAVY. Substitute half a pint of good melted butter for the gravy, and add to it the same seasonings as above. A double quantity of these sauces will be needed when they r * The Maitre d’Hotel is, properly, the House Steward. f Maigre, made without meat.129 SAUCES. CHAP.

Melted butter, \ pint; seasoning of salt, and pepper, or cayenne; minced parsley, 2 to 3 teaspoonsful; juice 1 small lemon. COLD MAITRE DhlOTEL, OR STEWARD^ SAUCE. Work well together two or three ounces of fresh butter, with some pepper, salt, minced parsley, and the juice of a lemon. This is frequently put into broiled fish, or laid in the dish under beef steaks, broiled kidneys, and various other meats. THE LADY’S SAUCE. (For Fish.) Pound to a very smooth paste the inside coral of a lobster with a small slice of butter, and some cayenne ; rub it through a hair sieve, gather it together, and mix it very smoothly with from half to three quarters of a pint of sauce tournee, or cream fish sauce, previously well-seasoned with cayenne and salt, and moderately with pounded mace; bring it to the point of boiling only, stir in quickly, but gradually, a tablespoonful of strained lemon-juice, and serve the sauce very hot. When neither cream nor gravy is at hand, substitute rich melted butter, mixed with a dessertspoonful or two of essence of anchovies, and well seasoned. The fine colour of the coral will be destroyed by boiling. This sauce, which the French call Sauce d VAurore, may be served with brill, boiled soles, grey mullet, and some few other kinds of fish ; it is quickly made when the lobster butter of Chapter XIY. is in the house. Coral of lobster, pounded; cream-sauce, or sauce tournee (thickened pale veal gravy), J to J pint; lemon- juice, 1 tablespoonful; salt, cayenne, and mace, as needed. Or: rich melted butter, instead of other sauce; essence of anchovies, 2 dessertspoonsful; other seasoning, as above. ——The proportion of spices here must, of course, K130 [[chap. iy. MODERN COOKERY. depend on the flavouring which the gravy or sauce may already have received. SAUCE ROBERT. Cut in small dice, four or five large onions, and brown them in a stewpan with three ounces of butter, and a dessertspoonful of flour. When of a deep amber colour, pour to them half a pint of beef or of veal gravy, and let them simmer for fifteen minutes ; skim the sauce, add salt and pepper, and, at the moment of serving, mix in a dessertspoonful of made mustard. Large onions, 4 or 5; butter, 3 oz.; flour, dessert- spoonful: 10 to 15 minutes. Gravy, J pint: 15 minutes. Mustard, dessertspoonful. SAUCE PIQUANTE. Brown lightly, in an ounce and a half of butter, a tablespoonful of minced eschalots, or three of onions; add a teaspoonful of flour when they are partly done, pour to them half a pint of gravy or of good broth, and when it boils, add three chilies, a bay-leaf, and a very small bunch of thyme. Let these simmer for twenty minutes, take out the thyme and bay-leaf, add a high seasoning of black pepper, and half a wineglassful of the best vinegar. A quarter-teaspoonful of cayenne may be substituted for the chilies. Eschalots, 1 tablespoonful, or 3 of onions; flour, 1 teaspoonful; butter, 1^ oz.: 10 to 15 minutes. Gravy or broth, 1 pint; chilies, 3; bay-leaf; thyme, small bunch : 20 minutes. Pepper, plenty; vinegar, J wine- glassful. EXCELLENT HORSERADISH SAUCE. (To serve hot or cold icith roast beef.) Wash, and wipe a stick of young horseradish, grate it as small as possible on a fine grater, then with two ounces (or a couple of large tablespoonsful) of it, mix a small teaspoonful of salt, and four tablespoonsful of good cream ; then stir in briskly and by degrees, three des-SAUCES. 131 CHAP. IY.] sertspoonsful of vinegar : one of these should be Chili vinegar when the horseradish is mild. To heat the sauce, put it into a small and delicately clean saucepan, hold it over, but do not place it upon the fire, and stir it without interruption until it is near the point of sim- mering, but do not allow it to boil, or it will curdle instantly. Horseradish pulp, 2 ozs. (or, 2 large tablespoonsful) ; salt, 1 teaspoonful; good cream, 4 tablespoonsful; vine- gar, 3 dessertspoonsful (of which one should be Chili when the root is mild). Obs.—Common English salad-mixture is often added to the grated horseradish when the sauce is to be served cold. HOT HORSERADISH SAUCE. (To serve with boiled or stewed meat, or fish.) Mix three ounces of voung tender orated horseradish with half a pint of good brown gravy, and let it stand by the side of the fire till it is on the point of boiling; add salt if required, a teaspoonful of made-mustard, and a dessertspoonful of garlic or of eschalot vinegar, if at hand ; if not, substitute Chili vinegar, or twice as much common vinegar for it. Some cooks stew the horseradish in vinegar for ten minutes, and after having drained it from this, mix it with nearly half a pint of thick melted butter. Horseradish, grated, 3 ozs.; brown gravy, -J- pint ; made-mustard, i teaspoonful; eschalot or garlic vine- gar, 1 dessertspoonful (or, Chili vinegar, same quantity, or common vinegar, twice as much). CHRISTOPHER NORTHS OWN SAUCE FOR MANY MEATS.

IV. of well-refined, pounded, and -•sifted sugar; mix them thoroughly, then pour in a tablespoonful of the strained juice of a fresh lemon, two of Harvey’s sauce, a tea- spoonful of the very best mushroom catsup (or of cavice), and three tablespoonsful, or a small wineglassful, of port wine. Heat the sauce by placing the basin in a sauce- pan of boiling water; or turn it into a jar, and place this in the water. Serve it directly it is ready with geese or ducks, tame or wild; roast pork, venison, fawn, a grilled blade-bone, or any other broil. A slight flavour of garlic or eschalot vinegar may be given to it at plea- sure. Many persons use it with fish. It is good cold ; and, if bottled directly it is made, may be stored for several days. It is the better for being mixed some hours before it is served. The proportion of cayenne may be doubled when a eery pungent sauce is desired. Good cayenne pepper in fine powder, 1 heaped salt- spoonful ; salt, half as much; pounded sugar, 1 small dessertspoonful; strained lemon-juice, 1 tablespoonful; Harvey’s sauce, 2 tablespoonsful; best mushroom catsup (or cavice), 1 teaspoonful; port wine, 3 table- spoonsful, or small wineglassful. (Little eschalot, or garlic-vinegar at pleasure.) Obs.—This sauce is exceedingly good when mixed with the brown-gravy of a hash or stew, or with that which is served with game or other dishes. POOR MANS sauce. (Served with Turkey Poults.') Mix with four tablespoonsful of minced eschalots, half a teaspoonful of salt, nearly as much pepper, two table- spoonsful of water, and three of good sharp vinegar. Boil the sauce for a few minutes, and serve it hot; or send it to table cold, when it is liked so. Vinegar may entirely supply the place of the water in this case, and a spoonful or two of oil be mixed with it. A small des- sertspoonful of minced parsley, tarragon, or chervil, is likewise sometimes mixed with the eschalots. Their strong flavour may be in some measure -weakened byCHAP. IV.] SAUCES. 133 steeping them for an hour or more in a pint of cold water after they are minced. SALAD DRESSING. For a salad of moderate size pound very smoothly the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs with a small teaspoonful of unmade mustard, half as much sugar in fine powder, and a saltspoonful of salt. Mix gradually with these a small cup of cream, or the same quantity of very pure oil, and two tablespoonsful of vinegar. More salt and acid can be added at pleasure; but the latter usually predo- minates too much in English salads. A few drops of Chili or of cayenne vinegar will improve this receipt. Hard yolks of eggs, 2; unmade mustard, 1 small teaspoonful; sugar, half as much ; salt, 1 saltspoonful ; cream or oil, small cupful; vinegar, 2 tablespoonsful. Ohs.—To some tastes a teaspoonful or more of escha- lot vinegar would be an acceptable addition to this sauce, which may be otherwise varied in numberless ways. Cucumber, or tarragon-vinegar may be substituted for other, and small quantities of soy, cavice, essence of anchovies, or catsup may in turn be used to flavour the compound. The salad-bowl too may be rubbed with a cut clove of garlic, to give the whole composition a very slight flavour of it.* The eggs should be boiled fifteen minutes, and allowed to become quite cold always before tliejr are pounded, or the mixture will not be smooth : .if it should curdle, which it will sometimes do, if not carefully made, add to it the yolk of a very fresh unboiled egg. * As we have before had occasion to remark, garlic, when very sparingly and judiciously used, imparts a remarkably fine savour to a sauce or gravy, and neither a strong nor a coarse one, as it does when used in larger quantities. The veriest morsel (or, as the French call it, a mere soupgon) of the root, is sufficient to give this agreeable piquancy, but unless the proportion be ex- tremely small, the effect will be quite different. The Italians dress their salads upon a round of delicately toasted bread, which is rubbed with garlic, saturated with oil, and sprinkled with cayenne, before it is laid into the bowl : they also eat the bread thus prepared, but with less of oil, and untoasted often, before their meals, as a digestor.[Thap. IY. MODERN COOKERY. 134 FRENCH SALAD DRESSING. Stir a saltspoonful of salt and half as much pepper into a large spoonful of oil, and when the salt is dissolved, mix with them four additional spoonsful of oil, and pour the whole over the salad ; let it be well turned, and then add a couple of spoonsful of tarragon vinegar, mix the whole thoroughly, and serve it without delay. The salad should not be dressed in this way until the instant before it is wanted for table : the proportions of salt and pepper can be increased at pleasure, and common, or cucumber-vinegar may be substituted for the tarragon, which, however, is more frequently than any other used in France. Salt, 1 spoonful; pepper, \ as much; oil, 5 salad- spoonsful ; tarragon, or other vinegar, 2 spoonsful. OUR OWN SAUCE FOR SALAD OR COLD MEAT. Mix with the yolks of two very fresh unboiled eggs a half saltspoonful of salt, a third as much of cayenne, and a slight grating of nutmeg; then stir very gradu- ally to them three tablespoonsful of oil of the finest quality, working the sauce like the Mayonnaise ; and when it is perfectly smooth, add three spoonsful of good meat-jelly, and two of cucumber vinegar. The shin of beef stock for gravies, which will be strongly jellied when cold, will answer very well for this sauce when no richer is at hand; a little Chili vinegar is a o-ood addition to it. o MAYONNAISE. (A very fine sauce for cold meat, poultry, fish, or salad.) Put into a large basin the yolks only of two fine and very fresh eggs, carefully freed from the germs, with a little salt and cayenne ; stir these well together, then add about a teaspoonful of the purest salad oil, and work the mixture round with a wooden spoon until it appears like cream. Pour in by slow degrees nearlyCHAP. IV.] SAUCES. 135 half a pint of oil, continuing at each interval to work the sauce as at first until it resumes the smoothness of a custard, and not a particle of the oil is visible; then add a couple of tablespoonsful of plain or of tarragon vinegar, and one of cold water to whiten the sauce. A bit of clear veal-jelly the size of an egg will improve it greatly ; and a morsel of garlic not larger than a pea, bruised as fine as possible, will give it a very agreeable relish, even to persons to whom garlic generally is dis- tasteful. In lieu of this, a few drops of eschalot vinegar may be stirred in; and the flavour may be varied with lemon-juice, and cucumber, or Chili vinegar at choice. The reader who may have a prejudice against the unboiled eggs which enter into the compo- sition of the Mayonnaise, will find that the most fastidious taste would not detect their being raw, if the sauce be well made; and persons who dislike oil may partake of it in this form, without being aware of its presence, provided always that it be perfectly fresh, and pure in flavour, for otherwise it is easily perceptible. Yolks of fresh unboiled eggs, 2; salt, -1 saltspoonful or rather more; cayenne; oil, full third of pint; common, or tarragon-vinegar, 2 tablespoonsful; cold water, I tablespoonful; garlic, morsel size of a pea (or few drops of eschalot vinegar). Meat-jelly (if at hand), size of an egg. Ohs.—When a much larger proportion of vinegar is liked, a third yolk of egg should be used, or the sauce will be too thin. It is sometimes coloured green, with the juice of parsley, and other herbs. A spoonful or two of cold bechamel, or of good white sauce, is always an improvement to it. REMOULADE. This differs little from an ordinary salad dressing. Pound very smoothly indeed the yolks of two or three hard boiled eggs with a teaspoonful of mustard, half as much salt, and some cayenne or white pepper. Mix gradually with these, working the whole well together.136 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. IV. two or three tablespoonsful of oil and two of vinegar. Should the sauce be curdled, pour it by degrees to the yolk of a raw egg, stirring it well round as directed for the Mayonnaise. A spoonful of tarragon, cucumber, or eschalot-vinegar may be added with very good effect; and to give it increased relish, a teaspoonful of cavice, or a little of Harvey’s sauce, and a dessertspoonful of Chili vinegar may be thrown into it. This last is an excellent addition to all cold sauces, or salad dressings : the Rajah’s sauce, when good, is of finer flavour, and more pungent. Hard yolks of 2 eggs or 3 ; mustard, 1 teaspoonful (more when liked); salt, ~ teaspoonful; pepper or cayenne ; oil, 3 tablespoonsful; vinegar, 2. If curdled, yolk of 1 raw egg. Good additions: tarragon or eschalot, or cucumber-vinegar, 1 tablespoonful; Chili vinegar, 1 dessertspoonful, or Rajah’s sauce, half as much. Cavice or Harvey’s sauce at pleasure. Ohs.—A dessertspoonful of eschalots very finely minced are sometimes pounded with the yolks of eggs for this sauce : a morsel of garlic, not larger than a hazel-nut, may be substituted for them advantageously. FENNEL SAUCE. Strip from the stems, wash very clean, and boil quickly in salt and water till it is quite tender, a handful of young fennel; press the water well from it, mince it very fine, and mix it gradually with the quantity of melted butter required for table. Fennel, small handful; 10 minutes, or till quite tender. Melted butter, \ to \ pint; little salt. Obs.—The French use good pale veal gravy thickened with flour and butter for this sauce. PARSLEY AND BUTTER. Proceed exactly as for the fennel, but boil the parsley four or five minutes less; and be careful to press the water from it thoroughly. For an improved sauce, substitute bechamel or white melted butter for theCHAP. IV.] SAUCES. 137 common melted butter. Chervil is boiled, chopped and mixed with gravy or butter in the same way. Melted butter, or thickened veal-gravy, third of pint; parsley, boiled and minced, 1 dessertspoonful. GOOSEBERRY SAUCE FOR MACKEREL* Cut the stalks and tops from half to a whole pint of quite young gooseberries, wash them well, just cover them with cold water and boil them very gently indeed until they are tender; drain them well, and mix with them a small quantity of melted butter made with rather less flour than usual. Some eaters prefer the mashed gooseberries without any addition ; others like that of a little ginger. The best way of making this sauce is to turn the gooseberries into a hair sieve to drain, then to press them through it with a wooden spoon, and to stir them in a clean stewpan or saucepan over the fire with from half to a whole teaspoonful of sugar, just to soften their extreme acidity, and a bit of fresh butter about the size of a walnut. When the fruit is not passed through the sieve it is an improvement to seed it. COMMON SORREL SAUCE. Strip from the stalks and the large fibres, from one to a couple of quarts of freshly-gathered sorrel, wash it very clean, and put it into a well-tinned stewpan or saucepan (or into a German enamelled one, which would be far better), without any water; add to it a small slice of good butter, some pepper and salt, and stew it gently, keeping it well-stirred, until it is exceedingly tender, that it may not burn ; then drain it on a sieve, or press the liquid well from it, chop it as fine as pos- sible, and boil it again for a few minutes with a spoon- ful or two of gravy, or the same quantity of cream or milk, mixed with a half-teaspoonful of flour, or with only a fresh slice of good butter. The beaten yolk of an egg or two stirred in just as the sorrel is taken from the fire will soften the sauce greatly, and a saltspoonful of pounded sugar will also be an improvement.MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. IY. 333 ASPARAGUS SAUCE, FOR LAMB CHOPS. Cut the green tender points of some young asparagus into half-inch lengths, wash them well, drain and throw them into plenty of boiling salt and water. When they are quite tender, which mtiy be in from ten to fifteen minutes, turn them into a hot strainer and drain the water thoroughly from them ; put them at the instant of serving into half a pint of thickened veal gravy (see Sauce Tournee), mixed with the yolks of a couple of eggs, and well seasoned with salt and cayenne, or white pepper; or, into an equal quantity of good melted butter : add to this last a squeeze of lemon- juice, The asparagus will become yellow if re-boiled, or if left long in the sauce before it is boiled. Asparagus points, \ pint: boiled 10 to 15 minutes, longer if not quite tender. Thickened veal-gravy, \ pint; yolks of eggs, 2. Or: good melted butter, \ pint; lemon-juice, small dessertspoonful, seasoning of salt and white pepper. GREEN MINT SAUCE, FOR ROAST LAMB. The mint for this sauce should be fresh and young, for the leaves when old are tough. Strip them from the stems, wash them with great nicety, and drain them on a sieve or dry them in a cloth. Chop them very fine, put them into a sauce-tureen, and to three heaped tablespoonsful of the mint add two of pounded sugar, mix them well, and then add gradually six tablespoonsful of good vinegar. The sauce made thus is excellent, but Lisbon sugar can be used for it when preferred, and all the proportions can be varied to the taste. It is commonly served too liquid, and not sufficiently sweetened ; and it will be found much more wholesome, and generally far more palatable made by this receipt. Young mint minced, 3 heaped tablespoonsful; pounded sugar, 2 tablespoonsful; vinegar, 6 table- spoonsful.CHAP. IV.] SAUCES. 139 CAPER SAUCE. Stir into the third of a pint of good melted butter from three to four dessertspoonsful of capers, add a little of the vinegar and dish the sauce as soon as it boils. Keep it stirred after the berries are added: part of them may be minced and a little Chili vinegar substi- tuted for their own. Pickled nasturtiums make a very good sauce, and their flavour is sometimes preferred to that of the capers. For a large joint, increase the quantity of butter to half a pint. Melted butter, third of pint; capers, 3 to 4 dessert- spoonsful. BROWN CAPER SAUCE. Thicken half a pint of good veal, or beef-gravy as directed for Sauce Tournee, and add to it two table- spoonsful of capers, and a dessertspoonful of the pickle liquor, or of Chili vinegar, with some cayenne if the former be used, and a proper seasoning of salt. Thickened veal or beef gravy, T pint; capers, 2 tablespoonsful; caper-liquor or Chili vinegar, 1 dessert- spoonful. CAPER SAUCE FOR FISH. To nearly half a pint of very rich melted butter add six spoonsful of strong veal-gravy or jelly, a tablespoon- ful of essence of anchovies, and some Chili vinegar or cayenne. When there is no gravy at hand substitute a half-wineglassful of mushroom catsup, or of Harvey’s sauce; though these deepen the colour more than is desirable. COMMON CUCUMBER SAUCE. Pare, slice, dust slightly with pepper, and with flour, two or three young cucumbers, and fry them a fine brown, in a little butter, or dissolve an ounce and a half in a small stewpan, or iron saucepan, and shake them in it over a brisk fire from twelve to fifteen minutes; pour to them, by degrees, nearly half a pint of strong beef[[chap. iy. 140 MODERN COOKERY. broth, or of brown gravy; add salt, and more pepper if required, stew the whole for five minutes, and send the sauce very hot to table. A minced onion may be browned with the cucumbers when it is liked, and a spoonful of vinegar added to them before they are served. Cucumbers, 2 or 3 ; butter, 1 oz. and \ ; broth or gravy, nearly \ pint; salt, pepper. ANOTHER COMMON SAUCE OF CUCUMBERS. Cucumbers which have the fewest seeds are best for this sauce. Pare and slice a couple, or three, should they be small, and put them into a saucepan, in which two ounces, or rather more, of butter have been dissolved, and are beginning to boil; place them high over the fire, that they may stew as softly as possible without taking colour, for three quarters of an hour, or longer should they require it; add to them a good seasoning of white pepper, and some salt, when they are half done, and just before they are served stir to them half a tea- spoonful of flour, mixed with a morsel of butter ; strew in some minced parsley, give it a boil, and finish with a spoonful of good vinegar. WHITE CUCUMBER SAUCE, Quarter some young quickly grown cucumbers, with- out many seeds in them ; empty them of these and take off the rinds. Cut them into inch-lengths, and boil them from fifteen to eighteen minutes in salt and water; squeeze, and work them through a sieve; mix them with a few spoonsful of bechamel, or thick white sauce, do not let them boil again, but serve them very hot. A sauce of better flavour is made by boiling the cucumbers in veal gravy well seasoned, and stirring in the beaten yolks of two or three eggs, and a little Chili vinegar or lemon-juice, at the instant of serving. Another also of cucumbers sliced, and stewed in butter, but without being at all browned, and then boiled in pale veal gravy, which must be thickened with rich cream, is excellent.

Cut off the stems closely from half a pint of small button mushrooms; clean them with a little salt and a bit of flannel, and throw them into cold water, slightly salted, as they are done; drain them well, and throw them into half a pint of boiling bechamel (see page 116), or of white sauce made with very fresh milk, or thin cream, thickened with a tablespoonful of flour, and two ounces of butter. Simmer the mushrooms from ten to twenty minutes, or till they are quite tender, and dish the sauce, which should be properly seasoned wTith salt, mace and cayenne. Mushrooms, pint; white sauce, -J- pint; seasoning of salt, mace, and cayenne : 10 minutes. ANOTHER MUSHROOM SAUCE. Prepare from half to a whole pint of very small mushroom-buttons with great nicety, and throw them into as much sauce tournee; when they are tender add a few spoonsful of rich cream, give the whole a boil, and serve it. Either of these sauces may be served with boiled poultry, breast of veal, or veal-cutlets : the sauce tournee should be thickened rather more than usual when it is to be used in this receipt. Mushrooms and sauce tournee, each \ to whole pint : stewed till tender. Cream, 4 to 8 tablespoonsful. BROWN MUSHROOM SAUCE. Yery small flaps, peeled and freed entirely from the fur, will answer for this sauce. Leave them whole, or quarter them, and stew them tender in some rich brown gravy; give a full seasoning of mace and cayenne, add thickening, and salt if needed, and a tablespoonful of good mushroom catsup. COMMON TOMATA SAUCE. Tomatas are so juicy when ripe, that they require but142 MODERN COOKERY. £ciiap. IY. little liquid to reduce them to a proper consistency for sauce; and they vary so exceedingly in size and quality that it is difficult to give precise directions for the exact quantity which is needed for them. Take off the stalks, halve the tomatas, and gently squeeze out the seeds and watery pulp ; then stew them softly with a few spoons- ful of gravy or strong broth until they are quite melted.- Press the whole through a hair sieve, and heat it afresh with a little additional gravy should it be too thick, and some cayenne, and salt. Serve it very hot. Fine ripe tomatas, 6 or 8 ; gravy or strong broth, 4 tablespoonsful: -§- to -J hour, or longer if needed. Salt and cayenne sufficient to season the sauce, and two or three spoonsful more of gravy if required. Ohs.—For a large tureen of this sauce, increase the pro- portions : should it at first be too liquid, reduce it by quick boiling. When neither gravy nor broth is at hand, the tomatas may be stewed perfectly tender, but very gently, in a couple of ounces of butter, with some cay- enne and salt only, or with the addition of a very little finely minced onion, then rubbed through a sieve, and heated, and served without any addition, or with only that of a teaspoonful of Chili vinegar; or, when the colour is not a principal consideration, with a few spoonsful of rich cream, smoothly mixed with a little flour to prevent its curdling. The sauce must be stirred without interruption should the last be added, and boiled for four or five minutes. A FINER TOMATA SAUCE. Stew very gently a dozen fine red tomatas, prepared as for the preceding receipt, with two or three sliced eschalots, four or five chilies, or a capsicumb or two, or in lieu of either, with a quarter teaspoonful of cayenne pepper, a few small dice of lean ham, and half a cupful of rich gravy. Stir these often, and when the tomatas are reduced quite to a smooth pulp, press them through a sieve; put them into a clean saucepan, with a few spoonsful more of rich gravy, or Espagnole, add salt, if143 CHAP. IV.] SAUCES. needed, boil the sauce, stirring it well, for ten minutes, and serve it very hot. When the gravy is exceedingly good, and highly flavoured, the ham may be omitted: a dozen small mushrooms, nicely cleaned, may also be sliced, and stewed with the tomatas, instead of the eschalots, when their flavour is preferred, or they may be added with them. The exact proportion of liquid used is immaterial, for should the sauce be too thin, it may be reduced by rapid boiling, and diluted with more gravy if too thick. APPLE SAUCE. (Good.) Put a tablespoonful of water into a quart basin, and fill it with good boiling apples, pared, quartered, and carefully cored; put a plate over, and set them into a moderate oven for about an hour, or until they are reduced quite to a pulp; beat them smooth with a clean wooden spoon, adding to them a little sugar, and a morsel of fresh butter, when these are liked, though they will scarcely be required. The sauce made thus is far superior to that wrhich is boiled. When no other oven is at hand, a Dutch or an American one would probably answer for it; but we cannot assert this on our own experience. Good boiling apples, 1 quart: baked one hour (more or less, according to the quality of the fruit, and tem- perature of the oven); sugar, 1 oz.; butter, \ oz. BROWN APPLE SAUCE. Stew gently down to a thick and perfectly smooth marmalade, a pound of pearmains, or of any other well- flavoured boiling apples, in about the third of a pint of rich brown gravy : season the sauce rather highly with black pepper or cayenne, and serve it very hot. Currie- sauce will make an excellent substitute for the gravy when a very piquante accompaniment is wanted for pork, or other rich meats.

Strip the skin from some large white onions, and after having taken off the tops and roots, cut them in two, throw them into cold water as they are done, cover them plentifully with more, and boil them very tender; lift them out, drain, and then press the water thoroughly from them; chop them small, rub them through a sieve or strainer, put them into a little rich melted butter, mixed with a spoonful or two of cream or milk, add a seasoning of salt, give the sauce a boil, and serve it very hot. Portugal onions, when they can be obtained, are superior to any others, both for this and most other purposes in cookery. For the finest kind of onion sauce, see Soubise, below. BROWN ONION SAUCE. Cut off both ends of the onions, and slice them into a saucepan in which two ounces of butter have been dissolved ; keep them stewing over a clear fire until they are lightly coloured; then pour to them half a pint of brown gravy; and when they have boiled till they are perfectly tender, work the sauce altogether through a strainer, season it with a little cayenne, and serve it very hot. ANOTHER BROWN ONION SAUCE. Mince the onions, stew them in butter till well coloured, stir in a dessertspoonful of flour, shake the stewpan over the fire for three or four minutes, pour in only as much broth or gravy as will leave the sauce tolerably thick, season, and serve it. SOUBISE. (English Receipt.) Slice, skin, and mince quickly two pounds’ weight of the white part only of some fine mild onions, and stewCHAP. IV.] SAUCES. 145 them in from two to three ounces of good butter, over a very gentle fire, until they are reduced to a pulp, then pour to them three quarters of a pint of rich veal gravy ; add a seasoning of salt and cayenne, if needed, skim off the fat entirely, press the sauce through a sieve, heat it in a clean stewpan, mix it with a quarter pint of rich boiling cream, and serve it directly. Onions, 2 lbs.; butter, 2 to 3 ozs. : 30 minutes to 1 hour. Yeal gravy, f pint; salt, cayenne : 5 minutes. Cream, J pint. SOXTBISE. (French Receipt.) Peel some fine white onions, and trim away all tougli and discoloured parts; mince them small, and throw them into plenty of boiling water ; when they have boiled quickly for five minutes, drain them well in a sieve, then stew them very softly indeed in an ounce or two of fresh butter, until they are dry and perfectly tender; stir to them as much bechamel as will bring them to the consistency of very thick peas soup, pass the whole through a strainer, pressing the onion strongly that none may remain behind, and heat the sauce afresh, without allowing it to boil. A small half-teaspoonful of pounded sugar is sometimes added to this soubise. White part of onions, 2 lbs. : blanched 5 minutes. Butter, 2 ozs. : 30 to 50 minutes. Bechamel, f to 1 pint, or more. Obs.—These sauces are served more particularly with lamb, or mutton cutlets, than with any other meats; but they would probably find many approvers if sent to table with roast mutton, or boiled veal. Half the quantity given above will be sufficient for a moderate- sized dish. MILD 11AGOUT OF GARLIC ; OR, L’AIL A LA BORDE- LAISE. Divide some fine cloves of garlic, strip off the skin, and when all are ready, throw them into plenty of L146 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. IY^ boiling water slightly salted ; in five minutes drain this from them, and pour in as much more, which should also be quite boiling; continue to change it every five or six minutes until the garlic is quite tender; throw in a moderate proportion of salt the last time to give it the proper flavour. Drain it thoroughly, and serve it in the dish with roast mutton, or put it into good brown gravy, or white sauce for table. By changing very frequently the water in which it is boiled, the root will be deprived of its naturally pungent flavour and smell, and rendered extremely mild; when it is not wished to be quite so much so, change the water every ten minutes only. Garlic, 1 pint; 15 to 25 minutes or more. Water to be changed every 5 or 6 minutes ; or every 10 minutes when not wished so very mild. Gravy or sauce, 1 pint. MILD ESCHALOT SAUCE. Prepare and boil from half to a whole pint of escha- lots by the preceding receipt; unless very fine, they will be tender in about fifteen minutes, sometimes in less, in which case the water must be poured from them shortly after it has been changed for the second time. When grown in a suitable soil, and cultivated with care, the eschalots are sometimes treble the size that they are under other circumstances; and this difference must be allowed for in boiling them. Drain them well, and mix them with white sauce or gravy, or with good melted butter, and serve them very hot. A FINE SAUCE, OR PUREE OF VEGETABLE MARROW. Pare one or two half grown marrows and cut out all the seeds; take a pound of the vegetable, and slice it with one ounce of mild onion, into a pint of strong- veal broth or of pale gravy; stew them very softly for nearly or quite an hour; add salt, and cayenne, or white pepper when they are nearly done; press the whole through a fine and delicately clean hair sieve,CHAP. IV.] SAUCES. 147 beat it afresh, and stir to it when it boils, about the third of a pint of rich cream. Serve it with boiled chickens, stewed or boiled veal, lamb chops, or any other delicate meat. When to be served as a puree, an additional half pound of the vegetable must be used ; and it should be dished with small fried sippets round it. For a maigre dish, stew the marrow and onion quite tender in butter, and dilute them with half boiling- water and half cream. Vegetable marrow, 1 lb.; mild onion, 1 oz.; strong broth or pale gravy, 1 pint: nearly or quite 1 hour. Pepper or cayenne, and salt as needed; good cream from J to third of pint. For puree, J lb. more of marrow. EXCELLENT TURNIP, OR ARTICHOKE SAUCE FOR BOILED MEAT. Pare, slice, and boil quite tender, some finely-grained mild turnips; press the water from them thoroughly, and pass them through a sieve. Dissolve a slice of butter in a clean saucepan, and stir to it a large tea- spoonful of flour, or mix them smoothly together before they are put in, and shake the saucepan round until they boil; pour to them very gradually, nearly a pint of thin cream (or of good milk mixed with a portion, of cream), add the turnips with a half-teaspoonful or more of salt, and when the whole is well mixed and very hot, pour it over boiled mutton, veal, lamb, or poultry. There should be sufficient of the sauce to cover the meat entirely, and when properly made it improves greatly the appearance of a joint. A little cayenne tied in a muslin may be boiled in the milk before it is mixed with the turnips. Jerusalem arti- chokes make a more delicate sauce of this kind, even than turnips : the weight of both vegetables must be taken after they are pared. Pared turnips or artichokes, 1 lb.; fresh butter, 1 oz. and J ; flour, 1 large teaspoonful (twice as much if all milk be used) ; salt, \ teaspoonful or more; cream, or cream and milk mixed, from f to 1 pint.148 [CHAP. IV. MODERN COOKERY. OLIVE-SAUCE Remove the stones from some fine French or Italian olives by paring the fruit close to them, round and round in the form of a corkscrew : they will then resume their original shape when done. Weigh six ounces thus prepared, throw them into boiling water, let them blanch for five minutes, drain, and throw them into cold water, and leave them in it from half an hour to an hour, proportioning the time to their saltness; drain them well, and stew them gently from fifteen to twenty-five minutes in a pint of very rich brown gravy : add the juice of half a lemon, and serve the sauce very hot. Half this quantity will be enough for a small party. Olives, stoned, 6 ozs. ; rich gravy, 1 pint: 15 to 25 minutes. Juice, \ lemon. Ohs.—In France this sauce is served very commonly with ducks, and sometimes with beefsteaks, and stewed fowl. CELERY SAUCE. Slice the white part of from three to five heads of young tender celery; peel it if not very young, and boil it in salt and water for twenty minutes. If for white sauce, put the celery, after it has been well drained, into half a pint of veal broth or gravy, and let it stew until it is quite soft; then add an ounce and a half of butter, mixed with a dessertspoonful of flour, and a quarter-pint of thick cream, or the yolks of three eggs. The French, after boiling the celery, which they cut very small, for about twenty minutes, drain, and chop it; then put it with a slice of butter into a stew- pan, and season it with pepper, salt, and nutmeg; they keep these stirred over the fire for two or three minutes, and then dredge in a dessertspoonful of flour ; when this has lost its raw taste, they pour in a sufficiency of white gravy to moisten the celery, and to allow for twenty minutes’ longer boiling. A very good commonGIIAP. IV.] SAUCES. 149 celery sauce is made by simply stewing the celery, cut into inch-lengths, in butter, until it begins to be tender ; and then adding a spoonful of flour, which must be al- lowed to brown a little, and half a pint of good broth or beef gravy, with a seasoning of pepper or cayenne. Celery, 3 to 5 heads: 20 minutes. Yeal broth, or gravy, -1 pint: 20 to 40 minutes. Butter, 11 oz. ; flour, 1 dessertspoonful; cream, | pint, or 3 yolks of eggs. WHITE CHESNUT SAUCE, Strip the outer skin from six ounces of sound, sweet chesnuts, then throw them into boiling water, and let them simmer for two or three minutes, when the second skin will easily peel off. Add to them three quarters of a pint of good cold veal-gravy, and a few strips of lemon peel, and let them stew gently for an hour and a quarter. Press them with the gravy through a hair-sieve reversed, and placed over a deep dish or pan, as they are much more easily rubbed through thus than in the usual way: a wooden spoon should be used in preference to any other for the process. Add a little cayenne, and mace, some salt if needed, and about six tablespoonsful of rich cream. Keep the sauce stirred until it boils, and serve it immediately. Chesnuts without their rinds, 6 ozs. ; veal gravjr, J pint; rind of ^ lemon: 1^ hour. Salt; spice; cream, 6 tablespoonsful. Ohs.—This sauce may be served with turkey, with fowls, or with veal cutlets stewed. BROWN CHESNUT SAUCE. Substitute rich brown gravy for the veal-stock, omit the lemon-rind and cream ; heighten the seasonings and mix the chesnuts with a few spoonsful of Espagnole or highly-flavoured gravy after they are passed through the sieve.MODERN COOKERY. []CIIAP. IV. 150 SWEET PUDDING SAUCE. Boil together for fifteen minutes the thin rind of half a small lemon, an ounce and a half of fine sugar, and a win eg] assful of water ; then take out the lemon-peel, and mix very smoothly an ounce of butter with rather more than a half-teaspoonful of flour, stir them round in the sauce until it has boiled one minute; next add a wineglassful and a half of sherry or Madeira, or two- thirds of that quantity and a quarter-glass of brandy : when quite hot, serve the sauce. Port-wine sauce is made in the same way, with the addition of a dessertspoonful of lemon-juice, some grated nutmeg, and a little more sugar : orange-rind and juice may be used to give it flavour when preferred to lemon. Rind \ lemon; sugar, 1 oz. and \; water, 1 wine- glassful: 15 minutes. Butter, 1 oz.; flour, large -J teaspoonful: 1 minute. Wine, 1 wineglassful and \; or, 1 of wine, and J glass of brandy. PUNCH SAUCE FOR SWEET PUDDINGS. This is a favourite sauce with custard, plain bread, and plum-puddings. With two ounces of sugar and a quarter-pint of water, boil very gently the rind of half a small lemon, and somewhat less of orange-peel, from fifteen to twenty minutes ; strain out the rinds, thicken the sauce with an ounce and a half of butter and nearly a teaspoonful of dour, add a half-glass of brandy, the same of white wine, two thirds of a glass of rum, with the juice of half an orange, and rather less of lemon-juice : serve the sauce very hot, but do not allow’ it to boil after the spirit is stirred in. Sugar, 2 oz. ; water, J pint; lemon and orange-rind : 14 to 20 minutes. Butter, 1J oz.; flour, 1 teaspoonful; brandy and white wine each | wineglassful; rum, two thirds of glassful ; ^ orange and lemon-juice.151 SAUCES. CHAP. IV.] COMMON PUDDING SAUCE. Sweeten a quarter-pint of good melted butter with an ounce and a half of sugar, and add to it gradually a couple of glasses of wine; stir it until it is on the point of boiling. Lemon-grate, or nutmeg, can be added at pleasure. A DELICIOUS GERMAN PUDDING SAUCE. Dissolve in half a pint of Sherry or Madeira, from three to four ounces of fine sugar, but do not allow the v/ine to boil; pour it hot to the well-beaten yolks of six fresh eggs, and mill the sauce over a gentle fire until it is well thickened, and highly frothed; pour it over a plum, or any other kind of sweet boiled pudding, of which it much improves the appearance. Half the quantity will be sufficient for one of moderate size. A small machine, resembling a chocolate mill, is used in Germany for frothing this sauce; but a couple of silver forks, fastened together at the handles, will serve for the purpose, on an emergency. We recommend the addition of a dessert- spoonful of strained lemon-juice, to the wane. For large pudding, Sherry or Madeira, J pint; fine sugar, 3 to 4 ozs.; yolks of eggs, 6; lemon juice (if added], 1 dessertspoonful. Obs.—The safer plan with sauces liable to curdle, is to thicken them always in a jar, placed in a saucepan of water; when this is not done, they should be held over the fire, but never placed upon it.' PARSLEY GREEN, FOR COLOURING SAUCES. Gather a quantity of young parsley, strip it from the stalks, wash it very clean, shake it as dry as possible in a cloth, pound it in a mortar, press all the juice closely from it through a hair sieve reversed, and put it into a clean jar; set it into a pan of boiling water, and in about three minutes, if gently simmered, the juice will be poached sufficiently; lay it then upon a clean sieve to drain, and it will be ready for use.[[CHAP. IY. 152 MODERN COOKERY. TO CRISP PARSLEY. Pick some brandies of young parsley, wash them well, drain them from the water, and swing them in a clean cloth until they are quite dry; place them on a sheet of writing-paper in a Dutch-oven, before a brisk fire, and keep them frequently turned until they are quite crisp. They will be done in from six to eight minutes. PRIED PARSLEY. When the parsley has been prepared as for crisping, and is quite dry, throw it into plenty of lard or butter, that is on the point of boiling; take it up wdtli a skimmer the instant it is crisp, drain it on a cloth spread upon a sieve reversed and placed before the fire. ANCHOVY BUTTER. (Excellent,) Scrape the skin quite clean from a dozen fine mellow anchovies, free the flesh entirely from the bones, and pound it as smooth as possible in a mortar ; rub it through the back of a hair-sieve with a wooden spoon; wipe out the mortar, and put back the anchovies with three quarters of a pound of very fresh butter, a small half- saltspoonful of cayenne, and more than twice as much of finely grated nutmeg, and freshly pounded mace ; and beat these together until they are thoroughly blended. If to serve cold at table, mould the butter in small shapes, and turn it out. A little rose-pink (which is sold at the chemists’) is sometimes used to give it a fine colour, but it must be sparingly used, or it will impart an unpleasant flavour: it should be well- pounded, and very equally mixed with it. For kitchen use, press the butter down into jars or pattypans, and keep it in a cool place. Fine anchovies, 12; butter, j lb.; cayenne, small \ saltspoonful; nutmeg and mace, each more than twice as much ; rose-pink (if used), \ teaspoonful.SAUCES. CHAP. IV.] 153 Ohs.—This proportion differs from potted anchovies, only in the larger proportion of butter mixed with the fish, and the milder seasoning of spice. It will assist to form an elegant dish if made into pats, and stamped with a tasteful impression, then placed alternately with pats of lobster butter, and decorated with light foliage. It is generally eaten with much relish when carefully compounded, and makes excellent sandwiches. To convert it into a good fish sauce, mix two or three ounces of it with a teaspoonful of flour and a few spoonsful of cold water, or pale veal stock, and keep them constantly stirred until they boil. The butter should not be moulded directly it is taken from the mortar, as it is then very soft from the beating. It should be placed until it is firm in a very cool place; or over ice, when it can be done conveniently. TARTAR MUSTARD. Rub four ounces of the best Durham mustard very smooth with a full teaspoonful of salt, and wet it by degrees with strong horseradish vinegar; add a dessert- spoonful of cayenne, or of Chili vinegar, and one or two of tarragon vinegar, when its flavour is not disliked. A quarter-pint of vinegar poured boiling upon an ounce of scraped horse-radish, and left for one night, closely covered, will be ready to use for this mustard, but it will be better for standing two or three days. Durham mustard, 4 ozs.; salt, large teaspoonful; cayenne, or Chili vinegar, 1 dessertspoonful; horse- radish vinegar, enough to mix it. Ohs.-—'This is an exceedingly pungent compound, but has many admirers. ANOTHER TARTAR MUSTARD. Mix the salt and mustard smoothly, with equal parts of horseradish vinegar, and of Chili vinegar. Mustard made by these receipts will keep long, if put into jars or bottles, and closely|stopped. Cucumber, eschalot, or any other of the flavoured vinegars for which we have given154 MODERN COOKERY. [chap. iy. receipts, may in turn be used for it, and mushroom, gherkin, or India pickle-liquor, likewise. MILD MUSTARD. Mustard for instant use should be mixed with milk? to which a spoonful or two of very thin cream may be added. MUSTARD THE COMMON WAY. The great art of mixing mustard, is to have it perfectly smooth, and of a proper consistency. The liquid with which it is moistened should be added to it in small quantities, and the mustard should be well rubbed, and beaten with a spoon. Mix a half-teaspoonfu! of salt with two ounces of the flour of mustard, and stir to them by degrees, sufficient boiling water to reduce it to the appearance of a thick batter; do not put it into the mustard-glass till cold. Some persons like a half- teaspoonful of sugar, in the finest powder, mixed with it. It ought to be sufficiently diluted always to drop easily from the spoon. FRENCH BATTER. (For frying vegetables, and for apple, peach, or orange fritters.) Cut a couple of ounces of good butter into small bits, pour on it less than a quarter-pint of boiling water, and when it is dissolved, add three quarters of a pint of cold water, so that the whole shall not be quite milk wTarm; mix it then by degrees, and very smoothly, with twelve ounces of fine dry flour, and a small pinch of salt, if the batter be for fruit-fritters, but with more if for meat or vegetables. Just before it is used, stir into it the whites of two eggs beaten to a solid froth; but previously to this, add a little water should it appear too thick, as some flour requires more liquid than other, to bring it to the proper consistency. Butter, 2 ozs.; water, from f pint to nearly 1 pint;CHAP. IV.]] 155 SAUCES. little salt; flour, J lb.; whites of two eggs, beaten to snow. TO PREPARE BREAD FOR FRYING FISH, &C. Cut thick slices from the middle of a loaf of light <D bread, pare the crust entirely from them, and dry them gradually in a cool oven until they are crisp quite through ; let them become cold, then roll or beat them into fine crumbs, and keep them in a dry place for use. To strew over hams or cheeks of bacon, the bread should be left all night in the oven, which should be sufficiently heated to brown, as well as to harden it: it ought indeed to be entirely converted into equally- coloured crust. It may be sifted through a dredging- box on to the hams, after it has been reduced almost to powder. BROWNED FLOUR FOR THICKENING SOUPS AND GRAVIES. Spread it on a tin or dish, and colour it, without burning, in a gentle oven, or before the fire in a Dutch or American oven: turn it often, or the edges will be too much browned before the middle is enough so. This, blended with butter, makes a convenient thicken- ing for soups or gravies, of which it is desirable to deepen the colour; and it requires less time and atten- tion than the French roux of page 114. FRIED BREAD-CRUMBS. Grate lightly into very fine crumbs four ounces of stale bread, and shake them through a cullender, with- out rubbing or touching them with the hands. Dissolve two ounces of fresh butter in a frying-pan, throw in the crumbs, and stir them constantly over a moderate fire, until they are all of a clear gold-colour; lift them out with a skimmer, spread them on a soft cloth laid upon a sieve reversed, and dry them before the fire. They may be more delicately prepared by browning them in a gentle oven without the addition of butter. Bread, 4 ozs.; butter, 2 ozs.MODERN COOKERY. [chap, V. 156 FRIED BREAD FOR GARNISHING. Cut the crumb of a stale loaf in slices a quarter- inch thick; form them into diamonds, half-diamonds, or shape them with a paste-cutter in any other way; fry them in fresh butter, some of a very pale brown, and others a deeper colour: when nicely dressed and dried, place these alternately round the dish that is to be garnished.—They may be made to adhere to the edge of the dish, when they are required for ornament only, by means of a little flour and white of egg brushed over the side that is placed on it: this must be allowed to dry before the dish is served.

V.] STORE SAUCES. 157 soups, gravies, and made dishes; but unless the con- sumption be considerable, they should not bo over- abundantly provided, as few of them are improved by age, and many are altogether spoiled by long keeping, especially if they be not perfectly secured from the air by sound corking, or if stored where there is the slight- est degree of damp. To prevent loss, they should he examined at short intervals, and at the first appearance of mould or fermentation, such as will bear the process should be re-boiled, and put into clean bottles. This is often especially needful for mushroom catsup when it has been made in a wet season. This, with essence of anchovies, walnut catsup, Harvey’s sauce, cavice, lemon- pickle, Chili, cucumber, and eschalot vinegar, will be all that is commonly needed for family use; but there is at the present day an extensive choice of these stores on sale, some of which are excellent. CHETNEY SAUCE. (Bengal Receipt.') Stone four ounces of good raisins, and chop them fine, with half a pound of crabs, sour apples, unripe bullaces, or of any other hard acid fruit. Take four ounces of coarse brown sugar, two of powdered ginger, and the same quantity of salt and cayenne pep- per ; grind these ingredients separately in a mortar, as fine as possible; then pound the fruits well, and mix the spices with them, one by one; beat them together till they are perfectly blended, and add gradually as much vinegar as will make the sauce of the consistency of thick cream. Put it into a bottle with an ounce of garlic, divided into cloves, and cork it tightly. Stoned raisins, 4 ozs.; crabs, or other acid fruit, | lb.; coarse sugar, 4 ozs.; powdered158 [CHAP. V.' MODERN COOKERY. ginger, 2 ozs.; salt, 2 ozs.; cayenne-pepper, 2 ozs.; gar- lic, 1 oz.; vinegar, enough to dilute it properly. Obs.—This favourite oriental sauce is compounded in a great variety of ways ; but some kind of acid fruit is essential to it. The mango is used in India ; here the bullaces in an unripe state answer very well. Goose- berries also, while still hard and green, are some- times used for it ; and ripe red chilies and tomatas are mixed with the other ingredients. The sauce keeps better if it be exposed to a gentle degree of heat for a week or two, either by the side of the fire, or in a full southern aspect in the sun. In this case it must be put into a jar or bottles, and well secured from the air. Half a pound of gooseberries, or of these and tamarinds from the shell, and green apples mixed, and the same weight of salt, stored raisins, brown sugar, powdered ginger, chilies, and garlic, with a pint and a half of vinegar, and the juice of three large lemons, will make another genuine Bengal chetney. MUSHROOM CATSUP. Cut the ends of the stalks from two gallons of freshly- gathered mushrooms (the large flaps are best for this purpose, but they should not be worm - eaten) ; break them into a deep earthen pan, and strew amongst them three quarters of a pound of salt, reserving the larger portion of it for the top. Let them stand for three, or even four days, and stir them gently once every four and twenty hours; then drain off the liquor without pressing the mushrooms; strain and measure it; put it into a very clean stew-pan, and boil it quickly till reduced nearly or quite half. For every quart, allow half an ounce of whole black pepper, and a drachm of mace ; or, instead of the pepper, a quarter teaspoonful (ten grains) of good cayenne ; pour the catsup into a clean jug or jar, lay a folded cloth over it, and keep it in a cool place until the following day ; pour it gently159 CHAP. V.] STORE SAUCES. from the sediment; put it into small bottles, cork them well, and rosin them down. A teaspoonful of salad-oil may be poured into each bottle before it is corked, the better to exclude the air from the catsup: it must be kept in a dry cool place. Mushrooms, 2 gallons; salt, § lb.; to macerate three or four days. To each quart of liquor, J oz. black pepper, or quarter-teaspoonful • cayenne; and 1 drachm mace : to be reduced half. Obs. 1.—Catsup made thus will not be too salt, nor will the flavour of the mushrooms be overpowered by that of the spices; of which a larger quantity, and a greater variety, can be used at will. Obs. 2.—After the mushrooms have stood for three or four days, as we have directed, the whole may be turned into a large stewpan, and brought slowly to a boil, and simmered for a few minutes before the liquor is strained off. We think the catsup keeps rather better when this is done, but we recommend only just suffi- cient simmering to preserve the catsup well. When the mushrooms are crushed, or mashed, as some authors direct, the liquor will necessarily be very thick; it is better to proceed as above, and then to boil the squeez- ings of the mushrooms with the sediment of the catsup, and sufficient cloves, pepper, allspice, and ginger, to flavour it highly : this second catsup will be found very useful to mix with common thickened sauces, hashes, and stews. In some seasons it is necessary to boil the catsup with the spice a second time after it has been kept three or four months : this, by way of precaution, can always be done, but it had better then be put into large bottles in the first instance, and stored in the small ones afterwards.

The vinegar in which walnuts have been pickled, when they have remained in it a year, will generally answer all the purposes for which this catsup is required, particularly if it be drained from them and boiled a few minutes, with a little additional spice, and a few escha- lots ; but where the vinegar is objected to, it may be made either by boiling the expressed juice of young walnuts for an hour with six ounces of fine anchovies, four ounces of eschalots, half an ounce of black pepper, a quarter-ounce of cloves, and a drachm of mace, to every quart; or, as follows :— Pound in a mortar a hundred young walnuts, strewing amongst them as they are done half 'a pound of salt ; then pour to them a quart of strong vinegar, and let them stand until they have become quite black, keeping them stirred three or four times a day; next add a quart of strong old beer, and boil the whole together for ten minutes ; strain it, and let it remain until the next day; then pour it off dear from the sediment, add to it half a pound of anchovies, one large head of garlic bruised, half an ounce of nutmegs bruised, the same quantity of cloves and black pepper, and two drachms of mace: boil these together for half an hour, and the following day bottle and cork the catsup well. It will keep for a dozen years. Many persons add to it, before it is boiled, a bottle of port-wine; and others recommend a large bunch of sweet herbs to be put in with the spice. 1st. Recipe.

Either divide six small lemons into quarters, remove all the pips that are in sight, and strew three ounces of salt upon them, and keep them turned in it for a week ; or, merely make deep incisions in them, and proceed as directed for pickled lemons. When they have* stood in a warm place for eight days, put into a stone jar two ounces and a half of finely scraped horseradish, and two ounces of eschalots, or one and a half of garlic; to these add the lemons with all their liquor, and pour on them a pint and a half of boiling vinegar in which half an ounce of bruised ginger, a quarter-ounce of whole white pepper, and two blades of mace have been simmered for two or three minutes. The pickle will be fit for use in two or three months, but may stand four or five before it is strained off. Small lemons, 6 ; salt, 3 ozs. : 8 days. Horseradish, 2-| ozs.; eschalots, 2 ozs., or garlic li oz.; vinegar, 1 pint and \ ; ginger, \ oz.; whole white pepper, \ oz.; mace, 2 blades: 3 to 6 months. PONTAC CATSUP FOR FISH. On one pint of ripe elderberries stripped from the stalks pour three-quarters of a pint of boiling vinegar, and let it stand in a cool oven all night; the next day strain off the liquid without pressure, and boil it for five minutes with a half-teaspoonful of salt, a small race of ginger, a blade of mace, forty corns of pepper, twelve cloves, and four eschalots. Bottle it with the spice when it is quite cold. BOTTLED TOMATAS, OR TOMATA CATSUP. Cut half a peck of ripe tomatas into quarters; lay them on dishes, and sprinkle over them half a pound of salt. The next day drain the juice from them through a hair-sieve into a stewpah, and boil it half an hour with three dozens of small capsicums, and half a pound of eschalots ; then add the tomatas, which should beCHAP.

Obs.—This receipt has been kindly contributed by a person who makes by it every year large quantities of the catsup, which is considered excellent : for sauce, it must be mixed with gravy, or melted butter. We have not ourselves been able to make trial of it. EPICUREAN SAUCE. Mix well together, by shaking them in about a quarter pint of Indian soy, half a pint of Chili vinegar, half a pint of walnut catsup, and a pint and a half of the best mushroom catsup. These proportions make an excellent sauce, either to mix with melted butter, and to serve with fish, or to add to different kinds of gravy ; but they can be varied, or added to, at pleasure. Indian soy, J pint; Chili vinegar, \ pint; walnut catsup, \ pint; mushroom catsup, 11 pint. Obs.—A pint of port wine, a few eschalots, and some thin strips of lemon-rind will convert this into an admirable store-sauce. Less soy would adapt it better to some tastes. TARRAGON VINEGAR. Gather the tarragon just before it blossoms, which will be late in July, or early in August; strip it from the larger stalks, and put it into small stone jars or wide-necked bottles, and in doing this twist some of the branches so as to bruise the leaves and wring them asunder ; then pour in sufficient distilled vinegar to cover the tarragon; let it infuse for two months, or more : it will take no harm even by standing all the winter. When it is poured off strain it very clear, put it into small dry bottles, and cork them well. Sweet164< MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. V. basil vinegar is made in exactly the same way, but it should not be left on the leaves more than three weeks. The jars or bottles should be filled to the neck with the tarragon before the vinegar is added: we prefer for this, as well as for many other preparations, good pale white wine vinegar to the distilled. The flavour of the tarragon is strong and peculiar, but to many tastes very agreeable : it imparts quite a foreign character to the dishes for which it is used. GREEN MINT VINEGAR. t Pick and slightly chop, or bruise, freshly-gathered mint, and put it into bottles; fill them nearly to the necks, and add vinegar as for tarragon : in forty days, strain it off, and bottle it for use. The mint itself, ready minced for sauce, will keep well in vinegar, though the colour will not be very good. CUCUMBER VINEGAR. First wipe, and then, without paring, slice into a jar some young and quickly-grown cucumbers; pour on them as much boiling vinegar as will cover them well, with a teaspoonful of salt, and two-thirds as much of pepper- corns to the pint and a half of vinegar: it may remain on the cucumbers for a month. Some persons like a mild onion or two sliced in with them. CELERY VINEGAR. Put into a wide-necked bottle or pickle-jar eight ounces of the white part of the root and stalks of fine fresh celery cut in slices, and pour on it a pint of boiling vinegar; when a little cool, cork it down, and in three weeks it will be ready to strain, and bottle for keeping. Half an ounce of bruised celery-seed will answer the same purpose, when the root cannot be obtained. This is an agreeable addition to a salad, when its flavour is much liked ; a lialf-teaspoonful of salt should be boiled in it.CHAP. V.] STORE-SAUCES. 165 ESCHALOT, OR GARLIC VINEGAR. On from four to six ounces of eschalots, or on two of garlic, peeled, and bruised, pour a quart of the best vinegar ; stop the jar or bottle close ; and in a fortnight or three w^eeks the vinegar may be strained off for use : a few drops will give a sufficient flavour to a sauce, or a tureen of gravy. Eschalots, 4 to 6 ozs. ; or, garlic, 2 to 4 ozs. ; vinegar, 1 quart: 15 to 21 days. Obs.—These roots may be used in smaller or in larger proportion, as a slighter or a stronger flavour of them is desired : and may remain longer in the vinegar without any detriment to it. ESCHALOT WINE. This is a far more useful preparation even than the preceding one, since it can be used to impart the flavour of the eschalot to dishes for which acid is not required. Peel, and slice, or bruise, four ounces of eschalots, put them into a bottle, and add to them a pint of sherry; in a fortnight pour off the wine, and should it not be strongly flavoured with the eschalot, steep in it two ounces more, for another fortnight : a half-teaspoonful of cayenne may be added at first. The bottle should be shaken occasionally, while the eschalots are infusing, but should remain undisturbed for the last two or three days, that the wine may be clear when it is poured off to bottle for keeping. Sweet-basil wine is made by steeping the fresh leaves of the herb in wine, from ten to fifteen days. Eschalots, 4 ozs.; sherry, 1 pint: 15 days, or more. HORSERADISH VINEGAR. On four ounces of scraped horseradish pour a quart of boiling vinegar, and cover it down closely : it will be ready for use in three or four days, but may remain for weeks, or months, before the vinegar is poured off. An ounce of minced eschalot may be substituted for one of the horseradish, if the flavour be liked.166 [chap. Y. MODERN COOKERY. CAYENNE VINEGAR. Put from a quarter to half an ounce of the best cay- enne pepper into a bottle, and pour on it a pint of pale vinegar. Cork it closely, and shake it well every two or three days. It may remain any length of time before it is poured off, but will very soon be ready for use. From being so extremely pungent, it is, for some pur- poses, preferable to Chili vinegar, as the cayenne sea- soning can be given with less of acid. It may be made of any degree of strength. We warn the young house- keeper against using essence of cayenne (or cayenne steeped in brandy) for flavouring any dishes, as the brandy is very perceptible always, and gives an exceed- ingly coarse taste. Good cayenne pepper, i to \ oz.; vinegar, 1 pint : infuse from 2 weeks to 12 months. LEMON BRANDY. (For flavouring sweet dishes.) Fill any sized wide-necked bottle lightly with the very thin rinds of fresh lemons, and cover them with good brandy; let them remain three weeks, then strain off the spirit and keep it well corked for use : a few apricot-kernels blanched and infused with the lemon- rind will give an agreeable flavour. ANOTHER STORE FLAVOURING FOR PUDDINGS OR CAKES. Rasp on from two to four ounces of sugar the rinds of a couple of fine lemons, reduce the lumps to powder, and add it gradually to, and pound it with, an ounce of bitter almonds, blanched and wiped very dry. When these have been beaten to a fine paste, and the whole is well blended, press the mixture into a small pan, tie a paper over, and keep it for use. The proportions can be varied at pleasure, and the quantities increased : from a teaspoonful to three times as much can be mixed with the ingredients for a pudding. Cakes require more in proportion to their bulk.STORE SAUCES. 107 CHAP. V.] Rinds large lemons, 2; sugar, 2 to 4 ozs.; bitter almonds, 1 oz* DRIED MUSHROOMS. Peel small, sound, freshly-gathered flaps, cut off the stems, and scrape out the fur entirely; then arrange the mushrooms singly on tins or dishes, and dry them as gra- dually as possible in a gentle oven. Put them, when they are done, into tin canisters, and store them where they will be secure from damp. French cooks give them a single boil in water, from which they then are well drained, and dried, as usual. When wanted for table, they should be put into cold gravy, slowly heated, and gently simmered, until they are tender. MUSHROOM POWDER. AVhen the mushrooms have been prepared with great nicety, and dried, as in the foregoing receipt, pound them to a very fine powder, sift it, and put it imme- diately into small and perfectly dry bottles; cork and seal them without delay, for if the powder be long ex- posed to the air, so as to imbibe any humidity, or if it be not well secured from it in the bottles, it will be likely to become putrid : much of that which is pur- chased, even at the best Italian warehouses, is found to be so, and, as it is sold at a very high price, it is a great economy, as well as a surer plan, to have it carefully prepared at home. It is an exceedingly useful store, and an elegant addition to many dishes and sauces. To insure its being good, the mushrooms should be gathered in dry weather, and, if any addition of spices be made to the powder (some persons mix with it a seasoning of mace and cayenne), they should be put into the oven for a while before they are used : but even these precautions will not be sufficient, unless the powder be stored in a very dry place after it is bottled. A teaspoonful of it, with a quarter-pint of strong veal-gravy, and as much cream, and a small dessertspoonful of flour, will make an excellent bechamel or white sauce.168 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. Y. POTATOE FLOUR. (Fecule de Pommes de ter re). Grate into a large vessel full of cold water, six pounds of sound mealy potatoes, and stir them well together. In six hours pour off the water, and add fresh, stirring the mixture well; repeat this process every three or four hours during the day, change the water at night, and the next morning pour it off; put two or three quarts more to the potatoes, and turn them directly into a hair-sieve, set over a pan to receive the flour, which may then be washed through the sieve, by pouring water to it. Let it settle in the pan, drain off the water, spread the potatoe-sediment on dishes, dry it in a slow oven, sift it, and put it, into bottles or jars, and cork or cover them closely. The flour thus made will be beautifully white, and perfectly tasteless. It will remain good for years, TO MAKE FLOUR OF RICE. Take any quantity of whole rice, wash it thoroughly, changing the water several times ; drain and press it in a cloth, then spread it on a dish, and dry it perfectly; beat it in a mortar to a smooth powder, and sift it through a fine sieve. Whenvused to thicken soup or sauces, mix it with a small quantity of cold water or broth, and pour it to them while they are boiling. This flour when newly made, is of much purer flavour than any usually prepared for sale. POWDER OF SAVOURY HERBS. All herbs that are to be dried for storing should be gathered in fine weather; cleared from dirt and decayed leaves; and dried quickly, but without scorching, in a Dutch-oven before the fire, or in any other that is not too much heated. The leaves should then be stripped from the stalks, pounded, sifted, and closely corked in separate bottles; or several kinds may be mixed and pounded together for the convenience of seasoning in an instant gravies, soups, forcemeats, and made dishes - appropriate spices, celery-seed, and dried lemon-peel, all in fine powder, can be added to these herbs.169 CHAP. VI.] FORCEMEATS. THE DOCTOR’S ZEST. Pound to the finest powder, separately, eight ounces of basket salt, a quarter-ounce of cayenne, a drachm of mace, and of nutmeg ; of cloves and pimento, a drachm and a half each ; then add the other ingredients, one by one, to the salt, and pound them together till they are perfectly well blended. Put the zest into wide-mouthed phials, and cork them tightly. Half an ounce of mush- room-powder, and a drachm of dried lemon-peel greatly improves this mixture. CHAPTER YI. FORCEMEATS. GENERAL REMARKS. The coarse and un- palatable compounds so constantly met with under the denomina- tion of forcemeat, even at tables otherwise tolerably w^ell served, show with how little attention they are commonly prepared. Many very indifferent cooks pique themselves on never doing any thing by rule, and the consequence of their throwing together at random (or u by guess’’ as they call it) the ingredients which ought to be proportioned with exceeding delicacy and exactness is, repeated failure in all they attempt to do. Long experience, and a very correct eye may, it is true, enable a person to dispense occasionally with weights and measures, without hazard-MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. YI. 170 ing the success of their operations; but it is an experi- ment which the learner will do better to avoid. A large marble or Wedgwood mortar is indispensable in making all the finer kinds of forcemeat; and equally so indeed for many other purposes in cookery; no kitchen, therefore, should be without one; and for whatever preparation it may be used, the pounding should be continued with patience and perseverance until not a single lump nor fibre be perceptible in the mass of the articles beaten together. This particularly applies to potted meats, which should resemble the smoothest paste; as well as to several varieties of force- meat. Of these last it should be observed, that such as are made by the French method (see quenelles) are the most appropriate for an elegant dinner, either to serve in soups or to fill boned poultry of any kind; but when their exceeding lightness, which to foreigners constitutes one of their great excellences, is objected to, it may be remedied by substituting dry crumbs of bread for the panada, and pounding a small quantity of the lean of a boiled ham, with the other ingredients ; but this should be done only for the balls. No particular herb or spice should be allowed to predominate powerfully in these compositions ; but the whole of the seasonings should be taken in such quan- tity only as will produce an agreeable savour when they are blended together. NO. 1. GOOD COMMON FORCEMEAT, FOR ROAST VEAL, TURKEYS, &C. Grate very lightly into exceedingly fine crumbs, four ounces of the inside of a stale loaf, and mix thoroughly with it, a quarter-ounce of lemon-rind pared as thin as possible, and minced extremely small; the same quan- tity of savoury herbs, of which two-thirds should be parsley, and one-third thyme,—likewise finely minced, a little grated nutmeg, a half-teaspoonful of salt, and as much common pepper or cayenne as will season the forcemeat sufficiently.

It is usual to chop the lemon-rind, but we prefer it lightly grated on a fine grater. It should always be fresh for the purpose, or it will be likely to impart a very unpleasant flavour to the forcemeat. Half the rind of a moderate-sized lemon will be sufficient for this quantity; which for a large turkey must be increased one-half. Bread-crumbs, 4 ozs.; lemon-rind, \ oz.

Obs.—This, to our taste, is a much nicer and more delicate forcemeat than that which is made with chopped suet, and we would recommend it for trial in preference. Any variety of herb nr spice may be used to give it flavour, and a little minced onion or eschalot can be added to it also ; but these last do not appear to us suited to the meats for whicli the forcemeat is more particularly intended* Half an ounce of the butter may be omitted on ordinary occasions; and a portion of marjoram or of sweet basil may take the place of part of the thyme and parsley when preferred to them. NO. 2. ANOTHER GOOD COMMON FORCEMEAT. Add to four ounces of bread-crumbs two of the lean of a boiled ham, quite free from sinew, and very finely minced; two of good butter, a dessertspoonful of herbs, chopped small, some lemon-grate, nutmeg, a little salt, a good seasoning of pepper or cayenne, and one whole egg, or the yolks of two. This may be fried in balls of moderate size, for five minutes, to serve witli roast veal, or it may be put into the joint in the usual way. Bread-crumbs, 4 ozs.; lean of ham, 2 ozs.; butter, 2 ozs. ; minced herbs, 1 dessertspoonful; lemon-grate, 1 teaspoonful; nutmeg, mace, and cayenne, together, 1 small teaspoonful; little salt; I whole egg, or yolks of 2.[CHAP.

Mix well together six ounces of fine stale crumbs, with an equal weight of beef-kidney suet, chopped extremely small, a large dessertspoonful of parsley, mixed with a little lemon-thyme, a teaspoonful of salt, a quarter one of cayenne, and a saltspoonful or rather more of mace and nutmeg together; work these up with three un- beaten egg-yolks, and three teaspoonsful of milk ; then put the forcemeat into a large mortar, and pound it perfectly smooth. Take it out, and let it remain in a cool place for half an hour at least before it is used, then roll it into balls, if it be wanted to serve in that form, flour and fry them gently from seven to eight minutes, and dry them well before they are dished. Beef-suet finely minced, 6 ozs. ; bread-crumbs, 6 ozs.; parsley, mixed with little thyme, 1 large dessertspoonful; salt, 1 teaspoonful; mace, large saltspoonful, and one- fourth as much cayenne; unbeaten egg-yolks, 3; milk, 3 teaspoonsful: well pounded.

NO. 4, COMMON SUET FORCEMEAT. Beef-suet is commonly used in the composition of this kind of forcemeat, but we think that veal kidney- suet, when it could be obtained, would have a better effect; though the reader will easily comprehend that it is scarcely possible for us to have every variety of every receipt which we insert put to the test; in some cases we are compelled merely to suggest what appear to us likely to be improvements.

Should more liquid be required, the yolk of another egg, or a spoonful or two of milk, may be used. Half this quantity will be sufficient for a small joint of veal, or for a dozen balls, which, when it is more convenient to serve it in that form, may be fried or browned beneath the roast, and then dished round it, though this last is not a very refined mode of dressing them. From eight to ten minutes will fry them well. NO. 5. OYSTER FORCEMEAT. Open carefully a dozen fine plump natives, take off the beards, strain their liquor, and rince the oysters in it. Grate four ounces of the crumb of a stale loaf into fine light crumbs, mince the oysters, but not too small, and mix them with the bread; add an ounce and a half of good butter, broken into minute bits, the grated rind of half a small lemon, a small saltspoonful of pounded mace, some cayenne, a little salt, and a large teaspoonful of parsley: mix these ingredients well, and work them together with the unbeaten yolk of one egg, and a little of the oyster liquor, the remainder of which can be added to the sauce which usually accompanies this forcemeat. Oysters, 1 dozen; bread crumbs, 4 ozs; butter, 1^ oz.; rind \ small lemon; mace, 1 saltspoonful; some cayenne and salt; minced parsley, 1 large teaspoonful; yolk 1 egg; oyster-liquor, 1 dessertspoonful: rolled into balls, and fried from 7 to 10 minutes, or poached from 5 to 6 minutes.

MUSHROOM FORCEMEAT. Cut closely off the stems of some small, just-opened mushrooms, peel them, and take out the fur. Dissolve an ounce and a half of good butter in a saucepan, throw them into it with a little cayenne, and a slight sprink- ling of mace, and stew them softly, keeping them well shaken, from five to seven minutes; then turn them into a dish, spread them over it, and raise one end, that the liquid may drain from them. When they are quite cold, mince, and then mix them with four ounces of fine bread-crumbs, an ounce and a half of good butter, and part of that in which they were stewed, should the forcemeat appear too moist to admit of the whole, as the yolk of one egg, at the least, must be added, to bind the ingredients together: strew in a saltspoonful of salt, a third as much of cayenne, and about the same quantity of mace and nutmeg, with a teaspoonful of grated lemon-peel. The seasonings must be rather sparingly used, that the flavour of the mushrooms may not be overpowered by them. Mix the whole thoroughly with the unbeaten yolk of one egg, or of two, and use the forcemeat poached in small balls for soup, or fried and served in the dish with roast fowls, or round minced veal; or to fill boiled fowls, partridges, or turkeys. Small mushrooms, peeled and trimmed, 4 ozs.; butter, 1 i oz. ; slight sprinkling mace and cayenne: 5 to 7 minutes. Mushrooms, minced ; bread-crumbs, 4 ozs.; butter, 1J oz.

The first receipt of this chapter will be found very good for hare, without any variation; but the liver boiled for five minutes, and finely minced, may be added to it, when it is thought an improvement: another half ounce of butter and a small portion more of egg will then be required. A couple of ounces of rasped bacon, and a glass of port-wine are sometimes recommended for this forcemeat, but we think it is better without them, especially when slices of bacon are used to line the hare. A flavouring of minced onion, or eschalot can be added, when the taste is in its favour; or the forcemeat No. 3 may be substituted for this altogether. NO. 9. ONION AND SAGE STUFFING, FOR PORK, GEESE, OR DUCKS. Boil three large onions from ten to fifteen minutes, chop them small, and mix with them an equal quantity of bread-crumbs, a heaped tablespoonful of minced sage, an ounce of butter, a half saltspoonful of pepper, and twice as much of salt, and put them into the body of the goose ; part of the liver, boiled for two or three minutes, and shred fine, is sometimes added to these, and the whole is bound together with an egg yolk or two; but they are quite as frequently served without. The onions can be used raw, when their very strong flavour is not objected to, but the odour of the whole dish will then be somewhat overpowering. Large onions, 3; boiled 20 to 30 minutes.

FORCEMEAT BALLS FOR MOCK TURTLE SOUPS. The French forcemeat, No. 17 of the present chapter, is the most elegant and appropriate forcemeat to serve in mock turtle, but a more solid and highly seasoned one is usually added to it in this country. In very common cookery the ingredients are merely chopped small and mixed together with a moistening of eggs ; but when the trouble of pounding and blending them properly is objected to, we would recommend the common veal forcemeat, No. 1, in preference, as the undressed veal and suet, when merely minced, do not produce a good effect. Four ounces each of these, with an ounce or so of the lean of a boiled ham, and three ounces of bread crumbs, a large dessertspoonful of minced parsley, a small portion of thyme, or marjoram, a saltspoonful of white pepper, twice as much salt, or more, a little cay- enne, half a small nutmeg, and a couple of eggs, well mixed with a fork first, to separate the meat, and after the moistening is added, with the fingers, then rolled into balls, and boiled in a little soup for twelve minutes, is the manner in which it is prepared; but the reader will find the following receipt very superior to it:— Rasp, that is to say, scrape with a knife, clear from the fibre, four ounces of veal, which should be cut into thick slices, and taken quite free from skin and fat; chop it fine, and then pound it as smoothly as possible in a large mortar, with three ounces of the rasped fat of an unboiled ham, of good flavour, or of the finest bacon, and one of butter, two ounces of bread-crumbs, a table- spoonful of the lean of a boiled ham, should it be at hand, a good seasoning of cayenne, nutmeg, and mace, mixed together, a heaped dessertspoonful of minced herbs, and the yolks of two eggs; poach a small bit when it is mixed, and add any further seasoning it may re- quire ; and when it is of good flavour, roll it into balls of moderate size, and boil them twelve minutes; then drain and slip them into the soup. No forcemeat should be boiled in the soup itself, on account of the fat whichFORCEMEATS. CHAP. VI.] 177 would escape from it in the process : a little stock should be reserved for the purpose. Very common :—Lean of neck of veal, 4 ozs. ; beef- kidney suet, 4 ozs., both finely chopped; bread-crumbs, 3 ozs. ; minced parsley, large dessertspoonful; thyme or marjoram, small teaspoonful; lean of boiled ham, 1 to 2 ozs.; white pepper, 1 saltspoonful; salt, twice as much ; J small nutmeg; eggs, 2 : in balls 12 minutes.

Take out the yolks, and pound them smoothly with the beaten yolk of one raw egg, or more, if re- quired ; add a little salt and cayenne, roll the mixture into very small balls, and boil them for two minutes. Half a teaspoonful of flour is sometimes worked up with the eggs. Hard yolks of eggs, 4 ; 1 raw; little salt, cayenne : 2 minutes. NO. 13. BRAIN CAKES. Wash and soak the brains well in cold water, and afterwards in hot; then remove the skin and large fibres, and boil them in water, slighted salted, from two to three minutes; beat them up with a teaspoonful of sage, very finely chopped, or with equal parts of sage and parsley, half a teaspoonful or rather more of salt, half as much mace, a little white pepper or cayenne, and one egg; drop them in small cakes, and fry them a fine light brown : two yolks of egg will make the cakes N178 [CHAP.

Boil the brains in a little good veal-gravy very gently for ten minutes; drain them on a sieve, and when cold, cut them into thick dice ; dip them into beaten yolk of egg, and then into very fine bread-crumbs, 'mixed with salt, pounded spices, and fine herbs, minced extremely small : fry them of a light brown, drain and dry them well, and slip them into the soup or hash after it is dished. When broth or gravy is not at hand, the brains may be boiled in water. NO. 15. CHESTNUT FORCEMEAT. Strip the outer skin from some fine sound chestnuts, then throw them into a saucepan of hot water, and set them over the fire for a minute or two, when they may easily be blanched like almonds. Put them into cold water as they are peeled. Dry them in a cloth, and weigh them. Stew six ounces of them very gently from fifteen to twenty minutes, in just sufficient strong veal- gravy to cover them. Take them up, drain them on a sieve, and when cold pound them perfectly smooth with half their weight of the nicest bacon rasped clear from all rust, or fibre, or with an equal quantity of fresh butter, two ounces of dry bread-crumbs, a small tea- spoonful of grated lemon-peel, one of salt, half as much mace or nutmeg, a moderate quantity of cayenne, and the unbeaten yolks of two eggs, or of three. This mix- ture makes most excellent forcemeat cakes, which must be moulded with a knife, a spoon, or the fingers, dipped in flour; more should be dredged over, and pressed on to them, and they should be fried slowly from ten to fifteen minutes.

AN EXCELLENT FRENCH FORCEMEAT. Take six ounces of veal free from fat and skin, cut it into dice and put it into a saucepan with two ounces of butter, a large teaspoonful of parsley finely minced, half as much thyme, salt, and grated lemon-rind, and a sufficient seasoning of nutmeg, cayenne, and mace, to flavour it pleasantly. Stew these very gently from twelve to fifteen minutes, then lift out the veal and put into the saucepan two ounces of bread-crumbs; let them simmer till they have absorbed the gravy yielded by the meat, then keep them stirred till they are as dry as possible ; beat the yolk of an egg to them while they are hot, and set them aside to cool. Chop and pound the veal, add the bread to it as soon as it is cold, beat them well to- gether, with an ounce and a half of fresh butter, and two of the finest bacon, scraped quite clear from rust, skin, and fibre; put to them the yolks of two small eggs, and mix them well; then take the forcemeat from the mortar, and set it in a very cool place till it is wanted for use. Yeal, 6 ozs.; butter, 2 ozs.; minced parsley, 1 tea- spoonful ; thyme, salt, and lemon-peel, each ^ teaspoon- ful; little nutmeg, cayenne, and mace: 12 to 15 minutes. Bread-crumbs, 2 ozs. ; butter, 1^ oz. ; rasped bacon, 2 ozs.; yolks of egg, 2 to 3. Obs. 1.—When this forcemeat is intended to fill boned fowls, the livers of two or three, boiled for four minutes, or stewed with the veal for the same length of time, then minced and pounded with the other ingre- dients, will be found a great improvement; and, if mushrooms can be procured, two tablespoonsful of them chopped small, should be stewed and beaten with it also. A small portion of the best end of the neck will afford the quantity of lean required for this receipt, and the remains of it will make excellent gravy.MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. VI. 180 NO. 17. FRENCH FORCEMEAT CALLED QUENELLES. This is a peculiarly light and delicate kind of force- meat, which by good French cooks is compounded with exceeding care. It is served abroad in a variety of forms, and is made of very finely-grained white veal, or of the undressed flesh of poultry, or of rabbits, rasped quite free from sinew, then chopped and pounded to the finest paste, first by itself, and afterwards with an equal quantity of boiled calf’s udder or of butter, and of panada, which is but another name for bread soaked in cream or gravy and then dried over the fire till it forms a sort of paste. As the three ingredients should be equal in volume, not in weight, they are each rolled into a separate ball before they are mixed, that their size maybe determined' by the eye. When the fat of the fillet of veal (which in England is not often divided for sale, as it is in France) is not to be procured, a rather less proportion of butter will serve in its stead. The following will be found a very good, and not a troublesome receipt for veal forcemeat of this kind. Rasp quite clear from sinew, after the fat and skin have been entirely cleared from it, four ounces of the finest veal; chop, and pound it well: if it be carefully prepared, there will be no necessity for passing it through a sieve, but this should otherwise be done. Soak in a small saucepan two ounces of the crumb of a stale loaf in a little rich but pale veal-gravy, or white sauce ; then press and drain as much as possible of the moisture from it, and stir it over a gentle fire until it is as dry as it will become without burning : it will adhere in a ball to the spoon, and leave the saucepan quite dry when it is sufficiently done. Mix with it, while it is still hot, the yolk of one egg, and when it is quite cold, add it to the veal with three ounces of very fresh butter, a quarter teaspoonful of mace, half as much cayenne, a little nutmeg, and a saltspoonful of salt. When these are perfectly beaten, and well blended together, add181 CHAP. VI.] FORCEMEATS. another whole egg, after having merely taken out the germs; the mixture will then be ready for use, and may be moulded into balls, or small thick oval shapes, a little flattened, and poached in soup or gravy from ten to fifteen minutes. These quenelles may be served by themselves in a rich sauce, as a corner dish, or in con- junction with other things. They may likewise be first poached for three or four minutes, then left on a drainer to become cold, dipped into egg and the finest bread- crumbs, fried, and served as croquettes. NO. 18. FORCEMEAT FOR RAISED AND OTHER COLD PIES. The very finest sausage-meat, highly seasoned, and made with an equal proportion of fat and lean, is an exceedingly good forcemeat for veal, chicken, rabbit, and' some few other pies ; savoury herbs minced small, may be added to heighten its flavour, if it be intended for immediate eating; but it will not then remain good quite so long, unless they should have been previously dried. To prevent its being too dry, two or three spoonsful of cold water should be mixed with it before it is put into the pie. One pound of lean veal to one and a quarter of the pork-fat is sometimes used, and smoothly pounded with a high seasoning of spices, herbs, and eschalots, or garlic, but we cannot recommend the introduction of these last into pies unless they are especially ordered; mushrooms may be mixed with any kind of forcemeat with far better effect. Equal parts of veal and fat bacon, will also make a good forcemeat for pies, chopped finely, and well spiced. Sausage-meat, well seasoned.

PANADA. This is the name given to the soaked bread which isMODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. VI. ] 82 mixed with the French forcemeats, and which renders them so peculiarly delicate. Pour on the crumb of two or three rolls, or on that of any other very light bread, as much good.boiling broth, milk, or cream, as will cover and moisten it well; put a plate over to keep in the steam, and let it remain for half an hour, or more, then drain off the superfluous liquid, and squeeze the panada dry by wringing it round in a thin cloth into a ball; put it into a small stewpan, or well-tinned saucepan, and pour to it as much only of rich white sauce or of gravy, as it can easily aborb, and stir it constantly with a wooden spoon, over a clear and gentle fire, until it forms a very dry paste, and adheres in a mass to the spoon ; when it is in this state, mix with it, thoroughly, the unbeaten yolk of two fresh eggs, which will give it firmness, and set it aside to become quite cold before it is put into the mortar. The best French cooks give the highest degree of savour that they can to this panada, and add no other seasoning to the forcemeats of which it forms a part: it is used in an equal proportion with the meat, and calf’s udder or butter of which they are com- posed, as we have shown in the preceding receipt for que- nelles. They stew slowly for the purpose, a small bit of lean ham, two or three minced eschalots, abayleaf, a few mushrooms, a little parsley, a clove or two, and a small blade of mace, in a little good butter, and when they are sufficiently browned, pour to them as much broth or gravy as will be needed for the panada ; and when this has simmered from twenty to thirty minutes, so as to have acquired the proper flavour, without being much reduced, they strain it over, and boil it into the bread. The common course of cookery in an English kitchen does not often require the practice of the greater niceties and refinements of the art : and trouble (of which the French appear to be perfectly regardless when the excellence of their preparations is concerned) is there in general so much thought of, and exclaimed against, that a more summary process would probably meet with a better chance of success.183 CHAP. VII.] BOILING, ROASTING, &C. A quicker and rougher mode of making the panada, and indeed the forcemeat altogether, is to pour strong veal broth or gravy upon it, and after it has soaked, to boil it dry, without any addition except that of a little fine spice, lemon-grate, or any other favourite English seasoning. Minced herbs, salt, cayenne, and mace may be beaten with the meat, to which a small portion of well-pounded ham, may likewise be added at pleasure. CHAPTER VII. BOILING, ROASTING, &c. TO BOIL MEAT. Large joints of meat should be neatly trimmed, washed extremely clean, and skew- ered or bound firmly into good shape, when they are of a nature to require it; ^ then well covered with cold water, brought to boil over simmered until they are done, the scum oemg carefully and entirely cleared from the surface of the water, as it gathers there, which will be principally from within a few minutes of its begin- ning to boil, and during a few minutes afterwards. If not thoroughly skimmed off at the proper time, it will sink, and adhere to the joint, giving it a very uninviting appearance. We cannot too strongly again impress upon the cook Iron Boiler, a moderate fire, and beingMODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. VII. 184 the advantages of gentle simmering over the usual fast- boiling of meat, by which, as has been already forcibly shown (see article Bouillon, Chapter I.), the outside is hardened and deprived of its juices, before the iuside is half done, while the starting of the flesh from the bones, which it occasions, and the altogether ragged aspect which it gives, are most unsightly. Pickled or salted meat requires longer boiling than fresh; and that which is smoked and dried, longer still. This last should always be slowly heated, and if, from any circumstances, time cannot have been allowed for soaking it properly, and there is a probability of its being too salt when served, it should be brought very softly to boil in a large quantity of water, which should in part be changed as soon as it becomes quite briny, for as much more that is ready boiling. It is customary to lay large joints upon a fish-plate, or to throw some wooden skewers under them, to prevent their sticking to the vessel in which they are cooked; and it is as well to take the precaution, though unless they be placed over a very fierce fire, they cannot be in danger of this. The time allowed for them is about Large Copper or Iron the same as for roasting, from Stockpot.* fifteen to twenty minutes to the pound.

Turkeys, fowls, sweetbreads, calf's brains, cauliflowers, and artichoke bottoms, are the articles for which the poelee and the llanc are more especially used in refined foreign cookery; the reader will judge by the following receipts, how far they are admissible into that of the economist. Poelee. Cut into large dice two pounds of lean veal, and two pounds of fat bacon, cured without saltpetre, two large carrots, and two onions ; to these add half a pound of fresh butter, put the whole into a stewpan, and stir it with a wooden spoon over a gentle fire, until the veal is very white, and the bacon is partially melted; then pour to them three pints of clear boiling broth or water, throw in four cloves, a small bunch or two of thyme and parsley, a bay-leaf, and a few corns of white pepper; boil these gently for an hour and a half, then strain the poelee through a fine sieve, and set it by in a cool place. Use instead of water for boiling, the various articles we have already named ; it will answer for several in suc- cession, and will remain good for many days. Some cooks order a pound of butter in addition to the bacon, and others substitute beef-suet in part for this last. A Blanc. Put into a stewTpan one pound of fat bacon, rasped, one pound of beef-suet cut small, and one pound of butter, the strained juice of two lemons, a couple of bay- leaves, three cloves, three carrots, and three onions divided into dice, and less than half a pint of water. Simmer these gently, keeping them often stirred, until the fat is well melted, and the water has evaporated ; then pour in rather more than will be required for the dish which is to be cooked in the blanc; boil it softly until all the ingredients have given out their full flavour, skim it well, add salt if needed, and strain it off for use. A calf s head is often boiled in this.[CHAP. VII. MODERN COOKERY. 186 ROASTING. Roasting, which is quite the favourite mode of dressing meat in this country, and one in which the English are thought to excel, requires unremitting attention on the part of the cook, rather than any great exertion of skill. Large kitchens are usually fitted with a smoke-jack, by means of which, several spits, if needful, can be kept turning at the same time; but in small establishments, a roaster which allows of some eco- nomy in point of fuel, is more commonly used. That shown in the print is of very advantageous construction in this respect, as a joint may be cooked in it with a comparatively small fire, the heat being strongly reflected from the screen upon the meat; in consequence of this, it should never be placed very close to the grate, as the surface of the joint would then become dry and hard. A more convenient form of roaster, with a spit placed in it horizontally, and turned by means of a wheel and chain, of which the movement is regulated by a spring con- tained in a box at the top, is of the same economical order as the one above. Bottle-jack and Niche Screen.* Improved Spring-jack and Roaster. * The bottle-jack, without the screen, is used in many families ery successfully; it is wound up like a watch, by means of a key, id turns very regularly until it has run down.CHAP. VII.] BOILING, ROASTING, &C. 187 For roasting without either of these, make up a fire proportioned in width and height to the joint which is to be roasted, and which it should surpass in di- mension every way, by two or three inches. Place some moderate-sized lumps of coal on the top; let it be free from smoke and ashes in front; and so compactly arranged that it will neither require to be disturbed, nor supplied with fresh fuel for some considerable time after the meat is laid down. Spit the joint and place it very far from the fire at first, keep it constantly basted, and when it is two parts done, move it nearer to the fire that it may be properly browned, but guard carefully against it being burned. A few minutes before it is taken from the spit, sprinkle a little fine salt over it, baste it thoroughly with its own dripping, or with butter, and dredge it with flour; as soon as the froth is well risen, dish, and serve the meat. Or, to avoid the necessity of the frothing which is often greatly objected to on ac- count of the raw taste retained by the flour, dredge the roast liberally soon after it is first laid to the fire: the flour will then form a savoury incrustation upon it, and assist to prevent the escape of its juices. When meat or poultry is wrapped in buttered paper it must not be floured until this is removed, which should be fifteen or twenty minutes before either is served. Remember always to draw back the dripping-pan when the fire has to be stirred, or when fresh coals are thrown on, that the cinders and ashes may not fall into it. When meat is very lean, a slice of butter, or a small quantity of clarified dripping should be melted in the pan to baste it with at first; though the use of the latter should be scrupulously avoided for poultry, or any delicate meats, as the flavour it imparts is, to many persons, peculiarly objectionable. Let the spit be kept bright and clean, and wipe it before the meat is put on; balance the joint well upon it, that it may turn steadily, and if needful secure it with screw skewers. A cradle spit, which is so constructed that it contains the meatMODERN COOKERY. 188 [[chap. VII. in a sort of frame-work, instead of passing through it, may be often very advantageously used instead of an ordinary one, as the perforation of the meat by this last must always occasion some escape of the juices; and it is, moreover, particularly to be objected to in roasting joints or poultry, which have been boned, and filled with forcemeat. The cradle spit* is much better suited to these, as well as to a sucking pig, sturgeon, salmon, and other large fish ; but it is not very commonly to be found in our kitchens, many of which exhibit a singular scantiness of the conveniences which facilitate the la- b ours of the cook. For heavy and substantial joints a quarter of an hour is generally allowed for every pound of meat; and with a sound fire and frequent basting, will be found suffi- cient when the process is conducted in the usual man- ner ; but by the slow method, as we shall designate it, almost double the time will be required. Pork, veal, and lamb, should always be well roasted; but many eaters prefer mutton and beef rather under-dressed, though some persons have a strong objection to the sight even of any meat that is not thoroughly cooked. Joints which are thin in proportion to their weight, require less of the fire than thick and solid ones: ribs of beef for example, will be sooner ready to serve than an equal weight of the rump, round, or sirloin; and the neck or shoulder of mutton, or spare rib of pork, than the leg. When to preserve the succulence of the meat is more an object than to economize fuel, beef and mutton should be laid at twice the usual distance from the fire and allowed to remain so until they are perfectly heated through; the roasting, so managed, will of course be stoic; and from three hours and a half to four hours will be necessary to cook by this method a leg of mutton of ordinary size, for which two hours would amply suf- fice in a common way; but the flesh will be remarkably tender, and the flow of gravy from it most abundant. * For which see Chapter XII.189 CHAP.

It should not be drawn near the fire until within the last hour, and should then be placed only so close as to brown it properly. No kind of roast indeed should at any time be allowed to take colour too quickly; it should be heated gradually, and kept at least at a mo- derate distance from the fire until it is nearly done, or the outside will be dry and hard, if not burned, while the inside will be only half cooked. STEAMING. The application of steam to culinary purposes is becoming very general in our kitchens at the present day, especially in those of large establish- ments, many of which are furnished with apparatus for its use, so admirably construct- ed, and so complete, that the process may be conducted on with very slight trouble to the cook; and with the further advantage of being at a distance from the fire, the steam being conveyed by pipes to the vessels intended to receive it. Fish, butcher-meat, poultry, vegetables, puddings, maccaroni, and rice, are all sub- jected to its action, instead of being immersed in water, as in simple boiling ; and the result is to many persons perfectly satisfactory; though, as there is a difference of opinion amongst first-rate cooks, with regard to the comparative merits of the two modes of dressing meat and fish, a trial should be given to the steaming, on a small scale, before any great expenses are incurred for it, which may be done easily with a common saucepan or boiler, fitted like the one shown above, with a simple tin steamer. Servants not accustomed to the use of these, should be warned against boiling in the vessel itself anything of coarse or strong flavour, when the article steamed is of a delicate nature. The vapour from soup containing onions, for example, would have a very bad effect on a sweet pudding especially, and on many[CHAP. VII. 190 MODERN COOKERY. other dishes. Care and discretion, therefore, must be exercised on this point. By means of a kettle fixed over it, the steam of the boiler in the kitchen range, may be made available for cooking, in the way shown by the engrav- ing, which exhibits fish, pota- toes, and their sauces, all in progress of steaming at the same time.* The limits of our work do not permit us to enter at much length upon this sub- ject, but the reader who may wish to understand the nature of steam, and the various modes in which its agency may be applied to domestic purposes, will do well to consult Mr. Webster’s excellent work,t of which we have more particularly spoken in another chapter. The quite inex- perienced cook may require to be told, that any article of food which is to be cooked by steam in a saucepan of the form exhibited in the first of the engravings of this section, must be prepared exactly as for boiling, and laid into the sort of strainer affixed to the top of the sauce- pan ; and that water, or some other kind of liquid, must be put into the saucepan itself, and kept boiling in it, the lid being first closely fixed into the steamer. STEWING. This very wholesome, convenient, and econo- mical mode of cookery is by no means so well understood nor pro- fited by in England as on the continent, where its advantages are fully appreciated. So very small a quan- tity of fuel is neces- * Invented and sold by Mr. Evans, Fish-street hill. $ Encyclopedia of Domestic Economy. Longman & Co.191 CHAP. VJI.] BOILING, ROASTING, &C. sary to sustain the gentle degree of ebullition which it requires, that this alone would recommend it to the careful housekeeper; but if the process be skilfully conducted, meat softly stoved or stewed, in close-shut- ting, or luted vessels, is in every respect equal, if not superior, to that which is roasted; but it must be simmered only, and in the gentlest possible manner, or, instead of being tender, nutritious, and highly palatable, it will be dry, hard, and indigestible. The common cooking stoves in this country, as they have hitherto been constructed, have rendered the exact regulation of heat which stewing requires rather difficult; and the smoke and blaze of a large coal fire are very unfavour- able to many other modes of cookery as well. The French have generally the advantage of the embers and ashes of the wood which is their ordinary fuel; and they have always in addition a stove of this construc- tion in which charcoal or braise (for explanation of this word, see remarks on preserv- ing, Chapter XXI.) only is burned; and upon which their stewpans can, when there is occasion, be left un- covered, without the danger of their contents being spoiled, which there generally is with us. It is true that of late great improvements have been made in our own stoves; and the hot plates, or hearths with which the kitchens of good houses are always furnished, are admirably adapted to the simmering system; but when the cook has not the convenience of one, the stewpans must be laid on trevets high above the fire, and be constantly watched, and moved, as occasion may require, nearer to or further from the flame. No copper vessels from which the inner tinning is in the slightest degree worn away should be used ever, for this or for any other kind of cookery; or not health only, but life itself, may be endangered by them.* We * Sugar, being an antidote to the poisonous effects of verdigris,MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. VII. 192 have ourselves seen a dish of acid fruit which had been boiled without sugar, in a copper pan from which the tin lining was half worn away, coated with verdigris after it had become cold ; and from the careless habits of the person who had prepared it, the chances were greatly in favour of its being served to a family after- wards, if it had not been accidently discovered. Salt acts upon the copper in the same manner as acids; vegetables, too, from the portion of the latter which they contain, have the same injurious effect; and the greatest danger results from allowing preparations containing any of these to become cold (or cool) in the stewpan, in contact with the exposed part of the copper in the inside. Thick, well-tinned iron saucepans will answer for all the ordinary purposes of common English cookery, even for stewing, provided they have tightly- fitting lids to prevent the escape of the steam; but the copper ones are of more convenient form, and better adapted to a superior order of cookery. We shall have occasion to speak more particularly in another part of this work, of the German ena- melled stewpans, so safe, and so well suited, from the extreme nicety of the composition, resembling earthen- ware or china, with which they are lined, to all deli- cate compounds. The cook should be warned however, that they retain the heat so long, that the contents will boil for several minutes after they are removed from the fire, and this must be guarded against when they have reached the exact point, at which further boiling would have a bad effect, as would be the case with some pre- serves, and other sweets. BROILING. Broiling is the best possible mode of cooking and of preserving the flavour of several kinds of fish, amongst should be plentifully taken, dissolved in water, so as to form quite a syrup, by persons who may unfortunately have partaken of any dish into which this dangerous ingredient has entered.CHAP. VII.] BOILING, BOASTING, &C. 193 which we may specify macke- rel and whitings;* it is also incomparably superior to fry- ing for steaks and cutlets, especially of beef and mutton ; and it is far better adapted, also, to the preparation of food for invalids ; but it should be carefully done; for if the heat be too fierce, the outside of the meat will be scorched and hardened so as to render it uneatable; and if, on the contrary, it be too gentle, the gravy will be drawn out, and yet the flesh will remain so entirely without firmness, as to be unpleasant eating. A brisk fire 'perfectly fr§e from smoke, a very clean gridiron, tender meat, a dish and plates as hot as they can be, and great despatch in sending it to table when done, are all essential to the serving of a good broil. The gridiron should be well heated, and rubbed with mutton suet before the meat is laid on, and it should be placed slopingly over the fire, that the fat may run off to the back of the grate, instead of falling on the live coals, and smoking the meat: if this precaution should not prevent its making an occasional blaze, lift the gridiron quickly beyond the reach of the smoke, and hold it awav until the fire is clear again. Steaks and chops should be turned often, that the juices may be * Salmon broiled in slices, is a favourite dish with eaters who like the full rich flavour of the fish preserved, as it is much more luscious (but less delicate) dressed thus, than when it is boiled. The slices should be cut from an inch to an inch and a half thick, and taken from the middle of a very fresh salmon ; they may be seasoned with cayenne only, and slowly broiled over a very clear fire ; or, folded in buttered paper before they are laid on the grid- iron ; or, lightly brushed with oil, and highly seasoned; or, dipped into egg-yolks and then into the finest crumbs mixed with salt, spice, and plenty of minced herbs, then sprinkled with clarified butter; but in whichever way they are prepared they will require to be gently broiled, with every precaution against their being smoked.

If, for this purpose, it should be necessary, for want of steak-tongs, to use a fork, pass it through the outer skin, or fat of the steak, but never stick it into the lean, as by that means much of the gravy will escape. Most eaters prefer broiled beef or mutton, rather under-dressed ; but pork chops should always be thoroughly cooked. When a fowl or any other bird is cut asunder before it is broiled, the inside should first be laid to the fire : this should be done with kidneys also. Fish should be wrapped in a sheet of buttered writing paper, which will prevent their sticking to the gridiron, and will also preserve the skin in a better state than when it is exposed to the fire. Cutlets, or meat in any other form, when egged and crumbed for broiling, should afterwards * be dipped into clarified butter, or sprinkled with it plentifully, as the egg- yolk and bread will otherwise form too dry a crust upon it. French cooks season their cutlets both with salt and pepper, and brush a little oil or butter over them to keep them moist; but unless this be done, no seasoning of salt should be given them until they are just ready to be dished : the French method is a very good one. Steaks or cutlets may be quickly cooked with a sheet or two of lighted paper only, in the apparatus shown above and called a conjurer. Lift off the cover and lay in the meat properly seasoned, with a small slice of butter under it, and insert the lighted paper in the aperture shown in the plate; in from eight to ten minutes the meat will be done, and found to be remarkably tender, and very palatable. This is an especially convenient mode of cooking for persons whose hours of dining are rendered uncertain by the nature of their avocations. For medical men engagedCHAP. VII.] BOILING, ROASTING, &C. 195 in extensive country practice it lias been often proved so. The conjurer costs but a few shillings. Another form of this economical apparatus, with which a pint of water may be made to boil by means of only a sheet of paper wrapped round a cone, in the inside, is shown in the second plate. PRYING. This is an operation, which, though apparently very simple, requires to be more carefully and skilfully conducted than it com- Saute Pan. monly is. Its success depends principally on allowing the fat to attain the exact de- gree of heat which shall give firmness, without too quick browning or scorching, before anything is laid into the pan; for if this be neglected the article fried will be saturated with the fat, and remain j>ale and flaccid. When the requisite degree of colour is ac- quired before the cooking is complete, the pan should be placed high above the fire, that it may be con- tinued slowly to the proper point. Steaks and cutlets should be seasoned with salt and pepper, and dredged on both sides lightly with flour before they are laid into the pan, in which they should be often moved and turned, that they may be equally done, and that they may not stick nor burn to it. From ten to fif- teen minutes will fry them. They should be evenly sliced, about the same thickness as for broiling, and neatly trimmed and divided in the first instance. Lift them into a hot dish when done; pour the fat from the pan, and throw in a small slice of butter, stir to this a large teasponsful of flour, brown it gently, and pour in by degrees a quarter pint of hot broth or water; shake the pan well round, add pepper, salt, and a little good catsup, or any other store sauce which may be preferred to it, and pour the gravy over the steaks : this is the most common mode of saucing and serving them. Minute directions for fish, and others for omlets, and for different preparations of batter, are given in196 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. YII. their proper places; but we must again observe, that a very small frying-pan (scarcely larger than a dinner- plate) is necessary for many of these ; and, indeed, the large and thick one suited to meat and fish, and used commonly for them, is altogether unfit for nicer PUTh°\Tsaute-pan above, is much used by French cooks instead of a frying-pan ; it is more particularly con- venient for tossing quickly over the fire small collops, or aught else that requires little cooking. All fried dishes, which are not sauced, should be served extremely dry, upon a neatly-folded damask cloth: they are best drained, upon a sieve reversed, placed before the fire. A wire basket of this form is convenient for frying parsley and other herbs: it must be placed in a pan well filled with fat, and 'Wire Basket for Frying. lifted out quickly when the herbs are done : they may likewise be crisped in it over a clear fire, without being fried. BAKING. American Oven.* The oven may be used with advantage for many purposes of cookery, for which it is not commonly put into requisition.

VII.] lent eating if laid, with the hones, into a deep pan and baked quite tender in sufficient broth, or water, to keep it covered in every part till done; good soup also may be made in the same way, the usual ingredients being at once added to the meat, with the exception of the vegetables, which will not become tender if put into cold liquor, and should therefore be thrown in after it begins to simmer. Baking is also the best mode of dressing various kinds of fish : pike and red mullet amongst others. Salmon cut into thick slices, freed from the skin, well seasoned with spice, mixed with salt (and with minced herbs, at pleasure), then arranged evenly in a dish, and covered thickly with crumbs of bread, moistened with clarified butter, as directed in Chapter II., for baked soles, and placed in the oven for about half an hour, will be found very rich and highly flavoured. Part of the middle of the salmon left entire, well-cleaned, and thoroughly dried, then seasoned, and securely wrapped in two or three folds of thickly buttered paper, will also prove excel- lent eating, if gently baked. (This may likewise be roasted in a Dutch oven, either folded in the paper, or left without it, and basted with butter.) Hams, when freshly cured, and not over-salted, if neatly trimmed, and closely wrapped in a coarse paste, are both more juicy, and of finer flavour baked than boiled. Savoury or pickled beef also put into a deep pan, with a little gravy, and plenty of butter, or chopped suet on the top, to prevent the outside from becoming dry; then covered with paste, or with several folds of thick paper, and set into a moderate oven for. four or five hours, or even longer, if it be of large weight, is an excellent dish. A goose, a leg of pork, and a sucking pig, if properly attended to while in the oven, are said to be nearly, or quite as good as if roasted; but baking is both an unpalatable and an unprofitable mode of cooking joints of meat in general, though its great convenience to many persons who have but few other facilitiesMODERN COOKERY. [chap. VII. 198 for obtaining the luxury of a hot dinner, renders it a very common one. It is usual to raise meat from the dish in which it is sent to the oven by placing it, properly skewered, on a stand, so as to allow potatoes, or a batter pudding to be baked under it. A few button onions, freed from the outer skin, or three or four larger ons, cut in halves, are sometimes put beneath a shoulder of mutton. Two sheets of paper spread separately with a thick layer of butter, clarified marrow, or any other fat, and fastened securely over the outside of a joint, will prevent its being too much dried by the fierce heat of the oven. A few spoonsful of water or gravy should be poured into the dish with potatoes, and a little salt sprinkled over them. A celebrated French cook recommends braising in the oven: that is to say, after the meat lias been arranged in the usual manner, and just brought to boil over the fire, that the braising pan, closely stopped, should be put into a moderate oven, for the same length of time as would be required to stew the meat perfectly tender. BRAISING. Braising is but a more expensive mode of stewing meat. The following French recipe will explain the process. We would observe, however, that the layers of beef or veal, in English Braising-pan. which the joint to be braised is embedded, can afterwards be converted into excellent soup, gravy, or glaze; and that there need, in conse- quence, be no waste, nor any unreasonable degree of expense attending it ; but it is a troublesome process, and quite as good a result may be obtained by simmer- ing the meat in very strong gravy. Should the flavour199 CHAP. VII.] BOILING, ROASTING, &C. of the bacon be considered an advantage, slices of it can be laid over the article braised, and secured to it with a fillet of tape. “ To braise the inside (or small fillet, as it is called in France) of a sirloin of beef: Raise the fillet clean from the joint; and with a sharp knife strip off all the skin, leaving the surface of the meat as smooth as possible ; have ready some strips of unsmoked bacon, half as thick as your little finger, roll them in a mixture of thyme finely minced, spices in powder, and a little pepper and salt. Lard the fillet quite through with these, and tie it round with tape in any shape you choose. Line the bottom of a stewpan (or braising-pan) with slices of bacon; next put in a layer of beef, or veal, four onions, two bay-leaves, two carrots, and a bunch of sweet herbs, and place the fillet on them. Cover it with slices of bacon, put some trimmings of meat all round it, and pour on to it half a pint of good bouillon or gravy. Let it stew as gently as possible for two hours and a half; take it up, and keep it very hot; strain, and reduce the gravy by quick boiling till it is thick enough to glaze with; brush the meat over with it; put the rest in the dish with the fillet, after the tape has been removed from it, and send it directly to table.” Equal parts of Madeira and gravy are sometimes used to moisten the meat. No attempt should be made to braise a joint in any vessel that is not very nearly of its own size. A round of buttered paper is generally put over the more delicate kinds of braised meat, to prevent their being browned by the fire, which, in France, is put round the lid of the braising-pan, in a groove made on purpose to contain it. The embers of a wood fire mixed with the hot ashes, are best adapted to sustain the regular, but gentle degree of heat required for this mode of cooking. The pan shown at the head of this section, with a closely fitting copper tray, serving for the cover, is usedMODERN COOKERY. 200 [CHAP. VII. ^ commonly in England for braising; but a stewpan of modern form, or any other vessel which will admit of embers being placed upon the lid, will answer for the Copper Stewpan. purpose as well. Common cooks sometimes stew meat in a mixture of butter and water, and call it braising. LARDING. Larding Pins. Cut into slices, of the same length and thickness, some baGon of the finest quality; trim away the out- sides, place the slices evenly upon each other, and with a sharp knife divide them obliquely into small strips of equal size. For pheasants, partridges, hares, fowls, and fricandeaux, the bacon should be about the eighth of an inch square, and two inches in length ; but for meats that are to be larded quite through, instead of on the outside merely, the bits of bacon (properly called lar- doons) must be at least the third of an inch square. In general, the breasts only of birds are larded, the backs and thighs of hares, and the whole of the upper surface of a fricandeau : these should be thickly covered with small lardoons, placed at regular intervals, and in lines which intersect each other, so as to form rather minute diamonds. The following directions for larding a pheasant will serve equally for poultry, or for other kinds of game :— Secure one end of the bacon in a slight larding-pin, and on the point of this take up sufficient of the flesh of the bird to hold the lardoon firmly; draw the pin through it, and part of the bacon, of which the two ends should be left of equal length. Proceed thus, until theCHAP. VII.] BOILING, ROASTING, ETC. 201 breast of the pheasant is entirely garnished with lar- doons, when it ought to resemble in appearance a cake thickly stuck with slips of almonds. The larger strips of bacon, after being rolled in a high seasoning of minced herbs and spices, are used to lard the inside of meat, and they should be proportioned to its thickness, as they must be passed quite through it. For example : a four-inch slice from a rump of beef will require lardoons of very nearly that length, which must be drawn through with a large kirding-pin, and left in it, with the ends just out of sight on either side- In France, truffles, anchovies, slices of tongue, and of fat, all trimmed into proper shape, are occasionally used for larding. The bacon employed there for the purpose is cured without any saltpetre (as this would redden the white meats), and it is never smoked : the receipt for it will be found in Chapter XI. A turkey is sometimes larded with alternate lardoons of fat bacon and of bullock’s tongue, which has been pickled but not dried : we apprehend that the lean of a half-boiled ham, of good colour, could answer the pur- pose quite as well, or better. Larding the surface of meat, poultry, or game, gives it a good appearance, but it is a more positive improve- ment to meat of a dry nature to interlard the inside with large lardoons of well-seasoned, delicate, striped English bacon. BONING. Very minute directions being given in other parts of our volume for this, we confine ourselves here to the following rules :—in disengaging the flesh from it, work the knife always close to the bone, and take every care not to pierce the outer skin. TO BLANCH MEAT OR VEGETABLES. This is merely to throw either into a pan of boiling water for a few minutes, which gives firmness to the first, and is necessary for some modes of preparing vegetables.MODERN COOKERY. £chap. YII. 202 The breast only of a bird is sometimes held in the water while it boils, to render it firm for larding. To preserve the whiteness of meat, and the bright green of vegetables, they are lifted from the water after they have boiled a few minutes, and are thrown immediately into spring water, and left till cold. 5 to 10 minutes. GLAZING. This process we have ex- plained'at the article Glaze, Chapter III. The surface of the meat should be covered evenly, and with two or three separate layers of the glaze, which, if properly made, soon becomes firm. A ham should be well dried in the oven before it is laid on. Cutlets of all kinds may be glazed before they are sent to table, with very good effect. The figure above represents a glaze-pot and brush, used for heating and applying the preparation; a jar placed in a pan of boiling water may be substituted for the first, when it is not at hand. TOASTING. A very cheap apparatus, by which chops can be dressed before a clear fire, is shown by the first of theseBEEF. 203 CHAP.

To brown the surface of a dish without baking or 'placing it at the fire. This is done with a salamander, as it is called, formed like the engraving below; it is heated in the fire, and held over the dish sufficiently near to give it colour. It is very much used in a superior order of cookery. A kitchen shovel is sometimes substituted for it on an emergency. No. 1. Sirloin. 2. Rump. 3. Edge-bone. 4. Buttock, or Round. 5.

If young and freshly killed, the lean of ox-beef will be smoothly grained, and of a fine, healthy, carnation-red, the fat rather white than yellow, and the suet white and firm. Heifer-beef is more closely grained, and rather less bright of colour, the bones are considerably smaller, and the fat of a purer white. Of bull-beef we only speak to warn our readers, that it is of all meat the coarsest and the most rank in fla- vour. It may be known by its dark hue, its close tough fibre, and the scanty proportion, bad appearance, and strong odour of its fat. In choice and well-fed beef, the lean will be found intergrained with fat: very lean meat is always of an inferior kind. The ribs, the sirloin, and the rump, are the proper joints for roasting. The round, or buttock, the edge- bone, the second round, or mouse-buttock, the shin, the brisket, the shoulder or leg of mutton piece, and the clod may be boiled or stewed. The neck is generally used for soup or gravy; and the thin flank for collaring. The best steaks are cut from the middle of the rump; the next best from the veiny-piece, or from the chuck- rib. The inside of the sirloin, commonly used for the purpose in France, makes by far the most delicate steaks; but though exceedingly tender, they are consi- dered by English epicures to be wanting in flavour. The finest part of the sirloin is the chump-end, which contains the larger portion of the fillet: of the ribs, the middle ones are those generally preferred by experienced housekeepers. TO ROAST SIRLOIN, OR RIBS OF BEEF. Let the joint hang as long as it can possibly be kept perfectly sweet. When it is first brought in, remove the pipe of marrow which runs along the backbone; and cut out the kernels from the fat. Be very careful in summer to guard it from flies; examine it frequently inCHAP. VIII.] BEEF. 205 warm or damp weather; and scrape off with a knife, or wipe away with a dry cloth, any moisture that may ap- pear on the surface: when this has been done, dust some powdered ginger (pepper, or flour if more conve- nient,) over it. Unless the joint should be very large, its appearance will be improved by taking off the ends of the bones, which may then be laid in salt for a few days, and afterwards boiled. Spit the beef firmly; keep it far back from the fire for a considerable time, ! that is to say, until it is well heated through ; baste it constantly; and proceed as directed in the general rules for roasting (see page 187). Persons who object to meat being frothed for table, have it dredged with flower when ' it is first placed at the fire, and sprinkled with fine salt when it is nearly done. It is not necessary to paper the fat of beef, as many cooks direct, if proper attention be given to it while roasting. As a general rule, it may be observed, that when the steam from the meat draws strongly towards the fire, it is nearly or quite ready to serve. The time required to j roast it will depend on the state of the weather,45- the size and strength of the fire, the thickness of the joint, the use or non-use of a meat-screen or reflector, the general temperature of the kitchen, and other contingen- cies. A quarter of a hour for each pound of meat is commonly allowed for solid, heavy joints, and, if the directions we have given be attended to, this will not be found too much even for persons who prefer beef somewhat rere: it must be left longer at the fire if o wished very thoroughly roasted, and quite double the usual time when the plan we have noticed at page 188, is adopted. When likely to be sent to table hashed, minced, or dressed a second time in any way, the juices of the meat should be dried up as little as possible when it is first cooked. * The meat will be much sooner done in hot weather than in cold. If frozen, it must be thawed very gradually before it is put to the fire, as no length of time will roast it: this will be effected better by laying it into cold or just tepid water for some hours before it is wanted, than by any other means.MODERN COOKERY. ^CIIAP. VIII. 206 ROAST RUMP OF BEEF. As this joint is generally too large to serve whole, as much of it as will form a handsome dish should be cut from the chump-end to roast. It must be ma- naged as the sirloin, to which it is commonly preferred by connoisseurs. When boned, and rolled into the form of a fillet of veal as it sometimes is, nearly or quite an additional hour should be allowed to dress it. TO ROAST PART OF A ROUND OF BEEF. The natural division of the meat will show where the silver-side of the round is to be separated from the upper, or tongue side, which is the proper part for roast- ing, and which will be found equally good and profitable for the purpose, if allowed to hang as long as it can be kept sweet before it is dressed. Care should be taken in dividing the meat, not to pierce the inner skin. The silver side, with the udder, if there should be one to the joint, may be pickled, spiced, or simply salted, and will be excellent either way. The outside fat should be drawn tightly round the remainder of the beef, which must be firmly skewered, or bound with tape, to keep it in form. It will require long roasting at a strong steady fire, and should be kept constantly basted. Beef, 14 lbs.; 4j to 5 hours. Obs.—We think that larding the beef quite through with large lardoons of firm fat, of udder, or of bacon, would be an improvement; and we ought also to observe, that unless it be young and of fine quality, it will not answer well for roasting. TO ROAST A FILLET OF BEEF. Raise the fillet trom the inside of the sirloin, or from part of it, with a sharp knife; leave the fat on, trim off the skin, lard it through, or all over; or roast it, quite plain; baste it with butter, and send it very hot to table, with tomata sauce, or sauce piquante, or207 BEEF. CHAP. VIII.] eschalot sauce, in a tureen. It is sometimes served with brown gravy and currant jelly : it should then be garnished with forcemeat-balls, made as for hare. If not very large, an hour and a quarter will roast it well with a brisk fire. Ohs.—The remainder of the joint may be boned, rolled, and roasted, or braised; or dressed a la Polo- naise; or made into meat cakes; or be served as a miniature round of beef. 1 hour, 15 minutes. ROAST BEEF STEAK. If extremely tender, a large slice from the middle of the rump will make an excellent small dish of roast meat, when a joint is not easily to be procured. Let it be smoothly cut, from an inch to an inch and a half thick, flattened on a table, and the inside sprinkled with a little fine salt and cayenne, or common pepper; make a roll of forcemeat, as No. 1 (page 170), adding, at pleasure, a flavouring of minced onion or eschalot, and increasing the quantity of spices; place this on one end of the steak, and roll it up tightly in it; skewer and bind the meat so that the forcemeat cannot escape; fasten a buttered paper over it, and roast it an hour and a half, or more, according to its size. Twenty minutes before it is served, take off the paper, and flour the meat, which should be kept well basted with butter all the time it is roasting. Send brown gravy to table with it, and pour a little over the beef. 1 hour and J, or more. TO BROIL BEEF STEAKS. The steaks should be from half to three quarters of an inch thick, equally sliced, and freshly cut from the middle of a well kept, finely grained, and tender rump of beef. They should be neatly trimmed, and once or twice divided, if very large. The fire, as we have already said in the general directions for broiling (page 193), must be strong and clear. The bars of the gridironMODERN COOKERY. 208 [chap. yiii. should be thin, and not very close together. When they are thoroughly heated, without being sufficiently burning to scorch the meat, wipe and rub them with fresh mutton suet; next pepper the steaks slightly, but never season them with salt before they are dressed ; lay them on the gridiron, and when done on one side, turn them on the other, being careful to catch, in the dish in which they are to be sent to table, any gravy that may threaten to drain from them when they are moved. Let them be served the instant they are taken from the fire; and have ready at the moment, dish, cover, and plates, as hot as they can be. From eight to ten minutes will be sufficient to broil steaks for the generality of eaters, and more than enough for those who like them but partially done. Genuine amateurs seldom take prepared sauce or gravy with their steaks, as they consider the natural juices of the meat sufficient. When any accompaniment to them is desired, a small quantity of choice mushroom catsup may be warmed in the dish that is heated to receive them; and which, when the flavour is approved, may previously be rubbed with a raw eschalot, of which the large end has been taken off. A thin slice or two of fresh butter is sometimes laid under the steaks, where it soon melts and mingles with the gravy that flows from them. The appropriate tureen sauces for broiled beef steaks are onion, tomata, oyster, eschalot, hot horse- radish, and brown cucumber, or mushroom sauce. Obs. 1.—We have departed a little in this receipt from our previous instructions for broiling, by recom- mending that the steaks should be turned but once, instead of “often,” as all great authorities on the sub- ject direct. By trying each method, our readers will be able to decide for themselves upon the preferable one : we can only say, that wTe have never eaten steaks so excellent as those which have been dressed exactly in accordance with the receipt we have just given, and we have taken infinite pains to ascertain the really best mode of preparing this very favourite English dish,209 BEEF. CHAP. VIII.] which so constantly makes its appearance both carelessly cooked and ill served, especially at private tables. Ohs. 2.—It is a good plan to throw a few bits of charcoal on the fire some minutes before the steaks are laid down, as they give forth a strong heat without any smoke. The upright gridirons, by which meat is rather toasted than broiled, though used in many kitchens and gener- ally pronounced exceedingly convenient, where they have been tried, do not appear to us so well adapted for dressing steaks as those of less modem fashion, which are placed over, instead of before the fire. BEEF STEAKS A LA FRANQAISE. The inside of the sirloin freed from skin, and cut evenly into round quarter-inch slices, should properly be used for these; but when it cannot be ob- tained, part of the rump must be substituted for it. Season the steaks with fine salt and pepper, dip them into a little clarified butter, and broil them over a clear, brisk fire. Mix a teaspoonful of parsley, minced extremely fine, with a large slice of fresh butter, a little cayenne, and a small quantity of salt. When the steaks are done, put the mixture in the dish intended for them, and lay them upon it; garnish them plenti- fully with fried potatoes. It is an improvement to squeeze the juice of half a lemon on the butter, before the meat is heaped over it. The potatoes should be sliced rather thin, coloured of a fine brown, and placed evenly round the meat. BEEF STEAKS A LA FRAN^AISE. {Another Receipt.) Cut the beef in small thin steaks as above, season them with fine salt and pepper, dredge them lightly with flour, and fry them in butter over a brisk fire. After they are dished, pour over them some stewed olives, or send a tureen of olive sauce (see page 148,) to table with them. p210 £chap. VIII. MODERN COOKERY. STEWED BEEF STEAK. This may be cut from one to two inches thick, and the time of stewing it must be proportioned to its size. Dissolve a slice of butter in a large saucepan or stewpan, and brown the steak on both sides, moving it often that it may not burn ; then shake in a little flour, and when it is coloured pour in by degrees rather more than sufficient broth or water to cover the meat. When it boils, season it with salt, take off the scum, slice in one onion, a carrot or two, and half a turnip ; add a small bunch of sweet herbs, and stew the steak very softly from two hours and a half to three hours. A quarter of an hour before it is served, stir well into the gravy three teaspoonsful of rice flour smoothly mixed with a little cayenne, half a wineglassful of mushroom catsup, and a slight seasoning of spice. A teaspoonful of currie-powder, in addition, will improve both the flavour and the appearance of the sauce. The onion is sometimes browned with the meat, and the quantity is considerably increased. Eschalots may be used in- stead, where their strong flavour is approved. A few button-mushrooms, stewed from twenty to thirty minutes with the meat, will render the catsup un- necessary. Wine, or any favourite store sauce, can be added at will. 2j, to 3 hours. FRIED BEEF STEAK. We have little to add here to the directions of page 195, which are sufficient to enable the cook to send a dish of fried steaks to table properly dressed. Currie sauce, highly onioned, is frequently served with them. BEEF STEAK STEWED IN ITS OWN GRAVY. (Good and wholesome.') Trim all the fat and skin from a rump-steak of nearly an inch thick, and divide it once or twice; just dip itCHAP. VIII.] BEEF. 211 into cold water, let it drain for an instant, sprinkle it on both sides with pepper, and then flour it rather thickly ; lay it quite flat into a well-tinned iron saucepan or stewpan which has been rinsed with cold water, of which a single dessertspoonful should be left in it. Place it over (not upon) a very gentle fire, and keep it just simmering from an hour and a half to an hour and three-quarters, when, if the meat be good, it will have become perfectly tender. Add salt to it, when it first begins to boil, and turn it when rather more than half done. A couple of spoonsful of gravy, half as much catsup, and a slight seasoning of spice would, to many tastes, improve this dish, of which, however, the great recommendation is its wholesome simplicity, which renders it suitable to the most delicate stomach. A thick mutton cutlet from the middle of the leg is excellent dressed thus. lj to 1 j hour. BEEF OR M;UTTON CAKE. ( Very good.) Chop two pounds of lean and very tender beef or mutton, with three-quarters of a pound of beef-suet; mix them well, and season them with a dessert- spoonful of salt, nearly as much pounded cloves, a tea- spoonful of pounded mace, and half a teaspoonful of cayenne. Line a round baking-dish with thin slices o^ fat bacon, press the meat closely into it, smooth the top, and cover it with bacon, set a plate on it with a weight, and bake it two hours and a*quarter. Take off the bacon, and serve the meat hot, with a little rich brown gravy, or set it by till cold, when it will be equally good. The fat of the meat that is used for this dish can be chopped up with it instead of suet, where it is liked as w~ell; and onion, or eschalot, shred fine, minced savoury herbs, grated lemon-peel, rasped bacon, or mushrooms cut small, may in turn be added to vary it in flavour. Lean beef or mutton, 2 lbs.; suet, fib.; salt andMODERN COOKERY. [[chap. yiii. 212 cloves in powder, each a dessertspoonful; mace, 1 tea- spoonful ; half as much cayenne : 2\ hours. Obs.—Sausage-meat, highly seasoned, eats well, baked as above. A larger portion of suet or of fat will render these cakes lighter, but will not otherwise improve them: they may be made of veal or of venison, but one third of mutton-suet or fat bacon should be mixed with this last. GERMAN STEW. Cut into about three-inch squares, two pounds and a half of the leaner part of the veiny piece of beef, or of any joint that is likely to be tender, and set it on to stew, with a pint and three quarters of cold broth, or water, and one large onion sliced. When these begin to boil, add a teaspoonful of salt, and a third as much of pepper, and let them simmer gently for an hour and a half. Have ready some young white cabbages, par- boiled ; press the water well from them, and lay them in with the beef; and let the whole stew for another hour. More onions, and a seasoning of mixed spices, or a few bits of lean bacon, or of ham, can be added to this stew when a higher flavour is desired; but it is very good without.

On three pounds of tender rump of beef, freed from skin and fat, and cut down into about two-inch squares, pour rather more than a quart of cold broth or gravy. When it boils add salt if required, and a little cayenne, and keep it just simmering for a couple of hours; then put to it the grated rind of a large lemon, or of two small ones, and half an hour after, stir to it a table- spoonful of rice-flour, smoothly mixed with a wineglass- ; ful of mushroom-catsup, a dessertspoonful of lemon-juice, and a teaspoonful of soy : in fifteen minutes after it will be ready to serve. A glass and a half of port, or of white wine, will greatly improve this stew, which may likewise be flavoured wdth the store-sauce of page 160, or with another, which we find excellent for the pur- pose, made with half a pint of port-wine, the same of mushroom-catsup, a quarter pint of walnut-pickle, a tablespoonful of the best soy, and a dessertspoonful of cayenne-vinegar, all well shaken together and poured into a bottle containing the thin rind of a lemon and two fine mellow anchovies, of moderate size. A few delicate fried forcemeat balls may be slipped into it after it is dished. Ohs.—The limits of our work will not permit us to devote a further space to this class of dishes, but an in- telligent cook will find it easy to vary them in number- less ways. Mushrooms, celery, carrots, sweet herbs, parboiled new potatoes, green peas, rice, and currie- powder may be advantageously used for that purpose. Oxtails, just blanched and cut into joints, will be found excellent substitutes for the beef: mutton and veal may also be dressed in the same way. The meat and vege- tables can be browned before broth or water is poured to them ; but though perhaps more savoury, the stew wdil then be much less delicate. Each kind of vegetableMODERN COOKERY. 214 [chap. VIIT. should be allowed something more than sufficient time to render it perfectly tender, but not so much as would reduce it to pulp. TO STEW SHIN OF BEEF. Wash, and set it on to stew in sufficient cold water to keep it just covered until it is done. When it boils, take off the scum, and put an ounce and a quarter of salt to the gallon of water. It is usual to add a few cloves, and some black pepper slightly bruised and tied up loosely in a fold of muslin; two or more onions, a root of celery, a bunch of savoury herbs, four or five carrots, and as many turnips, either whole or sliced: if to be served with the meat, these two last will require little more than the ordinary time of boiling, but otherwise they may be simmered with the meat from the begin- ning. Give the beef from four to five hours’ gentle stewing; and serve it with part of its own liquor thick- ened and flavoured, or quite plain. An excellent dish for a family may be made by stewing the thick fleshy part of the shin or leg, in stock made of the knuckle, with^a few bits of lean ham or a slice of hung beef, from which the smoked edges have been carefully pared away, and some spice, salt, and vegetables: by frying these last before they are thrown into the soup-pot the savour of the stew will be greatly heightened; and a tureen of good soup may be made of its remains, after it has been served at table. Ox-cheek, after having been soaked for four or five hours, and washed with great nicety, may be dressed like the shin; but as it has little flavour, the gravy should be strained, and quite cleared from fat, then put into a clean saucepan, and thickened as soon as it boils, with the following mixture:—three dessertspoonsful of rice-flour, nearly a wine-glassful of catsup, a teaspoon- ful of currie-powder, or a little powdered ginger and cayenne. When these have stewed ten minutes, dish the head, pour the sauce over, and serve it. Shin of beef, 4 to 5 hours. Ox-cheek, 2 to 3 hours.BEEF. CHAP. VIII.] 215 FRENCH BEEF A LA MODE. (J. common Receipt.') Take seven or eight pounds of a rump of beef (or of any other tender joint), free from bone, and skewer it firmly into a good shape. Put two ounces of butter into a thick saucepan or stewpan, and when it boils, stir to it a tablespoonful of flour; keep these well shaken over a gentle fire until they are of a fine amber colour ; then lay in the beef, and brown it on both sides, taking care that it shall not stick to the pan. Pour to it by slow degrees, letting each portion boil before the next is added, or the butter will float upon the surface and be difficult to clear off afterwards, three quarters of a pint of hot water, or gravy; add a bunch of savoury herbs, one large, or two small carrots cut in thick slices, two or three moderate-sized onions, two bay-leaves, and sufficient pepper and salt to season the gravy. Let the meat simmer gently from four to five hours, and turn it when it is half done. When ready to serve, lift the beef into a hot dish, lay the vegetables round, and pour the gravy over it, after having taken out the herbs, and skimmed away the fat. In France, half or the whole of a calf’s foot is stewed with the beef, which is there generally larded through with thick strips of fat bacon. (For larding see page 200.) Veal dressed in this way is even better than beef. The stewpan used for either, should be as nearly the size of the meat as possible. Beef, 7 to 8 lbs. : 4 to 5 hours. STEWED SIRLOIN OF BEEF. As a matter of convenience we have occasionally had this joint stewed instead of roasted, and have found it excellent. Cut out the inside or fillet as entire as possi- ble, and reserve it for a separate dish ; then remove the bones with care, or let the butcher do this for you ; spread the meat flat on a table and cover the inside with thin slices of striped bacon, after having first strewed over it a mixed seasoning of a small teaspoonful of salt,216 ' MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. VIII. half as much mace or nutmeg, and a moderate quantity of pepper or cayenne. Roll and bind the meat firmly, lay it into a stewpan or thick iron saucepan nearly of its size, and add the bones and as much good beef broth as will nearly cover the joint. Should this not be at hand, put a few slices of lean ham or bacon under the beef, and lay round it three pounds of neck or knuckle of veal, or of stewing-beef, divided into several parts, then pour to it cold water instead of broth. In either case, so soon as it has boiled a few minutes and been well cleaned from scum, throw in a large faggot of savoury herbs, three or four carrots, as many leeks, or a large onion, stuck with a dozen cloves, and, an hour later, two blades of mace, and half a teaspoonful of pepper- corns. Stew the beef very gently indeed from four to five hours, and longer, should the joint be large : serve it with a good Espagnole, sauce-piquante, or brown caper sauce. Add what salt may be needed before the vege- tables are thrown in; and, after the meat is lifted out, boil down to soup or gravy the liquor in which it has been stewed. To many tastes it would be an improve- ment to flour and brown the outside of the beef in butter before the broth or water is poured to it: it may also be stewed (but somewhat longer) half-covered with rich gravy, and turned when partially done. Minced eschalots may be strewed over the inside before it is rolled, when their strong savour is relished, or veal force- meat may supply their place. TO STEW A RUMP OF BEEF. This joint is more easily carved, and is of better appearance when the bones are removed before it is dressed. Roll and bind it firmly, cover it with strong cold beef-broth or gravy, and stew it very gently indeed from six hours to between seven and eight ; add to it after the scum has been well cleared off, one large or two moderate-sized onions stuck with thirty cloves, a head of celery, two carrots, two turnips, and a large faggot of savoury herbs. When the beef is perfectly217 BEEF. CHAP. VIII.] tender quite through, which may be known by probing it with a sharp thin skewer, remove the fillets of tape, dish it neatly, and serve it with a rich Espagnole, and a garnish of forced tomatas, or with a highly-flavoured brown English gravy, and stewed carrots in the dish : for these last the mild preparation of garlic or eschalots, of page 146, may be substituted with good effect: they should be well drained, laid round the meat, and a little brown gravy poured over the whole. This is the most simple and economical manner of stewing the beef; but should a richer one be desired, half roast the joint, and stew it afterwards in strong gravy, to which a pint of mushrooms, and a pint of sherry or Madeira, should be added an hour before it is ready for table. Keep it hot while a portion of the gravy is thickened with a well-made brown roux (see Chapter IV. page 114.), and seasoned with salt, cayenne, and any other spice it may require. Garnish it with large balls of forcemeat, highly seasoned with minced escha- lots, rolled in egg and bread-crumbs, and fried a fine golden brown. Plainly stewed from 6 to 7 or 8 hours. Or : half roasted, then stewed from 4 to 5 hours. Ohs.—Grated horse-radish, mixed with some well- thickened brown gravy, a teaspoonful of mustard, and a little lemon-juice or vinegar, is a good sauce for stewed beef. BEEF PALATES. First rub them well with salt, to take off the slime ; then wash them thoroughly in several waters, and leave them to soak for half an hour before they are dressed. Set them over the fire in cold water, and boil them gently until the skin will peel off, and the palates are tolerably tender. It is difficult to state the exact time required for this, as some will be done enough in twTo hours and a half, and others in not less than from four to five hours. When thus prepared, the palates may be cut into various forms, and simmered till fit to218 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. VIII. serve, in rich brown gravy, highly flavoured with ham, cayenne, wine, and lemon-peel; or they will make an excellent currie. As they are very insipid of themselves, they require a sauce of some piquancy, in which, after they have been peeled and trimmed, they should be stewed from twenty to thirty minutes, or until they are perfectly tender. The black parts of them must be cut away, when the skin is taken off. An onion, stuck with a few cloves, a carrot sliced, a teaspoonful of whole white pepper, a slice of butter, and a teaspoonful of salt, may be boiled with the palates in the first instance; and they will be found very good, if sent to table in the curried gravy of Chapter XIV., or in the Soubise, or onion-sauce d la Royale, of Chapter IV., made thinner than the receipts direct. Boiled from 2| to 4 or 5 hours. Stewed from 20 to 30 minutes. Obs.—A French cook of some celebrity, orders the palates to be laid on the gridiron until the skin will peel or scrape off: the plan seems a good one, but we have not tried it. BEEF PALATES. (Neapolitan Mode.) Boil the palates until the skin can be easily removed, then stew them very tender in good veal broth, lay them on a drain and let them cool; cut them across obliquely into strips of about a quarter inch in width, and finish them by either of the receipts for dressing maccaroni, which will be found in Chapters XIV. and XVIII. STEWED OX-TAILS. They should be sent from the butcher ready jointed. Soak and wash them w'ell, cut them into joints, or into lengths of two or three joints, and cover them with cold broth or water. As soon as they boil, remove the scum, and add a half teaspoonful of salt, or as much more as may be needed, and a little common pepper, or cayenne, an onion stuck with half a dozen cloves, two or three219 CHAP. VIII,] BEEF. small carrots, and a bunch or two of parsley. When these have simmered for two hours and a quarter, try the meat with a fork, and should it not be perfectly tender, let it remain over the fire till it is so. Ox-tails sometimes require nearly or quite three hours’ stewing: they may be served with the vegetables, or with the gravy strained from them, and thickened like the English stew, (see page 213.) Ox-tails, 2; water or broth to cover them; salt, | teaspoonful or more; little pepper or cayenne ; onion, 1 ; cloves, 6 ; carrots, 2 or 3; parsley, 2 or 3 branches i 2J to 3 hours. BROILED OX-TAIL. ( Very good.) When the ox-tail is ready for the stewpan, throw it into plenty of boiling water, slightly salted, and simmer it for fifteen minutes, then take it up, and put it into fresh water to cool ; wipe it, and lay it round in a small stewpan without dividing it; just cover it with good beef gravy, and stew it gently till very tender; drain it a little, sprinkle over it a small quantity of salt and cayenne, dip it into clarified butter, then into some fine bread-crumbs, with which it should be thickly covered; lay it on the gridiron, and when equally browned all over, serve it immediately. If more con- venient, the ox-tail may be set into the oven, or before the fire, till properly coloured : it may likewise be sent to table without broiling, dished upon stewed cabbage, or in its own gravy, thickened, and with tomata sauce, in a tureen. TO SALT AND PICKLE BEEF, IN VARIOUS WAYS. Let the meat hang a couple of days in mild weather, and four or five in winter, before it is salted or pickled. During the heat of summer it is better to immerse it entirely in brine, that it may be alike secured from the flies, and from the danger of becoming putrid. Trim it, and take out the kernels from the fat; then220 [CHAP. VIII. MODERN COOKERY. rub a little fine dry salt over it, and leave it until the following day; drain it well from the blood which will be found to have flowed from it, and it will be ready for any of the following modes of curing, which are all excellent of their kind, and have been well proved. In very cold weather, the salt may be applied quite warm to the meat: it should always be perfectly dry, and reduced to powder. Saltpetre hardens and renders meat indigestible; sugar, on the contrary, mellows and improves it much ; and it is more tender when cured with bay-salt than when common salt is used for it. TO SALT AND BOIL A ROUND OF BEEF. Mix an ounce of saltpetre, finely pow*dered, with half a pound of very coarse sugar, and rub the beef tho- roughly with them ; in two days, add three quarters of a pound of common salt, well dried and beaten; turn and rub the meat well in every part with the pickle for three weeks, when it will be fit to dress. Just wash off the salt, and skewer the beef as round and as even as possible; bind it tightly with broad tape, cover it with cold water, and let it simmer gently for at least five hours. Carrots, mashed turnips, or cabbages are usually served with boiled beef; and horse-radish stewed for ten minutes in equal parts of vinegar and water, then pressed well from them, and mixed witli some rich melted butter is a good sauce for it. Beef, 20 lbs. ; coarse sugar, \ lb.; saltpetre, 1 oz. : 2 days. Salt, J lb. : 21 days. Boil 5 hours or more. Obs.—Beef cured by this receipt, if properly boiled, is tender, of a good colour and flavour, and not over salt. The rump, edge-bone, and brisket maybe salted, or pickled in the same way as the round. HAMBURGH PICKLE FOR BEEF, HAMS, AND TONGUE. Boil together, for twenty minutes, two gallons of water, three pounds of bay-salt, two pounds of coarse sugar, two ounces of saltpetre, and two of black pepper,CHAP. VIII.] 221 BEEF. bruised, and tied in a bit of muslin ; clear off the scum thoroughly, as it rises, pour the pickle into a deep earthen pan, and when it is quite cold lay in the meat, of which every part must be perfectly covered with it. A moderate-sized round of beef will be ready for table in a fortnight: it should be turned occasionally in the brine. Five pounds of common salt may be substituted for the quantity of bay-salt given above; but the meat will not be so finely flavoured. Water, 2 gallons; bay-salt, 3 lbs.; saltpetre, 2 ozs.; black pepper, 2 ozs. : 20 minutes. ANOTHER PICKLE FOR TONGUES, BEEF, AND HAMS. To three gallons of spring-water, add six pounds of common salt, two pounds of bay-salt, two pounds of common loaf-sugar, and two ounces of saltpetre. Boil the whole over a gentle fire; and whilst boiling, skim it carefully : when quite cold it will be fit for use. Rub the meat to be cured with fine salt, and let it drain for a day or two, in order to free it from the blood; then im- merse it in the above brine, taking care that every part of it shall be covered. Young pork should not remain more than from three to five days in the pickle; but hams for drying may be left in it for a fortnight at least: tongues will be ready in rather less time. Beef may remain from one week to two, according to its size, and the degree of saltness desired for it. A little expe- rience will soon teach the exact time required for the different kinds of meat. When the pickle has been in use about three months, boil it up again gently, and take the scum carefully off. Add to it three pounds of common salt, four ounces of sugar, and one of saltpetre : it will remain good for a year or more. Water, 3 gallons; common salt, 6 lbs.; bay-salt, 2 lbs.; loaf sugar, 2 lbs.; saltpetre, 2 ozs. : boil 20 to 30 minutes. DUTCH, OR HUNG BEEF. For fourteen pounds weight of the round, the rump,222 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. VIII. or the thick flank of beef, mix two ounces of saltpetre with the same quantity of coarse sugar; rub the meat with them in every part, and let it remain two days, then add one pound of bay-salt, four ounces of common salt, and one ounce of ground black pepper. Hub these ingredients thoroughly into the beef, and in four days pour over it a pound of treacle; rub and turn it daily for a fortnight; drain, and send it to be smoked. When wanted for table, lay it in plenty of cold water, boil it very slowly, and press it under a heavy weight while hot. A slice of this beef, from which the edges have been carefully trimmed, will serve to flavour soups or gravies as well as ham. Beef, 14 lbs.; saltpetre and coarse sugar, each 2 ozs. : 2 days. Bay-salt, 1 lb.; common salt, 4 ozs.; pepper, 1 oz. : 4 days. Treacle, 1 lb.: 14 days. Obs.—Three quarters of a pound of coarse sugar may be rubbed into the meat at first, and the treacle may be altogether omitted; cloves and mace, too, may be added in the same proportion as for spiced beef. COLLARED BEEF. Only the thinnest part of the flank, or the ribs, which are not so generally used for it, will serve conveniently for collaring. The first of these should be hung in a damp place for a day or two, to soften the outer skin ; then rubbed with coarse sugar, and left a couple of days; when, for eight pounds of the meat, one ounce of salt- petre, and half a pound of salt should be added. In ten days it will be fit to dress. The bones and tough inner skin must be removed, and the beef sprinkled thickly on the under side with parsley and other savoury herbs shred small, before it is rolled, which should be done very tightly : it must then be secured with a cloth, and bound as closely as possible wdtli broad tape. It will require nearly or quite five hours’ gentle boiling, and should be placed while hot under a weight, or in a press, without having the tape and cloth removedCHAP. VIII.] * BEEF. 223 Beef, 8 lbs.; sugar, 3 ozs.; salt, 8 ozs. : 10 days. Boil 5 hours. COLLARED BEEF. (Another way.) Mix half an ounce of saltpetre with the same quan- tity of pepper, four ounces of bay-salt, and four of common salt; with these rub well from six to seven pounds of the thin flank, and in four days add seven ounces of treacle; turn the beef daily in the pickle for a week or more ; dip it into water, bone it and skin the inside; roll and bind it up very tightly, lay it into cold water, and boil it three hours and a half. We have found beef dressed by this receipt extremely good : herbs can, of course, be added to it as usual. Spices and juniper berries would to many tastes improve it, but we give the receipt simply as we have been accustomed to have it used. Thin flank, 6 to 7 lbs.; bay-salt, and common salt, each 4 ozs. ; saltpetre, | oz.; pepper, J oz.: 4 days. Treacle, 7 ozs. : 8 to 10 days. Boiled 3J hours. A COMMON RECEIPT FOR SALTING BEEF. One ounce of saltpetre, and a pound of common salt, will be sufficient for sixteen pounds of beef. Both should be well dried, and finely powdered; the saltpetre rubbed first equally over the meat, and the salt next applied in every part. It should be rubbed thoroughly with the pickle and turned daily, from a week to ten days. An ounce or two of sugar mixed with the salt- petre will render the beef more tender and palatable. Beef, 16 lbs.; saltpetre, 1 oz.; salt, 1 lb.: 7 to 10 days. SPICED ROUND OF BEEF. ( Very highly flavoured.) Rub the beef well in every part with half a pound of coarse brown sugar, and let it remain two days; then reduce to' powder, and mix thoroughly before they are applied to the meat, two ounces of saltpetre, three-224 MODERN COOKERY. * [CHAP. VIII. quarters of a pound of common salt, a quarter pound of black pepper, three ounces of allspice, and four of bruised juniper-berries. Rub these ingredients strongly and equally over the joint, and do so daily for three weeks, turning it at the same time. Just wash off the spice, and put the beef into a tin, or covered earthen pan as nearly of its size as possible, with a cup of water or gravy ; cover the top thickly with chopped beef-suet, and lay a coarse thick crust over the pan; place the cover on it, and bake the meat from five to six hours in a well-heated oven, which should not, however, be suffi- ciently fierce to harden the outside of the joint, which, if properly managed, will be exceedingly tender. Let it cool in the pan; and clear off* the suet before it is dished. It is to be served cold, and will remain good for a fortnight. Beef, 20 to 25 lbs. weight; sugar, 3 ozs. : 2 days. Saltpetre, 2 ozs. ; common salt, J lb.; black pepper, 4 ozs.; allspice, 3 ozs.; juniper-berries, 4 ozs. : 21 days. Baked 5 to 6 hours. Obs.—We have not ourselves tested this receipt, but the meat cured by it has received such high commen- dations from several of our friends who have partaken of it frequently, that we think we may safely insert it without. The proportion of allspice appears to us more than would be agreeable to many tastes, and we would rather recommend that part of it should be omitted, and that a portion of nutmeg, mace, and cloves should be substituted for it; as we have found these spices to answer well in the following receipt. SPICED BEEF. {Good and wholesome.') For twelve pounds of the round, rump, or thick flank of beef, take a large teaspoonful of freshly-pounded mace, the same of ground black pepper, twice as much of cloves, one small nutmeg, and a quarter teaspoonful of cayenne, all in the finest powder. Mix them well with seven ounces of brown sugar, rub the beef with them225 CHAP. VIII.] BEEF. and let it lie three days; add to it then half a pound of fine salt, rub and turn it once in twenty-four hours for twelve days; just wash, but do not soak it; skewer, or bind it into good form, put it into a stewpan or sauce- pan nearly of its size, pour to it a pint and a half of good beef broth, and when it begins to boil, take off the scum, and throw in one small onion, a moderate sized faggot of thyme and parsley, and two large, or four small carrots. Let it simmer quite softly for four hours and a half, and if not wanted to serve hot, leave it in its own liquor until it is nearly cold. This is an excellent and far more wholesome dish than the hard, bright-coloured beef which is cured with large quantities of salt and saltpetre : two or three ounces of juniper-berries may be added to it with the spice, to heighten its flavour. Beef, 1 2 lbs.; sugar, 7 ozs. ; mace and black pepper, each, 1 large teaspoonful; cloves, in powder, 1 large dessertspoonful; nutmeg, 1 ; cayenne, J teaspoonful: 3 days. Fine salt, j lb.: 12 days. Beef broth (or bouillon), lj pint; onion, 1 small; bunch of herbs; carrots, 2 large, or 4 small: stewed 4-J hours. Obs.—We give this receipt exactly as we have often had it used, but celery and turnips might be added to the gravy ; and when the appearance of the meat is much considered, three-quarters of an ounce of saltpetre may be mixed with the spices; the beef may also be plainly boiled in water only, with a few vegetables, or baked in a deep pan with a little gravy. No meat must ever be left to cool in the stewpan or saucepan in which it is cooked; it must be lifted into a pan of its own depth, and the liquor poured upon it. A MINIATURE ROUND OF BEEF. “ Select a fine rib of beef, and have it cut small or large in width, according to your taste; it may thus be made to weigh from five to twelve pounds, or more. Take out the bone, and wrap the meat round like a fillet of veal, securing it with two or three wooden skewers ; place it in a strong pickle for four or five days, and then Q,[CHAP VIII. MODERN COOKERY. 226 cook it, taking care that it does not boil, but only simmers from forty minutes, or more, according to its size. It is best to put it on in hot water, as it will not draw the gravy so much as cold. Many persons adjust a rib of beef in this way for roasting : let them try it salted, and they need not envy the possessor of the finest round of beef.” We give the receipt to our readers in its original form, and we can assure them, from our own experience, that it is a good one; but we would recommend that, in dressing the meat, quite the usual time for each pound of it should be allowed. When boned and rolled at the butchers, the skewers should be removed when it is first brought in; it should be well wiped with a dry cloth, or washed with a little fresh brine, and a small quantity of salt and saltpetre should be rubbed over the inside; it may then be firmly bound with tape, and will be quite ready to boil when taken from the pickle. The sirloin, after the inside fillet is removed, may be cured and dressed in the same way, and will be found super- excellent, if the beef be well fatted and properly kept. The Hamburg pickle (see page 220,) is perhaps the best for these joints. Part of the rump, taken clear of bone, answers admirably when prepared by this receipt. STUFATO. (-4 Neapolitan Receipt.) “ Take about six pounds of the silver side of the round, and make several deep incisions in the inside, nearly through to the skin; stuff these with all kinds of savoury herbs, a good slice of lean ham, and half a small clove of garlic, all finely minced, and well mingled together; then bind and tie the meat closely round, so that the stuffing may not escape. Put four pounds of butter into a stewpan sufficiently large to contain some- thing more than that quantity, and the beef in addition ; so soon as it boils, lay in the meat, and! et it just simmer for five or six hours, and turn it every half hour at least, that it may be equally done. Boil for twenty-five minutes three pounds of pipe maccaroni, drain it per-227 BEEF. CIIAP. VIII.] fectly dry, and mix it with the gravy of the beef, with- out the butter, half a pint of very pure salad oil, and a pot of paste tomatas; mix these to amalgamation, without breaking the maccaroni ; before serving up, sprinkle Parmesan cheese thickly on the maccaroni.” We insert this receipt exactly as it was given to us by a friend, at whose table the dish was served with great success to some Italian diplomatists. From our own slight experience of it, we should suppose that the excellence of the beef is quite a secondary consideration, as all its juices are drawn out by the mode of cooking, and appropriated to the maccaroni, of which we must observe that three pounds would make too gigantic a dish to enter well, on ordinary occasions, into an English service. We have somewhere seen directions for making the stufato with the upper part of the sirloin, thickly larded with large, well-seasoned lardoons of bacon, and then stewed in equal parts of rich gravy, and of red or of white wine. BEEF ROLL ; OR, CANELLON DE BCEUF. Chop and mix thoroughly two pounds of lean and very tender beef, with one pound of slightly striped bacon ; season them with a large teaspoonful of pepper, a little salt, a small nutmeg, or two-thirds as much of mace, the grated rind of a lemon, or a teaspoonful of thyme and parsley finely minced. Form the whole into a thick rouleau, wrap a buttered paper round it, enclose it in a paste made of flour and water, and send it to a moderate oven for a couple of hours. Remove the paper and crust, and serve the meat with a little brown gravy. Lamb and veal are excellent dressed in this way, particularly when mixed with plenty of mushrooms. Brown cucumber-sauce should be served with the lamb ; and currie, or oyster sauce, when there are no mushrooms, with the veal. A flavouring of onion or of eschalot, where it is liked, can be added at228 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. VIII. pleasure to either of the above: suet, or the fat of the meat may be substituted for the bacon. Beef, 2 lbs.; bacon, 1 lb.; pepper, ^ oz.; little salt; small nutmeg; rind of 1 lemon, or fine herbs, 1 table- spoonful : baked 2 hours. MINCED COLLOPS AU NATUREL. Mince finely a pound of very tender undressed beef, free from fat or skin ; season it with a moderate quantity of pepper and salt, set it over a gentle fire, and keep it stirred with a fork until it is quite hot, that it may not gather into lumps. Simmer it very slowly in its own gravy from ten to twelve minutes, and then, should it be too dry, add a little boiling water, broth, or gravy; stew it two minutes longer, and serve it directly. These collops are particularly suited to persons in delicate health, or of weak digestion ; and when an extra dish is required at a short notice, from the expe- dition with which they may be dressed, they are a convenient resource. 10 to 12 minutes. SAVOURY MINCED COLLOPS. Make a little brown thickening (see page 114.) with about an. ounce and a half of butter, and a dessertspoon- ful of Hour ; when it begins to be coloured, shake lightly into it a large teaspoonful of finely-shred parsley or mixed savoury herbs, two-thirds as much of salt, and half the quantity of pepper. Keep these stirred over a gentle fire until the thickening is of a deep amber colour; then add a pound of rump-steak, finely minced, and keep it well separated with a fork until it is quite hot; next pour to it gradually half a cupful of boiling water, and stew the collops very gently for ten minutes. Before they are served, stir to them a little catsup. Chili vinegar, or lemon-juice, a small quantity of minced onion, eschalot, or a particle of garlic, may be added at first to the thickening when their flavour is desired.BEEF. CHAP. VIII.] 229 A RICHER VARIETY OF MINCED COLLOPS. Omit the minced herbs from the thickening, and season it with cayenne and a small quarter-teaspoonful of pounded mace. Substitute beef-gravy for the boil- ing water, and when the collops are nearly done, fill a wineglass with one-fourth of mushroom catsup, and three of port wine, and stir these to the meat. Serve the collops very hot, and garnish them with alternate forcemeat balls (see No. 1, page 170,) and fried sippets. If flavoured with a little gravy made from the bones of a roast hare, and served with currant-jelly, these collops would scarcely be distinguished from game. SCOTCH MINCED COLLOPS. “ Chop the beef small, season it with salt and pepper, and put it, in its raw state, into small jars, and pour on the top some clarified butter. When wanted for use put the clarified butter into a frying-pan, and slice some onions into the pan and fry them. Add a little water to them, and then put in the minced meat. Stew it well,, and in a few minutes it will be fit to serve.” BEEF TONGUES. These may be cured by any of the receipts which we have already given for pickling beef, or for those which will be found further on for hams and bacon. Some persons prefer them cured with salt and saltpetre only, and dried naturally in a cool and airy room. For such of our readers as like them highly and richly flavoured we give our own method of having them prepared, which is this :—Rub the tongue over with a handful of fine salt, and let it drain until the following day ; then, should it weigh from seven to eight pounds, mix tho- roughly an ounce of saltpetre, two ounces of the coarsest sugar, and half an ounce of black pepper ; when the tongue has been well rubbed with these, add three ounces of bruised juniper-berries; and when it has laid two days, eight ounces of bay-salt, dried and pounded ;MODERN COOKERY. 230 [CHAP. VIII. at the end of three days more, pour on it half a pound of treacle, and let it remain in the pickle a fortnight after this ; then hang it to drain, fold it in brown paper, and send it to be smoked over a wood fire for two or three weeks. Should the peculiar flavour of the juniper- berries prevail too much, or he disapproved, they may be in part, or altogether, omitted; and six ounces of sugar may be rubbed into the tongue in the first instance when it is liked better than treacle. Tongue, 7 to 8 lbs. ; saltpetre, 1 oz. * black pepper, ^ oz.; sugar, 2 ozs.; juniper-berries, 3 ozs. : 2 days. Bay-salt, 8 ozs. : 3 days. Treacle, ^ lb.: 14 days. Obs.—Before the tongue is salted, the gullet, which has an unsightly appearance, should be trimmed away : it is indeed usual to take the root off entirely, but some families prefer it left on for the sake of the fat. BEEF TONGUES. (A Suffolk Receipt.} For each very large tongue, mix with half a pound of salt two ounces of saltpetre and three-quarters of a pound of the coarsest sugar; rub the tongues daily, and turn them in the pickle for five weeks, when they will be fit to be dressed, or to be smoked. 1 large tongue; salt, J lb.; sugar, f lb.; saltpetre, 2 ozs. : 5 weeks. TO DRESS BEEF TONGUES. When taken fresh from the pickle they require no soaking, unless they should have remained in it much beyond the usual time, or have been cured with a more than common proportion of salt; but when they have been smoked and hung for some time, they should be laid for two or three hours in cold, and as much longer in tepid water, before they are dressed : if extremely dry, ten or twelve hours must be allowed to soften them, and they should always be brought very slowly to boil. Two or three carrots and a large bunch of savoury herbs, added after the scum is cleared off, will improve them.BEEF, CHAP. VIII.] 231 They should be simmered until they are extremely tender, when the skin will peel from them easily. A highly-dried tongue will usually require from three and a half to four hours, boiling; an unsmoked one about an hour less; and for ‘ one that has not been salted at all a shorter time will suffice. BORDYKE RECEIPT FOR STEWING A TONGUE. After the tongue has been soaked, trimmed, and washed with extreme nicety, lay it into a vessel of fitting size, and place round it three or four pounds of the neck, or of any other lean cuttings of beef, with some bones of undressed veal, and pour in sufficient cold water to keep it covered until it is done ; or, instead of this, use strong unseasoned beef broth made wdth the shin, and any odd bits or bones of veal that may be at hand. Let the tongue be brought to boil very gradu- ally, that it may be plump and tender. Remove the scum when it first rises, and when it is quite cleared off add a large faggot of parsley, thyme, and winter savory, three carrots, a small onion, and one mild turnip. After three hours and a half of gentle simmering, probe the tongue, and if sufficiently done peel off the skin and serve it quickly. If not wanted hot for table, lay it on a very clean board or trencher, and fasten it down to it by passing a carving fork through the root, and a smaller one through the tip, drawing the tongue straight with the latter before it is fixed in the board: let it remain thus till quite cold. It is much the fashion at present to glaze hams and tongues, but this should never be attempted by a cook not well acquainted with the man- ner of doing it, and the proper flavour and appearance of the glaze. For directions to make it, see page 111. Where expense is not regarded, three or four pounds of veal may be added to the beef in this receipt, or the tongue may be stewed in a prepared gravy made with equal parts of beef and veal, and vegetables as above, but without salt: this may afterwards be converted into excellent soup. A fresh or an unsmoked tongue may232 MODERN COOKERY. [chap. VIII. be dressed in this way, but will require less time : for the former salt must be added to the gravy. TO ROAST A BEEF HEART. Wash and soak the heart very thoroughly, cut away the lobes, fill the cavities with a veal forcemeat (No. 1, page 170), secure it well with a needle and twine, or very coarse thread, and roast the heart at a good fire for an hour and a half, keeping it basted plentifully with butter. Pour melted butter over it, afteir it is dished, and send it to table as hot as possible. Many persons boil the heart for three-quarters of an hour before it is put to the fire, and this is said to render it more delicate eating: the time of roasting must of course be proportionately diminished. Good brown gravy may be substituted for the melted butter, and currant jelly also served with it. 1-J- hour, or more. BEEF KIDNEY. Slice the kidney rather thin, after having stripped off the skin and removed the fat; season it with pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg, and sprinkle over it plenty of minced parsley, or equal parts of parsley and eschalots chopped very small. Fry the slices over a brisk fire, and when nicely browned on both sides, stir amongst them a teaspoonful of flour, and pour in by degrees a cup of gravy and a glass of white wine; bring the sauce to the point of boiling, add a morsel of fresh butter and a tablespoonful of lemon-juice, and pour the whole into a hot dish garnished with sippets of fried bread. This is a French receipt, and a very excellent one. BEEF KIDNEY. (A plainer way.') Trim, and cut the kidney into slices; season them with salt and pepper, and dredge them well with flour; fry them on both sides, and when they are done through lift them out, empty the pan, and make a gravy forCHAP. VIII.] 233 BEEF. them with a small slice of butter, a dessertspoonful of hour, pepper and salt, and a cup of boiling water; shake these round and give them a minute’s simmering ; add a little mushroom catsup, lemon juice, eschalot- vinegar, or any store sauce that will give a good flavour. Minced herbs are to many tastes an improvement to this dish : a small quantity of onion shred fine can be added where it is liked. 6 to 9 minutes. AN EXCELLENT HASH OF COLD BEEF. Put a slice of butter into a thick saucepan, and when it boils throw in a dessertspoonful of minced herbs, and an onion (or two or three eschalots) shred small; shake them over the fire until lightly browned, then stir in a tablespoonful of flour, a little cayenne, some mace or nutmeg, and half a teaspoonful of salt. When the wdiole is well coloured, pour to it three-quarters of a pint or more of broth or gravy, according to the quantity of meat to be served in it. Let this boil gently for fifteen minutes, then strain it; add half a wineglassful of mush- room or compound catsup; lay in the meat, and keep it by the side of the fire until it is heated through and is on the point of simmering, but be sure not to let it boil. Put some fried or toasted sippets into a very hot dish, and serve the hash directly. A COMMON HASH OF COLD BEEF OR MUTTON. Take the meat from the bones, slice it small, trim off the brown edges, and stew down the trimmings with the bones well broken, an onion, a bunch of thyme and parsley, a carrot cut into thick slices, a few pepper- corns, four cloves, some salt, and a pint and a half of water. When this is reduced to little more than three- quarters of a pint, strain it, clear it from the fat, thicken it with a large dessertspoonful of rice-flour, or rather less of arrow-root; add salt and pepper if needed, boil the whole for a few’ minutes, then lay in the meat and234 [chap. VIII. MODERN COOKERY. heat it well. Boiled potatoes are sometimes sliced hot into a very common hash. Ohs.—The cook should be reminded that if the meat in a hash or mince he allowed to boil, it will imme- diately become hard, and can then only be rendered eatable by very long stewing, which is by no means desirable for meat that is already sufficiently done. BRESLAW OF BEEF. {Good.) Trim the brown edges from half a pound of under- dressed roast beef, shred it small and mix it with four ounces of fine bread-crumbs, a teaspoonful of minced parsley, and two-thirds as much of thyme, two ounces of butter, broken small, half a cupful of gravy, or cream, a high seasoning of pepper and Cayenne, and mace, or nutmeg, a small teaspoonful of salt, and three large eggs, well beaten. Melt a little butter in a pie- dish, pour in the beef, and bake it half an hour; turn it out, and send it to table with brown gravy in a tureen. When cream or gravy is not at hand, an additional egg or two, and rather more butter, must be used. We think that grated lemon-rind improves the breslaw. A portion of fat from the joint can be added where it is liked. The mixture is sometimes baked in buttered cups. Beef, l lb.; bread-crumbs, 4 ozs.; butter, 2 ozs.; gravy, or cream, ^ cupful; parsley, 1 teaspoonful ; thyme, two-thirds of teaspoonful; eggs, 3, or 4, if small ; salt, 1 teaspoonful; pepper and nutmeg, \ teaspoonful each : bake \ hour. NORMAN HASH. Peel and fry two dozens of button onions in butter until they are lightly browned, then stir to them a table- spoonful of flour, and when the whole is of a deep amber shade, pour in a glass and a half of red wine, and a large cup of boiling broth or water; add a seasoning of salt and common pepper, or cayenne, and a littleBEEF. 235 CHAP. VIII.] lemon-pickle, catsup, or lemon-juice, and boil the whole until the onions are quite tender; cut and trim into small handsome slices the remains of either a roast or boiled joint of beef, and arrange them in a clean sauce- pan ; pour the gravy and onions on them, and let them stand for a while to imbibe the flavour of the sauce; then place the hash near the fire, and when it is thoroughly hot, serve it immediately, without allowing it to boil. FRENCH RECEIPT FOR HASHED BOUILLI. Shake over a slow fire a bit of butter the size of an egg, and a tablespoonful of flour; when they have sim- mered for a minute, stir to them a little onion, shred fine, and a dessertspoonful of minced parsley ; so soon as the whole is equally browned, add sufficient pepper, salt, and nutmeg to season the hash properly, and from half to three-quarters of a pint of boiling water or bouillon. Put in the beef cut into small but thick slices ; let it stand by the fire and heat gradually; and when near the point of boint of boiling thicken the sauce with the yolks of three eggs, mixed with a tablespoonful of lemon- juice. For change, omit the eggs, and substitute a tablespoonful of catsup, and another of sliced or minced pickled gherkins. BAKED MINCED BEEF. Mince tolerably fine, with a moderate proportion of its own fat, as much of the inside of a cold roast joint as will suffice for a dish: that which is least done is best for the purpose. Season it rather highly with cayenne and mace, or nutmeg, and moderately with salt; add, if approved, one or two eschalots, minced small, with a few chopped mushrooms, either fresh or pickled, or two tablespoonsful of mushroom catsup. Moisten the whole, mixing it well, with a cupful of good gravy, and put it into a deep dish. Place on the top an inch thick layer of bread-crumbs ; moisten these plentifully with clarified butter, passed through a small strainer overMODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. VIII. 236 them, and send the mince to a slow oven for twenty minutes, or brown it in a Dutch oven. SAUNDERS. Spread on the dish in which the saunders are to be served, a layer of smoothly mashed potatoes, that have been seasoned with salt and mixed with about an ounce of butter to the pound. On these spread equally and thickly some istsdressed beef or mutton, minced, and mixed with a little of the gravy that has run from the the joint, or a few spoonsful of any other; some salt, pepper, and a small quantity of nutmeg. Place evenly over this another layer of potatoes, and send the dish to the oven for half an hour. A very superior kind of saunders is made by substituting fresh meat for roasted; but this requires to be baked an hour or something more. Sausage-meat, highly seasoned, may be served in this way, instead of beef or mutton. TO BOIL MARROW BONES. Let the large ends of the bones be sawn by the butcher, so that when they are dished they may stand upright; and if it can be done conveniently, let them be placed in the same maimer in the vessel in which they are boiled. Put a bit of paste, made with flour and water, over the ends where the marrow is visible, and tie a cloth tightly over them ; take the paste off before the bones are sent to table, and serve them, placed upright in a napkin, with slices of dry toasted bread, apart. When not wanted for immediate use, they may be partially boiled, and set into a cool place, where they will remain good for many days. Large marrow-bones, 2 hours; moderate sized, \\ hour. To keep : boil them \\ hour, and from -J to J hour more when wanted for table. BAKED MARROW BONES. When the bones have been sawn to the length of a deep pie-dish, wash and wipe them dry, lay them into237 VEAL. CHAP. IX.] it, and cover them entirely with a good batter. Send * them to a moderate oven for an hour or more, and serve them in the batter. CLARIFIED MARROW FOR KEEPING. Take the marrow from the bones while it is as fresh as possible ; cut it small, put it into a very clean jar, and melt it with a gentle heat, either in a pan of water placed over the fire, or at the mouth of a cool oven; strain it through a muslin, let it settle for a minute or two, and pour it, clear of sediment, into small jars. Tie skins, or double folds of thick paper, over them as soon as the marrow is cold, and store it in a cool place. It will remain good for months. CHAPTER IX. VEAL. TO CHOOSE VEAL. Veal should be fat, finely grained, white, firm, and not overgrown; for when very large it is apt to beMODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. IX. 238 coarse and tough. It is more difficult to keep than any other meat except pork, and should never be allowed to acquire the slightest taint before it is dressed, as any approach to putridity renders it equally unwholesome and offensive to the taste. The fillet, the loin, the shoulder, and the best end of the neck, are the parts generally selected for roasting; the breast and knuckle are more usually stewed or boiled. The udder, or firm white fat of the fillet, is much used by French cooks instead of butter, especially in the com- position of their forcemeats: for these, it is first well boiled, then left until quite cold, and afterwards thoroughly pounded before it is mixed with the other ingredients. The head and feet of the calf are valu- able articles of food, both for the nutriment which the gelatinous parts of them afford, and for the great variety of modes in which they may be dressed. The kidneys, with the rich fat that surrounds them, and the sweetbreads especially, are well-known delicacies; the liver and the heart also are very good eating ; and no meat is so generally useful for rich soups and gravies as veal. TO TAKE THE HAIR FROM A CALF’s HEAD WITH THE SKIN ON. It is better to do this before the head is divided ; but if only the half of one with the skin on can be procured, it must be managed in the same way. Put it into plenty of water which is on the point of sim- mering, but which does not positively boil, and let it remain in until it does so, and for five or six minutes afterwards, but at the first full bubble draw it from the fire and let it merely scald ; then lift it out, and with a knife that is not sharp scrape off the hair as closely and as quickly as possible. The butchers have an instru- ment on purpose for the operation; but we have had the head dook quite as well when done in the manner we have just described, as when it has been sent in ready prepared by them. After the hair is off, theCHAP. IX.] 239 VEAL. head should be well washed, and if it cannot be cooked the same day it must be wiped extremely dry before it is hung up ; and when it has not been divided it should be left whole until the time approaches for dressing it. The brain must then be taken out, and both that and the head well soaked and washed with the greatest nicety. When the half-head only is scalded, the brain should first be removed. Calves’ feet are freed from the hair easily in the same manner; indeed, we find it a better mode of having it cleared from them than the one we have given in Chapter XX., though' that is the one prac- tised by many good butchers. BOILED calf’s HEA.D. When the head is dressed with the skin on, which many persons prefer, the ear must be cut off quite close to it; it will require three-quarters of an hour, or upwards, of additional boiling, and should be served covered with fried crumbs : the more usual mode, how- ever, is to boil it without the skin. In either case, first remove the brain, wash the head delicately clean, and soak it for a quarter of an hour; cover it plentifully with cold water, remove the scum as it rises with great care, throw in a little salt, and boil the head gently until it is perfectly tender. In the mean time, wash and soak the brains first in cold and then in warm water, remove the skin or film, boil them in a small saucepan, from fourteen to sixteen minutes, according to their size, and w7hen they are done, chop and mix them with eight or ten sage leaves boiled tender, and finely minced, or, if preferred, with parsley boiled, instead ; warm them in a spoonful or two of melted butter, or white sauce ; skin the tongue, trim off the root, and serve it in a small dish with the brains laid round it. Send the head to table very hot with parsley and butter poured over it, and some more in a tureen. A cheek of bacon, or very delicate pickled pork, and greens, are the usual accom- paniments to boiled calf’s head. We have given here the common English mode of[CHAP, IX. 240 MODERN COOKERY. serving this dish, by some epicures considered the best, and by others, as exceedingly insipid. On the Continent, tomata-sauce takes place of the parsley and butter; and rich oyster, or Dutch sauce, are varieties often substi- tuted for it in this country. With the skin on, from 2 hours and J to 2 hours and | ; without the skin, from 1 hour and J to 1 hour and f. calf’s HEAD,—THE WARDER’S WAY. {An excellent Receipt.) Boil the half-head till tolerably tender, let it cool, and bone it entirely, replace the brain, lay the head into a stewpan, and simmer it gently for an hour in rich gravy. From five-and-twenty to thirty minutes before it is dished, add, if procurable, half a pint of mushroom- buttons. Thicken the gravy, if needful, with rice-flour, or with flour and butter, and serve plenty of forcemeat- balls round the head. For dishes of this kind, a little sweet-basil wine, or a few sprigs of the herb itself, im- part a very agreeable flavour. When neither these nor mushrooms are within reach, the very thin rind of a small but fresh lemon may be boiled in the gravy, and the strained juice added at the instant of serving. Boiled from 1 to 2 hours; stewed 1 hour. Obs.—The skin, with the ear, may be left on the bead for this receipt, and the latter slit into narrow strips from the tip to within an inch and a half of the base; which will give it a feathery and ornamental appearance: the head may then be glazed or not at pleasure. PREPARED calf’s HEAD. (The Cook’s Receipt.) Take away the brains and tongue from the half of a calf ’s head, and then remove the bones, being careful in doing so to keep the knife as close to them as possible, and to avoid piercing the outer skin : in this consists the whole art of boning, in which an attentive cook may241 CHAP. IX.] YEAL. may easily render herself expert. Next wash the head and dry it in a clean cloth; sprinkle over the inside a little pounded mace and cayenne, or white pepper; roll it up tightly, and bind it round with tape or twine. Lay into a small stewpot three or four pounds of neck of veal or beef, twice or thrice divided, and place the head upon it with the bones well broken ; pour in half a gallon of cold wafer, or as much as will suffice to keep the head covered until it is done, and simmer it very gently from an hour and a quarter to an hour and three quarters. When it is extremely tender, lift it out, and if wanted for table, remove the binding, and serve it very hot, with currie-sauce, rich oyster-sauce, or egg- sauce and brown gravy; but should the remains, or the whole of it be required for the following receipts, pour no gravy over it: in the latter case do not take off the tape for several hours. The tongue may be stewed with the head, but will require rather less time. We do not think it needful to repeat in every receipt our directions for adding salt to, and removing carefully the scum from, meats that are stewed or boiled, but the cook must not neglect either. When the trouble of boning is objected to, it can be dispensed with for some of the dishes which follow, but not for all. After the head is taken out, boil the gravy until it is well reduced, and rich : it should be strongly jellied when cold. A bone of ham, or a slice of hung-beef will much improve its flavour ; but vegetables must be avoided if it be wanted to keep : a little spice and a faggot of parsley may be added to it, and a calf’s foot will be sure to give it the requisite degree of firmness. This receipt is for a head without the skin. BURLINGTON WHIMSEY. ft * Set aside until quite cold half a calf’s head dressed by the preceding receipt. If on cutting it, the gelatinous part should not appear perfectly tender, pare it off closely from the head, weigh and mince it; put it into a pint of good gravy, and stew it gently from ten to RMODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. IX. 242 fifteen minutes. Mince as much more of the head as will make up a pound in weight after any discoloured edges are trimmed off, and part of the fat is taken away; add to this three ounces of the lean of a boiled ham chopped fine, the grated rind of a large lemon, three teaspoonsful of parsley and one of thyme shred very small, three quarters of a teaspoonful of mace, half a small nutmeg grated, a teaspoonfUl of salt, and a half-quarter one of cayenne; stir the whole well together, and put it, with half a pint more of gravy, to the portion that has been already simmered. When the whimsey has boiled softly from four to five minutes, pour it into moulds or pans, in which slices of the tongue have been evenly arranged, and when quite cold it will turn out very firmly. When sent to table it may be garnished with branches of parsley, which should, however, be perfectly dry; and when served for supper or luncheon, it may be accompanied by salad-sauce. Calf’s head, 1 lb.; lean of ham, 3 ozs.; gravy, 1J pint; rind of 1 large lemon; parsley. 3 teaspoonsful ; thyme and salt, each 1 teaspoonful; mace, j teaspoon- ful ; \ nutmeg; cayenne, £ part of teaspoonful : 5 minutes. Obs.—The remains of a plain boiled head may be made to serve for this dish, provided the gravy Used with it be well jellied and of high flavour. Slices from the small end of a boiled and smoked ox-tongue, from their bright colour improve greatly the appearance of the whimsey, which should be tasted before it is poured out, that salt or any other seasoning may be added if needful. After three or four days’ keeping, should any mould appear on the surface, take it off, re-melt the whimsey, and give it two minutes boil. For change, the herbs may be omitted, and the quantity of ham increased, or some minced tongue substituted for it. CUTLETS OF CALL’S HEAD. Prepare, by the cook’s receipt, half a calf’s head withCHAP. IX.] 243 YEAL. or without the skin on, only, in the latter case, allow more time for the boiling. When it is quite cold, re- move the fillets of tape, and cut the head into slices of half an inch thick, brush them over with yolk of egg, and dip them into fine breadcrumbs, seasoned with the grated rind of half a lemon, half a teaspoonful of salt, a dessertspoonful of minced savoury herbs, some cayenne, and a little of the lean of a boiled ham chopped very small, should this last be at hand. Fry the cutlets in butter of a fine light brown, make some gravy in the pan as for veal cutlets, and add to.it the juice of half a lemon; or mix a large teaspoonfui of currie-powder, and one of flour, very smoothly with the butter, shake them over the fire for four or five minutes, and let the gravy simmer as much longer, after the water is added; or serve the cutlets, covered with good mushroom sauce. HASHED calf’s HEAD. When the whole of this dish has to be prepared, make for it a quart of stock, and proceed in all else as directed for mock turtle soup (page 28) ; but after the head has been parboiled, cut down a full pound and a half of it for the hash, and slice it small and thick, instead of di- viding it into dice. Make the brains into cakes (see page 177), and garnish the dish with forcemeat-balls, rolled in egg, and the finest bread-crumbs, fried a deli- cate brown, and well-drained, and dried on a warm sieve reversed. The wine and other seasonings should be the same as for the soup. Rich gravy, 1 quart; flesh of calf’s head, full, 1 lb. and J ; ^yine, and other seasonings, as for mock turtle soup. Obs.—The gravy for this hash should be stewed with ham, eschalots, &c., exactly as for the soup. CHEAP HASH OF CALF’S HEAD. Take the flesh from the bone of a cold boiled head, and put it aside till wanted ; take about three pints of the liquor in which it was cooked ; break the bones, and[CHAP. IX. 244 MODERN COOKERY. stew them down with a small bunch of savoury herbs, a carrot, or two, should they be small, a little nicely- fried onion, four cloves, a dozen corns of pepper, and either a slice or two of lean unboiled ham, or the bone of a boiled one, quite cleared of flesh, well-bruised, and broken, and freed carefully from any of the smoked out- sides. If neither of these can be had, from half to a whole pound of neck of beef should be stewed with the bones, or the whole will be insipid in flavour. When the liquid is reduced nearly half, strain it, take off the fat, thicken it with a little well-made roux, or, if more convenient, with flour and butter, stirred into it, when it boils, or with rice-flour or arrow- root, mixed with a little spice, mushroom-catsup, or Harvey’s sauce, and a small quantity of lemon-pickle or Chili vinegar. Heat the meat slowly in the sauce when it is ready, but do not allow it to boil. The forcemeat, No. 1. of Chapter VI., may be rolled into balls, fried, and served round it. The gravy should be well- seasoned. TO DRESS COLD CALF’S HEAD OR VEAL A LA MAITRE D’HOTEL. (GOOD.) (.English Receipt.) Cut into small delicate slices, or scollops of equal size, sufficient cold calf’s head or veal for a dish. Next knead very smoothly together with a knife two ounces of butter, and a small dessertspoonful of flour; put these into a stewpan or well-tinned saucepan, and keep them stirred or shaken over a gentle fire until they have simmered for a minute or two, but do not let them take the slightest colour ; then add to them in very small portions (letting the sauce boil up after each is poured in) half a pint of pale veal gravy, or good shin-of-beef stock, and when the whole is very smoothly blended, and has boiled for a couple of minutes, mix together and stir to it a tablespoonful of common vine- gar, a dessertspoonful of Chili vinegar, a little cayenne, a tablespoonful of good mushroom catsup, and a veryCHAP. IX.] YEAL. 245 small bit of sugar; and when the sauce again boils, strew a tablespoonful of minced parsley over the meat, lay it in, and let it stand by the fire until it is quite heated through, but do not allow it to boil : if kept just at the simmering point for ten or twelve minutes it may be served perfectly hot without. The addition of the mushroom catsup converts this into an English sauce, and renders it in colour, as well as in flavour, unlike the French one which bears the same name, and which is acidulated generally with lemon-juice instead of vinegar. Pickled mushrooms are sometimes added to the dish : the parsley when it is objected to may be omitted, and the yolks of t.wo or three eggs mixed with a little cream may be stirred in, but not allowed to boil, just before the meat is served. When veal is used for this hash instead of calfs head, it should be cut in slices not much larger than a shilling, and freed entirely from fat% sinew, and the brown edges. When neither broth nor gravy is at hand, a morsel or two of lean ham, and a few of the trimmings or bones of the head or joint, may be boiled down to supply its place. Sufficient cold calfs head, or meat, for a dish; butter, 2 ozs.; flour, 1 small dessertspoonful; gravy, or strong broth, J pint; vinegar, and mushroom-catsup, of each 1 tablespoonful; Chili vinegar, 1 dessertspoon- ful ; small bit of sugar; little cayenne, and salt if needed; parsley, 1 tablespoonful (pickled mushrooms or not at pleasure). Obs.—Soles or codfish are very good, if raised neatly from the bones, or flaked, and heated in this Maitre d’Hotel sauce. calf’s head brawn. (Authors Receipt.) The half of a fine large calf’s head, with the skin on, will best answer for this brawn. Take out the brains, and bone it entirely, or get the butcher to do this; rub a little fine salt over, and let it drain for ten or twelve246 [chap. IX. MODERN COOKERY. hours; next wipe it dry, and rub it well in every part with three quarters of an ounce of saltpetre finely powdered (or with an ounce, should the head be very large) and mixed with four ounces of common salt, and three of bay-salt, also beaten fine; turn the head daily in this pickle for four or five days, rubbing it a little each time; and then pour over it four ounces of treacle, and continue to turn it every day, and baste it with the brine very frequently for a month. Then hang it up for a night to drain, fold it in brown paper, and send it to be smoked where wood only is burned, from three to four weeks. When wanted for table, wash and scrape it very clean, but do not soak it; lay it, with the rind downwards, into a saucepan or stewpan, which will hold it easily; cover it well with cold water, as it will swell considerably in the cooking. Let it heat rather slowly, skim it thoroughly when it first begins to simmer, and boil it as gently as possible from an hour and three quarters to a couple of hours or more, should it not then be perfectly tender quite througli ; for unless sufficiently boiled the skin, which greatly resembles brawn, will be unpleasantly tough when cold. When the fleshy side of the head is done, which will be twenty minutes or half an hour sooner than the out- side, pour the water from it, leaving so much only in the stewpan as will just cover the gelatinous part, and simmer it till this is thoroughly tender. The head thus cured is very highly flavoured, and most excellent eating. The receipt for it is entirely new, having originated with ourselves. We give the reader, in addition, the result of our first experiment with it, which was exceedingly successful :—“ A half calf’s head, not very large, without the skin, pickled with three ounces of common salt, two of bay-salt, half an ounce of saltpetre, one ounce of brown sugar, and half an ounce of pepper, left four days ; then three ounces of treacle added, and the pickling continued for a month ; smoked nearly as long, and boiled between one hour and a half and two hours.” The pepper was omittedVEAL. 247 CHAP. IX.] in our second trial, because it did not improve the appearance of the dish, although it was an advantage'in point of flavour. Juniper berries might, we think, be added with advantage, when they are liked; and cayenne tied in a muslin might supply the place of the pepper. It is an infinite improvement to have the skin of the head left on. TO ROAST A FILLET OF VEAL. Take out the bone and put a good roll of forcemeat, (No. 1, page 170) under the flap, dividing first, with a sharp knife, the skin from the meat sufficiently to admit the quantity required; secure it well, truss the veal firmly into good shape, place it at a distance from the fire at first, and baste it with butter. The outside will have a richer crust of browning if the meat be washed, wiped tolerably dry, and well floured before it is laid to the fire. It should be carefully watched, and basted often, that the fat may not burn. Pour melted butter over it after it is dished, and serve with it a boiled cheek of bacon and a lemon. Roast it from four to five hours, according to its size. BOILED FILLET OF VEAL. A small, and delicately white fillet should be selected for this purpose. Bind it round with tape, after having washed it thoroughly; cover it well with cold water, and bring it gently to boil; watch, and clear off care- fully, the scum as it rises, and be, at the same time, very cautious not to allow the water to become smoked. Let the meat be gently simmered from three hours and a half to four and a half, according to its weight. Send it to table with rich white sauce, and a boiled tongue ; or make for it in the first instance the oyster forcemeat of Chapter YI, and serve with the veal a tureen of well- made oyster-sauce. 3J hours to 4^. ROAST LOIN OF VEAL. It is not usual to stuff a loin of veal, but we greatly248 [CHAP. IX. MODERN COOKERY* recommend the practice, as an infinite improvement to the joint. Make the same forcemeat as for the fillet; and insert it between the skin and the flesh just over the ends of the bones. Skewer down the flap, place the joint at a moderate distance from a sound fire, keep it con- stantly basted, and be especially careful not to allow the kidney fat to burn : to prevent this, and to ensure the good appearance of the joint, a buttered paper should be fastened round the loin, and removed about half an hour beforp it is taken from the fire. It is the fashion in some counties to serve egg-sauce and brown gravy with roast loin, or breast of veal. The cook will scarcely need to be told that she must separate the skin from the flank, with a sharp knife, quite from the end, to the place where the forcemeat is to be put, and then skewer the whole very securely. When the veal is not papered, dredge it well with flour soon after it is laid to the fire. 2 hours to 2 J. BOILED LOIN OF VEAL. If dressed with care and served with good sauces, this, when the meat is small and white, is an excellent dish, and often more acceptable to persons of delicate habit than roast veal. Take from eight to ten pounds of the best end of the loin, leave the kidney in with all its fat, skewer or bind down the flap, lay the meat into cold water, and boil it as gently as possible from two hours and a quarter to two and a half, clearing off the scum perfectly, as in dressing the fillet. Send it to table with well-made oyster-sauce, or bechamel, or with white sauce well-flavoured with lemon juice, and with parsley, boiled, pressed dry, and finely chopped. 2\ hours to 2\. STEWED LOIN OF VEAL. Take part of a loin of veal, the chump end will do ; put into a large, thick, well-tinned iron saucepan, or into a stewpan, about a couple of ounces of butter, and249 YEAL. CHAP. IX.] shake it over a moderate fire until it begins to brown ; flour the veal well all over, lay it into the saucepan, and when it is of a fine amber-colour, pour gradually in veal-broth, gravy, or boiling water to nearly half its depth ; add a little salt, one or ’two sliced carrots, a small onion, or more when their flavour is much liked, and a bunch of parsley; stew the veal very softly for an hour or rather more, then turn it, and let it stew for nearly or quite another hour, or longer should if not appear perfectly done. As none of our receipts have been tried with large, coarse veal, the cooking must be regulated by that circumstance, and longer time allowed should the meat be of more than middling size. Dish the joint; skim all the fat from the gravy^ and strain it over the meat; or keep the joint hot while it is rapidly reduced to a richer consistency. This is merely a plain family stew. BOILED BREAST OF VEAL. Let both the veal and the sweetbread be washed with exceeding nicety, cover them with cold water, clear off the scum as it rises, throw in a little salt, add a bunch of parsley, a large blade of mace, and twenty white pepper-corns ; simmer the meat from an hour to an hour and a quarter, and serve it covered with rich onion sauce. Send it to table very hot. The sweetbread may be taken up when half done, and curried, or made into cutlets, or stewed in brown gravy. When onions are objected to, substitute white sauce, and a cheek of bacon for them, or parsley and butter, if approved. 1 to Ij hour. TO ROAST A BREAST OF VEAL. Let the caul remain skewered over the joint till within half an hour of its being ready for table; place it at a moderate distance from a brisk fire, baste it constantly, and in about an hour and a half remove the caul, flour the joint, and let it brown. Dish, and pour melted butter over it, and serve it with a cut lemon, andMODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. IX. 250 any other usual veal accompaniments. It may be garnished with fried forcemeat-balls of No. 1, Chapter VI., the size of a walnut. 2 to 2^ hours. Shoulder of Veal or TO BONE A SHOULDER OF VEAL, MUTTON, OR LAMB. Spread a clean cloth upon a table or dresser, and lay the joint flat upon it, with the skin down- wards ; with a sharp knife, cut i off the flesh from the inner side, nearly down to the blade-bone, of which detach the edges first, Mutton, boned and rolled, then work the knife under it, keeping it always dose to the bone, and using all possible precaution not to pierce the outer skin; when it is in every part separated from the flesh, loosen it from the socket with the point of the knife, and remove it; or, without dividing the two bones, cut round the joint till it is freed entirely from the meat, and proceed to detach the second bone. That of the knuckle is frequently left in, but for some dishes it is necessary to take it out; in doing this, be careful not to tear the skin. A most excellent grill may be made by leaving sufficient meat for it on the bones of a shoulder of mutton, when they are removed from the joint : it will be found very superior to the broiled blade-bone of a roast shoulder, which is so much esteemed by many people. STEWED SHOULDER OF VEAL. (English Receipt.) Bone a shoulder of veal, and strew the inside thickly with savoury herbs, shred fine ; season it well with salt, cayenne, and pounded mace; and place on these a layer of ham cut in thin slices, and freed from rind and rust. Boll the veal, and bind it tightly with a fillet; roast it for an hour and a half, then simmer it gently in good brown gravy for five hours ; add forcemeat balls before it is dished, skim the fat from the gravy, andCHAP. IX.] 251 VEAL. serve it with the meat. This receipt, for which we are indebted to a correspondent on whom we can depend, and which we have not, therefore, proved ourselves, is for a joint that weighs ten pounds before it is boned. ROAST NECK OF VEAL. The best end of the neck will make an excellent roast. A forcemeat may be inserted between the skin and the flesh, by first separating them with a sharp knife ; or the dish may be garnished with the forcemeat in balls. From an hour and three quarters to a couple of hours will roast it. Pour melted butter over when it is dished, and serve it like other joints. Let it be floured when first laid to the fire, kept constantly basted, and always at a sufficient distance to prevent its being scorched. 1 j to 2 hours. For the forcemeat, see No. 1, Chapter VI. From 8 to 10 minutes will fry the balls. NECK OF VEAL A la Creme ; or au Bechamel. Take the best end of a neck of white and well-fed veal, detach the flesh from the ends of the bones, cut them sufficiently short to give the joint a good square form; roll and skewer the skin over them, w7rap a buttered paper round the meat, lay it at a moderate distance from a clear fire, and keep it w’ell basted with butter for an hour and a quarter, then remove the paper and continue the basting with a pint, or more, of bechamel, or of rich white sauce, until the veal is sufficiently roasted, and well encrusted with it. Serve some bechamel under it in the dish, and send it very hot to table. For variety, give the bechamel, in making it, a high flavour of mushrooms, and add some small buttons, stewed very white and tender, to the portion reserved for saucing the joint. 2 to 2J hours.[CHAP. IX. MODERN COOKERY. 252 KNUCKLE OF VEAL. (En Ragout.) Cut in small thick slices the flesh of a knuckle of veal, season if .with a little fine salt and white pepper, flour it lightly, and fry it in butter to a pale brown, lay it into a very clean stewpan or saucepan, and just cover it with boiling water, skim it clean, and add to it a faggot of thyme and parsley, the white part of a head of celery, a small quantity of cayenne, and a blade or two of mace. Stew it very softly from an hour and three quarters, to two and a half. Thicken and enrich the gravy if needful with rice-flour and mushroom catsup or Harvey’s sauce, or with a large teaspoonful of flour, mixed with a slice of butter, a little good store- sauce and a glass of sherry or Madeira. Fried force- meat balls of No. 1, page 170, may be added at pleasure. With an additional quantity of water, or of broth (made with the bones of the joint), a pint and a half of young green peas stewed with the veal for an hour will give an agreeable variety of this dish. BOILED KNUCKLE OF VEAL. After the joint has been trimmed and well washed, put it into a vessel well adapted to it in size, for if it be very large, so much water will be required that the veal will be deprived of its flavour; it should be well covered with it, and very gently boiled until it is per- fectly tender in every part, but not so much done as to separate from the bone. Clear off the scum with scru- pulous care when the simmering first commences, and throw in a small portion of salt; as this, if sparingly used, will not redden the meat, and will otherwise much improve it. Parsley and butter is usually both poured over, and sent to table with a knuckle of veal, and boiled bacon also should accompany it. From the sinewy nature of this joint, it requires more than the usual time of cooking, a quarter of an hour to the pound not being sufficient for it.253 CHAP. IX.] VEAL. Knuckle of veal of 6 to 7 lbs. ; simmered gently from hours to 2^. SMALL PAIN DE VEAU ; OR, VEAL CAKE. Chop separately, and very fine, a pound and a quarter of veal quite free from fat and skin, and six ounces of beef kidney-suet; add a teaspoonful of salt, a full third as much of white pepper, and of mace or nutmeg, with the grated rind of half a lemon, and turn the whole well together with the chopping-knife till it is thoroughly mixed ; then press it smoothly into a small, round baking dish, and send it to a moderate oven for an hour and a quarter. Lift it into a clean, hot dish, and serve it plain, or with a little brown gravy in a tureen. Three ounces of the lean of a boiled ham minced small, will very much improve this cake, of which the size can be increased at will, and propor- tionate time allowed for dressing it. If baked in a hot oven, the meat will shrink to half its proper size, and be very dry. When done, it should be of a fine amber-colour, and like a cake in appearance. Veal, lj lb.; beef-suet, 6 ozs.; salt, 1 teaspoonful; pepper and mace, or nutmeg, f teaspoonful each ; rind of \ lemon; ham (when added), 3 ozs. : baked hour. BORDYKE VEAL CAKE. (|Good.) Take a pound and a half of veal perfectly clear of fat and skin, and eight ounces of the nicest striped bacon ; chop them separately, then mix them well together with the grated rind of a small lemon, half a teaspoonful of salt, a fourth as much of cayenne, the third part of a nutmeg, grated, and a half-teaspoonful of freshly pounded mace. When it is pressed into the dish, let it be somewhat higher in the centre than at the edge; and whether to be served hot or cold, lift it out as soon as it comes from the oven, and place it on a strainer that the fat may drain from it: it will keep many days254 MODERN COOKERY. ^CHAP. IX. if the under side be dry. The bacon should be weighed after the rind, and any rust it may exhibit, have been trimmed from it: that cured by the East Farleigh receipt, (see Chapter XI) is best for the purpose. This cake is excellent cold, better indeed than the preceding one; but if preferred hot, slices of either may be warmed through in a Dutch oven, or on the gridiron, or in a few spoonsful of gravy. The same ingredients made into small cakes, floured well, fried slowly from twelve to fifteen minutes, then served with gravy, made in the pan as for cutlets, will be found extremely good. Yeal, lg lb.; striped bacon,'18 ozs.: salt and mace, l teaspoonful each ; rind of lemon, 1 ; third of 1 nut- meg ; cayenne, 4 grains. FRICANDEAU OF VEAL. French cooks always prefer for this dish, which is a common one in their own country, that part of the fillet to which the fat or udder is attached ;* but the flesh of the finer part of the neck, or loin, raised clear from the bones, may be made to answer the purpose nearly, or quite as well, and often much more con- veniently, as the meat with us is not divided for sale as in France; and to purchase the entire fillet, for the sake of the fricandeau, would render it exceedingly expensive. Lay the veal flat upon a table, or dresser, with the skin uppermost, and endeavour, with one stroke of an exceedingly sharp knife to clear this off, and leave the surface of the meat extremely smooth ; next lard it thickly with small lardoons, as directed for a pheasant (page 200), and make one or two incisions in the underside with the point of a knife, that it may the better imbibe the flavour of the seasonings. Take a stewpan, of sufficient size to hold the fricandeau, and the proper quantity of vegetables compactly arranged, without much room being left round the meat. Put into it a couple of large carrots, cut in thick slices, two onions of moderate size, two or three roots of parsley, * Called by them the noix.CHAP. IX.] VEAL. 2 55 three bay-leaves, two small blades of mace, a branch or two of lemon-thyme, and a little cayenne, or a salt- spoonful of white pepper-corns. Raise these high in the centre of the stewpan, so as to support the meat, and prevent its touching the gravy. Cover them with slices of very fat bacon, and place the fricandeau gently on them; then pour in as much good veal-broth, or stock, as will nearly cover the vegetables without reaching to the veal. A calf’s foot, split in twTo, may with advan- tage be laid under them in the first instance. Stew the fricandeau very gently for upwards of three hours, or until it is found to be extremely tender when probed with a fine skewer or larding-pin. Plenty of live embers must then be put on the lid of the stew’pan for ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, to render the lardoons firm. Lift out the fricandeau, and keep it hot; strain and reduce the gravy very quickly, after having skimmed off every particle of fat; glaze the veal, and serve it on a ragout of sorrel, cucumbers, or spinach. This, though rather an elaborate receipt, is the best we can offer to the reader for a dish, which is now almost as fashionable with us as it is common on the Continent. Some English cooks have a very sum- mary method of preparing it; they merely lard and boil the veal till they can 44 cut it with a spoon,” then glaze and serve it with 44 brown gravy in the dish.” This may be very tolerable eating, but it will bear small resemblance to the French fricandeau. 31 to 4 hours. SPRING-STEW OF VEAL. Cut two pounds of veal, free from fat, into small half-inch thick cutlets; flour them well, and fry them in butter with two small cucumbers sliced, sprinkled with pepper, and floured, one moderate-sized lettuce, and twenty-four green gooseberries cut open lengthwise and seeded. When the whole is nicely browned lift it into a thick saucepan, and pour gradually into the pan half a pint, or rather more, ofMODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. IX 256 boiling water, brotli, or gravy. Add as much salt and pepper as it requires. Give it a minute’s simmer, and pour it over the meat, shaking it well round the pan as this is done. Let the veal stew gently from three quarters of an hour to an hour. A bunch of green onions cut small may be added to the other vegetables if approved ; and the veal will eat better if slightly seasoned with salt and pepper before it is floured; a portion of fat can be left on it if preferred. Yeal, 2Ibs. ; cucumbers, 2 ; lettuce, 1; green goose- berries, 24; water or broth, J pint or more; j to l hour. BREZOLLES. Cut from the loin or fillet, three pounds of veal, in the thinnest possible slices, and let them be free from fat and skin. Slice also, very thin, a pound of striped bacon, and trim away the rind. Mix thoroughly a dessert- spoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of pounded mace, as much of nutmeg, one and a half of white pepper, and the minced or grated rinds of two lemons, and with these season the veal equally; butter thickly a deep earthen pan, and lay the meat in smoothly in alternate layers, beginning with the bacon; press the whole closely down, put a round of buttered paper over it, tie on the cover of the pan, set it into a large saucepan of warm water, and let it simmer for two hours and a half from the time of its beginning to boil. If to be served hot, merely heap the meat upon a dish, skim the fat from the gravy, and pour it over; but if to be eaten cold, which it more usually is, put a plate with a weight upon it on the top of the brezolles, pour all the gravy from them, and leave them in the pan for four-and-twenty hours, when they will turn out in a solid mass or cake, and remain good many days if kept in a cool place: the gravy, strained, and reduced to jelly, may be placed round them as a garnish. The brezolles may, if more convenient, be baked in a gentle oven, but they will then require rather less time. In France, they are commonly stewed asVEAL. 257 CHAP. IX.] slowly as possible, and when half-done, a couple of glasses of white wine or of rich gravy are added to them ; minced herbs are also sometimes strewed be- tween the layers of meat. Yeal, 3 lbs.; bacon, 1 lb.; salt, 1 dessertspoonful; mace and nutmeg, 1 teaspoonful each ; pepper, 11 tea- spoonful ; rinds of lemons, 2 : simmered 2-1 hours. NORMAN HARRICO. Brown in a stewpan, or fry lightly, after having sprinkled them with pepper, salt and flour, from two to three pounds of veal cutlets. If taken from the neck, chop the bones very short, and trim away the greater part of the fat. .Arrange them as flat as they can be in a saucepan, give a pint of hot water a boil in the pan in which they have been browned, and pour it on them: add a small faggot of parsley, and, should the flavour be approved, one of green onions also. Let the meat simmer softly for half an hour; then cover it with small new potatoes which have had a single boil in water, give the saucepan a shake, and let the harrico stew very gently for another half hour, or until the potatoes are quite done, and the veal is tender. When the cutlets are thick and the potatoes approaching their full size, more time will be required for the meat, and the vege- tables may be at once divided; if extremely young they will not need the previous boil. Before the harrico is served, skim the fat from it, and add salt and pepper should it not be sufficiently seasoned. A few bits of lean ham, or shoulder of bacon browned with the veal, will much improve this dish, and for some tastes, a little acid will render it more agreeable. Yery delicate pork chops may be dressed in the same way. Yeal, 2 to 3 lbs.; water (or gravy), 1 pint; new potatoes, to 2 lbs.; faggot, parsley and green onions : 1 hour or more. VEAL CUTLETS. Take them, if possible, free from bone, and after • s[CHAP. IX. 258 MODERN COOKERY. having trimmed them into proper shape, heat them with a paste roller until the fibre of the meat is thoroughly- broken ; flour them well to prevent the escape of the gravy, and fry them from twelve to fifteen minutes over a fire that is not sufficiently fierce to burn them before they are quite cooked through : they should be of a fine amber brown, and perfectly done. Lift them into a hot dish, pour the fat from the pan, throw in a slice of fresh butter, and when it is melted, stir or dredge in a des- sertspoonful of flour; keep these shaken until they are well-coloured, then pour gradually to them a cup of gravy or boiling water ; add pepper, salt, a little lemon- pickle or juice, give the whole a boil, and pour it over the cutlets: a few forcemeat balls, fried, and served with them, is usually a very acceptable addition to this dish, even when it is garnished or accompanied with rashers of ham or bacon. A morsel of glaze, or of the jelly of roast meat, should, when at hand, be added to the sauce, which a little mushroom powder would fur- ther improve: mushroom sauce, indeed, is considered by many epicures, as indispensable with veal cutlets. We have recommended, in this one instance, that the meat should be thoroughly beaten, because we find that the veal is wonderfully improved by the process, which, however, we still deprecate for Other meats, unless in- deed we except pork chops. 12 to 15 minutes. VEAL CUTLETS A L*INDIENNE, OR INDIAN FASHION. Mix well together four ounces of very fine stale bread- crumbs, a teaspoonful of salt, and a tablespoonful of the best currie powder. Cut down into small well-shaped cutlets or collops, two pounds of veal free from fat, skin, or bone; beat the slices flat, and dip them into the seasoned crumbs; moisten them again with egg, and pass them a second time through the bread-crumbs. When all are ready, fry them in three or four ounces of but- ter over a moderate fire, from twelve to fourteen minutes. For sauce, mix smoothly with a knife, a teaspoonful ofCHAP. IX.] VEAL. 259 Hour and an equal quantity of currie-powder, with a small slice of butter; shake these in the pan for about five minutes, pour to them a cup of gravy or boiling water; add salt, cayenne, if required, and the strained juice of half a lemon; simmer the whole till well- fiavoured, and pour it round the cutlets. A better plan is, to have some good currie sauce ready prepared to send to table with this dish; which may likewise be served with only well-made common cutlet-gravy, from the pan, when much of the pungent flavour of the currie- powder is not desired. Bread-crumbs, 4 ozs. ; salt, 1 teaspoonful; currie- powder, 1 tablespoonful; veal, 2 lbs.: 12 to 14 minutes. Obs.—These cutlets may be broiled; they should then be well beaten first, and dipped into clarified butter, instead of egg, before they are passed through the curried seasoning. VEAL CUTLETS, OR COLLOPS. (A la Frangaise.) Cut the veal into small thin collops of equal size, arrange them evenly in a saute-pan, or in a small frying pan; dust a little fine salt and white pepper over them, and grate over a small portion of nutmeg, when it is liked; clarify an ounce or two of butter with a gentle heat, pour it over the veal, and set the pan aside until the dinner hour, then toss the cutlets over a clear fire till they are of a fine amber-colour, which will be in from three to four minutes : drain and dish them quickly. These are excellent, even without any gravy, but some may be made in the pan quickly, by throwing in a little of that which flows from roast meat, or a morsel of any other jellied gravy, or stock, with a squeeze of lemon, and a little cayenne. 3 to 4 minutes. VEAL CUTLETS, A LA MODE DE LONDRES; OR, LONDON FASHION. Raise the flesh entire from the upper side of the best260 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. IX* end of a neck of veal, free it from the skin, and from the greater portion of the fat, slice it equally into cutlets little more than a quarter of an inch thick, brush them with egg, strew them with fine bread-crumbs, and fry them of a light brown. Toast, or fry apart as many small slices of bacon as there are cutlets, and let them be trimmed nearly to the same shape; place them alternately on their edges round the inside of a hot dish (so as to form a sort of chain), and pour into the middle some rich gravy made in the pan, and very slightly flavoured with eschalot; or substitute for this some good brown mushroom sauce. Savoury herbs, grated, lemon-rind, nutmeg, or mace, salt, and white pepper or cayenne, should be mixed with the bread-crumbs, in the proportions directed at page 243, or they may be varied at pleasure. A cheek of bacon is best adapted to this dish. SWEETBREADS. {Simply dressed.') In whatever way sweetbreads are dressed, they should first be well soaked in lukewarm water, then thrown into boiling water to blanch them, as it is called, and to render them firm. If lifted out after they have boiled from five to ten minutes, according to their size, and laid immediately into fresh spring water to cool, their colour will be the better preserved. They may then be gently stewed for three quarters of an hour in veal gravy, which, with the usual additions of cream, lemon, and egg-yolks, may be converted into a fricassee sauce for them, when they are done; or they may be lifted from it, glazed, and served with good Spanish gravy; or, the glazing being omitted, they may be sauced with the sharp Maitre d’Hotel sauce of page 127. They may also be simply floured, and roasted in a Dutch oven, being often basted with butter, and frequently turned. A full sized sweetbread, after having been blanched, will require quite three quarters of an hour to dress it.261 CHAP. IX.] YEAL. SWEETBREAD CUTLETS. Boil the sweetbreads for half an hour in water, or veal-broth, and when they are perfectly cold, cut them into slices of equal thickness, brush them with yolks of egg, and dip them into very fine bread-crumbs, seasoned with salt, cayenne, grated lemon-rind, and mace; fry them in butter of a fine light brown, arrange them in a dish, placing them high in the centre, and pour under them a gravy made in the pan, thickened with mush- room powder, and flavoured with lemon-juice; or, in lieu of this, sauce them with some rich brown gravy, to which a glass of sherry or Madeira has been added* When it can be done conveniently, take as many slices of a cold boiled tongue, as there are sweetbread cutlets ; pare the rind from them, trim them into good shape, and dress them with the sweetbreads, after they have been egged and seasoned in the same way; place each cutlet upon a slice of tongue when they are dished. For variety, substitute croutons of fried bread, stamped out to the size of the cutlets, with a round or fluted paste or cake cutter. The crumb of a stale loaf, very evenly sliced, is best for the purpose. STEWED calf’s FEET. (Cheap and good.) This is an excellent family dish, highly nutritious and often very inexpensive, as the feet, during the summer, are usually sold at a low rate. Wash them with nicety, divide them at the joint, and split the claws; arrange them closely in a thick stewpan or saucepan, and pour in as much cold water as will cover them about half an inch : three pints will be sufficient for a couple of large feet. When broth or stock is at hand, it is good eco- nomy to substitute it for the water, as, by this means, a portion of strong and well-flavoured jellied gravy will be obtained for general use, the full quantity not being needed as sauce for the feet. The whole preparation will be much improved by laying a thick slice of the262 [CHAP. IX. MODERN COOKERY. lean of an unboiled ham, knuckle of bacon, hung beef, or the end of a dried tongue, at the bottom of the pan, before the other ingredients are added; or, when none of these are at hand, by supplying the defi- ciency with a few bits of stewing-beef or veal: the feet being of themselves insipid, will be much more palatable with one or the other of these additions. Throw in from half to three quarters of a teaspoonful of salt, when they begin to boil, and, after the scum has been all cleared off, add a few branches of parsley, a little celery, one small onion or more, stuck with half a dozen cloves, a carrot or two, a large blade of mace, and twenty corns of whole pepper; stew them softly until the flesh will part entirely from the bones ; take it from them ; strain part of the gravy, and skim off all the fat, flavour it with catsup, or any other store-sauce, and thicken it, when it boils, with arrow-root, or flour and butter; put in the flesh of the feet, and serve the dish as soon as the whole is very hot. A glass of wine, a little lemon-juice, and a few forcemeat balls will convert this into a very superior stew. A handful of mushroom-buttons sim- mered in it for half an hour before it is dished, will vary it agreeably. Calf’s feet (large), 2; water, 3 pints; salt, J to J teaspoonful; onions, 1 to 3 ; cloves, 6 ; peppercorns, 20 ; mace, large blade ; little celery and parsley; carrots, 1 or 2 : stewed softly, 2^ to 3^ hours.

To render the liver firm when dressed, lay it into a deep dish, and pour over it half a pint of vinegar; turn it often in this, arid let it lie for four and twenty hours, or longer even, if more convenient. Sliced onions, or eschalots, and branches of parsley, may be steeped with it in the vinegar, when their flavour is relished; but, in general, they would not, we think, be considered an improvement. Wash and wipe the liver very dry, slice263 VEAL. CHAP. IX.] it evenly, season it with pepper, salt, and savoury herbs shred extremely small, then flour and fry it in butter quickly, of a fine light brown; lift it out and keep it very hot, while a gravy is made for it in the pan. Pour out the fat, throw in a small slice of fresh butter, and when it boils, stir to it a half-teaspoonful of flour ; add a seasoning of pepper and salt; about a quarter-pint of boiling water, and a little lemon-juice, Chili vinegar, or lemon-pickle; shake the pan well round, give the whole a boil; sauce the liver with it, and send it to table with or without a garnish of curled bacon. TO ROAST calf’s LIVER. Take the whole or part of a fine white sound liver, and either lard it as a fricandeau upon the surface, or with large strips of highly-seasoned bacon in the in- side (see Larding, page 200); or should either of these modes be objected to, merely wrap it in a well-buttered paper, and roast it from an hour to an hour and a quarter, at a moderate distance from a clear fire, keep- ing if constantly basted. Remove the paper, and froth the liver well from ten to fifteen minutes before it is done. It should be served with a sauce of some piquancy, such as a poivrade, or brown eschalot, in addition to some good gravy. French cooks steep the liver over-night in vinegar, with a sliced onion and branches of savoury herbs laid over it; this whitens and renders it firm. As an economical mode, some small bits of the liver may be trimmed off, floured, and lightly fried with a sliced onion, and stewed down for gravy in three quarters of a pint of water which has been poured into the pan, with the addition of a few peppercorns, and a small bunch of herbs. A seasoning of salt must not be forgotten ; and a little lemon pickle, or juice, would generally be considered an improvement. t hour to 11. MINCED VEAL. When there is neither gravy nor broth at hand, the264 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. IX. bones and trimmings of the meat must be boiled down to furnish what is required for the mince. As cold meat is very light in weight, a pound of the white part of the veal will be sufficient for a dish, and for this quan- tity a pint of gravy will be needed. Break down the bones of the joint well, add the trimmings of the meat, a small bunch of savoury herbs, a slice or two of carrot or of celery, a blade of mace, a few white pepper-corns, and a bit or two of lean ham, boiled, or unboiled if it can be had, as either will improve the flavour of the mince. Pour to these a pint and a half of water, and stew them gently for a couple of hours; then strain off the gravy, let it cool and clear it entirely from the fat. Cut the white part of the veal small with a very sharp knife, after all the gristle and brown edges have been trim- med away. Some persons like a portion of fat minced with it, others object to the addition altogether. Thicken the gravy with a teaspoonful and a half of flour smoothly mixed with a small slice of butter, season the veal with a saltspoonful or more of salt, and half as much white pepper and grated nutmeg, or pounded mace; add the lightly-grated rind of half a small lemon ; mix the whole well, put it into the gravy, and heat it thoroughly by the side of the fire without allow- ing it to boil; serve it with pale-toasted sippets in and round the dish. A spoonful or two of cream is always an improvement to this mince. MINCED VEAL AND OYSTERS. The most elegant mode of preparing this dish is to mince about a pound of the whitest part of the inside of a cold roast fillet or loin of veal, to heat it without allowing it to boil, in a pint of rich white sauce, or bechamel, and to mix with it at the moment of serving three dozens of small oysters ready bearded, and plumped in their own strained liquor, which is also to be added to the mince; the requisite quantity of salt, cayenne, and mace should be sprinkled over the veal before it is put into the sauce. Garnish the dish with265 CHAP. IX.] VEAL. pale fried sippets of bread, or with fleurons* of brioche, or of puff-paste. Nearly half a pint of mushrooms minced, and stewed white in a little butter, may be mixed with the veal instead of the oysters ; or should they be very small they may be added to it whole : from ten to twelve minutes will be sufficient to make them tender. Balls of delicately fried oyster-forcemeat laid round the dish will give another good variety of it. Yeal minced, 1 lb.; white sauce, 1 pint; oysters, 3 dozens, with their liquor; or mushrooms, \ pint, stewed in butter 10 to 12 minutes. VEAL-SYDNEY. (GOOD.) Pour boiling on an ounce and a half of fine bread- crumbs nearly half a pint of good veal-stock or gravy, and let them stand till cool; mix with them then, two ounces of beef-suet shred very small, half a pound of cold roast veal carefully trimmed from the brown edges, skin, and fat, and finely minced ; the grated rind of half a lemon, nearly a teaspoonful of salt, a little cayenne, the third of a teaspoonful of mace or nutmeg, and four well-beaten eggs. Whisk up the whole well together, put it into a buttered dish, and bake it from three quarters of an hour to an hour. Cream may be used instead of gravy when more convenient, but this last will give the better flavour. A little clarified but- ter, put into the dish before the other ingredients are poured in, will be an improvement. Bread-crumbs, 1J oz. ; gravy or cream, nearly \ pint; beef-suet, 2 ozs.; cold veal, \ lb.; rind of -i lemon; salt, small teaspoonful; third as much mace and nutmeg; little cayenne; eggs, 4 large or 5 small: f to 1 hour. * Fleurons, flowers, or flower-like ; figures cut out with tin, shapes.266 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. X. CHAPTER X. MUTTON. TO CHOOSE MUTTON. The best mutton is small-boned, plump, finely-grained, and short-legged; the lean of a dark, rather than of a bright hue, and the fat white and clear : when this is yellow, the meat is rank, and of bad quality. Mutton is not considered by experienced judges to be in perfec- tion until it is nearly or quite five years old; but to avoid the additional expense of feeding the animal so long, it is commonly brought into the market at three years old. The leg and the loin are the superior joints ; and the preference would probably be given more frequently to the latter, but for the superabundance of its fat, which renders it not a very economical dish. The haunch consists of the leg and the part of the loin adjoining it; the saddle, of the two loins together, or of the undivided back of the sheep: these last are always roasted, and are served usually at good tables, or for company-dinners instead of the smaller joints.CHAP. X.] 267 MUTTON. The shoulder, dressed in the ordinary way, is not very highly esteemed, but when boned, rolled, and filled with forcemeat, it is of more presentable appearance, and to many tastes, far better eating; though some persons prefer it in its natural form, accompanied with stewed onions. It is occasionally boiled or stewed, and covered with rich onion-sauce. The neck is sometimes roasted, but it is more generally boiled ; the scrag, or that part of it which joins the head, is seldom used for any other purpose than making broth, and should be taken off before the joint is dressed. Cutlets from the thick end of the loin are commonly preferred to any others, but they are frequently taken likewise from the best end of the neck (sometimes called the back-ribs') and from the middle of the leg. Mutton kidneys are dressed in various ways, and are excellent in many. The trotters and the head of a sheep may be converted into very good dishes, but they are scarcely worth the trouble which is required to render them palatable. The loin and the leg are occasionally cured and smoked like hams or bacon. TO ROAST A HAUNCH OF MUTTON. This joint should be well-kept, and when the larder accommodations of a house are not good, the butcher should be requested to hang it the proper time. Roast it carefully at a large sound fire, and let it remain at a considerable distance for at least a couple of hours; then draw it nearer, but never sufficiently so to burn or injure the fat. Keep it constantly basted ; flour it soon after it is laid to the fire, instead of frothing it, as this latter mode is not generally relished, though fashion is in its favour. In from three and a half to four hours, the haunch will be done, and it will require something less of time when not kept back at first, as we have advised; but if roasted entirely on the plan mentioned at page 189, it will be much finer than in the usual way. Serve it with a good Espagnole, or with plain mutton-gravy and currant-jelly. This joint,268 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. X. when the meat is of very fine quality, may be dressed and served exactly like venison. 3 j to 4 hours. 5 hours or more by the slow method. ROAST SADDLE OF MUTTON. This is an excellent joint, though not considered a very economical one. It is usual for the butcher to raise the skin from it before it is sent in, and to skewer it on again, that in the roasting the juices of the meat may be better preserved, and the fat prevented from taking too much colour, as this should be only slightly browned. In something less than half an hour before the mutton is done, remove the skin, and flour the joint lightly after having basted it well. Our own great objection to frothed meat would lead us to recommend that the skin should be taken off half an hour earlier, and that the joint should be kept at sufficient distance from the fire to prevent the possibility of the fat being burned ; and that something more of time should be allowed for the roasting. With constant basting, great care, and good management, the cook may always ensure the proper appearance of this, or of any other joint (except, perhaps, of a haunch of venison) without having recourse to papering or pasting, or even to replacing the skin ; but when unremitted attention cannot be given to this one part of the dinner, it is advisable to take all precautions that can secure it from being spoiled. 2J hours to 2j. More if very large. TO ROAST A LEG OF MUTTON. In a cool and airy larder a leg of mutton will hang many days with advantage, if the kernel be taken out, and the flap wiped very dry when it is first brought in ; and it is never tender when freshly killed: in warm weather it should be well dredged with pepper to pre- serve it from the flies. If washed before it is put upon the spit, it should be wiped as dry as possible after- wards, and well floured soon after it is laid to the fire. When the excellence of the joint is more regarded than the expense of fuel, it should be roasted by what weMUTTON. CHAP. X.] 269 have denominated the sloio method; that is to say, it should be kept at a considerable distance from the fire, and remain at it four hours instead of two, it may be drawn nearer for the last twenty or thirty minutes to give it colour. The gravy will flow from it in great abundance when it is cut, and the meat will be very superior to that roasted in the usual way. When this plan is not pursued the mutton should still be kept quite a foot from the fire until it is heated through, and never brought sufficiently near to scorch or to harden any part. It should be constantly hasted with its own fat, for if this be neglected all other precau- tions will fail to ensure a good roast; and after it is dished a little fine salt should be sprinkled lightly on it, and a spoonful or two of boiling water laded over. This is the most palatable mode of serving it, but it may be frothed when it is preferred so, though we would rather recommend that the flour should be dredged on in the first instance, as it then prevents the juices of the meat from escaping, and forms a savoury coating to it ; while the raw taste which it so often retains with mere frothing is to many eaters especially objectionable. Leg of mutton, 7 to 8 lbs.; slow method 4 hours, common method 1 hour and f to 2 hours. SUPERIOR RECEIPT FOE ROAST LEG OF MUTTON. Cover the joint well with cold water, bring it gradually to boil, and let it simmer gently for half an hour; then lift it out, put it immediately on to the spit, and roast it from an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half, according to its weight. This mode of dressing the joint renders it remarkably juicy and tender; but there must be no delay in putting it on the spit after it is lifted from the water. A mild ragout of garlic (see page 145,) may be served in the dish with it, or it may be garnished with roast tomatas. Boiled, \ hour; roast 1 hour and J to 1 andMODERN COOKERY. 270 [CHAP. X. BRAISED LEG OF MUTTON. Take out the bone as far as the first joint (by the di- rections of the following receipt), roll some large strips of bacon in a seasoning of mixed spice, and of sa voury herbs minced extremely fine, or dried and reduced to powder, and with these lard the inside of the boned portion of the joint; or fill the cavity with forcemeat highly seasoned with eschalot or garlic.. Sew up the meat, and place it in a braising-pan, or ham-kettle nearly of its size, with slices of bacon under and over it, two or three onions, four or five carrots, two bay-leaves, a large bunch of savoury herbs, a few bones, or bits of undressed mutton or veal, and about three quarters of a pint of gravy. Stew the meat as softly as possible from four to five hours, and keep live embers on the top of the pan (or, as this mode of cooking is not general in England, set the mutton, if it can be done conveniently, into a moderately-heated oven, after having luted the edges of the vessel in which it is arranged with a bit of coarse paste); lift it out, strain the gravy, reduce it quickly to glaze, and brush the meat with it; or merely strain, free it from fat, and pour it over the mutton. White beans {haricots blancs), boiled tender and well drained, or a mild ragout of garlic or eschalots, may he laid in the dish under it. The joint can be braised equally well without any part of it beino; boned. 4 to 5 hours. LEG OF MUTTON BONED AND FORCED. Turn the underside of the mutton upwards, and with a sharp knife cut through the middle of the' skin from the knuckle to the first joint, and raise it from the flesh on the side along which the bone runs, until the knife is just above it, then cut through the flesh down to the bone; work the knife round it in every part till you reach the socket; next remove the flat bone from the large end of the joint, and pass the knife freely round the remaining one, as it is not needful to take it outCHAP. X.] 271 MUTTON. clear of the meat; when you again reach the middle joint, loosen the skin round it with great care, and the two bones can then be drawn out without being divided. This being done, fill the cavities with forcemeat, No. 1., (page 170), adding to it a somewhat high seasoning of eschalot, garlic, or onion; or cut out with the bone, nearly a pound of the inside of the mutton, chop it fine with six ounces of delicate striped bacon, and mix with it thoroughly three quarters of an ounce of parsley, and half as much of thyme and winter-savory, all minced extremely small; a half-teaspoonful of pepper (or a third as much of cayenne) ; the same of mace, salt, and nutmeg, and either the grated rind of a small lemon, or four eschalots finely shred. When the lower part of the leg is filled, sew the skin neatly together where it has been cut open, and tie the knuckle round tightly, to prevent the escape of the gravy. Replace the flat bone at the large end, and with a long needle and twine, draw the edges of the meat together over it. If it can be done conveniently, it is better to roast the mutton thus prepared in a cradle-spit or upon a hanging or bottle-jack, with the knuckle downwards. Place it at first far from the fire, and keep it constantly basted. It will require nearly or quite three hours roasting. Re- move the twine before it is served, and send it very hot to table with some rich brown gravy. MOCK VENISON. Hang a plump and finely-grained leg of mutton in a cool place, for as many days as it can possibly be kept without becoming altogether uneatable. Lay it on a dish, pour over, and rub well into it, about half a small cupful of pyroligneous acid, and let it remain ten mi- nutes. Wash it very thoroughly, cut off the knuckle, and trim away the flap, and any part that may continue very offensive, or take a few inches from either end of the joint; then lay it into a close-shutting stewpot, or thick iron saucepan of its own size, with no other liquid than the drops of water which adhere to it, and simmer it over272 [CHAP. X. MODERN COOKERY. a very slow fire from four and a half to five-hours, turning it several times, that it may be equally done. Give it no seasoning beyond pepper and salt. Should the gravy be too much reduced, add two spoonsful of boiling water, or of mutton-gravy. Send the meat to table in its own juices, with currant-jelly, or sharp venison- sauce apart. We owe this receipt entirely to accident; for, wishing to have proof of the anti-putrescent qualities of the pyroligneous acid, we had it applied to a leg of mutton which had been too long kept, and which was dressed in the way we have described. When brought to table, its resemblance to venison, both in appearance and flavour, was remarkable ; and several persons partook of it hashed on the following day, and were all perfectly unconscious that they were not really eating venison ; in the latter instance, it was served in rich gravy made in part of hare; a glass of port wine, a little compound catsup, and a thickening of rice-flour were added. The meat, of course, was only heated through, and not allowed to boil. On a second trial we found it an improvement to touch the mutton in every part with a feather dipped in the acid, as soon as it gave evidence of having been suffi- ciently kept, and then to let it hang three or four days longer : it was again washed with the acid, and after- wards with cold water before it was dressed. TO BOIL A LEG OP MUTTON. {An excellent Receipt.) Trim into handsome form a well-kept, but perfectly sweet leg of mutton, of middling weight; wash, but do not soak it; lay it into a vessel as nearly of its size as con- venient, and pour in rather more than sufficient cold water to cover it; set it over a good fire, and when it begins to boil, take off the scum, and continue to do so until no more appears; throw in a tablespoonful of salt, (after the first skimming,), which will assist to bring it to the surface, and as soon as the liquor is clear, add two moderate-sized onions, stuck with a dozen cloves, a large faggot of parsley, thyme, and savoury, and four or fiveCHAP. X.] 273 MUTTON. large carrots^ and half an hour afterwards, as many turnips. Draw the pan to the side of the fire, and let the mutton be simmered gently from two hours to two and a half, from the time of its first beginning to boil. Serve it with caper, brown cucumber, or oyster- sauce. If stewed softly, as we have directed, the mutton will he found excellent dressed thus ; otherwise, it will but resemble the unpalatable and ragged-looking joints of fast-boiled meat, so constantly sent to table by common English cooks. Any undressed hones of veal, mutton, or beef, boiled with the joint, will improve it much, and the liquor will then make excellent soup, or bouillon. 2 to 2J hours. COLD ROAST LEG OF MUTTON. When only a few slices have been cut from the middle of the joint, it will still afford a fillet of tolerable size, which, dressed in the following manner, will make a dish of better appearance and savour than a common hash or mince. Take off as much of the large end of the leg, quite through, as will render that side of the fillet perfectly flat; cut also evenly through the joint, where it has been carved, then remove the bone from the fillet, and replace it with veal forcemeat (No. 1, page 170), put the meat, with the bones, knuckle, and trimmings, into a stewpot, or stout saucepan adapted to its size, and just cover it with water, or with broth in prefer- ence, when any stock is at hand; as soon as it boils, add a couple of onions, a bunch of parsley, two or even three bay-leaves, four or five carrots, and as many turnips {plenty of vegetables, in fact), and simmer the whole gently for nearly, or quite a couple of hours. Thickening, spice, or store-sauce, can be added to the gravy at will, before the meat is served, which it should be with the vegetables round it. Af FILLET OF MUTTON. Cut some inches from either end of a large and w^ell- kept leg of mutton, and leave the fillet shaped like one T[CHAP. X. 274 MODERN COOKERY. of veal. Remove the bone, and fill the cavity with forcemeat (No. 1, page 170), which may be flavoured with a little minced eschalot, if approved ; more force- meat may be added by detaching the skin sufficiently on the flap side to admit it. When thus prepared, the fillet may be floured, and roasted, served with currant- jelly and brown gravy, or with only melted butter poured over it; or it may be stewed gently for nearly or quite four hours, in a pint of gravy or water, after being floured and browned all over in a couple of ounces of butter; it must then be turned every hour that it may be equally done. T wo or three small onions, a faggot of herbs, a couple of carrots sliced, four or five cloves, and twenty whole pepper-corns can be added at will. Roasted 2 hours, or stewed 4 hours. TO ROAST A LOIN OF MUTTON. The flesh of the loin of mutton is superior to that of the leg, when roasted; but to the frugal housekeeper, this consideration is usually overbalanced by the great weight of fat attached to it; this, however, when economy is more considered than appearance, may be pared off, and melted down for various kitchen-uses, or finely chopped, and substituted for suet in making hot pie, or pudding crust. When thus reduced in size, the mutton will be soon roasted. If it is to be dressed in the usual way, the butcher should be desired to take off the skin; care should be taken to preserve the fat from being ever so slightly burned; it should be managed, indeed, in the same manner as the saddle, in every respect, and carved also in the same way, that is to say, the meat should be cut out in slices the whole length of the back-bone, and close to it. Without the fat, 1 to l\ hour ; with, 1J to 1 j hours. TO DRESS A LOIN OF MUTTON LIKE YENISON.

Make some gravy of the bones, and add it at intervals to the mutton when required. This receipt comes to us so strongly recommended by persons who have partaken frequently of the dish, that we have not thought it needful to prove it our- selves. \ 3 hours. TO ROAST A SHOULDER OF MUTTON. Flour it well, and baste it constantly with its own dripping; do not place it close enough to the fire for the fat to be in the slightest degree burned, or even too deeply browned. An hour and a half will roast it, if it be of moderate size. Stewed onions are often sent to table with it. A shoulder of mutton is sometimes boiled, and smothered with onion sauce. 1 hour and j. SPICED SHOULDER OF MUTTON. Bone the joint, and rub it, if large, with four ounces of the coarsest sugar (or with three, if it be small), well mixed with a dessertspoonful of pounded cloves, half that quantity of pepper and of mace, and a fourth part as much of ginger: the following day add four ounces of salt. Keep the mutton turned, and rubbed occasionally with the pickle from eight to ten days; then roll it up tight, bind it with a fillet, and stew it gently for four hours in a pint and a half of beef-broth, or put into the stewpan with it a pound and a half of neck , of beef, three half pints of water, one large mild onion, two carrots, two turnips, and a large faggot of herbs. When the mutton is perfectly tender, serve it with some of its own gravy, thickened and highly-flavoured with lemon- pickle, or any other acid sauce; or send it to table with a good sauce piquante.

Cut off all the flesh from the inside of the joint down to the blade-bone, and reserve it for a separate dish. It may be lightly browned with some turnips or carrots, or both, and made into a small harrico, or stewed simply in its own gravy, or it will make in part, a pudding or a pie. Bone the mutton (see page 250), flatten it on a table, lay over the inside some thin and neatly-trimmed slices of striped bacon, and spread over them some good veal forcemeat (No. 1, page 170), to within an inch of the outer edge; roll the joint up tightly towards the knuckle (of which the bone may be left in or not, at pleasure), secure it well with tape or twine, and stew it gently in good gravy, from four hours to four and a half. 4 to 4J hours. Obs.—In France it is usual to substitute sausage- meat for the bacon and veal-stuffing in this dish. MUTTON CUTLETS STEWED IN THEIR OWN GRAVY. (Good.) Trim the fat entirely from some cutlets taken from the loin ; just dip them into cold water, dredge them with pepper, and then on both sides with flour; rince a thick iron saucepan with spring water, and leave in it about a tablespoonful; arrange the cutlets in one flat layer, if it can be done conveniently, and place them over a very gentle fire; throw in a little salt when they begin to stew, and let them simmer as softly as possible, but without ceasing, from an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half. If dressed with great care, which they require, they will be equally tender, easy of digestion, and nutritious ; and being at the same time free from everything which can disagree with the most delicateMUTTON. CHAP. X.] 277 stomach, the receipt will be found a valuable one for invalids. The mutton should be of good quality, but the excellence of the dish depends mainly on its being most gently stewed; for if allowed to boil quickly, all the gravy will be dried up, and the meat will be unfit for table. The cutlets must be turned when they are half done: a eouple of spoonsful of water or gravy may be added to them should they not yield sufficient moisture, but this is rarely needful. TO BROIL MUTTON CUTLETS. These may be taken from the loin, or the best end of the neck, but the former are generally preferred. Trim off a portion of the fat, or the whole of it, unless it be liked; pepper the cutlets, heat the gridiron, rub it with a bit of the mutton suet, broil them over a brisk fire, and turn them often till they.are done: this, for the generality of eaters, will be in about eight minutes if they are not more than half an inch thick, which they should not be. French cooks season them with pepper and salt, and give them a light coating of dissolved butter or of oil, before they are laid to the fire, and we have found the cutlets so managed extremely good. Lightly broiled, 7 to 8 minutes. Well done, 10 minutes. Obs.—A cold Maitre d’Hotel sauce may be laid under the cutlets when they are dished; or they may be served quite dry, or with brown gravy; or when none is at hand, with good melted butter seasoned with mushroom catsup, cayenne, and Chili vinegar or lemon juice. CHINA CHILO.

One or even two half-grown cucumbers, cut small by scoring the ends deeply as they are sliced, or a quarter-pint of minced mushrooms may be added with good effect; or a des- sertspoonful of currie-powder and a large chopped onion. A dish of boiled rice should be sent to table with it.

Put into a broad stewpan or saucepan, a flat layer of mutton chops, freed entirely from fat and from the greater portion of the bone, then, just dipped into cold water, seasoned with pepper, and lightly dredged with flour; on these put a layer of mild turnips sliced half an inch thick, and divided into squares; then some carrots of the same thickness, with a seasoning of salt and black pepper between them ; next, another layer of chops, then plenty of vegetables, and as much weak broth or cold water as will barely cover the whole; bring them slowly to a boil, and let them just simmer from two to three hours, according to the quantity. One or two minced onions may be strewed between the other vegetables when their flavour is liked. The savour of the dish will be increased by browning the chops in a little butter before they are stewed, and still more so by frying the vegetables lightly as well, before they are added to it. A head or two of celery would to many tastes improve the flavour of the whole. In summer, cucumber, green onions, shred lettuces, and green peas may be substituted for the winter vegetables. Mutton, free from fat, 2| lbs.; turnips, 3 lbs.; car- rots, 3 lbs.; celery, (if added), 2 small heads.CHAP. X.] MUTTON. 279 Obs. The fat and trimmings of the mutton used for this and other dishes into which only the lean is admis- sible, may be turned to advantage by cutting the whole up rather small, and then boiling it in a quart of water to the pound, with a little spice, a bunch of herbs and some salt, until the fat is nearly dissolved: the liquid will then, if strained off and left till cold, make tolerable broth, and the cake of fat which is on the top, if again just melted and poured free of sediment into small pans, will serve excellently for common pies and for frying kitchen dinners. Less water will of course produce broth of better quality, and the addition of a small quantity of fresh meat or bones will render it very good. AN IRISH STEW. Take a couple of pounds of small thick mutton cutlets with or without fat according to the taste of the persons to whom the stew is to be served; take also four pounds of good potatoes, weighed after they are pared, slice them thick, and put a portion of them in a flat layer, into a large thick saucepan or stewpan ; season the mut- ton well with pepper, and place some of it on the pota- toes, cover it with another layer, and proceed in the same manner with all, reserving plenty of the vegetable for the top; pour in three quarters of a pint of cold water, and add, when the stew begins to boil, an ounce of salt; let it simmer gently for two hours, and serve it very hot. When the addition of onion is liked, strew in two or three minced ones with the potatoes. Mutton cutlets, 2 lbs.; potatoes, 4 lbs.; pepper, \ oz. ; salt, 1 oz.; water, f pint: 2 hours. Obs.—For a real Irish stew the potatoes should be boiled to a mash: an additional quarter-hour may be necessary for the full quantity here, but for half of it two hours are quite sufficient.

This is a very good mode of serving a half roasted loin or neck. When the cutlets are broiled they should be dipped into, or sprinkled thickly with butter just dissolved, or they will be exceedingly dry; a few additional crumbs should be made to adhere to them after they are moistened with this. MUTTON KIDNEYS A LA FRANQAISE. Skin six or eight fine fresh mutton kidneys, and with- out opening them, remove the fat; slice them rather thin, strew over them a dessertspoonful of minced herbs, of which two-thirds should be parsley and the remainder thyme, with a tolerable seasoning of pepper or cayenne, and some fine salt. Melt two ounces of butter in a frying pan, put in the kidneys and brown them quickly on both sides; when nearly done, stir amongst them a dessertspoonful of flour and shake them well in the pan ; pour in the third of a pint of gravy (or hot water in default of this), the juice of half a lemon, and as much of Harvey’s sauce, or of mushroom catsup, as will flavour the whole pleasantly ; bring these to the point of boiling, and pour them into a dish garnished with fried sippets, or lift out the kidneys first, give the sauce a boil and pour it on them. We generally have the store-sauce of page 213* used to flavour this dish in preference to simple catsup. In France, a couple of glasses of champagne, or, for variety, of claret, are frequently added to the gravy; one of port wine can be substituted for either of these. A dessertspoonful of minced eschalots may be strewed over the kidneys with the herbs; or two dozens of very small ones, pre- viously stewed till tender in fresh butter over a gentle * See English stew.LAMB.

This should be laid to a clear brisk fire, and carefully and plentifully basted from the time of its becoming warm until it is ready for table ; but though it requires quick roasting, it must never be placed sufficiently near the fire to endanger the fat, which is very liable to catch or burn. When the joint is served, the shoulder should be separated from the ribs with a sharp knife, and a small slice of fresh butter, a little cayenne, and a squeeze of lemon juice put between them; if the cook be an expert carver, this had better be done before the lamb is sent to table. The cold Maitre d’Hotel sauce of Chapter IV. may be substituted for the usual ingredi- ents, the parsley being omitted or not, according to the taste. Serve good mint sauce, and a fresh salad with this roast. A leg, shoulder, or loin of lamb should be cooked by the same directions as the quarter, a difference only being made in the time allowed for each. Fore quarter of lamb, 1 j to 2 hours. Leg, l\ hour (less if very small); loin, 1 hour to lj. Obs.—The time will vary a little, of course, from the difference of weather, and in the strength of the fire. Lamb should always be well roasted. SADDLE OF LAMB. This is an exceedingly nice joint for a small party. It should be roasted at a brisk fire, and kept constantly basted with its own dripping: it will require from an hour and three quarters to two hours roasting. Send it to table with mint sauce, and if convenient, with brown cucumber-sauce also, and a salad. If: to 2 hours. Obs.—The following will be found an excellent receipt for mint-sauce :—With three heaped tablespoonsful of finely-chopped young mint, mix two of pounded and[[chap.

Place it at a moderate distance from a clear fire, baste it frequently, froth it when nearly done, and serve it with the same sauces as the preceding joints. A loin of lamb may be boiled and sent to table with white cucumber, mushroom, common white sauce, or parsley and butter. 1 hour to 15. STEWED LEG OF LAMB WITH WHITE SAUCE. Choose a small plump leg of lamb, not much ex- ceeding five pounds in weight; put it into a vessel nearly of its size, with a few trimmings, or a bone or two of undressed veal if at hand ; cover it with cold water, bring it slowly to a boil, clear off the scum with great care when it is first thrown to the surface, and when it has all been skimmed off, add a bunch of thyme and parsley, and two carrots of moderate size. Let the lamb simmer only, but without ceasing, for an hour and a quarter; serve it covered with bechamel, or rich English white sauce, send a boiled tongue to table with it, and some of the sauce in a tureen. 1 hour and J. LOIN OF LAMB STEWED IN BUTTER. Wash the joint, and wipe it very dry ; skew^er down the flap, and lay it into a close-shutting and thick stewpan, or saucepan, in which three ounces of good butter have been just dissolved, but not allowed to boil; let it simmer slowly over a very gentle fire for two hours and a quarter, and turn it when it is rather more than half done. Lift it out, skim and pour the gravy over it; send brown asparagus, cucumber, or soubise sauce to table with it; or brown gravy, mint sauce, and a salad. 2 hours andLAMB. 283 CHAP. X.] LAMB OR MUTTON-CUTLETS, WITH SOUBISE SAUCE. The best end of two necks of either will be required for a handsome dish. Cut them thin with one bone to each ; trim off the fat and all the skin, scrape the bones very clean that they may look white, and season the cutlets with salt and white pepper ; brush them with eggs, dip them into very fine bread-crumbs, then into clarified butter, and again into the bread-crumbs, which should be flattened evenly upon them, and broil them over a very clear and brisk fire, or fry them in a little good butter of a fine clear brown ; press them in two sheets of white blotting-paper to extract the grease, and dish them an end, with the points meeting at the top; or place them one over the other in a chain, and pour into the centre a soubise, or a puree of cucumbers. Brown cucumber sauce, or a rich gravy may be sub- stituted for either of these in serving a quite simple dinner. Cutlets of the loin may be dressed in the same way, after being dipped into crumbs of bread mixed with a full seasoning of minced herbs, and a small quan- tity of eschalot, when its flavour is liked. The small flat bone at the end of the cutlets should be taken off, to give them a very good appearance. LAMB CUTLETS IN THEIR OWN GRAVY. Follow exactly the receipt for mutton cutlets dressed in the same wTay, but allow fifteen or twenty minutes less of time, and an additional spoonful of liquid.284 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XI. CHAPTER XI. PORK. TO CHOOSE PORK. This meat is so proverbially, and we believe, even dangerously unwholesome when ill-fed, or in any de- gree diseased, that its quality should be closely ex- amined before it is purchased. When not home- fatted, it should be bought if possible of some re- spectable farmer, or miller, unless the butcher who supplies it can be perfectly relied on. Both the fat and lean should be very white, and the latter finely- grained ; the rind should be thin, smooth, and cool to the touch ; if it be clammy, the pork is stale, and should be at once rejected; it ought also to be scrupulously avoided when the fat, instead of being quite clear of all blemish, is full of small kernels, which are indica- tive of disease. The manner of cutting up the pork varies in different counties, and also according to the purposes for which it is intended. The legs are either made into hams, or slightly salted for a few days and boiled ; they are also sometimes roasted when the pork is not large nor coarse, with a savoury forcemeat in- serted between the skin and flesh of the knuckle. The285 PORK. CHAP. XI.] part of the shoulder called the hand, is also occa- sionally pickled in the same way as hams and bacon, or it may be salted and boiled, but it is too sinewy for roasting. After these and the head have been taken off, the remainder, without further division than being split down the back, may be converted into whole sides, or flitches, as they are usually called, of bacon ; but when the meat is large, and required in part for various other purposes, a chine may be taken out, and the fat pared off the bones of the ribs and loins for bacon ; the thin part of the body converted into pickled pork, and the ribs and other bones roasted, or made into pies or sausages. The feet, which are generally salted down for ready use, are excellent if laid for two or three weeks into the same pickle as the hams, then well covered with cold water, and slowly boiled till tender. The loins of young and delicate pork are roasted with the skin on ; and this is scored in regular strips of about a quarter-inch wide, with the point of a sharp knife, before the joints are laid to the fire. The skin of the leg also is just cut through in the same manner. This is done to prevent its blistering, and to render it more easy to carve, as the skin (or crackling) becomes so crisp and hard in the cooking, that it is otherwise sometimes difficult to divide it. To be at any time fit for table, pork must be 'perfectly sweet, and thoroughly cooked; great attention also should be given to it when it is in pickle, for if any part of it be long exposed to the air, without being turned into, or well and frequently basted with the brine, it will often become tainted during the process of curing it. TO MELT LARD. Strip the skin from the inside fat of a freshly killed and well-fed pig; slice it small and thin ; put it into a new or well scalded jar, set it into a pan of boiling water, and let it simmer over a clear fire. As it[CHAP. XI. MODERN COOKERY. 286 dissolves, strain it into small stone jars, or deep earthen pans, and when perfectly cold, tie over it the skin that was cleared from the lard, or bladders that have been thoroughly washed and wiped very dry. Lard thus prepared is extremely pure in flavour, and keeps per- fectly well, if stored in a cool place; it may be used with advantage in making pastry, as well as for frying fish, and various other purposes. It is better to keep the last drainings of the fat apart from that which is first poured off, as it will not be quite so fine in quality. TO PRESERVE UNMELTED LARD FOR MANY MONTHS. For the particular uses to which the leaf-fat, or fleed, can be advantageously applied, see fleed-crust, Chapter XYI. It may be kept well during the summer months by rubbing fine salt rather plentifully upon it when it is first taken from the pig, and leaving it for a couple of days; it should then be well drained, and covered with a strong brine: this, in warmer weather, should be changed occasionally. When wanted for use, lay it into cold water for two or three hours, then wipe it dry, and it will have quite the effect of the fresh leaf when made into paste. Inner fat of pig, 6 lbs.; fine salt, J to j lb : 2 days. Brine; to each quart of water, 6 ozs. salt. TO ROAST A SUCKING PIG. After the pig has been scalded and prepared for the spit, wipe it as dry as possible, and put into the body about half a pint of fine bread-crumbs, mixed with three heaped teaspoonsful of sage, minced very small, three ounces of good butter, a large saltspoonful of salt, two-thirds as much of pepper, or some cayenne. Sew it up with soft, but strongPORK. 287 CHAP. XI.] cotton, truss it as a bare, with the fore legs skewered back, and the hind ones forward; lay it to a strong, clear fire, but keep it at a moderate distance, as it would quickly blister or scorch, if placed too near. So soon as it has become warm, rub it with a bit of butter, tied in a fold of muslin, or of thin cloth, and repeat this process constantly while it is roasting. When the gravy begins to drop from it, put basins, or small deep tureens under, to catch it in. As soon as the pig is of a fine light amber-brown, and the steam draws strongly towards the fire, wipe it quite dry with a clean cloth, and rub a bit of cold butter over it. When it is half done, a pig iron, or in lieu of this, a large flat iron should be hung in the centre of the grate, or the middle of the pig will be done long before the ends. When it is ready for table, lay it into a very hot dish, and before the spit is withdrawn, take off and open the head, and split the body in two; chop together quickly the stuffing and the brains, put them inio half a pint of good veal gravy, ready thickened, add a glass of Madeira or sherry, and the gravy that has dropped from the pig; pour a small portion of this under the meat, and serve the remainder as hot as possible in a tureen; a small quantity of pounded mace and cayenne, with a squeeze of lemon-juice, may be added, should the flavour require heightening. Fine bread-sauce, and a little plain gravy should likewise be served with it. Some persons still prefer the old fashioned currant sauce to any other ; and many have the brains and stuffing stirred into rich melted butter, instead of gravy; but the receipt which we have given has usually been so much approved, that we can recommend it with some confidence, as it stands. Modern taste would perhaps be rather in favour of rich brown gravy and thick tomata sauce, or sauce Poivrade. In dishing the pig, lay the body flat in the middle, and the head and ears at the ends and sides. When very pure oil can be obtained, it is preferable to butter for the basting: it should be laid on with a bunch of288 MODERN COOKERY. QcHAP. XI. feathers. A suckling of three weeks old is considered as best suited to the spit; and it should always be dressed, if possible, the day it is killed. lj to If hours. BAKED PIG. Prepare the pig exactly as for roasting, truss, and place it in the dish in which it is to be sent to the oven, and anoint it thickly in every part with white of egg that has been slightly beaten: it will require no basting, nor further attention of any kind, and will be well crisped by this process. PIG A LA TARTARE. When the shoulders of a cold roast pig are left entire, take them off with care, remove the skin, trim them into good form, dip them into clarified butter or very pure salad oil, then into fine crumbs highly seasoned with cayenne and mixed with about a half-teaspoonful of salt. Broil them over a clear brisk fire, and send them quickly to table as soon as they are equally browned, with tomata sauce, or sauce Robert. Curried crumbs, and a currie-sauce will give an excellent variety of this dish; and savoury herbs, with two or three eschalots chopped small together and mixed with the bread-crumbs, and brown eschalot sauce to accompany the broil, will like- wise be an acceptable one to many tastes. SUCKING PIG EN BLANQUETTE. Raise the flesh from the bones of a cold roast pig, free it from the crisp outer skin or crackling, and cut it down into small handsome slices. Dissolve a bit of butter the size of an egg, and, if they can be easily procured, throw in a handful of button-mushrooms, cleaned, and sliced ; shake these over the fire for three or four minutes, then stir to them a dessertspoonful of flour, and continue to shake or toss them gently, but do not allow them to brown. Add a small bunch of parsley, a bay-leaf, a middling sized blade of mace, some salt, a small quantity289 CHAP. XI.] PORK. of cayenne or white pepper, half a pint of good veal or beef broth, and from two to three glasses of light white wine. Let these boil gently until reduced nearly one- third ; take out the parsley and mace, lay in the meat, and bring it slowly to the point of simmering; stir to it the beaten yolks of three fresh eggs, and the strained juice of half a lemon. Serve the blanquette very hot. TO ROAST PORK. When the skin is left on the joint which is to be roasted, it must be scored in narrow strips of equal width, before it is put to the fire, and laid at a consider- able distance from it at first, that the meat may be heated through before the skin hardens or begins to brown; it must never stand still for an instant, and the basting should be constant. Pork is not at the present day much served at very good tables, particularly in this form; and it is so still less with the old savoury stuffing of sage and onions, though some eaters like it always with the leg : when it is ordered for this joint, therefore, prepare it as directed for a goose, Chapter VI., and after having loosened the skin from the knuckle, insert as much as well can be secured in it. A little clarified butter, or salad oil may be brushed over the skin quite at first, particularly should the meat not be very fat, but unless remarkably lean it will speedily yield sufficient dripping to baste it with. Joints from which the fat has been pared, will require of course far less roasting than those on which the crackling is retained. Brown gravy and apple or tomata sauce, are the usual accom- paniments to all roasts of pork, except a sucking pig: they should always be thoroughly cooked. Leg of pork of 8 lbs., 3 hours; loin of from 5 to 6 lbs., with the skin on, 2 to 2J hours; spare-rib of 6 to 7 lbs., 1J hour. TO ROAST A SADDLE OF PORK. The skin of this joint may be removed entirely, but if left on it must be scored lengthwise, or in the direction in u290 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XI. which it will be carved. The pork should be young of line quality, and of moderate size. Roast it very carefully, either by the directions given in the preceding receipt, or when the skin is taken off, by those for a saddle of mutton, allowing in the latter case from three-quarters of an hour to a full hour more of the lire for it, in pro- portion to its weight. Serve it with good brown gravy and tomata sauce,, or sauce Robert; or with apple sauce, should it be preferred. 20 minutes to the pound, quite. TO BROIL OR FRY PORK CUTLETS, Cut them about half an inch thick from a delicate loin of pork, trim them into neat form, and take off part of the fat, or the whole of it when it is not liked; dredge a little pepper or cayenne upon them, and broil them over a clear and moderate fire, from fifteen to eighteen minutes, sprinkle a little fine salt upon them just before they are dished. They may be dipped into egg and then into bread-crumbs mixed with minced sage, then finished in the usual way. When fried, flour them well, and season them with salt and pepper first. Serve them with gravy made in the pan, or with sauce Robert. COBBETT’s RECEIPT FOR CURING BACON. (.Extracted from his “ Cottage Economy.”) “ All other parts being taken away, the two sides that remain and which are called flitches are to be cured for bacon. They are first rubbed with salt on their inside, or flesh sides, then placed one on the other, the flesh sides uppermost in a salting-trough, which has a gutter round its edges to drain away the brine ; for to have sweet and fine bacon the flitches must not be sopping in brine, which gives it the sort of taste that barrel-pork and sea-junk have, and than which nothing is more villainous. Every one knows how different is the taste of fresh dry salt from that of salt in a dis- solved state. Therefore, change the salt often ; once in four or five days. Let it melt and sink in, but let it291 CHAP. XI.] PORK. -not lie too long. Change the flitches, put that at bottom which was first on the top. Do this a couple of times. This mode will cost you a great deal more in salt, than the sopping mode ; but without it your bacon will not be so sweet and fine, nor keep so well. As to the time required for making the flitches sufficiently salt, it depends on circumstances; the thickness of the flitch, the state of the weather, the place wherein the salting is going on. It takes a. longer time for a thick than for a thin flitch; it takes longer in dry than in damp weather, it takes longer in a dry than a damp place. But for the flitches of a hog of five score, in weather not very dry. or very damp, about six weeks may do; and as yours is to be fat, which receives little injury from over-salting, give time enough ; for you are to have bacon till Christmas comes again. The place for salting should, like a dairy, always be cool, but always admit of a free circulation of air; confined air, though cool, will taint meat sooner than the mid- day sun accompanied with a breeze. With regard to smoking the bacon, two precautions are necessary: first to hang the flitches where no rain comes down upon them, and next, that the smoke must proceed from wood, not peat turf nor coal. As to the time that it requires to smoke a flitch, it must depend a good deal upon whether there be a constant fire beneath, and whether the fire be large or small. A month will do if the fire be pretty constant and sucli as a farm house fire usually is. But over-smoking, or rather, too long hanging in the air, makes the bacon rust. Great atten- tion should, therefore, be paid to this matter. The flitch ought not to be dried up to the hardness of a board, and yet it ought to be perfectly dry. Before you hang it up, lay it on the floor, scatter the flesh-side pretty thickly over with bran or with some fine saw- dust, not of deal or fir. Rub it on the flesh or pat it well down upon it. This keeps the smoke from getting into the little openings, and makes a sort of crust to be dried on.292 MODERN COOKERY. [chap. XI. “ To keep the bacon sweet and good, and free from hoppers, sift fine some clean and dry wood-ashes. Put some at the bottom of a box or chest long enough to hold a flitch of bacon. Lay in one flitch ; and then put in more ashes, then another flitch, and cover this with six or eight inches of the ashes. The place where the box or chest is kept ought to be dry, and should the ashes become damp they should be put in the fire- place to dry, and when cold, put back again. With these precautions the bacon will be as good at the end of the year as on the first day.” Obs.—Although the preceding directions for curing the bacon are a little vague as regards the proportions of salt and pork, we think those for its after-manage- ment will be acceptable to many of our readers, as in our damp climate it is often a matter of great difficulty to preserve hams and bacon through the year from rust. A GENUINE YORKSHIRE RECEIPT FOR CURING HAMS AND BACON. “ Let the swine be put up to fast for twenty-four hours before they are killed (and observe that neither a time of severe frost, nor very damp weather is favour- able for curing bacon). After a pig has been killed and scalded, let it hang twelve hours before it is cut up, then for every stone, or fourteen pounds’ weight of the meat, take one pound of salt, an ounce and a quarter of saltpetre, and half an ounce of coarse sugar. Rub the sugar and saltpetre first into the fleshy parts of the pork, and remove carefully with a fork any extravasated blood that may appear on it, together with the broken vessels adjoining; apply the salt especially to those parts, •as well as to the shank-ends of the hams, and any other portions of the flesh that are more particularly exposed. Before the salt is added to the meat, warm it a little before the fire, and use only a part of it in the first instance; then, as it dissolves, or is absorbed by the meat, add the remainder at several different times. Let the meat in the mean while lie either on clean straw,293 CHAP. XT.] PORK. or on a cold brick or stone floor; it will require from a fortnight to three weeks’ curing, according to the state of the atmosphere. When done, hang it in a cool dry- place, where there is a thorough current of air, and let it remain there until it is perfectly dry, when the salt will he found to have crystallized upon the surface. The meat may then be removed to your store, and kept in a close chest, surrounded with clean outer straw. If very large, the hams will not be in perfection in less than twelve months from the time of their being stored. Pork, 20 stone; salt, 20 lbs. ; saltpetre, 20 ozs. ; sugar, 10 ozs. : 14 to 21 days. KENTISH MODE OF CUTTING UP AND CURING A PIG. To a porker of sixteen stone (Kentish weight, that is to say, eight pounds to the stone, or nine stone two pounds of common weight), allow two gallons of salt, two pounds of saltpetre, one pound of coarse sugar, and two pounds of bay-salt, well dried and reduced to powder. Put aside the hams and cheeks to be cured by themselves; let the feet, ears, tail, and eye parts of the head be salted for immediate eating. The blade-bones, and ends of the loins and ribs reserved for sausage-meat should it be wanted, and the loin and spare-ribs for roasting. Divide and salt the remainder thus : Mix well together the saltpetre, sugar, and bay-salt, and rub the pork gently with them in every part; cover the bottom of the pickling tub with salt, and pack in the pork as closely as possible, with a portion of the remaining salt between each layer. A very little water is sometimes sprinkled in to facilitate the dissolving of the salt into a brine, but this is better avoided, if possible, and in damp weather will not be needed. If in a fortnight it should not have risen, so as almost entirely to cover the meat, boil a strong brine of salt, saltpetre, sugar, and bay-salt; let it remain till perfectly cold, and then pour it over the pork. A board, with a heavy stone weight upon it, should be kept upon the meat, to force it down under the brine.2'94 MODERN COOKERY. (jCHAP. X3r In from three to four months it will be fit for table, and will be delicate and excellent pickled pork. The pickling parts of a porker of sixteen stone, (Kentish weight, or nine stone two pounds of common weight, or fourteen pounds to the stone) ; common salt, 2 gallons; saltpetre, 2 lbs.; coarse sugar, 1 lb.; bay- salt, 2 lbs. FRENCH BACON FOR LARDING. Cut the bacon from the pig with as little lean to it a& possible. Rub it well in every part, with salt which has been dried, reduced to powder, and sifted; put the layers of bacon close against and upon each other, in a shallow wooden trough, and set it in a cool, but not a damp cellar; add more salt all round the bacon, and lay a board, with a very heavy weight upon it. Let it remain for six weeks, then hang it up in a dry and airy place. Pork, 14 lbs.; salt, 14 ozs. : 6 weeks. TO PICKLE CHEEKS OF BACON AND HAMS. One pound of common salt, one pound of the coarsest sugar, and one of saltpetre, in fine powder, to each stone (fourteen pounds) of the meat will answer this purpose extremely well. An ounce of black pepper can be added, if liked, and when less sugar is preferred, the proportion can be diminished one-half, and the quantity of salt as much increased. Bacon also may be cured by this receipt, or by the Bordyke one for hams. A month is sufficient time for the salting, unless the pork be very large, when five weeks must be allowed for a ham. The ingredients may be well mixed, and all applied at the same time. To each 14 lbs. of pork, salt, 1 lb.; coarse sugar* 1 lb.; saltpetre, 1 oz.; pepper (if used), 1 oz. : 4 to 5 weeks. HAMS SUPERIOR TO WESTPHALIA. Take the liams as soon as the pig is sufficiently cold to be cut up, rub them well with common salt, andCHAP. XI.] PORK. 295 leave them for three days to drain; throw away the brine, and for a couple of hams of from fifteen to eighteen pounds weight, mix together two ounces of saltpetre, a pound of coarse sugar, and a pound of common salt; rub the hams in every part with these, lay them into deep pickling-pans with the rind down- wards, and keep them for three days well covered with the salt and sugar; then pour over them a bottle of good vinegar, and turn them in the brine, and baste them with it daily for a month; drain them well, rub them with bran, and let them be hung for a month high in a chimney over a wood-fire to be smoked. Hams, of from 15 to 18 lbs. each, 2; to drain 3 days. Common salt, and coarse sugar, each 1 lb.; saltpetre, 2 ozs. : 3 days. Vinegar, 1 bottle: a month. To be smoked 1 month. Obs.—Such of our readers as shall make trial of this admirable receipt, will acknowledge, we doubt not, that the hams thus cured are in reality superior to those of Westphalia. It was originally given to the public by the celebrated French cook, Monsieur Ude, to whom, after having proved it, we are happy to acknow- ledge our obligation for it. He directs that the hams when smoked should be hung as high as possible from the fire, that the fat may not be melted; a very neces- sary precaution, as the mode of their being cured ren- ders it peculiarly liable to do so. This, indeed, is somewhat perceptible in the cooking, which ought, therefore, to be conducted with especial care. The hams should be very softly simmered,* and not over- done. They should be large, and of finely-fed pork, or the receipt will not answer. We give the result of our first trial of it, which was perfectly successful. Leg of Suffolk farm-house pork, 14 to 15 lbs. ; saltpetre, 1 \ oz.; strong coarse salt, 6 ozs.; coarse sugar, 8 ozs.: 3 days. Fine white-wine vinegar, 1 pint. * We have not been able to make the trial ourselves, but we think they would be even finer baked than boiled.296 [CHAP. XT. MODERN COOKERY. In pickle, turned daily, 1 month. Smoked over wood, 1 month. Obs.—When two hams are pickled together a smaller proportion of the ingredients is required for each, than for one which is cured by itself. HAMS. (.Bor dyke Receipt.') After the hams have been rubbed with salt, and well drained from the brine, according to our previous di- rections, take, for each fourteen pounds weight of meat, one ounce of saltpetre in fine powder, mixed with three ounces of the coarsest sugar; rub the meat in every part with these, and let it remain some hours, then cover it well with eight ounces of bay-salt, dried and pounded, and mixed with four ounces of com- mon salt: in four days add one pound of treacle, atid keep the hams turned daily, and well basted with the pickle for a month. Hang them up to drain for a night, fold them in brown paper, and send them to be smoked for a month. An ounce of ground black pepper is often mixed with the saltpetre in this receipt, and three ounces of bruised juniper-berries are rubbed on to the meat before the salt is added, when hams of a very high flavour are desired. Ham, 14 lbs.; saltpetre, 1 oz.; coarse sugar, 3 ozs.: 8 to 12 hours. Bay-salt | lb.; common salt, 4 ozs. : 4 days. Treacle, 1 lb. : 1 month. To heighten fla- vour, black pepper 1 oz.; juniper-berries, 3 ozs. TO BOIL A HAM. The degree of soaking which must be given to a ham before it is boiled, must depend both on the man- ner in which it has been cured, and on its age. If highly salted, hard, and old, a day and night, or even longer, may be requisite to dilate the pores sufficiently, and to extract a portion of the salt. To do either effec- tually the water must be several times changed during the steeping. We generally find hams cured by any of297 CHAP. XI.] PORK. the receipts which we have given in this chapter quite enough soaked in twelve hours; arid they are more frequently laid into water only early in the morning of the day on which they are boiled. Those pickled by Monsieur Ude’s receipt need much less steeping than any others. After the ham has been scraped, or brushed, as clean as possible, pare lightly away any part which, from being blackened or rusty, would dis- figure it; though it is better not to cut the flesh at all unless it be really requisite for the good appearance of the joint. Lay it into a ham-kettle, or into any other vessel of a similar form, and cover it plentifully with cold water; bring it very slowly indeed to boil, and clear off carefully the scum which will be thrown up in great abundance. So soon as the water has been cleared from this, draw back the pan quite to the edge of the stove, that the ham may be simmered softly, but steadily, until it is tender. On no account allow it to boil fast. A bunch of herbs and three or four carrots, thrown in directly after the water has been skimmed, will improve it. When it can be probed very easily with a sharp skewer, or larding-pin, lift it out, strip off the skin, and should there be an oven at hand, set it in for a few minutes, after having laid it on a drainer; strew fine raspings over it, or grate a liard-toasted crust, or sift upon it the prepared bread of page 155, unless it is to be glazed, when neither of these must be used. Small ham, 3J to 4 hours; moderate sized, 4 to 4j hours; very large, 5 to 5^ hours. Obs.— We have seen the following manner of boiling a ham recommended, but we have not tried it:—“ put into the water in which it is to be boiled, a quart of old cider and a pint of vinegar, a large bunch of sweet herbs, and a bay-leaf. When it is two-thirds done, skin, cover it with raspings, and set it in an oven until it is enough: it will prove incomparably superior to a ham boiled in the usual way.”[CHAP. XT. 298 MODERN COOKERY. FRENCH RECEIPT FOR BOILING A HAM. After having soaked, thoroughly cleaned, and trimmed the ham, put over it a little very sweet clean hay, and tie it up in a thin cloth; place it in a ham-kettle, a braising pan, or any other vessel as nearly of its size as can he, and cover it with two parts of cold water, and one of light white-wine (we think the reader will find cider a good substitute for this); add, when it boils and has been skimmed, four or five carrots, two or three onions, a large bunch of savoury herbs, and the smallest bit of garlic. Let the whole simmer gently from four to five hours, or longer should the ham be very large. When perfectly tender, lift it out, take off the rind, and sprinkle over it some fine crumbs, or some raspings of bread mixed with a little finely minced parsley. TO BAKE A HAM. Unless when too salt, from not being sufficiently soaked, a ham (particularly a young and fresh one) eats much better baked than boiled, and remains good longer. The safer plan is to lay it into plenty of cold water over night. The following day soak it for an hour or more in warm water, wash it delicately clean, trim smoothly off all rusty parts, and lay it with the rind downwards into a coarse paste rolled to about an inch thick; moisten the edges, draw, pinch them together, and fold them over on the upper side of the ham, taking care to close them so that no gravy can escape. Send it to a well-heated, but not a fierce oven. A very small ham will require quite three hours baking, and a large one five. The crust and the skin must be removed while it is hot. When part only of a ham is dressed, this mode is better far than boiling it. TO BOIL BACON. When very highly salted and dried it should be soaked for an hour before it is dressed. Scrape and wash it well, cover it plentifully with cold water, let it bothPORK. CHAP.

Bacon requires long boiling, but the precise time depends upon its quality, the flesh of young porkers becoming tender much sooner than that of older ones; sometimes, too, the manner in which the animal has been fed renders the meat hard, and it will then, unless thoroughly cooked, prove very indigestible. From ten to fifteen minutes less for the pound, must be allowed for unsmoked bacon, or for pickled pork. Smoked bacon, (striped) .2 lbs., from 1J to 1^- hour; unsmoked bacon, or pork, 1 to lj hour. Ohs.—The thickest part of a large gammon of bacon will require from twenty to thirty minutes longer boil- ing than the thinner side. BACON BROILED OR FRIED. Cut it evenly in thin slices, or rashers, as they are generally called, pare from them all rind and rust, curl them round, fasten them with small slight skewers, then fry, broil, or toast them in a Dutch oven: draw out the skewers before they are sent to table. A few minutes will dress them either way. They may also be cooked without being curled. The rind should always be taken off, and the bacon gently toasted, grilled, or fried, that it may be well done without being too much dried, or hardened : it should be cut thin. DRESSED RASHERS OF BACON. Slice rather thicker than for frying, some cold boiled bacon, and strew it lightly on both sides with fine rasp- ings of bread, or with a grated crust which has been very slowly and gradually toasted till brown quite300 MODERN COOKERY.

Split open the head of a middling sized porker, remove the brain and all the bones, strew the inside rather thickly with fine salt, and let it drain until the following day. Cleanse the ears and feet in the same manner; wipe them all from the brine, lay them into a large pan, and rub them well with an ounce and a half of saltpetre mixed with six ounces of sugar ; in twelve hours, add six ounces of salt; the next day pour a quarter-pint of good vinegar over them, and keep them turned in the pickle every twenty-four hours, for a week, then wash it off the ears and feet, and boil them about an hour and a half; bone the feet while they are warm, and trim the gristle from the large ends of the ears. When these are ready, mix a large grated nutmeg with a teaspoonful and a half of mace, half a teaspoonful of cayenne, and as much of cloves. Wash, but do not soak the head, wipe and flatten it on a board ; cut some of the flesh from the thickest parts, and (when the whole of the meat has been seasoned equally with the spices) lay it on the thinnest; intermix it with that of the ears and feet, roll it up very tight, and bind it firmly with broad tape; fold a thin pudding-cloth quite closely round it, and tie it securely at both ends. A braising-pan, from its form, is best adapted for boiling it, but if there be not one at hand, place the head in a vessel adapted to its size, with the bones and trimmings of the feet and ears, a large bunch of savoury herbs, two moderate-sized onions, a small head of celery, three or four carrots, a teaspoonful of pepper-corns, and sufficient cold water to cover it well; boil it very gently for four hours, and leave it until two parts cold in the liquor in which it was boiled.

Chop, not very fine, one pound of lean pork with two pounds of the inside fat; strew over, and mix tho- roughly with them three teaspoonsful of salt, nearly half as much pepper, a half-teaspoonful of mace, one small nutmeg, grated, and a large tablespoonful of mixed parsley, thyme, and sage, (and sweet-basil, if it can be procured) all minced extremely small. Press the meat closely and evenly into a shallow tin,—such as are used for Yorkshire puddings will answer well,—and bake it in a very gentle oven from an hour to an hour and a half: it is served cold, in slices. Should the proportion of fat be considered too much, it can be diminished on a second trial. Lean of pork, 1 lb.; fat, 2 lbs.; salt, 3 teaspoonsful; • pepper, 1 \ teaspoonful; mace, J teaspoonful; nutmeg, 1 small; mixed herbs, 1 large tablespoonful : 1 to 1J hour. SAUSAGE-MEAT CAKE; OR, PAIN DE PORC FRAIS. Season very highly from two to three pounds of good sausage-meat, both with spices and wftth sage, or with thyme and parsley, if these be preferred; press the mixture into a pan, and proceed exactly as for the veal- cake of page 253. A few minced eschalots can be mixed with the meat for those wTho like their flavour. SAUSAGES. Common farm-house sausages are made with nearly equal parts of fat and lean pork, coarsely chopped, and seasoned with salt and pepper only. They are put into skins (which have previously been turned inside out, scraped very thin, washed with exceeding nicety, and wiped very dry), then twisted into links, and should be hung in a cool airy larder, when they will remain good for some time. Odd scraps and trimmings of pork are802 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XI. a usually taken for sausage-meat when the pig is killed and cut up at home; but the chine and blade-bone are preferred in general for the purpose. The pork rinds, as we have already stated,* will make a strong and almost flavourless jelly, which may be used with excellent effect for stock, and which, with the addition of some pork-bones, plenty of vegetables, and some dried peas, will make a very nutritious soup for those who do not object to the pork-flavour which the bones will give. Half an ounce of salt, and nearly or quite a quarter- ounce of pepper will sufficiently season each pound of the sausage-meat. KENTISH SAUSAGE-MEAT. To three pounds of lean pork, add two of fat, and let both be taken clear of skin. As sausages are lighter, though not so delicate when the meat is somewhat coarsely chopped, this difference should be attended to in making them. When the fat and lean are partially mixed, strew over them two ounces and a half of dry salt, beaten to powder, and mixed with one ounce of ground black pepper, and three large tablespoonsful of sage, minced very fine. Turn the meat with the chopping knife, until the ingredients are well blended. Test it, before it is taken off the block, by frying a small portion, that if more seasoning be desired, it may at once be added. A full-sized nutmeg, and a small dessertspoonful of pounded mace, would, to many tastes, improve it. This sausage-meat is usually formed into cakes, which, after being well floured, are roasted in a Dutch oven. They must be watched, and often turned, that no part may be scorched. The meat may be put into skins, and dressed in any other way as wTell. Lean of pork, 3 lbs.; fat, 2 lbs.; salt, 2J ozs.; pepper, 1 oz.; minced sage, 3 large tablespoonsful. * We were compelled by want of space for more essential matter, to withdraw from Chapter 1. the receipt in which this was named.303 PORK. CHAP. XI.] EXCELLENT SAUSAGES. Chop, first separately, and then together, one pound and a quarter of veal, perfectly free from fat, skin, and sinew, an equal weight of lean pork, and of the inside fat of the pig. Mix well, and strew over the meat an ounce and a quarter of salt, half an ounce of pepper, one nutmeg grated, and a large teaspoonful of pounded mace. Turn, and chop the sausages till they are equally seasoned throughout, and tolerably fine; press them into a clean pan, and keep them in a very cool place. Form them, when wanted for table, into cakes something less than an inch thick, flour and fry them for about ten minutes in a little butter. Lean of veal and pork, of each 1 lb. 4 ozs.; fat of pork, 1 lb. 4 ozs. ; salt, 1oz. ; pepper, \ oz.; nut- meg, 1 ; mace, 1 large teaspoonful: fried in cakes, 10 minutes. POUNDED SAUSAGE-MEAT.

BOILED SAUSAGES. In Lincolnshire, sausages are frequently boiled in the skins, and served upon a toast, as a corner dish. They should be put into boiling water, and simmered from seven to ten minutes, according to their size. SAUSAGES AND CHESTNUTS. An excellent dish. {French.)

This is a corner dish. There should be no sage mixed with the pork to dress thus.

Young, plump, well-fed, but not over-fatted poultry is the best. The skin.of fowls and turkeys should be305 CHAP. XII.] POULTRY. clear, white, and finely grained, the breasts broad and full-fleshed, the legs smooth, the toes pliable and easily broken when bent back; the birds should also be heavy in proportion to their size. This applies equally to geese and ducks, of which the breasts likewise should be very plump, and the feet yellow and flexible : when these are red and hard, the bills of the same colour, and the skin full of hairs, and extremely coarse, the birds are old. White-legged fowls and chickens should be chosen for boiling, because their appearance is the most delicate when dressed; but the dark-legged ones often prove more juicy and of better flavour when roasted, and their colour then is immaterial. Every precaution should be taken to prevent poultry from becoming ever so slightly tainted before it is cooked, but unless the weather be exceedingly sultry, it should not be quite freshly killed :* pigeons only are the better for being so, and are thought to lose their flavour by hanging even a day or two. Turkeys, as we have stated in our receipts for them, are very tough and poor eating if not sufficiently long kept. A goose, also, in winter, should hang some days before it is dressed, and fowls, likewise, will be improved by it. All kinds of poultry should be thoroughly cooked, though without being overdone, for nothing in general can more effectually destroy the appetite than the taste and appearance of their flesh when brought to table half roasted or boiled.

Raise the flesh first from the lower part of the back-bone,* and work the knife gradually to the socket of the thigh ; with the point of the knife detach the joint from it, take the end of the bone firmly in the fingers, and cut the flesh clean from it down to the next joint, round which pass the point of the knife carefully, and when the skin is loosened from it in every part, cut round the next bone, keeping the edge of the knife close to it, until the whole of the leg is done. Remove the bones of the other leg in the same manner; then detach the flesh from the back and breast-bone, sufficiently to enable you to reach the upper joints of the wings; proceed with these as with the legs, but be especially careful not to pierce the skin of the second joint : it is usual to leave the pinions unboned, in order to give more easily its natural form to the fowd when it is dressed. The merry-thought and neck-bones may now easily be cut away, the back and side-bones taken out without being divided, and the breast-bone separated carefully from the flesh, (which, as the work progresses, must be turned back from the bones upon the fowl, until it is completely inside out). After the one remaining bone is removed, draw the wings and legs back to their proper form, and turn the fowl the right side outwards. A turkey is boned exactly in the same manner, but as it requires a very large proportion of forcemeat to fill it entirely, the legs and wings are sometimes drawn into the body, to diminish the expense of this. If very securely trussed, and sewn, the bird may be either boiled, or stewed in rich gravy, as well as roasted, after being boned and forced. ANOTHER MODE OF BONING A FOWL OR TURKEY. Cut tltrough the skin down the centre of the back, and raise the flesh carefully on either side with the point of a sharp knife, until the sockets of the wings * A little also from the end of the breast-hone, if necessary.CHAP. XII.] POULTRY. 307 and thighs are reached. Till a little practice has been gained, it will perhaps be better to bone these joints before proceeding further; but after they are once de- tached from it, the whole of the body may easily be separated from the flesh, and taken out entire : only the neck-bones and merrythought will then remain to be removed. The bird thus prepared may either be re- stored to its original form, by filling the legs and wings with forcemeat, and the body with the livers of two or three fowls, if they can be procured, mixed with alternate layers of parboiled tongue, freed from the rind, fine sausage-meat, or veal-forcemeat, or thin slices of the nicest bacon, or ought else of good flavour, which will give a marbled appearance to the fowl when it is carved, and then be sewn up and trussed as usual; or the legs and wings may be drawn inside the body, and the bird being first flattened on a table may be covered with sausage-meat, and the various other ingredients we have named, so placed that it shall be of equal thickness in every part; then tightly rolled, bound firmly together with a fillet of broad tape, wrapped in a thin pudding-cloth, closely tied at both ends, and dressed as follows:—Put it into a braising-pan, stewpan, or thick iron saucepan, bright in the inside, and fitted as nearly as may be to its size; add all the chicken-bones, a bunch of sweet herbs, two carrots, two bay-leaves, a large blade of mace, twenty-four white peppercorns, and any trimmings or bones of undressed veal which may be at hand, cover the whole with good veal-broth; add salt, if needed, and stew it very softly, from an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half; let it cool in the liquor in which it was stewed; and after it is lifted out, boil down the gravy to a jelly and strain it ; let it become cold, clear off the fat, and serve it cut into large dice or roughed, and laid round the fowl, which is to be served cold. If restored to its form, instead of being rolled, it must be stewed gently for an hour, and may then be sent to table hot, covered with mushroom, or any other good sauce that308 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XII. may be preferred; or it may be left till the following day, and served garnished with the jelly, which should be firm, and very clear and well-flavoured : the liquor in which a calf’s foot has been boiled down, added to the broth, will give it the necessary degree of con- sistency. French cooks add three or four onions to these preparations of poultry (the last of which is called a galantine) ; but these our own taste would lead us to reject. Rolled, 11 hour to 1 and \; galantine, 1 hour. Ohs.—A couple of fowls, boned and rolled, make an excellent pie. TO BONE FOWLS FOR FRICASSEES, CURRIES, AND PIES. First carve them entirely into joints, then remove the bones, beginning with the legs and wings, at the head of the largest bone; hold this with the fingers, and work the knife as directed in the receipt above. The remainder of the birds is too easily done to require any instructions. TO ROAST A TURKEY. In very cold weather a turkey in its feathers will (in an airy larder) hang quite a fortnight with advantage ; and, however fine a quality of bird it may be, un- Turkey trussed for Roasting. jess sufficiently long kept, it will prove not worth the dressing, though it should always be perfectly sweet when prepared for table. Pluck, draw, and singe it with exceeding care ; wash, and then dry it thoroughly with clean cloths, or merely wipe the outside well, without wetting it, and pour water plentifully through the inside. Fill the breast with forcemeat (No. 1, page 170), or with the finest sausage-meat, highly seasoned with minced herbs, lemon-rind, mace, and cayenne. Truss the bird309 CHAP. XII.] POULTRY. firmly, lay it to a clear sound fire, baste it constantly and bountifully with butter, and serve it when done with good brown gravy, and well-made bread-sauce. An entire chain of delicate fried sausages is still often placed in the dish, round a turkey, as a garnish. It is usual to fold and fasten a sheet of buttered writing-paper over the breast to prevent it being too much coloured: this should be removed twenty minutes before the bird is done. The forcemeat of chestnuts (No. 15, Chapter YI.) may be very advantageously substituted for the commoner kinds in stuffing it, and the body may then be filled with, chestnuts, previously stewed till tender in rich gravy, or simmered over a slow fire in plenty of rasped bacon, with a high season- ing of mace, nutmeg, and cayenne, till they are so ; or, instead of this, well-made chestnut sauce, or a dish of stewed chestnuts may be sent to table with the turkey. l-L to 2^ hours. Obs.—A turkey should be laid at first far from the fire, and drawn nearer when half done, though never sufficiently so to scorch it; it should be well roasted, for even the most inveterate advocates for under-dressed meats will seldom tolerate the taste or sight of partially- raw poultry. TO BOIL A TURKEY. A delicate but plump hen-turkey of mode- rate size should be se- lected for boiling. Pick and draw it, using the greatest precaution not to break the gall- bladder ; singe it with writing-paper, take off Turkey for Boiling. the head and neck, cut through the skin round the first joint of the legs, and draw them off; this is best accomplished by fastening the feet to a strong hook, and then pulling the bird away from it. Wash it ex- ceedingly clean, and then wipe it dry; fill the breast310 MODERN COOKERY. [chap, xir: with the forcemeat No. 1 or 2 of Chapter VI., or with the oyster, chestnut, or French forcemeat, of which the receipts are given in the same Chapter. In trussing- it draw the legs into the body, break the breast-bone, and give the turkey as round and plump an appearance as can be. Put it into plenty of icarm water, clear off the scum with the greatest care as it is thrown to the surface, and boil the bird very gently from an hour and a half to two hours and a quarter. A very large turkey would require a longer time, but it is unsuited to this mode of cooking. When the oyster-forcemeat is used, a large tureen of rich oyster-sauce should accom- pany the dish ; but celery-sauce, or good white sauce, may otherwise be sent to table with it; and a boiled tongue or a small ham is usually served in addition. For a plain family dinner, parsley and butter, and a delicate cheek of bacon, are sometimes substituted for either of these, and parsley and butter for a more expen- sive sauce. Fast boiling will cause the skin of the bird to break, and must therefore be especially avoided : it should hang for some days before it is dressed, for if quite freshly killed it will not be tender, but it must be perfectly sweet to be fit for table. Moderate-sized turkey, 1-J- to 2 hours ; large turkey, longer; very small one, less time. TURKEY BONED AND FORCED. {An excellent dish.) Take a small, well-kept, but quite sw~eet hen-turkey, of from seven to eight pounds weight, and remove, by the receipt for a fowl (page 306), all the bones, except those of the pinions, without opening the bird ; draw it into shape, and fill it entirely with exceedingly fine sausage-meat, beginning with the legs and wings; plump the breast well in preparing it, and when its original form is quite restored, tie it securely at both ends, and at the extremities of the legs; pass a slight iron skewer through these and the body, and another through the wings and body; then lay a twine over the311 €HAP. XII.] POULTRY. back of the turkey, and pass it under the ends of the first skewer, cross it in the centre of the back, and pass it under the ends of the second skewer, then carry it over the pinions to keep them firmly in their place, and fasten it at the neck. When a cradle spit, of which the engraving shows the form, and which opens with a joint Cradle Spit. to receive the roast, is not at hand, a bottle jack will be found more convenient than any other for holding the turkey ; and after the hook of this is passed through the neck, it must be further supported by a string running across the back and under the points of the skewer wdiich confines the pinions, to the hook ; for, otherwise, its weight would most probably cause it to fall. Flour it well, place it far from the fire until it is heated through, and baste it plentifully and incessantly with butter. An hour and three-quarters will roast it well. Break and boil down the bones for gravy in a pint and a half of w7ater, with a little salt, a few slices of celery, a dozen corns of pepper, and a branch or two of parsley. Brown gently in a morsel of good butter, a couple of ounces of lean h^m, add to them a slight dredge of flour, and a little cayenne, and pour to them the broth from the bones, after it has boiled an hour, and been strained and skimmed; shake the stewpan well round, and stew the gravy until it is wanted for table; clear it entirely from fat, strain, and serve it very hot. An eschalot, or half an onion may be browned with the ham when either is liked, but their flavour is not, we think, appro- priate with poultry. The turkey may be partially filled with the force- meat No. 1 or 3, of Chapter VI., and the sausage-meat may then be placed on either side of it. Hen-turkey between 7 and 8 lbs. weight, boned, filled with sausage-meat, 3 to 4 lbs. ; or with forcemeat No. 1, or with No. 3, Chapter VI., 1 lb. (that is to say.312 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP.

Obs.-—When a common spit is u$ed for the turkey, it must be fastened to, and not put on it. Bread-sauce can be served with the bird, or not, at pleasure. It will be found an improvement to moisten the sausage-meat with one or two spoonsful of water: it should be finely minced, well spiced, and mixed with herbs, when the common forcemeat is not used in addition. In preparing it, a pound and a quarter of fat should be mixed with each pound of the lean. To give the turkey a very good appearance, the breast may be larded by the directions of page 200. TURKEY A LA FLAMANDE ; OR, DINDE POUDREE. Prepare as for boiling a fine well-kept hen-turkey; wipe the inside thoroughly with a dry cloth, but do not wash it; throw in a little salt to draw out the blood, let it remain a couple of hours or more, then drain and wipe it again ; next, rub the outside in every part with about four ounces of fine dry salt, mixed with a large table- spoonful of pounded sugar ; rub the turkey well with these, and turn it every day for four days, then fill it entirely with equal parts of choice sausage-meat, and the crumb of bread soaked in boiling milk or cream, and wrung dry in a cloth; season these with the grated rind of a large lemon, a small nutmeg, some mace, cayenne, and fine herbs, in the same proportion as for veal-force- meat (No. 1, page 170). Sew the turkey up very securely, and when trussed, roll it in a cloth, tie it closely at both ends, and boil it very gently between three and four hours. When taken up, sprinkle it thickly with fine crumbs of bread, mixed with plenty of parsley, shred extremely small. Serve it cold, with a sauce made of the strained juice and grated rind of two lemons, a teaspoonful of made mustard, and one of pounded sugar, with as much oil as will prevent its being more than pleasantly acid, and a little salt, if needed;POULTRY. 313 CIIAP. XII.l * work these together until perfectly mixed, and send them to table in a tureen. This receipt was given to us abroad, by a Flemish lady, who had had the dish often served with great success in Paris. We have inserted it on her authority, not on our own experience. TO ROAST A GOOSE. After it has been picked and singed with care, put into the body of the goose two parboiled onions of mode- rate size, chopped fine, and mixed with half an ounce of minced sage-leaves, a salt- spoonful of salt, and half as much black pepper, or a pro- Goose ready for the SP“- portionate quantity of cayenne; to these add a small slice of fresh butter ; truss the goose, and after it is on the spit, tie it firmly at both ends that it may turn steadily, and that the seasoning may not escape. Poast it at a brisk fire, and keep it constantly basted. Serve it with brown gravy, and apple, or tomata sauce. When the taste is in favour of a stronger seasoning than the above, which occurs, we apprehend, but seldom, use raw onions for it, and increase the quantity; but should one still milder be preferred, mix a handful of fine bread-crumbs with the other ingredients, or two or three minced apples. The body of a goose is some- times filled entirely with mashed potatoes, which, for the purpose, ought to be boiled very dry, and well blended with two or three ounces of butter, or with some thick cream, some salt, and white pepper or cayenne : and to these minced sage and parboiled onions can also be added at pleasure. A teaspoonful of made-mustard, half as much of salt, and a small portion of cayenne, smoothly mixed with a glass of port wine are sometimes poured into the goose just before it is served, through a cut made in the apron. \\ to lj hour.314 [CHAP. XII. MODERN COOKERY. Ohs.—We extract, for the benefit of our readers, from a work in our possession, the following passage, of which we have had no opportunity of testing the cor- rectness. “ Geese, with their sage and onions, may be deprived of power to breathe forth any incense, thus : — Pare from a lemon all the yellow rind, taking care not to bruise the fruit nor to cut so deeply as to let out the juice. Place this lemon in the centre of the seasoning within the bird. When or before it is brought to table, let the flap be gently opened, remove the lemon with a tablespoon; avoid breaking, and let it instantly be thrown away, as its white, pithy skin will have ab- sorbed all the gross particles which else would have escaped.” TO ROAST A GREEN GOOSE. Season the inside with a little pepper and salt, and roast the goose at a brisk fire from forty to fifty minutes. Serve it with good brown gravy only. TO ROAST A FOWL. Strip off the feathers, and carefully pick every stump or plug from the skin, as nothing can be more uninviting than the ap- pearance of any kind of poultry where this has been neglected, nor more . indicative of slovenliness on the part of the cook. Take off the head anc^ neck close to the body, but leave sufficient of the skin to tie over the part that is cut. In drawing the bird, do not open it more than is needful, and use great precaution to avoid breaking the gall-bladder. Hold the legs in boiling water for two ot three minutes that the skin may be peeled from them easily ; cut off the claws, and then, with a bit of lighted writing-paper, singe off the hairs without blackening the fowl. Wash, and wipe it afterwards very dry, and let the liver and gizzard be made315 CHAP. XII.] POULTRY. delicately clean, and fastened into the pinions. Truss, and spit it firmly ; flour it well when first laid to the fire ; baste it frequently with butter, and when it is done, draw out the skewers, dish it, pour a little good gravy over, and send it to table with bread, mushroom, egg, or chestnut sauce. A common mode of serving roast fowls in France is aux cressons, that is, laid upon young water-cresses, which have previously been freed from the outer leaves, thoroughly washed, shaken dry in a clean cloth, and sprinkled with a little fine salt, and a small quantity of vinegar: these should cover the dish, and after the fowls are placed on them, gravy should be poured over as usual. The body of a fowl may be filled with very small mushrooms prepared as for partridges (see partridges with mushrooms), then sewn up, roasted, and served with mushroom-sauce: this is an excellent mode of dressing it. A slice of fresh butter mixed with some salt and cayenne or pepper ; a little rasped bacon ; or a bit or two of the lean of beef or veal minced, or cut info dice, may be put inside the bird when either is considered an improvement. An ounce or two of fresh butter smoothly mixed with a teaspoonful of really good mushroom-powder, a little pounded mace, salt, and cayenne, will impart much more of flavour to the fowl. Full-sized fowl, 1 hour: young chicken, 25 to 35 minutes. Obs.—As we have already observed in our general remarks on roasting, the time must be regulated by various circumstances, which we named, and which the cook should always take into consideration. A but- tered paper should be fastened over the breast, and removed about fifteen minutes before the fowl is served : this will prevent its taking too much colour. ROAST FOWL. (A French Receipt.') Fill the breast of a fine fowl with good forcemeat, roast it as usual, and when it is very nearly ready to[CHAP.

Put it down to the fire, and when it is of a clear light brown all over take it carefully from the spit, dish, and serve it with lemon-sauce, and with gravy thickened and mixed with plenty of minced parsley, or with brown gravy and any other sauce usually served with fowls. Savoury herbs shred small, spice, and lemon grate, may be mixed with the crumbs at pleasure. Do not pour gravy over the fowl when it is thus prepared. TO ROAST A GUINEA FOWL. Let the bird hang for as many days as the weather will allow; then stuff, truss, roast, and serve it like a turkey, or leave the head on and lard the breast. Send gravy and bread-sauce to table with it in either case; it will be found excellent eating. f to 1 hour. FOWL A LA CARLSFORT. Bone a fowl without opening the back, and restore it to its original form by filling the vacant spaces in the legs and wings with forcemeat; put a roll of it also into the body, and a large sausage on either side; tie it very securely at both ends, truss it with fine skewers, and roast it for a full hour, keeping it basted plentifully with butter. When appearance is not regarded, the pinions may be taken off, and the legs and wings drawn inside the fowl, which will then require a much smaller proportion of forcemeat:—that directed for veal (No. 1, page 1?0), will answer quite well in a general way, but for a dinner of ceremony, No. 17 or 18 of the same Chapter, should be used in preference. The fowl must be tied securely to the spit, not put upon it. Boned chickens are excellent when entirely filled with well- made mushroom-forcemeat, or very delicate and nicely seasoned sausage-meat, and either roasted or stewed.317 CHAP. XII.] POULTRY. Brown gravy, or mushroom-sauce should then be sent to table with them. BOILED FOWLS. White-legged poul- try should always be selected for boiling, as they are of better co- lour when dressed than any others. Truss them firmly and Fowls trussed for boiling. neatly, with the legs drawn into the bodies, and the wings twisted over the backs; let them be well covered with water, which should be hot, but not boiling when they are put in. A full-sized fowl will require about three-quarters of an hour from the time of its beginning to simmer; young chickens not more than from twenty to twenty-five minutes: they should be very gently boiled, and the scum should be removed with great care as it gathers on the surface of the water. Either of the following sauces may be sent to table with them : parsley and butter, bechamel, English white-sauce, oyster, celery, or white- mushroom sauce. The fowls are often dished with small tufts of delicately boiled cauliflower placed round them; or with young vegetable marrow, scarcely larger than an egg, merely pared and halved after it is dressed: white sauce must be served with both of these. Full-sized fowl, f hour: young chickens, 20 to 25 minutes. Obs.—Half a gallon of cold added to an equal quan- tity of boiling water, will bring it to the proper degree of heat for putting in the fowls.

It should be served very hot, with mush- room-sauce, or with a little good plain gravy, which may be thickened and flavoured with a teaspoonful of mushroom-powder (should it be at hand), mixed with half as much flour and a little butter; or with some Es- pagnole. It should be opened at the back, and evenly divided quite through; the legs should be trussed like those of a boiled fowl; the breast-bone, or that of the back may be removed at pleasure, and both sides of the bird should be made as flat as they can, that the fire may penetrate every part equally; the inside should be first laid towards it. The neck, feet, and gizzard may be boiled down with a small quantity of onion and carrot previously browned in a morsel of butter, to make the gravy; and the liver, after having been simmered with them for five or six minutes, may be used to thicken it after it is strained. A teaspoonful of lemon- juice, some cayenne, and minced parsley should be added to it, and a little arrow-root, or flour and butter. I to | hour. FRICASSEED FOWLS OR CHICKENS. To make a fricassee of good appearance without great expense, prepare, with exceeding nicety, a couple of plump chickens, strip off the skin, and carve them very neatly. Reserve the wings, breasts, merry-thoughts, and thighs; and stew down the inferior joints with a couple of blades of mace, a small bunch of savoury herbs, a few white peppercorns, a pint and a half of water, and a small half-teaspoonful of salt. When something more than a third part reduced, strain the gravy, let it cool, and skim off every particle of fat. Arrange the joints which are to be fricasseed in one layer, if it can be done conveniently, and pour to them as much of the gravy as will nearly cover them ; add the very thin rind of half a fine fresh lemon, and simmer the fowls gently from half to three-quarters of an hour;319 POULTRY. CHAP.

Skin, and cut into joints, one or two young chickens, remove the bones with care from the breasts, merry- thoughts, and the thighs, which are to be separated from the legs. Mix well together a teaspoonful of salt, and nearly a fourth as much of mace, a little grated nutmeg, and cayenne; flatten, and form into good shape, the boned joints of chicken, and the flesh of the wings, rub a little of the seasoning over them in every part, dip them into beaten egg, and then into very fine bread- crumbs, and fry them gently in fresh butter till they are of a delicate brown. Some of the bones and trim- mings may be boiled down in half a pint of water, with a roll of lemon-peel, a little salt, and eight or ten white peppercorns, to make the gravy, which, after being strained and cleared from fat, may be poured hot to some thickening made in the pan with a slice of fresh butter and a dessertspoonful of flour: a teaspoonful of mushroom-powder would improve it greatly, and a small quantity of lemon-pickle or juice should be added before it is poured out, with salt and cayenne if required. Pile the cutlets high in the middle of the dish, and serve the sauce under them, or in a tureen. CUTLETS OF FOWLS, PARTRIDGES, OR PIGEONS. (French Receipt.)

When all are ready, fry to a pale brown as many diamond-shaped sippets of bread as there are bits of fowl, and let them be quite as large; place these before the fire to dry, and wipe out the pan. Dip the cutlets into some yolks of eggs mixed with a little clarified butter, and strew them in every part with the finest bread-crumbs, moderately seasoned with salt, cayenne, and pounded mace. Dissolve as much good butter as will be required to dress them, and fry them in it of a light amber-colour; arrange them upon the sippets of bread, pile them high in the dish, and pour a rich brown gravy or Sauce Espagnole round, but not over them. FRIED CHICKEN A LA MALABAR. This is an Indian dish. Cut up the chicken, wipe it dry, and rub it well with currie-powder, mixed with a little salt; fry it in a bit of butter, taking care that it is of a nice light brown. In the mean time cut two or three onions into thin slices, draw them out into rings, and cut the rings into little bits, about half an inch long; fry them for a long time gently in a little bit of clarified butter, until they have gradually dried up and are of a delicate yellow-brown. Be careful that they are not burnt, as the burnt taste of a single bit would spoil the flavour of the whole. When they are as dry as chips, without the least grease or moisture upon them, mix a little salt with them, strew them over the fried chicken, and serve up with lemon on a plate. We have extracted this receipt from a clever little work called the u Hand-Book of Cookery.” HASHED FOWL. After having taken off, in joints, as much of a cold fowl, or fowls as will suffice for a dish, bruise the bodiesPOULTRY. 321 CHAP. XII.] with a paste roller, pour to them a pint of water, and boil them for an hour and a half to two hours, with the addition of a little pepper and salt only, or with a small quantity of onion, carrot, and herbs. Strain, and skim the fat from the gravy, put it into a clean saucepan, and, should it require thickening, stir to it, when it boils, half a teaspoonful of flour, smoothly mixed with a small bit of butter; add a little mushroom catsup, or store- sauce, with a slight seasoning of mace or nutmeg. Lay in the fowl, and keep it near the fire until it is heated quite through, and is at the point of boiling: serve it with fried sippets round the dish. For a hash of higher relish, add to the bones, when they are first stewed down, a large onion, minced and browned in butter, and before the fowl is dished, add some cayenne, and the juice of half a lemon. MINCED FOWL. (French Receipt.) Raise from the bones all the more delicate parts of the flesh of either cold roast, or cold boiled fowls, clear it. from the skin, and keep it covered from the air, till wanted for use. Boil the bones, well bruised, and the skin; with three-quarters or a pint of water, until reduced quite half, then strain the gravy and let it cool; next, having first skimmed off the fat, put it into a clean sauce- pan, with a quarter-pint of cream, an ounce and a half of butter, well mixed with a dessertspoonful of flour, a little pounded mace, and grated lemon-rind; keep these stirred until they boil, then put in the fowl,finely minced, with three or four hard-boiled eggs, chopped small, and sufficient salt, and white pepper, or cayenne, to season it properly. Shake the mince over the fire till it is just ready to boil, stir to it quickly a squeeze of lemon- juice, dish it with pale sippets of fried bread, and serve it immediately. When cream cannot easily be obtained, use milk, with a double quantity of butter and flour. The eggs may be omitted; the mince may be warmed in good white sauce, and a border formed round it of YMODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XII. 322 leaves of pastry, fried or baked. An excellent variety of this dish is made also by covering the mince thickly with very fine bread-crumbs, moistening them with clarified butter, and giving them colour with a sala- mander, or in a quick oven. The dish must then be deep.* « COLD FOWLS, EN FRITURE. •Cut into joints, and take the skin from some, cold fowls, lay them into a deep dish, strew over them a little fine salt and cayenne, add the juice of a lemon, and let them remain for an hour, moving them occasionally, that they may all absorb a portion of the acid ; then dip them one by one into some French batter (see page 154), and fry them a pale brown over a gentle fire. Serve them garnished with very green crisped parsley. A few drops of eschalot vinegar may be mixed with the lemon- juice which is poured to the fowls, or slices of raw onion or eschalot, and small branches of sweet herbs may be laid amongst them, and cleared off before they are dipped into the batter. Gravy made of the trimmings, thickened, and well-flavoured, may be sent to table with them in a tureen, and dressed bacon (see page 299), in a dish apart. GRILLADE OF COLD FOWLS. Carve and soak the remains of roast fowls as above, wipe them dry, dip them into clarified butter, and then into fine bread-crumbs, and broil them gently over a very clear fire. A little finely minced lean of ham, or grated lemon-peel, with a seasoning of cayenne, salt, and mace, mixed with the crumbs, will vary this dish agreeably. When fried, instead of broiled, the fowls may be dipped into yolk of egg, instead of butter, but this renders them too dry for the gridiron. COLD FOWLS. {The housekeepers receipt. A supper dish.)

Place the fowls, neatly carved and trimmed, in the centre, with some branches of curled parsley, or other light foliage amongst them. Cold tongue may be substituted for the ham with advantage. This dish has a handsome appearance, and is convenient for the purpose of quick serving. FOWLS A LA MAYONNAISE. Carve with great nicety a couple of cold roast fowls ; place the inferior joints, if they are served at all, close together in the middle of a dish, and arrange the others round and over them, piling them as high as you can in the centre. Border the dish with the hearts of young lettuces cut in two, and hard-boiled eggs, halved length- wise. At the moment of serving, pour over the fowls a well-made mayonnaise sauce (see page 134), or, if preferred, a salad mixture, compounded with thick cream, instead of oil.

CHAPTER XIII. GAME. TO CHOOSE GAME. Buck venison, which is in season only from June to Michaelmas, is considered finer than doe venison, which comes into the market in October, and remains in season through November and December: neither should be cooked at any other part of the year. The greater the depth of fat upon the haunch the better the quality of the meat will be, provided it be clear and white, and the lean of a dark hue. If the cleft of the hoof, which326 [CHAP. XIII. MODERN COOKERY. is always left on the joint, be small and smooth, the animal is young; but it is old when the marks are the reverse of these.* Although the haunch is the prime and favourite joint of venison, the neck and shoulder are also excellent, stewed in various ways, or made into pasties. If kept to the proper point, and well dressed, this is the most tender of all meat; but care is necessary to bring it into a fitting state for table without its be- coming offensive. A free current of air in a larder is always a great advantage, as it assists materially in preserving the sweetness of every thing which is kept in it, while a close damp atmosphere, on the contrary, is more destructive of animal food of all kinds, even than positive heat. The fumes of creosote are said to be an admirable preservative against putrescence, but we have not ourselves yet had experience of the fact. Ail moisture should be wiped daily, or even more frequently, from the venison, with soft cloths, when any appears upon the surface; and every precaution must be taken to keep off the flies, when the joint is not hung in a wire- safe. Black pepper thickly powdered on it will gene- rally answer the purpose: with common care, indeed, meat may always be protected from their attacks, and to leave it exposed to them in warm weather is alto- gether inexcusable in the cook. Hares and rabbits are stiff when freshly killed, and if young, the ears tear easily, and the claws are smooth and sharp. A hare in cold weather will remain good from ten to fourteen days; care only must be taken to prevent the inside from becoming musty, which it will do if it has been emptied in the field. Pheasants, par- tridges, and other game may be chosen by nearly the same tests as poultry : by opening the bill, the staleness will be detected easily if they have been too long kept. * It must be observed that venison is not in perfection when voung : like mutton, it requires to be of a certain age before it is brought to table. The word cleft applies also to the thickest part of the haunch, and it is the depth of the fat on this, which decides the quality of the joint.CHAP. XIII.] GAME. 327 With few exceptions, game depends almost entirely for the fine flavour and the tenderness of its flesh, on the time which it is allowed to hang before it is cooked, and it is never good when very fresh ; but it does not follow that it should be sent to table in a really offensive state, for this is agreeable to few eaters and disgusting to many, and nothing should at any time be served of which the appearance or the odour may destroy the appetite of any person present. TO ROAST A HAUNCH OF VENISON. To give veni- son the flavour and the tender- ness so much prized by epi- cures, it must be well kept; and by taking the ne- cessary precautions it will hang a considerable time without detriment. Wipe it with soft dry cloths wherever the slightest moisture appears on the surface, and dust it plentifully with freshly-ground pepper or powdered ginger, to preserve it from the flies. The application of the pyroligneous acid would effectually protect it from these, as well as from the effects of the weather; but the joint must then be, not only well washed, but soaked some considerable time, and this would be injurious to it: the acid, therefore, should only be resorted to for the purpose of restoring to an eatable state that which would otherwise be lost, from having been kept beyond the point in which it is pos- sible to serve it. To prepare the venison for the spit, wash it slightly with tepid water, or merely wipe it thoroughly with damp cloths, and dry it afterwards with clean ones; then lay over the fat side a large sheet of thickly- buttered paper, and next a paste of flour and water about three-quarters of an inch thick ; cover this[CHAP. XIII. 328 MODERN COOKERY. again with two or three sheets of stout paper, secure the whole wTell with twine, and lay the haunch to a sound clear fire; baste the paper immediately with butter, or clarified dripping, and roast the joint from three hours and a half to four and a half, according to its weight and quality. Doe venison will require half an hour less time than buck venison. Twenty minutes before the joint is done remove the paste and paper, baste the meat in every part with butter, and dredge it very lightly with flour; let it take a pale-brown colour, and send it to table as hot as possible with unflavoured gravy in a tureen, and good currant jelly. It is not now customary to serve any other sauces with it; but should the old-fashioned sharp or sweet sauce be ordered, the receipt for it will be found at page 105.* 3^ to hours. TO STEW A SHOULDER OF VENISON. Bone the joint, by the directions given for a shoulder of veal or mutton (see page 250); flatten it on a table, season it well with cayenne, salt, and pounded mace, mixed with a very small proportion of allspice; lay over it thin slices of the fat of a loin of well-fed mut- ton ; roll and bind it tightly, lay it into a vessel nearly of its size, and pour to it as much good stock made with equal parts of beef and mutton as will nearly cover it; stew it as slowly as possible from three hours to three and a half or longer, should it be very large, and turn it when it is half done. Dish and serve it with a good Espagnole, made with part of the gravy in which it has been stewed; or thicken this slightly with rice-flour, mixed with a glass or more of claret or ofport-wine, and as much salt and cayenne as will sea- son the gravy properly. Some cooks soak the slices of mutton-fat in wine before they are laid upon the joint; but no process of * Plates of minced eschalots are still sometimes handed round to the venison-eaters ; but not at very refined tables we believe.CHAP. XIII.] GAME. 320 the sort will ever give to any kind of meat the true flavour of the venison, which to most eaters is far finer than that of the wine, and should always be allowed to prevail over all the condiments with which it is dressed. Those, however, who care for it less than for a dish of high artificial savour, can have eschalots, ham, and carrot, lightly browned in good butter, added to the stew when it first begins to boil. 3^ to 4 hours. TO HASH VENISON.* For a superior hash of venison, add to three quarters of a pint of strong thickened brown-gravy, Christopher North’s sauce, in the proportion directed for it in the receipt of page 131. Cut the venison in small thin slices of equal size, arrange them in a clean saucepan, pour the gravy on them, let them stand for ten minutes or more, then place them near the fire, and bring the whole very slowly to the point of boiling only : serve the hash immediately in a hot-water dish. For a plain dinner, when no gravy is at hand, break down the bones of the venison small, after the flesh has been cleared from them, and boil them with those of three or four undressed mutton-cutlets, a slice or two of carrot, or a few savoury herbs, and about a pint and a half of water or broth, until the liquid is reduced quite one-third. Strain it off, let it cool, skim off all the fat, heat the gravy, thicken it when it boils with a dessertspoonful or rather more of arrow-root, or with the brown roux of page 114, mix the same sauce with it, and finish it exactly as the richer hash above. It may be served on sippets of fried bread or not, at choice. TO ROAST A HARE. After the hare has been skinned, or cased, as it is * Minced collops of venison may be prepared exactly like those of beef; and venison-cutlets like those of mutton : the neck may be taken for both of these.330 MODERN COOKERY.

Pierce with the point of a knife any parts in which the blood appears to have settled, and soak them in tepid water, that it may be well drawn out. Wipe the hare dry, fill it with the force- meat (No. 1. page 170), sew it up, truss and spit it firmly, baste it for ten minutes with lukewarm wrater, mixed with a very little salt, throw this away, and put into the pan a quart or more of new milk, keep it constantly laded over the hare, until it is nearly dried up, then add a large lump of butter, flour the hare, and continue the basting steadily, until it is well browned; for unless this be done, and the roast be kept at a proper distance from the fire, the outside will become so dry and hard as to be quite uneatable. Serve the hare when done, with good brown gravy, (of which a little should be poured round it in the dish,) and with fine red currant jelly. This is an approved English method of dressing it, but we would recommend in preference, that it should be basted plentifully with butter from the beginning. (The strict economist may substitute clarified beef- dripping, and finish with a small quantity of butter only) ; and that the salt and water should be altogether omitted. First-rate cooks merely wipe the hare inside and out, and rub it with its own blood before it is laid to the fire; but there is generally a rankness .about it, especially after it has been many days killed, which, weGAME. 331 CHAP. XIII.] should say, renders the washing indispensable, unless a coarse game-flavour be approved. lj to If hour. ROAST HARE. (aSuperior Receipt.') A hare may be rendered far more plump in appear- ance, and infinitely easier to carve, by taking out the bones of the back and thighs, or of the former only : in removing this, a very sharp knife should be used, and much care will be required to avoid cutting through the skin just over the spine, as it adheres closely to the bone. Nearly double the usual quantity of forcemeat must be prepared, and with this restore the legs to their original shape, and fill the body, which should previously be lined with delicate slices of the nicest bacon, of which the rind and edges have been trimmed away. Sew up the hare, truss it as usual; lard it or not, as is most con- venient, keep it basted plentifully with butter while roasting, and serve it with the customary sauce. We have found two tablespoonsful of the finest currant jelly, melted in a half-pint of rich brown gravy, an acceptable accompaniment to hare, where the taste has been in favour of a sweet sauce. To remove the back-bone, clear from it first the flesh in the inside; lay this back to the right and left from the centre of the bone to the tips ; then work the knife on the upper side quite to the spine, and when the whole is detached except the skin which adheres to this, sepa- rate the bone at the first joint from the neck-bone (or ribs; we know not how more correctly to describe it), and pass the knife with caution under the skin down the middle of the back. The directions for boning the thighs of a fowl will answer equally for a hare, and we therefore refer the reader to them. STEWED HARE. Wash and soak the hare thoroughly, wipe it very dry, cut it down into joints, dividing the largest, flour and[CHAP. XIII. MODERN COOKERY. 332 brown it slightly in butter, with some bits of lean ham, pour to them by degrees a pint and a half of gravy, and stew the hare very gently from an hour and a half to two hours : when it is about one-third done, add the very thin rind of half a large lemon, and ten minutes before it is served, stir to it a large dessertspoonful of rice-flour, smoothly mixed with two tablespoonsful of good mushroom catsup, a quarter-teaspoonful or more of mace, and something less of cayenne. This is an excellent plain receipt for stewing a hare; but the dish may be enriched with forcemeat, No. 1. (page 170), rolled into small balls, and simmered for ten minutes in the stew, or fried and added to it after it is dished; a higher seasoning of spice, a couple of glasses of port wine, with a little additional thickening, and a table- spoonful of lemon-juice, will all serve to give it a heightened relish.

Unless kept to the proper point, a pheasant is one of the most tough, dry, ’and flavourless birds that is sent to table; but when it has hung as many days as it can, without becoming really tainted, and is well roasted and served, it is most excellent eating. Pluck off the feathers carefully, cut a slit in the Pheasant, trussed back of the neck to remove the crop, for roasting. then draw the bird in the usual way, and either wipe the inside very clean with a damp cloth, or pour water through it; wipe the outside also, but with a dry cloth ; cut off the toes, turn the head of the bird under the wing, with the bill laid straight along the breast, skewer the legs, which must not be crossed, flour the pheasant well, lay it to a brisk fire, and baste it constantly and plentifully with well-flavoured butter. Send bread-sauce and good brown gravy to table with it. The entire breast of the bird may be larded by the directions of page ‘200.

BOUDIN OF PHEASANT A LA RICHELIEU. Take, quite clear from the bones, and from all skin and sinew, the flesh of a half-roasted pheasant; mince, and then pound it to the smoothest paste; add an equal bulk of the floury part of some fine roasted potatoes, qr of such as have been boiled by Captain Kater’s receipt; (see Chapter XV.), beat these together till they are well blended ; next throw into the mortar something less (in volume) of fresh butter than there was of theGAME.

XIII.] 335 plieasant-flesh, with a high seasoning of mace, nutmeg, and cayenne, and a half-teaspoonful or more of salt; pound the mixture afresh for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, keeping it turned from the sides of the mortar into the middle, then add one by one, after merely taking out the germs with the point of a fork, two whole eggs, and a yolk or two without the whites, if these last will not render the mixture too moist. Mould it into the form of a roll, lay it into a stewpan rubbed with butter, pour boiling water on it and poach it gently from ten to fifteen minutes. Lift it out with care, drain it on a sieve, and when it is quite cold cover it equally with beaten egg, and then with the finest bread-crumbs, and broil it over a clear fire, or fry it in butter of a clear golden brown. A good gravy should be made of the remains of the bird, and sent to table with it; the flavour may be heightened with ham and eschalots as directed in Chapter III, page 98, and small mushrooms, sliced sideways, and stewed quite tender in butter may be mixed with the boudin after it is taken from the mortar: or their flavour may be given more delicately by adding to it only the butter in which they have been simmered, well pressed from them through a strainer. The mixture, which should be set into a very cool place before it is moulded, may be made into several small rolls, which will require four or five minutes’ poaching only. The flesh of partridges will answer quite as well as that of pheasants for this dish. TO ROAST PARTRIDGES. Let the birds hang as long as they can possibly be kept without becoming offensive ; pick them carefully, draw, and singe them ; wipe the insides thoroughly with a clean cloth; truss them with the head turned under the wing and the legs drawn close together or crossed.

Serve them with bread-sauce, and good brown gravy : a little of this last should be poured over them. In some counties they are dished upon fried bread-crumbs, but these are better handed round the table by themselves. Where game is plentiful we recommend that the remains of a cold roasted partridge should be well bruised and boiled down with just so much water, or unflavoured broth, as will make gravy for a couple of other birds : this, seasoned with salt and cayenne only, or flavoured with a few mushrooms, will be found a very superior accompaniment to roast partridges, to the best meat-gravy that can be made. A little eschalot, and a few herbs can be added to it at pleasure. It should be served also with boiled or broiled partridges in preference to any other. 30 to 40 minutes. Obs.—Rather less time must be allowed w7hen the birds are liked underdressed. In preparing them for the spit, the crop must be removed through a slit cut in the back of the neck; the claws be clipped close, and the legs held in boiling water for a minute that they may be skinned the more easily. BOILED PARTRIDGES. This is a delicate mode of dressing young and tender birds. Pick, clean, and wash them well; cut- off the heads, truss them like boiled fowls, and when ready drop them into a large pan of boiling water, throw a little salt on them, and in fifteen, or at the utmost in eighteen minutes they will be ready to serve. Lift them out, dish them quickly, and send them to table with white mushroom-sauce, with bread-sauce and game-gravy (see preceding receipt), or with celery-sauce. Our own mode of having them served, is usually with a slice of fresh butter, about a tablespoonful of lemon-juice, and a good sprinkling of cayenne placed in a very hot dish, un^er the birds. 15 to 18 minutes.CHAP. XIII.] 337 GAME. PARTRIDGES WITH MUSHROOMS. For a brace of young well-kept birds, prepare from half to three-quarters of a pint of mushroom buttons, or very small flaps, as for pickling. Dissolve over a gentle fire an ounce and a half of butter, throw in the mush- rooms with a slight sprinkling of salt and cayenne, simmer them from eight to ten minutes, and turn them, with the butter, on to a plate; when they are quite cold, put the whole into the bodies of the partridges, sew them up, truss them securely, and roast them on a ver- tical jack with the heads downwards; or should an ordinary spit be used, tie them firmly to it, instead of passing it through them. Roast them the usual time, and serve them with brown mushroom-sauce, or with gravy and bread-sauce only. The birds may be trussed like boiled fowls, floured, and lightly browned in butter, then half covered with rich brown gravy and stewed slowly for thirty minutes, then turned, and simmered for another half hour with the addition of some mush- rooms to the gravy; or they may be covered with small mushrooms stewed apart, when they are sent to table. They can also be served with their sauce only, simply thickened with a small quantity of fresh butter, smoothly mixed with less than a teaspoonful of arrow-root and flavoured with cayenne and a little catsup, wine, or store-sauce. Partridges, 2; mushrooms, i to f pint; butter, 1^ oz.; little mace and cayenne: roasted 30 to 40 minutes, or stewed 1 hour. Obs.—Nothing can be finer than the game flavour imbibed by the mushrooms with which the birds are filled, in this receipt. BROILED PARTRIDGE. {Breakfast dish.) “ Split a young and well-kept partridge, and wipe it with a soft clean cloth inside and out, but do not wash it; broil it delicately over a very clear fire, sprinkling it z[CHAP. XIII. MODERN COOKERY. 338 with a little salt and cayenne; rub a bit of fresh butter over it the moment it is taken from the fire, and send it quickly to table with a sauce made of a good slice of butter browned with flour, a little water, cayenne, salt, and mushroom-catsup, poured over it.” AYe give this receipt exactly as we received it from a house where we know it to have been greatly approved by various guests who have partaken of it there. BROILED PARTRIDGE. (.French Receipt.) After having prepared the bird with great nicety, divided, and flattened it, season it with salt, and'pepper, or cayenne, dip it into clarified butter, and then into very fine bread-crumbs, and take care that every part be equally covered : if wanted of particularly good appearance dip it a second time into the butter and crumbs. Place it over a very clear fire, and broil it gently from twenty to thirty minutes. Send it to table with brown mushroom-sauce, or some Espagnole. THE FRENCH, OR RED-LEGGED PARTRIDGE. This is dressed precisely like our common partridge, and is excellent eating if it be well-kept; otherwise it is tough and devoid of flavour. It does not, we believe, abound commonly in England, its hostility to the gray partridge, which it drives always from its neighbour- hood, rendering it an undesirable occupant of a preserve. It was at one time, however, plentiful in Suffolk,* and in one or two of the adjoining counties, but great efforts we have understood have been made to exterminate it. TO ROAST BLACK COCK AND GRAY HEN. These birds, so delicious when well kept and well roasted, are tough and comparatively flavourless wben too soon dressed. They should hang therefore till they give unequivocal indication of being ready for the spit. * Brought there by the late Marquis of Hertford, to his Sud- borne estate.339 GAME. CHAP. XIII.]. Pick and draw them with exceeding care, as the skin is easily broken; truss them like pheasants, lay them at a moderate distance from a clear brisk fire, baste them plentifully and constantly with butter, and serve them on a thick toast which has been laid under them in the dripping-pan for the last ten minutes of their roasting, and which will have imbibed a high degree of savour : some cooks squeeze a little lemon-juice over it before it is put into the pan. Send rich brown gravy and bread- sauce to table with the birds. From three-quarters of an hour to a full hour will roast them. Though kept to the point which we have recommended, they wTill not offend even the fastidious eater after they are dressed, as, unless they have been too long allowed to hang, the action of the fire will remove all perceptible traces of their previous state. In the earlier part of the season, when warm weather and close packing have ren- dered them, in their transit from the North, apparently altogether unfit for table, the chloride of soda may be used with great advantage to restore them to a fitting state for it; though the copious washings which must then be resorted to may diminish something of their fine flavour, f to 1 hour. TO ROAST GROUSE. Handle the birds very lightly in picking them, draw, and wipe the inside with clean damp cloths, or first w’ash, and then dry them well; though this latter mode would not be approved generally by epicures. Truss the birds in the same manner as the black cock, and roast them about half an hour at a clear and brisk fire, keeping them basted almost without intermission. Serve them on a buttered toast which has been laid under them in the pan for ten minutes, or with gravy and bread-sauce only. \ hour to 35 minutes. Ohs.—There are few occasions, we think, in which the contents of the dripping-pan can be introduced at table with advantage; but in dressing moor-game, we[[chap. XIII. 340 MODERN COOKERY. would strongly recommend tlie toast to be laid in it under the birds, as it will afford a superior relish even to the birds themselves. A SALMI OF MOOR-FOWL, PHEASANTS, OR PARTRIDGES. This is an elegant mode of serving the remains of roasted game, but when a superlative salmi is desired, the birds must be scarcely more than half roasted for it. In either case, carve them very neatly, and strip every particle of skin and fat from the legs, wings, and breasts; bruise the bodies well, and put them, with the skin, and other trimmings, into a very clean stewpan. If for a simple and inexpensive dinner, merely add to them two or three sliced eschalots, a bay-leaf, a small blade of mace, and a few peppercorns; then pour in a pint, or rather more, of good veal gravy, or strong broth, and boil it briskly till reduced nearly half; strain the gravy, pressing the bones well, to obtain all the flavour, skim off the fat, add a little cayenne and lemon-juice, heat the game very gradually, in it, but do not, on any account, allow it to boil; place sippets of fried bread round a dish, arrange the birds in good form in the centre, give the sauce a boil, and pour it on them. This is but a homely sort of salmi, though of excellent flavour if well made; it may require, perhaps, the addition of a little thickening, and two or three glasses of dry white wine poured to the bodies of the birds, with the broth, would bring it nearer to the French salmi in flavour. As the spongy substance in the inside of moor-fowl and black- game is apt to be extremely bitter, when they have been long kept, care should be taken to remove such parts as would endanger the preparation. FRENCH SALMI ; OR HASH OF GAME. Prepare undressed, or half-roasted game by the direc- tions we have already given, and after having stripped the skin from the thighs, wings, and breasts, arrange the joints evenly in a clean stewpan, and keep them covered from the air and dust till wanted. Cut down into dice341 GAME. GHAP. XIII.] four ounces of the lean of an unboiled ham, and put it, with two ounces of butter, into a thick well-tinned saucepan, or stewpan; add three or four minced eschalots (more, should a high flavour of them be liked), two ounces of sliced carrot, four cloves, two bay-leaves, a dozen peppercorns, one blade of mace, a small sprig or tw'o of thyme, and part of a root of parsley, or two or three small branches of the leaves. Stew these over a gentle fire, stirring, or shaking them often, until the sides of the saucepan appear of a reddish-brown, then mix well in a dessertspoonful of flour, and let it take a little colour; next, add by degrees, making the sauce boil as each portion is thrown in, three quarters of a pint of strong veal stock, or gravy, and nearly half a pint of sherry or Madeira; put in the well-bruised bodies of the birds, and boil them from an hour to an hour and a half; strain, and clear the sauce quite from fat, pour it on the joints of game, heat them in it slowly, and when they are near the point of boiling, dish them immediately with delicately fried sippets round the dish. When mushrooms can be obtained, throw a dozen or two small ones, with the other seasonings, into the butter. The wine 'is sometimes added to the vegetables, and one half reduced before the gravy is added ; but though a sauce of fine colour is thus produced, the flavour of the wine is entirely lost. TO ROAST WOODCOCKS OR SNIPES. Handle them as little and as lightly as possible, and pluck off the feathers gently; for if this be violently done the skin of the birds will be broken. Do not draiv them, but after having wiped them with clean soft cloths, truss them with the head under the wing, and the bill laid close along the breast; pass a slight skewer through the thighs, catch the ends with a bit of Snipe.342 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XIII. twine, and tie it across to keep the legs straight. Sus- pend the birds with the feet downwards to a bird-spit, flour them well, and baste them with butter, which should be ready dissolved in the pan or ladle. Before the trail begins to drop, which it will do as soon as they are well heated, lay a thick round of bread, freed from the crust, and toasted a delicate brown, into the pan under them to catch it, as this is considered finer eating than the flesh of the birds; continue the basting, letting the butter fall from them into the basting-spoon or ladle, as it cannot be collected again from the dripping-pan should it drop there, in consequence of the toast, or toasts being in it. There should be one of these for each woodcock, and the trail should be spread equally over it. When the birds are done, which they will be? at a brisk fire, in from twenty to twenty- five minutes, lay the toasts into a very hot dish, dress the birds upon them, pour a little gravy round the bread, and send more to table in a tureen. 20 to 25 minutes. TO ROAST THE PINTAIL, OR SEA PHEASANT. This beautiful bird is by no means rare upon our eastern coast, but we know not whether it be much seen in the markets generally. It is most excellent eating, and should be roasted at a clear quick fire, well floured when first laid down, turned briskly, and basted with butter almost without intermission. If drawn from the spit in from twenty-five to thirty minutes, then dished and laid before the fire for two or three more, it will give forth a singularly rich gravy. Score the breast when it is carved, sprinkle on it a little cayenne and fine salt, and let a cut lemon be handed round the table when the bird is served; or omit the scoring, and send round with it brown gravy, and Christopher North’s sauce made hot. 20 to 30 minutes. TO ROAST WILD DUCKS. These are prepared for the spit exactly like the tame ones, with the exception of the stuffing, which is never343 CHAP. XIV.] CURRIES, POTTED MEATS, &C. used for wild fowl. A bit of soft bread soaked in port wine, or in claret, is sometimes put into them, but noticing more. Flour them well, lay them rather near to a very clear and brisk fire, that they may be quickly browned, and yet retain their juices. Baste them plen- tifully and constantly with butter, and if it can be so regulated let the spit turn with them rapidly. From fifteen to twenty minutes will roast them sufficiently for the generality of eaters; but for those who object to them much under-dressed a few additional minutes must be allowed. Something less of time will suffice when they are prepared for persons who like them scarcely more than heated through. Teal, which is a more delicate kind of wild fowl, is roasted in the same way: in from ten to fifteen minutes it will be enough done for the fashionable mode of serving it, and twenty minutes will dress it well at a good fire. (Hot Water Dish.) The great superiority of the oriental curries over those generally prepared in England is not, we believe, alto- gether the result of a want of skill or of experience on the part of our cooks, but is attributable, in some measure, CHAPTER XIV. CURRIES, POTTED MEATS, &c.3U MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XIV. to many of the ingredients which in a fresh and green state add so much to their excellence, being here be- yond our reach. The natives of the East compound and vary this class of dishes, we are told, with infinite ingenuity, blending in them very agreeably many condiments of different flavour, till the highest degree of piquancy and savour is produced, the whole being tempered with fine vegetable acids. With us, turmeric and cayenne pepper prevail in them often far too power- fully : the prodigal use of the former should be especially avoided, as it injures both the quality and the colour of the currie, which ought to be of a dark green, rather than of a red or yellow hue. The first is given by the genuine powder imported from India ; the others, by the greater number of spurious ones, sold in England, under its name. A couple of ounces of a sweet sound cocoa-nut lightly grated and stewed for nearly or quite an hour in the gravy of a currie is a great improvement to its flavour : it will be found particularly agreeable with that of sweetbreads, and may be served in the currie, or strained from it at pleasure. Great care, however, should be taken not to> use, for the purpose, a nut that is rancid. Spinage, cucumbers, vegetable marrow, tomatas, acid apples, green gooseberries (seeded), and tamarinds imported in the shell—not preserved—may all, in their season, be added, with very good effect, to curries of different kinds. Potatoes and celery are also occasionally boiled down in them. The rice for a currie should always be sent to table in a separate dish from it, and, in serving them, it should be first helped, and the currie laid upon it. MR. ARNOTT’S CURRIE-POWDER. Turmeric, eight ounces. Coriander seed, four ounces. Cummin seed, two ounces. Foenugreek seed, two ounces. Cayenne, half an ounce. (More or less of this last to the taste.)CHAP. XIV.] CURRIES, POTTED MEATS, &C. 345 Let the seeds be of the finest quality. Dry them well, pound, and sift them separately through a lawn sieve, then weigh, and mix them in the above propor- tions. This is an exceedingly agreeable and aromatic powder, when all the ingredients are perfectly fresh and good, hut the preparing it is rather a .troublesome pro- cess. Mr. Arnott recommends that when it is considered so, a “high-caste” chemist should be applied to for it. The Messieurs Corbyn and Co., 300, High Holborn, are so justly celebrated for the superior quality and genuineness of every thing supplied by them to the public, that we can scarcely do better than name them to such of our readers as may be unacquainted with their house : their drugs are allowed to be quite equal in quality to those which are procured at Apothecaries’ Hall. MR. ARNOTT’s CURRIE. 44 Take the heart of a cabbage, and nothing but the heart, that is to say, pull away all the outside leaves till it is about the size of an egg; chop it fine, add to it a couple of apples sliced thin, the juice of one lemon, half a teaspoonful of black pepper, with one large table- spoonful of my currie-powder, and mix the whole well together. Now take six onions that have been chopped fine and fried brown, a garlic head, the size of a nutmeg, also minced fine, two ounces of fresh butter, two table- spoonsful of flour, and one pint of strong mutton or beef gravy ; and when these articles are boiling, add the former ingredients, and let the whole be well stewed up together : if not hot enough, add cayenne pepper. Next, put in a fowl that has been roasted and nicely cut up ; or a rabbit; or some lean chops of pork or mutton ; or a lobster; or the remains of yesterday’s calf’s head; or any thing else you may fancy; and you will have an excellent currie, fit for kings to partake of.” 44 Well! now for the rice ! It should be put into water which should be frequently changed, and should remain in for half an hour at least; this both clears and soaks it. Have your saucepan full of water (the larger the better),MODERN COOKERY. 346 [CHAP. XIV. and when it boils rapidly, throw the rice in: it will be done in fifteen minutes. Strain it into a dish, wipe the saucepan dry, return the drained rice into-it, and put it over a gentle fire for a few minutes, with a cloth over it : every grain will be separate. When served, do not cover the dish.” Obs.—We have already given testimony to the excel- lence of Mr. Arnott’s currie-powder, but we think the currie itself will be found somewhat too acid for English taste in general, and the proportion of onion and garlic by one-half too much for any but well-seasoned Anglo- Indian palates. After having tried his method of boiling the rice, we still give the preference to that of page 44, Chapter I. A BENGAL CURRIE. Slice and fry three large onions in two ounces of butter, and lift them out of the pan when done. Put into a stewpan three other large onions and a small clove of garlic that have been pounded together, and smoothly mixed with a dessertspoonful of the best pale turmeric, a teaspoonful of powdered ginger, one of salt, and one of cayenne pepper; add to these the butter in which the onions were fried, and half a cupful of good gravy; let them stew for about ten minutes, taking care that they shall not burn. Next, stir to them the fried onions, and half a pint more of gravy; add a pound and a half of mutton, or of any other meat, free from bone and fat, and simmer it gently for an hour, or more should it not then be perfectly tender. Fried onions, 3 large; butter, 2 ozs.; onions, pounded, 3 large ; garlic, 1 clove; turmeric, 1 dessertspoonful; powdered ginger, salt, cayenne, each 1 teaspoonful; gravy, cupful: 10 minutes.

Dissolve a good slice of butter in a deep well-tinned stewpan or saucepan, and shake it over a brisk fire for four or five minutes, or until it begins to take colour, then put in the meat, and brown it well and equally without allowing a morsel to be scorched. The pan should be shaken vigorously every minute or two, and the meat turned in it fre- quently. When this is done, lift it out and throw into the stewpan two or three large onions finely minced, and four or five eschalots when these last are liked, add a morsel of butter, if needful, and fry them till they begin to soften; then add a quarter-pint of gravy, broth, or boiling water, and a large acid apple, or two moderate sized ones, of a good boiling kind, with the hearts of two or three lettuces, or of one hard cabbage, shred quite small (tomatas or cucumbers freed from their seeds can be substituted for these, when in season). Stew the whole slowly until it resembles a thick pulp, and add to it any additional liquid that may be required, should it become too dry; put in the meat, and simmer the whole very softly until this is done, which will be in from three quarters of an hour to an hour.* A COMMON INDIAN CURRIE. For eacli pound of meat, whether veal, mutton, or beef, take a heaped tablespoonful of good currie-powder, a small teaspoonful of salt, and one of flour; mix these well together, and after having cut down the meat into thick small cutlets, or squares, rub half of the mixed powder equally over it. Next, fry gently from one to four or five large onions sliced, with or without the addition of a small clove of garlic, or half a dozen escha- lots, according to the taste; and when they are of a fine golden brown, lift them out with a slice and lay them upon a sieve to drain; throw a little more butter into the pan and fry the meat lightly in it; drain it well * Prawns, shrimps, or the flesh of boiled lobsters may be slowly heated through, and served in this currie-sauce with good effect.MODERN COOKERY. 348 [CHAP. XIV. from tlie fat in taking it out, and lay it into a clean stewpan or saucepan, strew the onion over it, and pour in as much boiling water as will almost cover it. Mix the remainder of the currie-powder smoothly with a little broth or cold water, and after the currie has stewed for a few minutes pour it in, shaking the pan well round that it may be smoothly blended with the gravy. Sim- mer the whole very softly until the meat is perfectly tender ; this will be in from an hour and a quarter to two hours and a half, according to the quantity and the nature of the meat. Mutton will be the soonest done; the brisket end (gristles) of a breast of veal will require twice as much stewing, and sometimes more. A fowl will be done in an hour. An acid apple or two, or any of the vegetables we have enumerated at the commence- ment of this Chapter, may be added to the currie, proper time being allowed for the cooking of each variety. Very young green peas, are liked by some people in it, and cucumbers pared, seeded, and cut moderately small, are always a good addition. A richer currie will of course be produced if gravy or broth be substituted for the water: either should be boiling when poured to the meat. Lemon-juice should be stirred in before it is served, when there is no other acid in the currie. A dish of boiled rice must be sent to table with it. A couple of pounds of meat free from bone, is sufficient quite for a good sized dish of this kind, but three of the breast of veal are sometimes used for it, when it is to be served to a large family-party of currie-eaters : from half to a wdiole pound of rice should then accompany it. For the proper mode of boiling it, see mullagatawny soup, Chapter I. The Patna (small grained) is the kind which ought to be used for the purpose. Six ounces is quite sufficient for a not large currie; and a pound, when boiled dry, and heaped lightly in a dish, appears an enormous quantity for a modern table. To each pound of meat, whether veal, mutton, or beef, 1 heaped tablespoonful of good currie-powder, 1 small teaspoonful of salt, and a large one of flour, to be well mixed, and half rubbed on to the meat before it is fried,CHAP. XIV.] CURRIES, POTTED MEATS, &C. 349 the rest added afterwards ; onions fried, from 1 to 4 or 5, (with or without the addition of a clove of garlic, or half a dozen eschalots); sufficient boiling water to nearly cover the meat; vegetables, as in receipt, at choice; stewed, A\ to 2|- hours: a fowl, 1 hour, or rather less; beef, 2 lbs., A\ hour, or more; veal gristles, 2-J- hours.

These curries are made with a sort of paste, which is labelled with the above names, and as it has attracted some attention of late, and the curries made with it are very good, and quickly and easily prepared, we give the directions for them. <c Cut a pound and a half of chicken, fowl, veal, rabbit, or mutton, into pieces an inch and a half square. Put from two to three ounces of fresh butter in a stewpan, and when it is melted put in the meat, and give it a good stir with a wooden spoon; add from two to three dessertspoonsful of the currie-paste ; mix the whole up well together, and con- tinue the stirring over a brisk fire from five to ten minutes, and the currie will be done. This is a dry currie. For a gravy currie, add two or three table- spoonsful of boiling water after the paste is well mixed in, and continue tiie stewing and stirring; from ten to twelve minutes longer, keeping the sauce of the consis- tency of cream. Prepare salmon and lobster in the same way, but very quickly, that they may come up firm.

Heat and toss the maccaroni gently in this until it is well and equally covered with it. A small quan- tity of rich cream, or a little bechamel, will very much improve the sauce, into which it should be stirred just before the maccaroni is added, and the lemon-juice should be thrown in afterwards. This dish is, to our taste, far better without the strong flavouring of onion or garlic, usually given to curries ; but this, when it is preferred, can be imparted to the gravy in the usual way. Ribband maccaroni, 6 ozs.; 15 minutes. Gravy, or good beef or veal stock, full pint and ^; fine currie- powder, 1 small tablespoonsful; arrow-root, 1 teaspoon- ful ; little lemon-juice: 20 minutes. Maccaroni in sauce, 3 to 6 minutes. Ohs.—An ounce or two of grated cocoa-nut simmered in the gravy for half an hour or more, then strained and well pressed from it, is always an excellent addition. The pipe maccaroni, well curried, is extremely good : the sauce for both kinds should be made with rich gravy, especially when the onion is omitted. A few drops of eschalot-vinegar can be added to it, when the flavour is liked. CURRIED EGGS. Boil six or eight fresh eggs quite hard, as for salad, and put them aside until they are cold. Mix well together from two to three ounces of good butter, and from three to four dessertspoonsful of currie-powder; shake them, in a stewpan or thick saucepan, over a clear but moderate fire for some minutes, then throw in a couple of mild onions finely minced, and fry them gently until they are tolerably soft; pour to them, by degrees, from half to three-quarters of a pint of brothCHAP.

Cut the eggs into half-inch slices, heat them quite through in the sauce without boiling them, and serve them as hot as possible. CURRIED SWEETBREADS. Wash and soak them as usual, then throw them into boiling water with a little salt in it, and a whole onion, and let them simmer for ten minutes; or, if at hand, substitute weak veal-broth for the water. Lift them out, place them on a drainer, and leave them until they are perfectly cold ; then cut them into half-inch slices, and either flour and fry them lightly in butter, or put them, without this, into as much curried gravy as will just cover them; stew them in it very gently, from twenty to thirty minutes; add as much lemon-juice or Chili vinegar as will acidulate the sauce agreeably,* and serve the currie very hot. As we have already stated in two or three previous receipts, an ounce or more of sweet freshly-grated cocoa nut, stewed tender in the gravy, and strained from it, before the sweetbreads are added, will give a peculiarly pleasant flavour to all curries. Blanched 10 minutes; sliced (fried or not); stewed 20 to 30 minutes. CURRIED OYSTERS. “ Let a hundred of large sea-oysters be opened into a basin, without losing one drop of their liquor. Put a lump of fresh butter into a good-sized saucepan, and when it boils, add a large onion, cut into thin slices, and let it fry in the uncovered stewpan until it is of a rich brown; now add a bit more butter, and two or three tablespoonsful of currie-pow’der. When these ingre- dients are well mixed over the fire with a wooden spoon, add gradually either hot water, or broth from the stock- pot; cover the stewpan, and let the whole boil up. * A small portion of Indian pickled mango, or of its liquor, is an agreeable addition to a currie.[CHAP. XIV. 352 MODERN COOKERY. Meanwhile, have ready the meat of a cocoa-nut, grated or rasped fine, put this into the stew-pan with a few sour tamarinds (if they are to be obtained, if not, a sour apple, chopped). Let the whole simmer over the fire until the apple is dissolved, and the cocoa-nut very tender ; then add a cupful of strong thickening made of flour and water, and sufficient salt, as a currie will not bear being salted at table. Let this boil up for five minutes. Have ready also, a vegetable marrow, or part of one, cut into bits, and sufficiently boiled to require little or no further cooking. Put this in with a tomata or two; either of these vegetables may be omitted. Now put into the stew-pan the oysters with their liquor, and the milk of the cocoa-nut; stir them well with the former ingredients ; let the currie stew gently for a few minutes, then throw in the strained juice of half a lemon. Stir the currie from time to time with a wooden spoon, and as soon as the oysters are done enough serve it up with a corresponding dish of rice on the opposite side of the table. The dish is considered at Madras the ne plus ultra of Indian cookery.”* We have extracted this receipt, as it stands, from the Magazine of Domestic Economy, the season in which we have met with it not permitting us to have it tested. Such of our readers as may have partaken of the true Oriental preparation, will be able to judge of its cor- rectness ; and others may consider it worthy of a trial. We should suppose it necessary to beard the oysters. CURRIED GRAVY. The quantity of onion, eschalot, or garlic used for a currie should be regulated by the taste of the persons for whom it is prepared; the very large proportions of them which are acceptable to some eaters, preventing others altogether from partaking of the dish. Slice, and fry gently in a little good butter, from a couple to six large onions (with a bit of garlic, and four or five eschalots, or none of either), when they are coloured equally of a fine yellow-brown, lift them into a sieve * Native oysters, prepared as for sauce, may be curried by the re- ceipt for eggs or sweetbreads, with the addition of their liquor.353 CHAP. XIV.] CURRIES, POTTED MEATS, &C. reversed to drain; put them into a clean saucepan, add a pint and a half of good gravy, with a couple of ounces of rasped cocoa-nut, or any other of the condiments we have already specified, which may require as much stewing as the onions (an apple or two, for instance), and simmer them softly from half to three-quarters of an hour, or until the onion is sufficiently tender to be pressed through a strainer. We would recommend that for a delicate currie this should always be done; for a common one it is not necessary; and many persons prefer to have the whole of it left in this last. After the gravy has been worked through the strainer, and again boils, add to it from three to four dessert- spoonsful of currie-powder, and one of flour, with as much salt as the gravy may require, the whole mixed to a smooth batter with a small cupful of good cream.* Simmer it from fifteen to twenty minutes, and it will be ready for use. Lobster, prawns, shrimps, maccaroni, hard-boiled eggs, cold calf’s head, and various other meats may be heated and served in it with advantage. For all of these, and indeed for every kind of currie, acid of some sort should be added. Chili-vinegar answers well when no fresh lemon-juice is at hand. Onions, 2 to 6 (garlic, 1 clove, or eschalots, 4 to 5, or neither); fried a light brown. Gravy. pint ; cocoa-nut, 2 ozs. (3, if very young) : J to | hour. Currie-powder, 3 to 4 dessertspoonsful; flour, 1 dessert- spoonful; salt, as needed; cream, 1 small cupful: 15 to 20 minutes. Ohs.—In India, curds are frequently added to curries, but that may possibly be from their abounding much more than sweet cream in so hot a climate. POTTED MEATS. Any tender and well-roasted meat, taken free of fat, skin, and gristle, as well as from the dry outsides, will answer for potting admirably, better, indeed, than that * This must be added only just before the currie is dished, when any acid fruit has been boiled in the gravy : it may then be first blended with a small portion of arrow-root, or flour.' A A354 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XIV. which is generally baked for the purpose, and wdiich is usually quite deprived of its juices by the process. Spiced or corned beef also is excellent when thus pre- pared ; and any of these will remain good a long time if mixed with cold fresh butter, instead of that which is clarified; but no addition that can be made to it will render the meat eatable, unless it be thoroughly pounded; reduced, in fact, to the smoothest possible paste, free from a single lump or a morsel of unbroken fibre. If rent into fragments, instead of being cut quite through the grain, in being minced, before it is put into the mortar, no beating will bring it to the proper state. Unless it be very dry, it is better to pound it for some time before any butter is added, and it must be long and patiently beaten after all the ingredients are mixed, that the whole may be equally blended and well-mellowed in flavour. The quantity of butter required will depend upon the nature of the meat; ham and salted beef will need a larger proportion than roast meat, or than the breasts of poultry and game ; and fish, from being more moist, will require comparatively little. Salmon, lobsters, prawns, and shrimps are all extremely good, prepared in this way. They should, however, be extremely fresh when they are pounded, and be set immediately afterwards into a very cool place. For these, and for white meats in general, mace, nutmeg, and cayenne or white pepper, are the appropriate spices. A small quantity of cloves may be added to hare and other brown meat, but allspice we would not recommend unless the taste is known to be in favour of it. The following receipt for pounding ham will serve as a general one for the particular manner of proceeding. POTTED HAM. (An excellent Receipt.) To be eaten in perfection this should be made with a freshly cured ham, which, after having been soaked for twelve hours, should be wiped dry, nicely trimmed,CHAP. XIV.] CURRIES, POTTED MEATS, &C. 355 closely wrapped in coarse paste, and baked very tender.* When it comes from the oven, remove the crust and rind, and when the ham is perfectly cold, take for each pound of the lean, which should be weighed after every morsel of skin and fibre has been carefully removed, six ounces of cold roast veal, prepared with equal nicety. Mince these quite fine with an exceedingly sharp knife, taking care to cut through the meat, and not to tear the fibre, as on this much of the excellence of the preparation depends. Next put it into a large stone or marble mortar, and pound it to the smoothest paste with eight ounces of fresh butter, which must be added by degrees. When three parts beaten,' strew over it a teaspoonful of freshly-pounded mace, half a large, or the whole of a small nutmeg grated, and the third of a teaspoonful of cayenne well mixed together. It is better to limit the spice to this quantity in the first instance, and to increase afterwards either of the three kinds, to the taste of the parties to whom the meat is to be served.t We do not find half a teaspoonful of cayenne, and nearly two teaspoonsful of mace, more than is generally approved. After the spice is added, keep the meat often turned from the sides to the middle of the mortar, that it may be seasoned equally in every part. When perfectly pounded, press it into small potting-pans, and pour clarified butter| over the top. If kept in a cool and dry place, this meat will remain good for a fortnight, or more. Lean of ham, 1 lb. ; lean of roast veal, 6 ozs.; fresh butter, 8 ozs. ; mace, from 1 to 2 teaspoonsful; | large nutmeg ; cayenne, i to J teaspoonful. Obs.—The roast veal is ordered in this receipt because the ham alone is generally too salt; for the same reason butter, fresh-taken from the churn, or that which is but slightly salted and quite new, should be used for it in * See Baked Ham, Chapter XI. page 298. t Spice,it must be observed, varies so very greatly in its quality that discretion is always necessary in using it. t 'this should never be poured hot on the meat: it should be less than milk-warm when added to it.356 fCHAP. XIV. MODERN COOKERY. preference to its own fat. When there is no readv- dressed veal in the house, the best part of the neck roasted or stewed will supply the requisite quantity. The remains of a cold boiled ham will answer quite well for potting, even when a little dry. POTTED CHICKEN, PARTRIDGE, OR PHEASANT. Roast the birds as for table, but let them be tho- roughly done, for if the gravy be left in, the meat will not keep half so well. Raise the flesh of the breast, wings, and merrythought quite clear from the bones, take oil* the skin, mince, and then pound it very smoothly, with about one-third of its weight of fresh butter, or something less, if the meat should appear of a proper consistence without the full quantity; season it with salt, mace, and cayenne only, and add these in small portions until the meat is rather highly flavoured with both the last; proceed with it as with other potted meats. POTTED OX-TONGUE. Boil tender, an unsmoked tongue of good flavour, and the following day cut from it the quantity desired for potting, or take for this purpose, the remains of one which has already been served at table. Trim off the skin and rind, weigh the meat, mince it very small, then pound it as fine as possible with four ounces of butter to each pound of tongue, a small teaspoonful of mace, half as much of nutmeg and cloves, and a tole- rably high seasoning of cayenne. After the spices are well beaten with the meat, taste it, and add more if required. A few ounces of any well-roasted meat mixed with the tongue will give it firmness, in which it is apt to be deficient. The breasts of turkeys, fowls, partridges, or pheasants may be used for the purpose with good effect. Tongue, 1 lb.; butter, 4 ozs.; mace, 1 teaspoonful; nutmeg and cloves each, J teaspoonful; cayenne, 5 to 10 grains.357 CHAP. XIV.] CURRIES, POTTED MEATS, &C. POTTED ANCHOVIES. Scrape the anchovies very clean, raise the flesh from the bones, and pound it to a perfect paste in a Wedg- wood or marble mortar; then with the back of a wooden spoon press it through a hair-sieve reversed. Next weigh the anchovies, and pound them again with double their weight of the freshest butter that can be procured, a high seasoning of mace and cayenne, and a small quantity of finely-grated nutmeg ; set the mix- ture by in a cool place for three or four hours to harden it before it is put into the potting pans. If butter be poured over, it must be only lukewarm; but the an- chovies will keep well for two or three weeks without. A little rose-pink may be added to improve the colour, but it must be used sparingly, or it will impart a bitter taste. The quantity of butter can be increased or diminished in proportion as it is wished that the flavour of the anchovies should prevail. Anchovies pounded, 3 ozs.; butter, 6 ozs. ; mace, third of teaspoonful; half as much cayenne; little nutmeg. LOBSTER* BUTTER. Pound to the smoothest paste the coral of one or two fine lobsters, mix with it about a third of its volume of fresh butter, and the same proportion of spices as are given in the preceding receipt. Let the whole be thoroughly blended ; set it by for a while in a cool place and pot it, or make it up into small pats, and serve them with curled parsley round the dish, or with any light foliage that will corftrast well witli their brilliant colour. The flesh, of the lobster may be cut fine with a very sharp knife, and pounded with the coral. POTTED SHRIMPS. {Delicious.) Let the fish be quite freshly boiled, shell them quickly, and just before they are put into the mortar, chop themMODERN COOKERY. 358 [CHAP. XV. a little with a very sharp knife; pound them perfectly with a small quantity of fresh butter, mace, and cayenne. Shrimps (unshelled), 2 quarts; butter, 2 to 4 ozs.; mace, 1 small saltspoonful; cayenne, third as much. POTTED MUSHROOMS. The receipt for these, which we can recommend to the reader, will be found in the next Chapter. CHAPTER XY. Artichokes a la Pteine. VEGETABLES. The quality of vegetables depends much both on the soil in which they are grown, and on the degree of care bestowed upon their culture; but if produced in ever so great perfection their excellence will be entirely destroyed if they be badly cooked. With the exception of artichokes, which are said to be improved by two or three days’ keeping, all the summer varieties should be dressed before their first freshness has in any degree passed off (for their flavour is never so fine as within a few hours of their being cut or gathered); but when this cannot be done, pre- caution §hould be taken to prevent their withering. The stalk-ends of asparagus, cucumbers, and vegetable- marrow should be placed in from one to two inches of cold water; and all other kinds should be spread on a cool brick floor. When this has been neglected, they must be thrown into cold water for some time before they are boiled to recover them, though they will prove even then but very inferior eating. Vegetables when not sufficiently cooked are knownCHAP. XV.] VEGETABLES. 359 to be so exceedingly unwholesome and indigestible, that the custom of serving them crisp, which means, in reality, only half-boiled, should be altogether disre- garded when health is considered of more consequence than fashion; but they should not be allowed to remain in the water after they are quite done, or both their nutritive properties and their flavour will be lost, and their good appearance destroyed. Care should be taken to drain them thoroughly in a warm strainer, and to serve them very hot, with well-made sauces, if with any. Only dried peas or beans, Jerusalem artichokes, and potatoes, are put at first into cold water. All others require plenty of fast-boiling water, which should be ready salted and skimmed before they are thrown into it. TO CLEAR VEGETABLES FROM INSECTS. Lay them for half an hour or more into a pan of strong brine, with the stalk-ends uppermost; this will destroy the small snails and other insects which cluster in the leaves, and they will fall out and sink to the bottom. A pound and a half of salt to the gallon of water will answer for this purpose, and if strained daily it will last for some time. TO BOIL VEGETABLES GREEN. After they have been properly prepared and washed, throw them into plenty of boiling water which has been salted and well skimmed; and keep them uncovered and boiling fast untile they are done, taking every pre- caution against their being smoked. Should the water be very hard, a bit of soda the size of a hazel-nut, or a small half-teaspoonful of carbonate of soda, may be added with the salt, for every two quarts, and will greatly improve the colour of the vegetables; but if used in undue proportions it will injure them; green peas especially will be quickly reduced to a mash if boiled with too large a quantity. Water, 1 gallon; salt, 2 ozs.; soda, 5 to J oz.; or carbonate of soda, 1 teaspoonful.MODERN COOKERY. 360 [CHAP. XV. TO BOIL POTATOES. (A genuine Irish Receipt.) Potatoes, to boil well together, should be all of the same sort, and as nearly equal in size as may be. Wash off the mould, and scrub them very clean with a hard brush, but neither scoop nor apply a knife to them in any way, even to clear the eyes.* Rinse them well, and arrange them compactly in a saucepan, so that they may not lie loose in the wTater, and that a small quantity may suffice to cover them. Pour this in cold, and when it boils, throw in about a large teaspoonful of salt to the quart, and simmer the potatoes till they are nearly done, but for the last two or three minutes, let them boil rapidly. When they are tender quite through, which may be known by probing them with a fork, pour all the water from them immediately, lift the lid of the saucepan to allow the steam to escape, and place them on a trevet, high over the fire, or by the side of it, until the moisture has entirely evaporated; then peel, and send them to table as quickly as possible, either in a hot napkin, or in a dish, of which the cover is so placed, that the steam can pass off. There should be no delay in serving them after they are once taken from the fire. Irish families usually prefer them served in their skins. Some kinds will be done in twenty minutes, others in little less than three quarters of an hour. We are informed that “ the best potatoes are those which average from five to six to the pound, with few eyes, but those pretty deep, and equally distributed over the surface.” We cannot ourselves vouch for the correctness of the assertion, but we think it may be relied on. 20 minutes to j hour, or more. Obs.—The water in whicli they are boiled, should barely cover the potatoes. * “ Because/’ in the words of our clever Irish correspondent, “• the water through these parts is then admitted into the very heart of the vegetable ; and the latent heat, after cooking, is not sufficient to throw it off: this renders the potatoes very unwholesome.’ ’CHAP. XV.] 361 VEGETABLES. TO BOIL POTATOES. {The Lancashire way.) Pare the potatoes, cover them with cold water, and boil them slowly until they are quite tender, but watch them carefully, that they may not be overdone; drain off the water entirely, strew some salt over them, leave the saucepan uncovered by the side of the fire, and shake it forcibly every minute or two, until the whole of the potatoes appear dry and floury. Lancashire cooks dress the vegetable in this way to perfection, but it is far from an economical mode, as a large portion of the potatoe adheres to the saucepan ; it has, however, many admirers. TO BOIL NEW POTATOES. These are never good unless freshly dug. Take them of equal size, and rub off the skins with a brush, or a very coarse cloth, wash them clean, and put them, without salt, into boiling, or at least, quite hot water ; boil them softly, and when they are tender enough to serve, pour off the water entirely, strew some fine salt over the potatoes, give them a shake, and let them stand by the fire in the saucepan for a minute, then dish, and serve them immediately. Some cooks throw in a small slice of fresh butter, with the salt, and toss them gently in after it is dissolved. This is a good mode, but the more usual one is to send melted butter to table with them, or to pour white sauce over them when they are very young, and served early in the season, as a side or corner dish. Very small, 10 to 15 minutes; moderate-sized 15 to 20 minutes. NEW POTATOES IN BUTTER. Rub off the skins, wash the potatoes well, and wipe them dry; put them with three ounces of good butter, for a small dish, and with four ounces, or more, for a large one, into a well-tinned stewpan or saucepan, and simmer them over a gentle fire for about half an hour.362 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XV. Keep them well-shaken or tossed, that they may be equally done, and throw in some salt when they begin to stew. This is a good mode of dressing them when they are very young and watery. TO BOIL POTATOES. (Captain Katers Receipt.) Wash, wipe, and pare the potatoes, cover them witli cold water, and boil them gently till they are done, pour off the water, and sprinkle a little fine salt over them ; then take each potatoe separately with a spoon, and lay it into a clean warm cloth, twist, this so as to press all the moisture from the vegetable, and render it quite round; turn it carefully into a dish placed before the fire, throw a cloth over, and when all are done, send them to table quickly. Potatoes dressed in this way, are mashed without the slightest trouble; it is also by far the best method of preparing them for puddings or cakes. TO ROAST, OR BAKE POTATOES. Scrub, and wash exceedingly clean, some potatoes nearly assorted in size ; wipe them very dry, and roast them in a Dutch oven before the fire, placing them at a distance from it, and keeping them often turned; or arrange them in a coarse dish, and bake them in a moderate oven. Dish them neatly in a napkin, and send them very hot to table; serve cold butter with them. ]f to upwards of 2 hours. SCOOPED POTATOES. Wash and wipe some large potatoes of a firm kind, and with a small scoop adapted to the purpose,* form as many diminutive ones * This may be procured of Mr. Livermore, 30, Oxford Street, to whom we have already referred.CHAP. XV.] VEGETABLES. 363 as will fill a dish ; cover them with cold water, and when they have boiled very gently for five minutes, pour it off, and put more cold water to them; after they have simmered a second time for five minutes, drain the water quite away, and let them steam by the side of the fire from four to five minutes longer. Dish them carefully, pour white sauce over them, and serve them with the second course. Old potatoes thus prepared, have often been made to pass for new ones, at the best tables, at the season in which the fresh vegetable is dearest. The time required to boil them will of course vary with their quality: we give the method which we have found very successful. FRIED POTATOES. After having washed them, wipe and pare some raw potatoes, cut them in slices of equal thickness, or into thin shavings, and throw them into plenty of boiling butter, or very pure clarified dripping. Fry them of a fine light brown, and very crisp; lift them out with a skim- mer, drain them on a soft warm cloth, dish them v^ry hot, and sprinkle fine salt over them. This is an ad- mirable way of dressing potatoes, very common on the Continent, but less so in England than it deserves to be. When pared round and round to a corkskrew form, in ribbons or shavings of equal width, and served dry and well-fried, lightly piled in a dish, they make a handsome appearance and are excellent eating. We have known them served in this country with a slight sprinkling of cayenne. If sliced they should be some- thing less than a quarter-inch thick. MASHED POTATOES. Boil them perfectly tender quite through, pour off the water, and steam them very dry by the directions already given in the receipt of page 360; peel them quickly, take out every speck, and while they are still hot press the potatoes through an earthen cullender, or bruise them to a smooth mash with a strong wooden fork or spoon, butMODERN COOKERY. 364 [CHAP. XV. never pound them in a mortar, as that will reduce them to a close heavy paste. Let them be entirely free from lumps, for nothing can be more indicative of carelessness or want of skill on the part of the cook, than mashed potatoes sent to table full of these. Melt in a clean saucepan a slice of good butter with a few spoonsful of milk, or, better still, of cream; put in the potatoes after having sprinkled some fine salt upon them, and stir the whole over a gentle fire, with a wooden spoon, until the ingredients are well mixed, and the whole is very hot. It may then, be served directly ; or heaped high in a dish, left rough on the surface, and browned before the fire; or it may be pressed into a well buttered mould of handsome form, which has been strewed with the finest bread-crumbs, and shaken free of the loose ones, then turned out, and browned in a Dutch, or common oven. More or less liquid will be required to moisten suffi- ciently potatoes of various sorts. Potatoes, mashed, 2 lbs.; salt, 1 teaspoonful; butter, 1 to 2 ozs.; milk or cream, J pint. Ohs.—Mashed potatoes are often moulded with a cup, and then equally browned; any other shape will answer the purpose as well, and many are of better appearance. ENGLISH POTATOE BALLS. Boil some floury potatoes very dry, mash them as smoothly as possible, season them well with salt and white pepper; warm them with about an ounce of butter to the pound, or rather more if it will not render them too moist; a few spoonsful of good cream may be added, but they must be boiled very dry after it is stirred to them. Let the mixture cool a little, roll it into balls, sprinkle over them vermicelli crushed slightly with the hand, and fry them a fine light brown. They may be dished round a shape of plain mashed potatoes, or piled on a napkin by themselves. They may like- wise be rolled in egg and fine bread-crumbs instead of in the vermicelli, or in rice-flour, which answers very well for them.365 VEGETABLES. CHAP. XV.] POTATOE BOULETTES. {Good.) Boil some good potatoes as dry as possible, or, let them be prepared by Captain Kater’s receipt; mash a pound of them very smoothly, and mix with them while they are still warm, two ounces of fresh butter, a tea- spoonful of salt, a little nutmeg, the beaten and strained yolks of four eggs, and last of all the whites, thoroughly whisked. Mould with and drop the mixture from a teaspoon into a small pan of boiling butter, or very pure lard, and fry the boulettes for five minutes over a mode- rate fire : they should be of a fine pale brown, and very light. Drain them well and dish them on a hot napkin. Potatoes, 1 lb.; butter, 2 ozs.; salt, 1 teaspoonful; eggs 4 : 5 minutes. POTATOE RISSOLES. {French.) Mash and season the potatoes with salt, and white pepper or cayenne, and mix with them plenty of minced parsley and a small quantity of green onions, or escha- lots; add sufficient yolks of egg to bind the mixture together, roll it into small balls, and fry them in plenty of lard or butter over a moderate fire, or they will be too much browned before they are done through. Ham, or any other kind of meat finely minced, may be substi- tuted for the herbs, or added to them. POTATOES A LA MAITRE d’hOTEL. Boil in the usual manner some potatoes of a firm kind, peel, and let them cool; cut them equally into quarter-inch slices. Dissolve in a very clean stewpan or saucepan from two to four ounces of good butter, stir to it a small dessertspoonful of flour, and shake the pan over the fire for two or three minutes; add by slow degrees a small cup of boiling water, then some pepper, salt, and a tablespoonful of minced parsley; put in the potatoes, and toss them gently over a clear366 [chap. XY. MODERN COOKERY. fire until they are quite hot, and the sauce adheres well to them ; at the instant of serving, add a dessertspoon- ful of strained lemon-juice. Pale veal gravy may be substituted for the water; and the potatoes after being thickly sliced, may be quickly cut of the same size with a small round cutter. POTATOES A LA CREME. Prepare the potatoes as above, and toss them gently in a quarter-pint or more of thick white sauce or of common bechamel, with or without the addition of the minced parsley. TO BOIL SEA-KALE. Wash, trim, and tie the kale in bunches, and throw it into plenty of boiling water with some salt in it. When it is perfectly tender, lift it out, drain it well from the water, and send it to table with good, melted butter. When fashion is not particularly regarded we recommend its being served upon a toast like asparagus. About twenty minutes will boil it, rather less for per- sons who like it crisp. 18 to 20 minutes. SEA-KALE STEWED IN GRAVY. Boil the kale for ten minutes in salt and water; drain it well, and put it into a saucepan with as much good brown gravy as will nearly cover it; stew it gently for ten minutes or until it is tender, and send it to table in the gravy very hot. Another excellent mode of serving this vegetable is, to boil it in salt and water, and to pour over it plenty of rich white sauce after it is dished. SPINACH. (French Receipt.) Pick the spinach leaf by leaf from the stems, and wash it in an abundance of spring water, changing it several times; then shake it in a dry cloth held by theCHAP. XV.] VEGETABLES. 367 four corners, or drain it on a large sieve. Throw it into sufficient well-salted boiling water to allow it to float freely, and keep it pressed down with a skimmer that it may be equally done. When quite young it will be tender in from eight to ten minutes, but to ascertain if it be so, take a leaf and squeeze it between the fingers. If to be dressed in the French mode, drain, and then throw it directly into plenty of fresh water, and when it is cool form it into balls and press the moisture thoroughly from it with the hands. Next, chop it extremely fine upon a clean trencher; put two ounces (for a large dish) of butter into a stewpan or bright thick saucepan, lay the spinach on it, and keep it stirred over a gentle fire for ten minutes, or until it appears dry; dredge in a spoonful of flour, and turn the spinach as it is added: pour to it gradually, a few spoonsful of very rich veal-gravy, or, if preferred, of good boiling cream (with the last of these a dessert- spoonful or more of pounded sugar may be added for a second-course dish, when the true French mode of dressing the vegetable is liked). Stew the whole briskly till the liquid is well absorbed ; dish, and serve the spinach very hot, with small, pale fried sippets round it, or with leaves of puff paste fresh from the oven, or well dried after having been fried. For ornament, the sippets may be fancifully shaped with a tin cutter. A proper seasoning of salt must not be omitted in this or any other preparation of the spinach. SPINACH, A L’ANGLAISE. (Or, English fashion.) Boil the spinach as already directed, and after it has been well squeezed and chopped, stir it over a moderate fire until it is very dry ; moisten it with as much thick rich gravy as will flavour it well, and turn and stew it quite fast until it is again very dry; then press it into a hot mould of handsome form, turn it into a dish and serve it quickly. Two or three ounces of fresh butter may be laid into the saucepan with the[[CHAP. XV. 368 MODERN COOKERY. spinacli at first, as a substitute for the gravy. When a perforated tin shape, ordinarily used for moulding spinach, is not at hand one of earthenware, slightly but- tered, will serve nearly as well. SPINACH. (Common English mode.) Boil the spinach very green in plenty of water, drain, and then press the moisture from it between two trenchers ; chop it fine, put it into a clean sauce- pan, with a slice of fresh butter, and stir the whole till well-mixed and very hot. Smooth it in a dish, mark it in dice, and send it quickly to table. (Another common English Receipt for Spinach.) Take it leaf bv leaf from the stalks, and be very careful to clear it from any weeds that may be amongst it, and to free it by copious and repeated washings from every particle of grit. Put it into a large well- tinned stewpan or saucepan, with the water only that hangs about it; throw in a small spoonful of salt, and keep it constantly pressed down with a wooden spoon, and turned often for about a quarter of an hour, or until it is perfectly tender. Drain off the superfluous moisture, chop the spinach quickly on a hot trencher; dish, and serve it immediately. Fried sippets of bread should always be served round this vegetable, unless it be prepared for an invalid. BOILED TURNIP-RADISHES. These should be freshly drawn, young and white. Wash and trim them neatly, leaving on two or three of the small inner-leaves of the top. Boil them in plenty of salted water from twenty to thirty minutes: as soon as they are tender send them to table well- drained, with melted butter or white sauce. Common radishes when young, tied in bunches, and boiled from eighteen to twenty-five minutes, then served on a toast like asparagus, are very good.369 CHAP. XV.] VEGETABLES. BOILED LEEKS. Trim off the coarser leaves from some young leeks, cut them in equal lengths, tie them in small bundles, and boil them in plenty of water which has been pre- viously salted and skimmed; serve them on a toast, and send melted butter to table with them. 20 to 25 minutes. STEWED LETTUCES. Strip off the outer leaves, and cut away the stalks ; wash the lettuces with exceeding nicety, and throw them into water salted as for all green vegetables. When they are quite tender, which will be in from twenty to thirty minutes, according to their age, lift them out, and press the water thoroughly from them; chop them a little, and heat them in a clean saucepan with a seasoning of pepper and salt, and a small slice of butter ; then dredge in a little flour and stir them well; add next a small cup of broth or gravy, boil them quickly until they are tolerably dry, then stir in a little pale vinegar or lemon-juice, and serve them as hot as possible, with fried sippets round them. TO BOIL ASPARAGUS. With a sharp knife scrape the stems of the aspara- gus lightly, but very clean, from within one to two inches of the green tender points, throw them into cold water as they are done, and when all are ready, tie them in bunches of equal size; cut the large ends evenly, that the asparagus may be all of the same length, and put it into plenty of boiling water pre- pared by the directions of page 359. Cut a round of bread quite half an inch thick/and after having pared off the crust, toast it a delicate brown on both sides. When the stalks of the asparagus are tender, lift it out directly, or it will lose both its colour and its flavour, and will also be liable to break ; dip the toast quickly into the water in which it was boiled, and B B[chap. XT, 370 MODERN COOKERY. dish the vegetable upon it, with the points meeting in the centre. Send rich melted butter to table with it. In France a small quantity of vinegar is stirred into the sauce before it is served ; and many persons like the addition. Asparagus may be preserved for a day or two sufficiently fresh for use, by keeping the stalks immersed in an inch depth of cold water ; but it is never so good as when dressed directly it is cut, or within a few hours after. 20 to 25 minutes. Ohs.—Abroad, boiled asparagus is very frequently served cold, and eaten with oil and vinegar, or a sauce Mayonnaise. ASPARAGUS POINTS DRESSED LIKE PEAS. This is a convenient mode of dressing asparagus, when it is too small and green to make a good appear- ance plainly boiled. Cut the points so far only as they are perfectly tender, in bits of equal size, not more than the third of an inch in length, wash them very clean, and throw them into plenty of boiling water, with the usual quantity of salt and a morsel of soda. When they are tolerably tender, which will be in from ten to twelve minutes, drain them well, and spread them on a clean cloth ; fold it over them, wipe them gently, and when they are quite dry put them into a clean stewpan with a good slice of butter, which should be just dissolved before the asparagus is added ; stew them in this over a brisk tire, shaking them often, for eight or ten minutes; dredge in about a small teaspoonful of flour, and add half that quantity of white sugar; then pour in boiling water to nearly cover the asparagus, and boil it rapidly until but little liquid remains; stir in the beaten yolks of two eggs, heap the asparagus high in a dish, and serve it very hot. The sauce should adhere entirely to the vege- table as in green peas a la Francaise. TO BOIL GREEN PEAS. To be eaten in perfection these should be young, veryCHAP.

Wash, and drain the peas in a cullender, put them into plenty of fast-boiling water, salted by the directions of page 359, keep the pan uncovered, and let them boil rapidly till they are tender; drain them well, dish them quickly, and serve them very hot, with good melted butter in a tureen ; or put a slice of fresh butter into the midst of the peas, heap them well over it in the centre of the dish, and let it dissolve before they are disturbed. Never, on any account, boil or mix mint with them unless it be expressly ordered, as it is particularly dis- tasteful to many persons. It should be served in small heaps round them if at all. 15 to 25 minutes, or more if old. GREEN PEAS A LA FRAN^AISE ; OR, FRENCH FASHION. Throw a quart of young and freshly-shelled peas into plenty of spring-water with a couple of ounces of butter, and with the hand, work them together until the butter adheres well to the peas; lift them out, and drain them in a cullender; put them into a stewpan or thick saucepan without any water, and let them remain over a gentle fire, and be stirred occasionally for twenty minutes from the time of their first beginning to simmer; then pour to them as much boiling water as will cover them just; throw in a small quantity of salt, and keep them boiling quickly for forty minutes ; stir well amongst them a small lump of sugar which has been dipped quickly into water, and a thickening of about half an ounce of butter very smoothly mixed with a teaspoonful of flour; shake them over the fire for a couple of minutes, and serve them directly heaped high in a very hot dish: there will be no sauce except that which adheres to the peas if they be properly managed.

When the beans are very small and young, merely take off the ends and stalks, and drop them into plenty of spring-water as they are done ; when all are ready, wash and drain them well, throw them into a large saucepan of fast-boiling water, salted as usual, (see page 359) and when they are quite tender, which will be in from twelve to eighteen minutes, pour them into a cullender, shake the water from them, dish, and send them quickly to table with good melted butter in a tureen. When from half to two parts grown, cut the beans obliquely into a lozenge form, or, when a less modern fashion is preferred, split them lengthwise into delicate strips, and then cut them once across: the strings should be drawn off with the tops and stalks. No mode of dressing it can render this vegetable good when it is old, but if the sides be pared off, the beansCHAP. XV.] VEGETABLES. 373 cut thin, and boiled tender with rather more than the ordinary proportion of soda, they will be of excellent colour, and tolerably eatable. FRENCH BEANS A LA FRAN^AISE. Boil, and drain them thoroughly; then put them into a clean stewpan, or well-tinned iron saucepan, and shake them over the fire until they are very dry and hot; add to them from two to four ounces of fresh butter cut into small bits, some white pepper, a little salt, and the juice of half a lemon, toss them gently for a few minutes over a clear fire, and serve them very hot. Should the butter turn to oil, a spoonful or two of veal-gravy or boiling water must be added. An excellent Receipt for French beans a la Frangaise. Prepare as many young and freshly-gathered beans as will serve for a large dish, boil them tender, and drain the water well from them. Melt a couple of ounces of fresh butter in a clean saucepan, and stir smoothly to it a small dessertspoonful of flour; keep these well shaken, and gently simmered until they are lightly browned, add salt and pepper, and pour to them, by degrees, a small cupful of good veal gravy (or, in lieu of this, of sweet rich cream), toss the beans in the sauce till they are as hot as possible; stir quickly in, as they are taken from the fire, the beaten yolks of two fresh eggs, and a little lemon-juice, and serve them without delay. The eggs and lemon are sometimes omitted, and a tablespoonful of minced parsley is added to the butter and flour, but this, we think, is scarcely an improvement. Beans, 1 to 2 quarts: boiled 15 to 20 minutes. Butter, 2 ozs.; flour, 1 dessertspoonful; salt and pepper; veal-gravy, small cupful; yolks of eggs, 2; lemon- juice, a dessertspoonful. TO BOIL WINDSOR BEANS. When young, freshly gathered, and well dressed, these beans, even with many persons accustomed to a luxu-[CHAP. XY. 37 4 MODERN COOKERY. rious table, are a favourite accompaniment to a dish of streaked bacon, or delicate pickled pork. Shell them only just before they are wanted, wash, drain, and throw them into boiling water, salted as for peas. When they are quite tender, pour them into a hot cul- lender, drain them thoroughly, and send them to table quickly, with a tureen of parsley and butter, or with plain melted butter, when it is preferred. A boiled cheek of bacon, trimmed free of any blackened parts, may be dished over the beans, upon occasion. 20 to 30 minutes ; less, when very young. Obs.—When the skin of the beans appears wrinkled, they will generally be found sufficiently tender to serve, but they should be tasted to ascertain that they are so. DRESSED CUCUMBERS. Pare and slice them very thin, strew a little fine salt over them, and when they have stood a few minutes, drain off the water, by raising one side of the dish, and letting it flow to the other; pour it away, strew more salt, and a moderate seasoning of pepper on them, add two or three tablespoonsful of the purest salad-oil, and turn the cucumbers well, that the whole may receive a portion of it; then pour over them from one to three dessertspoonsful of Chili-vinegar, and a little common, should it be needed; turn them into a clean dish and serve them. Obs.—If very young, cucumbers are usually dressed without being pared, but the tough rind of full-grown ones being extremely indigestible, should be avoided. The vegetable, though apt to disagree with persons of delicate habit, when sauced in the common English mode, with salt, pepper, and vinegar only, may often be eaten by them with impunity when dressed with plenty of oil. It is difficult to obtain this perfectly fresh and pure here ; and hence, perhaps, arises in part the preju- dice which, amongst us, is so often found to exist against the use of this most wholesome condiment.37 5 CHAP. XV.] VEGETABLES. MANDRANG, OR MANDRAM. ( West Indian Receipt.) Chop together very small, two moderate-sized cu- cumbers, with half the quantity of mild onion ; add the juice of a lemon, a saltspoonful or more of salt, a third as much of cayenne, and one or two glasses of Madeira, or of any other dry white wine. This pre- paration is to be served with any kind of roast meat. Another Receipt for Mandram. Take three or four cucumbers, so young as not to require paring; score the ends well, that when they are sliced they may fall into small bits; add plenty of young onions, cut fine, the juice of half a lemon, a glass of sherry or Madeira, and a dessertspoonful of Chili- vinegar. DRESSED CUCUMBERS. (Authors Receipt.) Cut into lengths of an inch or rather more, one or two freshly-gathered cucumbers, take off the rind, and then pare them round and round into thin ribbons, until the watery part is reached this is to be thrown aside. When all are done, sprinkle them with cayenne and fine salt, and leave them to drain a little; then arrange them lightly in a clean dish, and sauce them with very fine oil, well mixed with Chili-vinegar, or with equal parts of Chili and of common vinegar. Cucumbers, 2 or 3 ; salt, 1 to 2 saltspoonsful; little cayenne; oil, 6 to 8 tablespoonsful; Chili-vinegar, or equal parts of this and common vinegar, 2 to 4 table- spoonsful. Obs.—When the flavour of eschalots is much liked, a teaspoonful or more of the vinegar in which they have been steeped or pickled may be added to this dish. STEWED CUCUMBERS. (.English mode.) Pare, and split into quarters, four or five full-grown376 [CHAP. XV. MODERN COOKERY. but still young cucumbers; take out the seeds and cut each part in two; sprinkle them with white pepper or cayenne, flour and fry them lightly in a little butter, lift them from the pan, drain them on a sieve, then lay them into as much good brown gravy as will nearly cover them, and stew them gently from twenty-five to thirty minutes, or until they are quite tender. Should the gravy require to be thickened or flavoured, dish the cucumbers, and keep them hot while a little flour and butter, or any other of the usual ingredients, is stirred into it. Some persons like a small portion of lemon- juice, or of Chili-vinegar added to the sauce; cucumber- vinegar might be substituted for these with very good effect, as the vegetable loses much of its fine and peculiar flavour when cooked. 25 to 30 minutes. Obs.— The cucumbers may be left in entire lengths, thrown into well-salted boiling water, and simmered for ten minutes, then thoroughly drained upon the back of a sieve, and afterwards stewed very quickly till tender in some highly flavoured brown gravy, or in the Spanish sauce of page 105. CUCUMBERS A LA POULETTE. The cucumbers for this dish may be pared and sliced very thin, or quartered, freed from the seeds, and cut into half-inch lengths; in either case they should be steeped in a little vinegar and sprinkled with salt for half an hour before they are dressed. Drain, and then press them dry in a soft cloth; flour them well, put a slice of butter into a stewpan or saucepan bright in the inside, and when it begins to boil throw in the cucum- bers, and shake them over a gentle fire for ten minutes, but be careful to prevent their taking the slightest colour; pour to them gradually as much strong, but very pale, veal-stock or gravy as will nearly cover them; when it boils skim off the fat entirely; add salt and white pepper, if needed, and when the cucumbers are tender quite, strew in a large teaspoonful of finely minced377 CHAP. XV.] VEGETABLES. parsley, and thicken the sauce with the yolks of eggs. French cooks add the flour when the vegetable has stewed in the butter, instead of dredging it upon them at first, and this is perhaps the better method. CUCUMBERS A LA CREME. Boil them tolerably tender in salt and water, drain them well, then stew them for a few minutes in a thick bechamel, and serve them in it. FRIED CUCUMBERS TO SERVE IN COMMON HASHES AND MINCES. If very young they need not be pared, but otherwise, take off the rind, slice, and dredge them lightly with pepper and flour, but put no salt at first; throw them into very hot butter or clarified dripping, or they will not brown; when they are nearly done sprinkle some salt amongst them, and as soon as they are quite tender, lift them out with a slice, drain them well, and place them lightly over the hash or mince. A small portion of onion may be fried with them when it is liked. MELON. This in France and in other parts of the Continent is served and eaten with the bouilli (or beef boiled tender in the soup-pot), with a seasoning of salt and pepper only; but the fruit is there far more abundant, and of infinitely finer growth than with us, and requires so little care, comparatively, that it is planted in many places in the open fields, where it flourishes admirably. SALAD. The herbs and vegetables for a salad cannot be too freshly gathered ; they should be carefully cleared from insects and washed with scrupulous nicety; they are better when not prepared till near the time of sending them to table, and should not be sauced till the instant before they are served. Tender lettuces, of which the outer leaves should be stripped away, mustard and cress,378 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XY. young radishes, and occasionally chives or small green onions (when the taste of a party is in favour of these last) are the usual ingredients of summer salads. Half- grown cucumbers sliced thin, and mixed in with them, are a favourite addition with many persons. In Eng- land it is customary to cut the lettuces extremely fine; the French, who object to the flavour of the knife, which they fancy this mode imparts, break them small instead. Young celery alone, sliced and dressed with a rich salad mixture (see page 133) is excellent: it is still in some families served thus always with roast pheasants. Beet-root, baked or boiled, blanched endive, small salad-herbs which are easily raised at any time of the year, celery, and hardy lettuces, with any ready-dressed vegetable will supply salads through the winter. Cu- cumber-vinegar is an agreeable addition to these. FRENCH SALAD. In winter this is made principally of beautifully- blanched endive, washed delicately clean and broken into small branches with the fingers, then taken from the water and shaken dry in a basket kept for the pur- pose, or in a fine cloth; then arranged in the salad-bowl, and strewed with herbs (tarragon generally, when in season) minced small: the dressing is not added until just before the salad is eaten. For this, see page 134. In summer, young lettuces are substituted for the en- dive, and intermixed with a variety of herbs, some of which are not generally cultivated in England. SUFFOLK SALAD. Fill a salad bowl from half to three parts full with very tender lettuces shred small, and minced lean of ham, and hard-boiled eggs, or their yolks only, also minced, placed in alternate layers; dress the mixture with English salad-sauce, but do not pour it into the bowl until the instant of serving. A portion of cold chicken, cut in thin slices about the size of a shilling, may be added when convenient.379 VEGETABLES. CHAP. XV.] YORKSHIRE PLOUGHMANS SALAD. Mix treacle and vinegar, in the proportion of one tablespoonful of the first to two of the latter; add a little black pepper, and eat the sauce with lettuces shred small (with an intermixture of young onions when they are liked). This, though certainly not a very refined order of salad, is scarcely so unpalatable as such ingre- dients would seem to promise. DES CERNEAUX, OR WALNUT SALAD. This is a common summer salad in France, where there is generally an abundant growth of walnuts, though it is not, we believe, much served in England. Take the fruit when a pin will pierce it easily, and pare it down to the kernel; put it into a salad bowl with either a French or an English dressing, and toss the whole gently before it is served. TO BOIL CAULIFLOWERS. Trim off the outside leaves, and cut the stems quite close to the cauliflowers; let them lie for an hour in plenty of cold water, with a handful of salt in it, to draw out any insects that may be amongst them ; then wash them very thoroughly, and examine them well, to be assured that no snail is left in any part of them, throw them into a large pan of boiling water, salted as for asparagus, and quite cleared from scum; for this, if not removed, will adhere to the cauliflowers and spoil their appear- ance. When the stalks are tender lift them out, dish them neatly, and send good melted butter to table with them. 20 to 30 minutes. CAULIFLOWERS. (French Receipt.) Cut the cauliflowers into small handsome tufts, and boil them until three parts done, drain them well, toss them a moment in some thick melted butter or white380 [CHAP. XV. MODERN COOKERY. sauce, and set them by to cool. When they are quite cold, dip them separately into batter (see page 154), fry them of a light brown, arrange them neatly in a dish, and serve them very hot. CAULIFLOWERS WITH PARMESAN CHEESE. Take all the green leaves from two or three fine white cauliflowers, and cut the stalks off very closely, so that they will stand upright in the dish in which they are served; boil them tender,* drain them well, and dish them, so as to give the whole the appearance of one cauliflower, pour a little good white sauce equally over the tops, and on this strew grated Parmesan cheese, drop over it a little clarified butter, add another layer of cheese, and cover the whole with the finest bread- crumbs ; moisten these with more clarified butter, and brown them with a salamander, or set the dish into the oven, to give them colour; pour white sauce round the cauliflowers, and send them very hot to table. CAULIFLOWERS A LA FRANQAISE. Strip away all the green leaves, and divide each cauliflower into three or four parts, trimming the stalks quite close; put them, with the heads downwards, into a stewpan which will just hold them, half filled with boiling water, into which an ounce of good butter and some salt have previously been thrown; so soon as they are quite tender, drain the water from them, place a dish over the stewpan and turn it gently upside down ; arrange the vegetables neatly in the form of one large cauliflower and cover it with good melted butter, into which a little lemon-juice has been stirred. 12 to 18 minutes. BROCCOLI. This is boiled, and served in the same manner as cauliflowers when the heads are large; the stems of the branching broccoli are peeled, and the vegetable, tied in * Not too much so, or they will break in the dressing.CHAP. XV.] 381 VEGETABLES. bunches, is dressed and served, like asparagus, upon a toast. 10 to 20 minutes. TO BOIL ARTICHOKES. After they have been soaked and well washed, cut off the stems quite close, trim away a few of the lower leaves, and clip the points of all; throw the artichokes into plenty of fast-boiling water, ready-salted and skimmed, with the addition, if it be at hand, of the proportion of soda directed in page 359, as this will greatly improve the colour of the vegetable. When extremely young, the artichokes will be tender in from half to three-quarters of an hour, but they will require more than double that time when at their full growth: when the leaves can be drawn out easily they are done. Send good melted butter to table with them. They should be boiled always with the stalk-ends uppermost. Very young, \ to J hour; full-grown, 1 \ to 2 hours. Obs.—French cooks lift the tops from the artichokes before they are served, and replace them after having taken out the chokes: this must be expeditiously done to prevent the vegetable from cooling. ARTICHOKES EN SALADE. Wash, soak, and drain some very young and tender artichokes (they should not have attained more than a third of their growth), cut off the stalks close, quarter them, and send them to table with a little water in the dish. The chokes will be scarcely formed, and the remainder of the vegetable will have almost the flavour of fresh walnuts : it is constantly served thus in France as a hors d'oeuvre, VEGETABLE MARROW. It is customary to gather this when not larger than a turkey’s egg, but we should say that the vegetable is not then in its perfection. The flesh is whiter and of better flavour when the gourd is about six inches long;382 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XV. at least we have found it so witli the kinds which have fallen under our observation. It may either be boiled in the skin, then pared, halved, and served upon a toast; or quartered, freed from the seed, and left till cold, then dipped into egg and fine crumbs of bread, and fried ; or it may be cut into dice, and reheated in a little good white sauce ; or stewed tender in butter, and served in well-thickened veal-gravy, flavoured with a little lemon-juice. It may likewise be mashed by the receipt we have given for turnips, and in that form will be found excellent. The French make a fanciful dish >f the marrows thus : they boil them tender in water, and halve them lengthwise as is usual, they then slice a small bit off each to make them stand evenly in the dish, and after having hollowed the insides, so as to leave a mere shell, about half an inch thick, they fill them with a thick rich mince of white meat, and pour white sauce round them ; or they heap fried crumbs over the tops, place the dish in the oven for a few minutes, and serve them without sauce. Size of turkey’s egg, 10 to 15 minutes; moderate- sized, 20 to 30 ; large, J to 1 hour. TOMATAS EN SALADS. These are now often served in England in the Ameri- can fashion, merely sliced, and dressed like cucumbers, with salt, pepper, oil, and vinegar. For various other American modes of preparing them for table, see tomata dumplings, Chapter XVII. ROAST TOMATAS. To serve with roast leg, loin, or shoulder of mutton. Select them nearly of the same size, take off the stalks, and roast them gently in a Dutch oven, or if more convenient, place thorn at the edge of the dripping- pan, taking care that no fat from the joint shall fall upon them, and keeping the;a turned that they may be equally done. From ten to fourteen minutes will roast them.VEGETABLES. 383 CHAP. XV,] STEWED TOMATAS. Arrange them in a single layer, and pour to them as much gravy as will reach to half their height; stew them very softly till the under sides are done, then turn, and finish stewing them. Thicken the gravy with a little arrow-root and cream, or with flour and butter, and serve it round them. FORCED TOMATAS. (English Receipt.) Cut the stems quite close, slice off the tops of eight fine tomatas, and scoop out the insides; press the pulp through a sieve, and mix with it one ounce of fine crumbs of bread, one of butter, broken very small, some pepper, or cayenne, and salt. Fill the tomatas with the mixture, and bake them ten minutes in a moderate oven ; serve them with brown gravy in the dish. A few small mushrooms, stewed tender in a little butter, then minced and added to the tomata-pulp, will very much improve this receipt. Baked 10 minutes. FORCED TOMATAS. (French Receipt.) Let the tomatas be well shaped and of equal size; divide them nearly in the middle, leaving the blossom- side the largest, as this only is to be used; empty them carefully of their seeds and juice, and fill them with the following ingredients, which must previously be stewed tender in butter, but without being allowed to brown: minced mushrooms and shalofs, with a moderate pro- portion of parsley, some lean of ham, chopped small, a seasoning of cayenne, and a little fine salt, if needed ; let them cool? then mix with them about a third as much of fine crumbs of bread, and two yolks of eggs ; fill the tomatas, cover them with fine crumbs, moisten them with clarified butter, and bake them in a brisk oven until they are well coloured. Serve them as a garnish[chap. XV. MODERN COOKERY. 384 to stewed rump or sirloin of beef, or to a boned and forced leg of mutton. Minced lean of ham, 2 ozs.; mushrooms, 2 ozs.; bread-crumbs, 2 ozs.; shalots, 4 to 8 ; parsley, full teaspoonful; cayenne, quarter saltspoonful; little salt, if needed; butter, 2 ozs.; yolks of eggs, 2 to 3 : baked, 10 to 20 minutes. Obs.—The French pound the whole of these ingre- dients with a bit of garlic, before they fill the tomatas with them, but this is not absolutely necessary, and the garlic, if added at all, should be parboiled first, as its strong flavour, combined with that of the eschalots, would scarcely suit the general taste. When the lean of a dressed ham is at hand, only the herbs and vegetables will need to be stewed in the butter; this should be mixed with them into the forcemeat, which an intelligent cook will vary in many ways. PUREE OF TOMATAS. Divide a dozen fine ripe tomatas, squeeze out the seeds, and take off the stalks; put them with one small mild onion (or more, if liked), and about half a pint of very good gravy, into a well-tinned stewpan or saucepan, and simmer them for nearly or quite an hour ; a couple of bay-leaves, some cayenne, and as much salt as the dish may require should be added when they begin to boil. Press them through a sieve, heat them again, and stir to them a quarter-pint of good cream, previously mixed and boiled for five minutes *with a teaspoonful of flour. This puree is to be served with calf’s head, veal cutlets, boiled knuckle of veal, calf’s brains, or beef palates. For pork, beef, geese, and other brown meats, the tomatas should be reduced to a proper consistency in rich, and highly-flavoured brown gravy, or Spanish sauce. MUSHROOMS AU BEURRE. {Delicious.) Cut the stems from some fine meadow mushroom-VEGETABLES. 385 CHAP. XV.] buttons, and clean them with a bit of new flannel, and some fine salt, then either wipe them dry with a soft cloth, or rinse them in fresh water, drain them quickly, spread them in a clean cloth, fold it over them, and leave them ten minutes, or more, to dry. For every pint of them thus prepared, put an ounce and a half of fresh butter into a thick iron saucepan, shake it over the fire until it just begins to brown, throw in the mush- rooms, continue to shake the saucepan over a clear fire, that they may not stick to it, nor burn, and when they have simmered three or four minutes, strew over them a little salt, some cayenne, and pounded mace ; stew them till they are perfectly tender, heap them in a dish, and serve them with their own sauce only, for breakfast, supper, or luncheon. Nothing can be finer than the flavour of the mushrooms thus prepared; and the addition of any liquid is far from an improvement to it. They are very good when drained from the butter, and served cold, and in a cool larder may be kept for several days. The butter in which they are stewed is admirable for flavouring gravies, sauces, or potted meats. Small flaps, freed from the fur and skin, may be stewed in the same way; and either these, or the buttons, served under roast poultry or partridges, will give a dish of very superior relish. Meadow mushrooms, 3 pints, fresh butter, 4J ozs. : 3 to 5 minutes. Salt, 1 small teaspoonful; mace, half as much; cayenne, third of saltspoonful: 10 to 15 minutes. More spices to be added, if required—much depending on their quality; but they should not over- power the flavour of the mushrooms. Obs.—Persons inhabiting parts of the country where mushrooms are abundant, may send them easily, when thus prepared (or when potted by the following receipt), to their friends in cities, or in less productive counties. If poured into jars, with sufficient butter to cover them, they will travel any distance, and can be rewarmed for use. c c[CHAP. XY. 386 MODERN COOKERY. POTTED MUSHROOMS. Prepare either small flaps or buttons with great nicety, without wetting them, and wipe the former very dry, after the application of the salt and flannel. Stew them quite tender, with the same proportion of butter as the mushrooms Au Beurre, but increase a little the quantity of spice; when they are done, turn them into a large dish, spread them over one end of it, and raise it two or three inches, that they may be well drained from the butter. As soon as they are quite cold, press them very closely into small potting-pans; pour luke- warm clarified butter thickly over them, and store them in a cool dry place. If intended for present use, merely turn them down upon a clean shelf, but for longer keeping, cover the tops first with very dry paper, and then with melted mutton-suet. We have ourselves had the mushrooms after being simply spread upon a dish while hot, remain perfectly good in that state for seven or eight weeks : they were prepared late in the season, and the weather was consequently cool during the interval. MUSHROOM-TOAST, OR CROUTE AUX CHAMPIGNONS. (Excellent.) Cut the stems closely from a quart, or more, of small just-opened mushrooms, peel them, and take out the fur. Dissolve from two to three ounces of fresh butter in a well-tinned saucepan or stewpan; put in the mushrooms, strew over them a quarter-teaspoonful of pounded mace mixed with a little cayenne, and let them stew over a gentle fire from ten to fifteen minutes; toss or stir them often during the time ; then add a small dessertspoonful of flour, and shake the pan round until it is lightly browned. Next pour in, by slow degrees, half a pint of gravy or of good beef-broth; and when the mushrooms have stewed softly in this for a couple of minutes throw in a little salt, and a squeeze of lemon-juice, and pour them on to a crust, cut about an inch and a quarter thick, from the under part of aCHAP.

New milk, or thin cream, may be used with very good effect instead of the gravy; but a few strips of lemon-rind, and a small portion of nutmeg and mushroom-catsup should then be added to the sauce. The bread may be buttered and grilled over a gentle fire instead of being fried, and is better so. Small mushrooms, 4 to 5 half pints ; butter, 3 to 4 ozs.; mace, mixed with a little cayenne, \ teaspoonful: stewed softly 10 to 15 minutes. Flour, 1 small dessertspoonful: 3 to 5 minutes.

The truffle is so scantily produced in England, and it is so expensive, even in the countries where it is both of finer and more abundant growth, that it is little seen here except at the tables of the wealthier classes. As we cannot, from our own experience, give receipts for dressing it, we cite the best French authority on the subject. TRUFFLES WITH CHAMPAGNE, A LA SERVIETTE. Select the finest truffles for this dish, be particular in smelling them, and reject any that have a musty smell. Wash and brush them well with cold water only, change it several times, and when they are per- fectly clean line a stewpan with slices of bacon ; put in the truffles with a bunch of parsley, green onions and thyme, two or three bay-leaves, half a dozen cloves, and a little sweet basil; pour in sufficient rich veal gravy to cover them, with the addition of from half a pint to half a bottle of champagne; boil them very softly for an hour, then draw them aside and let them cool in the gravy. Heat them afresh in it when they are wanted for table; lift them out and drain them in a very clean cloth, and dish them neatly in a fine and beautifully-white napkin, which shall contrast as strongly as possible with the dark hue of the truffles.MODERN COOKERY. 888 (CHAP. XV. TRUFFLES A l’iTALIENNE. Wash perfectly clean, wipe, and pare some truffles as thin as possible; slice them about the size of a penny; put them into a saute-pan (or small frying- pan), with a slice of fresh butter, some minced parsley and eschalot, salt and pepper ; put them on the fire and stir them, that they may fry equally; when they are done, which will be in about ten minutes, drain off part of the butter, and throw in a bit of fresh, a small ladleful of Spanish sauce (see page 105), the juice of one lemon, qnd a little cayenne pepper. This is a dish of high relish. TO BOIL SPROUTS, CABBAGES, SAVOYS, LETTUCES, OR ENDIVE. All green vegetables should be thrown into abun- dance of fast boiling water ready salted and skimmed, with the addition of the morsel of soda which we have recommended, in a previous page of this Chapter; the pan should be left uncovered, and every precaution taken to prevent the smoke from reaching its contents. Endive, sprouts, and spring greens, will only require copious washing before they are boiled; but savoys, large lettuces, and close-leaved cabbages should be thrown into salt and water for half an hour or more before they are dressed, with the tops downwards to draw out the insects. The stems of these last should be cut off, the decayed leaves stripped away, and the vegetable halved or quartered, or split deeply across the stalk-end, and divided entirely before it is dished. Yery'young greens, 15 to 20 minutes; lettuces, 20 to 30 minutes; large savoys, or cabbages, 1 to 1 \ hour, or more. Ohs.—When the stalk of any kind of cabbage is tender, it is done. Turnip-greens should be well washed in several waters, and boiled in a very large quantity to deprive them of their bitterness.8 8S CHAP. XV.] VEGETABLES. STEWED CABBAGE. Cut out the stalk entirely, and slice a fine firm cab- bage or two in very thin strips; throw them after they have been well washed and drained, into a large pan of boiling water ready salted and skimmed, and when they are tender, which will be in from ten to fifteen minutes, pour them into a sieve or strainer, press the water thoroughly from them, and chop them slightly. Put into a very clean saucepan about a couple of ounces of butter, and when it is dissolved add the cabbage, with sufficient pepper and salt to season it, and stir it over a clear fire until it appears tolerably dry; then shake lightly in a tablespoonful of flour, turn the whole well, and add by slow degrees a cup of thick cream : veal gravy or good white-sauce may be substituted for this, when preferred to it. TO BOIL TURNIPS. Pare entirely from them the stringy rind, and either split the turnips once or leave them whole; throw them into boiling water slightly salted, and keep them closely - covered from smoke and dust till they are tender. When small and young they will be done in from fifteen to twenty minutes; at their full growth they will re- quire from three-quarters to a full hour, or more, of gentle boiling. After they become old and woolly they are not worth dressing in any way. When boiled in their skins and pared afterwards, they are said to be of better flavour and much less watery than when cooked in the usual way. Young turnips, 15 to 20 minutes; full-grown, % to 1 hour, or more. TO MASH TURNIPS. Split them once or even twice should they be large; after they are pared, boil them very tender, and press the water thoroughly from them with a couple of trenchers, or with the back of a large plate and one[CHAP. XY. MODERN COOKERY. 390 trencher. To ensure their being free from lumps, it is better to pass them through a cullender or coarse hair- sieve, with a wooden spoon, though, when quite young, they may be worked sufficiently smooth without this. Put them into a clean saucepan and stir them constantly for some minutes over a gentle fire, that they may be very dry, then add some salt, a bit of fresh butter, and a little cream, or in lieu of this new milk (we wTould also recommend a seasoning of white pepper or cayenne when appearance and fashion are not particularly re- garded), and continue to simmer and to stir them for five or six minutes longer, or until they have quite absorbed all the liquid which has been poured to them. Serve them always as hot as possible. This is an excel- lent receipt. Turnips, weighed after they are pared, 3 lbs. : dried 5 to 8 minutes. Salt, 1 teaspoonful; butter, 1 oz. to 1-1 oz.; cream or milk, nearly pint: 5 or 6 minutes. TURNIPS IN WHITE SAUCE. When no scoop for the purpose is at hand, cut some small finely-grained turnips into quarters, and pare them into balls, or into the shape of plums or pears of equal size; arrange them evenly in a broad stewpan or sauce- pan, and cover them nearly with good veal-broth, throw in a little salt, and a morsel of sugar, and boil them rather quickly until they are quite tender, but unbroken ; lift them out, draining them well from the broth; dish, and pour over them some thick white sauce. As an economy, a cup of cream, and a teaspoonful of arrow- root, may be added to the broth in which the turnips have stewed, to make the sauce ; and when it boils, a small slice of butter may be stirred and well worked into it, should it not be sufficiently rich without. TURNIPS STEWED IN BUTTER. (GOOD.) This is an excellent way of dressing the vegetable when it is mild, and finely-grained ; but its flavour otherwise is too strong to be agreeable. After theyVEGETABLES. 391 CHAP. XV.] have been washed, wiped quite dry, and pared, slice the turnips nearly half an inch thick, and divide them into dice. Just dissolve an ounce of butter for each half- pound of the turnips, put them in as fiat as they can be, and stew them very gently indeed, from three-quarters of an hour to a full hour. Add a seasoning of salt and white pepper when they are half done. When thus prepared, they may be dished over fried, or nicely- broiled mutton cutlets, or served by themselves. For a small dish; turnips, Ij lb.; butter, 3 ozs.; seasoning of white pepper; salt, \ teaspoonful or more : f to 1 hour. Large dish, turnips, 2 lbs.; butter, 4 ozs. TURNIPS IN GRAVY. To a pound of turnips sliced and cut into dice, pour a quarter-pint of boiling veal-gravy, add a small lump of sugar, some salt and cayenne, or white pepper, and boil them quickly from fifty to sixty minutes. Serve them very hot. TO BOIL CARROTS. Wash the mould from them, and scrape the skin off lightly with the edge of a sharp knife, or, should this be objected to, pare them as thin and as equally as pos- sible ; in either case, free them from all blemishes, and should they be very large, split them across the tops a few inches down; rinse them well, and throw them into plenty of boiling water with some salt in it. The skin of very young carrots maybe rubbed off like that of new potatoes, and from twenty to thirty minutes will then be sufficient to boil them ; but at their full growth they will require from an hour and a half to two hours. It was formerly the custom to tie them in a cloth, and to wipe the skin from them with it after they were dressed; and old-fashioned cooks still use one to remove it; but all vegetables should, we think, be dished and served with the least possible delay after they are ready for table. Melted butter should accompany boiled carrots. Yery young carrots, 20 to. SO minutes. Full-grown ones, 1J to 2 hours.MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XV 392 * See plate, page 358. CARROTS. (The Windsor Receipt.) Select some good carrots of equal size, and cut the upper parts into even lengths of about two inches and a half, then trim one end of each into a point, so as to give the carrot the form of a sugar-loaf.* When all are ready, throw them into plenty of ready-salted boiling water, and boil them three-quarters of an hour. Lift them out, and drain them well, then arrange them upright, and all on a level in a broad stewpan or saucepan, and pour in good hot beef-broth, or veal-gravy to half their height; add as much salt as may be needed, and a small teaspoonful of sugar, and boil them briskly for half an hour, or longer, should they require it. Place them again upright in dishing them, and keep them hot while a little good brown gravy is thickened to pour over them, and mixed with a large teaspoonful of parsley and a little lemon-juice; or sauce them with common bechamel (see page 117), or white sauce, with or without the addition of parsley. Thick part of carrots cut in cones : boiled j hour. With gravy or broth, little salt and sugar: | hour, or more. Sauce : thickened gravy, bechamel made without meat, or common white sauce. Obs.—The carrots dressed thus are exceedingly good without any sauce, beyond the small quantity of liquid which will remain in the stewpan with them ; or with a few spoonsful more of gravy added to this, and thickened with butter and a little flour. SWEET CARROTS. (Second-course Dish.) Boil quite tender some fine highly-flavoured carrots, press the water from them, and rub them through the back of a fine hair -sieve; put them into a clean saucepan or stewpan, and dry them thoroughly over a gentle fire; then add a slice of fresh butter, and when this is dissolved and well mixed with them, strew in a dessert-VEGETABLES. 393 CHAP. XV.] spoonful or more of powdered sugar, and a little salt; next, stir in by degrees some good cream, and when this is quite absorbed, and the carrots again appear dry, dish and serve them quickly with small sippets, a la Reine (see page 6), placed round them. Carrots, 3 lbs., boiled quite tender: stirred over a gentle fire 5 to 10 minutes. Butter, 2 ozs.; salt, ^ teaspoonful; pounded sugar, 1 dessertspoonful ; cream, i pint, stewed gently together till quite dry. Ohs.—For excellent mashed carrots omit the sugar, add a good seasoning of salt and white pepper, and half a pint of rich brown gravy ; or for a plain dinner rather less than this of milk. CARROTS AU BEURRE, OR BUTTERED CARROTS. Either boil sufficient carrots for a dish quite tender, and then cut them into slices a quarter inch thick, or first slice, and themboil them : the latter method is the most expeditious, hut the other best preserves the flavour of the vegetable. Drain them well, and while this is being done just dissolve from two to four ounces of butter in a saucepan, and strew in some minced parsley, some salt, and white pepper or cayenne; then add the carrots, and toss them very gently until they are equally covered with the sauce, which should not be allowed to boil: the parsley may be omitted at pleasure. Cold carrots may be re warmed in this way. TO BOIL PARSNEPS. These are dressed in precisely the same manner as carrots, but require much less boiling. According to their quality, and the time of year, they will take from twenty minutes to nearly an hour. Every speck or blemish should be cut from them after they are scraped, and the water in which they are boiled should be well skimmed. They are a favourite accompani- ment to salt-fish and boiled pork, and may be served either mashed or plain. 20 to 55 minutes.MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XV. 394 * See plate, page 358. FRIED PARSNEPS. Boil them till they are about half done, lift them out, and let them cool; slice them rather thickly, sprinkle them with fine salt and white pepper, and fry them a pale brown in good butter. Serve them with roast meat, or dish them under it. JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES. Wash the artichokes, pare them quickly, and throw them as they are done into a saucepan of cold water, or of equal parts of milk and water; and when they are about half boiled add a little salt to them. Take them up the instant they are perfectly tender : this will be in from fifteen to twenty-five minutes, so much do they vary as to the time necessary to dress them. If allowed to remain in the water after they are done they become black and flavourless. Melted butter should always be sent to table with them. 15 to 25 minutes. TO FRY JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES. Boil them from eight to twelve minutes; lift them out, drain'them on a sieve, and let them cool; dip them into beaten eggs, and cover them with fine bread- crumbs. Fry them a light brown, drain, pile them in a hot dish, and serve them quickly. JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES, A LA RHINE.* Wash and wipe the artichokes, cut off one end of each quite flat, and trim the other into a point; boil them in milk and water, lift them out the instant they are done, place them upright in the dish in which they are to be served, and sauce them with a good bechamel, or with nearly half a pint of cream thickened with a small dessertspoonful of flour, mixed with an ounce and a half of butter, and seasoned with a little mace and some salt. When cream cannot be procured use new milk, and increase the proportion of flour andCHAP. XV.] VEGETABLES. 395 butter, though the sauce thus made will serve only for a family dinner. MASHED JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES. Boil them tender, press the water well from them, and then proceed exactly as for mashed turnips, taking care to dry the artichokes well, both before and after the milk or cream is added to them : they will be ex- cellent if good white sauce is substituted for either of these. HARICOTS BLANCS. The haricot blanc is the seed of a particular kind of French bean, of which we find some difficulty in ascertain- ing the English name, for though we have tried several which resembled it in appearance, we found their flavour, after they were dressed, very different, and far from agree- able. The large white Dutch runner, is, we believe, the proper variety for cooking; at least we have obtained a small quantity under that name, which approached much more nearly than any others we had tried to those which wre had eaten abroad. The haricots, when freshly harvested, may be thrown into plenty of boiling water, with some salt and a small bit of butter; if old, they must be previously soaked for an hour or two, put into cold water, brought to boil gently, and simmered until they are tender, for if boiled fast the skins will burst before the beans are done. Drain them thoroughly from the water when they are ready, and lay them into a clean saucepan over two or three ounces of fresh butter, a small dessertspoonful of chopped parsley, and suffi- cient salt and pepper to season the whole; then gently shake or toss the beans until they are quite hot and equally covered with the sauce; add the strained juice of half a lemon, and serve them quickly. The vegetable thus dressed, is excellent; and it affords a convenient resource in the season when the supply of other kinds is scantiest. In some countries the dried beans are placed in water, over-night, upon a stove (those invented by396 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XV. Dr. Arnott,* would, from the perfect regulation of the heat, answer for the purpose better than most others, we apprehend), and by a very gentle degree of warmth are sufficiently softened by the following day to be served as follows:—they are drained from the water, spread on a clean cloth and wiped quite dry, then lightly floured and fried in oil or butter, with a seasoning of pepper and salt, lifted into a hot dish, and served under roast beef, or mutton. TO BOIL BEET-ROOT. Wash the roots delicately clean, but neither scrape nor cut them, as not a fibre even should be trimmed away, until after they are dressed. Throw them into boiling- water, and according to their size boil them from one hour and a half to two hours and a half. Pare and serve them whole, or thickly sliced, and send melted butter to table with them. Many persons prefer the beet-root baked, after being washed and wiped very dry. It is often mixed with winter salads; and it makes a pickle of beautiful colour; but one of the most usual modes of serving it at the present day is, with the cheese, cold and merely pared and sliced, after having been boiled or baked. \ \ to hours. Baked, 2| to 3J hours. Obs.—This root must not be probed with a fork like other vegetables, to ascertain if it be done or not, but the cook must endeavour by attention to learn the time required for it. After it is lifted out, the thickest part may be pressed with the fingers, to which it will yield, if it be sufficiently boiled. STEWED BEET-ROOT. Bake or boil it tolerably tender, and let it remain till it is cold, then pare and cut it into slices; heat and * So many impositions are practised on the public with regard to these stoves, that we think it well to name Mr. Livermore, 30, Oxford-street, as an authorized and excellent constructor of the genuine ones.VEGETABLES. CHAP. XV.] 397 stew it for a short time in some good pale veal-gravy (or in strong veal-broth for ordinary occasions), thicken this with a teaspoonful of arrow-root, add half a cup or more of good cream, and stir in, as it is taken from the fire, from a tea to a tablespoonful of Chili-vinegar. The beet-root may be served likewise in thick white sauce, to which just before it is dished the mild eschalot of page 164, may be added. TO STEW RED CABBAGE. (Flemish Receipt.') Strip the outer leaves from a fine and fresh red cab- bage ; wash it well, and cut it into the thinnest possible slices, beginning at the top; put it into a thick sauce- pan in which two or three ounces of good butter have been just dissolved ; add some pepper and salt, and stew it very slowly indeed for three or four hours in its own juice, keeping it often stirred, and well pressed down. When it is perfectly tender add a tablespoonful of vinegar; mix the whole up thoroughly, heap the cabbage in a hot dish, and serve broiled sausages round it; or omit these last, and substitute lemon‘juice, cayenne pepper, and a half-cupful of good gravy. The stalk of the cabbage should be split in quarters and taken entirely out in the first instance. 3 to 4 hours. BRUSSELS SPROUTS. These delicate little sprouts, or miniature cabbages, should be gathered when not larger than a common walnut, and after being trimmed free from any decayed leaves, and washed very thoroughly, should be thrown into a pan of water properly salted, and boiled from eight to ten minutes, then well drained, and served upon a rather thick round of toasted bread, buttered on both sides. Rich melted butter must be sent to table with them. This is the Belgian mode of dressing this excellent vegetable, which is served in France with the sauce poured over it, or it is tossed in a stewpan[CHAP. XV. MODERN COOKERY. 398 with a slice of butter and some pepper and salt: a spoonful or two of veal-gravy (and sometimes a little lemon-juice) is added when these are perfectly mixed. 8 to 10 minutes. SALSIFY. * We are surprised that a vegetable so excellent as this should be so little cared for in England. Delicately fried in batter,—which is a common mode of serving it abroad, —it forms both an elegant and delicious second-course dish ; it is also good when plain boiled, drained, and served in gravy, or even with melted butter. Wash the roots, scrape gently off the dark outside skin, and throw them into cold water as they are done, to prevent their turning black; cut them into lengths of three or four inches, and when all are ready put them into plenty of boiling water, with a little salt, a small bit of butter, and a couple of spoonsful of white vinegar, or the juice of a lemon : they will be done in from three- quarters of an hour to an hour. Try them with a fork, and when perfectly tender, drain, and serve them with white sauce, rich brown gravy, or melted butter. | to 1 hour. FRIED SALSIFY. Boil the salsify tender, as directed above, drain, and then press it lightly in a soft cloth. Make some French batter (see page 154), throw the bits of salsify into it, take them out separately, and fry them a light brown, drain them well from the fat, sprinkle a little fine salt over them, after they are dished, and serve them quickly. At English tables, salsify occasionally makes its appear- ance fried with egg and bread-crumbs instead of batter. Scorgonera is dressed in precisely the same manner as the salsify. BOILED CELERY. This vegetable is extremely good dressed like sea- kale, and served on a toast with rich melted butter. Let it be freshly-dug, wash it with great nicety, trim399 CHAP* XV.] VEGETABLES. the ends, take off the coarse outer-leaves, cut the roots of equal length, tie them in bunches, and boil them in plenty of water, with the usual proportion of salt, from twenty to thirty minutes. 20 to 30 minutes. STEWED CELERY. Cut five or six fine roots of celery to the length of the inside of the dish in which they are to be served; free them from all the coarser leaves, and from the green tops, trim the root ends neatly, and wash the vegetable in several waters till it is as clean as possible; then, either boil it tender, with a little salt, and a bit of fresh butter the size of a walnut, in just sufficient water to cover it quite, drain it well, arrange it on a very hot dish, and pour a thick bechamel, or white-sauce over it; or stew it in broth or common stock, and serve it with very rich, thickened, Espagnole or brown gravy. It has a higher flavour when partially stewed in the sauce, after being drained thoroughly from the broth. Unless very large and old, it will be done in from twenty- five to thirty minutes, but if not quite tender, longer time must be allowed for it. A cheap and expeditious method of preparing this dish is to slice the celery, to simmer it till soft in as much good broth as will only just cover it, to add a thickening of flour and butter, or arrow-root, some salt, pepper, and a small cup of cream. 25 to 30 minutes, or more. STEWED ONIONS. Strip the outer skin from four or five fine Portugal onions, and trim the ends, but without cutting into the vegetable; arrange them in a saucepan of sufficient size to contain them all in one layer; just cover them with good beef, or veal gravy, and stew them very gently indeed for a couple of hours : they should be tender quite through, but should not be allowed to fall to pieces. When large, but not mild onions are used, they should be first boiled for half an hour in plenty ofMODERN COOKERY. [[CHA.P. XY. 400 water, then drained from it, and put into boiling gravy: strong, well-flavoured broth of veal or beef, is some- times substituted for this, and with the addition of a little catsup, spice, and thickening answers very well. The savour of this dish is heightened by flouring lightly and frying the onions of a pale brown before they are stewed. Portugal onions, 4 or 5 (if fried, 15 to 20 minutes) ; broth or gravy, 1 to 1 \ pint : nearly or quite 2 hours. Obs.—When the quantity of gravy is considered too much, the onions may be only half covered, and turned when the under side is tender, but longer time must then be allowed for stewing them. STEWED CHESTNUTS. Strip the outer rind from forty or fifty fine sound Spanish chestnuts, throw them into a large saucepan of hot water, and bring it to the point of boiling ; when the second skin parts from them easily, lift them out, and throw them into plenty of cold water; peel, arid wipe them dry, then put them into a stewpan or bright saucepan, with as much highly-flavoured cold beef or veal-gravy as will nearly cover them, and stew them very gently from three-quarters of an hour to a full hour : they should be quite tender, but unbroken. Add salt, cayenne, or thickening, if required, and serve the chestnuts in their gravy. We have found it an im- provement to have them floured and lightly browned in a little good butter before they are stewed, and also to add some thin strips of fresh lemon-rind to the gravy. Chestnuts, 40 or 50; gravy, J pint, or more : f to 1 hour. Obs.—A couple of bay-leaves and a slice of lean ham will give an improved flavour to the sauce should it not be sufficiently rich : the ham should be laid under the chestnuts, but not served with them. When these are to be browned, or even otherwise, they may be freed readily from the second skin by shaking them with a small bit of butter in a frying-pan over a gentle fire.401 PASTRY. CHAP. XVI.] CHAPTER XYI. PASTRY. Mould for French Pies, or Passeroles of Rice. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. The greatest possible cleanliness and nicety should be observed in making pastry. The slab or board, paste- rollers, tins, cutters, stamps, everything, in fact, used for it, and especially the hands (for these last are not always so scrupulously attended to as they ought to be), should be equally free from the slightest soil, or particle of dust. The more expeditiously the finer kinds of crust are made and despatched to the oven, and the less they are touched the better. Much of their excellence de- pends upon the baking also; they should have a suffi- cient degree of heat to raise them quickly, but not so fierce a one as to colour them too much before they are done, and still less to burn them. The oven-door should remain closed after they are put in, and not removed until the paste is set. Large raised pies require a steadily sustained, or, what is technically called, a soaking heat, and to ensure this the oven should be made very hot, then cleared, and closely shut from half to a whole hour before it is used, to concentrate the heat. It is an advantage in this case to have a large D D[chap. xyi„ 402 MODERN COOKERY. log or two of cord-wood burned in it, in addition to the usual firing. In mixing paste, the water should he added gradually, and the whole gently drawn together with the fingers, until sufficient has been added, when it should be lightly kneaded until it is as smooth as possi- ble. When carelessly made, the surface is often left covered with small dry crumbs or lumps; or the water is poured in heedlessly in so large a proportion that it becomes necessary to add more flour to render it 'work- able in any way ; and this ought particularly to be avoided when a certain weight of all the ingredients has been taken. TO GLAZE OR ICE PASTRY. The fine yellow glaze appropriate to meat-pies, is given with beaten yolk of egg, which should be laid on with a paste-brush, or a small bunch of feathers: if a lighter colour be wished for, whisk the whole of the egg together, or mix a little milk with the yolk. The best mode of icing fruit-tarts before they are sent to the oven is, to moisten the paste with cold water, to sift sugar thickly upon it, and to press it lightly on with the hand; but when a whiter icing is preferred, the pastry must be drawn from the oven when nearly baked, and brushed with white of egg, whisked to a froth; then well covered with the sifted sugar, and sprinkled with a few drops of water before it is put in again : this glazing answers also very well, though it takes a slight colour, if used before the pastry is baked. FEUILLETAGE, OR PINE FRENCH PUFF PASTE. This, when made by a good French cook, is the per- fection of rich light crust, and will rise in the oven from one to six inches in height; but some practice is, without doubt, necessary to accomplish this. In sum- mer it is a great advantage to have ice at hand, and to harden the butter over it before it is used; the paste also between the intervals of rolling is improved byPASTRY. CHAP. XVI.] 403 being laid on an oven-leaf over a vessel containing it. Take an equal weight of good butter free from the coarse salt which is found in some, and which is dis- advantageous for this paste, and of fine dry, sifted flour; to each pound of these allow the yolks of a couple of eggs, and a small teaspoonful of salt. Break a few small bits of the butter very lightly into the flour, put the salt into the centre, • and pour on it sufficient water to dissolve it (we do not quite understand why the doing this should be better than mixing it with the flour, as in other pastes, but such is the method always pursued for it) ; add a little more water to the eggs, moisten the flour gradually, and make it into a very smooth paste, rather lithe in summer, and never exceed- ingly stiff, though the opposite fault, in an extreme, would render the crust unmanageable. Press, in a soft thin cloth, all the moisture from the remainder of the butter, and form it into a ball, but in doing this, be careful not to soften it too much. Should it be in an unfit state for pastry, from the heat of the weather, put it into a basin, and set the basin in a pan of water mixed with plenty of salt and saltpetre, and let it remain in a cool place for an hour if possible, before it is used. When it is ready (and the paste should never be com- menced till it is so), roll the crust out square,* and of sufficient size to enclose the butter, flatten this a little upon it in the centre, and then fold the crust well over it, and roll it out thin as lightly as possible, after having dredged the board and paste-roller with a little flour : this is called giving it one turn. Then fold it in three, give it another turn, and set it aside, where it will be very cool, for a few minutes; give it two more turns in the same way, rolling it each time very lightly, but of equal thickness, and to the full length that it will reach, taking always especial care that the butter shall not break through the paste. Let it again be set aside * The learner will perhaps find it easier to fold the paste se- curely round it in the form of a dumpling, until a little experience has been acquired.MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XVI. 404 to become cold ; and after it has been twice more rolled and folded in three, give it a half-turn, by folding it once only, and it will be ready for use. Equal weight of the finest flour and good butter; to each pound of these, the yolks of two eggs, and a small saltspoonful of salt: 6\ turns to be given to the paste. VERY GOOD LIGHT PASTE. Mix with a pound of sifted flour six ounces of fresh, pure lard, and make them into a smooth paste with cold water; press the buttermilk from ten ounces of butter, and form it into a ball, by twisting a clean cloth round it. Roll out the paste, put the ball of butter in the middle, close it like an apple-dumpling, and roll it very lightly till it is less than an inch thick; fold the ends into the middle, dust a little flour over the board and paste-roller, and roll the paste thin a second time, then set it aside for three or four minutes in a very cool place ; give it two more turns, as they are technically called, and after it has again been left a few minutes, roll it out twice more, folding it each time in three. This ought to render it fit for use. The sooner this paste is sent to the oven after it is made, the lighter it will be: if allowed to remain long before it is baked, it will be tough and heavy. Flour, 1 lb.; lard, 6 ozs. ; butter, 10 ozs.; little salt. ENGLISH PUFF-PASTE. Break lightly into a couple of pounds of dried and sifted flour, eight ounces of butter; add a pinch of salt, and sufficient cold water to make the paste; work it as quickly and as lightly as possible, until it is smooth and pliable, then level it with the paste-roller till it is three-quarters of an inch thick, and place regularly upon it six ounces of butter in small bits ; fold tbre paste like a blanket pudding, roll it out again, lay on it six ounces more of butter, repeat the rolling, dusting each time a little flour over the board and paste, add again six ounces of butter, and roll the paste out thin three or four times, folding the ends into the middle.405 CHAP. XVI.] PASTRY. Flour, 2 lbs.; little salt; butter, 1 lb. 10 ozs. If very rich paste be required, equal portions of flour and butter must be used; and the latter maybe divided into two, instead of three parts, when it is to be rolled in. CREAM CRUST. ( Very good.') Stir a little fine salt into a pound of dry flour, and mix gradually with it sufficient very thick sweet cream to form a smooth paste ; it will be found sufficiently good for common family dinners, without the addition of butter; but to make an excellent crust, roll in four ounces in the usual way, after having given the paste a couple of turns. Handle it as lightly as possible in making it, and send it to the oven as soon as it is ready; it may be used for fruit tarts, cannelons, puffs, and other varieties of small pastry, or for good meat-pies. Six ounces of butter to the pound of flour will give a very rich crust.

Sift two pounds and a quarter of fine dry flour, and break into it one pound of butter, work them together with the fingers till they resemble fine crumbs of bread, then add a small teaspoonful of salt, and make them into a firm paste, with the yolks of four eggs, well beaten, mixed with half a pint of cold water, and strained: or (for a somewhat richer crust of the same kind), take two pounds of flour, one of butter, the yolks of four eggs, half an ounce of salt, and less than the half pint of water, and work the whole well until the paste is perfectly smooth.

Flead is the provincial name for the leaf, or inside fat of a pig, which makes excellent crust when fresh, much finer, indeed, than after it is melted into lard. Clear it quite from skin, and slice it very thin into the flour, add sufficient salt to give flavour to the paste, and make the whole up smooth and firm with cold water; lay it on a clean dresser, and beat it forcibly with a rolling-pin until the flead is blended perfectly with the flour. It may then be made into cakes with a paste-cutter, or used for pies, round the edges of which a knife should be passed, as the crust rises better when cut than if merely rolled to the proper size. With the addition of a small quantity of butter,* which should be rolled in after the paste is made, it will be found equal to fine puff-crust, with the advan- tage of being more easy of digestion. COMMON SUET-CRUST FOR PIES. In many families this is preferred both for pies and tarts, to crust made with butter, as being much more wholesome: but it should never be served unless espe- cially ordered, as it is to some persons peculiarly dis- tasteful. Chop the suet extremely fine, and add from six to eight ounces of it to a pound of flour, with a few grains of salt, mix these with cold water into a firm paste, and work it very smooth. Some cooks beat it with a paste-roller, until the suet is perfectly blended with the flour; but the crust is lighter without this. In exceedingly sultry weather the suet, not being firm enough to chop, may be sliced as thin as possible, and well beaten into the paste after it is wetted. Flour, 2 lbs.; beef or veal kidney-suet, 12 to 16 ozs.; salt (for fruit-pies), J teaspoonful, for meat-pies 1 teaspoonful. * Six ounces of flead, with two of butter, to the pound of flour, will make good common crust; half as much again, with the same weight of flour, excellent crust: a teaspoonful of salt will be required with either.407 PASTRY. CHAP. XVI.] VERY SUPERIOR SUET-CRUST* Strip the skin entirely from some fresh real or beef kidney-suet; chop, and then put it into the mortar, with a small quantity of pure-flavoured lard, oil, or butter, and pound it perfectly smooth : it may then be used for crust in the same way that butter is in making puff-paste, and in this form will be found a most excellent substitute for it, for hot pies or tarts. It is not quite so good for those which are to be served cold. Eight ounces of suet pounded with two of but- ter, and worked with the fingers into a pound of flour will make an exceedingly good short crust; but for a very rich one the proportion must be increased. Good short crust: flour 1 lb.; suet, 8 ozs. ; butter, 2 ozs.; salt, | teaspoonful. Richer crust: suet 16 ozs. ; butter, 4 ozs.; flour, 1J lb.; salt, 1 small teaspoonful. VERY RICH SHORT CRUST FOR TARTS. Break lightly, with the least possible handling, six ounces of butter into eight of flour; add a dessert- spoonful of pounded sugar, and two or three of water ; roll the paste, for several minutes, to blend the ingre- dients well, folding it together like puff-crust, and touch it as little as possible. Flour, 8 ozs. ; butter, 6 ozs. ; pounded sugar, 1 des- sertspoonful ; water, 1 to 2 spoonsful. BRIOCHE PASTE. The brioche is a rich, light kind of unsweetened bun, or cake, very commonly sold, and served to all classes of people in France, where it is made in great perfection by good cooks and pastrycooks. It is fashionable now at English tables, though in a different form, serving principally as a crust to enclose rissoles, or to make cannelons and fritters. We have seen it recommended for a vol-au-vent, for which we should say it does not answer by any means so well as the fine puff-paste called feuilletage. The large proportion of butter and[CHAP. XVI. MODERN COOKERY. 408 eggs which it contains render it to many persons highly indigestible; and we mention this to warn invalids against it, as we have known it to cause great suffering to persons out of health. To make it, take a couple of pounds* of fine dry flour, sifted as for cakes, and sepa- rate eight ounces of this from the remainder to make the leaven. Put it into a small pan, and mix it lightly into a lithe paste, with half an ounce of yeast, and a spoonful or two of warm water; make two or three slight incisions across the top, throw a cloth over the pan, and place it near the fire for about twenty minutes, to rise. In the interval make a hollow space in the centre of the remainder of the flour, and put into it half an ounce of salt, as much fine sifted sugar, and half a gill of cream, or a dessertspoonful of water; add a pound of butter, as free from moisture as it can be, and quite so from large grains of salt; cut it into small bits, put it into the flour, and pour on it one by one six fresh eggs freed from the specks; then with the fingers work the flour gently into this mass until the whole forms a perfectly smooth, and not stiff paste : a seventh egg, or the yolk of one, or even of two, may be added with advantage if the flour will absorb them; but the brioche must always be workable, and, not so moist as to adhere to the board, and roller disagreeably. When the leaven is well risen spread this paste out, and the leaven over it; mix them well together with the hands, then cut the whole into several portions, and change them about that the leaven may be incorporated perfectly and equally with the other ingredients: when this is done, and the brioche is perfectly smooth and pliable, dust some flour on a cloth, roll the brioche in it, and lay it into a pan ; place it in summer in a cool * It should be remarked, that the directions for brioche- making are principally derived from the French, and that the pound in their country weighs two ounces more than with us : this difference will account for the difficulty of working in the num- ber of eggs which they generally specify, and which render the paste too moist.409 CHAP. XVT.] PASTRY. place, in winter in a warm one. It is usually made over-night, and baked in the early part of the follow- ing day. It should then be kneaded up afresh the first thing in the morning. To mould it in the usual form, make it into balls of uniform size, hollow these a little at the top by pressing the thumb round them, brush them over with yolk of egg, and put a second much smaller ball into the hollow part of each ; glaze them entirely with yolk of egg, and send them to a quick oven for half an hour or more. The paste may also be made info the form of a large cake, then placed on a tin, or copper oven-leaf, and supported with a pasteboard in the baking; for the form of which see introductory page of Chapter XXIII. Flour, 2 lbs. ; yeast, \ oz.; salt and sugar, each ^ oz.; butter, 1 lb.; eggs, 6 to 8. MODERN POTATOE PASTY. [An excellent family dish.) A tin mould of the construction shewn in the plate, with a perforated moveable top, and a small valve to allow the escape of the steam, must be had for this pasty, which is an excellent family dish, and which may be varied in numberless ways. Arrange at the bottom of the mould from two to three pounds of mutton cut- lets, freed, according to the taste, from all or from the greater portion of the fat, then washed, lightly dredged on both sides with flour, and seasoned with salt and pepper, or cayenne. Pour to them sufficient broth or water to make the gravy, and add to it at pleasure, a tablespoonful of mushroom catsup or of Harvey’s sauce.MODERN COOKERY. 410 [CHAP. XVI. Have ready boiled, and very smoothly mashed, with about an ounce of butter and a spoonful or two of milk or cream, to each pound, as many good potatoes as will form a crust to the pasty of quite three inches thick; put the cover on the mould and arrange these equally upon it, leaving them a little rough on the surface. Bake the pasty in a moderate oven from three- quarters of an hour to an hour and a quarter, according to its size and its contents. Pin a folded napkin neatly round the mould, before it is served, and have ready a hot dish to receive the cover, which must not be lifted off until after the pasty is on the table. Chicken, or veal and oysters; delicate pork chops with a seasoning of sage and a little parboiled onion, or an eschalot or two minced tine; partridges or rabbits neatly carved, mixed with small mushrooms, and moist- ened with a little good stock, will all give excellent varieties of this dish, which may be made likewise with highly-seasoned slices of salmon freed from the skin, sprinkled with fine herbs or intermixed with shrimps : clarified butter, rich veal stock, or good white wine, may be poured to them to form the gravy. To thicken this, a little flour should be dredged upon the fish before it is laid into the mould. Other kinds, such as cod, mullet, mackerel in fillets, salt fish (previously kept at the point of boiling till three parts done, then pulled into flakes and put into the mould with hard eggs sliced, a little cream, flour, butter, cayenne, and anchovy- essence, and baked with mashed parsneps on the top), will all answer well for this pasty. Yeal, when used for it, should be well beaten first; sweetbreads, sliced, may be laid in with it. For a pasty of moderate size, two pounds, or two and a half of meat, and from three to four of potatoes will be sufficient: a quarter-pint of milk or cream, two small teaspoonsful of salt, and from one to two ounces of butter must be mixed up with these last.* A larger proportion of cream and butter well dried into the potatoes over a gentle fire, after they are mashed, will render the crust of the pastry richer, and finer.CHAP. XVI.] PASTRY. 411 CASSEROLE OF RICE. Proceed exactly as for Gabrielle’s pudding (see Chapter XYIIL), but substitute good veal-broth or stock for the milk, and add a couple of ounces more of butter. Fill the casserole when it is emptied, with a rich mince or fricassee, or with stewed oysters in a bechamel-sauce. French cooks make a very trouble- some and elaborate affair of this dish, putting to the rice to make it 46 mellow,” a great deal of pot-top fat, slices of fat ham, &c., which must afterwards be well drained off, or picked out from it. As, however, we have given the receipt, it will be found an excellent dish, and of very elegant appearance, if moulded in a tasteful shape. It must have a quick oven to colour without too much drying it. For a large casserole a pound of rice and a quart of gravy will be required : a bit of bread is sometimes used in filling the mould, cut to the shape, and occupying nearly half the inside, but always so as to leave a thick and compact crust in every part. A GOOD COMMON ENGLISH GAME PIE. Raise the flesh entire from the upper side of the best end of a well-kept neck of venison, trim it to the length of the dish in which the pie is to be served, and rub it with a mixture of salt, cayenne, pounded mace, and nutmeg. Cut down into joints a fine young hare which has hung from eight to fourteen days, bone the back and thighs, and fill them with forcemeat No. 1, (page 170), but put into it a double portion of butter, and a small quantity of minced eschalots, should their flavour be liked, and the raw liver of the hare, chopped small. Line the dish with a rich short crust (see page 405), lay the venison in the centre, and the hare closely round and on it; fill the vacant spaces with more forcemeat, add a few spoonsful of well-jellied gravy, fasten on the cover securely, ornament it or not, at pleasure, and bake the pie two hours in a well heated oven. The remnants and bones of the hare and venison may be stewed down into a small quantity of excellent soup, or with a lessQchap. XVI. MODERN COOKERY. 412 proportion of water into an admirable gravy, part of which, after having been cleared from fat, may be poured into the pie. The jelly, added to its contents at first, can be made, when no such stock is at hand, of a couple of pounds of shin of beef, boiled down in a quart of water, which must be reduced quite half, and seasoned only with a good slice of lean ham, a few peppercorns, seven or eight cloves, a blade of mace, and a little salt. One pound and a half of flour will be sufficient for the crust; this, when it is so preferred, may be laid round the sides only of the dish, instead of entirely over it. The prime joints of a second hare may be substituted for the venison when it can be more conveniently procured. Baked 2 hours. Obs.—These same ingredients will make an excellent raised pie, if the venison be divided and intermixed with the hare; the whole should be highly seasoned, and all the cavities filled with the forcemeat No. 18, (page 181.)* The top, before the paste is laid over, should be covered with slices of fat bacon, or with plenty of butter, to prevent the surface of the meat from becoming hard. No liquid is to be put into the pie until after it is baked, if at all. It will require from half to a full hour more of the oven than if baked in a dish. MODERN CHICKEN PIE. Skin and cut down into joints a couple of fowls, take out all the bones, and season the flesh highly with salt, cayenne, pounded mace, and nutmeg; line a dish with a thin paste, and spread over it a layer of the finest sausage-meat, which has previously been moistened with a spoonful or two of cold water; over this, place closely together, some of the boned chicken joints, then more sausage-meat, and continue thus with alternate layers of each, until the dish is full; roll out, and fasten securely at the edges, a cover half an inch thick, trim off the superfluous paste, make an incision in the top, * The second, or third-mentioned forcemeat of this number is meant; but the sausage-meat can be used, if more convenient.413 PASTRY. CHAP. XVI.] lay some paste leaves round it, glaze the whole with yolk of egg, and bake the pie from an hour and a half to two hours in a well-heated oven. Lay a sheet or two of writing-paper over the crust, should it brown too quickly. Minced herbs can be mixed with the sausage- meat at pleasure, and a small quantity of eschalot also, where the flavour is much liked : it should be well moistened with water, or the whole will be unpalatably dry. The pie may be served hot or cold, but we would rather recommend the latter. A couple of very young tender rabbits will answer exceedingly well for it instead of fowls, and a rim, or half paste in the dish will generally be preferred to an entire lining of the crust, which is now but rarely served, unless for pastry, which is to be taken out of the dish in which it is baked before it is sent to table. A COMMON CHICKEN PIE. Prepare the fowls as for boiling, cut them down into joints, season them with salt, white pepper, and nutmeg, or pounded mace; arrange them neatly in a dish bor- dered with paste, lay amongst them three or four fresh eggs, boiled hard, and cut in halves; pour in some oold water, put on a thick cover, pare the edge, and orna- ment it, make a hole in the centre, lay a roll of paste, or a few leaves round it, and bake the pie in a moderate oven from an hour to an hour and a half. The back and neck bones may be boiled down with a bit or two of lean ham, to make a little additional gravy, which can be poured into the pie after it is baked. PIGEON PIE. Rim a large dish with fine puff-paste, and cover the bottom with a veal cutlet, or tender rump-steak, free from fat and bone, and seasoned with salt, cayenne, and nutmeg, or pounded mace ; prepare with great nicety as many freshly-killed young pigeons as the dish will contain in one layer ; put into each a slice or ball of butter, seasoned with a little cayenne and mace; lay them into the dish with the breasts downwards, and between414 [CHAP. XYI. MODERN COOKERY. and over them put the yolks of half a dozen or more of hard-boiled eggs; stick plenty of butter on them, season the whole well with salt and spice, pour in some cold water or veal-broth for the gravy, roll out the cover three-quarters of an inch thick, secure it well round the edge, ornament it highly, and bake it for an hour or more in a well-heated oven. It is a great improve- ment to fill the birds with small mushroom-buttons, prepared as for partridges (see Chapter XIII.) BEEF-STEAK PIE. From a couple to three pounds of rump-steak will be sufficient, for a good family pie. It should be well kept though perfectly sweet, for in no form can tainted meat be more offensive than when it is enclosed in paste. Trim off the coarse skin, and part of the fat, should there be much of it (many eaters dislike it altogether in pies, and when this is the case, every morsel should be carefully cut away). If the beef should not appear very tender, it may be gently beaten with a paste- roller till the fibre is broken, then divided into slices half as large as the hand, and laid into a dish bordered with paste. It should be seasoned with salt and pepper, or cayenne, and sufficient water poured in to make the gravy, and keep the meat moist. Lay on the cover, and be careful always to brush the edge in every part with egg or cold water, then to join it securely to the paste which is round the rim, trim both off close to the dish, pass the point of the knife through the middle of the cover, lay some slight roll or ornament of paste round it, and decorate the border of the pie in any of the usual modes, which are too common to require description. Send the pie to a well-heated, but not fierce oven for about an hour and twenty minutes. To make a richer beef-steak pie put bearded oysters in alternate layers with the meat, add their strained liquor to a little good gravy, in which the beards may be simmered a few minutes, to give it further flavour, and make a light puff paste for the crust. Some eaters likeCHAP. XVI.] 415 PASTRY. it seasoned with a small portion of minced onion or eschalot when the oysters are omitted. Mushrooms improve all meat-pies. 1 to lj hour. MUTTON PIE. {Common,') A pound and a quarter of flour will make sufficient paste for a moderate-sized pie, and two pounds of mutton freed from the greater portion of the fat will fill it. Butter a dish, and line it with about half the paste rolled thin ; lay in the mutton evenly, and sprinkle ovef it three-quarters of an ounce of salt, and from half to a whole teaspoonful of pepper, according to the taste; pour in cold water to within an inch of the then brim. Boll the cover, which should be quite half an inch thick, to the size of the dish ; wTet the edges of the paste with cold water or white of egg, be careful to close them securely, cut them off close to the rim of the dish, stick the point of the knife through the centre, and bake the pie an hour and a quarter in a well-heated oven.

Lay a half-paste of short or of puff crust round a buttered dish; take the whole or part of a loin of mutton, strip off the fat entirely, and raise the .flesh clear from the bones without dividing it, then slice it into cutlets of equal thickness, season them well with salt and pepper, or cayenne, and strew between the layers some finely minced herbs mixed with two or three eschalots, when the flavour of these last is liked ; or omit them, and roll quite thin some good forcemeat (which can be flavoured with a little minced eschalot at pleasure), and lay it between the cutlets : two or three mutton kidneys intermingled with the meat will greatly[CHAP. XYI. 416 MODERN COOKERY. enrich the gravy; pour in a little cold water, roll the cover half an inch thick, or more should the crust be short, as it will not rise like puff paste, close the pie very securely, trim the edges even with the dish, orna- ment the pie according to the taste, make a hole in the centre and bake it from an hour and a half to a couple of hours. The proportions of paste and meat may be ascertained by consulting the last receipt. Gravy made with part of the bones, quite cleared from fat, and left to become cold, may be used to fill the pie instead of water. RAISED PIES. These may be made of any size, and with any kind of meat, poultry, or game, but the whole must be entirely free from bone. When the crust is not to be eaten, it is made Raised Pie. simply with a few ounces of lard or butter dissolved in boiling water, with which the flour is to be mixed (with a spoon at first, as the heat would be too great for the hands, but afterwards with the fingers) to a smooth and firm paste. The French, who excel greatly in this form of pie,* use for it a good crust which they call a pate brisee (see page 405), and this is eaten usually with the meat which it contains. In either case the paste must be sufficiently stiff to retain its form perfectly after it is raised, as it will have no support to prevent its falling. * We remember having partaken of one which was brought from Bordeaux, and which contained a small boned ham of deli- cious flavour, surmounted by boned partridges, above which were placed fine larks likewise boned ; all the interstices were filled with super-excellent forcemeat; and the whole, being a solid mass of nourishing viands, would have formed an admirable tra- veller’s larder in itself.€HAP. XVI.] 417 PASTRY. The celebrated Monsieur Ude gives the following direc- tions for moulding it to a proper shape without diffi- culty ; and as inexperienced cooks generally find a little at first in giving a good appearance to these pies, we copy his instructions for them : “ Take a lump of paste proportionate to the size of the pie you are to make, mould it in the shape of a sugar loaf, put it upright on the table, then with the palms of your hands flatten the sides of it; when you have equalized it all round and it is quite smooth, squeeze the middle of the point down to half the height of the paste,” then hollow the inside by pressing it with the fingers, and in doing this be careful to keep it in every part of equal thickness. Fill it,* roll out the cover, egg the edges, press them securely together, make a hole in the centre, lay a roll of paste round it, and encircle this with a wreath of leaves, or ornament the pie in any other way, according to the taste; glaze it with well beaten yolk of egg, and bake it from two to three hours in a well heated oven, if it be small, and from four to five hours if it be large, though the time must be regulated in some measure by the nature of the contents, as wTell as by the size of the dish. Ohs.—We know not if we have succeeded in making the reader comprehend that this sort of pie (with the exception of the cover, for which a portion must at first be taken off), is made from one solid lump of paste, which, after having been shaped into a cone, as Monsieur Ude directs, or into a high round, or oval form, is hollowed by pressing down the centre with the knuckles, and continuing to knead the inside equally round with the one hand, while the. other is pressed close to the outside. It is desirable that the mode of doing this should be once seen by the learner, if possi- ble, as mere verbal instructions are scarcely sufficient to * "For the mode of doing this, see observation, page 412, and note, page 116.

XVI. enable the quite-inexperienced cook to comprehend at once the exact form and appearance which should be given to the paste. A VOL-AU-VENT. This dish can be successfully made only with the finest and light- est puff-paste (see Feuilletage, page 402) as its height, which ought to be from four to five inches, depends entirely on its rising in the oven. Roll it to some- thing more than an inch in thickness, and cut it to the shape and size of the inside of the dish in which it is to be served, or stamp it out with a fluted tin of proper dimensions; then mark the cover evenly about an inch from the edge all round, and ornament it and the border also, with a knife, as fancy may direct; brush yolk of egg quickly over them, and put the vol- au-vent immediately into a brisk oven, that it may rise well, and be finely coloured, but do not allow it to be scorched. In from twenty to thirty minutes, should it appear baked through, as well as sufficiently browned, draw it out, and with the point of a knife detach the cover carefully where it has been marked, and scoop out all the soft unbaked crumb from the inside of the vol- au-vent; then turn it gently on to a sheet of clean paper, to drain the butter from it. At. the instant of serving, fill it with a rich fricassee of lobster,% or of sweetbreads, or with turbot a la creme, or with the white part of cold roast veal cut in thin collops not larger than a shilling, and heated in good white sauce with oysters (see minced veal and oysters, page 264), or with any other of the preparations which we shall * For this, the flesh of boiled lobsters requires to be merely heated slowly in some good bechamel, with which the coral of the fish can be blended, as with the sauce of page 129.PINE PASTRY. 419 CHAP. XVI.] indicate in their proper places, and send it immediately to table. The vol-au-vent, as the reader will perceive, is but the case, or crust, in which various kinds of deli- cate ragouts are served in an elegant form. As these are most frequently composed of fish, or of meats which have been already dressed, it is an economical as well as an excellent mode of employing such remains. The sauces in which they are heated must be quite thick, for they would otherwise soften, or even run through the crust. This, we ought to observe, should be exa- mined before it is filled, and should any part appear too thin, fasten on it, with a little egg, a portion of the crumb which has been taken out, and then egg the whole of the inside lightly in order to make the loose parts of the vol-au-vent stick well together. This method is recommended by an admirable and highly experienced cook, but it need only be resorted to when the crust is not solid enough to hold the contents securely. For moderate-sized vol-au-vent, flour, \ lb.; butter, \ lb.; salt, small saltspoonful; yolk, 1 egg; little water. Larger vol-au-vent, f lb. flour ; other ingredients in proportion : baked 20 to 30 minutes. Obs.—When the vol-au-vent is cut out with the fluted cutter, a second, some sizes smaller, after being just dipped into hot water, should be pressed nearly half through the paste, to mark the cover. The border ought to be from three-quarters of an inch to an inch and a half wide. A VOL-AU-YENT OF FRUIT. After the crust has been made and baked as above, fill it at the moment of serving with peaches, apricots, mogul, or any other richly flavoured plums, which have been stewed tender in syrup; lift them from this, and keep them hot while it is boiled rapidly almost to jelly; then arrange the fruit in the vol-au-vent, and pour the syrup over it. For the manner of preparing it, see compotes of fruit, Chapter XX; but increase the proportion of sugar nearly half, that the juice may be420 MODERN COOKERY. [[CHAP, XVI. reduced quickly to the proper consistency for the vol- au- vent. Skin and divide the apricots, and quarter the peaches, unless they should be very small. ENGLISH OYSTER PATTIES. Line some small patty-pans with fine puff-paste, rolled thin, and to preserve their form when baked, put a bit of bread into each ; lay on the covers, pinch and trim the edges, and send the patties to a brisk oven. Plump and beard from two to three dozens of small oysters; mix very smoothly a teaspoonful of flour with an ounce of butter, put them into a clean saucepan, shake them round over a gentle fire, and let them simmer for two or three minutes ; throw in a little salt, pounded mace, and cayenne, then add, by slow degrees, two or three spoonsful of rich cream, give these a boil, and pour in the strained liquor of the oysters; next, lay in the fish, and keep them at the point of boiling for a couple of minutes. Raise the covers from the patties, take out the bread, fill them with the oysters and their sauce, and replace the covers. We have found it an improvement to stew the beards of the fish with a strip or two of lemon-peel, in a little good veal-stock for a quarter of an hour, then to strain and add it to the sauce. The oysters, unless very small, should be once or twice divided. EXCELLENT MEAT ROLLS. Pound, as for potting (see page 356), and with the same proportion of butter and of seasonings, some half- roasted veal, chicken, or turkey. Make some forcemeat by the receipt No. 1, Chapter VI., and form it into small rolls, not larger than a finger; wrap twice or thrice as much of the pounded meat equally round each of these, first moistening it with a teaspoonful of water; fold them in good puff-paste, and bake them from twelve * These patties should be made small, with a thin crust, and be well-filled with the oysters and their sauce. The substitution of fried crumbs for the covers will vary them very agreeably. For lobster patties, prepare the fish as for a vol-au-vent, but cut it smaller.CHAP. XVI.] 421 FINE PASTRY. to fifteen minutes, or until the crust is perfectly done. A small quantity of the lean of a boiled ham may be finely minced and pounded with the veal, and very small mushrooms, prepared as for a partridge (page 337), may be substituted for the forcemeat. PATTIES, TARTLETS, OR, SMALL VOLS-AU-VENTS. These are quickly and easily made with two round paste-cutters, of which one should be little more than half the size of the other: to give the pastry a better appearance, they should be fluted. Roll out some of the lightest puff-paste to a half-inch of thickness, and with the larger of the tins cut the number of patties required; then dip the edge of the small shape into hot water, and press it about half through them. Bake them in a moderately quick oven from ten to twelve minutes, and when they are done, with the point of a sharp knife, take out the small rounds of crust from the tops, and scoop all the crumb from the insides of the patties, which may then be filled with shrimps, oysters, lobster, chicken, pheasant, or any other of the ordinary varieties of patty meat, prepared with white sauce. Fried crumbs may be laid over them instead of the covers, or these last can be replaced. For sweet dishes, glaze the pastry, and fill it with rich whipped cream, preserve, or boiled custard ; if with the last of these, put it back into a very gentle oven till the custards are set. ANOTHER RECEIPT FOR TARTLETS. For a dozen tartlets, cut twenty-four rounds of paste of the usual size, and form twelve of them into rings by pressing the small cutter quite through them ; moisten these with cold water, or white of egg, and lay them on the remainder of the rounds of paste, so as to form the rims of the tartlets. Bake them from ten to twelve mi- nutes, fill them with preserve while they are still warm, and place over it a small ornament of paste cut from the remnants, and baked gently of a light colour. Serve the tartlets cold, or if wanted hot for table, put them back into the oven for a minute after they are filled.MODERN COOKERY. [chap. XYI. 422 A SEFTON, OR, VEAL CUSTARD.

Put a paste border round a dish, pour in first two ounces of clarified butter, and then the other ingredients; bake the sefton in a very slow oven from twenty-five to thirty minutes, or until it is quite firm in the middle, and send it to table with a little good gravy. Very highly flavoured game-stock, in which a few mushrooms have been stewed, may be used for this dish with great advantage in lieu of veal-gravy; and a sauce made of the smallest mushroom-buttons, may be served with it in either case. The mixture can be baked in a whole paste, if preferred so; or in well- buttered cups, then turned out and covered with the sauce before it is sent to table. Rich veal or game-stock, 1 pint; fresh eggs, 6 ; rind, 1 lemon; little salt and cayenne; pounded mace, J teaspoonful; butter, 2 ozs.: baked 25 to 30 minutes, sloiu oven. APPLE CAKE, OR GERMAN TART. Work together with the fingers, ten ounces of butter and a pound of flour, until they resemble fine crumbs of bread; throw in a small pinch of salt, and make them into a firm smooth paste with the yolks of two eggs and a spoonful or two of water. Butter thickly, a plain tin cake or pie-mould (those which open at the sides, see plate, page 401, are best adapted to the purpose) ; roll out the paste thin, place the mould upon it, trim a bit to its exact size, cover the bottom of the mould with this, then cut a band the height of the sides, and press it smoothly round them, joining the edge, which must be moistened with egg or water, to the bottom crust; then stick upon them, to prevent their separation, a narrow and thin band of paste, also moistened. Next, fill the mould nearly to the brim with the following marmalade, which must be quite cold when it is put in. Boil423 PINE PASTRY. CHAP. XVI.] together, over a gentle fire at first, but more quickly afterwards, three pounds of good apples with fourteen ounces of pounded sugar, or of the finest Lisbon, the strained juice of a large lemon, three ounces of the best butter, and a teaspoonful of pounded cinnamon, or the lightly grated rind of a couple of lemons: when the whole is perfectly smooth and dry, turn it into a pan to cool, and let it be quite cold before it is put into the paste. In early autumn, a larger proportion of sugar may be required, but this can be regulated by the taste. When the mould is filled, roll out the cover and lay it carefully over the marmalade that it may not touch it; and when the cake is securely closed, trim off the super- fluous paste, add a little pounded sugar to the parings, spread them out very thin, and cut them into leaves to ornament the top of the cake, round which they may be placed as a sort of wreath.* Bake it for an hour in a moderately brisk oven; take it from the mould, and should the sides not be sufficiently coloured put it back for a few minutes into the oven upon a baking tin. Lay a paper over the top, when it is of a fine light brown, to prevent its being too deeply coloured. This cake should be served hot. Paste: flour, 1 lb.; butter, 10 ozs.; yolks of eggs, 2; little water. Marmalade: apples, 3 lbs.; sugar, 14 ozs. (more if needed); juice of lemon, 1; rinds of lemons, 2; butter, 3 ozs. : baked 1 hour. TOURTE MERINGUEE, OR, TART WITH ROYAL ICING.t Lay a band of fine paste round the rim of a tart-dish, fill it with any kind of fruit mixed with a moderate proportion of sugar, roll out the cover very evenly, * Or, instead of these, fasten on it with a little white of egg, after it is taken from the oven, some ready-baked leaves of almond- paste (see page 426), either plain or coloured. f The limits to which we are obliged to confine this volume, compel us to omit many receipts which we would gladly insert; we have, therefore, rejected those which may be found in almost every English cookery book, for such as are, we apprehend, less known to the reader: this will account for the small number of receipts for pies and fruit tarts, to he found in the present Chapter.424 [CHAP. XVI. MODERN COOKERY. moisten the edges of the paste, press them together care- fully, and trim them off close to the dish; spread equally over the top, to within rather more than an inch of the edge all round, the whites of three fresh eggs beaten to a quite solid froth, and mixed quickly at the moment of using them, with three tablespoonsful of dry sifted sugar. Put the tart into a moderately brisk oven, and when the crust has risen well, and the icing is set, either lay a sheet of writing-paper lightly over it, or draw it to a part of the oven where it will not take too much colour. This is now a fashionable mode of icing tarts, and greatly improves their appearance. Bake half an hour. BARBERRY.TART. Barberries, with half their weight of fine brown sugar, when they are thoroughly ripe, and with two ounces more when they are not quite so, make an admirable tart. For one of moderate size, put into a dish rimmed with paste, three-quarters of a pound of the picked fruit, and six ounces of sugar in alternate layers; pour over them three tablespoonsful of water, put on the cover, and bake the tart half an hour. Another way of making it is, to line a shallow tin pan with very thin crust, to mix the fruit and sugar well together with a spoon, before they are laid in, and to put bars of paste across instead of a cover; or it may be baked without either.* GENOISES A LA REINE, OR, HER MAJESTY’S PASTRY. Make some nouilles (see page 6) with the yolks of four fresh eggs, and when they are all cut, as directed, drop them lightly into a pint and a half of boiling cream (new milk will answer quite as well, or a por- tion of each may be used), in* which six ounces of fresh * The French make all their fruit-tarts thus, in large shallow pans. Plums, split and stoned (or if of small kinds, left entire), cherries and currants stripped from the stalks, and various other fruits, all rolled in plenty of sugar, are baked in the uncovered crust; or this is baked by itself, and then filled afterwards with fruit previously stewed tender.CHAP. XVI.] FINE PASTRY. 425 butter have been dissolved. When these have boiled quickly for a minute or two, during which time they must be stirred to prevent their knotting, add a small pinch of salt and six ounces of sugar, on which the rinds of two lemons have been rasped ; place the sauce- pan over a clear and very gentle fire, and when the mixture has simmered from thirty to forty minutes take it off, stir briskly in the yolks of six eggs, and pour it out upon a delicately clean baking-tin that has been slightly rubbed in every part with butter; level the nouilles with a knife to something less than a quarter- inch of thickness, and let them be very evenly spread; put them into a moderate oven, and bake them of a fine equal brown : should any air-bladders appear, pierce them with the point of a knife. On taking the paste from the oven, divide it into two equal parts; turn one of these, the under-side uppermost, on to a clean tin or large dish, and spread quickly over it ajar of fine apricot- jam, place the other half upon it, the brown side out- wards, and leave the paste to become cold ; then stamp it out with a round or diamond-shaped cutter, and ar- range the genoises tastily in a dish. This pastry will be found delicious the day it is baked, but its excellence is destroyed by keeping. Peach, green-gage, or magnum bonum jam, will serve in lieu of apricot, when more con- venient. We strongly recommend to our readers the above preparation, baked in patty-pans, and served hot; or the whole quantity made into a pudding. From the smaller ones a little may be taken out with a teaspoon, and replaced with some preserve just before they are sent to table; or they may thus be eaten cold. Nouilles of 4 eggs; cream or milk, 1^ pint ; buttei^ 6 ozs.; sugar, 6 ozs.; rasped rinds of lemons, 2 ; grain of salt : 80 to 40 minutes. Yolks of eggs, 6 : baked from 15 to 25 minutes. ALMOND PASTE.

[CHAP. XVI. cold water as they are done, and let them remain in it for an hour or two ; then wipe, and pound them to the finest paste, moistening them occasionally with a few drops of cold water, to prevent their oiling; next, add to, and mix thoroughly with them, seven ounces of highly-refined, dried, and sifted sugar; put them into a small preserving-pan, or enamelled stewpan, and stir them over a clear and very gentle fire until they are so dry as not to adhere to the finger when touched; turn the paste immediately into an earthen pan or jar, and when cold it will be ready for use. Jordan almonds, 7 ozs.; bitter almonds, 1 oz.; cold water, 1 tablespoonful; sugar, 7 ozs. Ohs.—The pan in which the paste is dried, should by no means be placed upon the fire, but high above it on a bar or trevet: should it be allowed by accident to harden too much, it must be sprinkled plentifully with water, broken up quite small, and worked, as it warms, with a strong wooden spoon to a smooth paste again. We have found this method perfectly successful; but, if time will permit, it should be moistened some hours before it is again set over the fire. TARTLETS OF ALMONI) PASTE. Butter slightly the smallest-sized tin patty-pans, and line them with the almond-paste rolled as thin as possible; cut it with a sharp knife close to their edges, and bake or rather dry the tartlets slowly at the mouth of a very cool oven. If at all coloured, they should be only of the palest brown; but they will become per- fectly crisp without losing their whiteness if left for some hours in a very gently-heated stove or oven. They should be taken from the pans when two-thirds done, and laid, reversed, upon a sheet of paper placed on a dish or board, before they are put back into the oven. At the instant of serving fill them with bright- coloured whipped-cream, or with peach or apricot- jam ; if the preserve be used lay over it a small star or other ornament cut from the same paste, and dried with the tartlets. Sifted sugar, instead of flour, must beCHAP. XVI.] PINE PASTRY. 427 dredged upon the board and roller in using almond- paste. Leaves and flowers formed of it, and dried gradually till perfectly crisp, will keep for a long time in a tin box or canister, and they form elegant deco- rations for pastry. When a fluted cutter the size of the pattypans is at hand, it will be an improvement to cut out the paste with it, and then to press it lightly into them, as it is rather apt to break when pared off with a knife. To colour it, prepared cochineal, or spinach-green, must be added to it in the mortar. MINCEMEAT. (Author s Receipt.) To one pound of an unsalted ox-tongue, boiled ten- der and cut free from the rind, add two pounds of fine stoned raisins, two of beef kidney-suet, two pounds and a half of currants well cleaned and dried, two of good apples, two and a half of fine Lisbon sugar, from half to a whole pound of candied peel according to the taste, the grated rinds of two large lemons, and two more boiled quite tender, and chopped up entirely with the exception of the pips, two small nutmegs, half an ounce of salt, a large teaspoonful of pounded mace, rather more of ginger in powder, half a pint of brandy, and as much good sherry or madeira. Mince these ingredients separately, and mix the others all well before the brandy and the wine are added; press the whole into a jar, or jars, and keep it closely covered. It should be stored for a few days before it is used, and will remain good for many weeks. Some persons like a slight flavouring of cloves in addition to the other spices ; others add the juice of two or three lemons, and a larger quantity of brandy. The inside of a tender and well-roasted sirloin of beef will answer quite as well as the tongue.

Take four large lemons, with their weight of golden pippins pared and cored, of jar-raisins, currants, candied citron and orange-rind, and the finest suet, and a fourth part more of pounded sugar. Boil the lemons tender, chop them small, but be careful first to extract all the pips; add them to the other ingredients, after all have been prepared with great nicety, and mix the whole well with from three to four glasses of good brandy. Appor- tion salt and spice by the preceding receipt.* MINCE PIES. Butter some tin pattypans well, and line them evenly with fine puff paste rolled thin; fill them with mince- meat, moisten the edges of the covers, which should be nearly a quarter-inch thick, close the pies carefully, trim off the superfluous paste, make a small aperture in the centre of the crust with a fork or the point of a knife, ice the pies with cold water and sifted sugar, (see page 402) or not, at pleasure, and bake them half an hour in a well-heated oven: lay a paper over them when they are partially done, should they appear likely to take too much colour. \ hour.

This form of pastry (or its name at least) is, we believe, peculiar to the county of Kent, where it is made in abundance, and eaten by all classes of people during Lent. Boil for fifteen minutes three ounces of ground rice* in a pint and a half of new milk, and when taken from the fire, stir into it three ounces of butter, and four of sugar; add to these six well beaten eggs, a grain or two of salt, and a flavouring of nutmeg or lemon-peel at pleasure. When the mixture is nearly cold, line some large patty-pans or some saucers with thin puff paste, fill them with it three parts full, strew the tops thickly with currants which have been cleaned and dried ; and bake the pudding-pies from fifteen to twenty minutes in a moderate oven. Milk, \\ pint; ground rice, 3 ozs.: 15 minutes. Butter, 3 ozs.; sugar, i lb.; nutmeg or lemon-rind; eggs, 6 ; currants, 4 to 6 ozs. : 15 to 20 minutes. PUDDING-PIES. (A commoner kind.) One quart of new milk, five ounces of ground rice, butter, one ounce and a half (or more), four ounces of sugar, half a small nutmeg grated, a pinch of salt, four large eggs, and three ounces of currants.

When a little cooled, add to the nut, and beat well with it, some eggs properly whisked and strained, and the grated rind of half a lemon. Line some patty-pans with fine paste, put in the mixture, and bake the cheese-cakes from thirteen to fifteen minutes.

LEMON CHEESE-CAKES. {Christ-Church-College Receipt.) Rasp the rind of a large lemon with four ounces of fine sugar, then crush, and mix it with the yolks of three eggs, and half the quantity of whites, well- whisked; beat these together thoroughly ; add to them flour tablespoonsful of cream, a quarter of a pound of oiled butter, the strained juice of the lemon,—which must be stirred quickly in by degrees,—and a little orange-flower brandy.

The fan- ehonnettes should be about three inches in length and two in width. In order to lay the second crust over the preserve without disturbing it, wind it lightly round the paste-roller, and in untwisting it, let it fall gently over the other part. This is not the form of pasty called by the French fanchonnettes. Fine puff paste, 1 lb.; apricot or peach jam, 4 to 6 ozs. : baked 20 to 25 minutes. PASTRY SANDWICHES. Divide equally in two, and roll off square and as thin as possible, some rich puff crust ;* lay one-half on a buttered tin, or copper oven-leaf, and spread it lightly with fine currant, strawberry, or raspberry jelly; lay the remaining half closely over, pressing it a little with the rolling-pin after the edges are well cemented toge- ther; then mark it into divisions, and bake it from fifteen to twenty minutes, in a mqderate oven.

Put four tablespoonsful of the best currant-jelly into a basin, and stir to it gradually twelve spoonsful of beaten egg; if the preserve be rich and sweet, no sugar will be required. Line some pans with paste rolled very thin, fill them with the custard, and bake them about ten minutes.* RASPBERRY PUFFS. Roll out thin some fine puff-paste, cut it in rounds or squares of equal size, lay some raspberry jam into each, moisten the edges of the paste, fold and press them together, and bake the puffs from ten to fifteen minutes. Strawberry, or any other jam will serve for them equally well. STORE MIXTURE FOR LEMON TARTLETS, Which will remain good for a year or two. Put into a very clean stewpan or saucepan a quarter- pound of fresh butter, a pound of good sugar, beaten to powder, the yolks of six eggs, and the whites of four, whisked and strained, the grated rinds of two large lemons, and the strained juice of three; keep the whole stirred over a gentle fire until it is as thick as good cream. When it is quite cold, pour it into small jars or pans, and tie paper over it. When required for table, put it into patty-pans lined with thin puff-paste, and bake the cheese-cakes from fifteen to eighteen minutes. This is a very convenient store, especially quite in the country, where it is sometimes difficult to obtain the fresh fruit. The proportions may be varied so that the lemon shall predominate more or less, according to the taste ; and the rinds may be rasped on part of the sugar before it is pounded ; or they may be boiled tender, and * Strawberry or raspberry jelly will answer admirably for these.435 CHAP.

All-the ingredients for puddings should be fresh and of good quality. It is a false economy to use for them such as have been too long stored, as the slightest degree of mustiness or taint in any one of the articles of which they are composed will spoil all that are combined with it. Eggs should always be broken separately into a cup before they are thrown together in the same basin, as a single very bad one will occasion the loss of many, when this precaution is neglected. They should also be cleared from the specks with scrupulous attention, either with the point of a small three pronged fork, while they are in the cup, or by straining the whole through a fine hair sieve, after they are beaten. The perfect sweetness of suet and milk should be especially attended to, before they are mixed into a pudding, as nothing can be more offensive than the first, when it is over-kept, nor worse in its effect than the curdling of the milk, which is the certain result of its being ever so slightly soured. Currants should be cleaned, and raisins stomed with436 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XVII. exceeding care; almonds and spices very finely pounded, and the rinds of oranges or lemons rasped or grated lightly off, that the hitter part of the skin may be avoided, when they are used for this, or for any other class of dishes; if pared, they should be cut as thin as possible. Custard puddings, to have a good appearance, must be simmered only, but without ceasing ; for if boiled in a quick and careless manner, the surface, instead of being smooth and velvety, will be full of holes, or honey- combed, as it is called, and the whey will flow from it and mingle with the sauce. A thickly-buttered sheet of writing-paper should be laid between the custard mix- ture and the cloth, before it is tied over, or the lid of the mould is closed upon it; and the mould itself, or the basin in which it is boiled, and which should always be quite full, must likewise be well buttered ; and after it is lifted from the water, the pudding should be left in it for quite five minutes before it is dished, to prevent its breaking, or spreading about. Batter is much lighter when boiled in a cloth, and allowed full room to swell, than when confined in a mould ; it should be well beaten the instant before it is poured into it, and put into the water immediately after it is securely tied. The cloth should be moist and thickly floured, and the pudding should be sent to table as expeditiously as possible after it is done, as it will quickly become heavy. This applies equally to all puddings made with paste, which are rendered uneata- ble by any delay in serving them after they are ready: they should be opened a little at the top as soon as they are taken from the boiler or stewpan. Plum-puddings, which it is now customary to boil in moulds, are both lighter and less dry, when closely tied in stout cloths well buttered and floured, especially when they are made in part with bread ; but when this is done, care should be taken not to allow them to burn to the bottom of the pan in which they are cooked ; and it is a good plan to lay a plate or dish under them, by way of precaution against this mischance : it will notCHAP. XVII.] BOILED PUDDINGS. 437 then so much matter whether they be kept floating or not. It is thought better to mix these entirely (except the liquid portion of them) the day before they are boiled, and it is perhaps an advantage when they are of large size, to do so, but it is not really necessary for small or common ones. A very little salt improves all sweet puddings, by taking off the insipidity, and bringing out the full flavour of the other ingredients, but its presence should not be in the slightest degree perceptible. When brandy, wine, or lemon-juice is added to them it should be stirred in briskly, and by degrees, quite at last, as it would be likely otherwise to curdle the milk or eggs. Many persons prefer their puddings steamed; but when this is not done, they should be dropped into plenty of boiling water, and be kept well covered with it until they are ready to serve; and the boiling should never be allowed to cease for an instant, for they soon become heavy if it be interrupted. Pudding and dumpling-cloths should not only be laid into plenty of water as soon as they are taken off, and washed afterwards, as we shall direct, but it is essential to their perfect sweetness that they should be well and quickly dried (in the open air if possible), then folded and kept in a clean drawer. We have known them left wet by a careless servant, until, when brought forward for use, they were as offensive almost as meat that had been too long kept. To prevent their ever imparting an unpleasant flavour when used, they should be washed in a lye made with wood-ashes ;* but when, from any circumstance, this cannot be done, and soap is used for them, they should be rinsed, and soaked in abundance of water, which should be changed several times. TO CLEAN CURRANTS FOR PUDDINGS OR CAKES. Put them into a cullender, strew a handful of flour over them, and rub them with the hands to separate the lumps, and to detach the stalks; work them round in the cullender, and shake it well, when the small * For further particulars on this point, see Appendix.MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XVII. 438 stalks and stones will fall through it. Next pour plenty of cold water over the currants, drain, and spread them on a soft cloth, press it over them to absorb the moisture, and then lay them on a very clean oven-tin, or a large dish, and dry them very gradually (or they will become hard), either in a cool oven, or before the fire, taking care in the latter case that they are not placed suffi- ciently near it for the ashes to fall amongst them. When they are perfectly dry, clear them entirely from the remaining stalks, and from every stone that may be amongst them. The best mode of detecting these is, to lay the fruit at the far end of a large white dish, or sheet of paper, and to pass it lightly, and in very small portions, with the fingers, towards oneself, examining it closely as this is done. TO MIX BATTER FOR PUDDING^. Put the flour and salt into a bowl, and stir them to- gether ; whisk the eggs thoroughly, strain them through a fine hair-sieve, and add them very gradually to the flour; for if too much liquid be poured to it at once it will be full of lumps, and it is easy, with care, to keep the batter perfectly smooth. Beat it well, and lightly with the back of a strong wooden spoon, and after the eggs are added thin it with milk to a proper consistency. The whites of the eggs beaten separately to a solid froth, and stirred gently into the mixture the instant before it is tied up for boiling, or before it is put into the oven to be baked, will render it remark- ably light. When fruit is added to the batter it must be made thicker than when it is served plain, or it will sink to the bottom of the pudding. Batter should never stick to the knife when it is sent to table : it will do this both when a sufficient number of eggs are not mixed with it, and when it is not enough cooked. About four eggs to the half pound of flour will make it firm enough to cut smoothlv. SUET-CRUST, FOR MEAT OR FRUIT PUDDINGS. Clear off the skin from some fresh beef kidney-suet,€HAP.

Mix them well together, add half a teaspoonful of salt for meat-puddings, and a third as much for fruit ones, and sufficient cold water to make the whole into a very firm paste; work it smooth, and roll it out of equal thick- ness when it is used. The weight of suet should be taken after it is minced. This crust is so much lighter, and more wholesome than that which is made with butter, that we cannot refrain from recommending it in preference to our readers. Some cooks merely slice the suet in thin shavings, mix it with the flour, and beat the crust with a paste-roller, till the flour and suet are perfectly incorporated. Flour, 2 lbs.; suet, 12 ozs.; salt, 1 teaspoonful; water, 1 pint. BUTTER CRUST FOR PUDDINGS. When suet is disliked for crust, butter must supply its place, but any intermixture of lard is not so well for paste that is to be boiled. Eight ounces to the pound of flour will render it sufficiently rich for most eaters, and less will generally be preferred, rich crust of this kind being more indigestible by far than that which is baked. The butter may be lightly broken into the flour before the W'ater is added, or it may be laid on, and rolled into the paste as for puff-crust. A small portion of salt must be added to it always, and for a meat pudding the same proportion as directed in the preceding receipt.* Flour 1 lb.; butter, 8 ozs.; salt, for fruit puddings, \ saltspoonful; for meat puddings, \ teaspoonful.

Fill it with layers of well-kept rump- steak, neatly trimmed, and seasoned with salt and pepper, or cayenne; pour in some cold water to make the gravy; roll out the cover, moisten the edge, as well as that of the pudding, draw and press them together carefully, fold them over, shake out a cloth which has been dipped in hot water, wrung out, and well-floured, tie it over the pudding, gather the corners together, tie them over the top of the pudding, put it into plenty of fast-boiling water, and let it remain in from three to five hours, according to its size. The instant it is lifted out, stick a fork quite through the middle of the crust to prevent its bursting; remove the cloth quickly, and cut a small round or square in the top to allow the steam to escape, and serve the pudding immediately. Though not considered very admissible to an elegantly served table, this is a favourite dish with many persons, and is said to be in great esteem with Sussex sportsmen, for whom it is often provided in preference to fare which requires greater exactness in the time of cooking, as an additional hour’s boiling, or even more, will have little effect on a large * It is now customary in many families to have both meat and fruit puddings boiled, and served in pie or tart-dishes. They are lined entirely with very thin crust, or merely rimmed with it, according to taste; then filled, closed, and cooked in the usual manner. The plan is a good and convenient one, where the light upper-crust is preferred to the heavy and sodden part which is under the meat. In Kent and Sussex, shallow pans, in form somewhat resembling a large deep saucer, are sold expressly for boiling meat puddings.CHAP. XVII.] 441 BOILED PUDDINGS. pudding of this kind, beyond reducing the quantity of gravy, and rendering it very thick. Some cooks flour the meat slightly before it is laid into the crust, but we do not think it an improvement: where fat is liked, a portion may be added with the lean, but all skin and sinew should be carefully rejected. Beat the steak with a paste roller, should it not appear to be perfectly tender, and divide it into portions about the size of two fingers. Two or three dozens of oysters, bearded and washed free from grit in their own liquor, (which should afterwards be strained and poured into the pudding,) may be intermingled with the meat. A true epicurean receipt for this dish, directs the crust to be made with wa/-kidney suet, and filled with alternate layers of the inside of the sirloin, sliced and seasoned, and fine plump native oysters, intermixed with an occasional small slice of the veal fat. SMALL BEEF-STEAK PUDDING.* Make into a very firm, smooth paste, one pound of flour, six ounces of beef-suet, finely minced, half a tea- spoonful of salt, and half a pint of cold water. Line with this, a basin which holds a pint and a half. Sea- son a pound of tender steak, free from bone and skin, with half an ounce of salt, and half a teaspoonful of pepper well mixed together; lay it in the crust, pour in a quarter-pint of water, roll out the cover, close the pudding carefully, tie a floured cloth over, and boil it three hours and a half. We give this receipt in addi- tion to the preceding one, as an exact guide for the proportions of meat-puddings in general. Flour, 1 lb.; suet, 6 ozs.; salt, | teaspoonful; water, * To make Ruth Pinch's celebrated pudding (known also as beef-steak pudding a la Dickens), substitute six ounces of butter for the suet in this receipt, and moisten the paste with the well- beaten yolks of four eggs, or with three whole ones, mixed with a little water ; butter the basin very thickly before the crust is laid in, as the pudding is to be turned out of it for table. In all else jrjceed exactly as above.442 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XVII. \ pint; rump-steak, 1 lb.; salt, J oz.; pepper, J tea- spoonful ; water, J pint : 8 J hours. SUPERLATIVE BEEF-PUDDING. Take a fine woodcock that is ready for the spit, and put it into the middle of a large beef-pudding, laying the meat under, over, and round it; finish it as usual, and boil it four hours or more: the fine flavour of the bird will pervade the whole contents of the pudding. PARTRIDGE PUDDING. Skin a couple of well-kept partridges and cut them down into joints; line a deep basin with ‘suet crust, observing the directions given in the preceding receipts ; lay in the birds, which should be rather highly seasoned with pepper or cayenne, and moderately with salt; pour in water for the gravy, close the pudding with care, and boil it from three hours to three and a half. The true flavour of the game is admirably preserved by this mode of cooking. When mushrooms are plentiful, put a layer of buttons, or small flaps, cleaned as for pickling, alternately with a layer of partridge, in filling the pudding, which will then be most excellent eating : the crust may be left untouched, and merely emptied of its contents, where it is objected to, or its place may be supplied with a richer one made of butter. A season- ing of pounded mace or nutmeg can be used at discre- tion. Puddings of veal, chickens, and young rabbits, may all be made by this receipt, or wdth the addition of oysters, which we have already noticed. COMMON BATTER PUDDING. Beat four eggs thoroughly, mix with them half a pint of milk, and pass them through a sieve, add them by degrees to half a pound of flour, and when the batter is perfectly smooth, thin it with another half pint of milk. Shake out a wet pudding cloth, flour it well, pour the batter in, leave it room to swell, tie it securely, and put it directly into plenty of fast-boiling water. An hour and ten minutes will boil it. Send it to table theCHAP. XVII.] BOILED PUDDINGS. 443 instant it is dished, with wine-sauce, a hot compote of fruit, or raspberry vinegar: this last makes a delicious pudding-sauce. Unless the liquid be added very gra- dually to the flour, and the mixture be well stirred and beaten as each portion is poured to it, the batter will not be smooth : to render it very light, a portion of the wdiites of the eggs, or the whole of them, should be whisked to a froth and stirred into it just before it is put into the cloth. Flour, J- lb.; eggs, 4 ; salt, f teaspoonful; milk, 1 pint: 1 hour and 10 minutes. Obs.—Modern taste is in favour of puddings boiled in moulds, but they are seldom or ever so light as those which are tied in cloths only : tliis^ particularly applies to batter, and to plum-puddings. Where appearance is the first consideration we would recommend the use of the moulds, of course. ANOTHER BATTER PUDDING. Mix the yolks of three eggs smoothly with three heaped tablespoonsful of flour, thin the batter with new milk till it is of the consistency of cream, whisk the whites of eggs, apart, stir them into the batter, and boil the pudding in a floured cloth or buttered basin for an hour. Before it is served, cut the top quickly into large dice, half through the pudding, pour over it a small jarful of fine currant, raspberry, or strawberry jelly, and send it to table without delay. Flour, 3 tablespoonsful; eggs, 3; salt, J teaspoonful; milk, from J to a whole pint: 1 hour. Obs.—For a very large pudding, double the quantity of ingredients and the time of boiling will be required. BLACK-CAP PUDDING. Make a good light thin batter, and just before it is poured into the cloth stir to it half a pound of currants, well cleaned and dried; these will sink to the lower part of the pudding and blacken the surface. Boil it the usual time, and dish it with the dark side upper-444 [CHAP. XVII. MODERN COOKERY. most; send very sweet sauce to table with it. Some cooks butter a mould thickly, strew in the currants, and pour the batter on them, which produces the same appearance as when the ingredients are tied in a cloth. BATTER FRUIT PUDDING. Butter thickly a basin which holds a pint and a half, and fill it nearly to the brim with good boiling apples pared, cored, and quartered: pour over them a batter made with four tablespoonsful of flour, two large or three small eggs, and half a pint of milk. Tie a buttered and floured cloth over the basin, which ought to be quite full, and boil the pudding an hour and a quarter. Turn it into a hot dish when done, and strew sugar thickly over it: this, if added to the batter at first renders it heavy. Morelia cherries make a very supe- rior pudding of this kind ; and green gooseberries, dam- sons, and various other fruits, answer for it extremely well: the time of boiling it must be varied according to their quality and its size. For a pint and half mould or basin filled to the brim with apples or other fruit; flour, 4 tablespoonsful; eggs, 2 large or 3 small; milk, \ pint: 1 \ hour. Ohs.—Apples cored, halved, and mixed with a good batter, make an excellent baked pudding, as well as red currants, cherries, and plums of different sorts. KENTISH SUET PUDDING. To a pound and a quarter of flour put half a pound of finely minced beef-suet,* half a teaspoonful of salt, and a quarter one of pepper; mix these into a smooth paste, with one egg well beaten, and a little cold milk or water; make it into the shape of a paste-roller, fold a floured cloth round it, tie the end tightly, and boil it for a couple of hours. In Kent this pudding is usually sent to table with boiled beef, and is sometimes cooked with it * A very common fault with bad and careless cooks is, that of using- for paste and puddings suet coarsely chopped, which is, to many eaters, distasteful to the last degree.445 CHAP. XVII.} BOILED PUDDINGS. also. It is very good sliced and broiled, or browned in a Dutch oven, after having become quite cold. Flour, 11 lb.; suet, l lb. ; salt, ~ teaspoonful; half as much pepper; 1 egg; little milk or water : boiled 2 hours. ANOTHER SUET PUDDING. Make into a somewhat lithe, but smooth paste, half a pound of fine stale bread-crumbs, three-quarters of a pound of flour, from ten to twelve ounces of beef-suet, chopped extremely small, a large half-teaspoonful of salt, and rather less of pepper, with two eggs and a little milk. Boil it two hours and a quarter. A CHEAP SUET PUDDING. With a pound of flour mix well an equal weight of good potatoes boiled and grated (or prepared by Captain Kater’s receipt, page 362), a quarter-pound of suet, and a small teaspoonful of salt. Make these into a stiff batter, with milk, and boil it one hour in a well-floured cloth. APPLE, CURRANT, CHERRY, OR OTHER FRESH FRUIT PUDDING. Make a paste as for a beef-steak pudding, either with suet or butter ; lay into a basin a well floured cloth, which has been dipped into hot water, wrung dry, and shaken out; roll the paste thin, press it evenly into the basin upon the cloth, fill it with apples, pared, cored, and quartered; or with any other fruit; put on the cover, taking care to moisten the edges of the paste, to press them well together, and fold them over; gather up the ends of the cloth, and tie it firmly close to the pudding, which should then be dropped into plenty of fast-boiling water. When it is done, lift it out by twisting a strong fork into the corner of the cloth, turn it gently into the dish in which it is to be served, and cut immediately a small round or square from the top, or the pudding will quickly become heavy; send it to table without the[CHAP. XVII, 44 6 MODERN COOKERY. Richer pudding: flour, 1 lb; butter, \ lb.; in slightest delay, accompanied by pounded, and by good Lisbon sugar, as many persons prefer the latter, from its imparting a more mellowed flavour to the fruit. A small slice of fresh butter, and some finely grated nutmeg are usually considered improvements to an apple-pudding; the juice, and the grated rind of a lemon may be added with good effect, when the fruit is laid into the crust, especially in spring, when the apples generally will have become insipid in their flavour. When puddings are preferred boiled in moulds or basins, these must be thickly buttered before the paste is laid into them, and the puddings must be turned from them gently, that they may not burst. Currant, gooseberry, or cherry-pudding, 1 to 1J hour. Greengage, damson, mussel, or other plum, 1 to 1^ hour. Apple-pudding from 1 to 2 hours, according to its size, ancl the time of year. Obs.—If made of codlings, an apple-pudding will require only so much boiling as may be needed for the crust. A COMMON APPLE PUDDING. Make a light crust with one pound of flour, and six ounces of very finely-minced beef-suet, roll it thin, and fill it with one pound and a quarter of good boiling apples; add the grated rind and strained juice of a small lemon, tie it in a cloth, and boil it one hour and twenty minutes before Christmas, and from twenty to thirty minutes longer after Christmas. A small slice of fresh butter, stirred into it when it is sweetened will, to many tastes, be an acceptable addition ; grated nutmeg, or a little cinnamon, in fine powder, may be substituted for the lemon-rind when either is preferred. To convert this into a richer pudding, use half a pound of butter for the crust, and add to the apples a spoonful or two of orange, or of quince marmalade. Crust: flour, 1 lb.; suet, 6 ozs. Fruit, pared and cored, 1J lb.; juice and rind of 1 small lemon (or some nutmeg or cinnamon in powder).447 BOILED PUDDINGS. CHAP.

Infuse in a pint of new milk half a pod of vanilla, cut into short lengths, and bruised ; simmer them gently together for twenty minutes, and strain the milk through muslin to half a pint of cream; put these again on the fire in a clean saucepan, with three ounces of fine sugar, and pour them when they boil to the beaten yolks of eight very fresh eggs. Stir the mixture often, till it is nearly or quite cold, and boil it as gently as possible for an hour in a well buttered mould or basin that will just hold it. Let it stand for four minutes at least before it is turned out; dish it carefully, strew, and garnish it thickly with bunches of preserved barberries, or send it to table with a rich syrup of fresh fruit, or with clear fruit-jelly, melted. We have had often a compote (see Sweet Dishes) of currants, cherries, or plums served, and greatly relished with this pudding, which we can recommend to our readers as an extremely delicate one. The flavouring may be varied with bitter almonds, lemon-rind, noyeau, or aught else which may be better liked than the vanilla. New milk, 1 pint; vanilla, \ pod: 20 minutes. Cream, \ pint; sugar, 3 ozs.; yolks of eggs, 8: 1 hour. Obs.—The cook must be reminded that unless the eggs be stirred briskly as the boiling milk is gradually poured to them, they will be likely to curdle. A buttered paper should always be put over the basin before the cloth is tied on, for alb custard puddings. SMALL CUSTARD PUDDING. Aldeburgh 'White Lion Receipt. Dissolve in half a pint of new milk a dessertspoonful of pounded sugar, and pour it to three well-beaten eggs; strain the mixture into a buttered basin, which should be full; lay a half sheet of buttered writing paper, and then a floured cloth over it, and tie them tightly on;448 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XVII. boil the pudding gently for twenty-five minutes, and let it stand four or five more before it is turned out, that it may not spread in the dish. Serve it with wine sauce. New milk, J pint; sugar, 1 dessertspoonful; fresh eggs, 3 : 25 minutes. COMMON CUSTARD PUDDING. Beat three eggs, whisk and put them into a pint basin, add to them sufficient milk to fill it; then strain, flavour and sweeten it with fine sugar; boil the pudding very softly for an exact half hour, let it stand a few minutes, dish, and serve it with sugar sifted over, and sweet sauce in a tureen, or send stewed gooseberries, currants, or cher- ries to table with it. A small quantity of lemon-brandy, or of ratifia can be added, to give it flavour, when it is made, or the sugar with which it is sweetened may be rasped on a lemon or orange, then crushed and dissolved in the milk ; from an ounce and a half to two ounces will be sufficient for general taste. PRINCE ALBERTS PUDDING. Beat to a cream half a pound of fresh butter,* and mix with it by degrees an equal quantity of pounded loaf- sugar, dried and sifted ; add to these, after they have been well beaten together, first the yolks, and then the whites of five fresh eggs, which have been thoroughly whisked apart; now strew lightly in half a pound of the finest flour, dried and sifted, and last of all, half a pound of jar raisins weighed after they are stoned. Put these ingredients, perfectly mixed, into a well-buttered mould, or floured cloth, and boil the pudding three hours. Serve it with punch-sauce. We recommend a little pounded mace, or the grated rind of a small lemon, to vary the flavour of this excellent pudding; and that when a mould is used, slices of candied peel should be laid rather thickly over it after it is buttered. • _ *■ * The ingredients may be mixed like those of the Sutherland puddings, page 472, with as good an effedt, the raisins being- thrown in last.CHAP.

Stew, till very tender and dry, three ounces of whole rice in a pint and a quarter of milk; when a little cooled, mix with it three ounces of beef-suet, finely chopped, two ounces and a half of sugar, an ounce of candied orange or lemon-peel, six ounces of sultana raisins, and three large eggs well beaten and strained. Bpil the pudding in a buttered basin, or in a well- floured cloth, for two hours and a quarter, and serve it with the following sauce:—-Dissolve an ounce and a half of sugar broken small in two glasses of sherry, or of any other white wine, and stir them, when quite hot, to the beaten yolks of three fresh eggs; then stir the sauce in a small saucepan held high above, the fire until it resembles custard, but by no means allow it to boil, or it will instantly curdle ; pour it over the pudding, or, if preferred, send it to table in a tureen. We think a full teaspoonful of lemon-juice added to the wine an improvement to this sauce, /which is excellent; and we can recommend the pudding also to our readers. Milk, l \ pint; rice, 3 ozs. : 1 hour, or more. Suet, 3 ozs.; sugar, 2J- ozs. ; candied peel, 1 oz.; sultana raisins, 6 ozs. ; eggs, 3 large : 2^ hours. Sauce.— Sherry, 2 glasses; sugar, 3 J oz.; yolks of eggs, 3; little lemon-juice. We have already, in a previous part of the volume, directed that the German sauce should be milled to a fine froth, and poured upon the pudding with which it is served : when this is not done, the quantity should be increased. A CABINET PUDDING. Split and stone three dozens of fine jar raisins, or take an equal number of dried cherries, and place either of them regularly, in a sort of pattern, in a thickly-buttered plain quart mould or basin; next, slice and lay into it three penny sponge-cakes, add to these two ounces of G GMODERN COOKERY.

Steam the pudding, or boil it very gently for one hour; let it stand a few minutes before it is dished that it may not break ; and serve it with good wine or brandy sauce. Jar raisins, or dried cherries, 3 dozens (quart mould or basin) ; sponge-biscuits, 3 ; maccaroons, 4; ratifias, 2 ozs.; candied citron, 1J oz.; yolks of 4 eggs, whites of 3 ; new milk, ^ pint; cream, J pint; sugar, 2| ozs. ; steamed or boiled, 1 hour. Ohs.—We have given this receipt, for which we are indebted to a friend, without any variation from the original, because on testing it we have found it very exact with regard to quantity and time; but though an extremely delicate and excellent pudding, a little fla- vouring would, we think, improve it: a small portion of the milk might be omitted, and its place supplied by ratifia, lemon-brandy, or ought else that should be preferred. A VERY FINE CABINET PUDDING. Butter thickly a mould of the same size as for the preceding pudding, and ornament it tastefully with dried cherries, or if these are not procurable, with the finest bloom raisins opened and stoned; lay lightly into it a quarter-pound of sponge-biscuit cut in slices, and intermixed with an equal weight of ratifias; sweeten with three ounces of sugar in lumps, and flavour highly with vanilla, or with the thin rind of half a fine lemon, and six sound bitter almonds bruised (should these be preferred), three-quarters of a pint of thin cream, or of cream and new milk mixed; strain and pour this hot to the well-beaten yolks of six eggs and the whites of two, and when the mixture is nearly cold, throw in graduallyBOILED PUDDINGS. 451 CHAP.

Never omit a buttered paper over any sort of custard-mixture ; and remember that quick-boiling will destroy the good appearance of this kind of pudding. The liquid should be quite cold before it is added to the cakes, or the butter on the mould would melt off, and the decorations with it: preserved ginger, and candied citron in slices, may be- used to vary these, and the syrup of the former may be added to give flavour to the other ingredients.

Add to them in very small portions at first, or they will be lumpy, the yolks of seven fresh eggs, and the whites of two well beaten; then throw in gradually four ounces of pounded and sifted sugar, and whisk the mixture thoroughly till it looks very light ; next, strew in, continuing the whisking, four ounces of fine bread-crumbs, and the grated rind of a lemon ; and last of all, add four ounces of just-liquid butter, which must, by no. means, be heated more than enough to dissolve it, and which must be poured in by slow degrees, and beaten thoroughly to the other ingre- dients, till there is no appearance of it left.

VERY GOOD RAISIN PUDDING. To three-quarters of a pound of flour add four ounces of fine crumbs of bread, one pound of beef-suet, a pound and six ounces of raisins, weighed after they are stoned, a quarter-teaspoonful of salt, rather more of ginger, half a nutmeg, an ounce and a half of candied peel, and four large or five small eggs, beaten, strained, and mixed with a cupful of milk, or as much more as will make the whole of the consistency of a very thick batter. Pour the mixture into a well floured cloth of close texture, that has been previously dipped into hot water, wrung, and shaken out. Boil the pudding in ' plenty of water for four hours and a half. It may be served with very sweet wine, or punch-sauce; but if made as we have directed, will be much lighter than if sugar be mixed with the other ingredients before it is boiled; and we have found it generally preferred to a richer plum-pudding.

Butter thickly a plain mould or basin, and line it entirely with slices of cold plum or raisin pudding, cut so as to join closely and neatly together; fill it quite with a good custard, lay first a buttered paper, and then a floured cloth over it, tie them securely, and boil the pudding gently for an hour; let it stand ten minutes after it is taken up before it is turned out of the mould. This is a more tasteful mode of serving the remains of a plum-pudding than the usual one of broiling them in slices, or converting them into fritters. The German sauce, well milled or frothed, is generally much re- lished with sweet boiled-puddings, and adds greatly to their good appearance; but common wine, or punch- sauce, may be sent to table with the above quite as appropriately.

Mix with a pound of suet finely chopped a pound of stoned raisins, five ounces of flour, two tablespoons- ral of sugar, five eggs, a small pinch of salt, and half a nutmeg grated. Tie the pudding in a well-floured cloth, and boil it five hours. This receipt comes to us so highly recommended by persons who have the pudding often served at their table, that we may safely venture, we think, to insert it without testing it. SMALL LIGHT PLUM PUDDING. Put half a pint of fine bread-crumbs into a basin, and pour on them a quarter-pint of boiling milk ; put a plate over them, and let them soak for half an hour ; then mix with them half a pint of suet chopped ex- tremely small, rather more of stoned raisins, three tea- spoonsful of sugar, one of flour, three eggs, a tiny pinch of salt, aud sufficient grated lemon-peel or nut- meg to flavour it lightly.

Mix well together one pound of smoothly-mashed potatoes, half a pound of carrots boiled quite tender, and beaten to a paste, one pound of flour, one of currants, and ,one of raisins (full weight after they are stoned), three-quarters of a pound of sugar, eight ounces of suet, one nutmeg, and a quarter-teaspoonful of salt. Put the pudding into a well-floured cloth, tie it closely, and boil it four hours. The correspondent to whom we are indebted for this receipt, says, that the cost of the ingre- dients does not exceed half a crown, and that the pud- ding is of sufficient size for a party of sixteen persons. We can vouch for its excellence, but as it is rather apt to break when turned out of the cloth, a couple of eggs would perhaps improve it. Sweetmeats, brandy, and spices can be added at pleasure. Mashed potatoes, 1 lb.; carrots, 8 ozs.; flour, 1 lb. ; suet, \ lb.; sugar, f lb.; currants and raisins, 1 lb. each ; nutmeg, 1 ; little salt: 4 hours. AN EXCELLENT SMALL MINCEMEAT PUDDING. Pour on an ounce of bread-crumbs sufficient boiling milk to soak them well; when they are nearly cold drain as much of it from them as you can, and mix them thoroughly with half a pound of mincemeat, a dessert- spoonful of brandy, and three eggs beaten and strained. Boil the pudding for two hours in a well-buttered basin, which should be full, and serve it with sauce made with a little melted butter, half a glass of white wine, a table- spoonful of brandy, half as much lemon-juice, and suffi- cient sugar to make it tolerably sweet.

Mix and beat these ingredients well together, tie them tightly in a thickly floured cloth, and boil them for three hours and half. We can recom- mend this as a remarkably light small rich pudding : it may be served with German wine, or punch-sauce.

A WELL PUDDING. Make into a firm smooth paste, with cold water, one pound of flour, six ounces of finely-minced beef-suet, three quarters of a pound of currants, and a small pinch of salt, thoroughly mixed together. Form into a ball six ounces of good butter, and enclose it securely in about a third of the paste (rolled to a half-inch of thickness,) in the same way that an apple-dumpling is made; roll out the remainder of the paste, and place the portion containing the butter in the centre of it, with the part where the edge was drawn together turned downwards; gather the outer crust round it, and after having moistened the edge, close it with great care. Tie the pudding tightly in a well-floured cloth, and boil it for two hours and a half. It must be dished with caution that it may not break, and a small bit must be cut directly from the top, as in a meat-pudding. (See page 440). This is a very favourite pudding in some parts of England; the only difficulty in making or serving it is to prevent the escape of the butter, which, if properly secured, will be found in a liquid state in the inside, on opening it. Some timid cooks fold it in three coverings458 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XVII. of paste, the better to guard against its bursting through, but there is no danger of this if the edges of the crust be well closed. When suet is objected to, seven ounces of butter may be substituted for it. The currants are occasionally omitted. Flour, 1 lb.; suet, 6 ozs.; currants, f lb.; salt, small pinch; ball of butter, 6 ozs. : 2-L hours. ROLLED PUDDING. Roll out thin a bit of light puff-paste, or a good suet crust, and spread equally over it to within an inch of the edge, any kind of fruit jam. Orange marmalade, and mincemeat make excellent varieties of this pudding ; and a deep layer of fine brown sugar, flavoured with the grated rind and strained juice of one very large, or of two small, lemons, answers for it extremely well. Roll it up carefully, pinch the paste together at the ends, fold a cloth round, secure it well at the ends, and boil the pudding from one to two hours, according to its size and the nature of the ingredients.* BREAD PUDDING. Sweeten a pint of new milk with three ounces of fine sugar, throw in a few grains of salt, and pour it boiling on half a pound of fine, and lightly-grated bread-crumbs, add an ounce of fresh butter, and cover them with a plate, let them remain for half an hour or more, stir to them four large well whisked eggs, and a flavouring of nutmeg, or lemon-rind; pour the mixture into a thickly- buttered mould or basin, which holds a pint and a half, and which ought to be quite full; tie a paper and cloth tightly over, and boil the pudding exactly an hour and ten minutes. This is quite a plain receipt, but by omitting two ounces of the bread, and adding more butter, one egg, a small glass of brandy, the grated rind of a lemon, and as much sugar as will sweeten the whole richly, a very excellent pudding will be obtained; candid orange-peel also has a good effect when sliced * Half a pound of flour made into a paste with suet or butter, and covered with preserve, will be sufficiently boiled in an hour and a quarter.CHAP.

Mix these ingredients thoroughly, and boil the pudding in a cloth for three hours and a half. Send wine sauce to table with it. The grated rind of a large lemon may be added with good effect.

An ounce and a half of candied orange-rind will improve it much, and a couple of ounces of butter may be added to enrich it, when the receipt without is considered too simple. It is excellent when made with milk highly flavoured with cocoa-nut (see Chapter XX). Whole rice, 44 ozs.; new milk, (or cocoa-nut-fla- voured milk), 1 \ pint; sugar, 3 to 4 ozs.; salt, a few grains; bitter almonds, 4 to 6 ; rind of \ lemon ; eggs, 4 : boiled 1 hour. CHEAP RICE PUDDING. Wash six ounces of rice, mix it with three-quarters of a pound of raisins, tie them in a well-floured cloth, giving them plenty of room to swell; boil them exactly an hour and three-quarters, and serve the pudding with very sweet sauce : this is a nice dish for the nursery. A pound of apples pared, cored, and quartered, will also make a very wholesome pudding, mixed with the rice, and boiled from an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half. Rice, 6 ozs.; raisins, \ lb.: 2 hours. Or, rice, 6 ozs.; apples, 1 lb. : 1^ to 1^ hour. RICE-AND-GOOSEBERRY PUDDING. Spread six ounces of rice equally over a moist and well-floured pudding-cloth, and place on it a pint of green gooseberries, measured after the heads and stalks have been trimmed off them. Gather the cloth up care- fully round the fruit, give room for the rice to swell, and boil the pudding for an hour and a quarter. Very sweet auce, or plenty of sugar must be eaten with it.

(An American Receipt.') u In the manner of composition, mode of cooking, and saucing, the good housewife must proceed in the461 CHAP. XVII.] BOILED PUDDINGS. same way as she would for an apple dumpling, with this exception, care must be taken in paring the tomata not to extract the seed, nor break the meat in the operation of skinning it. We have eaten tomatas raw without any thing;—cut up with pepper, salt, vinegar, and mustard ;—fried in butter and in lard ;—broiled and basted with butter;—stewed with and without bread, with cream and with butter;—and, with a clear con- science, we can say, we like them in every way they have ever been fixed for the palate ; but of all the modes of dressing them, known to us, we prefer them when cooked in dumplings, for to us it appears that the steam- ing they receive in their dough-envelope increases in a very high degree that delicate spicy flavour which even in their uncooked state make them such decided favourites with the epicure.” Ohs.—It is possible that the tomata, which is, we know, abundantly grown and served in a great variety of forms in America, may there, either from a difference of climate, or from some advantages of culture, be pro- duced in greater perfection than with us, and possess really “ the delicate spicy flavour ” attributed to it in our receipt, but which we cannot say we have ever yet discovered here; nor have we put its excellence for pud- dings to the proof, though some of our readers may like to do so. FASHIONABLE APPLE DUMPLINGS. These are boiled in small knitted or closely-netted cloths (the former have, we think, the prettiest effect), which give quite an ornamental appearance to an other- wise homely dish. Take out the cores without dividing the apples, which should be large, and of a good boiling sort, and fill the cavity with orange or lemon marmalade, enclose them in a good crust rolled thin, draw the cloths round them, tie them closely and boil them three- quarters of an hour. Lemon dumplings may be boiled in the same way. | to 1 hour, if the apples be not of the best boiling kind.462 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XVII. ORANGE SNOVY-BALLS. Pick and wash half a pound of rice, put it into plenty of water, and boil it rather quickly for ten minutes, drain it well, and let it cool. Pare four large, or five small oranges, and clear from them entirely the thick white inner skin ; spread the rice, in as many equal' portions as there are oranges, upon some pudding or dumpling- cloths ; tie the fruit separately in these, and boil the snow-balls for an hour and a half; turn them carefully on to a dish, and strew plenty of sifted sugar over them. Rice, 8 ozs.; China oranges, 5 ; 1 \ hour. APPLE SNOW-BALLS. Pare and core some large pudding-apples, without dividing them, prepare the rice as in the foregoing re- ceipt, enclose them in it, and boil them one hour : ten minutes less will be sufficient should the fruit be but of moderate size. An agreeable addition to them is a slice of fresh butter, mixed with as much sugar as can be smoothly blended with it, and a flavouring of powdered cinnamon, or of nutmeg : this must be sent to table apart from them, not in the dish. LIGHT CURRANT DUMPLINGS. For each dumpling take three tablespoonsful of flour, two of finely-chopped suet, and three of currants; a slight pinch of salt, and as much milk or water as will make a thick batter of the ingredients. Tie the dum- plings in well-floured cloths, and boil them a full hour: they may be served with very sweet wine-sauce. LEMON DUMPLINGS. Mix, with ten ounces of fine bread-crumbs, half a pound of beef-suet, chopped extremely small, one large tablespoonful of flour, the grated rind of two small lemons, or of a very large one, four ounces of pounded sugar, three large, or four small eggs beaten andCHAP. XVII.] 463 BOILED PUDDINGS. strained, and last of all the juice of the lemons, also strained. Divide these into four equal portions, tie them in well-floured cloths, and boil them an hour. The dumplings will be extremely light and delicate ; if wished very sweet more sugar must be added to them. SUFFOLK, OR HARD DUMPLINGS. Mix a little salt with some flour, and make it into a smooth and rather lithe paste, with cold water or skimmed milk; form it into dumplings, and throw them into boiling water: in half an hour they will be ready to serve. A better kind of dumpling is made by adding sufficient milk to the flour to form a thick bat- ter, and then tying the dumplings in small wTell-floured cloths. In Suffolk farmrhouses they are served with the dripping-pan gravy of roast meat; and they are sometimes made very small indeed, and boiled with stewed shin of beef. NORFOLK DUMPLINGS. Take a pound of dough from a baking of very light white bread, and divide it into six equal parts; mould these into dumplings, drop them into a pan of fast- boiling water, and boil them quickly from twelve to fifteen minutes. Send them to table the instant they are dished, with wine-sauce or raspberry vinegar. In some counties they are eaten with melted butter well sweetened, and mixed with a little vinegar. They must never be cut, but should be torn apart with a couple of forks. BOILED RICE TO BE SERVED WITH STEWED FRUITS, PRESERVES, OR RASPBERRY VINEGAR. Take out the unhusked grains from half a pound of good rice, and wash it in several waters, tie it very loosely in a pudding cloth and boil it for three-quarters of an hour; it will then be quite solid, and resemble a pudding in appearance. Sufficient room must be given to allow" the grain to swell to its full size, or it will be464 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XVIII. hard; but too much space will render the whole watery. With a little experience the cook will easily ascertain the exact degree to be allowed for it. Four ounces of rice will require quite half an hour’s boiling; a little more or less of time will sometimes be needed, from the difference of quality in the grain.

We have little to add here to the remarks which will be found at the commencement of the preceding Chapter, as they will apply equally to the preparations of these and of boiled puddings. All of the custard kind, wdiether made of eggs and milk only, or of sago, arrow-root, rice, ground or in grain, vermicelli, &c., require a very gentle oven, and are spoiled by fast-baking. Those made of batter, on the contrary, should be put into one sufficiently brisk to raise them quickly, but without scorching them. Such as contain suet and raisins must have a well-heated, but not a fierce oven, for as they must remain long in it to be thoroughly done, unless carefully managed, they will be either much too highly coloured, or too dry. By whisking to a solid froth the whites of the eggs46*5 BAKED PUDDINGS. CHAP. XVIII.]] used for any pudding, and stirring them softly into it at the instant of placing it in the oven, it will be ren- dered exceedingly light, and will rise very high in the dish; but as it will partake then of the nature of a souffle, it must be despatched with great expedition to table from the oven, or it will become flat before it is served. When a pudding is sufficiently browned on the sur- face (that is to say, of a fine equal amber-colour) before it is baked through, a sheet of writing paper should be laid over it, but not before it is set: when quite firm in the centre, it will be done. Potatoe, batter, plum, and every other kind of pud- ding indeed, which is sufficiently solid to allow of it, should, be turned reversed on to a clean hot dish from the one in which it is baked, and strewed with sifted sugar, before it is sent to table. Minute directions for the preparation and management of each particular variety of pudding will be found in the receipt for it. ALMOND PUDDING. On two ounces of fine white bread-crumbs pour a pint of boiling cream, and let them remain till nearly cold, then mix them very gradually with half a pound of sweet and six bitter almonds pounded to the smoothest paste, with a little orange-flower water, or, when this is not at hand, with a few drops of spring water, just to prevent their oiling; stir to them by degrees the well- beaten yolks of seven and the whites of three eggs, six ounces of sifted sugar, and four of clarified butter; turn the mixture into a very clean stewpan, and stir it with- out ceasing over a slow fire until it becomes thick, but on no account allow it to boil. When it is tolerably^ cool add a glass of brandy, or half a one of noyeau, pour the pudding into a dish lined with very thin puff paste, and bake it half an hour in a moderate oven. ♦ Bread-crumbs, 2 ozs. ; cream, l pint; pounded al- monds, lb.; bitter almonds, 6; yolks of 7, whites of 3 H H466 MODERN COOKERY.

Stir over a slow fire until they boil, four ounces and a half of butter with seven ounces of pounded sugar, then pour them into a dish and let them remain till cold, or nearly so. Mix very smoothly a large dessertspoonful of flour with six eggs that have been whisked and strained; add these gradually to the sugar and butter, with the grated rinds and the juice of two moderate- sized lemons; put a rim or a lining of puff-paste to the pudding, and bake it for an hour in a gentle oven. Butter, 4-J ozs.; sugar, 7 ozs.; flour, 1 large dessert- spoonful ; eggs, 6; lemons, 2 : 1 hour, gentle oven. Ohs.—The proportion of butter in these puddings is less than is commonly used for them, but a larger quan- tity renders them so unwholesomely rich that they are usually preferred with less. When a very powerful flavour of the fruit is liked, an additional lemon may be used in. either of these receipts. The rinds may be rasped on part of the sugar, instead of being grated. A couple of sponge-biscuits soaked in cream, then pressed dry, and very finely bruised, can be substituted for the flour.467 CHAP. XVIII.] BAKED PUDDINGS. LEMON SUET-PUDDING. To eight ounces of finely grated bread-crumbs, add six of fresh beef kidney-suet, free from skin, and minced very small, three and a half of pounded sugar, six ounces of currants, the grated rind and the strained juice of a large lemon, and four full-sized or five small well-beaten eggs; pour these ingredients into a thickly-buttered pan, and bake the pudding for an hour in a brisk oven, but draw it towards the mouth when it is of a fine brown colour. Turn it from the dish before it is served, and strew sifted sugar over it or not at pleasure : two ounces more of suet can be added when a larger propor- tion is liked. The pudding is very good without the currants. Bread-crumbs, 8 ozs.; beef-suet, 6 ozs. ; pounded sugar, 3|-ozs.; lemon, 1 large; currants, 6 ozs; eggs, 4 large, or 5 small: 1 hour, brisk oven. BAKEWELL PUDDING. This pudding is famous not only in Derbyshire, but in several of our northern counties, where it is usually served on all holiday-occasions. Line a shallow tart- dish with quite an inch-deep layer of several kinds of good preserve mixed together, and intermingle with them from two to three ounces of candied citron or orange-rind. Beat well the yolks of ten eggs, and add to them gradually half a pound of sifted sugar; when they are well mixed, pour in by degrees half a pound of good clarified butter, and a little ratifia or any other flavouring that may be preferred ; fill the dish two- thirds full with this mixture, and bake the pudding nearly an hour in a moderate oven. Half the quantity will be sufficient for a small dish. Mixed preserves, \\ to 2 lbs.; yolks of eggs, 10; sugar, \ lb.; butter, 1 lb.; ratifia, lemon-brandy, or other flavouring to the taste: baked, moderate oven, J to 1 hour. Ohs.—This is a rich and expensive, but not a very refined pudding. A variation of it, known in theMODERN COOKERY. 4G8 [[chap, xviit. south as an Alderman’s Pudding is, we think, a better one. It is made without the candied peel, and with a layer of apricot-jam only, six ounces of butter, six of sugar, the yolks of six, and the whites of two eggs. RATIFIA PUDDING. Flavour a pint and a half of new milk rather highly with bitter almonds, blanched and bruised, or, should their use be objected to, with three or four bay-leaves and a little cinnamon; add a few grains of salt, and from four to six ounces of sugar in lumps, according to the taste. When the whole has simmered gently for some minutes, strain off the milk through a fine sieve or muslin, put it into a clean saucepan, and when it again boils stir it gradually and quickly to six well-beaten eggs which have been likewise strained ; let the mix- ture cool, and then add to it a glass of brandy. Lay a half-paste round a well-buttered dish, and sprinkle into it an ounce of ratifias finely crumbled, grate the rind of half a lemon over,* and place three ounces of whole ratifias upon them, pour in sufficient of the custard to soak them ; an hour afterwards add the remainder, and send the pudding to a gentle oven : half an hour will bake it. New milk, l-J pint; bitter almonds, 8 to 10 (or bay-leaves, 3 to 5, and bit of cinnamon) ; sugar, 4 to 6 ozs.; eggs, 6 ; brandy, 1 wineglassful; ratifias, 4 ozs. ; rind \ lemon : baked, \ hour. THE ELEGANT ECONOMIST’S PUDDING. We have already given a receipt for an exceedingly good boiled pudding bearing this title, but we think the baked one answers even better, and it is made with rather more facility. Butter a deep tart-dish well, cut the slices of plum-pudding to join exactly in lining it, and press them against it lightly to make them adhere, as without this precaution they are apt to float off; pour in as much custard (previously thickened and left * A more delicate flavour is imparted by rasping the lemon-rind on sugar, and adding this to the mixture.CHAP. XVIII.] BAKED PUDDINGS. 469 to become cold), or any other sweet pudding-mixture as will fill the dish almost to the brim ; cover the top with thin slices of the plum-pudding, and bake it in a slow oven from thirty minutes to a full hour, according to the quantity and quality of the contents. One pint of new milk poured boiling on an ounce and a half of tons Us mois, smoothly mixed with a quarter-pint of cold milk, makes with the addition of four ounces of sugar, four small eggs, a little lemon-grate, and two or three bitter almonds, or a few drops of ratifia, an excel- lent pudding of this kind : it should be baked nearly three-quarters of an hour in a quite slack oven. Two ounces and a half of arrow-root may be used in lieu of the tons les mois, when this last is not procurable. We would especially recommend for trial the ingredients of the lemon-pudding of page 466,* with the plum-pud- ding crust, as likely to make a very superior variety of this dish : we have not had it tested, but think it could scarcely fail. It must be well, though slowly baked. RICH BREAD AND BUTTER PUDDING. Give a good flavour of lemon-rind and bitter almonds, or of cinnamon, if preferred, to a pint of new milk, and when it has simmered a sufficient time for this, strain and mix it with a quarter-pint of rich cream ; sweeten it with four ounces of sugar in lumps, and stir it while still hot to five well-beaten eggs ; throw in a few grains of salt, and move the mixture briskly with a spoon as a glass of brandy is added to it. Have ready in a thickly buttered dish three layers of thin bread and butter cut from a half-quartern loaf, with four ounces of currants, and one and a half of finely-shred candied peel, strewed between and over them ; pour the eggs and milk on them by degrees, letting the bread absorb one portion before another is added: it should soak for a couple of hours before the pudding is taken to the oven, which should be a moderate one. Half an hour will bake it. It is very good when made with * Second receipt.MODERN COOKERY. 470 [CHAP.

Add to a pint of new milk a quarter-pint of good cream, and pour them boiling on eight ounces of bread- crumbs, and three of fresh butter; when these have stood half an hour covered with a plate, stir to them four ounces of sugar, six ounces of currants, one and a half of candied orange or citron, and five eggs. A GOOD SEMOULINA PUDDING. Drop lightly into a pint and a half of boiling milk two large tablespoonsful of semoulina, and stir them together as this is done, that the mixture may not be lumpy ; continue the stirring for seven or eight mi- nutes, then throw in two ounces of good butter, and three and a half of pounded sugar, or of the finest Lis- bon ; next add the grated rind of a lemon, and while the semoulina is still hot beat gradually and briskly to it five well-whisked eggs ; pour it into a buttered dish, and bake it about half an hour in a moderate oven.

When the pudding is nearly cold pour it gently into a stewpan or mould, prepared as for the Gateau de Riz of page 474, and bake it in a very gentle oven from an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half. SUTHERLAND OR CASTLE PUDDINGS. Take an equal weight of eggs in the shell, of good butter, of fine dry flour, and of sifted sugar. First, whisk the eggs for ten minutes, or until they appear extremely light; then throw in the sugar by degrees, and continue the whisking for four or five minutes; next, strew in the flour, also gradually, and when it appears smoothly blended with the other ingredients, pour the butter to them in small portions, each of which should be beaten in until there is no appearance of it left. It should previously be just liquified with the least possible degree of heat; this may be effected by putting it into a w7ell-warmed saucepan, and shaking it round until it is dissolved. A grain or two of salt should be thrown in with the flour; and the rind of half a fine lemon rasped on sugar, or grated, if more convenient; or some pounded mace, or the store-flavour- ing of page 16G, can be added at choice. Pour the mix- * We have never in England, and rarely even in France, ob- tained any approaching in quality to some, which, in conjunction with a packet of vermicelli, equally good, was procured for us by a country chemist, from Mr. Barron, 18, Pall Mall, whose successor, Mr. A. Cobbett, supplies excellent articles of the same kind.473 CHAP. XVIII.] BAKED PUDDINGS. ture, directly it is ready, into well-buttered cups, and bake the puddings from twenty to twenty-five minutes. When cold, they resemble good pound-cakes, and may be served as such. Wine-sauce should be sent to table with them. Eggs, 4 ; their weight in flour, sugar, and butter ; little salt; flavouring of pounded mace or lemon-rind. Obs.—Three eggs are sufficient for a small dish of these puddings. They may be varied with an ounce or two of candied citron; or with a spoonful of brandy, or a littk, orange-flower water. The mode we have given of making them will be found perfectly successful if our directions be followed with exactness. In a slack oven they will not be too much baked in half an hour. [MADELEINE PUDDINGS. (To be served cold.) Take the same ingredients as for the Sutherland puddings, but clarify an additional ounce of butter; skim, and then fill some round tin pattypans with it almost to the brim, pour it from one to the other till all have received a sufficient coating to prevent the pud- dings from adhering to them, and leave half a teaspoon- ful in each; mix the remainder with the eggs, sugar, and flour, beat the whole up very lightly, fill the pans about two-thifds full, and put them directly into a rather brisk oven, but draw them towards the mouth of it when they are sufficiently coloured : from fifteen to eighteen minutes will bake them. Turn them out, and drain them on a sheet of paper. When they are quite cold, with the point of a knife, take out a portion of the tops, hollow the puddings a little, and fill them with rich apricot-jam, well mixed with half its weight of pounded almonds, of which two in every ounce should be bitter ones.

Pour into a small copper stewpan * a couple of ounces of clarified butter, and incline it in such a manner that it may receive an equal coating in every part; then turn it upside down for an instant, to drain off the superfluous butter; next throw in some exceedingly fine light crumbs of stale bread, and shake them entirely over it, turn out those which do not adhere, and with a small brush or feather, sprinkle more clarified butter slightly on those which line the pan. Whisk quickly the whites of the eggs to snow, stir them gently to the rice, and pour the mixture softly into the stewpan, that the bread- crumbs may not be displaced; put it immediately into a moderate oven, and let it remain in a full hour. It will then, if properly baked, turn out from the mould or pan well browned, quite firm, and having the appear- ance of a cake ; but a fierce heat will cause it to break, and present an altogether unsightly appearance. In a very slack oven a longer time must be allowed ^or it. New milk, or milk and cream, 1 quart; Carolina rice, 7 ozs. : f hour. Fresh butter, 3 ozs.; sugar, in lumps, 5 ozs.; rind 1 large lemon: j to 1J hour. Eggs, 6 : baked in a moderate oven, 1 hour. Obs.—An admirable variety of this Gateau is made with cocoa-nut flavoured milk, or cream, (see Chapter XX.), or with either of these poured boiling on six ounces of Jordan almonds, finely pounded, and mixed with a dozen of bitter ones, then expressed from them * One which holds about five pints is well adapted to the pur- pose. When this is not at hand, a copper cake-mould may be substituted for it. The stewpan must not be covered while the g&teau is baking.CHAP.

A COMMON RICE PUDDING. Throw six ounces of rice into plenty of cold water, and boil it gently from eight to ten minutes; drain it well, in a sieve, or strainer, and put it into a clean saucepan with a quart of milk; let it stew till tender, sweeten.it with three ounces of sugar, stir to it, gradually, three large, or four small eggs, beaten and strained; add grated nutmeg, lemon-rind, or cinnamon, to give it flavour, and bake it one hour in a gentle oven. Hice 6 ozs.; in water, 8 to 10 minutes. Milk, 1 quart: J hour to 1 hour. Sugar, 3 ozs.; eggs, 3 large, or 4 small; flavouring of nutmeg, lemon-rind, or cin- namon : bake 1 hour, gentle oven. RICHER RICE PUDDING. Pick and wash very clean four ounces of whole rice, pour on it a pint and a half of new milk, and stew it slowly till quite tender; before it is taken from the fire, stir in two ounces of good butter, and three of sugar; when it has cooled a little, add four well whisked eggs, and the grated rind of half a lemon. Bake the pudding in a gentle oven from thirty to forty minutes. As rice requires long-boiling to render it soft in milk, it may be partially stewed in water, the quantity of milk dimi- nished to a pint, and a little thick sweet cream mixed with it, before the other ingredients are added. Rice, 4 ozs.; new milk, 1^- pint; butter, 2 ozs.; sugar, 3 ozs.; eggs, 4; rind of J lemon: 30 -to 40 minutes, slow-oven. / RICE PUDDING MERINGUE. Swell gently four ounces of Carolina rice in a pint and a quarter of milk or of thin cream ; let it cool a little, and stir to it an ounce and a half of butter, three ofMODERN COOKERY. [CHAP.

Pour the mixture into a well-buttered dish, and lay lightly and equally over the top, the whites of the eggs, beaten as for sponge-cakes, and mixed at the instant with from four to five heaped tablespoonsful of sifted sugar. Bake the pudding half an hour in a moderate oven, but do not allow the meringue to be too deeply coloured; it should be of a clear brown, and very crisp. Serve it directly it is taken from the oven. Rice, 4 ozs.; milk, or cream, 1^ pint.; butter,-1^ ozs; sugar, 3 ozs. ; rind, 1 lemon; yolks of eggs, 4 or 5; the whites beaten to snow, and mixed with as many tablespoonsful of sifted sugar : baked | hour, moderate oven. Obs.—A couple of ounces of Jordan almonds, with six bitter ones, pounded quite to a paste, will improve this dish, whether mixed with the pudding itself, or with the meringue. GOOD GROUND RICE PUDDING. Mix very smoothly five ounces of flour of rice (or of ground rice, if preferred), with half a pint of milk, and poyr it into a pint and a half more that is boiling fast ; keep it stirred constantly over a gentle fire from ten to twelve minutes, and be particularly careful not to let it burn to the pan; add to it before it is taken from the fire, a quarter-pound of good butter, from five to six ounces of sugar, roughly powdered, and a half salt- spoonful of salt; turn it into a pan, and stir it for a few minutes, to prevent its hardening at the top; then mix with it, by degrees, but quickly, the yolks of eight eggs, and the whites of only two, the grated or rasped rind of a fine lemon, and a glass of brandy. Lay a border of rich paste round a buttered dish, pour in the pudding, strain a little clarified butter over the top, moisten the paste with a brush, or small bunch of feathers dipped in cold water, and sift plenty of sugar on it, but less overCHAP.

Butter 4 ozs.; sugar, 5 to 6 ozs.; salt, \ saltspoonful; yolks, 8 eggs; whites, 2 ; rind, 1 large lemon; brandy, large wineglassful: f hour, slow oven. Obs.—These proportions are sufficient for a pudding of larger size than those served usually at elegant tables; they will make two small ones; or two-thirds of the quantity may be taken for one of moderate size. Lemon-brandy or ratifia, or a portion of each may be used to give it flavour, with good effect; and it may be enriched, if this be desired, by adding to the other ingre- dients from three to four ounces of Jordan almonds, finely pounded, and by substituting cream for half of the milk. - COMMON GROUND RICE PUDDING. One pint and a half of milk, three ounces and a half of rice, three of Lisbon sugar, one and a half of butter, some nutmeg, or lemon-grate, and four eggs, baked slowly for half an hour, or more, if not quite firm. GREEN GOOSEBERRY PUDDING. Boil together, from ten to twelve minutes, a pound of green gooseberries, five ounces of sugar, and rather more than a quarter pint of water; then beat the fruit to a mash, and stir to it an ounce and a half of fresh butter; when nearly, or quite cold, add two ounces and a half of very fine bread-crumbs, and four well whisked eggs. Bake the pudding half an hour. To make a finer one of the kind, work the fruit through a sieve, mix it with four or five crushed Naples biscuits, and use double the quantity of butter.

With a pound and a quarter of fine mealy potatoes, boiled very dry, and mashed perfectly smooth while hot, mix three ounces of butter, five and a half of sugar, five eggs, a few grains of salt, and the grated rind of a small lemon. Pour the mixture into a well-buttered dish, and bake it in a moderate oven for nearly three-quarters of an hour. It should be turned out and sent to table with fine sugar sifted over it; or for variety, red currant jelly, or any other preserve may be spread on it as soon as it is dished. Potatoes, 1J lb.; butter, 8 ozs.; sugar, 5-| ozs.; eggs, 5; lemon-rind, 1; salt, few grains: 40 to 45 minutes. Obs.—When cold, this pudding eats like cake, and may be served as such, omitting, of course, the sugar, or preserve when it is dished. A RICHER POTATOE PUDDING. Beat well together fourteen ounces of mashed pota- toes, four ounces of butter, four of fine sugar, five eggs, the grated rind of a small lemon, and a slight pinch of salt, add half a glass of brandy, and pour the pudding into a thickly buttered dish, ornamented with slices of candied orange or lemon-rind ; pour a little clarified butter on the top, and then sift plenty of white sugar over it. Potatoes, 14 ozs.; butter, 4 ozs.; sugar, 4 ozs. ; eggs, 5 ; lemon-rind, 1 ; little salt; brandy, glassful; candied peel, 1-J to 2 ozs. ; 40 minutes.

AN EXCELLENT SPONGE-CAKE PUDDING. Slice into a well-buttered tart-dish three penny sponge cakes, and place on them a couple of ounces of candied orange or lemon-peel cut in strips. Beat well six eggs, and stir to them boiling a pint and a quarter of new milk, in which three ounces of sugar have been dis- solved ; grate in the rind of a small lemon, and when they are somewhat cooled, add half a wineglassful of brandy; while still warm, pour the mixture on to the cakes, and let it remain an hour; then strain an ounce and a half of clarified butter over the top, sift or strew pounded sugar rather thickly on it, and bake the pud- ding half an hour in a moderate oven.

Mix with them while they are still quite hot, three ounces of butter, the grated rind and the strained juice of a lemon, and lastly, by degrees stir in the well beaten yolks of five eggs, and a dessert- spoonful of flour, or in lieu of the last, three or four Naple’s biscuits, or macaroons crushed small. Bake the pudding for a full half hour in a moderate oven, or longer should it not be quite firm in the middle. A little clarified butter poured on the top, with sugar sifted over, improves all baked puddings. Apples, X lb. ; sugar, 6 ozs; water, 1 cupful; butter, 3 ozs.; juice and rind, 1 lemon; 5 eggs : ^ hour. Obs.—Many cooks press the apples through a sieve after they are boiled, but this is not needful when they are of a good kind, and stewed, and beaten smooth. ANOTHER BAKED APPLE PUDDING. Stew, till smooth and dry, a pound of apples with seven ounces of sugar and a very little water; add to them five ounces of butter, the grated rinds of two moderate-sized lemons, and the juice of one and a half, the beaten yolks of six eggs, and the whites of three ; do not add the eggs until the butter is dissolved, then stir them in quickly in small portions, beat the whole well together, add, if it can be obtained, two or three spoonsful of the syrup of preserved ginger, and one of flour, or a little crushed Naples’ biscuit; put a rim of paste round a dish, pour in the pudding, and bake it from half to three-quarters of an hour.

CHAP. XVIII.] 481 bread-crumbs, and five well-beaten eggs; grate in half a nutmeg, or flavour the pudding with pounded cinna- mon, and bake it nearly three quarters of an hour. More or less of sugar will be required for these pud- dings, according to the time of year, as the fruit is much more acid when first gathered than when it has been some months stored.

Mix with a quarter-pound of mashed potatoes half a pound of good boiling apples minced, four ounces of brown sugar, four small eggs well beaten and strained, and a little grated lemon-peel or nutmeg. Increase the ingredients one-half, and add two ounces of butter, should a larger and better pudding be desired : about half an hour will bake it. Potatoes mashed, 4 ozs.,* apples, 8 ozs,; sugar, 4 ozs.; eggs, 4 : \ hour. DUTCH CUSTARD; OR BAKED RASPBERRY PUDDING. Lay into a tart-dish a border of puff-paste, and a pint and a half of freshly-gathered raspberries, well mixed with three ounces of sugar. Beat thoroughly six large eggs with three ounces more of sugar, and pour it over the fruit: bake the pudding from twenty-five to thirty minutes in a moderate oven. Break the eggs one at a time into a cup, and with the point of a small three-pronged fork take off the specks or germs, before they are beaten, as we have directed in page 485.

XYIII. 482 Stir them well together, and place them near the fire that the rice may swell very gradually ; then let it simmer as gently as possible for about half an hour, or until it begins to be quite tender ; mix witli it then two ounces of fresh butter, and two and a half of pounded sugar, and let it continue to simmer softly until it is dry and perfectly tender.* Before it is taken from the fire scrape into it the out- side of some sugar which has been rubbed upon the rind of a fresh lemon. Have ready a tin mould of pretty form, well buttered in every part; press the rice into it while it is still hot, smooth the surface, and let it remain till cold. Should the mould be one which opens at the ends, like that shewn in the plate at page 401, the pudding will come out easily; but if it should be in a plain common one, just dip it into hot water to loosen it; turn out the rice, and then again reverse it on to a tin or dish; and with the point of a knife mark round the top a rim of about an inch wide; then brush some clarified butter over the whole pudding, and set it into a brisk oven. When it is of an equal light golden brown draw it out, raise the cover carefully where it is marked, scoop out the rice from the inside, leaving only a crust of about an inch thick in every part, and pour into it some preserved fruit warmed in its own syrup, or fill it with a compote of plums or peaches (see Chapter XX); or with some good apples boiled with fine sugar to a smooth rich marmalade. This is a very good as well as an elegant dish : it may be enriched with more butter, and by sub- stituting cream for the milk, in part, or entirely, but it is excellent without either.

CHAP. XVIII.] VERMICELLI PUDDING. Drop lightly into a pint and a half of boiling milk four ounces of fresh vermicelli, and keep it simmering and stirred gently for ten minutes, when it will have become very thick ; then mix with it three ounces and a half of sugar, two ounces of butter, and a small pinch of salt. When the whole is well blended pour it out; beat it for a couple of minutes to cool it a little ; then add by degrees five well-whisked eggs, the grated rind of a lemon, and just before it is put into the dish, a small glass of brandy : bake it from half to three- quarters of an hour. Vermicelli varies much in quality, and of some kinds three ounces will render the pudding quite firm enough. Milk, \\ pint; vermicelli, 4 ozs. : 10 minutes. Sugar, 3^ ozs.; batter, 2 ozs.; pinch of salt; eggs, 5 ; lemon- rind, 1 ; brandy, 1 wineglassful : \ to j hour. Ohs.—This pudding requires, more than many others, a little clarified butter poured on the top, and sugar sifted over. Candied peel may be added to it with good effect ; and three or four bitter almonds pounded, may be used to give it flavour instead of lemon-rind. SMALL COCOA-NUT PUDDINGS. Melt together over a slow fire two ounces of fresh butter cut small, and four of pounded sugar; pour them out when they have boiled a couple of minutes, and let them cool; mix with them two ounces of finely-grated cocoa-nut, an ounce of citron shred small, the grated rind of half a large lemon, and four eggs: when these have been well beaten together, add the strained juice of the half lemon ; put the mixture into buttered patty-pans, or pudding-cups, sift sugar over and bake them half an hour in a moderate oven. This is an excellent and a perfectly new receipt; but in making use of it care should be taken to ascertain that the nut be fresh and sweet flavoured, as the slightest[CHAP. XYIII.

Obs.—The same ingredients may be made into one pudding only, and longer baked. GOOD YORKSHIRE PUDDING. To make a very good and light Yorkshire pudding, take an equal number of eggs and of a heaped table- spoonsful of flour, with a teaspoonful of salt to six of thqse. Whisk the eggs well, strain, and mix them gradually with the flour, then pour in by degrees as much new milk as will reduce the batter to the consistency of rather thin cream. The tin which is to receive the pudding must have been placed for some time previously under a joint that has been put down to roast: one of beef is usually preferred. Beat the batter briskly and lightly the instant before it is poured into the pan, watch it carefully that it may not burn, and let the edges have an equal share of the fire. When the pudding is quite firm in every part, and well- coloured on the surface, turn it, to brown the under side. This is best accomplished by first dividing it into quarters. In Yorkshire it is made much thinner than in the south, roasted generally at an enormous fire, and not turned at all: currants there are some- times added to it. Eggs, 6; flour, 6 heaped tablespoonsful, or from 7 to 8 ozs. ; milk, nearly or quite, 1 pint; salt, 1 tea- spoonful: 2 hours. Obs.—This pudding should be quite an inch thick when it is browned on both sid^s, but only half the depth when roasted in the Yorkshire mode. The cook must exercise her discretion a little in mixing the bat- ter, as from the variation of weight in flour, and in the size of eggs, a little more or less of milk may be re- quired : the whole should be rather more liquid than for a boiled pudding.€HAP. XVIII.] BAKED PUDDINGS. 485 COMMON YORKSHIRE PUDDING. Half a pound of flour, three eggs (we would recom- mend a fourth), rather more than a pint of milk, and a teaspoonful of salt. NORMANDY PUDDING. (GOOD.) Boil, till very soft and dry, eight ounces of rice in a pint and a half, or rather more, of water,* stir to it two ounces of fresh butter, and three of sugar, and simmer it a few minutes after they are added, then pour it out, and let it cool for use. Strip from the stalks as many red currants, or Kentish cherries, as will fill a tart-dish of moderate size, and for each pint of the fruit allow from three to four ounces of sugar. Line the bottom and sides of a deep dish with part of the rice; next, put in a thick layer of fruit and sugar ; then one of rice and one of fruit alternately until the dish is full. Sufficient of the rice should be reserved to form a rather thick layer at the top ; smooth this equally all over with a knife, and send the pudding to a moderate but not very slow oven, for half an hour, and more, should it be large. When two-thirds baked, it may be glazed with yolk of egg, brushed over, and fine sugar sifted on * it. Morelia cherries, with a little additional sugar, make an excellent pudding of this kind. DAMSON-AND-RICE PUDDING. With five ounces of whole rice boiled soft and dry, mix an ounce of butter, ten ounces of damson-jam, a teaspoonful of lemon-juice, and five eggs. Beat the whole well together, and bake it about half an hour. Rice, 5 ozs.; damson-jam, 10 ozs.; butter, 1 oz. ; eggs, 5 : ^ hour. BARBERRY-AND-RICE PUDDING.

Boil together one pound of good pudding-apples, and six ounces of sugar, until they are reduced to a smooth pulp; stir them often to prevent their burning; mix with them four ounces of boiled rice, two ounces of butter, and five large eggs. Should the apples be very acid, increase the quantity of sugar : add lemon rind or juice, at pleasure. These puddings are better if mixed while the ingredients are warm. Apples, 1 lb.; sugar, 6 ozs.; boiled rice, 4 ozs.; but- ter, 2 ozs.; eggs, 5 : 30 to 35 minutes. COMMON RAISIN PUDDING. Beat well together three-quarters of a pound of flour, the same quantity of raisins, six ounces of beef-suet, finely chopped, a small pinch of salt, some grated nut- meg, and three eggs that have been thoroughly whisked, and mixed with about a quarter-pint of milk, or less than this, should the eggs be large. Pour the whole into a buttered dish, and bake it an hour and a quarter. For a large pudding, increase the quantities one-half. Flour and stoned raisins, each } lb.; suet, 6 ozs. ; salt, small pinch ; nutmeg, J teaspoonful; eggs, 3; milk, i pint: hour. * A RICHER RAISIN PUDDING. A pound of raisins weighed after they are stoned, ten ounces of beef-suet shred very fine, three-quarters of a pound of flour, a little salt, half a small nutmeg, or the grated rind of a lemon, four large eggs, and as much milk as may be needed to make the whole into a very thick batter. Mix, and beat the ingredients well, and bake the pudding rather longer than the preceding one. The addition of sugar will not be found an improve- ment to these puddings, as it destroys their lightness.487 CHAP. XVIII.] BAKED PUDDINGS. poor author’s pudding.

Fill a deep tart-dish with alternate layers of well- sugared fruit, and very thin slices of the crumb of a light stale loaf; let the upper layer be of fruit, and should it be of a dry kind, sprinkle over it about a dessertspoonful of water, or a little lemon-juice : rasp- berries, currants, and cherries, will not require this. Send the pudding to a somewhat brisk oven to be baked for about half an hour. The proportion of sugar used must be regulated, of course, by the acidity of the fruit. For a quart of ripe green-gages, split>nd stoned, five ounces will be sufficient. Apricots, peaches, and nec- tarines will scarcely require more; but damsons, bul- laces, and various other plums will need a much larger quantity. A superior pudding of this kind is made l|y substituting sponge-cake for the bread. INDIAN PUDDING. Put into a deep dish from six to eight ounces of rice that has been washed, and wiped in a dry cloth; just moisten it with milk, and set it into a gentle oven, addMODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XVIII* 488 milk to it at intervals, in small quantities, until the grain is swollen to its full size, and is tender, but very- dry ; then mix with it two dessertspoonsful of fine sugar, and if it should be at hand, four or five tablespoons- ful of rich cream. Fill a tart-dish almost to the brim with fruit properly sugared, heap the rice equally over it, leaving it rough, and bake it in a moderate oven for half an hour, unless the fruit should be of a kind to require a longer time; when very hard, it must be half stewed with the sugar before it is put into the dish. The rice may be swelled over a very slow fire when more convenient; and the Dutch or American oven will serve quite well to bake the pudding. BAKED HASTY PUDDING. Take from a pint of new milk sufficient to mix into a thin batter two ounces of flour, put the remainder, with a small pinch of salt, into a clean saucepan, and when it boils quickly, stir the flour briskly to it; keep it stirred over a gentle fire for ten minutes, pour it out, and when it has become a little cool, mix with it two ounces of fresh butter, three of pounded sugar, the grated rind of a small lemon, four large, or five small eggs, and half a glass of brandy, or as much orange- flower water. To these half a dozen bitter almonds, pounded to a paste, are sometimes added. Bake the pudding half an hour in a gentle oven. New milk, 1 pint; flour, 2 ozs.: 10 minutes. But- ter, 2 ozs.; sugar, 3 ozs.; eggs, 4 or 5; grated rind of lemon ; brandy, or qrange-flower water, -J wine glassful.CHAP. XIX.] SOUFFLES, OMLETS, &C. 489 CHAPTER XIX. SOUFFLES, OMLETS, &c. Silver Souffie-pan and dish. OBSERVATIONS ON OMLETS, FRITTERS, &C. The composition and nature of a souffle are altogether different, but there is no difficulty in making good omlets, pancakes, or fritters, and as they may be expe- ditiously prepared and served, they are often a very convenient resource when, on short notice, an addition is required to a dinner. The eggs for all of them should be well and lightly whisked; the lard for frying batter should be extremely pure in flavour, and quite hot when the fritters are dropped in ; the batter itself should be smooth as cream, and it should be briskly beaten the instant before it is usede All fried pastes should be perfectly drained from the fat before they are served and sent to table promptly when they are ready. Eggs may be dressed in a multiplicity of ways, but are seldom, in any form, more relished than in a well-made and expeditiously served omlet. This may be plain, or seasoned with minced herbs, and a very little eschalot, when the last is liked, and is then called an “ Omlette aux fines herbesor it may be mixed with minced490 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XIX. ham, or grated cheese; in any case, it should be light, thick, full-tasted, and fried only on one side ; if turned in the pan, as it frequently is in England, it will at once be flattened and rendered tough. Should the slight rawness which is sometimes found in the middle of the inside, when the omlet is made in the French way, be objected to, a heated shovel, or a salamander, may be held over it for an instant, before it is folded on the dish. The pan for frying it should be quite small; for if it be composed of four or five eggs only, and then put into a large one, it will necessarily spread over it and be thin, which would render it more like a pancake than an omlet; the only partial remedy for this, when a pan of proper size cannot be had, is to raise the handle of it high, and keep the opposite side close down to the fire, which will confine the eggs to a smaller space. No gravy should be poured ever into the dish with it, and, indeed, if properly made, it will require none. Lard is preferable to butter for frying batter, as it renders it lighter; but it must not be used for omlets. A COMMON OMLET. From four to eight very fresh eggs may be used for this, according to the sized dish required. Half a dozen will generally be sufficient. Break them singly and carefully; clear them in the way we have already pointed out in the introduction to boiled puddings, or when they are sufficiently whisked pour them through a sieve, and resume the beating until they are very light. Add to them from half to a whole teaspoonful of salt, and a seasoning of pepper. Dissolve in a small frying- pan a couple of ounces of butter, pour in the eggs, and as soon as the omlet is well risen and firm throughout, slide it on to a hot dish, fold it together like a turnover, and serve it immediately; from five to seven minutes will fry it. For other varieties of the omlet see the observations which precede this.CHAP. XIX.] SOUFFLES, OMLETS, &C. 491 AN OMLETTE SOUFFLEE. Separate, as they are broken, the whites from the yolks of six fine fresh eggs; beat these last thoroughly, first by themselves and then with four tablespoonsful of dry, white sifted sugar, and the rind of half a lemon grated on a fine grater.* Whisk the whites to a solid froth, and just before the omlet is poured into the pan, mix them well, but lightly, with the yolks. Put four ounces of fresh butter into a very small and delicately clean omlet or frying pan, and as soon as it is all dissolved, add the eggs and stir them round, that they may absorb it entirely. When the under side is just set, turn the omlet into a well-buttered dish, and send it to a tolerably brisk oven. From five to ten minutes will bake it; and it must be served the instant it is taken out; carried, indeed, as quickly as possible to table from the oven. It will have risen to a great height, but will sink and become heavy in a very short space of time : if sugar be sifted over it, let it be done with the utmost expedition. Eggs, 6 ; sugar, 4 tablespoonsful; rind, J lemon; butter, 4 ozs. : omlet baked, 5 to 10 minutes. Obs.—A large common frying-pan will not answer for omlets : a very small one should be kept for them, when there is no regular omlet-pan. SOUFFLES. The admirable lightness and delicacy of a well-made souffle render it generally a very favourite dish, and it is now a fashionable one also. It may be greatly varied in its composition, but in all cases must be served the very instant it is taken from the oven ; and even in passing to the dining-room it should, if possible, be prevented from sinking by a heated iron or salamander held above it. A common souffle-pan may be purchased for four or five shillings, but those of silver or plated metal which are of the form shown at the commencement of * As we have before said, a much more delicate flavour is im- parted by rasping the lemon-rind on sugar.492 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XIX. this chapter, are of course expensive; the part in which the souffle is baked is placed within the more ornamental dish when it is drawn from the oven. A plain, round shallow cake-mould, with a strip of writing-paper six inches high, placed inside the rim will answer on an emergency to bake a souffle in. The following receipt will serve as a guide for the proper mode of making it : the process is always the same whether the principal ingredient be whole rice boiled very tender in milk and pressed through a sieve, bread-crumbs soaked as for a pudding and worked through a sieve also, arrow-root, potato-flour, or ought else of which light puddings in general are made. Take from a pint and a half of new milk or of cream sufficient to mix four ounces of flour of rice to a per- fectly smooth batter; put the remainder into a very clean, well-tinned saucepan, and when it boils, stir the rice briskly to it; let it simmer, keeping it stirred all the time, for ten minutes or more should it not be very thick, then mix well with it two ounces of fresh butter, one and a half of pounded sugar, and the grated rind of a fine lemon (or let the sugar which is used for it be well rubbed on the lemon before it is crushed to powder) ; in two or three minutes take it from the fire, and beat quickly and carefully to it by degrees the yolks of six eggs; whisk the whites to a very firm solid froth, and when the pan is buttered, and all else quite ready for the oven, stir them gently to the other ingredients ; pour the souffle immediately into the pan and place it in a moderate oven, of which keep the door closed for a quarter of an hour at least. When the souffle has risen very high, is of a fine colour, and quite done in the centre, which it will be in from half to three- quarters of an hour, send it instantly to table. The exact time for baking it depends so much on the oven that it cannot be precisely specified. We have known quite a small one not too much baked in forty-five minutes in an iron oven ; but generally less time will suffice for, them : the heat, however, should always be quite moderate.4.93 CHAP. XIX.] SOUFFLES, OMLETS, &C. New milk or cream, 1-J pint; flour of rice, 4 ozs.; fresh butter, 2 ozs.; pounded sugar, 1^ oz. ; eggs, 6; grain of salt ; rind, 1 lemon : 30 to 45 minutes. Obs.—The souffle may be flavoured with vanilla, orange-flowers, citron-rind, or ought else that is liked. Chocolate and coffee also may he used for it with soaked bread : a very strong infusion of the last, and an ounce or two of the other melted with a little water are to be added to the milk and bread. KENTISH FRITTERS. Beat up the whites of three eggs and the yolks of six with half a pound of flour, a cupful of milk, and a large teaspoonful of yeast; put the mixture into a jug, cover it, and set it by the fire until the next day, then add to the batter two large apples chopped fine, and fry the fritters as usual. Whites of eggs, 3 ; yolks, 6; flour, 8 ozs.; milk, one cupful; yeast, 1 teaspoonful: 24 hours. PLAIN COMMON FRITTERS. Mix with three well beaten eggs a quarter-pint of milk, and strain them through a fine sieve; add them gradually to three large tablespoonsful of flour, and thin the batter witli as much more milk as will bring it to the consistence of cream ; beat it up thoroughly at the moment of using it, that the fritters may be light. Drop it in small portions from a spouted jug or basin into boiling lard; when lightly coloured on one side, turn them, drain them well from the lard as they are lifted out, and serve them very quickly. They are eaten generally with fine sugar, and orange or lemon juice: the first of these may be sifted thickly over them after they are dished, the oranges or lemons cut in two, and sent to table with them. The lard used for frying them should be fresh and pure-flavoured : it renders them more crisp and light than butter, and is, therefore, better suited to the purpose. Eggs, 3 ; flour, 3 tablespoonsful; milk, J to pint.494 [CHAP. XIX. MODERN COOKERY. PANCAKES. These may be made with the same batter as fritters, if it be sufficiently thinned with an additional egg or two, or a little milk or cream, to spread quickly over the pan : to fry them well, this ought to be small. When the batter is ready, heat the pan over a clear fire and rub it with butter in every part, then pour in sufficient batter to spread over it entirely, and let the pancake be very thin: in this case it will require no turning, but otherwise, it must be tossed over with a sudden jerk, of the pan, in which the cook who is not somewhat expert will not always succeed; therefore the safer plan is to make them so thin that they will not require this. Keep them hot before the fire until a sufficient number are ready to send to table, then proceed with a second supply, as they should always be quickly served. Either roll them up and strew fine sugar over them, or spread them quickly with preserve, laying them one on the other. A richer kind of pancake may be made with a pint of cream, or of cream and new milk mixed, five eggs, or their yolks only, a couple of ounces of flour, a little pounded cinnamon or lemon-rind rasped on sugar and scraped into them, with two ounces more of pounded sugar, and two ounces of clarified butter: a few ratifias rolled to powder may be added at pleasure, or three or four macaroons. From 4 to 5 minutes. FRITTERS OF CAKE AND PUDDING. Cut plain pound or rice cake into small square slices half an inch thick ; trim away the crust, fry them slowly a light brown, in a small quantity of fresh butter, and spread over them when done a layer of apricot-jam, or of any other preserve, and serve them immediately. These fritters are improved by being moistened with a little good cream before they are fried : they must then be slightly floured. Cold plum pudding sliced down as thick as the cake, and divided into portions of equal size, and good form, then dipped into French or EnglishCHAP.

With half a pound of mincemeat mix two ounces of fine bread-crumbs (or a tablespoonful of flour), two eggs well beaten, and the strained juice of half a small lemon. Mix these well, and drop the fritters with a dessertspoon into plenty of very pure lard or fresh butter; fry them from seven to eight minutes, drain them on a napkin or on white blotting paper, and send them very hot to table. These fritters should be quite small. Mincemeat, \ lb.; bread-crumbs, 2 ozs. (or flour, 1 tablespoonful); eggs, 2; juice of 4- lemon: 7 to 8 minutes. VENETIAN FRITTERS. ( Very good.) Pick, wash, and drain three ounces of whole rice, put it into a full pint of cold milk, and bring it very slowly to boil; stir it often, and let it simmer gently until quite thick and dry. When about three parts done add to it two ounces of pounded sugar, and one of fresh butter, a grain of salt, and the grated rind of half a small lemon. Let it cool in the saucepan, and when only just warm mix with it thoroughly three ounces of currants, four of apples, chopped fine, a teaspoonful of flour, and three large or four small well-beaten eggs. Drop the mixture in small fritters, fry them in butter from five to seven minutes, and let them become quite firm on one side before they are turned: do this with a slice. Drain them as they are taken up, and sift white sugar over them after they are dished. Whole rice, 3 ozs. ; milk, 1 pint; sugar, 2 ozs.; butter, 1 oz.; grated rind of \ lemon; currants, 3 ozs.; minced apples, 4 ozs.; flour, 1 teaspoonful; a little salt; eggs, 3 large, or 4 small: 5 to 7 minutes. FRITTERS OF SPRING FRUIT. The rhubarb for these should be of a good sort, quickly grown, and tender. Pare, cut it into equal[CHAP. XIX. MODERN COOKERY. 496 lengths, and throw it into the French batter of page 1.54 ; with a fork lift the stalks separately, and put them into a pan of boiling lard or butter : in from five to six minutes they will be done. Drain them well and dish them on a napkin, or pile them high without one, and strew sifted sugar plentifully over them : they should be of a very light brown, and quite dry and crisp. The young stalks look well when left in their entire length, and only slightly encrusted with the batter, through which they should be merely drawn. 5 to 6 minutes. APPLE, PEACH, APRICOT, OR ORANGE FRITTERS. Pare and core without dividing the apples, slice them in rounds the full size of the fruit, dip them into the same batter as that directed for the preceding fritters ; fry them a pale brown, and let them be very dry. Serve them heaped high upon a folded napkin, and strew sifted sugar over them. After having stripped the outer rind from the oranges, remove carefully the white bitter skin, and in slicing them take out the pips; then dip them into the batter and proceed as for the apple frit- ters. The peaches and apricots should be merely skinned, halved, and stoned before they are drawn through the batter; unless they should be not fully ripe, when they must first be stewed tender in a thin syrup. 8 to 12 minutes. BRIOCHE FRITTERS. The brioche-paste,* when good, makes very superior cannelons and fritters: it is, we should say, better in this form than in that of the bun or cake, in which it is seen so commonly abroad. Make it, for the fritters, into very small balls; roll them quite thin, put a tea- spoonful or less of rich preserve into each, moisten the edges and fold the paste together securely, or with a small tin shape cut as many rounds of the brioche as are wanted, place some preserve in the centre of one-half of these, moisten the edges, lay the remainder lightly * For this, see page 407.497 CHAP. XIX.] SOUFFLES, OMLETS, &C. over them, press them carefully together and restore them to a good form with the tin cutter, by trimming them with it to their original size; slip them gently info a pan of boiling lard, and fry them from four and a half to five minutes. Serve them very hot, crisp, and dry, piled on ,a folded napkin. The cannelons are made like those of paste, and are extremely good. They are sometimes filled with the lemon-cheesecake mixture of page 434, or with Madame Werners, 431, with the first of these they are even better than with preserve. Fritters, 4|- to 5 minutes; cannelons, 5 to 6 minutes. POTATOE FRITTERS. See directions for potatoe puddings. The same mix- ture dropped in fritters into boiling butter, and fried till firm on both sides will be found very good. LEMON FRITTERS. Mix with six ounces of very fine bread-crumbs four of beef-suet, minced as small as possible, four ounces of pounded sugar, a small tablespoonful of flour, four whole eggs, well and lightly whisked, and the grated rind of one large or of two small lemons, with half or the whole of the juice, at choice; but before this last is stirred in, add a spoonful or two of milk or cream if needed. Fry the mixture in small fritters for five or six minutes. CANNELONS. Roll out very thin and evenly some fine pufl- paste into a long strip of from three to four inches wide, moisten the surface with a feather dipped in white of egg, and cut it into bands of nearly two inches wide; lay some apricot or peach marmalade equally along these, and fold the paste twice over it, close the K K‘ [chap. XIX. MODERN COOKERY. 498 ends carefully, and when all are ready slide them gently into a pan of boiling lard;* so soon as they begin to brown, raise the pan from the fire that they may not take too much colour before the paste is done quite through. Five minutes will fry them. Drain them well, and dry them on a soft cloth before the fire; dish them on a napkin, and place one layer crossing another, or merely pile them high in the centre. If well made, and served of a light brown and very dry, these cannelons are excellent: where lard is objected to butter maybe used instead, but the paste will then be somewhat less light. Only lard of the purest quality will serve for the purpose. 5 minutes. Proceed exactly as for the cannelons above, substi- tuting the brioche for the puff-paste, and rolling it as thin as possible, as it swells very much in the pan. It is a good plan to pass a notched paste-runner, should there be one at hand, lightly upon the edge of the second fold- ing of the crust, which should reach about to the centre of the cannelon : precaution should always be taken to close the paste so as to prevent the escape of the preserve. Fine sugar may be sifted over these after they are dried and dished.—4 to 5 minutes. Wipe very clean, in a dry cloth, seven ounces of rice, * Cannelons may be either baked or fried : if sent to the oven, they may first be glazed with white of egg or sugar.

XIX.] SOUFFLES, OMLETS, &C. put it into a clean stewpan, and pour on it a quart of new milk, let it swell gently by the side of the fire, and stir it often that it may not stick to the pan, nor burn ; when it is about half done, stir to it five ounces of pounded sugar, and six bitter almonds beaten extremely fine; the thin rind of half a fresh lemon may be added in the first instance. The rice must be simmered until it is soft, and very thick and dry; it should then be spread on a dish, and left till cold, when it is to be rolled into small balls, which must be dipped into beaten egg, and then covered in every part with the finest bread-crumbs. When all are ready, fry them a light brown in fresh butter, and dry them well before the fire, upon a sieve reversed and covered with a very soft cloth, or with a sheet of white blotting paper. Pile them in a hot dish, and send them to table quickly. Rice, 7 ozs.; milk, 1 quart; rind of lemon : f hour. Sugar, 5 ozs. ; bitter almonds, 6 : 40 to 60 minutes, or more. Fried, 5 to 7 minutes. FINER CROQUETTES OF RICE. Swell the rice in thin cream, or in new milk strongly flavoured with cocoa-nut (see page 509), add the same ingredients as in the foregoing receipt, and when the rice is cold, form it into balls, and with the thumb of the right hand hollow them sufficiently to admit in the centre a small portion of peach-jam, or of apricot-mar- malade ; close the rice well over it; egg, crumb, and fry the croquettes as usual. As, from the difference of quality, the same proportions of rice and milk will not always produce the same effect, the cook must use her discretion in adding, should it be needed, sufficient liquid to soften the rice perfectly: but she must bear in mind that if not boiled extremely thick and dry, it will be difficult to make it into croquettes, SAVOURY CROQUETTES OF RICE. These are made with the same preparation as the casserole of rice of Chapter XYI., but it must be boiled[CHAP. XIX. 500 MODERN COOKERY. very dry, and left to become quite cold before it is used. A few spoonsful of rich white sauce stirred into it when it is nearly tender, will improve it much. Form and hollow the croquettes as directed in the last receipt; fill them with a small portion of minced fowl, partridge, or pheasant, in a thick sauce, or with a stewed oyster or two cut in quarters; close the rice perfectly over them ; egg, and crumb the croquettes, fry and serve them gar- nished with crisped parsley. French cooks mix some- times a little grated Parmesan cheese with the rice at the moment it is taken from the fire, and roll the croquettes in more after they are egged; they press this on them, dip them again in egg, and then in the crumbs. Raise the pan high above the fire when the croquettes are lightly browned, that they may heat through ; then heighten the colour, and lift them out immediately. RISSOLES. This is the French name for small fried pastry of various forms, filled with meat or fish previously cooked: they may be made with brioche, or with light puff-paste, either of which must be rolled extremely thin ; cut it with a small round cutter fluted or plain ; put a little rich mince, or good pounded meat, in the centre, and moisten the edges, and press them securely together that they may not burst open in the frying. The rissoles may be formed like small patties, by laying a second round of paste over the meat; or, like cannelons ; they may, likewise, be brushed with egg, and sprinkled with vermicelli, broken small, or with fine crumbs. They are sometimes made in the form of croquettes, the paste being gathered round the meat, which must form a ball. In frying them, adopt the same plan as for the cro- quettes, raising the pan as soon as the paste is lightly coloured. Serve all these fried dishes well drained, and on a napkin. From 5 to 7 minutes, or less. VERY SAVOURY RISSOLES. Make the forcemeat No. 1, page 170, sufficiently firmCHAP. XIX.] SOUFFLES, OMLETS, &C. 501 with unbeaten yolk of egg, to roll rather thin on a well- floured board; cut it into very small rounds, put a little pounded chicken in the centre of one half, moistening the edges with water, or white of egg, lay the remaining rounds over these, close them securely, and fry them in butter a fine light brown, drain and dry them well, and heap them in the middle of a hot dish, upon a napkin folded flat. RISSOLES OF FISH. Take perfectly clear from bones and skin, the flesh of any cold fish that can be pounded to an exceedingly fine paste ; add to it, when in the mortar, from one-quarter to a third as much of good butter, and a high seasoning of cayenne, with a moderate one of mace and nutmeg. To these may be added, at pleasure, a few shrimps, or a little of any of the finer fish-sauces, or some lobster- coral. When the whole is well beaten and blended together, roll out some good puff-paste extremely thin, and with a small round tin-shape, cut out the number of rissoles required, put some of the fish into each of these, moisten the edges with white of egg, fold and press them securely together, and when all are ready, slip them gently into a pan of boiling lard or butter; fry them a pale brown, drain them well, and dry them on white blotting-paper, laid upon a sieve, reversed ; but do not place them sufficiently near to scorch or colour them. TO BOIL PIPE MACCARONI. We have found always the continental mode of dressing maccaroni the best. English cooks sometimes soak it in milk and water for an hour or more, before it is boiled, that the pipes may be swollen to the utmost, but this is apt to render it pulpy, though its appearance may be improved by it. Drop it lightly, and by degrees, into a large pan of fast-boiling water, into which a little salt, and a bit of butter the size of a walnut, have previously been thrown, and of which the[chap. XIX. 502 MODERN COOKERY. boiling should not be stopped by the addition of the maccaroni. In from three-quarters of an hour to an hour this will be sufficiently tender; it should always be perfectly so, as it is otherwise indigestible, though the pipes should remain entire. Pour it into a large cullender, and drain the water well from it. It should be very softly boiled after the first minute or two. f to 1 hour. RIBBAND MACCARONI. This is dressed in precisely the same manner as the pipe maccaroni, but requires only from fourteen to sixteen minutes' boiling in water, and twenty or more in broth or stock. DRESSED MACCARONI. Four ounces of pipe maccaroni is sufficient for a small dish, but from six to eight should be prepared for a family party where it is liked. The common English mode of dressing it is with grated cheese, butter, and cream, or milk. French cooks substitute generally a spoonful or two of very strong rich jellied gravy for the cream; and the Italians, amongst their many other modes of serving it, toss it in rich brown gravy, with sufficient grated cheese to flavour the whole strongly. Another, and an easy mode of dressing it is to boil and drain it well, and to put it into a deep dish, strewing grated cheese on every layer, and adding bits of fresh butter to it. The top, in this case, should be covered with a layer of fine bread-crumbs, mixed with grated cheese; these should be moistened plentifully with clarified butter, and colour given to them in the oven, or before the fire ; the crumbs may be omitted, and a layer of cheese substituted for them. An excellent prepara- tion of maccaroni may be made with any well-flavoured, dry white cheese, which can be grated easily, at much less cost than with the Parmesan, which is expensive, and in the country not always procurable even; we think that the rich brown gravy is also a great advan-503 CHAP. XIX.] SOUFFLES, OMLETS, &C. tage to the dish, which is further improved by a tolerably high seasoning of cayenne. These, however, are innovations on the usual modes of serving it in England. After it has boiled quite tender, drain it well, dissolve from two to three ounces of good butter in a clean stewpan, wfith a few spoonsful of rich cream, or of white sauce, lay in part of the maccaroni, strew more cheese upon it, add the remainder of the maccaroni and the cheese, and toss the whole gently until the ingre- dients are well incorporated, and adhere to the maccaroni, leaving no liquid perceptible : serve it immediately. Maccaroni, 6 ozs.; butter, 3 ozs.; Parmesan cheese, 6 ozs.; cream, 4 tablespoonsful. Ohs.—If preferred so, cheese may be strewed thickly over the maccaroni after it is dished, and just melted and browned with a salamander. MACCARONI A LA REINE. This is a very excellent and delicate mode of dressing maccaroni. Boil eight ounces in the usual way (see page 501), and by the time it is sufficiently tender, dissolve gently ten ounces of any rich, well-flavoured white cheese in full three-quarters of a pint of good cream, add a little salt, a rather full seasoning of cayenne, from half to a whole saltspoonful of pounded mace, and a couple of ounces of sweet fresh butter. The cheese should, in the first instance, be sliced very thin, and taken quite free of the hard part adjoining the rind; it should be stirred in the cream without inter- mission until it is entirely dissolved, and the whole is perfectly smooth: the maccaroni, previously well- drained, may then be tossed gently in it, or after it is dished, the cheese may be poured equally over the maccaroni. The whole, in either case, may be thickly covered before it is sent to table, with fine crumbs of bread fried of a pale gold colour, and dried perfectly, either before the fire or in an oven, when such an addi- tion is considered an improvement. As a matter of[CHAP. XIX. MODERN COOKERY. 504 precaution, it is better to boil the cream before the cheese is melted in it; rich white sauce, or bechamel, made not very thick, with an additional ounce or two of butter, may be used to vary and enrich this prepara- tion. If Parmesan cheese* be used for it, it must of course be grated. Half the quantity may be served. Maccaroni, | lb.; cheese, 10 ozs. ; good cream, j pint (or rich white sauce); butter, 2 ozs. (or more) ; little saltjy'me cayenne, and mace. POLENTA, AN ITALIAN DISH. (GOOD.) Throw into a quart of milk, when it is fast boiling, half a teaspoonful of salt, and then shake lightly into it five ounces of the best semoulina; stir the milk as this is added, and continue to do so from eight to ten minutes, letting the mixture boil gently during the time. It should be very thick, and great care must be taken to prevent its sticking to the saucepan, which should be placed over a clear fire on a bar or trevet, but not upon the coals. Pour the semoulina, when it is done, into a basin, which it will not fill by an inch or two, and let it remain some hours in a cool place, that it may become perfectly cold; it will then turn out quite solid, and like a pudding in appearance. Cut it wTith a large, sharp carving-knife, or a bit of thin wire, into half-inch slices; wash the basin into which it was poured at first, and butter it well; grate from six to eight ounces of good cheese (Parmesan, or any other), and mix with it a half teaspoonful of cayenne, and twice as much pounded mace; clarify from two to three ounces of fresh butter, and put a small quantity into the basin, strew in a little of the cheese, and then lay in the first slice of the semoulina, on this put a thick layer of the cheese, moisten it with some drops of butter, and place the second slice upon it, then more cheese and butter, and continue thus until all the semoulina is replaced in the basin, put plenty of cheese upon the top, * The Parmesan being apt to gather into lumps, instead of min- gling smoothly with the liquid, had perhaps better be avoided for this dish.505 CHAP. XIX.] SOUFFLES, OMLETS, &C. add the remainder of the clarified butter, and bake the mixture for about half an hour in a gentle oven. It should be of a fine golden colour when served. Turn it carefully into a dish, and send it instantly to table. A little rich brown gravy poured round might, to some tastes, improve it, but it is excellent without, and may be substituted for maccaroni, which it much resembles in flavour. In Italy, the flour of Indian com (maize), which is there called polenta, is used for it, but the semoulina, when good, answers the purpose perfectly. The dish may be enriched by adding butter to the milk, or by mixing with it a portion of cream ; and it may be browned in a Dutch oven, when no other is in use. New milk (or milk mixed with cream), 1 quart ; salt, large J teaspoonful; semoulina, 5 ozs.: 10 minutes. Grated cheese, 6 to 8 ozs. ; cayenne, | teaspoonful; mace, 1 small teaspoonful; butter, 2 to 3 ozs: baked ^ hour, gentle oven. Obs.—A plain mould can be used instead of the basin. FORCED EGGS FOR SALAD. Pound and press through the back of a hair-sieve, the flesh of three very fine, or of four moderate-sized anchovies, freed from the bones and skin. Boil six fresh eggs for twelve minutes, and when they are per- fectly cold, halve them lengthwise, take out the yolks, pound them to a paste with a third of their volume of fresh butter; then add the anchovies, a quarter-tea- spoonful of mace, and as much cayenne as will season the mixture well; beat these together thoroughly, and fill the whites of egg neatly with them. A morsel of garlic, not larger than a pea, perfectly blended with the other ingredients would to some tastes greatly improve this preparation : a portion of anchovy-butter (see page 152) or of potted ham, will supply the place of the fish in it very advantageously. Eggs, G ; an cl 10 vies, 4; butter, size of 2 yolks; mace, \ teaspoonful ; cayenne, third as much.506 [CHAP. XX. MODERN COOKERY. CHAPTER XX. SWEET DISHES. White and Rose-coloured Jelly. TO PREPARE CALF’S FEET STOCK.* The feet are usually sent in from the butcher’s ready to dress, but as a matter of economy-}- or convenience it is sometimes desirable to have them altogether prepared by the cook. Dip them into cold water, lay them into a deep pan, and sprinkle equally over them on both sides some rosin in fine powder; pour in as much boil- ing water as will cover them well, and let them remain for a minute or two untouched; then scrape the hair clean from them with the edge of a knife. When this is done, wash them very thoroughly both in hot and in cold water; divide them at the joint, split the claws, and take away the fat that is between them. Should the feet be large, put a gallon of cold water to the four, but from a pint to a quart less if they be of moderate size or small. Boil them gently down until the flesh has parted entirely from the bones, and the liquor is reduced nearly or quite half; strain, and let it stand till cold; remove every particle of fat from the top before it is used, and be careful not to take the sediment. Calf’s feet, (large) 4 ; water, 1 gallon : 6 to 7 hours. * For fuller and better directions for this, see page 239, Chapter IX. t They are sold at a much lower price when not cleared from the hair.SWEET DISHES. 507 CHAP. XX.] TO CLARIFY CALF’S FEET STOCK. Break up a quart of the stock, put it into a clean stewpan with the whites of five large or of six small eggs, two ounces of sugar, and the strained juice of a small lemon ; place it over a gentle fire, and do not stir it after the scum begins to form; when it has boiled five or six minutes, if the liquid part be clear turn it into a jelly-bag, and pass it through a second time should it not be perfectly transparent the first. To consumptive patients, and others requiring resto- ratives, but forbidden to take stimulants, the jelly thus prepared is often very acceptable, and may be taken with impunity, when it would be highly inju- rious made with wine. More white of egg is required to clarify it than when sugar and acid are used in larger quantities, as both of these assist the process. For blamange omit the lemon-juice, and mix with the clarified stock an equal proportion of cream (for an invalid new milk), with the usual flavouring and weight of sugar; or pour the boiling stock very gradu- ally to some finely pounded almonds, and express it from them as directed for Quince Blamange, allowing from six to eight ounces to the pint. Stock, 1 quart; whites of eggs, 5 ; sugar, 2 oz.; juice, 1 small lemon : 5 to 8 minutes. TO CLARIFY ISINGLASS. The finely-cut purified isinglass, which is now in general use, requires no clarifying except for clear jel- lies : for all other dishes it is sufficient to dissolve, skim, and pass it through a muslin strainer. When two ounces are required for a dish, put two and a half into a delicately clean pan, and pour on it a pint of spring-water which has been gradually mixed with a teaspoonful of beaten white-of-egg; stir these thoroughly together, and let them heat slowly by the side of a gentle fire, but do not allow the isinglass to stick to the pan. When the scum is well risen, which it will508 [CHAP. XX. MODERN COOKERY. be after two or three minutes simmering, clear it off, and continue the skimming until no more appears, then, should the quantity of liquid be more than is needed, reduce it by quick boiling to the proper point, strain it through a thin muslin, and set it by for use: it will be perfectly transparent, and may be mixed lukewarm with the clear and ready-sweetened juice of various fruits, or used with the necessary proportion of syrup, for jellies flavoured with choice liqueurs. As the clarifying reduces the strength of the isinglass,—or rather as a portion of it is taken up by the white of egg,—an additional quarter to each ounce must be allowed for this : if the scum be laid to drain on the back of a fine sieve which has been wetted with hot water, a little very strong jelly will drip from it. Isinglass, 2 \ ozs.; water, 1 pint; beaten white-of- egg, 1 teaspoonful. SPINACH GREEN, FOR COLOURING SWEET DISHES, CON- FECTIONARY, OR SOUPS. Pound quite to a pulp, in a marble or Wedgwood mortar, a handful or two of young freshly-gathered spinach, then throw it into a hair-sieve, and press through all the juice that can be obtained from it; pour this into a clean white jar, and place it in a pan of water that is at the point of boiling, and which must be allowed only to just simmer afterwards; in three or four minutes the juice will be poached or set; take it then gently with a spoon, and lay it upon the back of a fine sieve to drain. If wanted for immediate use, merely mix it in the mortar with some finely- powdered sugar ;* but if to be kept as store, pound it with as much as will render the whole tolerably dry ; boil it to candy-height over a very clear fire, pour it out in cakes, and keep them in a tin box or canister. For this last preparation consult the receipt for orange- flower-candy. * For soup, dilute it first with a little of the boiling stock, and stir it to the remainder.509 CHAP. XX.] SWEET DISHES. PREPARED APPLE, OR QUINCE JUICE. Pour into a clean earthen pan two quarts of spring water, and throw into it as quickly as they can be pared, cored, and weighed, four pounds of nonsuches, pear- mains, Ripstone pippins, or any other good boiling- apples of fine flavour. When all are done stew them gently until they are well broken, but not reduced quite to pulp ; turn them into a jelly-bag, or strain the juice from them without pressure through a closely-woven cloth, which should be gathered over the fruit, tied, and suspended above a deep pan until the juice ceases to drop from it: this, if not very clear, must be rendered so before it is used for syrup or jelly, but for all other purposes once straining it will be sufficient. Quinces are prepared in the same way, and with the same pro- portions of fruit and water, but they must not be too long boiled or the juice will become red. We have found it answer well to have them simmered until they are perfectly tender, and then to leave them with their liquor in a bowl until the following day, wffien the juice will be rich and clear. They should be thrown into the water very quickly after they are pared and weighed, as the air will soon discolour them. Water, 2 quarts; apples or quinces, 4 lbs. COCOA-NUT-FLAVOURED MILK. (For sweet dishes, fyc.) Pare the dark outer rind from a very fresh nut, and grate it on a fine and exceedingly clean grater; to every three ounces pour a quart of new milk, and simmer them very softly for three-quarters of an hour, or more, that a full flavour of the nut may be imparted to the milk without its being much reduced; strain it through a fine sieve, or cloth, with sufficient pressure to leave the nut almost dry: it may then be used for blamange, custards, rice and other puddings, light cakes and bread. To each quart new milk, 3 ozs. grated cocoa-nut. f to 1 hour.510 MODERN COOKERY. fcHAP. XX. Obs.—The milk of the nut, when perfectly sweet and good, may be added to the other with advantage. To obtain it, bore one end of the shell with a gimlet, and catch the liquid in a cup ; and to extricate the kernel, break the shell with a hammer: this is better than sawing it asunder. COMPOTES OP FRUIT. We would particularly invite the attention of the reader to these wholesome and agreeable preparations of fruit, which are much less served at English tables, generally, than they deserve to be. We have found them often peculiarly acceptable to persons of delicate habit, who were forbidden to partake of pastry in any form; and accompanied by a dish of boiled rice, they are very preferable for children, as well as for invalids, to either tarts or puddings. Compote of spring fruit. — (Rhubarb.) Take a pound of the stalks after they are pared, and cut them into short lengths; have ready a quarter-pint of water boiled gently for ten minutes with five ounces of sugar, or with six should the fruit be very acid, put it in, and simmer it for about ten minutes. Some kinds will be tender in rather less time, some will require more. Obs.—Good sugar in lumps should be used generally for these dishes, and when they are intended for dessert the syrup should be enriched with an additional ounce or two. Lisbon sugar will answer for them very well on ordinary occasions, but that which is refined will render them much more delicate. Compote of green currants.—Spring water half pint; sugar five ounces; boiled together ten minutes. One pint of green currants stripped from the stalks ; simmered three to five minutes. Compote of green gooseberries.—This is an excellent compote if made with fine sugar, and very good with any kind. Break five ounces into small lumps and pour on them half a pint of water; boil these gently for ten minutes, and clear off all the scum; then add toCHAP. XX.] SWEET DISHES. 511 them a pint of fresh gooseberries freed from the tops and stalks, washed, and well drained. Simmer them gently from eight to ten minutes, and serve them hot or cold. Increase the quantity for a large dish. Compote of green apricots.—Wipe the down from a pound of quite young apricots, and stew them very gently for nearly twenty minutes in syrup made witli eight ounces of sugar and three-quarters of a pint of water, boiled together the usual time. Compote of red currants.—A quarter-pint of water and five ounces of sugar : ten minutes. One pint of ready picked currants to be just simmered in the syrup from five to six minutes. This receipt will serve equally for raspberries, or for a compote of the two fruits mixed together. Either of them will be found an admirable accompaniment to batter, custard, bread, ground rice, and various other kinds of puddings, as well as to whole rice plainly boiled. Compote of Kentish or Flemish cherries.—Simmer five ounces of sugar with half a pint of water for ten minutes; throw into the syrup a pound of cherries weighed after they are stalked, and let them stew gently for twenty minutes : it is a great improvement to stone the fruit, but a larger quantity will then be required for a dish. Compote of Morelia cherries.—Boil together for fifteen minutes, five ounces of sugar with the half pint of water; add a pound and a quarter of ripe Mosella cher- ries, and simmer them very softly from five to seven minutes : this is a delicious compote. Compote of Damsons.—Four ounces of sugar and half a pint of water to be boiled for ten minutes; one pound of damsons to be added, and simmered gently from ten to twelve minutes. Compote of the Magnum Bonum, or other large plums.—Boil six ounces of sugar with half a pint of water the usual time ; take the stalks from a pound of plums, and simmer them very softly for twenty minutes. Increase the proportion of sugar if needed,MODERN COOKERY. 512 [chap. XX. and regulate the time as may be necessary for the dif- ferent varieties of fruit. Compote of bullaces.— The large, or shepherds’ bul- lace, is very good stewed, but will require a consider- able quantity of sugar to render it palatable unless it be quite ripe. Make a syrup with eight ounces, and three-quarters of a pint of water, and boil in it gently, from fifteen to twenty minutes, a pint and a half of the bullaces freed from their stalks. Compote of Siberian crabs.—To three-quarters of a pint of water add six ounces of fine sugar, boil them for ten, or twelve minutes, and skim them well. Add a pound and a half of Siberian crabs without their stalks, and keep them just at the point of boiling for twenty minutes ; they will then become tender without burst- ing. A few strips of lemon-rind and a little of the juice are sometimes added to this compote. COMPOTE OF PEACHES. Pare half a dozen ripe peaches, and stew them very softly from eighteen to twenty minutes, keeping them often turned in a light syrup, made with five ounces of fine sugar and a half-pint of water boiled together for ten minutes. Dish the fruit; reduce the syrup by quick boiling, pour it over the peaches, and serve them hot for a second-course dish, or cold for dessert. They should be quite ripe, and will be found delicious dressed thus. A little lemon-juice may be added to the syrup, and the blanched kernels of two or three peach or apricot stones. Sugar, 5 ozs.; water, l pint: 10 minutes. Peaches, 6 : 18 to 20 minutes. Obs.—Nectarines, without being pared, may be dressed in the same way, but will require to be stewed somewhat longer, unless they be perfectly ripe. ANOTHER RECEIPT FOR STEWED PEACHES. Should the fruit be not perfectly ripe throw it into boiling water and keep it just simmering, until the skin can be easily stripped off. Have ready half aCHAP. XX.] SWEET DISHES. 513 pound of fine sugar boiled to a light syrup with three quarters of a pin! of water ; throw in the peaches, let them stew softly till quite tender, and turn them often that they may be equally done; after they are dished add a little strained lemon-juice to the syrup, and reduce it by a few minutes very quick boiling. The fruit is sometimes pared, divided, and stoned, then gently stewed until it is tender. Sugar, 8 ozs. ; water, f pint: 10 to 12 minutes. Peaches 6 or 7; lemon-juice, 1 large teaspoonful. stewed barberries; or compote d’epine-vinette. Boil to a thin syrup half a pound of sugar and three- quarters of a pint of water, skim it well, and throw into it three-quarters of a pound of barberries stripped from the stalks; keep them pressed down into the syrup, and gently stirred: from five to seven minutes will boil them. Sugar, 8 ozs.; water, f pint: 12 to 15 minutes. Barberries, f lb. : 5 to 7 minutes. another compote of barberries for dessert. When this fruit is first ripe it requires, from its excessive acidity, nearly its weight of sugar to render it palatable; but after hanging some time upon the trees it becomes much mellowed in flavour, and may be sufficiently sweetened with a smaller proportion. Ac- cording to the state of the fruit then, take for each pound (leaving it in bunches) from twelve to sixteen ounces of sugar, and boil it with three-quarters of a pint of water till it forms a syrup. Throw- in the bunches of fruit, and simmer them for five or six minutes. If their weight of sugar be used, they will become in that time perfectly transparent. As all vessels of tin affect the colour of the barberries, they should be boiled in a copper stewpan, or in a German enamelled one, which would be far better. Barberries, 1 lb.; sugar, 12 to 16 ozs.; water, | pint: fruit simmered in syrup 5 to 6 minutes. L L[[chap. XX. MODERN COOKERY. 514 GATEAU DE POMMES. Boil together for fifteen minutes a pound of well refined sugar, and half a pint of water; then add a couple of pounds of nonsuches, or of any other finely- flavoured apples which can be boiled easily to a smooth pulp, and the juice of a couple of small or of one very large lemon. Stew these gently until the mixture is perfectly free from lumps, then boil it quickly, keeping it stirred, without quitting it, until it forms a very thick and dry marmalade. A few minutes before it is done add the finely grated rinds of a couple of lemons ; when it leaves the bottom of the preserving-pan visible and dry, press it into moulds of tasteful form ; and either store it for winter use, or if wanted for table, serve it plain for dessert, or ornament it with spikes of blanched almonds, and pour a custard round it for a second course dish. Sugar, 1 lb.; water, -J pint: 15 minutes. Nonsuches or other apples, 2 lbs. ; juice, 1 large or 2 small lemons: 2 hours or more. GATEAU OP MIXED FRUITS. (GOOD.) Extract the juice from some fresh red currants by simmering them very gently for a few minutes over a slow fire; strain it through a folded muslin, and to one pound of it add a pound and a half of nonsuches or of freshly gathered codlings, pared, and rather deeply cored, that the fibrous part of the apple may be avoided. Boil these quite slowly until the mixture be perfectly smooth, then, to evaporate part of the moisture, let the boiling be quickened. In from twenty-five to thirty minutes draw the pan from the fire, and throw in gra- dually a pound and a quarter of sugar in fine powder ; mix it well with the fruit, and when it is dissolved continue the boiling rapidly for twenty minutes longer, keeping the mixture constantly stirred put it into a mould, and store it, when cold, for winter use; or serve it for dessert, or for the second course : in the latter515 SWEET DISHES. CHAP. XX.] case decorate it with spikes of almonds blanched, and heap solid whipped cream round it, or pour a custard into the dish. For dessert it may be garnished with dice of the palest apple-jelly. Juice of red currants, 1 lb. ; nonsuches, or codlings (pared and cored), lb.: 25 to 30 minutes. Sugar, 1^ lb.: 20 minutes. Ohs.—A portion of raspberries, if still in season, may be mixed with the currants for this gateau, should their flavour be liked. For other and excellent varieties of gateaux of fruit, see Newton solid, and Damson solid, Chapter XXI. Ripe peaches and nousuches will likewise do well for it. Codlings answer perfectly for the preceding receipt, and the preparation is of fine colour and very pleasant fla- vour : it ought to cut in clear firm slices. JELLIES. calf’s feet jelly. We hear inexperienced housekeepers frequently complain of the diffi- culty of rendering this jelly perfectly trans- parent ; but by mixing with the other ingre- dients, while quite cold, the whites, and the Modern jelly mould. crushed shells of a suf- ficient number of eggs, and allowing the head of scum which gathers on the jelly to remain undisturbed after it once forms, they wTill scarcely fail to obtain it clear. It should be strained through a thick flannel-bag of a conical form (placed before the fire, should the weather be at all cold, or the mixture will jelly before it lias rim through), and if not perfectly clear must be strained again and again till it become so ; though we generally find that once suffices. Mix thoroughly in a large516 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XX. stewpan five half pints of strong calf’s feet stock (see page 506), a full pint of sherry, half a pound of sugar, roughly powdered, the juice of two fine lemons, the rind of one and a half cut very thin, the whites and shells of four large eggs, and half an ounce of isinglass. Let these remain a few minutes off the fire, that the sugar may dissolve more easily ; then let the jelly be brought to boil gradually, and do not stir it after it begins to heat. When it has boiled gently for sixteen minutes, draw it from the fire, and let it stand a short time before it is poured into the jelly-bag, under which a bowl should be placed to receive it. When clear and cool, put it into moulds that have been laid for some hours in water : these should always be of earthen- ware In preference to metal. If to be served in glasses, or roughed, the jelly will be sufficiently firm without the isinglass, of which, however, we recommend a small quantity to be thrown in always when the jelly begins to boil, as it facilitates the clearing. Calf’s feet stock, 2J pints; sugar, J lb.; sherry, 1 pint; juice of lemons, 2 large ; rind of 1 \ ; whites and shells of eggs, 4 large, or 5 small: 16 minutes. Ohs. 1.—After all the jelly has dropped through the bag, an exceedingly agreeable beverage is obtained by pouring in some boiling water ; from one to three half- pints, according to the quantity of jelly which has been made. The same plan should be pursued in making orange or lemon jelly for an invalid. Ohs. 2.—As it is essential to the transparency of calf’s feet jelly of all kinds that the whole of the ingredients should be quite cold when they are mixed, and as the stock can only be measured in a liquid state, to which it must be reduced by heating, the better plan is, to measure it when it is first strained from the feet, and to put apart the exact quantity required for a receipt; but when this has not been done, and it is necessary to liquefy it, it must be left till quite cold again before it is used.517 SWEET DISHES. CHAP. XX.] ANOTHER RECEIPT FOR CALF’S FEET JELLY. To four calf’s feet, well cleaned and divided, pour a gallon of water, and let them stew until it is reduced to rather less than two quarts ; or if, after the flesh has quite fallen from the bones, the liquor on being strained off should exceed that quantity, reduce it by rapid boiling in a clean uncovered pan over a very clear fire. When it is perfectly firm and cold, take it, clear of fat and sediment, and add to it a bottle of sherry, which should be of good quality (for poor, thin wines are not well adapted to the purpose), three-quarters of a pound of sugar broken small, the juice of five large or of six moderate-sized lemons, and the whites, with the shells finely crushed, of seven eggs, or of more, should they be very small. The rinds of three lemons, pared ex- tremely thin, may be thrown into the jelly a few minutes before it is taken from the fire > or they may be put into the jelly-bag previously to its being poured through, when they will impart to it a slight and delicate flavour, without deepening its colour much. If it is to be moulded, something more than half an ounce of isinglass should be dropped lightly in where the liquid becomes visible through the head of scum, when the mixture begins to boil; for if not sufficiently firm, it will break when it is dished. It may be roughed, or served in glasses without this addition; and in a liquid state will be found an admirable ingredient for Oxford or other punch. Calf’s feet, 4 ; water, 1 gallon; to be reduced more than half. Sherry, 1 bottle; sugar, f lb. (more to taste); juice of 5 large lemons, or of six moderate- sized ; whites and shells of 7 eggs, or more if small ; rinds of lemons, 3 (for moulding, nearly f oz. of isinglass) : 15 to 20 minutes. Obs.—An excellent and wholesome jelly for young people may be made with good orange or raisin wine, instead of sherry ; to either of these the juice of three or[CHAP. XX. MODERN COOKERY. 518 four oranges, with a small portion of the rind, may be added instead of part of the lemons. APPLE calf’s FEET JELLY. Pour a quart of prepared apple-juice (see page 509) on a pound of fresh apples pared and cored, and simmer them till well broken; strain the juice, and let it stand till cold, then measure, and put a pint and a half of it into a stewpan with a quart of calf’s feet stock (see page 500), nine ounces of sugar broken small, or roughly pounded, the juice of two fine lemons, and the thin rinds of one and a half, with the whites and shells of eight eggs. Let it boil gently for ten minutes, then strain it through a flannel-bag, and when cool put it into moulds. It will be very clear, and firm, and of pleasant flavour. Apples of good quality should be used for it, and the quantity of sugar must be regulated by the time of year, as the fruit will have lost much of its acidity during the latter part of the season. This receipt, which is the result of our own experiment, and which we have found very successful, was first tried just after Christmas, with pearmains and Ripstone pippins. A little syrup of preserved ginger, or a small glass of fine white brandy, would perhaps, to some tastes, improve the jelly; but we give it simply as w^e have proved it ourselves. Prepared apple juice, 1 quart; fresh apples, 1 lb. : ^ to | hour. Strained juice, 1J pint; calf’s feet stock, 1 quart; sugar, 9 ozs.; juice of lemons, 2 ; rind of 1| ; whites and shells of eggs, 8 : 10 minutes. Obs.—We would recommend the substitution of quinces for apples in this receipt as likely to afford a very agreeable variety: or equal portions of the two fruits might answer well. Unless the stock be very stiff, add isinglass to this, as to the calf’s feet jelly, when it is to be moulded. ORANGE calf’s FEET JELLY. To a pint and a half of firm calf’s feet stock, put a519 €HAP. XX.J SWEET DISHES. pint of strained China orange juice, mixed with that of one or two pemons; add to these six ounces of sugar, broken small* the very thin rinds of three oranges and of one lemon, and the whites of six eggs with half the shells crushed small. Stir these gently over a clear fire until the head of scum begins to form, but not at all afterwards. Simmer the jelly for ten minutes from the first full boil; take it from the fire, let it stand a little, then pour it through a jelly-bag till perfectly clear. This is an original, and an entirely new receipt, which we can recommend to the reader, the jelly being very pale, beautifully transparent, and delicate in flavour: it would, we think, be peculiarly acceptable to such invalids as are forbidden to take wine in any form. The proportions both of sugar and of lemon-juice must be somewhat varied according to the season in which the oranges are used. Strong calf's feet stock, 1^ pint; strained orange-juice, mixed with a small portion of lemon-juice, 1 pint; sugar, 6 ozs.; rinds of oranges, 3; of lemon, 1 : 10 minutes. Ohs.—A small pinch of isinglass thrown into the jelly when it begins to boil will much assist to clear it. When the flavour of Seville oranges is liked, two or three can be used with the sweet ones. ORANGE ISINGLASS JELLY. To render this perfectly transparent the juice of the fruit must be filtered, and the isinglass clarified ; but it is not usual to take so much trouble for it. Strain as clear as possible, first through a sieve or muslin, then through a thick cloth or jelly bag, one quart of China orange- juice, mixed with as much lemon-juice as will give an agreeable degree of acidity, or with a small proportion of Seville orange-juice. Dissolve two ounces and a half of isinglass in a pint of water, skim it well, throw in half a pound of sugar, and a few strips of the orange-rind, pour in the orange-juice, stir the whole well together, skim it clean and without allowing it to boil; strain it through a cloth or through a muslin,[CHAP. XX. 520 MODERN COOKERY. many times folded. When nearly cold put it into the moulds. This jelly is sometimes made without any water, by dissolving the isinglass and sugar in the juice of the fruit.

This is one of the fanciful dishes which make a pretty appearance on a supper table, and are acceptable when much variety is de- sired. Take some very fine China oranges, and with the point of a small knife cut out from the top of each a round about the size of a shilling ; then with the small end of a tea or egg spoon, empty them entirely, taking great care not to break the rinds. Throw these into cold water, and make jelly of the juice, which must be well drained from the pulp, and strained as clear as possible. Colour one-half a fine rose colour with prepared cochineal, and leave the other very pale; when it is nearly cold, drain and wipe the orange rinds, and fill them with alternate stripes of the two jellies; when they are perfectly cold cut them in quarters, and dispose them tastefully in a dish with a few light branches of myrtle between them. Calf’s feet or any other variety of jelly, or different blamanges, may be used at choice to fill the rinds : the colours, however, should contrast as much as possible. LEMON calf’s FEET JELLY. * Break up a quart of strong calf’s-feet stock, which * In France, orange-jelly is very commonly served in the halved rinds of the fruit, or in little baskets made as we shall hereafter direct. See Appendix.CHAP. XX.] SWEET DISHES. 521 should have been measured while in a liquid state; let it be quite clear of fat and sediment, for which a small additional quantity should be allowed; add to it a not very full half-pint of strained lemon-juice, and ten ounces of sugar, broken small (rather more or less according to the state of the fruit), the rind of one lemon pared as thin as possible, or of from two to three when a full flavour of it is liked, and the whites, with part of the shells crushed small, of five large or of six small eggs. Proceed as for the preceding jellies, and when the mixture has boiled five minutes throw in a small pinch of isinglass; continue the boiling for five or six minutes longer, draw the pan from the fire, let it stand to settle; then turn it into the jelly-bag. We have found it always perfectly clear with once passing through; but should it not be so, pour it in a second time. Strong calf’s feet stock, 1 quart; strained lemon- juice, short \ pint; sugar, 10 ozs. (more or less according to state of fruit); rind of from 1 to 8 large lemons ; whites and part of shells of 5 large or 6 small eggs : 5 minutes. Pinch of isinglass : 5 minutes longer. Obs.—About seven large lemons will produce the half pint of juice. This quantity is for one mould only. The jelly will he found almost colourless unless much of the rinds be used, and as perfectly transparent as clear spring, water : it is also very agreeable in flavour. For variety, part of the juice of the fruit might be omitted, and its place supplied by marischino, or any other rich white liqueur of appropriate flavour. CONSTANTIA JELLY. Infuse in a pint of water for five minutes the rind of half a Seville orange, pared extremely thin; add an ounce of isinglass; and when this is dissolved throw in four ounces of good sugar in lumps ; stir well, and sim- mer the whole for a few minutes, then mix with it four large wineglassesful of Constantia, and strain the jelly[CHAP. XX.

We had this jelly made in the first instance for an invalid who was forbidden to take acids, and it proved so agreeable in flavour that we can re- commend it for the table. The isinglass, with an additional quarter-ounce, might be clarified, and the sugar and orange-rind boiled with it afterwards. Water, 1 pint; rind -J Seville orange: 5 minutes. Isinglass, 1 oz.; sugar, 4 ozs.: 5 to 7 minutes. Con- stants, 4 large wineglassesful. STRAWBERRY ISINGLASS JELLY. A great variety of equally elegant and excellent jellies for the table may be made with clarified isinglass, clear syrup, and the juice of almost any kind of fresh fruit; but as the process of making them is nearly the same for all, we shall limit our receipts to one or two, which will serve to direct the makers* for the rest. Boil together quickly for fifteen minutes one pint of water and three-quarters of a pound of very good sugar ; measure a quart of ripe richly-flavoured strawberries without their stalks ; the scarlet answer best from the colour which they give; on these pour the boiling syrup, and let them stand all night. The next day clarify two ounces and a half of isinglass in a pint of water, as directed at the beginning of this chapter ; drain the syrup from the strawberries very closely, add to it two or three tablespoonsful of red currant juice, and the clear juice of one large or of two small lemons ; and when the isinglass is nearly cold mix the whole, and put it into moulds. The French, who excel in these fruit-jellies, always mix the separate ingredients when they are almost cold ; and they also place them over ice for an hour or so after they are moulded, which is a great advantage, as they then require less isinglass, and are in consequence much more delicate. When the fruit abounds, instead of throwing it into theCHAP. XX.] 523 SWEET DISHES. syrup, bruise lightly from three to four pints, throw two tablespoonsful of sugar over them, and let the juice flow from them for an hour or two ; then pour a little water over, and use the juice without boiling, which will give a jelly of finer flavour than the other. Water, 1 pint; sugar, f lb. : 15 minutes. Straw- berries, 1 quart; isinglass, 21 ozs. ; water, 1 pint (white of egg 1 to 2 teaspoonful) ; juice, 1 large or 2 small lemons. Obs.—The juice of any fruit mixed with sufficient sugar to sweeten, and of isinglass to stiffen it, with as much lemon-juice as will take off the insipidity of the flavour, will serve for this kind of jelly. Pine-apples, peaches, and such other fruits as do not yield much juice, iriust be infused in a larger quantity of syrup, which must then be used in lieu of it. In this same manner jellies are made with various kinds of wine and liqueurs, and with the ingredients for punch as well; but we cannot further multiply our receipts for them. FANCY JELLIES. To give greater transparency of ap- pearance to jelly, it is made often in a mould of this form, or a variation of it, somewhat resem- bling the lower com- partment of this. The space left in the centre is sometimes filled with very light, whipped cream, fla- voured and coloured so as to eat agree- ably with it, and to please the eye as well: this may be Mould with cylinder.524 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XX. tastefully garnished with preserved or fresh fruit. Italian jelly is made by half-filling a mould of this, or any of more convenient shape, and laying round upon' it in a chain, as soon as it is set, some blamange made rather firm, and cut of equal thickness and size with a small round cutter; the mould is then filled with the remainder of the jelly v which must be nearly cold, but not beginning to set. Brandied morella cherries, drained very dry, are sometimes dropped into moulds of pale jelly; and fruits, either fresh or preserved, are arranged in them with exceedingly good effect when skilfully managed; but this is best accomplished by having a mould for the purpose, with another of smaller size fixed in it by means of slight wires, which hook on to the edge of the outer one. By pouring water into this it may easily be detached from the jelly; the fruit is then to be placed in the space left by it, and the whole filled up with more jelly : to give the proper effect, it must be recol- lected that the dish will be reversed when sent to table. QUEEN MAB’s PUDDING. (An elegant summer dish.) Throw into a pint of new milk the thin rind of a small lemon, and six or eight bitter almonds, blanched and bruised ; or substitute for these half a pod of vanilla, cut small, heat it slowly by the side of the fire, and keep it at the point of boiling until it is strongly flavoured, then add a small pinch of salt, and three-quarters of an ounce of the finest isinglass, or a full ounce should the weather be extremely warm ; when this is dissolved, strain the milk through a muslin, and put it into a clean saucepan, with four ounces and a half of sugar in lumps, and half a pint of rich cream; give the whole one boil, and then stir it briskly and by degrees to the well- beaten yolks of six fresh eggs; next, thicken the mixture as a custard, over a gentle fire, but do not hazard its curdling ; when it is of tolerable consistency, pour it out, and continue the stirring until it is half cold, then mix with it an ounce and a half of candied citron,CHAP. XX.] SWEET DISHES. 525 cut in small spikes, and a couple of ounces of dried cherries, and pour it into a mould rubbed with a drop of oil; when turned out it will have the appearance of a pudding. From two to three ounces of preserved ginger, well-drained and sliced, may be substituted for the cherries, and an ounce of pistachio-nuts, blanched and split, for the citron; these will make an elegant variety of the dish, and the syrup of the ginger, poured round as sauce, will be a further improvement. Cur- rants steamed till tender, and candied orange or lemon- rind, are often used instead of the cherries, and the well- sweetened juice of strawberries, raspberries (white or red), apricots, peaches, or syrup of pine-apple, will make an agreeable sauce; a small quantity of this last will also give a delicious flavour to the pudding itself, when mixed with the other ingredients. Cream may be substituted entirely for the milk, when its richness is considered desirable. New milk, 1 pint; rind 1 small lemon; bitter almonds, 6 to 8 (or, vanilla, \ pod); salt, few grains; isinglass, § oz. (1 oz. in sultry weather) ; sugar, 4^ ozs.; cream, \ pint; yolks, 6 eggs ; dried cherries, 2 ozs. ; candied citron, 11 oz. (or, preserved ginger, 2 to 3 ozs., and the syrup as sauce, and 1 oz. of blanched pistachio- nuts ; or 4 ozs. currants, steamed 20 minutes, and 2 ozs. candied orange-rind). For sauce, sweetened juice of strawberries, raspberries, or plums, or pine-apple syrup. Obs.—The currants should be steamed in an earthen cullender, placed over a saucepan of boiling water, and covered with the lid. It will be a great improvement to place the pudding over ice for an hour before it is served, NESSELRODE CREAM.

XX. 526 minutes, add to them two ounces of fine sugar, and let them stew very gently until they are perfectly tender ; then drain them from the water, pound them, while still warm, to a smooth paste, and press them through the back of a fine sieve. While this is being done, dissolve half an ounce of isinglass in two or three spoonsful of water, and put to it as much cream as will, with the small quantity of water used, make half a pint; two ounces of sugar, about the third of a pod of vanilla, cut small, and wTell bruised, and a strip or two of fresh lemon-rind, pared extremely thin. Give these a minute’s boil, and then keep them quite hot by the side of the fire, until a strong flavour of the vanilla is obtained. Now, mix gradually with the chestnuts half a pint of rich, unboiled cream, strain the other half pint through a fine muslin, and work the whole well together until it becomes very thick ; then stir to it a couple of ounces of dried cherries, cut into quarters, and two of candied citron, divided into very small dice. Press the mixture into a mould which has been rubbed with a particle of the purest salad-oil, and in a few hours it will be ready for table. The cream should be sufficiently stiff, when the fruit is added, to prevent its sinking to the bottom, and both kinds should be dry when they are used. Chestnuts, large, 24; water, j pint; sugar, 2 ozs. ; isinglass, \ oz.; water, 8 to 4 tablespoonsful; cream, nearly \ pint; vanilla, J of pod; lemon-rind, J of 1 large: infuse 20 minutes or more.

Ohs.—When vanilla cannot easily be obtained, a little noyau may be substituted for it, but a full weight of isinglass must then be used. Both this receipt and the following one are entirely new, and our directions for them must be followed with exactness, should the reader wish to ensure their success.

XX.] SWEET DISHES. chestnuts; mix with them gradually, after they have been pressed through a fine sieve, half a pint of rich sweet cream, dissolve in half a pint of new milk a half ounce of isinglass, then add to them from six to eight bitter almonds, blanched and bruised, with two-thirds of the rind of a small lemon, cut extremely thin, and two ounces and a half of sugar; let these simmer gently for five minutes, and then remain by the side of the fire for a while. When the milk is strongly flavoured, strain it through muslin, press the whole of it through, and stir it by degrees to the chestnuts and cream ; beat the mix- ture smooth, and when it begins to thicken put it into a mould rubbed with oil, or in one that has been dipped in water and shaken nearly free of the moisture. If put into a cool place, it will be ready for table in six or eight hours. It has a pretty appearance when partially stuck with pistachio-nuts, blanched, dried, and cut in spikes, their bright green colour rendering them very orna- mental to dishes of this sort: as they are, however, much more expensive than almonds, they can be used more sparingly, or intermingled with spikes of the firm outer-rind of candied citron.

Cream, ^ pint; new milk, J pint; isinglass \ oz.; bitter almonds, 6 to 8 ; lemon- rind, two-thirds of 1 ; sugar, 2J ozs.* Obs.—This is a very delicate kind of sweet dish, which we can particularly recommend to our readers: it may be rendered more recherche by a flavouring of maras- chino, but must then have a little addition of isinglass. The preparation, without this last ingredient, will be found excellent iced. SWISS CREAM, OR TRIFLE. ( Very good.)

Take a quarter- pound of macaroons, cover the bottom of a glass dish with a portion of them, pour in a part of the cream, lay the remainder of the macaroons upon it, add the rest of the cream, and ornament it with candied citron, sliced thin. It should be made the day before it is wanted for table. The requisite flavour may be given to this dish by infusing in the cream' the very thin rind of a lemon, and part of a stick of cinnamon, slightly bruised, and then straining it before the flour is added; or, these and the sugar may be boiled together, with two or three spoonsful of water, to a strongly flavoured syrup, which, after having been passed through a muslin strainer, may be stirred into the cream. Some cooks boil the cinna- mon and the grated rind of a lemon with all the other ingredients, but the cream has then to be pressed through a sieve after it is made, a process which it is always desirable to avoid. Rich cream, 1 pint; sugar, 6 ozs.; rind, 1 lemon; cinnamon, 1 drachm; flour, 4 teaspoonsful; juice, 2 lemons; macaroons, 4 ozs.; candied citron, 1 to 2 ozs. TIPSY CAKEf, OR BRANDY TRIFLE. The old-fashioned mode of preparing this dish was to soak a light sponge or Savoy cake in as much good French brandy as it could absorb ; then, to stick it full of blanched almonds cut into whole-length spikes, and to pour a rich cold boiled custard round it. It is more usual now to mix one glass of brandy with three of wine, to pour over the cake : with this the juice of half a lemon is sometimes mixed.CHAP. XX.] 529 SWEET DISHES. Chantilly Basket. FILLED WITH WHIPPED CREAM AND FRESH STRAWBERRIES. Take a mould of any sort that will serve to form the basket on, just dip the edge of some macaroons in melted barley sugar, and fasten them together with it; take it out of the mould, keep it in a dry place till wanted, then fill it high with whipped strawberry cream which has been drained on a sieve from the preceding day, and stick very fine ripe strawberries over it. It should not be filled until just before it is served.* CREME MERINGUEE. Infuse in a pint of new milk the very thin rind of a lemon, with four or five bitter almonds bruised. As the quantity should not be reduced, it should be kept by the side of the fire until strongly flavoured, and not be allowed to boil more than two or three minutes. Sweeten it with three ounces of fine sugar in lumps, and when this is dissolved, strain, and mix the milk with half a pint of cream, then stir the whole gradually to the well-beaten yolks of six fresh eggs, and thicken it like boiled custard. Put it, when cold, into a deep dish, beat to a solid froth the whites of the six eggs, mix them with five tablespoonsful of pounded and sifted * For more minute direction, see Appendix. M M530 [CHAP.

New milk, 1 pint; rind of 1 lemon ; bitter almonds^ 5; sugar, 3 ozs.; cream, J pint; yolks of eggs, 6; frothed whites of eggs, 6 ; sifted sugar, 5 tablespoons- ful: baked \ hour. LEMON-CREAM, MADE WITHOUT CREAM. Pour on the very thin rinds of two fresh lemons, and a pound of fine sugar broken small, or roughly pow- dered, one pint of boiling water, and let them remain an hour ; then add the whites of six eggs and the yolks of two, previously well beaten together, and the juice of six lemons; mix these thoroughly, strain the whole into a deep jug, set this into a pan of boiling water, and stir the cream without intermission until it is well thickened; pour it out; continue the stirring at inter- vals until it is nearly cold, when it may be put into the glasses. In cool weather, this cream will remain good for several days, and it should always be made at least twenty-four hours before it is served. Lemon rinds, 2 ; sugar, 1 lb.; water, 1 pint: 1 hour. "Whites of 6 eggs; yolks of 2 ; juice of 6 lemons. VERY GOOD LEMON CREAMS. Pour over the very thin rinds of two moderate sized but perfectly sound, fresh lemons, and six ounces of sugar, half a pint of spring water, and let them remain six hours ; add then the strained juice of the lemons, and five fresh eggs well beaten, and also strained ; take out the lemon rind, and stir the mixture without ceasing over a gentle fire until it has boiled softly from six to eight minutes: it will not curdle as it would did milk supply the place of the water and lemon-juice. The creams are, we think, more delicate, though not quite so thick, when the yolks only of six eggs are used for them. They will keep well for nearly a week in really cold weather. Rinds of lemons, 2 ; sugar, 6 ozs. (or 8 when a veryCHAP. XX.] SWEET DISHES. 531 sweet dish is preferred) ; cold water, \ pint: G hours. Juice of lemons, 2; eggs, 5 : to be boiled softly 6 to 8 minutes. Obs.—Lemon-creams may, on occasion, be more ex- peditiously prepared, by rasping the rind of the fruit upon the sugar which is used for them; or, by paring it thin, and boiling it for a few minutes with the lemon- juice, sugar, and water, before they are stirred to the eggs. FRUIT CREAMS, AND ITALIAN CREAMS. These are very quickly and easily made, by mixing with good cream a sufficient proportion of the sweetened juice of fresh fruit, or of well-made fruit jelly or jam, to flavour it: a few drops of prepared cochineal maybe added to deepen the colour when it is required for any particular purpose. A quarter-pint of strawberry or raspberry jelly will fully flavour a pint of cream : a very little lemon-juice improves almost all compositions of this sort. When jam is used, it must first be gradually mixed with the cream, and then worked through a sieve, to take out the seed or skin of the fruit. All fresh juice, for this purpose, must, of course, be cold : that of strawberries is best obtained by crushing the fruit and strewing sugar over it. Peaches, pine'apple, apricots, or nectarines, may be simmered for a few minutes in a little syrup, and this, drained well from them, will serve extremely well to mix with the cream when it has become thoroughly cold : the lemon-juice should be added to all of these. When the ingredients are well blended, lightly whisk or mill them to a froth ; take this off with a skimmer as it rises, and lay it on a fine sieve reversed to drain, or if it is to be served in glasses, fill them with it at once. Italian creams are either fruit-flavoured only, or mixed with wine like syllabubs, then whisked to a stiff froth .and put into a perforated mould, into which a muslin is first laid ; or into a small hair-sieve (which must also first be lined with the muslin), and left to drain until the following day, when the cream must be very gently532 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XX. turned out, and dished, and garnished as fancy may direct. VERY SUPERIOR WHIPPED SYLLABUBS. Weigh seven ounces of fine sugar and rasp on it the rinds of two fresh sound lemons of good size, then pound or roll it to powder, and put it into a bowl with the strained juice of the lemons, two large glasses of sherry, and two of brandy; when the sugar is nearly or quite dissolved add a pint of rich cream, and whisk or mill the mixture well; take off the froth as it rises, and put it into glasses. These syllabubs will remain good for several days, and should always be made if possible, four and twenty hours before they are wanted for table. The full flavour of the lemon-rind is obtained with less trouble than in rasping, by paring it very thin indeed, and infusing it for some hours in the juice of the fruit. Sugar, 7 ozs. ; rind and juice of lemons, 2; sherry, 2 large wineglassesful; brandy, 2 wineglassesful; cream, 1 pint. Obs.—These proportions are sufficient for two dozens or more of syllabubs : they are often made with almost equal quantities of wine and cream, but are certainly neither so good nor so wholesome without a portion of brandy. BLAMANGES. GOOD COMMON BL A MANGE ; OR, BLANC MANGER. {Author s Receipt.)

XX.] SWEET DISHES. 533 Boil them gently over a clear fire, stirring them often until this last is dissolved; take off the scum, stir in half a pint of rich cream, and strain the blamange into a bowl : it should be moved gently with a spoon till nearly cold to prevent the cream settling on the surface. Before it is moulded, mix with it by degrees a wineglass- ful of brandy. New milk, 1 j pint; rind of lemon, \ large or whole small 1; bitter almonds, 8 : infuse 1 hour. Sugar, 2 to 3 ozs.; isinglass, 1\ oz. : 10 minutes. Cream, J pint; brandy, 1 wineglassful. RICHER BLAMANGE. A pint of good cream with a pint of new milk, sweetened and flavoured as above, or with a little additional sugar, and the rind of one very fresh lemon with the same proportion of isinglass will make very good blamange. An ounce of Jordan almonds may be pounded and mixed with it, but they are not needed with the cream. JAUMANGE OR JAUNE MANGER, SOMETIMES CALLED DUTCH FLUMMERY. Pour on the very thin rind of a large lemon, and half a pound of sugar broken small, a pint of water, and keep them stirred over a gentle fire until they have sim- mered for three or four minutes, then leave the sauce- pan by the side of the stove that the syrup may taste well of the lemon. In ten or fifteen minutes add two ounces of isinglass, and stir the mixture often until* this is dissolved, then throw in the strained juice of four sound, moderate-sized lemons, and a pint of sherry; mix the whole briskly with the beaten yolks of eight fresh eggs, and then pass it through a delicately clean hair-sieve; next thicken it in a jar or jug placed in a pan of boiling water, turn it into a bowl, and when it has become cool, and been allowed to settle for a minute or two, pour it into moulds that have been laid in water.534 MODERN COOKERY.

Crush [slightly, with a silver or wooden spoon, a quart, measured without their stalks, of fresh and richly-flavoured strawberries ; strew over them eight ounces of pounded sugar, and let them stand three or four hours; then turn them on to a fine hair-sieve reversed, and press them through it. Melt over a gentle fire two ounces of the best isinglass in a pint of new milk, and sweeten it with four ounces of sugar; strain it through a muslin, and mix it with a pint and a quarter of sweet thick cream; keep these stirred until they are noarly or quite cold, then pour them gradually to the strawberries, whisking them briskly together; and last of all throw in, by small portions, the strained juice of a fine sound lemon. Mould the blamange, and set it in a very cool place for twelve hours or more, before it is served. Strawberries stalked, 1 quart; sugar, 8 ozs. ; isin- glass, 2 oz. ; new milk, 1 pint; sugar, 4 ozs.; cream, Ij pint; juice, 1 lemon. QITINCE BLAMANGE. (Delicious.) This, if carefully made, and with ripe quinces, is one of the most richly flavoured preparations of fruit that we have ever tasted; and the receipt, we may venture to say, will be altogether new to the reader. Dissolve in a pint of prepared juice of quinces, (see page 507), an ounce of the best isinglass; next, add ten ounces of sugar, roughly pounded, and stir these together gently over a clear fire, from twenty to thirty minutes, or until the juice jellies in falling from the535 SWEET DISHES. CHAP. XX.] spoon. Remove the scum carefully, and pour the boiling jelly gradually to half a pint of thick cream, stirring them briskly together as they are mixed ; they must be stirred until very nearly cold, and then poured into a mould which has been rubbed in every part with the smallest possible quantity of very pure salad-oil; or, if more convenient, into one that has been dipped into cold water. Juice of quinces, 1 pint; isinglass, 1 oz.: 5 to 10 minutes. Sugar, ] 0 ozs. : 20 to 30 minutes. Cream, i P™*- QUINCE BLAMANGE, WITH ALMOND CREAM. When cream is not procurable, which will sometimes happen in the depth of winter, almonds, if plentifully used, will afford a very good substitute, though the finer blamange is made from the foregoing receipt. On four ounces of almonds, blanched and beaten to the smoothest paste, and moistened in the pounding with a few drops of water, to prevent their oiling, pour a pint of boiling quince juice; stir them together, and turn them into a strong cloth, of which let the ends be held and twisted different ways by two persons, to express the cream from the almonds ; put the juice again on the fire, with half a pound of sugar, and when it boils, throw in nearly an ounce of fine isinglass ; simmer the whole five minutes, take off the scum, stir the blamange until it is nearly cold, then mould it for table. Increase the quantity both of this and of the preceding blamange when a large dish of either is required. Quince juice, 1 pint; Jordan almonds, 4 ozs.; sugar, \ lb.; isinglass, nearly 1 oz. : 5 minutes. APRICOT BLAMANGE ; OR, CREME PARISIENNE. Dissolve gently an ounce of fine isinglass in a pint of new milk or of thin cream, and strain it through a folded muslin; put it into a clean saucepan, with three ounces of sugar, broken into small lumps, and when it boils, stir to it half a pint of rich cream ; add it, at first,modern COOKERY. [chap. XX. 536- by spoonsful only, to eight ounces of the finest apricot jam, mix them very smoothly, and stir the whole until it is nearly cold that the jam may not sink to the bottom of the mould: a tablespoonful of lemon juice will improve the flavour. When cream is scarce, use milk instead, with an additional quarter-ounce of isinglass, and enrich it by pouring it boiling on the same proportion of almonds as for the second quince blamange (see page 535). Cream can in all cases, be substituted entirely for the milk, when a very rich preparation is desired. Peach-jam will answer admirably for this receipt; but none of any kind should be used for it which has not been passed through a sieve when made. Isinglass, 1 oz. ; new milk, I pint; cream, \ pint; sugar, 3 ozs,; apricot-jam, lb.; lemon-juice, 1 table- spoonful. Or : peach-jam, \ lb.; cream, \\ pint. BLAMANGE RUBANE ; OR, STRIPED BLAMANGE. Make, in the ordinary way, but a little firmer, one quart or two of blamange, according to the number of moulds that are to be filled ; divide it into three or four equal portions ; add to one, sufficient prepared spinage juice (see page 508), to colour it a full or a pale green ; to another, some liquid cochineal or carmine;* to a third, should further variety be desired, a few drops of a strong infusion of saffron, or if its peculiar flavour be objected to, stir quickly some of the blamange quite boiling, to the well beaten yolks of three or four fresh eggs, and thicken it a little over a gentle fire with an additional spoonful or two of milk, for unless the whole be nearly of the same consistency, it will be liable to separate in the unmoulding. Chocolate, first boiled very smooth in a small quantity of water, will give an additional colour; and some firm, clear isinglass, or calf’s-foot-jelly, may be used for an occasional stripe, where great variety is desired. The different kinds of * This may be purchased at the chemists, when the trouble of preparing it is objected to.CHAP. XX.] SWEET DISHES. 537 blamange should be poured into the mould in half-inch depths, when so cool as to be only just liquid, and one colour must be perfectly cold before another is added, or they will run together, and spoil the appearance of the dish. When ice is not procurable, the moulds in warm weather may beset into water, mixed with plenty of salt and saltpetre : the insides should be rubbed with a drop of very pure salad oil, instead of being laid into fresh water, as usual. AN APPLE HEDGE-HOG, OR SUEDOISE. This dish is formed of ap- ples, pared, cored without being divided, and stewed to- lerably tender in a light syrup. These are placed in a dish, after being well drained, and filled with apricot, or any other rich marmalade, and arranged in two or more layers, so as to give, when the whole is complete, the form shown in the en- graving. The number required must depend on the size of the dish. From three to five pounds more must be stewed down into a smooth and dry marmalade, and with this, all the spaces between them are to be filled up, and the whole are to be covered with it; an icing of two eggs, beaten to a very solid froth, and mixed with two heaped tablespoonsful of sugar must then be spread evenly over the suedoise, fine sugar sifted on this, and spikes of blanched almonds, cut lengthwise, stuck over the entire surface ; the dish is then to be placed in a moderate oven till the almonds are browned, but not too deeply, and the apples are hot through. It is not easy to give the required form with less than fifteen apples; eight of these may first be simmered in a syrup made with half a pint of water and six ounces of sugar, and the remainder may be thrown in after538 [CHAP. XX. MODERN COOKERY. these are lifted out. Care must be taken to keep them firm. The marmalade should be sweet, and pleasantly flavoured with lemon. IMPERIAL GOOSEBERRY-FOOL. Simmer a pound of green gooseberries from which have been freed the buds and stalks, in three-quarters of a pint of water, until they are well broken, then strain them, and to half a pound of the juice add half a pound of sugar, broken small: boil these together for fifteen minutes. Dissolve half an ounce of isinglass in a quarter-pint of rich cream, pour them into a basin and stir them till only lukewarm, then mix them by degrees with the sugar and gooseberry-juice, which should also have been allowed to cool; add the strained juice of half a small lemon, and mould the mixture, which should stand at least twelve hours in a cool place before it is turned out. These proportions are sufficient for a small mould only, and must be doubled for a large one. The dish is too sweet for our own taste, but as it has been highly approved by several persons who have tasted it, we give the receipt exactly as we had it tried in the first instance : it will be found easy to vary it. VERY GOOD OLD-FASHIONED BOILED CUSTARD. Throw into a pint and a half of new milk, the very thin rind of a fresh lemon, and let it infuse for half an hour, then simmer them together for a few minutes, and add four ounces and a half of white sugar. Beat thoroughly the yolks of fourteen fresh eggs, mix with them another half pint of new milk, stir the boiling milk quickly to them, take out the lemon-peel, and turn the custard into a deep jug; set this over the fire in a pan of boiling water, and keep the custard stirred gently, but without ceasing, until it begins to thicken; then move the spoon rather more quickly, making it always touch the bottom of the jug, until the mixture is brought to the point of boiling, when it must be instantly taken from the fire, or it will curdle in aCHAP.

Pour it into a bowl, and keep it stirred until nearly cold, then add to it by degrees a wineglassful of good brandy, and two ounces of blanched almonds cut lengthwise into strips. A few bitter ones bruised, can be boiled in the milk in lieu of lemon-peel, when their flavour is preferred. New milk, 1 quart; rind of 1 lemon; sugar, 4j ozs.; yolks of eggs, 14; salt, J saltspoonful. RICH BOILED CUSTARD. Take a small cupful from a quart of fresh cream, and simmer the remainder for a few minutes with four ounces of sugar and the rind of a lemon, or give it any other flavour that may be preferred. Beat and strain the yolks of eight eggs, mix them with the cupful of cream, and stir the rest boiling to them : thicken the custard like the preceding one.

On the beaten and strained yolks of twelve new laid eggs pour a pint and a half of boiling cream which has been sweetened, with three ounces of sugar; add the smallest pinch of salt, and thicken the custard as usual. When nearly cold, flavour it with a glass and a half of noyau, maraschino, or cuirasseau; add the sliced al- monds or not, at pleasure. Yolks of eggs, 12; cream, 1\ pint* sugar, 3 ozs; little salt; noyau, maraschino, or cuirasseau, 1-| wine- glassful. CURRANT CUSTARD. Boil in a pint of clear currant juice ten ounces of sugar for three minutes, take off the scum, and pour the boiling juice on eight w7ell beaten eggs; thicken the custard in a jug set into a pan of water, pour it out, stir it till nearly cold, then add to it carefully, and by degrees, half a pint of rich cream, and last of all, two540 [CHAP. XX. MODERN COOKERY. tablespoonsful of strained lemon-juice. When the currants are very ripe omit one ounce of the sugar. White currants and strawberries, cherries, red or white raspberries, or a mixture of any of these fruits, may be used for these custards with good effect: they are excellent. Currant-juice, 1 pint; sugar, 10 ozs. : 3 minutes. Eggs, 8; cream, ~ pint; lemon-juice, 2 tablespoonsful. QUINCE OR APPLE CUSTARDS. Add to a pint of apple-juice prepared as for jelly, a tablespoonful of strained lemon juice, and from four to six ounces of sugar according to the acidity of the fruit; stir these boiling, quickly, and in small portions, to eight well beaten eggs, and thicken the custard in a jug placed in a pan of boiling water, in the usual manner. A larger proportion of lemon-juice and a high flavour- ing of the rind can be given when approved. For quince custards, which if well made are excellent, observe the same directions as for the apple, but omit the lemon- juice. As we have before observed, all custards are much finer when made with the yolks only of the eggs, of which the number must be increased nearly half, when this is done. Prepared apple-juice (see page 509), 1 pint; lemon- juice, 1 tablespoonful; sugar, 4 to 6 ozs.; eggs, 8. Quince custards, same proportions but no lemon-juice. Obs.—In making lemon-creams the apple-juice may be substituted very advantageously for water, without varying the receipts in other respects. THE duke’s CUSTARD. Drain well from their juice, and then roll in dry sifted sugar, as many fine brandied Morelia cherries as will cover thickly tbe bottom of the dish in which this is to be sent to table ; arrange them in it, and pour over them from a pint to a pint and a half of rich cold boiled custard; garnish the edge with macaroons or Naples biscuits, or pile upon the custard some solid54-1 CHAP.

Brandied Mosella cherries, J to whole pint; boiled custard, from 1 to pint; thick cream, ^ pint or more; brandy, 1 to 2 glassesful; sugar, 2 to 3 ozs.; juice of \ large lemon ; prepared cochineal, or carmine, 20 to 40 drops. CHOCOLATE CUSTARDS. Dissolve gently by the side of the fire an ounce and a half of the best chocolate in rather more than a wine- glassful of water, and then boil it until it is perfectly smooth ; mix with it a pint of milk well flavoured with lemon-peel or vanilla, add two ounces of fine sugar, and when the whole boils, stir it to five well-beaten eggs that have been strained. Put the custard into a jar or jug, set it into a pan of boiling water, and stir it with- out ceasing until it is thick. Do not put it into glasses or a dish till nearly or quite cold. These, as well as all other custards, are infinitely finer when made with the yolks only of the eggs, of which the number must then be increased. Two ounces of chocolate, a pint of milk, half a pint of cream, two ounces and a half or three ounces of sugar, and eight yolks of eggs, will make very superior custards of this kind. Rasped chocolate, 1 \ oz.; water, 1 large wineglass- ful : 5 to 8 minutes. New milk, 1 pint; eggs, 5; sugar, 2 ozs. Or, chocolate, 2 ozs.; water, J pint; new milk, 1 pint; sugar, to 3 ozs.; cream, \ pint; yolks of eggs, 8. Ohs.—Either of these may he moulded by dissolving from half to three quarters of an ounce of isinglass in the milk. The proportion of chocolate can be increased to the taste. COMMON BAKED CUSTARD. Mix a quart of new milk with eight well beaten eggs, strain the mixture through a fine sieve, and sweeten it with from five to eight ounces of sugar, according to the taste ; add a small pinch of salt, and pour the custard542 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XX. into a deep dish with or without a lining or rim of paste, grate nutmeg or lemon rind over the top, and bake it in a very slow oven from twenty to thirty minutes, or longer, should it not be firm in the centre. A custard, if well made, and properly baked, will be quite smooth when cut, without the honey-combed appearance which a hot oven gives; and there will be no whey in the dish. New milk, 1 quart; eggs, 8 ; sugar, 5 to 8 ozs. ; salt, J saltspoonful; nutmeg or lemon-grate: baked, slow oven, 20 to 30 minutes, or more. A FINER BAKED CUSTARD. Boil together gently, for five minutes, a pint and a half of new milk, a few grains of salt, the very thin rind of a lemon, and six ounces of loaf sugar; stir these boiling, but very gradually to the well beaten yolks of ten fresh eggs, and the whites of four; strain the mix- ture, and add to it half a pint of good cream ; let it cool, and then flavour it with a few spoonsful of brandy, or a little ratifia; finish and bake it by the directions given for the common custard above; or pour it into small well buttered cups, and bake it very slowly from ten to twelve minutes. FRENCH CUSTARDS. To a quart of new milk allow the yolks of twelve fresh eggs, but to equal parts of milk and cream of ten only. From six to eight ounces of sugar will sweeten the custard sufficiently for general taste, but more can be added at will; boil this for a few minutes gently in the milk with a grain or two of salt, and stir the mixture briskly to the eggs, as soon as it is taken from the fire. Butter a round deep dish, pour in the custard, and place it in a pan of water at the point of boiling, taking care that it shall not reach to within an inch of the edge ; let it just simmer, and no more, from an hour to an hour and a half : when quite firm in the middle, it will be done. A very few live embers should be kept on the543 CHAP. XX.] SWEET DISHES. lid of the stewpan to prevent the steam falling from it into the custard. When none is at hand of a form to allow of this, it is better to use a charcoal fire, and to lay an oven-leaf, or tin, over the pan, and the embers in the centre. The small French furnace, shewn in Chapter XXI., is exceedingly convenient for preparations of this kind; and there is always more or less of difficulty in keeping a coal fire entirely free from smoke for any length of time. Serve the custard cold, with chopped macaroons, or ratifias, laid thickly round the edge so as to form a border an inch deep. A few petals of fresh orange-blossom infused in the milk, will give it a most agreeable flavour, very superior to that derived from the distilled water. Half a pod of vanilla, cut in short lengths, and well bruised, may be used instead of either ; but the milk should then stand some time by the fire before or after it boils, and it must be strained through a muslin before it is added to the eggs, as the small seed of the vanilla would probably pass through a sieve. New milk, 1 quart; yolks of eggs, 12; sugar, 6 to 8 ozs. Or : new milk, 1 pint; cream, 1 pint; yolks of eggs, 10; flavouring of orange-flowers or vanilla : sim- mered in water-bath, 1 hour to lj. GERMAN PUFFS. Pound to a perfectly smooth paste two ounces of Jordan almonds and six bitter ones ; mix with them, by slow degrees, the yolks of six, and the whites of three eggs. Dissolve in half a pint of rich cream, four ounces of fresh butter, and two of fine sugar; pour these hot to the eggs, stirring them briskly together, and when the mixture has become cool, flavour it with half a glass of brandy, of cuirasseau, or of orange-flower water ; or, in lieu of either, with a little lemon-brandy. Butter some cups thickly, and strew into them a few slices of candied citron, or orange rind; pour in the mixture, and bake the puffs twenty minutes, in a slow oven.

MERINGUE OF PEARS, OR OTHER FRUIT. Fill a deep tart disli nearly to the brim with stewed pears, and let them be something more than half covered with their juice. Whisk to a solid froth the whites of five eggs, stir to them five tablespoonsful of dry sifted sugar, and lay them lightly and equally over the fruit; put the meringue immediately into a moderate oven, and bake it half an hour. Cherries, bullaces, and damsons, with various other kinds of plums, first either stewed as for compotes (see page 510), or baked with sugar, as for winter use, answer as well as pears for this dish ; which may, likewise, be made of apples, peaches, apricots, or common plums boiled down quite to a marmalade, with sufficient sugar to sweeten them moderately : the skins and stones of these last should be removed, but a few of the blanched kernels may be added to the fruit.

Butter a plain mould, (around or square cake- tin will answer the pur- pose quite well,) and line it entirely with thin slices of the crumb of a stale loaf, cut so as to fit into it with great exactness, and dipped into clarified butter. When this is done, fill the mould to the brim with apple- marmalade; cover the top with slices of bread dipped in butter,, and on these place a dish, a large plate, or the cover of a French stewpan with a weight upon it.545 CHAP. XX.] SWEET DISHES* Send the charlotte to a brisk oven for three-quarters of an hour should it be small, and for an hour if large. Turn it out with great care, and serve it hot. If baked in a slack oven it will not take a proper de- gree of colour, and it will be liable to break in the dishing. The strips of bread must of course join very perfectly, for if any spaces were left between them the syrup of the fruit would escape, and destroy the good appearance of the dish. Should there not have been sufficient marmalade prepared to fill the mould en- tirely, a jar of quince, or apricot-jam, or of preserved cherries even, may be added to it with advantage. The butter should be well drained from the charlotte before it is taken from the mould ; and sugar may be sifted thickly over it before it is served, or it may be covered with any kind of clear red jelly. A more elegant, aud we think an easier mode of forming the crust, is to line the mould with small rounds of bread stamped out with a plain cake, or paste-cutter, then dipped in butter, and placed with the edges sufficiently one over the other to hold the fruit securely. | hour to 1 hour, quick oven. MARMALADE FOR THE CHARLOTTE. Weigh three pounds of good boiling apples, after they have been pared, cored, and quartered ; put them into a stewpan with six ounces of fresh butter, three- quarters of a pound of sugar beaten to powder, three- quarters of a teaspoonful of pounded cinnamon, and the strained juice of a lemon ; let these stew over a gentle fire, until they form a perfectly smooth and dry mar- malade ; keep them often stirred that they may not burn, and let them cool before they are put into the crust. This quantity is for a moderate-sized charlotte. A CHARLOTTE A LA PARISIENNE. This dish is sometimes called in England a Vienna cake ; and it is known here also, we believe, as a Gateaux N N546 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XX. de Bordeaux. Cut horizontally into half-inch slices a Savoy or sponge cake, and cover each slice with a different kind of preserve; replace them in their origi- nal form, and spread equally over the cake an icing made with the whites of three eggs, and four ounces of the finest pounded sugar; sift more sugar over it in every part, and put it into a very slack oven to dry. The eggs should be whisked to snow before they are used. One kind of preserve instead of several can be used for this dish; and a rice or a pound-cake on an emergency may supply the place of the savoy, or sponge biscuit. POMMES AU BEURRE. (.Buttered apples. Excellent.) Pare six or eight fine apples of a firm kind, but of a good cooking sort, and core without piercing them through, or dividing them ; fill the cavities with fresh butter, put a quarter-pound more cut small into a stewpan just large enough to contain the apples in a single layer, place them closely together on it, and stew them as softly as possible, turning them occa- sionally until they are almost sufficiently tender to serve; then strew upon them as much sifted sugar as will sweeten the dish highly, and a teaspoonful of pounded cinnamon; shake these well in and upon the fruit, and stew it for a few minutes longer. Lift it out, arrange it in a hot dish, put into each apple as much warm apricot-jam as it will contain, and lay a small quantity on the top; pour the syrup from the pan round but not on the fruit, and serve it imme- diately. Apples, 6 or 8; fresh butter, 4 ozs., just simmered till tender. Sugar, 6 to 8 ozs.; cinnamon, 1 teaspoon- ful : 5 minutes. Apricot-jam as needed. Obs.—Particular care must be taken to keep the apples entire; they should rather steam in a gentle heat -than boil. It is impossible to specify the precise time which will render them sufficiently tender, as thisCHAP. XX.] 547 SWEET DISHES. must depend greatly on the time of year and the sort of fruit. If the stewpan were placed in a very slow oven, the more regular heat of it would perhaps be better in its effect than the stewing. SUEDOISE OF PEACHES. Pare and divide four fine, ripe peaches, and let them just simmer from five to eight minutes in a syrup made with the third of a pint of water and three ounces of very white sugar, boiled together for fifteen minutes ; lift them out carefully into a deep dish, and pour about half the syrup over them, and into the remaining half throw a couple of pounds more of quite ripe peaches, and boil them to a perfectly smooth, dry pulp, or mar- malade, with as much additional sugar, in fine powder, as the nature of the fruit may require. Lift the other peaches from the syrup, and reduce it by very quick boiling, more than half. Spread a deep layer of the marmalade in a dish, arrange the peaches symmetrically round it, and fill all the spaces between them with the marmalade; place the half of a blanched peach-kernel in each, pour the reduced syrup equally over the surface, and border the dish with Italian macaroons, or, in lieu of these, with candied citron, sliced very thin, and cut into leaves with a small paste-cutter. A little lemon- juice brings out the flavour of all preparations of peaches, and may be added with good effect to this. When the fruit is scarce, the marmalade (which ought to be very white), may be made in part, or entirely with nonsuches. The better to preserve their form, the peaches are sometimes merely wiped, and then boiled tolerably tender in the syrup before they are pared or split. Half a pint of water, and from four to six ounces of sugar must then be allowed for them. IfMODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XX. 548 any of those used for the marmalade should not be quite ripe, it will be better to pass it through a sieve, when partially done, to prevent its being lumpy.

Peaches, if boiled whole in syrup, 15 to 18 minutes. Obs.—The number of peaches can, at pleasure, be increased to six, and three or four of the halves can he piled above the others in the centre of the dish. AROCE DOCE (OR SWEET RICE. A LA PORTUGAISE). Wipe thoroughly, in a dry soft cloth, half a pound of the best Carolina rice, after it has been carefully picked; put to it three pints of new milk, and when it has stewed gently for half an hour, add eight ounces of sugar, broken into small lumps; let it boil till it is dry and tender, and when it is nearly so, stir to it two ounces of blanched and pounded almonds. Turn the rice, when done, into shallow dishes, or soup-plates, and shake it until the surface is smooth; then sift over it, rather thickly, through a muslin, some freshly pow- dered cinnamon, which will give it the appearance of a baked pudding. Serve it cold. It will remain good for several days. This is quite the best sweet preparation of rice that we have ever eaten, and it is a very favourite dish in Portugal, whence the receipt was derived. One or two bitter almonds, pounded with the sweet ones, might a little improve its flavour, and a few spoonsful of rich cream could occasionally be substituted for a small portion of the milk, hut it should not be added until the preparation is three parts done. Pice, 8 ozs.; milk, 3 pints : 30 minutes. Sugar, 8 ozs. : 1 hour, or more. Pounded almonds, 2 ozs.; cinnamon, 1 teaspoonful. Obs.—The rice must be frequently stirred while boiling, particularly after it begins to thichen; and it549 CHAP. XX.] SWEET DISHES. will be better not to add the entire quantity of milk at first, as from a quarter to half a pint less will some- times prove sufficient. The grain should be thoroughly tender, but dry and unbroken. BUTTERED CHERRIES. (CERISES AU BEURRE.) Cut four ounces of the crumb of a stale loaf into dice, and fry them a light brown in an ounce and a half of fresh butter; take them up, pour the butter from the pan, and put in another ounce and a half; to this add a pound of Kentish cherries without their stalks, and when they are quite warmed through, strew in amongst them four ounces of sugar, and keep the whole well turned over a moderate fire; pour in gradually half a pint of hot water, and in fifteen minutes the cherries will be tender. Lay the fried bread into a hot dish, pour the cherries on it, and serve them directly. Bread, 4 ozs. ; butter, 1 \ oz. Cherries, 1 lb.; butter, lj oz. : 10 minutes. Sugar, 4 ozs.; water, \ pint: 15 minutes. Ohs.—Black-heart cherries may be used for this dish instead of Kentish ones : it is an improvement to stone the fruit. We think our readers generally, would pre- fer to the above Morelia cherries stewed from five to seven minutes, in syrup (made by boiling five ounces of sugar, in half a pint of w^ater for a quarter of an hour), and poured hot on the fried bread. Two pounds of the fruit, when it is stoned, will be required for a full-sized dish. SWEET MACCARONI. Drop gently into a pint and a half of new milk, when it is boiling fast, four ounces of fine pipe macca- roni, add a grain or two of salt, and some thin strips of lemon or orange-rind : cinnamon can be substituted for these when preferred. Simmer the maccaroni by a gentle fire until it is tolerably tender, then add from two to three ounces of sugar broken small, and boil it till the pipes are soft, and swollen to their full size; drain,550 [CHAP. XX. MODERN COOKERY. and arrange it in a hot dish ; stir the milk quickly to the well-beaten yolks of three large, or of four small eggs, shake them round briskly over the fire till they thicken, pour them over the maccaroni and serve it immediately; or instead of the eggs, heat and sweeten some very rich cream, pour it on the drained maccaroni, and dust finely powdered cinnamon over through a muslin, or strew it thickly with crushed macaroons. For variety, cover it with the German sauce, of page 151, milled to a light froth. New milk, 1J pint; pipe maccaroni, 4 ozs.; strips of lemon-rind or cinnamon ; sugar, 2 to 3 ozs.: f to 1 hour or more. BERMUDA WITCHES. Slice equally some rice, pound, or Savoy cake, not more than the sixth of an inch thick; take off the brown edges, and spread one half of it with Guava jelly, or, if more convenient, with fine strawberry, rasp- berry, or currant jelly of the best quality (see Norman receipt); on this strew thickly some fresh cocoa nut grated small, and lightly; press over it the remainder of the cake and trim the whole into good form ; divide the slices if large, pile them slopingly in the centre of a dish upon a very white napkin folded flat, and garnish or intersperse them with small sprigs of myrtle. For very young people a French roll or two, and good currant jelly, red or white, will supply a wholesome and inexpensive dish. NESSELRODE PUDDING. We give Monsieur Careme’s own receipt for this favourite and fashionable dish, not having ourselves good opportunity of proving it; but as it originated with him he is the best authority for it. It may be varied in many ways, which the taste or ingenuity of the reader will easily suggest. Boil forty fine sound Span- ish chestnuts quite tender in plenty of water, take off the husks, and pound the chestnuts perfectly with a few551 SWEET DISHES. CHAP. XX.] spoonsful of syrup; rub them through a fine sieve, and mix them in a basin with a pint of syrup (made with a pound of sugar clarified and highly-flavoured with a pod of vanilla), a pint of rich cream, and the yolks of twelve eggs; thicken the mixture like a boiled custard ; when it is cold put it into a freezing pot, adding a glass of maraschino, and make it set as an iced cream; then add an ounce of preserved citron cut in dice, two ounces of currants, and as many fine raisins stoned and divided (all of which should be soaked from the day before in some maraschino with a little sugar); the whole thus mingled, add a plateful of whipped cream, and the whites of three eggs prepared as for Italian meringue. When the pudding is perfectly frozen, mould it in a pewter mould of the form of a pine-apple, and place it again in the ice till wanted to serve. Preserved cherries may be substituted for the raisins and currants. Chestnuts, 40 ; syrup, 1 pint some spoonsful; vanilla, 1 pod ; cream 1 pint; yolks of eggs, 12 ; maraschino, 1 glass; citron, 1 oz.; currants, 2 ozs.; raisins, 2 ozs.; whipped cream, 1 plateful; whites of eggs beaten to snow, 3. Obs.—As Monsieur Careme directs the eggs for his Italian meringues to be prepared as follows, he probably intends that they should be mixed with the syrup before they are added to the pudding. Boil together half a pound of the finest sugar, and half a pint of water, until they begin to be very thick, then with a wooden spoon, work the sugar against the side of the pan till it whitens; leave it to cool a little, work it again, and then with a whisk mingle with it the eggs whipped to very firm froth, which ought to produce a preparation very white, smooth, and brilliant.

Fruit for preserving should always be gathered in perfectly dry weather ; it should also be free both from the morning and evening dew, and as much so as possi-CHAP.

When bottled, it must be steamed or baked during the day on which it is gathered, or there will be great loss from the bursting of the bottles ; and for jams and jellies it cannot be too soon boiled down after it is taken from the trees. The small portable French stove, or furnace,* shown above, with the t re vet and stewpan adapted to it, is exceedingly convenient for all pre- parations which require either more than usual attention, or a fire en- tirely free from smoke; as it can be placed on a table in a clear light, and the heat can be regulated at pleasure. It has been used for all the preserves, of which the receipts are given in this Chapter, as well as for various dishes contained in the body of the work. There should always be a free current of air in the room in which it stands when lighted, as charcoal or braise (that is to say, the live em- bers of large well burned wood, drawn from an oven, and shut imme- diately into a closely- stopped iron or copper l vessel to extinguish them, is the only fuel suited to it. To kindle either i of these, two or three Grating, and Form of Trevet. bits must be lighted in a common fire, and laid on * Called in France, TJn Fourneau Economique.

To extinguish the fire alto- gether, the cover must be pressed closely on, and the door be quite shut: the embers which remain will serve to rekindle it easily, but before it is again lighted the grating must be lifted out and all the ashes cleared away. It should be set by in a place which is not damp. The German enamelled stewpans, now coming into Copper Preserving Pan. acids ; and red fruits, when boiled in them, retain the brightness of their colour as well as if copper or bell-metal were used for them. The form of the old-fashioned preserving pan, made usually of one or the other of these, is shown above; but it has not, we should say, even the advantage of being of con- venient shape; for the handles quickly become heated, and the pan, in consequence, cannot always be instan- taneously raised from the fire when the contents threaten to over-boil, or to burn. It is desirable to have three or four wooden spoons or spatulas, one fine hair-sieve, at the least, one or two large squares of common muslin, and a strainer, or more, of closer texture, kept exclusively for preparations of fruit, for if used for other purposes, there is the hazard, without great care, of their retaining some strong or coarse flavour, which they would impart to the preserves. A sieve, for example, through which general use, are, from the peculiar nicety of the com- position with which they are lined, better adapted than any others to pickling and preserving, as they may be used without danger forCHAP. XXI.] 555 PRESERVES. any preparation of onions has been poured, should never, on any account, be brought into use for any kind of confectionary, nor in making sweet dishes, nor for straining eggs or milk for puddings, cakes, or bread. Damp is the great enemy, not only of preserves and pickles, but of numberless other household stores ; yet, in many situations, it is extremely difficult to exclude it. To keep them in a “dry cool place' (words which occur so frequently both in this book, and in most others on the same subject), is more easily directed than done. They remain, we find, more entirely free from any danger of moulding, when covered with a brandied paper only, and placed on the shelves of a tolerably dry store-room; but they are rather liable to candy when thus kept, and we fancy that the flavour of the fruit is somewhat less perfectly preserved than when they are quite secured from the air by skins stretched over the jars. If left uncovered, the inroads of mice upon them must be guarded against, as they will commit great havoc in a single night on these sweet stores. When the slightest fermentation is perceptible in syrup, it should imme- diately be boiled for some minutes, and well skimmed ; the fruit taken from it should then be thrown in, and well scalded also, and the whole, when done, should be turned into a very dean dry jar : this kind of preserve should always be covered with one or two skins, or with parchment and thick paper. A FEW GENERAL RULES AND DIRECTIONS FOR PRESERVING. 1. Let everything used for the purpose be deli- cately clean, and dry ; bottles especially so. 2. Never place a preserving pan flat upon the fire, as this will render the preserve liable to burn to, as it is called ; that is to say, to adhere closely to the metal, and then to burn; it should rest always on a trevet (that shown with the French furnace is very convenient, even for a common grate), or on the lowered bar of the kitchen range.MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XXI. 556 3. After the sugar is added to them, stir the pre- serves gently at first, and more quickly towards the end, without quitting them until they are done; this precaution will always prevent the chance of their being spoiled. 4. All preserves should be perfectly cleared from the scum as it rises. 5. Fruit which is to he preserved in syrup must first be blanched or boiled gently, till it is sufficiently softened to absorb the sugar; and a thin syrup must be poured on it at first, or it will shrivel instead of remaining plump, and becoming clear. Thus, if its weight of sugar is to be allowed, and boiled to a syrup with a pint of water to the pound, only half the weight must be taken at first, and this must not be boiled with the water more than fifteen or twenty minutes at the com- mencement of the process; a part of the remaining sugar must be added every time the syrup is reboiled, unless it should be otherwise directed in the receipt. 6. To preserve both the true flavour and the colour of fruit in jams and jellies, boil them rapidly until well reduced, before the sugar is added, and quickly after- wards, but do not allow them to become so much thickened that the sugar will not dissolve in them easily, and throw up its scum. In some seasons, the juice is so much richer than in others, that this effect takes place almost before one is aware of it; but the drop which adheres to the skimmer, when it is held up, will show the state it has reached. 7. Never *use tin, iron, or pewter spoons, or skim- mers for preserves, as they will convert the colour of red fruit into a dingy purple, and impart, besides, a very unpleasant flavour. 8. When cheap jams or jellies are required, make them at once with Lisbon sugar, but use that which is well refined always, for preserves in general; it is a false economy, as we have elsewhere observed, to purchase an inferior kind, as there is great waste from557 CHAP. XXI.] PRESERVES. it in the quantity of scum which it throws ^up. The best has been used for all the receipts given here. TO EXTRACT THE JUICE OF PLUMS FOR JELLY. Take the stalks from the fruit, and throw aside all that is not perfectly sound, put it into very clean, large stone jars, and give part of the harder kinds, such as bullaces and damsons, a gash with a knife as they are thrown in; do this especially in filling the upper part of the jars. Tie one or two folds of thick paper over them, and set them for the night into an oven from which the bread has been drawn four or five hours; or cover them with bladder, instead of paper, place them in deep pans of water, and boil them gently from two to three hours, or until the fruit is quite soft, and has yielded all the juice it will afford : this last is the safer and better mode for jellies of delicate colour.

Put a basin into one scale, and its weight into the other; add to this last the weight which is required of the juice, and pour into the basin as much as will balance the scales. It is always better to weigh than to measure the juice for preserving, as it can generally be done with more exactness. GREEN GOOSEBERRY JELLY. Wash some freshly gathered gooseberries very clean, after having taken off the tops and stalks, then to each pound, pour three quarters of a pint of spring water and simmer them until they are well broken; turn the whole into a jelly-bag or cloth, and let all the juice drain through; weigh, and boil it rapidly for fifteen minutes. Draw it from the fire, and stir into it until entirely dissolved an equal weight of good sugar reduced to powder; boil the jelly from fifteen to twenty minutes longer, or until it jellies strongly on the spoon or skimmer; clear it perfectly from scum, and pour it into small jars, moulds, or glasses.

Preserved fruits just dipped into hot water to take off the syrup, then well drained and dried, may be arranged with good effect in the centre of the gooseberry jelly if the glasses be rather less than half filled before they are laid in, and the jelly just set: the remainder must be kept liquid to fill them up. The sugar may be added to the juice at first, and the preserve boiled from twenty-five to thirty-five minutes, but the colour will not then be so good. When the fruit abounds the juice may be drawn from it with very little water, as directed for apples, page 586, when it will require much less boiling. Gooseberries, 6 lbs. ; water, 4 pints: 20 to SO minutes. Juice boiled quickly, 15 minutes; to each pound, 1 lb. sugar : 15 to 20 minutes. GREEN GOOSEBERRY JAM. (Firm and of good colour.') Cut the stalks and tops from the fruit, weigh and bruise it slightly, boil it for six or seven minutes, keep- ing it well turned during the time; then to every three pounds of gooseberries add two and a half of sugar beaten to powder, and boil the preserve quickly for three-quarters of an hour. It must be constantly stirred, and carefully cleared from scum. Green gooseberries, 6 lbs. : 6 to 7 minutes. Sugar, 5 lbs. : j hour. TO DRY GREEN GOOSEBERRIES. Take the finest green gooseberries, fully grown, and freshly gathered ; cut off the buds, split them across the tops half way down, and with the small end of a tea or of an egg spoon, scoop out seeds. Boil together for fifteen minutes a pound and a half of the finest sugar, and a pint of water; skim this syrup thoroughly and throw into it a pound of the seeded gooseberries; simmer them from five to seven minutes, when they ought to be clear and tender; when they are so, lift them out, and throw as many more into the syrup;CHAP. XXI.] PRESERVES. 559 drain them a little when done, spread them singly on dishes, and dry them very gradually in a quite cool stove or oven, or in a sunny window. They will keep well in the syrup, and may be potted in it, and dried when wanted for use. Green gooseberries without the seeds, 2 lbs.; water, 1 pint; sugar, 1| lb.: boiled 15 minutes. Gooseber- ries simmered, 5 to 7 minutes. GREEN GOOSEBERRIES FOR TARTS. Fill very clean, dry, wide-necked bottles with goose- berries gathered the same day, and before they have attained their full growth. Cork them lightly, wrap a little hay round each of them, and set them up to their necks in a copper of cold water which should be brought very gradually to boil. Let the fruit be gently sim- mered until it appears shrunken and perfectly scalded ; then take out the bottles, and with the contents of one or two fill the remainder, and use great care not to break the fruit in doing this. When all are ready pour scald- ing water into-the bottles and cover the gooseberries entirely with it, or they will become mouldy at the top. Cork the bottles well immediately, and cover the necks , with melted rosin ; keep them in a cool place; and when they are used pour off the greater part of the water, and add sugar as for the fresh fruit, of which they will have quite the flavour and appearance ; and they will be found much more wholesome prepared in this manner than if simply baked or steamed in the bottles. GREEN GOOSEBERRY SOLID. Bruise well, and boil six pounds of fresh green goose- berries for an hour and a quarter without sugar, and for half an hour after having stirred to them a couple of pounds of good quality, reduced quite to powder. Press the preserve into shallow pans or small shapes, and unmould it for table. Green gooseberries, 6 lbs. ; hour. Sugar, 2 lbs. : \ hour.[CHAP. XXI. MODERN COOKERY. 560 RED GOOSEBERRY JAM. The small rough red gooseberry, when fully ripe, is the best for this preserve, which may, however, be made of the larger kinds. When the buds and stalks have been taken carefully from the fruit, weigh, and boil it quickly for three quarters of an hour, keeping it well stirred ; then for six pounds of the gooseberries add two and a half of good roughly-powdered sugar (or three of fine Lisbon, if only a common preserve be wanted); boil these together briskly, from twenty to twenty-five minutes, and stir the jam well from the bottom of the pan, as it is liable to burn if this be neglected. Small red gooseberries, 6 lbs.: j hour. Pounded sugar, 2J lbs (for common jam Lisbon sugar 3 lbs.) : 20 to 25 minutes. VERY FINE GOOSEBERRY JAM. Seed the fruit, which for this jam may be of the larger kind of rough red gooseberry : those which are smooth-skinned are generally of far inferior flavour. Add the pulp which has been scooped from the pre- pared fruit to some whole gooseberries, and stir them over a moderate fire for some minutes to extract the juice; strain and weigh this ; pour two pounds of it to four of the seeded gooseberries, boil them rather gently for twenty-five minutes, add fourteen ounces of good pounded sugar to each pound of fruit and juice, and when it is dissolved boil the preserve from twelve to fifteen minutes longer, and skim it well during the time. Seeded gooseberries, 4 lbs.; juice of gooseberries, 2 pounds: 25 minutes. Sugar, 5J lbs. (or 14 ozs. to each pound fruit and juice) : 12 to 15 minutes. JELLY OF RIPE GOOSEBERRIES. (Excellent.) Take the tops and stalks from a gallon or more of any kind of well-flavoured ripe red gooseberries, andPRESERVES. CHAP. XXI.] 561 keep them stirred gently over a clear fire until they have yielded all their juice, which should then be poured off without pressing the fruit and passed through a fine sieve, and afterwards through a double muslin- strainer, or a jelly hag. Next weigh it, and to every three pounds add one of wkite currant juice, which has previously been prepared in the same way ; boil these quickly for a quarter of an hour, then draw them from the fire and stir to them half their weight of good sugar; when this is dissolved boil the jelly for six minutes longer, skim it thoroughly, and pour it into jars or moulds. If a very large quantity be made, a few minutes of additional boiling must be given to it before the sugar is added. Juice of red gooseberries, 3 lbs. ; juice of white cur- rants, 1 lb. : 15 minutes. Sugar, 2 lbs. : 6 minutes. Obs.—The same proportion of red-currant juice, mixed with that of the gooseberries makes an exceed- ingly nice jelly. UNMIXED GOOSEBERRY JELLY. Boil rapidly for ten minutes four pounds of the juice of red gooseberries, prepared as in the preceding re- ceipt ; take it from the fire, and stir in it till dissolved three pounds of sugar beaten to powder ; boil it again for five minutes, keeping it constantly stirred and thoroughly skimmed. Juice of red gooseberries, 4 lbs. : 10 minutes. Sugar, 3 lbs.: 5 minutes. GOOSEBERRY PASTE. Press through a sieve the gooseberries from which the juice has been taken for jelly, without having been drained very closely from them ; weigh and then boil the pulp for upwards of an hour and a quarter, or until it forms a dry paste in the pan ; stir to it, off the fire, six ounces of good pounded sugar for each pound of the fruit; and when this is nearly dissolved boil the pre- serve from twenty to twenty-five minutes, keeping it o oMODERN COOKERY. ^CHAP.

Pulp of gooseberries, 4 lbs.; lj to 1 j hour. Sugar, lj lb. : 20 to 25 minutes. TO DRY RIPE GOOSEBERRIES WITH SUGAR. Cut the tops but not the stalks from some ripe gooseberries of the largest size, either red or green ones, and after having taken out the seeds, as directed for unripe gooseberries, boil the fruit till clear and tender in syrup made with a pound of sugar to the pint of water boiled till rather thick. Seeded gooseberries, 2 lbs.; sugar, 1^ lb.; water, 1 pint: boiled to syrup. Gooseberries simmered : 8 to 12 minutes or more. Ohs.—Large ripe gooseberries stripped of their buds, and put into cold syrup in which cherries or any other fruit has been boiled for drying, then heated very gra- dually, and kept at the point of boiling for a few minutes before they are set by for a couple of days, answer extremely well as a dry preserve. On the third day the syrup should be drained from them, sim- mered, skimmed, and poured on them the instant it is taken from the fire; in forty-eight hours after, they may be drained from it and laid singly upon plates or dishes, and placed in a gentle stove or oven. GOOSEBERRIES DRIED WITHOUT SUGAR. Choose them fine and ripe, spread them separately on large dishes, and dry them very gradually by the heat of a gentle oven, or in the sun where they will be well- protected from dust. If flattened with the finger when partially done, they will preserve a better form, and be more quickly dried. CHERRY JAM. First stone and then weigh some freshly gathered Kentish or Flemish cherries; boil them over a brisk fireCHAP. XXI.] PRESERVES. 563 for an hour, keeping them almost constantly stirred from the bottom of the pan, to which they will otherwise be liable to stick and burn. Add half a pound of good sugar roughly powdered for each pound of the fruit, and boil the preserve quickly for twenty minutes, taking off the scum as it rises. The blanched kernels of part of the cherries may be added to the jam five minutes before it is taken from the fire. We can recommend this receipt as producing a firm preserve of fine colour and flavour, and very far superior to any that can be made by the more common method of boiling the fruit and sugar together from the beginning. Stoned cherries, 6 lbs.: 1 hour. Sugar, 3 lbs.: 20 minutes. Ohs.—Increase the proportion of sugar, when it is liked, to twelve or sixteen ounces, and diminish the boiling a quarter-hour before it is added, and ten minutes after. We have found almost invariably, that preserves made by the receipts we have given have been preferred to richer ones. TO DRY CHERRIES WITH SUGAR. (A quick and easy method.') Stone some fine, sound, Kentish or Flemish cherries, weigh and put them into a preserving pan, with six ounces of sugar reduced to powder to each pound of the fruit; set them over a moderate fire, and simmer them gently for nearly or quite twenty minutes, let them remain in the syrup till they are a little cooled, then turn them into a sieve, and before they are cold lay them singly on dishes, and dry them very gradually* as directed for other fruits. When the cherries are quite ripe the stones may generally be drawn out with the stalks, by pressing the fruit gently at the same time ; but when this method fails, they must be extracted with a new quill, cut round at the end; those of the very short-stalked, turnip-shaped cherry, which abounds, and is remarkably fine in many parts of Normandy, andMODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XXI. 564 which we have occasionally met with here, though it is not, we believe, very abundant in our markets, are easily removed with a large pin, on the point of which the stone may be caught at the stalk end, just opposite the seam of the fruit, and drawn out at the top, leaving the cherry apparently entire. DRIED CHERRIES. [Superior Receipt.') To each pound of cherries, weighed after they are stoned, add eight ounces of good sugar, and boil them very softly for ten minutes; pour them into a large bowl, or pan, and leave them two days in the syrup; then simmer them again for ten minutes, and set them by for two or three days; drain them slightly, and dry them very slowly, as directed in the previous receipts. Keep them in tin cases, or canisters, when done. These cherries are generally preferred to such as are dried with a larger proportion of sugar; but when the taste is in favour of the latter, three-quarters, or a full pound can be allowed to the pound of fruit, which may then be potted in the syrup and dried at any time, though we think the flavour of the cherries is better preserved when this is done within a fortnight of their being boiled. Cherries, stoned, 8 lbs.; sugar, 4 lbs.: 10 minutes. Left 2 or 3 days. Boiled again, 10 minutes ; left 2 days; drained and dried. CHERRIES DRIED WITHOUT SUGAR. These are often more pleasant and refreshing to inva- lids and travellers than a sweetened confection of the fruit, their flavour and agreeable acidity being well pre- served when they are simply spread on dishes or hamper- lids, and slowly dried. Throw aside the bruised and decayed fruit, and arrange the remainder singly, and with the stalks uppermost on the dishes. The Kentish cherries are best for the purpose, but Morellas also answer for it excellently. The former are sometimes * The dishes on which they are laid should be changed daily.PRESERVES. CHAP. XXI.] 565 stoned, and simmered till quite tender in their own juice, before they are dried; but this is scarcely an improve- ment on the more usual method of leaving them entire.* MORELLA CHERRIES. Take off the stalks but do not stone the fruit; weigh and add to it an equal quantity of the best sugar reduced quite to powder, strew it over the cherries and let them stand for half an hour, then turn them gently into a pre- serving-pan, and simmer them softly from five to seven minutes. COMMON CHERRY CHEESE. Stone the fruit, or if this trouble be objected to bruise and boil it without, until it is sufficiently tender to press through a sieve, which will be in from twenty to thirty minutes. Weigh the pulp in this case, and boil it quickly to a dry paste, then stir to it six ounces of sugar for the pound of fruit, and when this is dissolved, place the pan again over, but not upon, a brisk fire, and stir the preserve without ceasing, until it is so dry as not to adhere to the finger when touched ; then press it immediately into small moulds or pans, and turn it from them when wanted for table. When the cherries have been stoned, a good common preserve may be made of them without passing them through a sieve, with the addition of five ounces of sugar to the pound of fruit, which must be boiled very dry both before and after it is added. Kentish or Flemish cherries without stoning, 20 to 30 minutes. Passed through a sieve. To each pound of pulp (first boiled dry), 6 ozs. sugar. To each pound of cherries stoned and boiled to dry paste, 5 ozs. sugar. CHERRY PASTE. (FRENCH.) Stone vthe cherries, boil them gently in their own juice for thirty minutes; press the whole through a sieve; reduce it to a very dry paste; then take it from the fire, and weigh it; boil an equal quantity of sugar566 [CHAP.

MODERN COOKERY. to the candying point, mix the fruit with it, and stir the paste, without intermission, over a moderate fire, until it is again so dry as to form a ball round the spoon, and to quit the preserving-pan entirely; press it quickly into small moulds, and when it is cold, paper, and store it like other preserves. STRAWBERRY JAM. Strip the stalks from some fine scarlet strawberries, weigh, and boil them for thirty-five minutes, keeping them very constantly stirred; throw in eight ounces of good sugar, beaten small, to the pound of fruit, mix them well off the fire, then boil the preserve again quickly for twenty-five minutes. One pound of white currant juice added in the first instance to four of the strawberries, will greatly improve this preserve, which will be quite firm, and sufficiently, but not over sweet. Strawberries, 6 lbs. : 35 minutes. Sugar, 3 lbs.: 25 minutes. Or: strawberries, 4> lbs.; currant-juice, 1 lb. : 30 to 35 minutes. Sugar, 2J lbs.: 25 minutes. Obs.—We do not think it needful to give directions with each separate receipt for skimming the preserve with care, and keeping it constantly stirred, but neither should in any case be neglected. STRAWBERRY JELLY. This, when made with fine, full-flavoured scarlet strawberries, is a very delicious preserve, and is by many persons preferred to guava jelly, which it greatly resembles. Stalk the fruit, bruise it very slightly, and stir it for a few minutes over a gentle fire; strain it without pressure, weigh, and boil it quickly for twenty minutes in a German enamelled stewpan, or preserving- pan, if possible, that the colour may not be injured; take it from the fire, and stir into it twelve ounces of sugar to the pound of juice; when this is dissolved, boil it again quickly for twenty minutes, clear it per- fectly from scum, and pour it into jars or glasses. The567 CHAP. XXI.] PRESERVES. preserve will be firmer, and require less boiling, if one- fourth of red or white currant juice be mixed with that of the strawberries, but the flavour will not then be quite so perfect. A superior jelly to this is made by taking an equal weight of juice and sugar, and by boiling the latter to candy-height, before the juice (which should previously be boiled five minutes) is added to it; and when they have been stirred together off the fire until this is entirely dissolved, boiling the whole quickly from ten to twenty minutes; the time required varying very much from the difference which is found in the quality of the fruit. Fruit simmered, 4 to 5 minutes. Juice of straw- berries, 4 lbs. : 20 minutes. Sugar, 3 lbs. : 20 minutes. Or : juice of strawberries, 4 lbs. : 5 minutes. Sugar, boiled to candy-height, 4 lbs.: 10 to 20 minutes. ANOTHER VERY FINE STRAWBERRY JELLY. Express the juice from the fruit through a cloth, strain it clear, weigh, and stir to it an equal proportion of the finest sugar, dried and reduced to powder; when tiiis is dissolved, place the preserving-pan over a very clear fire, and stir the jelly often until it boils; clear it carefully from scum, and boil it quickly from fifteen to twenty-five minutes. Equal weight of strawberry-juice and sugar : 15 to 25 minutes. Obs.—This receipt is for a moderate quantity of the preserve : a very small portion will require much less time. TO PRESERVE STRAWBERRIES OR RASPBERRIES, FOR CREAMS OR ICES, WITHOUT BOILING. Let the fruit be gathered in the middle of a warm day, in very dry weather; strip it from the stalks directly, weigh it, turn it into a bowl or deep pan, and bruise it gently ; mix with it an equal weight of fine dry sifted sugar, and put it immediately into small, wide-neckedMODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XXI. 568 bottles, cork these firmly without delay, and tie blad- der over the tops. Keep them in a cool place, or the fruit will ferment. The mixture should be stirred softly, and only just sufficiently to blend the sugar and the fruit. The bottles must be perfectly dry, and the bladders, after being cleaned in the usual way, and allowed to become nearly so, should be moistened with a little spirit on the side that is to be next to the cork. Unless these precautions be observed, there will be some danger of the whole being spoiled. Equal weight of fruit and sugar. RASPBERRY JAM. Bruise gently, with the back of a wooden spoon, six pounds of ripe and freshly-gathered raspberries, and boil them over a brisk fire for twenty-five minutes; stir to them half their weight of good sugar, roughly powdered, and when it is dissolved boil the preserve quickly for ten minutes, keeping it well-stirred and skimmed. When a richer jam is wished for, add to the fruit at first its full weight of sugar, and boil them together twenty minutes. Raspberries, 6 lbs. : 25 minutes. Sugar, 3 lbs.: 10 minutes. GOOD RED OR WHITE RASPBERRY JAM. Boil quickly, for twenty minutes, four pounds of either red or white sound ripe raspberries in a pound and a half of currant juice of the same colour; take the pan from the fire, stir in three pounds of sugar, and when it is dissolved, place the pan again over the fire, and continue the boiling for ten minutes longer: keep the preserve well-skimmed and stirred from the begin- ning. Raspberries, 4'lbs.; currant juice, lb.: 20 mi- nutes. Sugar, 3 lbs.: 10 minutes. RASPBERRY JELLY FOR FLAVOURING CREAMS. Take the stalks from some quite ripe, and freshly-CHAP.

The jelly thus made will sufficiently sweeten the creams without any additional sugar. Juice of raspberries, 4 lbs.: 5 minutes. Sugar, made hot, 5 lbs. : 5 minutes. ANOTHER RASPBERRY JELLY. ' ( Very good.) Bruise the fruit a little, and draw the juice from it by four or five minutes’ gentle simmering, strain and weigh it, boil it quickly for twenty minutes, draw it from the fire, add three-quarters of a pound of good sugar for each pound of juice, and when this is dissolved place the pan again on the fire, and boil the preserve fast from twelve to fifteen minutes longer ; skim it thoroughly, and keep it well stirred. This jelly is infinitely improved* by mixing with the raspberry-juice one-fourth, or even as much as a third of the juice of ripe white currants: the preserve will then require rather less boiling. When it jellies in falling from the spoon or skimmer, it is done. Nothing of tin or iron should be used in making it, as these metals will convert its fine red colour into a dingy purple. Fruit, simmered 5 to 6 minutes. Juice of rasp- berries. 4 lbs.: 20 minutes. Sugar, 3 lbs.: 12 to 15 minutes Or: juice of raspberries, 4 lbs.; juice of white currants, 2 lbs. : 20 minutes. Sugar, 41 lbs.: 10 minutes, or less. GREEN CURRANT JAM. For each pound of currants take fourteen ounces of * In colour and firmness, not in flavour.MODERN COOKERY. ^CHAP. XXI. 570 good sugar, in fine powder; bruise part of the fruit with a small portion of the sugar, and put it first into the preserving pan, that the juice may flow from it sufficiently to prevent the remainder from being burned ; it should be placed over a very gentle fire and stirred constantly until it has yielded moisture enough for this. All the fruit and sugar may then be added, and the whole (well mixed and stirred) boiled from ten to fifteen minutes, or until it jellies strongly in falling from the skimmer. Some fruit will require less time, and some rather more. To each pound of currants, stripped from stalks, 14 ozs. of sugar : 10 to 15 minutes. RED CURRANT JELLY. With three parts of fine ripe red currants freshly gathered, and stripped from the stalks, mix one of white currants; put them into a clean preserving pan, and stir them gently over a clear fire until the juice flows from them freely; then turn them into a fine hair-sieve, and let them drain well, but without pressure. Pass the juice through a folded muslin, or a jelly-bag ; weigh it, and then boil it fast for a quarter of an hour ; add for each pound eight ounces of sugar coarsely powdered, stir this to it off the fire until it is dissolved, give the jelly eight minutes more of quick boiling, and pour it out. It will be firm, and of excellent colour and flavour. Be sure to clear off the scum as it rises both before and after the sugar is put in, or the preserve will not be clear. Juice of red currants, 3 lbs.; juice of white currants, 1 lb.: 15 minutes. Sugar, 2 lbs. : 8 minutes. Obs.—An excellent jelly may be made with equal parts of the juice of red and of white currants, and of raspberries, with the same proportion of sugar and degree of boiling as in the foregoing receipt. SUPERLATIVE RED CURRANT JELLY. (Norman Receipt.) Strip carefully from the stems some quite-ripe cur-PRESERVES. CHAP. XXI.] 571 rants of the finest quality, and mix with them an equal weight of good sugar reduced to powder ; boil these toge- ther quickly for exactly eight minutes, keep them stirred all the time, and clear off the scum as it rises; then turn the preserve into a very clean sieve, and put into small jars the jelly which runs through it, and which will be delicious in flavour, and of the brightest colour. It should be carried immediately, when this is practicable, to an extremely cool but not a damp place, and left there till perfectly cold. The currants which remain in the sieve make an excellent jam, particularly if only part of the jelly be taken from them. In Normandy, where the fruit is of richer quality than in England, this preserve is boiled only one minute, and is both firm and beautifully transparent. Currants, 3 lbs.; sugar, 3 lbs.: 8 minutes. FRENCH CURRANT JELLY. Mix one-third of white currants with two of red, and stir them over a gentle fire till they render their juice freely, pour it from them, strain and weigh it; for every four pounds break three of fine sugar into large lumps, just dip them into cold water, and when they are nearly dissolved boil them to a thick syrup ; stir this without ceasing till it falls in large thick white masses from the skimmer: then pour in the currant juice immediately, and when the sugar is again dis- solved, boil the whole quickly for five minutes, clear off the scum perfectly, pour the jelly into jars or warm glasses, and set it in a cool place. Red currants, two thirds ; white currants, one-third; juice, 4 lbs.; sugar boiled to candy height, 3 lbs.; jelly boiled : 5 minutes. Obs.—A flavouring of raspberries is usually given to currant jelly in France, the preserve being there never served with any kind of joint, as it is with ns. DELICIOUS RED CURRANT JAM. A' This, which is but an indifferent preserve when made[CHAP. XXI. MODERN COOKERY. 572 in the usual way, will be found a very fine one if the following directions for it be observed; it will be ex- tremely transparent and bright in colour, and will retain perfectly the flavour of the fruit. Take the currants at the height of their season, the finest that can be had, free from dust, but gathered on a dry day ; strip them with great care from the stalks, weigh and put them into a preserving pan with three pounds of the best sugar reduced to powder to four pounds of the fruit; stir them gently over a brisk clear fire, and boil them quickly for exactly eight minutes from the first full boil. As the jam is apt to rise over the top of the pan, it is better not to fill it more than two-thirds, and if this precaution should not be sufficient to prevent it, it must be lifted from the fire and held away for an instant. To many tastes, a still finer jam than this (which we find sufficiently sweet) may be made with an equal weight of fruit and sugar boiled together for seven minutes. There should be great exactness with respect to the time, as both the flavour and the brilliant colour of the preserve will be injured by longer boiling. Red currants (without stalks), 4 lbs.; fine sugar, 3 lbs.: boiled fast, 8 minutes. Or, fruit and sugar equal weight: 7 minutes. VERY FINE WHITE CURRANT JELLY. The fruit for this jelly should be very white, per- fectly free from dust, and picked carefully from the stalks. To every pound add eighteen ounces of double- refined sifted sugar, and boil them together quickly for six minutes ; throw in the strained juice of a sound fresh lemon, or of two, should the quantity of preserve be large; boil it two minutes longer; pour it into a delicately clean sieve, and finish it by the directions given for the Norman red currant jelly. White currants, 6 lbs.; highly-refined sugar, 6 j lbs. : 6 minutes. Juice of 2 moderate-sized lemons: 2 minutes.PRESERVES. CHAP. XXI.] 573 WHITE CURRANT JAM, A BEAUTIFUL PRESERVE. Boil together quickly for seven minutes equal quan- tities of fine white currants, picked with the greatest nicety, and of the best sugar pounded and passed through a sieve. Stir the preserve gently the whole time, and be careful to skim it thoroughly. Just be- fore it is taken from the fire throw in the strained juice of one good lemon to four pounds of the fruit. White currants, 4 lbs.; best sugar, 4 lbs. : 7 minutes. Juice, 1 lemon. CURRANT PASTE. Stalk and heat some red currants as for jelly, pour off three parts of the juice, which can be used for that preserve, and press the remainder, with the pulp of the fruit, closely through a hair-sieve reversed; boil it briskly, keeping it stirred the whole time, until it forms a dry paste ; then for each pound (when first weighed) add seven ounces of pounded sugar, and boil the whole from twenty-five to thirty minutes longer, taking care that it shall not burn. This paste is re- markably pleasant and refreshing in cases of fever, and acceptable usually for winter-desserts. Red currants boiled from 5 to 7 minutes, pressed with one-fourth of their juice through a sieve, boiled from 1^- to 2 hours. To each pound add 7 ozs. pounded sugar : 25 to 30 minutes. Ohs.—Confectioners add the pulp, after it is boiled dry, to an equal weight of sugar at the candy height: by making trial of the two methods the reader can de- cide on the better one. NURSERY PRESERVE. Take the stones from a couple of pounds of Kentish cherries, and boil them twenty-minutes ; then add to them a pound and a half of raspberries, and an equal quantity of red and of white currants, all weighed after they have been cleared from their stems. Boil these[CHAP. XXI. 574 MODERN COOKERY. together briskly for twenty minutes; mix with them three pounds and a quarter of common sugar, and give the preserve fifteen minutes more of quick boiling. A pound and a half of gooseberries may be substituted for the cherries; but they will not require any stewing before they are added to the other fruits. The jam must be well stirred from the beginning, or it will burn to the pan. Kentish cherries, 2 lbs.: 20 minutes. Baspberries, red currants, and white currants, of each lT lb.: 20 minutes. Sugar, lbs.: 15 minutes. ANOTHER GOOD COMMON PRESERVE. Boil together, in equal or in unequal portions (for this is immaterial), any kinds of early fruit, till they can be pressed through a sieve; weigh, and then boil the pulp over a brisk fire for half an hour; add half a pound of sugar for each pound of fruit, and again boil the preserve quickly, keeping it well stirred and skimmed, from fifteen to twenty minutes. Cherries, unless they be morellas, must be first stewed tender apart, as they will require much longer time to make them so, than any other of the first summer fruits. A» GOOD MELANGE, OR MIXED PRESERVE. Boil for three quarters of an hour in two pounds of clear red gooseberry juice, one pound of very ripe green gages, weighed after they have been pared and stoned ; then stir to them one pound and a half of good sugar, and boil them quickly again for twenty minutes. If the quantity of preserve be much increased, the time of boiling it must be so likewise: this is always better done before the sugar is added.

This fruit, which is very insipid when ripe, makes an excellent preserve if used when at its full growth, but while it is still quite hard and green. Take off the stalks, weigh the plums, then gash them well (with a silver knife, if convenient) as they are thrown into the preserving pan, and keep them stirred without ceasing, over a moderate fire, until they have yielded sufficient juice to prevent their burning; after this, boil them quickly till the stones are entirely detached from the flesh of the fruit. Take them out as they appear on the surface, and when the preserve looks quite smooth and is well reduced, stir in three quarters of a pound of sugar beaten to powder, for each pound of the plums, and boil the whole very quickly for half an hour, or more. Put it, when done, into small moulds or pans, and it will be sufficiently firm when cold to turn out well: it will be also of a fine transparent green colour, and very agreeable to the taste. Orange plums, when green, 6 lbs.; 40 to 60 minutes: sugar, 4-1- lbs. : 30 to 50 minutes. Obs.—The blanched kernels of part of the fruit should be added to this preserve a few minutes before it is576 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XXI. poured out: if too long boiled in it they will become tough. They should always be wiped very dry after they are blanched. GREEN-GAGE JAM, OR MARMALADE. When the plums are thoroughly ripe, take off the skins, stone, weigh, and boil them quickly without sugar for fifty minutes, keeping them well stirred ; then to every four pounds add three of good sugar reduced quite to powder, boil the preserve from five to eight minutes longer, and clear off the scum perfectly before it is poured into the jars. When the flesh of the fruit will not separate easily from the stones, weigh and throw the plums whole into the preserving pan, boil them to a pulp, pass them through a sieve, and deduct the weight of the stones from them when apportioning the sugar to the jam. The Orleans plum may be sub- stituted for green-gages, in this receipt. Green-gages, stoned and skinned, 6 lbs.: 50 minutes. Sugar, 4 J lbs.; 5 to 8 minutes. PRESERVE OF THE MAGNUM BONUM, OR MOGUL PLUM. Prepare, weigh, and boil the plums for forty minutes; stir to them half their weight of good sugar beaten fine, and when it is dissolved continue the boiling for ten additional minutes, and skim the preserve carefully dur- ing the time. This is an excellent marmalade, but it may be rendered richer by increasing the proportion of sugar. The blanched kernels of a portion of the fruit- stones will much improve its flavour, but they should be mixed with it only two or three minutes before it is taken from the fire. When these plums are not entirely ripe, it is difficult to free them from the stones and skins: they should then be boiled down and pressed through a sieve, as directed for green-gages, in the receipt above. Mogul plums, skinned and stoned, 6 lbs.: 40 minutes. Sugar, 3 lbs.: 5 to 8 minutes.GHAP. XXI.] PRESERVES. 577 TO DRY OR PRESERVE MOGUL PLUMS IN SYRUP. Pare the plums, but do not remove the stalks nor stones; take their weight of dry sifted sugar, lay them into a deep dish or bowl, and strew it over them; let them remain thus for a night, then pour them gently into a preserving pan, with all the sugar, heat them slowly, and let them just simmer for five minutes; in a couple of days repeat the process, and do so again and again at an interval of two or three days, until the fruit is tender and very clear; put it then into jars, and keep it in the syrup, or drain and dry the plums very gradually, as directed for other fruit. When they are not sufficiently ripe for the skin to part from them easily, they must be covered with spring water, placed over a slow fire, and just scalded until it can be stripped off easily. MUSSEL PLUM CHEESE AND JELLY. Fill large stone jars with the fruit, which should be ripe, dry, and sound, set them into an oven from which the bread has been drawn several hours, and let them remain all night; or, if this cannot conveniently be done, place them in pans of water, and boil them gently until the plums are tender, and have yielded their juice to the utmost. Pour this from them, strain it through a jelly jbag, weigh, and then boil it quickly for twenty-five minutes. Have ready, broken small, three pounds of sugar for four of the juice, stir them together until it is dissolved, and then continue the boiling quickly for ten minutes longer, and be careful to remove all the scum. Pour the preserve into small moulds or pans, and turn it out when it is wanted for table : it will be very fine, both in colour and in flavour. Juice of plums, 4 lbs. : 25 minutes. Sugar, 3 lbs.: 10 minutes. The cheese.—Skin and stone the plums from which the juice has been poured, and after having weighed, boil them an hour and a quarter over a brisk fire, and stir them constantly; then, to three pounds of fruit p pMODERN COOKERY. 578 [CHAP. XXI. add one of sugar, beaten to powder; boil the preserve for another half hour, and press it into shallow pans or moulds. Plums, 3 lbs.: hour. Sugar, 1 lb. : 30 minutes. TO DRY APRICOTS. {A quick and easy method.') Wipe gently, split, and stone some fine apricots, which are not over-ripe; weigh, and arrange them evenly in a deep dish or bowl, and strew in fourteen ounces of sugar, in fine powder, to each pound of fruit; on the following day turn the whole carefully into a preserving- pan, let the apricots heat slowly, and simmer them very softly for six minutes, or for an instant longer, should they not in that time be quite tender. Let them lay in the syrup for a day or two, then drain and spread them singly on dishes to dry. To each lb. apricots, 14 ozs. of sugar: to stand one night, to be simmered from 6 to 8 minutes, and left in syrup 2 or 3 days. DRIED APRICOTS. (French Receipt.) Take apricots which have attained their full growth and colour, but before they begin to soften ; weigh, and wipe them lightly; make a small incision across the top of each plum, pass the point of a knife through the stalk- end, and gently push out the stones without breaking the fruit; next, put the apricots into a preserving-pan, with plenty of cold water, place it over a moderate fire, and when it begins to boil, should the apricots be quite tender, lift them out, and throw them into more cold water, but simmer them, otherwise, until they are so. Take the same weight of sugar that there was of the fruit before it was stoned, and boil it for ten minutes with a quart of water to the four pounds; skim the syrup carefully, throw in the apricots (which should previously be well drained on a soft cloth, or on a sieve), simmer them for one minute, and set them by in it until the following day, then drain it from them, boil it for ten minutes, and pour it on them the instant it is taken from the fire; in forty-eight hours repeat the process,PRESERVES. 579 CHAP. XXI.] and when the syrnp has boiled ten minutes, put in the apricots, and simmer them from two to four minutes, or until they look quite clear. They may be stored in the syrup until wanted for drying, or drained from it, laid separately on slates or dishes, and dried very gradually: the blanched kernels may be put inside the fruit, or added to the syrup. Apricots, 4 lbs., scalded till tender; sugar, 4 lbs.; water, 1 quart: 10 minutes. Apricots, in syrup, 1 minute: left 24 hours. Syrup, boiled again, 10 minutes, and poured on fruit: stand 2 days. Syrup, boiled again, 10 minutes, and apricots, 2 to 4 minutes, or until clear. Obs.—The syrup should be quite thick when the apricots are put in for the last time; but both fruit and sugar vary so much in quality, and in the degree of boiling which they require, that no invariable rule can be given for the latter. The apricot syrup strained very clear, and mixed with twice the quantity of pale French brandy, makes an agreeable liqueur, which is much improved by infusing in it for a few days half an ounce of the fruit-kernels, blanched and bruised, to the quart of liquor. We have found that cherries prepared by either of the receipts which we have given for preserving them with sugar, if thrown into the apricot syrup when partially dried, just scalded in it, and left for a fortnight, then drained and dried as usual, become a delicious sweet- meat. Mussel, imperatrice, or any other plums, when quite ripe, if simmered in it very gently until they are tender, and left for a few days to imbibe its flavour, then drained and finished as usual, are likewise excel- lent. PEACH-JAM, OR MARMALADE. The fruit for this preserve, which is a very delicious one, should be finely-flavoured, and quite ripe, though perfectly sound. Pare, stone, weigh, and boil it quickly for three-quarters of an hour, and do not fail to stir it[chap, XXI. 530 MODERN COOKERY. often during the time; draw it from the fire, and mix with it ten ounces of well-refined sugar, rolled or beaten to powder, for each pound of the peaches ; clear it care- fully from scum, and boil it briskly for five minutes ; throw in theWained juice of one or two good lemons; continue the boiling for three minutes only, and pour out the marmalade. Two minutes after the sugar is stirred to the fruit, add the blanched kernels of part of the peaches. Peaches, stoned and pared, 4 lbs. : § hour. Sugar, 2 J lbs. : 2 minutes. Blanched peach-kernels: 3 mi- nutes. Juice, 2 small lemons : 3 minutes. Obs.—This jam, like most others, is improved by pressing the fruit through a sieve after it has been par- tially boiled. Nothing can be finer than its flavour, which would be injured by adding the sugar at first; and a larger proportion renders it cloyingly sweet. Nectarines and peaches mixed, make an admirable preserve. TO PRESERYE, OR TO DRY PEACHES OR NECTARINES. {An easy and excellent Receipt.) The fruit should be fine, freshly gathered, and fidly ripe, but still in its perfection. Pare, halve, and weigh it after the stones are removed; lay it into a deep dish, and strew over it an equal weight of highly refined pounded sugar; let it remain until this is nearly dis- solved, then lift the fruit gently into a preserving pan, pour the juice and sugar to it, and heat the whole over a very slow fire; let it just simmer for ten minutes, then turn it softly into a bowl, and let it remain a couple of days ; repeat the slow-heating and simmering at in- tervals of two or three days, until the fruit is quite clear, when it may be potted in the syrup, or drained from it, and dried upon large clean slates or dishes, or upon wire- sieves. The flavour will be excellent. The strained juice of a lemon may be added to the syrup, with good effect, towards the end of the process, and an additional ounce or two of sugar allowed for it.CHAP. XXI.] 581 PRESERVES. DAMSON JAM. (VERY GOOD.) The fruit for this jam should be freshly gathered and quite ripe. Split, stone, weigh, and boil it quickly for forty minutes; then stir in half its weight of good sugar roughly powdered, and when it is dissolved, give the preserve fifteen minutes additional boiling, keeping it stirred, and thoroughly skimmed. Damsons stoned, 6 lbs. : 40 minutes. Sugar, 3 lbs.: 15 minutes. Obs.—A more refined preserve is made by pressing the fruit through a sieve after it is boiled tender ; but the jam is excellent without. DAMSON JELLY. Bake separately in a very slow oven, or boil in a water-bath (see page 557), any number of fine ripe damsons, and one third the quantity of bullaces, or of any other pale plums, as a portion of their juice will, to most tastes, improve, by softening the flavour of the preserve, and will render the colour brighter. Pour off the juice clear from the fruit, strain and weigh it; boil it quickly without sugar for twenty-five minutes, draw it from the fire, stir into it ten ounces of good sugar for each pound of juice, and boil it fast from six to ten minutes longer, carefully clearing off all the scum. The jelly must be often stirred before the sugar is added, and constantly afterwards. DAMSON SOLID. (GOOD.) Pour the juice from some damsons which have stood for a night in a very cool oven, or been stewed in a jar placed in a pan of water ; weigh and put it into a pre- serving pan with a pound and four ounces of pearmains (or of any other fine boiling apples), pared, cored, and quartered, to each pound of the juice ; boil these together, keeping them well stirred, from twenty-five to thirty minutes, then mix in the sugar, and when it is nearly dissolved, continue the boiling for ten minutes. This,582 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XXI. if done with exactness, will give a perfectly smooth and firm preserve, which may be moulded in small shapes, and turned out for table. To each pound clear damson-juice, lj lb. pearmains (or other good apples), pared and cored : 25 to 80 mi- nutes. Sugar, 14 ozs.: 10 minutes. EXCELLENT DAMSON CHEESE. When the fruit has been baked or stewed tender, as directed above, drain off the juice, skin and stone the damsons, pour back to them from a third to half of their juice, weigh and then boil them over a clear brisk fire until they form a quite dry paste ; add six ounces of ptfunded sugar for each pound of the plums; stir them off the fire till this is dissolved, then boil the preserve again without quitting or ceasing to stir it, until it leaves the pan quite dry, and adheres in a mass to the spoon. If it should not stick to the fingers when lightly touched, it will be sufficiently done to keep very long ; press it quickly into pans or moulds ; lay on it a paper dipped in spirit when it is perfectly cold, tie another fold over it, and store it in a dry place. Bullace cheese is made in the same manner, and almost any kind of plum will make an agreeable pre- serve of the sort. To each pound of fruit, pared, stoned, and mixed with the juice, and boiled quite dry, 6 ozs. of pounded sugar : boiled again to a dry paste. GRAPE JELLY. Strip from their stalks some fine ripe black-cluster grapes, and stir them with a wooden spoon over a gentle fire until all have burst, and the juice flows freely from them ; strain it off without pressure, and pass it through a jelly-bag, or through a twice-doubled muslin; weigh and then boil it rapidly for twenty minutes; draw it from the fire, stir in it till dissolved, fourteen ounces of good sugar roughly powdered, to each pound of juice, and boil the jelly quickly for fifteen minutes longer, keep-CHAP. XXI.] PRESERVES. 583 ing it constantly stirred, and perfectly well skimmed. It will be very clear and of a beautiful pale rose-colour. Juice of black-cluster grapes : 20 minutes. To each lb. of juice, 14 ozs. good sugar : 15 minutes. Obs.—We have proved this jelly only with the kind of grape which we have named, but there is little doubt that fine purple grapes of any sort would answer for it well. ENGLISH GUAVA. Strip the stalks from a gallon or two of the large kind Of bullaces called the shepherd’s bullace; give park of them a cut, put them into stone jars, and throw into one of them a pound or two of imperatrice plums, if they can be obtained ; put the jars into pans of water, and boil them as directed at page 557 ; then drain off the juice, pass it through a thick strainer or jelly-bag, and weigh it; boil it quickly from fifteen to twenty minutes; take it from the fire, and stir in it till dis- solved three-quarters of a pound of sugar to the pound of juice ; remove the scum with care, and boil the preserve again quickly from eight to twelve minutes, or longer should it not then jelly firmly on the skimmer. When the fruit is very acid, an equal weight of juice and sugar may be mixed together in the first instance, and boiled briskly for about twenty minutes. ,It is impossible to indicate the precise time which the jelly will require, so much depends on the quality of the plums, and on the degree of boiling previously given to them in the water-bath. When properly made it is remarkably transparent and very firm. It should be poured into shallow pans or small moulds, and taken from them before it is served. When the imperatrice plum cannot be procured, any other that will give a pale red colour to the juice will answer. The bullaces alone make an admirable preserve ; and even the com- moner kind afford an excellent one. Juice of the shepherd’s bullace and imperatrice, or other red plum, 4 lbs. : 15 to 20 minutes. Sugar,MODERN COOKERY. 584 [chap. XXI. 3 lbs. : 8 to 12 minutes. Or juice of bullaces and sugar, equal weight: 20 minutes. Obs.—After the juice has been poured from the plums they may be stoned, pared, weighed, and boiled to a paste; then six ounces of sugar added to the pound, and the boiling continued until the preserve is again very dry : a small portion of the juice should be left with the fruit for this. VERY FINE IMPERATRICE-PLUM MARMALADE. Weigh six pounds of the fruit when it is quite ripe, but before the frost has touched it; give each plum a cut as it is thrown into the preserving pan, and when all are done boil them from thirty-five to forty minutes, taking out the stones as they rise to the surface, when they are quite detached from the flesh of the fruit. Draw back the pan from the fire, stir in two pounds of good sugar beaten to powder, and boil the preserve quickly for fifteen minutes. The imperatrice plum is of itself so sweet that this proportion of sugar makes with it a very rich preserve. Imperatrice plums (without the stalks) 6 lbs. ; boiled 35 to 40 minutes. Sugar, 2 lbs. (added after the stones are out), 15 minutes. Obs.—Some slight trouble would be avoided by pressing the fruit through a sieve after the first boiling ; but we do not think the marmalade would be improved by being freed from the skins of the plums. TO DRY IMPERATRICE PLUMS. (.An easy method.') Put them into jars, or wide-necked bottles, with half a pound of good sugar, rolled or pounded, to twice the weight of fruit; set them into a very cool oven for four or five hours; or if more convenient place them, with a little hay between them, in a pan of cold water, and boil them gently for rather more than three hours. Leave them in the syrup for a few days, and finish them as directed for the drying of other fruits.CHAP. XXI.] 585 PRESERVES. Tie a bladder over the necks of the jars or bottles before they are placed in the pan of water, and fasten two or three folds of paper over the former, or cork the bottles when the fruit is to be baked. The sugar should be put in after the fruit, without being shaken down; it will then dissolve gradually, and be absorbed by it equally. To each lb. of plums 8 ounces pounded sugar : baked in cool oven 4 or 5 hours, or steamed 3 hours. TO BOTTLE FRUIT FOR WINTER USE. Gather the fruit in the middle of the day in very dry weather; strip off the stalks, and have in readiness some perfectly clean and dry wide-necked bottles; turn each of these the instant before it is filled, with the neck downwards, and hold in it two or three lighted matches; drop in the fruit before the vapour escapes, shake it gently down, press in some new corks, dip the necks of the bottles into melted rosin, set them at night into an oven from which the bread has been drawn six or seven hours at least, and let them remain until the morning : if the heat be too great the bottles will burst. Cur- rants, cherries, damsons, green gages, and various other kinds of plums will remain good for quite twelve months when bottled thus if stored in a dry place. To steam the fruit, put the bottles into a copper or other vessel up to their necks in cold water, with a little hay between and under them ; light the fire, let the water heat slowly, and keep it at the point of gentle simmering until the fruit is sufficiently scalded. Some kinds will of course require a much longer time than others. From half to three-quarters of an hour will be sufficient for gooseberries, currants, and rasp- berries ; but the appearance of all will best denote their being done. When they have sunk almost half the depth of the bottles, and the skins are shrivelled, ex- tinguish the fire but leave them in the water until it is quite cold ; then wipe and store the bottles in a dry586 [CHAP. XXI. MODERN COOKERY. place. A bit of moistened bladder tied over the corks is better than the rosin when the fruit is steamed. APPLE JELLY. Various kinds of apples may be used successfully to make this jelly, but the nonsuch is by many persons preferred to all others for the - purpose. The Ripstone pippin, however, may be used for it with very good effect, either solely, or with a mixture of pearmains. It is necessary only that the fruit should be finely flavoured, and that it should boil easily to a marmalade. Pare, core, quarter, and weigh it quickly that it may not lose its colour, and to each pound pour a pint of cold water, and boil it until it is well broken, without being reduced to a quite thick pulp, as it would then be difficult to render the juice perfectly clear, which it ought to be. Drain this well from the apples, either through a fine sieve or a folded muslin strainer, and pass it afterwards through a jelly-bag, or turn the fruit at once into the last of these, and pour the liquid through a second time if needful. When it appears quite transparent, weigh, and reduce it by quick boiling for twenty minutes ; draw it from the fire, add two pounds of sugar, broken very small, for three of the decoction, stir it till it is entirely dissolved, then place the pre- serving-pan again over a clear fire and boil the preserve quickly for ten minutes, or until it jellies firmly upon the skimmer when poured from it; throw in the strained juice of a small lemon for every two pounds of jelly, a couple of minutes before it is taken from the fire. Apples, 7 lbs.; water, 7 pints : \ to full hour. Juice, 6 lbs. : 20 minutes quick boiling. Sugar, 4 lbs. : 10 to 15 minutes. Juice, 3 lemons. EXCEEDINGLY FINE APPLE JELLY. Pare quickly some highly flavoured juicy apples of any kind, or of various kinds together, for this is immaterial; slice, without dividing them, but first free them from the stalks and eyes, shake out some of theCHAP. XXl ] 587 PRESERVES. pips, and put the apples evenly into very clean large stone jars, just dipping an occasional, layer into cold water as this is done, the better to preserve the colour of the whole. Set the jars into pans of water, and boil the fruit slowly until it is quite soft, then turn it into a jelly-bag or cloth and let the juice all drop from it. The quantity which it will have yielded will be small but it will be clear and rich. Weigh and boil it for ten minutes, then draw it from the fire, and stir into it, until it is entirely dissolved, twelve ounces of good sugar to the pound and quarter (or pint) of juice. Place the preserve again over the fire and stir it without intermission, except to clear off the scum, until it has boiled from eight to ten minutes longer, for otherwise it will jelly on the surface with the scum upon it, which it will then be difficult to remove, as when touched it will break and fall into the preserve. The strained juice of one small fresh lemon to the pint of jelly should be thrown into it two or three minutes before it is poured out, and the rind of one or two cut very thin may be simmered in the juice before the sugar is added ; but the pale, delicate colour of the jelly will be injured by too much of it, and many persons would altogether prefer the pure flavour of the fruit. Juice of apples, 1 quart, or 2-i lbs. : 10 minutes. Sugar, lb.: 8 to 10 minutes. Juice 2 small lemons ; rind of 1 or more at pleasure. Obs. 1.—The quantity of apples required for it renders this a rather expensive preserve where they are not abundant, but it is a remarkably fine jelly, and turns out from the moulds in perfect shape and very firm. It may be served in the second course, or for dessert. It is sometimes made without paring the apples, or dipping them into the water, and the colour is then a deep red: we have occasionally had a pint of water added to about a gallon and a half of apples, but the jelly was not then quite so fine in flavour. Obs. 2.—The best time for making this apple-jelly is from the end of November to Christmas.588 [CHAP. XXI. MODERN COOKERY. Obs. 3.—Quince-jelly, would, without doubt, be very fine made by this receipt; but as the juice of that fruit is richer than that of the apple, a little water might be added. Alternate layers of apples and quinces would also answer well, we think. QUINCE 'JELLY. Pare, quarter, core, and weigh some ripe but quite sound quinces, as quickly as possible, and throw them as they are done into part of the water in which they are to be boiled, as directed at page 509 ; allow one pint of this to each pound of the fruit, and simmer it gently until it is a little broken, but not so long as to redden the juice, which ought to be very pale. Turn the whole into a jelly-bag, or strain the liquid through a fine cloth, and let it drain very closely from it, but without the slightest pressure. Weigh the juice, put it into a deli- cately clean preserving-pan. and boil it quickly for twenty minutes; take it from the fire and stir into it, until it is entirely dissolved, twelve ounces of sugar for each pound of juice, or fourteen ounces if the fruit should be very acid, which it will be in the earlier part of the season ; keep it constantly stirred and thoroughly cleared from scum, from ten to twenty minutes longer, or until it jellies strongly in falling from the skimmer; then pour it directly into glasses or moulds. If properly made it will be sufficiently firm to turn out of the latter, and it will be beautifully transparent, and rich in flavour. It may be made with an equal weight of juice and sugar mixed together in the first instance, and boiled from twenty or thirty minutes. It is difficult to state the time precisely, because, from different causes, it will vary very much. It should be reduced rapidly to the proper point, as long boiling injures the colour: this is always more perfectly preserved by boiling the juice without the sugar first. To each lb. pared and cored quinces, 1 pint water : | to hour. Juice boiled 20 minutes. To each lb.,589 CHAP. XXI.] PRESERVES. 12 ozs. sugar: 10 to 20 minutes. Or, juice and sugar equal weight: 20 to 30 minutes. QUINCE MARMALADE. When to economize the fruit it is not an object, pare, core, and quarter some of the inferior quinces, and boil them in as much water as will nearly cover them, till they begin to break ; strain the juice from them, and for the marmalade put half a pint of it to each pound of fresh quinces: in preparing these be careful to cut out the hard stony parts round the cores. Simmer them gently until they are perfectly tender, then press them, with the juice, through a coarse sieve; put them into a perfectly clean pan and boil them till they form almost a dry paste; add for each pound of quinces and the half pint of juice, three-quarters of a pound of sugar, in fine powder, and boil the marmalade for half an hour, stirring it gently without intermission : it will be very firm and bright in colour. If made shortly after the fruit is gathered, a little additional sugar will be required; and when a richer and less dry marmalade is better liked, it must be boiled a shorter time, and an equal weight of fruit and sugar must be used. Quinces, pared and cored, 4 lbs.; prepared juice, 1 quart: 2 to 3 hours. Boiled fast to dry, 20 to 40 minutes. Sugar, 3 lbs.: 30 minutes. Richer marmalade: quinces, 4 lbs.; juice, 1 quart; sugar, 4 lbs. QUINCE AND APPLE MARMALADE. Boil together, from three-quarters of an hour to an hour, two pounds of pearmains, or of any other well- flavoured apples, in an equal quantity of prepared quince-juice (see page 509), then take them from the fire, and mix with them a pound and a half of sugar, in fine powder ; when this is a little dissolved, set the pan again over a brisk fire, and boil the preserve for twenty minutes longer, keeping it stirred all the time.MODERN COOKERY. 590 [CHAP. XXI. Prepared quince-juice, 2 lbs.; apples, 2 lbs. : j to 1 hour. Sugar, 1J lb. : 20 minutes. QUINCE-PASTE. If the full flavour of the quinces be desired, stew them sufficiently tender to press through a sieve in the pre- pared juice of page 509 ; otherwise, in just water enough to about three parts cover them; when they are soft quite through, lift them out, let them cool, and then pass them through a sieve; reduce them to a dry paste, over a very clear fire, and stir them constantly; then weigh the fruit, and mix it with an equal proportion of pounded sugar, or with sugar boiled to candy height (we find the effect nearly the same, whichever method be pursued), and stir the paste without intermission until it is again so dry as to quit the pan and adhere to the spoon in one large ball; press it into shallow pans or dishes-; cut it, as soon as cold, into small squares, and, should they seem to require it, dry them with a very gentle degree of heat, and when they are again cold store them in tin cases with well-dried foolscap paper between them ; the paste may be moulded, when more convenient, and kept until it is wanted for table in a very dry place. In France, where the fruit is admirably confected, the p&te des coigns, or quince-paste, is some- what less boiled than we have directed, and dried afterwards in the sun, or in an extremely gentle oven, in square rims of tin, about an inch and a half deep, placed upon clean plates. JELLY OF SIBERIAN CRABS. This fruit makes a jelly of beautiful colour, and of pleasant flavour also ; it may be stored in small moulds of ornamental shape, and turned out for a dessert dish. Take off the stalks, weigh and wash the crabs, then to each pound and a half, add a pint of water, and boil them gently until they are broken, but do not allow them to fall to a pulp. Pour the whole into a jelly- bag, and when the juice is quite transparent, weigh it,591 PRESERVES. CHAP. XXI.] put it into a clean preserving-pan, boil it quickly for ten minutes, take it from the fire, and stir in it, till dissolved, ten ounces of fine sugar, roughly powdered, for each pound of the juice ; boil the jelly from twelve to fifteen minutes, skim it very clean, and pour it into the mould. Should the quantity be large, a few addi- tional minutes’ boiling must be given to the juice before the sugar is added. To each l\ lb. of crabs, water, 1 pint: 12 to 18 minutes. Juice to be boiled fast, 10 minutes; sugar, to each pound, 10 ozs.: 12 to 15 minutes. TO PRESERVE BARBERRIES IN BUNCHES. Take the finest barberries, without stones, that can be procured, tie them together in bunches of four or five sprigs, and for each half pound of the fruit (which is extremely light), boil one pound of very good sugar in a pint of water for twenty minutes, and clear it well from scum ; throw in the fruit, let it heat gently, and then boil from five to seven minutes, when it will be perfectly transparent. • So long as any snapping noise is heard, the fruit is not all done; it should be pressed equally down into the syrup till the whole of the berries have burst; it should then be turned into jars, which must be covered with skin, or with two or three folds of thick paper, as soon as the preserve is perfectly cold. The barberries thus prepared make a beautiful garnish for sweet dishes, or for custard puddings. Barberries, tied in bunches, 1^ lb. Sugar, 3 lbs. ; water, 1-J pint : 20 minutes. Barberries boiled in syrup, 5 to 7 minutes. BARBERRY JELLY. To each pound of barberries, stripped from the stalks, put a pint and a half of cold water, and boil them for fifteen minutes ; bruise them with the back of a wooden spoon, pour them into hair-sieve or muslin strainer, and pass the juice afterwards through a jelly-bag. When it appears perfectly clear, weigh and then boil it fast for592 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XXI. ten minutes; take it from the fire, and stir into it as many pounds of sugar in fine powder as there were pounds of juice; when this is dissolved boil the jelly again for ten minutes, skim it carefully, and pour it into jars or glasses : if into the latter warm them previously, or the boiling jelly may cause them to break. Barberries 3 lbs.; water 41 pints : 15 minutes. Juice alone: 10 minutes. To each pound of juice 1 of sugar; 10 minutes. BARBERRY JAM. (.A good Receipt.') The barberries for this preserve should be quite ripe, though they should not be allowed to hang until they begin to decay. Pick them from the stalks, throw aside such as are spotted, and for each pound of the fruit allow eighteen ounces of well-refined sugar; boil this, with one pint of water to every four pounds, until it becomes white, and falls in thick masses from the spoon ; then throw in the fruit, and keep it stirred over a brisk fire for six minutes only; take off the scum, and pour it into jars or glasses.

The preceding is an excellent receipt, but the pre- serve will be very good if eighteen ounces of pounded sugar be mixed and boiled with the fruit for ten minutes; and this is done at a small expense of time and trouble. Sugar pounded, 2J lbs. ; fruit, 2 lbs. : boiled 10 minutes. VERY COMMON BARBERRY JAM. Weigh the fruit after it has been stripped from the stalks, and boil it for ten minutes over a moderate fire, keeping it stirred all the time; then add to it an equalCHAP.

Lisbon sugar, 3 lbs.: 5 minutes Obs.— The small barberry, without stones, must be used for the foregoing receipts, but for those* which follow either sort will answer. SUPERIOR BARBERRY-JELLY, AND MARMALADE. Strip the fruit from the stems, wash it in spring- water, drain, bruise it slightly, and put it into a clean stone jar, with no more liquid than the drops which hang about it. Place the jar in a pan of water, and steam the fruit until it is quite tender : this will be in from thirty minutes to an hour. Pour off the clear juice, strain, weigh, and boil it fast from five to seven minutes, with eighteen ounces of sugar to every pound. For the marmalade, press the barberries through a sieve with a wooden spoon, and boil them quickly for the same time, and with the same proportion of sugar as the jelly. Barberries boiled in water-bath till tender; to each pound of juice, 1 lb. 2 ozs. sugar: 5 minutes. Pulp of fruit, to each pound, 18 ozs. sugar : 5 minutes. Gbs.—We have always had these preserves made with very ripe fruit, and have found them extremely good; but more sugar may be needed to sweeten them sufficiently when the barberries have hung less time upon the trees. ORANGE MARMALADE. Rasp very slightly on a fine and delicately clean grater the rinds of some sound Seville oranges; cut them in quarters, and separate the flesh from the rinds ; then with the small end of a tea or egg spoon, clear it entirely from the pips, and from the loose inner skin and film. Put the rinds into a large quantity of cold water, and change it when they have boiled about twenty minutes. As soon as they are perfectly tender lift them out, and drain them on a sieve; slice them thin, and add eight ounces of them to each pound of Q. Q.594? MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XXI. the pulp and juice, with a pound and a half of highly- refined sugar in fine powder; boil the marmalade quickly for half an hour, skim it well, and turn it into the jars. This marmalade has not a very powerful flavour of the orange-rind. When more of this is liked, either leave a portion of the fruit unrasped, or mix with the preserve some of the zest which has been grated off, allowing for it its weight of sugar. Or pro- ceed thus: allow to a dozen Seville oranges two fine juicy lemons, and take the weight of the whole in sifted sugar, of excellent quality. With a sharp knife cut through the rinds just deep enough to allow them to be stripped off in quarters with the end of a spoon, and throw them for a night into plenty of cold spring- water ; on the following morning boil them sufficiently tender to allow the head of a pin to pierce them easily; then drain them well, let them cool, and scrape out the white part of the rind, and cut the remainder into thin chips. In the mean time have the pulp of the fruit quite cleared from the pips and film : put it with the sugar and chips into a preserving pan, heat it slowly, then boil it from twenty to thirty minutes : it will be very rich, good marmalade. The sugar, first broken into large lumps, is sometimes made into a very thick syrup, with so much water only as will just dissolve it; the pulp and juice are in that case boiled in it quickly for ten minutes before the chips are added; and a part of these are pounded and stirred into the preserve with the others. March is the proper month for making this preserve, the Seville orange being then in perfection. For lemon marmalade proceed exactly in the same man- ner as for this. The whole of the rinds of either fruit are pounded to a paste, and then boiled with the pulp, to make what is called transparent marmalade. Rinds of Seville oranges, lightly rasped and boiled tender, 2 lbs. ; pulp and juice, 4 lbs. ; sugar, 6 lbs: i hour. Or, weight of oranges, first taken in sugar, and added, with all the rinds, to the pulp after the whole has been properly prepared.5 95 CHAP. XXI.] PRESERVES. GENUINE SCOTCH MARMALADE. “Take some bitter oranges, and double their weight of sugar ; cut the rind of the fruit into quarters and peel it off, and if the marmalade be not wanted very thick, take off some of the spongy white skin inside the rind. Cut the chips as thin as possible, and about half an inch long, and divide the pulp into small bits, removing carefully the seeds, which may be steeped in part of the water that is to make the marmalade, and which must be in the proportion of a quart to a pound of fruit. Put the chips and pulp into a deep earthen dish, and pour the water boiling over them; let them remain for twelve or fourteen hours, and then turn the whole into the pre- serving pan, and boil it until the chips are perfectly tender. When they are so, add by degrees the sugar (which should be previously pounded), and boil the marmalade until it jellies. The water in which the seeds have been steeped, and which must be taken from the quantity apportioned to the whole of the preserve, should be poured into a hair-sieve, and the seeds well worked in it with the back of a spoon; a strong clear jelly will be obtained by this means, which must be washed off them by pouring their own liquor through the sieve in small portions over them. This must be added to the fruit when it is first set on the fire.” Oranges, 3 lbs. ; water, 3 quarts; sugar, 6 lbs. Obs.—This receipt, which we have not tried ourselves, is guaranteed as an excellent one by the Scottish lady from whom it was procured. ORANGE CONSERVE FOR PUDDINGS. Wash and then soak in plenty of spring-water for three days, changing it night and morning, half a dozen Seville oranges; then boil them till they are sufficiently tender for the head of a pin to pierce them easily; drain and weigh them, and for each pound take and reduce to fine powder two pounds of good sugar. Cut the oranges asunder, and remove the pips and the coarse loose skinMODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XXI 596 of the cores; then heat them, with the sugar, in a large mortar, and pick out as this is done any bits of fibre or coarse inner skin which cannot be reduced to a paste. When the whole forms a smooth conserve, put it into small jars for use, as it requires no boiling after the fruit and sugar are mixed : if stored in a dry place it will remain good for two years. Each orange should be tied in a thin small cloth or a bit of muslin when it is boiled, and the water should be changed once (or even twice when the fine aromatic bitter of the rind is altogether objected to), or the fruit may be lifted from the water and thrown immediately into another pan containing more which is ready boiling. Two tablespoonsful of this conserve, with the yolks of five or six eggs, a couple of ounces of sugar, and as much clarified butter smoothly mixed and well beaten together will make good cheesecakes, or an excel- lent but not large pudding: the same proportion will be found an agreeable addition to a plum pudding also. Seville oranges, boiled tender, 2 lbs. ; sugar, 4 lbs.: beaten together, not boiled. CHAPTER XXII. TICKLES. OBSERVATIONS ON PICKLES. The first requisite in making pickles is to have unadul- terated vinegar, for all the expense and trouble bestowed upon them is often entirely lost in consequence of ingre- dients being mixed with this, which soften and some- times even partially decompose the substances immersed in it. That which is home-made is generally found for all purposes to answer best, and it may be prepared of almost any degree of strength by increasing the ordinary proportion of fruit and sugar, or whatever else may be used for it. The refuse of raisin-wine, and green goose- berries, may both be converted into excellent vinegar:CHAP. XXII.] PICKLES. 597 but unless the pickles be quite covered with their liquor, and well protected from the air and from the influence of damp, which is more than anything destructive of them, the purity of the vinegar wdll not preserve them eatable. We can confidently recommend to the reader the rather limited number of receipts which follow, and which might easily be multiplied did the size of our volume permit. Pickling is so easy a process, however, that when in any degree properly acquired, it may be extended to almost every kind of fruit and vegetable successfully. A few of the choicer kinds will neverthe- less be found generally more acceptable than a greater variety of inferior preparations. Mushrooms, gherkins, walnuts, lemons, eschalots, and peaches, for all of which we have given minute directions, will furnish as much choice as is commonly required. Very excellent Indian mangoes too may be purchased at the Italian warehouses, and to many tastes will be more acceptable than any English pickle. We have had them very good from Mr. Cobbett, 18, Pall Mall, whose house we have already had occasion to name. TO PICKLE CHERRIES. Leave about an inch of their stalks on some fine, sound, Kentish or Flemish cherries, that are not over- ripe; put them into a jar, cover them with cold vinegar, and let them stand three weeks; pour off two-thirds of the liquor and replace it with fresh vinegar; then, after having drained it from the fruit, boil the whole with an ounce of coriander seed, a small blade of mace; a few grains of cayenne, or a teaspoonful of white peppercorns, and four bruised cochineals to every quart, all tied loosely in a fold of muslin.. Let the pickle become quite cold before it is added to the cherries : in a month they will be fit for use. The vinegar that is poured from the fruit makes a good syrup of itself when boiled with a pound of sugar to the pint, but it is im- proved by having some fresh raspberries, cherries, or currants, infused in it previously for three or four days.MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XXII. 598 TO PICKLE GHERKINS. Let the gherkins be gathered on a dry day, before the frost has touched them ; take off the blossoms, put them into a stone jar, and pour over them sufficient boiling brine to cover them well. The following day take them out, wipe them singly, lay them into a clean stone jar, with a dozen bay-leaves over them, and pour upon them the following pickle, when it is boiling fast : as much vinegar as will more than cover the gherkins by an inch or two, with an ounce and a quarter of salt, a quarter- ounce of black peppercorns, an ounce and a half of ginger sliced, or slightly bruised, and two small blades of mace to every quart; put a plate over the jar, and leave it for two days, then drain off the vinegar, and heat it afresh ; when it boils throw in the gherkins, and keep them just on the point of simmering for two or three minutes ; pour the whole back into the jar, put the plate again upon it, and let it remain until the pickle is quite cold, when a skin, or two separate folds of thick brown paper, must be tied closely over it. The gher- kins thus pickled are very crisp, and excellent in flavour, and the colour is sufficiently good to satisfy the prudent housekeeper, to whom the brilliant and poisonous green produced by boiling the vinegar in a brass skillet (a pro- cess constantly recommended in books of cookery) is anything but attractive. To satisfy ourselves of the effect produced by the action of the acid on the metal, we had a few gherkins thrown into some vinegar which was boiling in a brass pan, and nothing could be more beautiful than the colour which they almost immediately exhibited. We fear this dangerous method is too often resorted to in preparing pickles for sale. Brine to pour on gherkins :—6 ozs. salt to each quart water : 24 hours. Pickle :—to each quart vinegar, salt, oz.; black peppercorns, ^ oz. ; ginger, sliced or bruised, 1^ oz.; mace, 2 small blades; bay-leaves; 24 to 100 gherkins, more when the flavour is liked: 2 days. Gherkins simmered in vinegar, 2 to 3 minutes. >599 PICKLES. CHAP. XXII.] Obs.—The quantity of vinegar required to cover the gherkins will be shown by that of the brine : so much depends upon their size, that it is impossible to direct the measure exactly. A larger proportion of spice can be added at pleasure. TO PICKLE NASTURTIUMS. These should be gathered quite young, and a portion of the buds, when very small, should be mixed with them. Prepare a pickle by dissolving an ounce and a half of salt in a quart of pale vinegar, and throw in the berries as they become fit, from day to day. They are used instead of capers for sauce, and by some persons are preferred to them. When purchased for pickling, put them at once into a jar, and cover them well with the vinegar. TO PICKLE GHERKINS. (A French Receipt.) Brush or wipe the gherkins very clean, throw them into plenty of fast-boiling water, and give them a single boil, take them out quickly, and throw them imme- diately into a large quantity of very cold water ; change it once, and when the gherkins themselves are quite cold, drain them well, spread them on sieves or dishes, and dry them in the air. When this is done, put them into stone jars, and pour on them as much boiling vinegar as will cover them well; heat it anew, and pour it on them again the following day; and on the next throw them into it for a minute so soon as it boils, with plenty of tarragon in branches, a few very small silver onions, and salt and whole pepper in the same proportions as in the receipt above. It should be observed that the French vinegar, from its superior .excellence, will have a very different effect, in many preparations, to that which is made up for sale generally in England; but unless it be at Mr. Beaufoy’s, Lambeth, we know not where it can be procured genuine in this country.MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XXII. 600 TO PICKLE PEACHES. Take, at their full growth, just before they begin to ripen, six large or eight moderate sized peaches; wipe the down from them, and put them into brine that will float an egg. In three days let them he taken out, and drained on a sieve reversed for several hours. Boil in a quart of vinegar for ten minutes two ounces of whole white pepper, two of ginger slightly bruised, a teaspoon- ful of salt, two blades of mace, half a pound of mustard- seed, and a half-teaspoonful of cayenne tied in a bit of muslin. Lay the peaches into a jar, and pour the boil- ing pickle on them : in two months they will be fit for use. Peaches, 6 or 8 : in brine 3 days. Yinegar, 1 quart; whole white pepper, 2 ozs.; bruised ginger, 2 ozs,; salt, 1 teaspoonful; mace, 2 blades; mustard-seed, lb. : 10 minutes. Obs.—The peaches may be converted into excellent mangoes by cutting out from the stalk-end of each a round of sufficient size to allow the stone to be ex- tracted : this should be done after they are taken from the brine. They may be filled with very f resh mustard- seed, previously washed in a little vinegar; to this a small portion of garlic, or bruised eschalots, cayenne, horse-radish, chilies (the most appropriate of any), or spice of any kind may be added, to the taste. The part cut out must then be replaced, and secured with a packthread crossed over the fruit. TO PICKLE MUSHROOMS. Select for this purpose, if they can be procured, the smallest buttons of the wild or meadow mushrooms, in preference to those which are artificially raised, and let them be as freshly gathered as possible. Cut the stems off quite close, and clean them with a bit of new flannel slightly moistened, and dipped in fine salt; throw them as they are done into plenty of spring-water, mixedCHAP. XXII.] PICKLES. 601 with a large spoonful of salt, but drain them from it quickly afterwards, and lay them into a soft cloth to dry, or the moisture which hangs about them will too much weaken the pickle. For each quart of the mushrooms thus prepared, take nearly a quart of the palest white wine vinegar; (this is far superior to the distilled vinegar generally used for the purpose, and the variation in the colour of the mushrooms will be very slight,) and add to it a heaped teaspoonful of salt, half an ounce of whole white pepper, an ounce of ginger, sliced or lightly bruised, about the fourth of a salt- spoonful of cayenne, tied in a small bit of muslin, and two large blades of mace; to these may be added half a small nutmeg, sliced; but too much spice will en- tirely overpower the fine natural flavour of the mush- rooms. When the pickle boils, throw them in, and boil them in it over a clear fire moderately fast from six to nine minutes, or somewhat longer, should they not be very small. When they are much dispropor- tioned in size, the larger ones should have two minutes’ boil before the others are thrown into the vinegar. As soon as they are tolerably tender, put them at once into small stone jars, or into warm wide-necked bottles, and divide the spice equally amongst them. The following day, or as soon as they are perfectly cold, secure them from the air with large corks, or tie skins and paper over them. They should be stored in a dry place, and guarded from severe frost. When the colour of the mushrooms is more considered than the excellence of the pickle, the distilled vinegar can be used for it. The reader may rely upon this receipt as a really good one; we have had it many times proved, and it is altogether our own. Mushroom-buttons (without the stems), 2 quarts; palest white wine vinegar, short \ gallon ; salt, large dessertspoonful, or 1-|- oz. ; white peppercorns, 1 oz.; whole ginger, 2 ozs. ; cayenne, small \ saltspoonful; 1 small nutmeg.[CHAP. XXII. MODERN COOKERY. 602 MUSHROOMS IN BRINE. For Winter use. ( Very good.) We have had small mushroom-buttons excellently preserved through the winter prepared as follows, and we therefore give the exact proportions which we had used for them, though the same quantity of brine would possibly allow of rather more mushrooms in it. Prepare them exactly as for the preceding pickle, and measure them after the stems are taken off. For each quart, boil together for five minutes two quarts of water, with half a pound of common white salt, a small dessertspoonful of white peppercorns, a couple of blades of mace, and a race of ginger; take off the scum thoroughly, and throw in the mushrooms; boil them gently for about five minutes, then put them into well warmed, wide-necked bottles, and let them become perfectly cold, pour a little good salad-oil on the top, cork them with new corks, and tie bladder over, or cover them with two separate bladders. When wanted for use, soak the mushrooms in warm water till the brine is sufficiently extracted. Mushrooms, 1 quart; water, \ gallon; salt, \ lb.; peppercorns, 1 small dessertspoonful; mace 2 blades; ginger, 1 race: 5 minutes. Mushrooms, in brine, 5 minutes. PICKLED ESCHALOTS. For a quart of ready-peeled eschalots, add to the same quantity of the best pale white wine vinegar, a dessert- spoonful of salt, and an ounce of whole white pepper; bring these quickly to a boil, take off the scum, throw in the eschalots, simmer them for two minutes only; turn them into a clean stone jar, and when they are quite cold, tie a skin, or two folds of thick paper over it. Eschalots, 1 quart; vinegar, 1 quart; salt, 1 des- sertspoonful ; whole white pepper, 1 oz. Ohs.—The sooner the eschalots are pickled after they are ripe and dry, the better they will be.603 CHAP. XXII.] PICKLES. PICKLED ONIONS. Take the smallest onions that can be procured, just after they are harvested, for they are never in so good a state for the purpose as then ; proceed, after having peeled them, exactly as for the eschalots, and when they begin to look clear, which will be in three or four minutes, put them into jars, and pour the pickle on them. The vinegar should be very pale, and their colour will then be exceedingly well preserved. Any favourite spices can be added to it. TO PICKLE LEMONS, AND LIMES. Wipe eight fine sound lemons very clean, and make at equal distances, four deep incisions in each, from the stalk to the blossom end, but without dividing the fruit; stuff them with as much salt as they will con- tain, lay them into a deep dish, and place them in a sunny window, or in some warm place, for a week or ten days, keeping them often turned and basted with their own liquor; then rub them with some good pale turmeric, and put them with their juice, into a stone jar with a small head of garlic, divided into cloves and peeled, and a dozen small onions stuck with twice as many cloves. Boil in two quarts of white wine vinegar, half a pound of ginger lightly bruised, two ounces of whole black pepper, and half a pound of mustard seed ; take them from the fire and pour them directly on the lemons; cover the jar with a plate, and let them remain till the following day, then add to the pickle half a dozen capsicums (or a few chilies if more convenient), and tie a skin and a fold of thick paper over the jar. Large lemons stuffed with salt, 8: 8 to 10 days; turmeric, 1 to 2 ozs. ; ginger, J lb.; mustard seed, J lb. ; capsicums, 6 ozs. This pickle will remain good for seven years if the lemons be kept well covered with vinegar ; that which is added to them should be boiled and then left till cold before it is poured into the jar. The lemons will not604 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XXII. be fit for table in less than twelve months ; but if wanted for more immediate use, set them for one night into a cool oven after the bread is drawn; they may then be eaten almost directly. * TO PICKLE BARBERRIES AND SIBERIAN CRABS. When wanted for garnishing only, take the fruit before it is very ripe, cut half the length of their stalks from the crabs, and free the barberries from the leaves, and from any discoloured berries that may be amongst them. Put them into stone jars, and cover them well with brine, which has been boiled and left to become per- fectly cold. Look at them occasionally during the winter, and should any scum or mould have gathered on the surface, clear it well off, drain the brine closely from the fruit, and fill the jars with some that is freshly made. Six ounces of salt, and a morsel of alum half the size of a bean to the quart of water should be boiled together for ten minutes and well skimmed, both for the first brine, and for any that may be required afterwards. To pickle these fruits in vinegar, add the alum to a sufficient quantity to cover them, and boil it with a few white pepper-corns, which must be strained out before it is poured into the jars, it must be quite cold when added to the barberries or crabs; these last should not be ripe wffien they are used, or they will burst in the pickle; they should have attained their growth and full colour, but be still hard. * The turmeric and the garlic may be omitted from this pickle with advantage, we think. Limes must have but slight incisions made in the rinds; and they will be sufficiently softened in four or five days. Two ounces of salt only will be required for half a dozen; and all which remains unmelted must, with their juice, be put into the jar wiih them before the vinegar is poured on : this should be mixed with spice and mustard-seed, and be boiling when it is added to the limes.CAKES. CHAP. XXIII.] 005 CHAPTER XXIII. CAKES. GENERAL REMARKS ON CAKES, Paste-board mould for lara:e buns. The ingredients for cakes, as well as for puddings, should all be fresh and good, as well as free from damp ; the lightness of many kinds depends entirely on that given to the eggs by whisking, and by the manner in which the whole is mixed. A small portion of car- bonate of soda, which will not be in the slightest degree perceptible to the taste after the cake is baked, if thrown in just before the mixture is put into the oven, will ensure its rising well. To guard against the bitterness so often imparted by yeast when it is used for cakes or biscuits, it should be sparingly added, and the sponge should be left twice the usual time to rise. This method will be found to606 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XXIII. answer equally with bread. For example: should a couple of spoonsful of yeast be ordered in a receipt, when it is bitter, use but one, and let it stand two hours instead of half the time: the fermentation, though slow, will be quite as perfect as if it were more quickly effected, and the cake or loaf thus made will not become dry by any means so soon as if a larger portion of yeast were mixed with it. All light cakes require a rather brisk oven to raise and set them; very large rich ones a well-sustained degree of heat sufficient to bake them through; and small sugar-cakes a very slow oven, to prevent their taking a deep colour before they are half done : ginger- bread too should be gently baked, unless it be of the * light thick kind. Meringues, macaroons, and ratafias, will bear a slight degree more of heat than these. For sponge and savoy cakes the French butter their moulds thickly, and shake fine sugar in them until they are equally covered with it: the loose sugar must be turned out before they are used. To ascertain whether a cake be done, thrust a knife into the centre, and should this come out clean draw it from the oven directly ; but should the paste adhere to it continue the baking. Several sheets of paper are placed usually under large plum-cakes. TO BLANCH ALMONDS. Put them into a saucepan with plenty of cold water, and heat it slowly ; when it is just scalding turn the almonds into a basin, peel, and throw them into cold water as they are done : dry them well in a soft cloth before they are used. If the water be too hot it wiT turn them yellow. TO POUND ALMONDS. Almonds are more easily pounded, and less liable to become oily, if dried a little in a very gentle degree of heat after they are blanched; left for example, in a warm room for two or three days, lightly spread on aCHAP. XXIII.] CAKES. 607 large dish or tin. They should be sprinkled during the beating with a few drops of cold water, or white of egg,, or lemon-juice, and pounded to a smooth paste : this is more easily done, we believe, when they are first roughly chopped, but we prefer to have them thrown at once into the mortar. TO REDUCE ALMONDS TO A PASTE. (The quickest and easiest way.) Chop them a little on a large and very clean trencher, then with a paste-roller (rolling-pin), which ought to be thicker in the middle than at the ends, roll them well until no small bits are perceptible amongst them. We have found this method answer admirably ; but as some of the oil is expressed from the almonds by it, and absorbed by the board, we would recommend a marble slab for them in preference, when it is at hand; and should they be intended for a sweet dish, that some pounded sugar should be strewed under them. When a board or strong trencher is used, it should be rather higher in the middle than at the sides. TO PREPARE BUTTER FOR RICH CAKES. For all large and very rich cakes the usual directions are, to beat the butter to a cream ; but we find that they are quite as light, if not more so, when it is cut small and gently melted with just so much heat as will dissolve it, and no more. If it be shaken round in a saucepan previously warmed, and held near the fire for a short time, it will soon be liquified, which is all that is required : it must on no account be hot when it is added to the other ingredients, to which it must be poured in small portions after they are all mixed, in the way which we have minutely described in the receipt for a Madeira cake, and that of the Sutherland puddings. (Chapter XVIII.) To cream it, drain the water well from it, after it is cut, soften it a little before the fire should it be very hard, and then with the back of a large strong wooden spoon beat it until it resembles[CHAP. XXIII. 608 MODERN COOKERY. thick cream. When prepared thus, the sugar is added to it first, and then the other ingredients in succession. TO WHISK EGGS FOR LIGHT RICH CAKES. Break them one by one, and separate the yolks from the whites : this is done easily by pouring the yolk from one half of the shell to the other, and letting the white drop from it into a basin beneath. With a small three- pronged fork take out the specks from each egg as it is broken, that none may accidentally escape notice. Whisk the yolks until they appear light, and the whites until they are a quite solid froth ; while any liquid remains at the bottom of the bowl they are not sufficiently beaten; when a portion of them, taken up with the whisk, and dropped from it, remains standing in points, they are in the proper state for use, and should be mixed into the cake directly. ORANGE-FLOWER MACAROONS. (DELICIOUS.) Have ready two pounds of very dry white sifted sugar. Weigh two ounces of the petals of freshly- gathered orange-blossoms after they have been picked from the stems; and cut them very small with a pair of scissors into the sugar, as they will become discoloured if not mixed with it quickly after they are cut. When all are done, add the whites of seven eggs, and beat the whole well together till it looks like snow; then drop the mixture upon paper without delay, and send the cakes to a very cool oven. Pounded sugar, 2 lbs.; orange-blossoms, 2 ozs.; whites of eggs, 7 : 20 minutes, or more. Ohs.—It is almost impossible to state with accuracy the precise time required for these cakes, so much de- pends on the oven: they should be very delicately coloured, and yet dried through. ALMOND MACAROONS. Blanch a pound of fresh Jordan almonds, wipe them dry, and set them into a very cool oven to render themCHAP. XXIII.] CAKES. 609 perfectly so ; pound them to an exceedingly smooth paste, with a little white of egg; then whisk to a firm solid froth the whites of seven eggs, or of eight, should they be small; mix with them a pound and a half of the finest sugar; add these by degrees to the almonds, whisk the whole up well together, and drop the mixture upon wafer-paper, which may be procured at the con- fectioner’s : bake them in a moderate oven a very pale brown. It is an improvement to the flavour of these cakes to substitute an ounce of bitter almonds for one of the sweet: they are sometimes made with an equal weight of each; and another variety of them is obtained by gently browning the almonds in a slow oven before they are pounded. Jordan almonds blanched, 1 lb.; -sugar, 1£ lb. ; whites of 7 or 8 eggs : 15 to 20 minutes. IMPERIALS. (NOT VERY RICH.) Work into a pound of flour six ounces of butter, and mix well with them half a pound of sifted sugar, six ounces of currants, two ounces of candied orange-peel, the grated rind of a lemon, and four well-beaten eggs. Flour a tin lightly, and with a couple of forks place the paste upon it in small rough heaps quite two inches apart. Bake them in a very gentle oven, from a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes, or until they are equally coloured to a pale brown. Flour, 1 lb.; butter, 6 ozs.; sugar, 8 ozs.; currants, 6 ozs.; candied peel, 2 ozs.; rind of 1 lemon; eggs, 4 : 15 to 20 minutes. VERY GOOD SMALL RICH CAKES. Beat and mix well together four eggs properly whisked, and half a pound of fine sifted sugar; pour to them by degrees a quarter-pound of clarified butter, as little warmed as posssible; stir lightly in with these four ounces of dry sifted flour, beat the mixture for about ten minutes, put it into small buttered -pattypans, and bake the cakes a quarter R R610 MODERN COOKERY.

Eggs, 4 ; sugar, \ lb.; butter, 4 ozs.; flour, 4 ozs.; lemon-rind, mace, or cinnamon : baked 15 minutes. ALMOND ROCHER. Chop very fine together eight ounces of almonds, blanched and dried, six of candied orange-rind, or of orange and lemon rind mixed, and one ounce of citron ; then add to them two ounces of flour, three-quarters of a pound of sugar, a small teaspoonful of mace and cin- namon mixed, and the whites of three large eggs; roll the mixture into balls about the size of a large marble, and bake them on wafer-paper twenty minutes in a moderate oven : they should be quite crisp, but not deeply coloured. Almonds, 8 ozs. ; candied orange-rind, 6 ozs.; citron, 1 oz.; flour, 2 ozs.; sugar, j lb.; mace and cinnamon mixed, 1 teaspoonful; whites of eggs, 3 large : baked, moderate oven, ,20 minutes. Obs.—When the flavour is not disliked, it will be found an improvement to substitute an ounce of bitter almonds for one of the sweet; and we prefer the whole of the almonds and candied peel also cut into spikes instead of being chopped : the ingredients must then be made into a lither paste, and placed in small heaps on the paper.

Blanch, dry, and pound to the finest possible paste eight ounces of fresh Jordan almonds, and one ounce of bitter; moisten them with a few drops of cold water or white of egg, to prevent their oiling; then mix with them very gradually twelve fresh eggs which have been whisked until they are exceedingly light; throw in by degrees one pound of fine, dry, sifted sugar, and keep the mixture light by constant beating, with a large wooden spoon, as the separate ingredients are added. Mix inCAKES. 611 CHAP. XXIII.] by degrees three-quarters of a pound of dried and sifted flour of the best quality; then pour gently from the sediment a pound of butter which has been just melted, but not allowed to become hot, and beat it very gradu- ally but very thoroughly into the cake, letting one por- \ tion entirely disappear before another is thrown in; add the rasped or finely-grated rinds of two sound fresh lemons, fill a thickly buttered mould rather more than half full with the mixture, and bake the cake from an hour and a half to two hours in a well-heated oven. Lay paper over the top when it is sufficiently coloured, and guard carefully against its being burned. Jordan almonds, lb.; bitter almonds, 1 oz.; eggs, 12; sugar, 1 lb.; flour, f lb.; butter, 1 lb.; rinds, lemons, 2 : 1^ to 2 hours. Obs.—Three-quarters of a pound of almonds may be mixed with this cake when so large a portion of them is liked, but an additional ounce or two of sugar, and one egg or more, will then be required. POUND CAKE. Mix, as directed in the foregoing receipt, ten eggs (some cooks take a pound in weight of these), one pound of sugar, one of flour, and the same of butter. A glass of brandy and a pound of currants may be added very gradually just before the cake is put into the oven, with any spice that is liked, and two or three ounces of candied orange or lemon rind, sliced thin, or an ounce of carraway seeds may supply the place of all. A cake made with half the quantity of the ingredients must be baked one hour. RICE CAKE. Take six eggs, with their weight in fine sugar and in butter also, and half their weight of flour of rice, and half of wheaten flour ; make the cake as directed for the Madeira or almond cake, but throw in the rice after the flour; then add the butter in the usual way, and bake the cake about an hour and ten minutes.

Eggs, in the shell, 6; their weight in butter and in sugar; half as much flour of rice, and the same of wheaten flour: 1 hour, 10 minutes. WHITE CAKE. Beat half a pound of fresh butter to a cream, add to it an equal quantity of dried and sifted sugar, the yolks and whites of eight eggs, separately whisked, two ounces of candied orange-peel, half a teaspoon- ful of mace, a glass of brandy, one pound of flour strewed in by degrees, and last of all, a pound and a quarter of currants. Directly it is mixed send the cake to a well-heated oven, and bake it a couple of hours. Four ounces of beaten almonds are sometimes added to it.

Rasp on' some lumps of well-refined sugar the rind of a fine sound lemon, and scrape off the part that has im- bibed the essence, or crush the lumps to powder, and add them to as much more as will make up the weight of eight or ten fresh eggs in the shell; break these one by one, and separate the whites from the yolks; beat the latter in a large bowl for ten minutes, then strew in the sugar gradually, and beat them well together. In the mean time let the whites be whisked to quite a solid froth, add them to the yolks, and when they are well blended sift and stir the flour gently to them, but do not beat it into the mixture; pour the cake into a well-buttered mould, and bake it an hour and a quarter in a moderate oven. Rasped rind 1 large lemon; fresh eggs, 8 or 10; their weight of dry, sifted sugar; and half their weight of flour: baked. 1J hour, moderate oven.CHAP, XXIII.] CAKES. 613 A SMALLER SPONGE CAKE. ( Very good.) Five full-sized eggs, the weight of four in sugar, and of nearly three in flour, will make an exceedingly good cake: it may be flavoured like the preceding one, with lemon-rind, or with bitter almonds, vanilla, or confected orange-blossoms reduced to powder. An hour will bake it thoroughly. All the ingredients for sponge cakes should be of good quality, and the sugar and flour should be dry; they should also be passed through a fine sieve kept expressly for such purposes. The excel- lence of the whole depends much on the manner in which the eggs are whisked; this should be done as lightly as possible; but it is a mistake to suppose that they cannot be too long beaten, as after they are brought to a state of perfect firmness they are injured by a con- tinuation of the whisking, and will at times curdle, or render a cake heavy from this cause. A SPONGE CAKE. {Good and quickly made.) Beat together for between twenty and thirty minutes, the yolks of nine and the whites of five fresh eggs; then by degrees add three-quarters of a pound of sugar, and six and a half of flour. Flavour it or not, at choice, with the grated rind of a lemon, and bake it an hour^ or rather more, in a brisk oven. A GOOD MADEIRA CAKE. Whisk four fresh eggs until they are as light as possible, then, continuing still to whisk them, throw in by slow degrees, the following ingredients in the order in which they are written : six ounces of dry, pounded, and sifted sugar; six of flour, also dried and sifted; four ounces of butter just dissolved, but not heated; the rind of a fresh lemon; and the instant before the cake is moulded, beat well in a third of a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda: bake it in an hour in a moderate[CHAP. XXIII. MODERN COOKERY. 614 oven. In this, as in all compositions of the same nature, observe particularly that each portion of butter must be beaten into the mixture until no appearance of it remains before the next is added ; and if this be done, and the preparation be kept light by constant and light whisking, the cake will be as good, if not better, than if the butter were creamed. Candied citron can be added to the paste, but it is not needed. Eggs, 4 ; sugar, 6 ozs.; flour, 6 ozs.; butter, 4 ozs.; rind of 1 lemon; carbonate of soda, third of teaspoonful: 1 hour, moderate oven. BANBURY CAKES. First, mix well together a pound of currants, cleaned with great nicety and dried, a quarter-pound of beef- suet, finely minced, three ounces each of candied orange and lemon rind, shred small, a few grains of salt, a full quarter-ounce of pounded cinnamon and nutmeg mixed, and four ounces of macaroons or ratifias rolled to pow- der. Next, make a light paste with fourteen ounces of butter to the pound of flour; give it an extra turn or two to prevent its rising too much in the oven ; roll out one-half in a very thin square, and spread the mixed fruit and spice equally upon it; moisten the edges, lay on the remaining half of the paste, rolled equally thin, press the edges securely together, mark the whole with the back of a knife in regular divisions of two inches wide and three in length; bake the pastry in a well- heated oven from twenty-five to thirty minutes, and divide it into cakes while it is still warm. They may be served as a second course dish either hot or cold, and may be glazed at pleasure. Currants, 1 lb.; beef-suet, 4 ozs.; candied orange and lemon rind each, 3 ozs.; salt, small pinch; mixed spices, J oz.; macaroons or ratifias, 4 ozs. : baked 25 to 30 minutes. MERINGUES. Beat to a very solid froth the whites of six fresh615 CHAP. XXIII.] CAKES. eggs, and have ready to mix with them half a pound of the best sugar, well dried and sifted. Lay some squares or long strips of writing-paper closely upon a board, which ought to be an inch thick to prevent the meringues from receiving any colour from the bottom of the oven. When all is ready for them, stir the sugar to the beaten eggs, and with a table or dessert spoon lay the mixture on the paper in the form of a half egg; sift sugar quickly over, blow off all that does not adhere, and set the meringues immediately into a mode- rate oven : the process must be expeditious, or the sugar melting will cause the meringues to spread instead of retaining their shape. When they are coloured a light brown and are firm to the touch, draw them out, raise them from the|paper, and press back the insides with a tea-spoon, or scoop them out so as to leave space enough to admit some whipped cream or preserve, with which they are to be filled, when cold, before they are served. Put them again into the oven to dry gently, and when they are ready for table fasten them together in the shape of a whole egg, and pile them lightly on a napkin for the second course. Whites of fresh eggs, 6 ; sifted sugar, ^ lb. Ohs.—Four ounces of pounded almonds may be mixed with the eggs and sugar for these cakes, and any flavour added to them at pleasure. If well made they are remarkably good, and elegant in appearance. They must be fastened together with a little white of egg. THICK, LIGHT GINGERBREAD. Crumble down very small eight ounces of butter into a couple of pounds of flour, then add to, and mix thoroughly with them, half a pound of good brown sugar, two ounces of powdered ginger, and half an ounce of ground carraway-seeds ; beat gradually to these, first two pounds of treacle, next three well whisked eggs, and last of all half an ounce of carbo- nate of soda, dissolved in a very small cupful of warm water; stir the whole briskly together, pour the mix-616 [CHAP.

For children part of the spice and butter may be omitted. Flour, 2 lbs.; butter, 8 ozs.; sugar, ^ lb.; pow- dered ginger, 2 ozs.; ground carraway-seeds, oz. ; treacle, 2 lbs.; eggs, 3; carbonate of soda, 1 oz.; water, very small cupful: baked hour. Obs.—We think that something less than the half ounce of soda wmuld be sufficient for this gingerbread, for with the whole quantity it rises in the oven to three times its height and is apt to run over the tops of the tins even when they are but half-filled with it at first. GOOD COMMON GINGERBREAD. Work very smoothly six ounces of fresh butter (or some that has been well washed from the salt, and wrung dry in a cloth,) into one pound of flour, and mix with them thoroughly an ounce of ginger in fine powder, four ounces of brown sugar, and half a teaspoonful of beaten cloves and mace. Wet these with three-quarters of a pound, or rather more, if needful, of cold treacle; roll out the paste, cut the cakes with a round tin cutter, lay them on a floured or buttered baking tin, and put them into a very slow oven. Lemon-grate or candied peel can be added, when it is liked. Flour, 1 lb.; butter, 6 ozs.; sugar, J lb.; ginger, 1 oz.; cloves and mace, teaspoonful; treacle, f lb. : A to f hour. RICHER GINGERBREAD. Melt together three-quarters of a pound of treacle and half a pound of fresh butter, pour these hot on a pound of flour mixed with half a pound of sugar and three-quarters of an ounce of ginger. When the paste is quite cold, roll it out with as much flour as will prevent its adhering to the board : bake the cakes in a very gentle oven.617 CAKES. CHAP. XXIII.] COCOA-NUT GINGERBREAD. Mix well together ten ounces of fine wheaten flour, and six of flour of rice (or rice ground to powder), the grated rind of a lemon, and three-quarters of an ounce of ginger ; pour nearly boiling upon these a pound of treacle, five ounces of fresh butter, and five of sugar,, melted together in a saucepan; beat the mixture, which will be almost a batter, with a wooden spoon, and when quite smooth leave it till it is perfectly cold, then add to it five ounces of grated cocoa-nut, and when it is thoroughly blended with the other ingre- dients, lay the paste in small heaps upon a buttered tin, and bake them in a very slack oven from half to three- quarters of an hour. Flour, 10 ozs.; ground rice, 6 ozs.; rind of 1 lemon; ginger, f oz.; treacle, 1 lb.; sugar, 5 ozs. ; butter, 5 ozs.; cocoa-nut, 5 ozs. : \ to j hour. ANOTHER RECEIPT FOR COCOA-NUT GINGERBREAD. This receipt varies from the preceding one only in its proportions. On eight ounces of flour, well mixed with ah equal weight of ground rice,* three-quarters of an ounce of ginger, and the rind of a lemon, pour hot the same quantities of treacle, butter, and sugar, as directed above. When the paste is cold, strew over, and beat well into it, six ounces and a half of grated cocoa-nut. A couple of ounces of candied peel, cut small, can be added, at pleasure. Flour, 1 lb.; ground rice, \ lb.; ginger, J oz. ; rind of 1 lemon; butter, 5 ozs.; sugar, 5 ozs.; treacle, lib.; cocoa-nut, 61 ozs. Ohs.—We can particularly recommend these receipts to the reader : the cakes made by them are excellent. CHEAP GINGER BISCUITS.

Boll it thin, cut out the biscuits with a cutter, and bake them in a slow oven until they are crisp quite through, but keep them of a pale colour. A couple of eggs are sometimes mixed with the milk for them, but are no material improvement; an additional ounce of sugar may be used when a sweeter biscuit is liked. To make good ginger cakes, increase the butter to six ounces, and the sugar to eight, for each pound of flour, and wet the ingredients into a paste with eggs : a little lemon-grate will give it an agreeable flavour. Biscuits: flour, 2 lbs.; butter, 3 ozs. ; pounded sugar, 3 ozs.; ginger, 2 ozs. Cakes: flour, 1 lb.; butter, 6 ozs.; sugar, 8 ozs.; ginger, 1 oz.; 3 to 4 eggs ; rind of lemon. ISLE OF WIGHT DOUGH-NUTS. Work smoothly together with the fingers four ounces of good lard, and four pounds of flour, add half a pound of fine brown sugar, twTo tablespoonsful of allspice, one drachm of pounded cinnamon, half as much of cloves, two large blades of mace, beaten to powder, two table- spoonsful of fresh yeast which has been watered for one night, and which should be solid, and as much new milk as will make the whole into a rather firm dough; let this stand from an hour to an hour and a half near the fire, then knead it well, and make it into balls about the size of a small apple, hollow them with the thumb, and enclose a few currants in the middle, gather the paste well over them, and thro wt the dough-nuts into a saucepan half filled with boiling lard ; when they are equally coloured to a fine brown, lift them out and dry them before the fire on the back of a sieve. When made in large quantities, as they are at certain seasons in the island, they are drained upon very clean straw. The lard should boil only just before they are dropped into it, or the outsides will be scorched before the insides are sufficiently done.

Currants, at choice : dough-nuts boiled in lard, 5 to 7 minutes. CINNAMON, OR LEMON CAKES. Rub six ounces of good butter into a pound of fine dry flour, and -work it lightly into crumbs, then add three-quarters of a pound of sifted sugar, a dessertspoon- ful of pounded cinnamon (or half as much when only a slight flavour is liked), and make these ingredients into a firm paste with three eggs, or four, if needed. Roll it, not very thin, and cut out the cakes with a tin shape. Bake them in a very gentle oven from fifteen to twenty minutes, or longer, should they not be done quite through. As soon as they are cold, put them into a clean and dry tin-canister, a precaution w7hich should be observed with all small sugar cakes, which ought also to be loosened from the oven tins while they are still warm. Flour, 1 lb.; butter, 6 ozs.; sugar, f lb.; cinnamon, 1 dessertspoonful (more or less, to the taste); eggs, 3 to 4. Ohs.—Lemon cakes can be made by this receipt by substituting for the cinnamon the rasped or grated rinds of two lemons, and the strained juice of one, when its acidity is not objected to. More butter, and more or less of sugar can be used at will, both for these and for the cinnamon cakes. QUEEN CAKES. To make these, proceed exactly as for Sutherland puddings (see page 472), but allow ten eggs for the pound of sugar, butter, and flour, and when these are all well mixed, throw in half a teaspoonful of mace, and a pound of clean dry currants. Bake the cakes in small, well-buttered tin-pans (heart-shaped ones are usual), in a somewhat brisk oven, for about twenty minutes.fcHAP. XXIII. 620 MODERN COOKERY. A GOOD LIGHT BUN. Break quite small three ounces of good butter into a pound and a quarter of flour, stir into the middle of these a spoonful and a quarter of solid, well-purified yeast, mixed with something more than a quarter-pint of warm milk, and leave it to rise before, but not close to the fire, for an hour, or longer, should it not then appear extremely light. Add to three eggs, properly whisked, a few spoonsful of warm milk, strain and beat them to the bun ,* next, mix with it six ounces of pale brown sugar, six of well cleaned currants, and the grated rind of a small lemon, or some nutmeg, if preferred; or, in lieu of either, slice into it an ounce and a half of candied orange-rind. Let it again rise for an hour, then beat it up lightly with a wooden spoon, put it into a buttered pan, and bake in a brisk oven for nearly or quite an hour. An additional ounce of butter will improve it. Flour, 1^ lb.; yeasty lj tablespoonful: 1 hour, or more. Eggs, 3 ; milk, in all not \ pint; sugar, 6 ozs.; currants, 6 ozs.; lemon-grate, nutmeg, or candied orange- rind, at pleasure : 1 hour. Baked nearly or quite an hour, brisk oven. COCOA-NUT BISCUIT. {Excellent.) With a pound of flour mix three ounces of a sound fresh cocoa-nut, rasped on a fine grater ; make a leaven as for the bun in the foregoing receipt, with a large tablespoonful of good yeast, and about the third of a pint of warm new milk; let it stand for an hour, then strew over and mix well up with it four ounces of pounded sugar; next, dissolve two ounces of butter in a very little milk, cool it down with a few spoonsful of cold milk if needful, and pour it to a couple of well whisked eggs; with these wet the other ingredients into a very light dough, let it stand from three-quarters of an hour to an hour, and bake it about the same time in aCAKES. 621 CHAP. XXIII.] rather quick oven. Two ounces more of sugar, one of butter, and two of candied orange-rind, sliced thin, will convert this into a good cake, the cocoa-nut imparting great richness as well as flavour to the mixture: the proportion of this can also be regulated by the taste, after the first trial. Flour, 1 lb.; grated cocoa-nut, 3 ozs.; yeast, 1 large tablespoonful; milk, -J- of pint: 1 hour. Pounded sugar, 4 ozs.; butter, 2 ozs. ; eggs, 2 ; little milk : f to 1 hour. Or: sugar, 6 ozs.; butter, 3 ozs. ; candied orange-rind, 2 ozs.: baked nearly or quite an hour. THREADNEEDLE STREET BISCUITS. Mix with a couple of pounds of sifted flour of the very best quality, three ounces of good butter, and work it into the smallest possible crumbs; add four ounces of fine, dry, sifted sugar, and make them into a firm paste with new milk; beat this forcibly for some minutes with the rolling-pin, and when it is extremely smooth roll it the third of an inch thick, cut it with a small square cutter, and bake the biscuits in a very slow oven until they are crisp to the centre: no part of them should remain soft. Half a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda is said to improve them, but we have not put it to the test. Carraway-seeds can be added when liked. Flour, 2 lbs.; butter, 3 ozs. ; sugar, 4 ozs.; new milk, 1 pint or more : biscuits slowly baked till crisp. A GALETTE. The galette is a favourite cake in France, and may be made rich, and comparatively delicate, or quite common, by using more or less butter for it, and by augmenting or diminishing the size. Work lightly three-quarters of a pound of good butter into a pound of flour, add a large saltspoonful of salt, and make these into a paste with the yolks of a couple of eggs mixed with a small cup of good cream, should it be at hand; if not, with water; roll this into a complete round, three-quarters of an inch thick ; score it in small diamonds, brush yolk€22 MODERN COOKERY.

An ounce of sifted sugar is sometimes added to it. A good galette: flour, 1 lb.; salt, 1 saltspoonful; yolks of eggs, 2 ; cream, small cupful: baked -J hour. Common galette: flour, 2 lbs.; butter, | to 1 lb.; no eggs. CORNISH HEAVY CAKE. Mix with a pound and a half of flour, ten ounces of well-cleaned currants, and a small teaspoonful of salt; make these into a smooth paste with clotted cream (any which is very thick will do), roll the cake till it is an inch and a quarter in depth, and bake it thoroughly in a quick oven, after having scored the top. Flour, 1-J lb.; currants, 10 ozs. ; salt, small teaspoon- ful; clotted, or very thick cream, J to full pint: 35 to 45 minutes, brisk oven. FLEED OR FLEAD CAKES. These are very much served as a tea-cake at the tables of the superior order of Kentish farmers. For the mode of making them, proceed as for flead-crust (see Chapter XYI.); cut the cakes small with a round cutter, and leave them more than half an inch thick; if well-made they will rise much in the oven. Bake them quickly. Flour, 2 lbs.; flead, 1J lb.; butter, 6 ozs.: baked 10 to 15 minutes. CHAPTER XXIY. CONFECTIONARY. TO CLARIFY SUGAR. It is an economy to use at once the very best sugar for confectionary in general, for when highly refined it needs623 CHAP. XXIV.] CONFECTIONARY. little or no clarifying, even for the most delicate pur- poses ; and the coarser kinds lose considerable weight in the process. Break it into large lumps, and put it into a very clean preserving pan ; measure for each pound a pint of spring water if it be intended for syrup, but less than half that quantity forjcandying or making barley- sugar. Beat first apart (but not to a strong froth), and afterwards with the water, about half the white of an egg for six pounds of sugar, unless it should be very common, when twice as much may be used. When they are well mixed pour them over the sugar, and let it stand until it is nearly dissolved; then stir the whole thoroughly, and place it over a gentle fire, but do not disturb it after the scum begins to gather on the top; let it boil for five minutes, then take the pan from the fire, and when it has stood a couple of minutes clear off the scum entirely, with a skimmer; set the pan again over the fire, and when the sugar begins to boil throw in a little cold water, which has been reserved for the purpose from the quantity first measured, and repeat the skimming until the syrup is very clear; it may then be strained through a muslin, or a thin cloth, and put into a clean pan for further boiling. For syrup: sugar, 6 lbs.; water, 3 quarts ; \ white of 1 egg. For candying, &c.: sugar, 6 lbs.; water, 2| pints : 5 to 10 minutes. TO BOIL SUGAR FROM SYRUP TO CANDY, OR TO CARAMEL. The technicalities by which confectioners distinguish the different degrees of sugar-boiling, seem to us calculated rather to puzzle than to assist the reader; and we shall, therefore, confine ourselves to such plain English terms as may suffice, we hope, to explain them. After having boiled a certain time, the length of which will in a measure depend upon the quality of the sugar as well as the quantity of water added, it be- comes a thin syrup, and it will scarcely form a short thread if a drop be pressed between the thumb and finger and they are then drawn apart; from five to624 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XXIY. ten minutes more of rapid boiling will bring it to a thick syrup, and when this degree is reached the thread may be drawn from one hand to the other at some length without breaking ; but its appearance in dropping from the skimmer will perhaps best denote its being at this point, as it hangs in a sort of string as it falls. After this the sugar will soon begin to whiten, and to form large bubbles in the pan, when, if it be intended for barley-sugar, or caramel, some lemon-juice or other acid must be added to it, to prevent its graining or be- coming sugar again ; but if wanted to candy, it must be stirred without ceasing until it rises almost to the top of the pan, in one large white mass, when it must be used immediately or ladled out into paper cases or on to dishes, with the utmost expedition, as it passes in an instant almost from this state to one in which it forms a sort of powder, which will render it necessary to add water, to stir it until dissolved, and to re-boil it to the proper point. For barley-sugar likewise it must be constantly stirred, and carefully watched after the lemon-juice is added. A small quantity should be dropped from time to time into a large basin of cold water by those who are inexperienced in the process; when in falling into this it makes a bubbling noise, and if taken out immediately after snaps clean between the teeth without sticking to them it must be poured out instantly: if wanted for sugar-spinning, the pan must be plunged as quickly as possible into a vessel of cold water. BA.RLEY SUGAR. Add to three pounds of highly-refined sugar one pint and a quarter of spring water, with sufficient white of egg to clarify it in the manner directed in the last receipt but one ; pour to it, when it begins to whiten and to be very thick, a dessertspoonful of the strained juice of a fresh lemon ; and boil it quickly till it is at the point which we have indicated above. A few drops of essence of lemon may be added to it,CHAP. XXIV.] CONFECTIONARY. 625 just as it is taken from the fire. Pour it on to a marble slab, or on to a shallow dish which has been slightly oiled, or rubbed with a morsel of fresh butter; and when it begins to harden at the edges form it into sticks, lozenges, balls, or any other shapes at pleasure. While it is still liquid it may be used for various purposes, such as Chantilly baskets, palace bonbons, des croques- m-bouches * cerises au caramel, &c. : for these the vessel containing it must be set into a pan of water, and it must again be liquified with a very gentle de- gree of heat should it cool too quickly. As it soon dissolves if exposed to damp, it should be put into very dry canisters as soon as it is cold, and these should be kept in a dry place. Best sugar, 3 lbs.; water, lj pint; white of egg, 4th of 1 ; lemon-juice, 1 dessertspoonful. GINGER CANDY. Break a pound of highly-refined sugar into lumps, put it into a preserving pan, and pour over it about the third of a pint of spring water; let it stand until the sugar is nearly dissolved, then set it over a perfectly clear fire, and boil it until it becomes a thin syrup. Have ready in a large cup a teaspoonful of the very best ginger in powder, mix it smoothly and gradually with two or three spoonsful of the syrup, and then stir it well into the whole. Watch the mixture carefully, keep it stirred, and drop it often from a spoon to as- certain the exact point of boiling it has reached. When it begins to fall in flakes throw in the freshly-grated rind of a very large lemon, or of two small ones, and work the sugar round quickly as it is added. The candy must now be stirred constantly until it is done : this will be, when it falls in a mass from the spoon, and does not sink when placed in a small heap on a * These are formed of small cakes, roast chestnuts, and various other things, just dipped singly into the barley-sugar, and then arranged in good form and joined in a mould, from which they are turned out for table.626 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XXIV* dish. It must be poured, or laded out, as expedi- tiously as possible when ready, or it will fall quite into powder. If this should happen, a little water must be added to it, and it must be re-boiled to the proper point. The candy, if dropped in cakes upon cold dishes, may be moved off without difficulty before it is thoroughly cold, but must not be touched while quite hot or it will break. Sugar, highly-refined, 1 lb. ; water, one-third of a pint; ginger, 1 teaspoonful; rind of 1 large lemon. ORANGE-FLOWER CANDY. Beat in three-quarters of a pint or rather more, of water, about the fourth part of the white of an egg; and pour it on two pounds of the best sugar broken into lumps. When it has stood a little time, place it over a very clear fire, and let it boil for a few minutes, then set it on one side, until the scum has subsided ; clear it off, and boil the sugar till it is very thick, then strew in by degrees three ounces of the 'petals of the orange-blossom, weighed after they are picked from their stems. Con- tinue to stir the candy until it rises in one white mass in the pan, then pour it into small paper cases, or on to dishes, and follow for it precisely the same directions as are given for the ginger-candy in the preceding receipt. The orange-flowers will turn brown if thrown too soon into the syrup: it should be more than three-parts boiled when they are added. They must be gathered on the day they are wanted for use, as they become soon discoloured from keeping. Sugar, 2 lbs. ; water, j pint; J white of egg; orange-blossoms, 3 ozs.

PALACE-BONBONS. Take some fine fresh candied orange or lemon peel, take off the sugar that adheres to it, cut it into inch- squares, stick these singly on the prong of a silver fork, or on osier-twigs, dip them into liquid barley sugar, and place them on a dish rubbed with the smallest possible quantity of very pure salad oil. When cold, put them into tin boxes or canisters well dried, with paper between each layer. EYERTON TOFFIE. Put into a brass skillet, if at hand, three ounces of very fresh butter, and as soon as it is just melted, add a pound of brown sugar of moderate quality ; keep these stirred gently over a very clear fire for about fifteen minutes, or until a little of the mixture dropped into a basin of cold water, breaks clean between the teeth without sticking to them : when it is boiled to this point, it must be poured out immediately, or it will burn. The grated rind of a lemon, added when the toffie is half done, improves it much ; or a small tea- spoonful of powdered ginger, moistened with a little of the other ingredients, as soon as the sugar is dissolved, and then stirred to the whole, will vary it pleasantly to many tastes. The real Everton toffie is made, we ap- prehend, with a much larger proportion of butter, but it is the less wholesome on that very account. If dropped upon dishes first rubbed with a buttered paper, the toffie when cold can be raised from them easily. Butter, 3 ozs.; sugar, 1 lb.: 15 to 18 minutes. TOFFIE. (ANOTHER WAY.) Boil together a pound of sugar and five ounces of butter for twenty minutes; then stir in two ounces of[CHAP. XXY. 628 MODERN COOKERY. almonds blanched, divided, and thoroughly dried in a slow oven, or before the fire. Let the toffie boil after they are added, till it crackles when dropped into cold water, and snaps between the teeth without sticking. Sugar, 1 lb.; butter, 5 ozs.; almonds, 2 ozs.: 20 to 30 minutes. CHAPTER XXY. DESSERT- DISHES. / MELANGE OF FRUIT. Heap a dessert-dish quite high with alternate layers of fine fresh strawberries stripped from the stalks, white and red currants, and white or red raspberries ; strew each layer plentifully with sifted sugar, and just before the dish is sent to table, pour equally over the top a glass and a half of brandy, or, if preferred, the same quantity or rather more of white wine, mixed with the strained juice of one small, or of half a large lemon. Currants by themselves are excellent prepared in this way, and strawberries also. The fruit should be gently stirred with a spoon when it is served. Each variety must be picked with great nicety from the stalks. The brandy would, we think, be less to the general taste in this country than the wine. / FRUIT EN CHEMISE, OR PERLE. Select for this dish very fine bunches of red and white currants, large ripe cherries, and gooseberries of different colours, and strawberries or raspberries very freshly gathered. Beat up the white of an egg with about half as much cold water, dip the fruit into this mixture, drain it on a sieve for an instant, and then roll it in fine sifted sugar till it is covered in every part ;DESSERT-DISHES. 629 CHAP. XXV.] give it a gentle shake, and lay it on sheets of white paper to dry. In England, thin gum-water is some- times used, we believe, for this dish, instead of the white of egg; we give, howTever, the French method of pre- paring it. It will dry gradually in a warm room, or a sunny window, in the course of three or four hours. PEACH SALAD. Pare and slice half a dozen fine ripe peaches, arrange them in a dish, strew them with pounded sugar, and pour over them two or three glasses of champagne: other wine may be used, but this is best. Persons who I prefer brandy can substitute it for wine. The quantity of sugar must be proportioned to the sweetness of the fruit. ORANGE SALAD. Take off the outer rinds, and then strip away entirely the white inside skin from some fine China oranges; slice them thin, and remove the pips as this is done ; strew over them plenty of white sifted sugar, and pour on them a glass or more of brandy: when the sugar is dissolved serve the oranges. In France ripe pears of superior quality are sometimes sliced in with the oranges. Powdered sugar-candy used instead of sugar, is an im- provement in this salad; and the substitution of port, sherry, or Madeira for the brandy is often considered so. The fruit may be used without being pared, and a little cuirasseau or any other liqueur may be added to the brandy; or this last, when unmixed, may be burned after it is poured on the oranges. COMPOTE OF ORANGES. (A Hebrew dish.) After having pared and stripped the white inner rind from some fine oranges, pull them into quarters, arrange them neatly in a dish, and just before they are sent to table pour over them some rich syrup, and garnish the whole tastefully with preserved citron cut in thin slices.MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XXV. 630 Half a pint of syrup will be sufficient for a large number of oranges; it would be improved, we think, if the rind of one pared very thin were infused in it for an hour before it is used. This is one of the receipts which we have not considered it needful to prove. ORANGES WARMED. Place them in a Dutch oven at a considerable distance from the fire, and keep them constantly turned : they should only be just warmed through. Fold them in a napkin when done, and send them immediately to table. This mode of treating them is said to improve greatly the flavour of the oranges. BLACK CAPS PAR EXCELLENCE. Cut a dozen fine Norfolk biffins in two without paring them, scoop out the cores, and fill the cavities with thin strips of fresh lemon-rind and with candied orange-peel. Cover the bottom of a flat shallow tin with a thick layer of fine pale brown sugar, press the two halves of each apple together, and place them closely in the tin ; pour half a bottle of raisin or of any other sweet wine over them, and be careful to moisten the tops of all; sift white sugar thickly on them, and set the tin into a very hot oven at first, that the outsides of the apples may catch or become black ; then draw them to the mouth of the oven, and bake them gently till they are soft quite through : they will resemble a rich sweetmeat when done, and will remain good for many days. The Norfolk biffin answers for this dish far better than any other kind of apple, but the winter queening, and some few firm sorts beside, can be used for it with fair success. These for variety may be cored without being divided, and filled with orange marmalade. The black caps served hot, as a second course dish, are excellent.

XXV.] 631 DESSERT-DISHES. lb.; raisin or other wine, J bottle; little sifted sugar : f to 1 hour or more. NORMANDY PIPPINS. To one pound of the apples, put one quart of water and six ounces of sugar; let them simmer gently for three hours, or more should they not be perfectly tender. A few strips of fresh lemon-peel and a very few cloves are by some persons considered agreeable additions to the syrup. Dried Normandy pippins, 1 lb.; water, 1 quart; sugar, 6 ozs. : 3 to 4 hours. Obs,—These pippins, if stewed with care, will be converted into a rich confection: they may be served hot in a border of rice, as a second course dish. STEWED PRUNEAUX DE TOURS, OR TOURS DRIED PLUMS. These plums, which resemble in form small dried Is 'rfolk biffins, make a delicious compote: they are also excellent served dry. In France they are stewed till tender in equal parts of water, and of the light red wine of the country, with about four ounces of sugar to the pound of fruit: when port wine is used for them a smaller proportion of it will suffice. The sugar should not be added in stewing any dried fruits until they are at least half-done, as they will not soften by any means so easily in syrup as in unsweetened liquid. Dried plums, 1 lb.; water, J pint, and light claret, \ pint, or water, j pint, and port wine, \ pint: 1 \ hour. Sugar, 4 ozs. : 1 hour or more. Obs.—Common French plums are stewed in the same way with or without wine. A little experience will teach the cook the exact quantity of liquid and of sugar which they require. BAKED COMPOTE OF APPLES. {Oar little ladys receipt.) Put into a wide Nottingham jar, with a cover, two quarts of golden pippins, or of the small apple whichMODERN COOKERY. 632 [CHAP. XXY. resembles them in appearance, called the orange pippin (this is very plentiful in the county of Kent), pared and cored, but without being divided ; strew amongst them some small strips of very thin fresh lemon-rind, and throw on them, nearly at the top, half a pound of very good Lisbon sugar, and set the jar, with the cover tied on, for some hours, or for a night, into a very slow oven. The apples will be extremely good, if not too quickly baked: they should remain entire, but be perfectly tender, and clear in appearance. Add a little lemon- juice when the season is far advanced. Apples, 2 quarts; rind, quite small lemon; sugar ^ lb.: 1 night in slow oven ; or some hours baking in a very gentle one. Obs.—These apples may be served hot or cold for a second course dish; or they will answer admirably ta fill Gabrielles pudding. TO BAKE PEARS. Wipe some large sound iron pears, arrange them on a dish with the stalk end upwards, put them into the oven after the bread is drawn, and let them remain all night. If well baked, they will be excellent, very sweet, and juicy, and much finer in flavour than those which are stewed or baked with sugar : the bon chretien pear also is delicious baked thus. STEWED PEARS. Pare, cut in halves, and core a dozen fine iron pears, put them into a close shutting stewpan with some thin strips of lemon-rind, half a pound of sugar, in lumps, as much water as will nearly cover them, and should a very bright colour be desired, a dozen grains of cochineal, bruised, and tied in a muslin; stew the fruit as gently as possible, from four to six hours, or longer, should it not be very tender. The Chaumontel pear, which some- times falls in large quantities before it is ripe, is excel- lent, if first baked until tolerably tender, and then stewed in a thin syrup.CHAP. XXVI.3 SYRUPS, LIQUEURS, &C. 633 BOILED CHESTNUTS. Make a slight incision in the outer skin only of each chestnut, to prevent its bursting, and when all are done, throw them into plenty of boiling water, with about a dessertspoonful of salt to the half gallon. Some chest- nuts will require to be boiled nearly or quite an hour, others little more than half the time; the cook should try them occasionally, and as soon as they are soft through, drain then, wipe them in a coarse cloth, and send them to table quickly in a hot napkin. ROAST CHESTNUTS. The best mode of preparing these is to roast them, as in Spain, in a coffee-roaster, after having first boiled them from five to seven minutes, and wiped them dry. They should not be allowed to cool, and will require but from ten to fifteen minutes* roasting. They may, when more convenient, be finished over the fire as usual, or in a Dutch, or common oven, but in all cases the previous boiling will be found an improvement. Never omit to cut the rind of each nut slightly before it is cooked. Serve the chestnuts very hot in a napkin, and send salt to table with them. CHAPTER XXVI. SYRUPS, LIQUEURS, &c. STRAWBERRY VINEGAR, OF DELICIOUS FLAVOUR. Take the stalks from the fruit, which should be of a highly flavoured sort, quite ripe, fresh from the beds, and gathered in dry weather ; weigh and put it into large glass jars, or wide-necked bottles, and to each pound pour about a pint and a half of fine pale whiteMODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XXVI. 634. wine vinegar, which will answer the purpose better than the entirely colourless kind sold under the name of distilled vinegar, but which is, we believe, the pyro- ligneous acid greatly diluted. Tie a thick paper over them, and let. the strawberries remain from three to four day's ; then pour oft’ the vinegar and empty them into a jelly-bag, or suspend them in a cloth that all the liquid may drop from them without pressure ; replace them with an equal weight of fresh fruit, pour the vinegar upon it, and three days afterwards repeat the same process, diminishing a little the proportion of strawberries, of which the flavour ought ultimately to overpower that of the vinegar. In from two to four days drain off the liquid very closely, and after having strained it through a linen or a flannel bag, weigh it, and mix with it an equal quantity of highly-refined sugar roughly pow- dered ; when this is nearly dissolved, stir the syrup over a very clear fire until it has boiled five minutes, and skim it thoroughly ; pour it into a delicately clean stone pitcher, or into large china jugs, throw a folded cloth over and let it remain until the morrow ; put it into pint or half-pint bottles, aud cork them lightly with new velvet corks; for if these be pressed in tightly at first, the bottles would be liable to burst: in four or five days they may be closely corked, and stored in a dry and cool place. Damp destroys the colour and injures the flavour of these fine fruit-vinegars ; of which a spoon- ful or two in a glass of water affords so agreeable a summer beverage, and one which, in many cases of ill- ness, is so acceptable to invalids. They make also most admirable sauces for Her Majesty’s pudding, common custard, batter, and various other simple and sweet light puddings. Strawberries (stalked), 4 lbs.; vinegar, 3 quarts: 3 to 4 days. Vinegar drained and poured on fresh strawberries, 4 lbs.: 3 days. Drained again on to fresh fruit, 3 to 4 lbs.: 2 to 4 days. To each pound of the vinegar, 1 lb. of highly refined sugar: boiled 5 minutes. Lightly corked, 4 or 5 days.CHAP. XXVI.] SYRUPS, LIQUEURS, ETC. 635 Obs. — Where there is a garden the fruit may be thrown into the vinegar as it ripens, within an interval of forty-eight hours, instead of being all put to infuse at once, and it must then remain in it a proportionate time: one or two days in addition to that specified, will make no difference to the preparation. The enamelled German stewpans are the best possible vessels to boil it in ; but it may be simmered in a stone jar set into a pan of boiling water when there is nothing more appropriate at hand ; though the syrup does not usually keep so well when this last method is adopted. Raspberries and strawberries mixed will make a vinegar of very pleasant flavour; black currants also will afford an exceedingly useful syrup of the same kind. STRAWBERRY ACID ROYAL. Dissolve in a quart of spring water two ounces of citric acid, and pour it on as many quite ripe and richly-flavoured strawberries, stripped from their stalks, as it will just cover; in twenty-four hours drain the liquid closely from the fruit, and pour on it as much more; keep it in a cool place, and the next day drain it again entirely from the fruit, and boil it gently for three or four minutes, with its weight of very fine sugar, which should be dissolved in it before it is placed over the fire. It should be boiled, if possible, in an enamelled stewpan. When perfectly cold put it into small dry bottles for use, and store it in a cool but not damp place. It is one of the most delicate and deliciously flavoured preparations possible, and of beautiful colour. If allowed to remain longer than the eight and forty hours before it is boiled* a brisk fer- mentation will commence. It must be well secured from the air when stored. Water, 1 quart; citric acid, 2 ozs.; strawberries, 2 to 3 lbs.: 24 hours. Same quantity of fruit: 24modern COOKERY. [CHAP. XXYI. 6 36- hours. Equal weight of sugar and this liquid : 3 to 4 minutes at the utmost. VERY FINE RASPBERRY VINEGAR. Fill glass jars, or large wide-necked bottles, with very ripe but perfectly sound, freshly-gathered rasp- berries, freed from their stalks, and cover them with pale white wine vinegar: they may be left to infuse from a week to ten days without injury, or the vinegar may be poured from them in four or five, when more convenient. After it is drained off, turn the fruit into a sieve placed over a deep dish or bowl, as the juice will flow slowly from it for many hours ; put fresh raspberries into the bottles, and pour the vinegar back upon them ; two or three days later change the fruit again, and when it has stood the same space of time, drain the whole of the vinegar from it, pass it through a jelly-bag, or thick linen cloth, and boil it gently for four or five minutes with its weight of good sugar roughly powdered, or a pound and a quarter to the exact pint, and be very careful to remove the scum en- tirely, as it rises. On the following day bottle the syrup, observing the directions which we have given for the strawberry vinegar. When the fruit is scarce it may be changed twice only, and left a few days longer in the vinegar. Raspberries, 6 lbs.; vinegar, 9 pints : 7 to 10 days. Vinegar drained on to fresh raspberries (6 lbs. of): 3 to 5 days. Poured again on fresh raspberries, 6 lbs.: 3 to 5 days. Boiled 5 minutes with its weight of sugar. Obs.—When the process of sugar-boiling is well understood, it will be found an improvement to boil that which is used for raspberry or strawberry vinegar to candy-height before the liquid is mixed with it; all the scum may then be removed with a couple of minutes’ simmering, and the flavour of the fruit will be more perfectly preserved. For more particular di- rections as to the mode of proceeding, the chapter of confectionary may be consulted.6:37 CHAP. XXVI.] SYRUPS, LIQUEURS, ETC. water, 2 quarts: J hour. Capillaire, 1 bottle; white ORANGE-FLOWER RATIFIA. A Delicious Liqueur. Boil to a thick syrup a pound and a quarter of highly refined sugar, and three-quarters of a pint of water ; throw into it three ounces of the petals only, plucked one by one from the stem, of some freshly gathered orange-blossoms, give them two minutes’ boil, take them from the fire, and when the whole is half cold stir in two bottles of white French brandy ; turn the mixture into a new and well-scalded stone pitcher, or jar, make it air-tight as soon as the liqueur is quite cold, and in from three to four weeks it will be ready to bottle after the flowers have been strained from it: they give it a delicious flavour.

Extract the essence from the rinds of three lemons by rubbing them with sugar in lumps; put these into a large jug with the peel of two Seville oranges and of two lemons cut extremely thin, the juice of four Seville oranges and of ten lemons, and six glasses of calf’s foot jelly in a liquid state. Stir these well together, pour to them two quarts of boiling water, cover the jug closely, and set it near the fire for a quarter of an hour, then strain the mixture through a sieve into a punch bowl or jug, sweeten it with a bottle of capillaire, add half a pint of white wine, a pint of French brandy, a pint of Jamaica rum, and a bottle of orange shrub ; stir the punch as the spirits are poured in. If not sufficiently sweet, add sugar in small quantities, or a spoonful or two of capillaire.

OXFORD RECEIPT FOR BISHOP. “ Make several incisions in the rind of a lemon,* stick cloves in these, and roast the lemon by a slow fire. Put small but equal quantities of cinnamon, cloves, mace, and allspice, with a race of ginger, into a sauce- pan with half a pint of water; let it boil till it is reduced one half. Boil one bottle of port wine, burn a portion of the spirit out of it by applying a lighted paper to the saucepaif. Put the roasted lemons and spice into the wine; stir it up well, and let it stand near the fire ten minutes. Rub a few knobs of sugar on the rind of a lemon, put the sugar into a bowl or jug, with the juice of half a lemon (not roasted), pour the wine into it, grate in some nutmeg, sweeten it to your taste, and serve it up with the lemon and spice floating in it.” TO MULL WINE. (An Excellent French Receipt.) Boil in a wineglassful and a half of water a quarter of an ounce of spice (cinnamon, ginger slightly bruised, and cloves), with three ounces of fine sugar, till they form a thick syrup, which must not on any account be allowed to burn. Pour in a pint of port wine, and stir it gently till it is on the point of boiling only : it should then be served immediately. The ad- dition of a strip or two of orange-rind cut extremely thin, gives to this beverage the flavour of bishop. In France light claret takes the place of port-wine in making it, and the better kinds of Vins du Pays are very palatable thus prepared. Water, \ \ wineglassful; spice, ^oz., of which fine cloves, 24, and of remainder, rather more ginger than cinnamon; sugar, 3 ozs.: 15 to 20 minutes.

Put into a large bowl half a pound of sugar broken small, and pour on it the strained juice of a couple of fresh lemons, stir these well together, and add to them a pint of port wine, a pint of sherry, and half a pint of brandy ; grate in a fine nutmeg, place the bowl under the cow, and milk it full. In serving it put a portion of the curd into each glass, fill it up with whey, and pour a little rich cream on the top. The rind of a lemon may be rasped with part of the sugar when the flavour is approved, but it is not usually added. Juice of lemons, 2; sugar, |db. or more; port- wine, 1 pint; sherry, 1 pint; brandy £ pint; nutmeg, 1 ; milk from the cow, 2 quarts. Obs.—We can testify to the excellence of this receipt. CUIRASSEAU, OR CURA^OA. (An excellent and wholesome Liqueur.) Stick into the rind of a very fine China orange of rich flavour from three to four cloves ; put it into a glass jar, and shower over it half a pound of good West Indian sugar, not very brown ; pour in a quart of French brandy ; tie a couple of bladders over the jar, or stop it with a cork fitted to its size, and place it in a sunny window, or any other warm place, for a month ; shake it gently round every day to dissolve the sugar, or stir it, if needful; then strain it off, and bottle it. It is sometimes filtered ; but the long ex- posure to the air which this occasions is better avoided. It is an admirable household stomachic liqueur, of which we obtained the receipt abroad, from a friend who had it made yearly in considerable quantity. 1 very fine richly flavoured China orange, left whole (or two small ones), stuck with 3 or 4 cloves ;640 MODERN COOKERY.

Pare as thin as possible the rinds of two China oranges, of two lemons, and of one Seville orange, and infuse them for an hour in half a pint of thin cold syrup ; then add to them the juice of the fruit. Make a pint of strong green tea, sweeten it well with fine sugar, and, when it is quite cold, add it to the fruit and syrup, with a glass of the best old Jamaica rum, a glass of brandy, one of arrack, one of pine apple syrup, and two bottles of champagne ; pass the whole through a fine lawn sieve until it is perfectly clear, then bottle, and put it into ice until dinner is served. We are indebted for this receipt to a person who made the punch daily for the prince’s table, at Carlton palace, for six months ; it has been in our possession some years, and may be relied on.

Put into one half pint tumbler the very thin rind of a fresh lemon, and fill it with boiling water ; squeeze the juice into a second glass of the same size, and fill it nearly to the brim with sugar in lumps; then pour in as much boiling water as it will contain, and when the sugar is dissolved, turn the contents of both glasses into a hot jug ; add a tablespoonful of fine currant (or of guava) jelly, should it be at hand; stir the whole well, keep it very hot, and add to it as much spirit as will make it pleasant, but in the proportion of two glasses of brandy to one of rum.CHAP. XXVI.] SYRUPS, LIQUEURS, ETC. 641 MINT JULEP. (.An American Receipt.) “ Strip the tender leaves of mint into a tumbler, and add to them as much wine, brandy, or any other spirit, as you wish to take. Put some pounded ice into a second tumbler; pour this on the mint and brandy, and continue to pour the mixture from one tumbler to the other until the whole is sufficiently impregnated with the flavour of the mint, which is extracted by the particles of ice coming into brisk contact when changed from one vessel to the other. Now place the glass in a larger one, containing pounded ice : on taking it out of which it will be covered with frost-work.” DELICIOUS MILK LEMONADE. Dissolve six ounces of loaf sugar in a pint of boiling water, and mix with them a quarter-pint of lemon- juice, and the same quantity of sherry ; then add three quarters of a pint of cold milk, stir the whole well to- gether, and pass it through a jelly-bag till clear. EXCELLENT PORTABLE LEMONADE. Rasp, with a quarter-pound of sugar, the rind of a very fine juicy lemon, reduce it to powder, mid pour on it the strained juice of the fruit. Press the mix- ture into a jar, and when wanted for use dissolve a tablespoonful of it in a glass of water. It^vill keep a considerable time. If too sweet for the laste of the drinker, a very small portion of citric acid may be added when it is taken. EXCELLENT BARLEY WATER. (Poor Xury's Receipt.) Wipe very clean, by rolling it in a soft cloth, two tablespoonsful of pearl-barley ; put it into a quart jug, with a lump or two of sugar, a grain or two of salt, and a strip of lemon peel, cut thin ; fill up the jug with boiling water and keep the mixture gently stirred for some mi- T T i642 MODERN COOKERY. ^CIIAP.

If these directions be followed, the barley-water will be comparatively clear, and very soft and pleasant to drink. A glass of calf’s feet jelly added to the barley is an infinite improve- ment; but as lemon rind is often extremely unpalatr able to invalids, their taste should be consulted before that ingredient is added, as it should be also for the degree of sweetness that is desired. After the barley- water has been poured off once, the jug may be filled a second time with boiling water, and even a third time with advantage. RAISIN WINE. {Which, if long kept, really resembles foreign.) First boil the water which is to be used for the wine, and let it again become perfectly cold; then put into a sound sweet cask eight pounds of fine Malaga raisins for each gallon that is to be used, taking out only the quite large stalks; the fruit and water may be put in alternately until the cask is full, the raisins being well pressed down in it; lay the bung lightly over, stir the wine ev^ry day or two, and keep it full by the addition of water that has, like the first, been boiled, but which must always be quite cold when it is used. So soon as the fermentation has entirely ceased, which may be in from six to seven weeks, press in the bung, and leave the wine untouched for twelve months ; draw it off then into ajplean cask, and fine it, if necessary, with isinglass, tied in a muslin and suspended in it. We have not ourselves had this receipt tried ; but we have tasted wine made by it which had been five years kept, and which so much resembled a rich foreign wine that we could with difficulty believe it was English made. To each gallon of water (boiled and left till cold) 8 lbs. of fine Malaga raisins ; to stand 12 months ; then to be drawn off and fined. Obs.—The refuse raisins make admirable vinegar if643 SYRUPS, LIQUEURS, ETC. CHAP. XXVI,] fresh water be poured to them, and the cask placed in the sun. March is the best time for making this wine. EXCELLENT ELDERBERRY WINE. Strip the berries, which should be fresh, and gathered on a dry day, clean from the stalks, and measure them into a tub or large earthen pan. Pour boiling water on them, in the proportion of two gallons to three of berries, press them down into the liquor, cover them closely, and let them remain until the following day ; then strain the juice from the fruit through a sieve or cloth, and, when this is done, squeeze from the berries the greater part of the remaining juice, mix it with that which was first poured off, measure the whole, add to it three pounds of sugar, three quarters of an ounce of cloves, and one ounce of ginger, for every gallon, and boil it twenty minutes, keeping it thoroughly skimmed. Put it, when something more than milk-warm, into a perfectly dry and sweet cask (or if but a very small quantity of wine be made, into large stone bottles, which answer the purpose quite well), fill this entirely, and set the wine directly, with a large spoonful of new yeast dropped into the bung-hole, and just stirred round in the liquor, or with a small toasted crust thickly spread with yeast.* VERY GOOD GINGER WINE. Boil together, for half an hour, fourteen quarts of water, twelve pounds of sugar, a quarter of a pound of the best ginger bruised, and the thin rinds of six large lemons. Put the whole, when milk-warm, into a clean dry cask, with the juice of the lemons, and half a pound of sun raisins; add one large spoonful of thick yeast, and stir the wine every day for ten days. When it has ceased to ferment, add an ounce of isinglass, and a pint of brandy ; bung the wine close, and in two * In from fourteen to twenty days this wine will have fer- mented sufficiently : in three months it will be ready to drink.

Take half a chest of Seville oranges, pare off the rinds as thin as possible, put two thirds of them into six gallons of water, and let them remain for twenty- four hours. Squeeze the oranges (which ought to yield seven or eight quarts of juice), through a sieve, into a pan, and as they are done throw them into six gallons more of water ; let them be washed well in it with the hands, and then put into another six gallons of water and left till the following day. For each gal- lon of wine, put into the cask three pounds and a quarter of loaf sugar, and the liquor strained clear from the rinds and pulp. Wash these again and again, should more liquor be required to fill the cask ; but do not at any time add raw water. Stir the wine daily until the sugar is perfectly dissolved, and let it ferment from four to five weeks; add to it two bottles of brandy, stop it down, and in twelve months it will be fit to bottle. Ohs.—The excellence of all wine depends so much upon the fermentation being properly conducted, that unless the mode of regulating this be understood by the maker, there will always be great danger of failure in the operation. There is, we believe, an excellent work upon the subject by Dr. McCulloch, which the reader who needs information upon it will do well to consult : our own experience is too slight to enable us to multiply our receipts.CHAP.

This can be done in very small quantities by means of the inexpensive apparatus shown above ; the cost of this not exceeding seven or eight shillings,* and the supply of charcoal needed for it being very trifling indeed.

When it is of a fine, light, equal brown, which must be ascertained, till some little expe- rience has been acquired, by sliding back the door of the cylinder, and looking at it occasionally towards the end of the process, spread it quickly upon a large dish, and throw a folded cloth over it. Let it remain thus until it is quite cold ; then put it into canisters or bottles, and exclude the air carefully from it. Mr. Webster, in his admirable Encyclopaedia of Domestic Economy,* says, “ Mr. Donovan recommends, that, instead of roasting the coffee in an atmosphere of its own steam, it should first be dried in an iron pan, over a very gentle fire, being constantly stirred until the colour becomes yellow ; it is then to be pounded into coarse fragments, by no means too fine, each grain being divided into four or five parts only : it is then to be transferred to the roaster, and scorched to the proper degree. ” This plan we have not tried, because we have found the other to answer quite well; though Mr. Donovan’s might nevertheless prove a very supe- rior one. A roaster of the form shown here may be purchased for about fourteen shillings. * (Longman and Co.) This work contains much useful and valuable information on an infinity of subjects connected with Domestic Economy.647 CHAP. XXVII.] COFFEE, CHOCOLATE, &C. TO MAKE COFFEE. It is more usual at the present day to filter than to boil coffee; but many persons still prefer the latter mode. The degree j of strength which | is to be given must of course depend on the taste of those for whom it is prepared; but it should always be good when served to strangers, as a preference for weak coffee is very rare, and in a vast many instances it would be peculi- arly disagreeable Patent Percolator with Spirit Lamp, to the drinkers, more especially so to those who have resided much abroad, where this beverage is in general much better prepared than it is in England. An ounce of the berries, if recently roasted, and ground at the instant of usng them, will make, with the addition of a pint of water, two breakfast cupsful of sufficiently good coffee for common family-use. It will be stronger if slowly filtered in what is called a percolator, or coffee-biggin, than if it be boiled. Press the powder closely down, measure the proper quan- tity of water into a common coffee-pot, or small kettle, pour in sufficient to just wet the coffee in the first intance, and then add the remainder slowly, keeping the water boiling all the time. Let it run quite through before the top of the percolater is lifted off, and serve it very hot with boiling milk or cream, or with both, or with boiling milk and cold cream. The proportion of coffee, after the first trial, can easily be increased orG 48 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XXVII. diminished at will. To make French breakfast-coffee, pour only a third as much of water on the powder, fill the cups two thirds with good new boiling milk, then add the coffee, which should be very strong. For the cafe noir served after dinner in all French families put less water still (this is the very essence of coffee, of which, however, not more than a small cup about two-thirds filled, and highly sweetened with sugar in lumps, is generally taken by each person), and serve it without cream or milk, or any accompaniment, except white sugar-candy im powder, or highly refined sugar in lumps. This is drank immediately after the dinner, in families of moderate rank, generally before they leave the table ; in more refined life, it is served in the draw- ing-room the instant dinner is ended ; sometimes with liqueurs after it, but not invariably. To boil coffee and refine it: put the necessary quan- tity of water into a pot which it will not fill by some inches; when it boils stir in the coffee ; for unless this is at once moistened, it remains on the top and is liable to fly over. Give it one or two strong boils, then raise it from the fire, and simmer it for ten mi- nutes only ; pour out a large cupful twice, hold it high over the coffee pot and pour it in again, then set it on the hob for ten minutes longer. It will be perfectly clear, unless mismanaged, without any other fining. Should more, however, be deemed necessary, a very small pinch of isinglass, or a clean egg-shell, with a little of the white adhering to it, is the best that can be used. (We cannot recommend the skin of any fish.) If tried, with the same proportions by both the methods we have given, the reader will easily ascertain that which answers best. Never use mustard to fine coffee with. It is a barbarous custom of which we have heard foreigners who have been in England vehemently com- plain ! Coffee, 2 ozs.; water, 1 quart. Filtered ; or boiled 10 minutes ; left to clear 10 minutes.CHAP. XXVII.] COFFEE, CHOCOLATE, &C. 649 BURNT COFFEE. {In France vulgarly called Gloria.') Make some coffee as strong and clear as possible, sweeten it in the cup with white sugar almost to syrup, then pour brandy on the top gently over a spoon, set fire to it with a lighted paper, and when the spirit is in part consumed, blow out the flame and drink the gloria quite hot. An ounce of chocolate, if good, will be sufficient for one person. Rasp, and then boil it from five to ten minutes with about four tablespoonsful of water; when quarter-pint or rather more : 5 to 10 minutes. Milk, 1 j pint: ^ minute. Obs.—The general reader will understand the use of the chocolate-mill shown in the engraving with the pot; but to the uninitiated it may be as well to ob- serve, that it is worked quickly round between both hands to give a fine froth to the chocolate. It also serves in lieu of a whisk for working creams, or jellies, to a froth or whip. TO MAKE CHOCOLATE. {French Receipt.) it is extremely smooth add nearly a pint of new milk, give it an- other boil, stir it well, or mill it, and serve it directly. For water- chocolate use three quarters of a pint of water instead of the milk, and send rich hot cream to table with it. The taste must decide whether it shall be made thicker or thinner.

The yeast procured from a public brewery is often so extremely bitter that it can only be rendered fit for use by frequent washings, and after these even it should be cautiously employed. Mix it, when first brought in, with a large quantity of cold water, and set it by till the following morning in a cool place; then drain off the water, and stir the yeast up well with as much more of fresh; it must again stand several hours before the water can be poured clear from it. By changing this daily in winter, and both night and morning in very hot weather, the yeast may be preserved fit for use much longer than it would otherwise be; and should it fer- ment rather less freely after a time, a small portion of brown sugar stirred to it before the bread is made will quite restore its strength. German yeast, imported in a solid state, is now much sold in London, and answers, we are told, remarkably well; but we have not ourselves had an opportunity of proving it. THE OVEN. A brick oven, heated with wood is far superior to anyBREAD. CHAP. XXVIII,] 651 other for baking bread, as well as for most other pur- poses ; the heat of an iron one being much less easy to regulate; but those attached to the kitchen ranges are convenient, for the facility they afford at all times of baking in a small way. They are, however, we should say, far from economical as regards the proportion of fuel required to heat them; and the same objection may be made to the American oven also; the strong smell, too, emitted from the iron ones, and diffused often entirely through a house, is peculiarly unpleasant. A brick oven should be well heated with faggot wood, or with a faggot, and two or three solid logs; and after it is cleared, the door should be closely shut for quite half an hour before the baking commences; the heat will then be well sustained for a succession of bread, pies, cakes, and small pastry. The servant who habitually attends at an oven will soon become acquainted with the pre- cise quantity of fuel which it requires, and all other pecu- liarities which may be connected with it. In general more time must be allowed to bake any thing in an iron than in a brick oven. TO MAKE BREAD. Every cook, and we might almost say, every female servant, ought to be perfectly acquainted with the mode of making good household bread; and skill in preparing other articles of food is poor compensation for ignorance upon this one essential point. A very slight degree of attention, moreover, will enable any person to succeed in it, and there is, consequently, small excuse for those who neglect to render themselves properly acquainted with the process. The best flour will generally be found the cheapest in the end; it should be purchased if possible from a miller who can be depended on for supplying it good and un- adulterated. Let it be stored always in a dry place, as damp is very injurious to it; if kept habitually in a chest, this should be entirely emptied at intervals, cleaned with great nicety, and not filled again until it isMODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XXVIII. 652 perfectly dry. The kneading trough, tub, or pan, with every thing else indeed used for the bread, or for the oven, should at all times be kept scrupulously clean. The yeast of mild home-brewed beer is the best that can be procured, and requires no purifying; but it should be strained through a hair-sieve after it is mixed with a portion of warm milk, or w^ater, before it is added to the flour. Yery rapid fermentation, which is produced by using more than the necessary quantity of yeast, is by no means advantageous to the bread, which not only be- comes dry and stale from it, but is of less sweet and pleasant flavour than that which is more slowly fer- mented. In winter it should always be placed near the fire, but never sufficiently so to become hot; nor should it ever be allowed to become perfectly cold. Put half a bushel (more or less, according to the con- sumption of the family) of flour into the kneading-tub or trough, and hollow it well in the middle ; dilute a pint of yeast as it is brought from the brewery, or half the quantity if it has been washed and rendered solid, with four quarts or more of lukewarm milk or water, or a mixture of the two; stir into it, from the sur- rounding part, with a wooden spoon, as much flour as will make a thick batter ; throw a little over it, and leave this, which is called the leaven, to rise before proceeding further. In about an hour it will have swollen considerably, and have burst through the coat- ing of flour on the top; then pour in as much more warm liquid as will convert the whole, with good Jcneading, and this should not be spared, into a firm dough, of which the surface should be entirely free from lumps or crumbs. Throw a cloth over, and let it re- main until it has risen very much a second time, which will be in an hour, or something more, if the batch be large. Then work it lightly up, and mould it into loaves of from two to three pounds weight; send them directly to a well-heated oven, and bake them from an flour and a half to an hour and three quarters.CHAP. XXVIII.]] 65 3 BREAD, Flour, J bushel; salt (when it is liked), 4 to 6 ozs.; yeast, 1 pint unwashed, or J pint if purified; milk, or water, 2 quarts : 1 to 1 \ hour. Additional liquid as needed. BORDYKE BREAD. (Author's Receipt.) Mix with a gallon of flour a large teaspoonful of fine salt, make a hollow in the centre, and pour in two tablespoonsful of solid, well-purified yeast, gradually diluted with about two pints and a half of milk, and work it into a thick batter with the surrounding flour; j dust a little on the top, and leave it to rise from an hour to an hour and a half ; then knead it up with as much more warm skimmed milk as will render it quite firm and smooth without being very stiff; let it rise another hour, and divide it into three loaves; put them into square tins slightly buttered, or into round baking pans, and bake them about an hour and a quarter in a well-heated oven. The dough can be formed into household loaves if preferred, and sent to the oven in the usual way. When a finer and more spongy kind of bread is required for immediate eating, substitute new milk for skimmed, dissolve in it about an ounce of butter, leave it more liquid when the sponge is set, and let the whole be lightly kneaded into' a lithe dough; the bread thus made will be excellent when new, and for a day or so after it is baked, but it will become dry sooner than the other. Flour, 1 gallon; salt, 1 teaspoonful; skimmed milk, 2J pints: to rise from 1 to \\ hour. Additional milk, 1 to 2 pints: to rise 1 hour. 3 loaves, baked 1 hour and Obs. 1.—A few spoonsful of cream will wonderfully improve either of the above receipts, and sweet butter- milk substituted for the other will give to the bread the shortness of a cake : we would particularly recom- mend it for trial when it can be procured.654 MODERN COOKERY* [CHAP. XXVIH. Obs. 2.—For an invalid, especially when the diges- tion is impaired, butter should be altogether omitted from the bread; and eggs, which are often added to the finer sorts of rolls, are better avoided also. Obs. 3.—We must repeat our caution against milk or water of a scalding heat being mixed ever with the yeast; it should be warm, rather more so than when taken from the cow, but not much. BROWN BREAD. Make this by either of the foregoing receipts, with meal as it is called (that is to say, the wheat just as it is ground, either separated from the coarse bran or not, ac- cording to the quality of the bread required) instead of Hour. It ferments easily, and does not therefore require a very full proportion of yeast; and it absorbs more moisture than the flour: it also retains it longer, if pro- perly baked. The loaves should be well soaked in the oven, but not over dried. Obs.—The best bread we ever tasted was made in great part with rye-flour : this was in a provincial town of France. POTATO BREAD. One pound of good mealy potatoes, steamed or boiled ,very dry, in the ordinary way, or prepared by Captain Kater’s receipt (see Chapter XV.), and rubbed quite hot, through a coarse sieve, into a couple of pounds of flour, with which they should be well mixed, will pro- duce excellent bread, which will remain moist much longer than wdieaten bread made as usual. The yeast should be added immediately after the potatoes. An ounce or two of butter, an egg, and some new milk, will convert this bread into very superior rolls. GENEVA ROLLS. Break down very small three ounces of butter into a couple of pounds of flour; add a little salt, and set the655 CHAP. XXVIII.] BREAD. sponge with a large tablespoonful of solid yeast, mixed with a pint of new milk, and a tablespoonful or more of strong saffron water; let it rise for a full hour, then stir to a couple of well-beaten eggs as much hot milk as will render them lukewarm, and wet the rolls with them to a light, lithe dough; leave it from half to three quarters of an hour longer, mould it . into small rolls, brush them with beaten yolk of egg, and bake them from twenty minutes to half an hour. The addition of six ounces of good sugar, three of butter, half a pound or more of currants, the grated rind of a large lemon, and a couple ; of ounces of candied orange-rind, will convert these into excellent buns. When the flavour of the saffron is not liked, omit it altogether. Only so much should be used at any time as will give a rich colour to the bread. Flour, 2 lbs.; butter, 3 ozs.; solid yeast, 1 large tablespoonful (saffron, 1 teaspoonful; water, less than a quarter pint) ; new milk, 1 pint; 1 hour or more. 2 eggs, more milk : § hour : baked 20 to 30 minutes. RUSKS. Break very small six ounces of butter into a couple of pounds of fine dry flour, and mix them into a lithe paste, with two tablespoonsful of mild beer-yeast, three well-beaten eggs, and nearly half a pint of warm new milk. When it has risen to its full height knead it. smooth, and make it into very small loaves or thick cakes, cut with a round cake-cutter; place them on a floured tin, and let them stand in a warm place, to prove, from ten to twenty minutes before they are set into the oven. Bake them about a quarter of an hour; divide them while they are still warm, and put them into a very slow oven to dry. When they are crisp quite through they are done. Four teaspoonsful of sifted sugar must be added when sweetened rusks are preferred. Flour, 2 lbs.; butter, 6 ozs.; yeast, 2 tablespoonsful; eggs, 3; new milk, nearly ^ pint: baked l hour.656 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XXVIII. CRUSTS TO SERVE WITH CHEESE. Take a half-baked loaf from the oven, and tear it into small rough bits with a couple of forks; lay these on a tin, and put them back into the oven for ten minutes. If a light loaf be made for the purpose, with a couple of ounces of butter and new milk, they will quite resemble rusks. COCOA-NUT BREAD. Either mix with the flour the same proportion of the nut, finely grated, as for the biscuit receipt, and then proceed as for other bread, or merely use very strongly flavoured cocoa-nut milk to make the dough: the bread will be excellent. GOOD CAPTAINS’ BISCUITS. Make some fine white flour into a smooth paste with new milk; divide it into small balls; roll, and after- wards pull them with the fingers as thin as possible ; prick them all over, and bake them in a somewhat brisk oven from eight to twelve minutes. Thin cream may be used for them on occasion, instead of milk, or a morsel of butter may be worked into the flour; but they are very good without this last.APPENDIX. BRANDIED CHERRIES. (Tappington Everard Receipt.) Fill to about two-thirds of their depth, some wide- necked bottles with the small cherries called in the markets brandy-blacks; pour in sufficient sifted sugar to fill up more than half of the remaining space, and then as much good French brandy as will cover the fruit, and reach to the necks of the bottles. Cork them securely, and let them stand for two months before they are opened : the cherries wall be excellent. BRANDIED MORELLA CHERRIES. Let the fruit be ripe, freshly-gathered, and the finest that can be had; cut off half the length of the stalks, and drop the cherries gently into clean dry quart bottles with wide necks ; leave in each sufficient space for four ounces of white pounded sugar candy (or of brown, if better liked) ; fill them up entirely with the best French brandy, and cork them closely : they will not shrivel if thus prepared. A few cherry or apricot kernels, or a small portion of cinnamon, can be added when they are considered an improvement. PEACHES IN BRANDY. (Rotterdam Receipt.) Prepare and stew some fine full-flavoured peaches by the receipt of page 512, but with two ounces more of sugar to the half pint of water; when they are tender put them with their syrup into glass or new stone jars, which they should only half fill; and when they are. quite cold pour in white or very pale French brandy to within an inch and a half of the brims : a few peach or apricot kernels can be added to them. The jars must be corked down. u uAPPENDIX. 658 A A GERTRUDE A LA CREME. Slice a plain pound or rice cake as for the Charlotte d la Parisienne of page 545, and take a round out of the centre of each slice with a tin cutter before the preserve is laid on; replace the whole in its original form, ice the outside with a green or rose coloured icing at pleasure, and dry it in a gentle oven ; or decorate it instead with leaves of almond paste, fastening them to it with white of egg. Just before it is sent to table fill it with well- drained whipped cream, flavoured as for a trifle, or in any other way to the taste. TO MAKE ORANGE BASKETS FOR JELLY. The oranges for these should be large. First, mark the handle of the basket evenly across the stalk-end of the fruit with the back of a small knife, or with a silver one, and let it be quite half an inch wide; then trace a line across from one end of the handle to the other, exactly in the middle of the orange, and when the other side is marked in the same way, cut just through the rind with the point of a penknife, being careful ntft to pierce the fruit itself; next, with a tea or dessert spoon, take off the quartered rind on either side of the handle ; pass a penknife under the handle itself; work the point of a spoon gently between the orange and the basket, until they are separated in every part; then take the fruit between the thumb and fingers, and press it care- fully out through one of the spaces on either side of the handle. CHANTILLY BASKETS. The form of these is shown by the plate at page 529, but they can be varied to the taste, and made with cakes of different sizes. It is essential to keep them very dry after they are fastened together, and, as we have before observed, they should be filled only the instant before they are sent to table. They may first beAPPENDIX. 659 lined with wafer-paper: a pint and a half of cream, when flavoured and whisked, will fill a large basket of this kind. AN EXCELLENT TRIFLE. Take equal parts of wine and brandy, about a wine- glassful of each, or two-thirds of good sherry or Madeira, and one of spirit, and soak in the mixture three sponge biscuits, and half a pound of macaroons and ratifias; cover the bottom of the trifle-dish with part of these, and pour upon them a pint of rich boiled custard made with six eggs, and about three-quarters of a pint of milk and cream ;* lay the remainder of the soaked cakes upon it, and pile over the whole, to the depth of two or three inches, the whipped syllabub of page 532, previously well drained; then sweeten and flavour slightly with wine only, less than half a pint of thin cream (or of cream and milk mixed) ; wash and wipe the whisk, and whip it to the lightest possible froth : take it off with a kimmer and heap it gently over the trifle. Macaroons and ratifias, \ lb.; wine and brandy mixed, i pint; rich boiled custard, 1 pint; whipped syllabub, (see page 532) ; light froth to cover the whole, short \ pint of cream and milk mixed; sugar, dessertspoonful ; wine, \ glassful. CROUSTADES, OR SWEET PATTIES. (A la Minute.) Slice some firm stale bread, about half an inch thick, and with a small round or fluted paste-cutter take from it as many croustades as will be required for a dish; mark the centres with a smaller cutter, leaving a rim of equal width all round ; scoop out the insides, and fry them in good butter a pale brown; drain and dry them well, and fill them with hot apple-marmalade, or with any warm preserve. The croustades may likewise be filled with good mince mutton, hare, or any brown meat, and served in the first course. * An equal portion of each may be taken. Sweeten, flavour, and thicken the custard by the receipts of page 533 and 534.660 APPENDIX. APRICOT MARMALADE. This preserve, of which the receipt has been inadver- tently omitted in its proper place at Chapter XXI., may may be made successfully by the directions at page 576. It will require rather less boiling, and from ten to twelve ounces of sugar to the pound of fruit will suffice for it. TO CLEAN BOTTLES IN LARGE NUMBERS. To do this in the best and quickest manner, rinse such amongst them as may particularly require it; put a little hay or a coarse cloth into a copper, and arrange them in it as compactly as possible; cover them with cold water, light the fire, and boil them gently for half an hour; take them out, let them cool, rinse them well, and when dry they will be ready for use. One or two may be broken in the process, but it is considered the most advantageous method of proceeding where they are very extensively used. A LIE FOR WASHING PUDDING-CLOTHS. To a pint of wood-ashes pour three quarts of boiling wTater, and either wash the cloths in the mixture without straining it; or give them two or three minutes’ boil in it first, then let the whole cool together; wash the cloths perfectly clean, and rinse them in abundance of water, changing it several times : this both takes the grease off, and renders them very sweet. Two ounces of soda dissolved in a gallon of water will answer almost as well; provided the rinsing afterwards be carefully attended to.INDEX Almond, cake, 6i0. cream, for blamange, 435 paste, 425 paste, sandwiches of, 433 paste, tartlets of, 426 pudding-, 465 rocher, 610 Almonds to blanch, 606 in cheesecakes 431 in custard, 539 mixed with apricot jam, 473 to pound, 606 in soups, 26—27 to reduce to paste, the quick- est and easiest way, 607 Anchovy butter, 152 sauce, 126 Anchovies, fried in batter, 96 potted, 356 Apple cake, 422 Charlotte, or Charlotte de Pommes, 544 marmalade for, 545 custards, 540 dumplings, fashionable, 461 fritters, 496 hedgehog, or Suedoise, 537 jelly, 586 jelly, exceedingly fine, 586 pudding, 445 pudding, small common, 446 sauce, 143 sauce, brown, 143 soup, 24 snowballs, 462 Apples, baked compote of, (our little lady’s receipt), 631 buttered, or Pommes au beurre, 546 Apricots, compote of green, 511 dried, French receipt for, 573 to dry (a quick and easy method), 578 Apricot blamange, 535 jam, 660 fritters, 496 Artichokes, to boil, 381 en salade, 381 to remove the chokes from, 381 Jerusalem, to boil, 394 to fry, 394 mashed, 395 excellent sauce of, 147 soup of, 21 d la Peine, 394 Asparagus, to boil, 369 to serve cold, 369 points, dressed like peas, 369 Aspic, or clear savoury jelly, 112 Arnott-Stove, 396 Aroce Doce, or sweet rice d la Portuguese, 548 Arrow-root, to thicken sauces with, 114 to thicken soup with, 4* 26, 36, 37, 38 Bacon, to boil, 298 broiled or fried, 299 Cobbett’s receipt for, 299 dressed rashers of, 299 French, for larding, 294 lardoons of, 200 to pickle cheeks of, 294 genuine Yorkshire receipt for curing, 292662 INDEX.

Square crown 8vo. 1/. 5s. cloth. My chief object and aim in writing this little book,' commences the amiable and noble authoress, ‘ has been to induce those who read and love God’s written Word, to read and love the great unwritten book which he has everywhere spread abroad for our learning.’ The ‘ chief object and aim' of this pious and gifted woman cannot fail in its object. Indeed, we may almost to a certainty pronounce for this labour of her devotional love a success which her most Christian sanguine wishes could not have anticipated for it. The authoress has termed it a small book, and may have at first intended it as such; it is gratifying that it is otherwise, for a single page could not be spared, so redolent is each with the best of material. It is remarked in the preface that the work was written while the body was in a state of ill health—what a contrast must the spirit have presentedl May it long direct the head and hand to add thus to our useful literature. —Standard.

THE COLLEGIAN’S GUIDE; Or, Recollections of College Days ; setting forth the Advantages and Temptations of a University Education. By **** ******, M.A., College, Oxford. Post 8vo. 10s. 6d. cloth. A volume of this kind has long been wanted. It traces amusingly the course of the student, from the first discussion that arises in his family on his going to college till his preparation for a first-class man. It details the first steps that should be taken, gives the characters of the several colleges, prescribes modes of life and courses of study, establishes intelligible beacons against the shoals and quicksands of idleness and dissipation and debt, and draws the beau-ideal of a first-rate collegian. This knowledge is thrown into the form of actual occurrence, being the result of the writer's own experience and observation. The spirit of the book is excellent; and the book itself cannot fail to be useful. All the chapters on college life are admirably written— lively, without exaggeration ; practically useful, yet very amusing; discursive and various, yet all tending to the object of elevating the collegian's character; keeping him from discreditable practices, and fitting him, by a judicious course of study, for the highest pursuits of life."—Britannia.

De Custine's remark- able volumes contain a more accurate account of the state and condition of Russia than any other work of recent date, without exception. The author hasmanifestly penetrated through that superficial glitter and gorgeous array which have blinded the eyes of too many travellers to the imperfections and defects of this great empire, and has shewn it as it really is. To do this in the case of Russia requires many and favourable opportunities of observation, con- siderable shrewdness, and a courage and determination not easily to be daunted; all which Mons. De Custine has proved himself to have possessed in an eminent degree; and the result is, a work which those who are desirous to know Russia as it really is, and not as it would fain impose itself on the world to be, would do well to consult. We promise our readers equal surprise and pleasure front the perusal of his very clever booh.”—Gentleman’s Magazine. DE LA BECIIE. —REPORT ON THE GEOLOGY OF CORNWALL, DEVON, AND WEST SOMERSET..

To that great class such a book is invaluable. It ought, in fact, to form part of the library of every one interested in rural affairs; for there are few plants so difficult to distinguish as grasses, not any more so, and none which it ' more important to know correctly, because of their various uses and qualities.

M'CULLOCH.—A DICTIONARY, PRACTICAL, THEORETICAL, AND HISTORICAL, OF COMMERCE, AND COMMERCIAL NAVIGATION. By J. R. M’Culloch, Esq. An entirely New Edition, corrected throughout, enlarged, and improved. 1 very thick vol. 8vo., illustrated with Maps and Plans, 50s. cloth; or 55s. strongly half- bound in Russia, with flexible back. “ Without exaggeration one of the most wonderful compilations of the age. The power of continuous labour, the wide range of inquiry, and the power of artistical finish, which have been brought into play by this work, are probably unrivalled in the history of literature . . . Compared with all previous attempts to compile a commercial dictionary, Mr. McCulloch’s appears as the realisation of an idea which former projectors had conceived too vaguely to be able to carry into execution. It is superior to them all, quite as much for the spirit of judicious selection brought by the author to his task, as f or any other quality. The great merit of the work is, that, while omitting nothing of essential importance,it contains nothing that is useless or merely cumbrous . . . The success of the earlier editions of Mr. MlCulloch’s Dictionary is, after all, the best proof of its merit; the facts attending it prove that the mercantile, political, and literary public were in want of such a work, and that they were satisfied with the manner in which Mr. M'Culloch had performed his task. No reader can rise from the perusal of any one of the larger articles without feeling that no previous writer has concentrated so much valuable information within so small a compass, or conveyed his inform- ation in so agreeable a style. And the remark is equally applicable to all the numerous articles of which this crammed volume is composed .... It is, indeed, invaluable as a book of reference to the merchant, the insurance-agent, the statesman, and the journalist; and its articles, from the care and talent with which they are executed, are as well calculated to supply the wants of the patient inquirer as of the hurried man of business. Mr. M'tulloch occupies a high place amongst the authors of the day as a hard-headed original thinker in political economy; a still higher, as one of the most zealous and successful labojirers in rendering that science popular; but, of all his publications, his Commercial Dictionary is the one least likely to encounter the rivalry of a work of superior or even equal value."

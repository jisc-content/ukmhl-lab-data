457 BOILED PUDDINGS. CHAP. XVII.] suet, chopped small, six of raisins weighed after they are stoned, six of well-cleaned currants, four ounces of minced apples, five of sugar, two of candied orange- rind, half a teaspoonful of nutmeg mixed with pounded mace, a very little salt, a small glass of brandy, and three whole eggs. Mix and beat these ingredients well together, tie them tightly in a thickly floured cloth, and boil them for three hours and half. We can recom- mend this as a remarkably light small rich pudding : it may be served with German wine, or punch-sauce. Flour, 3 ozs. ; bread-crumbs, 3 ozs.; suet, stoned raisins, and currants, each, 6 ozs.; minced apples, 4* ozs.; sugar, 5 ozs.; candied peel, 2 ozs.; spice, i teaspoonful ; salt, few grains; brandy, small wineglassful; eggs, 3 ; 3^ hours.

Form into a ball six ounces of good butter, and enclose it securely in about a third of the paste (rolled to a half-inch of thickness,) in the same way that an apple-dumpling is made; roll out the remainder of the paste, and place the portion containing the butter in the centre of it, with the part where the edge was drawn together turned downwards; gather the outer crust round it, and after having moistened the edge, close it with great care. Tie the pudding tightly in a well-floured cloth, and boil it for two hours and a half. It must be dished with caution that it may not break, and a small bit must be cut directly from the top, as in a meat-pudding. (See page 440). This is a very favourite pudding in some parts of England; the only difficulty in making or serving it is to prevent the escape of the butter, which, if properly secured, will be found in a liquid state in the inside, on opening it.

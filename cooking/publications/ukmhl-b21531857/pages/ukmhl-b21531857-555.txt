CHAP. XX.] SWEET DISHES. 513 pound of fine sugar boiled to a light syrup with three quarters of a pin! of water ; throw in the peaches, let them stew softly till quite tender, and turn them often that they may be equally done; after they are dished add a little strained lemon-juice to the syrup, and reduce it by a few minutes very quick boiling. The fruit is sometimes pared, divided, and stoned, then gently stewed until it is tender. Sugar, 8 ozs. ; water, f pint: 10 to 12 minutes. Peaches 6 or 7; lemon-juice, 1 large teaspoonful. stewed barberries; or compote dâ€™epine-vinette. Boil to a thin syrup half a pound of sugar and three- quarters of a pint of water, skim it well, and throw into it three-quarters of a pound of barberries stripped from the stalks; keep them pressed down into the syrup, and gently stirred: from five to seven minutes will boil them. Sugar, 8 ozs.; water, f pint: 12 to 15 minutes. Barberries, f lb. : 5 to 7 minutes. another compote of barberries for dessert. When this fruit is first ripe it requires, from its excessive acidity, nearly its weight of sugar to render it palatable; but after hanging some time upon the trees it becomes much mellowed in flavour, and may be sufficiently sweetened with a smaller proportion. Ac- cording to the state of the fruit then, take for each pound (leaving it in bunches) from twelve to sixteen ounces of sugar, and boil it with three-quarters of a pint of water till it forms a syrup. Throw- in the bunches of fruit, and simmer them for five or six minutes. If their weight of sugar be used, they will become in that time perfectly transparent. As all vessels of tin affect the colour of the barberries, they should be boiled in a copper stewpan, or in a German enamelled one, which would be far better. Barberries, 1 lb.; sugar, 12 to 16 ozs.; water, | pint: fruit simmered in syrup 5 to 6 minutes. L L

Just wash off the spice, and put the beef into a tin, or covered earthen pan as nearly of its size as possible, with a cup of water or gravy ; cover the top thickly with chopped beef-suet, and lay a coarse thick crust over the pan; place the cover on it, and bake the meat from five to six hours in a well-heated oven, which should not, however, be suffi- ciently fierce to harden the outside of the joint, which, if properly managed, will be exceedingly tender. Let it cool in the pan; and clear off* the suet before it is dished. It is to be served cold, and will remain good for a fortnight. Beef, 20 to 25 lbs. weight; sugar, 3 ozs. : 2 days.

For twelve pounds of the round, rump, or thick flank of beef, take a large teaspoonful of freshly-pounded mace, the same of ground black pepper, twice as much of cloves, one small nutmeg, and a quarter teaspoonful of cayenne, all in the finest powder. Mix them well with seven ounces of brown sugar, rub the beef with them

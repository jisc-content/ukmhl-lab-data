106 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. III. quarters of a pint of hot and good veal gravy, and nearly half a pint of Madeira or sherry. When the sauce has boiled gently for half an hour, add to it a small quantity of cayenne, and some salt, if this last be needed; then strain it, skim off the fat entirely, should any appear upon the surface, and serve it very hot. A smaller proportion of wine, added a few minutes before the sauce is ready for table, would perhaps better suit with English taste, as with longer boiling, its flavour passes off almost entirely. Either of these Espagnoles, poured over the well-bruised remains of pheasants, partridges, or moor-fowl, and boiled with them for an hour, will become a most admirable game gravy, and would generally be considered a superlative addition to other roast birds of their kind, as well as to the hash, or salmi, for which see Chapter XIII.

Strip the skin and take the fat from three fresh mutton kidneys, slice and flour them ; melt two ounces of butter in a deep saucepan, and put in the kidneys, with an onion cut small, and a teaspoonful of fine herbs stripped from the stalks.

Strain it through a fine sieve, and take off the fat. Spice or catsup may be added at pleasure. Mutton kidneys 3; butter 2 ozs.; onion 1 ; fine herbs 1 teaspoonful : J hour.

When a cradle spit, of which the engraving shows the form, and which opens with a joint Cradle Spit. to receive the roast, is not at hand, a bottle jack will be found more convenient than any other for holding the turkey ; and after the hook of this is passed through the neck, it must be further supported by a string running across the back and under the points of the skewer wdiich confines the pinions, to the hook ; for, otherwise, its weight would most probably cause it to fall.

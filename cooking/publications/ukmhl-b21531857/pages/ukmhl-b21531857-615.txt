PRESERVES. CHAP. XXI.] 573 WHITE CURRANT JAM, A BEAUTIFUL PRESERVE. Boil together quickly for seven minutes equal quan- tities of fine white currants, picked with the greatest nicety, and of the best sugar pounded and passed through a sieve.

White currants, 4 lbs.; best sugar, 4 lbs. : 7 minutes. Juice, 1 lemon. CURRANT PASTE.

This paste is re- markably pleasant and refreshing in cases of fever, and acceptable usually for winter-desserts. Red currants boiled from 5 to 7 minutes, pressed with one-fourth of their juice through a sieve, boiled from 1^- to 2 hours. To each pound add 7 ozs. pounded sugar : 25 to 30 minutes.

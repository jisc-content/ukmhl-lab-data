To that great class such a book is invaluable. It ought, in fact, to form part of the library of every one interested in rural affairs; for there are few plants so difficult to distinguish as grasses, not any more so, and none which it ' more important to know correctly, because of their various uses and qualities. With,Mr. Knapp’s book before ' making himself master of the subject." him, no one can have the least difficulty i Gardeners’ Chronicle.

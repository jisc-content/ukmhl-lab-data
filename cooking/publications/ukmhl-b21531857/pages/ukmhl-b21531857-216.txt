Boil the brains in a little good veal-gravy very gently for ten minutes; drain them on a sieve, and when cold, cut them into thick dice ; dip them into beaten yolk of egg, and then into very fine bread-crumbs, 'mixed with salt, pounded spices, and fine herbs, minced extremely small : fry them of a light brown, drain and dry them well, and slip them into the soup or hash after it is dished. When broth or gravy is not at hand, the brains may be boiled in water. NO. 15. CHESTNUT FORCEMEAT. Strip the outer skin from some fine sound chestnuts, then throw them into a saucepan of hot water, and set them over the fire for a minute or two, when they may easily be blanched like almonds. Put them into cold water as they are peeled. Dry them in a cloth, and weigh them. Stew six ounces of them very gently from fifteen to twenty minutes, in just sufficient strong veal- gravy to cover them. Take them up, drain them on a sieve, and when cold pound them perfectly smooth with half their weight of the nicest bacon rasped clear from all rust, or fibre, or with an equal quantity of fresh butter, two ounces of dry bread-crumbs, a small tea- spoonful of grated lemon-peel, one of salt, half as much mace or nutmeg, a moderate quantity of cayenne, and the unbeaten yolks of two eggs, or of three. This mix- ture makes most excellent forcemeat cakes, which must be moulded with a knife, a spoon, or the fingers, dipped in flour; more should be dredged over, and pressed on to them, and they should be fried slowly from ten to fifteen minutes.

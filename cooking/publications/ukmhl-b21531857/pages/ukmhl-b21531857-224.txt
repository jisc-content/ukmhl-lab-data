[CHAP. VII. MODERN COOKERY. 186 ROASTING. Roasting, which is quite the favourite mode of dressing meat in this country, and one in which the English are thought to excel, requires unremitting attention on the part of the cook, rather than any great exertion of skill. Large kitchens are usually fitted with a smoke-jack, by means of which, several spits, if needful, can be kept turning at the same time; but in small establishments, a roaster which allows of some eco- nomy in point of fuel, is more commonly used. That shown in the print is of very advantageous construction in this respect, as a joint may be cooked in it with a comparatively small fire, the heat being strongly reflected from the screen upon the meat; in consequence of this, it should never be placed very close to the grate, as the surface of the joint would then become dry and hard. A more convenient form of roaster, with a spit placed in it horizontally, and turned by means of a wheel and chain, of which the movement is regulated by a spring con- tained in a box at the top, is of the same economical order as the one above. Bottle-jack and Niche Screen.* Improved Spring-jack and Roaster. * The bottle-jack, without the screen, is used in many families ery successfully; it is wound up like a watch, by means of a key, id turns very regularly until it has run down.

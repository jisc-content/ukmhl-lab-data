BEEF. CHAP. VIII.] 215 FRENCH BEEF A LA MODE. (J. common Receipt.') Take seven or eight pounds of a rump of beef (or of any other tender joint), free from bone, and skewer it firmly into a good shape. Put two ounces of butter into a thick saucepan or stewpan, and when it boils, stir to it a tablespoonful of flour; keep these well shaken over a gentle fire until they are of a fine amber colour ; then lay in the beef, and brown it on both sides, taking care that it shall not stick to the pan. Pour to it by slow degrees, letting each portion boil before the next is added, or the butter will float upon the surface and be difficult to clear off afterwards, three quarters of a pint of hot water, or gravy; add a bunch of savoury herbs, one large, or two small carrots cut in thick slices, two or three moderate-sized onions, two bay-leaves, and sufficient pepper and salt to season the gravy. Let the meat simmer gently from four to five hours, and turn it when it is half done. When ready to serve, lift the beef into a hot dish, lay the vegetables round, and pour the gravy over it, after having taken out the herbs, and skimmed away the fat. In France, half or the whole of a calfâ€™s foot is stewed with the beef, which is there generally larded through with thick strips of fat bacon. (For larding see page 200.) Veal dressed in this way is even better than beef. The stewpan used for either, should be as nearly the size of the meat as possible. Beef, 7 to 8 lbs. : 4 to 5 hours. STEWED SIRLOIN OF BEEF. As a matter of convenience we have occasionally had this joint stewed instead of roasted, and have found it excellent. Cut out the inside or fillet as entire as possi- ble, and reserve it for a separate dish ; then remove the bones with care, or let the butcher do this for you ; spread the meat flat on a table and cover the inside with thin slices of striped bacon, after having first strewed over it a mixed seasoning of a small teaspoonful of salt,

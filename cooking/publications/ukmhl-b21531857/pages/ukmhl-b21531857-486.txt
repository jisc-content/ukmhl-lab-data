Some cooks butter a mould thickly, strew in the currants, and pour the batter on them, which produces the same appearance as when the ingredients are tied in a cloth. BATTER FRUIT PUDDING. Butter thickly a basin which holds a pint and a half, and fill it nearly to the brim with good boiling apples pared, cored, and quartered: pour over them a batter made with four tablespoonsful of flour, two large or three small eggs, and half a pint of milk. Tie a buttered and floured cloth over the basin, which ought to be quite full, and boil the pudding an hour and a quarter. Turn it into a hot dish when done, and strew sugar thickly over it: this, if added to the batter at first renders it heavy. Morelia cherries make a very supe- rior pudding of this kind ; and green gooseberries, dam- sons, and various other fruits, answer for it extremely well: the time of boiling it must be varied according to their quality and its size. For a pint and half mould or basin filled to the brim with apples or other fruit; flour, 4 tablespoonsful; eggs, 2 large or 3 small; milk, \ pint: 1 \ hour. Ohs.â€”Apples cored, halved, and mixed with a good batter, make an excellent baked pudding, as well as red currants, cherries, and plums of different sorts. KENTISH SUET PUDDING. To a pound and a quarter of flour put half a pound of finely minced beef-suet,* half a teaspoonful of salt, and a quarter one of pepper; mix these into a smooth paste, with one egg well beaten, and a little cold milk or water; make it into the shape of a paste-roller, fold a floured cloth round it, tie the end tightly, and boil it for a couple of hours. In Kent this pudding is usually sent to table with boiled beef, and is sometimes cooked with it * A very common fault with bad and careless cooks is, that of using- for paste and puddings suet coarsely chopped, which is, to many eaters, distasteful to the last degree.

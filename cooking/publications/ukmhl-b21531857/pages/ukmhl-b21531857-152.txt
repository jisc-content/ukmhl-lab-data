114. MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. IV. TO THICKEN SAUCES. When this is done with the yolks of eggs, they should first be well beaten, and then mixed with a spoonful of cold stock, should it be at hand, and with one or two of the boiling sauce, which should be stirred â€¢very quickly to them, and they must in turn be stirred briskly to the sauce, which may be held over the fire, and well shaken for an instant afterwards, but never placed upon it, nor allowed to boil. To the roux or French thickening (which follows), the gravy or other liquid which is to be mixed with it should be poured boiling* and in small quantities, the saucepan being often well shaken round, and the sauce made to boil up after each portion is added.

For invalids, or persons who object to butter in their soups or sauces, flour only, mixed to a smooth batter and stirred into the boiling liquid, may be substituted for other thickening : arrow-root also will answer the same purpose. FRENCH THICKENING; OR, BROWN ROUX. For ordinary purposes this may be made as it is wanted for use; but when it is required for various dishes at the same time, or for cookery on a large scale, it can be prepared at once in sufficient quantity to last several days, and it will remain good for some time. Dissolve with a very gentle degree of heat, half a pound of good butter, then draw it from the fire, skim it well, give time for it to settle, pour it gently from the sediment into a very clean frying-pan, and place it over a slow but clear fire. Put into a dredging box about seven ounces of fine dry flour; add it gradually to the butter, and shake the pan often as it is thrown in : keep the thickening constantly stirred until it has

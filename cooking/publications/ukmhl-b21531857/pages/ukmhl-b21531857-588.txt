546 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XX. de Bordeaux. Cut horizontally into half-inch slices a Savoy or sponge cake, and cover each slice with a different kind of preserve; replace them in their origi- nal form, and spread equally over the cake an icing made with the whites of three eggs, and four ounces of the finest pounded sugar; sift more sugar over it in every part, and put it into a very slack oven to dry.

It is impossible to specify the precise time which will render them sufficiently tender, as this

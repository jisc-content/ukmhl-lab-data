MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. VII. 184 the advantages of gentle simmering over the usual fast- boiling of meat, by which, as has been already forcibly shown (see article Bouillon, Chapter I.), the outside is hardened and deprived of its juices, before the iuside is half done, while the starting of the flesh from the bones, which it occasions, and the altogether ragged aspect which it gives, are most unsightly. Pickled or salted meat requires longer boiling than fresh; and that which is smoked and dried, longer still. This last should always be slowly heated, and if, from any circumstances, time cannot have been allowed for soaking it properly, and there is a probability of its being too salt when served, it should be brought very softly to boil in a large quantity of water, which should in part be changed as soon as it becomes quite briny, for as much more that is ready boiling. It is customary to lay large joints upon a fish-plate, or to throw some wooden skewers under them, to prevent their sticking to the vessel in which they are cooked; and it is as well to take the precaution, though unless they be placed over a very fierce fire, they cannot be in danger of this. The time allowed for them is about Large Copper or Iron the same as for roasting, from Stockpot.* fifteen to twenty minutes to the pound. For cooking rounds of beef, and other ponderous joints, a pan of this form is very convenient. By means of two almost equally expensive prepara- tions, called a poelee, and a blanc, the insipidity which results from boiling meat or vegetables in water only * The most suitable, and the most usual form of stockpot for making soup in large quantities is the deep one, which will be found at page 2 ; hut the handles should be at the sides, as in that shown above, with others on the cover to correspond (or with one in the centre of it), which, from some inadvertence, have been omitted in the present engraving.

In some counties they are dished upon fried bread-crumbs, but these are better handed round the table by themselves. Where game is plentiful we recommend that the remains of a cold roasted partridge should be well bruised and boiled down with just so much water, or unflavoured broth, as will make gravy for a couple of other birds : this, seasoned with salt and cayenne only, or flavoured with a few mushrooms, will be found a very superior accompaniment to roast partridges, to the best meat-gravy that can be made. A little eschalot, and a few herbs can be added to it at pleasure. It should be served also with boiled or broiled partridges in preference to any other. 30 to 40 minutes. Obs.â€”Rather less time must be allowed w7hen the birds are liked underdressed. In preparing them for the spit, the crop must be removed through a slit cut in the back of the neck; the claws be clipped close, and the legs held in boiling water for a minute that they may be skinned the more easily. BOILED PARTRIDGES. This is a delicate mode of dressing young and tender birds. Pick, clean, and wash them well; cut- off the heads, truss them like boiled fowls, and when ready drop them into a large pan of boiling water, throw a little salt on them, and in fifteen, or at the utmost in eighteen minutes they will be ready to serve. Lift them out, dish them quickly, and send them to table with white mushroom-sauce, with bread-sauce and game-gravy (see preceding receipt), or with celery-sauce. Our own mode of having them served, is usually with a slice of fresh butter, about a tablespoonful of lemon-juice, and a good sprinkling of cayenne placed in a very hot dish, un^er the birds. 15 to 18 minutes.

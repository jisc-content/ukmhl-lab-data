640 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XXVI. good pale brown sugar \ lb. ; French brandy, 1 quart: infuse 1 month. THE regent’s, OR GEORGE THE FOURTH’S, PUNCH. Pare as thin as possible the rinds of two China oranges, of two lemons, and of one Seville orange, and infuse them for an hour in half a pint of thin cold syrup ; then add to them the juice of the fruit. Make a pint of strong green tea, sweeten it well with fine sugar, and, when it is quite cold, add it to the fruit and syrup, with a glass of the best old Jamaica rum, a glass of brandy, one of arrack, one of pine apple syrup, and two bottles of champagne ; pass the whole through a fine lawn sieve until it is perfectly clear, then bottle, and put it into ice until dinner is served. We are indebted for this receipt to a person who made the punch daily for the prince’s table, at Carlton palace, for six months ; it has been in our possession some years, and may be relied on. Rinds and juice of 2 China oranges, 2 lemons, and of 1 Seville orange ; syrup ^ pint; strong green tea, sweetened, 1 pint; best old Jamaica rum, arrack, French brandy (vieux cognac), and pine apple syrup, each 1 glassful; champagne 2 bottles. In ice for a couple of hours. THE OLD bachelor’s PUNCH. Put into one half pint tumbler the very thin rind of a fresh lemon, and fill it with boiling water ; squeeze the juice into a second glass of the same size, and fill it nearly to the brim with sugar in lumps; then pour in as much boiling water as it will contain, and when the sugar is dissolved, turn the contents of both glasses into a hot jug ; add a tablespoonful of fine currant (or of guava) jelly, should it be at hand; stir the whole well, keep it very hot, and add to it as much spirit as will make it pleasant, but in the proportion of two glasses of brandy to one of rum.

CHAP. XVII.] BOILED PUDDINGS. 449 Fresh butter, pounded sugar, flour, stoned raisins, each ^ lb.; eggs, 5 : 3 hours. GERMAN PUDDING, AND SAUCE. Stew, till very tender and dry, three ounces of whole rice in a pint and a quarter of milk; when a little cooled, mix with it three ounces of beef-suet, finely chopped, two ounces and a half of sugar, an ounce of candied orange or lemon-peel, six ounces of sultana raisins, and three large eggs well beaten and strained.

We think a full teaspoonful of lemon-juice added to the wine an improvement to this sauce, /which is excellent; and we can recommend the pudding also to our readers. Milk, l \ pint; rice, 3 ozs. : 1 hour, or more. Suet, 3 ozs.; sugar, 2J- ozs. ; candied peel, 1 oz.; sultana raisins, 6 ozs. ; eggs, 3 large : 2^ hours. Sauce.— Sherry, 2 glasses; sugar, 3 J oz.; yolks of eggs, 3; little lemon-juice. We have already, in a previous part of the volume, directed that the German sauce should be milled to a fine froth, and poured upon the pudding with which it is served : when this is not done, the quantity should be increased. A CABINET PUDDING. Split and stone three dozens of fine jar raisins, or take an equal number of dried cherries, and place either of them regularly, in a sort of pattern, in a thickly-buttered plain quart mould or basin; next, slice and lay into it three penny sponge-cakes, add to these two ounces of G G

CHAP. IV.] SAUCES. 137 common melted butter. Chervil is boiled, chopped and mixed with gravy or butter in the same way. Melted butter, or thickened veal-gravy, third of pint; parsley, boiled and minced, 1 dessertspoonful. GOOSEBERRY SAUCE FOR MACKEREL* Cut the stalks and tops from half to a whole pint of quite young gooseberries, wash them well, just cover them with cold water and boil them very gently indeed until they are tender; drain them well, and mix with them a small quantity of melted butter made with rather less flour than usual. Some eaters prefer the mashed gooseberries without any addition ; others like that of a little ginger. The best way of making this sauce is to turn the gooseberries into a hair sieve to drain, then to press them through it with a wooden spoon, and to stir them in a clean stewpan or saucepan over the fire with from half to a whole teaspoonful of sugar, just to soften their extreme acidity, and a bit of fresh butter about the size of a walnut. When the fruit is not passed through the sieve it is an improvement to seed it. COMMON SORREL SAUCE. Strip from the stalks and the large fibres, from one to a couple of quarts of freshly-gathered sorrel, wash it very clean, and put it into a well-tinned stewpan or saucepan (or into a German enamelled one, which would be far better), without any water; add to it a small slice of good butter, some pepper and salt, and stew it gently, keeping it well-stirred, until it is exceedingly tender, that it may not burn ; then drain it on a sieve, or press the liquid well from it, chop it as fine as pos- sible, and boil it again for a few minutes with a spoon- ful or two of gravy, or the same quantity of cream or milk, mixed with a half-teaspoonful of flour, or with only a fresh slice of good butter. The beaten yolk of an egg or two stirred in just as the sorrel is taken from the fire will soften the sauce greatly, and a saltspoonful of pounded sugar will also be an improvement.

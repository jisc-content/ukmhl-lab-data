168 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. Y. POTATOE FLOUR. (Fecule de Pommes de ter re). Grate into a large vessel full of cold water, six pounds of sound mealy potatoes, and stir them well together. In six hours pour off the water, and add fresh, stirring the mixture well; repeat this process every three or four hours during the day, change the water at night, and the next morning pour it off; put two or three quarts more to the potatoes, and turn them directly into a hair-sieve, set over a pan to receive the flour, which may then be washed through the sieve, by pouring water to it. Let it settle in the pan, drain off the water, spread the potatoe-sediment on dishes, dry it in a slow oven, sift it, and put it, into bottles or jars, and cork or cover them closely. The flour thus made will be beautifully white, and perfectly tasteless. It will remain good for years, TO MAKE FLOUR OF RICE. Take any quantity of whole rice, wash it thoroughly, changing the water several times ; drain and press it in a cloth, then spread it on a dish, and dry it perfectly; beat it in a mortar to a smooth powder, and sift it through a fine sieve. Whenvused to thicken soup or sauces, mix it with a small quantity of cold water or broth, and pour it to them while they are boiling. This flour when newly made, is of much purer flavour than any usually prepared for sale. POWDER OF SAVOURY HERBS. All herbs that are to be dried for storing should be gathered in fine weather; cleared from dirt and decayed leaves; and dried quickly, but without scorching, in a Dutch-oven before the fire, or in any other that is not too much heated. The leaves should then be stripped from the stalks, pounded, sifted, and closely corked in separate bottles; or several kinds may be mixed and pounded together for the convenience of seasoning in an instant gravies, soups, forcemeats, and made dishes - appropriate spices, celery-seed, and dried lemon-peel, all in fine powder, can be added to these herbs.

CHAP. XVII.] BOILED PUDDINGS. 453 mace, four ounces of good sugar, two of candied citron or orange-rind, four eggs, and two or three spoonsful of milk or brandy. Stir, and beat these ingredients tho- roughly together, pour them into a thick, well-floured cloth, and boil the pudding for four hours. Bread-crumbs and flour each, 4 ozs. ; suet, 12 ozs. ; stoned raisins, 1 lb.; salt, third of saltspoonful; \ nutmeg; ginger, \ teaspoonful; half as much mace ; sugar, 4 ozs.; candied citron or orange-rind, 2 ozs.; eggs, 4; milk or brandy, 3 to 5 tablespoonsful: 4 hours. Obs.—The remains of this pudding will answer well for the receipt that follows. THE ELEGANT ECONOMIST’S PUDDING. Butter thickly a plain mould or basin, and line it entirely with slices of cold plum or raisin pudding, cut so as to join closely and neatly together; fill it quite with a good custard, lay first a buttered paper, and then a floured cloth over it, tie them securely, and boil the pudding gently for an hour; let it stand ten minutes after it is taken up before it is turned out of the mould. This is a more tasteful mode of serving the remains of a plum-pudding than the usual one of broiling them in slices, or converting them into fritters. The German sauce, well milled or frothed, is generally much re- lished with sweet boiled-puddings, and adds greatly to their good appearance; but common wine, or punch- sauce, may be sent to table with the above quite as appropriately. Mould or basin holding 1\ pint, lined with thin slices of plum-pudding; J pint new milk boiled gently 5 minutes with grain of salt; 5 bitter almonds, bruised ; sugar in lumps, 2-| ozs. ; thin rind of \ lemon, strained and mixed directly with 4 large well-beaten eggs; poured into mould while just warm; boiled gently 1 hour.

MODERN COOKERY. ^CIIAP. VIII. 206 ROAST RUMP OF BEEF. As this joint is generally too large to serve whole, as much of it as will form a handsome dish should be cut from the chump-end to roast. It must be ma- naged as the sirloin, to which it is commonly preferred by connoisseurs. When boned, and rolled into the form of a fillet of veal as it sometimes is, nearly or quite an additional hour should be allowed to dress it. TO ROAST PART OF A ROUND OF BEEF. The natural division of the meat will show where the silver-side of the round is to be separated from the upper, or tongue side, which is the proper part for roast- ing, and which will be found equally good and profitable for the purpose, if allowed to hang as long as it can be kept sweet before it is dressed. Care should be taken in dividing the meat, not to pierce the inner skin. The silver side, with the udder, if there should be one to the joint, may be pickled, spiced, or simply salted, and will be excellent either way. The outside fat should be drawn tightly round the remainder of the beef, which must be firmly skewered, or bound with tape, to keep it in form. It will require long roasting at a strong steady fire, and should be kept constantly basted. Beef, 14 lbs.; 4j to 5 hours. Obs.â€”We think that larding the beef quite through with large lardoons of firm fat, of udder, or of bacon, would be an improvement; and we ought also to observe, that unless it be young and of fine quality, it will not answer well for roasting. TO ROAST A FILLET OF BEEF. Raise the fillet trom the inside of the sirloin, or from part of it, with a sharp knife; leave the fat on, trim off the skin, lard it through, or all over; or roast it, quite plain; baste it with butter, and send it very hot to table, with tomata sauce, or sauce piquante, or

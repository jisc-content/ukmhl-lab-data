MODERN COOKERY. 230 [CHAP. VIII. at the end of three days more, pour on it half a pound of treacle, and let it remain in the pickle a fortnight after this ; then hang it to drain, fold it in brown paper, and send it to be smoked over a wood fire for two or three weeks. Should the peculiar flavour of the juniper- berries prevail too much, or he disapproved, they may be in part, or altogether, omitted; and six ounces of sugar may be rubbed into the tongue in the first instance when it is liked better than treacle. Tongue, 7 to 8 lbs. ; saltpetre, 1 oz. * black pepper, ^ oz.; sugar, 2 ozs.; juniper-berries, 3 ozs. : 2 days. Bay-salt, 8 ozs. : 3 days. Treacle, ^ lb.: 14 days. Obs.â€”Before the tongue is salted, the gullet, which has an unsightly appearance, should be trimmed away : it is indeed usual to take the root off entirely, but some families prefer it left on for the sake of the fat. BEEF TONGUES. (A Suffolk Receipt.} For each very large tongue, mix with half a pound of salt two ounces of saltpetre and three-quarters of a pound of the coarsest sugar; rub the tongues daily, and turn them in the pickle for five weeks, when they will be fit to be dressed, or to be smoked. 1 large tongue; salt, J lb.; sugar, f lb.; saltpetre, 2 ozs. : 5 weeks. TO DRESS BEEF TONGUES. When taken fresh from the pickle they require no soaking, unless they should have remained in it much beyond the usual time, or have been cured with a more than common proportion of salt; but when they have been smoked and hung for some time, they should be laid for two or three hours in cold, and as much longer in tepid water, before they are dressed : if extremely dry, ten or twelve hours must be allowed to soften them, and they should always be brought very slowly to boil. Two or three carrots and a large bunch of savoury herbs, added after the scum is cleared off, will improve them.

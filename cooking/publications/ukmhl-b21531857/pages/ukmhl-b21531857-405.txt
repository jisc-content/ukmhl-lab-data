CHAP. XV.] VEGETABLES. 363 as will fill a dish ; cover them with cold water, and when they have boiled very gently for five minutes, pour it off, and put more cold water to them; after they have simmered a second time for five minutes, drain the water quite away, and let them steam by the side of the fire from four to five minutes longer. Dish them carefully, pour white sauce over them, and serve them with the second course. Old potatoes thus prepared, have often been made to pass for new ones, at the best tables, at the season in which the fresh vegetable is dearest. The time required to boil them will of course vary with their quality: we give the method which we have found very successful. FRIED POTATOES.

This is an ad- mirable way of dressing potatoes, very common on the Continent, but less so in England than it deserves to be.

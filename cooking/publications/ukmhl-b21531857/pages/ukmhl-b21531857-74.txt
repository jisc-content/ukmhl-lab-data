38 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. I. a coarse but very clean sieve; wipe out tlie stewpan, put back the soup into it, and stir in when it boils, a pint and a quarter of good cream, mixed with a table- spoonful of the best arrow-root: salt, if needed, should be thrown in previously. Young rabbits, 3 ; water, or clear veal-broth, 7 pints : three quarters of an hour. Remains of rabbits ; onions, 2 ; celery, 1 head; carrots, 3; savoury herbs; mace, 2 blades ; white pepper-corns, a half-teaspoonful; salt, 1 oz.: four hours. Soup 4 to 5 pints; pounded rabbit- flesh, 8 ozs. ; salt, mace, and cayenne, if needed ; cream, 1 pint and a quarter; arrow-root, 1 tablespoonful (or 1 oz. and a-half.) BROWN RABBIT SOUP. 'Cut down into joints, flour, and fry lightly, two full grown, or three young rabbits; add to them three onions of moderate side, also fried to a clear brown ; on these pour gradually seven pints of boiling water, throw in a large teaspoonful of salt, clear off all the scum with care as it rises, and then put to the soup a faggot off parsley, four not very large carrots, and a small teaspoonful of pepper-corns ; boil the whole very softly from five hours to five and a half; add more salt if needed, strain off the soup, let it cool sufficiently for the fat to be skimmed clean from it, heat it afresh, and send it to table with sippets of fried bread. Spice, with a thick- ening of rice-flour, or of wheaten flour browned in the oven, and mixed with a spoonful or two of very good mushroom catsup, or of Harveyâ€™s sauce, can be added at pleasure to the above, with a few drops of eschalot, wine, or vinegar ; but the simple receipt will be found extremely good without them. Rabbits, 2 full grown, or 3 small; onions fried, 3, middling-sized; water, 7 pints ; salt, one large teaspoon- ful or more ; carrots, 4 ; faggot of parsley ; pepper-corns, one small teaspoonful: 5 to 5hours.

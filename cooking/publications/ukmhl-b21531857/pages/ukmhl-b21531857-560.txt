[CHAP. XX. MODERN COOKERY. 518 four oranges, with a small portion of the rind, may be added instead of part of the lemons. APPLE calf’s FEET JELLY. Pour a quart of prepared apple-juice (see page 509) on a pound of fresh apples pared and cored, and simmer them till well broken; strain the juice, and let it stand till cold, then measure, and put a pint and a half of it into a stewpan with a quart of calf’s feet stock (see page 500), nine ounces of sugar broken small, or roughly pounded, the juice of two fine lemons, and the thin rinds of one and a half, with the whites and shells of eight eggs.

Obs.—We would recommend the substitution of quinces for apples in this receipt as likely to afford a very agreeable variety: or equal portions of the two fruits might answer well. Unless the stock be very stiff, add isinglass to this, as to the calf’s feet jelly, when it is to be moulded. ORANGE calf’s FEET JELLY. To a pint and a half of firm calf’s feet stock, put a

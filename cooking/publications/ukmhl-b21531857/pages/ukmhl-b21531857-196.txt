Obs.â€”This favourite oriental sauce is compounded in a great variety of ways ; but some kind of acid fruit is essential to it. The mango is used in India ; here the bullaces in an unripe state answer very well. Goose- berries also, while still hard and green, are some- times used for it ; and ripe red chilies and tomatas are mixed with the other ingredients. The sauce keeps better if it be exposed to a gentle degree of heat for a week or two, either by the side of the fire, or in a full southern aspect in the sun. In this case it must be put into a jar or bottles, and well secured from the air. Half a pound of gooseberries, or of these and tamarinds from the shell, and green apples mixed, and the same weight of salt, stored raisins, brown sugar, powdered ginger, chilies, and garlic, with a pint and a half of vinegar, and the juice of three large lemons, will make another genuine Bengal chetney. MUSHROOM CATSUP. Cut the ends of the stalks from two gallons of freshly- gathered mushrooms (the large flaps are best for this purpose, but they should not be worm - eaten) ; break them into a deep earthen pan, and strew amongst them three quarters of a pound of salt, reserving the larger portion of it for the top. Let them stand for three, or even four days, and stir them gently once every four and twenty hours; then drain off the liquor without pressing the mushrooms; strain and measure it; put it into a very clean stew-pan, and boil it quickly till reduced nearly or quite half. For every quart, allow half an ounce of whole black pepper, and a drachm of mace ; or, instead of the pepper, a quarter teaspoonful (ten grains) of good cayenne ; pour the catsup into a clean jug or jar, lay a folded cloth over it, and keep it in a cool place until the following day ; pour it gently

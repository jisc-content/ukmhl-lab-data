When a perforated tin shape, ordinarily used for moulding spinach, is not at hand one of earthenware, slightly but- tered, will serve nearly as well. SPINACH. (Common English mode.) Boil the spinach very green in plenty of water, drain, and then press the moisture from it between two trenchers ; chop it fine, put it into a clean sauce- pan, with a slice of fresh butter, and stir the whole till well-mixed and very hot. Smooth it in a dish, mark it in dice, and send it quickly to table. (Another common English Receipt for Spinach.) Take it leaf bv leaf from the stalks, and be very careful to clear it from any weeds that may be amongst it, and to free it by copious and repeated washings from every particle of grit. Put it into a large well- tinned stewpan or saucepan, with the water only that hangs about it; throw in a small spoonful of salt, and keep it constantly pressed down with a wooden spoon, and turned often for about a quarter of an hour, or until it is perfectly tender. Drain off the superfluous moisture, chop the spinach quickly on a hot trencher; dish, and serve it immediately. Fried sippets of bread should always be served round this vegetable, unless it be prepared for an invalid. BOILED TURNIP-RADISHES. These should be freshly drawn, young and white. Wash and trim them neatly, leaving on two or three of the small inner-leaves of the top. Boil them in plenty of salted water from twenty to thirty minutes: as soon as they are tender send them to table well- drained, with melted butter or white sauce. Common radishes when young, tied in bunches, and boiled from eighteen to twenty-five minutes, then served on a toast like asparagus, are very good.

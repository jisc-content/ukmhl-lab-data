164< MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. V. basil vinegar is made in exactly the same way, but it should not be left on the leaves more than three weeks. The jars or bottles should be filled to the neck with the tarragon before the vinegar is added: we prefer for this, as well as for many other preparations, good pale white wine vinegar to the distilled. The flavour of the tarragon is strong and peculiar, but to many tastes very agreeable : it imparts quite a foreign character to the dishes for which it is used. GREEN MINT VINEGAR. t Pick and slightly chop, or bruise, freshly-gathered mint, and put it into bottles; fill them nearly to the necks, and add vinegar as for tarragon : in forty days, strain it off, and bottle it for use. The mint itself, ready minced for sauce, will keep well in vinegar, though the colour will not be very good. CUCUMBER VINEGAR. First wipe, and then, without paring, slice into a jar some young and quickly-grown cucumbers; pour on them as much boiling vinegar as will cover them well, with a teaspoonful of salt, and two-thirds as much of pepper- corns to the pint and a half of vinegar: it may remain on the cucumbers for a month. Some persons like a mild onion or two sliced in with them. CELERY VINEGAR. Put into a wide-necked bottle or pickle-jar eight ounces of the white part of the root and stalks of fine fresh celery cut in slices, and pour on it a pint of boiling vinegar; when a little cool, cork it down, and in three weeks it will be ready to strain, and bottle for keeping. Half an ounce of bruised celery-seed will answer the same purpose, when the root cannot be obtained. This is an agreeable addition to a salad, when its flavour is much liked ; a lialf-teaspoonful of salt should be boiled in it.

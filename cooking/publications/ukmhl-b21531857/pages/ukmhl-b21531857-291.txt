253 CHAP. IX.] VEAL. Knuckle of veal of 6 to 7 lbs. ; simmered gently from hours to 2^. SMALL PAIN DE VEAU ; OR, VEAL CAKE. Chop separately, and very fine, a pound and a quarter of veal quite free from fat and skin, and six ounces of beef kidney-suet; add a teaspoonful of salt, a full third as much of white pepper, and of mace or nutmeg, with the grated rind of half a lemon, and turn the whole well together with the chopping-knife till it is thoroughly mixed ; then press it smoothly into a small, round baking dish, and send it to a moderate oven for an hour and a quarter. Lift it into a clean, hot dish, and serve it plain, or with a little brown gravy in a tureen. Three ounces of the lean of a boiled ham minced small, will very much improve this cake, of which the size can be increased at will, and propor- tionate time allowed for dressing it. If baked in a hot oven, the meat will shrink to half its proper size, and be very dry. When done, it should be of a fine amber-colour, and like a cake in appearance. Veal, lj lb.; beef-suet, 6 ozs.; salt, 1 teaspoonful; pepper and mace, or nutmeg, f teaspoonful each ; rind of \ lemon; ham (when added), 3 ozs. : baked hour. BORDYKE VEAL CAKE. (|Good.) Take a pound and a half of veal perfectly clear of fat and skin, and eight ounces of the nicest striped bacon ; chop them separately, then mix them well together with the grated rind of a small lemon, half a teaspoonful of salt, a fourth as much of cayenne, the third part of a nutmeg, grated, and a half-teaspoonful of freshly pounded mace. When it is pressed into the dish, let it be somewhat higher in the centre than at the edge; and whether to be served hot or cold, lift it out as soon as it comes from the oven, and place it on a strainer that the fat may drain from it: it will keep many days

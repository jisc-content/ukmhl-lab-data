STRAWBERRY JAM. Strip the stalks from some fine scarlet strawberries, weigh, and boil them for thirty-five minutes, keeping them very constantly stirred; throw in eight ounces of good sugar, beaten small, to the pound of fruit, mix them well off the fire, then boil the preserve again quickly for twenty-five minutes. One pound of white currant juice added in the first instance to four of the strawberries, will greatly improve this preserve, which will be quite firm, and sufficiently, but not over sweet. Strawberries, 6 lbs. : 35 minutes. Sugar, 3 lbs.: 25 minutes. Or: strawberries, 4> lbs.; currant-juice, 1 lb. : 30 to 35 minutes. Sugar, 2J lbs.: 25 minutes.

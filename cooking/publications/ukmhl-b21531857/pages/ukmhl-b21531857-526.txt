Fresh butter, 2 ozs.; pounded sugar, -J- lb. ; cocoa- nut, 2 ozs. ; candied citron, 1 oz.; rind and juice of £• lemon ; eggs, 4 : \ hour. Obs.—The same ingredients may be made into one pudding only, and longer baked. GOOD YORKSHIRE PUDDING. To make a very good and light Yorkshire pudding, take an equal number of eggs and of a heaped table- spoonsful of flour, with a teaspoonful of salt to six of thqse. Whisk the eggs well, strain, and mix them gradually with the flour, then pour in by degrees as much new milk as will reduce the batter to the consistency of rather thin cream. The tin which is to receive the pudding must have been placed for some time previously under a joint that has been put down to roast: one of beef is usually preferred. Beat the batter briskly and lightly the instant before it is poured into the pan, watch it carefully that it may not burn, and let the edges have an equal share of the fire. When the pudding is quite firm in every part, and well- coloured on the surface, turn it, to brown the under side. This is best accomplished by first dividing it into quarters. In Yorkshire it is made much thinner than in the south, roasted generally at an enormous fire, and not turned at all: currants there are some- times added to it. Eggs, 6; flour, 6 heaped tablespoonsful, or from 7 to 8 ozs. ; milk, nearly or quite, 1 pint; salt, 1 tea- spoonful: 2 hours. Obs.—This pudding should be quite an inch thick when it is browned on both sid^s, but only half the depth when roasted in the Yorkshire mode. The cook must exercise her discretion a little in mixing the bat- ter, as from the variation of weight in flour, and in the size of eggs, a little more or less of milk may be re- quired : the whole should be rather more liquid than for a boiled pudding.

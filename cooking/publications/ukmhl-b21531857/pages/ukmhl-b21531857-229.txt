The common cooking stoves in this country, as they have hitherto been constructed, have rendered the exact regulation of heat which stewing requires rather difficult; and the smoke and blaze of a large coal fire are very unfavour- able to many other modes of cookery as well. The French have generally the advantage of the embers and ashes of the wood which is their ordinary fuel; and they have always in addition a stove of this construc- tion in which charcoal or braise (for explanation of this word, see remarks on preserv- ing, Chapter XXI.) only is burned; and upon which their stewpans can, when there is occasion, be left un- covered, without the danger of their contents being spoiled, which there generally is with us. It is true that of late great improvements have been made in our own stoves; and the hot plates, or hearths with which the kitchens of good houses are always furnished, are admirably adapted to the simmering system; but when the cook has not the convenience of one, the stewpans must be laid on trevets high above the fire, and be constantly watched, and moved, as occasion may require, nearer to or further from the flame. No copper vessels from which the inner tinning is in the slightest degree worn away should be used ever, for this or for any other kind of cookery; or not health only, but life itself, may be endangered by them.* We * Sugar, being an antidote to the poisonous effects of verdigris,

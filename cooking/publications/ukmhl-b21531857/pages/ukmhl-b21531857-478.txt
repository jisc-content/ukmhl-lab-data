436 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XVII. exceeding care; almonds and spices very finely pounded, and the rinds of oranges or lemons rasped or grated lightly off, that the hitter part of the skin may be avoided, when they are used for this, or for any other class of dishes; if pared, they should be cut as thin as possible. Custard puddings, to have a good appearance, must be simmered only, but without ceasing ; for if boiled in a quick and careless manner, the surface, instead of being smooth and velvety, will be full of holes, or honey- combed, as it is called, and the whey will flow from it and mingle with the sauce. A thickly-buttered sheet of writing-paper should be laid between the custard mix- ture and the cloth, before it is tied over, or the lid of the mould is closed upon it; and the mould itself, or the basin in which it is boiled, and which should always be quite full, must likewise be well buttered ; and after it is lifted from the water, the pudding should be left in it for quite five minutes before it is dished, to prevent its breaking, or spreading about. Batter is much lighter when boiled in a cloth, and allowed full room to swell, than when confined in a mould ; it should be well beaten the instant before it is poured into it, and put into the water immediately after it is securely tied. The cloth should be moist and thickly floured, and the pudding should be sent to table as expeditiously as possible after it is done, as it will quickly become heavy. This applies equally to all puddings made with paste, which are rendered uneata- ble by any delay in serving them after they are ready: they should be opened a little at the top as soon as they are taken from the boiler or stewpan. Plum-puddings, which it is now customary to boil in moulds, are both lighter and less dry, when closely tied in stout cloths well buttered and floured, especially when they are made in part with bread ; but when this is done, care should be taken not to allow them to burn to the bottom of the pan in which they are cooked ; and it is a good plan to lay a plate or dish under them, by way of precaution against this mischance : it will not

PISH. CHAP. II.] 93 stir the sauce until these are perfectly blended with it, then put in the oysters, and let them remain by the side of the fire until they are very hot : they require so little cooking, that if kept for four or five minutes nearly simmering, they will be ready for table, and they are quickly hardened by being allowed to boil, or by too much stewing. Serve them garnished with pale fried sippets. Small plump oysters, 1 pint; their own liquor: brought slowly to the point of simmering. Cream, J pint; seasoning of pounded mace and cayenne ; salt as needed; butter, 1 to 2 ozs.; flour 1 large teaspoonful.

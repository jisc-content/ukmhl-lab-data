339 GAME. CHAP. XIII.]. Pick and draw them with exceeding care, as the skin is easily broken; truss them like pheasants, lay them at a moderate distance from a clear brisk fire, baste them plentifully and constantly with butter, and serve them on a thick toast which has been laid under them in the dripping-pan for the last ten minutes of their roasting, and which will have imbibed a high degree of savour : some cooks squeeze a little lemon-juice over it before it is put into the pan. Send rich brown gravy and bread- sauce to table with the birds. From three-quarters of an hour to a full hour will roast them. Though kept to the point which we have recommended, they wTill not offend even the fastidious eater after they are dressed, as, unless they have been too long allowed to hang, the action of the fire will remove all perceptible traces of their previous state. In the earlier part of the season, when warm weather and close packing have ren- dered them, in their transit from the North, apparently altogether unfit for table, the chloride of soda may be used with great advantage to restore them to a fitting state for it; though the copious washings which must then be resorted to may diminish something of their fine flavour, f to 1 hour. TO ROAST GROUSE. Handle the birds very lightly in picking them, draw, and wipe the inside with clean damp cloths, or first w’ash, and then dry them well; though this latter mode would not be approved generally by epicures. Truss the birds in the same manner as the black cock, and roast them about half an hour at a clear and brisk fire, keeping them basted almost without intermission.

Ohs.—There are few occasions, we think, in which the contents of the dripping-pan can be introduced at table with advantage; but in dressing moor-game, we

46*5 BAKED PUDDINGS. CHAP. XVIII.]] used for any pudding, and stirring them softly into it at the instant of placing it in the oven, it will be ren- dered exceedingly light, and will rise very high in the dish; but as it will partake then of the nature of a souffle, it must be despatched with great expedition to table from the oven, or it will become flat before it is served. When a pudding is sufficiently browned on the sur- face (that is to say, of a fine equal amber-colour) before it is baked through, a sheet of writing paper should be laid over it, but not before it is set: when quite firm in the centre, it will be done. Potatoe, batter, plum, and every other kind of pud- ding indeed, which is sufficiently solid to allow of it, should, be turned reversed on to a clean hot dish from the one in which it is baked, and strewed with sifted sugar, before it is sent to table. Minute directions for the preparation and management of each particular variety of pudding will be found in the receipt for it. ALMOND PUDDING. On two ounces of fine white bread-crumbs pour a pint of boiling cream, and let them remain till nearly cold, then mix them very gradually with half a pound of sweet and six bitter almonds pounded to the smoothest paste, with a little orange-flower water, or, when this is not at hand, with a few drops of spring water, just to prevent their oiling; stir to them by degrees the well- beaten yolks of seven and the whites of three eggs, six ounces of sifted sugar, and four of clarified butter; turn the mixture into a very clean stewpan, and stir it with- out ceasing over a slow fire until it becomes thick, but on no account allow it to boil. When it is tolerably^ cool add a glass of brandy, or half a one of noyeau, pour the pudding into a dish lined with very thin puff paste, and bake it half an hour in a moderate oven. â™¦ Bread-crumbs, 2 ozs. ; cream, l pint; pounded al- monds, lb.; bitter almonds, 6; yolks of 7, whites of 3 H H

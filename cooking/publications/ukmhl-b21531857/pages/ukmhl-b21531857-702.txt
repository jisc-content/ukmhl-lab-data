660 APPENDIX. APRICOT MARMALADE. This preserve, of which the receipt has been inadver- tently omitted in its proper place at Chapter XXI., may may be made successfully by the directions at page 576. It will require rather less boiling, and from ten to twelve ounces of sugar to the pound of fruit will suffice for it. TO CLEAN BOTTLES IN LARGE NUMBERS. To do this in the best and quickest manner, rinse such amongst them as may particularly require it; put a little hay or a coarse cloth into a copper, and arrange them in it as compactly as possible; cover them with cold water, light the fire, and boil them gently for half an hour; take them out, let them cool, rinse them well, and when dry they will be ready for use. One or two may be broken in the process, but it is considered the most advantageous method of proceeding where they are very extensively used. A LIE FOR WASHING PUDDING-CLOTHS. To a pint of wood-ashes pour three quarts of boiling wTater, and either wash the cloths in the mixture without straining it; or give them two or three minutesâ€™ boil in it first, then let the whole cool together; wash the cloths perfectly clean, and rinse them in abundance of water, changing it several times : this both takes the grease off, and renders them very sweet. Two ounces of soda dissolved in a gallon of water will answer almost as well; provided the rinsing afterwards be carefully attended to.

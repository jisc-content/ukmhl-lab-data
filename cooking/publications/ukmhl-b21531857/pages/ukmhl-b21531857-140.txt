The latter part of the process must be very slow ; the stewpan must be fre- quently shaken, and the gravy closely watched that it may not burn; when it is of a fine deep amber colour, pour in sufficient boiling broth to cover the meat, add a bunch of parsley, and a few mushrooms and green onions. A blade or two of mace, a few wdiite pepper- corns, and a head of celery, would, we think, be very admissible additions to this gravy, but it is extremely good without. Half the quantity can be made, but it will be rather more troublesome to manage. Undressed ham, 8 to 12 ozs.; lean veal, 4 lbs.; broth, ^ pint: 1 to 2 hours. Broth, 3 to 4 pints; bunch of parsley and green onions, or 1 Portugal onion; mushrooms, J to ^ pint: 1 hour and j, to 2 hours. GOOD BEEF OR YEAL GRAYY. (English Receipt.') Flour and fry lightly in a bit of good butter a couple of pounds of either beef or veal; drain the meat well from the fat, and lay it into a small thick stewpan or iron saucepan; pour to it a quart of boiling water, add, after it has been well skimmed and salted, a large mild onion sliced, very delicately fried, and laid on a sieve to drain, a carrot also sliced, a small bunch of thyme and parsley, a blade of mace, and a few pepper-corns ; stew these gently for three hours or more, pass the gravy through a sieve into a clean pan, and when it is quite cold clear it entirely from fat, heat as much as is wanted for table, and if not sufficiently thick, stir into it from half * When there is no provision of this in the house, the quantity required may he made with a small quantity of beef, and the trimmings of the veal, by the directions for Bouillon, page 7.

Cut out the stalk entirely, and slice a fine firm cab- bage or two in very thin strips; throw them after they have been well washed and drained, into a large pan of boiling water ready salted and skimmed, and when they are tender, which will be in from ten to fifteen minutes, pour them into a sieve or strainer, press the water thoroughly from them, and chop them slightly.

When small and young they will be done in from fifteen to twenty minutes; at their full growth they will re- quire from three-quarters to a full hour, or more, of gentle boiling. After they become old and woolly they are not worth dressing in any way.

Split them once or even twice should they be large; after they are pared, boil them very tender, and press the water thoroughly from them with a couple of trenchers, or with the back of a large plate and one

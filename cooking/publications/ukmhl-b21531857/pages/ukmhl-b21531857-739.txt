Evans Lloyd. 8vo. 10s. 6d. cloth. “ Professor Dahlmann's book is, in short, a rapid sketch of the whole of what we call the Modern History of England, from its start at the Coronation of Henry the Seventh, to its intermediate settlement at the Coronation of IVilliam the Third. We have no English sum- mary of the history it relates so brief, compendious, and impartial. M. Dahlmann is a very earnest as well as intelligent viriter; and the steady advance of the popular principle in England, through an almost uninterrupted march of two centuries, is startlingly reflected in his clear and transparent relation. Mr. Lloyd's translation is very well executed.”—Examiner. DAVY (SIR HUMPHRY).—ELEMENTS OF AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY in a Course of Lectures. By Sir Humphry Davy.

De Custine's remark- able volumes contain a more accurate account of the state and condition of Russia than any other work of recent date, without exception. The author hasmanifestly penetrated through that superficial glitter and gorgeous array which have blinded the eyes of too many travellers to the imperfections and defects of this great empire, and has shewn it as it really is. To do this in the case of Russia requires many and favourable opportunities of observation, con- siderable shrewdness, and a courage and determination not easily to be daunted; all which Mons. De Custine has proved himself to have possessed in an eminent degree; and the result is, a work which those who are desirous to know Russia as it really is, and not as it would fain impose itself on the world to be, would do well to consult. We promise our readers equal surprise and pleasure front the perusal of his very clever booh.”—Gentleman’s Magazine. DE LA BECIIE. —REPORT ON THE GEOLOGY OF CORNWALL, DEVON, AND WEST SOMERSET..

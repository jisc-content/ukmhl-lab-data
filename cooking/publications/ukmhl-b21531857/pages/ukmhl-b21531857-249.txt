Place it over (not upon) a very gentle fire, and keep it just simmering from an hour and a half to an hour and three-quarters, when, if the meat be good, it will have become perfectly tender. Add salt to it, when it first begins to boil, and turn it when rather more than half done. A couple of spoonsful of gravy, half as much catsup, and a slight seasoning of spice would, to many tastes, improve this dish, of which, however, the great recommendation is its wholesome simplicity, which renders it suitable to the most delicate stomach. A thick mutton cutlet from the middle of the leg is excellent dressed thus. lj to 1 j hour. BEEF OR M;UTTON CAKE. ( Very good.) Chop two pounds of lean and very tender beef or mutton, with three-quarters of a pound of beef-suet; mix them well, and season them with a dessert- spoonful of salt, nearly as much pounded cloves, a tea- spoonful of pounded mace, and half a teaspoonful of cayenne. Line a round baking-dish with thin slices o^ fat bacon, press the meat closely into it, smooth the top, and cover it with bacon, set a plate on it with a weight, and bake it two hours and a*quarter. Take off the bacon, and serve the meat hot, with a little rich brown gravy, or set it by till cold, when it will be equally good. The fat of the meat that is used for this dish can be chopped up with it instead of suet, where it is liked as w~ell; and onion, or eschalot, shred fine, minced savoury herbs, grated lemon-peel, rasped bacon, or mushrooms cut small, may in turn be added to vary it in flavour.

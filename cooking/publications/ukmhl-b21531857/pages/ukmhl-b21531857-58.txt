MODERN COOKERY. 22 [CHAP. I. broth, made the clay before, and perfectly cleared from fat, will answer very well as a substitute; milk, too, may in part take the place of cream, when this last is scarce: the proportion of artichokes should then be increased a little. Yegetable-marrow, when young, makes a superior soup even to this, which is a most excellent one. It should be well pared, trimmed, and sliced into a small quantity of boiling veal-stock, or broth, and when perfectly tender, pressed through a fine sieve, and mixed with more stock, and some cream. In France the marrow is stewed first in butter, with a large mild onion or two, also sliced; and afterwards in a quart or more of water, which is poured gradually to it; it is next passed through a tammy,* seasoned with pepper and salt, and mixed with a pint or two of milk, and a little cream. COMMON CARROT SOUP. The easiest way of making this soup is to boil some carrots very tender in water slightly salted; then to pound them extremely fine, and to mix gradually with them boiling gravy-soup, (or bouillon) in the proportion of a quart to twelve ounces of the carrot. The soup should then be passed through a strainer, seasoned with salt and cayenne, and served very hot, with fried bread in a separate dish. If only the red outsides of the carrot be used, the colour of the soup will be very bright: they should be weighed after they are pounded. Turnip soup may also be made in the same manner. Soup, 2 quarts; pounded carrot, 1-J- lb.; salt, cay- enne : 5 minutes. A FINER CARROT SOUP. Scrape very clean and cut away any blemishes from some highly-flavoured red carrots; wash, and wipe them dry. Cut them in quarter-inch slices.

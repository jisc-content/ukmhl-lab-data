[CHAP. XIX. 500 MODERN COOKERY. very dry, and left to become quite cold before it is used. A few spoonsful of rich white sauce stirred into it when it is nearly tender, will improve it much. Form and hollow the croquettes as directed in the last receipt; fill them with a small portion of minced fowl, partridge, or pheasant, in a thick sauce, or with a stewed oyster or two cut in quarters; close the rice perfectly over them ; egg, and crumb the croquettes, fry and serve them gar- nished with crisped parsley. French cooks mix some- times a little grated Parmesan cheese with the rice at the moment it is taken from the fire, and roll the croquettes in more after they are egged; they press this on them, dip them again in egg, and then in the crumbs. Raise the pan high above the fire when the croquettes are lightly browned, that they may heat through ; then heighten the colour, and lift them out immediately. RISSOLES. This is the French name for small fried pastry of various forms, filled with meat or fish previously cooked: they may be made with brioche, or with light puff-paste, either of which must be rolled extremely thin ; cut it with a small round cutter fluted or plain ; put a little rich mince, or good pounded meat, in the centre, and moisten the edges, and press them securely together that they may not burst open in the frying. The rissoles may be formed like small patties, by laying a second round of paste over the meat; or, like cannelons ; they may, likewise, be brushed with egg, and sprinkled with vermicelli, broken small, or with fine crumbs. They are sometimes made in the form of croquettes, the paste being gathered round the meat, which must form a ball. In frying them, adopt the same plan as for the cro- quettes, raising the pan as soon as the paste is lightly coloured. Serve all these fried dishes well drained, and on a napkin.

378 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XY. young radishes, and occasionally chives or small green onions (when the taste of a party is in favour of these last) are the usual ingredients of summer salads. Half- grown cucumbers sliced thin, and mixed in with them, are a favourite addition with many persons. In Eng- land it is customary to cut the lettuces extremely fine; the French, who object to the flavour of the knife, which they fancy this mode imparts, break them small instead. Young celery alone, sliced and dressed with a rich salad mixture (see page 133) is excellent: it is still in some families served thus always with roast pheasants. Beet-root, baked or boiled, blanched endive, small salad-herbs which are easily raised at any time of the year, celery, and hardy lettuces, with any ready-dressed vegetable will supply salads through the winter. Cu- cumber-vinegar is an agreeable addition to these. FRENCH SALAD. In winter this is made principally of beautifully- blanched endive, washed delicately clean and broken into small branches with the fingers, then taken from the water and shaken dry in a basket kept for the pur- pose, or in a fine cloth; then arranged in the salad-bowl, and strewed with herbs (tarragon generally, when in season) minced small: the dressing is not added until just before the salad is eaten. For this, see page 134. In summer, young lettuces are substituted for the en- dive, and intermixed with a variety of herbs, some of which are not generally cultivated in England. SUFFOLK SALAD. Fill a salad bowl from half to three parts full with very tender lettuces shred small, and minced lean of ham, and hard-boiled eggs, or their yolks only, also minced, placed in alternate layers; dress the mixture with English salad-sauce, but do not pour it into the bowl until the instant of serving. A portion of cold chicken, cut in thin slices about the size of a shilling, may be added when convenient.

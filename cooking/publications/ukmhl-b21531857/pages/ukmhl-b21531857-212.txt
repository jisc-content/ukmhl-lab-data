Dissolve an ounce and a half of good butter in a saucepan, throw them into it with a little cayenne, and a slight sprink- ling of mace, and stew them softly, keeping them well shaken, from five to seven minutes; then turn them into a dish, spread them over it, and raise one end, that the liquid may drain from them.

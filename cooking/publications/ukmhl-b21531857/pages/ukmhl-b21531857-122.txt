£chap. II. MODERN COOKERY. 84 STEWED TROUT. (Good Common Receipt.) Melt three ounces of butter in a broad stew-pan, or well tinned iron saucepan, stir to it a tablespoonful of flour, some mace, cayenne, and nutmeg; lay in the fish after it has been emptied, washed very clean, and wiped perfectly dry ; shake it in the pan, that it may not stick, and when lightly browned on both sides, pour in three quarters of a pint of good veal stock, add a small bunch of parsley, one bay leaf, a roll of lemon-peel, and a little salt: stew the fish very gently from half to three quarters of an hour, or more, should it be unusually fine. Dish the trout, skim the fat from the grayy, and pass it through a hot strainer over the fish, which should be served immediately. A little acid can be added to the sauce at pleasure, and a glass of wine when it is con- sidered an improvement. This receipt is for one large, or for two middling-sized fish. We can recommend it as a good one, from our own experience. Butter, 3 ozs.; flour, 1 tablespoonful; seasoning of mace, cayenne, and nutmeg ;ij trout, 1 large, or 2 moderate sized; veal stock, f pint; parsley, small faggot; 1 bay-leaf; roll of lemon-rind ; little salt: \ to £ hour. TO BOIL PIKE. Take out the gills, empty and clean the fish very thoroughly, and soak it for half an hour with a cup of vinegar thrown into as much water as will cover it well, should there be any danger of its having a muddy taste. Wipe the inside dry, and fill it with oyster forcemeat, or with common veal forcemeat, made either with butter or with suet (for which, see Chapter VI.); curl the fish round, and fasten it with the tail in the mouth, lay it on to the drainer, cover it well with cold water, throw in some salt as soon as it boils, skim it well, and boil the fish gently from half to a whole hour, according to its size." Some persons prefer the scales taken off the pike

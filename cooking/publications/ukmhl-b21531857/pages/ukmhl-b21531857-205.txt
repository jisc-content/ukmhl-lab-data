STORE SAUCES. 107 CHAP. V.] Rinds large lemons, 2; sugar, 2 to 4 ozs.; bitter almonds, 1 oz* DRIED MUSHROOMS. Peel small, sound, freshly-gathered flaps, cut off the stems, and scrape out the fur entirely; then arrange the mushrooms singly on tins or dishes, and dry them as gra- dually as possible in a gentle oven. Put them, when they are done, into tin canisters, and store them where they will be secure from damp. French cooks give them a single boil in water, from which they then are well drained, and dried, as usual. When wanted for table, they should be put into cold gravy, slowly heated, and gently simmered, until they are tender. MUSHROOM POWDER. AVhen the mushrooms have been prepared with great nicety, and dried, as in the foregoing receipt, pound them to a very fine powder, sift it, and put it imme- diately into small and perfectly dry bottles; cork and seal them without delay, for if the powder be long ex- posed to the air, so as to imbibe any humidity, or if it be not well secured from it in the bottles, it will be likely to become putrid : much of that which is pur- chased, even at the best Italian warehouses, is found to be so, and, as it is sold at a very high price, it is a great economy, as well as a surer plan, to have it carefully prepared at home. It is an exceedingly useful store, and an elegant addition to many dishes and sauces. To insure its being good, the mushrooms should be gathered in dry weather, and, if any addition of spices be made to the powder (some persons mix with it a seasoning of mace and cayenne), they should be put into the oven for a while before they are used : but even these precautions will not be sufficient, unless the powder be stored in a very dry place after it is bottled. A teaspoonful of it, with a quarter-pint of strong veal-gravy, and as much cream, and a small dessertspoonful of flour, will make an excellent bechamel or white sauce.

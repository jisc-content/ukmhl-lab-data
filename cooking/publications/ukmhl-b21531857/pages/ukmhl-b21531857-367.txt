TO ROAST A HAUNCH OF VENISON. To give veni- son the flavour and the tender- ness so much prized by epi- cures, it must be well kept; and by taking the ne- cessary precautions it will hang a considerable time without detriment. Wipe it with soft dry cloths wherever the slightest moisture appears on the surface, and dust it plentifully with freshly-ground pepper or powdered ginger, to preserve it from the flies. The application of the pyroligneous acid would effectually protect it from these, as well as from the effects of the weather; but the joint must then be, not only well washed, but soaked some considerable time, and this would be injurious to it: the acid, therefore, should only be resorted to for the purpose of restoring to an eatable state that which would otherwise be lost, from having been kept beyond the point in which it is pos- sible to serve it. To prepare the venison for the spit, wash it slightly with tepid water, or merely wipe it thoroughly with damp cloths, and dry it afterwards with clean ones; then lay over the fat side a large sheet of thickly- buttered paper, and next a paste of flour and water about three-quarters of an inch thick ; cover this

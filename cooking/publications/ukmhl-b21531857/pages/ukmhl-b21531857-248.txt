210 Â£chap. VIII. MODERN COOKERY. STEWED BEEF STEAK. This may be cut from one to two inches thick, and the time of stewing it must be proportioned to its size. Dissolve a slice of butter in a large saucepan or stewpan, and brown the steak on both sides, moving it often that it may not burn ; then shake in a little flour, and when it is coloured pour in by degrees rather more than sufficient broth or water to cover the meat. When it boils, season it with salt, take off the scum, slice in one onion, a carrot or two, and half a turnip ; add a small bunch of sweet herbs, and stew the steak very softly from two hours and a half to three hours. A quarter of an hour before it is served, stir well into the gravy three teaspoonsful of rice flour smoothly mixed with a little cayenne, half a wineglassful of mushroom catsup, and a slight seasoning of spice. A teaspoonful of currie-powder, in addition, will improve both the flavour and the appearance of the sauce. The onion is sometimes browned with the meat, and the quantity is considerably increased. Eschalots may be used in- stead, where their strong flavour is approved. A few button-mushrooms, stewed from twenty to thirty minutes with the meat, will render the catsup un- necessary. Wine, or any favourite store sauce, can be added at will. 2j, to 3 hours. FRIED BEEF STEAK. We have little to add here to the directions of page 195, which are sufficient to enable the cook to send a dish of fried steaks to table properly dressed. Currie sauce, highly onioned, is frequently served with them. BEEF STEAK STEWED IN ITS OWN GRAVY. (Good and wholesome.') Trim all the fat and skin from a rump-steak of nearly an inch thick, and divide it once or twice; just dip it

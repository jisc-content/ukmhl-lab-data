509 CHAP. XX.] SWEET DISHES. PREPARED APPLE, OR QUINCE JUICE. Pour into a clean earthen pan two quarts of spring water, and throw into it as quickly as they can be pared, cored, and weighed, four pounds of nonsuches, pear- mains, Ripstone pippins, or any other good boiling- apples of fine flavour. When all are done stew them gently until they are well broken, but not reduced quite to pulp ; turn them into a jelly-bag, or strain the juice from them without pressure through a closely-woven cloth, which should be gathered over the fruit, tied, and suspended above a deep pan until the juice ceases to drop from it: this, if not very clear, must be rendered so before it is used for syrup or jelly, but for all other purposes once straining it will be sufficient. Quinces are prepared in the same way, and with the same pro- portions of fruit and water, but they must not be too long boiled or the juice will become red. We have found it answer well to have them simmered until they are perfectly tender, and then to leave them with their liquor in a bowl until the following day, wffien the juice will be rich and clear. They should be thrown into the water very quickly after they are pared and weighed, as the air will soon discolour them. Water, 2 quarts; apples or quinces, 4 lbs. COCOA-NUT-FLAVOURED MILK. (For sweet dishes, fyc.) Pare the dark outer rind from a very fresh nut, and grate it on a fine and exceedingly clean grater; to every three ounces pour a quart of new milk, and simmer them very softly for three-quarters of an hour, or more, that a full flavour of the nut may be imparted to the milk without its being much reduced; strain it through a fine sieve, or cloth, with sufficient pressure to leave the nut almost dry: it may then be used for blamange, custards, rice and other puddings, light cakes and bread. To each quart new milk, 3 ozs. grated cocoa-nut. f to 1 hour.

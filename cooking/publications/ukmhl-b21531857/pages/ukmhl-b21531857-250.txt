MODERN COOKERY. [[chap. yiii. 212 cloves in powder, each a dessertspoonful; mace, 1 tea- spoonful ; half as much cayenne : 2\ hours. Obs.â€”Sausage-meat, highly seasoned, eats well, baked as above. A larger portion of suet or of fat will render these cakes lighter, but will not otherwise improve them: they may be made of veal or of venison, but one third of mutton-suet or fat bacon should be mixed with this last. GERMAN STEW. Cut into about three-inch squares, two pounds and a half of the leaner part of the veiny piece of beef, or of any joint that is likely to be tender, and set it on to stew, with a pint and three quarters of cold broth, or water, and one large onion sliced. When these begin to boil, add a teaspoonful of salt, and a third as much of pepper, and let them simmer gently for an hour and a half. Have ready some young white cabbages, par- boiled ; press the water well from them, and lay them in with the beef; and let the whole stew for another hour. More onions, and a seasoning of mixed spices, or a few bits of lean bacon, or of ham, can be added to this stew when a higher flavour is desired; but it is very good without. Beef, 2\ lbs.; water, or broth, If pint; onion, 1 ; salt, 1 teaspoonful; third as much pepper : 11 hour. Par- boiled cabbages, 3 or 4 : 1 hour. WELSH STEW. Take the same proportions of beef, and broth or water, as for the German Stew. When they have simmered gently for an hour, add the white part of from twenty to thirty leeks, or two dozens of button onions, and five or six young mild turnips, cut in slices, a small lump of white sugar, nearly half a teaspoonful of white pepper, and more than twice as much salt. Stew the whole softly from an hour and a quarter, to an hour and a half, after the vegetables are added. Beef and water as above: 1 hour. Leeks, 20 to 30;

CHAP. XXI.] PRESERVES. 563 for an hour, keeping them almost constantly stirred from the bottom of the pan, to which they will otherwise be liable to stick and burn. Add half a pound of good sugar roughly powdered for each pound of the fruit, and boil the preserve quickly for twenty minutes, taking off the scum as it rises. The blanched kernels of part of the cherries may be added to the jam five minutes before it is taken from the fire. We can recommend this receipt as producing a firm preserve of fine colour and flavour, and very far superior to any that can be made by the more common method of boiling the fruit and sugar together from the beginning. Stoned cherries, 6 lbs.: 1 hour. Sugar, 3 lbs.: 20 minutes. Ohs.â€”Increase the proportion of sugar, when it is liked, to twelve or sixteen ounces, and diminish the boiling a quarter-hour before it is added, and ten minutes after. We have found almost invariably, that preserves made by the receipts we have given have been preferred to richer ones. TO DRY CHERRIES WITH SUGAR. (A quick and easy method.') Stone some fine, sound, Kentish or Flemish cherries, weigh and put them into a preserving pan, with six ounces of sugar reduced to powder to each pound of the fruit; set them over a moderate fire, and simmer them gently for nearly or quite twenty minutes, let them remain in the syrup till they are a little cooled, then turn them into a sieve, and before they are cold lay them singly on dishes, and dry them very gradually* as directed for other fruits. When the cherries are quite ripe the stones may generally be drawn out with the stalks, by pressing the fruit gently at the same time ; but when this method fails, they must be extracted with a new quill, cut round at the end; those of the very short-stalked, turnip-shaped cherry, which abounds, and is remarkably fine in many parts of Normandy, and

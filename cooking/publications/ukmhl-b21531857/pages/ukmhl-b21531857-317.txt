CHAP. X.] MUTTON. 279 Obs. The fat and trimmings of the mutton used for this and other dishes into which only the lean is admis- sible, may be turned to advantage by cutting the whole up rather small, and then boiling it in a quart of water to the pound, with a little spice, a bunch of herbs and some salt, until the fat is nearly dissolved: the liquid will then, if strained off and left till cold, make tolerable broth, and the cake of fat which is on the top, if again just melted and poured free of sediment into small pans, will serve excellently for common pies and for frying kitchen dinners.

When the addition of onion is liked, strew in two or three minced ones with the potatoes. Mutton cutlets, 2 lbs.; potatoes, 4 lbs.; pepper, \ oz. ; salt, 1 oz.; water, f pint: 2 hours.

CUTLETS OF COLD MUTTON. Trim into well-shaped cutlets, which should not be

654 MODERN COOKERY* [CHAP. XXVIH. Obs. 2.—For an invalid, especially when the diges- tion is impaired, butter should be altogether omitted from the bread; and eggs, which are often added to the finer sorts of rolls, are better avoided also. Obs. 3.—We must repeat our caution against milk or water of a scalding heat being mixed ever with the yeast; it should be warm, rather more so than when taken from the cow, but not much. BROWN BREAD. Make this by either of the foregoing receipts, with meal as it is called (that is to say, the wheat just as it is ground, either separated from the coarse bran or not, ac- cording to the quality of the bread required) instead of Hour. It ferments easily, and does not therefore require a very full proportion of yeast; and it absorbs more moisture than the flour: it also retains it longer, if pro- perly baked. The loaves should be well soaked in the oven, but not over dried. Obs.—The best bread we ever tasted was made in great part with rye-flour : this was in a provincial town of France. POTATO BREAD. One pound of good mealy potatoes, steamed or boiled ,very dry, in the ordinary way, or prepared by Captain Kater’s receipt (see Chapter XV.), and rubbed quite hot, through a coarse sieve, into a couple of pounds of flour, with which they should be well mixed, will pro- duce excellent bread, which will remain moist much longer than wdieaten bread made as usual. The yeast should be added immediately after the potatoes. An ounce or two of butter, an egg, and some new milk, will convert this bread into very superior rolls. GENEVA ROLLS. Break down very small three ounces of butter into a couple of pounds of flour; add a little salt, and set the

The whole of the coral may be used for the sauce when no portion of it is wanted for other purposes. GOOD OYSTER SAUCE.

Lift them out and beard them neatly ; add to the liquor three ounces of butter, smoothly mixed with a large dessertspoonful of flour ; stir these without ceasing until they boil, and are perfectly mixed; then add to them gradually a quarter-pint, or rather more, of new milk, or of thin cream (or equal parts of both), and continue the stirring until the sauce boils again; add a little salt, should it be needed, and a small quantity of cayenne in the finest powder; put in the oysters, and keep the saucepan by the side of the fire, until the whole is thoroughly hot, and begins to simmer, then turn the sauce into a well-heated tureen, and send it imme- diately to table.

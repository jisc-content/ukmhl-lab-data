CHAP. XXVIII.]] 65 3 BREAD, Flour, J bushel; salt (when it is liked), 4 to 6 ozs.; yeast, 1 pint unwashed, or J pint if purified; milk, or water, 2 quarts : 1 to 1 \ hour. Additional liquid as needed. BORDYKE BREAD. (Author's Receipt.) Mix with a gallon of flour a large teaspoonful of fine salt, make a hollow in the centre, and pour in two tablespoonsful of solid, well-purified yeast, gradually diluted with about two pints and a half of milk, and work it into a thick batter with the surrounding flour; j dust a little on the top, and leave it to rise from an hour to an hour and a half ; then knead it up with as much more warm skimmed milk as will render it quite firm and smooth without being very stiff; let it rise another hour, and divide it into three loaves; put them into square tins slightly buttered, or into round baking pans, and bake them about an hour and a quarter in a well-heated oven. The dough can be formed into household loaves if preferred, and sent to the oven in the usual way. When a finer and more spongy kind of bread is required for immediate eating, substitute new milk for skimmed, dissolve in it about an ounce of butter, leave it more liquid when the sponge is set, and let the whole be lightly kneaded into' a lithe dough; the bread thus made will be excellent when new, and for a day or so after it is baked, but it will become dry sooner than the other. Flour, 1 gallon; salt, 1 teaspoonful; skimmed milk, 2J pints: to rise from 1 to \\ hour. Additional milk, 1 to 2 pints: to rise 1 hour. 3 loaves, baked 1 hour and Obs. 1.â€”A few spoonsful of cream will wonderfully improve either of the above receipts, and sweet butter- milk substituted for the other will give to the bread the shortness of a cake : we would particularly recom- mend it for trial when it can be procured.

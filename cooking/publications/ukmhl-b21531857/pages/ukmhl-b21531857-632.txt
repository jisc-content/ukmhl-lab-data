MODERN COOKERY. 590 [CHAP. XXI. Prepared quince-juice, 2 lbs.; apples, 2 lbs. : j to 1 hour. Sugar, 1J lb. : 20 minutes. QUINCE-PASTE. If the full flavour of the quinces be desired, stew them sufficiently tender to press through a sieve in the pre- pared juice of page 509 ; otherwise, in just water enough to about three parts cover them; when they are soft quite through, lift them out, let them cool, and then pass them through a sieve; reduce them to a dry paste, over a very clear fire, and stir them constantly; then weigh the fruit, and mix it with an equal proportion of pounded sugar, or with sugar boiled to candy height (we find the effect nearly the same, whichever method be pursued), and stir the paste without intermission until it is again so dry as to quit the pan and adhere to the spoon in one large ball; press it into shallow pans or dishes-; cut it, as soon as cold, into small squares, and, should they seem to require it, dry them with a very gentle degree of heat, and when they are again cold store them in tin cases with well-dried foolscap paper between them ; the paste may be moulded, when more convenient, and kept until it is wanted for table in a very dry place. In France, where the fruit is admirably confected, the p&te des coigns, or quince-paste, is some- what less boiled than we have directed, and dried afterwards in the sun, or in an extremely gentle oven, in square rims of tin, about an inch and a half deep, placed upon clean plates. JELLY OF SIBERIAN CRABS. This fruit makes a jelly of beautiful colour, and of pleasant flavour also ; it may be stored in small moulds of ornamental shape, and turned out for a dessert dish. Take off the stalks, weigh and wash the crabs, then to each pound and a half, add a pint of water, and boil them gently until they are broken, but do not allow them to fall to a pulp. Pour the whole into a jelly- bag, and when the juice is quite transparent, weigh it,

222 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. VIII. or the thick flank of beef, mix two ounces of saltpetre with the same quantity of coarse sugar; rub the meat with them in every part, and let it remain two days, then add one pound of bay-salt, four ounces of common salt, and one ounce of ground black pepper. Hub these ingredients thoroughly into the beef, and in four days pour over it a pound of treacle; rub and turn it daily for a fortnight; drain, and send it to be smoked. When wanted for table, lay it in plenty of cold water, boil it very slowly, and press it under a heavy weight while hot. A slice of this beef, from which the edges have been carefully trimmed, will serve to flavour soups or gravies as well as ham. Beef, 14 lbs.; saltpetre and coarse sugar, each 2 ozs. : 2 days. Bay-salt, 1 lb.; common salt, 4 ozs.; pepper, 1 oz. : 4 days. Treacle, 1 lb.: 14 days. Obs.—Three quarters of a pound of coarse sugar may be rubbed into the meat at first, and the treacle may be altogether omitted; cloves and mace, too, may be added in the same proportion as for spiced beef. COLLARED BEEF. Only the thinnest part of the flank, or the ribs, which are not so generally used for it, will serve conveniently for collaring. The first of these should be hung in a damp place for a day or two, to soften the outer skin ; then rubbed with coarse sugar, and left a couple of days; when, for eight pounds of the meat, one ounce of salt- petre, and half a pound of salt should be added. In ten days it will be fit to dress. The bones and tough inner skin must be removed, and the beef sprinkled thickly on the under side with parsley and other savoury herbs shred small, before it is rolled, which should be done very tightly : it must then be secured with a cloth, and bound as closely as possible wdtli broad tape. It will require nearly or quite five hours’ gentle boiling, and should be placed while hot under a weight, or in a press, without having the tape and cloth removed

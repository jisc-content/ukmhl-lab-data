136 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. IV. two or three tablespoonsful of oil and two of vinegar. Should the sauce be curdled, pour it by degrees to the yolk of a raw egg, stirring it well round as directed for the Mayonnaise. A spoonful of tarragon, cucumber, or eschalot-vinegar may be added with very good effect; and to give it increased relish, a teaspoonful of cavice, or a little of Harvey’s sauce, and a dessertspoonful of Chili vinegar may be thrown into it.

FENNEL SAUCE.

Fennel, small handful; 10 minutes, or till quite tender. Melted butter, \ to \ pint; little salt. Obs.—The French use good pale veal gravy thickened with flour and butter for this sauce. PARSLEY AND BUTTER. Proceed exactly as for the fennel, but boil the parsley four or five minutes less; and be careful to press the water from it thoroughly. For an improved sauce, substitute bechamel or white melted butter for the

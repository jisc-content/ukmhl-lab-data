CHAP. VII.] BOILING, ROASTING, &C. 185 may be removed, and the whiteness of either will be better preserved. Turkeys, fowls, sweetbreads, calf's brains, cauliflowers, and artichoke bottoms, are the articles for which the poelee and the llanc are more especially used in refined foreign cookery; the reader will judge by the following receipts, how far they are admissible into that of the economist. Poelee. Cut into large dice two pounds of lean veal, and two pounds of fat bacon, cured without saltpetre, two large carrots, and two onions ; to these add half a pound of fresh butter, put the whole into a stewpan, and stir it with a wooden spoon over a gentle fire, until the veal is very white, and the bacon is partially melted; then pour to them three pints of clear boiling broth or water, throw in four cloves, a small bunch or two of thyme and parsley, a bay-leaf, and a few corns of white pepper; boil these gently for an hour and a half, then strain the poelee through a fine sieve, and set it by in a cool place. Use instead of water for boiling, the various articles we have already named ; it will answer for several in suc- cession, and will remain good for many days. Some cooks order a pound of butter in addition to the bacon, and others substitute beef-suet in part for this last. A Blanc. Put into a stewTpan one pound of fat bacon, rasped, one pound of beef-suet cut small, and one pound of butter, the strained juice of two lemons, a couple of bay- leaves, three cloves, three carrots, and three onions divided into dice, and less than half a pint of water. Simmer these gently, keeping them often stirred, until the fat is well melted, and the water has evaporated ; then pour in rather more than will be required for the dish which is to be cooked in the blanc; boil it softly until all the ingredients have given out their full flavour, skim it well, add salt if needed, and strain it off for use. A calf s head is often boiled in this.

CHAP. IX.] VEAL. 259 Hour and an equal quantity of currie-powder, with a small slice of butter; shake these in the pan for about five minutes, pour to them a cup of gravy or boiling water; add salt, cayenne, if required, and the strained juice of half a lemon; simmer the whole till well- fiavoured, and pour it round the cutlets. A better plan is, to have some good currie sauce ready prepared to send to table with this dish; which may likewise be served with only well-made common cutlet-gravy, from the pan, when much of the pungent flavour of the currie- powder is not desired. Bread-crumbs, 4 ozs. ; salt, 1 teaspoonful; currie- powder, 1 tablespoonful; veal, 2 lbs.: 12 to 14 minutes. Obs.â€”These cutlets may be broiled; they should then be well beaten first, and dipped into clarified butter, instead of egg, before they are passed through the curried seasoning. VEAL CUTLETS, OR COLLOPS. (A la Frangaise.) Cut the veal into small thin collops of equal size, arrange them evenly in a saute-pan, or in a small frying pan; dust a little fine salt and white pepper over them, and grate over a small portion of nutmeg, when it is liked; clarify an ounce or two of butter with a gentle heat, pour it over the veal, and set the pan aside until the dinner hour, then toss the cutlets over a clear fire till they are of a fine amber-colour, which will be in from three to four minutes : drain and dish them quickly. These are excellent, even without any gravy, but some may be made in the pan quickly, by throwing in a little of that which flows from roast meat, or a morsel of any other jellied gravy, or stock, with a squeeze of lemon, and a little cayenne. 3 to 4 minutes.

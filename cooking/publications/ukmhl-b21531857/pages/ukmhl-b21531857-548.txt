506 [CHAP. XX. MODERN COOKERY. CHAPTER XX. SWEET DISHES. White and Rose-coloured Jelly. TO PREPARE CALF’S FEET STOCK.* The feet are usually sent in from the butcher’s ready to dress, but as a matter of economy-}- or convenience it is sometimes desirable to have them altogether prepared by the cook. Dip them into cold water, lay them into a deep pan, and sprinkle equally over them on both sides some rosin in fine powder; pour in as much boil- ing water as will cover them well, and let them remain for a minute or two untouched; then scrape the hair clean from them with the edge of a knife. When this is done, wash them very thoroughly both in hot and in cold water; divide them at the joint, split the claws, and take away the fat that is between them. Should the feet be large, put a gallon of cold water to the four, but from a pint to a quart less if they be of moderate size or small. Boil them gently down until the flesh has parted entirely from the bones, and the liquor is reduced nearly or quite half; strain, and let it stand till cold; remove every particle of fat from the top before it is used, and be careful not to take the sediment. Calf’s feet, (large) 4 ; water, 1 gallon : 6 to 7 hours. * For fuller and better directions for this, see page 239, Chapter IX. t They are sold at a much lower price when not cleared from the hair.

567 CHAP. XXI.] PRESERVES. preserve will be firmer, and require less boiling, if one- fourth of red or white currant juice be mixed with that of the strawberries, but the flavour will not then be quite so perfect. A superior jelly to this is made by taking an equal weight of juice and sugar, and by boiling the latter to candy-height, before the juice (which should previously be boiled five minutes) is added to it; and when they have been stirred together off the fire until this is entirely dissolved, boiling the whole quickly from ten to twenty minutes; the time required varying very much from the difference which is found in the quality of the fruit. Fruit simmered, 4 to 5 minutes. Juice of straw- berries, 4 lbs. : 20 minutes. Sugar, 3 lbs. : 20 minutes. Or : juice of strawberries, 4 lbs. : 5 minutes. Sugar, boiled to candy-height, 4 lbs.: 10 to 20 minutes. ANOTHER VERY FINE STRAWBERRY JELLY. Express the juice from the fruit through a cloth, strain it clear, weigh, and stir to it an equal proportion of the finest sugar, dried and reduced to powder; when tiiis is dissolved, place the preserving-pan over a very clear fire, and stir the jelly often until it boils; clear it carefully from scum, and boil it quickly from fifteen to twenty-five minutes. Equal weight of strawberry-juice and sugar : 15 to 25 minutes. Obs.â€”This receipt is for a moderate quantity of the preserve : a very small portion will require much less time. TO PRESERVE STRAWBERRIES OR RASPBERRIES, FOR CREAMS OR ICES, WITHOUT BOILING. Let the fruit be gathered in the middle of a warm day, in very dry weather; strip it from the stalks directly, weigh it, turn it into a bowl or deep pan, and bruise it gently ; mix with it an equal weight of fine dry sifted sugar, and put it immediately into small, wide-necked

MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. IY. 333 ASPARAGUS SAUCE, FOR LAMB CHOPS. Cut the green tender points of some young asparagus into half-inch lengths, wash them well, drain and throw them into plenty of boiling salt and water. When they are quite tender, which mtiy be in from ten to fifteen minutes, turn them into a hot strainer and drain the water thoroughly from them ; put them at the instant of serving into half a pint of thickened veal gravy (see Sauce Tournee), mixed with the yolks of a couple of eggs, and well seasoned with salt and cayenne, or white pepper; or, into an equal quantity of good melted butter : add to this last a squeeze of lemon- juice, The asparagus will become yellow if re-boiled, or if left long in the sauce before it is boiled. Asparagus points, \ pint: boiled 10 to 15 minutes, longer if not quite tender. Thickened veal-gravy, \ pint; yolks of eggs, 2. Or: good melted butter, \ pint; lemon-juice, small dessertspoonful, seasoning of salt and white pepper. GREEN MINT SAUCE, FOR ROAST LAMB. The mint for this sauce should be fresh and young, for the leaves when old are tough. Strip them from the stems, wash them with great nicety, and drain them on a sieve or dry them in a cloth. Chop them very fine, put them into a sauce-tureen, and to three heaped tablespoonsful of the mint add two of pounded sugar, mix them well, and then add gradually six tablespoonsful of good vinegar. The sauce made thus is excellent, but Lisbon sugar can be used for it when preferred, and all the proportions can be varied to the taste. It is commonly served too liquid, and not sufficiently sweetened ; and it will be found much more wholesome, and generally far more palatable made by this receipt. Young mint minced, 3 heaped tablespoonsful; pounded sugar, 2 tablespoonsful; vinegar, 6 table- spoonsful.

A hare may be rendered far more plump in appear- ance, and infinitely easier to carve, by taking out the bones of the back and thighs, or of the former only : in removing this, a very sharp knife should be used, and much care will be required to avoid cutting through the skin just over the spine, as it adheres closely to the bone. Nearly double the usual quantity of forcemeat must be prepared, and with this restore the legs to their original shape, and fill the body, which should previously be lined with delicate slices of the nicest bacon, of which the rind and edges have been trimmed away. Sew up the hare, truss it as usual; lard it or not, as is most con- venient, keep it basted plentifully with butter while roasting, and serve it with the customary sauce. We have found two tablespoonsful of the finest currant jelly, melted in a half-pint of rich brown gravy, an acceptable accompaniment to hare, where the taste has been in favour of a sweet sauce. To remove the back-bone, clear from it first the flesh in the inside; lay this back to the right and left from the centre of the bone to the tips ; then work the knife on the upper side quite to the spine, and when the whole is detached except the skin which adheres to this, sepa- rate the bone at the first joint from the neck-bone (or ribs; we know not how more correctly to describe it), and pass the knife with caution under the skin down the middle of the back. The directions for boning the thighs of a fowl will answer equally for a hare, and we therefore refer the reader to them. STEWED HARE. Wash and soak the hare thoroughly, wipe it very dry, cut it down into joints, dividing the largest, flour and

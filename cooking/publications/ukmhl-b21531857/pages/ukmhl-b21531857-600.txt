Preserved fruits just dipped into hot water to take off the syrup, then well drained and dried, may be arranged with good effect in the centre of the gooseberry jelly if the glasses be rather less than half filled before they are laid in, and the jelly just set: the remainder must be kept liquid to fill them up. The sugar may be added to the juice at first, and the preserve boiled from twenty-five to thirty-five minutes, but the colour will not then be so good. When the fruit abounds the juice may be drawn from it with very little water, as directed for apples, page 586, when it will require much less boiling. Gooseberries, 6 lbs. ; water, 4 pints: 20 to SO minutes. Juice boiled quickly, 15 minutes; to each pound, 1 lb. sugar : 15 to 20 minutes. GREEN GOOSEBERRY JAM. (Firm and of good colour.') Cut the stalks and tops from the fruit, weigh and bruise it slightly, boil it for six or seven minutes, keep- ing it well turned during the time; then to every three pounds of gooseberries add two and a half of sugar beaten to powder, and boil the preserve quickly for three-quarters of an hour. It must be constantly stirred, and carefully cleared from scum. Green gooseberries, 6 lbs. : 6 to 7 minutes. Sugar, 5 lbs. : j hour. TO DRY GREEN GOOSEBERRIES. Take the finest green gooseberries, fully grown, and freshly gathered ; cut off the buds, split them across the tops half way down, and with the small end of a tea or of an egg spoon, scoop out seeds. Boil together for fifteen minutes a pound and a half of the finest sugar, and a pint of water; skim this syrup thoroughly and throw into it a pound of the seeded gooseberries; simmer them from five to seven minutes, when they ought to be clear and tender; when they are so, lift them out, and throw as many more into the syrup;

CHAP. II.] FISH. 73 very smoothly mixed with a little milk, may be stirred to the sauce (should it require thickening), before the lemon-juice is added. Turbot and brill may also be dressed by this receipt, time, proportioned to their size, being, of course, allowed for them. Soles 3 or 4 : boiled in water 2 minutes. Cream, |- to whole pint; salt, mace, cayenne : fish stewed, 6 to 10 minutes. Juice of half a lemon. Obs. â€”In Cornwall the fish is laid at once into thick clotted cream, and stewed entirely in it; but this method gives to the sauce, which ought to be extremely delicate, a coarse fishy flavour which the previous boil in water prevents, At Penzance, mullet, after being scaled, are divided in the middle, just covered with cold water, and softly boiled, with the addition of branches of parsley, pepper, and salt, until the flesh of the back parts easily from the bone ; clotted cream, minced parsley, and lemon-juice are then added to the sauce, and the mullet are dished with the heads and tails laid even to the thick parts of the back, where the fish were cut asunder. Hake, too, is there divided at every joint (having previously been scaled), dipped into egg, then thickly covered with fine bread-crumbs mixed with plenty of minced parsley, and fried a fine brown. TO FRY WHITINGS. Clean, skin, and dry them thoroughly in a cloth, fasten their tails to their mouths, brush them equally* over with beaten eggs, and cover them with the finest bread-crumbs, mixed with a little flour; fry them a clear golden brown in plenty of boiling lard, drain and dry them well, dish them on a hot napkin and serve them with good melted butter, and the sauce-cruets, as with well-made shrimp or anchovy sauce. A small half-teaspoonful of salt should be beaten up with the eggs used in preparing the whitings: two will be suffi- cient for half a dozen fish. 5 to 8 minutes, according to their size.

448 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XVII. boil the pudding gently for twenty-five minutes, and let it stand four or five more before it is turned out, that it may not spread in the dish. Serve it with wine sauce. New milk, J pint; sugar, 1 dessertspoonful; fresh eggs, 3 : 25 minutes. COMMON CUSTARD PUDDING. Beat three eggs, whisk and put them into a pint basin, add to them sufficient milk to fill it; then strain, flavour and sweeten it with fine sugar; boil the pudding very softly for an exact half hour, let it stand a few minutes, dish, and serve it with sugar sifted over, and sweet sauce in a tureen, or send stewed gooseberries, currants, or cher- ries to table with it. A small quantity of lemon-brandy, or of ratifia can be added, to give it flavour, when it is made, or the sugar with which it is sweetened may be rasped on a lemon or orange, then crushed and dissolved in the milk ; from an ounce and a half to two ounces will be sufficient for general taste. PRINCE ALBERTS PUDDING. Beat to a cream half a pound of fresh butter,* and mix with it by degrees an equal quantity of pounded loaf- sugar, dried and sifted ; add to these, after they have been well beaten together, first the yolks, and then the whites of five fresh eggs, which have been thoroughly whisked apart; now strew lightly in half a pound of the finest flour, dried and sifted, and last of all, half a pound of jar raisins weighed after they are stoned. Put these ingredients, perfectly mixed, into a well-buttered mould, or floured cloth, and boil the pudding three hours. Serve it with punch-sauce. We recommend a little pounded mace, or the grated rind of a small lemon, to vary the flavour of this excellent pudding; and that when a mould is used, slices of candied peel should be laid rather thickly over it after it is buttered. • _ *■ * The ingredients may be mixed like those of the Sutherland puddings, page 472, with as good an effedt, the raisins being- thrown in last.

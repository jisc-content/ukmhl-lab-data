166 [chap. Y. MODERN COOKERY. CAYENNE VINEGAR. Put from a quarter to half an ounce of the best cay- enne pepper into a bottle, and pour on it a pint of pale vinegar. Cork it closely, and shake it well every two or three days. It may remain any length of time before it is poured off, but will very soon be ready for use. From being so extremely pungent, it is, for some pur- poses, preferable to Chili vinegar, as the cayenne sea- soning can be given with less of acid. It may be made of any degree of strength. We warn the young house- keeper against using essence of cayenne (or cayenne steeped in brandy) for flavouring any dishes, as the brandy is very perceptible always, and gives an exceed- ingly coarse taste. Good cayenne pepper, i to \ oz.; vinegar, 1 pint : infuse from 2 weeks to 12 months. LEMON BRANDY. (For flavouring sweet dishes.) Fill any sized wide-necked bottle lightly with the very thin rinds of fresh lemons, and cover them with good brandy; let them remain three weeks, then strain off the spirit and keep it well corked for use : a few apricot-kernels blanched and infused with the lemon- rind will give an agreeable flavour. ANOTHER STORE FLAVOURING FOR PUDDINGS OR CAKES. Rasp on from two to four ounces of sugar the rinds of a couple of fine lemons, reduce the lumps to powder, and add it gradually to, and pound it with, an ounce of bitter almonds, blanched and wiped very dry. When these have been beaten to a fine paste, and the whole is well blended, press the mixture into a small pan, tie a paper over, and keep it for use. The proportions can be varied at pleasure, and the quantities increased : from a teaspoonful to three times as much can be mixed with the ingredients for a pudding. Cakes require more in proportion to their bulk.

MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XII. 322 leaves of pastry, fried or baked. An excellent variety of this dish is made also by covering the mince thickly with very fine bread-crumbs, moistening them with clarified butter, and giving them colour with a sala- mander, or in a quick oven. The dish must then be deep.* « COLD FOWLS, EN FRITURE. •Cut into joints, and take the skin from some, cold fowls, lay them into a deep dish, strew over them a little fine salt and cayenne, add the juice of a lemon, and let them remain for an hour, moving them occasionally, that they may all absorb a portion of the acid ; then dip them one by one into some French batter (see page 154), and fry them a pale brown over a gentle fire. Serve them garnished with very green crisped parsley. A few drops of eschalot vinegar may be mixed with the lemon- juice which is poured to the fowls, or slices of raw onion or eschalot, and small branches of sweet herbs may be laid amongst them, and cleared off before they are dipped into the batter. Gravy made of the trimmings, thickened, and well-flavoured, may be sent to table with them in a tureen, and dressed bacon (see page 299), in a dish apart. GRILLADE OF COLD FOWLS. Carve and soak the remains of roast fowls as above, wipe them dry, dip them into clarified butter, and then into fine bread-crumbs, and broil them gently over a very clear fire. A little finely minced lean of ham, or grated lemon-peel, with a seasoning of cayenne, salt, and mace, mixed with the crumbs, will vary this dish agreeably. When fried, instead of broiled, the fowls may be dipped into yolk of egg, instead of butter, but this renders them too dry for the gridiron. COLD FOWLS. {The housekeepers receipt. A supper dish.)

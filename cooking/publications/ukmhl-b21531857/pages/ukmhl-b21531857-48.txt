12 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. I. ened with six ounces of fresh butter, worked up very smoothly with five of flour. In twenty minutes after- wards, a tablespoonful of the best soy, half a pint of sherry, and a little cayenne may be added to the soup, which will then be ready to serve. VERMICELLI SOUP. {Potage au Vermicelle.') Drop very lightly, and by degrees, six ounces of vermicelli, broken rather small, into three quarts of boiling bouillon, or clear gravy soup ; let it simmer half an hour over a gentle fire, and stir it often. This is the common French mode of making vermicelli soup, and we can recommend it as a particularly good one for family use. In England it is customary to soak, or to blanch the vermicelli, then to drain it well, and to stew it for a shorter time in the soup: the quantity, also, must be reduced quite two ounces, to suit modern taste. Bouillon, or gravy-soup, 3 quarts ; vermicelli, 6 ozs. ; 30 minutes. Or, soup, 3 quarts; vermicelli, 4 ozs.; blanched in boiling water 5 minutes; stewed in soup 10 to 15 minutes. SEMOULINA SOUP. {Soape a la Semoule.) Semoulina is used in the same way as the vermi- celli. It should be dropped very lightly and by degrees into the boiling soup, which should be stirred all the time it is being added, and very frequently after- wards ; indeed, it should scarcely be quitted for a moment until it is ready for table. Skim it carefully, and let it simmer from twenty to five and twenty minutes. This, when the semoulina can be procured good and fresh,* is, to our taste, an excellent soup. * We shall indicate to our readers, in another partof the volume, where this and various other ingredients can be obtained, of the best quality.

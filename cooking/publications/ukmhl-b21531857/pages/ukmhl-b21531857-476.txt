MODERN COOKERY. 434 [CHAP. XVI. by degrees, four well whisked eggs, beat the mixture a little, and put it into patty-pans lined with fine paste : they should be only three parts filled. Bake the tartlets from ten to twelve minutes. CURRANT-JELLY TARTLETS, OR CUSTARDS. Put four tablespoonsful of the best currant-jelly into a basin, and stir to it gradually twelve spoonsful of beaten egg; if the preserve be rich and sweet, no sugar will be required. Line some pans with paste rolled very thin, fill them with the custard, and bake them about ten minutes.* RASPBERRY PUFFS. Roll out thin some fine puff-paste, cut it in rounds or squares of equal size, lay some raspberry jam into each, moisten the edges of the paste, fold and press them together, and bake the puffs from ten to fifteen minutes. Strawberry, or any other jam will serve for them equally well. STORE MIXTURE FOR LEMON TARTLETS, Which will remain good for a year or two. Put into a very clean stewpan or saucepan a quarter- pound of fresh butter, a pound of good sugar, beaten to powder, the yolks of six eggs, and the whites of four, whisked and strained, the grated rinds of two large lemons, and the strained juice of three; keep the whole stirred over a gentle fire until it is as thick as good cream. When it is quite cold, pour it into small jars or pans, and tie paper over it. When required for table, put it into patty-pans lined with thin puff-paste, and bake the cheese-cakes from fifteen to eighteen minutes. This is a very convenient store, especially quite in the country, where it is sometimes difficult to obtain the fresh fruit. The proportions may be varied so that the lemon shall predominate more or less, according to the taste ; and the rinds may be rasped on part of the sugar before it is pounded ; or they may be boiled tender, and * Strawberry or raspberry jelly will answer admirably for these.

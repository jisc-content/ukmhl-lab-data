85 CIIAP. II.] FISH when it is prepared for this mode of dressing ; and many cooks still put the fish into boiling water, well salted and skimmed. Serve it with plain melted butter, the sauce- cruets, and a lemon ; or with Dutch, brown caper, or anchovy sauce. Moderate sized, \ hour ; large, 1 hour. Obs.â€”We must repeat that it is impossible to give for fish which varies so much in quality as wTell as in size, directions for the exact time which is required to cook it; a few minutes, more or less, must often be allowed ; and it should always be watched attentively, and lifted from the water as soon as it is done, TO BAKE PIKEo (Common Receipt.) Pour warm water over the outside of the fish, and wipe it very clean with a coarse cloth drawn from the head downwards, that the scales may not be disturbed; then wash it well in cold water, empty, and clean the inside with the greatest nicety, fill it either with the common forcemeat. No. 1, or with No. 4, of Chapter YI, sew it up, fasten the tail to the mouth, give it a slight dredging of flour, stick small bits of butter thickly over it, and bake it from half to three quarters of an hour, should it be of moderate size, and upwards of an hour, if it be large. Should there not be sufficient sauce with it in the dish, plain melted butter, and a lemon, or anchovy sauce may be sent to table with it. When more convenient, the forcemeat may be omitted, and a little fine salt and cayenne, with some bits of butter, put into the inside of the fish, which will then require rather less baking. A buttered paper should always be laid over it in the oven, should the outside appear likely to become too highly coloured, or too dry, before the fish is done; and it is better to wrap quite small pike in buttered paper at once, before they are sent to the oven. Moderate sized pike, SO to 45 minutes; large pike, 1 hour to 1J.

XXY. resembles them in appearance, called the orange pippin (this is very plentiful in the county of Kent), pared and cored, but without being divided ; strew amongst them some small strips of very thin fresh lemon-rind, and throw on them, nearly at the top, half a pound of very good Lisbon sugar, and set the jar, with the cover tied on, for some hours, or for a night, into a very slow oven. The apples will be extremely good, if not too quickly baked: they should remain entire, but be perfectly tender, and clear in appearance. Add a little lemon- juice when the season is far advanced. Apples, 2 quarts; rind, quite small lemon; sugar ^ lb.: 1 night in slow oven ; or some hours baking in a very gentle one. Obs.â€”These apples may be served hot or cold for a second course dish; or they will answer admirably ta fill Gabrielles pudding. TO BAKE PEARS. Wipe some large sound iron pears, arrange them on a dish with the stalk end upwards, put them into the oven after the bread is drawn, and let them remain all night. If well baked, they will be excellent, very sweet, and juicy, and much finer in flavour than those which are stewed or baked with sugar : the bon chretien pear also is delicious baked thus. STEWED PEARS. Pare, cut in halves, and core a dozen fine iron pears, put them into a close shutting stewpan with some thin strips of lemon-rind, half a pound of sugar, in lumps, as much water as will nearly cover them, and should a very bright colour be desired, a dozen grains of cochineal, bruised, and tied in a muslin; stew the fruit as gently as possible, from four to six hours, or longer, should it not be very tender. The Chaumontel pear, which some- times falls in large quantities before it is ripe, is excel- lent, if first baked until tolerably tender, and then stewed in a thin syrup.

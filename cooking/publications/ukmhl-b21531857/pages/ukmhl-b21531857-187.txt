GIIAP. IV.] SAUCES. 149 celery sauce is made by simply stewing the celery, cut into inch-lengths, in butter, until it begins to be tender ; and then adding a spoonful of flour, which must be al- lowed to brown a little, and half a pint of good broth or beef gravy, with a seasoning of pepper or cayenne. Celery, 3 to 5 heads: 20 minutes. Yeal broth, or gravy, -1 pint: 20 to 40 minutes. Butter, 11 oz. ; flour, 1 dessertspoonful; cream, | pint, or 3 yolks of eggs. WHITE CHESNUT SAUCE, Strip the outer skin from six ounces of sound, sweet chesnuts, then throw them into boiling water, and let them simmer for two or three minutes, when the second skin will easily peel off. Add to them three quarters of a pint of good cold veal-gravy, and a few strips of lemon peel, and let them stew gently for an hour and a quarter. Press them with the gravy through a hair-sieve reversed, and placed over a deep dish or pan, as they are much more easily rubbed through thus than in the usual way: a wooden spoon should be used in preference to any other for the process. Add a little cayenne, and mace, some salt if needed, and about six tablespoonsful of rich cream. Keep the sauce stirred until it boils, and serve it immediately. Chesnuts without their rinds, 6 ozs. ; veal gravjr, J pint; rind of ^ lemon: 1^ hour. Salt; spice; cream, 6 tablespoonsful. Ohs.â€”This sauce may be served with turkey, with fowls, or with veal cutlets stewed. BROWN CHESNUT SAUCE. Substitute rich brown gravy for the veal-stock, omit the lemon-rind and cream ; heighten the seasonings and mix the chesnuts with a few spoonsful of Espagnole or highly-flavoured gravy after they are passed through the sieve.

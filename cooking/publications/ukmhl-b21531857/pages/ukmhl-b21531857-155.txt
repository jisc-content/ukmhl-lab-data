SAUCES. 117 CHAP. IV.] A LESS EXPENSIVE BECHAMEL. This may be made very good without any meat. Slice a large carrot, and a couple of small onions into a stewpan, and set them over a slow fire, with three ounces of butter, and a large handful of mushroom- buttons, nicely cleaned, when they can be procured, for with us they do not abound so commonly as in France. When these have stewed for half an hour, or until the butter is nearly dried up, stir in two tablespoonsful of flour, and pour in a pint of new milk, a little at a time, shaking the stewpan well round, that the sauce may be smooth. Boil the bechamel gently for half an hour; add a little salt, and cayenne; strain, and reduce it, if not quite thick, or pour it boiling to the yolks of two fresh eggs. ANOTHER COMMON BECHAMEL. Cut half a pound of veal, and a slice of lean ham into small bits, and stew them in butter, with vegetables, as directed in the foregoing receipt: stir in the same pro- portion of flour, then add the milk, and let the sauce boil very gently for an hour. It should not be allowed to thicken too much before it is strained. Obs.â€”Common bechamel, with the addition of a spoonful of made-mustard, is an excellent sauce for boiled mutton. RICH MELTED BUTTER. This is more particularly required in general for lobster sauce, when it is to be served with turbot or brill, and for good oyster sauce as well. Salmon is itself so rich, that less butter is needed for it than for sauce which is to accompany a drier fish. Mix to a very smooth batter a dessertspoonful of flour, a half saltspoon- ful of salt, and half a pint of cold water; put these into a delicately clean saucepan, with from four to six ounces of well flavoured butter, cut into small bits, and shake the sauce strongly round, almost without cessation.

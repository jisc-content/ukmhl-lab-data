Nearly half a pint of mushrooms minced, and stewed white in a little butter, may be mixed with the veal instead of the oysters ; or should they be very small they may be added to it whole : from ten to twelve minutes will be sufficient to make them tender. Balls of delicately fried oyster-forcemeat laid round the dish will give another good variety of it.

Pour boiling on an ounce and a half of fine bread- crumbs nearly half a pint of good veal-stock or gravy, and let them stand till cool; mix with them then, two ounces of beef-suet shred very small, half a pound of cold roast veal carefully trimmed from the brown edges, skin, and fat, and finely minced ; the grated rind of half a lemon, nearly a teaspoonful of salt, a little cayenne, the third of a teaspoonful of mace or nutmeg, and four well-beaten eggs. Whisk up the whole well together, put it into a buttered dish, and bake it from three quarters of an hour to an hour. Cream may be used instead of gravy when more convenient, but this last will give the better flavour. A little clarified but- ter, put into the dish before the other ingredients are poured in, will be an improvement.

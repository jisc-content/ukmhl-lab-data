[CHAP. XXI. MODERN COOKERY. 572 in the usual way, will be found a very fine one if the following directions for it be observed; it will be ex- tremely transparent and bright in colour, and will retain perfectly the flavour of the fruit. Take the currants at the height of their season, the finest that can be had, free from dust, but gathered on a dry day ; strip them with great care from the stalks, weigh and put them into a preserving pan with three pounds of the best sugar reduced to powder to four pounds of the fruit; stir them gently over a brisk clear fire, and boil them quickly for exactly eight minutes from the first full boil. As the jam is apt to rise over the top of the pan, it is better not to fill it more than two-thirds, and if this precaution should not be sufficient to prevent it, it must be lifted from the fire and held away for an instant. To many tastes, a still finer jam than this (which we find sufficiently sweet) may be made with an equal weight of fruit and sugar boiled together for seven minutes. There should be great exactness with respect to the time, as both the flavour and the brilliant colour of the preserve will be injured by longer boiling. Red currants (without stalks), 4 lbs.; fine sugar, 3 lbs.: boiled fast, 8 minutes. Or, fruit and sugar equal weight: 7 minutes. VERY FINE WHITE CURRANT JELLY. The fruit for this jelly should be very white, per- fectly free from dust, and picked carefully from the stalks. To every pound add eighteen ounces of double- refined sifted sugar, and boil them together quickly for six minutes ; throw in the strained juice of a sound fresh lemon, or of two, should the quantity of preserve be large; boil it two minutes longer; pour it into a delicately clean sieve, and finish it by the directions given for the Norman red currant jelly. White currants, 6 lbs.; highly-refined sugar, 6 j lbs. : 6 minutes. Juice of 2 moderate-sized lemons: 2 minutes.

APPENDIX. 659 lined with wafer-paper: a pint and a half of cream, when flavoured and whisked, will fill a large basket of this kind. AN EXCELLENT TRIFLE. Take equal parts of wine and brandy, about a wine- glassful of each, or two-thirds of good sherry or Madeira, and one of spirit, and soak in the mixture three sponge biscuits, and half a pound of macaroons and ratifias; cover the bottom of the trifle-dish with part of these, and pour upon them a pint of rich boiled custard made with six eggs, and about three-quarters of a pint of milk and cream ;* lay the remainder of the soaked cakes upon it, and pile over the whole, to the depth of two or three inches, the whipped syllabub of page 532, previously well drained; then sweeten and flavour slightly with wine only, less than half a pint of thin cream (or of cream and milk mixed) ; wash and wipe the whisk, and whip it to the lightest possible froth : take it off with a kimmer and heap it gently over the trifle. Macaroons and ratifias, \ lb.; wine and brandy mixed, i pint; rich boiled custard, 1 pint; whipped syllabub, (see page 532) ; light froth to cover the whole, short \ pint of cream and milk mixed; sugar, dessertspoonful ; wine, \ glassful. CROUSTADES, OR SWEET PATTIES. (A la Minute.) Slice some firm stale bread, about half an inch thick, and with a small round or fluted paste-cutter take from it as many croustades as will be required for a dish; mark the centres with a smaller cutter, leaving a rim of equal width all round ; scoop out the insides, and fry them in good butter a pale brown; drain and dry them well, and fill them with hot apple-marmalade, or with any warm preserve. The croustades may likewise be filled with good mince mutton, hare, or any brown meat, and served in the first course. * An equal portion of each may be taken. Sweeten, flavour, and thicken the custard by the receipts of page 533 and 534.

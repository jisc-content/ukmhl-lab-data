III. or any odd trimmings of the venison itselfi Cut down the meat small, and let it stand over a slow fire until the juices are well drawn out; then to each pound of it add a pint and a quarter of boiling water; throw in a small half-teaspoonful of salt, and eight or ten corns of pepper ; skim it thoroughly, and let it boil two hours and a half; then strain it, let it cool, take off every particle of fat, heat it anew, and send it very hot to table. Neck, or other trimmings of venison, 1 lb ; water, 1 pint and \ ; salt, small \ teaspoonful ; pepper-corns, 8 or 10: 2j hours. ANOTHER GRAVY FOR VENISON. Cut small a pound and a quarter of the trimmings of the venison, pour over them a pint and a half of un- Jlavoured cold mutton-broth, and stew them slowly for a couple of hours : add a little salt to the gravy before it is served. Venison, 1J lb.; mutton broth, 1^ pint: 2 hours. . Obs.—When venison cannot be had, gravy must be made of lean mutton, thus:—Trim away the fat from some cutlets, and lay them into a stewpan; set them over a clear fire, and let them brown a little in their own gravy ; then add a pint of boiling water to each pound of meat. Takeoff the scum, throw in a little salt, and boil the gravy till reduced one half. Some cooks broil the cutlets lightly, boil the gravy one hour, and then reduce it after it is strained. We have known an eschalot or two ordered for this gravy occasionally, but it should only be added when it is especially desired. A RICH GRAVY FOR VENISON. There are few eaters to whom this would be accep- table, the generality of them preferring infinitely the fla- vour of the venison itself to any which the richest gravy made of other meats can afford ; but when the savour of a well-made Espagnole is likely to be relished, prepare it by the receipt of the following page, substituting plain strong mutton stock for the veal gravy.

TO FRY HADDOCKS. Follow the directions given for fillets of whitings, or, should, a more simple method be preferred, clean and dry the fish well, cut off the heads and tails, take out the backbones, cut each fish in three, egg and crumb them, fry them in boiling lard a fine golden brown, and serve them, well drained and dried, with the same sauces as boiled haddocks. FRESH HERRINGS. (Harleigh Recent.) Scale and clean the fish with the utmost nicety, split them quite open, and wash the insides with particular care ; dry them well in a cloth, take off the heads and tails and remove the backbones ; rub the insides with pepper, salt, and a little pounded mace; stick small bits of butter on them and skewer two of the fish together as flat as possible, with the skin of both outside; flour, and broil or fry them of a fine brown, and serve them with melted butter mixed with a tea- spoonful or more of mustard, some salt and a little vinegar or lemon juice. To broil 20 to 25 minutes; to fry about 10 minutes. TO BOIL PLAICE OR FLOUNDERS. After having emptied and well cleaned the fish, make an incision in the back as directed for turbot; lay them into cold spring water ; add salt, and saltpetre in the same proportion as for cod fish, and let them just simmer for four or five minutes after the water first begins to boil, or longer, should their size require it, but guard against their being broken. Serve them with plain melted butter. 4 to 5 minutes; longer if needful.

CHAP. VII.] BOILING, ROASTING, &C. 195 in extensive country practice it lias been often proved so. The conjurer costs but a few shillings. Another form of this economical apparatus, with which a pint of water may be made to boil by means of only a sheet of paper wrapped round a cone, in the inside, is shown in the second plate. PRYING. This is an operation, which, though apparently very simple, requires to be more carefully and skilfully conducted than it com- Saute Pan. monly is. Its success depends principally on allowing the fat to attain the exact de- gree of heat which shall give firmness, without too quick browning or scorching, before anything is laid into the pan; for if this be neglected the article fried will be saturated with the fat, and remain j>ale and flaccid. When the requisite degree of colour is ac- quired before the cooking is complete, the pan should be placed high above the fire, that it may be con- tinued slowly to the proper point. Steaks and cutlets should be seasoned with salt and pepper, and dredged on both sides lightly with flour before they are laid into the pan, in which they should be often moved and turned, that they may be equally done, and that they may not stick nor burn to it. From ten to fif- teen minutes will fry them. They should be evenly sliced, about the same thickness as for broiling, and neatly trimmed and divided in the first instance. Lift them into a hot dish when done; pour the fat from the pan, and throw in a small slice of butter, stir to this a large teasponsful of flour, brown it gently, and pour in by degrees a quarter pint of hot broth or water; shake the pan well round, add pepper, salt, and a little good catsup, or any other store sauce which may be preferred to it, and pour the gravy over the steaks : this is the most common mode of saucing and serving them.

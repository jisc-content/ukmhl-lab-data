In such a case, unless she should chance to possess that rare treasure of common English life, a superior cook,* the economy of her table will not be amongst the lightest of her difficulties; and she may be placed, perhaps, by circumstances, at a distance from every friend who could counsel or assist her. Thrown thus entirely upon her own resources, she will natur- ally and gladly avail herself of the aid to be derived from such books as can really afford to her the inform- ation she requires. Many admirably calculated to do this, in part, are already in possession of the public; but amongst the large number of works on cookery, which we have carefully perused, we have never yet met with one which appeared to us either quite intended for, or entirely suited to the need of the totally inex- perienced ; none, in fact, which contained the first rudi- ments of the art, with directions so practical, clear, and simple, as to be at once understood, and easily fol- lowed, by those who had no previous knowledge of the subject.

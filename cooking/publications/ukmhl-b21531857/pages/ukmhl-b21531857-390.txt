350 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XIY. mites, in water slightly salted, with a very small bit of butter dissolved in it; drain it perfectly, and then put it into a full pint and a quarter of good beef or veal stock or gravy, previously mixed, and boiled for twenty minutes, with a small tablespoonful of fine currie- powder, a teaspoonful of arrow-root, and a little lemon- juice. Heat and toss the maccaroni gently in this until it is well and equally covered with it. A small quan- tity of rich cream, or a little bechamel, will very much improve the sauce, into which it should be stirred just before the maccaroni is added, and the lemon-juice should be thrown in afterwards. This dish is, to our taste, far better without the strong flavouring of onion or garlic, usually given to curries ; but this, when it is preferred, can be imparted to the gravy in the usual way. Ribband maccaroni, 6 ozs.; 15 minutes. Gravy, or good beef or veal stock, full pint and ^; fine currie- powder, 1 small tablespoonsful; arrow-root, 1 teaspoon- ful ; little lemon-juice: 20 minutes. Maccaroni in sauce, 3 to 6 minutes. Ohs.â€”An ounce or two of grated cocoa-nut simmered in the gravy for half an hour or more, then strained and well pressed from it, is always an excellent addition. The pipe maccaroni, well curried, is extremely good : the sauce for both kinds should be made with rich gravy, especially when the onion is omitted. A few drops of eschalot-vinegar can be added to it, when the flavour is liked. CURRIED EGGS. Boil six or eight fresh eggs quite hard, as for salad, and put them aside until they are cold. Mix well together from two to three ounces of good butter, and from three to four dessertspoonsful of currie-powder; shake them, in a stewpan or thick saucepan, over a clear but moderate fire for some minutes, then throw in a couple of mild onions finely minced, and fry them gently until they are tolerably soft; pour to them, by degrees, from half to three-quarters of a pint of broth

[CHAP. II. 86 MODERN COOKERY. TO RAKE PIKE. {Superior Receipt.) Scale, and wash the fish, take out the gills, then open it just sufficiently to allow the inside to be emptied, and perfectly cleansed, but not more than is necessary for that purpose. Wipe it as dry as possible in every part, then hang it for an hour or two on a hook in a cool larder, or wrap it in a soft cloth.

Dish them on a napkin, garnish them with curled parsley, and serve melted butter with them or Mciitre dâ€™Hotel sauce maigre. Very good French cooks put them at once into boil-

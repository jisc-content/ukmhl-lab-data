508 [CHAP. XX. MODERN COOKERY. be after two or three minutes simmering, clear it off, and continue the skimming until no more appears, then, should the quantity of liquid be more than is needed, reduce it by quick boiling to the proper point, strain it through a thin muslin, and set it by for use: it will be perfectly transparent, and may be mixed lukewarm with the clear and ready-sweetened juice of various fruits, or used with the necessary proportion of syrup, for jellies flavoured with choice liqueurs. As the clarifying reduces the strength of the isinglass,—or rather as a portion of it is taken up by the white of egg,—an additional quarter to each ounce must be allowed for this : if the scum be laid to drain on the back of a fine sieve which has been wetted with hot water, a little very strong jelly will drip from it. Isinglass, 2 \ ozs.; water, 1 pint; beaten white-of- egg, 1 teaspoonful. SPINACH GREEN, FOR COLOURING SWEET DISHES, CON- FECTIONARY, OR SOUPS. Pound quite to a pulp, in a marble or Wedgwood mortar, a handful or two of young freshly-gathered spinach, then throw it into a hair-sieve, and press through all the juice that can be obtained from it; pour this into a clean white jar, and place it in a pan of water that is at the point of boiling, and which must be allowed only to just simmer afterwards; in three or four minutes the juice will be poached or set; take it then gently with a spoon, and lay it upon the back of a fine sieve to drain. If wanted for immediate use, merely mix it in the mortar with some finely- powdered sugar ;* but if to be kept as store, pound it with as much as will render the whole tolerably dry ; boil it to candy-height over a very clear fire, pour it out in cakes, and keep them in a tin box or canister. For this last preparation consult the receipt for orange- flower-candy. * For soup, dilute it first with a little of the boiling stock, and stir it to the remainder.

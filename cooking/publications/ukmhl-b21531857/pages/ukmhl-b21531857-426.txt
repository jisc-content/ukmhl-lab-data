[chap. XV. MODERN COOKERY. 384 to stewed rump or sirloin of beef, or to a boned and forced leg of mutton. Minced lean of ham, 2 ozs.; mushrooms, 2 ozs.; bread-crumbs, 2 ozs.; shalots, 4 to 8 ; parsley, full teaspoonful; cayenne, quarter saltspoonful; little salt, if needed; butter, 2 ozs.; yolks of eggs, 2 to 3 : baked, 10 to 20 minutes. Obs.—The French pound the whole of these ingre- dients with a bit of garlic, before they fill the tomatas with them, but this is not absolutely necessary, and the garlic, if added at all, should be parboiled first, as its strong flavour, combined with that of the eschalots, would scarcely suit the general taste. When the lean of a dressed ham is at hand, only the herbs and vegetables will need to be stewed in the butter; this should be mixed with them into the forcemeat, which an intelligent cook will vary in many ways. PUREE OF TOMATAS. Divide a dozen fine ripe tomatas, squeeze out the seeds, and take off the stalks; put them with one small mild onion (or more, if liked), and about half a pint of very good gravy, into a well-tinned stewpan or saucepan, and simmer them for nearly or quite an hour ; a couple of bay-leaves, some cayenne, and as much salt as the dish may require should be added when they begin to boil. Press them through a sieve, heat them again, and stir to them a quarter-pint of good cream, previously mixed and boiled for five minutes *with a teaspoonful of flour. This puree is to be served with calf’s head, veal cutlets, boiled knuckle of veal, calf’s brains, or beef palates. For pork, beef, geese, and other brown meats, the tomatas should be reduced to a proper consistency in rich, and highly-flavoured brown gravy, or Spanish sauce. MUSHROOMS AU BEURRE. {Delicious.) Cut the stems from some fine meadow mushroom-

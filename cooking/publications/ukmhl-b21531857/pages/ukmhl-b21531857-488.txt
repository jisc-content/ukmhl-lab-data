[CHAP. XVII, 44 6 MODERN COOKERY. Richer pudding: flour, 1 lb; butter, \ lb.; in slightest delay, accompanied by pounded, and by good Lisbon sugar, as many persons prefer the latter, from its imparting a more mellowed flavour to the fruit. A small slice of fresh butter, and some finely grated nutmeg are usually considered improvements to an apple-pudding; the juice, and the grated rind of a lemon may be added with good effect, when the fruit is laid into the crust, especially in spring, when the apples generally will have become insipid in their flavour. When puddings are preferred boiled in moulds or basins, these must be thickly buttered before the paste is laid into them, and the puddings must be turned from them gently, that they may not burst. Currant, gooseberry, or cherry-pudding, 1 to 1J hour. Greengage, damson, mussel, or other plum, 1 to 1^ hour. Apple-pudding from 1 to 2 hours, according to its size, ancl the time of year. Obs.â€”If made of codlings, an apple-pudding will require only so much boiling as may be needed for the crust. A COMMON APPLE PUDDING. Make a light crust with one pound of flour, and six ounces of very finely-minced beef-suet, roll it thin, and fill it with one pound and a quarter of good boiling apples; add the grated rind and strained juice of a small lemon, tie it in a cloth, and boil it one hour and twenty minutes before Christmas, and from twenty to thirty minutes longer after Christmas. A small slice of fresh butter, stirred into it when it is sweetened will, to many tastes, be an acceptable addition ; grated nutmeg, or a little cinnamon, in fine powder, may be substituted for the lemon-rind when either is preferred. To convert this into a richer pudding, use half a pound of butter for the crust, and add to the apples a spoonful or two of orange, or of quince marmalade. Crust: flour, 1 lb.; suet, 6 ozs. Fruit, pared and cored, 1J lb.; juice and rind of 1 small lemon (or some nutmeg or cinnamon in powder).

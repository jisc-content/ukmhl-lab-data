FINE PASTRY. CHAP. XVI.] 433 to within something less than an inch of the edge with peach or apricot jam ; roll a second bit of paste to the same size, and lay it carefully over the other, having first moistened the edges with beaten egg, or water; press them together securely, that the preserve may not escape; pass a paste brush or small bunch of feathers dipped in water over the top, sift sugar thickly on it, then with the back of a knife mark the paste into divi- sions of uniform size, bake it in a well-heated but not fierce oven for twenty minutes or rather more, and cut it while it is still hot, where it is marked. The fan- ehonnettes should be about three inches in length and two in width. In order to lay the second crust over the preserve without disturbing it, wind it lightly round the paste-roller, and in untwisting it, let it fall gently over the other part. This is not the form of pasty called by the French fanchonnettes. Fine puff paste, 1 lb.; apricot or peach jam, 4 to 6 ozs. : baked 20 to 25 minutes. PASTRY SANDWICHES.

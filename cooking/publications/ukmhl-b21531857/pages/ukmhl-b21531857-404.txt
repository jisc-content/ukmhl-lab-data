362 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XV. Keep them well-shaken or tossed, that they may be equally done, and throw in some salt when they begin to stew. This is a good mode of dressing them when they are very young and watery. TO BOIL POTATOES. (Captain Katers Receipt.) Wash, wipe, and pare the potatoes, cover them witli cold water, and boil them gently till they are done, pour off the water, and sprinkle a little fine salt over them ; then take each potatoe separately with a spoon, and lay it into a clean warm cloth, twist, this so as to press all the moisture from the vegetable, and render it quite round; turn it carefully into a dish placed before the fire, throw a cloth over, and when all are done, send them to table quickly. Potatoes dressed in this way, are mashed without the slightest trouble; it is also by far the best method of preparing them for puddings or cakes. TO ROAST, OR BAKE POTATOES. Scrub, and wash exceedingly clean, some potatoes nearly assorted in size ; wipe them very dry, and roast them in a Dutch oven before the fire, placing them at a distance from it, and keeping them often turned; or arrange them in a coarse dish, and bake them in a moderate oven. Dish them neatly in a napkin, and send them very hot to table; serve cold butter with them. ]f to upwards of 2 hours. SCOOPED POTATOES. Wash and wipe some large potatoes of a firm kind, and with a small scoop adapted to the purpose,* form as many diminutive ones * This may be procured of Mr. Livermore, 30, Oxford Street, to whom we have already referred.

These, however, are innovations on the usual modes of serving it in England. After it has boiled quite tender, drain it well, dissolve from two to three ounces of good butter in a clean stewpan, wfith a few spoonsful of rich cream, or of white sauce, lay in part of the maccaroni, strew more cheese upon it, add the remainder of the maccaroni and the cheese, and toss the whole gently until the ingre- dients are well incorporated, and adhere to the maccaroni, leaving no liquid perceptible : serve it immediately.

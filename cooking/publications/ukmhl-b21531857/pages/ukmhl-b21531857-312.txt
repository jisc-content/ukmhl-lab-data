[CHAP. X. 274 MODERN COOKERY. of veal. Remove the bone, and fill the cavity with forcemeat (No. 1, page 170), which may be flavoured with a little minced eschalot, if approved ; more force- meat may be added by detaching the skin sufficiently on the flap side to admit it. When thus prepared, the fillet may be floured, and roasted, served with currant- jelly and brown gravy, or with only melted butter poured over it; or it may be stewed gently for nearly or quite four hours, in a pint of gravy or water, after being floured and browned all over in a couple of ounces of butter; it must then be turned every hour that it may be equally done. T wo or three small onions, a faggot of herbs, a couple of carrots sliced, four or five cloves, and twenty whole pepper-corns can be added at will. Roasted 2 hours, or stewed 4 hours. TO ROAST A LOIN OF MUTTON. The flesh of the loin of mutton is superior to that of the leg, when roasted; but to the frugal housekeeper, this consideration is usually overbalanced by the great weight of fat attached to it; this, however, when economy is more considered than appearance, may be pared off, and melted down for various kitchen-uses, or finely chopped, and substituted for suet in making hot pie, or pudding crust. When thus reduced in size, the mutton will be soon roasted. If it is to be dressed in the usual way, the butcher should be desired to take off the skin; care should be taken to preserve the fat from being ever so slightly burned; it should be managed, indeed, in the same manner as the saddle, in every respect, and carved also in the same way, that is to say, the meat should be cut out in slices the whole length of the back-bone, and close to it. Without the fat, 1 to l\ hour ; with, 1J to 1 j hours. TO DRESS A LOIN OF MUTTON LIKE YENISON. Skin and bone a loin of mutton, and lay it into a stewpan, or braising-pan, with a pint of water, a large onion stuck with a dozen cloves, half a pint of port

MODERN COOKERY. 888 (CHAP. XV. TRUFFLES A l’iTALIENNE. Wash perfectly clean, wipe, and pare some truffles as thin as possible; slice them about the size of a penny; put them into a saute-pan (or small frying- pan), with a slice of fresh butter, some minced parsley and eschalot, salt and pepper ; put them on the fire and stir them, that they may fry equally; when they are done, which will be in about ten minutes, drain off part of the butter, and throw in a bit of fresh, a small ladleful of Spanish sauce (see page 105), the juice of one lemon, qnd a little cayenne pepper. This is a dish of high relish. TO BOIL SPROUTS, CABBAGES, SAVOYS, LETTUCES, OR ENDIVE. All green vegetables should be thrown into abun- dance of fast boiling water ready salted and skimmed, with the addition of the morsel of soda which we have recommended, in a previous page of this Chapter; the pan should be left uncovered, and every precaution taken to prevent the smoke from reaching its contents. Endive, sprouts, and spring greens, will only require copious washing before they are boiled; but savoys, large lettuces, and close-leaved cabbages should be thrown into salt and water for half an hour or more before they are dressed, with the tops downwards to draw out the insects. The stems of these last should be cut off, the decayed leaves stripped away, and the vegetable halved or quartered, or split deeply across the stalk-end, and divided entirely before it is dished. Yery'young greens, 15 to 20 minutes; lettuces, 20 to 30 minutes; large savoys, or cabbages, 1 to 1 \ hour, or more. Ohs.—When the stalk of any kind of cabbage is tender, it is done. Turnip-greens should be well washed in several waters, and boiled in a very large quantity to deprive them of their bitterness.

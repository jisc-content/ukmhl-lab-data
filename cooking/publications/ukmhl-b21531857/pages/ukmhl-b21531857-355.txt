Truss, and spit it firmly ; flour it well when first laid to the fire ; baste it frequently with butter, and when it is done, draw out the skewers, dish it, pour a little good gravy over, and send it to table with bread, mushroom, egg, or chestnut sauce. A common mode of serving roast fowls in France is aux cressons, that is, laid upon young water-cresses, which have previously been freed from the outer leaves, thoroughly washed, shaken dry in a clean cloth, and sprinkled with a little fine salt, and a small quantity of vinegar: these should cover the dish, and after the fowls are placed on them, gravy should be poured over as usual.

Fill the breast of a fine fowl with good forcemeat, roast it as usual, and when it is very nearly ready to

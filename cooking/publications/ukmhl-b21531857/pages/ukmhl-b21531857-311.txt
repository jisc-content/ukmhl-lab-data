Draw the pan to the side of the fire, and let the mutton be simmered gently from two hours to two and a half, from the time of its first beginning to boil. Serve it with caper, brown cucumber, or oyster- sauce. If stewed softly, as we have directed, the mutton will he found excellent dressed thus ; otherwise, it will but resemble the unpalatable and ragged-looking joints of fast-boiled meat, so constantly sent to table by common English cooks. Any undressed hones of veal, mutton, or beef, boiled with the joint, will improve it much, and the liquor will then make excellent soup, or bouillon. 2 to 2J hours. COLD ROAST LEG OF MUTTON.

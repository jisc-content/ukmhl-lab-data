CHAP. XX.] SWEET DISHES. 525 cut in small spikes, and a couple of ounces of dried cherries, and pour it into a mould rubbed with a drop of oil; when turned out it will have the appearance of a pudding. From two to three ounces of preserved ginger, well-drained and sliced, may be substituted for the cherries, and an ounce of pistachio-nuts, blanched and split, for the citron; these will make an elegant variety of the dish, and the syrup of the ginger, poured round as sauce, will be a further improvement. Cur- rants steamed till tender, and candied orange or lemon- rind, are often used instead of the cherries, and the well- sweetened juice of strawberries, raspberries (white or red), apricots, peaches, or syrup of pine-apple, will make an agreeable sauce; a small quantity of this last will also give a delicious flavour to the pudding itself, when mixed with the other ingredients. Cream may be substituted entirely for the milk, when its richness is considered desirable. New milk, 1 pint; rind 1 small lemon; bitter almonds, 6 to 8 (or, vanilla, \ pod); salt, few grains; isinglass, § oz. (1 oz. in sultry weather) ; sugar, 4^ ozs.; cream, \ pint; yolks, 6 eggs ; dried cherries, 2 ozs. ; candied citron, 11 oz. (or, preserved ginger, 2 to 3 ozs., and the syrup as sauce, and 1 oz. of blanched pistachio- nuts ; or 4 ozs. currants, steamed 20 minutes, and 2 ozs. candied orange-rind). For sauce, sweetened juice of strawberries, raspberries, or plums, or pine-apple syrup. Obs.—The currants should be steamed in an earthen cullender, placed over a saucepan of boiling water, and covered with the lid.

MODERN COOKERY. 512 [chap. XX. and regulate the time as may be necessary for the dif- ferent varieties of fruit. Compote of bullaces.— The large, or shepherds’ bul- lace, is very good stewed, but will require a consider- able quantity of sugar to render it palatable unless it be quite ripe. Make a syrup with eight ounces, and three-quarters of a pint of water, and boil in it gently, from fifteen to twenty minutes, a pint and a half of the bullaces freed from their stalks. Compote of Siberian crabs.—To three-quarters of a pint of water add six ounces of fine sugar, boil them for ten, or twelve minutes, and skim them well. Add a pound and a half of Siberian crabs without their stalks, and keep them just at the point of boiling for twenty minutes ; they will then become tender without burst- ing.

Dish the fruit; reduce the syrup by quick boiling, pour it over the peaches, and serve them hot for a second-course dish, or cold for dessert. They should be quite ripe, and will be found delicious dressed thus. A little lemon-juice may be added to the syrup, and the blanched kernels of two or three peach or apricot stones. Sugar, 5 ozs.; water, l pint: 10 minutes. Peaches, 6 : 18 to 20 minutes.

Should the fruit be not perfectly ripe throw it into boiling water and keep it just simmering, until the skin can be easily stripped off. Have ready half a

MODERN COOKERY. 406 [CHAP. xyi. FLEAD CRUST. Flead is the provincial name for the leaf, or inside fat of a pig, which makes excellent crust when fresh, much finer, indeed, than after it is melted into lard. Clear it quite from skin, and slice it very thin into the flour, add sufficient salt to give flavour to the paste, and make the whole up smooth and firm with cold water; lay it on a clean dresser, and beat it forcibly with a rolling-pin until the flead is blended perfectly with the flour. It may then be made into cakes with a paste-cutter, or used for pies, round the edges of which a knife should be passed, as the crust rises better when cut than if merely rolled to the proper size. With the addition of a small quantity of butter,* which should be rolled in after the paste is made, it will be found equal to fine puff-crust, with the advan- tage of being more easy of digestion. COMMON SUET-CRUST FOR PIES. In many families this is preferred both for pies and tarts, to crust made with butter, as being much more wholesome: but it should never be served unless espe- cially ordered, as it is to some persons peculiarly dis- tasteful. Chop the suet extremely fine, and add from six to eight ounces of it to a pound of flour, with a few grains of salt, mix these with cold water into a firm paste, and work it very smooth. Some cooks beat it with a paste-roller, until the suet is perfectly blended with the flour; but the crust is lighter without this. In exceedingly sultry weather the suet, not being firm enough to chop, may be sliced as thin as possible, and well beaten into the paste after it is wetted. Flour, 2 lbs.; beef or veal kidney-suet, 12 to 16 ozs.; salt (for fruit-pies), J teaspoonful, for meat-pies 1 teaspoonful. * Six ounces of flead, with two of butter, to the pound of flour, will make good common crust; half as much again, with the same weight of flour, excellent crust: a teaspoonful of salt will be required with either.

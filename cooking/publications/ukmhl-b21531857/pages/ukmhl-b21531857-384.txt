3U MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XIV. to many of the ingredients which in a fresh and green state add so much to their excellence, being here be- yond our reach. The natives of the East compound and vary this class of dishes, we are told, with infinite ingenuity, blending in them very agreeably many condiments of different flavour, till the highest degree of piquancy and savour is produced, the whole being tempered with fine vegetable acids. With us, turmeric and cayenne pepper prevail in them often far too power- fully : the prodigal use of the former should be especially avoided, as it injures both the quality and the colour of the currie, which ought to be of a dark green, rather than of a red or yellow hue. The first is given by the genuine powder imported from India ; the others, by the greater number of spurious ones, sold in England, under its name. A couple of ounces of a sweet sound cocoa-nut lightly grated and stewed for nearly or quite an hour in the gravy of a currie is a great improvement to its flavour : it will be found particularly agreeable with that of sweetbreads, and may be served in the currie, or strained from it at pleasure. Great care, however, should be taken not to> use, for the purpose, a nut that is rancid. Spinage, cucumbers, vegetable marrow, tomatas, acid apples, green gooseberries (seeded), and tamarinds imported in the shell—not preserved—may all, in their season, be added, with very good effect, to curries of different kinds. Potatoes and celery are also occasionally boiled down in them. The rice for a currie should always be sent to table in a separate dish from it, and, in serving them, it should be first helped, and the currie laid upon it. MR. ARNOTT’S CURRIE-POWDER. Turmeric, eight ounces. Coriander seed, four ounces. Cummin seed, two ounces. Foenugreek seed, two ounces. Cayenne, half an ounce. (More or less of this last to the taste.)

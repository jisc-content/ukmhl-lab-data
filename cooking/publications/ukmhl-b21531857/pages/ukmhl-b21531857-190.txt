[[CHAP. IY. 152 MODERN COOKERY. TO CRISP PARSLEY. Pick some brandies of young parsley, wash them well, drain them from the water, and swing them in a clean cloth until they are quite dry; place them on a sheet of writing-paper in a Dutch-oven, before a brisk fire, and keep them frequently turned until they are quite crisp. They will be done in from six to eight minutes. PRIED PARSLEY. When the parsley has been prepared as for crisping, and is quite dry, throw it into plenty of lard or butter, that is on the point of boiling; take it up wdtli a skimmer the instant it is crisp, drain it on a cloth spread upon a sieve reversed and placed before the fire. ANCHOVY BUTTER. (Excellent,) Scrape the skin quite clean from a dozen fine mellow anchovies, free the flesh entirely from the bones, and pound it as smooth as possible in a mortar ; rub it through the back of a hair-sieve with a wooden spoon; wipe out the mortar, and put back the anchovies with three quarters of a pound of very fresh butter, a small half- saltspoonful of cayenne, and more than twice as much of finely grated nutmeg, and freshly pounded mace ; and beat these together until they are thoroughly blended. If to serve cold at table, mould the butter in small shapes, and turn it out. A little rose-pink (which is sold at the chemistsâ€™) is sometimes used to give it a fine colour, but it must be sparingly used, or it will impart an unpleasant flavour: it should be well- pounded, and very equally mixed with it. For kitchen use, press the butter down into jars or pattypans, and keep it in a cool place. Fine anchovies, 12; butter, j lb.; cayenne, small \ saltspoonful; nutmeg and mace, each more than twice as much ; rose-pink (if used), \ teaspoonful.

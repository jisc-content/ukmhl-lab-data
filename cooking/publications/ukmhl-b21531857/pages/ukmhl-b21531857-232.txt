[CHAP. VII. 194 MODERN COOKERY. kept in, and that they may be equally done in every part. If, for this purpose, it should be necessary, for want of steak-tongs, to use a fork, pass it through the outer skin, or fat of the steak, but never stick it into the lean, as by that means much of the gravy will escape. Most eaters prefer broiled beef or mutton, rather under-dressed ; but pork chops should always be thoroughly cooked. When a fowl or any other bird is cut asunder before it is broiled, the inside should first be laid to the fire : this should be done with kidneys also. Fish should be wrapped in a sheet of buttered writing paper, which will prevent their sticking to the gridiron, and will also preserve the skin in a better state than when it is exposed to the fire. Cutlets, or meat in any other form, when egged and crumbed for broiling, should afterwards * be dipped into clarified butter, or sprinkled with it plentifully, as the egg- yolk and bread will otherwise form too dry a crust upon it. French cooks season their cutlets both with salt and pepper, and brush a little oil or butter over them to keep them moist; but unless this be done, no seasoning of salt should be given them until they are just ready to be dished : the French method is a very good one. Steaks or cutlets may be quickly cooked with a sheet or two of lighted paper only, in the apparatus shown above and called a conjurer. Lift off the cover and lay in the meat properly seasoned, with a small slice of butter under it, and insert the lighted paper in the aperture shown in the plate; in from eight to ten minutes the meat will be done, and found to be remarkably tender, and very palatable. This is an especially convenient mode of cooking for persons whose hours of dining are rendered uncertain by the nature of their avocations. For medical men engaged

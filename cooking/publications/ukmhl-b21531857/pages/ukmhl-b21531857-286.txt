248 [CHAP. IX. MODERN COOKERY* recommend the practice, as an infinite improvement to the joint. Make the same forcemeat as for the fillet; and insert it between the skin and the flesh just over the ends of the bones. Skewer down the flap, place the joint at a moderate distance from a sound fire, keep it con- stantly basted, and be especially careful not to allow the kidney fat to burn : to prevent this, and to ensure the good appearance of the joint, a buttered paper should be fastened round the loin, and removed about half an hour beforp it is taken from the fire. It is the fashion in some counties to serve egg-sauce and brown gravy with roast loin, or breast of veal. The cook will scarcely need to be told that she must separate the skin from the flank, with a sharp knife, quite from the end, to the place where the forcemeat is to be put, and then skewer the whole very securely. When the veal is not papered, dredge it well with flour soon after it is laid to the fire. 2 hours to 2 J. BOILED LOIN OF VEAL. If dressed with care and served with good sauces, this, when the meat is small and white, is an excellent dish, and often more acceptable to persons of delicate habit than roast veal. Take from eight to ten pounds of the best end of the loin, leave the kidney in with all its fat, skewer or bind down the flap, lay the meat into cold water, and boil it as gently as possible from two hours and a quarter to two and a half, clearing off the scum perfectly, as in dressing the fillet. Send it to table with well-made oyster-sauce, or bechamel, or with white sauce well-flavoured with lemon juice, and with parsley, boiled, pressed dry, and finely chopped. 2\ hours to 2\. STEWED LOIN OF VEAL. Take part of a loin of veal, the chump end will do ; put into a large, thick, well-tinned iron saucepan, or into a stewpan, about a couple of ounces of butter, and

505 CHAP. XIX.] SOUFFLES, OMLETS, &C. add the remainder of the clarified butter, and bake the mixture for about half an hour in a gentle oven. It should be of a fine golden colour when served. Turn it carefully into a dish, and send it instantly to table. A little rich brown gravy poured round might, to some tastes, improve it, but it is excellent without, and may be substituted for maccaroni, which it much resembles in flavour. In Italy, the flour of Indian com (maize), which is there called polenta, is used for it, but the semoulina, when good, answers the purpose perfectly. The dish may be enriched by adding butter to the milk, or by mixing with it a portion of cream ; and it may be browned in a Dutch oven, when no other is in use. New milk (or milk mixed with cream), 1 quart ; salt, large J teaspoonful; semoulina, 5 ozs.: 10 minutes. Grated cheese, 6 to 8 ozs. ; cayenne, | teaspoonful; mace, 1 small teaspoonful; butter, 2 to 3 ozs: baked ^ hour, gentle oven. Obs.â€”A plain mould can be used instead of the basin. FORCED EGGS FOR SALAD. Pound and press through the back of a hair-sieve, the flesh of three very fine, or of four moderate-sized anchovies, freed from the bones and skin. Boil six fresh eggs for twelve minutes, and when they are per- fectly cold, halve them lengthwise, take out the yolks, pound them to a paste with a third of their volume of fresh butter; then add the anchovies, a quarter-tea- spoonful of mace, and as much cayenne as will season the mixture well; beat these together thoroughly, and fill the whites of egg neatly with them. A morsel of garlic, not larger than a pea, perfectly blended with the other ingredients would to some tastes greatly improve this preparation : a portion of anchovy-butter (see page 152) or of potted ham, will supply the place of the fish in it very advantageously. Eggs, G ; an cl 10 vies, 4; butter, size of 2 yolks; mace, \ teaspoonful ; cayenne, third as much.

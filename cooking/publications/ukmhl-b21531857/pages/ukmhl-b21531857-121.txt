83 CHAP. II.] FISH. TO DRESS WHITE BAIT. ( Greenwich Receipt.) This delicate little fish requires great care to dress it well. Do not touch it with the hands, but throw it from your dish or basket into a cloth, with three or four handsful of flour, and shake it well; then put it into a bait sieve, to separate it from the superfluous flour. Have ready a very deep frying-pan, nearly full of boiling fat, throw in the fish, which will be done in an instant: they must not be allowed to take any colour, for if browned, they are spoiled. Lift them out, and dish them upon a silver or earthenware drainer, without a napkin, piling them very high in the centre. Send them to table with a cut lemon, and slices of brown bread and butter on a plate. SHAD, TOURAINE FASHION. (.Alose a la mode de Touraine.') Empty and wash the fish with care, but do not open it more than is needful; fill it either with the force- meat^No. 1, or No. 2 of Chapter VI., and its own roe; then sew it up, or fasten it securely with very fine skewers, wrap it in a thickly buttered paper, and broil it gently for an hour over a charcoal fire. Serve it with caper sauce, or with Chili vinegar and melted butter. We are indebted for this receipt to a friend who has been long resident in Touraine, and at whose table the fish is constantly served, thus dressed, and is considered excellent. It is likewise often gently stewed in the light white wine of the country, and served covered with a rich bechamel. Many fish more common with us than the shad might be advantageously prepared in the same manner. The charcoal fire is not indispensable : any that is entirely free from smoke will answer. We would suggest as an improvement, that oyster forcemeat should be substituted for that which we have indicated. Broiled gently, 1 hour, more or less, according to its size.

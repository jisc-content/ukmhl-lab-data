.PREFACE. IX imagine possible. This, at a period when the struggle for income is so general, and the means of half the families holding a certain rank in the world are so insufficient for the support of their position, is a con- sideration of very deep importance. Few things are more certain to involve persons of narrow fortune in painful difficulties than the ruinous, because constant (though not alwrays*perceptible), extra- vagance which so often exists in every department of a house of which the sole regulation is left to servants, who, more than any other class of people in the world, would appear to be ignorant of the true value of moiiey, and of the means of economizing it. We speak, of course, of the generality. Some amongst them there are, we know, equally trustworthy and conscientious, who protect their employersâ€™ property from abuse more scrupulously even than if it wore their own; but the greater number are reckless enough in their wasteful profusion when uncontrolled by the eye of a superior: an inexperienced housekeeper cannot be too soon aware of this. It sometimes happens, however, that the young mistress of a family has had no opportunity before her marriage of acquiring the knowledge which would enable her to conduct her household concerns as she could desire ; and that, with a high sense of her duties, and an earnest wish to fulfil them to the utmost, she is prevented by her entire ignorance of domestic affairs from accomplishing her object.

MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. I. 32 browned in a little fresh butter, with three or four thick slices, or a knuckle of lean ham, four large onions sliced, three heads of celery, three large carrots, a large bunch of sweet herbs, the rind of a lemon pared very thin, a dessertspoonful of pepper-corns, two ounces of salt, and after the meat has been taken from the head, all the bones and fragments. Stew these gently from seven to eight hours, then strain off the stock, and set it into a very cold place, that the fat may become firm enough on the top to be cleared off easily. The skin and fat of the head should be taken off together and divided into strips of two or three inches in length and one in width; the tongue may be cut in the same manner, or into dice. Put the stock, of which there ought to be between four and five quarts, into a large soup or stew- pot ; thicken it when it boils with four ounces of fresh butter* mixed with an equal weight of fine dry flour, a half-teaspoonful of pounded mace, and a third as much of cayenne ; (it is better to use these sparingly at first, and to add more should the soup require it, after it has boiled some little time); pour in half a pint of sherry, stir the whole together until it has simmered for a minute or two, then put in the head, and let it stew gently from an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half: stir it often, and clear it perfectly from scum. Slip into it just before it is ready for table, three dozens of small forcemeat-balls ; the brain cut into dice (after having been well soaked, scalded,t and freed from the film), dipped into beaten yolk of egg, then into the finest crumbs mixed with salt, white pepper, a little grated nutmeg, fine lemon-rind, and chopped parsley, * When the butter is considered objectionable, the flour, with- out it, may be mixed to the smoothest batter possible, with a little cold stock or water, and stirred briskly into the boiling soup : the spices should be blended with it. t The brain should be blanched, that is, thrown into boiling water with a little salt in it, and boiled from five to eight minutes ; then lifted out, and laid into cold water for a quarter of an hour ; it must be wiped very dry before it is fried.

[CHAP. XXII. MODERN COOKERY. 602 MUSHROOMS IN BRINE. For Winter use. ( Very good.) We have had small mushroom-buttons excellently preserved through the winter prepared as follows, and we therefore give the exact proportions which we had used for them, though the same quantity of brine would possibly allow of rather more mushrooms in it. Prepare them exactly as for the preceding pickle, and measure them after the stems are taken off. For each quart, boil together for five minutes two quarts of water, with half a pound of common white salt, a small dessertspoonful of white peppercorns, a couple of blades of mace, and a race of ginger; take off the scum thoroughly, and throw in the mushrooms; boil them gently for about five minutes, then put them into well warmed, wide-necked bottles, and let them become perfectly cold, pour a little good salad-oil on the top, cork them with new corks, and tie bladder over, or cover them with two separate bladders. When wanted for use, soak the mushrooms in warm water till the brine is sufficiently extracted. Mushrooms, 1 quart; water, \ gallon; salt, \ lb.; peppercorns, 1 small dessertspoonful; mace 2 blades; ginger, 1 race: 5 minutes. Mushrooms, in brine, 5 minutes. PICKLED ESCHALOTS. For a quart of ready-peeled eschalots, add to the same quantity of the best pale white wine vinegar, a dessert- spoonful of salt, and an ounce of whole white pepper; bring these quickly to a boil, take off the scum, throw in the eschalots, simmer them for two minutes only; turn them into a clean stone jar, and when they are quite cold, tie a skin, or two folds of thick paper over it. Eschalots, 1 quart; vinegar, 1 quart; salt, 1 des- sertspoonful ; whole white pepper, 1 oz. Ohs.â€”The sooner the eschalots are pickled after they are ripe and dry, the better they will be.

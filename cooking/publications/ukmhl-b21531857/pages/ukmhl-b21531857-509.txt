467 CHAP. XVIII.] BAKED PUDDINGS. LEMON SUET-PUDDING. To eight ounces of finely grated bread-crumbs, add six of fresh beef kidney-suet, free from skin, and minced very small, three and a half of pounded sugar, six ounces of currants, the grated rind and the strained juice of a large lemon, and four full-sized or five small well-beaten eggs; pour these ingredients into a thickly-buttered pan, and bake the pudding for an hour in a brisk oven, but draw it towards the mouth when it is of a fine brown colour. Turn it from the dish before it is served, and strew sifted sugar over it or not at pleasure : two ounces more of suet can be added when a larger propor- tion is liked. The pudding is very good without the currants. Bread-crumbs, 8 ozs.; beef-suet, 6 ozs. ; pounded sugar, 3|-ozs.; lemon, 1 large; currants, 6 ozs; eggs, 4 large, or 5 small: 1 hour, brisk oven. BAKEWELL PUDDING. This pudding is famous not only in Derbyshire, but in several of our northern counties, where it is usually served on all holiday-occasions. Line a shallow tart- dish with quite an inch-deep layer of several kinds of good preserve mixed together, and intermingle with them from two to three ounces of candied citron or orange-rind. Beat well the yolks of ten eggs, and add to them gradually half a pound of sifted sugar; when they are well mixed, pour in by degrees half a pound of good clarified butter, and a little ratifia or any other flavouring that may be preferred ; fill the dish two- thirds full with this mixture, and bake the pudding nearly an hour in a moderate oven. Half the quantity will be sufficient for a small dish. Mixed preserves, \\ to 2 lbs.; yolks of eggs, 10; sugar, \ lb.; butter, 1 lb.; ratifia, lemon-brandy, or other flavouring to the taste: baked, moderate oven, J to 1 hour.

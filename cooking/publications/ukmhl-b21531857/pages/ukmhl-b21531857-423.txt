After they have been soaked and well washed, cut off the stems quite close, trim away a few of the lower leaves, and clip the points of all; throw the artichokes into plenty of fast-boiling water, ready-salted and skimmed, with the addition, if it be at hand, of the proportion of soda directed in page 359, as this will greatly improve the colour of the vegetable. When extremely young, the artichokes will be tender in from half to three-quarters of an hour, but they will require more than double that time when at their full growth: when the leaves can be drawn out easily they are done. Send good melted butter to table with them. They should be boiled always with the stalk-ends uppermost. Very young, \ to J hour; full-grown, 1 \ to 2 hours. Obs.—French cooks lift the tops from the artichokes before they are served, and replace them after having taken out the chokes: this must be expeditiously done to prevent the vegetable from cooling. ARTICHOKES EN SALADE. Wash, soak, and drain some very young and tender artichokes (they should not have attained more than a third of their growth), cut off the stalks close, quarter them, and send them to table with a little water in the dish. The chokes will be scarcely formed, and the remainder of the vegetable will have almost the flavour of fresh walnuts : it is constantly served thus in France as a hors d'oeuvre, VEGETABLE MARROW.

The flesh is whiter and of better flavour when the gourd is about six inches long;

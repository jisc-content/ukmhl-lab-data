FORCEMEATS. CHAP. VI.] 173 proportion of herbs, spice, salt, herbs, and lemon-peel, as in the foregoing receipt, and a couple Of whole eggs, which should be very slightly beaten, after the specks have been taken out with the point of a small fork. Should more liquid be required, the yolk of another egg, or a spoonful or two of milk, may be used.

MODERN COOKERY. rub a little fine dry salt over it, and leave it until the following day; drain it well from the blood which will be found to have flowed from it, and it will be ready for any of the following modes of curing, which are all excellent of their kind, and have been well proved. In very cold weather, the salt may be applied quite warm to the meat: it should always be perfectly dry, and reduced to powder. Saltpetre hardens and renders meat indigestible; sugar, on the contrary, mellows and improves it much ; and it is more tender when cured with bay-salt than when common salt is used for it. TO SALT AND BOIL A ROUND OF BEEF. Mix an ounce of saltpetre, finely pow*dered, with half a pound of very coarse sugar, and rub the beef tho- roughly with them ; in two days, add three quarters of a pound of common salt, well dried and beaten; turn and rub the meat well in every part with the pickle for three weeks, when it will be fit to dress. Just wash off the salt, and skewer the beef as round and as even as possible; bind it tightly with broad tape, cover it with cold water, and let it simmer gently for at least five hours. Carrots, mashed turnips, or cabbages are usually served with boiled beef; and horse-radish stewed for ten minutes in equal parts of vinegar and water, then pressed well from them, and mixed witli some rich melted butter is a good sauce for it. Beef, 20 lbs. ; coarse sugar, \ lb.; saltpetre, 1 oz. : 2 days. Salt, J lb. : 21 days. Boil 5 hours or more.

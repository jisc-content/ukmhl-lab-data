[CHAP. XIX. MODERN COOKERY. 496 lengths, and throw it into the French batter of page 1.54 ; with a fork lift the stalks separately, and put them into a pan of boiling lard or butter : in from five to six minutes they will be done. Drain them well and dish them on a napkin, or pile them high without one, and strew sifted sugar plentifully over them : they should be of a very light brown, and quite dry and crisp. The young stalks look well when left in their entire length, and only slightly encrusted with the batter, through which they should be merely drawn. 5 to 6 minutes. APPLE, PEACH, APRICOT, OR ORANGE FRITTERS. Pare and core without dividing the apples, slice them in rounds the full size of the fruit, dip them into the same batter as that directed for the preceding fritters ; fry them a pale brown, and let them be very dry. Serve them heaped high upon a folded napkin, and strew sifted sugar over them. After having stripped the outer rind from the oranges, remove carefully the white bitter skin, and in slicing them take out the pips; then dip them into the batter and proceed as for the apple frit- ters. The peaches and apricots should be merely skinned, halved, and stoned before they are drawn through the batter; unless they should be not fully ripe, when they must first be stewed tender in a thin syrup. 8 to 12 minutes. BRIOCHE FRITTERS. The brioche-paste,* when good, makes very superior cannelons and fritters: it is, we should say, better in this form than in that of the bun or cake, in which it is seen so commonly abroad. Make it, for the fritters, into very small balls; roll them quite thin, put a tea- spoonful or less of rich preserve into each, moisten the edges and fold the paste together securely, or with a small tin shape cut as many rounds of the brioche as are wanted, place some preserve in the centre of one-half of these, moisten the edges, lay the remainder lightly * For this, see page 407.

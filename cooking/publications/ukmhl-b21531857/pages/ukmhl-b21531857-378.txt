Place it over a very clear fire, and broil it gently from twenty to thirty minutes. Send it to table with brown mushroom-sauce, or some Espagnole. THE FRENCH, OR RED-LEGGED PARTRIDGE. This is dressed precisely like our common partridge, and is excellent eating if it be well-kept; otherwise it is tough and devoid of flavour.

It was at one time, however, plentiful in Suffolk,* and in one or two of the adjoining counties, but great efforts we have understood have been made to exterminate it.

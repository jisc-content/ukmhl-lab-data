CHAP. IV.] SAUCES. 139 CAPER SAUCE. Stir into the third of a pint of good melted butter from three to four dessertspoonsful of capers, add a little of the vinegar and dish the sauce as soon as it boils. Keep it stirred after the berries are added: part of them may be minced and a little Chili vinegar substi- tuted for their own. Pickled nasturtiums make a very good sauce, and their flavour is sometimes preferred to that of the capers. For a large joint, increase the quantity of butter to half a pint. Melted butter, third of pint; capers, 3 to 4 dessert- spoonsful. BROWN CAPER SAUCE. Thicken half a pint of good veal, or beef-gravy as directed for Sauce Tournee, and add to it two table- spoonsful of capers, and a dessertspoonful of the pickle liquor, or of Chili vinegar, with some cayenne if the former be used, and a proper seasoning of salt. Thickened veal or beef gravy, T pint; capers, 2 tablespoonsful; caper-liquor or Chili vinegar, 1 dessert- spoonful. CAPER SAUCE FOR FISH. To nearly half a pint of very rich melted butter add six spoonsful of strong veal-gravy or jelly, a tablespoon- ful of essence of anchovies, and some Chili vinegar or cayenne. When there is no gravy at hand substitute a half-wineglassful of mushroom catsup, or of Harveyâ€™s sauce; though these deepen the colour more than is desirable. COMMON CUCUMBER SAUCE. Pare, slice, dust slightly with pepper, and with flour, two or three young cucumbers, and fry them a fine brown, in a little butter, or dissolve an ounce and a half in a small stewpan, or iron saucepan, and shake them in it over a brisk fire from twelve to fifteen minutes; pour to them, by degrees, nearly half a pint of strong beef

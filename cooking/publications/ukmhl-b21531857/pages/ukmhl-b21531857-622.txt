[chap, XXI. 530 MODERN COOKERY. often during the time; draw it from the fire, and mix with it ten ounces of well-refined sugar, rolled or beaten to powder, for each pound of the peaches ; clear it care- fully from scum, and boil it briskly for five minutes ; throw in theWained juice of one or two good lemons; continue the boiling for three minutes only, and pour out the marmalade. Two minutes after the sugar is stirred to the fruit, add the blanched kernels of part of the peaches. Peaches, stoned and pared, 4 lbs. : § hour. Sugar, 2 J lbs. : 2 minutes. Blanched peach-kernels: 3 mi- nutes. Juice, 2 small lemons : 3 minutes. Obs.—This jam, like most others, is improved by pressing the fruit through a sieve after it has been par- tially boiled. Nothing can be finer than its flavour, which would be injured by adding the sugar at first; and a larger proportion renders it cloyingly sweet. Nectarines and peaches mixed, make an admirable preserve. TO PRESERYE, OR TO DRY PEACHES OR NECTARINES. {An easy and excellent Receipt.) The fruit should be fine, freshly gathered, and fidly ripe, but still in its perfection. Pare, halve, and weigh it after the stones are removed; lay it into a deep dish, and strew over it an equal weight of highly refined pounded sugar; let it remain until this is nearly dis- solved, then lift the fruit gently into a preserving pan, pour the juice and sugar to it, and heat the whole over a very slow fire; let it just simmer for ten minutes, then turn it softly into a bowl, and let it remain a couple of days ; repeat the slow-heating and simmering at in- tervals of two or three days, until the fruit is quite clear, when it may be potted in the syrup, or drained from it, and dried upon large clean slates or dishes, or upon wire- sieves. The flavour will be excellent. The strained juice of a lemon may be added to the syrup, with good effect, towards the end of the process, and an additional ounce or two of sugar allowed for it.

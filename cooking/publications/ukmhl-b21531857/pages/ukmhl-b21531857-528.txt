486 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XVIII. with four ounces of whole boiled rice, eight ounces of sugar, a small slice of butter, and five large, or six small eggs. APPLE-AND-RICE PUDDING. Boil together one pound of good pudding-apples, and six ounces of sugar, until they are reduced to a smooth pulp; stir them often to prevent their burning; mix with them four ounces of boiled rice, two ounces of butter, and five large eggs. Should the apples be very acid, increase the quantity of sugar : add lemon rind or juice, at pleasure. These puddings are better if mixed while the ingredients are warm. Apples, 1 lb.; sugar, 6 ozs.; boiled rice, 4 ozs.; but- ter, 2 ozs.; eggs, 5 : 30 to 35 minutes. COMMON RAISIN PUDDING. Beat well together three-quarters of a pound of flour, the same quantity of raisins, six ounces of beef-suet, finely chopped, a small pinch of salt, some grated nut- meg, and three eggs that have been thoroughly whisked, and mixed with about a quarter-pint of milk, or less than this, should the eggs be large. Pour the whole into a buttered dish, and bake it an hour and a quarter. For a large pudding, increase the quantities one-half. Flour and stoned raisins, each } lb.; suet, 6 ozs. ; salt, small pinch ; nutmeg, J teaspoonful; eggs, 3; milk, i pint: hour. * A RICHER RAISIN PUDDING. A pound of raisins weighed after they are stoned, ten ounces of beef-suet shred very fine, three-quarters of a pound of flour, a little salt, half a small nutmeg, or the grated rind of a lemon, four large eggs, and as much milk as may be needed to make the whole into a very thick batter. Mix, and beat the ingredients well, and bake the pudding rather longer than the preceding one. The addition of sugar will not be found an improve- ment to these puddings, as it destroys their lightness.

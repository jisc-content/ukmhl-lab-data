This we would especially recommend for whitings also, which are excellent, if nicely broiled, but require a quicker fire, and rather less time than the mackerel. The latter, if very large, will need a few additional minutes’ broiling. When the backbone parts easily from the flesh, it is ready for table: put a cold Maitre d’Hotel sauce into the back before it is served. 30 to 40 minutes. Yfhitings, 20 to 30.

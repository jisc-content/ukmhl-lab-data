CHAP. IV.] SAUCES. 147 beat it afresh, and stir to it when it boils, about the third of a pint of rich cream. Serve it with boiled chickens, stewed or boiled veal, lamb chops, or any other delicate meat. When to be served as a puree, an additional half pound of the vegetable must be used ; and it should be dished with small fried sippets round it. For a maigre dish, stew the marrow and onion quite tender in butter, and dilute them with half boiling- water and half cream. Vegetable marrow, 1 lb.; mild onion, 1 oz.; strong broth or pale gravy, 1 pint: nearly or quite 1 hour. Pepper or cayenne, and salt as needed; good cream from J to third of pint. For puree, J lb. more of marrow. EXCELLENT TURNIP, OR ARTICHOKE SAUCE FOR BOILED MEAT. Pare, slice, and boil quite tender, some finely-grained mild turnips; press the water from them thoroughly, and pass them through a sieve. Dissolve a slice of butter in a clean saucepan, and stir to it a large tea- spoonful of flour, or mix them smoothly together before they are put in, and shake the saucepan round until they boil; pour to them very gradually, nearly a pint of thin cream (or of good milk mixed with a portion, of cream), add the turnips with a half-teaspoonful or more of salt, and when the whole is well mixed and very hot, pour it over boiled mutton, veal, lamb, or poultry. There should be sufficient of the sauce to cover the meat entirely, and when properly made it improves greatly the appearance of a joint. A little cayenne tied in a muslin may be boiled in the milk before it is mixed with the turnips. Jerusalem arti- chokes make a more delicate sauce of this kind, even than turnips : the weight of both vegetables must be taken after they are pared. Pared turnips or artichokes, 1 lb.; fresh butter, 1 oz. and J ; flour, 1 large teaspoonful (twice as much if all milk be used) ; salt, \ teaspoonful or more; cream, or cream and milk mixed, from f to 1 pint.

Beef-suet is commonly used in the composition of this kind of forcemeat, but we think that veal kidney- suet, when it could be obtained, would have a better effect; though the reader will easily comprehend that it is scarcely possible for us to have every variety of every receipt which we insert put to the test; in some cases we are compelled merely to suggest what appear to us likely to be improvements. Strip carefully every morsel of skin from the suet, and mince it small; to six ounces, add eight of bread-crumbs, with the same

MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XX. 544 whites, 3,â€”yolks, 6 ; cream, b pint; butter, 4 ozs.; sugar, 2 ozs.; brandy, cuirasseau, or orange-flower water, \ wineglassful (or little lemon-brandy). 20 minutes, slow oven. MERINGUE OF PEARS, OR OTHER FRUIT. Fill a deep tart disli nearly to the brim with stewed pears, and let them be something more than half covered with their juice. Whisk to a solid froth the whites of five eggs, stir to them five tablespoonsful of dry sifted sugar, and lay them lightly and equally over the fruit; put the meringue immediately into a moderate oven, and bake it half an hour. Cherries, bullaces, and damsons, with various other kinds of plums, first either stewed as for compotes (see page 510), or baked with sugar, as for winter use, answer as well as pears for this dish ; which may, likewise, be made of apples, peaches, apricots, or common plums boiled down quite to a marmalade, with sufficient sugar to sweeten them moderately : the skins and stones of these last should be removed, but a few of the blanched kernels may be added to the fruit. Dish filled with stewed pears or other fruit; whites of eggs, 5; pounded sugar, 5 tablespoonsful: baked \ hour. AN APPLE CHARLOTTE; OR CHARLOTTE DE POMMES. Butter a plain mould, (around or square cake- tin will answer the pur- pose quite well,) and line it entirely with thin slices of the crumb of a stale loaf, cut so as to fit into it with great exactness, and dipped into clarified butter. When this is done, fill the mould to the brim with apple- marmalade; cover the top with slices of bread dipped in butter,, and on these place a dish, a large plate, or the cover of a French stewpan with a weight upon it.

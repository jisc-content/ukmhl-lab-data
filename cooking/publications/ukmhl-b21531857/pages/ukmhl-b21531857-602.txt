[CHAP. XXI. MODERN COOKERY. 560 RED GOOSEBERRY JAM. The small rough red gooseberry, when fully ripe, is the best for this preserve, which may, however, be made of the larger kinds. When the buds and stalks have been taken carefully from the fruit, weigh, and boil it quickly for three quarters of an hour, keeping it well stirred ; then for six pounds of the gooseberries add two and a half of good roughly-powdered sugar (or three of fine Lisbon, if only a common preserve be wanted); boil these together briskly, from twenty to twenty-five minutes, and stir the jam well from the bottom of the pan, as it is liable to burn if this be neglected. Small red gooseberries, 6 lbs.: j hour. Pounded sugar, 2J lbs (for common jam Lisbon sugar 3 lbs.) : 20 to 25 minutes. VERY FINE GOOSEBERRY JAM. Seed the fruit, which for this jam may be of the larger kind of rough red gooseberry : those which are smooth-skinned are generally of far inferior flavour. Add the pulp which has been scooped from the pre- pared fruit to some whole gooseberries, and stir them over a moderate fire for some minutes to extract the juice; strain and weigh this ; pour two pounds of it to four of the seeded gooseberries, boil them rather gently for twenty-five minutes, add fourteen ounces of good pounded sugar to each pound of fruit and juice, and when it is dissolved boil the preserve from twelve to fifteen minutes longer, and skim it well during the time. Seeded gooseberries, 4 lbs.; juice of gooseberries, 2 pounds: 25 minutes. Sugar, 5J lbs. (or 14 ozs. to each pound fruit and juice) : 12 to 15 minutes. JELLY OF RIPE GOOSEBERRIES. (Excellent.) Take the tops and stalks from a gallon or more of any kind of well-flavoured ripe red gooseberries, and

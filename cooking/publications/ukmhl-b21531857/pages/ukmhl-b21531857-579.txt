XX.] SWEET DISHES. 537 blamange should be poured into the mould in half-inch depths, when so cool as to be only just liquid, and one colour must be perfectly cold before another is added, or they will run together, and spoil the appearance of the dish. When ice is not procurable, the moulds in warm weather may beset into water, mixed with plenty of salt and saltpetre : the insides should be rubbed with a drop of very pure salad oil, instead of being laid into fresh water, as usual.

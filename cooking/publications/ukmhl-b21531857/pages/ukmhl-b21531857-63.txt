SOUPS. CHAP. I.] 27 A RICHER WHITE SOUP. Pound very fine indeed, six ounces of sweet almonds, then add to them six ounces of the breasts of roasted chickens or partridges, and three ounces of the whitest bread which has been soaked in a little veal broth, and squeezed very dry in a cloth. Beat these altogether to an extremely smooth paste ; then pour to them boiling and by degrees, two quarts of rich veal-stock; strain the soup through a fine hair sieve, set it again over the fire, add to it a pint of thick cream, and serve it, as soon as it is at the point of boiling, with a French roll in the tureen. When cream is very scarce, or not easily to be procured, this soup may be thickened sufficiently without it by increasing the quantity of almonds to eight or ten ounces, and pouring to them, after they have been reduced to the finest paste, a pint of boiling stock, which must be again wrung from them through a coarse cloth with very strong pressure : the propor- tion of meat and bread also should then be nearly doubled. The stock should be well-seasoned with mace and cayenne before it is added to the other ingredients. Almonds, 6 oz.; breasts of chicken or partridges, 6 oz.; soaked bread, 3 oz. ; veal-stock, 2 quarts; cream, one pint. Obs. 1.—Some persons pour the yolks of four or five hard-boiled eggs with the almonds, meat, and bread for this white soup; French cooks beat smoothly with them an ounce or two of whole rice, previously boiled from fif- teen to twenty minutes. Obs. 2,—rA good plain white soup may be made simply by adding to a couple of quarts of pale veal- stock or strong well-flavoured veal broth, a thickening of arrow-root, and from half to three quarters of a pint of cream * Four ounces of maccaroni boiled tender and well drained may be slipped into it a minute or two before it is dished, but the thickening may then be diminished a little.

VIII.] BEEF. and let it lie three days; add to it then half a pound of fine salt, rub and turn it once in twenty-four hours for twelve days; just wash, but do not soak it; skewer, or bind it into good form, put it into a stewpan or sauce- pan nearly of its size, pour to it a pint and a half of good beef broth, and when it begins to boil, take off the scum, and throw in one small onion, a moderate sized faggot of thyme and parsley, and two large, or four small carrots.

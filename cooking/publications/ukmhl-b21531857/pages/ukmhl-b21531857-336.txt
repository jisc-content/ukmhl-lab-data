296 [CHAP. XT. MODERN COOKERY. In pickle, turned daily, 1 month. Smoked over wood, 1 month. Obs.â€”When two hams are pickled together a smaller proportion of the ingredients is required for each, than for one which is cured by itself. HAMS. (.Bor dyke Receipt.') After the hams have been rubbed with salt, and well drained from the brine, according to our previous di- rections, take, for each fourteen pounds weight of meat, one ounce of saltpetre in fine powder, mixed with three ounces of the coarsest sugar; rub the meat in every part with these, and let it remain some hours, then cover it well with eight ounces of bay-salt, dried and pounded, and mixed with four ounces of com- mon salt: in four days add one pound of treacle, atid keep the hams turned daily, and well basted with the pickle for a month.

Ham, 14 lbs.; saltpetre, 1 oz.; coarse sugar, 3 ozs.: 8 to 12 hours. Bay-salt | lb.; common salt, 4 ozs. : 4 days. Treacle, 1 lb. : 1 month. To heighten fla- vour, black pepper 1 oz.; juniper-berries, 3 ozs. TO BOIL A HAM.

If highly salted, hard, and old, a day and night, or even longer, may be requisite to dilate the pores sufficiently, and to extract a portion of the salt. To do either effec- tually the water must be several times changed during the steeping. We generally find hams cured by any of

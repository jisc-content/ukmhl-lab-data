MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. VII. 192 have ourselves seen a dish of acid fruit which had been boiled without sugar, in a copper pan from which the tin lining was half worn away, coated with verdigris after it had become cold ; and from the careless habits of the person who had prepared it, the chances were greatly in favour of its being served to a family after- wards, if it had not been accidently discovered. Salt acts upon the copper in the same manner as acids; vegetables, too, from the portion of the latter which they contain, have the same injurious effect; and the greatest danger results from allowing preparations containing any of these to become cold (or cool) in the stewpan, in contact with the exposed part of the copper in the inside. Thick, well-tinned iron saucepans will answer for all the ordinary purposes of common English cookery, even for stewing, provided they have tightly- fitting lids to prevent the escape of the steam; but the copper ones are of more convenient form, and better adapted to a superior order of cookery. We shall have occasion to speak more particularly in another part of this work, of the German ena- melled stewpans, so safe, and so well suited, from the extreme nicety of the composition, resembling earthen- ware or china, with which they are lined, to all deli- cate compounds. The cook should be warned however, that they retain the heat so long, that the contents will boil for several minutes after they are removed from the fire, and this must be guarded against when they have reached the exact point, at which further boiling would have a bad effect, as would be the case with some pre- serves, and other sweets. BROILING. Broiling is the best possible mode of cooking and of preserving the flavour of several kinds of fish, amongst should be plentifully taken, dissolved in water, so as to form quite a syrup, by persons who may unfortunately have partaken of any dish into which this dangerous ingredient has entered.

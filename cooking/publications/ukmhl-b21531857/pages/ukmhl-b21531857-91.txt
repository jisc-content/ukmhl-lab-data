It may be converted into French spring-broth, by passing it through a sieve, and boiling it again for five or six minutes with a handful of young and nicely-picked sorrel. Meat, 1 pound; carrot, 2 ozs.; turnip, 1 ounce and a half; celery, J oz.; onion, ^ oz.; water, 3 pints : half an hour. Little pepper and salt. Obs.â€”Three pounds of beef or mutton, with two or three slices of ham, and vegetables in proportion to the above receipt, all chopped fine, and boiled in three quarts of water for an hour and a half, will make an excellent family soup on an emergency: additional boiling will of course improve it, and a little spice should be added after it has been skimmed, and salted. It may easily be converted into carrot, turnip, or ground- rice soup after it is strained. VEAL OR MUTTON BROTH. To each pound of meat add a quart of cold water, bring it gently to boil, skim it very clean, add salt in the same proportion as for bouillon (see page 7), with spices and vegetables also, unless unflavourecl broth be required, when a few peppercorns, a blade or two of mace, and a bunch of savoury herbs will be sufficient; though for some purposes even these, with the exception of the salt, are better omitted. Simmer the broth for about four hours unless the quantity be very small, when from two and a half, to three, will he sufficient. A little rice boiled down with the meat will both thicken the broth, and render it more nutritious. Strain it off wdien done, and let it stand till quite cold that the fat may be entirely cleared from it: this is espe- cially needful when it;is to be served to an invalid. Veal or mutton, 4 lbs.; water, 4 quarts; salt. (For vegetables, &c., see page 7 ;) rice (if used), 4 ozs.; 4 hours or more.

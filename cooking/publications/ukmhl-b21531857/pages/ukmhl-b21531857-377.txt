CHAP. XIII.] 337 GAME. PARTRIDGES WITH MUSHROOMS. For a brace of young well-kept birds, prepare from half to three-quarters of a pint of mushroom buttons, or very small flaps, as for pickling. Dissolve over a gentle fire an ounce and a half of butter, throw in the mush- rooms with a slight sprinkling of salt and cayenne, simmer them from eight to ten minutes, and turn them, with the butter, on to a plate; when they are quite cold, put the whole into the bodies of the partridges, sew them up, truss them securely, and roast them on a ver- tical jack with the heads downwards; or should an ordinary spit be used, tie them firmly to it, instead of passing it through them. Roast them the usual time, and serve them with brown mushroom-sauce, or with gravy and bread-sauce only. The birds may be trussed like boiled fowls, floured, and lightly browned in butter, then half covered with rich brown gravy and stewed slowly for thirty minutes, then turned, and simmered for another half hour with the addition of some mush- rooms to the gravy; or they may be covered with small mushrooms stewed apart, when they are sent to table. They can also be served with their sauce only, simply thickened with a small quantity of fresh butter, smoothly mixed with less than a teaspoonful of arrow-root and flavoured with cayenne and a little catsup, wine, or store-sauce. Partridges, 2; mushrooms, i to f pint; butter, 1^ oz.; little mace and cayenne: roasted 30 to 40 minutes, or stewed 1 hour. Obs.—Nothing can be finer than the game flavour imbibed by the mushrooms with which the birds are filled, in this receipt. BROILED PARTRIDGE. {Breakfast dish.) “ Split a young and well-kept partridge, and wipe it with a soft clean cloth inside and out, but do not wash it; broil it delicately over a very clear fire, sprinkling it z

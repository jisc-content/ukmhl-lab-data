BEEF. CHAP. VIII.] 229 A RICHER VARIETY OF MINCED COLLOPS. Omit the minced herbs from the thickening, and season it with cayenne and a small quarter-teaspoonful of pounded mace. Substitute beef-gravy for the boil- ing water, and when the collops are nearly done, fill a wineglass with one-fourth of mushroom catsup, and three of port wine, and stir these to the meat. Serve the collops very hot, and garnish them with alternate forcemeat balls (see No. 1, page 170,) and fried sippets. If flavoured with a little gravy made from the bones of a roast hare, and served with currant-jelly, these collops would scarcely be distinguished from game.

Stew it well,, and in a few minutes it will be fit to serve.” BEEF TONGUES. These may be cured by any of the receipts which we have already given for pickling beef, or for those which will be found further on for hams and bacon. Some persons prefer them cured with salt and saltpetre only, and dried naturally in a cool and airy room. For such of our readers as like them highly and richly flavoured we give our own method of having them prepared, which is this :—Rub the tongue over with a handful of fine salt, and let it drain until the following day ; then, should it weigh from seven to eight pounds, mix tho- roughly an ounce of saltpetre, two ounces of the coarsest sugar, and half an ounce of black pepper ; when the tongue has been well rubbed with these, add three ounces of bruised juniper-berries; and when it has laid two days, eight ounces of bay-salt, dried and pounded ;

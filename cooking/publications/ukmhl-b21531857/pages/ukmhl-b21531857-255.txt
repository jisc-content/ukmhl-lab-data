First rub them well with salt, to take off the slime ; then wash them thoroughly in several waters, and leave them to soak for half an hour before they are dressed. Set them over the fire in cold water, and boil them gently until the skin will peel off, and the palates are tolerably tender. It is difficult to state the exact time required for this, as some will be done enough in twTo hours and a half, and others in not less than from four to five hours. When thus prepared, the palates may be cut into various forms, and simmered till fit to

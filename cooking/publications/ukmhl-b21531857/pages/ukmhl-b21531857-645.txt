603 CHAP. XXII.] PICKLES. PICKLED ONIONS. Take the smallest onions that can be procured, just after they are harvested, for they are never in so good a state for the purpose as then ; proceed, after having peeled them, exactly as for the eschalots, and when they begin to look clear, which will be in three or four minutes, put them into jars, and pour the pickle on them. The vinegar should be very pale, and their colour will then be exceedingly well preserved. Any favourite spices can be added to it. TO PICKLE LEMONS, AND LIMES.

This pickle will remain good for seven years if the lemons be kept well covered with vinegar ; that which is added to them should be boiled and then left till cold before it is poured into the jar. The lemons will not

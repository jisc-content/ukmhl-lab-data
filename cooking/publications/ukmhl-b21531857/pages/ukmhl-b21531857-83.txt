Butter, 4 ozs.; vegetable marrow, pared and scooped, •3 lbs.; large mild onions, 4 ; large cucumbers, 4; or middling sized, 6; apples, or tomatas, 3 to 6 : thirty to forty minutes. Mild currie-powder, 3 heaped table- spoonsful ; salt, one small tablespoonful: twenty to thirty minutes. Water, broth, or good stock, 2 quarts. CUCUMBER SOUP. Pare, split, and empty from eight to twenty* fine, well grown, but not old cucumbers,—those which have the fewest seeds are best for the purpose; throw a little salt over them, and leave them for an hour to drain, then put them with the white part only of a couple of mild onions, into a deep stewpan, or delicately clean saucepan, cover them nearly half an inch with pale, but good veal stock, and stew them gently until they are perfectly tender, which will be in from three quarters of an hour, to an hour and a quarter; press the whole through a hair-sieve, and add to it as much more stock as may be needed to make the quantity of soup required for table; and as the cucumbers, from their watery nature, will thicken it but little, stir to it when it boils, as much arrow-root, rice-flour, or tous les mois (see page 4), as will bring it to a good consistency; add from half to a whole pint of boiling cream, and serve the soup imme- diately. Salt and cayenne, sufficient to season it. should be thrown over the cucumbers when they are stewing. The yolks of six or eight eggs, mixed with a dessert- spoonful of Chili vinegar, may be used for this soup instead of cream; three dessertspoonsful of minced pars- ley may then be strewed into it a couple of minutes * This is a great disparity of numbers j but some regard must b e had to expense, where the vegetable cannot be obtained with facility.

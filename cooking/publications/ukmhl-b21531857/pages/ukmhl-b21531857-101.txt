CHAP. II.] 63 PISH. TURBOT A LA CREME. Raise carefully from the bones the flesh of a cold turbot, and clear it from the dark skin, cut it into small squares, and put it into an exceedingly clean stewpan or saucepan; then make and pour upon it the cream- sauce of Chapter IV., or make as much as may be required for the fish by the same receipt, with equal proportions of milk and cream, and a little additional flour.

MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. IX. 242 fifteen minutes. Mince as much more of the head as will make up a pound in weight after any discoloured edges are trimmed off, and part of the fat is taken away; add to this three ounces of the lean of a boiled ham chopped fine, the grated rind of a large lemon, three teaspoonsful of parsley and one of thyme shred very small, three quarters of a teaspoonful of mace, half a small nutmeg grated, a teaspoonfUl of salt, and a half-quarter one of cayenne; stir the whole well together, and put it, with half a pint more of gravy, to the portion that has been already simmered. When the whimsey has boiled softly from four to five minutes, pour it into moulds or pans, in which slices of the tongue have been evenly arranged, and when quite cold it will turn out very firmly. When sent to table it may be garnished with branches of parsley, which should, however, be perfectly dry; and when served for supper or luncheon, it may be accompanied by salad-sauce. Calf’s head, 1 lb.; lean of ham, 3 ozs.; gravy, 1J pint; rind of 1 large lemon; parsley. 3 teaspoonsful ; thyme and salt, each 1 teaspoonful; mace, j teaspoon- ful ; \ nutmeg; cayenne, £ part of teaspoonful : 5 minutes. Obs.—The remains of a plain boiled head may be made to serve for this dish, provided the gravy Used with it be well jellied and of high flavour. Slices from the small end of a boiled and smoked ox-tongue, from their bright colour improve greatly the appearance of the whimsey, which should be tasted before it is poured out, that salt or any other seasoning may be added if needful. After three or four days’ keeping, should any mould appear on the surface, take it off, re-melt the whimsey, and give it two minutes boil. For change, the herbs may be omitted, and the quantity of ham increased, or some minced tongue substituted for it. CUTLETS OF CALL’S HEAD. Prepare, by the cook’s receipt, half a calf’s head with

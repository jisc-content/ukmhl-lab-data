Excellent broth for the sick or for the needy, may also be made of them at little cost, when they are not required for other uses. To deepen the colour of gravies, the thick mushroom pressings of Chapter V., or a little soy (when its flavour is admissible), or cavice, or Harveyâ€™s sauce, may be added to it; and for some dishes, a glass of claret, or of port wine.

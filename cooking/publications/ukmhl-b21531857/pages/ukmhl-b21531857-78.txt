MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. I. 42 slight seasoning of mace, cayenne, and salt, then turned into the mortar and pounded with the other ingredients, will be found an excellent addition to the soup, which must be passed through a strainer after the breasts are added to if; brought to the point of boiling; and served with sippets a la Reine, or others simply fried of a deli- cate brown and well dried. We have occasionally had a small quantity of delicious soup made with the remains of birds that have been served at table; and where game is frequently dressed, the cook, by reserving all the fragments for the purpose, and combining different kinds, may often send up a good tureen of such, made at a very slight cost. Pheasants, 2; stock, 5 pints; bread soaked in gravy, (see Panada, Chapter VI.,) nearly as much in bulk as the flesh of the breasts of the birds; mushrooms, J pint, stewed in 1 to 2 ozs. of butter 10 to 15 minutes, then pounded with flesh of pheasants. Salt, cayenne, and mace, to season properly. PARTRIDGE SOUP. This is, we think, superior in flavour to the pheasant- soup. It should be made in precisely the same manner, but three birds allowed for it instead of two. Grouse and partridges together will make a still finer one ; the remains of roast grouse even, added to a brace of par- tridges, will produce a very good effect. MULL AG AT AWN Y SOUP. Slice, and fry gently in some good butter three or four large onions, and when they are of a fine equal amber- colour lift them out with a slice and put them into a deep stewpot, or large thick saucepan; throw a little more butter into the pan, and then brown lightly in it a young rabbit, or the prime joints of two, or a fowl cut down small, and floured. When the meat is sufficiently browned, lay it upon the onions, pour gradually to them a quart of good boiling stock, and stew it gently from three quarters of an hour to an hour; then take it out,

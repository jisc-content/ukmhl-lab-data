IX.] slowly as possible, and when half-done, a couple of glasses of white wine or of rich gravy are added to them ; minced herbs are also sometimes strewed be- tween the layers of meat. Yeal, 3 lbs.; bacon, 1 lb.; salt, 1 dessertspoonful; mace and nutmeg, 1 teaspoonful each ; pepper, 11 tea- spoonful ; rinds of lemons, 2 : simmered 2-1 hours. NORMAN HARRICO. Brown in a stewpan, or fry lightly, after having sprinkled them with pepper, salt and flour, from two to three pounds of veal cutlets. If taken from the neck, chop the bones very short, and trim away the greater part of the fat. .Arrange them as flat as they can be in a saucepan, give a pint of hot water a boil in the pan in which they have been browned, and pour it on them: add a small faggot of parsley, and, should the flavour be approved, one of green onions also. Let the meat simmer softly for half an hour; then cover it with small new potatoes which have had a single boil in water, give the saucepan a shake, and let the harrico stew very gently for another half hour, or until the potatoes are quite done, and the veal is tender. When the cutlets are thick and the potatoes approaching their full size, more time will be required for the meat, and the vege- tables may be at once divided; if extremely young they will not need the previous boil. Before the harrico is served, skim the fat from it, and add salt and pepper should it not be sufficiently seasoned. A few bits of lean ham, or shoulder of bacon browned with the veal, will much improve this dish, and for some tastes, a little acid will render it more agreeable. Yery delicate pork chops may be dressed in the same way. Yeal, 2 to 3 lbs.; water (or gravy), 1 pint; new potatoes, to 2 lbs.; faggot, parsley and green onions : 1 hour or more. VEAL CUTLETS.

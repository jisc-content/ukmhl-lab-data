[CHAP. I. 24 MODERN COOKERY * A QUICKLY MADE TURNIP SOUP. Pare and slice into three pints of veal or mutton stock, or of good broth, three pounds of young mild turnips; stew them gently from twenty-five to thirty minutes, or until they can be reduced quite to pulp; press the whole through a sieve, add to it another quart of stock, a seasoning of salt, white pepper, and one lump of sugar; simmer it a minute or two, skim and serve it.

Potatoes, 3 lbs.; broth, 2 quarts ; 5 minutes. (With onions, 2 oz., 10 minutes.) APPLE SOUP. (Soupe a la Bourgaignon.)

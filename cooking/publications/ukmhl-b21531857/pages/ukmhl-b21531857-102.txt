Stir into the fish-kettle eight ounces of common salt to the gallon of water; let it boil quickly for a minute or two, take off all the scum, put in the salmon and boil it moderately fast, if it be small, but more gently should it be very thick; and assure yourself that it is quite sufficiently done before it is sent to table, for nothing can be more distasteful, even to the eye, than fish which is under dressed. From two to three pounds of the thick part of a fine salmon will require half an hour to boil it; but eight or ten pounds will be done enough in little more than double that time; less, in proportion to its weight, should be allowed for a small fish, or for the thin end of a large one. Do not allow the salmon to remain in the water after it is ready to serve, or both its flavour and appear- ance will be injured. Dish it on a hot napkin, and send dressed cucumber, and anchovy, shrimp, or lobster sauce, and a tureen of plain melted butter to table with it. To each gallon water, 8 ozs. salt. Salmon, 2 to 3 lbs. (thick) \ hour; 8 to 10 lbs., 1 hour and J; small, or thin fish, less time. CRIMPED SALMON. Cut in slices an inch and a half, or two inches thick, the body of a salmon quite newly caught; throw them, into strong salt and water as they are done, but do not let them soak in it; wash them well, lay them on a fish-plate, and put them into fast-boiling -water, salted, and well skimmed. In from ten to fifteen minutes they will be done. Dish them on a napkin, and send them very hot to table with lobster sauce, and plain melted butter; or with the caper fish-sauce of Chapter IY. The water should be salted as for salmon boiled in the ordinary way, and the scum should be cleared off* with great care after the fish is in. In boiling water, 10 to 15 minutes.

Season the steaks with fine salt and pepper, dip them into a little clarified butter, and broil them over a clear, brisk fire. Mix a teaspoonful of parsley, minced extremely fine, with a large slice of fresh butter, a little cayenne, and a small quantity of salt. When the steaks are done, put the mixture in the dish intended for them, and lay them upon it; garnish them plenti- fully with fried potatoes.

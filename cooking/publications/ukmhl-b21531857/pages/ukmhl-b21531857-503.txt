We have eaten tomatas raw without any thing;—cut up with pepper, salt, vinegar, and mustard ;—fried in butter and in lard ;—broiled and basted with butter;—stewed with and without bread, with cream and with butter;—and, with a clear con- science, we can say, we like them in every way they have ever been fixed for the palate ; but of all the modes of dressing them, known to us, we prefer them when cooked in dumplings, for to us it appears that the steam- ing they receive in their dough-envelope increases in a very high degree that delicate spicy flavour which even in their uncooked state make them such decided favourites with the epicure.” Ohs.—It is possible that the tomata, which is, we know, abundantly grown and served in a great variety of forms in America, may there, either from a difference of climate, or from some advantages of culture, be pro- duced in greater perfection than with us, and possess really “ the delicate spicy flavour ” attributed to it in our receipt, but which we cannot say we have ever yet discovered here; nor have we put its excellence for pud- dings to the proof, though some of our readers may like to do so.

These are boiled in small knitted or closely-netted cloths (the former have, we think, the prettiest effect), which give quite an ornamental appearance to an other- wise homely dish. Take out the cores without dividing the apples, which should be large, and of a good boiling sort, and fill the cavity with orange or lemon marmalade, enclose them in a good crust rolled thin, draw the cloths round them, tie them closely and boil them three- quarters of an hour. Lemon dumplings may be boiled in the same way. | to 1 hour, if the apples be not of the best boiling kind.

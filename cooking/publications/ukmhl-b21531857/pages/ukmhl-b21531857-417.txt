Chop together very small, two moderate-sized cu- cumbers, with half the quantity of mild onion ; add the juice of a lemon, a saltspoonful or more of salt, a third as much of cayenne, and one or two glasses of Madeira, or of any other dry white wine.

When all are done, sprinkle them with cayenne and fine salt, and leave them to drain a little; then arrange them lightly in a clean dish, and sauce them with very fine oil, well mixed with Chili-vinegar, or with equal parts of Chili and of common vinegar. Cucumbers, 2 or 3 ; salt, 1 to 2 saltspoonsful; little cayenne; oil, 6 to 8 tablespoonsful; Chili-vinegar, or equal parts of this and common vinegar, 2 to 4 table- spoonsful.

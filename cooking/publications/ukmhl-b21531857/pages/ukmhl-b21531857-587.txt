545 CHAP. XX.] SWEET DISHES* Send the charlotte to a brisk oven for three-quarters of an hour should it be small, and for an hour if large. Turn it out with great care, and serve it hot. If baked in a slack oven it will not take a proper de- gree of colour, and it will be liable to break in the dishing. The strips of bread must of course join very perfectly, for if any spaces were left between them the syrup of the fruit would escape, and destroy the good appearance of the dish. Should there not have been sufficient marmalade prepared to fill the mould en- tirely, a jar of quince, or apricot-jam, or of preserved cherries even, may be added to it with advantage. The butter should be well drained from the charlotte before it is taken from the mould ; and sugar may be sifted thickly over it before it is served, or it may be covered with any kind of clear red jelly. A more elegant, aud we think an easier mode of forming the crust, is to line the mould with small rounds of bread stamped out with a plain cake, or paste-cutter, then dipped in butter, and placed with the edges sufficiently one over the other to hold the fruit securely. | hour to 1 hour, quick oven. MARMALADE FOR THE CHARLOTTE. Weigh three pounds of good boiling apples, after they have been pared, cored, and quartered ; put them into a stewpan with six ounces of fresh butter, three- quarters of a pound of sugar beaten to powder, three- quarters of a teaspoonful of pounded cinnamon, and the strained juice of a lemon ; let these stew over a gentle fire, until they form a perfectly smooth and dry mar- malade ; keep them often stirred that they may not burn, and let them cool before they are put into the crust. This quantity is for a moderate-sized charlotte. A CHARLOTTE A LA PARISIENNE. This dish is sometimes called in England a Vienna cake ; and it is known here also, we believe, as a Gateaux N N

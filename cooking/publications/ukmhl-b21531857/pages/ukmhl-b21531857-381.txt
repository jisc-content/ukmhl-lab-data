341 GAME. GHAP. XIII.] four ounces of the lean of an unboiled ham, and put it, with two ounces of butter, into a thick well-tinned saucepan, or stewpan; add three or four minced eschalots (more, should a high flavour of them be liked), two ounces of sliced carrot, four cloves, two bay-leaves, a dozen peppercorns, one blade of mace, a small sprig or tw'o of thyme, and part of a root of parsley, or two or three small branches of the leaves. Stew these over a gentle fire, stirring, or shaking them often, until the sides of the saucepan appear of a reddish-brown, then mix well in a dessertspoonful of flour, and let it take a little colour; next, add by degrees, making the sauce boil as each portion is thrown in, three quarters of a pint of strong veal stock, or gravy, and nearly half a pint of sherry or Madeira; put in the well-bruised bodies of the birds, and boil them from an hour to an hour and a half; strain, and clear the sauce quite from fat, pour it on the joints of game, heat them in it slowly, and when they are near the point of boiling, dish them immediately with delicately fried sippets round the dish. When mushrooms can be obtained, throw a dozen or two small ones, with the other seasonings, into the butter. The wine 'is sometimes added to the vegetables, and one half reduced before the gravy is added ; but though a sauce of fine colour is thus produced, the flavour of the wine is entirely lost. TO ROAST WOODCOCKS OR SNIPES. Handle them as little and as lightly as possible, and pluck off the feathers gently; for if this be violently done the skin of the birds will be broken. Do not draiv them, but after having wiped them with clean soft cloths, truss them with the head under the wing, and the bill laid close along the breast; pass a slight skewer through the thighs, catch the ends with a bit of Snipe.

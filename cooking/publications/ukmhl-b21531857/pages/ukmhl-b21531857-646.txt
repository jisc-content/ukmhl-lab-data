604 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XXII. be fit for table in less than twelve months ; but if wanted for more immediate use, set them for one night into a cool oven after the bread is drawn; they may then be eaten almost directly. * TO PICKLE BARBERRIES AND SIBERIAN CRABS. When wanted for garnishing only, take the fruit before it is very ripe, cut half the length of their stalks from the crabs, and free the barberries from the leaves, and from any discoloured berries that may be amongst them. Put them into stone jars, and cover them well with brine, which has been boiled and left to become per- fectly cold. Look at them occasionally during the winter, and should any scum or mould have gathered on the surface, clear it well off, drain the brine closely from the fruit, and fill the jars with some that is freshly made. Six ounces of salt, and a morsel of alum half the size of a bean to the quart of water should be boiled together for ten minutes and well skimmed, both for the first brine, and for any that may be required afterwards. To pickle these fruits in vinegar, add the alum to a sufficient quantity to cover them, and boil it with a few white pepper-corns, which must be strained out before it is poured into the jars, it must be quite cold when added to the barberries or crabs; these last should not be ripe wffien they are used, or they will burst in the pickle; they should have attained their growth and full colour, but be still hard. * The turmeric and the garlic may be omitted from this pickle with advantage, we think. Limes must have but slight incisions made in the rinds; and they will be sufficiently softened in four or five days. Two ounces of salt only will be required for half a dozen; and all which remains unmelted must, with their juice, be put into the jar wiih them before the vinegar is poured on : this should be mixed with spice and mustard-seed, and be boiling when it is added to the limes.

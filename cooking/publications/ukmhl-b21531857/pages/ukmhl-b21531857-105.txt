FISH. 67 CHAP. II.] for a couple of minutes, lift out the fish carefully with a slice, pour the sauce over, and serve it quickly. Cod fish, 3 lbs. : boiled 5 minutes. Gravy, or strong broth, nearly 1 pint : 5 minutes. Bread crumbs, 4 tablespoonsful: 3 minutes. Arrow-root, 1 large tea- spoonful ; mace, J teaspoonful; less of cayenne; essence of anchovies, 1 tablespoonful; lemon-juice, 1 dessertspoonful; sherry or Madeira, 1 winegiassful : 2 minutes.

STEWED COD FISH, IN BROWN SAUCE. Slice the fish, take off the skin, flour it well, and fry it quickly a fine brown, lift it out and drain it on the back of a sieve, arrange it in a clean stew-pan, and pour in as much good brown gravy, boiling, as will nearly cover it; add from one to two glasses of port wine, or rather more of claret, a dessertspoonful of Chili vinegar, or the juice of half a lemon, and some cayenne, with as much salt as may be needed. Stew the fish very softly until it just begins to break, lift it carefully with a slice into a very hot dish, stir into the gravy an ounce and a half of butter, smoothly kneaded with a large teaspoon- ful of flour, and a little pounded mace, give the sauce a minute’s boil, pour it over the fish, and serve it imme- diately. The wine may be omitted, good shin of beef stock substituted for the gravy, and a teaspoonful of soy, one of essence of anchovies, and two tablespoonsful of Harvey’s sauce added to flavour it.

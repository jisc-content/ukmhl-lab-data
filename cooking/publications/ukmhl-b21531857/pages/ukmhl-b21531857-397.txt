Scrape the anchovies very clean, raise the flesh from the bones, and pound it to a perfect paste in a Wedg- wood or marble mortar; then with the back of a wooden spoon press it through a hair-sieve reversed. Next weigh the anchovies, and pound them again with double their weight of the freshest butter that can be procured, a high seasoning of mace and cayenne, and a small quantity of finely-grated nutmeg ; set the mix- ture by in a cool place for three or four hours to harden it before it is put into the potting pans.

The flesh, of the lobster may be cut fine with a very sharp knife, and pounded with the coral. POTTED SHRIMPS. {Delicious.) Let the fish be quite freshly boiled, shell them quickly, and just before they are put into the mortar, chop them

CHAP.

Water, 1 pint; sugar, f lb. : 15 minutes. Straw- berries, 1 quart; isinglass, 21 ozs. ; water, 1 pint (white of egg 1 to 2 teaspoonful) ; juice, 1 large or 2 small lemons. Obs.â€”The juice of any fruit mixed with sufficient sugar to sweeten, and of isinglass to stiffen it, with as much lemon-juice as will take off the insipidity of the flavour, will serve for this kind of jelly. Pine-apples, peaches, and such other fruits as do not yield much juice, iriust be infused in a larger quantity of syrup, which must then be used in lieu of it. In this same manner jellies are made with various kinds of wine and liqueurs, and with the ingredients for punch as well; but we cannot further multiply our receipts for them. FANCY JELLIES. To give greater transparency of ap- pearance to jelly, it is made often in a mould of this form, or a variation of it, somewhat resem- bling the lower com- partment of this. The space left in the centre is sometimes filled with very light, whipped cream, fla- voured and coloured so as to eat agree- ably with it, and to please the eye as well: this may be Mould with cylinder.

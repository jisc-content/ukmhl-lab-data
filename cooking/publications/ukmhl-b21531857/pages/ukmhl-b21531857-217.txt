CHAP. VI.] FORCEMEATS. 179 minutes. Bacon or butter, 3 ozs. ; bread-crumbs, 2 ozs. ; lemon-peel and salt, 1 teaspoonful each. NO, 16. AN EXCELLENT FRENCH FORCEMEAT. Take six ounces of veal free from fat and skin, cut it into dice and put it into a saucepan with two ounces of butter, a large teaspoonful of parsley finely minced, half as much thyme, salt, and grated lemon-rind, and a sufficient seasoning of nutmeg, cayenne, and mace, to flavour it pleasantly. Stew these very gently from twelve to fifteen minutes, then lift out the veal and put into the saucepan two ounces of bread-crumbs; let them simmer till they have absorbed the gravy yielded by the meat, then keep them stirred till they are as dry as possible ; beat the yolk of an egg to them while they are hot, and set them aside to cool. Chop and pound the veal, add the bread to it as soon as it is cold, beat them well to- gether, with an ounce and a half of fresh butter, and two of the finest bacon, scraped quite clear from rust, skin, and fibre; put to them the yolks of two small eggs, and mix them well; then take the forcemeat from the mortar, and set it in a very cool place till it is wanted for use. Yeal, 6 ozs.; butter, 2 ozs.; minced parsley, 1 tea- spoonful ; thyme, salt, and lemon-peel, each ^ teaspoon- ful; little nutmeg, cayenne, and mace: 12 to 15 minutes. Bread-crumbs, 2 ozs. ; butter, 1^ oz. ; rasped bacon, 2 ozs.; yolks of egg, 2 to 3. Obs. 1.â€”When this forcemeat is intended to fill boned fowls, the livers of two or three, boiled for four minutes, or stewed with the veal for the same length of time, then minced and pounded with the other ingre- dients, will be found a great improvement; and, if mushrooms can be procured, two tablespoonsful of them chopped small, should be stewed and beaten with it also. A small portion of the best end of the neck will afford the quantity of lean required for this receipt, and the remains of it will make excellent gravy.

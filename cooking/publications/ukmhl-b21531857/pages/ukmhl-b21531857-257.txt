When these have simmered for two hours and a quarter, try the meat with a fork, and should it not be perfectly tender, let it remain over the fire till it is so. Ox-tails sometimes require nearly or quite three hoursâ€™ stewing: they may be served with the vegetables, or with the gravy strained from them, and thickened like the English stew, (see page 213.)

TO SALT AND PICKLE BEEF, IN VARIOUS WAYS. Let the meat hang a couple of days in mild weather, and four or five in winter, before it is salted or pickled. During the heat of summer it is better to immerse it entirely in brine, that it may be alike secured from the flies, and from the danger of becoming putrid. Trim it, and take out the kernels from the fat; then

151 SAUCES. CHAP. IV.] COMMON PUDDING SAUCE. Sweeten a quarter-pint of good melted butter with an ounce and a half of sugar, and add to it gradually a couple of glasses of wine; stir it until it is on the point of boiling. Lemon-grate, or nutmeg, can be added at pleasure. A DELICIOUS GERMAN PUDDING SAUCE. Dissolve in half a pint of Sherry or Madeira, from three to four ounces of fine sugar, but do not allow the v/ine to boil; pour it hot to the well-beaten yolks of six fresh eggs, and mill the sauce over a gentle fire until it is well thickened, and highly frothed; pour it over a plum, or any other kind of sweet boiled pudding, of which it much improves the appearance. Half the quantity will be sufficient for one of moderate size. A small machine, resembling a chocolate mill, is used in Germany for frothing this sauce; but a couple of silver forks, fastened together at the handles, will serve for the purpose, on an emergency. We recommend the addition of a dessert- spoonful of strained lemon-juice, to the wane. For large pudding, Sherry or Madeira, J pint; fine sugar, 3 to 4 ozs.; yolks of eggs, 6; lemon juice (if added], 1 dessertspoonful. Obs.â€”The safer plan with sauces liable to curdle, is to thicken them always in a jar, placed in a saucepan of water; when this is not done, they should be held over the fire, but never placed upon it.' PARSLEY GREEN, FOR COLOURING SAUCES. Gather a quantity of young parsley, strip it from the stalks, wash it very clean, shake it as dry as possible in a cloth, pound it in a mortar, press all the juice closely from it through a hair sieve reversed, and put it into a clean jar; set it into a pan of boiling water, and in about three minutes, if gently simmered, the juice will be poached sufficiently; lay it then upon a clean sieve to drain, and it will be ready for use.

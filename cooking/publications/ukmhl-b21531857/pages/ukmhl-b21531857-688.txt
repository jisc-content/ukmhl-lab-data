When it is of a fine, light, equal brown, which must be ascertained, till some little expe- rience has been acquired, by sliding back the door of the cylinder, and looking at it occasionally towards the end of the process, spread it quickly upon a large dish, and throw a folded cloth over it. Let it remain thus until it is quite cold ; then put it into canisters or bottles, and exclude the air carefully from it. Mr. Webster, in his admirable Encyclopaedia of Domestic Economy,* says, “ Mr. Donovan recommends, that, instead of roasting the coffee in an atmosphere of its own steam, it should first be dried in an iron pan, over a very gentle fire, being constantly stirred until the colour becomes yellow ; it is then to be pounded into coarse fragments, by no means too fine, each grain being divided into four or five parts only : it is then to be transferred to the roaster, and scorched to the proper degree. ” This plan we have not tried, because we have found the other to answer quite well; though Mr. Donovan’s might nevertheless prove a very supe- rior one. A roaster of the form shown here may be purchased for about fourteen shillings. * (Longman and Co.)

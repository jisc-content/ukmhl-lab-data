VEGETABLES. 383 CHAP. XV,] STEWED TOMATAS. Arrange them in a single layer, and pour to them as much gravy as will reach to half their height; stew them very softly till the under sides are done, then turn, and finish stewing them. Thicken the gravy with a little arrow-root and cream, or with flour and butter, and serve it round them. FORCED TOMATAS. (English Receipt.) Cut the stems quite close, slice off the tops of eight fine tomatas, and scoop out the insides; press the pulp through a sieve, and mix with it one ounce of fine crumbs of bread, one of butter, broken very small, some pepper, or cayenne, and salt. Fill the tomatas with the mixture, and bake them ten minutes in a moderate oven ; serve them with brown gravy in the dish. A few small mushrooms, stewed tender in a little butter, then minced and added to the tomata-pulp, will very much improve this receipt. Baked 10 minutes. FORCED TOMATAS. (French Receipt.) Let the tomatas be well shaped and of equal size; divide them nearly in the middle, leaving the blossom- side the largest, as this only is to be used; empty them carefully of their seeds and juice, and fill them with the following ingredients, which must previously be stewed tender in butter, but without being allowed to brown: minced mushrooms and shalofs, with a moderate pro- portion of parsley, some lean of ham, chopped small, a seasoning of cayenne, and a little fine salt, if needed ; let them cool? then mix with them about a third as much of fine crumbs of bread, and two yolks of eggs ; fill the tomatas, cover them with fine crumbs, moisten them with clarified butter, and bake them in a brisk oven until they are well coloured. Serve them as a garnish

To ensure their being free from lumps, it is better to pass them through a cullender or coarse hair- sieve, with a wooden spoon, though, when quite young, they may be worked sufficiently smooth without this. Put them into a clean saucepan and stir them constantly for some minutes over a gentle fire, that they may be very dry, then add some salt, a bit of fresh butter, and a little cream, or in lieu of this new milk (we wTould also recommend a seasoning of white pepper or cayenne when appearance and fashion are not particularly re- garded), and continue to simmer and to stir them for five or six minutes longer, or until they have quite absorbed all the liquid which has been poured to them. Serve them always as hot as possible. This is an excel- lent receipt. Turnips, weighed after they are pared, 3 lbs. : dried 5 to 8 minutes. Salt, 1 teaspoonful; butter, 1 oz. to 1-1 oz.; cream or milk, nearly pint: 5 or 6 minutes. TURNIPS IN WHITE SAUCE.

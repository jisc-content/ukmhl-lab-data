39 CHAP. I.] SOUPS. SUPERLATIVE HARE SOUP. Cut down a hare into joints, and put it into a soup- pot or large stewpan, with about a pound of lean ham, in thick slices, from three to six moderate-sized onions, three blades of mace, a faggot of thyme, sweet mar- joram, and parsley, and about three quarts of good beef- stock, Let it stew very gently for full two hours from the time of its first beginning to boil, and more, if the hare be old. Strain the soup and pound together very fine the slices of ham and all the flesh of the back, legs, and shoulders of the hare, and put this meat into a stewpan with the liquor in which it was boiled, the crumb of two French rolls, and half a pint of port- wine. Set it on the stove to simmer twenty minutes ; then rub it through a sieve, place it again on the stove till very hot, but do not let it boil; season it with salt and cayenne, and send it to table directly. Hare, one; ham, 12 to 16 ozs; onions, 3 to 6; mace, 3 blades ; faggot of savoury herbs ; beef-stock, 3 quarts: two hours. Crumb of 2 rolls ; port-wine, half a pint ; little salt and cayenne : 20 minutes. A LESS EXPENSIVE HARE SOUP. Pour on two pounds of neck or shin of beef, and a hare well washed and carved into joints, one gallon of cold water, and when it boils and has been thoroughly skimmed, add an ounce and a half of salt, two onions, one large head of celery, three moderate-sized carrots, a teaspoonful of black pepper-corns, and six cloves. Let these stew very gently for three hours, or longer, should the hare not be perfectly tender. Then take up the principal joints, cut the meat from them, mince, and pound it to a fine paste, with the crumb of two penny rolls (or two ounces of the crumb of household bread), that has been soaked in a little of the boiling soup, and then pressed very dry in a cloth ; strain, and mix smoothly with it, the stock from the remainder of the hare ; pass the soup through a strainer, season it

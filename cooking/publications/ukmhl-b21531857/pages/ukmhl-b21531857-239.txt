CHAP. VII.] BOILING, ROASTING, ETC. 201 breast of the pheasant is entirely garnished with lar- doons, when it ought to resemble in appearance a cake thickly stuck with slips of almonds. The larger strips of bacon, after being rolled in a high seasoning of minced herbs and spices, are used to lard the inside of meat, and they should be proportioned to its thickness, as they must be passed quite through it. For example : a four-inch slice from a rump of beef will require lardoons of very nearly that length, which must be drawn through with a large kirding-pin, and left in it, with the ends just out of sight on either side- In France, truffles, anchovies, slices of tongue, and of fat, all trimmed into proper shape, are occasionally used for larding. The bacon employed there for the purpose is cured without any saltpetre (as this would redden the white meats), and it is never smoked : the receipt for it will be found in Chapter XI. A turkey is sometimes larded with alternate lardoons of fat bacon and of bullock’s tongue, which has been pickled but not dried : we apprehend that the lean of a half-boiled ham, of good colour, could answer the pur- pose quite as well, or better. Larding the surface of meat, poultry, or game, gives it a good appearance, but it is a more positive improve- ment to meat of a dry nature to interlard the inside with large lardoons of well-seasoned, delicate, striped English bacon.

4.93 CHAP. XIX.] SOUFFLES, OMLETS, &C. New milk or cream, 1-J pint; flour of rice, 4 ozs.; fresh butter, 2 ozs.; pounded sugar, 1^ oz. ; eggs, 6; grain of salt ; rind, 1 lemon : 30 to 45 minutes. Obs.â€”The souffle may be flavoured with vanilla, orange-flowers, citron-rind, or ought else that is liked. Chocolate and coffee also may he used for it with soaked bread : a very strong infusion of the last, and an ounce or two of the other melted with a little water are to be added to the milk and bread. KENTISH FRITTERS. Beat up the whites of three eggs and the yolks of six with half a pound of flour, a cupful of milk, and a large teaspoonful of yeast; put the mixture into a jug, cover it, and set it by the fire until the next day, then add to the batter two large apples chopped fine, and fry the fritters as usual. Whites of eggs, 3 ; yolks, 6; flour, 8 ozs.; milk, one cupful; yeast, 1 teaspoonful: 24 hours. PLAIN COMMON FRITTERS. Mix with three well beaten eggs a quarter-pint of milk, and strain them through a fine sieve; add them gradually to three large tablespoonsful of flour, and thin the batter witli as much more milk as will bring it to the consistence of cream ; beat it up thoroughly at the moment of using it, that the fritters may be light. Drop it in small portions from a spouted jug or basin into boiling lard; when lightly coloured on one side, turn them, drain them well from the lard as they are lifted out, and serve them very quickly. They are eaten generally with fine sugar, and orange or lemon juice: the first of these may be sifted thickly over them after they are dished, the oranges or lemons cut in two, and sent to table with them. The lard used for frying them should be fresh and pure-flavoured : it renders them more crisp and light than butter, and is, therefore, better suited to the purpose. Eggs, 3 ; flour, 3 tablespoonsful; milk, J to pint.

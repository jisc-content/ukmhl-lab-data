407 PASTRY. CHAP. XVI.] VERY SUPERIOR SUET-CRUST* Strip the skin entirely from some fresh real or beef kidney-suet; chop, and then put it into the mortar, with a small quantity of pure-flavoured lard, oil, or butter, and pound it perfectly smooth : it may then be used for crust in the same way that butter is in making puff-paste, and in this form will be found a most excellent substitute for it, for hot pies or tarts. It is not quite so good for those which are to be served cold. Eight ounces of suet pounded with two of but- ter, and worked with the fingers into a pound of flour will make an exceedingly good short crust; but for a very rich one the proportion must be increased. Good short crust: flour 1 lb.; suet, 8 ozs. ; butter, 2 ozs.; salt, | teaspoonful. Richer crust: suet 16 ozs. ; butter, 4 ozs.; flour, 1J lb.; salt, 1 small teaspoonful. VERY RICH SHORT CRUST FOR TARTS.

Flour, 8 ozs. ; butter, 6 ozs. ; pounded sugar, 1 des- sertspoonful ; water, 1 to 2 spoonsful. BRIOCHE PASTE. The brioche is a rich, light kind of unsweetened bun, or cake, very commonly sold, and served to all classes of people in France, where it is made in great perfection by good cooks and pastrycooks. It is fashionable now at English tables, though in a different form, serving principally as a crust to enclose rissoles, or to make cannelons and fritters. We have seen it recommended for a vol-au-vent, for which we should say it does not answer by any means so well as the fine puff-paste called feuilletage. The large proportion of butter and

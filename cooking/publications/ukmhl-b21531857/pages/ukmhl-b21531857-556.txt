In from twenty-five to thirty minutes draw the pan from the fire, and throw in gra- dually a pound and a quarter of sugar in fine powder ; mix it well with the fruit, and when it is dissolved continue the boiling rapidly for twenty minutes longer, keeping the mixture constantly stirred put it into a mould, and store it, when cold, for winter use; or serve it for dessert, or for the second course : in the latter

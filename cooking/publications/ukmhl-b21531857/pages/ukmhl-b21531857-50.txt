The same paste may be cut into very small diamond squares, stars, or any other form, then left to dry a little, and boiled in the soup till swelled to its full size, and tender. Nouille paste of four eggs; soup, 5 pints: 10 minutes. SAGO SOUP. Wash in several waters, and float off the dirt from six ounces of sago; put it into three quarts of good cold gravy-stock, and let it stew gently from half to three quarters of an hour ; stir it occasionally, that it may not burn nor stick to the stew-pan. A quarter- ounce more of sago to each pint of liquid, will thicken it to the consistency of peas-soup.

Sago, 6 ozs. ; soup, 3 quarts : 30 to 45 minutes. TAPIOCA SOUP. This is made in the same manner, and with the same proportions as the preceding soup, but it must be simmered from fifty to sixty minutes. RICE SOUP.

Pick, and wipe in a dry cloth, eight ounces of the best rice ; add it, in small portions, to four quarts of hot soup, of which the boiling should not be checked as it is thrown in. When a clear soup is wanted, wash the rice, give it five minutes’ boil in water, drain it well, throw it into as much boiling stock or well-flavoured broth as

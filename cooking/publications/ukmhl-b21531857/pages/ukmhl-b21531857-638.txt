MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XXI 596 of the cores; then heat them, with the sugar, in a large mortar, and pick out as this is done any bits of fibre or coarse inner skin which cannot be reduced to a paste. When the whole forms a smooth conserve, put it into small jars for use, as it requires no boiling after the fruit and sugar are mixed : if stored in a dry place it will remain good for two years.

5 CHAP. I.] SOUPS. gradually with a little cold stock or water, stirred into the boiling soup, and simmered a minute. Six ounces of flour with as much butter, will be required to thicken a tureen of soup ; as much as half a pound is sometimes used; these must be added by de- grees and carefully stirred round in the soup till smoothly blended with it, or they will remain in lumps. All the ingredients used for soups should be fresh, and of good quality, particularly Italian pastes of every kind (maccaroni, vermicelli, &c.), as they contract, by long keeping, a peculiarly unpleasant, musty flavour. Onions, freed from the outer skin, dried gradually to a deep brown, in a slow oven, and flattened like Nor- folk biffins, will keep for almost any length of time, and are extremely useful for heightening the colour and flavour of broths and gravies.* * TO FRY BREAD TO SERVE WITH SOUP. Cut some slices a quarter-inch thick, from a stale loaf; pare off the crust, and divide the bread into dice, or cut it with a deep paste-cutter into any other form. For half a pound of bread put two ounces of the best butter into a frying-pan, and when it is quite melted, add the bread; keep it turned, over a gentle fire, until it is equally coloured to a very pale brown, then drain it from the butter, and dry it on a soft cloth, or a sheet of paper placed before a clear fire, upon a dish, or on a sieve reversed. even than arrow root, which it resembles in appearance, and in the effect which it produces : it should be used in about the same proportions and in exactly the same manner. When good it appears to us to be entirely flavourless,. As it is now constantly adver- tised for sale, the reader will be at no loss to obtain it. * The fourth part of one of these dried onions, (des oignons brul6s) of moderate size, is sufficient for a tureen of soup. They are sold very commonly in France, and may be procured, we should suppose, without difficulty in London, at the foreign warehouses.

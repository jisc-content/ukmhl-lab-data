STEWED CELERY. Cut five or six fine roots of celery to the length of the inside of the dish in which they are to be served; free them from all the coarser leaves, and from the green tops, trim the root ends neatly, and wash the vegetable in several waters till it is as clean as possible; then, either boil it tender, with a little salt, and a bit of fresh butter the size of a walnut, in just sufficient water to cover it quite, drain it well, arrange it on a very hot dish, and pour a thick bechamel, or white-sauce over it; or stew it in broth or common stock, and serve it with very rich, thickened, Espagnole or brown gravy.

When large, but not mild onions are used, they should be first boiled for half an hour in plenty of

CHAP. V.] STORE-SAUCES. 163 ready pulped through a strainer. Boil the whole for thirty minutes longer; have some clean bottles, kept warm by the fire, fill them with the catsup while it is quite hot; cork, and rosin them down directly. Tomatas, \ peck ; salt/J lb.; capsicums, 3 doz.; escha- lots, \ lb. : \ hour. After pulp is added, -l hour. Obs.—This receipt has been kindly contributed by a person who makes by it every year large quantities of the catsup, which is considered excellent : for sauce, it must be mixed with gravy, or melted butter. We have not ourselves been able to make trial of it. EPICUREAN SAUCE. Mix well together, by shaking them in about a quarter pint of Indian soy, half a pint of Chili vinegar, half a pint of walnut catsup, and a pint and a half of the best mushroom catsup. These proportions make an excellent sauce, either to mix with melted butter, and to serve with fish, or to add to different kinds of gravy ; but they can be varied, or added to, at pleasure. Indian soy, J pint; Chili vinegar, \ pint; walnut catsup, \ pint; mushroom catsup, 11 pint. Obs.—A pint of port wine, a few eschalots, and some thin strips of lemon-rind will convert this into an admirable store-sauce. Less soy would adapt it better to some tastes. TARRAGON VINEGAR.

When it is poured off strain it very clear, put it into small dry bottles, and cork them well. Sweet

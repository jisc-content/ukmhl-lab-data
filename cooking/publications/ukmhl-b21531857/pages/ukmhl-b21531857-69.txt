CHAP. I.] SOUPS. 33 fried a fine brown, well drained and dried; and as many egg-balls, the size of a small marble, as four yolks of egg will supply. (See Chapter VI.) This quantity will be sufficient for two large tureens of soup: when the whole is not wanted for table at the same time, it is better to add wine only to so much as will be required for immediate consumption, or if it cannot conveniently be divided, to heat the wine in a small saucepan with a little of the soup, to turn it into the tureen, and then to mix it with the remainder by stirring the whole gently after the tureen is filled. Some persons simply put in the cold wine just before the s6up is dished, but this is not so well. Whole calf’s head with skin on, boiled 1J hour. Stock : neck of beef, browned in butter, 8 lbs.; lean of ham, J to J lb. (or a knuckle); onions, 4; carrots, large, 3; heads of celery, 3 ; large bunch sweet herbs ; salt, 2 ozs. (as much more to be added when the soup is made as will season it sufficiently) ; thin rind, one lemon ; pepper-corns, one dessertspoonful; bones and trimmings of head: eight hours. Soup : stock, 4 to 5 quarts; flour and butter for thickening of each, 4 ozs.; pounded mace, half - teaspoonful; cayenne, third as much (more of each as needed) ; sherry, half pint : two to three minutes. Flesh of head and tongue, nearly or quite, 2 lbs. : one hour and a quarter to one hour and a half. Forcemeat-balls, 36; the brain cut and fried; egg balls, 16 to 24. Ohs.—-When the brain is not blanched it must be cut thinner in the form of small cakes, or it will not be done through by the time it has taken enough colour: it may be altogether omitted without much detriment to the soup, and will make an excellent corner dish, if gently stewed in white gravy for half an hour, and served with it thickened with cream and arrow-root, to the consistency of good white sauce, then rather highly seasoned, and mixed with plenty of chopped parsley, and some lemon-juice.

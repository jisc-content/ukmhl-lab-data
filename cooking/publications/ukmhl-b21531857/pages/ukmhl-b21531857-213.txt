175 CHAP. VI.] FORCEMEATS. by being well beaten in a large mortar after it is entirely mixed. NO. 8. FORCEMEAT FOR HARE. The first receipt of this chapter will be found very good for hare, without any variation; but the liver boiled for five minutes, and finely minced, may be added to it, when it is thought an improvement: another half ounce of butter and a small portion more of egg will then be required. A couple of ounces of rasped bacon, and a glass of port-wine are sometimes recommended for this forcemeat, but we think it is better without them, especially when slices of bacon are used to line the hare. A flavouring of minced onion, or eschalot can be added, when the taste is in its favour; or the forcemeat No. 3 may be substituted for this altogether. NO. 9. ONION AND SAGE STUFFING, FOR PORK, GEESE, OR DUCKS. Boil three large onions from ten to fifteen minutes, chop them small, and mix with them an equal quantity of bread-crumbs, a heaped tablespoonful of minced sage, an ounce of butter, a half saltspoonful of pepper, and twice as much of salt, and put them into the body of the goose ; part of the liver, boiled for two or three minutes, and shred fine, is sometimes added to these, and the whole is bound together with an egg yolk or two; but they are quite as frequently served without. The onions can be used raw, when their very strong flavour is not objected to, but the odour of the whole dish will then be somewhat overpowering. Large onions, 3; boiled 20 to 30 minutes. Sage, 2 to 3 dessertspoonsful (or J to f oz.); butter, 1 oz.; pepper, \ teaspoonful; salt, 3 teaspoonful. no. 10. mr. cookeâ€™s forcemeat for ducks or geese. Two parts of chopped onion, two parts of bread-crumbs, three of butter, one of pounded sage, and a seasoning of pepper and salt. This receipt we have not proved.

VEGETABLES. 391 CHAP. XV.] have been washed, wiped quite dry, and pared, slice the turnips nearly half an inch thick, and divide them into dice. Just dissolve an ounce of butter for each half- pound of the turnips, put them in as fiat as they can be, and stew them very gently indeed, from three-quarters of an hour to a full hour. Add a seasoning of salt and white pepper when they are half done. When thus prepared, they may be dished over fried, or nicely- broiled mutton cutlets, or served by themselves. For a small dish; turnips, Ij lb.; butter, 3 ozs.; seasoning of white pepper; salt, \ teaspoonful or more : f to 1 hour. Large dish, turnips, 2 lbs.; butter, 4 ozs. TURNIPS IN GRAVY. To a pound of turnips sliced and cut into dice, pour a quarter-pint of boiling veal-gravy, add a small lump of sugar, some salt and cayenne, or white pepper, and boil them quickly from fifty to sixty minutes. Serve them very hot. TO BOIL CARROTS. Wash the mould from them, and scrape the skin off lightly with the edge of a sharp knife, or, should this be objected to, pare them as thin and as equally as pos- sible ; in either case, free them from all blemishes, and should they be very large, split them across the tops a few inches down; rinse them well, and throw them into plenty of boiling water with some salt in it. The skin of very young carrots maybe rubbed off like that of new potatoes, and from twenty to thirty minutes will then be sufficient to boil them ; but at their full growth they will require from an hour and a half to two hours. It was formerly the custom to tie them in a cloth, and to wipe the skin from them with it after they were dressed; and old-fashioned cooks still use one to remove it; but all vegetables should, we think, be dished and served with the least possible delay after they are ready for table. Melted butter should accompany boiled carrots. Yery young carrots, 20 to. SO minutes. Full-grown ones, 1J to 2 hours.

582 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XXI. if done with exactness, will give a perfectly smooth and firm preserve, which may be moulded in small shapes, and turned out for table. To each pound clear damson-juice, lj lb. pearmains (or other good apples), pared and cored : 25 to 80 mi- nutes. Sugar, 14 ozs.: 10 minutes. EXCELLENT DAMSON CHEESE. When the fruit has been baked or stewed tender, as directed above, drain off the juice, skin and stone the damsons, pour back to them from a third to half of their juice, weigh and then boil them over a clear brisk fire until they form a quite dry paste ; add six ounces of ptfunded sugar for each pound of the plums; stir them off the fire till this is dissolved, then boil the preserve again without quitting or ceasing to stir it, until it leaves the pan quite dry, and adheres in a mass to the spoon. If it should not stick to the fingers when lightly touched, it will be sufficiently done to keep very long ; press it quickly into pans or moulds ; lay on it a paper dipped in spirit when it is perfectly cold, tie another fold over it, and store it in a dry place. Bullace cheese is made in the same manner, and almost any kind of plum will make an agreeable pre- serve of the sort. To each pound of fruit, pared, stoned, and mixed with the juice, and boiled quite dry, 6 ozs. of pounded sugar : boiled again to a dry paste. GRAPE JELLY. Strip from their stalks some fine ripe black-cluster grapes, and stir them with a wooden spoon over a gentle fire until all have burst, and the juice flows freely from them ; strain it off without pressure, and pass it through a jelly-bag, or through a twice-doubled muslin; weigh and then boil it rapidly for twenty minutes; draw it from the fire, stir in it till dissolved, fourteen ounces of good sugar roughly powdered, to each pound of juice, and boil the jelly quickly for fifteen minutes longer, keep-

CHAP. XXVI.] SYRUPS, LIQUEURS, ETC. 639 Obs.—Sherry, or very fine raisin or ginger wine, pre- pared as above, and stirred hot to the yolks of four fresh eggs, will be found excellent. A BIRTHDAY SYLLABUB. Put into a large bowl half a pound of sugar broken small, and pour on it the strained juice of a couple of fresh lemons, stir these well together, and add to them a pint of port wine, a pint of sherry, and half a pint of brandy ; grate in a fine nutmeg, place the bowl under the cow, and milk it full. In serving it put a portion of the curd into each glass, fill it up with whey, and pour a little rich cream on the top. The rind of a lemon may be rasped with part of the sugar when the flavour is approved, but it is not usually added. Juice of lemons, 2; sugar, |db. or more; port- wine, 1 pint; sherry, 1 pint; brandy £ pint; nutmeg, 1 ; milk from the cow, 2 quarts. Obs.—We can testify to the excellence of this receipt. CUIRASSEAU, OR CURA^OA. (An excellent and wholesome Liqueur.) Stick into the rind of a very fine China orange of rich flavour from three to four cloves ; put it into a glass jar, and shower over it half a pound of good West Indian sugar, not very brown ; pour in a quart of French brandy ; tie a couple of bladders over the jar, or stop it with a cork fitted to its size, and place it in a sunny window, or any other warm place, for a month ; shake it gently round every day to dissolve the sugar, or stir it, if needful; then strain it off, and bottle it. It is sometimes filtered ; but the long ex- posure to the air which this occasions is better avoided. It is an admirable household stomachic liqueur, of which we obtained the receipt abroad, from a friend who had it made yearly in considerable quantity. 1 very fine richly flavoured China orange, left whole (or two small ones), stuck with 3 or 4 cloves ;

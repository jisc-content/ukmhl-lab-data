CHAP. IV.] SAUCES. 135 half a pint of oil, continuing at each interval to work the sauce as at first until it resumes the smoothness of a custard, and not a particle of the oil is visible; then add a couple of tablespoonsful of plain or of tarragon vinegar, and one of cold water to whiten the sauce. A bit of clear veal-jelly the size of an egg will improve it greatly ; and a morsel of garlic not larger than a pea, bruised as fine as possible, will give it a very agreeable relish, even to persons to whom garlic generally is dis- tasteful. In lieu of this, a few drops of eschalot vinegar may be stirred in; and the flavour may be varied with lemon-juice, and cucumber, or Chili vinegar at choice. The reader who may have a prejudice against the unboiled eggs which enter into the compo- sition of the Mayonnaise, will find that the most fastidious taste would not detect their being raw, if the sauce be well made; and persons who dislike oil may partake of it in this form, without being aware of its presence, provided always that it be perfectly fresh, and pure in flavour, for otherwise it is easily perceptible. Yolks of fresh unboiled eggs, 2; salt, -1 saltspoonful or rather more; cayenne; oil, full third of pint; common, or tarragon-vinegar, 2 tablespoonsful; cold water, I tablespoonful; garlic, morsel size of a pea (or few drops of eschalot vinegar). Meat-jelly (if at hand), size of an egg. Ohs.â€”When a much larger proportion of vinegar is liked, a third yolk of egg should be used, or the sauce will be too thin. It is sometimes coloured green, with the juice of parsley, and other herbs. A spoonful or two of cold bechamel, or of good white sauce, is always an improvement to it. REMOULADE. This differs little from an ordinary salad dressing. Pound very smoothly indeed the yolks of two or three hard boiled eggs with a teaspoonful of mustard, half as much salt, and some cayenne or white pepper. Mix gradually with these, working the whole well together.

CHAP. XXVII.] COFFEE, CHOCOLATE, &C. 649 BURNT COFFEE. {In France vulgarly called Gloria.') Make some coffee as strong and clear as possible, sweeten it in the cup with white sugar almost to syrup, then pour brandy on the top gently over a spoon, set fire to it with a lighted paper, and when the spirit is in part consumed, blow out the flame and drink the gloria quite hot. An ounce of chocolate, if good, will be sufficient for one person. Rasp, and then boil it from five to ten minutes with about four tablespoonsful of water; when quarter-pint or rather more : 5 to 10 minutes. Milk, 1 j pint: ^ minute. Obs.â€”The general reader will understand the use of the chocolate-mill shown in the engraving with the pot; but to the uninitiated it may be as well to ob- serve, that it is worked quickly round between both hands to give a fine froth to the chocolate. It also serves in lieu of a whisk for working creams, or jellies, to a froth or whip. TO MAKE CHOCOLATE. {French Receipt.) it is extremely smooth add nearly a pint of new milk, give it an- other boil, stir it well, or mill it, and serve it directly. For water- chocolate use three quarters of a pint of water instead of the milk, and send rich hot cream to table with it. The taste must decide whether it shall be made thicker or thinner. Chocolate, 2 ozs. ; water.

CHAP. IV.] SAUCES. 113 CHAPTER IY. SAUCES. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. The difference be- tween good and bad cookery can scarcely be more strikingly shown than in the manner in which sauces are Bain Marie, or Water Bath. prepared and served. If well-made, appropriate to the dishes they accompany, and sent to table with them as hot as possible, they not only give a heightened relish to a dinner, but they prove that both skill and taste have been exerted in its arrangements. When coarsely or carelessly prepared, on the contrary, as they too often are, they greatly discredit the cook, and are any thing but acceptable to the eaters. Melted butter, the most common of all, — the “ one sauce” of England, which excites the raillery of foreigners,—is frequently found to be such an intolerable compound, either oiled, or lumpy, or composed principally of flour and water, that it says little for the state of cookery amongst us. We trust that the receipts in the present chapter are so clearly given that if strictly followed, they will materially assist the learner in preparing tolerably palatable sauces at the least. The cut at the commencement of the chapter exhibits the vessel called a bain marie, in which saucepans are placed when it is necessary to keep their contents hot without allowing them to boil; it is extremely useful when dinners are delayed after they are ready to serve. 1

CHAP. XXI.] PRESERVES. 575 flavoured ripe gooseberries, throw them into a large preserving-pan, boil them for ten minutes, and stir them often with a wooden spoon; then pass both the juice and pulp through a fine sieve, and to every three pounds’ weight of these add half a pint of raspberry-juice, and boil the whole briskly for three quarters of an hour; draw the pan aside, stir in for the above proportion of fruit, two pounds of sugar, and when it is dissolved renew the boiling for fifteen minutes longer. Ripe gooseberries, boiled 10 minutes. Pulp and juice of gooseberries, 6 lbs.; raspberry-juice, 1 pint: f hour. Sugar, 4 lbs.: 15 minutes. Obs.—When more convenient, a portion of rasp- berries can be boiled with the gooseberries at first. A FINE PRESERVE OF THE GREEN ORANGE PLUM. (Sometimes called the Stonewood plum.) This fruit, which is very insipid when ripe, makes an excellent preserve if used when at its full growth, but while it is still quite hard and green. Take off the stalks, weigh the plums, then gash them well (with a silver knife, if convenient) as they are thrown into the preserving pan, and keep them stirred without ceasing, over a moderate fire, until they have yielded sufficient juice to prevent their burning; after this, boil them quickly till the stones are entirely detached from the flesh of the fruit. Take them out as they appear on the surface, and when the preserve looks quite smooth and is well reduced, stir in three quarters of a pound of sugar beaten to powder, for each pound of the plums, and boil the whole very quickly for half an hour, or more. Put it, when done, into small moulds or pans, and it will be sufficiently firm when cold to turn out well: it will be also of a fine transparent green colour, and very agreeable to the taste. Orange plums, when green, 6 lbs.; 40 to 60 minutes: sugar, 4-1- lbs. : 30 to 50 minutes. Obs.—The blanched kernels of part of the fruit should be added to this preserve a few minutes before it is

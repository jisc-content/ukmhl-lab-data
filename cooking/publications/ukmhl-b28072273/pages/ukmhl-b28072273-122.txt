ICES. 110 Any very finely sieved frnit pulp can be used in this way. Maraschino Spongada.—Dissolve lOoz. of sugar in a quart of whipped cream, and when quite melted stir to it the whites of enough eggs to fill a giU, and half a pint of maraschino; strain into the freezer and proceed as before, adding a little more maraschino at the last. Any liqueur can be used in this way; €ura9oa, for instance, is very good thus, but the cream should be faintly tinted with saffron or apricot yellow. Strawberry Spongada.—Stallc a quart of straw- berries, and sprinkle them well with 3oz. or 4oz. of •caster sugar, then crush them through a fine sieve. Have ready a syrup made by boiling together 4oz. of loaf sugar and half a pint of water for twenty minutes, and beat this into the strawberry j)ulp for five minutes, working it over ice; then stir in quickly and lightly the frothed whites of four eggs und a pint of stiffly whipped cream, and freeze in the usual way. This is not, strictly speaking,, a spongada, though it goes by that name. As a matter of fact, a clever cook can prepare these frothy ices with any flavourings or purees to taste, but they are not altogether easy to make successfully, and take too much time and trouble for the average cook; so it is unnecessary to multiply recipes for spongadas in this book, which is primarily intended for the average household, and not for one which can afford to keep a first-rate chef with many assistants ; while, if the cook likes, and can succeed in these ic6s, the above hints will be sufficient to enable ber to vary their nature indefinitely.

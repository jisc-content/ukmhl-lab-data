ICES. 36 Black Currant Water Ice—Pound together two pounds of ripe black currants and a pound of black heart cherries, with the blanched kernels of the latter ; mix them with 6oz. of caster sugar, one and. a half pints of cold water, and a few drops of carmine to imjDrove the colour, rub it all through a sieve, and freeze. Cherrij Water Ice.—Stalk and stone two pounds of ripe red cherries, bruise them, and set them over the fire in the preserving pan with half a pound of loaf sugar and a little water; let them boil up till soft enough to pulp through a hair sieve ; blanch and pound a good handful of the cherry kernels, and infuse them for a little in the juice of two lemons. Now add to the cherries a pound of sugar, boiled till on dipping the fingers into cold water and then into the sugar it will form a tiny thread, breaking off into tiny drops at each end; mix the fruit and sugar well together, and pour it on to the lemon juice and kernels, mix it altogether thoroughly, and freeze. Of course, this ice can be simply made with either jam or cherry syrup, but the little trouble involved by the above is well worth taking. (Mrs. A. B. Marshall’s recipe).—Mix the finely sieved pulp of two pounds of ripe white heart cherries with a pint of lemon water ice, six or eight drops of essence of almonds, the blanched and cdiopped kernels of the fruit, and a c-aret-glassful of Kirsch syrup; freeze in the usual way. Chocolate Water Ice.-Melt 3oz. of vanilla choco- late and mix it with half a pint of water and a gill of sugar syrup, and freeze.

M. d la Busse.—To one and a haK pints stiffly whipped cream add 12oz. caster sugar, a wineglassful of maraschino (or other liqueur or spirit to taste), a good liqueur-glassful of Kiimmel, sixteen drops strong essence of vanilla, and l^oz. of isinglass (or best leaf gelatine) dissolved in a gill of boiling rose water. Beat this mixture well till thoroughly amalgamated, mixing in shred pistachios and almonds, and sufficient green colouring to bring it to a faint green. Mould and freeze. Serve with iced cham- pagne sauce, and pink vanilla wafers. For the sauce ; Break a fresh egg into a basin with a tablespoonful of cream, sugar to taste, and a full tumbler of cham- pagne, Whip it over a strong ice and salt mixture, and it will freeze as you whip.

Another way is to mince two tablespoonfuls of the j)reserved ginger, and add them with two tablespoonfuls of the syrup to a pint of whipped cream, and freeze. Greengage Cream Ice.—Choose two dozen fine ripe greengages, stone them, and blanch the kernels; cook the fruit and the kernels with 4oz. of cane loaf sugar till reduced to a rather thin marmalade, tammy, and when cool mix them with a quart of either rich custard or whipped cream, and freeze in the usual way. Lemon Cream Ice. — Peel off the rind of four lemons very thinly, and boil this with a jjint of new milk or single cream, and 4oz. of sugar, for eight or ten minntes; then strain it on to the yolks of five or six eggs, and cook in the usual way till it thickens ;

13 ORIGIN AND KIND. Itwo are perfectly blended, tlie whole being then well : shaken together to pack it closely. In large house- : holds where ices are in constant use, ice crushers, • which crush the ice blocks into equal knobs are in 'request, but in smaller establishments the following 'will be found the most convenient method. Lay •the ice on a piece of clean sacking or house-flannel, and chip off the pieces with an ice pricker or a ] mallet; or else throw a flap of the flannel over the ace, and crush it up with a hammer. In Marshall’s , ice cave there is a screw J3lug fixed to both the body and the door of the machine, by which the melted iice, brine, &c., can be removed, while the machine can be re-charged without opening the inner cave in wliich the ice or material to be frozen is placed. By ’this means all chance of tainting the ice by the salt ' of the freezing mixture is utterly avoided, and there ;is no need to go to the expense of tightly closed 1 pewter moulds, such as were required by the old method of burying the ice pudding, &c., in the 1 freezing mixture. Moreover, thanks to the ice cave, souffles glaces are as easy to make as any other form of ice pudding. When the freezing mixture has been duly con- sidered, attention must next be bestowed on the •materials to be frozen. For cream or custard ices it may be reckoned that 4oz. of sugar to the pint ■ of custard is the fair average ; but this must to some ► extent depend on the fruit of which the ice is to be ' composed, therefore it is better to trust somewhat to • one’s palate, bearing in mind that freezing reduces •the sweetness. Another thing to remember is that

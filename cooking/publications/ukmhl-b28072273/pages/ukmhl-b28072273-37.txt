PLAIN ICES, CREAM AND WATER. 25 little brandy or liqueur. This is quite white and very delicately flavoured. Currant Cream Ice.—Draw down the fruit exactly as for jelly-making-, and when cool add it in the pro- poi-tion of half a pint of this juice to one and a half pints of custard or whipped cream, sweetening it to taste. Blackberry or black currant juice is particularly good with whipped cream, but requires a little additional juice, as they are both rather dry ; say a gill of red currant juice to each pint of black cm-rant juice, or a few apples cooked with the blackberries. Another very dehcate currant cream ice is made with raw red currant juice stirred into an equal quantity of sugar syrup, then added when cool to the whipped cream and frozen. Fruit Cream Ice.—These ices are very easily made by peeling, seeding, and stalking any kind of fruit desired, marinading them in lemon juice or liqueur syrup, and sugar, for a little time, then stirriag them into haK frozen custard or whipped cream, re-freezing the mixture. Or the fruit can be crushed to a pulp, sweetened to taste with rather thick syrup, stirred into whipped cream, or more or less rich custard, and frozen. The proportion for making ices from jams are a teacupful (say a hberal 4oz.) of jam with three- quarters to a pint of custard, and when half frozen, add a gill of whipped cream; if made of cream only, use a pint of cream to the 4oz. of jam. If made American fashion with scalded cream, make like custard in using a little raw whipped cream at the last, when half frozen.

ICES. 6G fruit, &c., -witli wliicli it is mixed; here, however, is Francatelli’s recipe, which is the true and original one. Blanch and peel three dozen chestnuts, then stew them in water or syrup till tender enough to crush and pulp tlu’ough the sieve; put this pulj) into a pan with the yolks of eight eggs, a pint of cream, two sticks of vanilla (previously pounded), half a pint of pineapple syrup, and a very little salt; stir this all over a slow fire till the custard is sufficiently thickened, when you strain it through a tammy into a basin. Now shred 4oz. of green citron, 6oz. of pineapple (previously simmered in some of the syrup), cut into dice, and put these into a basin witli 6oz. of dried cherries and 4oz. of stoned raisins ; pour over this fruit two wineglassfuls '' of maraschino, cover over the basin, and let it all soak for several hours. When these are ready j)ui the chestnut cream into the freezer and freeze in the usual way. When about three parts frozen mix in lightly and quickly the marinaded fniit, and half a pint of stiffly whipped cream, freeze it for a little longer till like a very stiff batter, when you pour it all into the mould and set it in the ice cave for two to two and a half hours. Then dip the mould in "■ cold water, wipe off any moisture there may be, and turn it out, and serve at once. This certainly is a delicious pudding; but the first recipe is very little, if at all, less dehcate, and certainly less trouble. Of n course the success of this pudding depends on the richness of the custard (for which, see recipe). Angel Pudding (American).—Lightly beat together the whites of six eggs, but without frothing them.

5 ORIGIN AND KIND. iiacross so a.s to show the stripes. The iced pudding iis a more or less rich custard mixed with preserved ffruits, &c., packed in a mould and frozen; this of course may be of ahnost any shape. The iced xharlotte is, as its name implies, made in the ordinary plain charlotte mould, lined with biscuits, pwafers, slices of Genoa or other rich cake, &c., and EfiUed up with any ice to taste. A very modern ver- ^sion of this is the gateau glace, when a rich cake of jsome kind is hollowed out and served with a fruit jgamish and a filling of any sort of ice. The iced 'souffle is a very rich form of very light whipped ;mstard, placed in a papered souffle mould, allowed to Â«set in the ice cave, and finally served with the outside paper removed to give it the appearance of having risen (see Fig. 3, for the papering of the mould). IThe mousse is made of the same preparation as is used for the iced souffle, only it is moulded instead of X)eing put into the souffle case. The difference be- , :ween this and the ordinary ice pudding is that in the tatter case the ice to be used is first frozen in the 'freezer till of the consistency of very thick batter.

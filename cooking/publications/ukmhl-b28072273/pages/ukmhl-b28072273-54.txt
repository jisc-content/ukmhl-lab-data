ICES. 42 shows, the water-steeped fruit jjulp was replaced by a water ice of some kind, usually, if not invariably, at first, a lemon water ice, to which the alcohol and spice in the shape of liquid essences were added during the course of its freezing. These sorbets were as they still are, usually seiwed in portions, a glass or cup for each guest, and soon some of the more skilful glaciers evolved little cups of real ice in which to serve them; these were at first imitations of the primitive method of serving these ices, when a water ice was piled up in one of the flat tazza-like champagne glasses, the pyramidal top being flattened down anid hollowed, so as to contain a tablespoonful of spirit or liqueur to taste. Then came the actual ice cup; for this a large shallow tub was chosen and filled with a mixture of ice, salt, and saltpetre, as many wineglasses as were required being packed in this mixture, and filled up with any fruit syrup to taste; a cover was then placed over the top of the glasses to keep dust, &c., off, and the whole was left till a thick skin of fruit ice had formed round the glasses, the still liquid syrup in the centre was poured off, and the glasses returned to the ice tub to harden; and then when wanted they were turned out from their moulds, and served, filled up with any sorbet, or, for that matter, any ice, to taste. This process, however, was not altogether an easy one, and only the masters of thc^r art attemj)tcd such things. Now, however, these ice cups are within the reach of any one possessing an ice cave who cares to go to the expense of the proper ice-cup moulds, of which we give an illustration

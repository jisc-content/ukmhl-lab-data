Creme au foie gras glacee.—Season a pint of thick cream with a pinch of coralline pepper and a little salt; add half a pint of just liquid aspic, and freeze in the freezer till just setting. Line a plain mould about l^in. thick with this ice, lay into it the contents of a jar of pate de foie gras truffe, carefully freed from any grease, fill up with more of the frozen cream, and leave it in the cave for an hour or so. Souffle glace au foie gras.—Season a pint of very stifhy whipped cream with coralline pepper and salt, and mix into it lightly with a silver fork the contents of a jar of foie gras truffe broken up small; freeze, and when about three parts frozen stir in a gill of freshly whipped cream, pack in a papered souffle mould, and freeze in the cawe for an hour or more. Remove the outer paper carefully and serve, sprinkled with coralhne pepper and minced truffle and parsley. This is fearfully rich, but very delicious. Crab, lobster, salmon, &c. can all be served in this way, but it is better then to mix the fish with a gill of rich mayonnaise (either plain or tomato) to three- quarters of a pint of whipped cream in the first instance. Souffle de perdrix glacee.—Dissolve joz. best leaf gelatine and a teaspoonful of glaze in half a pint of good strong game stock, strain it, add one and a half gills of aspic jelly, and v/hip it all tiU cold and sj)ongy;

CHAPTEE XI. ICED DRINKS. With the season for ices comes also the season for iced drinks, and though these are too numerous to be exhaustively treated in so small a book as this, a few may be given, if only as samples. Iced Coffee.—Have ready a well-heated cafetiere standing in a pan of boiling water, or in the bain- marie, put into the percolator four large tablespoon- fuls of freshly ground and roasted Mocha coffee, and to this pour gradually a pint of freshly and abso- lutely boiling water, let it stand after this for ten minutes in the bain-marie at the side of the stove, then to each pint of coffee allow 2oz. or 3oz. of caster sugar (this must to some extent depend on taste), and half a pint of cream, or haK cream and half new milk, slightly warmed, and let it stand till cold, then freeze it in the freezer till only just liquid enough to poirr from the jug. Stand it on the ice till wanted. • Sweeten a quart of strong, freshly made coffee to taste, add io it a pint of single cream or new milk, and freeze till fairly thick, then stir into it half a pint of cream, whipped till stiff, and keep it in a cold place on ice.

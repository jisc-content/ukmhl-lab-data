ICED DRINKS. 133 Iced Cocoa.—Stir four good tablespoonfuls of really first-rate cocoa (such as Cadbury’s, Van Houten’s, Rowntree’s, &c.) till smooth, -with a gill of cold milk, then pour to it a quart of boiling milk, let it just boil up again, then allow it to cool, and freeze. A full teaspoonful of sweetened, whipped, or thick and frozen cream, flavoured with a drop or two of vanilla should be handed with this. For cups it will be found a great improvement if the mixing jug or bowl be first imbedded in a large basin filled fpith ice and salt in the usual way, and then, if it has to stand, a double newspaper can be firmly twisted over it, in which way it will keep very fairly well, though many cups, especially those made with claret, are better if only made as they are wanted. Lemon Squash.—Halve eight good lemons, or ten nice fresh hmes, and strain off their juice, sweetening this with a tablespoonful of caster sugar to each lemon or hme (a little of this sugar may be used as loaf sugar, on which the yellow part of the rind of two or three of the lemons should be rubbed off) ; put this into a delicately clean pan, let it aU simmer gently in a pint of water till the sugar is perfectly dissolved, then let it cool a little; now beat up the white and shell of an dgg, stir it into the mixture, and continue stirring till it boils up ; allow it to boil for a minute or two, then strain it very gently through a jelly bag. When cold add \oz. of citric acid, bottle, and cork down closely. When required for use, put a wune- glassful of this mixture into a soda water tumbler, and pour on to it a bottle of well-iced soda water,

ICES. 54 prepare some almond milk by pounding together some sweet Jordan almonds with a very few bitter ones, say 4oz. of sweet to one {not loz.) bitter one, and pour on to this half a pint of boiling milk, cover the basin, and allow it to infuse for half an hour, then wring or tammy it through a cloth; this is pure almond milk; mix this with an equal quantity of the light syrup, and freeze as before. A very few drops of vanilla, lemon, or other essence may be added to this ice to flavour it to taste. In Italy, half almonds and half melon seeds are used in the making of it, which gives it a peculiar and delicate flavour. These are the original graniti; but nowa- days, as said above, almost any water ice is prepared in this way and served as a granito, if liked ; though in Italy, at all events, spirit seldom, if ever, enters into their composition. The one exception is Granito an Champagne (and this really is a French version).—For this mix a pint of the light syrup with a bottle of champagne, and freeze as before; re- membering always that it is the reduced quantity of salt in the freezing mixture, and the irregular freezing that gives it its character. Granito an Cafe (a very favourite one) is made by adding half a pint of syrup to a pint of strong black coffee, flavouring it to taste with a very little maras- chino or cognac, and freezing. Lemon Granito.—Make this by the recipe for lemon water ice, only using a sugar syrup (28 degrees) instead of plain sugar, and prepare it bji, the directions given above.

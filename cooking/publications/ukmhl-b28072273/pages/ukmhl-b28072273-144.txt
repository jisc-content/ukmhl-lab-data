ICES. 132 Iced, Coffee —Into a quart of strong, clear coffee put 4oz. sifted sugar and a wineglassful of brandy (or maraschino). Leave this well banked up in ice and salt till wanted, and when about to serve, put in a lump of ice, and serve as it is or with an accompani- ment of whipped and iced cream. It must be borne in mind that the coffee must be first-rate in quality, freshly roasted and ground, be made with freshly boiled water, and be very clear. Coffee for icing purposes should always be very strong, as the icing reduces the flavour. Iced Tea.—Make a quart of tea in the usual way, being careful to have the water with which it is made absolutely boiling, and sweeten to taste. Let it stand till cold, then stir into it half a pint of single cream and ice. {Russian) — Procure some first-rate Russian tea (the Caravan tea is best for this), and make a quart of it, fairly strong, in the usual way, allow it to stand only for five minutes at the outside (three minutes are ofteu considered sufficient), then pour it off into a bowl and sweeten to taste; ice this well, then stir into it two lemons very thinly sliced, and leave it on ice or in the cave till wanted; when serving give a slice of lemon and a tiny lump of ice in each cup. {d la Sir A. Clark).—Make a quart of tea in the usual way, only use boiling milk instead of water, sweeten lightly, and let it stand till cold, then pour it off and freeze. Serve icy cold, with, or with- out, a teaspoonful of whipped and frozen cream in each cup.

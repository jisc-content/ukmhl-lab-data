ICES. 116 Gateau a la Rose, au cafe,—Slice a round rose cake horizontally into four slices, and divide each of these into four; s[u-ead each thickly with either clotted or very thi. kly whipped cream strongly flavoured with maraschino and rose water, and, after cutting ofE the point of each of them, huild up the cake again, alternating the pieces so that the centre of the hio-her layer comes over the join of the lower one, and so'^on till the cake is hack into shape; arrange a wreath of crystallized rose leaves round the top, and fill up with white coffee ice flavoured with mara- schino. A very pretty variante of this is to use two cakes, say a rose cake and a white sponge, building up these differently coloured layers as before, and fill up with an angel cream ice, into which you have mixed all kinds of crystalhzed flowers. This is called Gateau Mille-Jieurs. Another pretty cake is Mrs. A. B. Marshall’s Gateau Trouville. For this, choose a melon-shaped sponge cake, shce off the bottom about half an inch thick, and scoop out aU the inside, leaving a sheU about three quarters to an inch thick, then fill this up with any rich fruit compote, fruit fool, &c., you choose; after this has been iced as cold as it can l)e Avithout being actually frozen, press the bottom back into place, and ice the whole cake oyer with maras- chino glace, garnishing this as it sets, as you please, to suit the filling ; haye ready a border mould of me to fit the cake, of any water (or cream, if liked) ice to suit, dish this, slip the cake on to it, and serve at once. Evidently the filhngs and the stand of this cake can be varied to any extent.

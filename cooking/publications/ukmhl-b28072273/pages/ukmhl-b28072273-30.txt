ICES IS I paid to a few points. First, never put tlie custard or cream into tlie freezer whilst wann, for if you do it will most probably curdle or granulate^ a fatal mistake, as properly made ice should always be perfectly smooth and even in texture. Moreover, cold custard involves less time, work, and ice. Be careful as to the proportion of sugar used, bearing in mind that freezing reduces the sweetening power of sugar; if too much sugar be used the ice will not freeze properly; if too little is used, it will freeze; quite hard and rocky. Again, in freezing, the ice, if to be moulded, needs to reach the consistency of batter, but if to be used plain it must be frozen till quite dry and hard; the longer it will have to stand the stiffer it shotdd be frozen. It is easy to tell how the freezing is progressing as the crank gets gradually harder to turn, as the ice stiffens. Ices should not be frozen too quickly, as they then freeze unevenly and will be coarse-grained ; to get the best effect the- machine should be worked steadily and evenly. One- more point to be noticed, and one that apphes to every kind of ice, and that is the need for strict attention to cleanliness in everything that concerns! ices and ice-making. It is almost in every casej better to add the sugar requii'ed in the form of syrup (for a recipe for this see chapter on “ Odds and Ends ”) rather than of plain sugar, water ices being specially improved by syrup. All kinds of ices can be made with either jam, or liqueur or fruit syrups, according to what you have; and of course, though generally lacking in the dehcacy of flavour given by fresh fruit, they are verj| t h

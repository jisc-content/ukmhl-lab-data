SOEBETS AND GRANITI. 55 crush one and a half pounds of strawberries, put them in a basin with the juice of a lemon, and a tea- spoonful of orange flower water, and pour on to them one and a half pints of cold water. Let it all stand for three hours, then wring it through a muslin to extract every drop of juice, add to it a sugar syrup made by boiling a pound of loaf sugar to half a pint of water, strain into the freezer and freeze, adding before finishing some whole fresh straw- berries, marinaded in sugar and lemon juice. The above directions show sufficiently how this particular ice is made; so it is easy to vary the kinds to taste, using any water ice recipe, in accordance with the foregoing directions. They make excellent refreshments for tennis parties, &c., as the fact of their being irregularly iced renders them easy to make in any home-made icing machine or freezing pot.

tLAIN ICES, CREAM AND WATER. l7 Iblespoonful of Swiss milk dissolved iu tlie milk Ltm-allj adds considevablj to the richness. IFor the American ice creams no custard at all is I ed, good thick cream being substituted. This form ice is made in two ways ; the cream is whipj^ed till ri3^ stiff, sweetened to taste, and frozen for a little, ?e flavouring essence, frait pulp, or liqueur, is then ded, and the whole frozen till dry. (This cream creases greatly in bulk in the freezing, becoming ' >m one-fourth to one-third more; but it must be inembered that this kind deteriorates very quickly, d therefore is not so good if it has to stand any lie.) The second method is to scald the cream, by •icing the vessel containing it in another, three Tts full of cold water, and when this outer water ils up the cream is ready. If the cream itself is )iwed to boil it loses its power of expansion; but ! scalding in the bain-marie does not interfere ih this, whilst giving a smoother, less raw flavoui*, m ordinary cream would produce, ijastly, there is the modern process by which both >se methods are combined; the custard is cooked, • led, flavoured, and then half frozen, and lastly, a ••tion of whipped cream, varying from one-quarter one-half the bulk of custard used is stirred in with flavouring mixture, and the freezing is finished, thus made, though not as light and fresh-tasted tthe ice made with whipped cream only, is yet ch richer and lighter than the ordinary custard- um ice. Ice making is an easy process nowadays, iipared with what it used to be; still, like every- iig else, it requires care, and attention must be c

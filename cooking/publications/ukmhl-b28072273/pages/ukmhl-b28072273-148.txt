Claret Cup {Soyer’s).—Peel two lemons very thinly, and lay the peel in a basin; add four table- spoonfuls of caster sugar, the juice of four lemons, a few slices of cucumber (leave the peel on), pour on to this two bottles each of soda water and claret, well iced, one bottle of iced chamj)agne, and stir up well. (With all due deference to so great an authority, this is even nicer if the yellow part of the lemons be rubbed off on to the sugar; moreover, the dii-ections as to making this in a bowl half buried in ice must be strictly observed.) Put into a basin two bottles of good claret, half a teaspoonful of violet syrup, and a gill of pale brandy; when this is all icy cold, stir in two bottles of well-iced soda or potash water and a full gill of raspberry water ice, and serve. {Simple).—Put into a jug a bottle of claret with sufficient sugar to sweeten it, a strip or two of lemon peel, and a slice or so of cucumber, and, when icy cold, pour on to it two bottles of iced soda water, and use. Chablis Cup.—Pub the yellow part of a quarter of a lemon off on four or five lumps of sugar and put these in a basin with a very thin shoe of lemon peel and a gill of boiling water; let it all stand for half an hour, then add to it a bottle of chablis, a wine- glassful of sherry, half a pint of water, and a small spray of lemon verbena ; mix this all well and let it cit embedded in ice for fully half an hour, then strain it, add a bottle of iced soda water, and use.

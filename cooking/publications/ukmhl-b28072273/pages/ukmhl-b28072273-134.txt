Then mould and put aside to set. Of course, these creams can be served in a variety of ways, and garnished to taste. One of the most usual is to prepare two or three purees of con- trasting colours, and place these in layers in a Neapolitan ice mould, which is then put into the ice cave for one and a half to two hours (or bury the mould in ice and salt for about the same time) ; then remove the lid from the mould, and run a little, just liquid, aspic jelly, meat jelly, or tomato aspic (if the dish is to be uncompromisingly vegetarian) over the whole, and replace the covered mould in the cave till the jelly is firmly set. Then dip the underside in cold water, and slip the cream out, leaving the jelly uppermost. The iced vegetables can then be served as a whole, or sliced down to show the different colours, like Neapolitan ices. Otherwise they can be served in little shapes, as, for instance, in fonds d^artichauts d la creme de tomates, glaces. For this, turn out some nicely shaped, rather small artichoke bottoms (either fresh-cooked or canned), and set them on ice or in the ice cave; prepare a tomato cream; nib sufficient ripe red tomatoes through a sieve to produce one a id a half gills of puree,

107 PARFAITS AND SPONGADAS. serving witli any kind of iced fruit is made by sweetening a pint of stiffly whipped cream (whipped very dry), and flavouring it with vanilla, essence of lemon, &c., moulding and freezing it. The spongada is another form of ice, somewhat of the natiue of a parfait, but not frozen so hard, and seldom, if ever, moulded nowadays. Indeed, it is too light to mould properly, and, when not served separately in cups or glasses, is generally used as a, centre for some other mould. In some rare cases it is frozen sufficiently stiff to mould, but in that case it is more like an ordinary moulded ice or parfait. The old-fashioned freezing pot is generally used in the preparation of this form of ice. The method of its making is as follows : Having prepared the mixture, it is strained into the charged freezer, which is then covered down and turned sharply and steadily for a few minutes till it begins to thicken; now take off the cover, and give it another turn or two un- covered, easing the ice as it forms, with a spatula,, from the bottom and sides of the pot; as soon as it thickens stop turning, and with the spatula work it well up from the bottom, till the cream is (^uite soft and light and fully double its original bulk, when you add a little flavouiâ€™ing and sweetening syrup, if necessary, and serve at once, either in glasses, or with a moulded ice, as preferred.

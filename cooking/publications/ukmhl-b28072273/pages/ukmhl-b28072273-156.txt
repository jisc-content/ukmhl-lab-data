ICES. 144 glass; or if flung into cold water it will fall with a distinct tinkle into the basin. Lastly, it will be caramel when it begins to turn colour; first a faint yellow, when it should be lifted from the fire and a little lemon juice be added, or a little water. On re-boiling this will darken, first to a rich golden brown, and then to the black, or burnt stage. If much sugar is boiled it is well to have a sac- charometer, or syrup gauge, to test the sugar, as this gives the precise stage without any other test, but for ordinary purposes the above directions suffice. Sugar Syrup.â€”It is well worth the trouble to keep store syrup at hand, as it is a great addition to almost every kind of ice, and water ices especially are never so nice as when made with sugar syrup instead of plain sugar and water. If you use the syrup gauge alluded to above, you will find a syrup that registers 34 deg. the best for making fondant for icing cakes, &c.; 32 deg. should be used for fruits frappes, and such things; whilst a syrup that only registers from 18 deg. to 20 deg. is the best for water ices. If, however, you have no spirit gauge you will find the following rough calculation very effective: Put into a pan two pounds of best loaf sugar, with a pint of cold water, and stir it over the fire till the sugar has dissolved. Watch it from the moment this happens, and the sugar begins to boil, and, as soon as it bubbles all over, and becomes the consistency of cream, it is about 18 deg. to 20 deg.; when it has boiled five minutes exactly from the start it has reached 26 deg.; at the end of ten minutes, 28 deg.; at the end of fifteen minutes.

CHAPTER IX. CHAELOTTES AND aATEAUX GLACES, &c. A VERY pretty way of serving ices mucli adopted nowadays is the charlotte glacesâ€”i.e., an outer casing is made of various kinds of cake, and is then filled with any ice to taste, either piled in rockily or moulded to fit. The simplest plan is to line a plain charlotte mould with a strip of oiled paper, then press all round it sponge fingers trimmed to fit, making these adhere by the use of white of egg, royal icing, or boiled sugar; then let them stand till quite drv, turn out, and fill with any ice to taste, standing them for a little in the ice cave if necessary.

Serve with a rich macedoine of any kind of mixed fniit, frozen in liqueur flavoured syrujD, or with a good compote of fruit to taste, or whipped cream mixed with mashed strawberries, and set in the cave until perfectly cold. Any rich rice, semolina, rice flour, or other cereal pudding is nice if frozen in the cave and served with an iced compote, and makes a great and wholesome treat for the children. Pruit fools, thickened with a little custard or whipped cream, can be first frozen and then moulded with excellent effect, especially if served with a compote of any kind of fruit.

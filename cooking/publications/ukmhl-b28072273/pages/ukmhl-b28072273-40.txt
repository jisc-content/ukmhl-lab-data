ICES. 28 to a stiff batter ; then stir into it from 2oz. to foz. of shelled, blanched, and chopped nuts of any kind, almonds, walnuts, filberts, cocoanuts, or pistachio, as you please. If yon brown the almonds after shredding them, they are a delicious addition to caramel ice, which should, however, be flavoured with a little almond essence. A very good imitation of pistachio nut ice can be made with almonds, if stirred into a rich custard, coloured a faint green with vegetable greening, and flavoured with orange flower water, and a very little almond essence. Orange Cream Ice.—The simplest way to make this is like the lemon cream previously given, only allow- ing one lemon (peel and juice) to every six oranges. Orange (Tangerine) Cream Ice.—Eub off the rinds of some six or eight nice fresh Tangerine (or Mandarine) oranges on to 6oz. of loaf sugar, and stir it into a pint of single cream just brought to the boil; then when this is cool add the juice of the oranges and a little extra sugar if needed, and freeze in the usual Avay, adding about three-quarters of a pint of stiffly whipped cream and a liqueur-glassful of cura9oa liqueur or syrup (or better still Mandarine liqueur), and finish freezing. Ordinary oranges can be treated in the same way, but are, of course, not as delicate as the Tangerines. Orange (Flower-water) Cream Ice.—To a pint of single cream add 3oz. caster sugar, a gill of orange- flower water, a teasjjoonful of vanilla essence and a spoonful or two of maraschino, partly freeze this, then stir into it crystallized rose and orange-flowers, about loz. of each, and serve.

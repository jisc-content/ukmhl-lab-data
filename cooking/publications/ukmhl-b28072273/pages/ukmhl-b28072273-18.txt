Lastly, there are the moscovite, and the spongada. The former is a simpler form of iced puding stiffened with a small j)roportion of isinglass or best leaf gelatine, which is, however, never actually frozen, though it is iced till as cold as it is possible to get it.

The spongada is a very light form of whipped cream ice, common in Italy, but seldom, if ever, seen in this country, save when it is occasionally used to fill up a mould lined with ordinary cream or water ice. Besides these there is the parfait, which is very much the same as the spongada, only frozen a little more stiffly, the latter being more hke frozen froth, whence its other name of spumante or foaming.

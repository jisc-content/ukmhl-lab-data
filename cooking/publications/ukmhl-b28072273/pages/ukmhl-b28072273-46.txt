ICES. 34 accurately gauged; for rough and ready use, how- ever, the following syrap will be found excellent: Boil together three pounds of cane loaf sugar with three quarts of cold water, keeping it well skimmed, allow it to reduce by rapid boiling to half this quantity, then strain through a clean fine cloth and bottle for use. In the chapter on Odds and Ends more definite particulars will be given as to the making of this syrup, and also with regard to boiling sugar. If making water ices with fruit pulp (obtained by cooking the fruit till soft enough to sieve, if sub- stantial, like apples, &c., or by simply pulping the fruit through a sieve, as in the case of strawberries, &c.), allow either a pint of water and 6oz. to 8oz. of sugar to the pint of pulp (taking the sweetness of the fruit into account); or else allow six full table- spoonfuls of the sugar syrup to the half pint of pulp. For instance, for lemon water, allow a pint of boiling water and 8oz. of loaf sugar to six lemons; or, if using syrup, allow the juice of four to six lemons to the pint of boiling syrup. Lemon water ice is the foundation of so many other things that it may be as well to give the recipe for it first of all. Lemon Water Ice.—Peel six to eight lemons very thinly, and pour on to their peel a full pint of boiling sugar and water syrup (or put half a pound of sugar with the peel, and pour a pint of boiling water over it all), let it stand till cold, then strain it, add the strained juice of six lemons, and freeze. Apple Water Ice.—Peel, core, and slice a pound of good apples into a pint of water acidulated with the juice of one lemon, add a strip or two of the peel,

PLAIN ICES, CREAM AND WATER. 39 of 'water, and one and a quarter pounds of cane loaf su£?ar for ten minutes. Freeze as usual. Tutti-Frutti Water Ice.—This can be made in two ways. (1) Crush any fruit such as strawberries, raspberries, currants, cherries, gooseberries, &c., to a pulp, and to each quart of this pulp add a full pint of sugar syrup flavoured with lemon juice and maras- chino, or other liqueur or liqueur syrup, and let it stand till cold ; then freeze as usual. This makes a delicious ice. The syrup should be 32° on the saccharometer. (2) The other way of preparing this is to cut up any fruit, fresh, candied, preserved, or canned, just as they come, into dice, sprinkle these 'with a little sugar and liqueur syrup, and then stir them into half-frozen lemon water ice in the proportion of half a pound of fruit to each quart of ice. This is a capital way of using up any fruit left over from dessert. Make the lemon water ice according to the second recipe for orange water ice.

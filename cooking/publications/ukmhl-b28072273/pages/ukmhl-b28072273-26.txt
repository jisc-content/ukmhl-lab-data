ICES. 14 in freezing, the material to be frozen expands in the process, therefore allowance for this should be made. In fact to obtain a quart of ice a vessel of a gallon capacity is the safest. Lastly, when the ices have been made and tvu’ned out, special attention must be bestowed on the utensils used, which should be carefully washed and rinsed out, to remove any trace of tbe brine, which will otherwise inevitably rust the machine hopelessly. Especially is this the case with Messrs. E. Roberts’ pretty little machine, which in gratitude for the modesty of its price, and the simplicity and success of its action, well deserves tbe attention which vdll preserve its usefulness. From experience, I know that, fairly treated, it compares favourably with many higher priced machines; and, if lacking (natur- ally), the infinite variety obtainable with my favourite Marshall’s freezer, and ice cave, will yet enable modest housewives to produce extremely good plain ices and sorbets, not to mention the form of ice- puddings known as Moscovites.

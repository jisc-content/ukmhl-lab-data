ORIGIN AND KIND. 7 Formerly, the process of freezing was a very troublesome and difficult one, requiring more practice and skill than could be easily attained by any one who could not give up all their time to it, and it is to this we owe the <lifficulty and expense formerly connected with ices, and icing generally. Formerly ice was made in ice-pots or sorbetieres, made of pewter, which were stood in pails containing a mixture of ice and salt, the ice-pot being so fitted in that it could be made to revolve by hand ; the ice as it congealed at the sides of the pot being scraped into ■ the centre with a spoon or spatula. This naturally was a work of time, and tiring at that, as the pot was open to allow of this ice scraping; then, when the mixture had at last frozen to the consistency of batter, it was packed into a mould with a tight- fitting hd, the edges of which were then “ luted or pasted down with butter or fat of some kind to prevent any possible contamination from the salt with which the ice was mixed. How frequently this : precaution failed many people can doubtless ■ remember, as they recall the curious salty taste •so frequently and unaccountably present in ices. This mould thus luted was then buried for a time in the ice and salt mixture until it should have solidified properly, and be fit to turn out. Necessarily much <experienc3 was required, and the process did not . come within the limits of even the professed cook, who had so much besides to attend to. However, •the difficulty has been overcome by various inven- •tions, both British and foreign, notably American, ,and in consequence the popularity of ices and iced

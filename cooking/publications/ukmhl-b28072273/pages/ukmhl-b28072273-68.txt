CHAPTEE IV. MOULDED AND FANCY ICES. Ices of all kinds can be moulded (especially if one possesses an ice cave), and in this way fonn very pretty entremets. The ice to be used must be first frozen in the freezing tub till of the consistency of stiff batter, then placed in the mould, which should have been first washed in warm water, next well rinsed in cold, and finally placed in the charged ice cave to ensure its being thoroughly cold before the ice is put into it. Do not fill the mould too quickly, but put it in by spoonfuls, pressing it well home so that it may take the impression of the mould correctly, and have the edges sharp when turned out. (To turn out, dip the mould in cold water, wipe well, and turn out.) Especially must this care be taken when the mould to be used is a very ornate one, with flowers and fniit on the top; these latter being frequently arranged in differently coloured and flavoured ices, to correspond with the objects they represent. It may, however, be observed, that the plainer the mould, in reason, the better will the effect be. Few things look better in this way than the tall tapering hombe mould, standing alone on its jiaplrin or bed of soft wadding, or, if preferred,

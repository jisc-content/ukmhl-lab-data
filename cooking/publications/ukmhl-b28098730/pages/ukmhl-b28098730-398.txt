Put a pint and a half of stock into a stewpan ; beat up the white of an egg together with the shell crushed until it is a froth; add it to the cold stock, and beat all for a few minutes; then set it on a quick fire; stir it till the egg rises in scum; let it boil gently for five minutes, and then set it for a short time on the top of the oven; pass it through a cloth; add cayenne pepper and salt as required, and a teaspoonful of white sugar.

This soup may be varied by macaroni, vermicelli, or home-made Italian paste, or tapioca.

Then beat up four eggs, the whites and yelks together, dip in the cutlets, have some dried bread-crumbs ready mixed with an equal quantity of grated Parmesan cheese, cover the cutlets with the crumbs and press them well on the egg to make as close and thick a covering as the egg will hold together. Pry the cutlets again in butter a delicate light brown; serve by placing the cutlets in the middle of the dishes in a small circle resting against each other with the ends uppermost; there may be a small bed of rice paste to keep them in their places, but not more than can be helped. Boil some macaroni broken an inch long, in suffi- cient stock No. 1; when tender take away the stock, add two ounces of butter and two tablespoonfuls of grated Parmesan cheese ; heat it till it begins to simmer, and with it fill up the space in the middle of the cutlets; let a little of the macaroni appear above the top of the cutlets. Pour a sauce into the dish, made thus. Put half a pint of stock No. 2 into a stewpan, add to it a quarter of a head of garlic (or a slice of onion), and a few pieces of chopped mush- rooms ; rub an ounce of fiour into an ounce of butter; simmer it ten minutes, strain it through a sieve, and boil it away one half. Tomato sauce is veiy good with this dish, instead of the sauce just described.

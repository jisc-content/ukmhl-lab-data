63 AND TABLE DRESSING. arrival of each course, as well as in the above manoeuvre, was very much greater than is now taken by handing dishes to the guests; therefore I think that we are in a better position than formerly, to try if some newly organized system of waiting may not enable us to be equally well served by fewer people. Could this be accomplished the advantages would be numerous : there would be less chance of bustle in the dining-room, and a saving of inconvenience below stairs, where strangers (having to be fed and enter- tained just at a busy time) perplex the^’egular set of servants; there would be also considerable reduc- tion of expense. If it were urged that dinners could not be elegant without a train of attendants, it mio-ht be suggested that to reduce their number would give a more modest, less pretentious air to our hospi- tality, which would tend to the improvement of our manners, and evince true refinement. To become more practical in my suggestions, let us suppose a table laid for eight persons dressed in its best; as attendants, only two persons, a butler and footman, or one of thos'e with a page, or neat waiting-maid, and let us suppose somebody stationed outside the door, to do nothing but fetch up and carry off dishes one by one. There might be a sort of drill exercise as follows :— Whilst guests are being seated, person outside brings up soup. Tootraan receives soup at tlie door.

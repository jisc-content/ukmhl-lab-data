mSCELLANEOUS EECEIPTS. 429 Wafer Biscuits. Rub a piece of butter the size of a walnut into a bandful of fine flour, make it into a stiff, smooth paste with warm milk and the white of an egg beaten to a froth; beat the paste with a rolling-pin for at least half an hour, or longer (the goodness of the biscuits depends on the length of time that they are beaten); take small pieces and roll them out to the size of a saucer; they must be so thin that, when held to the light, they can be seen through: they cannot be too thin. Bake them very lightly. Petticoat Tails. This is a genuine receipt of a cake much Jiked in Scotland; it is chiefly given for its amusing name, which is a corruption of petits gateaux tailles. Take a quarter of a pound of butter, which soften before the fire, and mix it well with two ounces of white pounded sugar; then leaven in with the above half â€¢pound of flour. Make all up into a ball, then roll it out to neai'ly the size of a dinner-plate, raising the edge of the cake a little, and marking it over with the quill end of a feather; move the cake on to a tin plate, having a piece of paper below the cake; then mark off in the middle of the cake a round space the size of the mouth of a wineglass, and from that mark eight segments.

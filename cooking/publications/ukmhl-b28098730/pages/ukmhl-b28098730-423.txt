Two tablespoonfuls of flour, two of white sugar, three eggs, the whites and yelks beaten separately, and a pinch of salt; whip it with a wdiisk for a quarter of an hour; pour in by degi’ees half a pint of milk, which has been boiled down to one half, or else half the quantity of milk and half of cream; keep whipping whilst you add the milk or cream, and continue to do so ten minutes after all is mixed. Chop up two ounces of either fresh or preserved pineaiiple; butter a soufflee dish ; put in the batter; cover the dish with paper, and let the paper stand tlu’ee inches above it; bake it in a moderate oven, not too cool, for about an hour; put a small piece of butter on the top, dust over it some white sugar, and salamander it lightly. This is a piainei’ soufflee, and moi’e quickly made than the former receipt. It may be flavoured with any fruit or with lemon-peel or vanilla. It is nice for an every day pudding, and if there is no fruit in it, it may be eaten with some cold butter. It may be baked in a common pudding-dish, but always requires the paper roimd the dish, and to be finished with butter and sugar, and’salamandered. 26—2

DINNERS FOR ONE OR TWO GUESTS. 393 Lambsâ€™ Sweetbreads in White Sahcb. Trim four sweetbreads with the greatest care, then hlancli them by putting them into cold water ; set them on the fire till they almost boil, hut not quite; put them again directly into cold water, and repeat the same till they look white; then let them lie for ten minutes in cold water; set them in a stewpan with half a pint of veal broth or stock; lay over them a slice of bacon, and cover them with buttered paper; cover the pan closely, and let them simmer very gently for an hour and a quarter. Make a rich white sauce, by putting a quarter of a pound of butter into a stewpan, with three tablespoonfuls of flour; stir it whilst it melts, till it is quite smooth; then strain the stock in which the sweetbreads have been cooked, and skim ofiP any fat, and add it to the butter and flour; simmer it, stirring all the time, for half an hour; add some cayenne and salt, and half a teacupful of cream; pour the white sauce over the sweetbreads, and serve with French beans round the dish. Leg of Mutton. For four persons a large leg would be very ugly; if a small one cannot be had without being bespoken, a loin or a neat square piece of the breast had better be substituted. The leg should have a cut paper on the bone, and the loin or breast will require potato balls, nicely fried.

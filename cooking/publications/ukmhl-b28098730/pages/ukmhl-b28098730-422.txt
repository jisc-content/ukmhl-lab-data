402 DINNERS FOR ONE OR TWO GUESTS. Mushroom Croquets. Prepare a dozen rather small mushrooms; chop them small, and put them into a saucepan, with a tahlespoonful of strong glaze and a tahlespoonful of water; let them simmer a few minutes, put them into a deep saucer, and set them in a cold place. Make a small joiece of short paste, roll it very thin indeed. When the mushroom is quite cold, cut it into six pieces, enclose each in paste, taking care to join the edges; cover them with yelk of egg thickly, and roll them in very dry bread-crumbs; fry them a delicate brown, and serve with some fried parsley : they must he as large as a bantamâ€™s egg. If there is not enough good glaze, a little isinglass must be dissolved and used instead: a tablespoonful of grated ham, ready cooked, might be added to the chopped mushrooms. Celery with Tomatos. Boil a dozen fine tomatos, drain them on a sieve, and then scoop out the inside of each with a wooden spoon; pass the pulp through a sieve, stew three heads of celery in a little stock for one hour and a half, drain them on a sieve, then put them whole into a stewpan, with the pulp of tomato, a little cayenne and salt, and half a teacupful of stock; warm it and serve with the mutton.

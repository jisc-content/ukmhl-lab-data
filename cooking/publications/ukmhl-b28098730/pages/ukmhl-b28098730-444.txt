424 MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. A German receipt for some with chocolate differs in a small degree from the above; it is as follows:â€” Chocolate Beignets. Scrape two ounces of vanilla chocolate, and pound two ounces of sugar, and boll them for a few minutes in half a pint of cream or new milk; set it to cool; tlien mix a little of the cream with half an ounce of ground rice, and put it all together with the yelks of three eggs; let it simmer. Put it into a dish; when cold, make it into equal forms, cover them with egg and bread crumbs, and fry them in butter. Poor Knights, a Swedish Dish. Cut a Drench roll across, and take off the crust; if there is no roll at hand, cut slices of white bread without crust half an inch thick, any neat shape all alike; soak them in half a pint of hot milk, which has two ounces of butter dissolved in it; let them drain for five minutes on a sieve, fry them in butter; the butter must boil before they are put in; they must be fried till they are a light brown and crisp; set them on a dish, put a layer of any sort of preserved fruit, then another of the bread, and so on ; sift a little white sugar on the top slice of bread. To make these richer, put on each slice, before the preserve, a teaspoonful of brandy or wine.

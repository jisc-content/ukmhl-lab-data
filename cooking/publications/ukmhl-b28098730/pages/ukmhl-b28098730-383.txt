363 THE PLUM PUDDING. Remarks. And so our double cycle of ceremonious dinners ends with a plum-pudding. Where could we find a more appropriate climax for our English bills of fare, or so fit a dainty either to close the culinary year or to begin the next? Are we not weary, dear reader, of our cookery—weary of contri\dng the best, easiest, and least wasteful ways of catering for fastidious appetites—weary even of settling how we shall most clearly describe the composition of our plum-pudding ? Let us repose a moment and talk about it. As to its history I am not very learned; but I know at least that we cannot assign to its existence any very high antiquity. In the compilation of re- ceipts made by Richard the Second’s “ master cooks,” we find no trace of it; nor is there any in that other manual of ancient cookery, dated A.D. 1381, which we have already alluded to. Most of the materials were, however, at the cook’s command at that period. They had spices and used them in profusion, also almonds and raysons of Corance, and they were beginning to use sugar to replace their honey ; there was almost everything but the genius to combine them. Regretting, then, that our antiquarian re- searches will not help us to the knowledge of when plum-jnidding came first to light, we may at least affirm that at whatever time it might have appeared in England, it is still virtually non-existent in foreign

In another stew- pan put the rest of the stock strained, and three quarts of stock No. 1; boil it fast for full two hours; lift the lid for the last half-hour and let it reduce to two quarts, when it Avill be clear. When ready to serve, put in the joints with the carrots; drain both before the fire for a few minutes before putting them into the soup, that the stock about them may not spoil the clearness ; add salt and cayenne, and half a teaspoonful of white sugar.

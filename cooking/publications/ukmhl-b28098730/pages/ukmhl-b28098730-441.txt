421 MISCELLANEOUS EECEIPTS. Cloi&tons eoe Soup {or to he used with Cheese or Batter.) Pull either roll or white crumb of bread to pieces, set it oil papei', and diy it in a cool oven till it is pale yellow. When used for soup, set some pieces a second time in the oven on a plate, with a small piece of butter on each, and let them become a little browner than before. Put them in the soup the last moment before servino;. Ceeam Cheese. There is nothing more useful than to know how to make a nice cream cheese. Take a small table- napkin, dip it in boiling water, squeeze it, and lay it inside a sieve (the size of the sieve depends on the quantity of cream); put a little salt to the cream, and pour it in not more than two inches deep: less will do; set the sieve upon a plate, and lay a cover over it to keep off the dust; change the plate be- neath the sieve every day. The cheese will be ready either in a week or fortnight, according to the weather. It is worth while to do this with even so little as a teacupful of cream which will not keep for other purposes, and cream which has begun to get a little sour is equally good for the purpose.

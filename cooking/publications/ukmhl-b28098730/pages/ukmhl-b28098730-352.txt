SPECIAL INSTKUCTIONS FOR 332 PoTAGE Blanc.—(^White Soup of Vegetable Marroio.') Peel four fine vegetable marrows; take out the seeds and cut the marrow into slices; put it into a stew- pan with a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, some salt, a teaspoonful of powdered sugar, a little cayenne, and one onion sliced; let it stew on a very moderate fire till the vegetable is quite done to a pulp ; rub it through a sieve, then put it back into the stewpan, and add two tablespoonfuls of flour mixed ■with a pint of stock or any nice broth you may have; simmer it all for a quarter of an hour, and add more salt if wanted; then stir half a teacupful of cream or new milk boiled down to half its quantity; stir it while it heats altogether, and serve. Some dice of crumb of bread, fried a light colour in fresh butter, may be sent up or not at pleasure; or some croutons are also very nice. This is a very nice soup, but may be changed for Julienne if preferred. Rognons de Mouton au Vin de Madere. (fMutton Kidneys with Madeira.') Trim nicely six or eight mutton kidneys; cut them in two lengthways, and then slice each piece into eight or ten slices; put them into a stewpan with some small sized mushrooms sliced into nearly the same shape as the kidney; add a pinch of nutmeg, some white pepper, and half a teaspoonful of sweet herbs

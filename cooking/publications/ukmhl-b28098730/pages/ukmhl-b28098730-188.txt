168 SPECIAL IXSTEUCTIOXS FOR Escalopes de Salmon A l’Espagnole. (^Salmon Cutlets.') Take three slices of salmon, divide them, after skinning, into pieces the size of a small veal cutlet. Put into a stewpan a quarter of a pound of butter, heat it whilst melting, then put in the pieces side by side; powder them with salt and pepper, and let them simmer half an hour. Reduce a pint of stock No. 2 to one half by boiling, put it to the fish, and let it simmer again half an hour. Take out the stock. Rub a tea- spoonful of flour in one ounce of butter, mix it with the stock and boil, stirring without ceasing for ten minutes. Skim off the butter; add a teaspoonful of finely chopped parsley, a little pinch of nutmeg, cayenne and salt, and a teaspoonful of lemon juice; pour the sauce on the scallops. Remarks.—This is an excellent dish, but it requires to be done on a moderate stove or hot-plate, and to have very great attention that it may not to he allowed to burn at any part of the process. The method differs from that of dressed soles and salmon, and it will be worth while to tell a young cook not to fancy that one way would be as good as another; and she is not to suppose that the order to use or to leave out a paper, and other trifles, has not a meaning; for unless these receipts are followed with the paper in hand, and strictly adhered to, there will be no chance of success.

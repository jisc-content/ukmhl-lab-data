The object of braising is to keep the juices in the fibres ; the gentler, and more equally applied heat, partly tends to this effect, which is further promoted by the liquid used being not water but stock, which already contains the same juices as the meat: so that if a current were to take place there would only be an interchange of particles; but the smaller quantity of liquid, which does not wholly cover the meat, reduces the liability to a cur- rent through it.

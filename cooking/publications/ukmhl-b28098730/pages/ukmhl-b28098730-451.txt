MISCELLANEOUS EECEIPTS. 431 tended melted butter is using flour, which sin appeal's in the most aggravated form when the compost is half-boiled, leaving a disagreeable raw flavoiuâ€™. Tlie reason why butter by being beaten changes from a semi-transparent and semi-solid substance into a white thick liquid, will be easily understood by a slight glimpse into natural jfliilosophy. Butter is constituted of small globules, each globule being a sac or cell which contains fluid; by beating, the walls of these minute cells are broken and the contents poured out, all mixing together: this proves that there is a scientiflc object in beating, namely, to change the nature of the butter to one more suited to the purpose. Of course, butter thus beaten can never return to its original state. The same change takes place in oil when it is beaten for a mayonnaise.

477 THE HOUSEHOLD. us—the eye to see that which it before was blind to perceive^ the tutored ear open to harmony which it before was deaf to. There is no greater kindness to be done to any fellow-creature than to help them to a new sense of the beauty of created things; and it is a mistake to suppose that a housemaid is not , capable of the enjoyment. One chief use in this sort of communication with our servants, is to remove a notion on their part that they are thought to be little better than so many machines, whose work is neither understood nor noticed. The truth is that no work is too small to be worth an effort, or too mean to have a prin- ciple of duty imparted to the doing of it: if it be only the dusting of a chair, it may be well done or it may be ill done, and the determination to do it in the very best way, takes away the monotony of labour, whilst the wish to please an observing and kind employer, raises the little act into a virtue. I have only hinted at some small opportunities of awakening an interest in common work; there are a thousand such ways by which a mistress may influence her servants without their being aware of her intention, and by which she may rouse their energies, and excite them to work—first for love of her, and next for love of doing right; and so she may make their lives more happy. Fresh instances of this kind will occur continually, and the power of turning them to profit will grow by exercise.

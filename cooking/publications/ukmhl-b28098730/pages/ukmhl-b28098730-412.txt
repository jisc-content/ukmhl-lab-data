392 DINNEKS EOR ONE OR TWO GUESTS. fill up tlie cups, and bake the puddings in a rather hot oven for twenty minutes; turn them out with the bottom part uppermost. They may be served dry on paper, or with apricot or any other pudding sauce : a teaspoonful of brandy in each pudding is an improvement. Open Gooseberry Tart. Have a pint of gooseberries well picked, put them in a jar, and set it in a saucepan of boiling water: there must be no water in the jar. When the goose- berries are softened, but not flattened, pound six ounces of white sugar, and put it on the top of the gooseberries; let it melt through them; put the jar in a cool place, pour off the syrup, boil it, and pour it over the fruit; repeat the same four times. The syrup will become quite thick, but must not have any water added to it. Make a puff paste, line a tart tin, and bake it lightly, but completely; remove any of the paste which has risen in the middle, and let it get cold ; put in the fruit, and pour the syrup over them, and sprinkle them rather thickly with green sugar. »<>> JUNE.—DINNER FOR FOUR PERSONS.

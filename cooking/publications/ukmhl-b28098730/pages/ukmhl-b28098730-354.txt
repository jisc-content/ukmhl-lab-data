SPECIAL INSTKUCTIONS FOR 334 Compote de Pommes.—{J\£ould of Apples in Jelly.') Take ten small russets, or any small apples that by trial are known to boil clear; peel them very smoothly, and take out the cores with a cutter: the apple must not be divided ; set them in a stewpan ; sift half a pound of white sugar over them, add a teacupful of water; add the peel of two lemons cut very thin, some of it cut into strips the size of thin twine; put a piece of paper closely over all; set the pan on a very moderate stove; watch them very carefully, and as they get clear take them out; some will be ready before the rest, and must be directly removed, to prevent their softening too much; place them on a sieve, and let them get cold. Make one pint of jelly as at page 122 ; flavour it as there directed, with wine. The mould must be a plain one like a pudding mould; wet it and put in the jelly a quarter of an inch deep ; lay in a few of the strips of lemon-peel in any neat form; let the jelly set; then lay in five of the apples and a few more strips of lemon-peel; lay on those the other five apples, and fill up with the jelly; set it on ice one hour before turning out. The syrup must be saved, and will help to make an excellent apple tart, or may be used with rice another day.

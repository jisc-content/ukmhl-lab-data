DINNERS EOR ONE OR TWO GUESTS. 409 Genoese Trifle. Have five sponge biscuits, put tliem on the disli, and lay two on the top; mix two wineglassfuls of sherry and a tablespoonful of brandy; let it soak gradually into all the biscuits ; cover the two top ones with currant jelly; blanch, and split an omicc of almonds ; cut each half almond into three pieces; take those which are of an even size and stick them closely through the currant jelly into the bis- cuits. Make a rich custard of the yelks of four eggs, half a pint of milk or cream, and sugar ; chop up what remains of the almonds with two bitter almonds, mix them with the custard, and pour it cold into the dish: a round glass dish is suitable. This is-very nearly the old-fashioned tipsy cake, and an easy and excellent Christmas dish.

Remarks on Dessert, No. 4.—The azalea in the centre group may be changed for white hyacinths or a heath. If the azalea has not abundance of bloom, and the growth is not low and even, the heath would be preferable, or a pale yellow one might look well, as it would be nearly white by candle-light. Two tall vases, or glasses, of cut flowers are introduced into this dessert by way of variety, but their adoption is not much recommended. The flowers would look best not grouped into a formal bouquet, but placed lightly in; none but those cut with long stalks wi]J look well. There may be light yellow and pink azaleas, some scarlet geraniums, and a few tall, thin fronds of ferns. The top and bottom cakes may be tall and highly ornamented. The two side groups of fruit may be arranged carelessly as the colours may suit best. Materials for this Dessert. pound of white grapes. „ of purple grapes. 2 ornamented cakes. 12 lady apples. 12 Tangerine oranges. 3 lbs. of crystallized fruits. 1 lb. orange rings. 1 lb. knots. This is rather a small dessert, and will depend much for its success upon the beauty of the service. If the dishes are tall and choice in pattern and material, it will look better than if more crowded. The tall vases may be replaced to advantage by statuettes; twotorchettes of three hghts each ivill be indispensable if there is no suspended lamp.

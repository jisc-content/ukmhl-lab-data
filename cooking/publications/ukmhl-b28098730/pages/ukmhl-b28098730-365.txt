DINNERS EOR EACH MONTH. 345 Have a small teacupfiil of Carolina rice boiled tender, and add it to tlie soup. Remarks.—As some people like a stronger taste of tke tomato than others, it is a good plan to send the sauce up separately in a sauce-tureen; the rice is also sometimes handed by itself. Beignets d’Hditees.—(^Oyster Fritters.) Make a very stiff beignet paste as follows:—Take a quarter of a pound of butter, put it in a stew- pan, and just warm it, then beat it to a cream; beat up the whites of two and the yelks of three eggs, whites and yelks separately, with the creamed butter, a pinch of salt, a pinch of carbonate of soda, and one teaspoonful of the oyster liquor; add a quarter of a poimd of flour, and beat it hal’d for a quarter of an hour; it should be very thick, but if it should get too thick to beat, add another spoonful of oyster liquor. Beard a dozen and a half of oysters, dip them in the butter, and set into the frying-pan in boiling butter; let as much butter cling about them as possible, and it should spread out like a pancake; take a knife and turn up the edges of the batter over the oysters whilst they are being fried. Remarks.—These should look rough at the top and rather high; if they are flat they look very shabby. They 'will require to be done in a good deal of butter, in a small pan, and be crisp. The colour must be very pale, and the fritters ought to have a trans- parent barley-sugar look. Serve in a heap, with a fringed paper on the dish.

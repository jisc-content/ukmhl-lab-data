ON THE DINING-EOOM. 72 all sensation of being at ease during the whole entertainment: timid talkers have been known to be actually made dumb by it. It is worse when chairs are of unequal height: a shy woman perched up above a small-sized gentleman feels in a pillory, or she is more than half suppressed in a low chair, trying to reach up to her soup-plate: this incon- venience is easily guarded against. There is one trifling subject on which, whilst yve are occupied about chairs and tables, a hint may be serviceable. It happens to be thought polite, in the ceremony of sitting down to table, to place ladies and gentlemen alternately with studious care, and an apology is generally offered when this arrange- ment fails; though why we should have nothing pleasant to say to our fair sisters, or why the men should be wronged bj’- having the opportunity afforded them of communicating their bright ideas to each other, does not seem clear: at any rate, nine times out of ten that arrangement does fail. It is curious to note how, almost as certain as the failure occurs, the remark follows that the right arrangement is a puzzle, or that it is very difficult, or that it can’t be done. If you wish to prove whether it can or not, make a simple diagram: place hostess at the top, and host at bottom, opposite to each other; there will then be a pair of ladies, and a pair of gentlemen somewhere; but place host and hostess not opposite, but diagonally to each other.

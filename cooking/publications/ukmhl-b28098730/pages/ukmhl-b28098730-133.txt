Stew for an hour very gently on the hot plate. Take away the stock, and leave the fish in the pan to keep warm, not in a place hot enough to dry it. Put into another small stewpan half a pint of stock No. 2, and the stock from the fish, with a tablespoon- ful of bechamelle, and the same quantity of Harvey sauce, of anchovy, and of mango pickle, and a little cayenne and salt; simmer for five minutes, and put it in the bain-marie; just before serving, add a table- spoonful of sherry and a small bottle of capers.

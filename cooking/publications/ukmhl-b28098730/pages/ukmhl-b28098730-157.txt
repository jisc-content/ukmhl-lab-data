137 DINNERS EOR EACH MONTH. It will be prudent not to trouble a young cook with the work of larding; it wants a good deal of practice, and even when learned, takes up too much time: the poulterer may be ordered to call for the fillets, when they are beaten and trimmed; he will do it better. When a cook wants to learn larding, she must have a lesson fi’om a person whose business it is, as the art cannot well be acquired from description. He will inform her of the right sort of bacon to use; common bacon being of no use; it is sure to fail, and be a disappointment. COTELETTES DE MoUTON AUX CONCOMBEES. (^Mutton Cutlets with Cucumbers.') Take two necks of small mutton, the bones of which are cut the proper length: cut the cutlets with a hone in each, beat each separately, then thin the meat off each side, removing all the fat. Scrape the ends of the bones—there must he an inch and a half of the scraped bone; lay them in a plate, and leave them in a cool place to get firm after being worked. Previously to finishing them, have bread-crumbs ready which have been passed through a wire sieve, and left for several hours to dry. Mix with the crumbs, when you use them, a little white pepper, some salt, and a little parsley chopped very fine. Egg the cutlets, and cover them with the crumbs, and fiy them in fresh butter; take care they are a pale yellow brown.

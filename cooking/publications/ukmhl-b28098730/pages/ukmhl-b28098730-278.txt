Put the partridge cutlets into a braising pan, with a quarter of a pound of butter; set it uncovered on a moderate hot plate, and let it boil, moving them gently about so as not to burn or change colour ; then put in a glass of white wine, and the half pint of reduced broth, cover them with paper, and then with the lid; put a little charcoal on the top of the pan, keep the pan in a very moderate part of the hot plate for three quarters of an hour, then take out the broth, and set the pigeons to keep warm, skim the broth, and strain it; add cayenne and salt, and a teaspoonful of lemon juice; thicken it with a dessert-spoonful of flour rubbed into half an ounce of butter; boil it a quarter of an hour stirring all the time, and strain it again through a tammy. Make a bed of prepared rice in a circle in the dish, lay on the partridge cutlets, the breasts length- ways round the dish, pour the sauce all over them : it will be better for a few truffles placed in the middle. This is meant for six pieces in each dish, which is enough for fourteen people.; if the party numbers sixteen, there must be seven partridges. Dindon et Langue. {Boiled Turley and Tongue.)

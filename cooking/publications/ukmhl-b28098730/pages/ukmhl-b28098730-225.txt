DI^TNEES FOR EACH MONTH. 205 Codfish with oyster sauce has been inserted in this carte, in order to avoid the lobster sauce which is so indispensable for either turbot or salmon, that being too like a repetition of the soup; but it is scarcely appropriate for a ceremonious dinner at this season; very fine boiled soles and shrimp sauce might be substituted: if neither are approved, the soup might be changed to oyster or any other white soup, and the lobster soup reserved for December, when cod and oyster sauce is never out of place.

Eemarks on Dessert, No. 10.â€”It is difficult at this season to find suitable plants for an epergne, and as the closing year inspires a craving for all that is bright and full of iivartn colour, the delicate verdure of ferns now becomes unsuitably cold and almost cheerless. We have returned to the assiettes montees, and bon- bons, which, though less strictly in good taste than statuettes, look gayer, and serve their purpose of enlivening the gloomy season. In the country house, the conservatory or greenhouse may perhaps afford some good substitute for chrysanthemums aud fuchsias, which are less attractive than one- could wish; they might, how- ever, be set up with success. A blazing fire and more than usual light about the dining room will be the best aids to the cheerful appearance of the table.

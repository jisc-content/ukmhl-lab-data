SUGGESTIONS TO THE BENEVOLENT. 447 au-feuj it would be worth while to explain to those who mean to try the plan, that if a solid piece of meat is to be cooked in this way, as much heat as can be managed must be ajDplied to the jar for tlie first ten minutes : it would be a good jDlan to plunge the meat into a saucepan full of ready boiling water, and keep it on the fire for that time; then to arrange it in the jar with whatever can be afforded, and leave it in any place where it may most conveniently receive an equal gentle heat; there it may stay a day or two days, or even more. The jar must, however, be entirely emptied twice a week, and the inside scalded Avith hot Avater before fresh proAusions axâ€™e put in. In giving preliminary directions, that of tying down the cover very closely must not be omitted. The neatness of this mode of cooking is an obvious advantage, especially favourable to the comfort of poor peoide ; it supersedes the saucepan, which takes so large a space on the small fire, saving the business of cleansing the banished saucepan : the dirty work of cleaning is, in fact, as far as the outside is concerned, not much attempted; and, as for the badly tinned inside, it is impossible to purify it: the jar, on the contrary, Avith its glazed surface, is easily made clean and Avholesome; thus both labour and imtidiness are spared. To all the immediate advantages that might attend the adoption of this simple system, there may be added an indirect one to be found in the effort to

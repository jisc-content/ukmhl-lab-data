If ices follow this dinnei', vanilla cream and inille-fruits water will be most suitable; there being no vanilla in the entremets: in the three winter months, however, ices are superfluous, as they can hardly he called a suitable luxury. The following is the English version of the pre- ceding carte, and is required for the kitchen:— BILL OF FAEE, Dinner of the of January, at a Quarter past Seven, Queen’s Soup, with Italian Paste. Clear Vegetable Soup. Fillets of Soles (Sauce on the dish). Turbot, Lobster Sauce (to be handed). Croquets of Oysters. Quenelles, with Truffles and Mushrooms. Mutton Cutlets, with Tomato Sauce. Fowls and Ham. Sauce in tureen (to be put upon each plate). Saddle of Mutton. Cauliflowers. Mashed Potato. Pheasant. Grouse. Bread Sauce. Sea-kale. Cabinet Pudding. Jelly. Cake filled with Oranges. Vanilla Cream. Cheese Biscmts. Remarks.—Two copies of the above must be written—one for the cook, one for the carver: the sauces and vegetables are noted to remind both. It may be well to write English only for the cook, and add the French names of the entrees for the side-table, as some servants name the dishes as they hand them.

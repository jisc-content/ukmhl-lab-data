Cut as many even-sized steaks as you can from a leg of lamb; put them in a stewpan, with some lemon-peel, salt, and a blade of mace, and eight white mushrooms, with some millc. Let the steaks simmer gently till they are quite tender; take them from the milk; pound up the mushrooms in a mortar, with a little salt and cayenne. Then put tlie steaks into a small stewpan with a teacupful of stock No. 2, a pinch of flour rubbed into a piece of butter the size of a nut, and a teacupful of cream, and the pounded mushrooms; let it simmer very gently, stirring all the time for ten minutes. Serve it in the form of a blanquette, that is, in a heap. Have a few more very small mushrooms ready boiled, and put them into the sauce the last thing. Some very neatly shaped sippets should be fried in butter, and laid in the dish. A shoulder of veal may be done whole the same way, and surrounded by either French beans or small pieces of cauliflower: the mushrooms are essential to its being good.

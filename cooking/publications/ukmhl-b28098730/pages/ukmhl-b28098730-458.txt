If that should ever he wished to reapj)ear hot, it must be divided neatly into joints, and made with care into a salmi; which is a very different thing from common hashing. The closed jar is not so useful for cooking poultry, excepting for any which may be suspected of age and toughness ; in which case it may be made excellent, either put in fresh or after being roasted. It will require bacon, white stock, a very few vegetables, and less spice than is good with game. Rabbits that are not extremely young are cooked with great advantage by the same means; but it must be remem- bered that the closed jar is not intended for slices of meat of any kind. Calves’ feet and lambs’ feet may have the first part of the preparation as well done in the jar as in a stewpan, and with much less trouble.

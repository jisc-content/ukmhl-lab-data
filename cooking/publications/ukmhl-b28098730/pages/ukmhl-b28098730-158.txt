SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR 138 To prepare the Cucumbers. Have two cucumbers of moderate size, peel them, cut them down the middle into two lengths, cut each of these into pieces three inches long, pare off the edges and round the ends. Take out the seeds, lay the pieces in salt and water for two hours, put them on a sieve to dry. When dry, put them into a preserving jar with two ounces of butter, a teaspoonful of lemon juice, and a teaspoonful of white sugar; set the jar in a cool oven for about an hour; watch carefully that they are not turning yellow; if they are, take them out. Pour off the juice, and add a teasjDoonful more of white sugar and a teaspoonful of vinegar; let the jar stand in the screen an hour or two, and half an hour be- fore serving set it in the bain-marie: the colour should be bright green. Dish up the cutlets by making a bed of pre^^ared rice round the outer part of the dish; set the cutlets neatly on it, the ends being all inwards; place the cucumber in the middle; have the sauce ready and pour it in the dish. If the cucumbers do not look a sufficiently bright green, strew over the top a little green sugar. (For directions to make green sugar, see Miscellaneous Receipts.) Some cooks make little frills of paper for the ends of the cutlets, but they are rather old- fashioned.

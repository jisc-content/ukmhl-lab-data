They are very like real quenelles, and, if made into small balls, are good in any kind of soup. Pate d’Italie.—(^Italian Paste for Soups.) Take one ounce of flour, a pinch of salt, a quarter of an ounce of butter, and half the yelk of an egg; add a few drops of hot water, and make it into a very stiff paste ; beat it for half an hour with a roll- iug-pin; roll it thin; cut it into small shapes; lay the pieces on a sheet of white paper, and set it near the fire to dry gradually for four or five hours : it may be in the screen, if the fire is not very large. The paste will keep ten days in paper, in a dry place; but it is better made the day before it is wanted. To boil the paste for soup, put it into boil- incT water with a little salt in it; boil it for twenty minutes, and drain the water from it. This paste will serve for all purposes for which macaroni is used, and is better.

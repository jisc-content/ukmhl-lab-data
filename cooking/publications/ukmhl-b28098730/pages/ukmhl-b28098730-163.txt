Make the jelly as directed for dinner No. 1; two- thirds of the quantity will be sufficient; it may have either brandy or noyau to flavour it in the same pro- portion. Have fourteen fine oranges, peel them, re- move with great care all the white rind, divide them into quarters, and remove all the white and the seeds. Let them lie half an hour in a preserving jar, with a glass of brandy poured over them; pour out the brandy, and put it again on the top twice, that all may be wetted; then add what remains of the brandy to the jelly; place the pieces of orange neatly in the mould after wetting it; when a quarter full, pour in some jelly just to the top of the orange; let it stand till the jelly is set; then put in some more orange, and fill the mould: do not heat the jelly a second time. Set the mould on ice only two hours before serving. There may be more or fewer oranges according to fancy, but three for each mould will be sufficient. The same may be done with Tangerine oranges, not put in so close : they are very nice, but expensive.

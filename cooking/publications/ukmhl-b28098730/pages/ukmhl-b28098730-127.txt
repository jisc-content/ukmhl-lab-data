107 GETTING UP A DINNER. siglit can produce it; and one method of guard- ing against it, is to adopt the unvarying habit of having a separate spoon in every pan that may he on a stove, and a basin of water ready to put every one in when done with: I am assured that to stir a soup whilst serving, with a spoon from a greasy stewpan, is quite sufficient to do the mischief, and spoil the two days’ woi’k. As a general exhortation to the cook, too much cannot be said about strictly adhering on all occa- sions to the quantities laid down for thickening, as well as to the time of cooking after the thicken- ings have been added: failure in this particular may be traced in the cooking of many who profess to be accomplished. A useful caution may be added on the same autho- rity about the cleansing of the stewpans: one must be kept exclusively for dressed fish ; and though for that the utmost pains ought to be expended on its cleanliness, yet for any other entree the use of it would be ruinous. Frying-pans are of even more consequence to be thoroughly purified; and those used for biscvTits or omelets must be used for nothing else. The utmost attention must also be bestowed on jelly-bag strainers and pudding-cloths, which must be washed in boiling water, without soap or soda.

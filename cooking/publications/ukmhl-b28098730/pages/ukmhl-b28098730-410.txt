Remarks.—It may seem a strange waste of trouble to teach anybody how to make a gooseberry pudding, which is a common, not particularly attractive dish, and seems not much worth the attempt to make it otherwise; yet it is one of the very things ■which is especially worth attention, as it may he made a rival to the best of Charlottes or other still more approved entremets. By following this receipt exactly, there is little doubt that the baked gooseberry pudding will be found a valuable addition to the daily list. Rliubarb may be done the same way with equal success Observe particularly that there is an ample quantity of butter and sugar put inside the basin.

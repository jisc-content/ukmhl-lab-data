THE HOUSEHOLD. 494 in the relation between masters and servants, than it is the fashion to allow. We talk over only the annoying incidents, and expect perfection amongst fallible creatures; we compare their independent manners with instances of that old traditionary devo- tion, which probably were as much exceptions to the general rule of the period as signal examples of attachment are at present, and which, when they did occur, belonged to the remains of serfdom, and could scarcely, therefore, be reproduced in the times we live in: but I am convinced that no household can have subsisted many years without numerous occasions for mutual good feeling having arisen, and much happiness having been experienced by both parties in the exercise of genuine benevolence.

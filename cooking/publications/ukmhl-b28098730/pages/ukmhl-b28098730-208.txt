SPECIAL INSTEUCTIONS EOR 188 Gelee aex Fkaises.—{Jelly with Strawberries.') This jelly must be made the same as that in dinner No. 1, page 122. Have a pound of very bright coloured, middling sized strawberries; put a very little jelly in the mould; let it cool a little, and then lay the strawberries in each compartment or knob of the moulds, the brightest part towards the outside; then fill up the moulds so as just to cover the straw- berries. Set it to cool for half an hour, not on ice, but in a cool place; then fill up with the jelly, which by that time, in consequence of being in lai’ge quantity, will not be too much set, if it has been left in a moderately warm place: to heat it again would spoil it. If strawberries are scarce, they may be bought by the dozen, and two dozen might in that case be sufficient. Lemon Cheesecakes, or “ Maids of Honour.” Rub the rind of two large lemons with sugar; scrape off the sugar into a bason, as it becomes wet with the lemon essence; add a quarter of a pound of finely powdered sugar, a quarter of a pound of butter, the yelks of four eggs, and the juice of one lemon; put it in a stewpan; beat it with a wooden spoon whilst on a moderate stove till it thickens: it must not boil; set it in a bason to get cold.

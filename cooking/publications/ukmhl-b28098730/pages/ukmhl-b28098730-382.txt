362 THE PLUM PUDDING. Plum Pudding. Chop very finely a pound of suet—it must be extremely fresh and carefully picked from all skin, half a pound of flour and half a pound of bread crumbs, half a pound of moist sugar, one ounce of citron, one ounce of candied orange and lemon peel, half a nutmeg grated, a teaspoonful of salt, a pound of best currants carefully washed and dried on a cloth, a pound of raisins well picked and stoned, half an ounce of bitter almonds, one ounce of sweet almonds chopped, six eggs beaten yelks and whites together, and a glass of brandy ; mix it up together, with as much milk as will make it too thick to be poured, but not thick enough to be handled as paste : it only wants mixing well together—no kneading or beating—■ and must be made six hours before it is put into its mould; then line the bason or mould with a buttered paper, press in the pudding, lay a buttered paper on the top, tie a thick pudding-cloth closely over it, and boil for six hours: for Christmas day stick a pretty branch of holly with its red berries on the top, Avith a little frill of cut white paper where the stick goes in. Serve with sauce made of half a pint of very nice melted butter, a wineglassful of br^indy, and sugar to the taste.

Nothing could betray you into them but an exaggerated idea of the effort which your new duties call on you to make. It will be well to modertite that idea: to be earnest is the pet virtue of the day; but it is one which becomes, when out of place, if not a vice, that which is hated worseâ€”a bore. There are some people who can only work at railway speed, and slumber when they advance more slowly; some who can do nothino; unless their efforts are concentrated. In great things it is best to energize, especially in mental labour; for accumulated intellectual, like mechanical, power becomes multiplied by unremitted application ; but in little things, some are better done at leisure. A capital housekeeper in an after-dinner group of ladies is always voted unendurable, and our studies in the art of cooking will proceed more gracefully and more surely also, if we let them keep their proper places in the shade.

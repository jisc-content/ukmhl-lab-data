SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR 296 PoTAGE Aux Legumes.—( Vegetable Soup.) Take two cabbage lettuces and one Cos lettuce; wash them, lay them in cold water for an hour, then cut them up into small strips; have two cucumbers peeled and sliced, a handful of sorrel also chopped up, two sprigs of tarragon, and two green onions chopped fine, and a little chervil. Put a quarter of a pound of butter into a stewpan, melt it, and set in the vegetables; stir it well till all the butter is taken up by the vegetables. Put two ounces of floiu’ into two ounces of butter, add it to the vegetables, then simmer it for ten minutes, and skim off any butter that may rise. Put into another stewpan two quarts of stock No. 1, add to it the vegetables, and boil it briskly, stirring well, for half an hour. The stock will be reduced to three pints; then add a pint of green peas, one dessert-spoonful of powdered sugar, and a little pepper and salt; simmer it till the peas are tender. This, though a very nice soup, may not be thought suitable for a dinner-party. In that case any of the clear soups may be substituted. Where there is a garden any vegetable may be added for common use, as celery, carrots, and sliced onions. It is very good niade with thinner broth than the stock prepared for a dinner-party, and even water may be used, with a small quantity of gravy from any roasted meat, or a little glaze.

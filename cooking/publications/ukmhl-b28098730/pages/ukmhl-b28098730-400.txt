It is worth while to remark that it only requires strict attention to the minute details just given, in order to produce good soups daily at small expense ; but if that attention is not bestowed, distasteful broth will be the result. Many people with limited esta- blishments do not order soups daily, supposing them extravagant; but with a good system they are not so at all: it is a good plan to expect them to be sent up constantly and perfectly nice, and then the cook will never be at a loss how to proceed when guests are added to the party unexpectedly. In the fol- lowing cartes, suitable soups will be mentioned, which can be changed, if there is not sufficient notice for preparing them, for any of those just described.

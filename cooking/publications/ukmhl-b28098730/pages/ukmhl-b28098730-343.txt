Have half a pint of best double cream; add to it the mill?; and isinglass, and the gooseberry pulp, with three ounces of powdered white sugar and a pinch of grated nutmeg; taste to see Avhether it is sweet enough, if not, add a little more sugar; which will be wanted, or not, according to the age of the gooseberries. Whip the cream till it is a froth; let it stand half an hour; then put it into the cake; press it in gently with a spoon, as you put it in by degrees; let it stand up as high as you can conveniently make it; sprinkle over the top a little green sugar.

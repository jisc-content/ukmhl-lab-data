DIN2nEKS for each month. 333 very finely clioppecl; put in two ounces of butter; set it on the stove and stir it welb whilst it simmers briskly, for ten minutes; then add a teacupful of stock No. 1, and a tablespoonful of glaze; mix it all up together with another ounce of butter and half a teaspoonful of flour, and stir it well whilst it simmers for a quarter of an hour; add a little cayenne, two tablespoonfuls of white wine. Serve by laying the whole in the middle of the dish, and make a wreath round it of leaves of puff paste very lightly baked. Remarks.—This entree is given here by way of variety, as it is good and may be liked; but it is perhaps more suitable to family parties where it may be ascertained that it would be acceptable. Any one of the entrees proposed for dinners of 16 may be substi- tuted for this one. Blanqtjette de Volaille.—{Blanquette of Foiuls.) Proceed as at page 210. Two fowls will be suffi- cient ; serve them by arranging in a heap, which is the chief distinction of a blanquette from a fricassee. If this entree is wanted for a smaller party, a single fowl would be enough, and a few small slices of ham or tongue may be laid between those of the fowl. A nice and very pretty finish may be made of bottoms of artichokes; boil six of them and lay them round the dish ; pour over some of the sauce, and lay a truffle in the middle of each. In August, a few of the late season peas may be laid on each, instead of the truffle, or a circle of peas only may be used.

THE HOUSEHOLD. 487 debtor, both parties are placed in a false position. As tbis neglect proceeds often from mere forgetfulness, it is a o-ood plan to make a rule that we slioulcl be reminded when time for payment occurs. Many other means might be mentioned by whicli the state of domestic service might be impi'oved. It is desirable, not only to make it an enviable con- dition for persons of their class, but to make them, feel that it is so; and nothing Avould make them value it properly so much as increased difficulty in obtaining it. At present, those whom we hire to do us service seem to have no idea that the arrange- ment is equally for the benefit of both parties, and that it is as much needful for their convenience as our own. It is true, they might do other work, whilst we could not live as we do witbout servants ; but if they had the power of reasoning a little fur- ther, they might see that, without being waited on, most of our refinements on which the mechanic is employed must be abandoned. Whether correct or not, the servantsâ€™ notion is that we require them more than they require us ; hence the common result that the compact entered into, viz. to afibrd payment, abundant food, and a certain degree of liberty on the one part, and to do a stated amount of duty on the other, is in many cases strictly ob- served by the employers, and left unfulfilled by the employed, who care little about earning recommen- dations ; for, as they believe that they are wanted.

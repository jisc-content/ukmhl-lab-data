PEOCESSES OF COOIONG. 51 noted by Dr. Paris, which accounts for this natural antipathy, that certain spices and other stimulants, taken separately, are injurious, but that they become the reverse if taken in conjunction with others. He says, “ If any one spice, as the dried capsule of the capsicum, be taken into the stomach, it will excite a sense of heat and pain; in like manner will a quantity of pepper ; but if an equivalent quantity of these two stimulants be taken in combination, no such pain is produced, and a pleasant warmth is ex- peiienced, and a genial glow felt over the whole body; and if a greater number of spices be joined together, the chance of pain and inflammation being produced is still further diminished.” He goes on to quote Dr. Pordyce, who considered that the tiuth of this law was illustrated by the maxim in cookery, never to employ one spice if more can be procured. The Forme of Cury shows that ancient English cooks adopted thoroughly this maxim, probably with- out knowing the reason, but following natural instinct. There are few of the receipts in that book which do not include four or five kinds of spices ; one of them being generally pouderfort or poucbe mar- chand, which are supposed to have been preparations of various spices, something like modern curry powder. A copy of one of these receipts may amuse you. “ Sawgeat, Take pork and seeth it wel, and gride 4—2

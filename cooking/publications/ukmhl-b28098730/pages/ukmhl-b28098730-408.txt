Remarks.â€”In these brioches the raisins may be left out, as they are good without; but any kind of sweetmeat, fruit or almonds may be added. Sauce may be sent up with them, or not. They are very nice cold, for lunch, and may be made in a mould and eaten as a cake; but the mould must only be filled half full. Though the receipt is long, the trouble of making is very small. Stewed Rhubarb. Cut a pound of rhubarb into pieces an inch long, put it into a preserving jar, and set the jar in a saucepan on the fire for half an hour; take it out without breaking the pieces, and lay them on a sieve to drain; make a syrup of half a pound of sugar and a teaspoonful of the rhubarb juice; boil it ten minutes; let it cool; then add to it the rhubarb, and let it simmer for ten minutes. Serve it cold, in a flat glass dish, and be careful not to mash up the rhubarb in taking the pieces out. Tliis will keep good several days.

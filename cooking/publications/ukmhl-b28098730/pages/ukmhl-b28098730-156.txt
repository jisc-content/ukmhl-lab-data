SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS POR 136 salamander, and brown the heads only of the lardlngs, till they are a pale yellow; arrange a bed of prepared rice round the entree dish: there must be no rice in the middle ; set the fillets neatly in a circle, nine in each dish. Take half a pint of bechamelle and half a pint of white sauce, warm them together, fill up the middle with quenelles cut into dice an inch in size, and mushrooms; sprinkle the top with truffles; cut them, if they are too large, to the size of the quenelles. To prepare the Mushrooms. Peel and trim the mushrooms the day before, and put them in water with a tablespoonful of lemon- juice to remain all night; put them into a stewpan with a quarter of a pound of butter and half a tea- spoonful of lemon-juice; let them stand on the hot plate till they are tender: it may require two hours, but a little more or less ; take the mushrooms out of the butter, put them into a bain-marie pot, and just cover them with a little stock No. 2, and leave them in the bain-marie till wanted. Remarks.â€”The fillets must look moist and almost white, with yellow tops of the larding. The common fault is for them to turn dark-coloured, which would prove that they had been on too hot a part of the hot plate, and not sufficiently Avatched to see that they were not eooking too fast, and the moisture wasting away. This error will also harden them, which will entirely spoil the entree. Many cooks fill up the centre of the dish with rice before the mushrooms; this saves material, but spoils the dish.

DINNERS FOR EACH MONTH. 213 CnAETREIISE DE EbAISES. (Jifoulds of Strawberries and Cream.') Have two pounds of fine bright-coloured straw- berries and pick them. Make a cream as at page 124, and fiavour it with brandy or liqueur instead of vanilla; when the cream is ready, dip the moulds in water, and with a spoon line the bottom and sides of the moulds with the cream; set the straw- berries side by side in the cream till they make a complete covering of the inside of the moulds; then put in the whole of the cream intended for each mould, pressing it in with a spoon: attend to the directions about cooling and icing. NouaAT 1 LA Ceemb Noyau. (^Nougat Cream xoith Noyau.) This will be made the same as page 158, substi- tuting noyau or any other liqueur for the milk con- taining the vanilla: it will not require quite so much sugar. Gel:ee au Vin de Champagne. {Jelly of Champagne.) This jelly, instead of sherry and brandy, will re- - quire half a bottle of champagne for the two moulds, or more if it is desired to be extremely good; the champagne must not be put in till the jelly is very cool. A few white grapes would look well at the bottom of the mould, in the same way as the straw- berries, page 188.

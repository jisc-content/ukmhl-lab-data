The case of one poor girl, Nora D., has been related to me by one of my friends, through whose instrumentality the French mode of cooking was made known to several poor families. Nora is the daughter of two poor old people, one paralyzed, the other ill and weak in intellect, neither of them being able to work or even help themselves; the very small sum that she earned by going out to iron was so insufficient to support them that when my friend first visited her she had been obliged to propose to them the refuge of the workhouse. This was a prospect intolerable to the poor couple; they were in despair at the idea of being separated, for they had a more than common isolation to expect, because neither of them could speak a word of anything but Irish. Nora soon comprehended the advantage of the pot-au-feu; it had a very special one for her, for hitherto, even when her little earnings were enough to buy a dinner, she had to go out to work, and tlie old people. were in no condition to cook it for them- selves : all she could do was to leave them some bread and tea, and the mother -was just able to take it from before the fire. My friend gave her ajar and cover, and she set to work on the new system. Each day she put into it three pennyworth of meal, a penny- worth of rice, two onions, which cost a halfpenny.

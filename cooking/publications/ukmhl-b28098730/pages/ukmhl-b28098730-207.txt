187 DINNERS FOR EACH MONTH. On the morning of the dinner, cut the cakes out in the middle, leaving the walls rather more than half an inch thick; moisten the inside with a wineglassful of wine and brandy mixed, or with wine alone; take care not to wet any one part too much, so as to weaken the walls. Then make a cream as follows: put six ounces of isinglass into a large teacup; heat a teacupful of milk, so as not to boil, and pour it on the isinglass; when it is cool but not set, strain it; have a pint and a half of best double cream; put the lukewarm isinglass and milk into it, with five ounces of finely powdered sugar, and two wdneglassfuls of brandy; whisk it till it is a froth, and set it in a cool place for half an hour. Then put half into the middle of each cake; they need not be quite full; set them to cool, but not on ice. The last thing before serving, put in the gooseberries; let a few stand up above the top, w'ithout covering the edges of the cake. Throw the syrup over the gooseberries till it fills the space between them, and glazes their tops; if they do not look a very bright green, sprinkle over all some green sugar, made as directed in miscellaneous receipts: this is an improvement to the appearance in any case.

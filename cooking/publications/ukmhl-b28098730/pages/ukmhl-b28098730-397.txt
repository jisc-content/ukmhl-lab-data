DINNERS FOR ONE OR TWO GUESTS. 377 remember an observation made to me in my early days of bousekeej)ing by a bachelor friend who was somewhat of an epicure, “ Whatever you do, take care about the soup : it stamps the whole dinner ; if it is wretched stuff, nobody cares what you may give to follow it: it is not to be forgiven.” This was rather severe, but in a measure true; therefore a few directions, to avert the chance of such disasters, will be useful: they are derived from a most reliable practical authority. To send for soup meat on the morning of a dinner and set about the work according to the general directions already given, will not answer, because there would not be sufficient time for all the pro- cesses which are absolutely required. Every cook should adopt the rule of seldom or never being with- out a certain quantity of nice stock ready by her. In great kitchens the supply is made regularly twice a week, and large quantities of j^i’ovisions are used for it; we are, however, supposmg here only the resources of a small establishment where economy would hardly permit a proceeding on so large a scale. In the smallest establishment, however, there will be materials to use up almost every day which may furnish some nice stock gravy, such as from roast meat, trimmings of cutlets, or last I’emnants of joints, with the bones: all these stewed long and slowly with vegetables, herbs, and a small piece of lean ham, will afford as much as the family arc likely to want;

Quenelles de Lapereau a la Perigoed. Take off the flesh of two rabbits, remove all skin and tendons, chop it small, pound it veiy fine and pass it through a tammy; do the same with half the quantity of veal fat; and make some panada; then proceed with the quenelles as directed at page 116; when the pounding and mixing is completed, cut up some truffles into small dice, as much as will fill a teacup, mix them with the quenelles and finish them as at page 116.

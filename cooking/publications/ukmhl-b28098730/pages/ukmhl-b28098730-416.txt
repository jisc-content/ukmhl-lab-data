396 DINNEES FOE ONE OE TWO GUESTS. Braised Breast of Lamb. Have about fouiâ€™ pounds of the best part of a breast; take out all the bones; stew the bones in a quart of water, with half a carrot sliced, one onion, a sprig of mint, and a bay-leaf; close the pan, and let it simmer on a slow fire two or three hours; then take off the cover aiid boil it, stirring occasionally till the water is reduced to one pint; then strain it and skim the fat off carefully; add a teaspoonful of chopped mint, with a little cayenne and salt; sprinkle the mint on the lamb; then roll it up and bind it round with a tape; set it on a dripping-pan in the oven, tolerably hot, for ten minutes, and then put it into a stewpan with a pint of stock ; cover it with a buttered paper, and close the lid; set the pan to stew on the top of the oven for one hour; add a pint of peas, not too young; cover again, and let it stew for another hour and a half; rub two ounces of butter into two tablespoonfuls of flour, and add to it a tablespoonful of white sugar ; let it simmer for a quarter of an hour; take out the lamb, remove the bands, and serve with peas and sauce in the dish; glaze over the top of the lamb. This is a convenient dish for a small family, as it is equally good warmed a second day. The lamb taken from the peas is also, when cold, good and neat-looking for breakfiist or lunch.

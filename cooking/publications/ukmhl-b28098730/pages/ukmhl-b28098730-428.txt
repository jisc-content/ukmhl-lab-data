408 DINNERS EOR ONE OR TWO GUESTS. up. Pick out the bay-leaf and cinnamon; put into it while hot two ounces of butter, and two ounces of pounded sugar; beat it all up together in a basin ; then butter the inside of a mould—any mould will do, either of tin or earthenware; put in the rice, and press it with a wooden spoon against the sides ; put no rice at the bottom of the mould, but line the sides completely, an inch thick; leave it for a quarter of an hour ; when not quite cold take a clean, sharp knife, and pass it round between the rice and the mould; turn it carefully out; fill it half up with sweetmeat of any kind; then fill up with custard; whip up the white of one egg to a froth, and lay it on the top; sprinkle it with sugar, and salamander it. Have a very few pistachio nuts chopped fine; and sprinkle it on the edge of the rice, and against the sides. Coloured sugar—green or pink sugar—may be used if pistachio nuts are not at hand. This takes very little more trouble than a common pudding; if begun directly after breakfast, there is time for it to be finished for dinner. Instead of the sweet- meat, it may be filled up with apple prepared as at page 340. ■ •Cx DECEMBER.—DINNER FOR FOUR PERSONS. Haricot soup. Slices of codfish fried, anchovy sauce. Rabbit croquets.

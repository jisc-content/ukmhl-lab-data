MISCELLANEOUS EECEIPTS. 427 seeds; do the same with the apples; lay a slice of apple, sprinkle it with white sugar, then one of orange, and sprinkle it again; put a teaspoonful of brandy on each slice of the orange; and so on, alter- nate slices with sugar between each, and brandy only on the orange ; put one of the end pieces on the top: it may be decorated with bonbons, if for a small pai’ty. This has quite the flavour of pineapples. To MAKE Green Sugar and other Colours. Have a pound of quite young spinach, wash it very clean, dry it, put it in a moi’tar, and pound it with the juice of a lemon; put it in a sieve to drain: do not squeeze it, but let whatever will drain without touching fall into a plate; pound half a pound of fine loaf sugar, but not finely; pass it through a colander; drop the spinach-juice on it by degrees till all the sugar is coloured; lay it on sheets of white paper, in a w'arm place, but not near the fire, to dry; in three or four hours, or when quite dry, put it in a dry bottle and cork it tightly. Sugar may be done the same way, with w'ater coloui’ed from saucer pink. Yellow sugar is made the same way, with a pinch of hay saffi’on in a table- spoonful of Avater, strained, and some lemon-juice added to it.

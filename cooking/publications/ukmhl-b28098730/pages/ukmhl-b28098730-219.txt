199 DINNERS EOR EACH MONTH. Charteeuse de Feaises. (^Mould of Strawberries and Cream.') Cliarti’euse is made in a plain round mould like a pudding mould; it should be rather smaller than for a pudding. If the dinner is early in June, sti'aw- herries may be scarce; if so, half the quantity of what is commonly used may he made to serve thus:— Make for the jellies that day a pint more than they require; as soon as the jelly moulds are filled and put away, pom’ some of the pint into the moulds, which have been wetted: it is better for the jelly to be rather cool; move about the mould to let the jelly line the sides. The strawberries must have been nicely picked and each cut in two; place the strawberries with the cut sides outwards against the jelly at the bottom and all over the sides; take some more jeUy in a spoon, and let it fall upon the strawberries and as much between them as you can. Have the cream prepared as at page 124 : it had better be flavoured only with brandy; when the jelly is tolerably set, put in the cream, press it down evenly with a spoon, and let it cool; it must be put on ice for one hour before serving. See that the cream is rather sweeter than for other purposes, as the acidity of the strawberries will require it. When strawberries are plentiful, they need not be cut.

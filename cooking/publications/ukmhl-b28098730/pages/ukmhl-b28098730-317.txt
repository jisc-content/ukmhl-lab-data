297 DINNERS EOR EACH MONTH. Maqueeeau aux Geoseilles. Soles Feites. {Mackerel loith Gooseberry Sauce, ^c. Fried Soles.) Boil the mackerel iii a fish-kettle with a few pieces of fennel; four mackerel will he required for eight people. Make some melted butter of a quarter of a pound, as directed in Miscellaneous Receipts. Boil a quart of gooseberries till they are tender—the goose- berries must be not too young, as they ought to have an acid flavour; but they must not be turning ripe; rub the gooseberries through a sieve, add them to the butter with half a teaspoonful of white sugar, stir it to be quite smooth, and put in two table- spoonfuls of cream. Serve the sauce in a tm’een. A small tureen of fennel sauce had better be also sent up, as some people do not like gooseberries with fish; it is, however, quite an old English custom. The French invented the name, and still call gooseberries groseilles aux maquereaux, though they do not adopt the dish. Soles will be cut into fillets and fried; then placed round the mackerel, if the dish is to be set on the table. Shrimp sauce even more than any other requires perfectly well-made melted butter. In London, where shrimps are sent ready picked from the shells, there is no temptation to boil the heads in the sauce; it is done sometimes by country cooks, but it is a bad plan, spoiling it entirely.

GENERAL REMARKS ON 48 a lid that sinks an inch or rather more below the rim of the pan: this has a double purposeâ€”it forms a closer cover and leaves a sort of hollow dish, into which red-hot pieces of charcoal are placed, and re- newed from time to time as they get cool; the heat from the stove beneath being thus balanced by the heat above. It is worth while occasionally to take this trouble even for private dinners; but the char- coal is expensive, as well as the copper pans, which soon wear out: and there is another and greater objection, that the atmosphere of burning charcoal is injurious. Fortunately there is another method by which the same process may be managed. High and low in France have their p6t-au-feu, a glazed jar of brown coarse ware, from eight to ten inches high, rather wide in proportion to the height, with a lid of the same material: these, in poorer French houses, are filled with all sorts of scraps. We will consider that use of them in time; at present the p6t-au-feu presents itself only as a substitute for the braising pan. Some dishes which are larded may be better managed in the conveniently flat braising pan, on the charcoal stove; but everything may taste as good when done in the p6t-au-feu, if it is filled with the same materials. To make a fricandeau, for instance, there will be the bacon, and the stock, and all the rest of the ingredients, as well as the covering of white paper : as the lid of the glazed pot will fit less closely than that of a stewpan, it must be carefully tied down

Where there is a good restaurant within reach, as is the case always in London, a select entree or two may well be supplied from it; the cooks of those establish- ments will come to set them up, and they will serve as examples, and the plan will not be attended with any of the difficulties of those previously mentioned. Of course it must be a first-rate house to order from, as an entree vulgarly served up would be worse than no help at all.

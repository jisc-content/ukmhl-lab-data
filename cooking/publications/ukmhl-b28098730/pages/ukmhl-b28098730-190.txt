170 SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR Pigeons A la Pebigueux.—{Stewed Pigeons.) Take eight young pigeons, cut off the claws and ends of the wings; dress them nicely in a close shape. Place slices of bacon at the bottom of a stewpan, lay in the pigeons side by side, all with their breasts uppermost. Add one sliced carrot, one onion with a clove stuck in it, a teaspoonful of sugar and a very small bunch of herbs. Pour in half a pint of stock No. 1, cover the pigeons with some more bacon and a buttered paper; let them simmer gently for one hour. Just before serving make a sauce as follows: cut truffles into little dice rather larger than a pea; of these there must be a small teacupful; put them into a small pan with a quarter of a pound of butter, and simmer them for five minutes; add the stock from the pigeons, and if it makes more than half a pint boil it away to that quantity; add a teaspoonful of lemon juice, salt, cayenne and two tablespoonfuls of port, or white wine. Serve with the breasts uppermost, and lay a little glaze on each; pour the sauce into the dishes: this is for the two entrees, four pigeons in each dish. Galantine de Veau.—(^Galantine of Veal.) Have a fine breast of veal, take the meat from the bones, and trim the edges neatly all round. Have ready a sufflcient number of slices of best ham, fat and lean together, to cover the surface of the veal.

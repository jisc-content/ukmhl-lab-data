Take one hundred and fifty heads of asparagus, cut off the tops of twenty-five: they must be only the ends, and not longer than half an inch; boil the rest; cut off all the tender portions, and rub them through a tammy sieve; add only a litttle salt to season: warm two quarts of stock No. 2, rub two ounces of butter in two ounces of flour and add it to the stock; then mix in the asparagus pulp and a teaspoonful of white sugar ; boil it a quarter of an hour; stirring in gently a quarter of a pint of cream: the tops, boiled separately, must be throv/n in when serving. There must be nothing used to flavour it but the asparagus. Consomme a la Veemicelle. ( Clear Soup with Vermicelli.) Put into a stewpan three quarts of stock, about the same strength as stock No. 1; let it boil quickly an hour and a half, when it will be quite clear and reduced to two quarts; the lid must be set on one side the last half of the time. Boil a teacupful of raw vermicelli in clear stock, or water, put it in a sieve to drain, and add it to the soup the last thing before serving.

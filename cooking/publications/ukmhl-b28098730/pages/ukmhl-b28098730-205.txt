DESfNEES FOE EACH MONTH. 185 Fkicandeau DE Veau.—{Veal Fricandeau.') Have five pounds of the finest part of a fillet of veal; lay it with the outside or skin part uppermost; heat it well; trim it to a neat shape; keep the skin whole; lard it all over the top. Lay four slices of bacon fat on the bottom of a braising-pan, and the veal upon them ; put round the veal two onions with two cloves in one of them, two sliced carrots, a bunch of parsley and eschalots, a very small bunch of herbs, a little mace, half a teaspoonful of sugar; fill the pan, one-third as high as the veal, with stock No. 2, and fill up all spaces between the veal and the sides of the pan with pieces of fat of bacon; cover the top of the larding with buttered thick white paper; cover.the pan, and let it simmer very gently for four horn’s; see that the stock has not wasted too much, renew it if it has. Put on the cover, and lay charcoal on the top for about a quarter of an horn’; look at it from time to time, and when the tops of the larding begin to turn yellow, take it out. Serve it with sorrel sauce in the dish; put a little pale clear glaze on the top, dropping as little on the larding as pos- sible. If the colour is not yellow enough, it may be carefully salamandered. This fricandeau should be so tender as to be cut with ease; if it is soft and stringy, it must have been done too fast: it should be firm as well as short and tender.

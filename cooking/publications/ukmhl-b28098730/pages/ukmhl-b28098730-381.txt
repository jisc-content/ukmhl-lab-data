'^Vhen cold, beat the yelks of six eggs a qua^â€™ter of an hour; strain them with the cream, set it on the fire, and stir with a silver spoon till it thickens; put this to cool whilst you whip up a pint of cream; sweeten the cream with sufifar Avhich has been nibbed on a lemon, and add to it one tablespoonful of brandy; as the froth rises, take it off in a spoon, and lay it on a dish, and leave it to become a little firm. This being done, cover the cake with raspbeny jam; pour over it the custard, and pile up the froth of cream as high as possible; some pink sugar and green sugar may be placed on the top, according to fancy. This is a very old-fashioned dish, but so good that it is a pity to let it become obsolete: it is, besides, so simple to make that there is no chance of failure.

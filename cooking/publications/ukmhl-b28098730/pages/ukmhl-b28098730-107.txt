KITCHEN APPAEATUS AND UTENSILS. 87 appearance of London architecture; as any oiae who will try the experiment will find what a large expen- diture of coals is saved. The above plan is not so applicable to the low- form of grates as to those of an older fashion; but the same principle may he proceeded on in the way of feeding fires. A clever friend amused him- self one winter with trying experiments, and found great success in ordering his servants to add fresh, coals at each side of the grate alternately, in small quantities. The last fed side became shortly a higher, hotter heap, which he called his wick; then the lowmr side was supplied, and the wick kindled that immediately info a bright flame, which blazed cheer- fully by the side of the wick, till it became the hottest and thereby wdck in turn. There was very little smoke emitted in this manner. One code of fire-mending duty can at least be enacted in every house, and servants may be made to observe it: that is, to mend the fire every half-hour, tlrrowing on a very small quantity each time, and choosing the hottest place; and above all, never to stir the fire, which is the sure destruction of the useful wick, and makes a fierce fire one hour and a low one the next. If people would take the tiâ€™ciible to observe all this, there would be always a bright fire and very little smoke. But it is time that we finish this digression and return to the kitchen.

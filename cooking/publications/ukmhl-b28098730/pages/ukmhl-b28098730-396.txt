376 DINNEES FOE ONE OE TWO GUESTS. least might prompt us to abandon our foreign descrij>- tions—the fear of being as little correct in the use of them as some French cookery hooks are Avhich con- tain “ Missies Plies ” for mince pies, and “ Maclie potetesse ” for mashed potatoes. It Avill be convenient to prelude the dinners for four persons with a feAV words about soups. Whenever it is known the day before that soup for two addi- tional persons Avill be wanted, the obvious duty will be to order materials in proportion to the quantity of stock that Avill be required; about tlmee or four pints will be sufficient to boil away for clear soup, and leave a little for any entree that may be ordered ; but it often happens that dinners so small are only ordered in the morning, and to risk an unfinished soup for the entertainment of even the most intimate acquaintance Avould be imprudent. I eceipls is nearly identical vvi th an invention of M. Soyer, named by him Eritadella, or Eamifolle: the latter will be given slightly altered in the next dinner for January, The Leipsig manuscript, which is supposed to have been com- piled by the cook of the community, gives no very severe idea of a monastic table; one extract may serve as an example:— “ Young Fowls in Almond Sauce. “ Do you wish to send up young fowls in almond soup, take toasted bread, cut off the crust and burnt part, and lay it in a dish, and stew it ivith small raisins. Pound almonds with good wine, and let it stew; season it Avith cinnamon. Lay the boiled fowls on the toast, and pour over them the wine and almond soup; streAv the top over with cinnamon. This is much used in towns and castles, as Hans Bomnitz reports.” The receipts for fast-days are quite as luxurious, but there are not many of them.

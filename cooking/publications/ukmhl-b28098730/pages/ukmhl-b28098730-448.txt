C.1EE FOR Charlottes, Gateaux d’Oranges, etc. Have one pound of Brown and Poison’s corn flour, one pound and a quarter of white sugar powdered and sifted, one pound and a quarter of butter, and six eggs; beat the whites of the eggs to a froth, then mix them all, in the following succes- sion, in a large bowl, beating with a spoon all the time: first the butter, wdiich must be beaten alone to a cream, then add the sugai’, then the yellcs of eggs, then the flour, lastly, the wdiites of eggs in froth; flavour with lemon or vanilla, and whip it for two hours with a whisk ; butter the inside of the moulds, and cover the outsides of them with paper. Bake it two hours in a slow oven; it must be a verj^ light brown. It i§ important not to omit the outside paper, which protects the sides from scorching. This is a very nice cake for . tea, dessert, or luncheon. When the coni flour cannot be had, common flour will do, but not nearly so well; espe- cially for a Charlotte russe, where the advantage of a corn flour cake is that it can be cut so easily. If common flour is used there must be two more eggs. This is the quantity for two Charlottes russes. The moulds to be used for them are plain, round, and five or six inches high.

344 SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR Tomato Soup. This soup may be made of the fleshy part of the ox-cheek, or of any good part of the meat. It will require for two quarts of soup only one pound of meat, besides the stock No. 1, which will be in readiness. Put the pound of beef or ox-cheek into a stewpan with a piece of bacon under it, three carrots, two onions stuck with cloves, one turnip, a head of celery, a little allspice, pepper, and salt, a teaspoonful of sugar, and a small bunch of sweet herbs; add half a pint of stock No. 1; let it be covered, and place it on a rather hot place on the stove for five minutes; then place it on a moderate one, and let it simmer for an hour and a half; take out the beef, and cut it up with a sharp knife into pieces rather smaller than a nut; take out the vegetables, and strain the stock; put it into the stewpan with the pieces of meat, and let it simmer another half-hour. Cut the vegetables into neat pieces; then put nearly two quarts of stock No. 1 into another stewpan; add the meat with its stock and the vegetables; thicken it very slightly by one tablespoonful of flour in one ounce of butter; let'it boil for a quarter of an hour. Boil separately in water twelve fine ripe tomatos; set them on a sieve to drain; then with a spoon take out all the pulp, leaving the skins quite dry; pass the pulp through a tammy, and add it to the soup just before serving, with one teaspoonful of lemon-juice and a little cayenne.

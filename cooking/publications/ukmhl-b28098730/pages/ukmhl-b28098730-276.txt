256 SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR Bake it very lightly, and see that it does not get a high colour. Then make some quenelles made of veal or chicken, as at page 116, and boil them; also have a quarter of a pound of cock’s-combs, well blanched, a quarter of a pound of young, very white, button mushrooms, well washed and soaked, and a teacupful of truffles cut the size of nuts. Put the cock’s-comhs into a small stewpan with a pint of stock No. 2. Let them sim- mer till the cock’s-comhs are quite tender and the stock reduced to half a pint; then add a teaspoon- ful of flour rubbed into two ounces of butter, and a little cayenne and salt. Put in the mush- rooms and the truffles and simmer for flve minutes; then stir in a teacupful of cream, boiled and hot, stir gently and add the quenelles last: they must be cut into square pieces, an inch each way. Leave this in the bain-marie till serving time, then pour the sauce with its contents into the middle of the paste. This is an excellent dish and not difficult to make if the above directions are adhered to; but it is at the present time rather gone out of fashion for fine dinners : something rather lighter is preferred for the first entree, therefore any of the croquettes or rissoles may be substituted, if thought proper. This vol au vent might be made good without the truffles.

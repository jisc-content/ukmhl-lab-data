DINNERS EOR EACH MONTH. 349 put crumb of bread to fit the spaces between the bars; bake it a very light colour in a rather quick oven for about three quarters of an hour; cover it whilst baking with a buttered paper if there seems any fear of its turnmg yellow; take it from the oven; remove the bread, and if the spaces are at all filled up with the rising of the pastry, cut the pastry away with a sharp knife. The fruit must be ready pre- pared as follows: have some nice coloured apricots; peel them, and remove the stones; cut them in half; also eight greengages, or ten if small; peel them; take out the stones, and leave them whole; and do the same with six or eight red plums, according to the size : wine-sour plums, if they are to be had, are the proper fruit. Set all three in separate small stew- pans, with a teaspoonful of water each, and two tablespoonfuls of sifted sugar; let them simmer five minutes very gently, take them out of their syrup, put them in separate basins, and add to the syrups in the stewpans three tablespoonfuls more of sugar to each of the plums, and two to the apricots; boil the syrups for five mmutes; pour each syrup on to its own fruit; let them stay till nearly cold; then put the fruit one sort into each division of the tart as you withdraw it from the oven. Break the stones, blanch the kernels, and put them on their own fruit, and serve. This tart, which is very pretty, may be made with preserves, when, after putting it into the tart, it must be replaced in the oven for three minutes.

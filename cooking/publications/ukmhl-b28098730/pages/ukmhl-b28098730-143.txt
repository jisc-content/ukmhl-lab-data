RESLtEKS.—In winter, as well as summer, this quantity of isinglass will require to he set on ice for one hour, but only for that time, and not till the jelly is set. To apply ice whilst the jelly is hot destroys the glutinous property; and it can then never set properly, nor be made to hold together, except by freezing strongly, which impairs the flavour: if cooks understood this, they would be saved many disasters. Great care must be taken of the jelly-bags ; they must be wrapped up carefully in paper, and then tied in a cover, and be dipped in boiling water before using. Gateaux d’Oeanges.—{Orange Cakes.) The two cakes must be made the day before of one pound of corn-flour (see cake for Charlottes, in Mis- cellaneous Receipts). Take the rinds off sixteen oranges; remove all the white, and pull the divisions asunder separately; dissolve one pound and a half of sugar, having first put a tahlespoonful of orange-juice into the pan; boil the sugar to a clear syrup, and pour it hot upon the pieces of orange; let it stand to cool, then take the sjnrup from the orange, and boil it with one pound of orange marmalade; when cool, stir in a wineglass of brandy (or maraschino). Fill the cakes with the oranges, and place some in a neat pattern on the tops ; fill up with the syrup, and pour some over the sides and in the dishes.

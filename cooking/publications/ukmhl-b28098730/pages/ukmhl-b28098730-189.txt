DINNERS FOR EACH MONTH. 169 Petits Pates A la BouRaEOiSE.â€”{Small Pdtis.') Prepare some puff paste as at page 115. Prepare for the contents of the pates as follows. Have half a pound of best pork sausages (if they are not at handj mince up boiled bacon fat); soalc the crumb of two French rolls in stock Ho. 1, and add some salt and pepper, and a very little nutmeg; add a table- spoonful of chopped truffles; put it in a stewpan with a tablespoonful of stock, and one of good glaze, a tablespoonful of cream, and the yelk of one egg; simmer it for five minutes, stirring carefully; set it on a plate to get cold. When the paste has been left long enough to be cold, roll it out very thin, but not so thin as to endanger its breaking; then cut it with a cutter into rounds two inches across, and lay a piece of the pre- pared meat the size of a walnut in the middle of each; damp the edges of the paste and lay another round on the top, press it on, leaving the middle of the top nicely raised. Put yelk of egg on the middle, and set the patds in a moderate oven: they must be baked the last thing before serving, and they require extreme care in watching whilst in the oven, as they may be spoiled in one minute; they must look a very pale colour and the egged part a bright yellow.

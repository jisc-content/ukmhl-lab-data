DINNERS FOR ONE OR TWO GUESTS. 395 it on the cherries, and repeat the same three times, then leave the cherries in the syrup till wanted. Whip up half a pint of cream with sugar and brandy, or any flavour you may choose; let it stand on a sieve, in a cool place, to get a little Arm, or on ice: place the half meringue shells, like little saucers, in a circle, touching each other; put the cherries into them carefully, without the syrup, after having let them drain a few moments; pile up the cherries in meringue shells, making a pyramid with a single cherry at the top; then carefully, with a spoon, lay the cream in the centre of the dish, where the meringues leave a space: make it as high a heap as you can. Tliis may be done with any small fruit; strawberries or raspberries look even prettier than cherries. It is a German idea, and not common here: it must not be dished up till just when wanted, and care must be taken not to let the syrup get into the meringues, as they would be liable to melt with too much moisture. Meringue shells will keep for months in a tin case, so that in the country, by having them ready, a pretty entremet may be always at hand. JULY.â€”DINNER FOR FOUR PERSONS. Julienne soup.

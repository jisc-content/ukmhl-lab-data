Remarks.—Nothing is so often badly made as lobster rissoles. The chief of faults is to pound them, the consecLuence of which is to produce a close clinging substance like sponge, as disagreeable to eat as it is indigestible. The next fault is to put in anchovy sauce, and, still worse, nutmeg; both spoiling the peculiar flavour of the lobster. The covering of paste is recommended here, because it is an easier plan than merely covering with egg and bread crumbs; the last is more correct, but as the mass will not hold to- gether so well as if made with isinglass or glaze, it is difficult to keep the rissoles in shape. Since a few trifling breaks in the paste will not be of so much consequence in these as in croquettes, more attention may be devoted to the thinness of it than to the fear of little holes. i Ris DE Veau aux Pointes ©’Aspeeres. {Lambs’ Sweetbreads with Asparagus.^ One entree will require six lambs’ sweetbreads; or three calves’ throat sweetbreads will do.

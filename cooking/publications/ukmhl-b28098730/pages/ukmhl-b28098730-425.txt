Make the sauce as follows:—have half a poiuid of white young mushrooms, peel them, cut the stalks, and wash them in several waters; dry them on a sieve; mince them small; put them into a small stewpan, with two ounces of butter beaten to a cream ; simmer it gently for ten minutes, stirring all the while; add a teaspoonful of flour rubbed into some butter, and a teacupful of the stock from the rabbit; simmer it all gently for a quarter of an hour, and rub it through a sieve; add a teacupful of cream, and pour it quite hot over the rabbit. ■ This is intended as a substitute for the partridges, if convenient; in that case, it will precede the stewed beef-steak.

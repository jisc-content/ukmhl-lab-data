112 SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS EOR is to be served, throw in the vegetables, and let it simmer five minutes. To prepare the Vegetables. Cut carrots and turnips into small pieces shaped alike, enough to fill a teacup; set them in cold water with a pinch of salt for half an hour; boil them till quite tender in a little stock No. 1, and dry them; put some butter into a saucepan, place it on the stove, and beat it whilst it melts; add a pinch of salt, a teaspoonful of brown sugar, and a teaspoonful of glaze; boil it five minutes, beating all the time; put in the vegetables and boil for another five minutes, this time stirring gently; take out a few pieces, lay them on a plate; if the butter dries quickly, making a clear glazed covering, they are finished; if not, boil and stir again. Take them out and keep them on a plate in a warm place till wanted. N.B.—This preparation of the vegetables can be done at any time in the afternoon. Remarks—This soup should be the colour of barley-sugar, and quite clear. Cooks have many inventions for clearing, such as adding cold water, eggs, isinglass, and the carcases of chickens, or straining through a jelly-bag. All these plans spoil it, and some are wasteful. Boiling at a high temperature for a long time is sufficient to make it brilliant, and no other means should be resorted to. The most common fault is an acrid, raw taste, which, proceed- ing from the vegetables, pervades the whole: this acrid taste can only be avoided by the glazing process; and it will possibly be necessary to insist upon its being done, as many professed cooks avoid the trouble under the pretence that it is not neces- sary ; but it makes just all the difference between a delicate and a common soup.

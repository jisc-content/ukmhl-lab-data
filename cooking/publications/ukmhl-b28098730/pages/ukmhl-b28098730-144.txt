124 SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR Ceeme a la Vanille.â€”{Vanilla Cream.) Boil a stick of vanilla in a teacupful of milk for ten minutes, stirring well all the time; when the milk is reduced to nearly one-half, pour it, boil- ing, into a cup containing two ounces of shredded isinglass; strain the milk, and cool it without letting it quite set; add it in a bowl to a pound of pounded sugar and three pints of double cream, and two wineglassfuls of best pale brandy: whip the cream till it seems a sponge; mix, and let it stand an hour and a half before filling the moulds; dip the moulds first in cold water; place the moulds on ice an hour before turning out. No exact time can be stated for the whipping, as it depends upon the nature of the cream and tem- perature ; but care must be taken not to go on too long, as it may turn to butter: sometimes ten minutes are sufficient, or it will take from that time to half an hour. If vanilla in sticks cannot be had, put in some essence of vanilla; it is impossible to say how much, as the essence differs so much in strength: about a teaspoonful should be abundant for the two moulds. If any quantity of stick vanilla is bought, it must be kept carefully in leaden paper, as it loses its perfume very rapidly.

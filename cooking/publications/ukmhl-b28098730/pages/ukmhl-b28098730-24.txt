INTRODUCTOEY. 4 reappearing; and a greasy haricot, or a very tough stewed beef-steak, in succession, is scarcely calculated to brighten the brow of conjugal discontent: minced veal fit for the nursery, or mutton-chops requiring the digestion of a ploughhoy, following in their turn, are ahke unwelcome. These, perhaps, are the unfor- tunate results of a perplexing consultation which has been hut a dreary prelude to the day’s enjoyment. But something more elaborate may be aimed at: the cook refers to her “ company ” repertoire, and provides a choicer kind of material; hut she has no charcoal stove ready; and, for want of management, there is no good “ stock,” nor any of those various little essentials which are at hand on great occasions; so the solitary entree resembles very faintly -what her skill might, perhaps, produce when getting up a finished dinner. Thus the hope of delicate and pleasing fare becomes gradually fainter, until, in most cases, the attempt to provide agreeable variations to perpetual roast and boiled is finally abandoned as a hopeless effort; and the coarse food of heavy joints is accepted, with the consolatory reflection that, after all, it is well cooked and wholesome. This conclusion will not, however, bear examination; for, although plain roast and boiled meat may be more wholesome than badly done stews or stale rechauffes, yet it is neither more nourishing, nor more likely to suit a delicate digestion, than lighter dishes, provided the latter are skilfully prepared.

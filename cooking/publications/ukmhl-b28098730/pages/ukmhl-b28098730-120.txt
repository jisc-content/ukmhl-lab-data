100 GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR As all that we are now occupied withj is not meant to regulate the proceedings of any experienced woman who has been thoroughly educated, or who has found out the best routine for herself, but is intended to lead on an intelligent young person till she becomes equal to all your particular require- ments, it may be in place here to say a few words about the amount of help which is necessary, and will not be too much when a dinner is to be cooked. It need hardly be observed that the help of a professed cook is not intended, as in that case all this advice would be superfluous; but some assist- ance must be afforded. There Is a good rule to be observed, never to permit more than is actually I ... needed: a crowd in the kitchen is certain to consist of hinderers. Nothing can be depended on to issue from it successfully if one person is to meddle with this piece of work, and another with that, whilst the cook, distracted with confusion, is able neither to gain experience nor to progress towards establishing me- thodical habits. Two assistants will be sufficient for the dinner, which now occupies oui attention. An industrious kitchen-maid, or rather scullery-maid, will be occupied the whole of both days in cleaning and handing various utensils. Another person must not only wait continually on the cook during the dinner-day, but she will be wanted on the pre- vious one also, to do a hundred subordinate things as directed.

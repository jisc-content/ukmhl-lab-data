372 DINNERS FOR ONE OR TWO GUESTS. the cook used to pass glibly over the first course: soup, or fish, or both would be ordered to occupy their usual places on the table, and remain whilst dinner should be announced j not at all to the im- provement of either, but to the satisfactory solution of the standing difficulty as to the appearance of the table: it was when the debate turned on the chief course that the perplexity began. The cook would naturally insist upon a joint, and the mistress would suffo’est some nice side-dish in addition: four people only to be fed—what more could they want? But that was not the question: the table must be covered; there must positively be a top dish—what lady ever sat at the head of her table without a dish before her ? And then the proposed side-dish must be matched; perhaps a modest innovation might be insinuated: set the entree at the top, and let vegetables do duty at the sides. Impossible ! the notion has its merits, but is decidedly a shabby one; so at last the joint was ordered, and had to be supported in established form by three dishes, two of which at least would be des- tined to retire again untouched. We need not refer to the aggravated repetition of these difficulties in the matter of the second course, nor describe the tedious ceremony dmfing dinner; but one gone-by disadvan- tage may be noticed: the cook might have been depended on to do one or two things nicely, but in a hurry could hardly be expected to get through so many with success.

When the fire is lighted^ of course beginning with the paper, it will he found, hy the time the sticks have been consumed, that the cinders above will have become a glowing crust. There will then he a hollow where the sticks have been, and the coals below will have a flaming surface. A few coals must then be introduced below the crust of cinders every quarter of an hour; a flat shovel, if the bars are tolerably open, will answer for that purpose. It will he found that many hours will elapse before the upper crust will give way, and that very little, if any, smoke will go uj) the chimney. The reason of this is easily explained: wdien heat is applied beneath fresh coals, or coals are thrown upon a fire (which comes to the same thing), there is not sufficient heat to produce perfect combustion; a great proportion of the coal escapes in the form of smoke, and is carried up the chimney by the draught; but by establishing a heated upper crust of glowing cinders, the smoke from the coals beneath is consumed in passing through the crust, to which crust it affords fuel to keep it in a glowing state. In this manner every particle of coal is utilized, whilst in the common way a very large proportion is wasted, or, still worse, sent abroad to be deposited on everything that we care to preserve in beauty. A considerable economy will obviously be the reward of such patriotic care for the

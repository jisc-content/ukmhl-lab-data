GENEKAL KEMAEKS. 368 of tlie requisite stocks, I should fear that the pro- posal for you to place even this limited number of receipts hr the hands of your yet partially accom- plished artist would be highly injudicious ; but you will observe that to begin with those stocks ready produced, or at least thoroughly understood, shortens every receipt one half, and leaves leisure for the remaining directions to be easily followed. By this plan, every new receipt that is worked out will be found in a manner explanatory of those which have gone before, and appear like a repetition of an old lesson with certain variations; the old arid the new being illustrative of one another. As, in both these sets of dinners, you may like to make some variations, by way of rendering it easy to choose other dishes that may not spoil the arrange- ment of the carte, a list is here made out, with all the component parts classed. Whatever may not be approved of in any dinner has only to be sought for in the list, and anything else included in the same bracket may be adopted without further considera- tion. It is hoped that this plan may save both time and trouble.

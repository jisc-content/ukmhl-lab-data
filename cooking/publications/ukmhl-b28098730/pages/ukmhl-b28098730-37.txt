17 ON COOKS AND COOiaNG. rlence, that you date neither from Grosvenor Square nor from Carlton House Terrace. I piâ€™esume, more- over, that the man whom you have lately made happy is not, as yet at least, in the enjoyment of that comfortable state of the exchequer which would supply a housekeeper with her fifty or sixty pounds a year wages, her perquisites from your larder and her percentage from your tradesmen; for such a person- age, were she in your service, ought not to require, and, if she did require, would not accept, criticism from either you or me. Having, then, assumed what is not the extent of your finances, I may, without prying impertinently into the secrets of your income, conclude that it ranges somewhere between one and two thousand a year, or that it may even fall some- thing below the smaller sum. You wonder that I define thus minutely your pecuniary circumstances ; but it is done to indicate the sort of income of those whom I conceive to be most likely to require counsel in their household difficulties, and to show that I am willing not to discourage any one who may glance over these pages, from attempting with the more modest of the sums just named to preside over a lady-like establishment. It often happens that young wives who have been used to large expenditure, contrast the narrow means of their husbands with the large income of their parents, and at once abandon in despair all ideas of aiming at refinement in their household and the table. 2

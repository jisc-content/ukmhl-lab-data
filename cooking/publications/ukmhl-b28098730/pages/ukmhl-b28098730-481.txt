There are three colours called primitive colours— red, blue, and yellow; if you take any one of these three, and mix together the remaining two, you produce a harmonious contrast: or, as it is called, a complementary coloui’, because the mixed colour would make up with the primary the complement or whole of the three primitive colours. Thus, green, being composed of blue and yellow, is the comple- ment of red; orange, being composed of red and yellow, is the complement of blue; and purple, being composed of red and blue, is the complement of yellow. You have only to think of what two colours green, orange, and purple are made, and you know that the remaining primary colour is its complement or contrast; the primary and the com- pound of the two remaining, are said to be comple- mentary to each other. Now it is known, not only by experiment but by a course of reasoning very easily to be understood, but which it would detain me too long to explain, that when two colours complementary to each other are placed side by side, the impression on the eye of the intensity of both is heightened; therefore it is easy to perceive that, if you want colours to look brilliant, you must place them in contrast, a primary near its complementary; and if you wish them to

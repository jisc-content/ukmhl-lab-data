287 DINNEKS FOR EACH MONTH. Gelee de Pommes a la Ceeue. {Apple Jelly with Cream.) Put half a pint of cold water into a stewpaii, and put into it six fine apples, which are known to boil clear, sliced without peel or core; simmer it till the apple is well broken down, then strain it through a fine tammy, and add four omices of powdered sugar. Pare eight more middling-sized apples, and take out the cores; pour the syrup just made upon them; simmer them till they are broken, and let them stand to get cold; then put them into a stewpan, with the rind and juice of a lemon, the white of four eggs beaten to a froth, and one ounce of isinglass; add to this the shells of the eggs, and let it simmer for a quarter of an hour; then pass it througk a thick tammy; put it in a circular mould with a hollow in the middle; and set it on ice for an hour before turning out. Make some cream as if for meringues, flavour it with a glass of brandy or some liqueur, and fill the centre of the jelly. Vanilla or pineapple will not do to flavour the cream, not being sufficiently decided in taste to suit the apples. Ramaquins.â€”(5'ee page 275.)

XXX111. when breakfast should be prepared, and thus prevent the waste so often caused by the boiling up and away of the kettle, two and sometimes three, times before wanted. ANOTHER distinct advantage gained by the Loose Boiling Burners, is the opportunity afforded for taking away, and locking up, any number of the Boiling Burners which may not be needed, but which the Mistress finds, are being used unnecessarily. This is a simple and certain method of curing extravagance. We do not hear so much of the waste of Coal, Provisions, etc., by servants, because the waste is difficult to trace—these articles being used in other parts of the house and by other inmates ; but let anyone compare the absolute cost of cooking by Gas against Coal, and it will be found that with Gas at, say 3s. 6d. per thousand, and coal at 17s. 6d. per ton, to be 50 per cent, cheaper. This is attained by a Stove being turned out when finished with, whereas a coal range has to be kept burning ready for use. Price for price, Gas at 7s. per thousand and coal at 17s. 6d. per ton are equal. COLLIERS’ STRIKES have also to be reckoned with. The difficulty in obtaining supplies of coal fuel, and the exorbitant advances frequently made during these regrettable strikes, render the use of Gas as a fuel the more reliable and economical. Large stocks of coal are kept at all Gas Works, which prevent any failure of Gas supply. This is but one side of the question : we have not yet touched upon the SAVING OF MEAT, CLEANLINESS, WEAR AND TEAR OF FURNITURE, &c. It was stated by Mr. R. E. Crompton in a paper, read before the Society of Arts, that by using Gas for all purposes in a house, cooking and heating, the total saving under all heads in a house with a rent of L‘40 a year, would be nearly or quite MO a year—an equivalent to "the rent.—(See Gas Journal May 29th, 1888, p. 959.)

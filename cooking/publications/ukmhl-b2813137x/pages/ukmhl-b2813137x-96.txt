70 No. 168. VENISON. Haunch of Venison. The fat of the haunch should be covered with greased paper, and over that place a cold water paste about half-an- inch in thickness. Then cover the haunch with well greased paper. Roast the haunch, and about 30 minutes before serving remove the paste and paper, dredge it over with flour and return in to the oven to brown nicely. Allow quite 20 minutes to the lb., and if it be a very large haunch it will take nearly five hours to cook. Serve it with brown gravy and red currant jelly. No. 169. Neck, Breast, and Shoulder of Venison. Cook and serve as directed in foregoing recipe.

Soak the moss in cold water for ten or twelve hours, change the water several times to take away any unpleasant taste, then drain the moss and pick away any impurities or discoloured pieces. Put it into a small saucepan with a pint of milk ; let it come to the boil, then simmer it for a quarter of an hour till the moss is quite dissolved in the milk, stirring it all the time. Sweeten it to your taste. This moss may be eaten hot, or it may be put into a mould (which has previously been wetted with cold water) and turned out when it is cold. If you wish to flavour the moss, you may boil a piece of lemon rind with it, which should be taken out when you take the moss off' the gas.

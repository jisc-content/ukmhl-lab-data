175 ICES. RULES FOR ICES. Too much sugar will cause the ices not to freeze properly. Too little sugar will cause them to become hard and rocky. If ices are to be moulded freeze them in the freezer until they are of the consistency of thick batter. If served unmoulded, freeze them drier and firmer. Rough ice and salt form a freezing mixture. Allow |lb. of salt to 1 lb. of ice. Dip ices into cold water to turn them out. When dishing ices, place a serviette upon the dish, as that will not conduct the heat to them so quickly as the dish alone would. No. 423. COFFEE ICE. INGREDIENTS. \ oiks of 8 eggs | ^ lb.

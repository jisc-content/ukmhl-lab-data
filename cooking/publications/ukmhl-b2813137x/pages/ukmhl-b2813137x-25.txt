A good white stock may be made by using bones and no meat; a ham bone with the others flavours this stock nicely. No. 32. SECOND STOCK. Use any scraps of cooked or uncooked meat with any bones. Allow one quart of water to every pound of meat and bones, and use vegetables in the same proportion as for first stock. Boil the meat and bones gently for one hour, then put in the vegetables and boil for four-and-a-half to five hours longer ; strain; bones may be put on again with fresh stock material, as they require long boiling to extract all the gelatine ; when cold, second stock should be a strong jelly. To flavour the stock more fully, the vegetables should be fried in a little dripping before they are added to the meat. No. 33. FISH STOCK. INGREDIENTS. 4 lbs. of fish, or fish bones and trimmings 4 quarts of water 2 carrots 2 turnips 2 onions Half a head of celery 1 sprig of parsley, thyme, and a bay leaf 1 doz. peppercorns 3 cloves A little salt METHOD. Put the fish, or fish bones, into a saucepan with the water and a little salt, and boil gently for half an hour. Then put in the vegetables, well cleansed and cut up, the herbs, peppercorns, &c., and boil gently for to 5 hours. Strain.

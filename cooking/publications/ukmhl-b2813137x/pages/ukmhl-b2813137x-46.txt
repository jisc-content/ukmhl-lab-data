No. 70. FRIED FISH. Fish for frying must be carefully prepared, well cleaned, washed, dried, and cut into conveniently sized pieces; dip into batter, Hour, or oatmeal, or brush over with egg and roll in fine bread crumbs. Put at least 3 or 4 oz. of lard or dripping into a saucepan, and when hot enough put in the fish and fry a golden brown, first one side and then the other. Drain on soft paper, which readily absorbs the grease. Put the white side of the fish downwards and brown it first, then the dark side. It is a good plan to have a deep pan which will hold sufficient fat to cover the article cooked. When cool the fat must be strained. It may be used for the same purpose many times. No. 71.

Place in a mould or dish some Preserved or Baked Fruit, well sweetened, and pour the above preparation over it while hot. Let it stand until quite set, and turn out into a glass dish. Additional Richness.—By gradually stirring into rather less than a pint of milk four dessertspoonsful of Milkmaid Brand Condensed Milk, and perfectly mixing it before it is used, Blanc-Mange almost equal in richness to that made with cream may be produced at the most trifling cost. When thus prepared, only three or four lumps of sugar should be used instead of 2 ozs. If Unsweetened Condensed Milk is used, then the 2 ozs. of sugar must be added.

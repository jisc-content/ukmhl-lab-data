INGREDIENTS. £ lb. flaky or short pastry | 1 egg, beaten J lb. sausage meat or sausages j METHOD. Cut the pastry into six squares, place half of a sausage upon one end of a square, wet the edge of the pastry, roll over carefully, leaving the ends open, and mark across the top three or four times with the back of a knife. Brush over with beaten egg. Place the rolls upon a baking sheet and bake in a quick oven for about twenty minutes. To remove the skins from the sausages, place them in a basin of cold water, cut the skin at one end, take hold of the sausage at the opposite end, and work the meat out at the opening. The meat comes out very easily, leaving the skins quite clean. This method does not destroy the flavour so much as parboiling them to remove the skins. No. 314.

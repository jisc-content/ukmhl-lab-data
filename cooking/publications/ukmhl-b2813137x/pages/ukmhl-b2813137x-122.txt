INGREDIENTS. 2 raw yolks of eggs, perfectly | 2 tablespoonsful of taragon, freed from the germs j French, or plain vinegar ^ pint of best salad oil Pepper and salt METHOD. Put the yokes into a basin with a little salt, and stir them quickly with a whisk, or wooden spoon, dropping the oil on them drop by drop, until the sauce is as thick as butter in the warm weather, then add the vinegar and remainder of seasoning. Note.—Success in making this sauce will depend on adding the oil very gradually to the yolks. It should also be made in a very cool place to prevent the sauce curdling. If this does occur, put a yoke in another basin and pour the curdled sauce slowly on it. This will bring it smooth again. When the sauce is made it is well to mix a tablespoonful of warm water with it ; this will effectually prevent it curdling. This sauce, when properly made, should be of the con- sistency of very thick cream. When it is intended for coating cold entrees, Ac., mix with it, before using, half a gill of liquid, but quite cold, aspic jelly. Note.—Some people mix oil and vinegar together in making this sauce, using a teaspoonful of vinegar to every seven of oil ; but I think the plan mentioned in this recipe is the best.

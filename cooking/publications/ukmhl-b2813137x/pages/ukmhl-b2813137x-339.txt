Xlll. CHAMPIONS VINEGAR Is made in the old-fashioned way, and thus contains all the delicate aromas and pleasant flavours inherent to well=made vinegar. It is brewed in an open mash tun, entirely and exclusively from Malted Barley, at their Vinegar Ground, City Road, London, E.C., and COMMANDS A PREFERENCE OVER ALL OTHER. For Culinary purposes care should be taken that the Vinegar used is bright and brilliant and in perfect condition. CHAMPIONâ€™S BOTTLED VINEGAR IS ALWAYS SO.

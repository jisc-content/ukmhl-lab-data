85 No. 212. ROAST HARE. Skin and draw the hare, and wipe the inside thoroughly with a damp cloth. Remove the eyes, and skin the ears and tail carefully. Cut oft' the feet at the first joint, and cut the sinews under the second joint. Fill the body with veal forcemeat and sew it up. Truss the hare “in a sitting position,” by pulling the shoulders backwards and the legs forward, then pass a skewer through the leg and shoulder, right through the centre of the body, and out upon the other side through the other leg and shoulder. The head should be fastened with a skewer between the shoulders. Place a piece of fat bacon over the back of the hare, and baste it well with milk. Roast it from 1 to 1| hours. Make one pint of good brown gravy and add to it a glass of port. Garnish with small fried forcemeat balls, and hand red currant jelly with it. Liver sauce is much liked with hare. No. 213 LEVERETS. Roast and serve like hare.

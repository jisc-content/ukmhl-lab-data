Boil two ounces of vermicelli in three-quarters of a pint of milk until quite tender. Mix in one ounce of butter, a teaspoonful of French mustard, two ounces of grated cheese (Parmesan is the best), cayenne, season to taste. When the mixture has become quite cold, roll it out on a board (using a few bread crumbs) about half an inch thick ; cut into small crescents and any fancy shapes. Dip them into egg and then into crushed vermicelli ; fry a pretty golden colour in hot fat. Dish in a circle. This makes a very pretty savoury.

This sauce is very good indeed for Christmas puddings. 112 little sherry. The sherry must be very carefully added or it will curdle the sauce. Sometimes only one tablespoonful of sherry will be necessary. It must at once be poured into the tureen in which it is to be served, and put away in a cool place until required. If disturbed after it has ouce been put into the dish, it will crumble and be quite spoiled.

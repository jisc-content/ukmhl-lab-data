31 No. 68. TO BOIL FISH. All white fish should be put into water nearly boiling, and as the water boils remove the scum. To every two quarts of water allow a dessert spoonful of salt and a table spoonful of vinegar. The vinegar makes the fish firmer and whiter. See that the fish is fresh, remove the scales, take out the inside and the eyes, and cut off" the fins. Wash it well, but do not soak it; place it on a drainer and place the drainer in the boiling water. Cook gently. Average time for boiling fish, 7 minutes to the lb., and a little longer if a very thick piece. No. 69. TO STEAM FISH. Wash the fish well, place in a steamer over a saucepan of boiling water, keep the lid on, and steam 10 minutes to the lb., according to the thickness and size of the fish. Steamed food is far preferable to boiled, as it does not lose so much of its goodness; it takes rather longer to cook.

76 No. 185. BEETROOT. Wash the roots well, being careful not to scrape them. Put them into quickly boiling water and cook them from one to two hours, according to their age and size. Rub off the skin when cooked, and cut into thin slices. Beetroot may be served with vinegar poured over or mixed with other salad. It retains its flavour much better if baked in a slow oven. No. 186. CARROTS Should be thoroughly scraped, cut lengthways, put into boiling water, with salt, and boiled gently until tender. Old carrots will take about an hour, new ones about 20 minutes. They may be mashed with a little butter, pepper, and salt, or, nicely drained and served with white or parsley sauce poured over. No. 187. TURNIPS Are about the only vegetable which should be thickly pared, the outside part being woody and unwholesome. Cook and serve like carrots. No. 188. PARSNIPS. Cook and serve like carrots. No. 189. SEA-KALE. Tie it in bundles, and put into boiling water with salt. Boil gently, with the lid off the saucepan until tender. Drain well, and hand French or white sauce with it. Sea-kale is very good boiled in milk, the milk afterwards being used for the sauce.

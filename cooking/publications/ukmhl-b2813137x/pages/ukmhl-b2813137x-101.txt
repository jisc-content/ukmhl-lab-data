75 No. 181. FRENCH BEANS. Remove the strings and cut the beans into nice thin slices. Put them into boiling water with salt, and boil gently until tender. Drain well, then return them to the saucepan with a little butter, pepper, and salt. Shake over the gas for a minute or two, and serve in hot dish. No. 182. BROAD BEANS. After the shells are removed put them into boiling water with salt, and cook gently until they are tender. Time allowed depends upon the age and size of the beans. They may be served with parsley sauce poured over, or in the same manner as French beans. No. 183. VEGETABLE MARROWS Are much nicer steamed than boiled, as they retain their flavour so much better. Peel the marrows thinly, remove the seeds, and cut the marrows into convenient sized pieces. Place them in a steamer and steam for 20 minutes, or until the marrows are tender. Pour over white sauce and serve. No. 184. ASPARAGUS. Scrape the white part slightly, and cut the asparagus all the same length. Tie it in a bundle and put it into boiling water, with salt, and half an ounce of butter. Cook gently, lid off the saucepan, until the green part is tender (about half an hour). Dish on a napkin, and hand oiled butter with it. N.B.â€”In salting water for cooking vegetables, allow the proportion of half an ounce of salt to two quarts of water.

113 PASTRY. No. 289. PUFF PASTRY. INGREDIENTS. ^ lb. fine flour ^ lb. butter 1 teaspoonful lemon juice A pinch of salt l.yolk of egg Cold water to mix METHOD. Rub the flour through a sieve to remove any lumps; place the butter in a clean cloth and squeeze out all the moisture. Put the flour into a basin, or upon a marble slab, make a well in the centre, and drop in the salt, lemon juice, and yolk, add the cold water very gradually, and with the fingers work into a soft elastic paste, then knead until quite smooth. Roll out until about quarter of an inch in thickness. The butter should be of the same consistency as the dough, then press it out to half the size of the rolled out pastry, place it upon the pastry about a quarter of an inch from the edge, fold the pastry over it, and press the edges of the pastry lightly together. Roll out, being careful not to allow the butter to work to the surface, fold equally into three, allow it to stand in a cool place for 15 minutes. Place the open edges towards you upon the board, roll out again, fold into three as before, and allow to cool for 15 minutes after the friction of the rolling pin Repeat this until the pastry has been rolled out seven times after the addition of the butter, and it is then ready for use.

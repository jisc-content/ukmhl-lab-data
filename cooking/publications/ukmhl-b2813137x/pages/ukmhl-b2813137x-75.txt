53 No. 120. MUTTON CUTLETS. INGREDIENTS. Neck of mutton, best end l egg Bread crumbs 2 oz. butter METHOD. Saw off the chine bone, and (if the neck is cut in a manner that requires it) the end of the rib-bones. Cut the cutlets, giving a bone to each cutlet. If the appearance of the dish is not of great importance, the cutlets can be cut more economically by forming more cutlets out of two bones of the neck. In this manner two cutlets will have bones, while one will be without. Trim away the greater part of the fat, leaving only a very small piece round the lean part of each cutlet. Scrape the bones. Have ready some bread crumbs. Beat an egg on a plate, add a small saltspoonful of salt, and a pinch of pepper. Dip the cutlets into the egg and turn into the bread crumbs, which should lie on a piece of soft paper, so that they may be easily tossed over the cutlet. After taking up the cutlet from the crumbs, toss it lightly from one hand to the other, so that all loose bread crumbs may fall off. Heat the butter in a frying pan, or saute pan. When quite hot, lay in the cutlets and let them cook for about ten minutes, turning them carefully when the underside is brown. Serve round a centre of mashed potatoes, Brussels sprouts, green peas, or round a puree of haricot beans. Brown sauce (p. 90) or tomato sauce (p. 94) may be served round the cutlets. No. 121.

16 Tomatoes are a very nice addition to this stock. This stock may serve as a basis for all fish soups. No. 34. CONSOMME, OR CLEAR SOUP. INGREDIENTS. 2 quarts of first stock | The white and shell of 1 egg f lb. gravy beef METHOD. Remove all the fat from the stock. If it is in a jelly, take off as much as possible with an iron spoon, and remove the remainder by washing the top of the stock with a cloth dipped in very hot water. Scrape the beef finely, and soak it in two tablespoonfuls of cold water, to draw out the juices. Put the stock in a stewpan, and add the beef to it, the white and shell of the egg, and a small piece of each kind of vegetable, except turnip, used in making the stock. Whisk over the gas until the stock begins to simmer ; then leave of! stirring, and let it boil up well ; take it off the gas, and put it aside for a crust to form. Tie a clean cloth to a soup-strainer, or to the four legs of a chair turned upside down ; pour some boiling water through it into a basin to ensure it being perfectly clean ; then put a clean basin underneath and pour all the contents of the stew-pan on to the cloth. The first time the soup runs through it will be cloudy, because the filter made by the beef and egg will not settle at the bottom of the cloth. Take the soup away, put a clean basin under the cloth, and pour the soup slowly through a second time. If this is carefully done the soup will be quite brilliant the second time of straining and need not go through the cloth again.

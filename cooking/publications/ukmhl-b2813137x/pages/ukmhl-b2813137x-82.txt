Light the grilling burner for three minutes before you wish to use it, with the gas turned on full, then lower the gas a little and allow from three to five minutes for each side of the meat, a little longer if a very thick piece Steaks and chops are most suitable for grilling, and are very delicious when cooked in this manner. No. 133. STEWING MEAT. Meat for stewing should be placed in a stewpan with enough hot water to cover it, and allowed to simmer gently until tender, and as soon as it is tender it should be removed from the pan or the pan drawn off the gas, and the meat re-heated before serving, or it will beccome tough, flavourless, and very indigestible. Time allowed for stewing meat depends upon the kind of meat to be stewed. Very tough meat will sometimes take over four hours before it is tender. No. 134. BRAISING MEAT When a braising pan is not used, meat may be braised in an ordinary stewpan in the following manner :â€” Place a layer of sliced vegetables, carrots, turnips, onions, tomatoes, and celery, using a small proportion of each, and a sprig of parsley, thyme, and marjoram, and two bay leaves at the bottom of the stewpan. Over these place the meat, and add sufficient good stock to come half way up the meat, then simmer very gently until the meat is tender. Then place the meat in the oven upon a baking sheet and let it brown nicely. .Strain the stock and reduce it to a glase, by boiling it rapidly. Wine may be added to the stock if liked. Serve the meat upon a hot dish with the glaze poured over.

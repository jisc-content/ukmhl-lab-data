XXXV. CONVENIENCE AND SUPERIORITY OF COOKING. The difficulty of the ignorance of servants will also be readily removed by the week’s supervision suggested, for any servant who cannot manage the dampers of an ordinary coal range, can be made to understand and regulate the burners of a Gas Range. GAS COMPANIES AND CORPORATIONS are now so alive to the advance of the Electric Light that they are everywhere seeking to obtain an increased consumption from the use of Gas Stoves. This has been of immense advantage to the general public, having led to the adoption of the system of letting Gas Ranges, etc., on hire in the same manner as Gas Meters. Nearly all Gas Companies and Corporations owning Gas Works now let Cookers on hire, and a large and increasing number let out Gas Fires. By this means Stoves which, to purchase, would cost, say £5 to £7, can be rented at 2s. 6d. per quarter, and are superintended and kept in repair for that charge. Larger and smaller sizes in proportion. LECTURES ON COOKERY AND GAS EXHIBITIONS are becoming so frequent—indeed in some districts of London and the larger provincial towns they are held annually—that any difficulties in the working of a Stove can be at once explained at these Educational Exhibitions. It is not our intention here to deal exhaustively with the whole range of the advantages of Cooking by Gas. This lias already been so well done by Alfred Colson, Esq., C.E. (Engineer to the Leicester Gas Department) in his little standard work, “ Economy and other Advantages of Cooking: by Gas.” We would, however, briefly state that— 1st. Servants will stay longer where Gas Stoves are used. 2nd. Where no Servants are kept the work is much lighter for the ladies of the house. 3rd. Cost of Gas is less than half that of Coal. A family of eight can do all their cooking for 2£d. to 3d. per day.

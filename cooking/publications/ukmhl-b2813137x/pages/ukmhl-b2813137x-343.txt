xvu. Huddersfield Daily Examiner, Friday, July 2nd, 1897. THE GAS EXHIBITION AT THE ARMOURY, HUDDERSFIELD. Presentation of Medals.—On Thursday evening a presenta- tion of medals was made in connection with the gas exhibition which is being held in the Armoury, to which reference has twice been made in our columns. The medals were presented to Miss L. Richmond and Mrs. J. J. Middleton, in appre- ciation of cookery lectures which have been given by them at previous exhibitions.—Mr. Richmond presided, and briefly introduced Alderman Glendinning, the Deputy Mayor, in the absence of the Mayor (Alderman J. Lee Walker).—Alderman Glendinning, after remarking on the importance of cooking in the household, said that if the lectures there had improved the cooking in the various homes of Huddersfield, they had done a tremendous amount of good. Their work was like bread cast upon the waters, and would be seen after many days. It would go on improving, and as those present derived benefits from those lectures and demonstrations those benefits would be transmitted to others. He then made the presentation of the first medal to Miss Richmond, and the other to Mrs. Middleton.-The latter, replying for herself and Miss Richmond, said that their lectures in Huddersfield had been rendered very pleasant by the kind attention and regular- attendance of their friends. It was nice to think that during the distribution of medals for the Jubilee they had not been forgotten, and nobody would prize the medals given in honour of the Queen more than they should the Huddersfield medals. (Applause.)—On the proposal of Mr. Richmond, seconded by Mr. J. Pogson, a vote of thanks was accorded to Alderman Glendinning for having made the presentation, and the proceedings concluded.

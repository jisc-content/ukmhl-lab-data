169 No. 412. ORANGE JELLY. One gill water, one gill orange juice. Boil a few shreds of the peel in the water, add the orange juice and three saccharin tabloids. When at boiling point stir in a quarter of an ounce of Nelsonâ€™s Leaf Gelatine, and when thoroughly melted take the saucepan off the stove. Have ready the yolk of an egg well beaten and pour the hot jelly on it by degrees. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and stir over the gas for five minutes. A teaspoonful of curacjoa gives flavour and richness to this jelly, and if it is desired to make the dish particularly attractive, an orange care- fully peeled, divided into sections, with the pips extracted, and steeped in a little brandy, can be placed round the jelly when turned out.

118 No. 299. RAISED PIE CRUST—(Cold.) INGREDIENTS. 1 lb. flour -4 ozs. butter l egg Cold water to mix 1 teaspoonful salt METHOD. Rub the butter lightly into the hour and salt, and mix into a smooth, firm, paste with the beaten egg and cold water. The egg may be omitted, and milk used instead of water if desired. This crust must be rather less firm than ordinary short crust, or it will break when moulding. Beat the butter or lard to a cream, stir in the sugar and salt, then add the hour gradually, moistening with the beaten egg and a little cold water until the paste leaves the sides of the basin clearly. Turn out upon a houred board, and roll out to the required size. One teaspoonful of lemon juice may be added to this pastry if desired. N.B.—This is an excellent recipe for pastry during the hot weather of summer, as it requires scarcely any handling. No. 300. BEATEN PASTRY.

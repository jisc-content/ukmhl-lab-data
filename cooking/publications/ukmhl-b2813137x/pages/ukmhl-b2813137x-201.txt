Make a well in the middle, and put the two eggs into it; mix them smoothly with the flour, and add the milk very gradually. Melt the lard or dripping. Well season a small frying pan, about the size of a cheese plate. Put into it a teaspoonful of the melted fat, and let it run well over the pan. Then pour in enough batter to cover the pan thinly, and fry it brown, shaking the pan occasionally to keep it from burning. Then toss it on to the other side, and when that is fried turn it on to kitchen paper. ^ Sprinkle with sugar and lemon juice and roll it up. Keep it hot while the remainder of the batter is fried in the same way. If the maker cannot toss the pancakes well, they may be turned with a broad-bladed knife. If they are fried in a large pan, more fat must be used. No. 383. FRENCH PANCAKES.

168 No. 409. FRUIT SET IN JELLY. Any fruit may be used ; in the summer fresh fruit, as raspberries, strawberries, currants, Ac. ; in the winter, grapes, dried fruits of any kind, preserved peaches, apricots, together with almonds, Ac. Rinse a mould out in cold water ; stand it in cold water or on ice, or in a cool place, and pour in a tablespoonful of jelly (clear wine jelly) ; place in this a little of the fruit, not too closely, or the clearness of the jelly will not show to advantage. When this layer has set, pour in a little more jelly and some more fruit, and allow that to set, and so on till the mould is full. No. 410. VANILLA CREAM. Boil two gills of milk or cream, sweeten with sugar or saccharin, flavour with extract of vanilla, stir in a quarter of an ounce of Nelson’s Leaf or Nelson’s Brilliant Gelatine, and when dissolved take oft the gas. Beat occasionally until on the point of setting, then stir in the white of an egg beaten to a strong froth, and mould the cream. No. 411. PRUNE JELLY. Wash the fruit, and to half a pound of it allow a quarter of a pound of sugar and half a pint of water. Boil the sugar and water together for ten minutes, then put in the fruit and stew gently until perfectly tender, so that it will break up easily. Drain the syrup from the prunes, and boil it until it becomes thick. Meanwhile take out the stones and rub the prunes through a sieve to a fine pulp, which add to the syrup. When this is on the point of boiling stir in a quarter of an ounce of Nelson’s Leaf Gelatine or Nelson’s Brilliant Gelatine, to each half-pint. Cream can be served with this jelly when allowed.

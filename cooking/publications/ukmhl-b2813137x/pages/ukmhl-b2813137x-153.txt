Put the flour and salt into a basin, cut the butter or lard into small pieces and add to the flour, squeeze in the lemon juice, and with the cold water mix into a rather stiff paste. Turn out on to a floured board, roll into a long strip, fold equally into three, turn open edges towards you, and roll out as before. Repeat this until the pastry has been rolled out four times, when it is ready for use. N.B.—Instead of using all butter or lard, the quantities may be equally divided, and if the crust be required for meat pies good beef dripping may be used. Put flour, salt, and sugar into a basin, rub the butter into the flour with the tips of the fingers until it has the appearance of fine bread crumbs, then mix into a stiff’ paste with the beaten egg, to which a little cold water has been added. This pastry only requires rolling out once. No. 293. RICH SHORT PASTRY. INGREDIENTS. 6 ozs.

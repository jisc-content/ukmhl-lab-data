Light the gas and turn it on full for ten minutes before putting in the joint ; then allow the gas to remain on full for ten minutes after- wards to coagulate the surface albumen of the meat, and keep in the juices. Then lower the gas and cook more slowly until the meat is done, according to the following rules :— Time in a gas oven— Beef and Mutton—Every lb. 10 min. and 15 min. over. If a thick piece ditto 15 ,, 15 ,, Veal and Pork ditto 20 ,, 15 ,, If a thick piece ditto 25 ,, 15 ,, When the meat is cooked, place on a hot dish, pour the dripping out of the tin and some boiling water over the brown sediment left; dredge in a little flour, if liked, cook over the fire a few minutes—add one teaspoonful Liebig Company's extract of meat, season, strain, and pour round meat. No. 131. STEAMING MEAT. Steamed meat is much more economical and much more palatable than boiled meat, and also more nourish- ing. Boiled meat loses a great deal of its goodness in the liquid in which it is cooked, and unless this liquid be afterwards used as stock for soups, etc., it is very wasteful. Meat for steaming should be placed in a steamer over a stewpan of boiling water and steamed according to to the size of the joint, allowing a little over 20 minutes to the lb., and 15 minutes extra for the whole joint.

XXXI. “Gas as a Domestic Seruant.” By E. W. T. RICHMOND, Warrington. We are often told that if servants were more careful Gras Stoves would be in greater demand, and it is with a view of dealing with this aspect of Gas Consumption that we are venturing to point out the fallacy of this contention. GOOD SERVANTS are becoming each year more difficult to find and keep, and ladies who are wise will seek for, and adopt, every contrivance which can be shown to be both economical and labour saving. EXTRAVAGANCE AND IGNORANCE are the two standard complaints with which we have to deal, and it is only fair to point out that these faults are at least equally felt in the use of Coal, Wood, Oil, and Provisions, as well as in the use of Gas. THERE IS NO MORE NEED TO KEEP A BOILING OR OVEN BURNER LIGHTED, WHEN NOT IN USE, THAN THERE IS TO KEEP THE GAS BRACKET BURNING IN THE DAYLIGHT. LADIES who, when a Stove is first fixed, will take the trouble to explain to their servants the uses of the various burners, and insist upon the “ Card of Directions ” (which should accompany every Cooker) being hung in a convenient position over the Stove, should have after a week’s superintendence, no cause to complain. Extravagance can also be readily checked by the use of a special meter for the Stove, and, like the Dublin Gas Company, by the use of a special Tap, which can be locked so as to supply only a given quantity of Gas, sufficient, say, for the oven and one boiling burner. This Tap might be used to shut Gas olf altogether, and not delivered to servants until the time

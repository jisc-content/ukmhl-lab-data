69 No. 165. BACON Should be soaked for an hour or more before cooking, put into lukewarm water, and simmered gently until tender. Allow 25 minutes to the lb. When done allow it to cool a little, then remove the skin and cover with raspings, or brown crumbs. No. 166. ROAST SUCKING PIG. Stuff the belly of the pig with sage and onion force- meat, then truss it like a hare. Brush it over with salad oil, and bake or roast for about two hours, according to the size and age of the pig. Baste very frequently. When done, remove the trussing string, cut the pig down the middle, from head to tail, place back to back upon the dish, with half the head and an ear at each side. Serve bread sauce with currants in it; apple and tomato : or any good flavoured sauce would be suitable. Instead of sage and onion stuffing, chestnut forcemeat mixed with sausage meat is sometimes used in preference. No. 167. HAM Should be allowed to soak for twelve hours, and longer when possible. Put it on in lukewarm water, with a bunch of herbs, and some people add one pint of old ale to the water. Let it simmer very gently until quite tender, allowing a little over 25 minutes to each lb. of ham. Remove the skin, when done, and cover with raspings, as for boiled bacon. Sometimes the ham is removed from the pan when partly cooked, the skin removed, covered with raspings, and finished cooking in a moderate oven.

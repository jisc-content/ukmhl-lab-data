80 POULTRY AND GAME. â€¢V'syX/'S.'^'X^ No. 201. TO TRUSS A FOWL FOR ROASTING. It is almost an impossibility to explain the art of trussing; experience teaches more than can be obtained from any book. Anyone desiring to become proficient in the art should take a few practical lessons from a poulterer, or someone equally competent. However, full directions are given below for trussing a fowl for roasting and boiling, and these methods only vary slightly in larger birds and game. After the fowl has been carefully plucked and singed, cut a slit about an inch long three inches below the head, loosen the skins round the neck with the fingers, and with a sharp knife cut off the neck close to the body, then cut the skin, leaving about two inches to fold over the back under the pinions. Take out the crop and loosen the liver, etc., at the breast-end of the bird. Cut a small opening at the vent and draAv out all the interior of the fowl, being careful not to break the gall bladder in the liver. Then wipe the inside of the fowl well with a damp cloth. Scald the scaly part of the legs and feet, skin them and cut off the claws. Place the fowl upon its breast, pull the loose skin from the neck well over the back, and fold the pinions across it. Press the thighs well into the sides of the bird to give it a nice plump appearance. Pass the trussing needle and string through the wing at the second joint, then through the upper part of the thigh, right through the body, securing the wing and thigh in the same manner upon the other side. Pass the string through the skin under the pinions and fasten off where it commenced. Turn the fowl upon its back, and pass the string over one leg through the bottom of the breast-bone, over the other leg and secure it at the back. Choose Fowls with dark legs for Roasting.

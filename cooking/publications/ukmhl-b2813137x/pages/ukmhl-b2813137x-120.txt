90 No. 231. ROAST LARKS. Truss them, after the heads, legs, and gizzard have been removed, and pass a long skewer through their bodies. Pour over them a little oiled butter, and roast, basting them frequently. A small piece of fat bacon should be placed over the breasts. Cook them upon small rounds of buttered toast, and serve them upon these, arranged in rows, or a circle, and browned crumbs heaped in the centre. Larks may be egged and rolled in brown crumbs, and fried, if preferred. L

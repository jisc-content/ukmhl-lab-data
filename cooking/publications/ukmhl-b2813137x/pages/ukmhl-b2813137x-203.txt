157 SOUFFLES AND OMELETS. RULES FOR SOUFFLES. The whites and yolks of the eggs must be beaten separately. The whites must be beaten to a firm froth, which will cut with a knife. To do this the whites must be most carefully separated from the yolksâ€”a small portion of yolk left in will prevent the whites becoming stiff. The whites must be put on to a large plate, a pinch of salt should be added, and they should be beaten up with a clean knife in a cool place. Souffles are not to be beaten after the whites are added. Ihey must be baked in a rather hot oven, the door of which is to be kept shut. They must be served directly they are cooked. RULES FOR OMELETS. 'The eggs and butter must be fresh. The omelet pan should be kept very clean and used for omelets only, and must not be too large. The mixture must be put into the pan as soon as the butter bubbles, and before it browns. It must not be allowed to become too brown, nor to stick to the pan. The omelet must be served the moment it is ready.

181 No. 435. STEAMED BREAD. Make the dough in the usual way (see Household Bread). Place the tins in a pan of boiling water, allowing the water only to reach three parts of the way up the tins. Place a greased paper over the loaves to prevent the con- densed steam from the saucepan lid falling upon them. Keep the water boiling gently until the bread is done. Steamed bread is far lighter than baked bread, and, if desired a nice brown, place the loaves in a quick oven for about ten minutes after removing them from the saucepan. No. 436. DOUGH CAKE. Add to 11 lbs. of dough a little salt, 4 ozs. of moist sugar, 4 ozs. of sultanas or currants, and 4 ozs. of good dripping. Work all these ingredients well into the dough and bake in a greased tin for about 1^ hours, in a moderate oven. No. 437. LONDON MUFFINS. INGREDIENTS. 1 b ozs. of German yeast | 1 teaspoonful of salt 1 quart of warm milk j About 21, lbs. of flour METHOD. Mix the yeast with the warm milk and salt, then add sufficient flour to form a soft dough. Cover with a cloth and set in a warm place to “ rise ” for about an hour. Turn out upon a floured board, divide the dough into equal portions, and form into rounds with the hands, slightly floured. Set the board in a warm place and allow the muffins to “ prove’ for half an hour. Bake them in a quick oven until they are lightly coloured, turning them once. When done, pull, do not cut, them open, butter them, place them upon a very hot plate, cut across, and serve at once. Muffins retain their shape better when baked in muffin rings.

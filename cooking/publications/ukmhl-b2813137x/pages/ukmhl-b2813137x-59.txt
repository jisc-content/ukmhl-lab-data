41 add the flour, stir until smooth, then add the milk, stir and boil until the panada leaves the bottom and sides of the pan quite clean, then add the salt, pepper, and a little grated nutmeg, mix all together, turn out on to a plate to cool. When cold, form in the shape of cutlets, brush over with beaten egg, cover with bread crumbs, fry in boiling fat, drain and serve with a piece of parsley stalk in the end of each to imitate a cutlet bone, or small pieces of macaroni. Lobster may be cooked in the same way. No. 93. TO COOK WHITEBAIT. AVhitebait should be as fresh as possible and firm. They are generally fried in very hot fat 400 degrees Fr., and served with brown bread and butter, and lemons cut lengthwise in quarters. Before frying them, they should be allowed to remain in iced water, until ready for use, then put a handful of flour upon a cloth, throw in a few whitebait, shake them quickly in the cloth to cover them wth flour, shake them slightly in the frying basket, to shake off loose flour, and at once fry them in the hot fat. When properly fried each fish will be quite separate and crisp. No. 94. TO COOK SMELTS. Smelts are generally dipped in beaten egg rolled in bread crumbs and fried; though they may be boiled, broiled, or baked. When quite fresh they should be very silvery, and smell like freshly-cut cucumber. Serve, piquant, anchovy, tomato, Hollandaise, or any suitable sauce. No. 95. TO COOK TROUT. Trout may be either grilled, baked, or fried, and may be served with any of the sauces suitable for smelts. Hol- landaise and tartare are the general favourites, with trout.

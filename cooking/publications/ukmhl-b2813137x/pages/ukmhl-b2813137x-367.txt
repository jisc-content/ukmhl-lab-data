xli. Bedrooms are now so generally heated by gas, it does not seem necessary to advocate the advantages of a fire here; but IT IS AS WELL TO REMIND OUR FRIENDS THAT THE LATE SlR W. B. Richardson tells us that more colds are caught by leaving WARM SITTING-ROOMS—FREQUENTLY 70 OR 80 DEGREES, FaHT., FOR COLD BEDROOMS WITH THE THERMOMETER AT 35 TO 48 DEGREES—THAN FROM ANY OTHER CAUSE. A gas fire at the cost of fd. per hour, will prevent all this. Again, it should not be forgotten that the incovenience AND DISCOMFORT OF DRESSING IN A COLD BEDROOM ARE AT ONCE OVERCOME, AS A GAS FIRE LIGHTED 15 MINUTES BEFORE GETTING UP WILL MAKE THE ROOM COMFORTABLE. THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE WITH A COAL FIRE IN A BEDROOM, WHICH HAS TO BF. EITHER KEPT IN ALL NIGHT OR RE-LIT IN THE MORNING. It is frequently urged by doctors and scientists that gas tires give off a dry heat. We have successfully dealt with this complaint, having introduced a water-pan underneath our hot air series of fires, which now deliver a quantity of pure, moist, warmed air into the apartment, and are most agreeable. The makers and varieties of stoves are increasing daily, but we are prouci to say that, in dace of the keenest competition, the merits of our goods are still running up our sales to quiet an unprecedented extent. Our experience, gained with leading manufacturers of the day, has enabled us to offer advantages in design, construction, and duty obtained for gas consumed, which will repay a trial of our manufactures. Sufficient has now been shown to at least prove that this age of invention and development in labour-saving appliances has not overlooked our homes. E. W. T. RICHMOND.

SYRUPS, ETC. No. 658.—Clakipied Syrup. Put four pounds of broken loaf sugar into a clean bloek-tin pan, or pan lined with earthenware, with a quart of spring water; stir till the sugar is dissolved ; set it over a moderate fire, adding the beaten white of an egg, before the sugar and water are become w'arm; when boiling, take off the scum, and keep it boiling till perfectly clear; then strain it through muslin, and when cold, put it in bottles. If well corked, it will keep several months. Fruit syrups are better when prepared with this clarified syrup, than when made with sugar only. It is also convenient to be used for sweetening at the table. No. 659.—Cheery Syrup. Stone, and strip from the stalks any quantity of very ripe cherries; put them in a jar with very little water; set the jar in a pan of water on the fire; when sufficiently done, so that the juice will easily sepa- rate from the fruit, strain through a fine hair sieve; to each quart of clear juice, allow one pint and a half of clarified syrup. No. 658 ; boil over a slow fire till perfectly clear, and bottle when cold. Syrup from any kind of juicy fruit may be prepared in the same way, adding more or less sugar, according to the sweetness or acidity of the fruit used. No. 660.—Elder Syrup. Pick the berries, when quite ripe, from the stalks ; put them into a broad deep eai’then jar ; adding half a pint of water to each quart of berries; cover, and set them in the oven till they are sufficiently stewed to extract the juice from them ; then strain through a coai-se liair sieve ; to each pint of juice allow one pound of bromi sugar, and to every two quarts, one ounce of the best ginger, bruised ; boil it half an hour; strain through a fine sieve, and when cold, fill the bottles to the neck; cork closely, and keep them in a cool place.

186 YEGETAUUN COOKERY. No. 630.—Blackberry Jelly. Pick the blackberries, which should be quite ripe, and put them in a jar with the rind of a lemon, pared thin; cover closely, and set them in a pan of W'ater over the fire, till reduced to a pulp; then strain, and to one pint of juice, allow one pound of loaf sugar, and the juice of a lemon, strained; boil to a jelly, and pour it into small pots, or shallow jars. No. 631.—Black Currant Jelly. To every two pounds of black currants, when picked, allow' one pound of white currants, and half a pint of water; set them over the fire to scald, but not to boil; then bruise them well with a wooden masher; take them off the fire, and immediately press them through a hair sieve; to each pint of juice, allow a pound of bruised or powdered loaf sugar, and boil it ten minutes, taking off the scum. The currants should be gathered dry, and quite ripe. No. 632.—Ked Currant Jelly. To two-thirds of red currants, add one of white, gathered when quite ripe and dry ; squeeze them, without picking; strain, and press the juice through a hair sieve, and immediately make it qidle hot, but do not let it boil; to each pint of juice, allow one pound of sugar, finely powdered, and also made quite hot in a moderate oven; spread on a large flat dish; have it ready to put to the hot juice; add it by degrees, stirring it till the sugar is perfectly dissolved, and pour it into jelly pots or glasses immediately. No. 633.—Damson Jelly. Put fine ripe damsons in a stew-pot w'ith very little water; set it in a moderate oven till the fruit is sufficiently done, for the juice to be strained from it through a hair sieve; allow a pound of sugar to a pint of juice; boil tw'enty minutes; try a few drops on a plate, and if it will set it is sufficiently done. As the clear juice only is required for the jelly, the fruit may be used for damson cheese, or for puddings.

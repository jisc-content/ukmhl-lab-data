Another way is to add to the pulp a dessert-spoouful of flour, or a table-spoonful of fine bread-crumbs, and three table-spoonfuls of hot water; stew gently ten minutes; take it off the fire, and stir in two ounces of butter, till quite melted, and serve as above. No. 204.—White Sauce. Half a pint of mushroom broth ; quarter of a pint of new milk; half an ounce of onion; a blade of mace; one ounce of flour; one ounce and a half of butter; juice of a lemon; two yolks of eggs, and four table-spoonfuls of good cream. Set the milk and mushroom broth on the fire with the onion, cut in pieces, and the mace, and boil ten minutes; stir the flour and butter, previously mixed, well in till it boils; let it stand near the fire or stove, stirring it occasionally, till it becomes quite smooth; then pass it through a fine tin strainer; return it into the pan, with a little salt, and the juice of a small lemon; beat the yolks of the eggs, and add the cream; strain it into the sauce, and stir it over a moderate fire, but do not let it boil, or it will cm'dle. A very good white sauce may be made by putting a few mush- rooms, previously rubbed through a sieve, into some butter sauce, adding a little cream and seasoning powder (No. 214). When sauces are finished with eggs, use only the yolks, and mix them first with a spoonful or two of the sauce; then with the whole, off the fire; when well mixed, set the pan on the fire, stirring it constantly till near boiling, but on no account allow it to boil after the eggs are put in. No. 205.—White Sauce por Vegetables. One dessert-spoonful of arrow-root or potato-flour, and half a pint of milk. Moisten the arrow-root with a little cold water; pour on the milk, boiling; stir quickly, and season with pepper and salt.

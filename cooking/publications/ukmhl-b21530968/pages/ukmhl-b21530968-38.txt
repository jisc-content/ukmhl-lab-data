i INTRODUCTION. have not the least reason to doubt the fairness of the conclusions arrived at, we have the more carnivorous Englishman surpassed in height, weight, and strength, by the frugal and abstemious Scotchman ; he again being surpassed by the simply fed Irishman, whose frame has most probably, been mainly built up upon the simplest of all vegetable products. It might here be proper to introduce statistics in relation to the practical evidence of the members composing the present Tegetarian organization. Suffice it, however, to say, that these afford arguments for the adoption of the practice, notwithstanding the difficulties which have to be encountered in the transition from artificial and erroneous habits of life to those even which are healthful and most in accor- dance wdth nature. The general experience is, that to the man in health the system is productive of more health and endurance; whilst from the great niunber of individuals who seek refuge in the Vege- tarian practice from the various ills of long continued dyspepsia, the evidence is, for the most part, at least, that health is improved, and ultimately, completely regained in the carrying on of the system. The evidence which has been derived from the experience of the pre- sent limited number of the Society, is also of great value, in show- ing the comparative exemption from the attacks of illness, and the increased facilities in recovery with far less of the ordinary appliances of medical treatment; and this notwithstanding the difficulties necessarily besetting those who seek to depart from the prevailing practice of society, resulting, in many cases, in very defective arrange- ments in regard to the practical carrying out of the system, for want of the knowledge intended to be conveyed by the present work. Having endeavoured to show that fruits, roots, and grain, ore the natural food of man; what are the true nutritive qualities of food; that certain vegetables are more nutritive than the flesh of animals; that the origin of all nutriment is in the vegetable kingdom; that the cost of the principles of matter to form a given weight of the flesh, blood, and bone of the human system, if derived from the flesh of animals, is at least twenty-three times the expense of the same amount of flesh, blood, and bone formed from certain kinds of farina- ceous food; that on an average, the various articles comprised in a Vegetarian diet are more digestible than a corresponding average of the preparations from the flesh of animals; that the consumption of flesh induces a heightened pulse, tending to premature old age.

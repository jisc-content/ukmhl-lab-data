XXV INTUODi;CTION. from vhicli we speak, as the result of two Parliamentary inquiries, have been brought before the public. It is an established fact, that many tons weight of diseased flesh are seized year by year by the inspectors of the markets of our large cities; and it has invariably been found, that the greater the attention bestowed upon the subject, the greater has been the amount of diseased meat seized. In London there are certain markets which, to the inspectors, at least, are known to contain little else than meat in one state or other of disease; and such is the established trade in diseased carcasses, that one of the wit- nesses before a committee of the House of Lords in 1860 declared, that had he one hundred carcasses of cows to dispose of, he could readily find purchasers for them within twenty-four hours, whatever might have been the diseases of which they had died. It also transpires, that insurance offices have been established, since the naturalization of the small-pox and other diseases in this country, which guarantee the gi-azier against loss from the disease which may break out in his stock, one condition of these offices being, that the animals affected, for which compensation is claimed, shall be handed over, alive or dead, to the office. In connection with these establishments, are slaughter- houses at some distance from London, to wliich the animals handed over to the offices are sent, and after being slaughtered and their bodies dressed in peculiar ways, the meat is sent to London, and forms no inconsiderable portion of the “ dead meat supply” of the metropolis. The enormities carried out in this unprincipled course of business, as developed by the inquiries to which we allude, and several trials occurring in Liverpool, Glasgow, and elsewhere, have directed the public attention in some measure to this subject; but, hitherto, alto- gether insufficiently so, to remedy the evil results in relation to public health. The system in the metropolis is so far acknowledged in certain quarters, as to supply names to the animals in various states of disease (as cows and bullocks) ; considered almost all marketable, however, and, if we were to believe the evidence given, necessary for the business of certain establishments, which find a demand for inferior kinds of sausages, saveloys, and other “preserved meats.” It is found also, that large sums are spent weekly by certain soup and “ beef-a-la-mode” establishments, in the purchase of the bodies of animals such as these mentioned; and it was stated before B

We ■would not from the above facts as to the digestibility of food, bo understood to attribute the blame of the erroneous impressions which prevail, altogether to the medical faculty. The fact is, as above stated, that these views, both as to the composition and the digesti- bility of food, are only of recent date, and do not form part of the knowledge of the great mass of the medical profession, who prescribe under the combined influences of the old impressions and popular tastes upon the subject. It is also too much to expect that the medi- cal profession can be left in freedom to speak in accordance with their knowledge upon these subjects, or that of the consumption of alcoholic beverages, in opposition to the strong and popular prejudices to bo contended with, even in the few instances where the facts above pre- sented (which are rather the incidental acquirement, than the actual communication of present medical teaching) are known to members of the profession. It is quite true, that in times past as well as now, there have always been eminent men of the medical profession who have supported views in favour of abstinence from flesh as food; and some there now are, who, like Dr. IVIattson of Boston, and the physicians and surgeons who have joined the Vegetarian organization, “ having formerly in common with their medical brethren believed that the flesh of animals as food was essential to the fuU development of the physical constitution, have, since facts opposed to this belief have been presented to their attention, seen abundant reason for changing their opinions, and now follow out abstinence from the flesh of animals as food in their own cases, and prescribe this in all others where the prejudices of society will permit them.” We conceive, therefore, that society has more to blame its own strong appetites upon these subjects than the medical profession, which may have many things to say, which cannot now be borne, and we look to the progress of knowledge to reinstate this class of professional men in their true position of advisers to secure health, instead of being, as is now generally the case, called, in the perversions of society, only to minister to the results of error and disease. A difficulty is here presented, at this stage of our progress, in the conviction of the consumers of the flesh of animals, as to the very different results produced by food of a farinaceous and vegctablo

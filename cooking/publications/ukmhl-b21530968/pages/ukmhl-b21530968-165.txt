107 PIES AND TARTS. No. 369.—Icing for Tarts. After tai-ts are baked, they are sometimes iced on the top, to im- prove their appearance; this may be done in the following manner :— Beat the white of an egg to a froth, and with a soft brush or feather, spread it over the cover of the tart; then sift white sugar upon it, and return the tai-t to the oven for about five minutes.

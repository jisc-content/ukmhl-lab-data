INTKODUCTION. XIS tion,” is answered in a way altogether condemnatory of flesh as food, when the cost of relying upon the nutriment of flesh is compared with that of the identical elements of nutriment derived from vege- table products, as may be readily observed on an inspection of the following calculations.

Q\d. It is needless to carry our remarks upon this most available argu- ment in support of the Vegetarian system, much further than the statistics already presented of themselves carry it. We look, however, upon this feature, in its political and economic aspects, as one of the most important that can possibly engage the attention, from the moment that the question of the resources of a country and the feed- ing of the masses of the people is taken into consideration. Sir Eichard Phillips, in his Million of Facts, shows that -without the cultivation of the thirty millions of acres of waste land in Great Britain, and with the resom’ces of agriculture as they then stood, that two hundred and fifty millions of inhabitants could be maintained on vegetable products, whilst, eighty millions, only, could be fed on flesh and vegetables. Other calculations more favourable to our argument could bo introduced j but aU consideration of the subject leads to the conclusion, that abundance is ever produced on the one system, while the other as naturally tends to scarcity and want, and even to the depopulation of certain districts, as seen in the “ sheep-walks ” of Scotland, where, from the demand for mutton, the inhabitants

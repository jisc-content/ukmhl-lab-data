INTRODUCTION. -\V researches of Baron Liebio, many practical conclusions are now ascertained, in relation not merely to the actual composition of food as determined by a series of analyses, but also as to the actual appli- cation of the principles of food to the wants of the human body. It has been determined, that every thought of the mind, as well as every act of the body, produces changes in the human system, progressively converting the living and healthful matter of which the body is com- posed, to dead and waste particles, which have to be renewed and restored to the living fabrie, in the elements of the blood, the various parts of which must, in the fiiâ€™st instance, be derived from the food consumed. It thus becomes of very great interest to be fully aware of the composition of the various articles of food, and their respective value for forming blood in the body. Besides this leading requirement in the eomposition of food, however, another series of particles have to be provided, which, in combination with the oxygen of the atmo- sphere, produce the animal heat of the body; and lastly, certain mineral particles are required, which are said to produce most im- portant results in the eonversion of the elements of food into the living tissue of the body. The former of these principles of food may be popularly designated as the flesh-for>ning principle, whilst the latter is the heat-forming principle, the mineral elements being usually denominated the ashes of food. In the above conelusions, we have accepted the theory most gene- rally acknowledged as correct, in relation to the formation of the blood and the animal heat of the body, preferring this, for the sake of our argument, as the least favourable of two theories presented on the subject. We now call attention to the following statistics, presenting the composition of various articles of food, the results of the analyses made by distinguished chemists, principally of the Liebig school of chemistry, including those of Dr. Lton Plateaie, Boussingault, and others, in which the composition of food is presented under the three great heads of requirement already mentioned, premising, merely, that in addition to matter to form the animal heat and the blood of the body, as well as ashes, a certain amount of innutritious matter accompanies most articles of food, and that this has been declared by certain physiologists to be of considerable importance; bulk, as well as nutrition, being considered essential to the healthy action of food in the process of digestion.

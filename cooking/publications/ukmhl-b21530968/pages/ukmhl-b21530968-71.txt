OMELETS AND PRITTERS, In frying Omelets, a little butter should be melted in an omelet pan, or small frying pan, till quite hot, the mixture then put in and fried over a moderate fire, for if too hot, the omelet may be burnt before being sufficiently set to be turned over. Fritters should be fried in the same way, allowing a sufficient quantity of the mixture for each fritter to be about four inches broad, and half an inch thick; when properly set, they should be turned over, and when nicely browned, turned again, laid neatly on a flat dish, and garnished with curled pai’sley. No. 37.—Asparagus Omelet. Fifty heads of asparagus, and six eggs. Boil the asparagus in the usual way; cut the green ends in small pieces, as far as they are tender; mix them with the eggs, well beaten make some clarified butter hot in a small frying pan, and put in the omelet; sprinkle it over with a little pepper and salt, and fry it a nice brown. It should be rather thick, and should be served im- mediately, with butter, sauce, and vinegar. No. 38.—Baked Bread Omelet. Six ounces of stale bread, without crust; five eggs; half an ounce of parsley, and a quarter of an ounce of lemon-thyme. Soften the bread thoroughly, in a dish, with a little boiling water, covering it over, and letting it soak for an hour; mash it with a fork, picking out the hard pieces, and adding the parsley and lemon- thyme, chopped fine, with salt and pepper; beat the eggs well, mix- ing them intimately with the other ingredients, and baking the whole in a well-buttered dish (buttered cold), for about fifty minutes; turn it out of the dish ; garnish with parsley, and serve mth brown sauce poured over it, and currant jelly.

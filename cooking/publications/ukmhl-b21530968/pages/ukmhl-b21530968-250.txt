■\rEGETARIAN COOKERY. 192 jars that will hold a pound each; strew over them six ounces of pounded loaf sugar ; cover with two papers, separately tied down; then set the jars in a large pan of cold water nearly up to the rim; simmer gently three quarters of an hour; when taken off the fire, let them remain in the water till cold; cover the jars in the same way as directed in No. 603, and keep them in a dry cool place. No. 654.—To Bottle Cranberries. Pick the cranberries quite clean, and put them in clean bottles; fill the bottles with cold water that has previously been boiled; cement the corks, or cover them with thin paper, rubbed over with white of egg, (‘‘) and keep them in a cool, dry place. American cranberries are kept in the same way, also cluster-bemcs. When to be used for tarts, stew them a little with a few spoonfuls of the water they were kept in, and sugar. No. 655.—To Bottle Damsons. The damsons should be gathered dry before they are too ripe; take off the stalks, and pick out any that are unsound ; put them in bottles with wide necks that will hold about a quart; cork them loosely ; put them in a pan that will admit of the bottles being up to the necks in the water ; put a little hay at the bottom and sides of the pan, and between the bottles; nearly fill the pan with water, and set it on a moderate fire; when the plums begin to shrink in the bottles, take the pan from the fire, and let them remain till quite cold; take the bottles out very carefully; press down the corks, and cover with paper, rubbed over with white of egg. Keep in a cool, dry place. Damsons may be preserved in this way with half a pound of sugar to each quart of fruit, allowing them to remain on the fire twenty minutes after they begin to shrink in the bottles. No. 656.—To Bottle Gooseberries. Pick gooseberries of the small round kind; put them in clean, diy 4. Betts’s capsules are best adapted lor covering the corks of bottles con- taining either fruit or pickles.

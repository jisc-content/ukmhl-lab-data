We feel it especially due, however, to the promoters of the Temperance Reformation, to aclmowledge the good they have effected by the advocacy of a kindred principle, by which they have thus prepared the public mind for greater activity in relation to food; and whilst we heartily join them in opposing, in every form, the pernicious custom of drinking intoxicating liquors, we can as heartily commend to their serious consideration and experiment, a system of diet, which, when adopted, seems invariably to exterminate the appetite for those artificial stimulants against which they have directed their righteous warfare. The friends of Peace and Universal Brotherhood, like- wise claim our warmest sympathy; and in taking this opportunity of expressing it, we would earnestly point to the fact, that the direct tendency of the Vegetarian prac- tice is to enable man the more readily to subdue the passions for dominion and bloodshed which are the foundation of the war system, and, therefore, that the man who abstains from the slaughter of animals, from principle, is never likely to raise his hand against his fellow-man. For the same reasons, we commend this subject to the consideration of the promoters of freedom, humanity, and rehgion, believing that they will find in the "N^egetarian practice, an upwaiâ€™d and an onward tendency, preparing man for a more complete reception and realization of uni- versal justice, peace, mercy, and benevolence.

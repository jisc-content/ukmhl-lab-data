XXVlll INTRODUCTION. opposition of error to the progress of truth; and if there be truth in the Vegetarian system, it cannot be blamed for the temporary conflict between it and a few existing interests. The grazier and the butcher have their vocations called into existence in obedience to the demand produced by the flesh-eating tastes of society, and our commiseration is especially evoked for the latter of these callings, which compels many of our fellow creatures to pass their lives in an occupation more or less degrading, and in nearly every case offensive (where depravity has not completed its work) to the tastes and preferences of the indi- vidual. Far then from having hostility to any class of men thus condemned to an imfavourable occupation, we would merely no longer by our demands necessitate the existence of such a class, neither degrading any human beings, nor subsequently looking down upon them as inferiors, but giving to such, in the progress of our prin- ciples, an occupation more in accordance with the enlightenment of morals, as well as with their eai’ly preferences. To the almost invariably suggested difficulty of “ what shall be done with the animals ? ” in the practice of our system, we simply direct the attention to the fact, that as the disuse of the flesh of animals as food must necessarily be progressive, the difficulty here presented would be as progressively obviated,-—a less demand ever inducing a diminished supply—till the number of cattle would be reduced, as is already the case with certain classes of animals, which are not consumed as food, and which still do not exist in inconvenient numbers. On the objections raised from the wants of society as to various articles of commercial demand, produced as results of the slaughter of animals for food, such as leather, fur, and various other articles, we have simply to remark, that these are merely questions of demand and supply, which the necessities of the time ^vill of themselves com- pletely settle. Already have we, in the limited demand set up for various articles, felt, gutta percha, and india-rubber, tending to super- sede the use of the skins of animals; and as soon as the demand is more generally raised for other substitutes of this nature, will the sup- ply as certainly foUow, just as has been demonstrated by the interest- ing illustration of the sequence of supply to demand in connection with the Penny Postage system. The quills of the goose’s wing formerly supplied the letter-witing world in the heavy postage sys-

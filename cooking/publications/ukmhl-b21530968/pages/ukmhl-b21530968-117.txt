SAUCES. 59 No. 20G.—Batter used ix Frying Vegetables. Two eggs; quarter of a pound of floiu', and one tea-cupful of water. Beat the eggs with the flour till quite smooth, adding the water, and season with pepper and salt. It should be rather thick, or it will not adlicrc to the vegetables. No. 207.—Browning. Put two ounces of powdered white sugar into a saucepan, over a slow fire ; when beginning to melt, stir it with a wooden spoon till getting black; set it in a rather cool oven, upon a trevet, for about twenty minutes; pour a pint of cold water upon it, and let it dissolve. Keep it in small bottles in a cool, but dry place, to use as required. It will not keep more than a few weeks. No. 208.—Oiled or Clarified Butter. Put any quantity of butter in a clean saucepan over a clear slow fire; watch it carefully, and when melted, take off the scum from the top, let it stand two or three minutes to settle; then poui’ the cleai' butter through a fine sieve into a basin, leaving the sediment at the bottom of the pan. Butter, thus purified, will supply the place of olive oil, and is fre- quently preferred, either for salads or frying. No. 209.—Brown Thickening. Put the butter, which should be either fresh or clarified, into a saucepan, over a slow, clear fire; when melted, stir in with a wooden spoon two ounces of browned flour, constantly stirring it till quite smooth, and of a yellowish light brown. This must be done very carefully and patiently; if it be put on too hot a fire, and done too quickly, it will become bitter, or if it should have any bmmt smell or taste, it wiU spoil every thing it is put into; a large table-spoon- ful will generally be sufficient to thicken a quart of sauce. Keep it covered in an earthem jar for use; it will keep well a fortnight in summer, and longer in winter.

XU INTRODUCTION, more generally presented than any other; and the statement that man has got an arrangement of teeth intermediate between those of the herbivora on the one hand, and the carnivora on the other, has led to the strange conclusion that man was destined to consume both flesh and vegetable products, the strength of the argument depending on a comparison of the teeth and the intestinal canal of man with those of the herbivora and carnivora, to the latter of which they have been said most to approximate. Men are prone, in then examination of this question, in which the appetite is concerned, to attempt to reason from their likings and practice, instead of taking nature alone as their standard, and being ready, in the impartial view of the facts she presents, to convict themselves, in case of need, of having departed from the natural and best food of man. It is quite true, that the internal structm-e, and the teeth of man, indicate that he is an animal different, and intermediate in his conformation in most respects to the classes of animals consuming herbage only on the one hand, and flesh solely on the other. But whilst the mistaken process of measuring man from the crown of the head to the feet has been resorted to, by way of com- parison as to the proportionate length of the intestinal canal with those of the two tribes of animals above mentioned, which are measm-ed from the head to the termination of the spine only (thus making approximate in his physiological structure to the condi- tion of the flesh-eating animals), the broad fact has been altogether overlooked, that, taking man as an intermediate animal, there is an intermediate character of food which precisely suits the vaidous organs of mastication and assimilation which have been considered as the standai-d of comparison, and that this diet consists of fruits, roots, grain, and vegetables. An impartial view of the question, therefore, presents man as an independent species of animal, with a specific character of food in relation to his physical constitution, altogether different from herbage on the one hand, or flesh on the other; and when the compai'isons instituted between him and other animals are fairly carried out, the intestinal canal is not merely six or seven times the length of his body, but twelve times, lending to the conclusion, in this as in other respects, that he is a fruit and gi-ain eating animal, closely approximating in his physical constitution to the Simiaj, a tribe of animals subsisting entirely on fruits, roots, and gram, and provided with teeth similar to those of man, the principal differ-

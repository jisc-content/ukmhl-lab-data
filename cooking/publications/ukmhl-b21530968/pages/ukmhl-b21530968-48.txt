xlvi VEGETARIAN PRACTICE. In order to meet tlie wants of these various classes, it will be con- veuieut to describe at least three styles of Cookery, and to make such remarks as to their modification as will secure an easy adaptation of Vcgetai’ian practice to those circumstances which these styles may not completely comprehend. The First Style is a system of diet composed entmely of fruits, farinacea, and vegetables, and will tend to illustrate the degree of simplicity and economy attainable in Vegetarian habits, without sac- rificing the proper enjoyment of food ; whilst it will show, to some extent, the resources which nature so abundantly provides for man in the direct productions of the soil. The Second Style is likewise a system of diet principally com- posed of fruits, farinacea, and vegetables, bnt with the addition of milk and eggs. The Third Style includes a greater variety of preparations than the preceding ones. TVith an explanation of each of these different styles, and the modifications of which they are susceptible, we hope to meet the varied tastes and circumstances of our readers, whilst this arrange- ment will prevent those unfavourable comparisons which are some- times made as to cost and preparation, between the plainest description of ordinary mixed diet, and Vegetarian Cookery. But if comparisons be made, we would suggest that the simplest form of Vegetarian diet be compared with the simplest form of mixed diet, and the corres- ponding styles of both systems being thus regarded, we doubt not that in every instance Vegetarian diet wiU be found to be the most economical as well as the most agreeable in preparation, and calculated to produce the ’most gratifying effect on all the senses concerned in the appreciation of food. THE FIRST STYLE. Although this is the most simple style, and excludes all the pro- ductions of the animal kingdom, it comprehends a great variety of food; and it having been shown by the facts of chemistry that the nutritive principle is identical in vegetable and animal substances (“ Introduction,” p. xviii), this style ^vill be found consistent with the

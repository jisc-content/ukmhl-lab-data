Quarter of a pound of arrow-root; half a pound of flour; quarter of a pound of sugar; one ounce of butter; one egg; a small tea- spoonful of baking-powder, and quarter of a pint of new milk. Boll the arrow-root, and rub the baking-powder quite smooth; mix well with the flour, adding the sugar, previously rolled, to take out the lumps; rub in the butter well, mixing all together with the egg, well beaten, and the milk ; knead it into a stiff smooth paste, beating it with the paste roller, or rolling it quarter of an hour; then roll very thin as much as is convenient, and stamp it all over with a block set with brass wires or pins; cut the cakes with a tin paste-cutter, and bake in a moderately hot oven. No. 536.—Butter Biscuits. One pound of flour; one egg; quarter of a pound of butter, and a small tea-spoonful of baking-powder.

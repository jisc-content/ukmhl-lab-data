PRESEKVED FRUIT, ETC. 185 pounds of fruit, allow half a pint of red, or red and white cnrrant- juice; set the fniit on the fire, with the currant-juice, and boil twenty minutes; then add sugar of etjual weight with the fruit, and boil on a slow fire nearly half an hour, taking off any scum tliat may arise; when the jam looks clear, try a tea-spoouful on a plate, and if it will set it is sufficiently done. No. 627.—Strawberry Jam. ^Veigh some ripe scarlet strawberries; bruise them, and add a little juice of red currants; allow twelve ounces of sugar to each pound of fruit; set it over a clear fire; boil forty minutes, and pour into sweetmeat pots. No. 628.—Apple Jelly. Pare, and ent a peck of apples; put them with the rinds of two lemons, pared thin, into a pan, with sufficient water to cover them, and let them boil till reduced to a pulp; then strain through a flannel jeUy-bag, and when the juice is quite clear, boil it half an hour, add- ing the juice of four lemons, and the sugar, allowing one pound to each pint of juice, carefully skimming it the whole time. Pour it into small jars, and when cold, cover them in the usual w'ay. The colour of the jelly may be greatly improved by adding a few drops of burnt sugar, which may be done by holding a hot Italian heater over the jelly; applying the sugar to it (so that as it dis- solves it may drop into the jelly), and stirring it well. No. 629.—Apple Jelly. Take out the stalks and cut out the blossom end of seven pounds of good ripe baking apples, without paring or taking out the cores; cut them in pieces, and boil or bake in two quarts of water till reduced to a pulp; pour it into a jelly bag, placed near the fire; when clear, allow eight ounces of loaf sugar to each pound of fruit, the strained juice of a lemon, and the rind finely grated; then boil the whole till it becomes a tolerably stiff jelly; strain it again through a bag or a piece of coarse thin muslin, and pour it into moulds or jai’s.

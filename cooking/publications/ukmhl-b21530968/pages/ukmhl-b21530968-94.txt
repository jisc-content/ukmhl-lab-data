VEGETABLES. All green vegetables should be as fresh as possible. Put them inlo cold water with some salt in it, for about ten minutes, to clear from soil or insects. If not quite fresh, let them remain in the water some time longer; drain in a colander, and put them into a pan with plenty of boiling water, adding salt, and a small piece of soda; cover the pan till boiling, but not aftenvards; then boil quickly, and cai'efuUy remove any scum which may rise. Do not allow them to j’emain in the water after they are done, hut immediately drain them in a colander, and finish each kind as directed in the receipts. Peas and spinach do not require so much water as most other green vegetables, hut only just sufficient to cover them. Cauliflowers and hrocoli require especial care in boiling, as the flow'cr is easily broken and their appearance spoiled; boil them quickly for a few minutes, and then moderately till tender, which may be easily ascertained by trying the stem with a fork. All vessels used iu cooking vegetables should be particularly clean. Soft, is preferable to hard water in cooking all kinds of vegetables. No. 112.—Jerusalem Artichokes. Wash and brush the artichokes, but do not peel them; boil them as potatoes; drain and peel them, and serve hot in a vegetable dish, with butter sauce poured over them. They may also be boiled and mashed as turnips, with a little cream, adding pepper and salt. No. 113.—Boiled Beet-root. Wash and brush the roots, being careful to avoid breaking off the fibres, to prevent the juice escaping, and spoiling the appear- ance and flavour; put them into a pan of boiling water, adding salt, and a small piece of soda; let them boil from one to two hours, according*to size; put them into cold water and rub off the skin

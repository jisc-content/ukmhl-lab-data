One pound of either white or brown flour; three quarters of an ounce of prepared ginger; one pound of brown sugar; three quarters of a pound of treacle ; quarter of a pound of butter; one egg; quar- ter of an ounce of baking-powder, and one ounce of candied lemon or orange. Mix the baking-powder, ginger, and sugar, well with the flour; then add the treacle, warmed, a tea- cupful of water, the egg, well beaten, the candied fruit, and the butter, melted; mix the whole well together; put it in a baking tin, spreading it about an inch thick all over, and bake immediately.

Three quarters of a pound of flour; one pound of sugar; quarter of a pound of butter; half a pound of treacle; a little grated lemon- peel ; half a tea-spoonful of baking-powder; half an ounce of pre- pared ginger; one egg, and a little mace. Warm the butter and treacle together till the butter is melted; add the sugar, and stir it till dissolved in the butter and treacle; rub the baking-powder into the flour, adding the ginger, lemon-peel, and the egg, well beaten; mix all the ingredients together; set it in a cool place for several hours; then drop it in small pieces on tins, warmed and well buttered, and bake in a moderately quick oven. When baked, and after standing a short time, and whilst warm, roll up the snaps lightly, the upper side outwards. As this gingerbread is best when crisp, only a small quantity should be baked at once. The paste keeps well in a covered jar.

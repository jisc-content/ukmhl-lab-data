INTRODUCTION. xli have here little to say, sinee, if the preceding features of our argu- ment be established, this must almost follow as a necessary consequence. It seems to us that it is only because man, in his depravity, perverts the order and ends of Providence, that any doubt can be experienced as to the adaptation of the external world to the philosophical and merciful principles inherent in man’s nature. It is sometimes argued that Vegetarianism is impracticable, from the supposition that the Esquimaux, and some other inhabitants of the earth, cannot adopt it; but wo have no right to reason from savage or depraved courses of life, back to the relations of man’s in- tellectual and moral nature, to condemn the teaching these would of themselves prescribe j since these states of disadvantage and unhap- piness are but the results of wandering from the original condition of man’s being; and we have a right to say, that had man never fallen from the order of his nature, he would never have been found in the various phases of degraded humanity, but would have maintained and carried with him in all passages of his existence, the peaceful resources which would have enabled him to live in accordance with his true natural constitution. The virtue of this reform, however, like that of all others, is best arrived at, not by the force of reasoning, but by the practice of the System. It is thus that Vegetarianism, from whatever motive it may have been adopted, commimicates to the individual an intuitive per- ception in accordance and identity with the higher principles of nature. This perhaps accoimts for the fact, that those who have pursued the system but for a time, whether from accidental circumstances, or from conviction of its importance, commonly recur to their experience of that period with evident satisfaction. And this is natural, considering that the system is established in truth; and it is not suprising that to have carried it out only to a limited extent, should thus give that satisfaction which invariably attends adherence to the moral and up- ward-tending courses of life. In this light,—the result of experi- ence—one by one, do the difficulties to the prevalence of the practice in the world disappear; till, from adherence to the system from limited or inferior motives in the first instance, the full breadth and importance of the question come at length to be recognized and appreciated. We would not be imdcrstood to speak of the good of adherence to this system, otherwise than as the result of obedience to laws in inti- c

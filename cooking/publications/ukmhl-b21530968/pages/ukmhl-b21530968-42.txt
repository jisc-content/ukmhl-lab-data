/ xl INTRODUCTION. ■when they had painful and compunctious feelings to contend ■with, ere they became hardened to the condition of ruthless destroyers of the animal creation. We are so deeply assured that the system for which we would raise our voice, is identified with the instincts and moral nature of man, that we would venture to rest the complete change of opinion on this subject in the well-ordered of society, on the full perception of the facts of the case, and especially in all who are most endowed with the high moral and intellectual nature of man. Come with us, we would say, and trace the treatment of the ox and the sheep through all their varied stages of cruelty, from the peaceful glade where we behold them in a comparative state of nature, through all tne horrors of railway transit and market cruelties, to the “ den of infamy,” where the acts of providing flesh for the table are perpetrated; and then witness the cutting up and exposiue of the various parts of these animals, subse- quently tracing them through the domestic operations brought to bear to convert them to the ordinarily approved dishes of the table; and we are con^vinced that the adult, as well as the child, would feel repugnance, and would ask the question—“ Is this necessary ? ”—if the understanding did not at once accord with the instincts, and declare for a fruit and farinaceous diet in all its purity and beauty, in which the intellect and moral feelings combined with the instincts of nature, can alone rejoice. Again, we would contend that it is because we do not reason upon our dietetic practices, that our habits are utterly at variance with the nature of man. The butcher even can acknowledge the offences of society in these things, in being compelled to minister to depraved ap- petites ; “ I would it were penal to kill lambs,” says one of this class; and another, in repugnance at the features of his vocation, in denoun- cing the slaughter of that beautiful animal, the type of innocence and meekness, exclaims,—“the lamb, sir, dies harder than any other animal; it sobs like a child when stuck with the knife, and continues so to do, ns long as the blood flows, or any sign of life remains.” It is thus that we contend for the principle with which wo started, that our system is established in the natural constitution of man, and is essential to the accordance of his animal, intellectual, and moral being. Our fui-thcr remarks have reference to the other position we hold, that the Vegetarian system of diet is essential to the harmonious relation intended to exist between man and the external world. AVe

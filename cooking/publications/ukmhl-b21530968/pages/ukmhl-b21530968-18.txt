Wo see, however, notwithstanding this allowance, how erroneous is the impression which has been entertained as to the high nutritive value of the flesh of animals, and the little waste consequent upon its use. Bread has ever been, and will ever continue to be, the “ staff of life,” notwithstanding the popular estimation which would, if possible, in times past, at least, have adopted flesh as this standards and on a comparison of the composition of various articles of vege- table food with beef, it cannot but excite surprise to see that whilst the solid matter of peas, beans, lentils, and oat-meal, should range between 84 and 91 per cent of solid matter and from 16 to 9 only of water, the lean and fat together of flesh contain 36^ lb of solid matter, whilst all the rest, amounting to 63y+j lb, is merely water. In relation to tbe leading principles, however, already enunciated as the flesh-forming and heat-forming principles of food, we see on reference to the above table, that whilst 1001b of the flesh of animals can supply at most 21^1b of flesh principle, and 14^ lb of heat principle to the body, peas, beans, and lentils, respectively, supply

VEGETAHIAN PRACTICE. SECOND STYLE. The transition from mixed to Vegetarian diet is by no means diffieult. We believe that farinaeeous food, (of which bread, “the staff of life” is the principal,) together with vegetables and fruit, already constitutes by far the greater portion of the food of our population, flesh forming but a small addition, rather than any large proportion of the aliment consumed. Tn this style this small addi- tion to fruits, farinacea, and vegetables is superseded by dishes of a savoury character, and it will be seen, therefore, that the adoption of this style by persons accustomed to the moderate use of flesh, will involve only a change as to one or two dishes, whilst the other appliances of the table may remain the same. We proceed however to offer a few suggestions as to the provision adapted for each meal. BEEAKTAST. In addition to the articles mentioned for Breakfast, page xlviii. Fried Beet-root, No. 115, and Boiled Eggs, may be used. DINNEK. The foUowingr Bills of Fare are presented merely as suggestions ; by which it will be seen, from which divisions of the book, the prin- cipal dishes should be selected, and it will be only necessary to observe the same rule in producing a greater variety.

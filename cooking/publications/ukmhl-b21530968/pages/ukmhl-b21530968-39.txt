I INTRODUCTION. XXXvii and death ; that flesh is tainted, in numerous instances, with various diseases; and lastly, having met several objections, and given a brief account of the experience of nations and individuals in all time, it will now bo our duty to endeavour to unite this body of fact and ex- perience with the principle that the Vegetarian system is established in the natural constitution of man, as comprised in the instincts of an animal nature, with the endowments of the intellectual and moral being. If any force be acknowledged in the arguments hitherto presented, it will be found to have relation to the intellectual aspects of the question; in which we trust that the facts adduced, and the reflection to which they necessarily lead, will tend to show that there is so far accordance between man’s faculties as a reasoning being and the Vegetarian system of diet. It further, however, belongs to this por- tion of our subject, to point out the relation that exists between the instinctive nature and the moral feelings, and thus to support and confirm the conclusions of the intellect, in favour of a diet altogether apai't from the flesh and blood of the animal creation. Although it is admitted that man originally subsisted on fruits and other products of the earth, it is sometimes argued that he has since become reconstituted, and is now adapted to the consumption of flesh, as well as vegetables. We have before called attention to the grave error of confounding the adaptability conferred upon man, with the principle of adaptation, which stamps upon man, as well as all other creations of the Deity, a precise relation to external circumstances. We at once acknowledge the force of habit as recognized in what is popularly designated “ second nature.” But this, as truly and gra- phically expressed, is “ second nature,” and presents nothing but the difficulty of change of habit, to prove that the adaptation of man to certain circumstances in himself and the external world, remains ever the same ; and since any habit may be a “ second nature,” a change of customs can again convert the system to that higher and natural state, which ever secures the greatest happiness, because in accordance ■with the great principles by which the world is governed, and which are as unchangeable as the Creator himself. In searching out the instincts of man in relation to food and drink, wo are beset with many difficulties which are never found in relation to the inferior animal creation; but here, even, notwithstanding many years departure from sound principles of moral and physiological

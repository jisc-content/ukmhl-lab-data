INTRODUCTION. XXVll With the above remarks, we leave this subject to the consideration of our readers, as one of importance to every class of the consiuners of “butchers’ meat.” The pernicious consequences of inattention to this subject, are already identified with diseases, and tendencies to disease, and may, in many cases, account for the virulent effects of small-pox, fevers, and Asiatic cholera; whilst a fruit and farina- ceous diet, seems, from the experience collected upon the subject, to render the Vegetarian free from the danger and even the fear of an attack.* It may perhaps here be well, briefly to notice a few popular objec- tions, almost invariably presented on a first acquaintance with the Vegetarian system. It is supposed that a diet apart from the flesh and blood of animals is intended as an offensive interference with the prevailing customs of society, and by a few even that it is at- tempted to denounce the consumption of flesh as food as in some degree sinful. These objections are, however, altogether unfounded; inasmuch as the advocates of the Vegetarian system, though they base their arguments upon the principle, that man’s natural and best food must be derived, in its leading characteristics at least, from the Vegetable Xiugdom, and be altogether apai't from the flesh of ani- mals, leave untouched the freedom of individuals to accept or not the practice thus presented for the consideration of the reflective. The true spirit of Vegetarianism, is benevolence; and has its mission in informing the understanding and appealing to the moral feelings of the world, in relation to man’s external habits, but throws not one reproach at the conscientious followers of the mixed diet system, who sec no force in its reasoning, or prefer to maintain their ad- herence to the more general practice of society. In regard to the apparent opposition of the system to all engaged in supplying the flesh of animals for the table, we take leave to say that there is nothing more in this than there ever must be in the * As far as our information goes, which embraces communications upon the subject from great numbers of Vegetarians, as well as the results of inquiry both in this country and America, no case of Asiatic cholera has hitherto occurred amongst the members of the Vegetarian Society. It is true, that cholera has sometimes entered the families of Vegetarians, but its attacks have, in such cases, been confined to those members of the family who were not A'egetarians, but adherents of the mixed diet system.

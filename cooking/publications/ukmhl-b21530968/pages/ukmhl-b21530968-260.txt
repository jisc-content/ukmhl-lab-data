VKGETAKIAN COOKERY. 202 No. 689.—To KEEP Lemon-juice. Keep the lemons in a cool place several days; then cut them, and squeeze the juice into a basin; strain it through thin, and afterwards through thick muslin, and pour it into small phials, perfectly clean and dry; fill them so near the top as only to admit half a tea-spoon- ful of olive oil into each ; cork the bottles, and set them upright in a cool place. When wanted for use, open only such a sized bottle as win be used in a day or two; wind a bit of clean cotton round a skewer and dip it in so as to remove the oU. The juice will then be as fme as when first bottled. No. 690.—Everton Toepy. Two pounds of brown sugar ; three quarters of a pound of butter, and twenty drops of essence of lemon. Warm, and rub a pan with butter; put in the sugar with five table- spoonfuls of water, and boil it over a slow fire till it becomes a smooth, thick syrup ; then stir in the butter, and when it has boiled about three quarters of an hour, drop a little into a cup of cold water, and if it become hard, it is enough; stir in the essence of lemon, and pour it about half or three quarters of an inch thick, on dishes wanned and buttered. Essence of ginger may be used instead of essence of lemon. No. 691.—Treacle Toffy. Rub a pan with butter; pour into it tw'o pounds of treacle, and boil it gently, about an hour; add a few drops of essence of pepper- mint, and pour it on dishes, warmed and buttered. Before the toffy is poured out, try a little on a plate, and when cool, if it will easily come off, it is sufficiently done.

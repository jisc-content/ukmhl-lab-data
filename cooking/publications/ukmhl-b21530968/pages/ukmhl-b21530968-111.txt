SAUCES. 53 flour and milk, well mixed, and about a quarter of a pint of water; shake it round the same way over the fire till at the point of boiling; let it stand one or two minutes off the fire; boil it up, and it will then be ready. It should be about the thickness of good eream. Milk mixes with the butter much better than water alone. If the butter sauce should be oiled, which it is desirable to avoid, put in a spoonful of cold water, and stir it well with a wooden spoon ; if very much oUed, pour it from one vessel to another, till it becomes right. No. 183.—Butter Sauce. Three ounces of butter; one table-spoonful of flour; three quar- ters of a pint of water; a dessert-spoonful of vinegar; a salt-spoonful of salt, and one-eighth as much fine white pepper. IMix the flour and two oxmees of butter together; set it on the fire in the saucepan with the water, constantly stirring it the same way till at the point of boiling; add the vinegar, salt, and pepper; stir it well, and pass it through a tin strainer; return it into the pan; add an ounce of butter, and stir it till melted over a moderate fire, but do not allow it to boil. No. 184.—Celery Sauce. Two roots of celery; one small onion; one ounce of flour; one ounce of butter, and quarter of a pint of cream. Clean and cut the celery and onion rather small; stew them in a pint of water, till quite tender; stir in the flour and butter, previ- ously mixed together till the butter is quite melted, adding pepper and salt; simmer gently a quarter of an hour; tlien rub it through a tin strainer with a wooden spoon; return it into the pan ; add the cream, and stir it on the fire till it boils. It should be about the same consistency as onion sauce (No. 196). No. 185.—Cream Sauce. Half a pint of cream; one tea-spoonful of arrow-root, and one table-spoonful of milk.

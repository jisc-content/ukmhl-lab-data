We find that the Spartans of Thermopyloi, and the Athleta; of ancient Greece were thus educated; and that the latter were never deterio- rated till they commenced the practice of consuming flesh as food, when they became slothful and stupid.* We find various nations wholly, or in a great measure, carrying out the practice of diet apart from the flesh of animals from generation to generation: as the higher castes of Hindoos, the Burmese, the Chinese, the Japanese, the inlia- bitants of the East Indian Archipelago, of the moimtains of Himalaya^ and of ancient and modern Egypt; in all of which the prevailing practice is Vegetarian in the great mass of the people, condiments of fish only being used in the last named country, associated with the vegetable products which form the basis of their diet. In modern times, we have the experience of the Irish, the Scotch, and the French, as abstainers in the great majority of their numbers from flesh as food, M. Dupin informing us that two-thirds of the population in France live without flesh-meat; whilst McCulloch, in his statistics, shows that even in the city of Glasgow, in 1763, with a population of more than thirty thousand, the slaughter of bullocks for the pubhc markets was a thing wholly unknown. Indeed, the peasantry, and hard workers of all the countries of Europe,—not excepting our own,—are, in the main characteristics of then’ diet, abstainers from the flesh of animals, as in Norway, Sweden, Eussia, Denmark, Poland, Germany, Turkey, Greece, Switzerland, Spain, and Portugal; the bone and muscle of all these countries being built up upon the vegetable products of the earth. As examples presented in the history of individuals, there are many that could be cited, both of ancient and modern times, as PxTH.LGOEAS, Plutarch, Zeno the stoic, Diogenes the cynic, Plato, Epicurus, Proclus, Empedocles, Socion, Quintus Sextus, Apollonius Tyanjsus, Porphtet, and recently, Eitson, Haller, Drs.

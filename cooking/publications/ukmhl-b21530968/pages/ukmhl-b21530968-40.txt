/ SXXviii INTRODUCTION. training, nature, we contend, is ever peeping through tho perverse practices of society in relation to diet, and if attended to, will convict custom of her folly and violation of natural laws. It is thus that the senses of sight, touch, and hearing, less subject to be depraved than the sense of taste, almost invariably speak out, where carefully observed, upon tho subject of the consumption of flesh as food. There is nothing in the sight of the ox or sheep, which, apart from depraved practices, could possibly suggest the idea to man, that they contain within their external covering, food in relation to his stomach, and destined for his consumption. But there is a striking relation be- tween the fruits of the earth and the instincts of man’s nature. The very sight of flesh, even when procured for the table, is offensive both to the eye and the touch; and thus it is, that all undepraved by the practice, feel an instinctive dislike to handle it, unjustly condemning the butcher and the cook to do that which would be most repulsive to their own feelings. In our large cities, in many cases, we even inflict fines for the carrying of butchers’ meat through the streets uncovered ; and whilst our “ Smithfields,” “ Leadenhalls,” and “ Billingsgates” are notorious as public nuisances, our “ Covent Gardens,” and exhi- bitions of fruits and flowers are ever associated with grateful sensa- tions, presenting a contrast in favour of the latter, which all the instinctive feelings of our nature powerfully unite to confirm. The instincts of children, more than those of adults, speak clearly upon this subject; and it is obvious, notwithstanding the force of cus- tom from one generation to another, that tho preferences of children arc for the fruits and farinaceous substances of the table; and where, as in Scotland and some parts of the continent, they are trained to the ago of eight or ten years without any kind of flesh ns food, when first partaken of, it is with loathing; and when they learn to identify it with the living animals familar to them (with that instinct which adults even frequently demonstrate in not being able to consume the flesh of classes of animals with which they have had some peculiar friendly relationship,) it is with the greatest difficulty that this natural repugnance to flesh is overcome. We contend, then, that it is vain to say that the instinctive feelings of man are supplanted by the force of custom; and our faith in the humanities of existence loads us strenuously to contend for the posi- tion, that the slaughter of animals is opposed to the moral nature of man, and that the practice of consuming the bodies of animals, but

rUESEUYED FRUIT, ETC. 187 No. 63 i.—Raspberry Jeely. Put the fruit into a preserving pan, or into a jar, set in a pan of water on the fire; when near boiling, strain earefully through a hair sieve; to each pint of clear juice, allow fourteen ounces of sugar, stirring it off the fire till the sugar is dissolved; then boil twenty minutes, aud pour it into jelly pots, or glasses. Gooseberry Jelly may be made in precisely the same way, al- lowing one pound of sugar to each pint of juice. As only the clear juice is required for jelly, the fruit may be used for puddings, adding sugar, aud boiling a little. No. 633.—Apple Cheese. To two pounds of apples, pared, and eut as for a pie, add one pound of sugar, the juice and grated rind of a lemon, and a little water; put all together into a pan; cover, and set it over the fire till the apples are reduced to a pulp, turning the pan occasionally; let it boU twenty minutes, stirring constantly, and pour it into small moulds. No. 636.—Damson Cheese. Pick some ripe damsons, and put them into a pan, with suffieient water to cover them; when soft, drain, aud rub them through a sieve whilst hot; put the juice and pulp into a pan, with fine powdered sugar, allowing one pound of sugar to two pounds of fruit, aud let it boil over a moderate fire till quite stiff; it will require boiling three hours, and should be constantly stirred, to prevent it burning; pour it into moulds, or cups, aud in one or two days, cover them in the usual way. No. 637.—Green Gooseberry Cheese.

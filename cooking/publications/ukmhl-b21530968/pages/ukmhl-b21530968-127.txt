rUDDINGS. In the preparation of puddings it is essential to have all the ingre- dients perfeetly good of their kind. If there be any doubt of the freshness of eggs, they should always be broken separately in a eup, to prevent any being needlessly wasted, as one bad egg would render all the rest with which it was mixed, useless. Batter puddings, when mixed, should be jâ€™iissed through a tin strainer, or coarse sieve. Eggs, when used for other puddings, should be strained after they are beaten. The basins, or moulds in which puddings are to be boiled, should be buttered; the pudding then poured in, and after having a cloth tied tightly over it, be put into the pan immediately. When a cloth only is used, it should be dipped in hot water, and when squeezed dry, be spread over a basin and dredged with flour; the pudding should then be poured in, and if batter, be tied closely, but if bread, it is requisite to allow a little more room. The water should boU quickly, when the pudding is put in, and be kept con- stantly boiling the whole time. \Mien the pudding is taken out of the pan, it should immediately be dipped in cold water; this will chill the outside, and allow the cloth to be removed without injuring the surface. The most convenient way to dish a pudding is to place it with the cloth in a basin ; then open the cloth, and lay the face of the dish upon the pudding; turn the whole over, take off the basin, and re- move the cloth. All puddings should be boiled in plenty of water, so as to allow them sufficient room to move freely, and prevent the ingredients separating. When a pudding is boiled in a cloth, a plate should be placed at the bottom of the pan, but when a basin or mould is used, this precau- tion is not requisite.

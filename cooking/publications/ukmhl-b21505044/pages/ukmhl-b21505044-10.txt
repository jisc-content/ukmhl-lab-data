July 31, 1862. R. M. IV PREFACE. From internal evidence it would seem that the author of this poem was a native of North-West Lancashire, for we tind the same peculiarities which have been pointed out by Mr. Robson in the Romances edited by him for the Camden Society, viz. the plurals of Nouns in -us and pas- sive participles in -ud, or -ut, to which may be added the forms schyuy schun (= shall) and wyn, loymi, (will) which I have not met with elsewhere. The usual Northumbrian grammatical forms occur, as tas for takes; tone and tother for that one and that other; -s as the ending of all the persons (Singular and Plural) in the Present Tense Indie. Mood, and as the sign of the 2â€œ^^ Person, Imperative Mood; and -a7id as the termination of the Present Participle. For all words enclosed in brackets I alone am responsible. No alteration has been made in the text of the MS. without some acknowledgment in a foot-note.

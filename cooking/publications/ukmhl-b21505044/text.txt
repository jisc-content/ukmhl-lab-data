COPIED AND EDITED FROM THE SLOANE MS. 1986 j BY RICHARD MORRIS, AUTHOR OF “the ETYMOLOGY OF LOCAL NAMES ”, MEMBER OF THE PHILOLOGICAL SOCIETY. PUBLISHED FOR THE PHILOLOGICAL SOCIETY BT A. ASHER & CO., BERLIN. 1862.i » 1 , J-. !. t I 1 ,^?4 I -TidH *.J.. I J UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, LEEDS. ys’va* tThe following curious poem on Cookery is now first printed from a transcript of the Sloane MS. 1986, where it occurs as an appendix to the “Boke of Curtasye”'. It is written in a Northern dialect of the XVcentury, pro- bably not much earlier than the time of Henry VI. The author of the poem furnishes us with an appropriate English title in the opening of the work, where he speaks of his subject as “The Slyjtes of Cure”, or, as expressed in more modern English, “The Art of Cookery”. Though the poem professes to be somewhat comprehensive, and treats of a great variety of dishes under the titles of Potages, broths, roasted meats, baked meats, sauces and ^petecure’, it is still far from containing an account of all the ancient dishes, upon the preparation of which the cooks of old prided them- selves so much, as may be seen upon comparing this poem with the tracts upon Old English Cookery contained in Warner’s ‘Antiquitates Culinariae’ and in the ‘Collection of Ordinances and Regulations for the government of the Royal House- hold’. ^ Some knowledge of the composition of these dishes is rendered necessary by the constant allusions to them in our early English Metrical Romances, which give the poem an Archaeological as well as a Philological value. * Edited by Mr. Halliwell for the Percy Society, * Referred to at p. 20 n. as “ Ord. and Reg.”July 31, 1862. R. M. IV PREFACE. From internal evidence it would seem that the author of this poem was a native of North-West Lancashire, for we tind the same peculiarities which have been pointed out by Mr. Robson in the Romances edited by him for the Camden Society, viz. the plurals of Nouns in -us and pas- sive participles in -ud, or -ut, to which may be added the forms schyuy schun (= shall) and wyn, loymi, (will) which I have not met with elsewhere. The usual Northumbrian grammatical forms occur, as tas for takes; tone and tother for that one and that other; -s as the ending of all the persons (Singular and Plural) in the Present Tense Indie. Mood, and as the sign of the 2“^^ Person, Imperative Mood; and -a7id as the termination of the Present Participle. For all words enclosed in brackets I alone am responsible. No alteration has been made in the text of the MS. without some acknowledgment in a foot-note.Now speke I wele a lytul more Of craft, iwys, pat tase grete lore In court, pat men calles cure, pat most be don in prinne degre; pis hasteler, pasteler, and potagere, And jet po scoler pat foloes in fere, Fyrst to jow I wylle schawe po poyntes of cure, al by rawe *, Of Potage, hastery, and bakun mete.

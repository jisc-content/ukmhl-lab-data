The interest of £1,000 {£1 per week) is little enough for a family who, while practising wise economy, have yet been in comfortable circumstances. The sorrow which results from the loss of the husband and father becomes unspeakably bitter when the means of obtaining even the necessaries of life have gone with him.

An insurance against fire also, for ^100, would not cost much more than a couple of shillings a year; and this sum would be a great help in case-of a misfortune of the kind.

Casserole Cookerp. Casserole cook- ery may be justly termed cooking in stone or earthenware â€”which, al- though very ancient, is be- coming exceed- MARMITE. ingly popular at the present time. Kitchen pottery fills an important mission in the present-day cuisine, for cooking per- formed in an earthenware fireproof pot has many advantages over that performed in a metal pot. A kitchen equipped with fireproof stone- ware casseroles in plenitude for the various kinds of its capable service may be truly described as having an odour of purity and a fascination with a sense of cleanliness. Earthenware or stoneware pots were un- questionably the first used for cooking pur- poses, and all that the substitution of other materials could offer in their stead, through invention and discovery, such as copper, brass, iron, steel, nickel, tin, aluminium and even silver, which compete with them in adornment and service, have failed to depreciate the stoneware pots, or casseroles as they are more commonly known, from use, or degrade their usefulness in any re- markable degree.

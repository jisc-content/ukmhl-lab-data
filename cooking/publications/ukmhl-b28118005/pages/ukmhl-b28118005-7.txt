Preface. This little Manual is designed to show the culinary possibilities of a chafing dish, which is looked upon by many as one of those delightful toys which make cook- ing a real pleasure. It also shows the handy use to which earthenware casseroles and marmites can be adopted in cookery. The former is intended chiefly for things that are quickly prepared, whilst the latter, “ casserole cookery,” is more especially adapted for so-called long or slow cooking processes. Cooking by the help of a chafing dish affords great pleasure, and at times amuse- ment, though it has a solid basis of useful- ness, for there are some decided advan- tages to be gained in being able to prepare dainty dishes quickly for either breakfast, luncheon, or supper. Many housewives take a real delight in chafing-dish cookery for ordinary purposes, whilst for sick-room cookery a chafing-dish will prove a most valuable friend, for there are many dishes suitable for invalids which can be prepared with its aid. The number of dishes which can be cooked in a chafing dish or in a casserole is almost endless. The collection of recipes contained in this book, which have been specially com- piled, will, it is hoped, meet the long-felt want so often expressed by many of my colleagues and friends, for whose benefit this volume has been published.

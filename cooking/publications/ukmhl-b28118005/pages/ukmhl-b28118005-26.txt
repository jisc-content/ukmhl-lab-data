Devilled Lobster. (Romara a la Oiable.) Remove the meat from a medium-sized lobster and chop it finely; put it in a chafing dish with enough bechamel or other white sauce to moisten, season with pepper and salt. Re-heat and add a dessert-spoonful of mustard mixed with a little brandy or sherry. Have ready some rounds of toasted bread, butter them and spread them thickly with the hot lobster mixture, and serve. Salmon Omdet. (Omelette de Saumon.) Free four ounces cooked salmon from skin and bones, and fiake it finely, heat it up in a little butter and white sauce, just enough to moisten. Season with salt and pepper, and keep hot. Make an omelet as directed for “ Oyster Omelet,” omitting the oysters and the oyster liquor. When ready to fold, put in the hot salmon mixture, fold in the ends and shape neatly. Serve hot. Curried Crab. Remove the meat from a good-sized crab, including that of the claws, sprinkle it with a very little mustard and Krona pepper, and put it on a plate. Melt an ounce or more of butter in the chafing dish, add a peeled and finely chopped shallot, and half an apple, peeled, cored and chopped. Fry for a few minutes, and then add the crab, and fry for another five minutes. Drain off the fat from the crab mixture, adding a gill of curry sauce, and allow the whole to simmer gently for fifteen minutes. Serve hot with some well boiled rice.

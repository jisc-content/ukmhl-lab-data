for a late supper, i.e., for so-called supper parties, it may also be utilised at luncheon, breakfast, or the time for making any kind of dish which must be served ala minute,'* that is, immediately after it is cooked. A chafing dish generally consists of four parts : the framework in which the lamp is set, the lamp, the hot-water pan with side handles which rest on the framework, and the blazer in which the food is cooked. A fiagon is a dainty adjunct for filling the lamp without removing it from the table ; but in its absence a jug can be used. The fiagon is recommended because when corked it prevents the alcohol from escaping. Cheap alcohol should not be used in the lamp ; the best is none too good, for it will not smoke or smut. A polished wooden or bone spoon and a chafing-dish fork are necessary, the former for stirring the food, the latter for serving it out. These articles have long handles with broad bowls. It is best to place the chafing dish on a tray so as to prevent any danger of a flaring flame igniting an unprotected table cloth. The tray, fiagon, hot plates, fork and spoon should be put on the side of the tray. The hot-water pan must be always used where slow cooking is required for creams, sauces, and rarebits. For frying, broiling, remove the hot-water pan and place the pan near to the flame, which is done by raising the lamp on a standard supplied for this purpose. Have the lamp filled with good alcohol, and closely covered until ready to light.

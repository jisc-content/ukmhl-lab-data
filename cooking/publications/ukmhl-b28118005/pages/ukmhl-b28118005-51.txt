47 This style of cooking is known as “ en casserole,” which in reality is the French name for stew-pan, and means that the dish is served in the vessel in which it has been cooked. Fish, meat, poultry and game can be cooked in this way ; soups, especially those of the pot-au-feu kind, are cooked and served in marmites, which are another type of fireproof cooking pots. Fruit which needs to be carefully stewed is ex- cellent if cooked in this ware. For brais- ing and stewing this kind of cookery has really no equal, and there are many other dishes cooked “ en casserole ” which have proved to be so superior in taste and flavour that one had better abandon them alto- gether than attempt to serve them without the aid of this useful kind of cooking utensil. Anyone who has adopted the use of these casseroles, marmites, braising or bak- ing dishes will readily admit that the merits claimed for them are in no way exaggerated, for by their use the cook flnds in them a most valuable assistant to ensure genuine, wholesome cookery. Petite tnarmite. This dish, which forms the standard din- ner item of the average French household, is best prepared in an earthenware mar- mite stock-pot, for it is an acknowledged fact that a petite marmite cooked in stone- ware is far more palatable, and for this reason this mode of cooking is especially recommended. Petite marmite is so typi- cally French that no other equivalent has as yet been found. It is a kind of soup usually served in little earthenware pots, which just hold enough for one person, but in some places it is sent to table in the actual pot in which it is cooked.

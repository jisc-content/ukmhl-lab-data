46 The homeliest form, or shall I call it the most wholesome form of cooking very many articles of food, is that done in the earthen jar, pot or baking dish. The cause of this is not far to seek. Besides being unsurpassable for many purposes, earthenware or stoneware casseroles are light and clean to use, they impart no dis- agreeable flavour to the most delicate of viands, they are handy to use, the actual cooking is effected slowly and more evenly, consequently less fuel is used in cooking. They are not so liable to burn food in cook- ing. They do not tarnish, rust, or stain, and do not, therefore affect the contents cooked in them. Besides being handy and ever ready for use, earthenware flreproof casseroles, baking or braising pans, and dishes are inexpensive to buy, and if proper care is bestowed they may last as long as metal pans. Food cooked in earthenware or stone- ware casseroles is usually served up in the pots or pans in which it is cooked; this is convenient as well as economical. All that is needed is to place the cooking pot or pan on a dish and send it to the dining room, thus ensuring it being served hotâ€”which is another point in favour of casserole cookery. This ware is also ornamental, and as it is used in the very best establish- ments where it is decidedly fashionable as a means of cooking and serving food. There are various kinds of these flre- proof casseroles, etc., in use. Those made in brown earthenware are considered the best, others are white or yellow inside and brown or green outside ; the white china gratin dishes, souffl6 cases and ramakins come under the same heading.

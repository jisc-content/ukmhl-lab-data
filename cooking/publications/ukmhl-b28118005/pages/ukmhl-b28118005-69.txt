This is an exceed- ingly popular lun- cheon or supper dish for those who appreciate an old- fashioned stew.^ Either mutton, beef or pork can be used for it, the formula of preparation being the same. Wash, peel and slice thickly one pound of potatoes, peel and cut into slices a good-sized onion, blanch both potatoes and onion separately. Trim about one and half pounds of neck or loin of mutton, and cut into conveniently sized pieces, par-fry them in a pan containing an ounce of drippings Line a hot-pot jar with alternate layers of potatoes, meat and onion. Season each layer with salt and pepper and a pinch of dried savoury herbs. Moisten with a pint of good stock or water, cover the jar and place it to cook in a fairly hot oven for about hours. The stew must cook slowly and the fat must be carefully re- moved before the dish is sent to table. When ready for serving sprinkle a little chopped parsley on top. Note.â€”If liked, a handful of cooked peas or a few mushrooms can be added to the stew about ten minutes before serving it. E

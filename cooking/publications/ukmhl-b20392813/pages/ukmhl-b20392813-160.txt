JELLIES, CREAMS, ICES, &c. Wine Jelly. It should be understood that Nelson's gelatine answers as well for jelly, as that made from calves' feet, and that the only advantage from using the latter is the knowledge of the source whence it is derived. To make jelly of calves' feet, boil two in four quarts of water for eight hours, skimming well. When done, strain the liquor through a very fine sieve, and let it remain until the next day. Carefully remove every particle of grease; this is best done by scraping the jelly, and then wiping it with a clean cloth dipped in very hot water. To a pint of strong jelly, put a quarter of a pound of lump sugar, the peel of one lemon, and the juice of two. When the jelly is dissolved, stir in a pint of sherry and a wine-glassful of brandy.

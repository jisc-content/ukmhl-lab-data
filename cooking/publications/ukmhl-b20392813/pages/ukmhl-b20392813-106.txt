COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. 86 considered only half-cooked, and from two to three hours is not too long to simmer it. For tripe ait blanc, put half a pound in a stew- pan with a quarter of a pint of water, a salt-spoon of salt, a pinch of pepper, and two minced onions. Let it simmer gently for two hours, or until perfectly tender. Then strain the gravy, take off every particle of fat, boil it up, and thicken it with a small dessertspoonful of flour mixed smooth in two or three tablespoonfuls of cream or milk. Put the tripe back into this sauce, and let it simmer very gently for a quarter of an hour. To stew tripe brown, put it into beef-tea or good gravy instead of water, and thicken it with a teaspoonful of Fecule de pomme de terre mixed smooth in gravy. Lemon juice or a few drops of French vinegar are good additions to tripe. Veal Cutlet. Veal is not generally well adapted to weak digestions, yet a cutlet taken from a fine neck of veal is tender and may occasionally be useful.

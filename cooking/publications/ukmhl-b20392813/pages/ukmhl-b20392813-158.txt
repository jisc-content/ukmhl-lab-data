COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. for eating with rice or macaroni by gently boiling in a stewpan until tender and tolerably dry ; sugar to taste should then be added, and stirred with the fruit over'the fire for five or ten minutes. In the case of the acid in fruit being very strong, it is well before adding the sugar to put in a small pinch of carbonate of soda; much less sugar will then be found to suffice. Croustades with Stewed Fruit. Take a French roll a day old, cut off the crust, divide it into three equal portions ; with a sharp knife cut out the middle of each so as to form a basket, taking care not to make holes in the bottom of it. The sides of the croustades should be about the third of an inch thick. Have a stewpan half full of fat, and, when it is hot enough to colour the bread instantly, immerse the croustades in it, and in less than half a minute they will be done. It is best to fry one or two at a time. Take them out of the fat with a wire spoon or a skimmer, and dry them on cap paper. Now fill the croustades with stewed fruit of any kind, and serve immediately after filling.

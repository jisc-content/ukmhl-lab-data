Loin of Mutton Cutlets. A single mutton chop, cut from the bone, and divided down the middle, will answer well for this little dish. Trim away nearly all the fat; dip the cut- lets in the beaten yolk of an egg, then in seasoned bread crumbs ; and fry quickly in a little butter, first on one side, then on the other, until brown. Serve with a puree of onions, which, properly cooked, are generally suitable for invalids, or with plainly boiled onions. To make the puree : Boil three or four onions until very tender, rub them through a sieve, then return them to the stewpan with a very small piece of butter or a spoonful of cream, pepper and salt to taste. Work the puree with a wooden spoon over the fire until it becomes thick enough, then place in the centre of the dish and the cutlets, one on each side. The yolk of an egg will add to the nourishment of the puree, and may be stirred in with the butter.

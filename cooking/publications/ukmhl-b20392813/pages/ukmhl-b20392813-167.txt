Pour the custard into a basin, and stir occasionally as it is getting cold to prevent a skin forming on the top. Brown and Poison's corn flour may be substituted for the F&ule de pomme de terre, but is not so delicate or appropriate for this purpose. Shape of Rice. Bake a quarter of a pound of rice, as directed for plain rice pudding, taking care to have it dry. Remove the brown skin, and mix with the rice whilst hot the yolks of two eggs, two ounces of powdered lump sugar, and a little almond, or vanilla flavouring. Beat all together, but do not boil after adding the eggs. Press the rice into a mould, let it stand for some hours until set, then turn it out on a glass dish.

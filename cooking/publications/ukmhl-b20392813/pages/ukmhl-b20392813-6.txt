BY THE SAME AUTHOR. LITTLE DINNERS. Thirteenth Edition. Cloth, price 5J. "We ought not to omit the mention of several very good recipes which Mrs Hooper vouchsafes us, e.g., rump-steak pudding, sheep's head Scotch fashion, devilled fowl, rich plum pudding, neck of venison cooked in a V oven, how to cook whitebait, and how to 'scollop' oysters."—Saturday Review. " A very excellent little book. . . . Ought to be recommended as exceedingly useful, and as a capital help to any housekeeper.''—Vanity Fair. "Very numerous recipes in the volume are composed with a due regard to the principles of economy, while they are thoroughly appetising."—Morning- Post. " Shows us how to serve up 'a little dinner,' such as a philosopher might offer a monarch—good, varied, in good taste, and cheap. Exactly what the young English wife wishes to know, and what the ordinary cookery-book does not teach her."—Queen. " Containing much useful information."—Court Journal. EVERY-DAY MEALS. BEING ECONOMICAL AND WHOLESOME RECIPES FOR BREAKFAST, LUNCHEON, AND SUPPER. Second Edition. Crown 8vo. Cloth, price $s. " Our already deep obligations to Miss Hooper are weightily increased by this excellent and practical little book."—Spectator. "Miss Hooper, as usual, does her work thoroughly and simply. She not only tells the mistress of the house what to provide, but where to get it, and how to prepare it, and the result is a handbook useful to all wives and mothers anxious for their husband's comfort or children's health."—Examiner.

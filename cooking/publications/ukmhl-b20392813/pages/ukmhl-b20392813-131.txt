COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. 111 liked when macaroni is objected to, and it makes light and delicious puddings. Suet puddings, if properly prepared, may be given to children who have fair digestions on days when fish, soup or eggs are substituted for meat, but puddings made of dripping are generally inad- missible. Suet should be scraped, not chopped, and in all cases the crust must be dry and well boiled. In making puddings with milk and eggs, the milk must always be boiled, as this prevents curdling. Lump sugar is now so cheap, that it may with advantage be substituted for raw in all delicate puddings. It is a good plan to boil the sugar with the milk, and then pour them on the eggs. Very slow baking is absolutely necessary for all pud- dings which have custard ; if quickly baked, the custard is often mixed with the more solid portion of the pudding, and it is also rendered tough and unsuitable for children or invalids, whereas if slowly baked the custard, even when one egg is used, will be in considerable proportion to the other in- gredients. Whites of eggs make good puddings for children, and three whites should be calculated as one egg.

COOKER Y FOR INVALIDS. 11S The brown biscuits prepared only by Mr Blatchley of Oxford Street, are much recommended by doctors, and in many cases the above recipe will be useful ; salt may be substituted for sugar, and gravy served with the pudding instead of sweet sauce. Cheese Macaroni. This is macaroni flavoured with cheese, and may be eaten without risk by most invalids. Scrape two ounces of good-flavoured rich new cheese into half a pint of cold water, let it boil gently for half an hour, strain out the cheese, and put to the liquid half an ounce of best Italian macaroni broken in small pieces, a bit of butter the size of a small walnut, a pinch of pepper, and salt if necessary. Let the macaroni simmer gently until perfectly tender, when it will have absorbed all the liquid; then beat up the yolk of an egg with a teaspoonful of milk or cream ; stir briskly into the macaroni until it is lightly set, and assumes the appearance of cheese ; serve immediately.

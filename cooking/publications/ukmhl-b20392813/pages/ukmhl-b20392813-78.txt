58 COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. When ready to bake the omelets, beat the whites of the eggs to a strong froth, and stir all together ; rub two common pudding plates with just enough butter to prevent the omelets sticking, pour the mixture on to them, bake in a quick oven until set; they will be done in about ten minutes. Fold them over, turn on to a hot dish, sift sugar over, and serve. If approved, a little apricot or straw- berry preserve may be spread over the omelets before folding them. These German omelets may be made savoury by substituting salt for sugar, and, if liked, adding a little pepper and chopped parsley.

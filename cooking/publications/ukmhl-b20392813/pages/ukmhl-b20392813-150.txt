130 CO OKER Y FOR INVA LIDS. mix with half a pound of beef suet one pound of bread crumbs, a quarter of a pound of flour, half a pound of sugar, a little spice, and a pinch of salt; put sufficient new milk to make the mixture rather stiff; butter a basin, put in the pudding, and boil for six hours. This quantity will make a large pudding. Baked Suet Crust. Shred beef suet very thin ; take equal proportions of sifted flour, roll a little suet with a little flour; put it aside as you do it, and continue the process until all the suet and flour are rolled together into flakes; gather them into a heap on the board, sprinkle them with water, using as little as possible, to make the mass into paste. When it is worked into a smooth paste, beat it a little with the rolling pin, and roll out as thin as possible; fold it over to the required thickness, and put it on the pie ; bake rather quickly. This crust should be eaten before quite cold, and, if properly made, will be a very good and light puff paste, equally suitable for fruits or meat pies.

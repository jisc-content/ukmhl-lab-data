COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. i56 Put the peel into the preserving kettle with fresh cold water to cover it, let it boil for an hour, change the water, and let the peel boil until tender enough to pierce with a straw or to crumble when pressed between the fingers; take it up, drain away all the water and cut into shreds as fine as possible. Squeeze the oranges, and to every dozen add the juice of four lemons. Weigh the shred peel and the juice, and to every pound allow a pound and a half of lump sugar. Put a pint of water to each pound of sugar, let it boil a quarter of an hour, then add the juice of the fruit, and when the syrup becomes thick put in the peel and boil all together for twenty minutes, or until the marmalade will jelly. Put into jars, let them remain uncovered for a day or two, then tie down in the usual manner. It is a good plan to prepare the peel the day before making the marmalade, as it then has time to drain before shredding ; it should be set aside on sieves and turned about occasionally.

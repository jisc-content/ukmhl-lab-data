It should be put away in small bottles, and be well corked. Provision should be made in families for supply- ing lemonade at any moment. This may be done by putting the peel of lemons, when cheap, into a bottle, and covering them with gin, draining away the liquor when it has stood a month, and bottling it. This can be used to flavour lemonade made with citric acid, which is perfectly wholesome. A syrup can be made of the juice of the lemons thus : Add half a pint of strained juice to a pint of capillaire made as directed above, and allow both to boil together for an hour. If care be taken to remove all scum as it rises, the syrup will be clear and bright. Put away in small bottles closely corked, and it will keep for years. A little of this syrup, with a few drops of the extract of lemon peel, makes a delicious and refreshing drink.

PREFACE, The great importance of well-chosen and well- cooked food, as a means not only of preserving but of restoring health, is now fully recognised, and " Dr Diet and Kitchen Physic " are acknowledged as the best friends of the medical profession. Yet there is no more anxious time for a doctor than when he hands over his patient to the good offices of the cook, for, as a celebrated culinary writer has said, " he knows how often the skill of the pains- taking physician is counteracted by the want of corresponding attention to the preparation of food, and the poor patient, instead of deriving nourish- ment, is distressed by indigestion."

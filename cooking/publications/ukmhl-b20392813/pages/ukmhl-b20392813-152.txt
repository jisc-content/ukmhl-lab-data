COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. 132 German Pudding. Chop the remains of a fruit pudding very finely, add to them a quarter of their weight in flour, suet, sugar, and black currant jam, or any kind of stewed fruit. Mix all with an egg; bake the pudding very slowly for nearly two hours, taking care it does not become hard on the outside. When done turn it out and sift sugar over. Rice Pudding without Milk. Bake a quarter of a pound of rice in a pint of water, with one ounce of finely shred suet or of butter ; when done add to it a quarter of a pint of water in which a dessertspoonful of flour has been boiled, with one egg well beaten, sugar and flavour- ing to taste. Bake gently for three-quarters of an hour. This and the three following recipes will be found acceptable to the sick poor, who being unaccus- tomed to delicate puddings do not appreciate them when ill. Puddings for the poor should not be made

COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. 104 Cauliflower. For an invalid, cauliflower is best boiled in branches. Choose a close white head, let it lie a few minutes in tepid water, break it up into branches, throw them into boiling water with a little salt, when tender, as they will be in from five to ten minutes, drain them, and serve either plain, in good gravy, in butter, or white sauce. Spinach. Pick the spinach free from all stalk, wash it thoroughly in several waters until sure it is perfectly free from grit, drain it well in a colander, and put it in a saucepan with a small teaspoonful of salt to a pound of spinach,â€”no water. Cover the sauce- pan, shaking and stirring to prevent the spinach burning. In a few minutes the juices of the spinach will be drawn, then uncover the saucepan, and let it boil gently until tender. Strain the spinach, and put it into the vegetable presser, squeeze very dry, and serve. Spinach thus cooked

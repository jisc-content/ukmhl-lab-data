COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. iÂ°3 Greens. General directions for boiling these can only be given, as there are so many kinds varying also in age and quality, and therefore taking more or less time to cook. It is customary to put soda into the water in which greens are boiled in order to preserve their colour, but this practice deprives them of the properties which render them valuable as an article of diet. When fresh, the colour should be preserved without difficulty, and as only perfectly fresh green vege- tables must be given to invalids, soda will not be necessary. Having carefully picked the greens, put them for a few minutes in tepid water, wash them thoroughly, drain, and throw them into a large saucepan of fast- boiling water slightly salted. Keep the lid off the saucepan, and as soon as the greens are tender strain them through a colander. Have ready a tin vegetable presser, heated by pouring over it the water from the greens, press them into it, taking care that they become perfectly dry. Put them into a hot dish, and serve.

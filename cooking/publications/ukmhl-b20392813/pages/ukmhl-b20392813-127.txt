107 COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. with the most delicate stomach. Put the onions to boil in plenty of water, with a little salt, in half- an-hour pour away the first water and put fresh. Let the onions boil slowly for three hours, or until so tender they can be pierced with a straw, then drain away the water, put a small piece of butter into the saucepan, and toss the onions in it over the fire for five minutes. Serve, either with or without the butter, according to the taste of the patient. Vegetable Marrow. Choose a small quickly grown marrow of a pale green colour, wash it, do not cut or prick it in any way beyond cutting off the stem. Put it into boil- ing water with a little salt and keep it boiling fast until tender; it will probably take half-an-hour, but the time depends on the size and quality of the marrow. When done, take it up, cut in quarters, and with a spoon remove the seeds. If allowed, put a little fine fresh butter on each piece, and serve. Vegetable marrow should not be pared or divided before cooking, as much of its flavour is thereby sacrificed.

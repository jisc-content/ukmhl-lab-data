152 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. VI milk, or cream, as will cover and moisten it well; put a plate over to keep in the steam, and let it remain for half an hour, or more ; then drain off the superfluous liquid, and squeeze the panada dry by wringing it round in a thin cloth into a hall; put it into a small stewpan, or well tinned saucepan, and pour to it as much only of rich white sauce or of gravy, as it can easily absorb, and stir it constantly with a wooden spoon, over a clear and gentle Are, until it forms a very dry paste, and ad- heres in a mass to the spoon ; when it is in this state, mix with it, thoroughly, the unbeaten yolk of two fresh eggs, which will give it firmness, and set it aside to become quite cold before it is put into the mortar. The best French cooks give the highest degree of savour that they can to this panada, and add no other seasoning to the forcemeats of which it forms a part: it is used in an equal proportion with the meat, and calfâ€™s udder or butter of which they are composed, as we have shown in the preceding receipt for quenelles. They stew slowly for the purpose, a small bit of lean ham, two or three minced eschalots, a bayleaf, a few mushrooms, a little parsley, a clove or two, and a small blade of mace, in a little good butter, and when they are suffi- ciently browned, pour to them as much broth or gravy as will be needed for the panada; and when this has simmered from twenty to thirty minutes, so as to have acquired the proper flavour, without being much reduced, they strain it over, and boil it into the bread. The common course of cookery in an English kitchen does not often require the practice of the greater niceties and refinements of the art: and trouble (of which the French appear to be perfectly regardless when the excellence of their preparations is concerned) is there in general so much thought of, and exclaimed against, that a more summary pro- cess would probably meet with a better chance of success. A quicker and rougher mode of making the panada, and indeed the forcemeat altogether, is to pour strong veal broth or gravy upon it, and after it has soaked, to boil it dry, without any addition except that of a little fine spice, lemon-grate, or any ether favourite English seasoning. Minced herbs, salt, cayenne, and mace may be beaten with the meat, to which a small portion of well-pounded ham, may likewise be added at pleasure.

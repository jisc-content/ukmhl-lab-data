[chap, yl MODERN COOKERY. 142 CH1PTEK VI. FORCEMEATS. GENERAE REMARKS. n n even at tables otherwise —tolerably well served, show u with how little attention they are commonly pre- pared. The coarse and unpalat- able compounds so con- stantly met with under the denomination of forcemeat, Weighing Machine. Many very indifferent cooks pique themselves on never doing any thing by rule, and the consequence of their throwing together at random (or “ by guess” as they call it) the ingredients which ought to be pro- portioned with exceeding delicacy and exactness is, repeated failure in all they attempt to do. Long experience, and a very correct eye may, it is true, enable a person to dispense occasion- ally with weights and measures, without hazarding the success of their operations; but it is an experiment which the learner will do better to avoid. A large marble or Wedgwood mortar is indispensable in making all the finer kinds of forcemeat; and equally so indeed for many other purposes in cookery; no kitchen, therefore, should be without one; and for whatever preparation it may be used, the pounding should be continued with patience and perseverance until not a single lump nor fibre be perceptible in the mass of the articles beaten together. This particularly applies to potted meats, which should resemble the smoothest paste ; as well as to several varieties of forcemeat. Of these last it should be observed, that such as are made by the French method (see quenelle.y) are the most appropriate for an elegant dinner, either to serve in soups or to fill boned poultry of any kind; but when their exceeding lightness, which to foreigners constitutes one of their great excellencies, is ob jected to, it may be remedied by substituting dry crumbs of bread for the panada, and pounding a small quantity of the lean of a boiled ham, with the other ingredients : however, this should be done only for the bails.

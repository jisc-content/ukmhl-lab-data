559 CHAP. XXVII.] COFFEE, CHOCOLATE, &C. ten minutes longer. It will be perfectly clear, unless mis- managed, without any other fining. Should more, however, be deemed necessary, a very small pinch of isinglass, or a clean egg- shell, with a little of the white adhering to it, is the best that can be used. (We cannot recommend the skin of any fish for the purpose.) If tried, with the same proportions by both the methods we have given, the reader will easily ascertain that which answers best. Never use mustard to fine coffee with. It is a barbarous custom of which we have heard foreigners who have been in England vehemently complain! Coffee, 2 ozs.; water, 1 quart. Filtered; or boiled 10 minutes; left to clear 10 minutes. BURNT COFFEE. (In France vulgarly called Gloria.') Make some coffee as strong and as clear as possible, sweeten it in the cup with white sugar almost to syrup, then pour brandy on the top gently over a spoon; set fire to it with a lighted paper, and when the spirit is in part consumed, blow out the flame and drink the gloria quite hot. one TO MAKE CHOCOLATE. (French Receipt.) An ounce of chocolate, if good, will be sufficient person. Rasp, and then boil it from five to ten minutes with about four tablespoonsful of water; when it is extremely smooth add nearly a pint of new milk, give it another boil, stir it well, or mill it, and serve it directly. For water-chocolate use three quarters of a pint of water instead of the milk, and send rich hot cream to table with it. The taste must decide whether it shall be made thicker or thinner. Chocolate, 2 ozs.; water, quarter- pint, or rather more; milk, If pint: l minute. Obs.â€”The general reader will understand the use of the chocolate-mill shown in the engraving with the pot; but to the uninitiated it may be as well to observe, that it is worked quickly round between both hands to give a fine froth to the chocolate. It also serves in lieu of a whisk for working creams, or jellies, to a froth or whip.

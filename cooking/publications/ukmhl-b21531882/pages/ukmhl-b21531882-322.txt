MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XI. 252 in the inside, the greater part of the fat in which they have been fried; mix with it a large teaspoonful of flour, and stir these over the fire till they are well and equally browned; then pour in by degrees nearly half a pint of strong beef or veal broth, or gravy, and two glasses of good white wine; add a small bunch of savoury herbs, and as much salt and pepper, or cayenne, as will season the whole properly; give it a boil, lay in the sausages round the pan, and the chestnuts in the centre ; stew them very softly for nearly an hour; take out the herbs, dish the sausages neatly, and heap the chestnuts in the centre, strain the sauce over them and serve them very hot. This is a corner dish. There should be no sage mixed with the pork to dress thus. Chestnuts roasted, 40; sausages, 6; gravy, nearly \ pint; sherry or Madeira, 2 wineglassesful: stewed together from 50 to 60 minutes. TRUFFLED SAUSAGES. (Saucisses aux Truffles.) With two pounds of the lean of young tender pork, mix one pound of fat, a quarter of a pound of truflles, minced very small, an ounce and a half of salt, a seasoning of cayenne, or quite half an ounce of white pepper, a nutmeg, a teaspoonful of freshly pounded mace, and a dessertspoonful or more of savoury herbs dried and reduced to powder. Test a morsel of the mixture ; heighten any of the seasonings to the taste ; and put the meat into delicately clean skins: if it be for immediate use, and the addition is liked, moisten it, before it is dressed, with one or two glassesful of Madeira. The substitution of a clove of garlic for the truffles, will convert these into Saucisses a 1'Ail^ or garlic sausages.

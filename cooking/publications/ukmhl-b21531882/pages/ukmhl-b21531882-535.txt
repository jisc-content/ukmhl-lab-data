PRESERVES. 4G5 CHAP. XXI.] Closed Furnace and Cover. which the receipts are given in this chapter, as well as for various dishes contained in the body of the work. There should always be a free current of air in the room in which it stands when lighted, as charcoal or braise (that is to say, the live embers of large well-burned wood, drawn from an oven and shut immediately into a closely-stopped iron or cop- per vessel to extinguish them) is the only fuel suited to it. To kindle either of these, two or three bits must be lighted in a common fire, and laid on the top of that in the furnace, which should be evenly placed between the grating and the brim, and then blown gently with the bellows until the wdiole is alight: the floor of the fur- nace must in the mean while be open, and remain so, un- less the heat should at any time be too fierce for the preserves, when it must be closed for a few minutes, to moderate it. To extinguish the fire altogether, the cover must be pressed closely on, | and the door be quite shut: the embers which remain will serve to rekindle it easily, but , before it is again lighted the 1 grating must be lifted out and all the ashes cleared away. It should be set by in a place which is not damp. The German enamelled stewpans, now coming into general use, are, from the peculiar nicety of the composition with w'hich they are lined, better adapted than any others to pickling and preserving, as they may be used without danger for acids; and red fruits, when boiled in them, retain the. brightness of their colour as well as if copper or bell-metal were used for them. The form of the old-fashioned preserving- pan, made usually of one or the other of these, is shown above; but it has not, we should say, even the advantage of h n 7 T Form of Trevet.

MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. IX, 196 keep: boil them 11 hour, and from \ to Â£ hour more when wanted for table. When the bones have been sawed to the length of a deep pie dish, wash and wipe them dry, lay them into it, and cover them entirely with a good batter. Send them to a moderate oven for an hour or more, and serve them in the batter. Take the marrow from the bones while it is as fresh as pos- sible ; cut it small, put it into a very clean jar, and melt it with a gentle heat, either in a pan of water placed over the fire, or at the mouth of a cool oven; strain it through a muslin, let it settle for a minute or two, and pour it, clear of sediment, into small jars. Tie skins, or double folds of thick paper, over them as soon as the marrow is cold, and store it in a cool place. It will remain good for months. BAKED MARROW BONES.

31 FISH. CHAP. II.] plenty of mace, and white pepper, dip the oysters in and then fry them. RED HERRINGS, A LA DAUPHIN. Take off the heads, open the hacks of the fish, and remove the back-bones; soak the herrings, should they be very dry, for two or three hours in warm milk and water, drain and wipe them. Dissolve a large slice of fresh butter, and mix it with the beaten yolks of a couple of eggs, and some savoury herbs minced small; dip the fish into these, and spread them thickly with fine bread-crumbs; broil them of a clear brown, over a moderate fire, and serve them on hot buttered toasts, sprinkled with a little cayenne. RED HERRINGS, COMMON ENGLISH MODE. This fish is rendered infinitely more delicate by pouring boiling water on it, before it is dressed, and leaving it to soak for half an hour, or more, should it be highly dried. The fresh Yarmouth bloaters do not require this. Cut off the heads and tails, open the herrings at the back, and warm them through before the fire, or upon the gridiron. They may be rubbed with a bit of cold butter, and seasoned with a slight sprinkling of pepper or cayenne, when these are liked, or served quite plain. ANCHOVIES FRIED IN BATTER. Scrape very clean a dozen or more of fine anchovies, and soak them in plenty of spring water from two to six hours; then wipe them dry, open them, and take out the back-bones, without dividing the fish. Season the insides highly with cayenne, close the anchovies, dip them into the French batter of Chapter VL, or into a light English batter, and fry them a pals amber-colour : in from four to five minutes they will be quite sufficiently done.

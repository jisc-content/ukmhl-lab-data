155 COILING, ROASTING, &C. cnAP. vii.] Bottle-jack and Niche Screen.4 ROASTING. Roasting, which is quite the favourite mode of dressing meat- in this country, and one in which the English are thought to excel, requires unremitting attention on the part of the cook, rather than any great exertion of skill. Large kitchens are usually fitted with a smoke-jack, by means of which several spits, if needful, can be kept turning at the same time; but in small establishments, a roaster which allows of some eco- nomy in point of fuel is more commonly used. That shown in the print is of very advantageous construction in this respect, as a joint may be cooked in it with a comparatively small fire, the heat being strongly reflected from the screen upon the meat; in con- sequence of this, it should never be placed very close to the grate, as the surface of the joint would then become dry and hard. A more convenient form of roaster, with a spit placed hori- zontally, and turned by means of a wheel and chain, of which the movement is regulated by a spring contained in a box at the top, is of the same economical order as the one above. For roasting without either of these, make up a fire propor- tioned in width and height to the joint which is to be roasted, and which it should surpass in dimensions every way, by two or three inches. Place some moderate-sized lumps of coal on the top ; let it be free from smoke and ashes in front; and so com- * The bottle-jack, without the screen, is used in many families very success- fully; it is wound up like a watch, by means of a key, and turns very regularly until it has run down.

XXXVI TRUSSING. by having the head fixed between the shoulders, and either fastened to the 'back by means of a long skewer, run through the head quite into it, or by passing one through the upper part of the shoulders and the neck together, which will keep it equally well in place, though less thrown back. The fore-legs are then laid straight along the sides of the hare, and a skewer is thrust through them both and the body at the same time; the sinews are just cut through under the hind-legs, and they are brought forward as much as possible, and skewered in the same manner as the others. A string is then thrown across, under the hare and over the points of both skewers, being crossed before it is passed over the second, and then tied above the back. The ears of a hare are left on; those of a rabbit, which is trussed in the same way, are taken off. Joints of meat require but little arrangement, either for the spit or for boiling. A fillet of veal must have the flap, or part to which the fat adheres, drawn closely round the outside, and be skewered or bound firmly into good shape: this will apply equally to a round of beef. The skin or flank of loins of meat must be wrapped over the ends of the bones, and skewered on the underside. The cook should he particularly careful to joint these when it has not been done by the butcher, and necks of veal or mutton also, or much trouble will often arise to the carver. To flatten and bring cutlets into uniform shape, j a bat of this form is used;I and to egg or to cover' them with clarified butter Cutlet Bat. when they are to be crumbed, a paste-brush should be at hand. Indeed, these and many other small means and appliances ought to be provided for every cook who is expected to perform her duty in a regular and proper manner, for they save much time and trouble, and their first expense is very slight; yet many kitchens are almost entirely without them.

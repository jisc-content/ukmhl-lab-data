PRACTICAL HOME COOKERY. II2 Should these mushrooms au gratin be required as an entree, where great excellence is desirable, an im- provement will be found by adding two yolks of eggs to the mass after it has been taken off the fire. These yolks must be stirred in thoroughly, and have the effect of rendering the insides of the mushrooms richer in appearance and taste. They are not, however, in my opinion, necessary. When there has been a large lobster salad or salads made, the cook is often at a loss how to utiUse the lobster that is left. In the first place, lobster will not keep sometimes even one hot night. One very good method of using up any remains is what is called bashawed lobster. Take all the pieces of lobster left, and cut them up with a knife and fork ; chop up a little piece of onion, about the size of the top of the Httle finger, and a small piece of parsley. Mix it with the pieces of lobster, and a very little anchovy sauce and cayenne pepper. Cut up a piece of butter into little pieces, and mix in and fill the shell part of the lobster—i.e. the two half-tails. Cover these shells over the top with some fine bread-crumbs, and shake a few fine bread-raspings on the top. Put the shells in the oven for ten minutes, or a httle longer, and serve hot. Some fried parsley makes a good garnish in contrast with the red shell, and is also a great im- provement to the flavour. This is a capital supper dish after a hot day, can be made early in the after- noon, and only requires what the cooks call “ popping in the oven.” Cook will, of course, maintain that the remains of a lobster or lobsters cannot be done this way properly. The reason is, lobster—and, in fact, shell-fish generally —has particular charms for the kitchen. Servants are partial also to cucumber, vinegar, fiver and bacon, lamb’s fry, roast pork and sage-and-onions, winkles.

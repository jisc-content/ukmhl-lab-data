70 PRACTICAL HOME COOKERY. the white sauce can be placed in a larger basin con- taining hot water, to prevent it setting too soon. Instead of beetroot, a thin leaf of truffle looks much better, in which case a red bead of lobster-coral should be placed in the centre of the star, instead of the parsley. However, recommending truffle is rather useless, for the simple reason that persons rich enough to use them generally keep a cook, to whom these instructions would be unnecessary. The next point is the rissoles. Take all the remains of the fowl—i.e. about half—taking great care that no pieces of bone or skin remain, and chop it up with half the tin of mushrooms, and a good slice of fat ham. Chop up separately, very finely, a piece of onion about as big as the top of the finger down to the first joint ; sufficient parsley, when chopped, to fill a tea-spoon ; enough thyme to cover a sixpence ; add a little cayenne pepper and salt. Mix the whole well together, and if a sausage-macliine is in the house, of course run it through it ; but if not, some pains and time must be spent over the chopping. Roll it up into small balls, dip them first into some well-beaten-up egg, and then into some fine bread-crumbs, and fry ; and serve with some gravy poured round, exactly as the mutton cutlets were done in the previous article, though of course these rissoles are far superior to those made from mutton. Next with regard to the forcemeat for the paper cases for the larks. These paper cases can be bought at the pastrycook’s, but they are easily made at home, much cheaper, out of stiff note-paper. Take a quarter of a pound of calf’s fiver, cut it up into small pieces, and fry in about the same quantity of rather fat ham. Chop up finely a bead of garlic, a piece of lemon-peel the size of the fii'st finger-nail, a tea-spoonful of parsley, and the remaining half of the tin of mushrooms ; add

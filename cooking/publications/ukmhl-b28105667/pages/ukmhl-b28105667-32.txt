28 PRACTICAL HOME COOKERY. au-vent without. But all this has very little to do with the subject, which is not household management in general, but table extravagance in particular. Perhaps the most common form of extravagance is profusion, which is very marked in certain dishes ; and we before called attention to melted butter, which is invariably made in quantity sufficient for quite ten times the number at dinner. Fish is commonly sup- plied in quantity enough for double the number ; for instance, three or four persons do not want a pair of large soles ; one would be ample, and the other would do for breakfast cooked fresh ; instead, it is either warmed up and spoilt, or eaten cold at the servantsâ€™ supper with a knife and vinegar. Another form of extravagance is cooking too many potatoes every day regularly. I know one or two houses where more than half the dish of potatoes has been left every day for the last twenty years, and I feel confident will con- tinue to be left for twenty years to come. Again, some servants invariably cut up a great deal more bread for dinner than is necessary, the stale pieces left too often finding their way into the pig-tub. Speak- ing of pig-tubs reminds me of a little incident that came to my knowledge only last Christmas. A gentle- man living in a country village kept one pig, and had been in the habit of paying is. a week for grains from the brewery. His gardener, who lived in a little cottage a mile off, and kept pigs of his own, informed him that he was in the habit of buying pig-wash from the cooks in the neighbourhood, to whom he paid is. a month, and suggested that he should receive the is. a week, and in return find the wash, guaranteeing the pig would thrive far better. The first pail of wash the man brought to the house ought indeed to be a caution to housekeepers, containing as it did large lumps of bread, whole cooked potatoes, and chicken-bones half-picked.

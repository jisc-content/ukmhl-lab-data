COOLING DRINKS. I2I instead. The effect of a stimulant is but short, and too often is followed by a reaction far worse than the original feehng of lassitude. There is one subject in connection with cooling drinks that I wish to mention, though a trifle out of place in an article that purports teaching cookery ; yet its importance is so great that I trust I may be pardoned for introducing it. When you use water for drinking, or for mixing cooling drinks, take care that it is pure. No house ought to be without a filter. Were the custom of first boihng and then filtering water universal, tens of thousands of fives would be annually saved throughout the country. Children are peculiarly sus- ceptible to the influence of impure water, and during hot weather especially drink a great deal. The cost of a filter is small, and the trouble of boiling the water also small. Let me strongly advise mothers in small households, where no trustworthy housekeeper is kept, to super- intend the management of the filter themselves. If my advice be the means of saving the fife of even one little one, it will not have been given in vain. Should any one say or think that this is all rubbish, let that one ask any respectable medical man for his opinion, and then act on it.

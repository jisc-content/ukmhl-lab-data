ii8 PRACTICAL HOME COOKERY. good brandy—not some of that dreadful cheap brandy that smells like naphtha—and one table-spoonful of noyeau or maraschino. Rub a nutmeg about half a dozen times across the grater over the cup. Let the cup stand for about a quarter of an hour, and then taste it. Should the flavour of the cucumber be very decided, take out the piece of cucumber ; and the same as regards the lemon. Should the flavour of the peel of the lemon be detected, take out the two shces of lemon, for lemons vary immensely in strength. Now add a large lump of ice and a bottle of soda- water, taking care to pour the latter in carefully—i.e. to put the soda-water bottle almost into the cup. I have seen persons pour the soda-water from a height, thereby losing half the carbonic-gas, which ought to go into the cup to freshen it up, so to speak. All that the cup now requires is drinking. It is by no means a very cheap affair, as the sherry, brandy, and noyeau probably cost more than the claret. A cheaper form of cup, and one more suitable for use, as we have said, after cricket or rowing, is a bottle of claret with the same quantity of lemon, cucumber- peel, and sugar, two or three drops of essence of almonds, a large lump of ice, and two bottles of soda-water. One word, however, in reference to the lemoii proper not only for claret-cup, but for any other kind of cup. The lemon must be fresh—i.e. when it is cut it must have a Arm rim round it, yellow outside and white inside. An old lemon, that is soft and pulpy, with a hard, dry skin, and that smells sweet, is no good for claret-cup. In making champagne-cup it is still more important to have a good lemon. The method of making champagne-cup that I think best is so simple that it barely deserves the name of a recipe. It is as follows :—A bottle of champagne,

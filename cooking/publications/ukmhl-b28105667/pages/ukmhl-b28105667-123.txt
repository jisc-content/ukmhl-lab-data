COOLING DRINKS. 119 one or two thin slices of lemon, a large lump of ice, and a bottle of soda-water. Francatelli is, however, so great an authority in cooking, and all his recipes, so far as cooldng is con- cerned, so invariably correct, that I will give his recipe for making both champagne and claret-cup, merely remarking that I have not tried either.

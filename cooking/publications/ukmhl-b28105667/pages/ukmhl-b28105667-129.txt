125 GAME AND GRAVY. To overpower the delicious flavour of a good grouse with strong sauces seems to us as cruel a waste as to mull good 1848 Lafitte claret, and mix in cinnamon and sugar. As an instance, however, of what cooks may come to, we will mention an Itahan method of spoiling grouse —the ingredients for this extraordinary dish comprising mace, garhc, brandy, macaroni, tomato sauce, and Parmesan cheese. Imagine what a dish this Itahan cook and our farmer’s wife could manufacture between them ! The first point to be considered with regard to game, is. How long should it be kept ? When game is bought, it is of course impossible to say how long it has been killed, except from appear- ances. As a rule, the first symptom of discolouring, or the faintest smell of being high, shows that the birds are ripe for cooking. We would, however, allow a pheasant a longer time than either a partridge or a grouse. A thoroughly fresh pheasant is more tough than a fowl. Game, in fact, should be treated exactly like a good haunch of mutton. No one would keep a haunch till it is high, but yet every one knows that the longer it is kept the more tender it becomes. In a large number of London shops the game for sale has already been kept too long, reminding one of the story of the man who arrived home after a day’s shooting, who had, however, been driven to buy a brace for appearances, the look of which called forth the remark from his wife— “ Well, my dear, it is time they were shot, for they are getting very high.” The next point to be considered is the actual cooking. We will suppose the birds ready trussed. They should be wiped inside, but never washed.

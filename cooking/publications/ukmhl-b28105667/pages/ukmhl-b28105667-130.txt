126 PRACTICAL HOME COOKERY. All game requires a brisk fire, and plenty of basting, It is the custom among French cooks to fasten a thin slice of bacon over the breast, in order to prevent the bird being too dry. Indeed, they go so far as to send the bird to table with the bacon still on. In my opinion, this spoils the fiavour of the bird altogether, giving it what may be termed a greasy taste. If bacon is fast- ened on at all, it should then be taken off before the bird is taken down ; the breast should be basted with a little butter, and frothed and browned before it is sent up. With regard to the time that it takes to cook game, it is difficult to lay down any general rule. The time of course varies with the size of the birds. Young, small partridges want about twenty-five minutes ; good-sized partridges as much as thirty-five minutes ; small grouse will take a little over half an hour, and good-sized ones require three-quarters ; pheasants require from thirty-five minutes to an hour ; or even more, according to the size. The principal thing, however, for the cook to bear in mind is to adapt the time to the period of dinner when the game wiU be required. Herein lies the great secret of game being badly cooked. Have you not often at a large dinner-party had game completely dried up, the outside skin being quite hard ? The reason of this is that the game was ready for table about the period you were finishing your soup. The fact is, cooks, especially young and inexperienced, get nervous about time, forgetting that it is quite as bad to have things dried up as to have them underdone. It would be a good plan were the housekeeper to give the following directions to the cook ;â€”Do not begin to cook the game until you send up the soup. Suppose the dinner to consist of soup, fish, entrees, and joint, followed by game, there is ample time to cook grouse,

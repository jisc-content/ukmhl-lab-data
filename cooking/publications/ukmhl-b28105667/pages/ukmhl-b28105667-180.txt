CHAPTER XIX. 176 WEDDING BREAKFASTS. My chapter on wedding breakfasts must not consist in simply saying, Don’t have one ; though I must in the name of common sense enter my protest against the vulgarity—for it is nothing else—of giving one out of proportion to the means of the giver. Where money is no object, of course the simplest plan is to go to some first-rate confectioner’s, and let them supply the break- fast at so much a head. Where, however, economy is a necessity, much can be done with a Httle good manage- ment to avoid waste. I will give an instance of a wedding breakfast that took place during the last six months, and the cost. For it often happens that during the last week before the wedding there is so much to be done at home in the trousseau line that any elaborate cooking in the house is almost impossible. The follow- ing bill of fare is one supplied for over sixty persons, at 14s. a head, in February last:— POTAGES. Printanier. Puree d’Artichauts a la Palestine. Entries Chatjdes. Chartreuse de Homard a la Cardinal. Petites Timbales a la Grande Duchesse. Quenelle de Volaille a la Sefton. Cotelettes de Tortue. Saumon a la Mayonnaise. Dindon aux Truffes.

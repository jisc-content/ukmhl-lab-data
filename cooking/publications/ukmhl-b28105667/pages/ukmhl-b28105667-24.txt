PRACTICAL HOME COOKERY. 20 raw flesh to which the Indians were accustomed. Con- sequently, on great occasions, when a dish of roast pork is required, it has been the custom ever since to drive a pig into some snjall hut or house, and then set the house on fire. Now, this method has all the charm of simplicity, but still it is not altogether an economical method ; though there are some dens and hovels even in this country where no one could regret the experi- ment. But to take a simple case to illustrate our point, we will describe that very common sauce, lobster sauce, and contrast it as it is with what it ought to be, trust- ing that our description of the latter will be attended with the practical result of enabling those who read it to make it for themselves, should they so desire, besides something in addition. First, we all know the lobster sauce which too often is handed round as an accompaniment to some boiled fish, such as turbot or brill. It consists simply of melted butter, with small pieces of lobster—some white, some pink—cut up in it ; but as to the hquid sauce itself, it does not contain even the slightest flavour of lobster whatever. On the other hand, good lobster sauce is of a bright red colour, and tasting so strongly of lobster that it is too often apt to overpower the flavour of the fish entirely. Yet this latter has probably been made out of exactly the same materials as the former. What, then, is the difference ?

Cutting up the meat of a lobster and putting the pieces into melted butter is no more making lobster sauce than cutting up a calf’s head and throwing the pieces into boding -water would be making mock-turtle soup. We will suppose, now, the very ordinary case of some lobster sauce being required for a small party,

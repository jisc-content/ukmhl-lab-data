Mix in sufl&cient lobster butter to make the whole mass appear of a bright-red colour—about a brimming tea-spoonful is generally sufficient for a medium-sized lobster. After this add some ordinary butter about two ounces—but, of course, the quantity must vary with the size and meatiness of the lobster, but suffi- cient must be added to make the whole quantity into a sort of thick pudding, which when struck with a table-spoon makes a noise like—slosh. Next mould the mass into a quantity of small pieces, the size and shape of an oval pic-nic biscuit. This moulding is best done with the hands, by throw- ing the piece from one palm into the other. Dip each piece in a well-beaten-up egg—of course, one egg is sufficient for the whole quantity—and then into some fine dry bread-crumbs. Fry in some boiling fat or lard for about two minutes, and put each piece on a cloth to drain for a few minutes in front of the fire. Stick a small piece of the end of the small claws of the lobster—say about three-quarters of an inch long —into each, to represent the bone of the cutlet, and the dish is complete, though it had better be put into the oven for four or five minutes just before serving. When lobsters are cheap, the cost of these pretty Httle red cutlets varies from one penny to three-halfpence each. I once made twenty from a lobster that cost one shilling and sixpence. There are many ignorant people, who on seeing such a dish would imagine that it must be a very extravagant one ; and yet these same persons would think nothing of having a dish of six or eight ordinary mutton cutlets handed round as an entree, costing at least sixpence each. Besides, there is no comparison in the appearance of the two dishes. There are, perhaps, few entrees more invariably passed

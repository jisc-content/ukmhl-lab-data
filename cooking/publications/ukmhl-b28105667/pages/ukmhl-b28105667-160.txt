156 PRACTICAL HOME COOKERY. that must be used for the wassail-bowl is evidently strong old ale, like Burton or Edinburgh, and I should think the more sweet and oily the ale the better the wassail. Mild ale or bitter ale would not answer, especially the latter. I have on previous occasions gone into the mys- teries of mince pies and plum pudding, as well as into turkey-stuffing and goose-stuffing. How to roast a sir- loin of beef, though important, is too well known to warrant many words. There is, however, no season in the year in which cold roast beef is so plentiful as the day after Christmas Day. Now, though cold roast beef really does not want any sauce at all, yet there is one that so admirably suits it that I think it is well worth mentioning at the present season. I refer to horseradish sauce. Horseradish sauce used to be made by mixing together grated horse- radish with sugar, mustard, vinegar, and cream. There has, however, been an admirable modern invention called Swiss milk, preserved in tins. When, therefore, you have any compound requiring cream and sugar, by using Swiss milk with ordinary milk you get an exactly similar result, at a far less cost. To make horseradish sauce proceed as follows :—Take a stick or two of horseradish, and send it through a coarse grater till you have sufficient pulp to fill, say, a couple of table- spoons. This grating process, like chopping onions, is far from pleasant, as it makes one cry. Next dis- solve about a tea-spoonful of Swiss milk in a little ordinary milk—say two table-spoonfuls of the latter —and mix in about a tea-spoonful of made mustard and a tea-spoonful of vinegar, then mix in the two table- spoonfuls of horseradish pulp, and stir it all together. The consistency should be that of good thick cream ; of course, by adding more pulp the mixture will be rendered thicker. Should it be too sweet, of course it

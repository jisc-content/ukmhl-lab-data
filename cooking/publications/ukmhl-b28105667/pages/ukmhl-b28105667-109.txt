SALADS. 105 and so arrange it that the outer leaves are smooth and uniform ; cover these leaves entirely with the sauce, using if possible a silver knife or ivory paper-knife for the purpose ; place the slices of salmon neatly round the base of the salad, which ought in appearance to resemble a mould of sohd custard. Ornament the sauce by dropping on little pieces of finely-chopped parsley, and sticking in a few dried capers, and stick a little sprig of bright-green parsley on the top ; a few olives and anchovies are a great improvement. A dish of this description makes a very pretty addition either to the supper-table or at lunch. I need scarcely add that hard-boiled eggs cut up form a capital garnish to almost every kind of salad. The eggs, to taste nice, should be new-laid. They should be placed in a sauce- pan in cold water, and allowed to remain in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after the water boils ; they should then be taken out and placed in cold water, and had better not be peeled and cut up till within, say, half an hour of the salad being eaten, as hard-boiled egg is apt to change its colour if exposed to the air too long. When a silver dish is used, the egg will discolour it very much, so bear in mind to clean it as soon as possible. Mayonnaise sauce will keep two or even more days, if kept in a very cool place.

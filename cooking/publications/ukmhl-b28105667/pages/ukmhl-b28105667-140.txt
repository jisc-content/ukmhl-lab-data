136 PRACTICAL HOME COOKERY. for an hour or more, till the celery is quite tender, strain off the meat, take out carefully all the bones, which will be found after this boiling to be quite white and dry, and then, with a good-sized wooden spoon, rub all the meat and celery through a wire sieve into the stock. This will take time ; but recollect, the one secret of good hare soup is the fact of the meat of the hare being rubbed through the sieve helping to make the soup not only thicker, but materially affecting the taste. Indeed, I may go farther, and say the excel- lence of the soup is in proportion to the amount of hare-flesh rubbed through the sieve. Should, there- fore, the soup look a little thin, allow it to boil away and decrease in quantity. Of course, the taste will much depend upon the amount of jugged hare left ; but a httle port wine may be added at the finish, as the flavour of wine in soups is very apt to go off after they have been boiled for any length of time. A little more lemon-juice may be added near the finish, but avoid putting in too much currant jelly. Some persons think hare soup should be absolutely sweet. For my part, I think this is a mistake ; besides, red- currant jeUy can always be added if wished, but can- not be taken out of the soup. The soup should be made slightly thicker by means of brown thickening, which I have before described to be simply butter and flour dried of a rich brown colour. Do not, however, use too much of this thickening, as it will be found to destroy the delicate flavour of the hare somewhat ; besides which, good hare soup should by no means be very thick. It will, however, have one very marked effect, and that is, it will enable you to add some more port wine, or port-wine dregs, which has such an enor- mous influence over the flavour of hare soup. When the soup is about to be served, throw in the httle slices of hare that had been put by on the plate, but do not

87 SPRING DISHES. with gi'illed salmon is tartare sauce, which may briefly be described as follows -.â€”First make some mayonnaise sauce as thick as butter in summer-time, add to it about a tea-spoonful of finely-chopped parsley, chopped on a chopping-board previously rubbed over with a shallot ; mix this in with a good-sized tea-spoonful of French mustard flavoured with tarragon. The mayon- naise sauce is supposed to contain sufficient vinegar or dilute acetic acid. Grilled salmon is more suitable for three or four persons than for a large party, as few fires are capable of cooking more than two slices at a time, and one slice is only sufflcient for two persons.

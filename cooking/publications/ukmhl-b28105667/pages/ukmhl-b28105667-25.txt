21 KITCHEN ECONOMY. say eight persons ; the ordinary method being for a lobster to be ordered, the white part of the meat cut up and put into some melted butter, while the pickings, so called, generally make a tit-bit at the kitchen supper, with the usual accompaniment of at least a pint of vinegar. Now, what is the difficulty ? First, even a small lobster is amply sufficient to supply sauce for double the number. Everyone who has eyes, and knows how to use them, must have observed how in- variably it is the case that in small households fish sauce of any description is always made in gigantic proportions. We have seen melted butter of the con- sistency of a pudding brought up for four persons, in quantity sufficient for the table d'hote at the Grand Hotel in Paris.

Cut open the lobster and remove the whole of the meat, including that in the claws, and cut it up into small pieces, and put it on a plate and place it in a cool place, to be used as we shall explain by-and-by.

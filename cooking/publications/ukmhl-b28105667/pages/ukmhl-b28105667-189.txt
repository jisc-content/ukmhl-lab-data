185 FOOD FOR INVALIDS. and at the doctor’s order. There are many means, however, by which little children can be persuaded to take things, which sensible mothers probably know of. In the case of beef-tea an admirable plan is, instead of using salt, use a little sugar, and make the beef-tea sweet. Grown-up persons would probably consider such a mixture nasty to a degree ; not so, however, the child. Young children have a natural taste for sweet things, and a natural dislike to salt.

The next dish of importance for consideration is arro\vroot. First I would strongly recommend the Bermuda arrowroot, and not the St. Vincent ; the latter is cheaper, but very inferior in quahty. Bad arrowroot is absolutely unwholesome, and a good deal of the bad arrowroot—too bad, in fact, to be sold as arrowroot at all—is, I fear, used to mix with and adul- terate corn-flour.

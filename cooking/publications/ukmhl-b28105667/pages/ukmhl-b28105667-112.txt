io8 PRACTICAL HOME COOKERY. round with a blanket or tliick cloth, it is wonderfu how little will melt even in a long journey. We will run hastily through the ordinary picnic dishes, with a word or tv\"0 to say on each. First, cold lamb and mint sauce. Bear in mind that the former is very apt to turn quickly in hot weather, especially if packed close, or put in a hamper near the top exposed to the sun. Pepper the joint, and wrap it up in cool cabbage-leaves. The mint sauce must be put in a small bottle, a stone ginger-beer bottle being as good as anything. Second, lobster salad. This, of course, is dressed on the ground. Take care, however, in packing the lobsters, that they do not impart a fishy flavour to everytlung else. A few hard-boiled eggs should be taken to garnish the salad. Pigeon pie. A good pigeon pie ought to have plenty of gravy, and this gravy when cold should be properly a firm jelly. I recollect once in a picnic the pigeon pie had leaked, and the gravy had soaked quite through the table-cloth, which had been placed folded up near it in the hamper. Now a very httle trouble would have avoided this in making the gravy for the pie, bearing in mind the time of year, and how unhkely gravy is to set firm unless made exceedingly strong. All the cook has to do is to put in a little gelatine. This will ensure the gravy being firm when cold. A cucumber properly dressed is an exceedingly nice accompaniment to cold fowl and cold meat in hot weather, and perhaps never appears to better advantage than at a picnic. A cucumber improperly dressed is a very different thing, however. Who has not at times at hotels or restaurants met with the small glass dish containing thin shoes of cucumber soaked in vinegar, on which float a few spots of oil, looking more like the fat on beef-tea before it is cold ?

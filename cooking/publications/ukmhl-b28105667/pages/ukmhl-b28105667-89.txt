SPRING DISHES. 85 it is one of those things which, if it is possible, the mistress of the house should do herself. New potatoes differ from old in this important respect : in cooking, the latter require cold water ; the former, boiling water. In both cases salt must be put in the water, about a table-spoonful to every two quarts. Like peas, new potatoes are best when fresh from the garden. When really young, the skin will rub off with a cloth. They vary in the time they take to boil from a quarter of an hour to twenty-five minutes ; but the best plan is to wait a reasonable time, and try one with a fork and see if it is tender, when they should be immediately strained off, as, if they are allowed to boil too long, they will get pappy. Let them dry in the saucepan, and when dry, put them into the vegetable- dish, with either a lump of butter—which will melt, and make them look oily—or a little good melted butter made with milk, into which has been put a little finely- chopped parsley, may be poured over each potato. Perhaps the piece of plain butter is best, however. There are, especially in early spring, large numbers of potatoes sold that pretend to be new, but are not. What they are, or where they come from (some say Holland), I don’t know, but they are not worth eating, and it is just as well to know it. If anybody who under- stands the swindle will explain, I should feel much obliged. To boil fish such as salmon is really very easy, but requires care. The fish must be placed in cold water, to which plenty of salt has been added—about six table-spoonfuls to every gallon of water, or nearly a pound of salt. Take care, also, that the water covers the fish, and that the latter is thoroughly clean. Rub the spine, which is apt to contain httle clots of blood, with a lump of salt. Salmon always tastes best when boiled whole. When the water boils, take care to

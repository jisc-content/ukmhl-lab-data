WEDDING BREAKFASTS. i8i it again. Now has that fact anything to do with all this outlay, which you know you can’t afford ? Very likely ; but then it is really very snobbish. No, pater- familias, don’t show off, and no one will think a whit the worse of you for it. Pocket your £50, give quite a plain breakfast—no champagne at all—brave the world, and then furnish a room in the new house with the money, and instead of calling it “ the breakfast- room,” call it “ the wedding-breakfast room.” One word in conclusion. If you will give champagne, give it good, or they will all laugh at you—they will indeed, they will laugh. Young men, bachelor friends of your son-in-law, will say, ” Did you taste that fellow’s wine ? Wasn’t it awful ? ”—which will call forth the remark, ” Ah, I don’t suppose he had opened many before.” Therefore, whatever you do, give good cham- pagne, or none.

THE FRYING-PAN. 15 teetotum. Of course, such cases are exceptional, but I have known a grouse stuffed with sage and onion. On another occasion a couple were sent to a farmer’s wife to be got ready for lunch. This was adjoining the moor where they were shot. The party, to their astonishment, found them boiled. While the fish is draining is a good opportunity to fry a httle parsley to put round it. All that is required is fresh, clean parsley—dry. A minute is sufficient to leave it in the fat, if the fat boils. Take out the parsley with a slice, and let it dry on the cloth by the side of the fish. It wiU soon become crisp. A large wire slice will be found better than an ordinary one.

When, how- ever, it is, you can always mend the patch with a pinch of raspings. Now, the greatest difficulty in following these directions wiU probably be found to be “ the quantity of fat.” It is always a sore point with the cooks. They look upon fat as one of their perquisites, and too often the mistress will find that she has to be con- stantly ordering in a skin of lard, or has to order drip- ping, in order to fry fish. RecoUect, however, that the same fat will do to fry fish over and over again—though it should be kept entirely for fish—and that it will often keep for months.

Were ladies to insist on this, which they could always do with young servants, much mischief would be avoided. Selling dripping and candle-grease is often the thin end of the wedge to downright theft. The class of

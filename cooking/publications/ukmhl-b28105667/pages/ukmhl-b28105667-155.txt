CHRISTMAS DINNERS. 151 This will make the stuffing that nine persons out of ten really prefer, but do not hke to say so. If, therefore, you really wish to have the stuffing nxild, the only difference must be, you must cut out the cores of the onions and partially boil them, and let them drain on a napkin ; this takes away considerably the strong onion-flavour of wliich some persons are not very fond. Fill the goose with the stufhng, and roast it before a quick fire. Care must be taken that the goose is well tied up, to prevent the stuffing coming out at one end, or its getting filled with grease during basting at the other. A good-sized goose only requires one hour and a half to roast, and the general fault is that people will over-roast them, and dry them up.

Serve some rich brown gravy and apple sauce in a separate tureen, as you will be sure to splash the gravy in carving the goose if any is put on the dish. With regard to roast turkey I can only say that no possible time can be given for roasting, as they vary so—especially in the present day of plump prize birds—that even the weight would be no criterion.

When you use a quarter of a pound of beef suet, a quarter of a lemon is amply sufficient. To this quantity may be added a couple of tea-spoonfuls of dried mixed stuffing-herbs (which can be bought in bottles at Covent Garden Market), two ounces of lean ham, rather more than a quarter of a pound of bread-crumbs, two eggs, a little

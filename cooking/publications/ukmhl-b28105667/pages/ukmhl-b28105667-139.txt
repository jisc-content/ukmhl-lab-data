GAME AND GRAVY. 135 added to the gravy. After this has stood some time, untie the jar and add the gravy, with a small piece of cinnamon, six cloves, two bay-leaves, and the juice of half a lemon. The gravy should be strongly impreg- nated with onion, and should be thickened with a little arrowroot rather than with brown thickening. The port will materially assist the colour ; a good spoonful of red-currant jelly may also be added to it and dissolved in it, though in addition red-currant jelly will be handed round with it. Next place this jar up to its neck in a large saucepan of boiling water, only take care that the jar is well tied down, or much of the flavour will be lost ; allow this to remain in the boding water for about an hour to an hour and a half, when it will be found to be sufficiently done, as jugged hare, hke roast hare, is generally over-cooked father than under. Stuffing- balls should be added to it, but not cooked with it. For this purpose prepare some stuffing as directed for roast hare. Roll this stuffing into small balls, a little larger than marbles, and throw them into some boiling fat. A few minutes will be sufficient to cook them ; drain them on a cloth and make them hot in the oven before adding them to the jugged hare. As I before mentioned, hare soup is best made from fresh hare, in which case as much as possible of the blood of the hare should be preserved, and used in the soup. However, it will be often found ex- pedient to use up the remains of the jugged hare by converting it into hare soup for the following day. I will proceed to explain the best method of doing this : —First you must have ready some really good stock ; next pick out all the best-looking pieces of meat—httle slices from the back are best—and put them by on a plate, to be added to the soup at the last moment ; next take all the remains of the hare, add it to the stock with, if possible, a head of celery ; let it all boil

13 THE FRYING-PAN. weight is off your mind ; all you now have to do is to cook it so that it is done through without being dried up. Now for this purpose you must have a certain depth of lard or dripping, or it cannot be done. Properly speaking, there ought to be enough fat to cover the fish. However, it is no use writing for things as they ought to be ; it is more practical to write for things as they are. You must have enough fat at least to dip the sole in. Of course, it is impossible to draw any exact line between a single drop of fat and a gallon. What we mean is, it is no use to try to fry fish in a fr^dng-pan that has had a little piece of butter put in it, just sufficient to prevent the fish from sticking. A properly fried fish is one which has been boiled in fat. If, therefore, you have not sufficient to cover the sole, it will be necessary to cook one side first, and then the other. With regard to the time it takes, this, of course, altogether depends on the thickness of the fish. If you have enough fat to cover the fish, the very largest sole would not take more than ten minutes. The mistake generally made in frying fish is to over- cook it. A properly fried sole must appear moist inside on hfting the meat from the bone. Still, the meat must not stick to the bone, or look red. How- ever, with regard to time, experience alone will teach, but recollect an under-cooked fish can always be warmed up, and an over-cooked oneâ€”never. Besides, a begin- ner can lift the fish off the fire after a few minutes, take a knife, and look at the meat nearest the bone in the thickest part. If it is white, and not transparent, it is done enough, and a pinch of raspings hides the place. With a cook, however, of almost any experience, this is unnecessary. Another exceedingly important point is, the fat must be boiling. This can generally be found out by dropping a single drop of cold water into it, and if it

II THE FRYING-PAN. selves to the “ frying-pan,” one of the most useful and, at the same time, abused articles of kitchen use. We will suppose that a certain dish consists of something fried. Perhaps one or two are expected to dinner who are known or supposed to be rather par- ticular. The mistress has consulted the cookery-book, which gravely recommends as follows :—” Fry of a nice golden-colour, and serve hot.” How to do it, however, we are not informed.

Who has not occasionally in small families noticed the slight passing shadow of annoyance on the face of the hostess, as she becomes aware of some such little contretemps ?—in which, perhaps, a very close observer of human nature might detect the thought: ” It will never warm up for breakfast.” Now, is it possible to write clear directions, so that anyone with an average amount of common sense can, by following them, fry fish, sweetbreads, etc., which will combine colour with quality ? We believe it is possible ; at any rate, it is worth the attempt. All fish that has to be fried with egg and bread- crumbs must be treated alike in this respect. The

122 CHAPTER XIV. GAME AND GRAVY. “ The month ’tis now September ; the season has begun when Enghsh customs give us game, when dinner’s almost done.” Now for my own part I think we often rather waste our game in this country, by bringing it in when really everybody has dined ; or if some one has what may be called reserved himself, he probably finds he gets such an exceedingly small portion that he runs considerable risk of going home hungry. I recollect an old story of a notorious gourmand, who was asked to dine with a so-called friend, who played upon him the following cruel practical joke:— A little soup and fish was followed by a plain leg of mutton, and the gourmand was informed that he saw his dinner before him. He accordingly gorged freely, while his host scarcely tasted a mouthful. The leg of mutton was, however, followed by a splendid haunch of venison. ” It was cruel not to tell me,” said the guest, with tears of anguish rolling down his cheeks. The story does not sound like a true one, and we trust for the sake of human nature it is not ; but it exemphfies our point in saying, or rather asking, is it not a mistake when game is cheap and plentiful, to leave it quite to the last ? I must say I admire the good, honest English hos- pitality of the North. It may be called the Black Country, but as long as black is associated with black- cock and grouse, long may it remain so.

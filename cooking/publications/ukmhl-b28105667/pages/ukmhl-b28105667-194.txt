190 PRACTICAL HOME COOKERY. As a rule, in cooking for real invalids, the aim should be nourishment combined with the greatest simplicity of flavour. There are, however, of course, many cases where the palate has to be tickled, while at the same time the digestion has to be consulted. In these cases the cook’s art is often put to the test. In many cases of diseases that may be termed wasting, really rich but, at the same time, light dishes are requisite. We would instance sweetbreads, stewed oysters, calves’ brains, lambs’ tails, etc. ; but to enter into an elaborate account of the proper method of preparing such delicacies would be out of place in an article on invalid food, wliich is of necessity cursory. Objections have, however, ofttimes been made to cookery as an art, when the object in view has been simply to stir up the jaded appetite in the overfed, whose proper treatment would be in accordance with the famous advice of Abernethy to the dyspeptic aider- man—viz. “ Live on a shilhng a day, and earn it.” When, however, our object is to alleviate those who suffer from disease, and who loathe food unless brought to them in a palatable form, even those who lead lives that may be termed severely simple wiU admit that, skiU in the preparation of food may at times vie with, and even excel, skill in the preparation of drugs.

41 COLD LEG OF MUTTON. to the English, though probably the highest class English cooks are better than the best French. Compare, for instance, a French pastrycook’s window in Paris with one of a similar class in London. In the above directions, recollect that there was some stock made. Now this stock, if it was required, would make a httle soup in a few minutes ; the ad- dition of a little extract of meat, and a good pinch of vermicelli, being all that would be required.

She probably orders a pheasant, or any bird in season ; some gravy-beef to make gravy ; perhaps, in addition, a mould of jelly from the pastrycook’s, which is not cut after dinner at all. Ah ! Mrs. A. B., a little more pains taken to make

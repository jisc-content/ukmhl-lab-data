PRACTICAL HOME COOKERY. 76 the turkey ; the shape of the bird and a little taste will tell you about where. A tongue can be glazed in an exactly similar manner, a curly paper frill tied round the root, and a flower placed on it. So, too, a ham can be glazed. But there is one method of ornamenting a ham which deserves notice. We will suppose the ham ready glazed. Have you ever seen one, the top round the rim ornamented with a white substance which looks like beautiful white fresh butter, or even sugar ? Now, it is very easy to ornament a glazed ham with this composition, and one advantage is, you can put words on the ham, such as “ A Merry Christmas,” or, on the occasion of a child’s birthday, the name of the hero of the feast. The way to do it is as follows ;—Get some nice white clarified lard, and melt it in a cup in the oven, and add a little salad oil to it, so as to make it thinner when it is cold. Next roll up a sheet of fairly stiff note-paper like a cone, and hold this cone near the point in the right hand. Pour a little of the hot lard into the cone, and so regulate the pressure on the paper with the right- hand thumb and finger as to allow the melted lard to drop out or run in a very thin stream at the point. This lard will settle directly it comes out, and turn quite white on getting perfectly cold. I would advise you to practise designs on a black shining tea-tray, as it will scrape off with a spoon and do again. With a httle practise and a natural gift for such things—for a clumsy- fisted Mary Ann would make an awful mess of it—it is wonderful what beautiful designs can be formed this way, such as a harp or' a rose. In making a spiral border round the edge of the ham, it sometimes looks a little prettier to have a small

i68 PRACTICAL HOME COOKERY. the one secret of success in the management of a little dinner consisting of a variety of dishes is—forethought. The cook should consequently divide the dinner into two distinct classes—viz, those dishes which can be cooked beforehand—i.e. in the morning of the day— and those which require cooking at the last moment. To illustrate what I mean, I would mention stewed eels and whitebait. It is obvious that the first can be prepared hours beforehand, and will simply require warming up, but that the latter cannot be cooked till within a minute of its being sent to table, I will now give a list of fish from which the fish dinner can be chosen, but at the same time would strongly recommend, where it is possible, some com- mon-sense person to go early in the morning to Billings- gate Market, and pick out, say, half a dozen different kinds of fish, of course choosing those that are in season, and consequently cheapest; flounders, souchet and fried ; eels, souchet, fried, and stewed ; salmon, plain boiled and with piccalilly sauce ; red mullet, en papillote ; soles, filleted and fried ; whiting ; turbot, boiled ; smelts ; lobster cutlets ; whitebait, ordinary and devilled ; shrimps, curried.

I would, however, at starting, remind you that the dish in a fish dinner is the whitebait. We will first start in the dining-room, and suppose the time to be the hour of dinner. The table is laid for four ; a green glass is placed, in addition to an ordinary sherry one, by the right-hand side of each person. The sherry is tapped, and let us trust it is dry, and free from fire, as sweet sherry is quite out of

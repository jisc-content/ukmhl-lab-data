i88 PRACTICAL HOME COOKERY. required poured out, as it settles and does not look nice—milky at the bottom and watery at the top. Next, toast-and-water. First, “ how not to do it.” You will find a servant generally cut off a knobby piece of crust, stick a toasting-fork in it, and toast it very black, put this in a jug, and pour boihng water over it, and this great hunk of bread will be floating at the top. Tills toast-and-water will be poor, muddy-looking, and have a slightly floury taste. The proper method is to cut the bread thin, and toast both sides thoroughly, and also have plenty of it. Let the bread be toasted through —i.e. let the bread be toasted so as to be thorougliJy dried up. Then pour the boihng water on it, and, if liked, add a small piece of lemon-peel. Let tliis be carefully drained off, so that no crumbs remain in the fluid after it has got cold ; and this toast-and-water, which will look bright like sherry, will be a welcome draught to the feverish invalid. To make bread-and-milk, you must cut the bread up into small square pieces, and pour boihng milk on them. There are a good many persons who don’t fancy bread-and-milk, who will yet take toast-and-milk. For this purpose you must pour the boihng milk over small pieces of toast similar to those that would be handed round with pea-soup. In making bread-and-milk for infants, it is generally recommended to pour boihng water on the bread, and then drain it off, and then add the milk, as the boihng water renders the bread softer ; and as medical men generally recommend a httle water to be mixed with the milk for very young children, it will not be weaker. It is not for me to put up my opinion against the medical profession, but in London I would recommend mothers to give their children the milk pure when they have to buy it. I fear that many of the cows that supply London have iron tails, and that the doctor’s recom-

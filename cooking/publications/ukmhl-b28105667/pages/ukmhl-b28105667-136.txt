132 PRACTICAL HOME COOKERY. to shoot the hare ; I fear the cook who depended upon “ reading ” for her knowledge of larding woidd miss her mark, as surely as the sportsman whose sole experience consisted of a similar kind would miss his. There is an old saying, “ A disease once known is half-cured ; ” the disease, so to speak, against which we have to contend is dryness. In roasting a hare, therefore, bear in mind the importance of basting, and also of not letting the hare be too close to the fire in the early stage of roasting. But to begin at the begin- ning ; We will suppose the hare caught and hung up, head downwards, in his fur jacket. Now the first thing to be thought of is the length of time that a hare should be kept before it is cooked. This entirely depends upon the weather ; a perfectly fresh hare should never be cooked unless the whole of it is in- tended for hare-soup, which is rarely the case save is small private houses. Some persons prefer the hare absolutely high ; the best course is a happy medium between being too high and too fresh, and cooks should bear in mind that what often appears very high and offensive when raw, becomes perfectly right when cooked. We will not dwell upon that not very agreeable but still necessary process of skinning the hare, but will at once commence to make the stuflhng, which must be tied up inside it. Ordinary veal stuffing, as it is gener- ally called, is best for the purpose, and, as I think I have before pointed out, the most common fault is too much lemon.

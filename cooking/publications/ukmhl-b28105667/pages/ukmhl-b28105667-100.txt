96 PRACTICAL HOME COOKERY. repeating the recipe or custom used in ninety-nine out of a hundred French restaurants. First get two or three small French cabbage-lettuces. Wash them, if necessary, in a little cold water, but do not dry them on a cloth, as you will thereby probably bruise them and spoil them. Shake them dry in a little wire basket ; or put them in a cloth, and take the cloth by the four corners, and make the lettuce-leaves jump inside ; then put them lightly into a salad-bowl. Next chop up enough parsley to cover a threepenny-piece, and also chop three fresh mint-leaves, and sprinkle this over the lettuce. Next take a table-spoon, and place in it about half a salt-spoonful of salt, and a quarter of pepper ; fill the table-spoon with oil. Mix up the pepper and salt with the oil, and pour it over the lettuce— I am supposing enough for about four persons—and half a table-spoonful more oil, and toss the lettuce lightly together for two or three minutes. Next add not quite half a table-spoonful of French wlfite vinegar ; mix it for a minute or two more, and it is finished. Now the difficulty in many households is to over- come the prejudice against the oil. Perhaps some one, when they have read this, will do as follows : First take care to have a fresh bottle of good oil ; then mix a salad as I have directed, without telling anybody how it is done. Let it be handed round at dinner- time, and wait and see what people say. If you tell them beforehand that there is nearly two table-spoon- fuls of oil, they probably will make up their minds beforehand that it is nasty ; but say nothing, and give the recipe a fair chance. There are two additions to a salad which many thank an advantage : one is to chop up with the parsley and mint one fresh tarragon-leaf ; another is to rub a crust of bread with a piece of garlic, and then

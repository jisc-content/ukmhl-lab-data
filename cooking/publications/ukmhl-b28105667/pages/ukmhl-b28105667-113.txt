PICNIC DAINTIES. 109 How utterly uneatable is the cucumber in question, simply because the waiter was too ignorant to know how to dress it ! The cucumber must be sliced very thin, and of course all the green peel removed before shcing. These slices must next be placed in a dish with a good-sized pinch of salt, and then covered with fresh oil, and well mixed up ; they may now be peppered and mixed again, the vinegar, in very small quantities, being added, last of all. The cucumber, being well covered with oil to begin with, will not soak up the vinegar and taste like sour pickle. Later on we will give directions how to make claret- cup. When claret-cup is required for a picnic, it will be found best to take ready mixed in a small bottle some plain syrup, and also in another bottle a httle sherry, brandy, and noyeau, mixed in the proportions I named before. All, therefore, that is required is a strip of the peel from the cucumber and a slice of lemon to be added to a bottle of claret, the mixed wine and spirit out of the bottle next, a little syrup, a lump of ice, and a couple of bottles of soda-water to finish with. An exceedingly delicious and at the same time unintoxicating drink is some syrup of pineapple or other flavoured syrup added to a bottle of soda- water and a lump of ice. Many other beverages will occur to the reader as suitable for occasions like these. Perhaps the most important element towards the success of a picnic is good temper and the absence of selfishness. Just as on board ship there seems a sort of mutual under- standing that every one must be pleasant, so is there in these httle happy gatherings. Of course, too, much depends on the selection of the company. Avoid asking those who invariably act as wet blankets on anything approaching to fun or merriment.

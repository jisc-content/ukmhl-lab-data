120 PRACTICAL HOME COOKERY. boiling water, and pour it on the pulp of, say, three lemons, with a small piece of peel, but not too much, as it will render the lemonade bitter. Add white sugar to taste ; of course, children hke it sweeter than others. Let it get cold, and then strain it. Care should be taken that all the pips are removed from the pulp before the boiUng water is added. A great improve- ment to tliis kind of lemonade is the addition of a little dilute sulphuric acid, about thirty drops to a quart. Tliirty drops of dilute sulphuric acid, when freely diluted, can be taken at one dose without any fear, though of course such a dose must not be taken without a doctor’s order ; but the addition of it to a whole quart of lemonade has the effect of rendering it much more palatable ; and were a person to drink the whole quart, which is improbable, it would not do them the slightest possible harm. Dilute sulphuric acid is a simple but valuable medicine, particularly useful in summer. Those who prefer sparkhng lemonade had better try the following method, and then let them judge for themselves whether it is not infinitely superior to the ordinary bottled lemonade :—Squeeze a lemon through a little piece of muslin into a tumbler, and have the patience to wait while a couple of lumps of sugar dissolve in it. Then add some iced soda-water and stir it up, taking care it is not half lost by frothing over the tumbler. Soda-water can be bought now very good at one shilhng and ninepence a dozen. Mixed with a httle fruit-essence or French syrup, or raspberry vinegar, it makes most dehcious drinks, especially if iced. Let me, therefore, entreat ladies who, during this hot weather, when they feel at times exhausted, have been in the habit of taking either weak brandy-and-water or sherry-and-water, to try one of these kinds of syrup

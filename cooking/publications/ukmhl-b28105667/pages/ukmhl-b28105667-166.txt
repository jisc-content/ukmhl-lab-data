But to proceed—we consider real turtle rather an exception to general rules :— Take a pound and a half of gravy-beef, an equal quantity of knuckle of veal, and one slice of lean raw ham, and place them in a large saucepan, which we wiU suppose to be perfectly clean, lid as well. Place in also the following :—One head of celery, two onions —one of which has half a dozen cloves stuck in it—a small turnip and carrot, about as much parsley as would fill a tea-cup, two tea-spoonfuls of dried mar- joram, two tea-spoonfuls of dried basil, half a tea- spoonful of lemon-thyme, and rather less than half a tea-spoonful of a herb called pennyroyal. All these herbs can be obtained at Covent Garden Market in sixpenny and shilling bottles, the latter herb being sold by the bunch. Add a small tea-spoonful of salt and a little cayenne pepper, bearing in mind that these last commodities vary considerably in strength, and that it is always easy to add more, but impossible to take back. Fill the saucepan, which ought to be a gallon one, nearly full with cold water. Put it on the fire to simmer gently for at least twelve hours, occasion- ally skimming off any scum that may have risen.

Inexperienced cooks would do well to bear in mind the following maxim :—If soup he left in the saucepan all night, it will be utterly spoilt. When the above has simmered long enough, and has been reduced by this means to about two quarts.

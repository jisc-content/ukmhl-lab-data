6i BREAKFAST DISHES. being eggs eaten with bread-and-butter. I would first remind them that the eggs and the butter in the shape of an omelette would be just the same, as far as ex- pense goes ; but I would protest against the custom of the day of young men eating, comparatively speak- ing, no breakfast, but taking a heavy meat meal in the middle of the day, about one or two o’clock, and then going back to work. A look into the City dining- rooms in the middle of the day, shows to how great an extent this practice is carried, and also suggests how very unintellectual the greater part of City work must be. Really to work with the brains immediately after an early dinner is, if not impossible, at any rate injurious. Probably the seeds of chronic dyspepsia are sown by this unwise habit. What men should do is to eat a good hearty break- fast ; take a light lunch, say a few biscuits, or at the outside a piece of bread-and-cheese and a glass of ale, if this latter has not the effect of incapacitating them for work ; and then to make a good dinner at six or seven o’clock, or later, as the case may be. There is one thing in connection with breakfast that should not be omitted to be mentioned, and that is coffee. How it is that, as a rule, good coffee can no more be obtained in England than tea in France, is difficult to say. One great secret, however, of French coffee is that it is always not only fresh ground, but ousted. I would therefore briefly advise you, in reference to coffee, first to buy it in the nibs, and grind it yourself ; secondly, never to grind it till just before you want it ; thirdly, before grinding it heat the coffee in the oven for a few minutes—this latter having the effect of bringing out the flavour ; lastly, do not grudge the coffee.

GAME AND GRAVY. 127 or even a small pheasant, by putting them down as soon as the soup is served. In any case tell the cook never to put down game until they know that dinner may be served. The late arrival of some important guest should never be the excuse of over-cooked game. It would be far better to have a shght pause in the middle of the dinner than to have things spoilt. Besides, a pause after soup, fish, entrees, and joint is never objec- tionable. Another important point is the basting. Game should be basted directly it is put down. Ordinary dripping is quite good enough to commence with, but it will be found an improvement if during the last five minutes a httle butter is used instead. Baste quickly with a httle butter, and froth it at the same time, shaking a little fine dried flour over the breast out of a flour-dredger. When this is done, let the game be sent up immediately. Treat it, in fact, like a souffle, which everybody knows, or ought to know, requires a running-man for a waiter to be served properly. In making bread sauce, it will be generally found that cooks make it a long time before dinner—in fact, putting in the bread-crumbs, so to speak, to soak in a saucepan, with an onion, in a httle milk. The result often is that the milk all dries up, and the sauce gets burnt ; a fresh lot has to be made in a hurry, and a sort of bread poultice is sent to table. There is, however, a good deal of difference between bread sauce and a bread poultice. The way to make the former is as fohows : Have ready some dry bread-crumbs, put these in some milk, or, stih better, cream, and boil them, with an onion and a few peppercorns, for about ten minutes ; take out the onion, add a pinch of salt, and a httle butter, keep stirring tih the butter is dissolved and well mixed in ; add, if you like, a suspicion of nutmeg, and the sauce is finished. Take care in taking out the onion

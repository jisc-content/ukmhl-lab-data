34 PRACTICAL HOME COOKERY. It will generally be found that things are nicest when cheapest; for instance, strawberries are never so good as when they can be bought for 6d. a basket. Who the people are that buy the peaches at 5s. each, pines at a guinea, and green peas at los. a pint, I cannot say, but that such people exist is evident from a walk through Covent Garden Market. Such sort of extravagance seems to me to be hardly consistent with good moral character. There is a story told of a lady who was particularly fond of the “ Pope’s eye ” in a leg of mutton, and would often have a dozen legs ordered, simply for the sake of cutting out the “ Pope’s eyes,” the rest of the meat being given to hounds. The story, however, sounds too wicked to be true. I heard a delightful story, a short time ago, of an extravagant husband who was blessed, or cursed, as the case may be, with a wife who may be described as ” a little near.” In expectation of a dinner-party, which to him was a business dinner, expecting as he did some friends from the City, he ordered a salmon from his fishmonger, the price being £\. Fearing, how- ever, that his better half would find fault with the price, and being anxious to prove himself good at a bargain, he paid down los., and sent home the fish as if the remaining los. was the whole charge. On his return, his wife, with great glee told him how she had disposed of the fish to her friend Mrs. , who had called, seen the fish, and, thinking it remark- ably cheap, had offered 15s. for it, which offer had been gladly accepted. The wretched man’s feelings can be better imagined than described ; but the moral of the story, which is really true, seems to be—Don’t deceive your wife !

COOLING DRINKS. 117 more grateful than after a long pull on the river on a hot day. Of course the basis of claret-cup is claret; but one word of warning somewhat similar to that we gave in connection with turtle soup. It is impossible to make a good cup out of really bad claret; I do not mean cheap claret, but sour. It is quite possible to get a good sound wine for twenty-four shilhngs a dozen, or even less ; but at the same time it is quite possible to pay more, and get a sour compound that would be unfit for cup or any other purpose. On the other hand, to use really good claret, such as Chateau Margaux or Chateau Latour, for making cup, would be as bad as using 1834 port to make negus. Perhaps the most difficult point to determine in making claret-cup is its sweetness. Now, as this is purely a matter of taste, I would recommend persons to err on the side of too Httle sugar rather than too much, as it is always easy to add, but impossible to take away. Take, therefore, about an ounce and a half of white sugar, and dissolve it by pouring a table-Spoonful of hot water on it, and afterwards adding a little claret. I have always found this plan best, as otherwise the sugar is apt to settle at the bottom of the cup or jug, thereby often making the compound not quite sweet enough at starting, and a great deal too sweet at the finish. We will suppose, therefore, that the sugar is com- pletely dissolved, and added to a whole bottle of claret in the jug or cup selected for the purpose. Add two thin shces of lemon—cut across the lemon, care being taken to avoid any pips—and one thin slice of cucumber- peehng about as long and as broad as the first finger, and the thickness of the blade of a dinner-knife. Next add one sherry-glassful of sherry, one table-spoonful of

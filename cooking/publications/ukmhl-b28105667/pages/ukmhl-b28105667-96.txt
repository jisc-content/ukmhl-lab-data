As the process is somewhat trouble- some, and a large quantity is as easy to make as a small one, it will be found best to make sufficient to last some time, as brown thickening will keep good for months if made properly. Take half a pound of flour, and, having thoroughly dried it on a large newspaper before the fire, sift it carefully. Next take half a pound of butter and melt it in an enamelled saucepan ; a sort of white curdled substance will be generally found mixed with it, some of which can be skimmed off the top, and some will settle at the bottom. Skim the butter and pour off all that is as clear as good salad oil, and only use this for the brown thickening. Next mix thoroughly well together the sifted flour and the hot melted butter in an enamelled stew-pan, and stir it over a quick fire with a wooden spoon. If the flour has been properly dried, and the butter properly clarified, the whole mass will stick together and shake about in the stew-pan. The stirring must be continued till the whole mass begins to turn colour. As soon as it has obtained a light fawn-colour, or looks like the outside of a nicely-baked French roll, remove the stew- pan from the fire, but still continue stirring. Throw in a large shce of onion ; this will help to check the heat, and at the same time assist in giving the thickening a nice flavour. It is wonderful how long an enamelled stew-pan will retain the heat. It would be a good lesson to an inexperienced cook to watch for how long a period the butter and flour will go on bubbhng after the stew- pan has been taken off the fire. It depends of course on the thickness of the stew-pan, but this frying process will go on sometimes for ten minutes, or even longer, after it has been moved on to a cold slab. This fact will explain why hashes and stews are so often tough.

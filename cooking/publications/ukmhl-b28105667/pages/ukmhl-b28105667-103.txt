99 SALADS. the latter, while far more luxurious, is at the same time far more economical. If there is any dish in the world that varies more than another, probably it is a salad, and at the same time it may be considered as one of the cheapest of modern luxuries, which by some is considered almost an essential to the every-day dinner. Contrast what we may call the early English style with the modern French. First, that huge lettuce, sliced up, saturated in a pint or two of vinegar ; it never even reached the dignity of being eaten alone, but was considered a proper accompaniment to a strong cheese, the un- avoidable noise made in masticating it unfortunately invariably drowning what httle conversation there was. Second, the salade d la Frangaise as one gets it in Paris—soft, delicious, digestible, and somehow or other containing some subtle flavour that seems at present to have baffled the research of the most in- telligent foreigner with the astutest taste. Of course, too, tastes differ and require training. Many of the lower orders in this country, were they to see a French- man in humble life dress a salad, using the oil as he does, would regard him with feelings somewhat akin to what the Frenchman would feel were he to witness the national feat of drinking off a quart of adulterated beer as an appetiser before breakfast. Each country- man would regard the other as a beast. But we must come to the practical part of our subject, and endeavour to improve upon the lettuce and vinegar, though by preface we would state that that by no means small class who think the best part of the salad is the vinegar —which they keep to the last, like a child with the jam part of a tart, and lap up finally with the assistance of a blade of a steel knife—will find but little instruction from our remarks. We will commence with giving simple instructions

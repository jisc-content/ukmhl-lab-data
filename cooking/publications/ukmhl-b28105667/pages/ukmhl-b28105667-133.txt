GAME AND GRAVY. 129 3, stcw-p3,n 3,iid. then cLcid the rGimins of fhe g3,in6, cut off as neatly as possible ; let it soak in the gravy, but do not let it boil i about a cj^^rter of an hour before serving, add a wine-glassful of madeira, or good golden sherry. A pale dry sherry is not nearly so good for the purpose. It is really the addition of the wine that makes the gravy into the salmi sauce—just as in nearly all the French restaurants in London it will often be seen in the bill of fare, something with sauce Mad ere, which simply means some ordinary gravy to which has been added a spoonful of sherry. To make fried bread-crumbs—the best accom- paniment to grouse—a clear fire is necessary.

As soon as they are sufficiently brown, place them on some blotting-paper, in order that all the grease may be soaked up. The blotting-paper can be placed in front of the fire, and the bread-crumbs tossed lightly about with a fork. The bread-crumbs can be made hot in the oven when required for use, but should not be allowed to remain m too long, as they are apt to get too hard and crisp, and thereby get converted into tooth-breakers. As we have said before, game, at any rate in this country, is far too good a thing to be left to the last, and then to be brought forward only in mouthfuls. The fact is, we are all of us to a great extent creatures of habit. We, as a rule, do what other people do, without reasoning whether it is right or wrong, good or bad, but simply because we shrink from drawing out I

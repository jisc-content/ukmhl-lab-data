FISH DINNERS. 175 the ordinary, second the devilled ; thin brown bread and butter should be handed round with it, besides some lemon cut into quarters. It wiU sometimes be found that with whitebait are mixed a few shrimps or very small eels ; these should properly be removed before sending to table, as they have the effect of destroying the appearance. It may perhaps seem superfluous to add, that white- bait requires no sauce, yet the following conversation actually occurred at North Woolwich, where whitebait are caught and cooked in the greatest perfection :— Visitor. Waiter, these whitebait are not so nice as they were last time.” PFazVer.—” Perhaps, ma’am, you would like them better if you did not take anchovy sauce.” On one occasion some persons demanded melted butter with their whitebait. Whitebait in perfection should be small, but near the end of the season are, of course, far larger and by no means so delicate as in early spring. Waiters are proverbial for presence of mind, and on one occasion, when the whitebait was brought up, about the size of sprats, quietly answered the intended complaint of ” Waiter, these whitebait are very large,” by saying—” Yes, sir—very fine, sir.” The curried shrimps are generally served last of all, and then some meat—generally a roast fowl or duck but, as a rule, no one eats much of this after all this fish. In a private house it would be better to have a little cold roast beef and salad to finish up with, as in ordinary kitchens a roast duck or fowl would be terribly in the way during cooking the dinner.

This may have been, and should be, made long before ; some curried mutton the day before for dinner will be found an advisable dish, as the sauce left will do for the shrimps, and a very httle is necessary. Cuny sauce is made by frying, say, six large onions in a stew-pan with butter till they are browned ; three large apples added, and dissolved in it, some brown gravy, the whole thing rubbed through a tanning or sieve, taking care that all the onion is rubbed through ; then a table- spoonful of curry paste and a dessert-spoonful of curry- powder added, and the whole thickened with brown thickening to its proper consistency. Have ready, hot, about half a tea-cupful of this sauce, add to it about half a salt-spoonful of anchovy sauce, put the shrimps in it for one minute only, turn them out, and serv'e some plain boiled rice with them on a separate plate. Next, the red mullet. First take a piece of white foolscap paper, and oil it all over, next chop up a tea- spoonful of capers fine, next cut up into slices about three ounces of butter, lay the slices on the paper, sprinkle half the chopped capers on it, pepper and salt it, and lay the mullet on the butter, on its side, put the rest of the butter on the top with the capers and a little more pepper and salt, fold the paper over, and fold the edges over and over, so as to make the fools- cap sheet of paper into the shape of those old-fashioned apple turnoversâ€”a fat semicircle ; put this into a tin greased at the bottom to prevent the paper sticking, and put it in the oven. A small muUet will bake in half an hour ; a very large one, nearly an hour. Send the fish up to table in its paper. If the butter or some of it has run out into the tin, pour it into the dish on which you place the paper.

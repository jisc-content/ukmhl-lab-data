i86 PRACTICAL HOME COOKERY. vastly improves the compound both in flavour and appearance. A great deal of the prepared cocoa is simply cocoa and arrowroot mixed, consequently when the bothng water is poured on, the arrowroot causes the cocoa to look thick and nourishing. If you want to make a good cup of chocolate out of cake chocolate, all you have to do is to mix a little arrowroot in the cup with it, and the result will be that the chocolate will appear to be ten times as strong as it would otherwise do. With regard to chicken broth, that fashionable in- vahd’s preparation many years ago, we ought to say a few words, and these few will be unfavourable. There is, comparatively speaking, but httle nourishment in it. In any case, however, should you make any, bear in mind that it is the bones, and not the flesh, that make the broth ; so instead of wasting the whole fowl over the broth, cut off the meat, which can be made into nice rissoles or mince, and use the bones only for the broth. Now minced mutton or chicken is often recom- mended for invalids, as being easily digested ; but pray remember that invahd mince is very different from the ordinary mince of every-day hfe. In the first place, we all know that in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred mince is made from meat that has been cooked before. Now mince so made, though very nice and wholesome for persons and children in ordinary health, yet is by no means so easy of digestion—i,e. the remains of a leg of mutton minced the second day would be less digestible than the cut off the joint on the first day, the warming-up process having naturally a tendency to harden the meat. To make nice mince for an invahd, the meat must be minced raw. It must then be sprinkled with a httle salt, moistened with a httle good broth, and warmed

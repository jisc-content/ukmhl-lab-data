Of course, this is a somewhat strong mixture, and is certainly not altogether suited for children in any quantity. However, by adding more boihng water and more sugar it can soon be made weaker. Of course, the proper vessel into which the bishop should be poured is a punch-bowl. Unfortu- nately, punch-bowls are somewhat rare. If the party is tolerably large, a wash-hand basin makes a very fair substitute. Of course, you would pick a small one, and as ornamental as possible. Now, a tluck basin requires a good deal of warming, so should you adopt my suggestion, recollect to fill the basin with boihng water some time before it is w'anted. In heu of a punch-ladle, the soup-ladle will be found a worthy substitute. I would also remind you of warming the glasses, not only for the sake of keeping the bishop hot, but to avoid breakages. In cold weather, especially

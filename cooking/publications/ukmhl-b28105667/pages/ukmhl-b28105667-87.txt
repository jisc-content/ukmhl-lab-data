83 SPRING DISHES. then pour it through the strainer over the meat. When the party at dinner is large, and yet the joint put on the table, it is a very good plan to pour only half the gravy over at first, and to send up the rest hot about ten minutes aftenvards, when it can be poured over in the dining-room. Now, we have said that lamb does not make good gravy ; when, therefore, it is possible, get some thin stock, and use that to pour into the dripping-pan instead of boiling water, only take care that the stock is tasteless—anything like rich gravy would destroy the delicate flavour of the lamb. It should be borne in mind, too, that lamb is one of the few meats that are none the better for keeping ; the quicker it is cooked the nicer it \vill be. In hot weather lamb has an unamiable property of getting high quicker than other meat, especially the shoulder. The reason of this is probably that it is “ open,” and not close meat, like a silverside of beef. A loin of mutton that has been jointed will get bad quicker than one not jointed. We next come to the general and nicest accom- paniment to roast lamb, and that is, nice fresh young green peas. When we say fresh, we mean lately gathered. Peas that have been picked some time are very inferior in flavour to those recently picked. Shell the peas, throwing them into cold water just like potatoes after being peeled. Next get a large saucepan of boiling water, into which has been placed a table- spoonful of salt, and a very little moist sugar—about a salt-spoon is sufficient. Strain the peas, throw them in the boiling water gradually, in order not to take the water off the boil for too long. The next point to be considered is, why do some people always have peas looking a bright green, and others send them up with a bad colour ? The secret

102 PRACTICAL HOME COOKERY. “ never will believe in oil.” We will suppose some properly boiled asparagus has been left from dinner. All that is necessary is to dip the eatable parts or tops in the following sauce. Place the asparagus on a dish, and if any remains over from the sauce pour it on the tops ; the sauce being made as follows :—Melt, but do not heat too much, a little butter—say an ounce—and pour it on to a plate ; mix in with a fork a good tea- spoonful of made mustard, a little pepper and salt, and nearly a dessert-spoonful of English vinegar ; stir it all up quickly, and dip in the ends of the asparagus as directed.

The way in which it is compounded is ex- tremely simple. The ” suspicion of onion ”—which can be brought about as before, by simply rubbing the bowl, or if a rather strong flavour of onion is not ob- jected to, by chopping up a small piece of onion finely and adding to the salad—is one requisite ; then slice the potatoes, place them in the bowl, add a little chopped parsley, and if liked, as before, tarragon, and dress the salad exactly as the lettuce was directed to be dressed, adding a little more or less vinegar, according to taste. We must not, in enumerating the various rarer kinds of salads, omit to mention the ordinary English salad and its dressing. The ordinary English salad is a mixture of lettuce, mustard and cress, beetroot,

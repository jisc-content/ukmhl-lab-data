FOOD FOR INVALIDS. 187 slowly with the greatest care, as, should the broth boil for one second, the mince will be rendered tough and indigestible. It is obvious that mince made this way differs enormously from the ordinary mince. A very few minutes is sufficient, if the meat has been minced fine, to cook itâ€”in fact, as soon as it is hot it is done. IMince made in this manner is exceedingly nutritious, and it will often be found that weak digestions can take this when they can take nothing else. Our two next preparations will be barley-water and toast-and-water. Two very simple things, it will probably be thought, and very unnecessary to describe. I wiU describe them, however, first as they generally are, and next as they ought to be. How very often do you find the barley-water dirty ! For instance, when you drink it out of a tumbler, you come to some black-looking stuff at the bottom. Again, how often do you find the toast-and-water thick, instead of bright! and far less appetising is it when it is so. Now both these defects arise from thoughtlessness or want of care. First, then, barley-water. Take a couple of ounces of pearl barley and wash it thoroughly, and then place it in some boihng water, and boil it for about ten min- utes. This has the effect of dissolving the outside of the barley. Strain it off, and put it into a couple of quarts of fresh boihng water, and let it boil gently till it has nearly half boiled away.

Patients, especially feverish ones, want some- thing to drink. By adding water to it, it can, of course, be made as thin as wished. Barley-water should be kept in a jug, with a spoon in it, and stirred up each time before it is poured out, and only the quantity

222 LITTLE DINNERS. Sweet Macaroni. Boil two ounces of best macaroni in half a pint of water with an ounce of butter. When it is done, and has absorbed all moisture, put to it three tablespoonfuls of milk or cream, two ounces of powdered lump-sugar, and a little flavouring. Stir over the fire until it becomes quite thick, taking care not to break the macaroni. Serve either with or without stewed fruit. Parsonage Puddings. Three eggs, a quarter of a pound of pounded loaf- sugar, a quarter of a pound of butter, a quarter of a pound of fine flour. Beat the butter and sugar together until it froths, mix in the eggs, then the flour, and beat all well together, add a little grated lemon or flavouring, butter small cups or tins, and bake twenty minutes in a quick oven. Serve with wine sauce in a boat. Mix a tablespoonful of corn-flour with a little cold water; then stir it into a quarter of a pint of sherry wine, made boiling hot, sweeten, and stir over the fire until it thickens. These puddings are good made with half the quantity of butter named above.

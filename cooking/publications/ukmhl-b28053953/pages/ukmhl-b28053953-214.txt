LITTLE DINNERS. 192 Stewed Vegetable Marrow. Cut the marrow into quarters, peel and take out all the seeds, put it into a stewpan with an ounce of butter, and a pinch of pepper and salt, let it cook until done in its own juices. Then mix a little flour with it to thicken slightly, let it boil up and serve. A few spring onions or an onion sliced are very nice cooked with the marrow. Vegetable Marrow Stuffed. Cut off the ends of a marrow, and with a scoop or the top of a spoon remove all the seeds from the middle, which fill up with any forcemeat or cold meat minced. If there is nothing else convenient, equal quantities of bread- crumbs and cold bacon, with a little chopped parsley and. shalot, seasoned with pepper and salt, will be found very good. Having put the stuffing into the marrow, make a stiff paste of flour and water, and close the ends up with it. Put the marrow into any deep dish with a little butter or other fat, cover it close, set it in a good oven, and bake two hours, or until perfectly tender. When done, remove the paste from the ends, and send the marrow to table with its own gravy.

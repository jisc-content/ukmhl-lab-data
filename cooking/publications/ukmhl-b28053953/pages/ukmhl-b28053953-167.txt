FISH. H5 tablespoonfuls of the liquor (at boiling point) in which the roe was cooked; add half an ounce of butter, a tea- spoonful of essence of anchovy and a pinch of cayenne pepper, stir briskly over the fire until thick, mix the roe with it so as thoroughly to coat it; sprinkle a layer of finely sifted bread-crumbs on a well-buttered tin dish ; then put on the roe, spread evenly, and finish by covering to the thickness of a quarter of an inch with bread-crumbs lightly seasoned with pepper and salt; spread a little dis- solved butter over the crumbs, and bake in a quick oven for twenty minutes. When done, if not nicely browned, finish with the salamander. Pound cold fish in a mortar, season it with pepper and salt, and add a little essence of anchovy. Flour your hands and roll the fish into small balls, dip them in a beaten egg, then in finely sifted bread-crumbs, repeat the process of egg and crumbing, put the balls into the wire basket, and immerse in a stewpan of boiling fat; shake gently until brown. Turn the balls on to paper for a minute to absorb the grease and serve with fried parsley. Fish Balls.

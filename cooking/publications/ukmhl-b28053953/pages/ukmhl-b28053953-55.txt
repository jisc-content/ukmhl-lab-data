FEBRUARY. 33 Sauce Robert. Fry the veal bones and trimmings with an equal quan- tity of bacon bones until a nice brown, then slice three large onions and fry them in a little butter a good golden colour, put all together into a stewpan with a pint of water, and let it boil until reduced to a quarter of a pint. Having removed the grease, let the gravy boil up, stir in a dessertspoonful of flour mixed in a little cold water or stock, then add an ounce of butter, stirring until melted, and finish with a good pinch of mustard mixed in a dessert- spoonful of Prince Alfredâ€™s sauce (page 254), or other sauce of the same kind. Pour round the cutlets and serve Cauliflower au gratin. Wash a fine head of cauliflower. If placed in a pan of lukewarm water, with the flower downwards, any insect in it will get into the water. The usual method of adding salt to the water is not good, as it frequently causes the insects to die in the vegetable. Take away all the green and divide the cauliflower into neat branches ; boil these in salt and water until tender. Drain them and dip each piece in dissolved butter, and afterwards in finely sifted raspings mixed with a little pepper and salt. Then arrange them in a tin dish, and put in the oven for five minutes, or until a nice rich brown, and garnish the cutlets with them. D

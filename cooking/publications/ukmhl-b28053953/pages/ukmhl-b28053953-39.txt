17 REMARKS ON COOKERY. cannot afford to pay a price that will insure purity, for it is only under exceptional circumstances that wines of a high class can be bought cheaply. All wines of a Khenish character are suitable for dinner use. Sauterne and Chablis of good quality are not expensive, and good sound claret is within everybodyâ€™s reach. Besides the wines of France and Germany, those of Hungary and Greece are admirably suited for such dinners as are proposed in this book. As a general rule, when Sauterne is served with fish, claret will do well with the other dishes, and a glass of sherry be acceptable with sweets and cheese. Dining the summer claret-cup may be served after a glass of sherry with the fish. Unless the claret is of a rich kind, which is unnecessary, not more than one-third water should be mixed with it, and it is a mistake to make the cup so sweet as to destroy the refreshing sharpness of the grape-juice. With regard to dessert we would say have few dishes and those of the choicest. Do not, unless you can afford to pay extravagant prices, get fruit which is out of season. It rarely has its proper flavour, and it is ostentatious to place before your guests costly things merely as such. In the summer, for instance, a dish of freshly-gathered straw- berries, and fine ripe cherries, with cakes foi a centre, are ample for the dessert of a small dinner. Only in the intermediate seasons should dried fruits, compotes and things of that kind be resorted to. c

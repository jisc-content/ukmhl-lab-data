Macaroni an gratiu. Break two ounces of best Italian macaroni into a pint of highly seasoned stock, let it simmer until very tender. When done, toss it up with a small piece of butter, and add pepper and salt to taste ; put on a dish. Sift over it some fried bread-crumbs and serve. If the macaroni is kept well covered with the stock, it will take about an horn to cook, but it should be tried from time to time, and never allowed to get pulpy. Macaroni with Bacon. Boil two ounces of streaked bacon, cut into dice, or chop it, and add it to macaroni prepared as above. Macaroni with Onions. Prepare macaroni as for au gratin. Fry two or three onions a delicate brown, boil them in gravy until tender, and mix with the macaroni. The onions may be plain boiled if preferred.

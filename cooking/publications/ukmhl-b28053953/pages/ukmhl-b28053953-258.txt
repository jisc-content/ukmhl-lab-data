236 LITTLE DINNERS. To Boil Rice. Pat half a pound of rice'into two quarts of boiling water with a pinch of salt, or more if to eat with savoury dishes. Let it boil fast for twenty minutes. Strain into a colander or sieve, pour over it a cup of cold water, let the saucepan stand a minute on the range to dry, put back the rice into it, let it stand near the fire for five minutes, shaking occasionally. By this method the grains keep separate, and a pudding-like appearance is avoided. Rice thus cooked may be afterwards baked or boiled in milk, and used for most of the dishes here given. Boiled Flour. This is more delicate for all purposes than baked flour, and is cheap and easily prepared. It answers for thicken- ing soups, gravies, and for making delicate white sauces. It is invaluable for children and invalids. Take a pudding-basin, and press into it, with a spoon, as much of the best white flour as you can. It must be pressed into the basin with the back of the spoon, or with tbe knuckles, until it forms a hard compact mass. When it is not possible to get more into the basin, tie it over with a cloth, and let it boil for twelve hours. When taken up, remove the cloth, and allow the flour to stand in the basin until the nest day. Take off the skin from the top, â€˜ grate or roll the mass until smooth, pass it through a fiue strainer, and put away in covered jars for use.

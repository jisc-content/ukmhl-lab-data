252 LITTLE DINNERS. Pound the raisins, chilies, shalots, and garlic separately. Break up the tomatoes, and mis the whole together; put into ajar, and add two quarts of vinegar. Place the jar, covered over, on the stove, and let the pickle remain a month at a moderate heat, stirring it every day. Strain off, and bottle the liquor for use with any fish, cold meat, &c., and for flavouring hashes, mince, &c. Then put the sediment, which is the chutney, and must not he drained too dry, into pickle bottles. After keeping a few months, it will he improved by the addition of a little more vinegar or Chili vinegar. Colouring. Take one pound of raw sugar, put it into an old frying- pan, set it over a slow fire, and stir until it is all dissolved and a deep brown colour. Care must be taken at this point that it does not boil over. Pour in gently a pint and a half of water, stir until mixed, let it boil up, remove from the fire, put into a jug, and when cold, bottle it. A few drops will colour gravy, sauces or liqueurs. Garlic Extract. Peel as many cloves of garlic as will half fill a small bottle, fill it up with spirits of wine, cork closely, shake occasionally, and in a few days the extract will be ready for use. It is, however, improved by keeping.

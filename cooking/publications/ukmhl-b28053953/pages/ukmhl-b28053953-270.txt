Peaches, which from any cause are unfit for the table, make this liqueur very well, but the finer the fruit the more certain the result. Ginger Cordial. Crush half a pound of fine whole ginger in the mortar, or cut it into small pieces. Put it into a bottle with half a pint of unsweetened gin. Let it stand a month, shaking it occasionally. Drain it off, and allow it to settle. Then again pour it from the sediment, and when it has stood a few days, add a sufficient quantity to give the required strength to either brandy or gin. Sweeten with capil- laire, and add a few drops of colouring. Cherry Brandy. Prick sufficient morrella cherries to fill the bottles, which should be wide-mouthed, and then pour in as much brandy as they will contain. Let them stand at least sis months. Then drain off the brandy, and sweeten it with capillaire or cherry syrup, which last makes a splendid liqueur; it will be ready for immediate use. The bottles containing the cherries may be filled up with capillaire, and when it has stood a month, may be drawn off, and a little gin or brandy added.

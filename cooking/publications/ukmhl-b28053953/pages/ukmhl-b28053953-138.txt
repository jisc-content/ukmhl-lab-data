n6 LITTLE DINNERS. ounces of flour will be required besides tlie above quantity for sifting the board, &c. A fine tin gravy-strainer is best for this purpose. Let your flour be thoroughly dry and sifted, but on no account let it go near the fire when you are about to use it. Have the water perfectly cold and clear, and if you use any lard it should be almost as firm as the butter, or it will not roll in well. The yolk of egg and lemon juice materially assist in giving elasticity to the paste, and will allow of it being rolled as thin as a wafer. The proportions given above will make quite eighteen mince-pies in round tins three inches in diameter. Put your sifted flour into a basin, mix in lightly with a silver fork about a quarter of your butter, add your salt (be chary of it), then the water in which you have previously mixed the yolks of the eggs and the lemon juice. When all is mixed into a paste—and here is the great secret—neither too dry nor too wet— should the butter and lard be soft, then the paste requires to be moister than if they are hard—lay it on your board or slab, and having rolled it out to about half an inch thick, lay half your butter in the middle, sift flour thickly, and fold the paste neatly over the butter; sift flour well over the board, give the paste three or four sharp blows with the rolling-pin, and proceed to roll out until the butter seems well mixed. At this point if the pastiy is light it will give out air bubbles. Take away enough of this paste to line the bottom of your patty-pans, and put

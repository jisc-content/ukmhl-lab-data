LITTLE DINNERS. 66 pieces, lay them in a stewpan, meat downwards and com- pactly fitted together. Sprinkle pepper and salt over, lay on them a dozen young onions, as many spring carrots, and six or eight turnips cut in quarters. Cover the pan closely, set it on the range and let it cook slowly in its own juices. The heat must never be sufficient to fry or it will dry up the moisture. Let it remain thus for an hour, then try if the meat is becoming tender ; if so, turn the bones downwards, and again let it simmer for an hour. When the vegetables are tender, take them out and set them aside in a covered vessel on the range so that they will keep warm. When the meat is perfectly tender, but it must not be the least ragged, take it up. Put half a pint of cold water to the gravy, which will cause the fat to rise, take it all off, season nicely with pepper and salt, let. the gravy boil up and thicken with flour. Put the meat back into the gravy and let it simmer for a few minutes. Take the vegetables cooked with the meat and chop them up, put them into a stewpan with a small pat of butter, shake them about until hot, and having added a few peas, cooked separately, put them in little heaps round the dish on which you serve the lamb. Chicken and Onions. Prepare a fine chicken as for boiling, fill up the body with small onions which have been parboiled in milk

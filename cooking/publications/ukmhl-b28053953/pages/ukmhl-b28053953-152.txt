LITTLE DINNERS. 130 Brown Butter Sauce. Put two ounces of butter into a stewpan and stir over the fire until it begins to get brown, then put in a table- spoonful of Tarragon vinegar, one of Prince Alfredâ€™s or similar sauce, twelve chopped capers and a little essence of anchovy. Simmer together for two or three minutes, and serve with salmon cutlets or other grilled fish. White Sauce. Boil two onions in a pint and a half of milk until it is reduced to a pint. Take out the onions ; press them so as to extract all the juice. Stir into the milk whilst boiling two ounces of fine flour mixed in a quarter of a pint of cold milk. Stir over the fire until it simmers and is as thick as rich cream; add salt and cayenne pepper. Put in two ounces of butter, and when melted serve the sauce. Cream in any proportion may be added to this sauce, and improves both its flavour and appearance. If a very rich sauce is desired, it should be made of equal quantities of milk and cream. A little highly concentrated veal or fowl stock may also be used.

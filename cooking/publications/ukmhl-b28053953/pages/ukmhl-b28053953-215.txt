VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 193 Stuffed Tomatoes. Choose the tomatoes of a good round shape, and as free from blemishes as possible, remove the stalks and seeds, then place inside them any good forcemeat, or meat prepared as for rissolettes. Put a little butter in a deep pie-dish, place the tomatoes in it, and cover close with a plate or dish. Bake for an hour, or until done, basting occasionally. Serve very hot. Puree of Haricot Beans. If the beans are left to soak all night in cold water they will be easily shelled, but if this is not convenient boiling water must be poured over them, and after they have stood a few minutes be drained, the skins will then come off easily. Choose the large white sort; half a pint will make a dish sufficient for five or six persons. Put the beans when shelled into enough broth or water to cover them, with an ounce of butter or bacon fat; let them boil until tender, they will probably take three hours. Watch that they do not boil dry; when done, rub them through a sieve. They should be a very thick puree. Taste that it is nicely seasoned, return it to the stewpan with an ounce of butter, stir until hot, and serve either as an accompaniment to other dishes, alone, or with fried bread. 0

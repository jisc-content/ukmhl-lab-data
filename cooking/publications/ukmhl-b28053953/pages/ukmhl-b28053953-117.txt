OCTOBER. 95 flavour and quality of the middle cut of the sirloin. It is best roasted in the V or gas oven, as this joint is apt to be dried up by any other method. Unless your butcher sends out large quantities of meat, it will be as well, to avoid disappointment, to order this cut the day before you require it, especially as it is in great demand for broiling steaks. Ask him, when the rump is cut out to within two or three pounds, to take the remainder off the bone in one piece. All you will then have to do will be to tie the piece of meat up into a neat round shape, lightly pepper, salt and flour it. Hang it up in the V oven before a small fire, baste and turn frequently. It will take about an hour and a quarter. Serve with plain beef gravy in the dish. Tomato Sauce. Boil two sliced onions in just enough water to cover them, and when they are nearly done, cut up half a dozen fine ripe tomatoes and put them into the stewpan with an ounce of butter, a dessertspoonful of salt, and a shake of pepper. If tomatoes are scarce, a sharp apple cut in quarters, and the seeds taken out, may be used with them. Let the tomatoes simmer three-quarters of an hour. Then rub them through a sieve; the puree, if properly managed, will be as thick as good apple sauce. Beturn it to the stewpan with a small piece of butter, and let it get thoroughly hot.

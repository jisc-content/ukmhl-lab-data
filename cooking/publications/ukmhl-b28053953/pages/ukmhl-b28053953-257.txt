PUDDINGS, CREAMS, ETC. Stewed Pears with Rice. Put four large pears cut in halves into a stewpan with a pint of claret, Burgundy, or water, and eight ounces of sugar; simmer them until perfectly tender. Take out the pears and let the syrup boil down to half; flavour it with vanilla. Have ready a teacupful of rice, nicely boiled in milk and sweetened, spread it on a dish, lay the pears on it, pour the syrup over and serve. This is best eaten cold. Apple Cake. Mix half a pound of fine apple sauce, flavoured with lemon, with the whites of three or four eggs, beaten to a strong froth; make it up into a rocky shape, and pour custard round the dish. Stewed Prunes. Wash the fruit in warm water to free it from grit; for every pound allow half a pound of loaf-sugar, or moist if preferred, and one pint of water. Boil the sugar and water together for ten minutes, then put in the fruit and let it boil gently until perfectly tender, so that it breaks if touched with the finger. Drain the syrup from the prunes, and set them aside whilst it is boiled until it becomes thick, when pour it over the prunes, and let them stand until the next day.

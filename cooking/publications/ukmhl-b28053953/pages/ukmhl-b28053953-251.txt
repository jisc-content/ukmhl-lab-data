P UD DINGS, CPE A MS, ETC. 229 Trifle. The art of whipping cream is little understood. Many cooks think they must whip the mass until it becomes like butter, and as sometimes this is not possible, of course they blame the cream. Even from rather poor cream a good whip may be produced, if the following simple direc- tions are attended to :—put the cream into a good sized basin, whisk for half a minute, when a little froth will rise; remove this on to a piece of muslin laid on a sieve, placed over a basin, whip again, and continue lightly skimming the froth from the cream as it rises. When you have enough, set the whip aside for some hours, or until the next day, if convenient. It will then have become solid, and the cream which has drained into the basin can be used to assist in making the custard for the trifle. A little sifted sugar and any flavouring can, if desired, be added to the cream before whipping; but it is not essential to the operation. Put at the bottom of a deep trifle-dish a layer of strawberry and raspberry jam, then one of macaroons, and another of sponge finger biscuits; pour over these sufficient brandy and sherry mixed to soak them, then a custard, made as for strawberry souffle, and lastly, pile the whipped cream on the top as high as you can. * Hundreds and thousands ’ may be scattered over; but are not necessary to the perfection of this ex- cellent old-fashioned dish. A small and less expensive trifle may be made as in the following recipe.

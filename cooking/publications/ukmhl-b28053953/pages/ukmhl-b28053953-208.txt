LITTLE DINNERS. 186 Devilled Fowl. The legs of either roasted or boiled fowls are suitable for this purpose. Score the flesh deeply and coat thickly with the following mixture :â€”Melt an ounce of butter, mix with it a teaspoonful of chutney, a pinch of cayenne, white pepper and salt. Put the legs on the gridiron over a slow fire, taking great care that they do not burn. Cook slowly for a quarter of an hour, turning them very frequently. Take the legs off the gridiron and pour a little dissolved butter over each ; if required to be very hot a little pepper should be shaken over them. Stewed Chicken Giblets. Take three or four sets of chicken giblets. "Wash, ary, flour, and fry them in a little butter. Cut the gizzards into slices, and put with the other giblets into a stewpan with half a dozen onions, fried, a small bundle of sweet herbs, and enough stock or water seasoned with pepper and salt to cover them. Simmer for about an hour or until perfectly done. Take them up, strain the gravy, and free it from fat. Rub the onions through a sieve and mix with a tablespoonful of boiled flour, stir this into the gravy, let it boil up, put in the giblets, let them get hot in it and serve. A few forcemeat balls, if convenient, should be served with this dish. A puree of green peas or dried haricot beans goes well with it.

PRESERVES, EXTRACTS, SYRUPS, ETC. 24f rhubarb; avoid large, coarse growths, and be sure it is perfectly fresh. The later in the season rhubarb jam can be made the better; the second growth having more fibre and less juice than the first makes a stronger preserve. Red Currant Jelly. Take ripe fine fruit; see that it is dry. Express the juice with the hands through a piece of tammy or canvas. Measure it, and boil up in the preserving pan for a quarter of an hom. Then add sugar in the proportion of three- quarters of a pound to every pint of juice. Proceed as for raspberry jam. Skim lightly as required, particularly when the jelly is nearly done, when it should be perfectly bright. If you have any little moulds, the jelly looks prettier than when tinned out of the common jar. Apple Marmalade. Take some good sharp apples fresh from the tiees. Pare, core, cover them with cold water, and boil until tender. Then drain off the juice, and to every pint of it put three-quarters of a pound of sugar. Boil it until it jellies, then return the fruit to it, and boil until the whole will set firm. Put into pots, cover close and keep m a cool place. This is an excellent substitute for apple sauce when apples are scarce. Boil a little water, mix the marmalade with it, warm it up, and serve with the addition of a little lemon j uice. 11

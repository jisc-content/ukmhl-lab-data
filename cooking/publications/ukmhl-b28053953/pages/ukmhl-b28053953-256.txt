LITTLE DINNERS. 234 Apple Fool. Bake good sharp apples; when done, remove the pulp, and rub it through a sieve, sweeten and flavour with lemon ; when cold, add it to a custard made of eggs and milk, or milk or cream sweetened will he very good. Keep the fool quite thick; serve with rusks or sponge finger biscuits. Apples a la Princess. Peel four or five Bibstone pippins, take out the cores with a scoop so as not to injure the shape of the apples, put them into a deep baking-dish with three glasses of sherry wine, half a pint of water, a quarter of a pound of loaf-sugar, and the peel of a small lemon. Cover the baking-dish with a plate, let the apples cook slowly until tender, but without being the least broken. Then put them on the dish in which they are to be served. Boil the syrup down to one-half of the original quantity; let it get cold. Place between the apples a little well boiled rice, every grain being separate, and pour the syrup gently over each apple so that it will run into the rice. Fill the cavity made in the apple by the withdrawal of the core with apricot marmalade or other rich preserve. The apples look very pretty with a glace cherry, and little pieces of angelica cut to represent leaves, placed on the top of each.

Macaroni Soup. This is merely a good gravy soup well flavoured with vegetables and slightly thickened with corn-flour. The chief matter for remark, therefore, is the proper prepara- tion of the macaroni. It is often disliked in soups, and is not so much used as it should be, because it is insipid, and often imparts a flat flavour to the liquid. Nothing is easier than to avoid this, and when properly prepared for soup macaroni is delicious, and is much relished. For a quart of soup break up six ounces of macaroni (best Italian) into a pint of boiling water in which two large onions and a bacon bone or two have simmered for an hour, add an ounce of butter, season highly with pepper and salt. Let the macaroni boil gently for an hour, when it will be very tender without being in the least sticky as ill- prepared macaroni often is. It may be necessary to add a little water from time to time as the macaroni swells. White stock or broth may be substituted if convenient, but care must be taken not to injure the colour of the macaroni. When the soup is ready, put the prepared macaroni into the tureen and pour it over.

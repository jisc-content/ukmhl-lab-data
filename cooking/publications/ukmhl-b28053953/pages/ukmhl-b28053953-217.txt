195 VEGETABLES AND SALADS. Sprinkle pepper and salt over the uppermost or black side, and let the mushrooms cook very gently until they are perfectly tender. Put them into a hot dish and pour their gravy over them. Baked Mushrooms. Prepare the mushrooms as in the foregoing recipe, put a little butter on a plate, lay the mushrooms on it, sprinkle with pepper and salt, cover with another plate, and bake in a moderate oven for half an hour, or until done. The gravy from mushrooms cooked in this manner should be plentiful. Stewed Mushrooms. For this purpose mushrooms should be very fresh, and those of natural growth are to be preferred. Choose the large white buttons, though if it is not an object to keep the sauce a light colour, any size will do, peel or turn them, that is, pare them with a sharp knife. Put two ounces of fresh butter into a stewpan, lay in the mush- rooms, the upper side downwards, sprinkle pepper and salt over, let them simmer very gently for a quarter of an hour, longer if they are large and thick. When tender, put to them sufficient white sauce to cover them, and let them simmer together for half an hour. Serve as sauce or to be eaten with fried bread.

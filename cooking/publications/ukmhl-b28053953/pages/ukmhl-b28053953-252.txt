LITTLE DINNERS. 230 Tipsy Dish. Put a layer of raspberry jam at the bottom of a glass dish, lay on sponge cakes and ratifias to cover it. Pour over sufficient sherry wine and brandy to soak them, and then custard to fill up the dish. Whip the whites of the eggs, lift from the custard with a little finely sifted sugar and lemon or vanilla flavouring, and pile them on the top oi the custard. The small sugar-plums called ‘ hundreds and thousands ’ strewn over make the dish look pretty. Lemon Jelly. Use Nelson’s patent gelatine. Soak an ounce in half a pint of cold water for an hour, stir it into a pint and a half of boiling water, raisin or cowslip wine. Cut the peel of a lemon thinly and put it into the jelly with the strained juice of three, and a quarter of a pound of loaf-sugar, or according to taste. Let this boil for five minutes; take it off the fire, allow it to stand till cool, stir in briskly the whites and shells of two eggs well beaten, and again allow the jelly to boil without stirring ; then take it off the fire, and when it has stood two minutes strain through a close flannel bag. Now stir into the jelly half a pint of sherry mixed, if approved, with a little brandy. It is best not to boil the wine, as it loses thereby both spirit and flavour. Care must be taken to keep the jelly near the fire whilst passing through the bag.

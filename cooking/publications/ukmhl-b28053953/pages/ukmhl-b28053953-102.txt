When done, remove the crust, sprinkle a little pepper and salt over the meat, then froth up with a little butter, and brown quickly, either with a salamander or before the fire.

Serve also a sauce made of a little currant-jelly dissolved in some of the gravy, a lump of sugar, a few drops of chili vinegar, and a glass of port wine. Have currant-jelly also on the table.

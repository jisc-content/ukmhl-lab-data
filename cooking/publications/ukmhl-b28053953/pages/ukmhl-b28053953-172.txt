150 LITTLE DINNERS. Fillet Steaks with Mushrooms. Prepare the fillets as in the foregoing recipe, broil ohem, and place neatly on a dish with chopped mushrooms in the centre. Peel and trim the mushrooms, put them into a stewpan with a little butter, and pepper and salt, let them stew gently until perfectly tender ; they will take from ten to twenty minutes, according to size. When done, drain them from the liquor and chop them; this done, put them back, warm up in it and place on the dish with the fillets. Fillets of Steak with Fried Bread. For this purpose the fillet must be very neatly trimmed, and all the slices be very nearly of a size. Cut them about half an inch thick, and then prepare as many pieces of bread as you have fillets, and of the same size and shape. Cook the fillets as directed for fillets with potato chips, and fry the bread nicely in the wire basket (see fried bread). Arrange them on the dish for serving; first a fillet, then a slice of fried bread, and so on until all are used. In the centre of the dish put a little rich thick gravy and serve immediately.

62 LITTLE DINNERS. Orange Fritters. Two hours before required for use, make a batter as follows:â€”Mix two large tablespoonfuls of fine flour with four of water, a tablespoonful of dissolved butter or oil, the yolk of one egg and a small pinch of salt. When ready for use, beat the white of the egg to a strong froth and mix lightly with the batter. It should be thick enough to coat the spoon well, but if too much flour is used the fritters will be spoiled. Divide the oranges in half, remove the peel, pith and seeds, sprinkle sugar over the pieces and let them remain for an hour, when drain and dip each separately in the batter. Have ready some good frying fat, and take care it boils when you drop in each fritter. Two or three minutes will suffice to cook them. Sift sugar over the fritters and serve imme- diately.

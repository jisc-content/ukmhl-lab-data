53 APRIL. Castle Cream. Make half a pint of milk or cream into custard, with the yolks of two or three eggs, in the same manner as for strawberry souffle, sweeten and flavour with brandy or curapoa and a little lemon peel. Soak a quarter of an ounce of gelatine in three tablespoonfuls of milk, let it boil until dissolved in the vessel in which the custard was made, and when both are nearly cold mix well together. Have ready two ounces of dried glace cherries and any other nice dried fruit you may have cut small, an ounce of ratifias and a sponge cake cut into squares, all soaked in brandy or curapoa, the fruit for an hour or two, the cakes for a few minutes. Arrange some of the cherries at the bottom of a pretty mould, then put a little custard, then cakes, cherries, &c., and so repeat until the mould is full. This must be made the day before it is wanted. It is a de- licious sweet, and very easily turned out of the mould. When on its dish, pour round the base a little fruit- syrup ; cherry or raspberry is best, but if you have none, dissolve a little currant-jelly in an equal quantity of water. This cream te very delicious flavoured with vanilla, but when used the fruit and cakes must be soaked in cherry-brandy or brandy, not curapoa.

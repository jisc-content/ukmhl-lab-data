LITTLE DINNERS. <94 Stewed Celery, Great care must be taken in washing the celery. Cut off the tops, take away the outside leaves, and neatly trim the roots. Boil the sticks in salt and water for five minutes, then again carefully wash them. Put them into a stewpan with sufficient stock to cover them, an onion, a carrot, a bunch of sweet herbs, and pepper and salt. Boil very gently for two hours, or until per- fectly tender. When done, drain and lay the celery in a dish. Strain and boil down the liquor in which they were stewed to a small quantity, add to it if necessary a drop or two of colouring, a small piece of glaze, and thicken with butter and flour. Pour over the celery ana serve. Fried Parsley. Wash, pick, and dry the parsley by shaking it in a cloth. Put into the wire basket, and fry for half a minute in hoiliug lard. Drain and throw it on to paper to absorb the grease, and use for garnishes. Fried Mushrooms. The large mushrooms are best for this purpose. Take off the skin and trim the stalks, lay them on the upper side in a frying-pan, with a little dissolved butter or lard.

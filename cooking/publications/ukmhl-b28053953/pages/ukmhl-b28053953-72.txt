Then remove it on to the dish on which it is to go to table, and pour over the remainder of the gravy. Garnish with spinach a la reine. Spinach a la reine. Wash and pick three or four pounds of spinach, taking care that it is perfectly free from grit, and that no stalks are left on the leaves. Drain the spinach and put into a large saucepan, with a teaspoonful of salt, no water, set it over the fire, cover with the lid until the juices begin to draw, then remove it and stir the spinach occasionally to prevent its burning. Let it boil until perfectly tender, drain it in a sieve until dry. Then place in a stewpan with an ounce of butter, a tablespoonful of cream, or if more convenient rich thick gravy may be substituted, stir until the vegetable becomes dry, make any nice little mould, not larger than an egg-cup, very hot, and press some of the spinach into it; turn it out, and repeat the process until you have enough cakes to garnish your dish. Or the spinach may he put into a vegetable presser, and when tinned out cut into neat shapes.

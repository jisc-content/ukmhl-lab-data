LITTLE DINNERS. 2l6 oven. A fork is so generally used for beating- eggs that it may seem strange to say it is not the most appropriate instrument. A knife or a thin strip of wood is better. The whisk for a small quantity of egg is generally avoided, but a wire spoon, which may be purchased for a few pence of any ironmonger, is admirably adapted for beating eggs. Sweet Omelet. Put two ounces of butter into an untinned iron frying- pan, and as soon as it reaches boiling point, pour in four eggs, beaten for three minutes with a tablespoonful of milk or cream, and a teaspoonful of finely sifted sugar. Stir the eggs and butter quickly together until the eggs begin to set, and then shake until the under-side becomes a delicate golden colour. Lay on half the omelet a spoonful of apricot, raspberry or strawberry jam, fold over the other half, turn it on to its dish, sift a little sugar over, and serve in- stantly. The whole operation of cooking an omelet should not exceed four minutes, and although apparently so simple, rapidity and some degree of tact are necessary to ensure success. It is desirable that a pan should be kept ex- pressly for frving omelets and used for nothing else. When done with, it should be wiped dry, but not washed. For an omelet of four eggs it should not be more than six inches in diameter.

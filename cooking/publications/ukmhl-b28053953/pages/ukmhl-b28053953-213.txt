Potatoes au gratin. Peel some potatoes and cut into strips about half au inch thick. Wash and dry them in a cloth, dip them in egg and finely sifted bread-crumbs. Put them into a wire basket and fry until done in plenty of boiling fat. Sprinkle with chopped parsley, pepper and salt, immerse in the fat for about a second, put them on paper to absorb the grease, and serve very hot. Potatoes a la Maitre d’Hotel. Very small new potatoes may with advantage be used up in this way. Take care they are nicely scraped, and are as white as possible. They must first be boiled in the usual manner with plenty of salt, and be served up with the following sauce to cover them:—Mix a tablespoonful of flour in one of cold water, and then put into a quarter of a pint of boiling water; stir over the fire until properly thickened, put in a large tea- spoonful of finely chopped parsley, two ounces of butter, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Continue stirring until the butter is dissolved, but do not allow the sauce to boil; finally put in a squeeze of lemon juice. Large potatoes may be dressed in this manner, but must be cut in thin slices after being boiled.

142 LITTLE DINNERS. Potato case with Lobster. Boil and mash very smooth and dry, enough potatoes for your case, add to a pound of them the yolks of two eggs, work over the fire in a stewpan until dry, then mould in the same manner as a rice case, brush it over with yolk of egg, and bake until nicely coloured. With a quarter of a pint of white sauce mix half a teaspoonful of Burgessâ€™s Essence of Anchovy and one of lemon juice, stir into it half a tin of preserved lobster, and let it stand by the side of the fire to get hot, but do not let it boil. Fresh lobster can be used, of course, but is more expensive. When ready, pour the lobster with its sauce, which should be thick, into the case and serve. Scolloped Oysters. Allow four oysters to each person. Take off their beards and the hard white portion, and simmer these with two tablespoonfuls of water, two or three minutes; not longer, or the liquor will be bitter. Butter a nice bright tin tart-dish, put on a thick layer of finely sifted crumbs, then the oysters; sprinkle salt and white pepper lightly over and pour on the liquor. Mix a little pepper and salt with the remaining bread-crumbs, and thoroughly cover up the oysters. Put bits of butter thickly on the top, and bake in a good oven twenty minutes. If

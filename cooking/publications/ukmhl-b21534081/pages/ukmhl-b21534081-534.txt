Some cooks boil the cinnamon and the grated rind of a lemon with all the other in- gredients, but the cream has then to be pressed through a sieve after it is made, a process wdiich it is always desirable to* avoid. It may be flavoured with vanilla and maraschino, or with orange-blossoms at pleasure ; but is excellent made as above.

The old-fashioned mode of preparing this dish was to soak a fight sponge or Savoy cake in as much good French brandy as it could absorb ; then, to stick it full of blanched almonds cut into whole-length spikes, and to pour a rich cold boiled custard round it. It is more usual now to pour white wine over the cake, or a mixture of wine and brandy; with this the juice of half a lemon is sometimes mixed Chantilly Basket. FILLED WITH WHIPPED CREAM AND FRESH STRAWBERRIES, Take a mould of any sort that will serve to form the basket on, yust dip the edge of some macaroons into melted barley sugar, and fasten them together with it; take it out of the mould, keep it in a dry place until wanted, then fill it high with whipped strawberry ^ream which has been drained on a sieve from the preceding day and stick very fine ripe strawberries over it. It should not be filled until ust before it is served.

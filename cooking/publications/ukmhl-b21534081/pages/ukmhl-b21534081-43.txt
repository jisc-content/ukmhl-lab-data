CAR vim xliii No. 2.5. A HARE. A hare should be placed with its head to the left of the carver, therefore the engraving No. 25 shows it turned m the wrong direc- tion. It is so very great an improvement to take out the back-bone before a hare is roasted, that we would recommend it to be done wherever it can be so without difficulty: it may then be carved in the line a b quite through, or only partially so at choice. When the bone remains in, slices may be taken down the whole length of the back from c c to d d; the legs, which, next to the back, are con- sidered the best eating, may then be taken off in the direction e fy and the flesh divided from or served upon them, after the small bones have been parted from the thighs. The shoulders, which are not generally much esteemed, though sometimes liked by sportsmen, may next be taken off by passing the knife at the letters g h between the joint and the body. When a hare is young, the back is some- times divided at the joints into three or four parts, after being freed from the ribs and under-skin. No. 27. A FRICANDEAU OF VEAL. This is usually stewed, or rather braised sufficiently tender to be divided with a spoon, and requires no carving; but the fat (or under- part of the fillet) attached to it, marked a a a, which is sometimes, but not invariably served with it now, may be carved in even slices. The larding differs somewhat from that which we have described, but ffie mode shown here allows the fricandeau to be glazed with more facility The engraving of the entree No. 26 is intended merely to show the manner of dishing the cutlets. They may be of mutton, lamb, veal, or pork; and the centre may be filled with the sauce or stewed vegetable appropriate to either; as soubise, puree of asparagus, of mushrooms, or of tomatas; or green peas d la Frangaise, stewed cucumbers, or aught else that is suited to the kind of meat which is ferved.

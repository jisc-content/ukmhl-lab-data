167 CHAP. IX.] BOILING, ROASTING, ETC, CHAPTER EC Â§ffiirag, tit. A thorough practical knowledge of the processes described in the present chapter will form a really good cook far sooner and more completely than any array of mere receipts can do, however minutely they may be explained; they should, therefore, be well studied and comprehended, before any attempt is made to compoun d difficult dishes; and the principles of roasting, boiling, stewing, and baking, at least, ought to be clearly understood by every servant who under- takes the duties of what is called plain cookery, which is, in fact, of more importance than any other, because it is in almost universal request in this country for families of moderate fortune; and any person who excels in it will easily become expert in what are consi- dered the higher branches of the art.

TO BOIL MEAT. Boiling, in the usual English manner, is the least advantageous of all modes of cooking meat, because a large portion of the nourishment

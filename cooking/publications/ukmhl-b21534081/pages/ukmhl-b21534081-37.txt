There is no difference between the mode of carving this and a round of beef; but the brown outside slice of the veal is much liked by many eaters, and a portion of it should be served to them when it is known to be so. The forcemeat must be reached by cutting deeply into the flap, and a slice of it served always with the veal. A LOIN OF VEAL. This may be carved at choice quite across through the thick part of the flesh, or in slices taken in the direction of the bones. A slice of the kidney, and of the fat which surrounds it, should accompany the veal. No. 11. A BREAST OF VEAL. The brisket or gristles* of this joint must first be entirely separated from the rib-bones by pressing the knife quite through it in the line Detween a and b ; this part may then be divided as shown by the letters c c c d d d, and the long bones or ribs may easily be separated in the direction e f.

When freed from the bone attached to them, they may be dressed in a variety of ways, and are extremely good: but they require from four to six hours’ stewing to render them perfectly tender, even when each tendon is divided into three or four slices. The upper flesh must be laid back from the tendons before they are taken from the breast, not left ad- hering to them. They are very good simply stewed in white gravy, and served with green peas, d la Frangaise, in the centre. The breast entirely boned, forced, and rolled, makes a handsome dish, either roasted or stewed.

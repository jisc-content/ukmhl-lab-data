Small fondus in paper cases are often served thus; and various other prepara- tions, which require to be eaten very hot. Blanquelte—a kind of fricassee. Boudin—a somewhat expensive dish, formed of the French force- meat called quenelles, com- posed either of game, poultry, butcher’s meat, or fish, moulded frequently into the form of a rouleau, and gently poached until it is firm ; then some- times broiled or fried, but as frequently served plain. Bouilli — boiled beef, or other meat, beef being more generally understood by the term. Bouillie—a sort of hasty pudding. Bouillon—broth.

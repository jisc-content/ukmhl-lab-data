MODERN COOKERY. 8G0 [chap, xviii. about an ounce of butter has been dissolved, and just begins to simmer; strew in a slight seasoning of salt, mace, and cayenne, and stew the chicken very softly indeed for about ten minutes, taking every precaution against its browning : turn it, into a dish with the butter, and its own gravy, and let it become cold. Mince it with a sharp knife; heat it, without allowing it to boil, in a little good white sauce (which may be made of some of the bones of the fowl), and fill ready-baked patty-crusts, or small vol-au-vents with it, just before they are sent to table; or stew the flesh only just sufficiently to render it firm, mix it after it is minced and seasoned with a spoon- ful or two of strong gravy, fill the patties, and hake them from fifteen to eighteen minutes. It is a great improvement to stew and mince a few mushrooms with the chicken. The breasts of cold turkeys, fowls, partridges, or pheasants, or the white part of cold veal, minced, heated in a bechamel sauce, will serve at once for patties: they may also be made of colil game, heated in an Espagnole, or in a good brown gravy.

Moisten these ingredients with a spoonful of thick cream, or bechamel maigre (see page 109), or with a dessert- spoonful of clarified butter ; line the patty-moulds, fill them with the mixture, cover, and bake them from twelve to fifteen minutes in a moderate oven. They are excellent made with the cream-crust of page 347. Yolks hard-boiled eggs, G ; truffles, 2 large; seasoning of salt, mace, nutmeg, and cayenne; cream, or bechamel maigre, 1 table- spoonful, or clarified butter, 1 dessertspoonful : baked moderate oven, 12 to 15 minutes. Obs.â€”A spoonful or two of jellied stock or gravy, or of good white sauce, converts these into admirable patties: the same ingre- dients make also very superior rolls or cannelons. For Patties a la Cardinale, small mushroom-buttons stewed as for partridges, Chapter XIII., before they are minced, must be substituted for truffles ; and the butter in which they are simmered should be added with them to the eggs EXCELLENT MEAT ROLLS.

Take the stalks from the fruit which should he of a highly flavoured sort, quite ripe, fresh from the beds, and gathered in dry weather; weigh and put it into large glass jars, or wide-necked bottles, and to each pound pour about a pint and a half of fine pale white wine vinegar, which will answer the purpose better than the entirely co- lourless kind sold under the name of distilled vinegar, but which is often, we believe, merely pyroligneous acid greatly diluted.* Tic a thick paper over them, and let the strawberries remain from three to four days; then pour off the vinegar and empty them into a jelly- bag, or suspend them in a cloth, that all the liquid may drop from them without pressure ; replace them with an equal weight of fresh fruit, pour the vinegar upon it, and three days afterwards repeat the same process, diminishing a little the proportion of strawberries, of which the flavour ought ultimately to overpower that of the vinegar. * For these fine acidulated fruit-syrups vinegar of the purest quality, hut onlyf ef medium strength, is required.

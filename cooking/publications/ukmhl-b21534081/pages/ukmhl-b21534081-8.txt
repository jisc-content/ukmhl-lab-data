PREFACE*. Vlll our own defects; and tlie great frugality, combined with almost universal culinary skill, or culinary knowledge, at tlie least—which prevails amongst many of them—is well worthy of our imitation. Suggestions of this nature are not, how- ever, sufficient for our purpose. Something definite, practical, and easy of application, must open the way to our general improvement. Efforts in the right direction are already being made, I am told, by the establishment of well-conducted schools for the early and efficient training of our female domestic servants. These will materially assist our progress; and if experienced cooks will put aside tlie jealous spirit of exclusiveness by which they are too often actuated, and will impart freely the knowledge they have acquired, they alsc may be infinitely helpful to us, and have a claim upon our gratitude which ought to afford them purer satisfaction than the sole possession of any secrets—genuine or imaginary— connected with their craft. The limits of a slight j reface do not permit me to pursue this or any other topic at much length, and I must in conse- quence leave my deficiencies to be supplied by some of the thoughtful, and, in every way, more competent writers, who, happily for us, abound at the present day; and make here my adieu to the reader.

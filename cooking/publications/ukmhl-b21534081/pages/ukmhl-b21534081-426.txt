8G6 [chap, xvnt MODERH COOKERY, three additional turns or rollings to prevent its losing its form in the oven, Christmas Tourte a la Chatelaine.â€”Make the case for this tourte as for the preceding one, and put sufficient mince-meat to fill it hand- somely into a jar, cover it very securely with paste, or with two or three folds of thick paper, and hake it gently for half an hour or longer, should the currants, raisins, &c., not he fully tender. Take out the inside of the tourte, heap the hot mince-meat in it, pour a little fresh brandy over; just touch it with a strip of lighted writing- paper at the door of the dining-room, and serve it in a blaze; or if better liked so, serve it very hot without the brandy, and with Devonshire cream as an accompaniment.* GENOISES A LA HEINE, OR HER MAJESTY^ PASTRY. Make some nouilles (see page 5), with the yolks of four fresh eggs, and when they are all cut as directed there, drop them lightly into a pint and a half of boiling cream (new milk will answer quite as well, or a portion of each may be used), in which six ounces of fresh butter have been dissolved. When these have boiled quickly for a minute or two, during which time they must be stirred to pre- vent their gathering into lumps, add a small pinch of salt, and six ounces of sugar on which the rinds of two lemons have been rasped; place the saucepan over a clear and very gentle fire, and when the mixture has simmered from thirty to forty minutes take it off, stir briskly in the yolks of six eggs, and pour it out upon a delicately clean baking-tin which has been slightly rubbed in every part with butter; leVel the nouilles with a knife to something, less than a quarter of an inch of thickness, and let them, be very evenly spread; put them into a moderate oven, and bake them of a fine equal brown: should any air-bladders appear, pierce them with the point of a knife. On taking the paste from the oven, divide it into two equal parts; turn one of these, the under-side uppermost, on to a clean tin or a large dish, and spread quickly over it ajar of fine apricot-jam, place the other half upon it, the brown side outwards, and leave the paste to become cold ; then stamp it out with a round or diamond-shaped cutter, and arrange the genoises tastefully in a dish. This pastry will be found delicious the day it is baked, but its excellence is destroyed by keeping Peach, green-gage, or magnum bonum jam, will serve for it quite as well as apricot. We strongly recommend to our readers this preparation, baked in patty-pans, and served hot; or the whole quantity made into a pudding. From the smaller ones a little may be taken out with a teaspoon, and replaced with some preserve just before they are sent to table; or they may thus be eaten cold. ^ Sufficient of cream for this purpose can easily be prepared from good milk.

MODERN COOKERY. [chap. xiy. 280 The ducks may be served with a small portion only of their sauce, and dished in a circle, with green peas a la Francaise heaped high in the centre : the lemon-rind and port wine should then be altogether omitted, and a small bunch of green onions and parsley, with two or three young carrots, may be stewed down with the birds, or three or four minced eschalots, delicately fried in butter, may be used to flavour the gravy. The turnips au beurre, prepared by the receipt of Chapter XVII., ma}^ be substituted for the peas ; and a well made Espagnole may take the place of beef stock, when a dish of high savour is wished for. A duck is often stewed without being divided into joints. It should then be firmly trussed, half roasted at a quick fire, and laid into the stewpan as it is taken from the spit; or well browned in some French thickening, then half covered with boiling gravy, and turned when partially done: from an hour to an hour and a quarter will stew it well. TO ROAST PIGEONS. [In season from March to Michaelmas, and whenever they can be had young.l These, as we have already said, should be dressed while they are very fresh. If extremely young they will be ready in twelve hours for the spit, otherwise, in twenty-four. Take off the heads and necks, and cut off the toes at the first joint draw them carefully, and pour plenty of water through them : wipe them dry, and put into each bird a small bit of butter lightly dipped into a little cayenne (for- merly it was rolled in minced parsley, but this is no longer the fashionable mode of preparing them). Truss the wings over Pigeons for roasting. the backs, and roast them at a brisk fire, keeping them well and constantly basted with butter. Serve them with brown gravy, and a tureen of parsley and butter. For the second course, dish them upon young water-cresses, as directed for roast fowl aux cressons, page 272. About twenty minutes will roast them. 18 to 20 minutes ; five minutes longer, if large ; rather less, if very young. bOILED PIGEONS. Truss them like boiled fowls, drop them into plenty of boiling water, throw in a little salt, and in fifteen minutes lift them out, pour parsley and butter over, and send a tureen of it to table with them.

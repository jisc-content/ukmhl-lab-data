Mix in by degrees three-quarters of a pound of dried and sifted flour of the best quaâ€™ity; then pour gently from the sediment a pound of butter which has been just melted, Lut not allowed to become hot, and beat it very gradually, but very thoroughly, into the cake, letting one portion entirely disappear before another is thrown in; add the rasped or finely-grated rinds of two sound fresh lemons, fill a thickly-buttered mould rather more than half full with the mixture, and bake the cake from an hour and a half to ;wo hours in a well-heated oven.

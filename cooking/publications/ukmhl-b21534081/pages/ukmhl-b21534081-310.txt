BAKED PIG. Prepare the pig exactly as for roasting; truss, and place it in the dish in which rt is to be sent to the oven, and anoint it thickly in every part with white of egg which has been slightly beaten ; it will require no basting, nor further attention of any kind, and will be well crisped by this process. PIG A LA TARTARE When the shoulders of a cold roast pig are left entire, take them off with care, remove the skin, trim them into good form, dip them into clarified butter or very pure salad oil, then into fine crumbs highly seasoned with cayenne and mixed with about a half-teaspoonful of salt. Broil them over a clear brisk fire, and send them quickly to table, as soon as they are heated through and equally browned, with tomata sauce, or sauce Robert. Curried crumbs and a currie-sauce will give an excellent variety of this dish ; and savoury herbs with two or three eschalots chopped small together, and mixed with the bread-crumbs, and brown eschalot sauce to accompany the broil, will likewise be an acceptable one to many tastes.

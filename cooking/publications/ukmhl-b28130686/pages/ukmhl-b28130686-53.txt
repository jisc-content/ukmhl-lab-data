49 possible. For instance, the oven should not be used to bake odds and ends of bread for bread crumbs, but the bread should be put in when the oven is being used for something else. Servants are very apt to forget to turn out the gas in the oven ; they shut the door and forget all about it. With a gas cooker time and labour are saved in the cleaning of cooking utensils, which keep bright and clean for a long time. Those who use a gas cooker for the first time may find it wise to remember that care should be taken that the handles of all pots and pans are not placed so as to be over the gas flames. Experience certainly does it‚Äù in this connection. Enamelled pots and pans cannot be recommended for gas cooking. In baking or grilling meat the gas should always be turned full on when the meat is first put to cook, and kept so for a few minutes. This is done to slightly harden the outside of the meat and so retain the juice. This rule applies to cakes, etc. This does not mean that the gas should be lighted just as the cake or meat is ready to be put in the oven, but the oven should be hot. Great care snould be taken that the inside of the oven be kept scrupulously clean. All the gas jets should be attended to, as often the grease from the meat spurts over them, causing an unpleasant smell, and imparting a disagreeable flavour to the article cooked. Ahvays wash off any grease that has been spilt on the stove with a cloth dipped in hot water. Fat should never be allowed to remain in the dripping pan. In short, absolute cleanliness cannot be over-estimated.

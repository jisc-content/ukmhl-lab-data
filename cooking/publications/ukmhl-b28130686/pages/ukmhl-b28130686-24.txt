20 which passes into the blood, being acted on in various ways in the liver and purified in the lungs. Now let us return to the opening organ, the mouth. Here three processes take place : we chew our food, we mix it with saliva, then we swallow it. Saliva consists of 98 per cent, of water, and various Saliva 80^^8> including ptyalin, which is one of the substances called ferments. Saliva acts in two ways: its first and simplest uses are to enable us to taste our food and then to swallow it. Dry food, as we all know, is difficult, and sometimes impossible to swallow. The next function of ptyalin is to convert the starch contained in our foods into dextrin and then into sugar of malt. It does not act on the nitrogenous and fatty portions of our food. Potatoes, bread, rice, &c., contain starch, and are naturally indigestible if improperly chewed up and mixed with saliva. Hence new bread is more likely to disagree than old, as being less easy to chew into small particles. Hence also, as well as for other reasons, toast and crust are easily digested. It need hardly be added that unless our teeth are in sound condition proper mastication of much of our food is impossible. People with bad teeth are notoriously dyspeptic. Having chewed and salivated our food, we force it toward the back of the mouth, when muscles, which act voluntary, set to work, and the future of our food, so far as its progress is concerned, passes beyond our control. The “tube” conveying the food from the mouth to the stomach contracts and expands, contracting behind expanding before the matter swallowed, and so our food is forced down till it reaches the stomach.

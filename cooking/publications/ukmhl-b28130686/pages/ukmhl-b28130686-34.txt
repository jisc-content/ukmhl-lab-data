80 of recovering its healthy tone. Artificial digestion supplies the deficient nutriment, and the stomach, being now duly nourished, assumes its normal con- dition. In short, what the stomach really requires in such cases is rest, which of course it cannot obtain absolutely, from the nature of the functions imposed upon it. But the administration of Lacto- peptine carries out the process of digestion within the stomach, reduces the labours of the stomach, and thereby materially helps forward the recuperative process. The extended use and adoption of LACTOPEP- tine by the Medical Profession shows that its therapeutic value has been thoroughly established in cases of dyspepsia and indigestion, liver and kidney disease, loss of appetite, impoverished blood, general debility, intestinal and wasting diseases, constipation, headache, nausea, vomiting in pregnancy, cholera infantum, chronic diarrhoea, neuralgia arising from indigestion, flatulency, heartburn, and in every description of stomach ailment or disease, where all other known remedies have failed and proved ineffectual. The purpose of the LACTOPEPTINE is to bring about the digestion of food, in a manner perfectly identical with that obtained under the influence of the natural gastric juice, and enable the process of digestion to be completed without straining the power of the stomach. It is also intended to restore the deranged and torpid liver to its normal condition and healthful action ; to remove and prevent con- stipation by securing a natural and regular operation of the bowels, and to relieve those unpleasant symptoms which attend a diseased or morbid condi- tion of the liver, stomach, and bowels.

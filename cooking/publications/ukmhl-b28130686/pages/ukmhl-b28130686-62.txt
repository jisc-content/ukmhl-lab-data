Ingredients :— 1 Cabbage. Potatoes. 1 Turnip. Salt. Take a white cabbage, wash and slice into pieces, removing the stalk. Throw into a saucepan with two quarts of water, a sliced turnip, four or five sliced potatoes, and salt. Cook for an hour. If by this time the soup is not smooth, take a whisk and make so. Serve with fried bread, and if liked a little grated Parmesan cheese. If some stock is used instead of all water this soup is much improved, or a ham bone or piece of bacon gives an added flavour.

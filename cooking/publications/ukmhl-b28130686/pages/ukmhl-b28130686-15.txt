11 to enter into any account of the processes of diges- tion, to which we refer briefly later on, but we may note this, that the processes of digestion are not noticed by us if they are carried on properly, it is only when our food is poor in quality, or badly prepared, or too great in quantity, that nature rebels and rings the warning bell of pain and discomfort. There are various simple points which we shall do well to remember when considering whether this, that or the other food is digestible. Meats that is tough or stringy is indigestible because our teeth cannot divide them np into the small particles on which only the digestive juices can act properly. Naturally it follows that fluid or soft food is the most easily digested. Fat mixed with the fibre of meat renders it less digestible, for which reason mutton is more easily digested than beef. The question of temperature too must be taken into account, the general rule being that very hot or very cold must be avoided. Curiously enough meat may be eaten hotter than farinaceous food, for the former has time to cool before it reaches the stomach, where it is digested by the gastric juice, whereas the saliva is the juice which digests farina- ceous food and is deprived of its power if the food is too hot. Beside toughness, over concentration of food should be avoided, or in other words, our food should be moist either by nature or rendered so by art. Thus dried, salted or over-cooked meats are notoriously difficult of digestion. Not only, too, can we over roast our meats, and over fry them, but we can over cook them to their detriment in any way, even, for example, in boiling- Though over-boiled

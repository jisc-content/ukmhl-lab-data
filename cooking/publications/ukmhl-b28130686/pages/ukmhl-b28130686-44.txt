40 Jo Clarify Fat:—The fat should be cut up into quite small pieces, all skin and sinew being extracted. Barely cover it with cold water, and boil, removing all scum. When most of the water has boiled away, simmer and stir gently to prevent burn- ing. When the hard portions turn brown and sink to the bottom pour off the fat and strain through a sieve. Lard and suet can be treated much in the same way. Butter should be melted over a moderate fire till transparent. Fat for frying should not be used for any other purpose, but can be used again and again for frying. Fat used for frying fish should be kept apart from that used for meat. Pot frying, or frying in deep fat, is simply dipping the article to be fried into the boiling fat till done ; a basket is most useful for such articles as are egged and bread crumbed. When properly done they should all turn out a nice golden brown. Articles surrounded with batter can be popped straight into the fat, as they will rise to the surface, when they should be turned over—just as a roast is turned—so that both sides may be cooked alike. Dry frying is apt in this country to be so dry that it is not frying at all, but—well grizzling or frizzling. The frying pan should be deep and the fat should as near as possible cover the articles being cooked. But in all cases bear in mind—if the fat is not hot enough—or too hot—your fry will be a failure.

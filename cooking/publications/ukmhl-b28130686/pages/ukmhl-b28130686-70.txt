Pepper. Bread Crumbs. Parsley. This recipe is particularly good for recooking any cold fish that may be left over from a previous meal. Take the fish, pick free from bones and mix with a little anchovy sauce, salt, pepper and parsley. Have ready some melted butter or any fish sauce that may be available. Take some clean soullop shells. Place a layer of sauce at the bottom, then a layer of fish, and so on till the fish is in little mounds. Cover each mound with bread crumbs, and on the top of each place a piece of butter. Put the shells on a dish or tin, and bake in oven about ten minutes when the bread crumbs should be a golden brown colour. Some people prefer to mix the fish with a little grated cheese instead of anchovy sauce.

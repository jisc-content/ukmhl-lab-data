39 by raising the heat of the oven before taking out the joint. The meat should always rest on a trivet to prevent it growing sodden in the grease. Frying. This method of cooking may be divided into two—pot frying and pan frying, or to put it another way, wet and dry frying. The latter is more usual in Great Britain, the former on the Continent. On the whole it may be said that Pot Frying is best adapted for :— Rissoles, croquettes, fish cutlets, whitebait, smelts, fritters, &c. Pan Frying for such dishes as require slower and longer cooking, as :— Cutlets, bacon, sausages, eggs, steaks, fillets, liver, &c. The secret of success in both methods depends upon having the fat, dripping, butter or oil used for frying, at the right temperature. Water, when boil- ing, bubbles up ; just the contrary is the case with fats when they are ready for frying. When the fat, after bubbling (and squealing) becomes still, then is the time to begin your fry. When fat is believed to be at the right temperature, this can be proved by (1) the appearance of a slight blue vapour above it, or (2) by dipping a finger of bread into it; in about fifteen seconds this will begin to turn brown if the fat is ready.

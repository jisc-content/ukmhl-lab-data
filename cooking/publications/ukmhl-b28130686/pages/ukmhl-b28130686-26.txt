This juice acts on all kinds of food, including of course starch and sugar, so that now we have disposed of all the nutritious elements in our food, they have all been put in a fit state for absorption into the blood, or at any rate in a con- dition ready to be acted on by other organs and then absorbed. The pancreatic juice contains at least four ferments, a milk curdling ferment, which very much resembles rennet, a powerful ferment called amylopsin, which converts starches into sugar, trysin, which, as does pepsin, acts upon nitrogenous foods, forming peptones, and straps in, which works upon the fats. So—chyle is formed, which passes into the blood ; so—roughly described—digestion is performed and life sustained. The above is, we need hardly say, a mere sketch of the processes of digestion, but it is sufficient to help the reader to understand what we are about to say on this painful subject of indigestion, just as a Indices r0Uo^ drawing serves to illustrate a point, T|ON ’ when a finished picture is hardly neces- sary.

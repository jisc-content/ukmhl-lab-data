42 The meat should only be turned once, and never with a fork, which pierces holes through which the juices escape. With split-open fish, the inside should be put toward the fire first, to retain the juice. STEWING. Stewing may be called slow boiling, the water being kept “simmering.” The good of the meat goes into the gravy, which always accompanies it to table. A stew can always be reheated, which is not desirable with meat cooked other ways. The meat is put into hot water, and should be stewed till tender— not to a rag. The toughest meat is tender cooked this way, and vinegar applied to it before cooking assists the process. The golden rule for stewing is— go slow. Braising. Also—go slow. The braising pan has a hollow lid, which is filled with live coals, so that literally the meat is between two fires. Stock should be used in preference to water. These are the various methods of cooking adopted in civilized society. We have only outlined them, prefering to give a few useful hints, which, added to the knowledge gained by experience, should help to make cooking profitable and pleasurable.

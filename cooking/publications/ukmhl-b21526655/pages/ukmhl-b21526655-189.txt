Chap, iv.1 MADE DISHES. 109 buttons, and serve round the brains ; or, after preparing as above, serve in a rich white acidulated sauce with lemon-juice. ROLLED VEAL.—E.R. The breast is the best for this purpose. Put the ribs into a stewpan with just water enough to cover them, an onion, a stick of celery, and a bundle of sweet herbs ; let it stew very gently, adding more w'ater as it stews, until It IS tender; then take out the bones, and remove the skin; return the bones into the liquor, w hich will be a fine jelly, and serve as the sauce for several dishes.

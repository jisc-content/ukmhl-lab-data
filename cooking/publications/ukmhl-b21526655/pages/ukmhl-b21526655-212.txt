132 DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Cmp. V. BEEF PALATES A-LA-MARIETTE—E. R. Boil three palates in water for an hour, peel them and cut them in two, lengthways; put a slice of pickled pork between each, tie them together, put them into a stewpan with broth or milk and water, and a piece of butter rolled in flour, salt, whole pepper, a fagot of sweet herbs, and a clove; stew them for some time, then skim and strain the sauce, thicken it, and serv'e it up very white. BEEF PALATES BOILED—E. R. Boil the palates in water, peel them and soak them for some time in sauce made thus: put a piece of butter rolled in flour into a stewpan, with salt, pepper, two shalots, a clove, parsley, thyme, and a fennel-leaf, with as much milk as will be necessary to simmer the palates for about three-quarters of an hour; take them out, dip them in yolk of egg and bread-crumbs, and broil them slowly. Serve them with sharp sauce. PALATES AU FRITUR.—E. R. Boil and peel the palates, split them in tw'o, spread upon them some good forcemeat made of pounded meat, and roll them up like an olive; then dip them in batter made of the yolks of eggs, flour, a spoonful of oil, and a glass of white wine, which must be added a very little at a time; the batter should be a little thicker than very thick cream : fry them of a good colour. Or cut the palates the size of a crowm-piece, after they have been dressed soak them for an hour in lemon-juice or vinegar pickle; dip them in the batter, and fry them. BEEF KIDNEY.—E. R. Cut the kidney into slices, season and brown it in the fr\ ingpan ; then put it into water boiled in the pan, which must be floured, and let it stew' gently for some time. It w'ill be very rich and tender.

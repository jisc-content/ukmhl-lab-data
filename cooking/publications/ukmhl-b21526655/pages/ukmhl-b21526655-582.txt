DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. xxiv. 502 FARINACEOUS JELLY.—E. R. Tapioca, whole rice, pearl-barley, and sago, of each two ounces; boil them in two quarts of water over a slow fire, stir while boiling, strain it through a sieve, and flavour it with sugar, lemon, or orange-juice. CHICKEN PANADA. Boil a chicken till about three parts ready in a quart of water; take off the skin,, cut the white meat off when cold, and put into a marble mortar : pound it to a paste with a little of the water it was boiled in, season with a little salt, a grate of nutmeg, and the least bit of lemon- peel. Boil gently for a few minutes to the consistency you like : it should be such as you can drink, though tolerably thick. This conveys great nourishment in small compass. SIPPETS, WHEN THE STOM.ACH WILL NOT RECEIVE MEAT. On an extremely hot plate put two or three sippets of bread, and pour over them some gravy from beef, mutton, or veal, with which no butter has been mixed. Sprinkle a little salt over. EGGS. An egg broken into a cup of tea, or beaten and mixed with a basin of milk, makes a breakfast more supporting than tea solely. An egg divided, and the yolk and white beaten sepa- rately, then mixed with a glass of wine, will afford two very wholesome draughts, and jirove lighter than when taken together. Eggs very little boiled, or poached, taken in small quantity, convey much nourishment; the yolk only, when dressed, should be eaten by invalids. A GRE.AT RESTORATIVE. Bake two calf’s feet in two pints of water and the same quantity of new milk, in a jar, close-covered, three liours and a half. When cold, remove the fat.

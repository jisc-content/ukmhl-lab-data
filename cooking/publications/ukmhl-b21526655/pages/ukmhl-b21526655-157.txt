MEAT. Chap, hi.] 81 being tender. "When, however, the weather is not fa- vourable for keeping, it will be much improved by being laid in a marinade for a few hours previous to roasting. Mix with three parts water one of vinegar, and pour it over the heef. Each joint must be carefully examined before it is spitted, and any portions that may have been injured cut away ; the whole being wiped with a clean cloth, and, if necessary, washed in warm water. After the cook has taken up the roast meat, she should pour the fat from the dripping-pan into a basin. The next day, when cold, she should scrape oft’ the fine meat-jelly which will be found adhering to the under part, and put it in a suitable vessel for present use, as an assistant to gravies. The dripping then should be melted and strained. If required to be kept long, it should be strained into cold water, and taken oft’ when cold in cakes, and these cakes laid between sheets of writing- paper in a dry place. Suet may be preserved the same way, wuth the addition of a little ftour powdered over it, and will remain good for several days in the hottest climates; whereas, if this process should be neg- lected, it would spoil in twelve hours.

It is a good plan to dress beef-heart in this way a day before roasting a hare, as, when cold, and both hashed together, they can scarcely be distinguished from each other. When there is no hare, hash the heart the same way by cutting it in slices, warming it in gravy with a glass of port wine and melted currant-jelly. N.B. Beef-heart dressed in this manner is a vulgar unsightly dish. Its appearance and flavour may be mucli improved by dividing it in half, covering it with slices of fat bacon, laying the forcemeat over it, rolling it round, and roast- ing as above. The other half will make excellent beef G

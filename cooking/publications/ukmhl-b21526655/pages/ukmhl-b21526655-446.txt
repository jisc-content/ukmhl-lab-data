DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap, xviii. 366 four ounces of salt for seven or eight da3's; separate all the juice that flows from them, and liaving cleaned them, cover them with fresh salt, wash them, divide them into quarters, add to them two quarts of vinegar, or lemon-juice, with four ounces more of salt, and put them in the pan that is by the fire. TO PICKLE OYSTERS.—E. R. Take one hundred large oysters, wash them well in their own liquor, then wash them in as much w'ater as will cover them, putting in a large handful of salt. Take them out, and strain the water; w ipe the oysters dry. Put them in again with half their own liquor, well strained, let them simmer, but not boil. ^A’hen plumped take them off the fire, drain and lay them singly on a dish. Put the liquor on the fire again, and when the scum rises skim it clean, add a wine-glassful of vinegar, two spoonsful of whole black pepper, and two or three blades of mace. Boil all together for a short time : when cold, put in the oysters, cover, and tie them very close to keep out the air. GARLIC PICKLE.—E. R. Steep a quarter of a pound of ginger in strong salt and water for five days, then cut it in slices and dry it in the sun; put it into a large stone jar with a gallon of the best white-wdne vinegar. Peel a pound of garlic, salt it well, and let it stand in the salt three days : wipe it and dry it in the sun, then put it into the pickle; add also a quarter of a pound of long pepper steeped in salt and W’ater, and well dried, a pound of mustard-seed bruised, and a quarter of a pound of turmeric. Shake these ingredients w'ell in the jar, and add anything that it is desirable to pickle as it comes into season, salting and drying them previously in the sun. When com- pleted, the pickle should be kept two years before it is used.

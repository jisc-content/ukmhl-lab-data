DOMESTIC COOKERY. 80 [Chap. m. the bone at the knuckle of a leg or shoulder of lamb, mutton, or venison, when roasted, before they are served. When you wish fried things to look as well as pos- sible, do them twice over with egg and crumbs. Bread that is not stale enough to grate quite fine will not look well. The fat you fry in must always be boiling- hot the moment the meat is put in, and kept so till finished ; a small quantity never fries well. To keep meat hot.—It is best to take it up when done, though the company may not be come; set the dish over a pan of boiling water, put a deep tin cover over it so as not to touch the meat, and then throw a cloth over that.

Tliey are sometimes cut off short, and salted or stewed, but rolling is the better plan ; and in this manner a single rib can be skewered into a handsome lillet, the fat and lean being marbled, and the appearance of the whole improved. Beef re- quires to be hung a long time, in order to ensure its

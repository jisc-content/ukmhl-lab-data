[Chap. xxi. 434 DOMESTIC COOKERY. CHAPTER XXL OBSERVATIONS ON MAKING AND BAKING CAKES.] It is indispensably necessary in making cakes, that all the ingredients should be heated before they are mixed together' for this purpose everything should be prepared for an hour or two previously to their being wanted, and placed near the fire, or upon a stove.

Whether black or white plum-cakes, they require less butter and eggs for having yest, and eat equally light and rich. If the leaven be only of flour, milk and w'ater, and yest, it becomes more tough, and is less easily

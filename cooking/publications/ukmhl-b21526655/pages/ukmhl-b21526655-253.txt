173 Chap, ix.] PIGEONS. PIGEONS WITH PEAS.—E. R. Put the pigeons into a stewpan, with a little butter just to stiffen them; then take them out, put some small slices of bacon into the pan, give them a fine colour, then draw them and add a spoonful of flour to the butter : then put in the pigeons and bacon, turn them, moisten them by degrees with gravy, and bring it to the consistence of sauce. Boil it, season with parsley, young onions, a bay-leaf, a clove of garlic, and let it simmer. When half done, put in a quart of peas : shake them often. When sufficiently done take out the bay-leaf and dish the pigeons, pouring the gravy over them. SALMI OF PARTRIDGES.—E. R. Lard and roast the partridges, leaving them under- done. W’hen cold, cut them into pieces, taking off the skin. Put three spoonsful of oil into a saucepan, a glass of claret, salt, pepper, a shalot, and the juice of a lemon. Toss the partridges in this sauce until they are sufficiently done to send to table. LARKS A LTTALIENNE, OR PURIFIED—E. R. Scald sour grapes, and then stone them; beat up two yolks of eggs with a spoonful of lemon-juice, a very little flour, a bit of butter, and chopped parsley; season it highly with cayenne pepper, add a spoonful or two of gravy. Boil this a moment, then put in the grapes, and stir them with a spoon on the fire to warm, without boiling. Roast the larks with bread-crumbs, and serve them up with the sauce. Obs.—The sauce should be very sharp and highly seasoned.

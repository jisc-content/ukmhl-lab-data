MADE DISHES. Chap, v.] 12'! an inch and a half deep, and press in, very hard, force- meat made in the following manner : a pound and a half of suet sliced very fine, tw'o ounces of cloves, pepper, salt, winter savory, and sw^eet marjoram, mixed well together. The beef must be baked in a deep pan, with water reaching about three-quarters of the way up, and some forcemeat spread over the top, which, when the meat is baked, is taken off, cut into shapes, and laid round the dish. BUBBLE-AND-SQUEAK..—E. R. Cut slices from a cold round of beef; let them be fried quickly until brown, and put them into a dish to keep hot. Clean the pan from the fat; put into it greens and carrots previously boiled and chopped small ; add a little butter, pepper, and salt; make them very hot, and put them round the beef w'ith a little gravy. Cold pork boiled is a better material for bubble-and- squeak than beef, which is always hard; in either case the slices should be very thin and lightly fried. RIBS OF BEEF IN BOUILLI.—E. R. Take the middle of the flat ribs of beef, stew it until the meat is tender, and the bones will come out, em- ploying as small a quantity of water as will cover the meat, and a bundle of sweet herbs. Let it stand until it is cold, remove the fat, add to the gravy, carrots, turnips, and celery, cut in dice, and a dozen or two of small silver onions; w^arm up the beef in it, and send it to table. BOUILLI BEEF.—E. R. Take a handsome boiling piece, draw it with a small quantity of water until the gravy is out ; put it into the stewpan with a verj’ large bunch of parsley, pepper, salt, and an onion. When the meat is done through, add boiling w'ater, and let it stew until perfectly tender; chop the parsley and lay it on the top of the meat.

PUDDINGS. Chap, xi.] 22*7 RICE FRITTERS.—E. R . Slice the rind of a lemon, and boil it in milk, with sugar enough to sweeten it, and a cup of rice. When the ipce is quite soft, take it out; beat up the rice with a glass of brandy, shape it into fritters, brush them with yolks of eggs, cover them with bread crumbs, fry them in butter, and serve them up with lemon-juice squeezed over them. RICE BALLS.—E. R. Pour upon half a pound of rice three pints of boiling milk, and boil it with a little cinnamon, sugar, and lemon-peel until it is quite tender; allow it to remain until it is cold, and then make it into balls. Beat up two eggs, roll the balls in it, and afterwards in grated bread-crumbs •, fry them in lard, drain them on a piece of paper, and serve them up covered with sifted sugar. SOUFFLE.—E. R. Take two ounces of potato-flour, mix it with half a pint of boiled cream, in which the peel of a lemon has been infused j add a little sugar, a large lump of butter, and a little salt. The souffle must be properly, not greatly sweetened, for the less sugar the lighter it will be. Break six eggs; add four only of the yolks, well beaten, to the cream; beat the six whites to a froth, and pour them gently on the other ingredients into a souffle-dish; put it into an oven moderately warm, and when done, powder a little sugar over it, and finish with a salamander. Souffles must be served up the moment they are ready, as they are liable to sink. The genuine French potato-flour is sold at Morel’s Italian Warehouse, Piccadilly. A SOUFFLE PUDDING.—E. R. Take a quarter of a pound of sifted sugar, half a pound of flour, and the same quantity of butter, the yolks of six eggs, and a table-spoonful of orange-flower Q 2

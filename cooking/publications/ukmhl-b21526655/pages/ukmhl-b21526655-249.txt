Cut the rabbit in pieces, reserve the liver ; put a piece of bacon cut in pieces into a stewpan, and brown it well, and then lay it aside; put a piece of butter and the rabbit in the pan ; turn and toss it well until it is quite white. When it is getting brown, dredge a spoonful of flour over it, turning all the while, and when the flour is dry put the rabbit in a plate. Then add a piece more butter to the remaining sauce, and stir it well together, and when brown add a cupful of water; con- tinue stirring, and put in the rabbit with plenty of very small onions, the bacon, some mushrooms, a bunch of parsley and thyme and a laurel-leaf tied with a thread, and some salt and pepper ; let it stew very gently over a slow fire for four hours. Add the liver and a glass of port wine one hour before serving, and should there not be sufficient sauce, a little gravy from time to time put in hot. RABBITS STEWED WITH ONIONS.—E. R. Cut up the rabbits, reserving the livers. Put a piece of butter rolled in flour into a stewpan, add boiling water, stirring till well mixed; then jrut in a spoonful of essence of anchovies, a little jrepper and salt, and then the rabbits slightly dredged with flour. Let them stew till tender, boil a bunch of parsley, put the livers into the stew, and when they are done enough chop them w'ith the parsley, a little pepper and salt, and enough cream to make them into sauce; warm it up in a small saucepan, and spread it equally over the rabbit; have ready six large onions, boiled and pulped through a sieve, and mixed up with cream. Put the onions into the centre of a dish, the rabbits round, and the gravy the last.

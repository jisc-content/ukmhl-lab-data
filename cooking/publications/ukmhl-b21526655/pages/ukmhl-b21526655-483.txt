TO PRESERVE SEVILLE ORANGES WHOLE.—E. R. Grate or peel the oranges, taking off only the outside portion of the rind. Cut off a piece of the stalk, making a small incision at the place, squeeze out as much of the juice as can be obtained, and preserve it in a basin with the pulp that accompanies it. Put the oranges into cold water, let them stand for three days, changing the water twice; then boil them in fresh water till they are very tender, and put them to drain; make a syrup with sugar and water sufficient to cover them, and let them stand in it for two or three days, and drain them well; then put double its weight of sugar to the pulp and juice, boil it together until the scum ceases to rise; then put in the oranges and boil them once more, cover them in the pots with this syrup. They will be fit for use in a week. SCOTTISH MARMALADE.—E. R.

Next quarter the oranges, and scrape out the pulp and juice into a dish, throwing away the white skin, films, and seeds; put the whole into a pan to- gether with seven or eight pounds of sugar, according to the original weight of the oranges: let the whole boil for half an hour; skim it, and pour it into pans for use.

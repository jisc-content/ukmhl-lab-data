Scrape and clean the white skins of soles, then steep them in cold water for an hour or two; then take them out, and stretch them upon a clean board to dry: cut them into very narrow strips, about two inches long. This answers the same purpose as isinglass, and is much more economical. The black' skin will clear colfee; but it makes it taste fishy. The cook who furnished this receipt always removes both the skins of soles, dries the soles well, and eggs and crumbs them before they are put into the pan.

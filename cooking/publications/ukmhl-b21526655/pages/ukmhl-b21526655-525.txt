Chap, xxi.] CAKES. 445 whisk it with eight eggs until cold ; then stir in a pound of fine flour, and keep beating until it is put into the oven, which, if it be quick, will bake it in an hour. WAFERS.â€”E. R. Take fine flour, dried and sifted, make it into a smooth thin batter with very good milk, or a little cream and water; add about as much white wine as will make it thick enough for pancakes, sweeten it with a little loaf- sugar, and flavour with beaten cinnamon. When thus prepared, have the wafer-irons made ready by being heated over a charcoal fire; rub the irons with a piece of linen cloth dipped in butter; then pour a spoonful of the batter upon them, and close them almost im- mediately ; turn them upon the fire, pare the edges with a knife, as some of the batter will ooze out. A short time will bake them, when the irons are properly heated. The wafers must be curled round whilst warm. .SWISS AFTERNOON CAKES. Mix four ounces of fine flour, two ounces of sifted sugar, the grated peel of a lemon, and half a pound of butter, to a paste, with the white of an egg, and a suf- ficient quantity of milk. Roll it thin, cut into biscuits, and brush them over with the yolk of an egg, over which sift fine sugar : bake them on tins. SPANISH CAKE. Put twelve eggs, cleared of the trails, into a large chocolate-pot, and mill them to a froth. Mix by degrees three-quarters of a pound of double-refined sugar, one pound of flour dried, and half a pound of almonds beaten to a paste with orange-flower water ; to which add four spoonsful of rose-water, a glass of mountain wine, and half an ounce of pounded cinnamon. When all the ingredients are in the pot, mill them three-quarters of an hour. Butter a pan, and bake in a slow oven.

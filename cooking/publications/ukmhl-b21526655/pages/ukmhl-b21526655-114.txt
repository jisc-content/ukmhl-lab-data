Save a part of the water in which the salmon has been boiled, mix it with half the quantity of vinegar, boil it up with whole pepper, and when cold pour it over the fish, which must be sent to table with fresh fennel. SALMON IN THE HEBREW FASHION.—E. R. Slice the salmon, and cover it with salt for two hours; then dry it, and draw it through the yolks of eggs. Fry it in oil, and serve it cold with salad. N.B. Any small pieces of salmon may be dressed with salad. TO DRY SALMON.—E. R. Cut the fish down, take out the inside and roe, rub the whole with common salt after scaling it; let it hang twenty-four hours to drain. Pound three or four ounces of saltpetre, according to the size of the fish, two ounces of bay salt, and two ounces of coarse sugar; rub these, when mixed well, into the salmon, and lay it on a large dish or tray two days; then rub it well with common salt, and in twenty-four hours more it will be fit to dry: wipe it well after draining. Hang it either in a wood chimney, or in a dry place, keeping it open with two small sticks. Dried salmon is eaten broiled in paper, and only just warmed through; egg-sauce and mashed potatoes with it; or it may be boiled, especially the bit next the head. TO DRESS DRIED S.ALMON. Cut in slices, and broil in buttered paper. Egg-sauce. If served at breakfast, omit the sauce. Some like it broiled without paper; if so, a very few minutes will do it.

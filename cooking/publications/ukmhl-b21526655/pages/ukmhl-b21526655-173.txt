Boil it for an hour and a half. There will be a quantity of gravy from the juices of the fowl and oysters in the jar; make it into a white sauce with the addition of egg, cream, or a little flour and butter; add oysters to it, or serve it up plain with the fowl.

A BEAUTIFUL AND EXCELLENT WAY OF DRESSING FOWLS.—E. R. When nicely clean, and free from every feather and plug, singe them. Bone, and draw inwards the leg and pinion of the wing.

Clean and wash some rice, put it into the body of the fowl, with a piece of butter rolled in flour, and a little lemon-juice and salt. Put it into the saucepan, and

Chap, xviii.] PICKLES. 367 BARBERRIES PICKLED IN BRINE.—E. R. Gather the barberries before they are too ripe, pick out the leaves and dead stalks, put them into jars, with a large quantity of strong salt and water, and tie them down with bladders: when any scum arises put the barberries in fresh salt and water ; they will not require vinegar, their own acid being sufficient. TO KEEP GREEN PE.AS AND FRENCH BEANS.—E. R. Fill a middling-sized stewpan with green peas, adding two or three table spoonsful of sugar ; place the pan over a brisk charcoal fire. As soon as the peas begin to feel the heat, stir them twice or three times, and when they yield water, pour them out on a dish to drain; when drained, spread them out on paper in an airy room away from the sun, and turn them frequently that they may dry the sooner. It is necessary for their keeping that they should not retain any moisture, for if they do they will soon grow mouldy. French beans may be preserved the same way, and will thus keep till the next season nearly as well flavoured as when first gathered. Peas may be dried gathered green, and are much better for soups than those gathered quite ripe. FAMILY S.AUCE.—E. R. Mix together two ounces of mushroom ketchup, one ounce of walnut ketchup, half an ounce of Indian soy, and one ounce of Chili vinegar. CHETNEY AND QUI HI S.AUCE.—E. R. Take eight ounces of sharp apples, pared and cored, eight ditto of lomatos, eight of salt, eight of brown sugar, and eight ounces of raisins, four ounces of red chilies, four ounces of ginger powdered, two ounces of garlic, and two of shalots. Pound all these ingredients separately in a mortar, using Cayenne pepper if chilies are not to be had. Mix the whole together, and add three quarts of vinegar and one of lemon-juice. Place

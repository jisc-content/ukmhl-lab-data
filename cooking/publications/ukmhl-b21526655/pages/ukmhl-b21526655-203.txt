Chap, v.] MADE DISHES. 123 dredge them with pepper, and then put them on the fire again, turning them until they are quite done; slice a shalot as thin as possible into a spoonful of hot water, lay it on the dish, place the steaks over, and send them to table. By this method the gravy is pre- served ; but many cooks do not take the steaks from the fire untiL quite done, dust them with pepper, and turn them continually over a brisk fire, laying the fat upon the steak. Serve them up with grated horse- radish mixed in a small quantity of melted butter. Should the beef-steak not have hung long enough to be tender, beat it with a rolling-pin; put no salt on, or it will harden the steak. The grand secret is a quick clear fire, frequent turning, and quick cooking, for if the meat be long upon the fire it will be hard. BEEF STEAK A-LA-FRANCAISE.—E. B. Take a rump-steak, pour over it two large spoonsful of the best Lucca oil, and let it remain all niglit. Press the oil from it in tlie morning, and lay it before the fire for a quarter of an hour before it is wanted. Then put it into a frying-pan with a sufficient quantity of water to prevent its burning; fry it until the gravy recedes, and it becomes rather brown ; rub a piece of butter in finely-chopped parsley, pepper, and salt; take the steak out, put the butter over it, and fry it until finished. Pour the contents of the pan over the steak for gravy. ROLLED BEEF-STEAKS.—E. R. Take rump-steaks and beat them with a cleaver until they are quite tender. Tlieu cover them with a fine forcemeat, or farce made of pounded veal and ham, sweet herbs, bacon rasped and pounded, mixed in a pan with the yolks of four eggs and a pint of cream, and stirred together for a few minutes over the (ire. Roll up the steaks, tie them tight, and fry them until brown. Then put them into a stewpan with a pint of gravy, a glass of port wine, one of Reading sauce, and a few pickled mushrooms; serve very hot. N. B.—This

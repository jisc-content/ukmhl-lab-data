PICKLES. Chap, xvm.] 361 jars are preferable to large ones,, as frequent opening would spoil the tomatos. (PICKLED APPLES FOR MANGOES.—E. U. The apples should be large, of a sharp flavour, and not quite ripe. Pare them and take out the core with a scoop, making the hole as small as possible and not boring the apple quite through. Rub them well with salt, and allow them to remain three or four days, then dry them in a clean cloth. Take husked mustard-seed, whole black pepper, garlic, ginger sliced in long thin slices, chilies, and turmeric. Fill the apples with these ingredients, and put them into a jar. Boil some white- wine vinegar with the remainder of the spices, &c., and while it is moderately warm cover the apples with it, putting as small a quantity as will suffice to keep them. PICKLED CUCUMBERS.—E. R. The small long sort are the best. Let them be fresh gathered; pull off the blossoms, but do not rub them. Pour over them a strong brine of salt and water boiling hot, cover them close, and let them stand all night. The next day stir them gently to take off the sand, drain them on a sieve and dry them on a cloth ; make a pickle with the best white-wine vinegar, ginger, pep- per (long and round), and a little garlic. When the pickle boils throw in the cucumbers, cover them and make them boil as quickly as possible for three or four minutes. Put them into a jar with the vinegar, and cover them closely; when cold put in a sprig of dill, the seed downward. They will be e.xceedingly crisp and green done in this manner; but if they do not appear to be of a fine colour, boil up the pickle the next day and pour it boiling on the cucumbers. TO PICKLE FRENCH BEANS. Gather them before they become stringy, and without taking off the ends, put them into a very strong brine until they become yellow: drain the liquor from them.

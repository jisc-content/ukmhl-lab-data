[Chap. xx. 432 DOMESTIC COOKERY. TO PREPARE ICE FOR ICING. ' Get a few pounds of ice, break it almost to powder, throw a large handful and a half of rock salt among it. You must prepare it in a part of the house where as little of the •warm air comes as you can possibly con- trive. The ice and salt being in a bucket, put your cream into an ice-pot and cover it; immerse it in the ice, and draw that round the pot, so as to touch every possible part. In a few minutes put a spatula or spoon in, and stir it well, removing the parts that ice I'ouud the edges to the centre.

Rub some fine sugar on lemon or orange, to give the colour and flavour, then squeeze the juice of either on its respective peel: add water and sugar to make a tine sherbet, and strain it before it be put into the ice-pot. If orange, the greater proportion should be of the China juice, and only a little of Seville, and a small bit of the peel grated by the sugar.

To a pound of preserved fruit of any kind add a quart of cream, the juice of two lemons to thicken the flavour, and sugar to your taste. Rub the whole through

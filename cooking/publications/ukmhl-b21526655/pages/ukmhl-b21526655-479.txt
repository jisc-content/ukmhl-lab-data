PRESERVES. 399 Chap, six.] CURRANT JELLY.—E. R. Take of red and white currants equal quantities, tie them down close in a jar, put them into a kettle of w'ater over a slow fire to hoil for two hours; strain the liquor through a fine sieve, but do not squeeze the cur- rants hard ; then to every pint of juice put three-quarters of a pound of loaf-sugar pounded; set it over a very slow fire until the sugar is dissolved. Do not stir it until the scum rises thick enough to he taken off at once, then let it boil up quickly for twenty minutes. FRUIT JELLY' OF ANY' KIND.—E. R.

Pare and core a peck of codlins, put them into a well-tinned saucepan, add as much spring water as will just cover them. Boil the whole to a pulp, beat them as for apple-sauce, then run them through a flannel liag, and to every pint of juice put half a pound of good loaf- sugar ] boil it and skim it well until it jellies ; then pour it into pots or moulds. August is the best time to make this jelly, when the codlins are full grown, but not turned. Crabs greatly improve this jelly, and, in their absence, a little lemon-juice. TO PRESERVE BARBERRIES IN BUNCHES.—E. R. Take the female barbemes, reserve the largest bunches; then pick the rest from the stalks, put them into as much water as will make a syrup for the bunches, hoil them until quite soft; then strain them through a sieve, and to every pint of juice put a pound and a half

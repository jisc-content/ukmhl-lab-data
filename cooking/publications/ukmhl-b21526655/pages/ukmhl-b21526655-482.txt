DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. xix. 402 TO PRESERVE STRAWBERRIES IN WINE. Put a quantity of the finest large strawberries into a gooseberry-bottle, and stiew in three large spoonsful of fine sugar; fill up with Madeira wne or fine sherry. PRESERVED ORANGES.—E. R. Take the largest, deepest coloured, and roughest oranges that can be obtained, grate off the rind very- nicely, and throw the oranges into water; let them remain twelve hours, changing the water once during that time, to take out the bitter. Put them into a cloth, and boil them; when tender cut them in quarters, and, after taking out tlie pulp, throw them into cold water. Make a thin syrup, clear them in it, after which enrich the syrup, adding the pulp; make it very thick, and pour it over the oranges in jars. FINE ORANGE MARMAL.\DE.-E. R. Seville oranges and lump-sugar in equal quantities; clarify the sugar with the white of an egg and a gill of water to each pound, grate the yellow rind off the oranges, then cut the skin through into four quarters, take off the white of the peel, and pare the other portion very thin. Put them on the fire with as much water as will cover them; boil till they are quite tender. Press the juice through a sieve, cut and drain the chips, and, when the sugar boils, put in both, and, after it has boiled about ten minutes, the grated portion also; let it then boil quickly, till it jellies. It is necessary to keep stir- ring all the time it is on the fire. ORANGE MARiMAL-VDE.—E. U. Take the clearest Seville oranges that can be ob- tained, cut them in two, take out all the pulp and juice, carefully removing the seeds and white skin, and put it into a basin. Boil the rinds in hard water until they are lender, changing the water two or three times while they are boiling; then pound them in a marble mortar;

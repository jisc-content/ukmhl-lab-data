Chap, xxi.] 435 CAKES. divided, than if the butter be first put with those ingre- dients, and the dough afterwards set to rise by the fire. The heat of the oven is of great importance for cakes, especially those that are large. If not pretty quick, the batter will not rise. Should you fear its catching, by being too quick, put some paper over the cake to pre- vent its being burnt. If not long enough lighted to have a body of heat, or it is become slack, the cake will be heavy. To know when it is soaked, take a broad-bladed knife that is very bright, and plunge it into the very centre; draw it instantly out, and if the least stickiness adheres, put the cake immediately in, and shut up the oven. If the heat was sufficient to raise, but not to soak, I have, with great success, had fresh fuel quickly put in, and kept the cakes hot until the oven was fit to finish the soaking, and they turned out extremely w'ell. But those who are employed ought to be particularly careful that no mistake occurs from negligence when large cakes are to be baked. Bread and cakes wetted with milk eat best when new; but become stale sooner than others. Cakes kept in drawers or wooden boxes have a dis- agreeable taste. Earthen pans and covers, or tin boxes, preserve them best. CA.KES, &c. ICING FOR CAKES. For a large one, beat and sift eight ounces of fine sugar, put into a mortar, with four spoonsful of rose- water, and the whites of two eggs beaten and strained; whisk it well, and when the cake is almost cold, dip a feather in the icing, and cover the cake well; set it in the oven to harden, but do not let it stay to discolour. Put the cake in a dry place. TO ICE A VEHY LARGE CAKE.; Beat the whites of twenty fresh eggs; then by degrees beat a pound of double-refined sugar sifted through a 2 F 2

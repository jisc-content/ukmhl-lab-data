136 DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. vi. CHAPTER VI. MADE DISHES OF MUTTON. LEG OF MUTTON BRAISED.—E. R. Take a very small leg of mutton, cut off the knuckle, and trim it nicely; half roast it. Then put it into a stewpan with the knuckle-bone broken, the trimmings, a few slices of fat bacon or two ounces of butter, an onion stuck with cloves, and a bundle of sweet herbs. Shake the stewpan over the fire until there is gravy enough from the meat and the trimmings to stew the mutton; and take care to turn it in the braise. When very tender, take it up, remove the fat from the gravy, strain it, and boil it quickly until it is reduced to a glaze. Cover the mutton with this jelly, and serve it up with a purtie of vegetables beneath. The best is tliat of garlic. Boil a sufficient quantity for five mi- nutes, then strain off the water, and pour on fresh from a keitle boiling; when the garlic has boiled five minutes more, pour this away, adding fresli a third and fourth time, and boiling the garlic five minutes between each change of water. Taste the garlic, and if it has not lost all its disagreeable flavour, boil it in fresh water until it is rich and delicate. A small shoulder of mut- ton may be boned and stuffed, and dressed the same way. STEWED SHOULDER OF MUTTON.—E. R.

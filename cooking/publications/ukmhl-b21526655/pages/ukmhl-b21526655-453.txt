Slice the tomatos, and put a layer into a jar, sprinkle salt over it, then another layer of tomatos and salt, until the jar is fiill. Stir the contents now and then for three days, keeping the jar in a warm place by the lire. Then allow it to remain untouched for twelve days. Then press the juice from the tomatos, and boil it wdth mace, pepper, allspice, ginger, and cloves ; about two ounces in all to a quart of juice : a few blades of mace, twelve cloves, a spoonful of pounded ginger, and the remainder pepper and allspice. In three months boil it again with fresh spice. TOMATO KETCHUP.-E. R. Take six pounds of tomatos, sprinkle them with salt, let them remain for a day or two, then boil them until the skins will separate easily; pour them into a colander or coarse sieve, and press them through, leaving the skins behind ; put into the liquor a handful of shalots, a pint of chili vinegar, and half a pint of wine, pepper, cloves, ginger, and allspice; boil them together, until a third part has w’asted ; then bottle it, closing the bottles very securely. It must be shaken before it is used. CHIU VINEGAR.—E. R. Fill a bottle with the chilies or capsicums, and cover them with vinegar; cork it up closely, let it stand for three weeks or a month, then pour off the vinegar, and fill up the bottle again; good capsicums will flavour several additions of vinegar. If capsicums are not pro- curable, put an ounce of cayenne jiepper to a quart of vinegar, and let it stand some time, shaking it occa- sionally. Then strain it off, and fill the bottle up again.

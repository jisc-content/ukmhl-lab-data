Chap, xi.] PUDDINGS. 215 DUTCH PUDDING.—E. R. Melt half a pound of butter in a quarter of a pint of milk, let it stand till it is lukewarm, then strain it into a pound of flour, add four eggs well beaten, and two large spoonsful of yeast; beat the whole very well together, and let it stand for an hour before the fire to rise. Then beat into it two spoonsful of moist sugar, and half a pound of currants; put it into a dish or tin well buttered, and when baked turn it out before sending to table. N.B.

Line the dish with paste for turning out; and when filled with the above, lay a crust over, as if it were a pie, and bake it in a slow oven. It is as good cold as hot. A FRIAR’S OMELET. Boil a dozen apples, as for sauce; stir in a quarter of a pound of butter, and the same of white sugar. When cold, add four eggs well beaten; put it into a baking-dish thickly strewed over with crumbs of bread, so as to stick to the bottom and sides; then put in the apple mixture; strew’ crumbs of bread plentifully over the top. When baked, turn it out, and grate pounded sugar over it. A SWISS PUDDING. Put layers of crumbs of bread and sliced apples, with sugar between, till the dish be as full as it will

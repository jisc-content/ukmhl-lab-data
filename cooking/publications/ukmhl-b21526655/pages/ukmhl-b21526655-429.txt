Ohs.—The meat must be salted on a board that is well perforated with holes to let the brine run from it, aiul it must be covered up closely with a coarse cloth to keep out the air; and while salting take care to lay the pieces as close as possible one upon the other. TO CURE B.\CON FOR L.A.RDING, BRAISING, &o.—E. R. Take the fattest part of the pork, and to every ten pounds employ a pound of pounded salt; rub it very well over, put the pieces one upon another upon boards, and lay boards with a heavy weight upon the top; leave it in a dry cool place for about a month, then hang it up to dry without smoking. The hardest is the best for larding; and bacon cured this way is preferable for culi- nary purposes, since the saltpetre usually employed will turn veal or poultry red, when braised with any portion of the lean. TO DRY PIGS’ HEADS.—E. R. Soak the heads well in water, and let them lie in it for a night, then remove the brains. Take a quart of bay-salt, two quarts of common salt, and a pound and a quarter of brown sugar; put it into a gallon and a half of spring water, and stir it until the whole is dissolved. This quantity will be sufficient for three heads: be care- ful to turn them in the brine at least every other day, and to keep them well covered. Dry them in wood smoke. TO DRY A GOOSE.—E. R. Split a fine fat goose down the hack; rub it with something less than a quarter of an ounce of saltpetre, and then salt it well with a handful of common salt and the same of coarse brown sugar ; let it lie in pickle for ten days in summer, and fourteen in winter, rubbing and turning it every day in the pickle. Roll it in sawdust.

[Chap, txiii. DOMESTIC COOKERY. 4S0 When the family is absent, or there is not a great call for cream, a careful dairy-maid seizes the opportunity to provide for the winter-store : she should have a book to keep an account, or get some one to write down for her the produce of every week, and set down what butter she pots. The weight the pot wdll hold should be marked on each in making at the pottery. In another part of the book should be stated the poultry reared and the weekly consumption. OBSERVATIONS RESPECTING CHEESE. This well-known article differs according to the pas- ture iu which the cows feed. Various modes of prepar- ing may effect a great deal ; and it will be bad or good of its kind, by being in unskilful hands, or the contrary; but much will still depend on the former circumstance. The same land rarely makes very fine butter and re- markably fine cheese ; yet due care may give one pretty good, where the other excels in quality. When one is not as fine as the other, attention and change of method may amend the inferior. There is usually, however, too much prejudice in the minds of dairy-people to make them give up an old custom for one newly recommended. This calls for the eye of the superior. A gentleman has been at the expense of pro- curing cattle from every county noted for good cheese, and it is affirmed that the Cheshire, double Gloucester, North Wiltshire, Chedder, and many other sorts, are so excellent as not to discredit their names. As the cows are all on one estate, it should seem that the mode of making must be a principal cause of the difference in flavour; besides, there is much in the size and manner of keeping. Cheese made on the same ground, of new, skimmed, or mixed milk, will differ greatly, not in richness only, but also in taste. Those who direct a dairy in a gentle- manâ€™s family should consider iu which way it can be managed to the best advantage. Even with few cows, cheese of value may be made from a tolerable pasture.

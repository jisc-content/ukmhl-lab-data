As soon as the paste has risen proceed thus:â€”Make a hole in the middle of the remaining flour, put into it a little salt, about a salt-spoonful, the same quantity of powdered sugar to take off any bitter taste in the yeast, and a little water to melt it; the butter broken into small pieces, and the eggs; work it all well together, and knead it thoroughly, spreading it out and working it well: then spread it out entirely, and lay the yeast or leavened paste all over it, taking the greatest care in kneading and shifting the paste about to mix both intimately together.

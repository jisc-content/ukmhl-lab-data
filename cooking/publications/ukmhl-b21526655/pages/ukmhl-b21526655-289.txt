PUDDINGS. Chap, xt.] 209 ALMOND CUSTARD.—E. R. Boil in a pint of mill<, or cream, two or three bitter almonds, a stick of cinnamon, and a piece of lemon- peel, pared thin, with eight or ten lumps of sugar ; let it simmer to extract the flavour, then strain it and stir it till cold. Beat the yolks of six eggs, and mix it v'ith the milk, and stir the whole over a slow fire until of a proper thickness, adding an ounce of sweet almonds, beaten fine in rose water. MARROW' PUDDING.—E. R. Four ounces of marrow, four of biscuits, three of jar raisins stoned, candied orange-peel, sugar and nutmeg to the taste. Place these articles in layers in a dish sur- rounded by paste; then beat up four eggs, leaving out the whites of two, in half a pint of cream, or good milk, and pour it over the other ingredients: it will take an hour and a half to bake. BREAD AND BUTTER PUDDING.-E. R. Make a custard of an egg and half a pint of milk, by boiling the milk with a little lemon-peel and sugar, and beating up the egg in it, putting it on the fire to thicken; then butter slices of bread or French roll, and soak them for an hour or two in this mixture; then lay them in a dish, sprinkling currants, washed, dried, and picked, between each layer, and a little pounded sugar, putting some sweetmeats on the top, and pour over it another half-pint of milk beaten up with two eggs. The cold fat of a loin of veal may be used instead of butter or marrow. BAKED VERMICELLI PUDDING. Simmer four ounces of vermicelli in a pint of new milk ten minutes; then put to it half a pint of cream, a tea-spoonful of pounded cinnamon, four ounces of butter warmed, the same of white sugar, and the yolks of four eggs, well beaten. Bake in a dish without a lining. p

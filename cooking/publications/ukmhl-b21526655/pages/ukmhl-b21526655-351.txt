Cut the cabbage very thin, and put it into the stew- pan with a small slice of ham, and half an ounce of butter at the bottom, half a pint of broth, and a gill of vinegar. Let it stew covered three hours. When it is very tender, add a little more broth, salt, pepper, and a table-spoonful of pounded sugar. Mix these well, and boil them all till the liquor is wasted ; then put it into the dish, and lay fried sausages on it. STEWED TOMATOS.

Take a head of white cabbage, cut it into small pieces, pour on it some hot water, and in a few minutes drain the cabbage, and throw away the liquor; then take five or six very sour apples, peel them, and cut them into, small pieces. Put some thin slices of bacon into the bottom of a saucepan, cover it with a layer of cabbage and apples; then with bacon and beef cut into pieces with the cabbage, and apples over it; and so on until the saucepan is filled, covering the whole with thin slices of bacon. Pour on it a cup of cold water, and put the cover on the saucepan, and put it on a light fire; when it begins to boil mix it up, and do so repeatedly, that the ingredients may not form a kind of crust upon the saucepan. When the meat is sufficiently boiled, and the cabbage is quite tender, add some salt, and a few spoonsful of vinegar, and, having boiled it a little longer, serve it up.

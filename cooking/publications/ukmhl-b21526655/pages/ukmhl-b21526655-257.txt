PIES. Chap, x.] Ill FINE TART PASTE.—E. R. Mix half an ounce of sifted sugar with half a pound of flour, adding half a wine-glass of boiling cream: work two ounces of butter into it, roll it very thin, and when made into tarts brush it over with white of egg. SHORT CRUST.—E. R. l\Iix two ounces of sugar with a pound of flour, rub into it three ounces of butter ; beat the yolk of two eggs into a little cream, using sufficient to make the flour into a paste, roll it out thin and bake in a moderate oven. PUFF PASTE.—E. R, Sift half a pound of the best flour, rub lightly into it a quarter of a pound of butter, mix it with cold water, roll it out. Lay on it, in small pieces, part of another quarter of a pound of butter: fold the paste, roll it again, and add the remainder of the butter, strew lightly on it a little flour, and set it in a cold place. LIGHT PASTE.—E. R. Beat the white of an egg into a strong froth, mix with it as much water as will make three-quarters of a pound of flour into a stiff paste, roll it very thin, and lay upon it, at three several times, a quarter of a pound of butter. VERY LIGHT PASTE—E. R. Mix the flour and water together, roll the paste out, and lay bits of butter upon it. Then beat up the white of an egg, and brush it all over the paste before it is folded ; repeat this when rolling out, and adding the butter each time till the whole of he white of egg is used. It will make the paste riset and become very flaky. N

DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. ii. 40 serving up fish. If, for the sake of the appearance of the table, boiled fish should be sent up covered, care should be taken, by lifting up the covers a little, to allow the egress of the steam. Moreover, the practice of put- ting boiled and fried fish upon the same dish cannot be too strongly reprobated ; while garnishing hot fish with cold parsley is abominable.

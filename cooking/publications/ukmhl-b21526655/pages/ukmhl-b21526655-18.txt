PREFACE. XU with this difference, bringing on lingering illness instead of sudden death, as the most sohd kind of animal food; and ladies and gentlemen, afraid of becoming stout, have seriously injured then health by taking a cup of gruel or a piece of diy bread, immediately before dinner, in order to damp the appetite. The happy medium between hijurious abstinence and injurious excess is unfortunately too seldom preserved; but there cannot be a doubt that light and nourishing food may be eaten, if the quantity be too large, with greater impunity than when its solidity renders it less easily digestible. In Eiigland, cookery, in small respectable fa- milies, where it is necessary to study economy, has to contend with a prejudice concerning the vulgarity of certahi viands—many portions of an animal, which in France are in great esteem, being rejected in this country upon very insufficient groimds. Vulgarity in eating can only be connected with grossness ; and sheep’s heads, shoulders of mutton, and even fat pork, may be so refined in the crdinary process as to retain nothing offensive either to the eye or the palate, while the vulgarity must consist in the manner in which the viands arc served and demolished, and not in the viands themselves. It is the province of the cook to render unsightly ob- j ects pleasing; and thus many tilings may be brought to table in disguise, which woidd not be achnissible in their original forms.

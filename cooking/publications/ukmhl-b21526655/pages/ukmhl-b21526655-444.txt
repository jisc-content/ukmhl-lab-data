DOMESTIC COOKERY. 364 [CaAp. XVIII. TO PICKLE CODLINS.—E. R. Gather the coJlins fresh from the tree, let them be of a good shape, at their full growth, and just before they ripen. Lay them in a brine of salt and water strong enough to bear an egg, shifting them every day for three days. Then cut a slice olf the top of the apples, scoop out the core, and fill the orifice with mus- tard made with vinegar and hot water, a clove of garlic, a little ginger in powder, and eight or nine pepper- corns: then tie the top slice on each apple, and put them into a stone jar. To a gallon of vinegar put a pound of the best flour of mustard, mixed smoothly, eight or nine heads of garlic, two ounces of whole black pepper, an ounce and a half of shred ginger, and a large handful of salt. Boil it well, and while boiling pour it on the codlins; boil the vinegar several times, and tlien tie the codlins down. INDIA PICKLE.—E. R. Put two hundred gherkins, three pints of small onions, one quart of nasturtians, one ditto of radish pods, one quartern of French beans, six cauliflowers, and two hard white cabbages sliced, into a pan, and sprinkle them with salt, the onions having been previously peeled and laid in salt and water for a week to take off their strength. Then, after a day or two, take them out of the pan and dry them thoroughly in a warm place in the shade; they must be spread out separately. To two gallons of vinegar put an ounce and a half of allspice, the same of long pepper and of white, and two of ginger, tied up in muslin bags. When cold, mix with the vinegar a pound and a half of flour of mustard, and two table- spoonsful of cayenne pepper. Boil it well together, and pour it on the pickle: the vegetables mentioned, not being all procurable at the same time, may be added separately, at different periods, but they must all undergo the salting and drying process.

PREFACE. XVIU be weighed. The cook tastes his preparations in- stead of employing the scales; and, where the quan- tities are indefinite, it is impossible to adjust the exact proportions of spice or other condiments which it will be necessary to add in order to give the proper flavour. In spices, j)articularly, the cook must be guided by the taste of the parties by whom she is employed; many persons being unable to eat of dishes which are highly peppered, while there are sometimes objections to the flavour- of mace, nutmeg, cardamoms, &c. Much judgment is requu-ed in the use of salt: as a general rule, it may be said that no mixture shoidd be made with- out a small portion : thus, in the flour for pastry, a certain quantity, not exceeding a salt-spoonful, wiU be necessary, and aU sweet things require a little; but the cook must be cai-eful not to exceed the just limitâ€”a pinch, to use the expression scouted by the faculty, being sufficient upon some occasions. Nothing can be so bad as oversalting soup or any ragout which tastes too strongly of it; for salt is easily added by the partakers of the dish, although some minute portion must be put in at first, to pre- vent the ra-wness which would otherwise prevail. Highly-salted viands will create thirst, while a large quantity of salt, if not previously submitted to the culinary process, may be eaten not only without inconvenience, but with advimtage to the health. Sugar should also be applied with great discretion.

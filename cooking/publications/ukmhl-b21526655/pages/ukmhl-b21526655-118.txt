[Chap. II. 48 DOMESTIC COOKERY. SALT COD.â€”E. R. If very dry, it should he soaked for six hours in soft water, then placed upon a brick or stone floor for eight hours, soaked again for six hours longer, and then brushed with a hard brush. Under this treatment the most stubborn fish will swell considerably if boiled gently in soft water ; two separate soakings are better than one, however continuous, since the alternate expansion and contraction loosens the fibres of the fish, and occasions it to come off in finer flakes. It is generally served up with parsneps and egg-sauce, and may be warmed the next day, separated into flakes, and put into a good sauce with chopped eggs at the top, and a waU of mashed potatoes or mashed parsneps all round. TO DRESS SALT COD OR LING. Soak and clean the piece you mean to dress, then lay it all night in water with a glass of vinegar. Boil it enough, then break into flakes on the dish; pour over it parsneps boiled, beaten in a mortar, and then boil up with cream and a large piece of butter rubbed with a bit of flour. It may be served as above with egg-sauce instead of the parsnep, and the root sent up whole; or the fish may be boiled and sent up without flaking, and sauces as above. Cod that has been dressed eats well done like dried salmon, with eggs, cream, &c. TO DRESS SALT FISH THAT HAS BEEN BOILED; AN EXCELLENT DISH. Break it into flakes, and put it into a pan with sauce thus made: beat boiled-parsneps in a mortar, then add to it a cup of cream, and a good piece of butter rolled in flour, a little white pepper, and half a tea-spoonful of mustard, all boiled together; keep the fish no longer on the fire than to become hot, but not boil.

Reduce a quantity of the consommtie or stock over a brisk fire, and mix it with boiling cream; boil it together and serve it, stirring it very well to the last. BkCHAMEL.—E. R.

Add an equal quantity of good veal or mutton broth, and cream. Let it boil gently one hour, stirring it all the time : strain it through a soup-strainer. A GRAVY WITHOUT MEAT. Put a glass of small beer, a glass of water, some pepper, salt, lemon-peel grated, a bruised clove or two, and a spoonful of walnut-pickle or mushroom-ketchup into a basin. Slice an onion, flour and fry it in a piece of butter till it is brown. Then turn all the above into a small tosser with the onion and simmer it covered twenty minutes. Strain it off for use, and when cold, take off the fat. CULLIS, OR BROWN GRAVY.

If the directions be followed exactly, this excellent pudding will never disappoint. GLOUCESTER PUDDINGS.—E. R. Weigh three eggs in the shell; take their weight in flour and in butter; take twelve bitter almonds, and five ounces of pounded sugar; beat all together for half an hour, and put the mixture into pudding-cups, filling the cups only half full. Bake them half an hour. POMMES AU BEURRE.—BUTTERED APPLES.—E. R. Peel the apples and remove the core without cutting them through, taking care not to break them. Cut slices of bread the circumference of the apples, butter a dish, put on the bread, and place an apple on each slice. Fill the hole made by the removal of the core with white sugar, place a piece of butter the size of a walnut on each hole ; put them into a gentle oven, and renew the sugar and butter several times. They will take twenty minutes, or half an hour. Be very careful not to let the bread burn, or the apples lose tlieir shape. .\N APPLE CHARLOTTE.—E. R. Pare and slice a quantity of apples; cut off" the crust of a loaf, and cut slices of bread and butter. Butter the inside of a pie-dish, and place bread and butter all round; then put in a layer of apples sprinkled with lemon-peel, chopped very fine, and a considerable quan- tity of good brown sugar. Then put on a layer of bread and butter, and anotlier of apples, lemon-peel, and sugar, until the dish is fiill, squeezing over the juice of lemons, so that every part shall be equally flavoured. Cover up the dish with the crusts of the bread and the peels of the apples, to prevent it from browning or burning: bake it an hour and a quarter, then take off the peels and the crust, and turn it out of the dish.

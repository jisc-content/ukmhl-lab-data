If a sitting hen is troubled with vermin, let her he well washed with a decoction of white lupins. The pip in fowls is occasioned by drinking dirty water, or taking filthy food. A white thin scale on the tongue is the symptom. Pull the scale oftâ€™ with your nail, and rub the tongue with some salt, and the complaint will he removed. It answers well to pay some boy employed in the farm or stable so much a score for the eggs he brings in. It will be his interest then to save them from being pur- loined, which nobody but one in his situation can pre- vent; and sixpence or eightpence a score will be buying eggs cheap.

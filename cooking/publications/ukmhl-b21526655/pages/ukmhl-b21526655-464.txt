A PRESERVE OF APRICOTS.-E. R. Boil ripe apricots in syrup until they will mash ; beat them in a mortar; take half their weight in loaf-sugar, and sufficient w'ater to dissolve it; boil all together, and skim until it is clear, and the sjTup thick like fine jelly. • TO PRESERVE GREEN APRICOTS.—E. R. Cover the bottom of a stewpan with vine-leaves, fill the pan with apricots and cold spring water, laying more vine-leaves on the top. Put them over a slow fire until they turn yellow; then talse them off, and wipe them well with a flannel and a little salt, and put them over the fire in the same water to green them. Plave ready a thin syrup ; boil the apricots up in it once, and repeal, the process on the two following days. Drain them froiirdhe syrup, and, rendering it very strong with sugar, boil them again in the thick syrup, and put them by for use. Peaches, nectarines, &c., may be preserved the same way. TO PRESERVE RIPE PEACHES.—E. R. October is the best month, as they are then harder and larger. Put them into a preserving-pan full of cold water with a slice or two of lemon; set them on a slow fire; have ready a sieve and a napkin: be careful not to do them too much: some M'ill be ready sooner than others. When they begin to be soft they are enough : drain them on the sieve, and let them stand until cold ; then put them into glasses : pound sugar- candy very fine in a mortar, dissolve it in brandy, and fill up the glasses •with it.

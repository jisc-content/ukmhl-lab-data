113 MADE DISHES. Chap iv.] VEAL CUTLETS STEWED WITH CELERY.—E R. Cut the cutlets from the best part of the neck, taking care in removing the meat from the bones to cut it in a good shape ; make gravy of the bones, stewing them with three or four heads of celery cut and scalded, a little salt, pepper, and stewed onion; strain the gravy, returning t!ie celery into it; thicken it with butter and flour, and pour it boiling hot upon the cutlets. Stew them till they are tender, and garnish with lemon and small forcemeat- balls, fried. SCOTCH COLLOPS.—E R. Cut the collops thin, beat them a little, fry them in butter for about two minutes, after having seasoned them with a little beaten mace ; place them in a deep dish as they are fried, and cover them with gravy. Put some butter into the frying-pan, and allow it just to change col- our. Then strain the collops through a colander from the gravy, and fry them quickly; pour the burnt butter from the pan, and put in the gravy, adding a little lemon-juice. The gravy may be made of the trimmings of the veal; serve it up with forcemeat-balls. •SCOTCH COLLOPS WHITE.—E. R. Cut the collops the size of a crow n piece, and not much thicker ; butter the bottom of a stewpan and lay the meat piece by piece upon it, having shaken a little flour upon the butter ; add two blades of mace, and a little nutmeg. ' Set the stewpan on the fire, and toss it together until the meat is very white ; then add half a pint of strong veal I broth and a quarter of a pint of cream ; toss tlie whole, and when simmered enough, let them just boil; add a little lemon-juice, some forcemeat-balls, and either oysters or mushrooms, which must both be very white; if neces- I sary, thicken the sauce with the yolk of eggs, but do not ‘ let it boil afterwards.

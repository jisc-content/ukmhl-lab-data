Chap, sxiii.] POULTRY-YARD. 495 GUINEA HENS I Lay a great number of eggs ; and, if you can discover (f the nest, it is best to put them under common hens, i which are better nurses. They require great warmth, I quiet, and careful feeding with rice swelled with milk, or I bread soaked in it. Put two peppecrorns down their flr throat when first hatched. I PIGEONS t Bring two young ones at a time, and breed every month, if w'ell looked after and plentifully fed. They $1 should be kept very clean, and the bottom of the dove- cote be strewed with sand once a-month at least. Tares and white peas are their proper food. They should have plenty of fresh water in their house. Starlings and other birds are apt to come among them, and suck the eggs. Vermin are likewise their great enemies, and destroy them. If the breed should be too small, put a few tame pigeons of the common kind, and of their own colour, among them. Observe not to have too large a proportion of cock-birds ; for they arc quarrelsome, and will soon thin the dove-cote. Pigeons are fond of salt, and it keeps them in health. Lay a large heap of clay near the house, and let the salt-brine that may be done with in the family be poured upon it. Bay-salt and cummin-seeds mixed are a universal re- medy for the diseases of pigeons. The backs and breasts are sometimes scabby ; in which case, take a quarter of a pound of bay-salt and as much common salt, a pound K of fennel-seed, a pound of dill-seed, as much cummin- iseed, and an ounce of assafoetida; mix all with a little wheaten flour, and some fine worked clay : when all are well beaten together, ]>ut it into two earthen pots, and II bake them in the oven. When cold, put them on the fi table in the dove-cote j the pigeons will eat it, and thus I be cured.

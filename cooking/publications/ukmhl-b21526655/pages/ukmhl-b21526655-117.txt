47 Chap, it.] FISH. BAKED COD.—E. R. Butter a pan, lay the fish in it, with a bundle of sweet herbs, an onion stuck with six cloves, a spoonful of black and white pepper, salt, and a quart of water; flour the fish, stick it over with pieces of butter, and add to it raspings of bread. When sufficiently baked, take out the fish careftdly, strain the gravy, thicken it, and add'to it a pint of shrimps, half a pint of oysters, a spoonful of essence of anchovies, and a glass of Harvey or Reading sauce ; warm all together, and pour it round the fish; garnish with lemon, crisped parsley, and fried bread, or paste. Codlings are very good dressed in this maimer. COD ESPAGNOLE.—E. R. Bone the tail of a cod, and cut it into slices, season them with white pepper and salt, then fry them, and when cold, put them into a pickle made of vinegar boiled with peppercorns, a few cloves, and mace, and bay leaves ; add when cold a tea-cupful of sweet oil; lay the fish in a jar with slices of onion between each, and cover the whole with the vinegar. Salmon may be pickled in the same manner. When served up at table put a sufficient number of pieces in the centre of a dish, and raise round it a wall of salad. STEWED COD.—E . R. Cut the cod into slices, season them with pepper and salt, put them into a stewpan with half a pint of water, and some good gravy. After stewing a few minutes, add half a pint of wine, -he juice of half a lemon, a dozen or two of oysters with their liquor, a piece of butter rolled in flour, and two or three blades of mace. When the fish is sufficiently stewed, which will be in a quarter of an hour, serve it up with the sauce. Any kind of fish sauce may be substituted for the wine, and a va- riety offered by employing anchovies instead of oysters.

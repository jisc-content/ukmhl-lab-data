451 CAKES, Chap, xxi.] eggs. When well beaten, add a glass of wine and some caraways. It must be beaten a full hour. Butter a pan, and bake it a full hour in a quick oven. The above proportions, leaving out four ounces of tlie butter, and the same of sugar, make a less luscious cake, and to most tastes a more pleasant one. SODA CAKE.—E. R. One pound of flour, one drachm of soda, half a pound of sugar, ditto of currants, and a quarter of a pound of butter. Mix the soda with the flour, then rub in the hutter, after which add the sugar and the currants, and then a pint of milk. Put it into the oven immediately. A variety may be given by substituting a quarter of a pound of lemon, 'orange, and citron, candied, and an ounce of pounded sweet almonds for the currants; but in that case the cake will require rather more soda. GINGERBREAD.—E. R. One pound of treacle, ditto of butter, two ])ounds of flour, one ounce of ground ginger, sliced candied orange, and a glass of brandy. If not intended to be rich, omit half the butter, the brandy, and lemon. ANOTHER SORT. To three-quarters of a pound of treacle beat one egg strained; mix four ounces of brown sugar, half an ounce of ginger sifted; of cloves, mace, allspice, and nutmeg, a quarter of an ounce, beaten as fine as possible; co- riander and caraway-seeds, each a quarter of an ounce; melt one pound of liutter, and mix with tlie above; and add as much flour as will knead into a pretty stiff paste; then roll it out, and cut into cakes. Bake on tin plates in a quick oven. A little time will bake them. Of some, drops may be made. 2 G 2

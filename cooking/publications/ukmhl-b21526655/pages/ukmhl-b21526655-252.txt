Stew the gizzards in a little water, with the trim- mings ; chop them very small, and chop the liver also. Make them into a forcemeat with grated ham, bread- crumbs, herbs, &c., and fill the pigeons with this force- meat rolled round the yolk of a hard-boiled egg. Put the pigeons into a stew'pan, with a little butter to brown them; add the gravy from the gizzards, a little flour, and an onion. Let them stew very gently, and then skim the gravy ; add to it a glass of A%dne, or sauce, and, having boiled up the gravy and thickened it, serve it with the pigeons. PIGEONS A LA FRANCAISE.—E. R.

Stew them till tender, then take them out, beat up the yolk of an egg with some oiled butter, brush the pigeons thickly, cover them well with bread-crumbs, let them cool a little, then repeat the process: put them into the oven just to brown, strain and thicken the gravy, and send them up.

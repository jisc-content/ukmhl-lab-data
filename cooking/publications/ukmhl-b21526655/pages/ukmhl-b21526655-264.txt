Raise common boiled crust into either a round or oval form, as you choose; have ready the trimmings and small bits of pork cut off when a hog is killed ; and if these are not enough, take the meat off a sweet bone. Beat it well with a rolling-pin, season with pepper and salt, and keep the fat and lean separate. Put it in layers, quite close up to the top; lay on the lid ; cut the edge smooth round, and pinch it; bake in a slow soaliing oven, as the meat is very solid.

If to be eaten hot, sausage-meat or fresh mush- rooms or oysters will be an improvement, in addition to the ham, eggs, and forcemeat-balls; and if cold, the small pickled mushrooms should be added, or a little mushroom-powder in the gravy.

VEAL AND OYSTER PIE.—E. R. Make a seasoning of pepper, salt, and a small quantity of grated lemon-peel. Cut some veal cutlets, and beat them until they are tender; spread over them a layer of pounded ham, and roll them round; then cover

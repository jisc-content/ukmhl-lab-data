Chaf. XI.] 207 PUDDINGS. MARLBOROUGH I’UDDING.—E. R. Cover the dish with a thin puff-paste, then take of candied citron, orange, and lemon peel, each one ounce; slice these sweetmeats very thin, and lay them all over the bottom of the dish; dissolve six ounces of butter w'ithout water; add six ounces of powdered sugar, and the yolks of four eggs beaten well; stir them over the fire until the mixture boils, then pour it on the sweet- meats, and bake the pudding three quarters of an hour in a moderate oven.

242 DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. xn. COU DE MOUTON A LA SAINTE MENEHOULD.—NECK OF MUTTON A LA SAINTE MENEHOULD. Order the narrow part of a neck of small mutton to be cut o£F before the sheep be divided, which leaves the two scrags united. Soak in warm water, then hang it two days; lay it in a stewpot, with slices of fat bacon over and under, two pounds of scrag of veal, three large carrots, three onions, a large bunch of sweet herbs, two bay-leaves, and a table-spoonful of whole white pepper : cover the whole with beef-broth, and simmer four hours. Drain the gravy from the meat, which cover on all sides with crumbs of bread, and brown it with a salamander. In the mean time boil the gravy, uncovered, very quickly, having strained it first, and serve in the dish : add salt. Serve in the dish endive, tomato, or spinach sauce. HACHEE DE MOUTON, AUX IIERBES FINES.—HASHED MUTTON WITH HERBS. Put into a casserole a good piece of butter, some finely- minced shalot, parsley, and half a pint of mushrooms; boil them gently in the butter; then, by degrees, mix in a large spoonful of flour, half a pint of broth, and stew till the flavour of all be obtained : let it become a little cool, then mince some underdone mutton in it, without boiling. ROGNONS DE MOUTON.—MUTTON KIDNEYS. With a very sharp knife cut mutton kidneys in the thinnest possible slices; flour, and fry quickly till they are quite crisp. While frying, add pepper and salt. Serve them in a good gravy, to which a bit of garlic has given a very slight flavour. COTELETTES AUX HARICOTS.—MUTTON STEAKS WITH FRENCH BEANS. Having dressed French beans as usual, drain the w'ater from them, and simmer them with pepper and salt in a good piece of butter. A few minutes before

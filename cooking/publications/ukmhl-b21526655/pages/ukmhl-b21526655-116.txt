DOMESTIC COOKEEY. [Chap. ii. 46 COD’S HEAD AND OYSTER-SAUCE.—E. R. Brown a bit of butter in a stewpan, dust it with flour to thicken the sauce; pour in some beef-soup, mince in an onion or two, and let the whole boil a little ; take half a hundred of oysters, or a quart of pickled mussels, with a considerable quantity of their liquor, stew altogether till quite ready, taking care to season the sauce with salt and pepper; meantime boil the cod in water, with a Httle salt. Serve in a deep dish, and pour the sauce over it. COD’S HEAD STUFFED.—E. R. Cut the head with a part of the shoulders, and take as much of the] tail as will fill the head, then tie it up both at the mouth and shoulders with packthread; make a brown sauce, as in the former recipe, add a little strong ale with the beef-soup, season it with a spoonful of ketchup, some salt, and cayenne pepper ; then put in the head and stew it over a slow fire. When ready add a glass of wine and a little lemon-juice. COD'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS Will eat much finer by having a little salt rubbed down the bone, and along the thick part, even if it be eaten the same day. Great care must be taken to serve it without the smallest speck of black or scum. Garnish with a large quantity of double parsley, lemon, horse-radish, cand the milt, roe, and liver, and fried smelts, if ap- proved. If with smelts, be careful that no water hangs about the fish, or the beauty of the smelts will be taken off, as well as their flavour. Serve with plenty of oyster or shrimp sauce, and anchovy-butter. When properly jirepared, lay the fish on a tin fish])late, and cover the whole with a cloth. Put it into cold hard water, with two handsful of salt, and two table-spoonsful of vinegar; let it heat gradually until it boils, then take it quite oft' the fire, and keep it closely covered in the water for an hour, near, but not on the fire, scarcely being allowed to simmer.

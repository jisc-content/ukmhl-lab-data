94 DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. hi. through; and epicures aver that it is one of the finest dishes that come to table. BOILED TURKEY.—E. R, Fill the body of the turkey with oysters, and let it boil by steam wdthout any w’ater. When sufficiently done, take it up, strain the gravy that will be found in the pan, and which, when cold, will be a fine jelly; thicken it with a little flour, add the liquor of the oysters intended for sauce, also stewed, and warm the oysters up in it. A fowl may be boiled in the same manner; and, if there should be no steam apparatus, a small one can be put in a jar and immersed in a kettle of water. Should a fowl or turkey prove of a bad colour, smother it in sauce, celery-sauce, or any white sauce. Pepper fowls and turkeys in the inside, and wffien roasted baste them well with butter. Obs. A small i.en-bird boils better than ^the larger sort, and may be stuffed in a variety of ways, with herbs like veal stuffing, or sausage-meat, or chestnuts and bacon, and it may be served up with celery-sauce, plain white sauce, or both. Boiled fowls should be very young and white legged to cook well. They should come to table very plump, and as delicate as possible. White sauce is the most fashionable accompaniment, the old method of dishing with parsley and butter being on the decline; but as parsley still maintains its ground with many people, it is iidvisable to boil OMSufficient quantity, press and chop it, garnishing the dish with small mounds thus prepared, which may be mi.\ed at table with the white sauce by the guests who like the flavour of parsley. Liver-sauce is sometimes served with boiled fowls. BOILED CHICKENS.—E. R. Chickens shoidd be plump, and very nicely boiled ; if wanted to be particularly good, they must be boiled in a hlanc. It is the fashion to send them up with tufts of cauliflower or white brocoli, divested of stem and leaves, and white sauce.

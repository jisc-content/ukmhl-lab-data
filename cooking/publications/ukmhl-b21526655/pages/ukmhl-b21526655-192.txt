IV. 112 DOMESTIC COOKERY. ham between ; cut some pickled cucumbers and mush- rooms into small pieces, with some sweet herbs well sea- soned ; strew them over the surface, then roll up the veal very tightly, tie it in a cloth, and let it stew gentlv for six hours. Then put a heavy weight upon it, and let it stand two days before it is cut; serve it in slices with savoury jelly ; any kind of boned game or fowl may be added. VEAL CUTLETS.—E. R. Some iiersons have deprecated the practice of beating meat, but it is essentially necessary in veal cutlets, which otherwise, especially if merely fried, are very in- digestible. They should be cut about three-quarters of an inch in thickness, and beaten until every fibre is separated j they will then, when fried, taste like sw^eet- bread, be (juite as tender, and nearly as rich. Manv cooks after frying the cutlets stew them in water boiled in the pan. CUTLETS A LA ITALIENNE.-E. R. Chop a quantity of sw-eet herbs, parsley being the pre- dominant ; melt a little butter on the fire and then warm the herbs in it; cut the cutlets into handsome shapes, brush them with the yolk of egg, then lay on the butter and herbs with a knife, and cover them w-ell with bread- crumbs; this process should be repeated ; fry them of a fine brown, if glazed ; they must be put between papers to press all the grease out, then brush them over witli the glaze, and send them to table. em’LETS WITH WHITE SAUCE—E. R. Cut thin slices of undressed veal, hack them w th the back of a knife each way, dip them in eggs and bread- crumbs, with a little chopped parsley ; frv them in butter, lay them on a sieve as they are done, and serve them with white sauce as for fricassee.

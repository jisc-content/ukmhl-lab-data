[Chap. xvii. 340 DOMESTIC COOKERY, foreign flavour may also be given to hams by pouring old strong beer over them, and burning juniper-wood M'hile they are drying; molasses, juniper-berries, and highly-flavoured herbs, such as basil, sage, bay-leaves, and thyme, mingled together, and the hams well rubbed with it, using only a sufficient quantity of salt to assist in the cure, will afford an agreeable variety. TO PICKLE PORK.—E. R. Take half a bushel of common salt, one pound of bay- salt, half a pound of saltpetre, and si.v pounds of coarse brown sugar ; make hams of the legs, according to the foregoing receipts. Take the sides of the pork and rub them well with common salt, lay a thin bed of salt in the tray, and place one of the sides in it; sprinkle Avith salt to cover it: lay the other side on the top, and sprinkle it also. Let them lie two or three days, rubbing the salt well in ; then cover the whole with the other ingredients, and as soon as the salt begins to give, rub them well in; turn the sides frequently, and let them be covered with brine : it will be fit for use in six or eight w'eeks. These quantities are for a pig of fifteen or sixteen score. MUTTON HAM.—E. R. Cut a hind quarter of mutton in the shape of a ham, and allow it to hang for two or three days. Mix half a pound of bay-salt, two ounces of saltpetre, half a pound of common salt, and half a pound of coarse sugar, all well pounded together, and make them quite hot over the fire. Then rub it well into the meat, turning it in the liquor every day ; after four days add two more ounces of common salt. Let it remain twelve days in the brine, then take it out, dry it, and hang it up in wood smoke for a week. Another pickle for mutton ham may be made with one ounce of saltpetre to a pound of coarse sugar, and one of salt; the ham kept in this pickle for a fortnight, then rolled in saw dust, and then hung in wood smoke for fourteen days longer.

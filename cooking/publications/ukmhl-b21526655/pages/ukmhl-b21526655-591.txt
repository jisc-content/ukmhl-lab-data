511 Chap, xxiv.] BUTTERMILK. BUTTERMILK, WITH BREAD OR WITHOUT. It is most wliolesome when sour, as being less likely to be heavy ; but most agreeable when made of sweet cream. DR. BOERIIAAVE’S SWEET BUTTERMILK. Take the milk from the cow into a small churn, of about six shillings price; in about ten minutes begin churning, and continue till the flakes of butter swim about pretty thick, and the milk is discharged of all the greasy particles, and appears thin and blue. Strain it through a sieve, and drink it as frequently as possible. It should form the whole of the patient’s drink, and the food should be biscuits and rusks in every way and sort; ripe and dried fruits of various kinds when a decline is apprehended. Baked and dried fruits, raisins in particular, make excellent suppers for invalids, with biscuits or common cake. ORGEAT. Beat two ounces of almonds, wdth a tea-spoonful of orange-flower w'ater, and a bitter almond or two : then pour a quart of milk and water to the paste. Sweeten wuth sugar or capillaire. This is a fine drink for those who have a tender chest; and in the gout it is highly useful, and with the addition of half an ounce of gum arabic has been found to allay the painfulness of the at- tendant heat. Half a glass of brandy may be added if thought too cooling in the latter complaints, and the glass of orgeat may be put into a basin of warm water. ORANGEADE OR LEMONADE. Squeeze the juice, pour boiling water on a little of the peel, and cover close. Boil water and sugar to a thin syrup, and skim it. When all are cold, mix the juice, the infusion, and the syrup, with as much more water as will make a rich sherbet; strain through a jelly- bag. Or squeeze the juice, and strain it, and add water and capillaire.

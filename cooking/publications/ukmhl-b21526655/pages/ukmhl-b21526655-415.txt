Season with mace, nutmeg, white pep- per, salt, and a clove or two, in the finest powder. Lay a little fine butter at the bottom of the pan, and the lob- ster smooth over it, with bay-leaves between; cover it with butter, and bake gently. When done, pour the whole on the bottom of a sieve, and with a fork lay the pieces into potting-pots, some of each sort with the sea- soning about it.

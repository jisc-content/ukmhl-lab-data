ROLLED CHERRIES, WHICH TASTE AS IF DONE IN BRANDY. To every three pounds of morella cherries put one pound of double-refined sugar, sifted in layers, in a large stone jar or smarll keg. Stop it perfectly close, and roll the jar to and fro for a short time every day for six weeks. Keep them in a cool place. CHERRIES FOR TARTS AND PUDDINGS.—E. R.

Then take out the tomatos, add sugar to the syrup, boiling it down until it is very strong, and of a good consistence. Pour it boiling over the tomatos, and let them remain in it until cold. Then rc])eat the process as often as appears necessary, but not sufficiently so to make them shrink. Should they be preserved ripe, pour the boiling syrup upon them, repeating it every two or three days until the sugar has completely penetrated the fruit. The addition of lemdn-juice squeezed upon the tomatos, and a third or fourth part of strawberry-jam mi.xed with the syrup, will assist in the resemblance of the tomato to the guava, as will also a glass of port wine] but, as these would spoil the

SOUPS. 29 Chap, i.] into a stewpan, vith half a pound of bacon or ham, four carrots, and as many turnips sliced, a large onion, and a head of celery. Put the meat at the bottom and the roots over it, with two blades of mace and twelve peppercorns. Cover the pan close, and let it stew till the gravy is out and the roots tender. Then cover them with broth, adding a tea-cupful of whole rice. Stew all together for four hours, then work the soup well through a sieve. Before serving, put half a pint of good cream, but do not boil it; vermicelli may also be added. This soup is not white, but of a brownish colour, and very good. VEGETABLE SOUP.—E. R. Boil a quantity of yellow peas, haricots, or lentils in wnter, till they are quite tender, press them gradually through a sieve with the water, working the mixture with a wooden spoon, (to make what the French call a puree,) rendering it sufficiently liquid to bear 1 iling down. Then cut a good quantity of fresh vegetables, of any or all kinds in season, especially carrots, turnips, celery, spinach, with always a few onions, into fine shreds, and throw them into boiling water for two or three minutes to blanch them ; take them out with a strainer, mix them with the peas, and boil the whole gradually for at least two hours. A few minutes before the soup is taken from the fire, season it with salt and pepper; while the soup is simmering it should be stirred frequently, to prevent its sticking to the sides of the pan, or casserole, and acquiring a singed taste. PALESTINE SOUP.—E. R. Take the broth which a neck of mutton has been boiled in ; put into a saucepan three or four sliced pota- toes, two or three onions sliced, and some Jerusalem artichokes, sufficient to make the soup of the thickness of good pea-soup. Boil the whole well together, and rub it through a fine sieve; add salt and white jiepper.

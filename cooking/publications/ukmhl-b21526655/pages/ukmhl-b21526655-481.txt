PRESERVES. 401 Chap. xix. them hoil about a quarter of an hour, and, while yet warm, put them with the syrup in pots. TO PRESERVE STRAW'BERRIES WHOLE.—E. R.' To a pound of picked fruit add three-quarters of a pound of grated lump-sugar. Lay it upon the fruit, and let it remain until the next day ; then put them into a preserving-pan, and simmer very gently till the fruit is soft, being careful not to break it; then take out the strawberries, and boil the syrup until it appears to be rich. Wait until it is cold, and then put it upon the fruit. A RICH WAY OF PRESERVING STRAWBERRIES.—E. R. In picking the strawberries reserve the largest kinds; then boil the smaller ones, allowing three-quarters of a pound of fine sugar to a pound of fruit; stir it while boiling, and make it into jam. Then make a fine syrup of sugar, and boil the larger strawberries in it, taking great care that they should be kept separate, and not break. Take them out, and put them into small pre- serving-pots ; then boil the syrup and the jam together until it is very rich, or make it into a jelly by straining it, and pour it on the strawberries when nearly cold. •ANOTHER WAY TO PRESERVE STRAWBERRIES WHOLE. Take equal weights of the fruit and double-refined sugar ; lay the former in a large dish, and sprinkle half the sugar in fine powder over; give a gentle shake to the dish, that the sugar may touch the under side of the fruit. Next day make a thin syrup with the remainder of the sugar, and, instead of water, allow one pint of red currant-juice to every pound of strawberries; in this simmer them until sufficiently jellied. Choose the largest scarlets, or others, when not dead ripe. In either of the above ways, they eat well served in thin cream in glasses. 2 D

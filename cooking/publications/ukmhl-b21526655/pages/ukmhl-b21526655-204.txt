124 DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. v. dish may be simplified by a more common forcemeat, while the gravy in which the beef is stewed may he made by pouring boiling water into the frying-pan after the fat has been removed. STEWED BEEF-STEAK.—E. R. Put the steak into a stewpan with a lump of butter, over a slow fire, and turn it until the butter has be- come a fine white gravy, then pour it into a basin, and put more butter to the steak. When the steak is nicely done, take it out, return all the gravy into the stewpan, and fry the steak ; then add it to the gravy in the stew- pan, with a table-spoonful of wine, and a shalot finely sliced ; stew it for ten minutes, and serve it up. A more simple way is to fry the steak merely at first, then put it into half a pint of water, an onion sliced, a spoon- ful of walnut-ketchup, pepper and salt, cover it close, thicken it with flour and butter, and serve it up very hot. BEEF-STEAK STEWED WITH OYSTERS.—E. R. Cut the steak leather thick, brown it in a stewpan with butter, and a little water. Add half a pint of water, an onion sliced, pepper and salt, cover the pan close, and let it stew very slowly for an hour; then add a glass of port wine, a little flour, and a dozen or two of oysters, their liquor having been previously strained and put into the stewpan. Beef-steak, with cucumbers instead of oysters, may be dressed the same way; the cucumbers to be stewed separately in a little gravy or broth, and added to the beef five minutes before serving ; fr}’ the cucumbers and stew them in the water poured into the pan after the fat is poured off; if stewed with the steak they will make it hard. BEEFSTEAK A-LA-MAGICIENNE.—E. R. The culinary utensil here employed is a conjurer, a simple apparatus made of iron or tin, with a lid that shuts down so closely that the rarefied air cannot escape.

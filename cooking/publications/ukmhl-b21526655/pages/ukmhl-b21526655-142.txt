Prepare the turtle according to the excellent directions of Mrs. Rundell, and then selecting the coarser portions, stew them down into soup with a hunch of seasoning herbs, onions, and pepper and salt. If there should be any eggs in the turtle, let them stew in the soup for four hours; strain and thicken the soup, and serve it up with the entrails cut into small pieces, a proportion of the finer parts, and also the green fat, all cut into small pieces. The juice of half a lemon and two glasses of Madeira, merely warmed up in the soup, are the proportions for three pints. The coarse part and entrails will take six hours stewing to make the soup; the fine parts two hours, and the green fat one. The callapee is made of the fine parts cut small, stewed or baked, and served up with a portion of the soup reduced to a very thick gravy, with small eggs, forcemeat-balls, and slices of lemon.

The process of roasting appears to be of easy attain- ment ; but, in order to be properly accomplished, it requires considerable care and attention on the part of the cook. In ordinary roasting, a quarter of an-hour is allowed to every pound of meat: but pork and young meat, such as veal and lamb, require twenty minutes; and in frosty weather, beef and mutton will take the same time, in order to be thoroughly done. All roasted meat should be put down at first at a very considerable distance from the fire, and brought gradually closer as it becomes heated through; this method preventing the outer parts from being scorched before the centre is done.

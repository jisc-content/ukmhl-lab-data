65 Chap, ii.] FISH. TO STEW CARP OR TENCH.—E. R. Clean the fish thoroughly, and dry them well on a cloth, dredge them with flour, and fry them of a light colour; then put them into a stewpan, with equal parts of red wine and water, a table-spoonfiil of lemon-pickle, the same of walnut-ketchup, a tea-spoonful of mush- room-pow'der, and a little cayenne pepper; add a large onion stuck with cloves, and a stick of horse-radish. Cover the pan closely to keep in the steam, and let the contents stew' over a stove very gently until the gravy is reduced to a sufficient quantity only to cover the fish : then take up the fish, strain the gravy, thicken it, and add it to the fish. WATER SOUCHY.—E. R. Take a part of the fish, either perch or flounders, or any other fresh-water fish intended to be cooked ; stew' it down in two quarts of water, some parsley, or parsley- roots, and then pulp them through a sieve. Put the remainder of the fish into the liquor with more pars- ley chopped, and parsley-roots, a little pepper and salt, serve it in a tureen, and send up a plate of brown bread and butter with it. Perch and all of fresh-water fish may be fried in batter. MUSSELS.—E. R. This fish is more frequently eaten on the Continent than at English tables of a certain grade. In Prance they are skewered upon a small skewer, dipped into a thick batter and fried. They are also boiled or stewed in the following manner : open them, put them into a pan with their own liquor, to which add a large onion, and some parsley, w'ith a couple of table-spoonsful of vinegar ; roll a piece of butter in flour, beat an egg, and add it to the gravy, warming the whole up very gradually.

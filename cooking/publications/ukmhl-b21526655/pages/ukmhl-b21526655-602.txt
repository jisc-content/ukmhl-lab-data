Stains of Wine, Fruit, after they have been long in the linen.—Rub the part on each side with yellow soap. Then lay on a mixture of starch in cold water very thick; rub it well in, and expose the linen to the sun and air till the stain comes out. If not removed in three or four days, rub that off and renew the process. When dry it may be sprinkled with a little water. Many other stains may be taken out by dipping the linen in sour buttermilk, and drying in a hot sun. Then wash it in cold water, and dry it, two or three times a-day. Iron-moulds should be wetted, then laid on a hot water-plate, and a little essential salt of lemons put on the part. If the linen becomes dry, wet it, and renew the process; observing that the plate is kept boiling hot. Much of the powder sold under the name of salt of lemons is a spurious preparation; and therefore it is necessary to dip the linen in a good deal of water, and wash it as soon as the stain is removed, to prevent the part from being worn into holes by the acid. To take out Mildew.—Mix soft soap with starch powdered, half as much salt, and the juice of a lemon; lay it on the part on both sides with a painter’s brush. Let it lie on the grass day and night till the stain comes out. TO MAKE FLANNELS KEEP THEIR COLOUR AND NOT SHRINK. Put them into a pail, and pour boiling water on, letting them lie till cold, the first time of washing. TO PRESERVE FURS AND M'OOLLEN FROM MOTHS. Let the former be occasionally combed, ■while in use, and the latter be brushed and shaken. Wlien not wanted, dry them first, let them be cool, then mix among them bitter apples from the apothecary’s in small muslin bags, sewing them in several folds of linen, carefully turned in at the edges, and keep from damp.

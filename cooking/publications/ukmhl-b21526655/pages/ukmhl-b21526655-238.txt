DOMESTIC COOKERY. 158 [Chap. viii. MOCK BR.YM'N. Split and nicely clean a hog’s head, take out the brains, cut off the ears, and rub a good deal of salt into the head; let it drain twenty-four hours ; then lay upon it two ounces of saltpetre, and the same of common salt; in three days’ time lay the head and salt into a pan, with just water to cover it, for two days more. Wash it well; and boil until the bones Avill come out; remove them, and chop the meat as quick as possible, in pieces of an inch long; but first take the skin care- fully off the head and the tongue, the latter cut in bits as above. Season with pepper and salt. Put the skin of one side of the head into a small long pan, press the chopped head and tongue into it, and lay the skin of the other side of the head over, and press it down. Wlien cold, it will turn out, and make a kind of brawn. The head may probably be too fat, in which case prepare a few bits of lean pork with the head. Boil two ounces of salt, a pint of vinegar, and a quart of the liquor, and, when cold, pour it over the head. The ears are to be boiled longer than the head, cut in thin strips, and di- vided about it, the hair being nicely removed. Reboil the pickle often. ANOTHER MOCK BRAWN. Boil a pair of neats’ feet very tender; take the meat off, and have ready the belly-j)iece of pork, salted with common salt and saltpetre for a week. Boil this almost enough ; take out the bones, and roll the feet and the pork together. Then roll it very tight with a strong cloth and coarse tape. Boil it till very tender, then hang it up in the cloth till cold ; after which keep it in a sousing liquor, as is directed in the next page. TO COLLAR PIG'S HEAD. Scour the head and cars nicely; take off the hair and snout, and take out the eyes and the brains; lay it into water one night; then drain, salt it extremely well with

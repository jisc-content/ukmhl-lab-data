PICKLING. 345 Chap, xvii.] mace. Use only as much as will suffice to rub the beef all over; then add three ounces of common salt and a quarter of a pound of coarse sugar; let the beef remain a fortnight in this pickle, turning it and rubbing it every day: then take it out, cover it with the spices and chopped sweet herbs, roll it very tight, tie it with tape, put it into a pan with half a pint of water and half a pound of suet. Bake it after the bread has been drawn for si.x hours; put a heavy weight upon it, and when cold take off the tape. There will be a fine jelly at the bottom of the pan, which should be cleared from fat, and mixed with an equal portion of jelly from an ox-foot, as it will be too salt to eat alone, or it may be used in soups The brisket of beef may be cured the same way : remove the bones, which will easily slip out when it comes from the oven, and put a heavy weight upon it to press the fat and lean well in together. If well managed the beef will be as rich and as tender as marrow, but a larger quantity of salt or saltpetre would make it hard. TO SALT BEEF RED; WHICH IS EXTREMELY GOOD TO EAT FRESH FROM THE PICKLE, OR TO HANG TO DRY. Choose a piece of beef with as little bone as you can, (the flank is most proper,) sprinkle it, and let it drain a day; then rub it with common salt, saltpetre, and bay- salt, but only a small proportion of the saltpetre, and you may add a few grains of cochineal, all in fine pow'- der. Rub the pickle every day into the meat for a week, then only turn it. It will be excellent in eight days. In sixteen, drain it from the pickle; and let it be smoked at the oven’s mouth when heated with wood, or send it to the baker’s. A few days will smoke it. x\ little of the coarsest sugar may be added to the salt. It eats well boiled tender with greens or carrots. If to be grated as Dutch, then cut a /ean bit, boil it till

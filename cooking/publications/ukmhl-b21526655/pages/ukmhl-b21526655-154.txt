DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. hi. 78 part that has been struck always hunts: therefore do not purchase these joints if bruised. AU meat should be carefully examined, and wiped with a dry cloth as soon as it comes in ] and if flies have blown upon it, the part must be cut off. This should be daily observed until it is dressed, as it not only tends to preserve the meat long in perfection, but prevents that musty flavour too often perceived in the outer slices, when brought to table. In the country, where meat is often carried a great distance, it should be well covered with a cloth, over which fresh cabbage-leaves would keep it cool. These cautions are more needful, as in some families great loss is sustained by the spoiling of meat. The fly may in some measure be prevented by dusting, upon the parts most likely to be attacked, pepper and ginger mixed after xviping, which should never be omitted. Pieces of charcoal laid about meat preserve it from putrefaction, and recover what is spoiling. All legs and shoulders of meat should hang with the knuckle down- wards, which will cause the gravy to be retained. When sirloins of beef, or loins of veal or mutton, come in, part of the suet may be cut off for puddings, or to clarify. If there be more suet than will be used while fresh, throw it into pickle, made in the proportion of a quarter of a pound of salt to a quart of cold water, and it will be as good afterwards for any use, when soaked a little. Dripping, or clarified suet, will baste everything as well as butter, except fowls and game ; and for kitchen pies nothing else should be used. The fat of a neck or loin of mutton makes a far lighter and much richer pudding than suet. If the weather permit, meat eats much better for hang- ing a day before it is salted. Meats become more tender, and consequently more digestible, as well as better flavoured, by hanging ; but veal and lamb will not bear it so long as the flesh of older animals.

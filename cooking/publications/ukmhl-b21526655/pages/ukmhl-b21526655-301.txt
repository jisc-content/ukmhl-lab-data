PUDDINGS. Chap, xi.] 221 The broMTi sugar adds greatly to the richness of the pudding, which, made in this way, is not expensive. CHARLOTTE DE POMMES E. R. Rub a dish very thickly with butter, then cut as many slices of white bread as will cover the bottom and line the sides; then cut apples in thin slices, and place them in layers, with sugar and butter between. In the mean time, soak as many thin slices of bread as will cover the whole; lay a plate and a weight on the top to press the bread close upon the apples. Bake it slowly for three hours. A moderately-sized dish will take half a pound of butter to make the whole. CHARTREUSE OF APPLES AND RICE.—E. R. Boil six ounces of rice with a stick of cinnamon in milk until it is thick, stirring in a spoonful of rose-water, or orange-flower water. Pare six or seven large apples —golden pippins are the best—scoop out the core, and fill up the orifice with raspberry jam. Border a deep dish with paste; put in the apples, leaving a space between, and fill it up with the rice. Brush the whole over with the yolk of an egg, and sift sugar thickly over it; form a pattern on the top with sweetmeats, and bake it for an hour in a quick oven. MIROTON OF APPLES.—E. R. Scald the apples, reduce them to a pulp, and pile them high upon the dish in which they are to be served ; boil a tea-spoonful of grated lemon-peel, and six or eight lumps of sugar, in a tea-cupful of water; then add the yolks of three eggs and the white of one, half an ounce of butter, a spoonful of flour, and one of brandy; mix the whole together over the fire, and stir it till quite smooth. Pour it upon the apples, then whisk the whites of the other two eggs to a froth ; put them over the miroton just as it is going into the oven, and sift some sugar over it. The oven must be slow : it will take ten or fifteen minutes to bake.

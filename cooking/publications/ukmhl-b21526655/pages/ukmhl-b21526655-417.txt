PICKLING. Chap, xvii.] 331 hours and a half to five hours, according to its size. It is best to allow time enough, as it is easy to take up the ham when done, and keep it hot over boiling water, covered closely. Take off the skin as whole as you can, as it keeps the cold ham moist. Strew raspings over the ham, and garnish with carrot sliced. It should be carefully pared, before boiling, to remove the rusty parts. If some cloves, bay and laurel leaves, and a bunch of herbs be boiled with a ham, it will have a fine flavour. If to be braised, cover it well with meat in slices, over and under, and put in roots and spices. The water, with which it is to be completely covered to dress it, will be an excellent addition for brown sauce or soups, instead of plain water. FITZ.SIMON FAMILY RECEIPT FOR CURING IIAMS.-E. R.

Let it lie for a month in this pickle, turning and basting it every day; then hang it in wood smoke in a dry place, where no heat can come to it, and, if to be kept long, hang it for a month or two in a damp place, and it will eat firm and short. Observe, hams thus made need not be soaked; put them into cold water, and let them be three or four hours before they boil, skimming the pot well and often, until it boils. These hams have been made in the family with a less quantity of salt, and an additional quantity of saltpetre, and it has been found to answer well, the hams being in that case soaked before boiling. HAMS IN SWEET WORT.-E. R. Rub every ham with half a pound of coarse sugar and four ounces of saltpetre ; let them lie one night; then salt them with an equal quantity of bay-salt and Cv..‚Äù- mon salt, and turn them every day for a fortnight, rub- bing them with the salt that lies at the bottom of the pan; then steep them for three days in cold sw'eet ale z

10 DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. i. boil it very gently, and then pass the soup through a sieve, thickening it afterwards with a pint of cream and one egg. This soup may be made of the liquor in which a calf’s-head has been boiled, after it has been stewed down with the bones taken out of the head: strain the liquor off, and when placed again upon the fire, add to it a few ounces of vermicelli, and, just be- fore it is taken up, a half pint of cream. ANOTHER WHITE SOUP.—E. R. V Take two quarts of the stock, and boil the crumb of a roll in a gill of milk, beat the yolks of six hard-boiled eggs with three ounces of almonds very well in a mor- tar, with a little cayenne pepper, and add the whole to the soup: it may be poured over slices of French roll sent up in the tureen. White soup may be varied with rice : wash two or three ounces of the best kind, blanch it in boiling water, and drain it, add the rice to the soup, and let it stew until it swells. If the stock has been made with fowl, take out the white portion when well stewed, pound the meat in a mortar and add it to the soup. It is the fashion now to send up grated Parmesan cheese with white soup. SOUP A LA .TULIENNE.-E. R. Cut various kinds of vegetables in pieces, celery, car- rots, turnips, leeks, and onions, and having put two ounces of butter in the bottom of a stewpan, put the vegetables on the top of the butter, together with any others that may be in season ; stew or fiy them over a slow fire, keeping them stirred, and adding a little of the stock occasionally ; soak small pieces of crust of bread about the size of shillings or half-croMms, in the remainder of the broth or stock, and when the vege- tables are nearly stewed, add them, and warm the ■whole up together.

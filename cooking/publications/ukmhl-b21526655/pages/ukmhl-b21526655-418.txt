They need not be eaten for three months ; and if the hams are large they should lie in the salt three weeks : eight ounces of common and eight of bay salt are the proportion for each ham. TO PICKLE A IIAM.—E. R. Take a pound of common salt, half a pound of bay- salt, the same quantity of saltpetre, a pound of coarse sugar or treacle, a pint of old ale, and a pint of vinegar. Boil them all together, and put them hot on the ham; then let it remain a month in the pickle, being careful to turn it every day. PLAIN PICKLE FOR HAMS.—E. R. Take one pound of coarse sugar, one ounce of salt- petre, one ounce of bay-salt, one pound and three- quarters of common salt, and bruise them well together ; then boil them in a gallon of water for ten minutes, skimming it well. Beat the hams, and when the pickle is cold, put them in, turning them every day for three weeks. This is the quantity for one large ham; dry them in wood smoke. ANOTHER WAY. Hang the ham, and sprinkle it with salt; then rub it every day with the following, in fine powder : half a pound of common salt, the same quantity of bay-salt, two ounces of saltpetre, and two ounces of black pepper, mixed with a pound and a half of treacle. Turn it twice a-day in the pickle, for three weeks. Lay it into a pail of water for one night, wipe it quite dry, and smoke it two or three weeks. ANOTHER WAY, THAT GIVES A HIGHER FLAVOUR. When the weather will permit, hang the ham three days; mix an ounce of saltpetre with a quarter of a pound of bay-salt, the same quantity of common salt.

55 Chap, ii.] FISH. in yolks of eggs, dipped in minced parsley and crumbs of bread, and boiled until brown. EELS SPITCHCOCKED—E. R. Bruise together a small quantity of cloves, mace, nutmeg, salt, and pepper, and rub it over the fish, either cut in lengths or rolled round ; put it into a stewpan with half a pint of cider, a cupful of good gravy, one anchovy, a glass of port wine, a whole onion, some scraped horse-radish, a bunch of sweet herbs, and a little lemon- peel ; when sufficiently stewed, strain the sauce, and thicken it with a little butter or cream. A [good thick- ening may be made by melting a piece of butter the size of a walnut, rolled in half a tea-spoonful of flour in a little milk. TO STEW EELS.—E. R. Cut the eels in pieces, fry them a little until they are a fine brown ; let them remain until cold: take an onion, a little parsley, a leaf of sage chopped very finely; put them in some gravy, with a clove, a blade of mace, pepper and salt. Stew the eels until they are tender; then add a glass of port wine, and a little lemon-juice, after straining the sauce and thickening it with butter and flour. FRIED EELS.—E. R. “ Eels,” observes a great authority, “ require to be well majiaged by a clever cook, when the fat and indi- gestive qualities disappear, and the food becomes whole- some.” Simple frying is not, perhaps, the best means of effecting this object, but it is a favourite method with many persons. They are to be rolled in yolks of eggs and bread-crumbs, or a thick coating of sweet herbs may be added as a corrective : they should be seiwed with an acid sauce, or eaten with lemon-juice squeezed over them.

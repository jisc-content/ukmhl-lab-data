224 DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XI. CREAM PUDDING. Boil a quart of cream, with a blade of mace, three cloves, and half a nutmeg grated; and let it stand to cool. Beat eight eggs, but only three whites; strain, and mix them with a spoonful of the finest flour, a quarter of a pound of almonds blanched and beaten fine, with a spoonful of orange-flower or rose-water. Mix these by degrees in the cream, and stir all well together. Take a thick cloth, wet and flour it well; pour in the mixture, tie it close, and plunge it into boil- ing water. Keep it boiling half an hour very fast. When done, turn it carefully on a dish, strew fine sugar upon it, and serve pudding-sauce round. LECHE CREMA.â€”E. R. Beat up three eggs, leaving out two of the whites, and add to them gradually a pint and a half of milk; then mix very carefully four table spoonsful of fine wheat flour, and two ounces of finely-powdered loaf-sugar, with grated lemon peel to give a flavour. Boil these ingredients over a slow fire, stirring constantly to pre- vent burning, until the flour is quite dissolved. Prepare a shallow dish with some ratafia cakes at the bottom, and when the crema is sufficiently boiled, pour it through a sieve upon the cakes. N.B. This delicious dish is always served up to table cold: just before send- ing up, some finely-powdered cinnamon should be dusted pretty thickly over it. This receipt was obtained from the nuns of Santa Clara convent, at Palmas, in the island of Grand Canary. EVE'S PUDDING. Grate three quarters of a pound of bread ; mix it with the same quantity of shred suet, the same of apples and iilso of currants; mix w'ith these the whole of four eggs, and the rind of half a lemon shred fine. Put it into a shape; boil three hours, and serve w ith pudding- sauce, the juice of half a lemon, and a little nutmeg.

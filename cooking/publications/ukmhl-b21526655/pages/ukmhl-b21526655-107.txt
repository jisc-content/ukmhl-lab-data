Chap, ii.] FISH. 31 Cod.—The gills should be very red ; the fish should be very thick at the neck, the flesh white and firm, and the eyes fresh. When flabby, they are not good. Thev are in season from the beginning of October till the end of April. Skate, if good, is very white and thick. If too fresh, they eat tough, but must not be kept above two days. Herrings.—If good their gills are of a fine red, and the eyes bright; as is likewise the whole fish, which must be stiff and firm. Choose sprats by the same rules. Soles.—If good, they are thick, and the belly is of a cream-colour: if this is of a bluish cast and flabby, they are not fresh.

The best are taken in rivers: they are a very dry fish, and are much indebted to stuffing and sauce. Carp live some time out of water, and may therefore get wasted : it is best to kill them as soon as caught, to prevent this; but if too many are taken fronr the stew for present use, they may be fed with bread and kept in a large tub. The same signs of freshness attend them as other fish. Tench.—They are a fine-flavoured fresh-water fish, and should be killed and dressed as soon as caught. When they are to be bought, examine whether the gills are red and hard to open, the eyes bright, and the body stiff’. The tench has a slimy matter about it, the clearness and brightness of which show freshness. The season is July, August, and September. Perch.—Take the general rules given to distinguish

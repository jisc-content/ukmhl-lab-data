Put the whole into a deep pan ; mill it steadily with a chocolate-mill until it will stand up in it; then take off the top carefully, fill the glasses, mill again until it becomes thick.

Whip together a quart of very thick scalded cream, a quart of raw cream, the grated rind of four lemons, and the strained juice, with ten ounces of white powdered sugar, one hour ; then add half a pint of sweet wine, and continue to whisk it until it becomes quite solid. Lay a piece of muslin in a sieve, and lade the cream upon it with a spoon. In twenty hours turn it carefully

Put the fruit into an ice-pot that shuts very close; throw the sugar over it, and then cover the fruit with brandy. Between the top and cover of the pot put a piece of double cap-paper. Set the pot into a saucepan of water till the brandy be as hot as you can possibly bear to put your finger in, hut it must not boil. Put the fruit into a jar, and pour the brandy on it. When cold, put a blad- der over, and tie it down tight. ANOTHER RECEIPT FOR PEACHES OR APRICOTS PRESERVED IN BRANDY.â€”E. R. Take fourteen pounds of loaf-sugar, clarify it, and make a light syrup of it; then put half in an earthen pan, and the other half in the brass preserving-pan upon the fire ; skim it well, and, when it begins to boil, put the peaches, which must he ripe, one by one into it; turn them with a spoon so that they may all boil equally ; press them a little to discover whether^.they are rather soft, and, as they become so, take th4m out, and put them into the earthen pan Avith the other half of the sugar; then take* them out, put them in jars, and pour brandy upon them to harden them ; then put the brass pan upon the fire again with a little more than a pint of water to make the syrup thinner, and when it begins to boil put in more peaches as before, until all, to the amount of a hundred, are boiled, the syrup being suf- ficient for that number. When the whole have been put into jars, mix the syrup from the earthen pan with that in the preserving-pan, and boil it until it becomes as thick as a conserve; then take it off the fire, and put to it rather more than a pint of brandy, stirring it well together, and boiling to syrup; then pour out the brandy in which the peaches w'ere put; measure it, and put an equal quantity of syrup to it; mix both ,vell together, and fill up the jars.

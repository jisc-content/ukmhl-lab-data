When cold, fold it in a sheet of paper, and it will keep in a dry place two or three months, ready for serving on bread and butter. THE DUTCH WAY TO SALT BEEF. Take a lean piece of beef, rub it well with treacle or brown sugar, and turn it often. In three days wipe it, and salt it with common salt and saltpetre beaten fine ; rub these well in, and turn it every day for a fortnight. Roll it tight in a coarse cloth, and press it under a heavy weight; hang to dry in wood smoke, but turn it upside down every day. Boil it in pump-water, and press it: it will grate or cut into shivers, like Dutch beef. To twelve pounds of beef, the proportion of common salt is one pound. LEICESTERSHIRE SPICED BEEF. Take a round of beef, rub in a quarter of a pound of saltjjetre finely pounded; let it stand a day, then season it with half a pound of bay-salt, an ounce of black pepper, the same of allspice, both pounded. Let it lie in the pickle a month, turning it every day, and adding about three times a-week a small quantity of common salt. Then wash off the salt and spice; cut some fat bacon about a quarter of an inch square, and long enough to penetrate the beef; roll them in spices, half an ounce of mace, three large nutmegs, a tea-spoonful of cayenne, and the same of black pepper, pounded; lard the beef with the bacon, and a green stuffing made of chopped herbs. Put the beef into a pan deep enough to hold it; lay a great quantity of beef suet at the bottom of the pan, and also on the top of the beef. Tie the beef round with tape, to preserve its shape, before it is put into the pan; cover the pan first with brown paper, then with paste made of barley-flour, and another paper on the top. Put it into a quick oven, and bake it seven or eight hours. Pour off the fat and gravy, and let it be cold before it is cut.

[Chap. xxiv. 524 DOMESTIC COOKERY. TO DYE WHITE GLOVES A BEAUTIFUL PURPLE. Boil four ounces of logwood, and two ounces of .roche alum, in three pints of soft water till half -svasted. Let it stand to be cold after straining. Let the gloves be nicely mended; then do them over with a brush, and when dry repeat it. Twice is sufficient, unless the co- lour is to be very dark. When dry, rub off the loose d}^e with a coarse cloth. Beat up the white of an egg, and with a sponge rub it over the leather. The dye will stain the hands, but wetting them with vinegar will take it off before they are washed. A LIQUOR TO WASH OLD DEEDS, &c., ON PAPER OR PARCH- MENT, WHEN THE WRITING IS OBLITERATED, OR, WHEN SUNK, TO MAKE IT LEGIBLE. Take five or six galls, bruise them, and put them into a pint of strong white wine; let it stand in the sun two days. Then dip a brush into the wine, and wash the part of the writing which is sunk; and by the colour you will see whether it is strong enough of the galls. TO PREVENT THE ROT IN SHEEP. Keep them in the pens till the dew is off the grass. TO PREVENT GREEN H.YY FROM FIRING. Stuff a sack as full of straw or hay as possible; tie the mouth with a cord, and make the rick round the sack, drawing it up as the rick advances in height, and quite out when finished. The funnel thus left in the centre preserves it. TO PRESERVE A GRANARY FROM INSECTS AND WEASEIâ€žS. IMake the floor of Lombardy poplars. TO DESTROY CRICKETS. Put Scotch snuff upon the holes where they come out.

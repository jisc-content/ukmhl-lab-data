SOUPS. 11 Chap. i.J MOCK-TURTLE SOUP.—E. R. Take a calfs-head with the skin on, and about two pounds of very delicate pickled pork, the part, with- out hones, that is chiefly fat. The head must be very well cleaned and soaked ; wash the salt from tlie pork and soak it likewise in lukewarm water; put both into a soup-kettle, with two onions, a bundle of sweet herbs, two sticks of celery, pepper, and pounded mace; fill the kettle with water, and boil very gently till the meat is tender; take out the head and the pork, separate the meat from the bones, and return the latter into the soup. Let it stew for some hours longer: when cold take ofi' the fat, strain the soup, and thicken it; add half or three-quarters of a pint of white wine, the juice of a lemon, or two glasses of Harvey’s sauce; cut the meat of half the head into pieces and that of t.he pork also, and warm it up in the soup, together with egg-balls, and forcemeat ditto. The pork will be found a most acceptable addition, improving the flavour of the soup, and affording a substitute for the fat of the turtle. The remaining portion, with the other half of the calf’s head, should be rolled according to the directions given in a future page. Half a calf’s-head is quite sufficient tc^ make mock-turtle soup for a party; but as it cannot always be had with the skin on, the receipt is given for the whole. N.B. Though calves’-heads with the skin on bear a higher price than those without it, they go farther : there is no economy in purchasing the inferior article: the tongue should be cured for use, and a very nice dish may be made of the brains. MOCK-TURTLE. Bespeak a calf’s-head with the skin on, cut it in half, and clean it well ; then half boil it; take all the meat off in square bits, break the bones of the head, and boil them in some veal and beef broth to add to the richness.

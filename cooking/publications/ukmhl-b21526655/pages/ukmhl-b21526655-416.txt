336 DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. xvii. CHAPTER XVII. SALTING AND PICKLING. When the pork is ready for salting, it should he sprinkled with a handful of common salt to fetch out the blood: the brine thrown away on the following day, and the meat wiped with a dry cloth. Hams should be laid with the rind-side downwards; and it is a good plan to heat a cpiarter of a peck of common salt in a fryingpan and lay it at the bottom of the pan. A small quantity of saltpetre is necessary to produce the fine red colour eitlier of ham or beefj but much will make the meat hard, and the proportions of sugar and salt should be varied according to the preference given to highly-salted provisions, or those which are cured with a milder sub- stitute.

Send it to the oven in a deep pan, v ith half a pound of suet at the bottom and half a pint of water.â€”E. R. TO DRESS HAMS. If long hung, and vei y hard, put the ham into water a night, and then let it lie either in a hole dug in the earth, or on Stones s])rinkled with water, two or three days, to mellow, covering it with a heavy tub to keep vermin from it. In either case let it be put into a linen bag, and carefully covered. Wash and brush it well; put it into a boiler of water, and let it simmer from three

IX PREFACE. albuminous substances, the most perfect specimens of wliich are respectively, sugar, butter, and white of egg. The saccharine principle, in its most ex- tended sense, includes all those substances which are chiefly derived from the vegetable kingdom. A perfect knowledge of these principles forms the basis of French cookery. In France,” continues the reviewer, most substances are exposed through the medium of oil or butter to a temperatiu'e of 600° Fahrenheit by the operation of frying, or some analogous process. They are then intro- duced into a macerating vessel with a little water, and kept for several hours at a temperatime below the boiling point, 212°, not perhaps higher than 180°; and by these united processes, properly con- ducted, the most refractory articles, whether of animal or vegetable origin, are more or less reduced to a state of pulp, and admirably adapted for the further action of the stomach. In the common cookery of this country, on the contrary, articles are usually put at once into a large quantity of water, and submitted, without care or attention, to the boiling temperature : the consequence is, that most animal substances, when taken out, are harder and more indigestible than in the natural state ; for it is well kno'wn that albuminous substances, as for example the white of an egg, become the harder the more they are boiled. These observations are often of the utmost importance in a medical point

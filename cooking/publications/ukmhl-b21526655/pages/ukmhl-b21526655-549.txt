WINES. 469 Chap, xxii.] Riiisiii wine would be extremely good if made rich of the fruit, and kept long, which improves the flavour greatly. R.\ISIN WINE WITH CIDER. Put two hundredweight of Malaga raisins into a cask, and pour upon them a hogshead of good sound cider that is not rough ; stir it well two or three days ; stop it, and let it stand six months : then rack into a cask that it w’ill fill, and put in a gallon of the best brandy, c If raisin wine be much used, it would answer well to keep a cask always for it, and bottle off one year’s wine just in time to make the next, which, allow’ing the six months of infusion, would make the wine to be eighteen months old. In cider counties this way is very econo- mical; and, even if not thought strong enough, the ad- dition of another quarter of a hundred of raisins would be sufficient, and the wine would still be very cheap. When the raisins are pressed througli a horse-hair bag, they will either produce a good spirit hy distilla- tion, and must be sent to a chemist who will do it (but if for that purpose they must be very little pressed) ; or they will make excellent vinegar. The stalks should be picked out for the above, and may be thrown into any cask of vinegar that is making, being very acid. R.A.ISIN WINE WITHOUT CIDER. On four hundredweight ofMalagas pour one hogshead of spring water, stir w'ell daily for fourteen days, then squeeze the raisins in a horse-hair bag in a press, and tun the liquor; when it ceases to hiss, stop it close. In six months rack it off" into another cask, or into a barrel, with toast and yest to work, which there is more difficulty to make it do than most other liquors. When it ceases to hiss, put a quart of brandy to eight gallons, and stop up. Bottle in the spring or at Christmas. The liquor must be in a w'arm place to make it work.

329 FORCEMEAT. Chap, xvi.] Jamaica pepper in fine powder, or two or three cloves. The first column contains the articles of which the forcemeat may he made, without any striking flavour, and to those may he added some of the different ingre- dients of the second column to vary the taste. FORCEMEAT, TO FORCE FOWLS OR MEAT. Shred a little ham or gammon, some cold veal or fowl, some beef-suet, a small quantity of onion, some parsley, very little lemon-peel, salt, nutmeg, or pounded mace, and either white pepper or cayenne, and bread- crumbs. Pound it in a mortar, and bind it with one or two eggs, beaten or strained. For forcemeat patties, the mixture as above. FORCEMEAT FOR HARE, OR ANYTHING IN IMITATION OF IT. The scalded liver, an anchovy, some fat bacon, a little suet, some parsley* thyme, knotted marjoram, a little shalot, and either onion or chives, all chopped fine; crumbs of bread, pepper, and nutmeg, beat in a mortar with an egg. Forcemeats for mackerel, pike, haddock, and soles, will be found by reference to those articles. PASSOVER-BALLS FOR SOUP E. R. Chop an onion, and half a pound of suet very finely stew them together until the suet is melted, then pour it hot upon eight spoonsful of biscuit flour; mix it well together; add a little salt, a little grated nutmeg, lemon-peel, and ginger, add six eggs. Put the balls into the soup when it boils, and boil them for a quarter of an hour. The quantity of eggs and flour may appear disproportioned, but the flour employed is of a peculiar kind, used for the purpose in Jewish families. Notliing

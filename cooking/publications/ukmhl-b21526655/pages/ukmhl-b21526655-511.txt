JELLIES. Chap, xx.] 431 jelly, and mix with a tea-cupful of water in which a bit of beet-root has been boiled, and run it through the bag when all the rest is run out; and this is to garnish the other jelly, being cooled on a plate; but this is matter of choice. This jelly has a very fine high colour and flavour. FRUIT IN JELLY. Put into a basin half a pint of clear calfâ€™s-foot jelly ; and when it has become stiff, lay in three fine peaches, and a bunch of grapes with the stalk upwards : over which put a few vine-leaves, and fill up the bowl with jelly. Let it stand till next day, and then set the howl in hot water up to the brim for a minute ; then turn it out carefully on a dish. HARTSHORN JELLY. Simmer eight ounces of hartshorn shavings with two quarts of water to one; strain it and boil it with the rinds of four China oranges and two lemons pared thin ; w'hen cool add the juice of both, half a pound of sugar, and the whites of six eggs beaten to a froth; let the jelly have three or four boils without stirring, and strain it through a jelly-bag. CRANBERRY JELLY. Make a very strong isinglass jelly. When cold, mi.x it with a double quantity of cranberry juice. Sweeten and boil it up; then strain it into a shape. The sugar must be good loaf, or the jelly will not be clear. CRANBERRY AND RICE JELLY. Boil and press the fruit, strain the juice, and by de- grees mix into it as much ground rice as will, when boiled, thicken to a jelly ; boil it gently, stirring it, and sweeten to your taste. Put it in a basin or form, and serve to eat as the before-directed jelly with milk or cream.

[Chap. xxr. DOMESTIC COOKERY.' 436 lawn sieve; mix these well in a deep earthen pan ; add orange-flower water, and a piece of fresh lemon-peel; of the former enough to flavour and no more. Whisk it for three hours till the mixture is thick and white then with a thin broad bit of board spread it all over the top and sides, and set it in a cool oven, and an hour wil harden it. [PLUM C-YKE. Mix thoroughly a quarter of a peck of fine flour, well dried, with a pound of dry and sifted loaf-sugar, three pounds of currants washed and very dry, half a pound of raisins stoned and chopped, a quarter of an ounce of mace and cloves, twenty Jamaica peppers, a grated nutmeg, the peel of a lemon cut as fine as possible, and half a pound of almonds blanched and beaten with orange-flower water. Melt two pounds of butter in a pint and a quarter of cream, but not hot; put to it a pint of sweet wine, a glass of brandy, the whites and yolks of twelve eggs, beaten apart, and half a pint of good yest. Strain this liquor by degrees into the dry ingredients, beating them together a full hour, then butter the hoop, or pan, and bake it. As you put the batter into the hoop, or pan, throw in plenty of citron, lemoUj and orange candy. If you ice the cake, take half a pound of double- refined sugar sifted, and put a little with the white of an egg, beat it well, and by degrees pour in the re- mainder. It must be whisked near an hour, with the addition of a little orange-flower water, but mind not to put much. When the cake is done, pour the icing over, and return it to. the oven for fifteen minutes; but if the oven be warm, keep it near the mouth, and the door open, lest the colour be spoiled. -VNOTIIER.

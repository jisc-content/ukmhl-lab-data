Line the sides of a dish with paste, and put at the bottom either a beef-steak, well beaten and dredged with Hour, or a veal cutlet; clean six young pigeons very nicely, pound a small quantity of ham in a mortar, with the livers, pepper, salt, and a blade of mace : roll the yolks of six hard eggs in this mixture, and put one into the inside of each pigeon, with a small lump of butter rolled in the forcemeat, and floured. Put the breasts of the pigeons downwards; All the dish nearly with water, or broth, if it is preferable ; put on the crust, and stick the feet of the pigeons in the'middle. PARTRIDGE PIE.—E. R. Lay a veal-cutlet in the bottom of the dish; line the inside of the birds with fat bacon; season them well, place them with the breast downwards in the dish, fill it up with good gravy. The partridges may be boned, stuffed with fine forcemeat, and the dish filled up with hard-boiled eggs, forcemeat-balls, truffles, or mushrooms, in which case the partridges should be stewed previously to being put into the pie. GIBLET PIE. After very nicely cleaning goose or duck giblets, stew them with a small quantity of water, onion, black pepper, and a bunch of sweet herbs, till nearly done. Let them grow cold, and if not enough to fill the dish, lay a beef, veal, or two or three mutton steaks, at bottom. Put the liquor of the stew to bake with the above; and when the pie is baked, pour into it a large tea-cupful of cream. Sliced potatoes added to it eat extremely well. RABBIT PIE. Cut two rabbits, and a pound of fat and lean pork that has lain a week or two in pickle, into small bits;

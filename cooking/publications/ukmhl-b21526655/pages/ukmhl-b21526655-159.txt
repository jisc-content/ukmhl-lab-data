ME.1T. Chap, m.] 83 paper when spitted for roasting, and baste it very well all the time it is at the fire. When sufficiently done, take off the paper, and dredge it very gently with flour in order to froth it, but let it be dusted in this manner as quickly as possible, lest the fat should melt. Send it up in the dish with nothing but its own gravy. Some persons add a coarse paste, securing it and the papei with packthread; it is then frequently basted, and a quarter of an hour before it is removed from the fire the paper and paste are taken oft’, and the meat dredged with Hour and basted with butter; gravy should accom- pany the venison in a tureen, together with currant-jelly, either sent to table cold, or melted in port wine and served hot.

Stick two more cloves in it, paper up the fat, and roast it the same as venison, basting with the wine mixed with butter : serve it with gravy and currant-jelly.

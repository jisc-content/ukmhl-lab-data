281 CHEESE. Chap, xiv.] same of Gloucester cheese; melt without oiling a quarter of a pound of butter : then beat all in a mortar with the yolks of four eggs, the inside of a French roll boiled in milk, and a wine-glass of wine or ale. When thoroughly mixed, add the whites of the eggs, previously beaten to a froth. Put the composition into paper cases, rather long than square, and bake them in a Dutch oven. FRIED RAMAKINS.-E. R. Grate half a pound of cheese, and melt two ounces of butter; when the latter is getting cool, mix it with the cheese and the whites of three eggs well beaten.

Serve it hot, either browned or plain. CHEESE STEWED WITH ALE.—E. R. Cut the cheese into slices, pare off the rind, and put it into a dish over a lamp; then pour on as much ale as will cover it, and let it stew until the cheese is dis- solved.

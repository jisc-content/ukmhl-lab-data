PISH. 67 Chap, ii.] ROASTED OYSTERS.—E. R. Take the oysters from the shells, beard them, and put them with their liquor into tin scallops, six in a shell (not more), with a little pepper and butter. Put the shells upon a gridiron over a good fire, and serve them when plump and quite hot. They are delicious this way; but to be eaten in perfection should be cooked over a lamp in the room where they are eaten. Squeeze a little lemon-juice over them when they come from the fire. OYSTERS IN SCALLOP-SHELLS. Keep the oysters in their liquor: put a bit of butter in a stewpan, with minced parsley, shalot, and a little pepper; brown them, dusting in a little flour, then add the oyster-liquor, strained, and a little good gravy, work them until they are of the consistence of sauce ; then toss and put in the oysters, add lemon-juice, and fill the scallop-shells: strew grated bread-crumbs over the top, adding some small pieces of butter, put them into a very quick oven, and finish them of a fine brown. OYSTER LOAVES.—E. R. Take the loaves baked in tins, cut off the top, clean out the crumb, and pass them through a grater; add parsley chopped, spices, and pepper, together with the oysters, all well mixed ; fill the loaves, adding pieces of butter, pour in the liquor of the oysters strained, then put the loaves into an oven, and when well baked serve them up. One large loaf is better than the small rolls. OYSTER FRITTERS.—E. R. Beard the oysters, dip them into a thick batter, made > rich with egg, or, what is better, into an omelette, and then in crumbs of bread, fry them : they are an exquisite garnish for fried fish. F 2

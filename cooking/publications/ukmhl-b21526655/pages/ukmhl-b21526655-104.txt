DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. ii. 34 CHAPTER II. FISH. OBSERVATIONS ON DRESSING FISH. If the fishmonger does not clean it, fish is seldom very nicely done. Common cooks are apt not to slit the fish low enough, by which, and not thoroughly washing the blood, &c., from the bone, a very disgusting mass is left within, and mistaken for liver; but fishmongers in great towns wash it beyond what is necessary for cleaning, and by perpetual watering diminish the flavour.

Fish to be fried should be cleansed, dried, floured, rolled in a cloth, and jilaccd before the fire for a short time previous to its being put into the pan. Many persons prefer oil to any otlier article for frying fish, and drip- ping is esteemed the next best medium : the pan should

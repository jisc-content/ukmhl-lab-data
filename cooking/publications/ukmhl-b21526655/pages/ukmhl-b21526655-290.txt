Tie a piece of cloth over the top of the mould, put it into a stewpan with a little boiling water at the bottom of the mould, and be careful that the lid of the stewpuu sits quite close to keep in the steam. Half an hour will boil it. THE GREY PUDDING.—E. R. Take three eggs, weigh them in the shell; take an equal weight of sugar and of butter, and two-thirds of the weight of flour. Half melt the butter and be^it it

[Chap. ix. DOMESTIC COOKERY. 166 TO BRAISE CHICKENS. Bone, and fill them with forcemeat. Lay the hones, and any other poultry trimmings, into a stew^an, and the chickens on them. Put to them a few' onions, a fagot of herbs, three blades of mace, a pint of stock, and a glass or tw'o of sherry. Cover the chickens with slices of bacon, and then white paper; cover the w'hole close, and put them on a slow stove for two hours. Then take them up, strain the braise, and skim off the fat carefully ; set it on to boil very quick to a glaze, and do the chickens over it with a brush. Serve with a brown fricassee of mushrooms. Before glazing, put the chickens into an oven for a few minutes, to give a little colour. FOWL A LA BRAISE.—E. R. Bone a fowl, stuff it w'ith various kinds of stuffing, viz., forcemeat, sausage-meat, and hard eggs sliced; sew' it up, put it into a stewpan, with a braise, consisting of an onion, a bunch of sw'eet herbs, the bones of the foAvl, and other parts of it, bacon in slices, or butter, with a tea-cupful of water; shake the pan until the gravy is drawn, then turn the fowl in the braise, letting it stew for two or three hours, according to the size. Strain the braise, skim off the fat, thicken it, and serve it as sauce to the fowl, with forcemeat and egg-balls. FOWL W'ITH OYSTERS.—E. R. Fill a fowl, either boned or plain, w ith oysters ; if not boned a dozen would be sufficient; put the fowl into a jar, and plunge the jar into water. Let it boil or rather stew for an hour and a half if a small fowl, and two hours if large. There w'ill be nearly a pint of gravy found in the jar; skim and take off the fat, and convert it into white sauce by the addition of a little butter and flour, eggs, or cream; add to it the oyster liquor, and warm in it a dozen oysters bearded for the sauce.

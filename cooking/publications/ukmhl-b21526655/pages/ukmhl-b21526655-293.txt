Mix three quarters of a pound of currants or raisins, one pound of suet, one pound of flour, six eggs, a little good milk, some lemon-peel, a little salt. Boil it in a melon-shape six hours. PUDDINGS IN HASTE. Shred suet, and put, with grated bread, a few currants, the yolks of four eggs and the whites of two, some grated lemon-peel, and ginger. Mix, and make into little balls about the siz,e and shape of an egg, with a little .flour. Have ready a skillet of boiling water, and throw them in. Twenty minutes will boil them; but they will rise to the top when done. Serve with pudding-sauce. MADEIRA PUDDING.—E. R. Have a tin cake-mould, of which the bottom will come out; butter it, and lay upon it a piece of paste the size of the mould; cover it with preserve of apricots; then lay another piece of paste, and cover this with red preserves, and so on in different layers, with paste be- tween, until the mould is filled. Boil; and serve with brandy-sauce. This is a rich pudding, for wdiich the island of Madeira is very famous. Great care will be necessary in taking it out of the mould ; and it will take a long time to boil it properly. ALMOND PUDDING.—E. R. Take tw-o ounces and a half of w’hite bread-crumbs, and steep them in a pint of cream; then pound half a pint of lilanched almonds to a paste with some water. Beat the yolks of six eggs, and the whites of three; mix all together, and add three ounces of sugar, and an ounce of beaten butter; put all over the fire; stir it until it thickens, and then bake it in a puff-paste.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. ii. 214 THE MERTON ALMOND PUDDING E. R. Take six ounces of almonds ground to flour, six ounces of sifted white sugar, a tea-spoonful of lemon-peel grated, a few drops of essence of lemon, and eight eggs, leaving out two of the whites ; heat up the eggs, and mix in the other ingredients, beating the whole for an hour one way. Let the oven be ready; oil the dish, and bake the pud- ding the instant it is completed. N.B.—Too much cannot be said in praise of this pudding, which, in consequence of its not containing any butter, may be eaten by the most delicate person without a chance of disagreeing. Its excellence, how- ever, depends upon its being beaten for a full hour, and baked immediately. CURD PUDDING.—E. R. Turn two quarts of milk, and drain oflf the curd. Beat it in a mortar with two ounces of butter, until the butter and curd are well united. Then beat the yolks of six eggs, and the whites of three; add them to the curd; add a little grated bread or biscuit, a tea-spoonful of grated lemon-peel, some nutmeg, and a few pounded peach kernels; mix them well together; butter a dish, and bake it with a crust round the edges. Currants may be added. CITRON PUDDING.—E. R. Take half an ounce of citron, the same quantity of candied orange and of lemon-peel; cut them into slices, and put to them five ounces of loaf-sugar, and five ounces of butter. Make a paste, and line a dish ; then lay the peel regularly at the bottom; beat up four eggs with half the whites; then add the rest of the ingre- dients, and bake half an hour. This is a famous Norwich receipt, kindly forwarded by Mrs. Opie, and is taken from an original document furnished by Mr. Black, the celebrated confectioner of that city, to the author of “ The Two Rectors.”

[Chap. xx. 408 DOMESTIC COOKERY. LEMON SPONGE.—E. R. To a pint of water put an ounce of isin^ass, the rind of a lemon, and half a pound of lump-??f^ar; let it simmer for half an hour, and then strain it through a lawn sieve : when nearly cold, add the juice of three lemons and the -white of one egg, whisk it until it is -white and thick : in the summer it will require rather more isinglass. TRIFLE.—E. R. Place at the bottom of the trifle-dish a layer of macaroons and ratafia-cakes, and pour over them as much sweet wine or brandy as they -wfill absorb. Squeeze the juice of a lemon, and add it to a quart of cream not too thick; sweeten the cream -\vith sugar rubbed upon the rind; add a little brandy and the white of an egg beaten to a froth. Whisk the mixture, and as the froth rises lay it on a sieve to drain : when enough has been drained for the purpose, make a custard -with the remaining cream and that Avhich has drained from the froth; put it on a very slow fire -^-ith two laurel- leaves, and when nearly boiling take it off, and add the yolks of four eggs and the whites of two,—the number necessary for a pint of custard. Put it again on the fire, stirring slowly one way till it thickens, but taking care not to allow it to come to a boil. Cover ^ the macaroons with raspberry or other jam, then pour on the custard; and Avhen the custard is quite cold put on the froth, sprinkling harlequin comfits on the top, and garnishing M'ith diS'crent-coloured sweet- meats. In some of the good old-fashioned receipts for trifle, a layer of calf’s-foot jelly is added to the others, but, should that be disapproved, it is necessary to state that none of the other ingredients should be omitted. Mo- dern trifles are often trifles indeed, merely consisting of a few cakes and a little fi-oth. *

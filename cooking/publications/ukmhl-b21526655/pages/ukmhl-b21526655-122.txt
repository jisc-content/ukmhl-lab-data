FILLETS OF MACKEREL.—E. R. Bone several mackerel, take the fish off in fillets lengthways, turning them round. Chop fennel and parsley, and put it in a stewpan, with some fish-broth well seasoned, lay in the fish, and let it stew ten minutes.

When thus dressed, rub them over with salt and vinegar, skewer them with their tails in their mouths, lay them on a fish-plate, and boil them for ten minutes in boiling water. Drain them thoroughly, and lay them round a dish with the heads in the centre ; garnish with boiled parsley, and serve up with a good sauce. Herrings should be broiled over a good fire :

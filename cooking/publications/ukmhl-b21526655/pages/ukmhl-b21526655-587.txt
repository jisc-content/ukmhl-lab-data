To prevent the earthy taste, soak it in cold water an hour, pour that off, and wash it well ; then add more, [ and simmer gently till the berries are clear, with lemon- 1 peel and spice, if approved. Add wine and sugar, and I; boil all up together. S.AGO MILK. Cleanse, as above, and boil it slowly, and wholly with /: new milk.

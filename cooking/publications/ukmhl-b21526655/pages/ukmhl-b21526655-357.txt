OMELETTE SOtJFFLEf.—E. R. Separate the whites from the yolks of six eggs, taking care to remove the specks : add to the yolks two spoons- ful of dry pounded sugar and a little lemon-juice, work them well together. Whip the whites until they are firm, then mix them with the rest. Put a small piece of butter into the fryingpan, let it melt upon a slow fire, then add the omelette, taking great care that it does not burn; turn it out upon a dish, glaze by strewing sugar over it; then put it into the oven: when it has risen glaze it again, and serve it. Orange-flower water may be used instead of lemon-juice. FRENCH OMELETTE,—E. R, Take four eggs, beat the yolks and whites together with a table-spoonful of milk, a little salt and pepper; put two ounces of butter in the pan, and let it remain for five minutes j beat the eggs for the same time, pour them into the pan, and allow them to remain quiet for a few minutes, taking care to separate the omelette gently from the bottom of the pan with a fork ; now shake it to keep it from burning at the bottom. It Avill not take more than five minutes frying. Chopped parsley, onions, or kidney, may be added; and omelettes are judiciously varied by mixing grated ham or tongue, anchovies or oysters chopped. Any kind of vegetables will be admissible, particularly asparagus-tops previously boiled: tomatos, scalded and beaten through a sieve, are much approved. Some cooks add a spoonful of rich gravy to the beaten eggs, others the juice of an orange or lemon ; the omelette is only to be fried on one side, and served up doubled over; the pan should be one made on purpose, and rather deep, but a common fryingpan will suffice, though not so well.

272 DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. xin. VEGETABLE MARROW.—E. R. This excellent vegetable may be dressed in a variety of ways, plain boiled, cut in slices, and served upon toast, with melted butter, or stewed in a good gravy, or boiled and mashed in the same manner as turnips, and if made rather thinner with a little cream, or fine white sauce, formed into a purde. These purees, it must be remarked, should not, when made of the mar- row or any other vegetable, be served up alone, but put into the middle of a dish, with meat or poultry of some kind, as they properly come under the denomination of sauces. BEET-ROOTS Make a very pleasant addition to winter salad, of which they may agreeably form a full half, instead of being only used to ornament it. This root is cooling and very wholesome. It is extremely good boiled and sliced with a small quantity of onions, or stewed' with whole onions, large or small, as follows :— Boil the beet tender with the skin on ; slice it into a stewpan with a little broth and a spoonful of vinegar, simmer till the gravy is tinged with the colour; then put it into a small dish, and make a round of the but- ton-onions, first boiled till tender ; take oft’ the skin just before serving, and mind they are quite hot, and clear. STEWED BEET-ROOT.—E. R. Bake the beet-root in an oven until it is quite tender, and, when cold, scrape off the outside coat: cut it in slices, and pour a little vinegar over it: then put it into a stewpan, and cover it with gravy; stew gently for half an hour, and, before serving, thicken the gravy with a little cream. The sauce should be of a fine red colour; and perhaps it would be advisable to pound one or two slices in a mortar, to extract the juice. Observe

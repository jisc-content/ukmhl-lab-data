238 DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap, xn stewpan lay slices of turnip, onion, three inches of celery, and two large carrots cut lengthways, and the steaks over; add as much water, or beef broth, as shall half cover them ; set the pan on a moderate stove, and some wood embers on the lid; simmer slowly two hours, then remove the twine, and placing the bones upwards, lean- ing on each other, strain the gravy over them. QUEUES DE VEAU.—CALVES’ TAILS. Having nicely cleaned and soaked four calves’ tails, cut off the small ends, and blanch them. Drv, flour, and fry them a fine brown in butter, drain the fat from them, and having ready a pint of weak broth, with a bunch of sweet herbs, chibols, two bay-leaves, half a pint of mushrooms, pepper, and salt, boiled up and skimmed, wipe the sides of the casserole, put the tails in, and simmer very slovvly until they are quite tender. Keep them hot while the gravy is strained, and boiled to a glaze to cover them. If you have no mushrooms, mix a little of the powder into the gravy just before serving. Have ready small onions, and peel to one size to send up in the dish. RIS DE VEAU.—SWEETBREADS. Skin and blanch three sweetbreads; boil till ready for eating; dry, and brown with a salamander. Put over a little glaze, and serve with real gravy and glazed onions, or stewed mushrooms, round. RIS DE VEAU EN CAISSES.—SWEETBREADS IN CASES. Blanch three sweetbreads, and simmer in a strong, well-flavoured gravy, till quite done. Have ready three round pieces of white paper oiled, and lay them thereon ; having left them lightly wetted with gravy, sprinkle over them the finest crumbs or raspings of bread, pepper, salt, and a very little nutmeg. Do them slowly on a grid- iron, and serve in the cases. Any of the vegetable sauces may be served to eat with them.

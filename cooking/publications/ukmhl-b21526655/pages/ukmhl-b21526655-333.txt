VEGETABLES. Chap, xiii.] 253 CHAPTER XIII. VEGETABLES. OBSERVATIONS ON DRESSING VEGETABLES. Vegetables should be carefully cleaned from insects, and nicely washed. Boil them in plenty of water, and drain them the moment they are done enough. If over-boiled they lose their beauty and crispness. Bad cooks some- times dress them with meat; which is wrong, except carrots with boiling beef. TO BOIL VEGETABLES GREEN. Be sure the water boils when you put them in. Make them boil very fast. Do not cover, but watch them; and if the water has not slackened, you may be sure they are done when they begin to sink. Then take them out immediately, or the colour will change. Hard water, especially if chalybeate, spoils the colour of such vegetables as should be green. To boil them green in hard water, put a tea-spoonful of salt of wormwood into the water when it boils before the vegetables are put in. TO KEEP GREEN PEAS, AS PRACTISED IN THE EMPEROR OF RUSSIAâ€™S KITCHEN. Shell, scald, and dry them as above ; put them on tins, or earthen dishes, in a cool oven once or twice, to harden. Keep them in paper bags hung up in the kitchen. When they are to be used, let them lie an hour in water; then set them on with cold water and a bit of butter, and boil them till ready. Put a sprig of dried mint to boil with them. TO BOIL GREEN PEAS. Wash after shelling them : boil with a spoonful of sugar

161 Chap, ix.] POULTRY. POULARD A LA ROYALE—E. R. Bone the fowl and stuff it with sweetbread, liver, and mushrooms, well seasoned and made into a ragout. Sew' up the fowl; cover it with thin slices of lard or bacon, and either tie paper over it and roast it or put it to braise: if roasted, take off the lard and paper, be- fore serving, to brown it. Send it up on a purde of chestnuts. A turkey poult may be dressed the same ■way. DAVENPORT FOWLS. Hang young fowls a night; take the livers, hearts, and tenderest parts of the gizzards, the last being pre- viously boiled, shred very small, with half a handful of young clary, an anchovy to each fowl, an onion, and the yolks of four eggs boiled hard, with pepper, salt, and mace, to your tasle. Stuff the fowls with this, and sew' up the vents and necks quite close, that the water may not get in. Boil them in salt and water till almost done; then drain them, and put them into a stewpan w'ith butter enough to brown them. Serve with a good deal of melted butter, w'ith either soy or ketchup in it. CHICKENS A LA CARMELITE.—E. R. Put a piece of butter the size of a walnut into a stew’pan : as it melts, dredge in flour, and when the whole is well mixed add a tea-cupful of milk. Cut up the chickens and put them in, adding peppercorns, an onion, and a blade of mace. Stew them until tender, adding milk and water if too dry. Take out the chick- ens ; have some parsley ready boiled and chopped; mix it with lemon-juice and a little white pepper; lay it upon the chickens ; strain and thicken the sauce ; add a glass of white wine; and send it to table garnished with chop- ped parsley and lemon or pickles. TO nilOIL A FOWL.—E. R. Split the fowl down the back; season it very well with pepper, and put it on the gridiron with the inner part next the fire, which must be very clear. Hold M

510 DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap, xxit; This is of particular use in weak bowels. It should be of a fine brow'n colour before drinking it. WHEY.—E. R. Put a pint of milk, milk-warm, into a stewpan or other vessel before the fire, add to it half a table-spoon- ful of rennet. When the curd forms, cut it into squares to allow the whey to escape. Then put it on a sieve carefully, for it must not be burned. LEMON W'ATER, A DELIGHTFUL DRINK. Put two slices of lemon thinly pared into a tea-pot, a little bit of the peel, and a bit of sugar, or a large spoonful of capillaire; pour in a pint of boiling water, and stop it close two hours. APPLE M ATER. Cut two large apples in slices, and pour a quart of boiling water on them; or on roasted apples; strain in two or three hours, and sweeten lightly. WHITE-WINE WHEY. Put half a pint of new milk on the fire; the moment it boils up, pour in as much sound raisin wine as M'ill completely turn it, and it looks clear ; let it boil up, then set the saucepan aside till the curd subsides, and do not stir it. Pour the M hey off, and add to it half a pint of boiling water, and a bit of M'hite sugar. Thus you Mill have a whey perfectly cleared of milky particles, and as w'eak as you choose to make it. VINEGAR AND LEMON MTIEYS. Pour into boiling milk as much vinegar or lemon-juice as will make a small quantity quite clear, dilute M'ith hot w’ater to an agreeable smart acid, and put a bit or two of sugar. This is less heating than if made of -^'ine; and, if, only to excite perspiration, answers as M’ell.

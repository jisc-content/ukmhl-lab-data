Ude is in the right when he declares the faculty to be most unjustly the opponents of cooks. He is right also in stating that the cultivation of the art is retarded by the hostility of the fam sex. In the higher ranks an idea is entertahied that any con- sideration connected with eating is injurious to the dehcacy of the feminine character; this notion being sti'engthened, as it descends, by an indisposition to rmdertake the toils which attention to the table must necessarily involve. Eating is an unpoetical thing: Lord Bp-on dishl^ed to see women eat; and ladies, sheltering themselves under such high authority, neglect the care of the table, and make their male relatives suffer from their over-refine- ment, if such it may be called, which limits the bni of fare to a joint of beef or mutton. Nothing can be more erroneous than the sup- position, too commonly entertained arnongst young ladies, that hving on air, or vegetables, or a non- descript ambrosial kind of food, which they some- times affect, will add to their personal attractions. A generous diet is in most instances absolutely essential to the complexion; while indigestion, brought on by a regimen ill adapted to the consti- tution of the party pursuing it, is frequently de- structive to symmetry of form. Bout cakes, Avhen taken as the only diet, have proved as detrimental.

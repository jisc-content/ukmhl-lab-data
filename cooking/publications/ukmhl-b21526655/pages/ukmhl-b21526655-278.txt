[Chap. x. DOMESTIC COOKERY. 198 SWEET PATTIES. Chop the meat of a boiled calf’s foot, of w hich you use the liquor for jelly, two apples, one ounce of orange and lemon-peel candied, and some fresh peel and juice; mix with them half a nutmeg grated, the yolk of an egg, a spoonful of brandy, and four ounces of currants, washed and dried. Bake in small pattypans. PATTIES RESEMBLING MINCE PIES. Chop the kidney and fat of cold veal, apple, orange, and lemon-peel candied, and fresh currants, a little wine, two or three cloves, a little brandy, and a bit of sugar. Bake as before. OBSERVATIONS ON SWEET PIES.—E. R. All pies made either with summer fruit or with winter preserves will be improved by a mixture of apples, pared and sliced. Apples will in this way eke out the remains of a pot of jam, with advantage to themselves and the jam. They are especially good with fresh cherries, currants, &c., and will be found an agreeable addition to cranberries. Equal portions also of cran- berries and any very sweet jam will improve both these ingredients. When apples are mixed with jam, they should be sliced thin, and if syrup be wanted, a few slices boiled with a little of the jam in sugar and water. In making pies of green gooseberries, apples, or rhubarb, the sugar should be clarified, that is, boiled in a little water, hut no water poured into the pie, according to the practice of ignorant cooks, who thus destroy the flavour of the fruit. TO PREPARE CRANBERRIES FOR TARTS. Simmer them in moist sugar, without breaking, twenty minutes; and let them become cold before used. A pint will require nearly three ounces of sugar.

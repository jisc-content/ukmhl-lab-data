Two large spoonsful of snow will supply the place of one egg, and make a pudding equally good. This is a useful piece of informa- tion, as snow generally falls in the season when eggs are dear. The sooner it is used after it falls the better; but it may be taken up from a clean spot, and kept in a cool place some hours, without losing its good qualities. -Bottled malt liquors are also a good substitute for eggs; the sooner used after the cork is drawn the better. The yolks and wliites, beaten long and separatelj"^, make the article they are put into much lighter. Eggs must be always strained after beating.

A small pinch of salt improves the flavour of all mix- tures, even when the other ingredients are sweet. Well-made raisin wine will serve, in most cases, when wine is ordered for puddings. As the goodness of boiled puddings greatly depends upon keeping the water from the ingredients, the cook

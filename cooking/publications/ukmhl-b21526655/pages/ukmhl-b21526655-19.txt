PREFACE. XlU Inattention to the table is naturally productive of much inhospitality: visitors coming from a dis- tance are often permitted to leave the houses of thefr friends without the expected invitation to par- take of the family meal, on account of the shame which the mistress of the house entertains of her dinner, which is perhaps very inconsistent with the style and fmmiture of the establishment. It is this neglect also wliich renders the set dinners, given upon occasions of importance, such melancholy affairs —not the least ridiculous part of them being the contrast which they afford to the usual mode of Hving of the entertainer. At these festivals, wiiich, in consequence of -their expense, must ne- cessarily be few and far between, one of three expedients must be resorted to: the famdy cook, totally out of practice, must undertake to experi- mentalize ; or an assistant is hired, who, from in- competency, or want of the means and appliairces of a first-rate kitchen, mars the whole concern; or the dinner is contracted for at a neighbouring pastrycook’s, that is, in London, or any large city. These dinners usually prove failures, in consequence of an injudicious display, and the disarrangement of all the customary habits of the establishment. Mr. Walker has justly observed, that “ it is one of the evils of the present day, that everybody strives after the same dull style; so that, where comfort is to be expected, it is least to be found.

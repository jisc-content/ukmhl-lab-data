Chap, m.] Then take it up, and, without withdrawing the spit, cut it down the back and belly, lay it into the dish, and chop the sage and bread quickly as fine as you can, and mix them with a large quantity of fine melted butter that has very little flour. Put the sauce into the dish after the pig has been split down the back, and garnished with the ears and the two jaws: take off the upper part of the head down to the snout. In Devonshire it is served whole, if very small; the head only being cut off to gar- nish, as above. It will require from an hour to an hour and a half to roast. TO ROAST A PIG.—E. R. When prepared for the spit, roll a small lump of butter in flour and chopped sage-leaves, and put it in the inside. When warm at the fire, take the whites of one or two eggs, beat them w'ell, and, with a small brush or a bunch of feathers, spread it all over the pig. When nearly roasted, catch the gravy that falls, and, when taken from the spit, remove the sage-leaves from the inside; cut off the head, split, and take out the brains, cut the pig down the back and into quarters, cut off' the ears, and lay them with the head round the dish. Mix with the gravy already caught the brains and the sage-leaves, chopped small, together with a little cream or melted butter heated in a saucepan, and pour it into the dish. Send up the pig with various sauces,—viz., currant- sauce, egg-sauce, gravy, and plumped prunes or raisins. This is an old-fashioned recipe for roasting pig, but us it obtained when the dish was a favourite, it has been insert- ed here.

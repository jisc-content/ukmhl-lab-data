Cover them with butter, then with very thick paper tied down, and bake them. When cold, put them dry into pots that will hold two or three in each; and pour butter over them, using that which was baked as part. Observe that the butter should be pretty tliick over them, if they are to be kept. If pigeons were boned, and then put in an oval form into the pot, they would lie closer, and require less butter. They may be stuffed with a fine forcemeat made with veal, bacon, &c., and then they will eat excellently. If a high flavour is ap- proved of, add mace, allspice, and a little cayenne, before baking.

Rub every part well; then lay the breast downwards in a pan, and pack the birds as close as you possibly can. Put a good deal of butter on them; then cover the pan with a coarse flour paste and a paper over, tie it close, and bake. When cold, put the birds into pots, and cover them with butter. A VERY CHEAP W'AY OF POTTING BIRDS. Prepare them as directed in the last receipt; and when baked and grown cold, cut them into proper pieces for helping; pack them close into a large pot- ting-pan, and (if possible) leave no spaces to receive the butter. Cover them with butter, and one-third part less will be wanted than when the birds are done whole. The butter that has covered potted things will serve for basting, or for paste for meat pies. TO POT LOBSTERS. Half boil them, pick out the meat, cut it into small

SOUPS. ’ Chap, i.] 15 HOTCH POTCH.—E. R. Take any quantity of lamb-chops, pare off the fat, lay them in a stewpan in this manner: a layer of chops at the bottom, covered with every kind of vege- table cut in small pieces, onions, celery, lettuce, carrots, turnips, and green peas; then put on a layer of chops, and so on, with the vegetables, until the whole are added : fill up the pan with water, or rather cover the ingredients with water, and let it stew several hours very gently : it will be quite thick.

Tomato soup may be made the same way, leaving out the carrots, and j)utting in a greater number of tomatos: when the latter are not to be had, a small

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 296 [Chap. iv. Cut the boiled mutton into small pieces, and fry it in butter; then add it and the rice with the butter, a few cloves, a little cinnamon, and some cardamoms. Let the whole simmer for half an hour. In dishing it, put a little rice at the bottom of the dish, the meat in the centre; cover it over with the remainder of the rice, and scatter the spice on the top. KHICHAREE.—E. R. Boil a pint of rice in broth; and, having steeped a tea-cupful of dried peas in water, boil them till they are soft. Then slice two or three onions, and fry them in butter, with a dozen or two of cardamum-seeds, a little white pepper, six cloves, and salt; take out the onions when browned, and the spice, and add a cup of curds or milk to the butter; stew it a little; distribute the onions, spice, and peas equally through the rice, and pour the butter, &c., over it. Or put the whole into an earthen jar; secure the aperture with a paste, and put into the oven, or over a charcoal fire, for five-and-twenty minutes, adding sufficient broth to moisten it, in which case the rice must only be half boiled previously. TO BOIL RICE.—E. R. Wash it well, and boil it in a large quantity of cold water; when a very little of the centre of the grain remains hard, take it off the fire, strain off half or more of the hot water fill the saucepan with cold water, and shake the rice; then strain all the water off, and the grains will separate; place the pan of rice near the fire to swell, and the centre part of the grains will become tender.—Ods. This is a most excellent method of boiling rice, never failing to produce it in perfection ; but, as a choice may be desirable, another weU-recom- mended receipt is given. Take a pound of rice, soak it for four minutes, then put it into four times its weight of boiling water, and, when sufficiently done, drain off the water thoroughly, and replace the saucepan on the fire until the grains separate.

470 DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap, xxii CURR.\NT ■WINE.—E. R. To each gallon of juice put t-wo of water and three pounds and a half of moist sugar. When it has been m the cask about a fortnight, put a bottle of brandy to every four gallons of wine, and, when it has quite done hissing, bung it down close. RASPBERRY WINE.'' To every quart of well-picked raspberries put a quart of water ; bruise, and let them stand two days; strain off the liquor, and to every gallon put three pounds of lump-sugar ; when dissolved, put the liquor in a barrel, and when fine, which will be in about two months, bottle it, and to each bottle put a spoonful of brandy or a glass of wine. RASPBERRY OR CURRANT WINE. To every three pints of fruit, carefully cleared from mouldy or bad, put one quart of water; bruise the former. In twenty-four hours strain the liquor, and put to every quart a pound of sugar, of good middling quality of Lisbon. If for white currants use lump-sugar. It is best to put the fruit, &c., in a large pan ; and when in three or four days the scum rises, take that off before the liquor be put into the barrel. Those who make from their own gardens may not have sufficiency to fill the barrel at once ; the wine will not be hurt if made in the pan, in the above proportions, and added as the fruit ripens, and can be gathered in dry weather. Keep an account of what is put in each time. ANOTHER WAY. Put five quarts of currants and a pint of raspberries to every tw’o gallons of water; let them soak a night; then squeeze and break them well. Next day rub them well on a fine wire sieve till all the juice is obtained, washing the skins again with some of the water; then to every gallon put four pounds of very good Lisbon

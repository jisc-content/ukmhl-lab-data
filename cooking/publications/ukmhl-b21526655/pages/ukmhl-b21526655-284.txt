204 DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. xi. should take care to have moulds and basins in readiness that will exactly hold the quantity directed. Puddings of bread or flour are much better if all the ingredients be mixed (except the eggs) three hours before boiling or baking; and they should be well stirred just before they are put into the oven or saucepan. When butter is ordered to be put warm into puddings, the addition of a little milk or wine will prevent its oiling. Half an hour should be allowed for boiling a bread pudding in a half-pint basin, and so on in proportion. A mealy potato, grated -while hot, and beaten well with a spoonful of milk, will add greatly to the light- ness of plum puddings, whether boiled or baked. HUNTERS’ PUDDING. Mix a pound of suet, ditto flour, ditto currants, ditto raisins, stoned and a little cut, the rind of half a lemon shred as fine as possible, six Jamaica peppers, in fine powder, four eggs, a glass of brandy, a little salt, and as little milk as will make it of a proper consistence; boil it in a floured cloth, or a melon-mould, eight or nine hours. Serve with sw’eet-sauce. Add sometimes a spoonful of peach-w'ater for change of flavour. This pudding will keep, after it is boiled, six months, if kept tied up in the same cloth, and hung up, folded in a sheet of cap-paper, to preserve it from dust, being first cold.

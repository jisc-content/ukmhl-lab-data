286 DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. xiv. SALAD.—E. R. Purselane, an herb now little cultivated in England, is an excellent ingredient in summer salad, which should consist of young cos lettuces, mustard and cress, very young radishes, any kind of fine herb in season, and chives placed round the edge of the dish, and not cut into it: in winter endive, cabbage lettuce, beet-root, celery, and onions. The excellence of a salad consists in the vegetables being young and fresh; they should be pre- pared only a short time before they are wanted, the salad mixture being either poured into the bottom of the bowl, or sent up in a sauce-tureen, and not stirred with the vegetables until they are served. BOILED SALAD.—E. R. Any cold boiled vegetables make excellent salad in winter. Beet-root, celery, Spanish onions, carrots, and broccoli, should be cut small, and served with the same mixture as that employed for vegetables in their raw state. In summer cold peas, French beans, cauliflowers, asparagus-tops, or a portion of anything in season may be employed, and they are particularly nice with cream instead of oil. POTATO SALAD.—E. R. Cut boiled potatoes in thin slices, and chop very small pickled cucumbers, onions, and chillies, an anchovT or two, and some capers or nasturtians; serve them with a salad mixture. FRENCH SALAD. Chop there anchovies, a shalot, and some parsley, small, put them into a bowd with tw'o table-spoonsful of vinegar, one of oil, a little mustard, and salt. When well mixed, add by degrees some cold roast or boiled meat in very thin slices; put in a few' at a time, not exceeding two or three inches long. Shake them in the seasoning, and then put more; cover the bowl

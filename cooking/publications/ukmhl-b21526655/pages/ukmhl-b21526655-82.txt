DOMESTIC COOKERY. 12 [Ch.\p. I. Fry some shalot in butter, and dredge in flour enough to thicken the gravy; stir this into the bro-vvning, and give it one or two boils; skim it carefully, and then put in the head ; put in also a pint of Madeira wine, and simmer till the meat is quite tender. About ten minutes before you serve, put in some basil, tarragon, chives, parsley, cayenne pepper, and salt to your taste; also two spoonsful of mushroom-ketchup, and one of soy. Squeeze the juice of a lemon into the tureen, and pour the soup upon it. Forcemeat-balls and small eggs. A CHEAPER WAY TO PREPARE MOCK-TURTLE. Prepare half a calf’s-head, withoxit the skin, as above : when the meat is cut off, break the bones and put them into a saucepan with some gravy made of beef and veal bones, and seasoned with fried onions, herbs, mace, and pepper. Have ready two or three ox-palates, boiled so tender as to blanch, and cut into small pieces ; to which a cow-heel, likewise cut into pieces, is a great improvement. Brown some butter, flour, and onion, and pour the gravy to it; then add the meats as above, and stew. Half a pint of sherry, an anchovy, two spoonsful of walnut-ketchup, the same of mushroom-ketchup, and some chopped herbs as before. Balls, &c. GREEN PEAS SOUP.—E. R. The liquor in which a leg of mutton or half a calPs- head has been boiled will make an excellent stock for this soup. Take a peck of peas, and, in shelling them, separate the old from the young ; boil tlie former por- tion until they are quite tender in the soup, then rub them through a sieve, return them to the stock, and let them stew gently together. Put in the young jieas just time enough before the soup is served to allow them to be properly cooked. Artichoke bottoms or cucum- bers may be added with advantage; ])are a couple of cucumbers, cut them in pieces, take out the seeds, dry them in a cloth, flour, and fry them of a light brown.

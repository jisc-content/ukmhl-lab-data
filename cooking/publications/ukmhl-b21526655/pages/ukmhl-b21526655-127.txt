Chap, ii.] FISH. 57 all in fine powder, but do not season until the fish shall have drained all night. Lay them in a stone pot one by one, and curled round, the spices and salt being sprink- led in and about them. Clarify two pounds of butter, and half a pound of the finest beef-suet, pour it on the fish, and lay thick paper over to keep in the steam. Bake three hours in a moderate oven. Look often at them, and as the oil works up, take it clear off. They will thus, in the storepot, keep till spring. Put into pots for serving as wanted ; observing to take off the old butter, and having warmed the fish in the oven, cover with fresh butter only. STEWED FISH, HEBREW FASHION.—E. R. Take three or four parsley roots, cut them into long thin slices, and two or three onions also sliced, boil them together in a quart of water until quite tender; then flavour it with ground white pepper, nutmeg, mace, and a little safron, the juice of two lemons, and a spoonful of vinegar. Put in the fish, and let it stew for twenty minutes or half an hour ; then take it out, strain the gravy, thicken it with a little Hour and liutter, have balls made of chopped fish, bread-crumbs, spices, and the yolks of one or two eggs mixed up together, and drop them into the liquor. Let them boil, then put in the fish, and serve it up with the balls and parsley-roots. CALEDONIAN RECIPE FOR DRESSING FISH.—E. R. Boil the livers of the fish, and make them into force- meat-balls, with oatmeal, onions, pepper and salt. Put the water on with some cold butter and w'hole onions, and when the onions are sufficiently boiled put in the fish, and stew them with their heads on, seasoning with salt and cayenne pepper; add the lialls also. N.B. Some persons use small beer instead of water.

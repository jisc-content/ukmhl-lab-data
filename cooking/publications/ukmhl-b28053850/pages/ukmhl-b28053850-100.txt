COOKERY BOOK 100 best adapted to the purpose has, no doubt, in a great measure, militated against its being more generally bestowed throughout the kingdom ; and it is in order to supply that deficient knowledge, that I have de- termined on giving easy instructions for its pre- paration. JSiO. 239. How TO Prepare a liAROE Quantity OF Goon Soup for tue Poor. It is customary with most large families, while living in the country, to kill at least some portion of the meat consumed iu their households ; and witiiout supposing for a moment that any portion of this is ever wasted, I may be allowed to suggest that certain parts, such as sheep’s heads, plucks, shanks, and scrag-ends, might A^ery well be spared toAvards making a good mess of soup for the poor. The bones left from cooked joints, first baked in a brisk oven for a quarter of an hour, and afterwards boiled in a large copper of Avater for six hours, would readily prepare a gelatinized foundation broth for the soup ; the bones, Avheu sufficiently boiled, to be taken out. And thus, supposing that your copper is already part filled Avith the broth made from bones (all the grease- having been removed from the surface), add any meat you may haA'e, cut up iu ]iieces of about four ounces weight, garnish plentifully with carrots, celery, onions, some thyme, and ground allspice, AA’ell-soaked split peas, barley, or rice; and, as the soup boils up, skim it well occasionally, season moderately Avith salt, and > after about four hours’ gentle and continuous boiling, the soup Avill be ready for distribution. It Avas the custom in families where I haA'e lived as cook, to allow a pint of this soup, served out Avith the pieces of meat in it, to as many as the recipients’ families numbered; and the soup Avas made for distribution twice every week daring winter.

BROWN & POISON’S PATENT CORN FLOUR Being first of the kind manufactured in the United Kingdom and France, it is in both Countries not only THE ORIGINAL, but is indisputably the only article of the kind, which by its own merit, and the simple publicity of its uses, has been adopted by the best families as an invariable table delicacy. It is prepared by a process to which long experience has given the greatest perfection, and from grain carefully selected from the choicest Eurojiean crops ; these advantages are so appreci- able, that its quality has by comparison been preferred to all others, and THE LANCET, in a notice given July 24, 1858, states, “This is superior to anything of the kind known ”—an opinion indis- putably confirmed by scientific tests and public appreciation. THE ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS^ AND THE LEISURE HOUR, ^ave given most interesting notices accompanied by engravings, explanatory of the process of manufacture; and Dr. Lankesteb, F.R.S., F.L.S., speaks of it in the highest terms of praise in his Lectures at the ‘South Kensington Museum, on “Food."— (Hardwicke, Piccadilly, pp. 71—80.) Families by writing on their orders packets' Brown and Poison, and refosing to receive any but the packages which bear BROWN and POLSON’S name in full and Trade Mark, would discourage the fraudu- lent means by which the substitution of inferior kinds are encouraged. Many Grocers, Chemists, etc., who supply the best quality, in preference to best profit articles, sell none but BROWN and POLSON’S. i

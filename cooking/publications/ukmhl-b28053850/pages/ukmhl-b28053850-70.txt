Ingi’edieuts, one pound of flour, half a pint of treacle, two ounces of butter, half an ounce of ground ginger, a pinch of allspice, a tea-spoonful of carbonate of soda, and a pinch of salt. Mix all the above in- gredients into a firm, well-kneaded stifl* paste, divide this into about twenty-four parts, roll these into shape like walnuts, place them upon greased baking- tins at distances of two inches apart from each other, and bake the gingerbread nuts in a rather brisk oven for about fifteen minutes. No. 135, How TO Steam Potatoes. Peel the potatoes thinly, wash them clean, put them in the steamer, over hoiling water, which must be kept briskly boiling until the potatoes are thoroughly done, the length of time depending very much on their size. I am aware that it is not in the power of all to possess a potato-steamer, although one may be purchased at Adams & Son’s, in the Haymarket, for a few shillings; and therefore I will give you instructions how to boil potatoes. No. 136, How to Boil Potatoes. Wash the potatoes clean, and put them on to boil in a saucepan, with cold water just enough to cover them; place the saucepan on the hob, close to the fire, and allow them to remain in that position for a quarter of an hour, by Avhich time the water will have gradually reached to the boiling point; the saucepan should now be allowed to boil until the potatoes are done through, and then pour ofl* the water; put the lid on again with a cloth on the top, place the sauce- pan close to the fire for about five minutes, and when you turn them out on their dish you will find that you have a well-boiled, mealy potato before you.

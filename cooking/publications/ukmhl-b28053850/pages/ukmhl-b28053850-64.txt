Put the fish on in sufficient water to cover it, add a small handful of salt, and, providing that the fish is not larger than mackerel, soles, or whiting, it will be cooked by the time that the water boils. Yet it is always best to try whether it requires to boil a little longer, as underdone fish is unwholesome. Boiled fish requires some kind of sauce. Try the fol- lowing, viz:â€” No. 127. Pakslet Sauce. Chop a handful of parsley and mix it in a stew- pan with two ounces of butter, two ounces of flour, pepper and salt; moisten with half a pint of w'ater and a table-spoonful of vinegar. Stir the parsley- sauce on the fire till it boils, and then pour it over the fish, drained free from water, on its dish. No. 128. Anchovy Sauce. Mix two ounces of butter with twm ounces of flour, in a saucepan. Add a spoonful of essence of anchovy, and half a pint of water. Stir the sauce on the fire till it boils. No. 129. Baked Skate. Chop three onions, and fry them of a light-brown colour in two ounces of butter, then add half a pint of vinegar, pepper and salt, and allow the whole to boil on the fire for five minutes. Put the skate in a bak- ing dish, pour the sauce over it, and also just enough water to reach to its surface. Strew a thick coating of bread-raspings on the fish, and bake it for an hour and a half at rather moderate heat.

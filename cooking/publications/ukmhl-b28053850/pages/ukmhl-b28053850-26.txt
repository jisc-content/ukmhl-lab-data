COOKEET BOOK 26 The rubbing-in must be repeated four or five succes- sive mornings, and the hams must remain in this pickle for ten days longer. No. 31. How TO Smoke Hams. When the hams have been well pickled, as shown in the preceding number, they must be pressed between boards with heavy stones to render them flat; the hams should remain in press for twenty-four hours; and, at the end of that time, must be well rubbed all over with peasemeal mixed with a little salt; they are then to be smoked in a close shed or in the chimney, burning for that purpose some branches of juniper or any other wood, and some sawdust. The smoking must last five days. The hams, when suffici- ently smoked, must be kept in a cool place. They will not be ripe for cooking before six months after their curing. Eemember that a couple of well-cured hams, kept in reserve for a case of need, will always prove a ready means to realize some twenty-five shillings towards paying the rent, etc. No. 32. How TO Cube Bacon. Mind that your pickling-trough is well scalded out before using it for pickling the bacon. Allow at the rate of four ounces of salt to every pound of meat, and to every ten pounds of salt six ounces of saltpetre, two ounces of salprunella, and eight ounces of sugar; rub the salt, etc., well into the bacon every morning for twelve successive days ; and at the end of that time, let the sides of bacon be pressed between boards with heavy stones placed upon them to keep them flat; and at the end of twenty-four hours, rub them over with peasemeal in which there has been mixed a little salt, and smoke the bacon in the same manner as the hams ; and thus, by timely thriftiness, you will be provided with a meat dinner for a long while.

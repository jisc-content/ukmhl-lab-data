FOE THE -WOEKING CLASSES. 49 fish, put the lid on the saucepan, and set the whole on the hob of a moderate fire, or in the oven, if you have one, to remain simmering for about half an hour; the curry will then be ready to be eaten with well-boiled rice.

I recommend you to buy Patna rice, as it is the cheapest; it is best to soak it in water overnight, as it then requires less time to boil it, and moreover, when soaked, the rice becomes lighter, from the fact that the grains separate more readily while boil- ing. Put the rice on to boil in plenty of cold water, stirring it from the bottom of the saucepan occasionally while it is boiling fast; when the grains separate at the ends, and thus appear to form the letter X, the rice will be done; it requires about half an hourâ€™s gentle boiling. When the rice is done, drain it in a colander, and place it before the fire, stirring it now aiid then with a fork. No. 93. IlicE Dumplihgs, Boil one pound of rice as directed in the foregoing Number, and when thoroughly drained free from ex- cess of moisture, knead the rice with a spoon in a basin into a smooth, compact kind of paste, and use this to cover some peeled apples with in the same way as you would make an ordinary apple dumpling. In order the better to enable you to handle the rice-paste with ease, I recommend that each time previously to shaping one of the dumplings, you should first dip your clean hands in cold water. Let the dump- lings, when finished, be tied up in small cloths, and boiled in plenty of hot water for about three-quarters of an hour. The cloths used for these dumplings must be greased. D

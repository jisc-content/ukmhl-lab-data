71 FOR THE WORKINa CLASSES. No. 137. Baked or Boasted Potatoes. You do not require that I should tell you that when you have no oven you can easily roast your po- tatoes by placing them on the hobs, bars, and under the fire-grate ; and if you are attentive to their being well roasted, by turning them about now and then, BO that they may be done all over alike, you need not be deprived of a baked potato for the want of an oven. When the potatoes are roasted, slightly squeeze each separately in a cloth, to make them mealy, then split them open ; season them with a bit of butter, or dripping, a little bit of chopped shalot, pepper, and salt, and this will aftbrd you a nice relish for supper. No. 138. How TO Pry Potatoes. Peel, split, and cut the potatoes into slices of eqiial thickness, say the thickness of two penny pieces; and as they are cut out of hand, let them be dropped into a pan of cold water. When about to fry the potatoes, first drain them on a clean cloth, and dab them all over, in order to absorb all moisture ; while this has been going on, you will have made some kind of fat (entirely free from water or gravy, such as lard, for instance) very hot in a frying-pan, and into tin’s drop your prepared potatoes, only a good handful at a time; as, if you attempt to fry too many at once, instead of being crisp, as they should be, the potatoes will fry flabby, and consequently will be unappetising. As soon as the first lot is fried in a satisfactory man- ner, drain them from the fat with a skimmer, or spoon, and then fry the remainder; and when all are fried, shake a little salt over them. No. 139. How TO Pry Potatoes an easier Way. When it happens that you have some cold boiled potatoes, this is the way to fry them:—

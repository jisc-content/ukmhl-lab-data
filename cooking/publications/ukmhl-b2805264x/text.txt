LUNCHEON DISHES.LUNCHEON DISHES COMPRISING MENUS IN FRENCH AND ENGLISH FOR FOUR COMPLETE LUNCHEONS FOR SIX PERSONS AS WELL AS SUGGESTIONS FOR APPROPRIATE ARRANGEMENT AND DECORATION OF THE TABLE FOR THE FOUR SEASONS SPRING, SUMMER, AUTUMN, AND WINTER BY MARY L. ALLEN AUTHOR OF “ breakfast DISHES,’’ “ SAVOURIES AND SWEETS," AND “ FIVE o’clock tea.” / LONDON KEGAN PAUL, TRENCH, TRUBNER & CO., Ltd. 1891'22(L<a5o(- WELLCOME INSTITUTE LIBRARY Coll. welMOmec Call No. 9T %PREFACE. It having been suggested to me that a collection of Menus for easily-prepared Luncheon Dishes would be appreciated by the Public, I have brought out the accompanying little book on the subject. Many of the receipts contained in it are obtained from family MSS. (one dating as far back as 1696), a few of the receipts are original, and several are new. I have given the cost of each dish, as far as possible, and have arranged the Menus with regard to the season of the year. As regards decorations for the table, I have purposely omitted suggesting anything elaborate, because I consider that, however appropriate decorations maybe for “dinner,” luncheon being a daylight meal, the less the spotless linen of the table is hidden from view, except by fruit and flowers, the better is the taste displayed by the hostess. I want to take this opportunity of thanking MrsPREFACE 6 Bagot for the valuable help she has given me in the present collection of receipts, as in a previous publication, viz., “Savouries and Sweets,” which has met with considerable appreciation by the public.INDEX.

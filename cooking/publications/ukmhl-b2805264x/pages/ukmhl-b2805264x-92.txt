LUNCHEON DISHES. 88 APPLE JELLY OR QUINCE. Ingredients. Average Cost. s. D. 36 apples, 26 I pint of water, I lemon, 01 2 7 RECEIPT. 1. Peel and core and slice thirty-six large apples, add one pint of water, and place into a stone jar. 2. Stew gently, until quite soft, with the thinly- cut peel of a lemon and the juice. 3. Strain through a flannel jelly-bag, but do not allow the bag to be touched after the fruit is put into it, as the jelly must be quite clear. 4. Make the sugar hot in a copper preserving- pan, and then add the juice to it. 5. Boil for thirty minutes or until the syrup jellies. 6. Pour hot into pots, and tie down. N.B.â€”A mixture of apple and quince is very good, but the quinces require longer stewing than the apples, so that the latter should be added one hour after the former. The best pots for putting the jelly into are small ones, the size and shape of old china tea-cups, so that the jelly, when required for use, will turn out a pretty round shape.

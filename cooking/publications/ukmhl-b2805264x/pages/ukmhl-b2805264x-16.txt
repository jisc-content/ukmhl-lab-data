12 TABLE DECORATIONS FOR SUMMER. SUMMER. I. Table Decorations. â€” Procure an oval-shaped piece of looking-glass and lay it in the centre of the table, surround it with little green enamelled troughs made of tin. Fill them with feathery moss and maidenhair fern, and stick in a few sprigs of forget-me-nots as if they were growing. On the looking-glass put a flat oval-shaped glass dish, which fill with waterlilies opened out and resting on the water (the stalks must be cut off close to the heads, to make them lie flat); between the lilies place a few forget-me-nots, and lightly veil the whole with fronds of maidenhair. II. On a handsome piece of drawn linen work set a large blue china bowl in which roses of all colours are tastefully arranged. By the table napkin of each guest, place a rose- bud and foliage, alternately red and yellow. Let sweetmeats of the colours of the roses used for decoration be arranged in small blue china saucers about the table.

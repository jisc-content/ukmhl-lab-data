14 table decorations for autumn. AUTUMN. I. Table Decorations. — On an oblong piece of white satin embroidered in gold, place a tall trumpet-shaped green glass vase in hammered iron frame-work; arrange on it lightly field poppies and grasses. Round the embroidered table centre trail some well-coloured blackberry sprays and leaves, forming a handsome cluster of berries and leaves at one corner. II. Use a d’oyley of fine drawn linen work for the centre of the table. Stand an oblong wicker basket in the middle of it, painted dead white. Decorate the basket with coloured leaves and the deep red berries of the b'ryony, twining a cluster round the handle. Place four similar white baskets (but of much smaller size) at the corners of the table, arranged to correspond. Fill a dozen small silver gilt or brass bowls with red, yellow, and brown sweetmeats, and place them about the table. Each bowl should have a minia- ture pair of sugar tongs laid by the side of it for helping the bonbons.

lO TABLE DECORATIONS FOR SPRING. SPRING. I. Table Decorations.â€”Take an oblong piece of drawn linen work handsomely embroidered in white between the drawings. It should be yards long and nearly half a yard wide. On it, stand down the centre of the table three tall slender glass vases mounted in ornamental copper work. Arrange some sprays of pink almond blossom in the vases. Procure six or eight little copper plates or saucers, and fill them with the fashionable American bonbons in brown and pink colours. Tie up six small sprays of almond blossom with copper-coloured ribbon, and lay them on the table- cloth, on either side of the drawn linen work strip. II. Fill three oval-shaped silver baskets with mauve and white lilac, and stand them down the centre of the table. Tie twelve small sprays of the same flower with apple green ribbon, and lay two before each guest, alternately mauve and white.

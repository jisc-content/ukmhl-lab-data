Trim neatly eight cutlets from a neck of veni- son, leaving an inch of bone bare. 2. Put the trimmings and bacon into a closely- covered stone jar with the stock and all the season- ing, except the currant jelly and wine. 3. Cook it like a custard in a sauce-pan of boiling water for 2\ hours, 4. Fry the cutlets until brown in butter, 5. Strain the sauce, put the port wine into it, and re-heat it (as venison must always be smoking hot when served), 6. Dish up the cutlets on a silver hot-water dish, 7. Pour the sauce round them. 8. Garnish with toast sippets and slices of pickled melon or gerkin heated, and hand the jelly. N.B.—It is a good plan, to ensure the plates bring very hot (as is necessary when venison is to be served), to place a soup plate before each guest, fill it with boiling, water and lay thr hot plate to be used upon it.

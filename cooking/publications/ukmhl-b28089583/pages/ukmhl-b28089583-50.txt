CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 36 The next important feature for consideration in soup- making is the adding of ■wine, -which, I think, may be regarded as very essential. Madeira or Marsala is better than sherry for most soups. A rich, full, fruity -wine,—■ inexpensive for -want of age, and scarcely to be recom- mended for after dinner drinking,—is the class best adapted for kitchen use. If sherry be preferred, it ought to be a fruity one, and sound, not a cheap extraordinary compound, composed of molasses, washings of sherry casks, and the most -villainous brandy; but honest sherry, lacking age, perhaps, yet hond fide wine. “ There is a good saying,” observes an author on cookery, that is appropriate here :— “ It is no use spoiling the ship for the sake of a ha’porth of tar,”—it is, I think, no use spoiling a good soup for the sake of a spoonful of wine.” Be careful, however, not to overdo the soupQon of -wine that you add to a clear soup ; a good table-spoonful is, to my mind, enough for a tureen filled for eight persons. Thick soups, especially those made of game, mock-turtle, giblet, kidney, and the like, take a larger share of wine : hare soup requires port or burgimdy, -wild duck and teal soup also, whilst potages of snipe, partridges, quails, jungle-fowls, &c., are, I think, better enriched with Madeira, or Marsala. I have hitherto purposely omitted saying anything con- cerning the treatment of the meat and vegetables of which a pot-au-feu is made, being anxious to keep strictly to the subject which we have been discussing,—the cookery of a clear consomme. Before I go on with soup-making, how- ever, I beg par parenthese as it were, to turn back to that period in the preparation of the soup when we strained the consomme from the meat, bones, and vegetables, which had made it. In the Madras kitchen the soup-meat is regarded,' I ; believe, as the perquisite of the cook’s maty, which, being j interpreted, may be understood to mean really that of the j

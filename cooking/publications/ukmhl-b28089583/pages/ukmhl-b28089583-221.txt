207 SALADS. garlic, and two ordinary capsicums finely minced, make, when added to half a pint of tarragon vinegar, an invalu- able element of salad dressing. In speaking of capsicums, I only allude to the skin, not to the pith or seeds. A very few drops of the strongly flavoured vinegars I have described are, of course, ample to “ animate the bowl.” A cook’s ingenuity will aid him in concocting other varieties easily enough. When made, cork your bottle down tightly, seal it with wax, and set it in the sun,—an operation which presents but little difficulty in this country. In a week or two, you may strain the liquid, and take it into use. An excellent salad is that made by slicing raw ripe tomatoes, with a Bombay onion. The dressing given should be like that recommended for lettuce, only that, your al- lowance of oil must be abundant; and, inasmuch as tomatoes are sweet, there may be a little freer use of the vinegar cruet. As in all salads, tarragon, or any aromatic vinegar, may be employed advantageously in this one, and minced fines herbes may be sprinkled over the whole. Strips of green capsicum harmonize most pleasantly with a tomato salad. This is obviously a dish for the sterner sex, and one which no man would partake of just before a ball, on his wedding day, or at all during the halcyon period which generally precedes that ceremony. O ! why is our rose thus thornily encumbered ? Why was it ordained that man should never eat of the fragrant bulb without remem- bering it to his sorrow ? I once heard an amateur cook say tliat the forbidden fruit in the garden of Eden rmist have been an onion. “ Hence,” said he, “ the curse it cai’ries with it, and hence the universal dislike with which it is regarded by the ladies.” But this man was a free thinker.

121 BOILING AND STEAMING. Somewliat similar in treatment is the process of Jugging. There is, I think, a dish called by Ramasamy “ boiled chaffs" (boiled chops), cooked in this manner, which is familiar to every one in this part of India, and really deserving of attention, for it is susceptible of improvement, and far greater development. A nice steak; a dish of neck cutlets ; the blade bone of the shoulder, boned and flattened; a tender fowl, boned and flattened ; game simi- larly prepared, and even fish, can thus be dressed very daintily.

With the trimmings of meat and bone make a broth, assisted by an onion, some pepper corns, any scraps of beef, chicken bones, cold game, lean ham or bacon, in short any useful sundries. When done, skim, and strain it, you ought to have a breakfast-cupful of it.

CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 68 spoonful of water, well beaten together. Then turn it over and over in a plateful of fine, stale bread-crumbs which have been dried in the oven, pounded, and thoroughly sifted. It should then be laid aside for half an hour, after which it should be dipped again, and again rolled in ci’umbs. Amongst the crumbs may be sprinkled some finely-minced parsley and shallot, with Bome powdered dried sweet herbs, and grated cheese is sometimes added with marked effect. The frying should be conducted in abund- ance of boiling fat, and the colour of the cutlets should be a pale golden brown. All thrifty cooks should carefully save the scraps of trimmings, the outer flap, and the ends of bone, which were cut off in shaping the cutlets, for from them the basis of the sauce which is to accompany the dish can, with a little assistance, be composed. Veal is occasionally procurable at Madras. If you suc- ceed in getting a nice dish of cutlets, remember that it is downright necessary to lard them with strips of fat bacon. Veal is apt to be dry in England where the calf is fattened for the market. In India it is far drier, and if cooked without the assistance of bacon, veal cutlets are positively wooden. N.B.—Let the sauce prepared for your entree of cutlets be sent round, piping hot, in a boat. If poured round the cutlets, it makes them sodden, and loses its effect entirely.

144 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 5. —“ A la creme" :—served with a coffee-cupful of boil- ing cream poured over them. 6. —“ A la poulette" :—sent to table with a libation of good poulette sauce. Cold greens of all kinds, especially sprouts, are exceed- ingly nice eaten plain with a tartare sauce accompanying them. A dressing of oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, and minced shallot is also a happy way of improving them ; and I can recommend you to try this :—cut some slices of bread into fancy shapes, or simple oblongs ; fry them in butter a golden brown, spread over them some hot minced greens, or pieces of sprouts, and serve them with a nice brown sauce, or with a layer of “ buttered-eggs” on the top of the greens. Cabbages of all kinds can be served a la puree, and in that way make a capital homely soup, or a pleasant accom- paniment to an entree. The CAULIFLOWER (Chou-fietir) is, of course, the queen of the cabbage kind, and well deserves our most careful consideration. In plain treatment, what I have said for cabbages generally, holds good for this vegetable also, viz. :—draining in salt and water, careful picking, and, if to be boiled, plunging into boiling water, with a tiny bit of soda to preserve the green tint of the leaves. When, boiled, or steamed, which is the better way, you must watch them carefully lest they be overdone. You can serve cauliflowers with a variety of sauces. Cut the stalk flat so that the cauliflower can sit up, as it were, the flower in the centre, and the leaves round it, pour about it a good tomato sauce, or a plain sauce blanche, bechamel, or sauce piquante, and dust some finely rasped crumbs over the whole.

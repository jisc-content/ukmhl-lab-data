123 BOILING AND STEAMING. In my last chapter I dwelt upon the invaluable culinary process known as braising, and tried to point out the special adaptability of that method of cookery to the treat- ment of the small and often indifferently fed meat of this country. I did not however allude to a simpler yet scarcely less noteworthy kind of braise by which is produced that very excellent dish called BCEUF 'a la MODE : There is per- haps no name in the Trench vocabulary de cuisine more frequently “ taken in vain” by English cooks, as well as by poor Ramasamy, than this. As a rule they apply the term to a joint of cold roast beef when warmed up en rechauffe, and sent to table smothered with a thick sauce browned with burnt onion, and surrounded by sodden vegetables ! Now, hoeuf d la mode is very far from being a rechauff'e. On the contrary, it is a carefully selected piece of fresh meat scientifically stewed with vegetables. Its rich, self-made gravy is not thickened, and its garnish should be composed of vegetables separately trimmed and cooked for that purpose. No better recipe can possibly be found than that given by Grouffe quoted by Sir Henry Thompson as follows :— “ Take about 4 lbs. (2 kilos') of thick beefsteak cut square. Take nearly f lb. (3 hectos) of raw fat bacon, cut off the rind, which should be put aside to blanche, and then cut the bacon in strips for larding, about one-third of an inch thick, and sprinkle them with pepper. Lard the meat, and tie it up as for the pot-au-feu. Place the piece of meat in a stew-pan with rather less than a pint of white wine, a wine-glass of brandy, a pint of stock, a pint of water, two calves’ feet already boned and blanched, and the rind of the bacon also blanched. Put it on the fire adding a little less than one ounce of salt (30 grammes). Make it boil, and skim it as for pot-au-f eu; next, having skimmed it, add fully one pound (500 grammes) of carrots.

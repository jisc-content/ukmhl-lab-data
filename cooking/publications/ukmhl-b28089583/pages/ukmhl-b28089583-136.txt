122 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. musliroom ketchup, a salt-spoonful of salt, and the same of sugar. Pepper the chops pretty freely with black pepper before covering them. When arranged, pour in the broth, and seal the lid of the tin, all round the rim, with stiff paste, fixing it securely. Now, put the tin into boiling water, and keep it on the fixe for two hours. At the time of serving, the lid should be cut off, and the tin, wrapped in a napkin, should be placed upon an ordinary dish, and sent to table immediately. Follow the same directions in “ jugging” a steak, or a blade bone: in the case of the boned fowl, a little bacon, or some sliced bologna sausage, will be found an improve- ment, the broth being made, of course, from the bones and giblets. With game birds I would add a little sweet herb seasoning. Fish should be done in this way:—Trim the fish in fillets, season them with pepper and salt, cover the bottom of the tin with slices of Bombay onion, dotting in a dozen pepper corns, and two cloves; put a layer of fillets over the onion, and pepper them with black pepper; put in now a layer of sliced tomatoes, sprinkle some roughly-chopped curled parsley over them,-and a table-spoonful of chopped capsicums ; pour in a little broth made from the fish bones and trimmings, with a glass of chablis, sauterne, or hock, cover the tin closely, and boil. A clove of garlic may be introduced in this dish by those who appreciate the faint- est suspicion of that fragrant bulb, and the fine rind of a lime also. If made of two or thi’ee sorts of little fishes, with a pinch of saffron, and, instead of the broth, a libation com- posed of one table-spoonful of salad oil, two table-spoonfuls of chablis, and three of water, the effect will be'pleasing to those who have eaten, and enjoyed a bouillabaisse, for the broth produced by the fish and ingredients I have named is not unlike that excellent composition. ^

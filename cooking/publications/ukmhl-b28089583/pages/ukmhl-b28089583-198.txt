184 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. preserved tunny, a piece of lax, or nicely tinned salmon will be found an agreeable substitute, and cod’s roes will form a pleasant companion thereto. The Cure used fresh tunny, and fresh roes, but we may follow his recipe with preserved substitutes, if not too salt, and achieve a very fair result. Kippered seer-fish, made at home, with Madi’as fish-roe well soaked, ought to make a capital omelette of this kind. The seer-fish should be split, washed, and dried with a cloth; salt, sugar, and lime-juice being well rubbed in immediately ; the next day the rubbing must be repeated, and the fish artificially smoked by being hung over a fire constantly replenished with damp straw, &c. After this, it should be hung in the cook-room over the fire, and it will be ready for the table the third evening. If you can get fresh roe so much the better ; if not, Madras preserved roe, well soaked and boiled till tender, will be found an excellent substitute. j Omelettes may be cooked aux fines herbes, served upon a ’la bed of tomato puree, and dusted • over with grated cheese. | ] They may also be laid upon a puree of green peas, or of ; ■ spinach. They may be improved with minced game, and |J be associated effectively with mince of any kind. Chop- * j ped mushrooms or truffles (previously cooked, minced, and ■» | tossed in butter) are, of course, very delicious additions to them; and oysters may be introduced in the same way. Savoury omelettes are sent up with rich Espagnole, Peri- gueux, and Bechamel sauces, and may contain some finely f & minced kidney stewed in champagne. Almost all fish, ^ | prawns, lobster, &c., go well with them, and whether ? simple or elaborate, plain or rich, an omelette rarely fails, > —if properly made,—to win appreciation, and be thank- ] | fully accounted for.

Or, you can, when half-boiled, drain them diy, and bake them upon a well-buttered tin, serving them with plain melted butter, a dressing of oil, vinegar, minced shallot ■ ^ and salt, or any satice piquante you fancy. ; But, like the cauliflower, the Jerusalem artichoke is j : worthy of the epicure’s attention when sent up “ mt . ] gratin.” The combination being a puree of plain boiled y artichoke, slightly diluted with cream, and seasoned with ■> pepper, and salt: this, turned into a well-buttered pie-dish, its surface dusted over with finely grated mild cheese, and .»■ the whole baked until the top takes colour. Good milk ' with the yolks of two eggs may take the place of cream, ‘ or a satice blanche, but if perfection be desired, pray use cream. Instead of using a pie-dish the puree may be baked in some well-buttered coquille shells, and served upon a napkin. « ; ! V ■ vJ A

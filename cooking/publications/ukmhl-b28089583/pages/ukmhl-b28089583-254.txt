CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 240 Jerusalem artichokes, trim, boil, and set them to cool ; take four hard-boiled eggs, and cut them in halves ; out of the artichokes prepare eight flat slices, and place half an egg upon each slice with the rounded end uppermost: set them on a buttered dish, heat them thoroughly in the oven, and just before serving, pour over them some thickly worked “ veloute au Parmesan,” or some melted maitre d’hotel butter. A dusting of “ spiced salt” should be given on taking the eggs from the oven. This entremets is nicer still with artichoke bottoms,—the leafy kind, and with ceufs farcis instead of plain hard- boiled eggs. Maccaroni, and the numerous varieties of the Italian paste family of which it is the best known member, should invariably be plunged into boiling water to commence with—no matter whether you intend to cook them in milk, or stock, afterwards—in order to rid them of the imper- ceptible dirt which clings to them. Remember that mac- caroni is a much handled comestible, and that washing it in water is not enough. I adverted to this when speaking of soups (page 34), and described how the cleansing can alone be effected. Besides, maccaroni must not be wetted to begin with by any liquid not boiling. Mark these golden rules :—“ Washing maccai’oni is use- less and unnecessary, putting it to cook in cold water is a blunder, soaking it is a crime.” Treat it as our native cooks do rice,—here let me yield to Ramasamy, or his tunnycutch (?) the praise that either he, or she, deserves, and throw it into plenty of boiling water, test it occasion- ally with a fork, as soon as it is nice and tender, stop the boiling by a dash of cold water, lift the vessel, and drain it completely, retuiming the maccaroni to the hot pan. If you want to cook Italian pastes in milk or stock,

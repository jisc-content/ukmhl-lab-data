This leads me to an important point in most thick soups, and purees, and that is the addition of cream, or milk with the yolks of eggs. It will be found in some recipes for these soups that hoiled cream is ordered to be added. The distinction is important: not merely is the risk of curdling avoided, but the flavour imparted to the potage is different. All know, for example, how different is the taste of coffee that is made with boiling milk, from that to which cold mflk has been added.

Observe the absence of any ready-made sauce in the con- coction of this simple composition. A little ‘ spiced pepper’ was sprinkled over the layers of meat, and some very finely chopped thyme and marjoram,—about a tea-spoonful in all,—was shaken over them also. The joints of chicken were those usually cut up for a curry.

I did not put in any wine; I had no mush- rooms, and nothing expensive was used. Instead of the lean pickled' pork,-ham, leanish bacon, tongue, sliced Bologna sausage, or even slices of juicy corned beef, might have been used. A little consideration will enable the composer to vary both the contents and the flavour of his pies from time to time.

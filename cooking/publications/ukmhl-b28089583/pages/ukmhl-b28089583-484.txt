IvIElsTXJ 3STO- ♦ For a little home dinner. Potage a la pm-ee de legumes. Darne de seer au gratin. Pintade au cresson. Haricots verts panaches. Croustades de bandecai. Beignets de bananes au rhum. Fromage, hors d’ceuvi’es. Dessert. Cafe noir. Vegetable Puree. 1.—Prepai-e early in the day the usual gravy soup, or stock, that you order daily: take it off the fire in the afternoon, and add two carrots, a turnip, an onion, a stick of celery, and a little pepper and salt. Boil together: when thoroughly done, drain off the soup and pass the boiled vegetables through the wire sieve. Now mix over the fire in a sauce- pan an ounce of butter, and a dessert-spoonful of flour, gradually adding vegetable pulp and stock, and stirring well, until you have exhausted the whole. Let it come to the boil. After you have taken the soup off the fire, stir in the yolk of an egg beaten up in a little milk: fried croutons of bread should accompany this soup.

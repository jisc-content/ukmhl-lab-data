284 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. broth, flavoured with a glass of Madeira, some sweet herhs, pepper, salt, and a little nutmeg. Remove the sauce-pan from the fire, and when the liquid is cold, pick out the truffles (they will do for any other dish), and strain the cold essence. After having poured the essence into the pie, let it get quite cold, then turn it out of the tin, put it upon a napkin, and serve. If made with uncooked seer fish instead of salmon, the pie will he found excellent. There are, of course, many other pies concerning which I could give advice, I am, however, pretty confident that if you hear in mind the principles I have tried to make clear, you will rarely fail to succeed in composing a very eatable ‘ pasty,’ and win approval from those for whose delect- ation you may exercise your ingenuity. On the Hills, at Bangalore, and at many of the stations of this Presidency during the cold months, every one of the pies I have described will be found when cold to contain firm jelly,—not liquid gravy. If you desire to produce that cheerful effect at Madras, do not forget to place the pie upon ice for some little time before the meal at which it is to appear. The jelly is, of course, the united result of good gravy, and the juices of the various meats in the pie extracted by baking. During the hot weather on the plains, if you cannot ice the pie, it will be found a good plan to pour off the gravy after it has left the table, hot. This will prevent the meat turning sour. The gravy can be heated the next morning, and the pie can be warmed up. Cold pie, with- out artificial cold imparted by ice, is an impossibility with the thermometer at 90 °. ♦

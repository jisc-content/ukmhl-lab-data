PEEFACE TO THE FIFTH EDITION. —♦— f HE Jottings have again undergone very careful revision. By pruning unnecessary matter, and simplifying the recipes wherever possible, space has been found for considerable addi- tions without adding materially to the bulk or cost of the book. It is hoped that the endeavours thus made to effect improve- ment may prove successful, and that the public by whom the four earlier editions have been so kindly received will have reason to be satisfied with Wyvern.

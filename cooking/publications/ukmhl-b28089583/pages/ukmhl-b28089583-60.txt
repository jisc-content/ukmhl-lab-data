46 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. Himilar; the main difference, of course, consists in the sort of meat used, and the employment of roux, or liaison as the case may be. Roux is simply melted butter, with flour added to it, according to the quantity of soup you want to thicken. The butter must be melted first, the flour being dredged in by degrees, and stirred vigorously at the bottom of the sauce-pan until thoroughly incorporated, and velvety. As soon as it turns brown, the roux is ready. This is what is wanted for brown soups. For a white, the liaison must not be allowed to take colour; you must commence adding the soup to it as soon as the flour and butter have been sufficiently worked together. In making these soups, the utmost care should be taken not to over-do the thickening. In the case of a white soup, this error is almost more fatal than in that of a brown. You might as well offer your guest a basin of arrowroot “ conjee,” or any nice gruel, for the savoury flavour of the soup is easily overpowered. A little prac- tice will teach a cook how much flour, is necessary to obtain the desired consistency of a thick soup, and he should bear in mind that the full effect of the thickening does not assert itself until the soup, which has been added to it, comes to the boil. Observe that you add the soup to the roux, not the roux to the soup. The addmg should be done by degrees, if you want the soup to be smooth and creamy. If, after coming to the boil, you find the soup too thin, you must proceed as follows :—mix a little more ro«« very carefully in a small sauce-pan, add a cupful of the soup to it, and when quite smooth, and free from lumps, pour it by degrees into the soup, off the fire, through a pointed gi’avy strainer, stirring vigorously as you do so. W hen quite mixed, replace the vessel on the fii’e, and let it boil up.

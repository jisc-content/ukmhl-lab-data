281 A FEW NICE PIES. good gravy. Beef,—tlie tender undercut, or rib-meat, forms tbe best basis you can devise: it should be cut up into collops, as I have frequently said before, and strips of bacon should be rolled round them. Or you can use the blade-bone collops of good mutton just described, or the neck cutlets; each cutlet should be trimmed neatly, with a strip of bacon wrapped round it. Excellent gravy can be obtained from the scraps left after trimming the beef or the cutlets, the remnants of the birds not wanted in the pie, and a pound of gravy meat, with the usual vegetables, and other flavouring ingredients often describ- ed. A little wine is almost a sine qua non with these game birds: Madeira, sound brown sherry, or any white wine—of which a glass is quite enough. A good “ Game pie” is a capital thing for the luncheon, or breakfast party. Snipe, quails, partridges, hares, pigeons, teal, wild duck, &c., &c., can be thus disposed of most advantageously: they must be assisted by tender beef, or good mutton collops ; slices of bacon, of ham, or of Bologna sausage must be introduced, and the gravy must be very attentively composed. A forcemeat made thus will be found undeniably valuable:—take the livers of all the game composing the pie, and make the composition de- scribed elsewhere as “ foie-gras iovcemesbi,” truffles and all, using the game livers instead of that of a calf. When ready, you can use it as follows :—spread a layer of it over the bottom of the pie-dish, and up the sides also : what remains should be introduced here and there amongst the layers of meat during the packing operations. As the game must be boned in the case of this particular dish, we shall have to mash all the bones with the pestle, and throw them into our stock-pot. Take a pound and a half of gravy beef, the mashed game bones, a bacon or ham bone, (or a few slices of either) two sheep’s feet cut up, and the vegetables generally used in soup-making, with a

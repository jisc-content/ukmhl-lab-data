PASTRY-MAKING, ET CETERA. 265 in, see that tlie flour is good and dry, the butter Arm and free from moisture, and All two shallow baking-tins with broken ice. Put the flour on a cool slab, mixing into it a heaped up tea-spoonful of the baking powder; when mixed, form the flour in a ring, as it were, and in the centre throw the yolk of an egg and a tea-spoonful of salt; add a little iced water, and gradually work the flour into it from the inside of the ring, sprinkling additional water as you requii-e it—about one breakfast-cupful altogether— until you have a smooth, flne dough, free from all sticki- ness. Pat this into a lump, and put it in the ice-box for a quarter of an hour, then roll it out about the size of a dinner plate ; put the butter upon it, and wrap the edges of the dough over it, carefully covering it: now turn it upside down, and roll it out very thin; reverse it again, and fold it in three. Place it after this on a baking-sheet- over one of the pans of broken ice, and put the other pan of ice %ipon it. Repeat this cooling process between each double turn, and use as soon as possible when flve turns have been completed. Although composed for English and American kitchens, observe the use of ice advocated in this receipt. Instead of the butter I would try the clarifled beef suet, that is to say, if I were unable to procure butter of undeniable quality, firm, cold, and quite free from water. The next description of pastry that demands our atten- tion is that which should be used for savoury pies, to • PiE-CTUJST. In this, I think, Ramasamy needs care- ful instruction. He makes no difEerence between his sa- voury pie ‘ suet-crust,” and that which he sends up under the name of a vol-au-vent. His chief aim being a pie- covering, raised an inch and a half or two inches high, composed of the harsh, talc-like layers to which I have already alluded. I need hardly point out that this is an entirely erroneous impression. Think of the cold pic^con-

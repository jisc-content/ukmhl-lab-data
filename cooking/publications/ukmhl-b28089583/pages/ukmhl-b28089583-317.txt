CURRIES—CONTINUED. 303 Old Indian cookery books give a number of recipes for KUBAB curries, for tbe most part of purely native design, and requiring condiments and ingredients which were per- haps appreciated by our forefathers who adopted an almost Oriental method of life. The best kubdb, to my mind, is one made of tender mutton or veal, and treated as fol- lows :— Cut the mutton into thickish pieces, about an inch square and half an inch thick j cut out of some slices of good bacon some pieces an inch square also, but about a quarter the thickness of the mutton ; cut up some pieces of parboiled white onion upon the same pattern as the bacon, and some thin slices of green ginger to match. Impale these mixed pieces upon small plated or silver skewers, or upon thinly-cut wooden ones, maintaining the order I have given, viz., first a piece of mutton, then a piece of bacon, then a bit of onion, and lastly, the thin slice of green ginger. Having repeated this until the skewer is filled, go on with another. When all have been completed, the Jmbdbs should be simmered in a good curry sauce as recommended for chicken curry. Before being added to the sauce, however, they should be lightly tossed in butter in a saute--p&n with an onion sliced, a tea-spoonful of salt and one of sugar. The introduction of the slice of bacon IS a very great improvement. The “ QUOOEMA,” if well made, is undoubtedly an excel- lent curry. It used, I believe, to be one of the best at the Madras Club, in days when curries commanded closer attention than they do now. Cut up about a pound, of very tender mntton without nny bone, and stir the pieces about in a big bowl with a dessert-spoonful of pounded green ginger, and a sprinkling of salt. Melt a quarter of a pound of butter in a stew- pan, and throw into it a couple of white onions cut into

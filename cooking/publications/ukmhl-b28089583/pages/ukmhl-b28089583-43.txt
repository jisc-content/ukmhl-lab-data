Preserved fish is not required at Madras, and we can get on without tinned meats, soups, and potted luxuries, for we can make better things at home. In sweet things, however, we are not so independent, and jams, jellies, tart-fruits, dried and candied peel, currants, raisins, ginger, &c., &c., must all have room in the house-keeper’s cupboard. Of the invaluable qualities to the Anglo-Indian of good tinned butter, I shall speak on a future occasion. In a chapter on stores it is impossible to pass over, without a few words of commendation, the excellent pre- served fish, vegetables, and fruits, which have, of late, been imported from America. Besides being capital in quality these “ canned” delicacies are decidedly cheap. The old English firms have now to compete with dangerous rivals. Let them look to their laurels. Messrs. Brand & Co.’s preparations for invalids, potted meats, soups, and strong essences of beef, chicken, &c., are specialites in their way vastly superior to anything for- merly in the market of a like description. Messrs. Moir and Son have however taken up the subject recently with great success.

209 SALADS. salad-maker works by measure. As soon as you have got a creamy, well-flavoured sauce to suit your fancy, strain it through the little block tin strainer to get rid of every lump, and the little bits of onion. This should be done over the sauce-boat, which should be put into the ice box as soon as it is filled.

You have in the former case only to pick the meat out of the lettuce leaves, and place it on a separate dish. The plain salad I first mentioned must, of course, be mixed the very last thing before dinner, unless you can

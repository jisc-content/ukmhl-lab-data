I have more than once alluded to “ heignets" in previous chapters, and receipts for several will be found amongst my menus. The Jcrainousl-y* is, I think, the prince of all savoury fritters, and is susceptible of being composed in. many delicious ways. The oyster, pounded shell fish, minced fish of any kind, sweet-breads (when you can get them) or any delicately composed mince o^ fowl, or of meat, with tongue or ham, can be thus turned to an artistic account.

The bacon should be previously cooked, and cut into thin slices, two and a half inches long, and one and a half deep : two oysters, or a heaped up tea-spoonful of any salpicon, should be laid in the centre of each : the bacon must then be folded over it very neatly, and kept ready for the dipping process, which must be carried out cautiously. The frying should be conducted as already described. If you wish to/tnake JcramousJcys of chicken, turkey, or game, you sho]^ld mince the meat coarsely, the pieces being cut like little dice, bind the mince with the yolks of a couple of eggs or more, according to the quantity of the mince, and stir into it, in a sauce-pan on the fire, a little I’ichly made veloute ; let this get quite cold, and firm, then divide it into little portions and fill your bacon slices, ^linced truffles, and mushrooms, are, of course, undeniable improvements to any salpicon, * * Generally written ‘ Kromeaky,’ ‘ or cromesqni.’ I have adopted a different spelling having been assured by a friend whose anthoritv is unimpeachable that the dish is of llussian origin, and its name “ Kra- mousky.

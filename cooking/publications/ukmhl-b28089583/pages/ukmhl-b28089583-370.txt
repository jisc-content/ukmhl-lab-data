MENU FOR A PARTY OF EIGHT. 356 made thus :—Parboil two, or three, fair sized Bombay onions, cut them up roughly and put them into a sauce- pan with a ladleful of butter, a pinch of sugar, and pepper and salt to fancy; let them cook slowly so that they do not take colour, add a table-spoonful of boiled rice, or pearl barley, and a cupful of broth and let the simmering go on till the lumps of onion are quite soft; then add a heaped up table-spoonful of finely grated cheese, stir this in well for a minute or two, then lift it up, and work the mixture through the sieve as you would a puree. Heat it up gently in the hain-marie, and at the last stir in a table-spoonful of rich cream.

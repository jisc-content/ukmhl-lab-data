MENU FOR A PARTY OF EIGHT. 352 pass the fruit through the sieve, and save the pulp in a basin. Crack the stones, and throve the prune kernels into the pulp. Steep about an ounce of gelatine in the liquor that you strained off, put it on the fii-e and let it dissolve, mix it with the prune pulp, and pour in a liqueur glass of cherry brandy and a glass of good red wine. Decorate a plain border mould with blanched almonds, fill the mould with the prune liquid, and set it upon ice to form. When required, turn out the pain, and fill the centre of the mould with whipped cream. Unlike ordinary jellies this one is dark tinted, and opaque, but its flavour is quite beyond question. 9.—Line a pudding mould (see Menu IV) with finger biscuits, or slices of sponge-cake. «tra^eme^*°^ Make a rich custard sufficient in quantity to nearly fill the mould ; be generous with the egg-yolks, and do not use flour if you want a creamy pudding; tint the custard a pale rosy-pink with a few drops of cochineal, strain, whip it well as soon as it is formed, and flavour it with strawberry syrup ; when ready, add half an ounce of dissolved gelatine to it, and work as described for “ iced apricot pudding,” Menu No. 1, adding crystallized strawberries to the frozen cus- tard, and a coffee-cupful of whipped cream. Note.—To adapt this menu, strike out the cJiapon d la Fran^aise, and insert, after the fish. Filet de boeuf d V Italienne, page 189. w

CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 108 again, being under an impression that stuffing is necessary- in roasting poultry. The only birds that should be stuffed in the crop are turkeys, and exceptionally fine capons. Who amongst you ever saw a roast fowl in England, stuffed ? The bar- barous practice has become common out here, and ought to be put down as utterly wrong. Moisture, which is so necessary in roasting, should, as I have already observed, be secured by either larding the fowl with fat bacon, or tying a slice of bacon over the breast. I however advo- cate a stuffing for the inside of a fowl intended for braising as follows :—^well mashed potato, and boiled sweet onion, in the proportion of two-thirds of the former to one-third of the latter. The mashed potato, of course, contains butter, spiced pepper, a little milk or cream, or the yolk of an egg, and helps to preserve the juiciness of the bird ; the flavour it imparts too is, I think, agreeable. This with a little chopped sage may be used for ducks. An author for whom I entertain the greatest respect urges the practice I have mentioned of putting one sweet onion, and a lump of salt butter, inside every chicken, or fowl, to be roasted. But this cannot be called “ stuffing.” A turkey, on the other hand, requires carefully made forcemeat, and, as you all know, there are many varieties thereof. Truffles, and chestnuts form the epicurean stuff- ing of the roast turkey, and one of oysters is propounded for the boiled bird. I leave these elaborate compositions alone, for receipts can be easily hunted up for them when a special occasion may demand a “ dindon truffe d la Peri- gord,” or a “ dinde braisee d la financiere,” ^c., ^c. The stuffing, I am anxious to discuss, is the ordinary one we remember in England for turkeys, veal, hares, and so on :—a firm, green-tinted forcemeat, flavoured with pleasant herbs, and a suspicion of lemon-peel; a forcemeat which cuts clean with the slice of the breast of your turkey, or

Bind the salpicon with four eggs, and spread it thickly over the inside of the bon- ed loin, then roll the joint up, and tie it firmly into shape, —do not skewer it., Now braise the loin in a gravy made from its own bones and trimmings, with a glass of Ma- deira, a clove of garlic, and scraps of vegetables of all kinds arranged round it. When done, and nicely browned, lift up the loin, remove the string, and dish it on a layer of boiled maccaroni. Strain off the gravy, throw away the garlic, and pass all the vegetables through the sieve ; thicken the gravy, add the vegetable pulp, and when thoroughly incorporated, pour it round the loin and serve. 5.—A snipe for each head.

Turn it out when done,

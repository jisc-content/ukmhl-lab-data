CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 310 mistake to do so. We do not call for rice with hare soup, game soup, or mock-turtle ; why, then, should we ruin our appetites by taking rice with so satisfying a potage as onulUgatunny ? The custom has been handed down to us by our forefathers, who, of course, ate rice with their mulligatunny, as did the natives from whom they learnt the dish. The object in a clear mulligatunny is to present a bright, sparkling consomme of the colour of clear turtle, with a decided flavour of mulligatunny, and slightly peppery. Now, if you try to communicate the flavour with ready- made curry-powder or paste, in which there is a certain quantity of turmeric, you will experience considerable difficulty in getting your soup bright and clear.

I would abstain from the use of all ordinary spices for

173 RECHAUFFES. Now, take another sauce-pan, and go through the usual process of thickening the broth ; it will then be ready to receive the meat you desire to re-cook. A table-spoonful of Madeira, or Marsala ; a little red currant jelly, and port- wine ; some claret or burgundy if at hand ; the pnlp of a couple of tomatoes; or the strained yolks of two eggs, may be added to enrich jour plat. The egg should be stirred in after the sauce-pan has been removed from the fire. The tomato gives a piquancy to all hashes, and minces, superior to that which can be procured by vinegars. Your selection of the wine that you use must depend, of course, upon the sort of meat you are cooking up. In the case of a mince, remember, that when the meat has been passed through the machine, it must be diluted with a good thick sauce, in which it should be gently heated. Just before serving, it may be enriched with the raw yolks of a couple eggs—off the fire. Having done this, you can diversify the methods of serving it as follows :— 1. Make a light omelette. When all but ready to serve, spread your mince quickly on top of the omelette, toss the omelette in the pan lightly, and roll it off into the hot dish, enveloping the mince, and serve. This must not look like a “ roly-poly” pudding. The omelette should not be made as stiff as a batter dumpling as Ramasamy loves to serve it. I will tell you how to make an omelette, propeidy in my next chapter. 2. Make a case of mashed potato, with high sides like a vol-au-vent case, and pour your mince into it. 3. Hollow out a number of small dinner rolls, butter them, and fry them a golden yellow: pour your mince into them, put a curl of fried bacon on the top of each, heat them in the oven for five minutes, and serve.

OUR KITCHENS IN INDIA. 505 It is downriglit nonsense to say that native cooks cannot work upon English principles. They manage very well on boardship, where their services are highly prized, yet their appliances are wholly European. The kitchen at the Madras Club, and those of several private houses, both here, and on the Hills, are fitted up entirely upon the Home system, yet the cooks do not complain. No ; it seems pretty clear that if no other alternative present it- self, Ramasamy can fall into the way of using a range readily enough. I know of a case in which a young and zealous native chef absolutely begged his mistress to permit him to pre- pare his jellies, pastry, &c., in a spare room in the house, alleging as his reason that the kitchen was too hot and smoky : and I am perfectly sure that the majority of good Madras cooks would appreciate a similar concession. The recusants would, in all probability, be gentlemen who have become wedded to practices whereof their consciences are afraid. Pilferings of all kinds would, to begin with, become far more difficult, long absences would be soon detected, work properly the cook’s could not be thrust upon the cook’s maty, and drinking and gossiping during working hours would be knocked on the head. The furnishing of this “ working room” could be man- aged without much trouble, and certainly inexpensively, in the manner already mentioned:—with a dresser of strong wood, a pastry table with marble slab, a cup-board, a rack for plates and dishes, a gauze safe, and a set of shelves. Delicate operations, such as the composition of high class sauces, the boiling of a jelly, or the simmering of fruit, could be carried on upon a mineral oil stove, or by means of a charcoal fire placed in a sheltered corner of the veran- dah close to the room; and such articles of diet need never be carried into the kitchen at all. But when pro- perly dressed, and prepared for roasting, stewing, boiling.

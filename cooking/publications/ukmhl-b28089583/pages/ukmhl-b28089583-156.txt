142 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. satisfied that the cabbage is thoroughly clean, either steam the quarters, or plunge them into boiling hot-water, and after boiling for a quarter of an hour, take them out and drain them. Now, mince a thick slice of bacon, and a little shallot, parsley, marjoram, and thyme, with a pinch of sugar, and pepper and salt to taste; put all in a stew-pan, and set it on the fire. As soon as the bacon melts, lay your cabbage quarters in it, and pour round them suffi- cient gravy to half cover them. Let this simmer gently till the cabbage is done. Then lift out the quarters, place them in a hot dish, and cover them up. Strain the gravy, thicken it with flour and butter, and pour it over the cab- bage.

Cabbages may be cooked with rice, and gravy (chou au riz) :—Par-boil the cabbage, cut it up into pieces the size of an egg, and put them with an equal quantity of half-boiled rice, into as much gravy as will cover them, simmer till done, then serve. Do not put in more gravy than is absolutely necessary, or the dish will turn out more like a potage than an entremets. Grated cheese should be handed round with this. 4. A novel dish, Feuilles de chou farcies, is recom- mended by a good authority which may be described in this way ;—Boil the head of cabbage till the leaves become pliant: take it from the water, gently detach a number of

128 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. however, of such enterprising amateurs as may be able to grow them privately, I will mention how each should be treated by the cook hereafter. Potatoes perhaps claim the most important place in our consideration, so let us take them first. The boiling of a potato has long been considered one of the tests by which the merits of a cook should be decided. “ Can she cook a chop, and boil a potato ?” is often the modest query of pater familias in England, and in nine cases out of ten you may wager your best hat that she can do neither. Nevertheless, I have come to the conclusion that cooks are in many cases wrongfully blamed in the matter of potato-cooking, that is to say, that their failure is often attributed to the wrong cause. We all know that the potato grows capriciously according to the weather it may have enjoyed, or have suffered from. A crop will sometimes prove mealy, and light, for the table, and at other times waxy, and heavy. It is therefore obvious that we should find out the merits or demerits of the tubers we buy, before we give our orders regarding their treatment in the kitchen. We ought not to expect all potatoes to turn out equally floury as a matter of course, and blame the cook if he fail so to serve them.

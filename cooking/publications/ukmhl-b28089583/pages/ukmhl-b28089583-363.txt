MENU FOR A PARTY OF EIGHT. 349 When ready, stew the cutlets very tenderly in gravy made from the bones, flap, and trimmings ; take them out, and set them to get cold with a weight above tliem ; wlien cold, mask the cutlets on one side only with reduced bechamel, or Espagnole sauce. W^hen this mask or glaze has set, trim the edges neatly, and the cutlet is ready. You must now prepare the socle or stand upon which to arrange your cutlets. This is made of ground rice, and is not intended to be eaten. Wash a pound of rice, and boil it gently with a little salt. When soft, pound it in a mortar, and mould it to the shape required. In this case we want a circle about three inches high with a hol- low centre for a salad, and sloped gently on its outer rim to admit of the cutlets being laid upon it securely. When formed satisfactorily, the socle should be coated with butter or white sauce, and the cutlets arranged round its outer face. They should have their masked sides out- wards. The hollow centre of the socle should be fllled with a salade cuite of mixed cold cooked peas, Jlageolets, French beans cut in diamonds, stars of carrot, &c. The top of the socle may be formed sufficiently wide to admit of a garnish of white of egg, turned carrots, &c., being laid upon it. When completed, this eiitree should be kept in the ice box till wanted. With the exception of the mayonnaise dressing, which should be separately made, and poured over the salad just before serving, it can be made early in the day, and is consequently so much off the cook’s hands as the dinner hour arrives. It will be found vastly better than the everlastingpaie de foie gras en aspic. Iced cream may be used instead of mayonnaise dressing, and the salade may be composed of jlageolets, pointes d'asperges, ^c., alone. 4.—The difficulty in this dish is the hatter which should be most carefully considered. 35

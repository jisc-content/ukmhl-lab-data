HORS D'CEUVRES. 217 of whicli are agreeable in fancy butter, you will avoid sameness, and secure success. This is my recipe for a stock “ green-butter” :— 1. Weigh a quarter of a pound of butter such as I have described, and ice it. 2. —Boil a conple of good handfuls of spinach, drain them thoroughly, pass the leaves through the hair sieve, and save all the pulp, so obtained, in a bowl. 3. —Take six full sized anchovies from the tin, loipe them free from oil, pick out their back bones, pass them through the hair sieve, and save the pulp. 4. —Mince as finely as possible sufidcient curled parsley to fill a table-spoon generously. 5. —Mince also as finely as possible capers sufficient to fill a tea-spoon, heaped up. 6. —Having these ingredients ready, first colour the butter by working into it, as lightly as you can, enough “ spinach-greening” to secure the tint you require (it is always wise to order a little more spinach than you think you may want, to be on the safe side) then add the other things by degrees, and when thoroughly incorporated, trim the butter into a tasteful mould, or sundry pretty patlets, and set it in the ice-box. Maitre cVhotel butter I have already given (page 82.) It is quite worthy of a place amongst hors d’ceuvres. Prawn butter,—a highly delicious composition, should be made in this way :—Boil the prawns, clean them care- pound them to a paste in your mortar, mixing a little butter with them to assist the operation. Now, melt some butter in a sauce-pan, mix your pounded prawn meat in it, and as soon as it appears to have absorbed the butter (having been well stirred during the process and flavoured with a very little cayenne pepper, and powdered mace) 19

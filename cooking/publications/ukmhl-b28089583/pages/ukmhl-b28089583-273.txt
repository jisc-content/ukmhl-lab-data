259 PASTRY-MAKING, ET CETERA. Now, I tMnk that it would be a mere waste of time to jot down a great number of recipes for pastry. The ordi- nary domestic cookery book generally contains a dozen or more of them which tend, I think, to confuse rather than to instruct the student. In endeavouring to improve our native cooks, we should certainly cast aside all complica- tion, and reduce our instruction to the simplest formulse. So, let us do our best to confine their attention to three compositions as follows :— (a) puff paste. (h) pie-crust. (o) raised pie-crust.

If a cook can present a good sample of each of these pastes, he need not bother his head with varieties. Let us then rm through the ‘ a. b. c.’ of pastry-making, and make sure that our chef thoroughly understands the elementary part of this branch of his work: First, if you can possibly get one, you should use a marble pastry slab.

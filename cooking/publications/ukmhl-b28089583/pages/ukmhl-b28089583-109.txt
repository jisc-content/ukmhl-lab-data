I first read Gouffe before I had taken to practical cooking work, and before I had actually made sauces, &c., ladle in hand, in an English kitchen. Since going through that ordeal, I have again come across the book, and I find that much that I had formerly to skip as too complicated, now seems easy enough. I propose now to place before you in the simplest way I can Gouffe’s fundamental sauces. Those who are ac- quainted with that author, will observe that in the first place I shall reduce the recipes to a much shorter compass, and in the next, that I shall omit everything that is not down-right necessary to produce a fair result. GoufFe propounds the following saucas as the found- ation of nearly all those of a high class that you are likely to encounter :— 1. Espagnole. 2. Veloute. 3. Allemande. 4. Bechamel. 5. Marinade. 6. Poivrade. Of these veloute, allemande, and bechamel are so closely allied, that I shall confine myself to the last. Marinade and poivrade I have already alluded to. Espagnole is, of course, worthy of close attention. My fundamental sauces will then be reduced to two:—one brown, the other white,—which I think will be found ample for the Indian kitchen.

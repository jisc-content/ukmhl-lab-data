I often envied my friend’s bread, yet never took the trouble to follow his example until comparatively lately. My conversion was brought about by Mr. Woolf of 119, New Bond Street, who introduced me to the “Acme cook- ing stove,”* and gave me many a seance with regard to the use of Teatman’s baking powder for which his Arm are the London Agents.

Ton are shown how to make a * pound loaf,—“ cottage” pattern, in rolls, or in the tin. This is placed in the stove oven whilst you examine the numerous clever contrivances for the kitchen,—principally American inventions,—which form the specialites of the establishment. In less than half an hour the loaf, baked to perfection, is placed upon the table. Now here are two invaluable articles for the dweller in tents;—a composition, perfectly climate-proof, by which he can turn out an excellent loaf of light, clean bread; and the oven to bake it in. The “ Acme Stove” is cheap, portable, strong, and easily managed. It is fed by mineral oil, kerosine or paraflne, and in addition to the oven, provides the cook with a capital kitchen range adapted for boiling, stewing, frying, and even grilling. The size I recommend, after ripwards of two years experience of its working,—more than a year of that time having been spent at Madras,—is fitted with double wicks four inches wide. One of these stoves with its ordinary appurtenances can be purchased for £2, s.I5. For that sum you have a capital oven, with baking dishes * Now eclipsed by the “ Florence” which is worked exactly like the Acme bnt with untnerous improvements.—W.

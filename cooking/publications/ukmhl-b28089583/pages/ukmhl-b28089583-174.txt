CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 160 Blanc, which I have already mentioned with reference to vegetable cookery, is a kind of stock made as follows:— Cut up as small as possible a quai’ter of a pound of fat bacon, and a quarter of pound of beef suet, and nut the pieces with a bacon bone, or some broken-up chicken bones, into a stew-pan. Add a couple of carrots, and two large sweet onions cut up small, a bunch of curly parsley, a tea-spoonful of dried thyme or marjoram, a dozen pepper corns, a tea-spoonful of sugar and one of salt, and stir well over a brisk fire till the fat melts well, and the vegetables begin to fry in it. Do not let them brown, but pour in before that stage arrives enough warm water to cover the contents of the pan. Draw the pan to the edge of the fire. Cook the contents of it at first gently, gradually adding heat, and fijially encouraging evaporation by actual boil- ing, and stirring the contents of your pan to prevent them catching. When the liquor has diminished to about a quarter of its original quantity, strain it off into a bowl. When required, this vegetable essence should be carefully skimmed poured into a sauce-pan, and sufficient water should be added to cook the celery or other vegetable that may be put into it. Celery stewed in lilanc can be served advantageously a la nio'elle, i.e., with beef marrow. In this case you must pile the celery in the centre of the dish, thicken the hlanc in which it was cooked, and pour it over the pile. The marrow should be treated in this way :—Break the bone, take out the raw marrow, cut it into dice, blanch them for five minutes in scalding water, drain them, and heat them up gently in a little of the sauce en bain-marie. A dessert-spoonful each of this should be put into little croustades of fried bread, and served round the celery as a garnish. Cut your croustades square, out of stale bread, and hollow a little space in each to hold the marrow.

MULLIGATUNNY. 313 capful of milk, give it a pinch of sugar, and let the mix- ture stand till wanted. Now, having ascertained that the chicken is quite tender, stir in a dessert-spoonful of good chutney, a tea-spoonful of red currant jelly, and a tea- spoonful of lime-juice, and, after five minutes’ simmering, strain off the whole of the liquid into a bowl. Pick out the nicest pieces of chicken for garnish, and put them aside. Now, skim the surface of the liquid, and, when quite clear of grease, proceed to thicken it, using a table- spoonful of butter and one of flour, and stirring in the soup slowly. All having been poured in, strain into the sauce- pan the almond milk, using a piece of muslin in order to catch up the bits of nut. Let the mulligatunny come to the boil, and serve. The chief points to observe are :—First, the use of a really good paste or powder ; next the simmering and ad- dition of a pleasant sub-acid; then the straining, skim- ming, and thickening ; and lastly, the introduction of the almond milk. Instead of almond milk, cocoanut milk (the infusion of the nut, I mean) may be used, and a table- spoonful of cream, or a couple of raw yolks of eggs, may be stirred into the tureen with the soup, by degrees, just before serving. The choice pieces of chicken should also be served in the mulligatunny. For mutton mulligatunny follow this recipe, substitut- ing a neck or breast of mutton for the chicken. It will be seen from these observations that, while there IS no difficulty whatevei’ in making mulligatunny of a superior, as well as of an ordinaiy kind, it is a soup that demands no little care and attention. Whether it is worth the trouble or not is a question that can only be decided by practical experiment. I have no hesitation in recom- mending the trial.

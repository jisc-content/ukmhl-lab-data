CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 56 The proportions of all these must depend upon the quan- tity of fish to be boiled, the skill of the cook, and the taste of the company.” When nearly done, half draw the fish- kettle from the fire, and let the fish simmer gently till the moment of serving. A mixture of white wine such as chablis, santerne, or hock, and water, in equal parts, may be used instead of the vinegar and water. Fish cooked “ au blett” is also considered a delicacy. The preparation is exactly like court bouillon, red wine being substituted for white. Court bouillon a la Nantaise is made of milk and water in equal parts, salt, and pepper in proportion. The art of frying fish consists in being prodigal in the use of the medium which you employed to cook with. The fish should be absolutely immersed in a bath of boiling fat or oil, which should be carefully tested so that you may be convinc- ed of its temperature. “If your fat be not sufficiently heated,” says the authority I have already quoted, “ the fish you want to fry will turn out a flabby and greasy mess, instead of a crisp, appetising dish.” For nearly all fish- frying, the frying basket is an invaluable utensil, used, of course, in conjunction with the deep-sided /nVttre-pan. Fish, fried in the English fashion, is generally egged and bread-crumbed. The Italians, who are perhaps the best ‘ frysters’ in the world, either flour their fish, or dip it in batter. Both methods are, to my mind, vastly supe- rior to the bread-crumbing process. If, however, you must use crumbs, see that they are stale, and well sifted; not the pithy lumps, both great and small, too often set before you, because Ramasamy will not look ahead, and rarely, if ever keeps a bottled supply of stale, well rasped bread in hand. To obtain a satisfactory result, proceed as follows : Having crumbled some stale bread as small as you can in

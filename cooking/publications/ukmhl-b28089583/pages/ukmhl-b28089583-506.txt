On Coffee-Making. ♦ N certain occasions in the course of my jottings, I have mentioned the cup of cafe noir as the finishing touch of a nice little dinner. I think, therefore, that I may as well say a few words regarding its composi- tion before I ask you to consider my vienus ended. Although few may think themselves ignorant of coffee- making, I question whether its real secrets are generally known. Indeed to judge by the stuff that we usually get, I think, we may say that the art is comparatively rare. First, to be sure, you must “ catch your coffee,” i.e.:—get really good berries, and be willing to pay a trifle over the usual price for them. That done, the next thing to learn is the roasting, an operation that should be conducted daily if you want well-flavoured coffee.

EGGS, MACCARONI, AND CHEESE. 243 aforesaid in a sauce-pan over the fire, stii-ring it without ceasing until it attains the consistency of thin paste. This well seasoned with salt and pepper may he preserved in bottles, and if securely corked, and waxed, will keep well. During then’ season, tomatoes absolutely rot in the ground in many a private garden in this Presidency; why permit such waste ? the trouble of making a few bottles of this conserve would be amply repaid in the hot weather when the plants have died down. A spoonful or two of the preserve, thinned with a very little stock, and with a pat of butter worked into it, would, at all times, be handy for dressing maccaroni.

396 MENU FOR A PARTY OF EIGHT. 9.—For this effective ice, you must have four small ice pails, and make a different ice in each deiced pudding, med- p^il^ ;—No. 1, strawberry cream (Menu No. 3) ; No. 2, creme de pistache (Menu No. 2) ; No. 3, parfait au chocolat (Menu No. 8) ; and No. 4, vanilla cream.

Let the knife cut this tracing to a depth of a quarter of an inch. Now put the sheet in the oven, and when the paste is baked, I’emovc the inner oval (for a cover) which you will fiud has risen: then

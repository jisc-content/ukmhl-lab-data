Now cut up a table-spoon- ful of minced cornichons, add the mince to the strained gravy, heat it up to concert pitch, and send it round with your fried fish in a boat. 3. —-Proceed with a nice sized chicken or small fowl as though you were going to make vitli aepiinigus poiutis. gU'enelles, viz. : Lightly roast it.

If this be carefully prepai'ed and skimmed, you will obtain a pellucid broth which should be strained, and kept ready for use presently. Take a sauce-pan, and melt a quarter of a pound of “ cow-brand,” or any good preserved butter in it; fry gently in that for ten minutes a sliced cai-rot and a sliced onion; before they take colour, add two ounces of flour, stir for five minutes, and add by degrees your clear broth, half a pint of cream, a small tinful of mushrooms chopped, salt, and pepper; stir over the fire till boiling, and then permit the sauce to simmer slowly for an honr, taking off all fat that may rise.

Before using, a gill of cream may be finally stirred into the sauce as you take it from the bain- marie. Veloute is exactly like this omitting the cream when you add the stock, and also the chopped mushrooms: it is therefore less expensive and not quite so rich.

I have already described the making of chicken or rather fowl essence; the same principles being observed

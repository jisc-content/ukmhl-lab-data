THE MENU. 9 We must not sei've, that is to say, pintade au cresson as a releve, or “ jambon au made^'e” as a roi—trifling errors that I have noticed at certain banquets modelled according to the new regime. Neither can we forget the salad, which, with its plain dressing of oil and vinegar (not a thick eggy one, I beg) should accompany the roi as a matter of course. If unable to follow the rules of the revised menu accurate- ly, owmg to an indifferent market, or some other unavoida- ble reason, the wise dinner-giver should fall back upon the older form, and be contented with a less pretentious festival. The superiority of the new order of things consists in a more ai’tistic distribution of light and shadow. If we rob e pmture of an effective ray of sunshine here, and forget a judicious touch of shadow there, we can hardly complain II our efforts result in disappointment. At the commencement of these remarks, I spoke of the ave long been accustomed to a once understood and generally it the new arrangement will be adopted, I do not think that the new tound longer than the old.

80 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. There are nevertheless several standing sauces which must be spoken of independently; for instance, melted butter (soMce blanche), Hollandaise, souhise, maitre d'hbtel, bread sauce, mayonnaise, tartare, remoulade, ravigote, Hobert, piquante, Sfc. Let us take these first, for they are perhaps more simple, and oftener in request than Espag- nole, veloute, and their various descendants.

THICK SOUPS, AND PUREES. 51 These soups are what house-keepers call “ rich,” for in their composition you must employ port, or Madeira, red currant jelly, butter, cream, yolks of eggs, &c. One of the greatest cooks of the age propounds half a bottle of old port for his hare soup! and all game soups take a goodly share of wine. The points to observe in the making of these purees are, first, to get every atom of flavour you can out of the bones, scraps, and giblets, which is done by simmering them watchfully in stock. Then to work all the meat you can pick from the birds to a stiff paste in a mortar (having fii’st minced it in the machine) passing it through the sieve to get rid of fibre, gristle, and so forth. Next to blend the pulp of the game with the stock in the way I have previously described. And lastly, to follow with accuracy whatever recipe you have taken as regards the flavouring elements. Do not leave out anything if yon can possibly manage it. Dried sweet herbs, (thyme and marjoram,) are as necessary in game soups, as is basil in turtle ; and red currant jelly is indispensable. Spice is often mentioned in recipes for these soups. I do not recom- mend it. In fact, beyond the two cloves inserted in the onion used for the stock, I would carefully omit it. As I intend to give detailed instructions for game purees in their turn in my menus, I will not pursue the subject any fmther in this chapter. Neither will I discuss the treatment of tinned soups j ust yet, for I shall reserve that branch of Indian soup-making for consideration hereafter in a chapter devoted to “ Camp cookery.” N.B. Caution your butler to be careful to help the soup at a dinner party with judgment. One ladleful in each basin is ample.

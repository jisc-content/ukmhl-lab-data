CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 54 an excuse, please, as a mere evasion, for, in point of fact, fisli takes so short a time to di’ess thoroughly, that an hour should suffice for the most elaborate recipe. I always bear in mind the time that is necessary for the production of the dishes I select for my menus. Again, many people hesitate to offer their guests a dish of dressed fish, fearing that it may be considered too rich. This is absurd, for there are plain, as well as rich methods of varying this branch of cookery ; and, in composing your menu,, you should select one in harmony with the soup which precedes, and entree which is to follow it. Thus : if your soup be of a thick creamy kind, and your first entree (say) a vol-au-vent, let the fish be served in aspic iced, and with sauce ravigote or tartare. But if you give a clear consomme delicately flavoured, and order an iced entree to succeed the fish, you can indulge in a “ matelote aux champignons” or seer “d la creme de crevettes.” A tliick soup, fish with lobster sauce, followed by an entree with cream in its composition, would form, for instance, a combination of good things obviously inartistic in design, and one which few could enjoy with impunity. As I observed in an early chapter of my “ jottings,” the charm of a dinner according to the new regime consists in the harmony of its lights and shadows. N.B.—If you follow the new style of menu,, and present the releve after the fish, you need have no apprehension. With regard to the service of dressed fish, especially if it be preceded by a clear soup. Fish, we all know, I hope, may be boiled, fried, baked, roasted, stewed, or grilled; and by every method can tasty dishes be prepared. I will begin with the principles to be observed in boiling fish, and take the other styles of cookery in the order I have named. After having thoroughly cleansed, and wiped the fish.

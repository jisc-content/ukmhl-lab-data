141 VEGETA BLES— CON CL UDED. After steaming has set in, the contents of the receptacle should be examined now and then, and tested exactly as boiled vegetables are. I can strongly recommend Wai-ren’s vegetable steamer made of block-tin for this process. There are numerous methods of dressing greens,—after boiling or steaming them,—which ought to attract favoura- ble attention, and I can assure you that with a very little trouble you can turn out a most excellent series of dishes, which will well repay you, and raise the lowly cabbage to a much higher position in your estimation than it at present may occupy. Before I pass to the fanciful styles in which cabbages can be dressed, I ought however to call attention to a bad habit that the native cook often indulges in. I mean that of chopping up a plain boiled cabbage before serving it. Setting aside the ugly appearance that the dish presents when thus maltreated, the chopping is a wasteful practice. The cut-up cabbage dries quickly, and will hardly be found worth dressing up a second time ; whereas, if served whole, the portion that may be left after dinner, will remain nice and juicy, and will make a rechauffe in the form of a puree with potatoes and butter for breakfast; or, tossed in butter in the frying-pan with finely-minced herbs, it will be acceptable with the chop or kidney. Let a plainly cooked head of cabbage, therefore, be sent up simply divided into quarters, with a pat of fresh butter on the top of each, melting from the heat of the greens. 1.

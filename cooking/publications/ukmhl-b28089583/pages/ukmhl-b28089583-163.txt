VEGETABLES—CON CL UDED. 149 Another artistic method of doing this vegetable is this :— Cut half a dozen large ones, after they have been three parts boiled, into long strips about a quarter of an inch thick, dip them in the batter I describe elsewhere, and fry them a golden tint: these fritters are excellent; you can order them alone as an entremets^ or pile them in a pyramid as the central garnish of an entree. Jerusalem artichokes can be served in a mould, iced, with a mayonnaise sauce, or hot with a Parmesan, or rich white sauce. For the mould, follow this recipe:—Two pounds of the artichokes boiled in milk; half a pint of cream : four eggs : pepper and salt. Mash the artichokes, and pass them through the hair sieve, add the cream, the eggs well beaten up whites and all, and season with pepper and salt. Put the mixture into a well-buttered mould, and steam it for one hour. Turn it out, and garnish it with tomato puree, Parmesan sauce, or a rich veloute. Or; —ice the mould, and turn it out, sending it up with a cold mayonnaise sauce in a boat. The name of this excellent entremets here is “ Topinambours d la Chetput,” but it is commonly called creme de topinambours. Undeniably good as the Jerusalem artichoke is, it is, of course, inferior to the Globe or leafy kind (artichaut). These are properly considered the choicest delicacies of the Neilgherry market by many people. A globe artichoke, like a cabbage, must be well soaked in salt and water to get rid of the insects which may be hidden between the leaves. Then it must be set head downwards in boiling water, with soda and salt, and boiled till the leaves part easily from the core. When done, you must drain it, and dish it hot: a little “ Dutch sauce,” in which a few drops of anchovy vinegar, or lime-juice have been introduced, forms an agreeable accompaniment.

CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 130 Having boiled or steamed our potato satisfactorily, let us see in bow many ways we may serve it, presuming that we bave turned it out as flourily as we could desire. First, of course, it may be sent up plainly, either in its skin, or crumbled in to tbe disb made bot to receive it.

Potatoes d la Duchesse should be well worked through the sieve, enriched with the yolks of two or three eggs, and a gill of cream, and given a delicate flavouring of salt, pepper, nutmeg, and chopped parsley: then rolled into

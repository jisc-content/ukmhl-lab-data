21 CERTAIN KITCHEN REQUISITES. people think differently. Copper is, we all know, uni- versally recommended on account of its durability. You see nothing else in the kitchens of restaurants, clubs, &c., and in all establishments where the demands upon the chef are frequent and elaborate. If treated with ordinary care, no evil should result from its use. Enamelled iron- ware looks nice when new, but the slightest carelessness destroys the enamel, and when once cracked, it may be considered done for. Plain wrought-iron vessels, tinned, are serviceable, and block tin for certain utensils is not to be despised. The lately introduced grey enamel ware is likewise serviceable, and at the same time light. In my own kitchen, I have a mixed collection which answers its purpose well enough. With regard to the equipment necessary for an ordinary establishment, I can safely recommend :— A Warren’s cooking pot. 4 Stew-pans of sizes. 6 Sauce-pans assorted. 1 Large sauce-pan with steamer. 1 Iron 3-gallon digester. 1 Braising-pan. 1 Friture--paxL (or frying- kettle). 1 Saute--p&n. I Omelette--pa,n. I Eluted gridiron. 1 Tin fish kettle and drain- er. 1 Ordinary iron-kettle. 2 Spits of sizes. I Bain-marie, capable of holding four or five small sauce-pans. In addition to this,—the heavy portion of the equip- ment,—the cook should have :— 3 Iron spoons of sizes. 3 Wooden spoons. 1 Basting ladle. 1 Fish slice. 1 Set of skewers. 1 Set of larding needles. I Meat saw. 1 Chopper. 2 Plain pudding moulds. 1 Cake mould. 2 Plain border moulds. I Flour dredger.

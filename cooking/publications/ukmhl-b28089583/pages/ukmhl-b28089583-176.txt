Never peel black salsify (scorsonhra) before boiling, for, if cut, it “ sweats,” and loses much of its moisture. Boil first, and peel afterwards. This advice is the result of personal expeiuence. Asparagus, and seakale, if procurable, should be picked carefully, washed, and tied up in little bundles with all the heads level: then, with a very sharp knife, the stalks should also be cut level.

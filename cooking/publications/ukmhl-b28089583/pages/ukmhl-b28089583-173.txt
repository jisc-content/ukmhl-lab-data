159 VEGETA BLES-CON CL UDED. the stew-pan, dust over the surface a layer of Parmesan, Gruyere, or other mild cheese, and bake for eight or ten minutes : serve hot. “ A V-Italienne" :—Cut the tomatoes in halves, scoop out the pulp and seeds with a silver spoon, and place them on a baking dish npon which you have poui-ed a little of the best salad oil. Make a mixture of grated liavi, bread- crumbs, some finely minced shallot, parsley, marjoram, and thyme, seasoned with pepper and salt; mix this with the tomato pulp, and fill the cases, covering them com- pletely, shake an allowance of salad oil in drops over all, and bake for a few minutes, serving the dish intact as it comes from the oven. The proportion of crnmbs to the ham should be two spoonfuls of the former, to one of the latter, the flavouring herbs, &c., to taste at discretion. Chopped anchovies, olives, capers, mnshrooms and truffles, can be introduced if at hand, and butter (melted) may be used by those who do not like oil. Celery (celeri), is an exceedingly nice vegetable not only when sent round, raw, with cheese, but also when cooked in various ways as an entremets. In the latter case the heads should be very neatly trimmed and cut short, say five or six inches in length. They can then be split lengthwise in two or four pieces according to the thickness of the head. When pi’epared satisfactorily, the pieces should be plunged into fast boiling water, and as soon as tender, drained, turned out upon a hot silver dish, and served like asparagus with a pat of butter melting over them, a piping hot “ Dutch sauce” being sent round in a boat. Celery may be also stewed gently in weak stock, or blanc and then be presented a VEspagnole (covered with a thick rich brown sauce), or an jus in clear gravy.

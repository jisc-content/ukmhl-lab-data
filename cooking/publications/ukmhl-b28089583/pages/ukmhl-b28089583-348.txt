334 NOTES TO MENU. the tui’bot or brill, but as it never reaches as great a size as either of those fish, it can be trimmed when desired in fillets, and cooked like soles. The sole and whiting can be treated exactly like the fishes of the same name at home. The only difference being that the Indian sole is, as a rule, wanting in the depth of flesh, possessed by the European variety when in proper season. The mullet is a far larger fish than the English grey mullet, and not nearly as rich. If taken in back-waters, it requires very careful cleaning to rid it of the muddy taste it acquires in such circumstances. Remembering the peculiarities of these fish, a little re- flection will enable my readers in other parts of India to apply the recipes I have given to almost any fish that may be at their disposal. A fish that can be easily dr’essed in fillets may be treated as a pomfr’et or sole. One that is large and firm enough to be sliced can be cooked as the seer. Long trout-shaped fish may be served as mullet, and can be baked whole, or roasted a la broche. Bony fish are best prepared in the form of puree:—boiled, passed through the sieve, and sent up as a souffle, or a creme. The becktie of Calcutta seems specially adapted to treatment as codfish ; at the same time it may be cooked in almost every way laid down for seer fish. The hilsa, again, approaches very closely if it does not surpass the mackerel, and may be dressed similarly. Those who may try to use this book in England should remember that ordinary eggs in India are far smaller than, those at home. I calculate that five Indian eggs equal three English. Again: the cream so often pro- pounded in my recipes is not nearly as thick and rich as English cream: the use therefore of cream may be tem- pered with discretion. Wyverx.

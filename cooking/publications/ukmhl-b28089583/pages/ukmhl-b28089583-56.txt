CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 42 digester. As may readily be supposed boiling point is speedily reached in'this way of managing matters. In an hour or so the cook retiirns and finds the water he put into the pot reduced to about one-third of its original quantity; this is, of course, a very strong broth, he accordingly strains it ofE, and calls it his “ first sort gravy.” He then returns the meat, &c., to the pot again, covers it with water, and lets that boil away. The liquid thus produced, I need scarcely say, is terrible to look upon, and very nasty to taste, the whole essence of the meat having been fritter- ed away by the first process. It is a dull, greasy-looking fluid like dish washings. Nevertheless Ramasamy strains it off and calls it the “ second sort gravy.” He next amal- gamates the two “ sorts,” browns the mixture with burnt onion, and clarifies it with the white of an egg. Having got it clear, he rasps some raw potato into it to obtain a nice glutinous starch, and when the soup seems sufficiently gummy, he strains once more and sends it to table. Setting aside other considerations, pray observe the wastefulness of this awful process. It is not exaggeration to say that half the quantity of soup-meat and bone required by the ignorant native cook might be saved if he could be prevailed upon to follow the laws of intelligent cookery.

92 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. of the raw yolks in conjunction with the hard-boiled (they produce the thick creaminess you want), the liberal use of good oil, and the addition last of all, in sparing quantity, of the tarragon vinegar. You do not want an acid sauce at all, remember. English cooks, as a rule, ruin their mayonnaise and salad dressings, by measuring the oil and vinegar they use in equal portions ! No artist measures these ingredients.* You might as well expect a painter to tell you the number of grains of the colotirs he used in painting a picture. You must not omit a little onion, but whilst permittiug the flavour “ scarce suspected to animate the whole,” you must on no account permit the “ atoms to lurk within the bowl”—the ladies in Sydney Smith’s days were perhaps less critical in the matter of this fragrant bulb, than are our fair enslavers in the present year of gi’ace. “ Tartare sauce" is the same as the above, without the use of hard-boiled eggs : raw yolks alone should’ be used, and the oil and vinegar should be added in the following proportions; a tea-spoonful of the latter, to two table- spoonfuls of the former, well beaten together, and often times repeated till enough sauce is made. “ Bemoulade” is a mayonnaise sauce with chopped gherkins, parsley, chives and capers, added. For chives, try the green stalks of a few young onions. The mustard used must be French, and a drop or two of garlic-vinegar is a sine qua non. “ Bavigote” is also mayonnaise with chopped shallots anchovies, celery, cress, and sweet herbs. Gri’een remoulade and ravigote are made in the same way, the colour being produced by parsley juice, and spinach- greening. * Gonffe’s calculation represents the quantity of vinegar as barely one-eiglitb of the oil.—W.

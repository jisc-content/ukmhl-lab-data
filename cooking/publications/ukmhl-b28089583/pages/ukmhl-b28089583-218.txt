204 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. vegetables principally employed being, lettuces (cabbage, and coss), endive, tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, parsley, young radishes, garden-cress, and water-cress, in the latter condition; and in the former, beet-root, French beans, flageolets, potatoes, artichokes, cauliflower, turnip-tops, asparagus, cabbage, vegetable marrow, and young carrots.

True connoisseurs, I think, adhere, as a rule, to the very simplest: that is to say, the simplest as far as the compo- nent parts, and the process of mixing them, are concerned.

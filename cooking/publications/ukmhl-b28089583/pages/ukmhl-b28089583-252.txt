238 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. Bologna sausage ; and muslirooms, or truffle trimmings, may be chopped up, and sprinkled over them : there is obviously ample scope for culinary ingenuity in the enrich- ment of “ mufs au gratin.” CEufs farcis” :—Boil six eggs for half an houi-, take them out, and plunge them into cold water. When quite cold, peel off their shells, and, with a dessert-knife nibbed in butter, divide each egg in half, slicing a little piece of the rounded ends to admit of each half sitting upright upon a dish : now pick out the yolks, pound them with butter in a mortar, and proceed to dress them with any tasty trifles at your command, season the composition deli- cately, and fill the egg cases therewith, trimming the farce neatly, with a dessert-knife dipped in melted butter, in a convex-shape over each case,—for there will be more than enough mixtui’e to merely fill each cavity. For th.e farce, you can use finely minced olives, capers, anchovies, mush- rooms, and truffles ; very finely grated ham, the bruised liver of a chicken, the remains of a pate de foie gras, or a little sausage meat. A judicious selection of two or three of these ingredients, seasoned with “ spiced pepper” is what you require,—say, one tea-spoonful of mixed farce to each half yolk. Having dressed your cases to your mind, fry a little square of bread for each one, as for canapes (q. V.) and place them thex’eon : arrange them on a flat silver dish slightly buttered, pour a little melted butter over each egg, and bake for five minutes. Some nicely fried bread-crumbs may be strewn over the dish when going to table. Eggs may, of course, be served in this manner very plainly farcis : a little minced curled parsley or marjoram, with a pounded anchovy, and some chopped olive, for instance, would not be a bad mixture when work- ed up with the hard yolks.

SAVOURY TOASTS. 231 very easily made. Trim the fish free from oil, skin, fins, bones, &c., and chop it up on a plate, give it a dust of Nepaul pepper, with a very little salt, and knead it up with a little butter. Put a pat of butter at the bottom of a sauce-pan, proceed as if to make a sauce hlanche with a little milk, incorporate therewith the minced fish, add the yolk of an egg, and when thick enough and thoroughly hot, pour it upon slices of fried toast hot from the pan, and dish up quickly.

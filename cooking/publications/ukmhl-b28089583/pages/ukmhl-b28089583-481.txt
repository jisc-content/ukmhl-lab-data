MENU FOR A LITTLE HOME DINNER. 467 fillets of a nice length, dust them with pepper and salt, and put them aside. Slice finely half a Bombay onion, and a small carrot, fry the slices, till just colouring, in an ounce of butter, now add a pint of milk and water, two- thirds milk to one-third water, all the fish hones and trimmings, a few pepper corns, an anchovy, a blade of mace, and a pinch of salt; boil this up and simmer it afterwards till you have extracted the flavour of your in- gredients : now strain the liquor, and thicken it as for a sauce blanche, gently heating your fillets of fish in the same : garnish with little bits of red chilli (cut into dice, and sprinkled over the fillets) and serve. The point here lies in the flavouring of the whito sauce in which you warm your fish : so do not omit any thing I have mentioned. 3.—“ First catch your duckling” eh ? well, I know they are not easy to get, hut let those who green J;eep ducks in their poultry yard try one before the breast-bone forms hard. The bone should be scarcely stronger than gristle if the bird be young enough. Roast, and do not stuff the duck- ling, let the basting be frequent, and froth the breast up nicely to finish with : serve, accompanied by green peas, and cook the potatoes according to any of the recipes given at page 136. N. B.—If your cook have a habit, as some have, of serv- ing the giblets of the duck in the gravy round the bird, put an end to it forthwith;—it is one of those quaint relics of barbarism which still cling to certain Indian kitchens. 4.—This vegetable, known as the “ snake vegetable,” cut into convenient lengths, boiled, drain- ed, its seeds removed, and the pieces finally heated up in a good brown gi-avy, is well worth tryiug when vegetables arc as scarce as r 0 d 01 0 n g-c a i in gravy.

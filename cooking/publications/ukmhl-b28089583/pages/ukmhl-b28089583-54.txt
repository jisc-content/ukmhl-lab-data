40 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. water shonld be poured round meat and bones that have been previously cooked. 5. A quart of water to half a pound of meat and bone is said to be the outside you can allow in England, but a smaller proportion will be found advisable in India—a quai’t to a pound for instance. In any circumstances there must be sufficient water to cover the meat and bone. 6. Remember that slow boiling, and retarding actual boiling as much as possible, are important points to start with. 7. Do not cover up your pot closely, the steam should evaporate to assist the strength of the soup, and keep it clear. 8. Skim frequently during the early stage of your pro- ceedings,—a cup of cold-water thrown into the pot causes the scum, or albumen, to come up quickly, and, of course, retards boiling. 9. Use a wooden spoon. 10. Put in your vegetables, flavouring herbs, &c., after the skimming is finished, and let them simmer till they are done. 11. Wash your vegetables very carefully before adding them. 12. As soon as the vegetables which are put into the pot-au-feu are done, they should be removed, and the heat imder the soup-kettle maintained at simmering point. 13. It will take four or five hours to extract the essence from a few pounds of beef, so begin as soon as you can, and don’t hurry the work. 14. It is better to season too little than too highly, so be very careful wheil adding pepper, hei'bs, &c.

CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 86 ounce of butter. Let it take colour, then add an ounce of flour by degrees, and when that has been well worked, half a pint of gravy, pepper and salt at discretion, and a pinch of sugar. When thoroughly mixed, and piping hot, pass the sauce through the tin strainer, catching up all lumps, and, at the last moment, stir in a table-spoonful of vinegar, and one of mixed mustard. Excellent with pork, veal, duck, and goose. Mustard sauce is made in this way :â€”Melt a couple of ounces of butter in a small sauce-pan, blend with it a dessert-spoonful of flour, and a heaped up tea-spoonful of French mustard with a pinch of salt: when thoroughly mixed, add half a pint of broth or water : let it come to the boil, then strain through the pointed strainer into a hot sauce-boat. If Durham mustard is used, a little vine- gar must be added. These sharp relishes go well with fish, and, as a change, are welcome with cutlets, etc. u\ . <

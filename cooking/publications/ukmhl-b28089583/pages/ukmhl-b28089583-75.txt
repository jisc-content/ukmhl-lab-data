HINTS ABOUT ENTREES. 61 and many, owing to tlie ambiguous wording of cookery book receipts, seem equally inaccessible. Tben tbe task of ordering disbes from works composed for people with English cooks, kitchen ranges, and the best market in the world at their disposal, is far from easy. Even those who fancy themselves to be pretty good cooks find, every now and then, in the pages of their pet author, knotty points which require much consideration to settle. But if you will patiently follow me, not rushing to the conclusion that I only write for the benefit of a few enthusiasts like myself, I firmly believe that I shall be able to smooth down much that appears rugged; and help you towards the selection and accomplishment of many tasty dishes, which, if neither elaborate, nor very scientific, will still be found practicable, and generally worthy of a second trial. First, let us divide entrees into three distinct classes :— the plain, the half-rich, and the fanciful. In the first class I would place such dishes as the mutton cutlet (neck chop) grilled, fried, or stewed; the epigramme; fillets of meat, turkey, fowl, rabbit, or pigeon ; grenadine; entrees of meat, that is to say, plainly cooked, accompanied by carefully devised sauces, or really good purees of vegetable. For class the second, I would reserve all compositions of meat requiring the mincing machine and the mortar,— delicate combinations which demand attentive flavourino-— such as cassolettes, croquettes, croustades, quenelles, houdins, timbales, rissolettes and mixed ingredients en caisses. Whilst in the superlative class should be entered, I think, the supreme, the vol-au-vent, the JcramousJcy, the studied ragout, the artistic salmis, and any entree out of class the second when raised from its ordinary form to a higher level by treatment d la financiere, d la Beine, d la Perigueux, and so on. 6

150 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. Tliere are several high, class ways of serving globe arti- chokes which I, of conrse, dedicate to my readers who happen to be staying on the Hills. First let me give yon directions for the trimming of an artichoke secundum artem. Place the raw vegetable bottom downwards on a board, and with a sharp knife at once cut it straight down, dividing it in half ; then divide each half BO obtained so that you have four quarters : next pare out the ‘ choke’ which adheres to each quarter, as you would core an apple, and trim off the leaves leaving about an eighth of an inch of them unsevered and adhering to the trimmed quarters. Drop each piece as you trim it into cold water in which a lime has been squeezed, or a table-spoonful of vinegar poured, to prevent its turning black, and when you have prepared enough for the dish you require, throw the quarters into boiling water with a dessert-spoonful of salt, and a spoonful of vinegar ; and in about fifteen minutes, when nearly done, lift them out and drain them. They may be now finished off in these several ways:— 1. —As “ heignets" :—^by being cut iuto slices dipped in batter, and fried in boiling fat till of a bright golden tint. 2. —Or,—“ au sauce hlanche" or “ bechamel," in which they should be gently simmered. 3. —Or,—“ d la maitre d'hotel" :—tossed in butter, and served on a hot silver dish, with the melted butter, a squeeze of lime juice and a sprinkling of very finely chopped curled parsley. 4. —Or,—“ au gratin'':—the pieces neatly disposed upon a silver dish, with a little gravy round them to keep them from burning, dusted over with very finely sifted bread- crumbs, chopped mushroom, parsley, and a little shallot, pepper, salt, and a piece of butter on the top of each piece, then baked for ten minutes and served hot.

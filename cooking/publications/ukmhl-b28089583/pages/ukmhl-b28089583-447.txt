MENU FOR A DINNER OF SIX. 433 serve. Care must be taken in pouring in each kind of cream to get every layer the same depth. This is best done by measuring with water how much liquid will go to make a layer of the required thickness, and then getting a cup which holds just that quantity, and using it to mea- sure the cream. » Perdreaux aux choux- This delicious dish deserves the closest attention, for it is perhaps the hest way of cooking Indian partridges :— Prepare four partridges as for boiling, with their legs tucked in : lard their breasts with bacon and put an onion inside each of them. Cut a nice cabbage into quarters, blanch them, and steep them in cold water for an hour. Now take a roomy stew-pan, line its bottom with two car- rots, and two large onions sliced in rings, a sprinkling of powdered herbs, and a dusting of salt, and pepper. Put the partridges above this lining, inserting a quarter of cabbage between each bird, a slice of bacon here and there, and some slices of Bologna or Brunswick sausage. Moisten with sufficient well made gravy to cover the birds. Boil closely covered up, and then simmer for an hour and a half if the birds are tender. Dish with the cabbage in the centre, and the birds placed neatly round it, with the sliced sausage and bacon as garnish. Serve the gravy in a boat.

76 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. ground-rice moulded: socles for cold entrees are even some- - times made of melted wax candle consolidated with bees’ wax. A flat socle for ordinary hot entrees is easily made with rice, which should he boiled, pounded, and then moulded with a wooden spoon into an oval or round block according to the shape of the dish.

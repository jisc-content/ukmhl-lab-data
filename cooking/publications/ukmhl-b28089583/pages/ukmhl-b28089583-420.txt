406 MENU FOR A DINNER OF SIX. and flatten the carcass before you with a cutlet bat. Make a forcemeat as follows:—five ounces stale bread-crumb, five ounces minced fat bacon, the rind of a lime minced fine, a dessert-spoonful each of thyme and marjoram, some spiced pepper, and salt, a table-spoonful of minced parsley, all bound with four eggs : mix this as previously describ- ed, and keep it by your side in a basin.

Envelop this in a clean cloth, and tie it up cai'efully with cross strings to preserve the oval shape of the galantine. Set this in a deep stew-pan, cover it well with weak stock in which a claret-glass of Madeira has been introduced, and simmer gently for three or four hours. When done, lift it out, drain it, take off the cloth, wrap it in a fresh dry

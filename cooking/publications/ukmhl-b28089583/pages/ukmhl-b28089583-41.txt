IN THE STORE-ROOM. 27 cook and his mistress, and I am inclined to tkmk that Ramasamy is generally in tke wrong. Still, we skonld be carefnl lest we limit bis supply of fuel too closely espe- cially on a dinner party day. I once was a guest at a bouse where tbe dinner was served perfectly as far as tbe joint, wben a sudden collapse took place; tbe game and dressed vegetable were stone-cold. Tbe excuse tbe next day was, “ charcoal all done finish, and Missis only got godown key in tbe pocket.” Unless yon have tided to find out practically what can be done with tbe fish, flesh, fowl, and vegetables of this country, by studious cookery, you will scarcely believe tbe extent of your power, and bow independent you really are of preserved provisions. It is absolutely annoying to read tbe nonsense people write about our style of living in India. I remember an article beaded “ Curry and Rice” which once appeared in Vanity Fair. Tbe writer wrecked on tbe rock upon which many drift, who, with a little knowledge of tbe peculiarities of some particular part of the country, sit down with impudent confidence to treat of India generally, quite forgetting that tbe Peninsula is a large one, and that tbe manners and customs which obtain in one district, may never have been beard of in other parts of tbe Empire. Tbe article was not applicable to any part of tbe Madras Presidency, and judging from the winter’s suggestions as to tbe cookery of a tin of beef with yams, and worse still, tbe fabrication of soup from the fowl bones you picked and left at luncheon, I should say that Vanity bad picked up not only an ignoramus, but an uncleanly ignoramus, as a contributor. Our friends at Home were told by this audacious man that no dinner was complete in India without a “ burning curry,” and that none was successful “ without Europe tins.” I think that, as we go on, I shall be able to prove that at Madras, at all events, we can do pretty well without either.

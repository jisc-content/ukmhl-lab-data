CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 34 white of an egg, thus :—Break an egg, and throw the white and the shell together into a slop basin,—be care- ful not to let an atom of the yolk go in,—beat the Avhite and shell up to a stiff froth, and mix it, flake by flake, very completely with the cool soup. Put the soup into a saucepan, and set it on the Are, stuu-ing well till it boils. Take it off immediately, cover it close, let it stand for a quarter of an hour, and then strain it off through the tamis, or haii’ sieve. Let me here point out the cause of another misadven- ture in the satisfactory appearance of a clear soup,—one that often occurs in consomme with maccaroni, vermicelli, and pearl-barley. You have got your stock as bright and clear as sherry, but after adding the ingredients just men- tioned “ a change comes over the spirit of your dream,”— the soup turns cloudy. The reason is this : preserved fari- naceous food of the maccaroni class often contains dirt, —dirt that you do not perceive, and which can only be removed by parboiling. Accordingly, whenever you in- tend to add it to consomme, you should hoil it independently in plain water in order that the outside dirty part may be washed off by becoming dissolved. Plain washing in water is not enough; besides, washing maccaroni is the act of an ignoramus. There is another feature in a clear soup which I have reserved for special attention, and that is the colouring. Now, an idea prevails amongst numbers of English people that a soup to be good and strong must be dark-coloured. Old-fashioned people speak of your modern consomme as a weak, washy composition only flt for foreigners. But if you take the very self-same liquor and brovTi it with a lot of burnt onion, and thicken it with flour and butter, they are perfectly satisfied. Did you ever make jug- ged beef tea for a sick friend, the strongest possible essence of raw lean beef ? Was not the liquor so obtained

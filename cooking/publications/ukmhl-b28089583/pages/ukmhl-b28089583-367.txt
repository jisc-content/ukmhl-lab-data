A crab for Clear fish sonp. instance answers the purpose admir- ably, but any fish will do. Let us take the crab. Make ordinary clear consomme for the number you expect. One large crab or two small ones ^11 sufiice for eight basins. Boil the crab: drain and clean It : pick out the flesh, saving that of the claws for garmshmg. Pound the rest of the meat and shells in a mortar, put the whole of it into the consomme you have made, with a little bag containing a quarter ounce of dried basil, and boil gently for half an hour, strain through a fine sieve, or tamis cloth,—it should now be bright and clear,—heat it up again, and pour it into your soup tureen over some little quenelles made of the claw meat you saved.

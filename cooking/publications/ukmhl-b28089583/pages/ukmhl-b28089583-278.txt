CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 264 and when this is done, and the paste half mixed, sprinkle over it another quarter pint of water in which the lime has been squeezed. Mix it all now thoroughly, until it ceases to adhere to the slab, and pat it into a round ball. Now take one pound weight of the clarified suet, cut it up into dice, and flatten out the ball of paste to a thick- ness of about two inches, spreading the suet evenly over its surface; then fold the four sides of the paste to the centre enclosing the suet, and forming a square piece. Roll this evenly out a yard long, then fold over one-third of the length towards the centre, and fold the other third over it. This folding in three is called by cooks “ giving the paste one turn.” Be careful that none of the suet breaks through the edges of the paste as you roll it out. Having folded up the paste, let it rest for ten minutes in the ice-box, or on a very cold slab. Then give it two turns, rest ten minutes, then two turns more,—five rolls out in all,—lastly, gather the paste into a lump, and roll it according to your requirements. For patties, vols-au-vent, ^-c., seven turns are recom- mended by some authors. Keep the flour dredger at your elbow, and flour the rolling-pin well before each turn. The sooner the paste is used when it has been completed the better. If you have a little good iced butter, you may alter the above proportions as follows :—three-quarters of a pound of suet, and one-quarter of a pound of butter. The yolks of two eggs well beaten and strained may be mixed with the water. Baking powder may be used advantageously in pastry- making: here is Yeatman & Co.’s recipe for puff paste made in connection with their powder : Measure three breakfast-cupfuls of flour, carefully sifted, and two cupfuls of butter.

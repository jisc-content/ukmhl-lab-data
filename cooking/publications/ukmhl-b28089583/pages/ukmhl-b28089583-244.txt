230 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. place it in the bain-marie, or over a very moderate fire, melt a dessert-spoonful of butter in it, stir into it the bande- cai pulp, and two good table-spoonfuls of cream with the yolk of one egg. Continue stirring one way until the contents of your sauce-pan look nice and thick, and steam- ing hot; then pour the mixture over the toasts, and serve. A dust of grated Parmesan cheese should be shaken over the surface of the toasts as an embellishment, and Nepaul pepper should he handed round. Very young Brinjals (binegun) may be treated exactly in the same manner as the foregoing, as also the pods of the moringa (“ drum-stick”) tree. Be sure that you select tender, pods for toast-makmg, or the result will disappoint you. A very superior dish of this kind can be concocted if you happen to be able to obtain the flower-pod of a cocoa- nut palm. Treat the buds of the embryo flower which the pod contains as laid down for bande-cai; that is to say, boil the flower, after you have cut it out of the pod, in salt and water till tender, then cut off the buds, and heat them up in a sauce-pan in thickened cream, or in milk thickened with the yolks of two eggs, pour them over hot fried toasts, which should be sent up immediately. The white stalhs of the flower, if quite young, can be served exactly like asparagus, i. e.:—boiled, laid iu a very hot dish, with plenty of butter melting over them, or maitre d'hotel butter if at hand, and assisted by “ Dutch sauce.” No toast is needed in this case. The cocoanut flower-pods can be obtained now and then at Madras, for the toddy-drawers cut them off when tapping the palms for sap. I can strongly recommend my readei's to try both the dishes I have mentioned. Sardine toast, herring toast, cod’s-roe toast, pil- chard TOAST, SALMON TOAST, &c., &c., are all nice, and

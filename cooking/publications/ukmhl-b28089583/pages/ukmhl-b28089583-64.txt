CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 50 are other aiits to be got in India that wonld well repay the trouble of a trial, in the same way. All green vegetable purees derive enrichment in appear- ance by the judicious addition of “ spinach-greening” which is, in itself, the liquor obtained from spinach boiled, drain- ed, worked through the sieve, and then squeezed through a piece of muslin. I have seen people quite deceived with a soup made with dried peas and coloured with “ spinach- greening” in imitation of piiree de pois verts. A pinch of sugar ought not to be forgotten in making these soups. The enterprising cultivators of asparagus at Madras ought now and then to indulge their guests with that excellent soup puree d’aspei-ges,” which however ranks next, I take it, to the still more artistic “ consomme aux points d'asperges." You can make a capital green puree any day at Madras with French beans j and with one tin oi petits pois (thought- fully assisted with spinach-greening if the peas have lost colour) you can produce a very perfect puree of green peas for about eight people. A very inviting-looking soup of bright colour can be made from tomatoes, following exactly the receipt for “ Crecy,” and substituting tomatoes for carrots. Brown purees are, of course, those made of game such as hares, partridges, snipe, wild duck, teal, etc. In this way you can always advantageously dispose of tough old birds. A good puree de gibier, of hare, or of any game- bird, is, without doubt, soup which is with justice widely popular. It is essentially the soup of the hungry man. A basin of it, to use a homely phrase, “ goes a long way.” It carries your thoughts back to winter fires, to old-fashion- ed, yet generous fare, and to the glorious appetite with which you spread your napkin before you after a day with the hounds, a tnidge after wild partridges, or a long drive through the keen frosty am of some by-gone Christmastide !

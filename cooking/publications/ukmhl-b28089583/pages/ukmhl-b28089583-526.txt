OUR KITCHENS IN INDIA. 512 the oven with that of the boiler, forming a very fair hot- plate. This iron sheet was movable at pleasure. The topmost outer bar of the cresset was also movable to allow a space for the admission of fuel when the hot-plate was fixed. The smoke was made to pass into a flue contrived with a few feet of ready-made stove piping, which passed through the wall of the kitchen at the back of the fire grate, and was then led up the wall to the roof. But by far the best thing introduced in this locally de- signed kitchen was an English roasting “jack.” The “jack” itself was imported from home at a cost of half a sovereign; the fire screen, and dripping pan were made by the bazar tinman ; the “ jack” was hung from a beam fixed in the wall at a convenient height above the fire grate. Every joint was in this manner roasted more Anglico. Dripping, a thing previously unknown in the establish- ment, became a highly valued commodity ; and the meat was invariably sent up full of gravy, and with that crisp browning that can only be obtained by carefully roasting. A little more charcoal was used in the “ jack” system than in the old way with the spit, but the expense was more than balanced by the dripping gained, the good gravy, and the additional juiciness of the meat. Charcoal was used for roasting work, and good dry wood was found sufficient for soups, and all common boiling operations, when no roasting was needed. The strange thing was that both the butler and the cook were as delighted with the innova- tion as children with a new toy. I hope that this may encourage some of my readers to cariy out a similar scheme. I have spoken of the American cooking stoves fed by mineral oil, in Chapter XXX. The popularity of these very excellent domestic articles is increasing daily, and I need scarcely point out theii’ value in the reformed kitchen system that I have endeavoured to discuss. One of them

MENU FOR A LITTLE HOME DINNER. 469 large or small, may be used, and many fanciful devices may be worked with this composition. The almond should be cut smaller for intricate designs, and in all cases the work must be done quickly, for the sugar soon becomes too stiff to be spread into position. â™¦ Endive. Endive (chicorie,) as grown in Southern India, is per- haps better when cooked than when presented raw in salad, for it lacks the crispness which the plant acquires at home in the winter. Endives should be trimmed for cooking by picking off the outside leaves, and cutting off the green tips. The heads should then be severed by a cut across the stalk, detaching all the leaves therefrom. Thus every leaf can be examined and cleaned. When this has been done, and the leaves have been drained dry, cast them into a roomy vessel full of boiling water with half an ounce of salt. Unlike spinach, which merely takes five minutes, endives must be boiled for twenty-five. When tender, drain, press out the water, and chop fine on a clean board, finishing as explained for spinach. If you simmer the endive leaves in consomme for two hours, and then increase the fire, stirring till the leaves have absorbed the broth, and finally moistening them with some rich bechamel and a pat of butter, you will have the correct foundation for a blanquette a la Talleyrand, i.e., neat pieces of cooked chicken heated up in the endive sauce.

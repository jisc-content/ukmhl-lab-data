PASTRY-MAKING, ET CETERA. 271 sufficient water to make a smooth, pliant paste. Roll it out, and it will be ready for use. A basin is the best thing to use for the boiling : rub it well with butter, line it with the paste rolled at least half an inch thick, close over the top securely, tie the basin up with a cloth, and steam the pudding slowly for three hours. To ensure success, a pudding cannot be too slowly boiled. A really excellent beefsteak pudding can be made by preparing the beef as laid down for pies, viz. :â€” Cut the meat into thin collops, place a thin slice of cold cooked bacon over each collop, season this with spiced pepper, and roll each collop up. Line the pudding basin with paste, and fill it with layers of collops, pour in among the collops a little strong gravy, close the paste securely and boil for three hours. For BEEFSTEAK AND OYSTER PUDDING, roll an Oyster inside each collop. For beefsteak and kidney, cut the kidney into strips and treat them in the same way, rolling slices of kidney and bacon inside each collop. Excellent puddings are made with birds, boned, and rolled up with a slice of bacon, and any nice stuffing, inside them. Take a brace of partridges, for instance, and bone them, lay them out flat, putting a few thin slices of cooked bacon over them, over that strew some chopped mush- rooms, their livers chopped, a little minced shallot, and a good dusting of spiced pepper ; roll the birds up and put them into the pudding basin, pour in a little rich gravy made from their bones, &c., close the paste over them, and boil for three hours. This is obviously practicable with any game.

419 MENU FOR A DINNER OF SIX. knack needed in beating tbis paste to prevent its curdling. Should tbis happen, it can be remedied by beating as quickly as possible until the mixture is smooth again. Take a slab of Oenoise, spread on the top of it the thinnest possible coating of apricot jam, then a coating of chocolate icing. Put it into a very hot oven for rather less than a minute, take it out, and place it in a cold place to get cool. Then cut it up with a sharp knife in any shapes you like. Chocolate Icing.—Put into a sauce-pan |lb. of powder- ed loaf sugar, 2 oz. of grated chocolate, a tea-spoonful of vanilla essence, and about a gill of water; stir on the fire until the mixture assumes the consistence of a thick smooth cream. 4 The following recipe I have to acknowledge with thanks from “ Bahut Bursina”;— “ Beignets d’Avenches.—Take a new loaf and cut it into slices three quarters of an inch thick. Trim off all crust, cut into convenient slices,- marinade in milk, or in cream if available, flavoured with your favourite essence. Take up the slices, drain them, and fry them in a deep bath of boiling fat, or butter, till a golden yellow : spread apricot or any nice preserve over them, and serve hot.” It would be better perhaps to call the dish croutes d I Avenehes, as by the word beignet we generally undei’- stand that the thing to be fried is dipped in batter.

CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 29(5 making, ordinarily followed by native cooks, is familiar, will, perhaps, think, that the process I have recommended is needlessly tronhlesome. The separate frying of the chicken, the period of rest in the bain-marie, ^c., may seem to them imnecessary. I am, however, perfectly con- fident that in order to produce a dish of a superior class, we must be prepared to take all this trouble, bringing an enlightened system of cookery to bear upon the condi- ments and ingredients which, so to speak, provide the curry flavour. I look upon a chicken curry as a fricassee, or hlanquette d V Indienne, and consider that it should cer- tainly be treated according to the principles of scientific cookery. The soaking of meat in the liquid cui’ry-stuff is an im- portant point, especially when previously cooked meat is to be curried. Remember how much better a salmis or a hash tastes if the meat of which it is composed has been marinaded for an hour or so, before being finally heated up, in the carefully-made gravy or sauce composed for it. This, I think, accounts for an opinion I once heard expressed by a friend of undoubted ability in culinary criticism, to the effect that he always found cm-ries of a certain kind better when warned up and sexwed as a rechauffe than when presented for the first time. If a gravy curry be kept during the night in a china cui’ry dish, and be resuscitated the next morning with some fresh butter, onions and a little gravy, it ought, if anything, to be found better than on the previous night, since the meat has become thoroughly flavoured by the curry gravy, while the latter has become reduced and so strengthened by the second simmering. These directions will be found pi’acticable with most ordinary meat curries. Those made of fresh fish, prawns, and shellfish, requh-e a somewhat diffei'eut process while

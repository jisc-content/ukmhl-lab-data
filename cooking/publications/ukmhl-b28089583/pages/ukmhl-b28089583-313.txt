CURRIES— CONTINUED. 290 a few bony atoms of mutton, with its surface beflecked, if I may so describe it, with glossy discs of molten grease. Not exactly the sort of dish to tempt a lady, still slightly affected by vial-de-mer, who has been urged by her stew- ardess to rouse herself, “poor dear,” and try and eat something. Having had this mess thrust before him day after day for three weeks, no wonder that the “ vacuus viator'’ finds something in the curry of Ceylon to delight him. “ Good! said I to myself, cheered at the sight” (a plump, freshly-roasted leveret), wrote Brillat Savarin con- cerning his experiences of a journey ; “ I am not entirely abandoned by Providence : a traveller may gather a flower hy the loay-side.” Regarding the Ceylon curry, then, as a “ flower by the way-side,” let us proceed to consider its composition with all due attention.

The knotty point is the treatment and application of the cocoanut, which should be as fresh and juicy as possible, and of which there should bo no stint. In places where cocoanuts cannot be readily procured,

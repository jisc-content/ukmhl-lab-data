NOTES ON THE CURING OF MEAT. 255 will be then necessary. Syringe the brine well into the meat during the pickling period, and turn it frequently. A “ mutton ham” is a capital thing for rough travelling times, the meat should be cured exactly as the joints of beef just spoken of. “ Spiced ieef” is an excellent thing in its turn. Choose a nice brisket, or a fleshy piece of the flank for this opera- tion. Remove all bones. Rub the joint well with salt, and let it lie in the brine already described for about two days. Then spread it out flat, dry it, and lay a coating of the following spices over the inside (in the same manner as you would spread jam over the paste before making a rolypoly pudding) :—half an ounce of cloves, half an ounce of pepper corns (ground), half an ounce of mace, a table- spoonful of finely minced parsley, half one of marjoram, the chopped rind of a nice yellow lime, peeled very finely, and a dust of Nepaul pepper : roll up the brisket and tie it tightly with a string. Stew it patiently until tender ; set it, when done, under a weight; when cold, remove the string, trim the joint neatly, glaze it, and when the glaze is dry, the beef may be considered ready for the table. A couple of glasses of Madeira mixed with the liquor in which the beef is cooked will improve the flavour greatly. Pressed heef should come to table in a rectangular shape : saltpetre is not wanted in its curing as we do not require the red colour which is generally liked in humps, briskets, &c. Choose a nice fleshy piece of the flank, with fat and lean, pretty equally balanced. Rub it carefully with salt, and “ spiced pepper,” and let it rest in brine (without saltpetre) for forty-eight hours : then drain it dry, wip6 it, and stew it gently till nice and tender. When done, set it on a dish with a weight above it, and let it get quite cold. The weight must then be removed, and the joint must be neatly trimmed in a rectangular

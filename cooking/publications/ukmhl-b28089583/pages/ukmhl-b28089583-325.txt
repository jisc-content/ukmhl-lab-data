MULLIGATUNNY. fear of disturbing the flavour derived from the cuiuy-stuff. The soup itself may be ordinary consomme, consomme de volaille or hlond de veau. Clear ox-tail thus flavoured is well-known at the Army and Navy Club in London under the name of queue de bceuf ii I Indienne. Fish consomme, i.e., a stock made from fish and vege- tables, makes a capital basis for a thick mulligatunny ; and a Usque or piiree of shell-fish, flavoured with curry- paste, is a right royal potage. Vegetarians can fall back upon a stock composed of vegetables, consomme de legumes. This, artfully flavoured with a good mulligatunny paste, thickened with flour and butter, and enriched with lait d’amandes, cocoanut milk, cream, or raw yolks of eggs, will be found to make a most excellent soupe maigre. The stock should be composed as follows :—Weigh, when trimmed and cut up, one pound, each, of carrots and onions. Throw them into a stew-pan, with half a pound of butter (tinned butter will do well), a bunch of parsley, and a couple of otmces of celery. Fry until the vegetables begin to take colour, then moisten with two quai’ts of hot water. Boil and skim, then put into the pan half an ounce of salt, a quarter ounce of black peppercorns, and a pint measure of shelled green peas. Simmer for three hours, skim off any oil that may rise from the butter, and strain the broth into a basin through a tamis. Be careful in using turnips. Unless they are very young they are apt to be overstrongly flavoured in this country. Leeks are invaluable ; if available I would put half a pound of them in with the carrots; a few sprigs of thyme or marjoram are also useful. A pint of French beans may be used instead of, or in addition to, the peas. This consomme is, with a dash of white wine, quite fit to serve alone. Maccaroni or vermicelli may be added to it as a garnish, and grated Parmesan may accompany it.

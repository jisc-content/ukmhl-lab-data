186 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. o£ this kind, not long ago, the complete success of which has encouraged me to advocate its adoption in supersession of luncheons at 2 p.m. The Frenchman takes his cafe au lait, with a roll, as we take our chota hazri, which slight refection carries him satisfactorily till eleven, or even twelve o’clock; the dejeuner d la fourchette is then a sub- stantial meal. Cannot we, when there are no distracting office hours to think of, do likewise ? A breakfast party ends about the hour that luncheons begin. Both hosts and guests have, therefore, ample time to recover their appe- tites, and to indulge in a quiet afternoon’s rest, before the evening drive, and dinner. A pleasant luncheon or breakfast party should possess the following characteristics :—a judiciously selected list of guests, a prettily arranged table, a light yet artistic menu, with cups of claret, sauterne, hock, or chablis, iced ad libitum, and in no way spoilt by sugar. Liqueurs may be handed round to finish with, and the best coffee you can make should follow. In composing your menu, you should avoid adhering in any way to the order and style of a dinner. Thus, you must not give any soup at all, but lead off with oysters in their shells accompanied by brown bread and butter cut thin, limes cut into quarters, and vinegars and peppers of kinds. An old standing dish to commence a luncheon party used to be mulligatunny. If properly made, this soup is a meal in itself : there are so many condiments, spices, and highly flavoured elements in its composition,—not to mention the concomitant ladleful of rice which custom decrees,—that he who partakes of it finds the delicate power of his palate vitiated, as far as the appreciation of any dainty p lat that may follow is concerned, whilst the edge of his appetite is left unto him sorely blunted. So I say, reserve mulligatunny for your luncheon at home when alone, enjoy it thoroughly, rice and all, and—nothing more.

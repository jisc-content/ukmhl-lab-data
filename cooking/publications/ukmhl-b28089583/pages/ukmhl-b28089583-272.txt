—♦— Pastry-making, ef cetera, tLTHOUGH it is generally admitted tliat the clever pastry-cook is, like the Poet, born, not made; or, in other words, that the art of making really good pastry is a gift, rather than an accomplishment, there can be no doubt that the chef of average capacity is capable of improving himself by studying the rules which govern this branch of his profession. Ramasamy stands in great need of instruction here, for his ideas of pastry are, as a rule, crude in the extreme. He is acquainted apparently with two standard compositions alone, which he distin- guishes by the terms “ butter crust,” and “ suet crust.” The former is a kind of short bread, the latter a humble apology for puff paste. His selection of the one or of the other, if left to himself, is guided by one law :—“ butter crust” for sweet things, and “ suet crust” for savoury. Concerning the former I have but little to say. In my opinion it is so very inferior to puff paste, that I recommend its use in no branch of cookery whatever. If a cook be wholly incapable of making eatable puff pastry, he may, of course, be permitted to fall back upou his “ butter crust,” but I would never allow him to do so unless quite satisfied of his incompetence. “ Suet crust,” on the other hand, is the “ subject of my story” for I think that with a little careful teaching Ramasamy is capable of achieving very fair results with it.

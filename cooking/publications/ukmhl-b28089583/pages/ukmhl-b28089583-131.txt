He will tell you, in all probability, that “ mixted the fowl and soup-meat, cannot come the good taste,” and when you insist upon a trial, he will go away sorrowful, for the broth produced in boiling a fowl in the ordinary way, is his perquisite (or rather we do not ask for it) and “ mixted with rice only,” makes, with a chilli or two, a bowl of “ pish-pash.” Nevertheless, the fact exists beyond a doubt that a fowl is vastly improved by being thus cooked ; it remains for you to decide whe- ther, as a matter of policy, it would be wise to vex “ your best friend” by ordering so great an innovation.

If you follow the advice I have given, you will find fifteen to twenty minutes per pound a reliable allowance. Dis- cretion and experience will enable you to decide what orders to give.

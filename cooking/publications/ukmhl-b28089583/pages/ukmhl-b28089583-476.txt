Maccaroni au gratin should be quite moist, and thoroughly impregnated with the flavom’ of cheese: the presence of mustard should also be per- ceptible. ♦ Chaud-froid de filets de foie gras- This is a very nice cold entree. Open a tin of foie gras, and slice it very carefully in slices about half an inch thick ; out of these slices trim some nicely shaped fillets, Cashmeer shawl patterns, or ovals. Put them on a fiat dish, and mask them with chicken chaud-froid glaze. When the glaze has set, trim each fillet neatly, and set them in a circle with their masked sides outwards upon a socle of ground rice which should be spread with butter for them to adhere to it. Points d’asperges, flageolets, or a macedoine, moistened with pure cream, should fill the centre of the circle. Serve very cold.

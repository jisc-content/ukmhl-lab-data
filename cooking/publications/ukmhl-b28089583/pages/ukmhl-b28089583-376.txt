Now pack your croustades exactly like miniature vols-au- vent, with pieces of rabbit, slices, or dice of tongue or ham, the rabbit’s kidney, and the other ingredients, cut to fit the cases, moistening the whole well with your creamy veloute : put a slice of truffle on the top of each, and cover it with the cap that you cut to fit it.

Boil again, adding oS the fire two ounces of maitre dlwtel butter, let it thicken and serve it in a boat as hot as pos- sible. Potatoes, French beans, and a nice salad should accompany.

While baking, you can simmer the hones and trimmings of the neck, with a couple of sheep’s feet cleaned and cut up, and make a clear yet strong broth; this, when cold, should solidify as jelly; flavour it with pepper and salt, and after the pie has been baked, pour a little of it through an opening in the top of the cover. Set the pie in the ice- box, and when quite cold, serve. (h.)

Next make a forcemeat as follows:—Take the livers of the birds and that of the hare, and mince them finely; mince the spare meat of the hare, and a quarter of a pound of ham and throw the whole of the mince into a frying-pan, in which 25

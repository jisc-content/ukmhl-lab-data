CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 320 paper, on the baking tin, and set them in the oven ; look at them after twenty minutes’ baking, and take them out as soon as their colour indicates that they are done. “Half pound plain loaf” ;—Half a pound of flour, two tea-spoonfuls of Yeatman’s powder, a salt-spoonful of salt, and four or five table-spoonfuls of water. Work this as above, reserving the baking powder to the last, set the dough in a tin, or form it in the well-known “ cottage” shape, and bake. The ordinary cookery book receipts for fancy breads can be safely followed if you remember the proportion of the baking powder to the pound of flour, and, where eggs are propounded, make an allowance for the difference which exists between the English and the Indian egg. In rising Yeatman’s powder, do not let your made rolls, or bread, stand waiting for the oven : see that your baking appara- tus is all but ready before you commence making the bread. You will observe that I recommend the baking powder to be put into the dough, nob mixed with the flour in a. dry state to start with. In London Mr. Woolf follows the latter method. I cannot explain what causes it, but I have found that the bread never turns out so satisfactorily here, if the powder be put in early: the temperature may have something to do with this; at all events, experience seems to show that the powder expends its effect to a great extent, during the working of the dough, if mixed with the flour first; whereas, if put in as a finishing touch, the bread being rapidly consigned to the oven, the result is invariably satisfactory. I advise home-bakei'S to make rolls rather than large loaves. There is less waste with them. A roll is either eaten in toto or left untouched. If intact, you have merely to dip it in milk, and put it into the oven—damp; it will turn out again almost as freshly as a now roll. Brcail.

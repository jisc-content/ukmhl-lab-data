106 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. Poultry, ducks, and geese, are far better braised than roasted, unless you keejJ a fowl-yard of your own, and feed and kill tlie birds at home. To braise poultry well, you must make the gravy from the giblets, and trimmings of the birds, assisted by a little gravy-meat. In fact all braises are better if you help the gravy with a little extra meat. The French throw in a glass or two of light white wine when braising poultry, and Madeira or Marsala is a sterling aid in cooking mutton or beef in this method. A slice of bacon is very effective with all braised meat. If you must roast your little joint, see that it is not spitted,—that is, thrust through by the spit; with a little care, a small Indian joint can easily be tied to it. Do not let your cook use coarse wooden skewers, but make him tie a joint into a shape, for every stab inflicted in it, will rob the piece of meat of its juiciness. Tastes vary so strangely as to the “ doing” of meat, that it is impossible to give a rule for roasting. It is, however, essential to use an equal fire throughout the process, and to guard against cooking the outside too fast. Frequent basting is a sine qua non, and you should di*edge a little flour over the meat to finish with, to produce a crisp, brown, frothy surface. You should preserve the fat of your sii’loin, or loin of mutton, by tying over it a wrapper of buttered paper. The French place their small joints in marinade, a cus- tom I strongly advocate for the poor meat of this country, when you intend to roast or grill it. Here is their method of cooking a loin of mutton en papillate :—Trim the loin nicely, and let it lie fi-om morning till roasting time e7i marinade, composed of a breakfast-cupful of salad oil, two onions, and a carrot, sliced fine as for Julienne, with some whole peppers, salt, chopped parsley, and a

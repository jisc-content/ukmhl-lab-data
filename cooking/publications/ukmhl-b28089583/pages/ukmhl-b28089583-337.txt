323 CAMP COOKERY. spoonful of Marsala should be added, and the soup served. The pieces of fowl if not over-cooked, may be served in the form of fricassee, or be bread-crumbed or dipped in batter and fried, and served with maccaroni and tomato conserve. Very valuable stock, remember, can be made from cold roast mutton bones—(do not try raxo mutton, the taste will be tallowy)—assisted by bacon skin, bones and trim- mings, a thick slice of Brunswick or Bologna sausage, and a chicken, or any game you can spare. Birds that have been mauled in shooting can thus be utilized. Purees of game can be made if you have taken out your utensils if not, you must make the game broth as strong as possible, helped by a fowl as stock, and thicken it with flour. The addition of Marsala or port is, of course, a sine qua non. Tinned fish served,—as you sometimes see salmon at a dinner party,—plainly, and hot is positively nasty, and in no way improved by a cold sauce like tartare. Who, after a moment’s reflection, could send up hot fish with a cold sauce ? Preserved salmon, fresh herrings, and other tinned fresh fish, if served with tartare or mayonnaise sauces should be served cold, after having been carefully drained on a sieve from all the tinny juices which adhered to them. Select nicely sized pieces, place them on a dish with any garnish you may have such as olives farcies, capers, sliced gherkins, and rolled anchovies, and send the sauce round in a boat. If you want a hot dish of tinned fish, you must choose the nicest pieces and gently warm them up in a rich matelote sauce, veloute or poulette, or you must wrap them in oiled paper and broil them a moment. All trimmings and odd bits can be saved and worked up as rissoles, or in any of the ways I have mentioned for cold fish in my chapter on rechauffes.

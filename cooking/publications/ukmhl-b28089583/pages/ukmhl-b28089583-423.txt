Dessert. 1.—This, I need scarcely say, is “oxtail soup !” Buy a shin and a half of beef, and make the Oxtail soup, (clear). , , , , , best gravy you can as usual: take an oxtail, and when the shin consomme is ready early in the afternoon, (you should commence boiling the shin as soon as you can) separate the tail at the joints, and throw the pieces into your stock pot with two Bombay onions, two carrots, a stick of celery, and a muslin bag containing sweet herbs, parsley, a dozen pepper corns, and a clove of garlic ; add a wine-glass of mushroom ketchup, a tea- spoonful of caramel, and simmer the soup for a couple of hours skimming it carefully. If wanted clear, all that is now needed is to strain and clarify the liquor, saving a few joints of the tail as a garnish, a table-spoonful of Madeira with a squeeze of a lime, and a pinch of sugar being added to finish with.

OUR KITCHENS IN INDIA. 507 OTIS otlier baseless nostrums in the usual course of things ; for people could scarcely have forgotten—even forty years ago—that dwellings built for persons of three hundred a year at home were considered uninhabitable unless equip- ped with a kitchen range that at least cost thirty pounds.

328 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. Ramasamy sometimes envelopes his hare in a coating of light hatter. Pray caution him never to do so again. “ Jugged hare” is perhaps the best dish for camp life ; by many it is considered in any circumstances the best. This is a simple recipe:—Proceed as in the foregoing receipt as far as the skinning and cleaning is concerned. When ready, cut the hare up into neat pieces, dredge them Tvith flour, and give them a fevr turns in the frying-pan with some butter till they take colour. Prepare beforehand a pint and a half of good strong stock (that of a fowl will do in camp) and choose a vessel that you can close securely with paste : put the pieces of hare into it, with two carrots, two or three large onions, an ounce of celery, the juice of two limes, a table-spoonful of sugar, and one of salt; pour in the stock, throw in a wine-glass of brandy, and seal the vessel as closely as possible; place it in a pan of cold water, and set it to boil, steaming the covered pot for three hours. When done, open the pot, stir into it a bumper glass of port, a dessert-spoonful of red currant jelly, and a lump of butter rolled in flour.* Serve with a dozen balls of stuffing made as for roast hare, and fried in butter. Instead of steaming the jar, it may be placed in the oven and baked for two or three hours. An excellent hash may be made of a cold roast hare in this w'ay :—Trim off as much of the meat as you can find in slices, and cut out what remains of the stuffing: break np all the bones and put them with the skin and scraps into a stew-pan with a large onion cut up, pepper-coms, a bit of celery if possible, and any vegetable, a little spice, any sauce that may have been left, a couple of glasses of red wine and enough water to cover the bones, &c., sim- mer these ingredients for an hour and a half, and then * Or you may etrain the gravy, thicken it with flour and butter, add the wine, &c., and pour it over tlic moat again.—W.

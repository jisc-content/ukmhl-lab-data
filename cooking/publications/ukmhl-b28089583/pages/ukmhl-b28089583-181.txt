Fritters of the former are nice if the slices be marinaded in a little brandy and lime-juice, and then dipped in a well-made batter. Tams may be treated in most of the ways recommended for potatoes. In short, if we look about us, and try our best to make the most of the vegetables of the country, by careful cookery of the reformed school, we need never be without a pleasant dish to relieve the ding-dong monotony of oiir market supplies. The more you hunt about amongst the produce of the native gardens, the more surprised you will be at the opportunities afforded you of practising your culinary ingenuity. For over a centmy we have been contented to see a few country vegetables sent up in curries, and in curries only, never attempting to develop their latent good qualities by artistic treatment. There are times when the supply of vegetables grown from English seed may fail us, or when we cannot expect to procure them ; when on the line of march, for instance, out in the j tingles, or when quartered at some little place far from the busy haunts of our fellow white men ; the amateur who has studied native vegetables will then dis- cover that his time has not been thrown away.

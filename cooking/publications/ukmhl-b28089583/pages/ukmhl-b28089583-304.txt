290 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. of sweetish chutney and a little vinegar or lime juice can be employed, but I confess that I prefer the red currant jelly as aforesaid. There are also certain green leaves which are undoubt- edly not to be despised as flavouring agents. By their means flavours can be effectively changed. I will speak of them again when discussing the process of curry-making step by step. Then there is that most important item the cocoanut. This, as everyone knows, is added to a curry in the form of “ milk,” i.e., an infusion produced by scraping the white nutty part of the cocoanut, and soaking the scrap- ings in boiling water. This, strained, is the “ milk” required in curry-making. The quantity to be used de- pends upon the natm-e of the curry.

If put in too soon, the value of the nutty juice will be lost, —cooked away, and overpowered by the spicy condiments with which it is associated. So we must reserve the “ milk,” as we do cream or the yolk of an egg in the case of a thick soup or rich sauce, and stir it into our curry the last thing just before serving.

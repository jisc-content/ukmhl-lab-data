MENU FOR A DINNER OF SIX. 412 cupful of boiling cream (or milk in which the yolk of an egg has been stirred, and heated up to the consistency of thin custard) and serve poured over the fowl.

Onion stuffed witli kidneys. 5. —This is a dish of “ Bombay onions stuffed with kidneys,” a most excellent savoury entremets if carefully done. Take six large Bombay onions : have ready ten sheep’s kidneys, scalded, and skinned, but uncooked. Boil the onions till three parts done; take them out, drain them; slice off the top of each one (as you would treat an egg) and carefully remove the inside, leaving a hollow big enough to hold two small kidneys cut into eight pieces ; take two anchovies, pick out their spines and cut the fish into little squares : have some minced parsley handy, a lime, and some of the inside of the onion that yon scooped out, minced and peppered ; put a lump of butter into the onion case first, then a little of the minced onion peppered, then yoiu’ pieces of kidney, with little bits of anchovy here and there, and crown the top again with minced onion, and a pat of butter ; a drop or so of lime juice should be given during the packing, and an occasional dust of spiced pepper. Now place the cap on again, and when the six onions are stuffed, lay them in a buttered baking dish, and bake in a slow oven for an hour. When done, pour a brown sauce (separately made) over them and serve in their own dish. 6. —A recipe for these toothsome little fondues will be found at page 249.

305 CURRIES—CONTINUED. served correctly than not, I will go on with a few recipes that will be found easy enough. Fresh chutneys should be served in saucers which should be tastefully arranged upon a tray. Four or five varieties can be presented together, so that there may be an oppor- tunity of selection. Caviare dressed with a few drops of lime juice and a dust of yellow pepper ; roes of fish pounded with a little butter j potted prawns ; potted ham; crab paste ; lobster paste ; and sardine paste, are hors dloeuvres that can accom- pany the chutneys and materially assist them. The best fresh chutneys are : tomato, cucumber, mint, brinjal, cocoanut, mango or apple, tamarind, and potato. For tomato chutney :—Remove the seeds and watery juice from two or three ripe tomatoes, chop them up with a quarter their bulk of white onion, and season the mince with a little saltadd a pinch of salt, two green chillies chopped small, and a little bit of celery also chopped, give the whole a dust of black pepper, and moisten it with a tea-spoonful of vinegar—anchovy vinegar for choice. For cucumber chMtney :—Cut the cucumber into thin strips an inch long y say three heaped up table-spoonfuls; mix with them a tea-spoonful of finely-minced onion, one of chopped green chilli, and one of parsley; moisten with a dessert-spoonful of vinegar in which a pinch of sugar has been dissolved, a dessert-spoonful of salad oil, and dust over it salt and black pepper at discretion. Brinjal chutney is made in this manner:—Boil two or three brinjals, let them get cold, scrape out the whole of the inside of the pods, pass this through the sieve to get rid of the seeds. Rub a soup-plate with a clove of garlic, empty the brinjal pulp therein, dress it with a tea-spoon- ful of minced onion, one of green chilli, one of vinegar.

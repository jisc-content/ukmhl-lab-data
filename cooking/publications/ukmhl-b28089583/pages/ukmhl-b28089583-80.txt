CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 66 can be modified by changing the sweet herbs, or with' drawing them. The taste of game can be imparted to cold, cooked mutton by placing the meat in a marinade composed of a wine-glass each of vinegar, portwine, and mushroom ketchup in which a table-spoonful of red currant jelly has been dissolved; with a tea-spoonful of “ spiced pepper,” some pepper corns, salt, a chopped onion, and a dessert- spoonful of marjoram and thyme blended.

It should cover the bottom of the dish on which you place the meat, your object being gained by occasional turning, and basting. When wanted, the cook should lift the meat from the dish, let it drain a minute or so, and then pro- ceed to business. Independently of the method in which you purpose to cook them, a great deal depends upon the careful trimming of a dish of mutton cutlets.

Now, lay them on your board, and give them a few strokes with your cutlet bat, trim them into shape, and then place them in the marinade. The hungry

VEGETA BLES— CON CL UDED. 153 Or, the mixtxu'e can be placed inside little pastry patties like oyster patties and served on a napkin (Boucliees d'arti- chauts). This latter method is equally practicable with Jerusalem artichoke puree, and if your cook can make light pastry, these little patties, will be found very nice indeed. Remember when writing your menu, with regard to these two vegetables, that the ‘ artichatif is the globe or leafy kind. The Jerusalem artichoke should be called ‘ topinambour.’ Turnips, (navels,) do not require much discussion; it should be remai-ked, however, that when nice and young, they are well worthy of attention, especially as garnishes for entrees, stews, &c. Think of appearance when serving them, and shape the roots into little cones or ovals, of an equal size. I once saw a dish of turnips served d la creme which was quite worthy of separate service as an entremets: the roots had been cut into pieces and shaped about the size of a bantam’s egg, boiled to a turn, and served with a coffee-cupful of boiling cream poured over them to finish with. Trimmed in the same way, young turnips can be sent up d la poiilette, or d la bechamel. The French dish of young turnips called navels glaces ought to be very popular. Trim the turnips into shapes like small pears, or cones, and boil them till nearly done in salt and water; drain them, and put them into a sauce- pan with plenty of melted butter, and sprinkle them bountifully with powdered sugar, stii' gently over the fire until they begin to brown, and then add a spoonful or two of clear stock : pepper and salt should now be given, let them simmer till quite tender and serve them in theii’ own sauce.

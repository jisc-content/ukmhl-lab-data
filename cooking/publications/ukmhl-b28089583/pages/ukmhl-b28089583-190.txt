176 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. smaller each way than the crepe, over the bacon put a table- spoonful of any nice mince, well worked with an egg or two, and a little cold sauce to give it moisture and cohesion : then roll up your crepes, put them on a buttered tin, brush them with a whipped egg, bread-crumb them, and bake brown in the oven. Cold vegetables, such as cauliflowers, cabbage, Jeru- salem artichokes, and vegetable marrows, may be mashed up with potatoes, or alone, diluted with melted butter, cream, or milk with the yolk of an egg strained into it, dusted over with grated cheese, and cooked au gratin. Mixed vegetables may be cut into dice and warmed up in white sauce a la macedoine de legumes, and cold peas, cauli- flower, French beans, and cabbage, may be tossed in butter in a frying-pan, and served d la maitre d'hotel. You will find a good many recipes for the treatment of cooked vege- tables in the chapters I have devoted to that especial subject. No more useful present could well be given to a young lady commencing house-keeping than a set of silver, or silver-plated coguilles (scallop shells). Served in these in- viting looking little dishes, a mince, or a rechauffe of vege- tables, is worthy of a place at any table. A puree of arti- choke, capped with finely-giâ€™ated cheese, any cold fish, minced game, even the remains of a maccaroni au grattn, sent up in this tasty manner, seem ever so much nicer than in an ordinary way. The shells should be well buttered before operations are commenced, and the mince or chopped vegetable should be well diluted with sauce to keep it nice and moist. The sou-face should be sprinkled over with cheese or finely rasped crumbs. When quite hot, brown the ci'umbs with a hot iron salamander-fashion, and serve the shells tastily on a napkin. Crisply fried curly parsley may garnish them.

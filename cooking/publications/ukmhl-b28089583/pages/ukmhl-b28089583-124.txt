110 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS, 111 mincing parsley, and all green herbs, be careful that, after washing them well, the leaves are well dried in a cloth; if chopped wet, the juice escapes, and the mince is never finely and evenly granulated. Forcemeats are, of course, added to, and pei*haps im- proved, by chopped ham, tongue, liver, mushrooms, bacon, a little anchovy, a casual oyster, and, of coiu’se, truffles. The addition of these things should, however, be thought- fully carried out, and the proportions on no account left at haphazard to the tender mercy of the average Ramasamy. The mixture which tradition has handed down to the Anglo-Indian kitchen for the stuffing of ducks and geese is nearly as disagreeable as that for the fowl. Whilst the latter may be described as a consolidated and greasy rela- tion of the “ bread poultice” that I denounced, when treat- inty of “ bread sauce,” the former owes its flavoui’ to violent onion, crude sage, and slices of half-boiled potato, mixed together lumpily and lubricated with some chopped fat. Let me speedily tell you that potato has no place whatever in the best duck stuffing, and that the crude taste you dislike so much arises from the sage being chopped raw, and the onion being a common one instead of the mild kind called “ Bombay,” or “ Bellary.” Duck stuffing should be made in this manner :—Take three Bombay onions the size of Badminton balls, wash, ]ieel, and boil them in two waters to extract the acrid flavour. Whilst these are boiling, take eight tender look- iuf sage leaves, and scald them in boiling water for five minutes, take them out, and when the onions are tender, turn them out, di-ain them dry, and proceed to mince them with the sage leaves, very fine. Add to this, five ounces of bread-crumbs, and dust over the mixture a liberal allow- ance of spiced pepper (which I give later on) and salt: when nicely worked together, add an ounce of butter or

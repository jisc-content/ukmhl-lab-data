493 ON COFFEE-MAKING. your mill will admit,—the grains should be quite as large as those of rifle guu-powder,—and make the coffee as soon afterwards as possible. A little butter or salad oil is strongly recommended, it prevents the escape of much of the fragrance of the berry while roasting, and becomes quite dried up before the roasting is finished. The custom in the Indian kitchen is to bake, often to over-bahe, the berries and then tunny- cutcli ammali pounds them to a dull black powder as fine as flour. The result is a leaden tinted liquid, acrid in flavour, and repulsive to look upon. Having ground the coffee properly,—it should be rich in aroma, and of a beautiful pale snuff colour—the best coffee-pot to use, after all, is the percolator. Be liberal with the coffee (a table-spoonful for each person), heat the coffee-pot thoroughly, fill the upper chamber of the perco- lator according to your requirements, ram the coffee down firmly, and having previously measured the amount of coffee liquid you require, pour boiling water, according to that measurement, in tea-spoonfuls at a time, through the upper strainer upon the powder. The slower the water is added, the more thoroughly the coffee will become soaked, and, the dripping being retarded, the essence will be as strong as possible. As soon as the coffee has run through, pour the rich essence you have obtained into your cups, and for cafe au lait fill them up with boiling milk, for cafe noir with a little boiling water. As it is scarcely possible for your servant to make coffee with all this care at the end of a dinner party, I recom- mend that the essence be made just before dinner, and kept covered up. For a party of twelve, two brews will be required. At the time it is wanted, the boiling milk imparts quite enough heat to the essence in the case of cafe au lait; and, for black coffee, a gentle re-heating, plus the modicum of boiling water aforesaid, insures a good cup ; 63

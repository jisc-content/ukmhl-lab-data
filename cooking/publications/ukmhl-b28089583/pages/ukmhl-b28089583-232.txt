218 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. take it out, let it get cold and mix it with your iced butter in the proportion of about half and half. The pounding must be thorough; there should be no granulated particles of prawn meat in the butter. Crab-coral butter, and lobster butter may be made ex- actly as the foregoing : in the case of the former, I would put in a couple of anchovies, as the coral is rather taste- less ; and in that of the latter, I would wash the lobster clean, getting rid of all oily, tinny juices. To do this, turn the contents of tin out upon a sieve, with a bowl un- der it to catch the liquor ; when the lobster meat drips no longer, pour over it a good jugful of clean cold water tuniing the pieces so that they may all come under the stream, then dry and pound it. Hai’d-boiled yolks of eggs may be passed through the sieve, and be made to form a part of any fancy butter. they tint plain butter yellow, and make a tasty pat if fla- voured with soft heri’ing roes, or cod’s I’oes, peppered, and sharpened with a few capers. Fish that is very salt must, of course, be soaked in water before it can be used; anchovies in oil do not need that ti’eatment. Gorgona anchovies, on the other hand, must be freed from brine by steeping.

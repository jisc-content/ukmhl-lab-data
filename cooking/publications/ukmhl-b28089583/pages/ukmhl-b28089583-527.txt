OUR KITCHENS IN INDIA. 513 could, for instance, find a place in tlie indoor “ working- room” I have recommended, and pro^dde a handy little kitchen for all delicate operations, especially for fancy baking. Finally: with a range (if possible), and with an ar- rangement, such as I have tried to describe, giving us a clean, nicely equipped room for the preparation of our food, and a kitchen, entirely separated from godowns and stabling, easily accessible from the house, and conse- quently continually subject to scrutiny and wholesome discipline, I think that the back-bone of the evils I have spoken of would be broken, ladies would find the super- vision of their domestic economy a pleasure rather than a penance, and we should be able to congratulate our- selves upon having really laid the foundation-stone of true refoi’m at last.

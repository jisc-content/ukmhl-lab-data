Climate has a great deal to say to this, and without wishing to depreciate the ta- lent of the Coonoor or Ooty pdtissiers, we must remember the advantages that they enjoy in the matter of tempera- ture. The next golden rule is that which enjoins scrupulous cleanliness. Everything connected with this department must he as bright and clean as possible.

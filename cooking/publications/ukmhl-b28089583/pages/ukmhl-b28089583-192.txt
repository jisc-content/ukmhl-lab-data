CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 178 of oux’ back verandah in cantonment. Eggs, though neither as cheap, nor as plentiful as in days of yore, are still to be got: we can obtain charcoal, and a broken chatty to hold it: we can get an iron omeZeiie-pan, made to order, in the bazar: we need never be without a tin of “ Noi-mandy,” “ Denmark,” or “ cow brand” butter; or, failing that, a bottle of the best salad oil. Salt, pepper, and a bottle of dined parsley ought not to be beyond our reach, and an onion is not an expensive luxury. Thus provided, we ought to be in a po.sition to turn out a capital dish, very rapidly, at any time, and anywhere. Omelettes, as you all know, can be diversified ad libitum : we need never, therefore, be afraid of falling back upon them. Before I proceed to the discussion of oneZe^fe-making, however, let me point out that Ramasamy has been , led astray altogether with regard to this branch of his art. He sends you up a very nice pudding, symmetri- | cal in design, of a goodly consistency, and of a rich brown | colour. You almost requii’e a dessert-knife to help it. It | is, of course, lighter somewhat, than a ‘ roly-poly’ pudding I made of paste, but it greatly resembles that homely com- I position. It is a first cousin of the pancake, and Rama- | samy evidently uses the stuff of which it is made to coat I his plantains when bidden to make fritters. He stai'ts I wrongly to commence with, Avhen mixing his omelette, In addition to the eggs (the whites of which he Avhips I separately) he puts in a little floni’, some milk or a little 1 water, and, in point of fact, makes a lightish sort of ■ batter. This, I regret to say, he vigorously whips, and ■ fries in a fau amount of ghee, folding it into shape, and ■ keeping it on the fire till it is nice and firm, and coloured as I before described. That this is no more an omelette than our old friend “ the man in the moon” I need hardly a assm’e you. Native cooks are nevertheless very easily 9 ii

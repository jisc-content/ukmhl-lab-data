ON COFFEE-MAKING. 494 only, do not forget to pass round with it a flask of cognac vieil. I have confined my remarks to the method which I have followed for years successfully, but there are, of course, other ways of making good coffee. The Turkish system much praised by travellers may be thus described:—The roasting having been conducted with all the care I have already indicated, the berries are cast into a large metal mortar, and pounded to a very fine powder. This is carefully sifted through a fine sieve, all coarse particles being rejected. As much water as is wanted is then boiled in a small copper can, having a narrow top and broad bottom. When the water boils, powdered coffee is added, off the fire, according to require- ments, and the can is replaced on the fire. The liquid is now permitted to come to the boil three times, the can after each occasion of ebullition being taken off the fire for a while. After the third boiling up, the can is placed for a minute in a shallow vessel containing cold water to precipitate the “ grounds,” after which the coffee clear, black, and sparkling is poured into the cup.

REGARDING OUR FISH. 55 mb it over •with a little vinegar, and place it on the drainer of the fish-kettle, so that when done it may be lifted out without risk of breaking up. Put plenty of salt, and a dessert-spoonful of vinegar, into the water in which the fish is to be boiled. Let the water be cold, and in suflBcient quantity to cover the fish. Place the kettle on a brisk fire, and boil the fish as fast as possible. Skim off all scum that rises, and take care to suspend operations, the moment the fish is done. Overboiled fish is nasty to eat, and ugly to look upon: ■underdone fish is unfit for human food. The cookery books allow ten minutes per pound as a fair average of the time required for this operation; but so much depends upon the thickness of the fish to be boiled, that the cook should test it now and then with the point of a skewer, and as soon as the flesh parts easily from the bone, let him decide that it is ready. Never let your fish, after it is done, remain soaking in the water in which it has been cooked; drain it at once, or it will become what cooks call “ woolly.” If ready too soon, let it rest on the drainer over the hot kettle, and cover it with a napkin. If you have no fish-kettle, put your fish on a dish, tie a napkin round it, and boil it: when done, you can then lift the dish out of the pan without spoiling the appearance of the fish. Be very particular to drain every drop of water from the fish before you serve it, or the sauce you send up with it will be ruined. Connoisseurs in the art of cookery recommend that fish should be boiled in a “ Court houillon,'’ in which case the process is thus described by the G. C. : “ Having placed the fish in the fish-kettle with enough cold-water to cover it, add a glass of vinegar, some slices of carrots and onions, and a clove of garlic; then sweet herbs, and spices tied up m a muslin bag, with pepper, salt, and parsley or celery.

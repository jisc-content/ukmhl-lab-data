CULINARY yOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 90 chokes; one table-spoonfnl is enough for one artichoke, and the plates should be really hot.* Hollandaise made with eggs is knowm abroad as Hollan- daise jaune. “ Horse-radish sauce” is the grand standard adjnnct to our national food, “ the roast beef of old England,” and beef in India cries out for help far more piteously than its rich relation far away. Horse-radish grows well at Ootaca- mund, and I once grew some with success at Bangalore, but the scraped root of the moringa, or “ drum-stick” tree, provides so good a substitute that we may rest contented with a sauce thus composed :—Scrape as finely as you can a cupful of the root shavings, simmer them in half a pint of chicken broth ; when done, thicken the broth custard- wise with the yolks of three eggs beaten up with a dessert- spoonful of tarragon vinegar; add pepper, salt, and a very little grated nutmeg, and serve in a sauce-boat. A richer recipe suggests the addition of a cofEee-cupful of cream with the yolks of the eggs, and then to let the sauce remain on the fire en bain-marie, stirring well until it is very hot (but not boiling) and serving it in a hot sauce-boat. The cold form of this sauce is perhaps the easiest, and I think as nice as any t:—^you simply rasp the moringa, or horse-radish root, till you have a cupful of fine scrapings, and mingle them with an ordinary mayonnaise, or tartare sauce, iced. Cream is, of course, a great addition, but the usual mixture of eggs, oU, mustard, and vinegar, will give you a good result. And this leads me to discuss at once the two sauces I have just mentioned. * A tea-apoonfnl of anchovy viuegar is in this case better than lime- juice.—W. + Most delicious with cold roast beef.—W.

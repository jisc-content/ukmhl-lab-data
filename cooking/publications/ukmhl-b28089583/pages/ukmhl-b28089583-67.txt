REGARDING OUR FISH. 53 pose apparently the whole repertoire of sauces within the reach of the local chef. N-B.—I have never been able by the way to trace the origin of the Madi-as custom of serving a portion of salad with a thick eggy dressing on the same plate as the slice of hot fish. To put salad on a hot plate is to begin with an unpardonable offence, while the association of salad with hot fish is incongruous in the extreme. The same remai'k applies to the service of cold cucumber and beet-< root with hot fish. Delicately stewed cucumber, hot, little orlys of oysters, ovpetits bouchees of prawn or lobster, may accompany the fish, if you like; otherwise it should be presented with its sauce alone. The proper time for serV" ing the salad is with “ the roast,” when it should be sent round on separate plates, and as cold as possible. Now, without wishing for one moment to question the sterling merits of plain-boiled fish, I confess that for a din- ner party I strongly advocate dishes of a more artistic : nature. There are so many easy recipes for cooking fish i nicely, that an effort to produce a little novelty in this feature of the menu can scarcely result in failure. In Eng- land where you have many varieties of fishes, and some of the best of them only to be seen in the market during their I especial seasons, a little sameness in the style of cooking I may not perhaps strike you. You may boil and fry plainly • every day in the week, if each day you are able to present : a different fish. Not so with us in Madras. Our supply IS good enough, but it lacks diversity; and it is on this account particularly that I am anxious to direct the atten- lon 0 my readers to a few easy ways of relieving the monotony which I have pointed out. It may be urged that your fish is brought home from I market too late in the evening for the successful aocom- I plishment of studied effects, and perhaps your butler will take pains to thrust that fact before you.

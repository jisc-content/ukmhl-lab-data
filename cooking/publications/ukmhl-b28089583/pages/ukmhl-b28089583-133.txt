119 BOILING AND STEAMING. important occasions a bottle of Madeira or Marsala crowns your best eiforts with supreme success. Some of the best modern writers on cookery urge us to give up the salting of beef for boiling. “ Such a prac- tice,” says one of them, “ cannot be too strongly condemn- ed ; for whilst it impairs the wholesomeness of the meat, and makes it less digestible, it considerably diminishes the nutritive properties of it, and, boil it as you will, a piece of salt-beef is never so tender as a piece of fresh beef.” We, Anglo-Indians, can scarcely bring ourselves to accept this advice in its entirety; our hiimp being in itself specialite worthy of admiration in any land.

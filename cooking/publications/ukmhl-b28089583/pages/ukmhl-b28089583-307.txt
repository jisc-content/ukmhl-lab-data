OUR CURRIES. 293 discretion, are these cloves ('^aoo?^g'j, mace (jawatri), cinnamon (Jculmi darchini), nutmeg (jaephal), cardamoms (eelachi), and allspice (seetul cJiini gach). A salt-spoonful of one, or at most of two, of these aromatic powders blended, will suffice for a large curry. Dr. Kitchener’s precept, that the mixing of several spices is a hlundei, should never be forgotten. The green leaves that are often useful when judiciously introduced are :—fennel (souf), “ maytlii bajee, lemon- grass (tiggeci-ghcis), hiiy-leSiYes (tajipcttha,), “ IcaTay-pciuh, “ kotemear” leaves (green coriander), &c.

The indispensably necessary suspicion of sweet-acid can be produced most readily by a dessert-spoonful of powdered or moist sugar aud the juice of a lime, or a spoonful of vinegar. A table-spoonful of sweet chutney and the juice of a lime make a good substitute ; hut a table-spoonful of red currant jelly, with one of chutney, and a little vinegar of lime juice, form to my mind the nicest combination for dark curries. I strongly advocate the very capital plan of making a fresh paste of some of the above adjuncts, in sufficient quantity for the curry in hand, and blending it with the stock powder when cooking the latter. Here is a reliable x’ecipe :—One small onion, one clove of garlic, one dessert- spoonful of turmeric, one of freshly-roasted coriander-seed, one of poppy-seed, a tea-spoonful of Nepaul pepper, one of sugar, one of salt, and one of grated green ginger. Pound all these with sufficient good salad oil to make a paste. Also pound twelve almonds, and one ounce of cocoanut, with a littlo lime juice to assist the operation. Then mix the two pastes, and stir into them a salt-spoon- 28

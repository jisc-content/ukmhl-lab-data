139 OUR VEGETABLES. French beans, cold, make a capital salad : I mnst, how- ever, reserve that form of serving them for discussion elsewhere. English people are apt to ignore the heans of haricots verts, kidney beans, scarlet runners, and dwarf beans, which when shelled green, and served in various ways are known abroad as flageolets. As a rule we try to eat the pods long after they have outgrown their edible stage, and have become stringy and tough. Now, the young hean when about three parts grown is delicious, and, omitting the mint, may be cooked as laid down for peas and served as recommended for haricots verts. Flageolets a la creme, a la poulette, or d la maitre d'hotel, make quite a first class entremets. Haricots verts panaches, a capital dish, is composed of young green pods and shelled beans mixed together. You can thus dispose of the old pods, and use the tender ones to the best advantage. This recipe will be found useful by those who grow their own beans. N. B.—The water in which peas or beans are boiled, “ eau de la cuisson,” is, remember, a weak stock. Use it when making your sauce blanche in preference to milk or plain water. The pepper used with these vegetables should be black, and freshly ground. For this you should possess one of the newly introduced pepper-mills.

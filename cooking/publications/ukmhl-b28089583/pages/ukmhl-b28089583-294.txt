CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 280 collops are arranged upon it, and the pigeon’s livers with bacon rolled round them should be arranged on the surface. I have also found that mutton collops may be used with almost as good an effect as those of beef. I used the meat of the blade-bone of a shoulder, which was cut into neat pieces ; these were rolled with a slice of bacon inside them as directed for beef. 6. “ Snipe Fie.'”—When snipes are plentiful, as they often are in India, the cook ought to remember this delicacy.

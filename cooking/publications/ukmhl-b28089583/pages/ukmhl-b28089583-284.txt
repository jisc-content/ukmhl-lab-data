CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 270 half a pound of fat bacon cut into dice has been tossed with a finely chopped shallot. Work the mince about for ten minutes, then empty the contents of the frying-pan into a mortar, and pound the mixture to a paste. Now cut eight fine truffles into dice the size of a pea, melt an ounce of butter in the frying-pan, and throw in the truffles; toss for a couple of minutes, and add a claret- glassful of Madeira; let the dice boil in this, and then pour them with the liquor into a bowl. You can now pack the pie as follows :— Spread a layer of liver paste over the inside of each bird, put a spoonful of truffles upon it, and roll the bird up; cut the hare into slices, and treat them in the same way : next put a layer of the liver paste over the bottom of the pie, dot it over with truffles, arrange the rolls of hare meat over that, spread some liver paste over them, a few truffles, and some thin slices of fat bacon: next arrange a layer of snipe, and continue until the pie is tightly filled; cover the topmost layer with fat bacon, sprinkled over with marjoram leaves, cover the pie closely and bake. When done, pour into it a little very strong jelly (lique- fied) made of the bones and trimmings of the game, two sheep’s feet, and the truffle liquor. It must be here observed that raised pies should not be made during the hot weather ; unless eaten immediately they soon turn sour ; but they will be found capital on the Hills, at Bangalore, and on the plains during the cold season. Savoury Puddings, though homely, and perhaps hardly to be recommended for dinner parties, are, in their way, not to be despised. The best paste for them, I think, is one made as follows :—Chop very finely six ounces of clai'i- fied suet, and dredge a little flour over it as you mince it. Mix with it one pound of flour, a tea-spoonful of .salt, and

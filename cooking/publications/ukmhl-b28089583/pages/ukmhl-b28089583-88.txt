CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 74 that our so-called “kitchen butter” might be equally vaguely described. What, then, can people of moderate incomes do ? For, I take it that even wealthy folk at home wotdd hesitate to pay six shillings a pound for the butter used by their cooks ! The most economical remedy for this evil is to use preserved butter. The “ Copenhagen” (cow brand), “ Normandy,” and “ Denmark,” at one rupee fourteen annas a pound-tin, are especially free from brine, or taint of any kind, and can be thoroughly recommended.

Apart from its being palpably inartistic, there are other reasons which prompt the abolition of sending round vege-

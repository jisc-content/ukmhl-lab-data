MENU FOR A DINNER OF SIX. 424 7-—Cut up a stale Madeira cake into slices, and Avitli Tipsy pudding. bottom^ of a krge glass dish, tipsify them with wine, or any nice liqueur and spread a layer of any good jam over them, or one of preserved fruit like cherries, peaches, or apricots. Make a rich custard, and add to it an ounce of dissolved gelatine. When cold, set the dish on ice and pour a very little of the custard round the cake and fruit, letting it set by degrees. When at length the cake, &c., is firmly con- gealed in custard, complete its covering with the rest thereof, and let it consolidate. Garnish the surface with whipped cream, and serve straight from the ice. Beef Olives Cut thin slices of steak two inches wide by six inches long, put on each at one end a piece of Oxford, or Bologna sausage meat the size of a pigeon’s egg ; roll up each olive tightly and neatly, and tie it up with a piece of thread. Fry them in hot butter until they begin to take colour, then take them out, remove the string from each olive, and lay them by. Fry some onions a gold colour in but- ter, add a very little flour, sweet herbs, a few mushroom trimmings, pepper and salt quant, suff., and moisten with some very good gravy or stock ; let the sauce boil, then strain it, and carefully lay the olives in it to simmer till done and ready to be served ; the sauce should cover them in the sauce-pan. It will be observed that olives are not used in this dish at all. It is difficult to discover how the word was chosen to represent little rolls of meat containing sausage salpicon.

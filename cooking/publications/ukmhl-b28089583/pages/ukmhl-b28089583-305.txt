OUR CURRIES. 291 not undertake to make the dish without at least a break- fast-cupful and a half of good stock. Let us now consider attentively the actual details of cm-ry-making, and since we cannot proceed to work with- out a good powder or paste, we can hardly do better than commence operations by studying the recipe for a house- hold cuny-stuff, concerning which I have already spoken. If faithfully followed, it will, I am sure, be found most trustworthy. It runs as follows 4 lbs. of turmeric 8 lbs. of coriander-seed 2 lbs. of cummin-seed 1 lb. of poppy-seed... 2 lbs. of fenugreek ... 1 lb. of dry-ginger ... \ lb. of mustard-seed 1 lb. of dried chillies 1 lb. of black pepper corns Hind, huldi. „ dhunnia. „ jeera. ,, Jchush-lchush. ,, viaythi. ,, sont. „ rai. ,, sooka mirrch. „ kala mirrch. Do not be alarmed at the quantity, remembering my previous statement that curry-powder improves by keep- ing, if carefully secured. The amount when finj^lly mixed will fill about half a dozen bottles of the size in which tart fruits are imported.

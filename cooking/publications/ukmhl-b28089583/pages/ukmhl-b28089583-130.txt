116 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. can so easily do. He must be ever watchful about his fire, and guard against there being too much, or too little firewood under his vessels. In fact, I doubt whether it is possible for Ramasamy to conduct the simmering pro- cess satisfactorily with only the common appliances of the cookroom at his command. Those who possess ranges, or cooking stoves, should count themselves especially for- tunate. Their cooks can regulate the heat they want at will. But, with a common cookroom fireplace, the difficulty of maintaining the unvarying gentle heat so highly essential, appears to me to be very great.

Herein you have the true essence of economyâ€”no waste. The soup gains all the fowl loses in the boiling, whilst the fowl derives richness and flavour by being done in the stock. One lot of vegetables and herbs suffices for both, and absolutely nothing is thrown away but the muslin bag

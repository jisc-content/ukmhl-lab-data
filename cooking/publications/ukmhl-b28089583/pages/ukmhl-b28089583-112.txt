CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 98 stir in half a pint of Espagnole to complete the sauce, and when thoroughly hot, it is ready. Take now Financiere sauce for, let us say, a ragout of that name:—Choose a nice tender fowl, lightly roast it, and save the choicest fillet meat for your ragout: take the legs, thighs, skin, bones, liver, giblets, scraps, and trim- mings, and proceed to make an essence of them thus :—Break up the bones, and, with the remnants aforesaid, make the strongest broth you can, fiavoured with an onion, a bit of celery, a spoonful of dried herbs, a sliced carrot, and two or three pepper corns. Reduce it as strong as possible, and tlien strain. Now, take equal portions of mushrooms and of truffles; cut them up, and toss them in melted butter at the bottom of a sauce-pan, and when you have worked them well thus, for two or three minutes, add your fowl- essence, with a glass of sherry, and complete the sauce with your pint of Espagnole. The ragout (which should be garnished with whole button mushrooms, sliced truffles, cocks-combs, sweet-bi-eads, tongue, grated ham, and sip- ].)ets of crisply fried bacon) is merely a careful stew of fowl fillets, in the sauce I have described. As the fillets have been j)reviously cooked, they will mei-ely require gently heating up in the sauce. Tt will be observed that the specialites of the two sauces just given are a flavour of ti’uffles and Madeira in Perigueuz, and of chicken essence with mushrooms, truffles, and sherry in Financiere. Bechamel, which I select as the best type of a fiinda- inental white sauce, should be made in this way :—Take the same ingvedients that I have detailed for Espagnole, and commence by slicing up the onion, and shaking the i*ings in an ounce of melted butter at the bottom of the stew-pan; do not let them take colour, but add your meat* * Veal, if procurable, instead of beef.—W.

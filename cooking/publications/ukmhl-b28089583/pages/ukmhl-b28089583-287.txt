273 A FEW NICE PIES. laid in the pie-dish uncooked, and properly covered with paste according to the correct laws of cookery. Previously cooked meat may very often be made use of in a pie, I grant, but a good'* pasty’ can hardly be produced if the whole of its contents have been dressed beforehand. Having selected the meat for your pie, the first thing to remember is the gravy which must be made separately, and part of it poured in and amongst the layers in the pie- dish before the paste is laid over it. A little wine lends valuable aid to such gravies : the remains of a good bottle of champagne can be used with great advantage in pigeon- pies, chicken and ham pies, &c., and Madeira is wanted for game, venison, and hare pies. The gravy ought not to_^ZZthe pie-dish; about a breakfast-cupful will suffice for a pie of moderate size in the first instance. Prohibit most strenuously the use of Worcester, Tapp, or any strongly flavoured sauce of that kind; it is owing to Ramasamy’s predilection for the sauce bottle that one peculiar kind of taste prevails throughout his dishes, in his savoury pies especially. The seasoning is a matter demanding close attention: here the “spiced pepper” described at page 111 will be found of great assistance ; and minced mushrooms, minced truffles, and minced olives, (made from remnants you may have saved after an important day’s cooking) will come in most efficaciously. Finely chopped liver is a capital thing to shake over the crevices when building a pie, and little bits of chopped anchovy may be similarly used. Ham and tongue, either sliced, or grated, is welcome in every kind of ‘ pasty,’ bacon is almost as effective, and sliced Bologna sausage a very good substitute. Always rub your pie-dish with a shallot, before pack- ing it. It is customary to garnish the surface of a savoury pie

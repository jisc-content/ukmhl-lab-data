OUR KITCHENS IN INDIA. 503 ings close to the back verandahs, which, I presume, were originally intended to be used as a “ coolers’ godowns,” or, perhaps, for the hanging of meat. They cannot be of much use for either of those purposes now-a-days, for the ancient cooler’s “ occupation’s gone,” and the modern zinc- lined safe has made us independent of a larder. It seems to me, then, that some of these little places might be easily converted into kitchens, large enough at all events to accommodate one of the small yet very excellent Anglo- American cooking ranges now procurable, together with its accessories, and such things as are necessai’y for mere cooking. A place for washing up might easily be con- trived on one side, or at the back of this room, and a light covered way might be thrown up cheaply enough to con- nect it with the house.

This I may call one of the chief points of the system I advocate, for, I maintain, that for numerous undeniable reasons, the making of pastry, the dressing of meat and vegetables, and the mixing of sauces, puddings, &c., should be per- formed in a cool place, away from the smoke and heat of fires, where wind and dust can be excluded by closing the door, and yet ample light be obtained from a good glass window, and, above all things, where the chef can be easily supervised.

Of a sudden a blast of wind drives a cloud of dust into the cook-room through the door (which is of

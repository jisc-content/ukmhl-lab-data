CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 70 Madras Hotel. I know that some cookery books describe as cotelettes, certain artistic mixtures of meats, with bits of bone introduced to make them look like true cutlets, but I would prefer omitting the bones, and calling such dishes by their proper names, for they undoubtedly belong really to the tribe of croquettes, boudins, ^c. Chicken, ox and sheep’s tongues, tender mutton, ham, bacon, oysters, pigeons, turkey, rabbit, the livers of all poultry, of rabbits, and game,—whether previously cooked or not,—provide materials out of which these entrees can be made. It is in the judicious blending of two or more of them together, in the thorough pounding and incorpo- ration thereof, in the selection of the condiments he em- ploys to improve them, and so on, that the skill of the good cook can be detected. If you preserve your own ox tongues in this country, and keep one generally ready for use, you will have a very valuable thing to fall back upon for “ made” entrees. Cured sheep’s tongues, too, are very useful, and a little lamb's liver is sometimes a good thing to have at hand in case of need. Calves’ liver cut into dice, and fried with some shallot in the pan in which some fat bacon has been melted, then set to get cold, and pounded in the mortar with some cold veal,* forms the well-known minced meat which surrounds & pate de foie grras and all French fates. The frying-pan should be rubbed with garlic before operations are com- menced, and the minced onion must go in with the liver. If you add to the mixture when pounded the minced trim- mings of any truffles you may have been using, the flavour will be exactly that of the pate. A little jar of this com- position, made at home, will be found well worth the * Use the white breast-meat of a cold roast chicken if yon cann(^ get veal in this country. The melted bacon must be pounded with the liver.—W.

72 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. liberal hand. As your Gouffe bids you, so must you proceed without a murmur. We do our utmost to give oui’ guests, here in sultry Madi’as, a vol-au-vent, when we should know quite well that it is almost impossible to produce, in a temperature that rarely falls below 80 °, the exquisitely light puff pastry from which the dish derives its name. The best attempts present the appearance of layers of talc laid one over the other in an oval-shape and baked a pale brown. Now, I maintain that it would be better to give up our fruitless efforts, and employ one of the ornamental earthenware dishes made specially for this purpose, and to be had of all good dealers in glass and crockery in London. Small ones for dishes era caisses are also sold. We could then send up our ragout a la financiere, or a la reine, without misgivings, in a pretty dish becomingly garnished, and bury the unhappy memories of the light puff paste we never could achieve. But whilst thus proposing to abandon as fruitless our attempts to place before our guests a true vol-au-vent,— conquered by the climate in which we live, and not through carelessness or want of culinary skill,—I, by no means, wish to say that we should cease to bestow our attention upon entrees which can be made of pastry of a less volatile nature. There are some Madras cooks, I know, who can turn out very good light fate pastry. To such men you can entrust, of course, petits pates, timbales, saVpicon bouchees, and those artistic croustades for which pastry is employed instead of ? the easier substitute of hollowed-out rolls. The knack of making nice light pastry is, however, far from common. Neither reading, nor even practical demonstration, will ; teach it. So unless you are certain that your cook possesses the gift, never permit him to waste good mate-^ I'ials in idle experiments. An entree of pastry, if not. unmistakably good, is a blot upon the face of your menu.

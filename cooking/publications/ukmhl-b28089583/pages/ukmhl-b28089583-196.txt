182 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. -whole operation, if the pan be properly hot -when the mix- ture is poured into it. 10. Have the hot dish close by the fire, so that you can turn the omelette into it instanter. A little melted butter, ■with some chopped parsley, may, with advantage, be put into the dish. It is above all things necessary to have a very brisk fire under the pan while the omelette is being cooked. A brasier filled with live charcoal is the best kind of fire, and the fan must be vigorously plied from the moment that the mixture is poured into the pan. As I said before, omelettes may be varied in many ways. If “ aux fines Jierbes,” curly parsley and shallot are neces- sary; minced marjoram or thyme, garden-cress (the com- panion, I mean, of mustard) or celery leaves, are agreeable, and many are fond of a spoonful of finely chopped green chilli, omitting the seeds of course. Chopped ham, chopped tongue, chopped bacon, and chopped corned beef are added to omelettes with good effect. The words “ mi jamhon," “ au lard,” “ au langue de hoeufi” specify the addition. I have found it better to fry the minced ham, &c., independently, keeping it handy for addition to the omelette during the rolling over stage, as it goes into the dish. Cold cooked vegetables, cut up and tossed awhile in melted butter separately, may be thus added with success. I recommend pieces of the fiower of the cauliflower, arti- choke bottoms cut into dice, or Jerusalem artichokes sliced, and cut up. Peas, the grains of Indian corn, chopped French beans, or the seeds of the bandecai or moringa pod are thus very pleasantly treated. In the case of an “ omelette aux legumes,” a dust of grated cheese gives a pleasing finishing touch when the omelette reposes in the hot dish. “ Omelette aux tomatesCut three or four ripe tomatoes

VEGETABLES—CONCLUDED. 165 These excellent French tinned vegetables make, when cleverly amalgamated, a most delicious salad. For this they should be iced. I have the highest respect for all coimiry vegetables, and have given recipes for cooking beinjals, (hinegun), BANDEKAi, (bhindi), geeens, (bhagee), podolongkai, (chu- clwonda), moringakai, (mooringa), &c., which will be found amongst my menus. Indian’ corn, or maize, Tam., mueJcaclwlum; Hind., boota •, is capable of artistic treatment d VAmericaine,— stripped from the young pod, boiled like peas, and then di’ained, tossed in melted butter, peppered, salted and served. Plenty of butter is a sme qua non. Or the corn may be stripped off after boiling, and similarly treated. It is useless to attempt to serve Indian corn unless the cobs be quite young. All country beans, from the “ dufpin” bean downwards, may be cooked, when nice and young, as broad-beans (feves de marais) :—boiled, with plenty of salt in the water, till the skins crack, then peeled and tossed in butter, and served: or they may be sent up as a pu7-ee somewhat stiffly worked. The water in which beans are cooked should be boiling when they are first put in. Here is a good standard dish of beans (feves d la bour- geoise) :— Having boiled and skinned the beans, turn them into a stew-pan over a slow fire with a table-spoonful of tinned butter; mix with them a table-spoonful of flour, and mois- ten with some of the water in which the beans were boiled ; season with pepper and salt, and when nice and creamy, serve.

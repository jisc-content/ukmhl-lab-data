Now, place your boned-birds, breast downwards, on a board, and dust them over with spiced pepper. Pro- ceed to make a forcemeat thus :—Melt a couple of thick slices of fat bacon in a frying-pan ; when melted, throw in three table-spoonfuls of the lamb’s liver, with those of the birds too, cut into dice, and one onion shredded finely ; cook the liver in this, and when done, empty the contents of your pan, melted bacon and all, into a mortar, throw in the remains of the sheep’s tongues which were left after making the fillets, a pinch of salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg, work this to a paste, pass it through the sieve, add some finely minced parsley, a dessert-spoonful of spiced pepper, a little grated lime peel, and a table-spoonful of chopped truffles (saved from entree No. 1) ; work this again thoroughly, and spread a layer of it over the flatten- ed quails : place one of the tongue fillets in the centre of each quail, and spread another layer of your forcemeat over each. Now, gather the birds into shape neatly, sewing the skin together securely, and stew the little galantines in the previously made gravy, with a little red currant jelly, a glass of sherry, and half a wine-glass of vinegar: when done, lift them out, drain ofE the gravy, and reduce it to a . glS'Ze (page 219) : paint your galantines over with the glaze when cold, arrange them upon a dish which should be set upon ice, and garnish your dish with parsley, and slices of lime. Sauce tartare, also iced, should accompany. dish (see page 146) I recommend you to try little shortbread bisctuts in which some finely grated mild cheese has been mixed; the cakes should be heart-shaped, or round, and quite crisply baked like chcc.sc-fingcrs. Spinach with cream.

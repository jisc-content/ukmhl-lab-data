312 CULINARY yOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. For ordinary mulUgatunny maigre, however, plain eau de cuisson may b& employed. This most nsefnl liquid is too often thrown away by ignorant native cooks, or an- nexed by the waiy ones for their own food. It is the water in which certain vegnetables have been boiled. As a matter of economy, house-keepers should make a note of this.

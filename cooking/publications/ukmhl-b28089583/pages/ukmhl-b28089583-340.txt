CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 326 made yoiu' mince and flavoured it with a little chopped olive, anchovy, sausage meat, &c., bind it with a little good sauce thickened with a couple of eggs, and let it get cold: make a good sized thin pan-cake, take it from the pan when almost done, put it on a dish, and arrange some slices of cold cooked bacon upon it, lay the mince upon the bacon, give it a dust of spiced pepper, and fold the pan-cake over it: brush it over with an egg, bread-crumb it, and bake it a golden brown in your oven. The pan- cake should be just large enough to envelope the mince in one fold securely. If you look upon a tin of preserved meat as a dish that has been cooked once, and has accordingly to be dressed en rechauffe, you will not fail to turn it to good account. But warmed up as it comes from the tin, unaided, and carelessly dished, it presents an ii’regular mass of sodden and tasteless diet which few would care to touch unless driven to do so by the calls of ungovern- able hunger. Messes like Messrs. Crosse and Blackwell’s “ ducks and green peas,” “ Irish stew,” “ ox cheek and vegetables,” &c., should be avoided carefully, but if you find that your butler has sent such things to camp, you must pick the meat out of its sm’roundings, dress it with some fresh chicken meat, as a rissole, croustade or a mince, and cook the gravy and vegetables with some fresh chicken broth as a sauce. I have already spoken of tinned vegetables, (pages 163 to 166) and also of the produce of the country. The traveller ought to try and find out what country garden stuff can be got from the villages near his camp. The recipes I have given will be found easy, and the monotony of tinned food will bo much relieved by an occasional nicely dressed dish of common vegetables.

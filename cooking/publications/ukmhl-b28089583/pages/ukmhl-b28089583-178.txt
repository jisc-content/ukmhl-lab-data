CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 164 OTir best exporters of preserved provisions to compete, in this particnlar branch of their business, with the great French and American firms. Compare the tinned green peas, or asparagus, exported by Crosse and Blackwell with the 'petits pois verts, or asperges we get from France. Of these I have already spoken; we may accordingly proceed to consider:— Tinned French beans, (haricots verts). These excellent vegetables should be turned out upon a sawie-pan tossed in butter until hot, and served. Or they may be treated in any of the methods already set forth for fresh haricots verts. They make excellent ptirees, and may be cooked with other vegetables in a macedoine de legumes. I strongly recom- mend them to be served d la creme, or d la poulette, with a saddle of mutton. Flageolets, another delicious tinned legume, should be served d la poulette, or d la creme, or plainly d la maitre d’hotel. They are very effective when associated with other vegetables “ d la macedoine." Fonds d’artichauts, if delicately handled, may be cooked up in any of the ways recommended for the fresh arti- choke. Points d’asperges are, as a rule, too soft to stand much manipulation. The safest plan is to heat them en bain- marie in their tin, and then to turn them into the soup or sauce in which they are to be served. They make an ex- cellent addition to a chaud-froid if placed carefully in the centre of the border of aspic. Pure iced cream is, in such circumstances, their best sauce. Macedoine de legumes as a central garnish for cutlets can hardly be surpassed. The macedoine must be gently heated up in a really good poulette, or bechamel sauce, and a spoonful of cream should be added if possible.

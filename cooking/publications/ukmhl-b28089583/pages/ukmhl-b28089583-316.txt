302 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. place it in a bath of boiling water, to keep warm, while you add the prawns and the slices of partly-cooked cucum- ber. It will be found an excellent plan to permit the curry—now all but ready—to rest for about half an hour, at the expiration of which the pan may be placed over a moderate fire, and its contents brought to simmering point. When satisfied that both the prawns and vegetable are tender, the “ number one” infusion may be stirred in, and with it a tea-spoonful of lime-juice. Five minutes’ sim- mering will now complete our task, and the curry can be dished up, and served. It should be noted carefully that the water found inside a cocoanut is not “ cocoanut milk” according to the culi- nary vocabulary. The infusion is what should be used in curry-making. Fillets of any fii’m-fleshed fish, or even neat fillets of chicken, may be treated precisely in the manner I have described. As, however, it is necessary partly to cook prawns, crabs, lobsters, shrimps, &c., separately, a longer process of simmering will be necessary for raw fillets. The pieces of chicken should be lightly tossed in butter in a sowie-pan with a finely-shred onion, before being put into the curry sauce. The MOLT is prepared in this manner :—Melt a couple of ounces of butter, and fry therein an onion sliced into rings, and a clove of garlic minced, a few strips of green chilli, and some slices of green ginger ; stir into it a table-spoon- ful of flour, and add by degrees the “ number two infusion” just alluded to. Work this to the consistency of a rich white sauce adding a little broth if necessary, heat up some slices of cooked fish or chicken in it, and finish off, as already described, with “ number one infusion,” and a tea-spoonful of lime-juice. A little turmeric powder may be used if the yellow colour be considered desirable. If raw fish be used, the simmering process will be necessary.

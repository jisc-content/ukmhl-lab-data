EGGS, MACCARONI, AND CHEESE. 235 a little clear gravy, herbs and onion as used for omelette making, the tomato, cold vegetables, and carefnlly sifted bread-crumbs. The remains of fish, game, and poultry; grated ham, corned beef, and tongue, and slices of saus- ages, may be also occasionally made use of by an ingenious cook. Let ns first consider a few ways of serving eggs :— “ (E%ifs sur le plat” :—This simple, yet capital method of doing eggs in a hurry, should be noted. Melt a table- spoonful of butter in an omeZeWe-pan, and slip two eggs into it, carefully avoiding breaking the yolks ; let them set in the butter, as a poached egg sets in water; the moment they are sufficiently firm, let them slide off into the hot dish ready to receive them, pouring the butter in which they were cooked over them. Put in the eggs the moment the butter melts ; for, when first they go in, the pan should not be too hot: a drop or two of tarragon vinegar may be shaken over the dished eggs, or a tiny bit of maitre d’hotel butter the size of a pea may be allowed to melt over each of them. If after dishing the eggs, you return the pan to the fire, and brown the butter before pouring it over them, you have “ ceufs au beurre noir.” Eggs broken gently over very thin shavings of cheese, (which have been placed in melted butter in an omelette- pan over the fire) and allowed to set, are called “ ceufs au fromaga”: they should be dusted with pepper, and salt before serving. I have frequently mentioned “ buttered-eggs”* in con- nection with fish, vegetable cookery, and toasts. By some, the dish is called “ scrambled eggs,” which is perhaps the more accurate title, being a translation of the French ‘ (eufs brouilles,’ the name given to it by our “ lively neighbours.” Do not forget the many ways in which you may serve this composition, and proceed to make it thus : * The “ ruvihled eggs” of Eamasauij'.

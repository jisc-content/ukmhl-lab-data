OUR KITCHENS IN INDIA. 501 for kitchen work and—nothing else. It should he quite close to the house, and connected with the hack verandah hy a covered way. It should he constructed with a frontage towards the north or south so that the rays of the morning and evening sun may strike its sides. It should contain three rooms:—the work-room, the cooking-room, and the scullery, all opening into a good verandah. In the first, the food, pastry, &c., should he prepared; it should therefore he well ventilated, and have a good glass window or sky light, a large dresser, a marhle pastry slab, a rack for plates and dishes, shelves for cups, jugs, howls, &c., a cupboard for culinary stores, and a gauze meatsafe to protect meat, &c., from flies. Communication between this room and the cooking-room should he shut off so that no smoke could find its way into it: things should he carried to the kitchen via, the verandah. The cooking-room should, if possible, contain an English or American range. Failing that, a country-made range upon English principles, the construction of which I will discuss hy-and-by. It should he well ventilated, well lighted, and, in any circumstances, should contain a chimney. A table for dishing up, &c., would be required here, and also racks for ladles, di’edgers, &c., with shelves for the utensils. The scullery being merely used for washing up, the drawing, cleaning, and plucking of poultry, and work of that nature, would require a well made water-tight sink, communicating with an equally carefully made cistern, covered by a trap-door, outside the building : the cistern should be emptied every day, and well sprinkled with McDougall’s disinfecting powder. A tap of -Red Hills water in the scullery would bo a great boon at Madi’as. 54

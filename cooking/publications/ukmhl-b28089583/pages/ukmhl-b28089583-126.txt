CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 112 there is an especial one which I ought to have brought to prominent notice before. I refer to the method which obtains in the cookroom of removing the feathers from poultry, geese, ducks, and game. I cannot call it “ pluck- ing,” for, as many of you know, the feathers are got rid of wholesale by plunging the bird into scalding hot-water ! The immediate effect of this ignorant habit is to harden and parch the skin of the fowl, to prevent the proper exudation and admission of moisture during roasting, and to render the flesh dry and tasteless. Birds must be plucked by hand, and their small down must be singed. To ensure this being done in your kitchen, order all birds to be brought for inspection when trussed for cooking, and the smallest experience will enable you to detect the parchment-like skin of the scalded bird, from that of the hand-plucked one, which will be cool and soft, with an unmistakable freshness which the other cannot have. A basket containing the feathers should also be shown, for they will expose scalding in a minute. It is needless to say that game is ruthlessly spoiled by this trick of the kitchen, and even the chicken destined for a curry is robbed of half its flavour by being scalded flrst. The practice is, of course, the offspring of idleness,—a sub- terfuge to escape trouble. I would also point out that the common way of killing poultry in this country is inhuman, and, in a culinary point of view, utterly wi’ong. Setting aside the cruelty of cutting a fowl’s throat, and throwing it on the ground to bleed to death in agony, what an idiotic thing it is to waste the very part of the bird from which its gravy, and juiciness are derived ! White meats are bled in England simply to produce the necessary tint, but they lose much of their nutritious quality by the process. They, how- ever, can afford to do so. Our poorly flavoured birds can ill endure the loss of an atom of the richness that they

47 THICK SOUPS AND PUREES. I have given several recipes for thick soups such as mock-turtle, ox-tail, giblet, &c., in my menus, and if the few general rules I have laid down be carefully noted, I think that my readers will experience very little difficulty in carrying them out satisfactorily. And now, we come to the puree which, to my mind, is perhaps one of the most important features of the whole study of cookery. In India this form of preparing our meat and vegetables ought to be much more generally understood and practised than it is. In a puree we can work into a palatable and wholesome condition, meat that from its poverty or tough- ness, would be sorry fare indeed if boiled, or roasted. An ordinary little dish of neatly trimmed mutton-chops (nicely grilled over a clear fire) becomes an artistic entree if served roTmd a nest of mashed potato, containing a delicate puree of vegetable, such as celery, peas, asparagus, tomato, spinach, &c., whilst common onion sauce, thus treated, is promoted to the dignity of sauce souhise. Old partridges and jungle fowl, the remains of cold poultry, and of all game, can be turned to capital account in a puree. Even an ancient, and extraordinarily tough “ moorghee” may be thus rendered fit to eat. For the sick, and for those suffering from tooth-ache, food cooked in this manner is invaluable, whilst there can be no doubt that it must be good for children. In order to be able to accomplish the making of purees satisfactorily you must possess a strong pestle and mortar, a large hair sieve, a wire sieve, and a mincing machine. If you desire to make a puree of meat of any kind, an immense amount of labour is saved by first using the mincer, the work in the mortar is then reduced to a mini- mum, and the pounded meat will soon be ready to pass through the sieve.

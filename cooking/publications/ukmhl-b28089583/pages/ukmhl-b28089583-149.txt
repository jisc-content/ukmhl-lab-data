135 OUR VEGETABLES. gathered in your own garden : those bought in the Indian market are, as a rule, far too old, having been allowed to attain the largest size possible. I have eaten peas from my own garden at Bangalore, and Secunderabad, as delicious as could be desired. They were small, because the pods were cut with their contents scarcely more than three parts developed, but for flavour and tenderness, they could not have been better. During our winter season at Madras we can grow our own peas, and surely the trouble is slight when we consider the result. For boiled peas :—Put one quart of water with a tea- spoonful of salt, one of sugar, and half an ounce of green mint on the Are : when it boils, pour in a pint measure of shelled peas ; boil quickly; when done, drain, and turn them out upon a frying-pan with an ounce of butter, sprinkle a little salt and finely-pounded sugar over them, work the pan till the butter melts, and is blended with peas, then empty them upon a hot dish and serve.

A quarter of an hour is ample: they should be

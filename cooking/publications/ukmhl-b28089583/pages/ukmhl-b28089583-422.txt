MENU FOR A DINNER OF SIX. 408 7.—Now here we have a very recherche sweet dish. The specialite of creams a la Moscovite con- MMoovite ^ sists in their being sent to table very cold,—not frozen as an iced pndding, but so long buried in ice as to be almost as cold. The cream is easy enough. Pass a pot of apricot jam through a fine sieve. Boil a pint and a half of milk ; mix into it when cool the yolks of ten eggs and make a rich custard. Stir into the custard when cool, an ounce and a half of dissolved gelatine, and then the strained jam. If not sweet enough, you must now add a little sugar. Set the liquid in a mould upon ice, and when you perceive that it is beginning to congeal, add half a pint of whipped cream, and a glass of noyeau. Stir the contents of the mould together, and then bury it in ice for at least two hours. Serve as cold as possible. ♦ Pickled steak, or chops. Place a steak in a deep dish with a couple of onions sliced, a clove of garlic, pepper corns, salt, some leaves of thyme, and marjoram, a bunch of parsley, and some lime peel. Add oil and vinegar (two table-spoonfuls of former to one of latter) sufficient to soak the meat well without actually covering it. Let it soak all day; lift it, when wanted, from the marinade, and fry lightly in butter: then (when coloured on both sides nicely) pour in the marinade, with a breakfast-cup of made-gi’avy, and stew the steak gently till thoroughly done.—Strain the liquor, free it from fat, reduce it a little over the fire, pour over the steak, and serve. This is just as good with a nice mutton steak, or a few juicy chops.

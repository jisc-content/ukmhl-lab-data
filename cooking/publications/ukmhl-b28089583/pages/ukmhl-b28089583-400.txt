MENU FOR A PARTY OF EIGHT. 386 flavoured -witli tarragon, decorate a plain mould with white of hard-boiled egg, slices of truffle and cornichons, pour in a little jelly and set the garnish, then pack youi' mould with the fillets of partridge between layers of the paste and slices of truffle. Ice this, and present it with sauce ravigote (also iced) in a boat, and dry toast. “ Aspic Jelly.”—This requires attention; the common flavourless jelly, consolidated with isinglass, should be avoided if possible. In order to turn out an aspic, fit to present at a dinner party, you must proceed in this way— Put into a stew-pan an ox-foot cleaned and cut up, with a bacon bone, or a slice or two of ham or bacon, any scraps of raw meat, such as cutlet trimmings you may have, or, better far, a young fowl cut up as for fricassee, with a few mixed vegetables, &c., as for soup. Add a cup of cold water, cover the pan, set it on the fire, shaking it occasion- ally : when the pieces of meat begin to take colour, add a little more water, and in about half an hour, pour in enough water to cover the contents of the pan completely ; put in a tea-spoonful of caramel, and then let the vessel simmer for three hours very gently. Wlien ready, strain the liquor off into a bowl, let it get cool, skim it carefully, add a tea-spoonful of sugar, and table-spoonful of tarragon vinegar, clarify it, (q. v. page 33) and sti*ain it finally through a clean cloth, producing a clear, amber-coloured liquid, which will set of its own accord without isinglass, if put in the ice-box. A couple of calf’s feet, or four sheep’s feet may be used. 7.—In wet weather excellent mushrooms are procurable at nearly every station in this Presi- dency ; assuming that on this occasion we have been fortunate enough to get a dish of a dozen nice ones, a very toothsome entremets can be made of them in this manner ;—First, be careful in cleaning them; cut Baked Mushrooms.

♦ Vegetables—concluded. 4^ ABB AGES (choutti) must be carefully washed, their dead and bruised leaves removed, and their stalks trimmed neatly. They must then be soaked in salt and water, (cold) to get rid of insects, caterpillars, &c. When satisfied that they are fit to cook, plunge them into boiling water with a tea-spoonful of salt, and a bit of soda and lift them as soon as your teat with the skewer assures you that they are done. Pressure is now necessary to get rid of the water, and when thoroughly drained, they can be sent up. Cabbages however are better done in the steamer, by which process they do not absorb so much water, so do not require such careful draining. The flavour of all green vegetables, indeed, is more snccessfully developed by. this system of cookery than by boiling. The only objection that may be urged is that their colour is rarely so bright. This may be overcome by placing a bag with wood ashes enclosed in it in the water. Vege- tables shonld be carefully prepared as if for boiling, some salt should be sprinkled over their leaves, and they should be placed, dry, in the perforated receptacle that fits into the top of the steamer. Water should then be poured into the lower vessel, filling it not more than half full. The steamer should then be placed over a brisk fire.

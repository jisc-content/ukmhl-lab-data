MENU FOR A DINNER OF SIX. 432 cut a slice into the breast, let the gravy run out for a moment, then add to it in the dish (tipped up) a tea- spoonful of salt, a salt-spoonful of Nepaul pepper, a tea- spoonful of mixed mustard, and a glass of portwine. Stir these ingredients into the gravy, baste the bird -well %vith it, and go on with the carving. 6.—If you summon up courage to try this homely dish, you will often order it again. Buy drumstick enough young moringa pods to yield seeds enough to fill a little pie-dish. Boil them, and scrape out the seeds, and the tender flesh inside the pods, into a basin: stir into this a table-spoon- ful of cream, or a coffee-cupful of milk in which the yolks of two eggs have been well beaten; season with salt and pepper, and add a few drops of anchovy essence; pass this into a well buttered pie-dish, and grate over the sur- face a good layer of Parmesan or any nice mild dry cheese. Bake for a quarter of an hour, and serve. If you can bake and serve the mixture in silver coguille shells,—one for each guest,—the entremets will, of course, look nicer. 6.—Make a rich custard with a pint of_ cream and a pint of milk, I|oz. of isinglass, sugar to taste, and the yolks of eight eggs. Flavour it with any essence you like, strain it, and divide it into three basins ; colour the first a bright red with cochineal, the second green with spinach greening, and leave the third its original colour. Whip each separately to a froth. These operations must he done while the custard is still warm. Set according to the following process :—Lay a mould on ice, pour some of the red cream into it to the thickness of about an inch. When this is set, pour in a similar layer of the plain cream, and, when this is set, pour in a layer of the green cream. Go on pouring in layers in the same way until the mould is filled. When the cream is quite sot, tiu'ii it out, and Garibaldi cream.

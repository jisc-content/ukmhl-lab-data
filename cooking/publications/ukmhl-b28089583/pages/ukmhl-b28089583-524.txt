510 OVR KITCHENS IN INDIA. The superior quality of the food cooked with a perfect appliance of this kind when compared with the best results obtainable by the native system, is another strong recom- mendation in favour of the range. Take one item of daily consumption—our soup. It is not exaggeration to say that, as a general rule, the native cook takes nearly double the amount of meat and bone necessary to produce this article of food. His doing so may be attributed, of course, in a great measure to ignorance; but he can also plead as an excuse the want of a proper kitchen equipment. His practice, if left to himself, has been explained at page 41. Now, independently of the ignorance there exposed of the elementary principles of soup-making, observe the wanton wastefulness of fuel. The extraction of the nutritive elements of meat and bone requires, we all know, that slow process of cookery called simmering—a process as readily carried out with an English range, as it is almost impossible with the open brick and mud fire-places of the cook-room. At least, it stands to reason that—be the tunny-euich never so careful —the low fire, at an even degree of temperature, which simmering requires, can scarcely be maintained for hours together by the eye and hand alone. With a range in our kitchen, therefore, all we should have to do would be to explain the simmering system, and point out how easily it can be managed. Then, as soon as the native cook discovered that all that was necessary was to pull his soup kettle so many inches back upon the hot- plate, he would do so, for the new plan would not interfere with his customary absence for “ rice.” In the end we should get a soup of superior quality extracted from about half the quantity of meat that we formerly issued. In like manner all dishes requiring slow cookery, hashes, stews, sauces,—even our curries, which are often sent up tough fi’om being too quickly cooked,—would be easily

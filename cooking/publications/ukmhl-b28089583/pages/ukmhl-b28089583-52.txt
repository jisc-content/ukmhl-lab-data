CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 38 preserved provision dealers. The potted meat yon see in a confectioner’s window at home, neatly capped with melted hntter, is hiade from the beef which produced the stock of the mock-turtle (I bet anything it is “ mock- tnrtle, ’) he advertises at a shilling a basin—enterprising man! I once tested this myself. Having before me a large piece of soup-meat apparently full of nutiument, I determined as an experiment, to make potted meat of it. Martha, my cook, looked sourly on,—I little knew that I was robbing her of the price of that meat from the nearest pastry-cook,—and called it, for her part, a “ hawful mess”; but we, who ate it, found it delicious. In London, and all large towns in England, a regular private trade in soup- meat, dripping, and fragments, is carried on between our cooks and the keepers of refreshment rooms, which both parties regard as perfectly legitimate. But to return to the subject of soups. Although we may succeed in mastering the difficulties of the comomme, or foundation of soup-making, we must not forget that our work may be spoiled by the introduction of some barbarism peculiar to the Indian kitchen. An idea prevails with some people that clear soups require to be assisted with gelatine, or isinglass, to give them a sort of glutinous con- sistency. Ramasamy has discovered a very pernicious sort of starch which he produces from a raw-potato, and by this compound the soup in many houses, I know, is ruined. The potato imparts a crude, inky flavour to the consomme which is hard to describe on paper, but is fatal in its effect upon the palate. It kills all the flavour of the meat and vege- tables.

The consomme cannot# be too bright, light, and clear. ;i “ Country parsley,” to my mind, spoils any soup. It is) t

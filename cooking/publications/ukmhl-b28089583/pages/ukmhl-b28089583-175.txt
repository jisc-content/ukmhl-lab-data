VEGETABLES—CON CL UDEb. 161 Cardoons, (cardans) d la moelle are of course well known by those who have travelled abroad. I have seen tinned cardoons in India, but not the vegetable itself. Accord- ins: to M. Audot the strons: mid-ribs of the leaves of white beetroot (cardes poirees), and the tender stalks of globe artichokes (pieds d’arlichauts) form a nice substitute. The latter should be scraped free from their fibrous skin, and stewed in blanc as described for celery d la moelle. In order to blanch the artichoke stems, it is necessary, after the vegetable has been gathered, to bend the shoot down, and earth it up : the parts thus covered turn white, and you in this way obtain an excellent substitute for cardoons. Salsify—(salsifis ou scorsonera) is an edible root which we ought to grow abundantly in India. There are two kinds of this vegetable :—the white and the black. The former is called salsifis, the latter scorsonera. The one is gathered in its first year’s growth, the other not until it is two years old. I do not know whether any of our horti- cultm’al societies have yet introduced salsify or not; in case it may have been grown, I take the opportunity of recommending the previous recipe (viz. :—d la moelle') as equally applicable to the gently stewed roots of this plant. Salsify has a very perceptible flavour of the oyster (is indeed called the “ oyster plant” in Ajmerica), and forms several delicious entremets. The roots peel easily when boiled, and the pulp is as white as snow. Simply mashed with cream, and a tea-spoonful of anchovy sauce, with a covering of bread-crumbs strewn over it, and a little melted butter, then baked till brown, and served in coquilles, salsify presents an exact imitation of “ oysters scalloped.” Salsify puree with cream can be served wherever oyster sauce is recommended, with a tasty fillet of beef for

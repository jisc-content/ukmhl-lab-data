Sometimes sardines are too soft to fillet; in that case he contented with skinning them only. Oysters, of course, are never sent round with the cheese. When they appear before dinner, send them up in their shells, and be quick with their accompaniments. You sometimes see a hungry man polish off his bivalves before the lime, pepper, and bread and butter, have reached him. You can combat this contingency by breaking up the dishes containing these adjuncts into detachments, and serving them in two or three directions at once. But a far better plan is this. Before dinner is announced, put the plates of oysters with the slices of brown bread and butter upon them in each guest’s place, and send your vinegar and pepper round as fast as you can after they are seated. In selecting your hors dloeuvres to accompany the cheese try to avoid giving two fishy things on the same dish, thus :—do not give anchovies, and prawn butter together, or olives farmies and caviare ; but take, let us say, anchovy butter, devilled ham, and oat biscuit, or cream cheese, olives fargies, and wafer biscuit. Here are a few com- binations :— Anchovy fillets, watercress, butter, dry toast. Kippered seer fish, sliced tongue, oat biscuit. Herring a la sardine, potted tongue, dry biscuit. Cheese fingers, green butter, radishes. Cucumber, olives fargies, oat biscuit. Pilchards in oil, maitre d'hotel butter, pulled bread. The best cheese you can get, cut into dice, should accom- pany the above if served d VAnglaise at that period of the dinner.

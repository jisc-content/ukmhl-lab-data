CAMP COOKERY. • 317 period, he would, of course, require a keg of oil. I use my stove for some hours daily, aud my mouth s expeuditure does not exceed ten quart bottles. Another of Mr. Woolf’s valuable inventions, which I can strongly advise the traveller to obtain, is the “ Lang spirit lamp”: the large one costs five shillings and six- pence, and is a never failing source of comfort on a jouj'ney. In camp it would be found a most useful appendage to the Acme stove for light work, such as boil- ing milk for coffee, cooking eggs in all sorts of ways, heat- ing sauces, frying bacon, &c. I use mine for omelettes almost every day in cantonment, for which work it is admirably adapted. With a “ Lang lamp” you can make a cup of tea or coffee in the train, by the side of the road, on arrival at a public bungalow, or under a tree whilst the lascars are pitching your tent: and by its aid, and that of a small frying-pan, you can devil a biscuit, fi’y a rasher, poach an egg, or cook a kidney, to accompany the tea or coffee. It is fed by methylated spirit, a gallon of which would last for at least two months. Having thus directed your attention to two excellent appliances for the camp kitchen,* I will return to the sub- ject of baking bread, for your servants can always contrive a field oven for you without difidculty, which, though infinitely inferior to that of the stove, will perform the task required of it fairly enough. But in wet weather, the owner of an Acme will, of course, laugh and grow fat, whilst his neighbour with only Ramasamy’s fine whether make-shift to fall back upon, will beg for bread. I have baked at home regularly now for over two years using, for ordinary bread, Yeatman’s baking powder, * There axe, I dare say, cookinf^ stoves, fed by mineral oils, patented by other firms, which are similar to the Acme in working and quite as good. I have confined my remarks to the one which 1 have thoroughly tested. 31

CULINARY yOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 88 of a whole clove, or a pepper corn, in any disli or sauce ? Common sense accordingly dictates that when the use of these condiments is necessary, we should strain the liquid in which they have been placed before serving it. The back-bone of “ bread-sauce” is the flavomunor of the milk with which it is made, to begin with; that done, to strain it carefully over your grated crumbs; then to re-heat it, and finish it off with a good table-spoonful of cream at the moment you serve it. In the absence of cream, the yolk of one egg, beaten up in a little milk till it looks creamy, may be added, off the fire, just at the last, but cream should be used if possible.

There can be no evasion of the milk. Water at once jiro-

THICK SOUPS, AND PUREES. 49 The pith of this recipe, and of all receipts for purees, lies in the liaison of melted butter and flour which must be worked into the soup as described, and at the period indi- cated. Why ?—well, have you ever noticed carrot, or pea-soup, which, when sent to table, instead of looking the creamy red, or green puree that you desired, presented the appearance of a thin gi’avy soup, with a quantity of the vegetable pulp at the bottom of each basin—the stock and the pulp not having amalgamated?

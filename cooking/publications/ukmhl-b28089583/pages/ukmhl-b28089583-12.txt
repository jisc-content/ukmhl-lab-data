AUTHOR’S PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION- ♦ I first began to write about Cookery I flattered myself that I had undertaken a very easy, and plea- sant task. I thought that my jottings would be composed currente calamo, and that I should be able to carry out my projeft with satisfadlion land success. But at the hour of launching my frail shallop from the shore, I am compassed about with grave doubts concerning its seaworthiness. Alas! :— “ My conscience hath a thousand several tongues. And evei’y tongue brings in a several tale. And every tale condemns me for" a very Icarus. Lo! the wings of my ambition have melted, and I have fallen into the sea of blighted hope. I am only conscious of failure. I undertook much, what have I performed ? Whilst, however, I frankly acknowledge my many shortcomings, I derive some consolation in trying to believe that, there may nevertheless be a few things recorded in the pages of my book which will be found useful. If this hope be realized, and if the Ladies OF Madras—to whom, in all humility, I dedicate the first fruits of my labours—discover here and there a word of assist- ance when perplexed about their daily orders, I shall be bounti- fully rewarded, and the winter of my discontent will indeed be made glorious summer. I have to tender my best acknowledgments to the Proprietors of the Madras AthencBiim and Daily News for the permission t they have kindly given me to republish my culinary articles which appeared originally in that journal; I have to express my gratitude for the hints I have received from friendly in the science of cookery; and to own that I have obtained the most valuable aid from the writings of Jules Gouffe, and the “ G.

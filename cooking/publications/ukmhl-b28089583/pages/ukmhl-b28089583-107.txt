93 SA UCESâ€”CONTINUED. Not long- ago I observed in tbe Qtieen newspaper a ques- tion from a lady wbo was apparently in great distress about mayonnaise sauce. She complained that she could not get the mixture as tliiclc as she desired, and bego-ed for instruction. Two answers were given the following week : one of them urged the lady to thicken with flour or arrowroot, and the other advocated mashed potato ! blow, I need scarcely say that this was a case in which the blind attempted to lead the blind. Mayonnaise and tar- tare sauces should be thickened by beating the oil and raiu yolks together perseveringly. With patience the mixtui-e can, in this way, be made to stand as stifflv as thick batter.

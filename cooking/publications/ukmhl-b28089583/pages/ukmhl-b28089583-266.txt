252 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. have cured one joint, boil the liquid up again, skimming off the scum, add a little saltpetre, salt, &c., and it will be fit to receive another piece of meat. Let us now proceed to cure a tongue of from three to four pounds weight. For which the following ingredients must be prepared;— Best bazar salt u lb. Saltpetre ....1 oz. Bay-salt (Ind-oopoo) 1 Spiced pepper ....1 >> Moist sugar 5 The juice of three limes and a sherry-glass of good vinegar; or, if no limes be procurable, two glasses of vinegar. First, rub the tongue—after cleansing and wiping it thoroughly—with the bazar salt and “ spiced pepper the operation will expend about a quarter of a pound of the former. When satisfactorily salted, put the tongue aside, and let it drain for the rest of the day to get rid of any blood that it may still contain. After rubbing in the salt, proceed to make the brine as follows :—Take a roomy enamelled sauce-pan and put in- to it the remaining bazar salt (about a pound) the bay- salt, saltpetre, the lime juice, and vinegar, and a pint and a half of cold water. Boil these over a low fii’e, removing all scum as it rises, when clear of scum and well boiled, the liquor may be set to get cold. Make a separate syrup with the sugar, diluting it with water in a small sauce-pan, and heating it gently till free from scum and smooth, then let it get cold. When the salt liquor and syrup are cold, they should be amalgamated, the work being done with a wooden spoon, and the brine being then completed should be poui’ed into the tub.

Butter a small but deep pie-dish or plain mould: cut a thin piece of bread (to form the top of the charlotte) the size and shape of the top of the mould, butter it on both sides, and put it into the mould; now line the side of the mould with moderately thin strips of bread and butter, buttered on both sides: that is to say, cover both the inverted top and sides of the mould, mak- ing a case of bread and butter as it were. Within the case place layers of apples cut small, (or sliced ripe plantains) with apricot jam spread between each layer, some lime juice sprinkled over them all, and a good allowance of white sugar: when packed, cover the bottom of the mould with slices of bread and butter, the same as that used for the top and sides, and bake till the bread browns nicely. Use plenty of good butter please, and you will find this a simple but pleasant sweet dish ; a sprinkling of any liqueur would, of course, add to the nice flavour of the fruit. Turn it out very carefully, and let cold custards accom- pany the charlotte. Florican roti- On account of its rarity in the Madras market, I have _ ^ . accidentally forgotten to include this.

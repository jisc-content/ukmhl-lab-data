CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 8 It need scarcely be said, then, that if this system be fol- lowed in its entirety, the rot and the releve being carefully selected, the service of two light entrees between them is both intelligible and artistic. In favour of the older English custom it has been argued, with considerable justice, that delicate works of culinary science—such as entrees are supposed to be—should be pre- sented while the palate is yet fresh, and while the diner is thoroughly able to detect and appreciate the niceties of flavour, crispness, tenderness, and so forth; that a slice of plainly roasted or boiled meat, with a selected vegetable, should follow; then a morsel of game, and the entremets. Advocates of this very excellent method, it will be observ- ed, do not pay any particular attention to the rot. When game is out of season, they present a savory entremets immediately after their releve, and send round their salad with the saddle or sirloin. Thus, in the space marked in the printed menu for “ rots,” we occasionally see “ aspic de foie gras” with “ asperges en branches,” and no rot whatever. Of the two systems the older one is certainly the simpler. The correct introduction of the rot is really the novel feature of the new menu—poulet au cresson, salade,” for example, never figured in the old bill of fare in the place of game— and by its introduction the releve, altered a good deal in character, is of necessity pushed out of its original place. It will always be conceded, I thiuk, by partisans of both systems, that each possesses merits of an undeniable character. The old method, as we have seen, is the simpler, and consequently the easier of the two, while the new may be voted more truly artistic. In adopting the latter, how- ever, it is a sine gud non that all the principles of the dinner be observed, and faithfully carried out. We cannot miss a single point, or our little feast will become a fiasco.

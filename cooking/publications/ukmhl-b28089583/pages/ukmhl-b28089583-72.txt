CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 58 “ au gratin,” and cream is often judiciously introduced to enrich the combination. Fishes carefully stuffed, and baked •whole, are generally nice : it is a method very "yv'eH suited to fresh -water fish, and a delicious way of cooking a Madras mullet, or a dish of whitings. The best dish of stewed fish is the “ matelote” which, strictly speaking, should be composed of eels, but may, I think, be equally well followed in dressing any firm-fieshed fish.

Broiling fish sounds simple, but under this head there are a few toothsome recipes not to be despised. Let a good cut of seer be divided into nice cutlets. Parbdll them in the morning, and set them to marinade all day in salad oil, minced shallot, parsley, vinegar, a clove of garlic, a few whole pepper corns, and a little lime peel. Take them out, wrap them -with the shallot, &c., in well-oiled papers, broil over a fast clear fire, and serve with a nice sharp bro"wn sauce like sauce Robert. Take care that the bars of your grid-iron are well oiled, for they are apt to burn delicate morsels like fillets of fish en papillotes.

Stuff the fish, wrap it in oiled paper, tie it to the spit, and baste continually with melted butter and white wine. Remove the paper before serving. The Bouillabaisse may be attempted at Madi*as with a result sufficiently satisfactory to wan-ant my being bold enough to record a simple recipe for it, adapted from that of the “ G. C.” as follows :—

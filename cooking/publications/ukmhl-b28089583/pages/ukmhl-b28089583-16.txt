2 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. tion in the dinner menu of establishments conducted accord- ing to the new regime. A little treatise on cookery, then, showing the reader how to accomplish successfully, with the average means at his disposal in this country, some of the many tasty dishes spoken of in the modern English and continental books upon the subject, will, I am sanguine enough to hope, be received with kindly toleration, if not with cordiality, by those who consider it worth while to be interested in matters culinary. Thirsting for some instruction of this kind, I remember buying, some few years ago, a little book which had just then been published at Madras, and which promised by its title to provide the thing needful. Alas ! how sorely dis- appointed was I with my purchase, for the work had assuredly been written for the Anglo-Indian in England rather than for the Englishman in India. With the exception of dishes of purely native origin, little or no instruotion worth following was given to the Madras housewife, whilst there was much dangerous counsel prof- fered which should be most carefully avoided. The most reprehensible customs were, in point of fact, laid down over and over again as precepts. Concerning these, I will say nothing now, for I propose to devote a separate chapter to the important subject of the cook-room, and to expose the besetting sins of our native cooks whenever they occur to me. The book to which I refer has not, as far as I am aware, been followed here by any fresh work, and I think, I may say that at any rate its pages scarcely contained the sort of instruction we look for now-a-days. In taking upon myself, therefore, the task of humbly ministering to the reformed taste of the horn’, I am encouraged by the reflec- tion that I am, so to speak, a breaker of fresh gi’ound.

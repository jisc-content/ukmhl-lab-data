CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 120 course, so serve it, but do not I’un away with the erroneous notion that you must boil (and so spoil) your turkey because your other joint happen to be a saddle, or a sii-loin. The process of steaming has become familiar to many people in India on account of the introduction of Warren's cooking-pot, and vegetable steamer. I have been told that during the recent campaign in Afghanistan, this utensil was found invaluable, and I can well believe it. The term “ steaming” is frequently applied not only to the Warren process, but also to the cooking of meat and vegetables placed in hermetically closing utensils, which, in turn, are plunged into larger vessels filled with boiling water. Warren’s system needs no description for detailed in- structions accompany every vessel. Its chief recommen- dation consists in its simplicity and economy. Meat well braised may be said to be equally nutritious, for it is in like manner cooked in its own vapoui’ and juices ; but in the matter of fuel braising is by far the more expensive method, while the careful regulation of the heat, &c., cost^ infinitely more trouble than the simple boiling of a War- ren’s pot. The one process requires the hand of a chef: the other can be managed by any one. The not uncommon practice of partly roasting a joint after it has been nearly cooked in a Warren’s pot is erro- neous. The result can at best be that of meat half-boiled, half-roasted,—“ neither fi.sh, nor fowl, nor good red her- ring,” so to speak. A good cook ought, by the clever- treatment of the gravy made by the meat, to be able to diversify both the appearance and flavour of the joint, adding to its attractiveness by a tasteful garnish of mac- caroni or vegetables. The utmost cleanliness is absolutely necessary in the use of Warren’s pot.

Monsieur le mari cheerfully I’eceives his portion, but pre- sently encounters grit, and orders his plate to be taken away, murmuring something about the impolicy of petty economy in connection with flour. Madame la chatelaine, conscious of procuring the best of everything, replies— more in sorrow than in anger, yet withal warmly—and denies the unkind impeachment, though constrained to send her plate away also. And thus a cloud comes over what ought to he a very happy tete-X-tete, while indiges- tion, the natural result of irritation at meals, most pro- bably follows. Now the wmrst of it is that unless people happen to discover the real causes of accidents such as these themselves, they may wait until doomsday for enlighten- ment. The mental equilibrium of the native cook is in no wise disturbed by a dust storm, for he is perfectly accustomed to them; and the butler will assuredly invent a plausible excuse for the contretemps ;—“ little bit yegg- shell,” or “ sugar mistake.” It therefore comes to this, that we must insist upon a nicer appreciation of the cleanliness and care that the preparation of food demands, and to accomplish that end satisfactorily a room of the kind I have described appears to me to be essentially necessary. I am perfectly aware that, in some instances, every species of obstruction will at first be thi’ust in the way of those who try to follow my advice, and, in others, that the change will be obeyed with reluctance. But deter- mination and tact combined wiU, I think, overcome opposi- tion after a time, and the very malcontents themselve.s will end by praising the now regime.

62 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. Quite in a special parenthesis by themselves ought to be kept all plats which can be served cold, such as the chaud-froid, chartreuse, petits galantines, truffled cutlets, &c., for in a climate such as this an iced entree cannot fail to attract attention, whilst for providing contrast, and other reasons, I shall speak of presently, it is invaluable.

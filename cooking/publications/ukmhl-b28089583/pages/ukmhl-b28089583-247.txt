233 SAVOURY TOASTS. little mildew from damp,in your bottle of grated Par- mesan, remember, will ruin any disb in which it may he used afterwards. Choose a good, fresh, hard, dry cheese, of a mild family, for toasts, &c.: between ourselves, indeed, I know of no more useful domestic sort than the round Butch. It is a cheap cheese, and inclined to be saltish in taste, but that is. of no consequence in cookery; all you have to do is to omit the item of salt mentioned in the recipe you may have selected. ‘ Dutch cheese’ grates easily, and is rarely inclined to mouldiness. Next to Par- mesan, I would sooner use it than any of the other com- monly imported kinds. I may have omitted a few good toasts in this chapter, I hope, however, that I have given several that will prove acceptable.

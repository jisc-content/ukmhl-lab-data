The eggs (one for each person) must however be carefully poached, neither too lightly nor too hard, then trimmed neatly leaving as little margin of white as possible, and served with the soup. A few leaves of dried tarragon flavour the consomme very pleasantly, and grated Parmesan should be handed round on a separate plate. If you have no tar- ragon leaves, try a little of the vinegar. Note this:—In order to make sure of not breaking the eggs in the tureen,—order your butler to heat the soup plates and place the poached eggs in them, before he serves the soup : he can then pour the soup over the eggs, instead of having to ladle them out of the soup, which is always an operation requiring much delicacy of touch, and a broken egg spoils the appearance of the consomme.

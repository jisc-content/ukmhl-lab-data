CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 200 A fish kramoushy is easily accomplished : you need only mince the fish, stir into it, in a sauce-pan on the fire, a few spoonfuls of well made white sauce, add a little season- ing, with the yolk of an egg when off the fire, and set it to cool. In like manner, tinned lobster, tinned oysters, and any tinned fish, can thus be successfully treated. In using them, however, it is necessary to wash, and di’ain them from the liquid of the tin. The sauce should be made very carefully, so that it may freshen iip the fish as much as possible. An oyster, plainly dipped in the batter I have given you, and fried secundum artem, is perhaps as dainty a morsel as can be presented to the jaded appetite of an Anglo-Indian. Drain the oysters from them liquor in the tin, wipe them, and set them, en marinade all the day in a soup plate, with the juice of three limes, an onion sliced some whole peppers, and a few cloves ; turn them occasion- ally till they are wanted for the /ritere-pan. Oyster fritters thus treated, form an excellent garnish, and may be served with boiled or fried fish, or a dish of filets de bceuf. Here is a super-excellent idea of the “ G. C.’s” :—Split each oyster open, almost as wide, comjjaratively speaking, as you do a kidney, and insert therein a little of the fol- lowing composition :—toss on the fire in butter, with pep- per, salt and a spoonful of rich brown sauce, a dessert- spoonful each of minced mushroom, shallot, and truffle ; thicken this with the yolks of two eggs, give it the juice of a lime, and let it get cold. After putting a small allow- ance of this in each oyster, shut the sides together, dip it in the batter, and fry immediately. I have already indicated the vegetables which make good frittei’s, and here repeat my high opinion of that method of treating them.

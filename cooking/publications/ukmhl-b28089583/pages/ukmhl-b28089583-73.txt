REGARDING OUR FISH. 59 Take any sort of small fish, such as small pomfret, whitings, soles, mullets, or rohal,—the greater the variety the better,—and for two pounds of mixed fish, slice up two Bombay onions, two fairly large tomatoes emptied of their seeds and cut into quarters, and one carrot; prepare a couple of slices of lime with the pithy skin cut off, a hag containing six cloves, a dozen pepper corns, a clove of o-arlic, and the peel of a lime pared as finely as possible ; a salt-spoonful of saffron, a tea-spoonful of salt, and one pod of capsicum sliced, will also he wanted : put the whole into a stew-pan, and add to it a wine-glass of salad oil, one of chahlis, and a pint and a half of cold water, boil for about hdlf an hoim, and, just before serving, add a heaped up table-spoonful of freshly-chopped curled parsley. The parsley is absolutely indispensable. Serve the fish, in a deep dish, with some of the broth round it, sending up the rest of the broth fii-st, poured boiling hot over some slices of stale bread. Remove the bag of condiments, of course, before serving the houillahaisse. The dish will not be as good, to be sure, as that which some of my readers may have enjoyed in the south of France, but if the ingredients I have named be used without any omissions, a very fair imitation will certainly be produced. Having thus sketched the various ways of preparing fish for the table, I must request my readers to note the recipes I have given in my detailed menus, remembering that my object has been to suggest dishes, which, in my humble opinion, will be found more pleasing than the ordinary plainly boiled lumps of fish, which, with the stereotyped concomitants, I have so strenuously condemned too often greet the diner out in Madras.

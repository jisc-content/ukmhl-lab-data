104 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. few useful hints as to the cookery thereof. Let us there- fore take the ordinary joint of beef or of mutton which Ramasamy brings daily from bazar for “ Master and Mrs. only” :—the diminutive sirloin, the ribs scarcely larger than the loin chops of a Leicestershire sheep, the three- and-a-half pound leg of mutton, or the wizen loinlet,—and let us assume that the meat, though small, is fairly good,— what shall we do with it ? In a country where it is impossible to keep cooked meat, the fact of a joint being small, need hardly be considered a drawback, but we have before us a good deal of bone in proportion to the meat, and very little fat. I say boldly that plainly roasting such a fragment is a mistake. Unless the joint be of a fair size, and above the average as to fat like the saddle, or the specially fine sirloin we buy for a dinner party, I would never roast it. The morsel can ill afford to lose the little gravy it possesses which the stab of the spit is bound to di'aw, and which we rarely see sent to table, for Ramasamy appreciates it as an adjunct to his curry. The only way to cook little joints, such as those I have indicated, is to braise them. You thus obtain all the nourishment the meat can give, and a tasty and tender dish into the bargain. This admirable method of cookery is far too rarely adopted : so for the benefit of those who do not understand the process, I had better mention that braising consists in placing meat in a closed pan, with some made-gravy or stock round it, vegetables cut up, and a judicious allowance of salt and pepper. In this the meat is very slowly simmered, whilst it is browned exter- nally by live coals placed on the &rom«y-pan lid. There is thus heat from above and below the pan, and the joint is cooked in its own gravy, while it derives additional flavour from the vegetables, &c., associated with it.

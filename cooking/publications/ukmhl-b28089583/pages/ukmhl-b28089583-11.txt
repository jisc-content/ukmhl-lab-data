PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION- —♦— tWI NG to the unavoidable delay attending the transmission of proofs between Simla and Madras, the fourth edition of the Culinary yottings has been nearly twelve months in my publishers’ hands. For this I offer my sincere apologies. I have endeavoured to corredl and improve what I have already published, and have added one hundred pages of new matter. Three articles on curries and mulligatunny which appeared in the Pioneer have, by the kind permission of the Proprietors of that journal, been introduced; the subjedl of vegetables has received still closer attention; and among a number of new recipes several will be found for the treatment of rice which I hope will be found useful. Vegetarians (who perhaps might be more accurately described as non-consumers of animal food) will, I trust, discover some acceptable hints in this edition, while those who are anxious to adopt the new form of menu, will find their task explained and simplified. ]Vyyern.

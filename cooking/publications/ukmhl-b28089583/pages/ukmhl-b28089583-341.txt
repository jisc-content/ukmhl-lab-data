327 CAMP COOKERY. I Avill conclude this chapter with thi-ee very reliable recipes for cooking a hare. If you have shot the hare yourself so much the better, for then you will not find its heart, liver and kidneys gone. Skin, clean, and wash the animal well, saving the three parts I have mentioned care- fully, and the blood. When quite clean, wipe the carcass inside and out, and let it soak in the marinade mentioned at page 66 all day, turning it every now and then. As the hour for cooking approaches, fill the hare with a well- made stuffing as for turkey (page 108). The kidneys and heart should be minced, and fried in fat bacon, with a little onion ; when done, the contents of the pan should be pom’ed into, a bowl to cool, and when cold, pounded to a paste, and mixed with the stuffing. The back of the hare should be larded, or covered with thin slices of bacon pinned down with little skewers, it should then be roasted a constant basting of melted butter or clarified beef suet being kept up throughout the process. When nearly done the bacon strips should be removed, and the back lights dredged with flour; the skin should be allowed to brown and run into crisp blisters : the hare should then be served,—with a sauce made as follows : First make a good pint of the best gravy you can • t butter in it, throw into it an onion finely shredded he on.on tm it colo™ nicely, then in Z .V r, chakmg the pan for a minnte on two • next a/d a ™t“ thet ’ ^ ^ ^ soaked, put it on theL'/yTntrvelAletatr^ and tJie sauce will thicken, throw i^trit tlm to a paeto, etir and ae.-ve very l^t. ™'

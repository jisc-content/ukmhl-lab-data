HOUSEKEEPER'S GUIDE. 163 junction with melted butter. On every occasion on which it is used, house- keepers should bear in mind tho import- ance of having the bottle well shaken, as it contains a thick sediment, which will settle. Worcester sauce is an ad- mirable compound when used in mode- ration to give tone to a variety of dishes. I will mention, however, but one, and that one so generally known—viz., the good old-fashioned Welsh rarebit. In making Welsh rarebit of course a great deal depends on the cheese, which should be moist, and not dry. A little butter should be used, simply to prevent the cheese from sticking, but not too much. There are various old-fashioned modes of imparting flavour to Welsh rarebit, the one most generally known being that of adding a little old ale. I would recommend the cook, in making a small Welsh rarebit, to try the experiment of mixing in with it a teaspoonful of Wor- cester sauce. It gives the whole dish a rich and almost gamey flavour that can- not be imparted to it by any other sauce that I can call to mind. El,LOW VEGETABLE COLOUR- ING.—See Vegetable Co- louring. a. £.

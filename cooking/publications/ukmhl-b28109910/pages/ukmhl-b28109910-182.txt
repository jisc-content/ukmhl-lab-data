Food and Feeding. 168 sometimes styled a white salmon, are both useful varieties which have never received the attention they deserve, and which may be presented simply yet effectively at table. The gurnard is much better known, and an excellent dish may be made with it. Among cheap fish, which might be obtained in any quantity and at a very small price, are the ling and hake, related closely to the cod, but chiefly used at present as salted fish and exported; the thornback, of the same family as the skate, and equal in quality; the pollack, a substantial whiting, and the coal-fish, of the same family, but second in order of quality, are both good when in season; a proviso which, it is to be remembered, applies equally to every variety. I shall but enumerate the conger—excellent for soup and stew making—one of the best materials from which to produce stock for turtle soup, often, but inap- propriately, made from veal and beef, the turtle fur- nishing the garnish and the name (see page 77) ; the whole tribe of eels with their abounding fatty con- stituents ; and the sturgeon with a flesh approaching in quality nearer than any other fish to that of meat; besides all the fresh-water fish, such as pike, tench, perch, &c., of which the supply is, by comparison with sea fish, limited; following on which there is still a large number of minor fish which it would be tedious to particularise.

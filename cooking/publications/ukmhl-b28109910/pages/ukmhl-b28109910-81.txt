Frying: m Oil and in Dripping. 67 rule in ordinary kitchens. The principle on which success depends is, that at the moment of contact with the almost boiling oil, a thin film of every part of the surface of the fish or other object to be fried is coagu- lated, so that the juices with their flavours, &c., are at once locked up within, and no quality can escape. The hath of oil should therefore he in quantity suffi- cient, and also he hot enough, to effect this result in an instant, after which, and during the few minutes requisite to cook the interior, the heat is often slightly lowered with advantage. The fish emerges when done, with a surface to which a little oil adheres, but this will drain off owing to its extreme fluidity when hot, if left on a napkin slanting a minute or two before the fire; it may thus he served absolutely free from grease. The film of egg often applied to the surface of an object to he fried, is in the same manner instantly coagulated and forms an impermeable case ; while the fine bread crumbs adhering to it take a fine yellow colour from being slightly charred by the high temperature they are exposed to. Excellent and fresh olive oil, which need not be so perfect in tint and flavour as the choicest kinds re- served for the salad-bowl, is the best available form of fat for frying, and is sold at a moderate price by the gallon for this purpose at the best Italian ware- houses.

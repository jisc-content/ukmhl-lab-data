For in all cases, it is to be remembered that no man who lias habitually eaten meat two or three times daily can at once exchange it for fish and cereals or vegetables, without some discomfort, to say the least. All radical changes in diet, even in the right direction, require to he gradually made; the stomach conforms slowly, when long accustomed to deal with highly nitrogenised animal food, to the task of deriving from unaccustomed materials the support necessary to the body. Given time for such modification of function, and it is remarkable—at least it appears so to those who have not practically studied the subject —that a diet which, if adopted suddenly might be equivalent to semi-starvation, may by degrees become the most healthful and nutritious which the individual can adopt. I may here advert to a belief which appears to be widely entertained, viz., that fish contains certain elements which adapt it in an especial manner to reno- vate the brain, and so to support mental labour. There is no foundation whatever for this view : the value of fish to the brain-worker is due simply to the facts already referred to, viz., that it contains, in smaller proportion than meat, those materials which taken abundantly demand much physical labour for their complete consumption, and which without this, produce an unhealthy condition of body, more or less incompatible with the easy and active exercise of the functions of the brain.

Bouillabaise: importance of good Consommd. 79 Thackeray’s well-known rhymes do not exaggerate its good qualities, and enumerate its component elements almost with sufficient accuracy to direct the cook.* See Appendix, p. 16d, for remarks on the selection and preparation of Fish; for receipts for fish soups and stew including details, with directions for preparing a Marscllaisc Bouillabaise, p. 173. I may conclude this brief sketch of soups by ob- serving that the ability to make a good, fragrant, and clear consomme—and nothing is easier, granted a moderate intelligence and the power of executing simple details with care—affords the key to almost all. The preparation of vegetables and the making of purees, are merely mechanical processes, easily attained. The judgment necessary to add and com- bine spices, essences, and other sources of flavour, is the one element which when possessed, in addition to the character of an attentive, dexterous, and pains- taking workman, essential to success in every profes- sion, constitutes a finished cook, and denotes his or her rank. And thus it is that the department of sauces especially gives opportunity to develop and illustrate *‘ ‘ This Bouillabaisse a noble dish is A sort of soup, or broth, or brew, Or hotch-potch of all sorts of fishes That Greenwich never could outdo : Green herbs, red peppers, mussels, saffern, Soles, onions, garlic, roach and d ice ; All these you eat at Jerre’s tavern In that one dish of Bouillabaisse."

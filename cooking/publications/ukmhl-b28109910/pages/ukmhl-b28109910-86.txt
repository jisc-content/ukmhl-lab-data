Food and Feeding. 72 this dish so much has of late appeared in public prints, failing to explain what is understood in France by it, that I think an accurate description of what it really is may prove acceptable here. The pot-au-feu is a composite dish which produces, first a simple, hut not strong, beef broth {bouillon), well flavoured by fresh vegetables; secondly, a some- what over-cooked and exhausted piece of beef (bouilli) which is served after the soup; and, lastly, the vege- tables themselves. 1 This is a different thing from the common “ stock- pot” of the French peasant, so frequently termed a pot-au-feu, and confounded with it. The primary object of a “stock-pot” is to make a decoction or basis for soup—of animal food, if possible—and every morsel of flesh, poultry, trimmings from joints, bones well bruised, &c., which are available for the purpose, are reserved for it. To the pot of the peasant, who wastes nothing whatever, all things are welcome; and every atom of nutritive material—solid or liquid— goes into it, to which are always added herbs and vegetables, together with the liquor in which any of the latter may chance to have been boiled. But some- times it is a pot inaigre, no meat of any kind having been procurable, and very good vegetable soups, moreover, are educible therefrom, of which more hereafter.

As certainly as a steam- engine requires fuel, by the combustion or oxidation of which force is called into action for various purposes— as the engine itself requires the mending and replacing of parts wasted in the process of working—so certainly does the animal body require fuel to evoke its force, and material to replace those portions which are neces- sarily wasted by labour, whether the latter be what is called physical or mental, that is, of limbs or o^ brain.

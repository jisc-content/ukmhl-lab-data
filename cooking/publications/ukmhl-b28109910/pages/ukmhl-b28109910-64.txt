No doubt that water is wilfully added in some small quantity to a very large proportion of the supply in order to cheapen it; hut where this is not done, all the vessels employed in dairy operations are more or less carefully and completely washed twice a day. It is this contact with water, employed by no means always, as it ought to be, at the boiling point, which constitutes the milk trade a ready and unceasing agency for the spread of three or four forms of disease among the population. It is only within the last few years that we have be- come aware that one of the chief methods by which typhoid fever, scarlet fever, and diphtheria are propa- gated, is by the agency of this great organization which conveys the daily milk from the cow to every house in the empire. Water which contains the smallest admixture of sewage matter is naturally, amidst the innumerable chances afforded, now and then contaminated with the excreta of persons suffer- ing from infectious disease ; and thus, in its very em- ployment for cleansing milk vessels, the seeds of fatal disease may be deposited in a single milk can, from which twenty families, say, are supplied.

Five Leading Species of Soup. 75 is with him a matter of the highest importance ; and, simple as the dish is, he devotes no less than nine pages to the task of illustrating the elementary princi- ples of cookery which are involved in the process. By way of further illustrating the subject, I shall place there also some extracts relating to it, which are extremely interesting, from Brillat-Savarin’s Physiologic da Gout, and also from Dumas’ Grand Didionnaire de Cuisine. It is not at all surprising that many persons should be somewhat bewildered by the almost endless variety of appellation under which the single article of soup is presented at table. It has been estimated that the titles which denote these numerous varieties, number altogether not less perhaps than five hundred.

In reality the number of species is very limited; but the slightest addition to a soup having been held sufficient to confer upon it a distinctive name, the idea of com- plexity and number has been unnecessarily fostered.

Let us continue to culti- vate the finest meats, and to present them simply, and we shall have no cause to be ashamed of the course in which they appear at an English table. In making the best of second-rate and insipid morsels we may still learn with advantage. The art of frying is little understood, and the omelette is almost entirely neglected by our country- men. The products of our frying-pan are often greasy, and therefore for many persons indigestible, the shallow form of the pan being unsuited for the process of boiling in oil, that is, at a heat of nearly 600° Fahr., that of boiling water being 212°.

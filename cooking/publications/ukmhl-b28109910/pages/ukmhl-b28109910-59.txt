Hence it is boiled and eaten with butter and Parmesan (dVItaliennc) and with tomatoes, which furnish saline matters, with meat gravy or with milk. Nearer home the potato forms a vegetable basis in composition closely resembling rice, and requiring therefore additions of nitrogenous and fatty elements. The Irishman’s inseparable ally, the pig, is the natural, and to him necessary, complement of the tuber, making the latter a complete and palatable dish. The every- day combination of mashed potato and sausage is an application of the same principle. In the absence of pork, the potato eater substitutes a cheap oily fish, the herring. The combination of fatty material with the potato is still further illustrated in our baked potato and butter, in fried potatoes in their endless variety of form, in potato mashed with milk or cream, also served in the ordinary way with malt-re eVhotel butter; finally arriving at the most perfect and finished combination in the pommes de terre sendees an bcurre of a first-class French restaurant, where it becomes almost a pled ele luxe. Even the simple bread and butter or bread and cheese of our own country equally owe their form and popularity to physiological necessity ; the deficient fat of the bread being supplemented by the fatty elements of each addition, the cheese supplying also its propor- tion of nitrogenous matter, which exists so largely in its peculiar principle, caseine.

3i Fish as an element of Diet. A - very large proportion of our town population would profit by exchanging some of their meat, as an article of daily diet, for fish. Where occupation is chiefly of an intellectual kind, and demands little physical exertion, fish is often much more suitable than butcher’s meat. Without active exercise in the open air, the digestive system is apt to become over- loaded and oppressed by meals consisting chiefly of meat; and even if the primary digestion of it is, in these circumstances, fairly accomplished, many a constitution suffers from an over-supply of nutritive matters, which cannot be disposed of easily without considerable habitual muscular activity. There is no doubt that the obvious and admitted value of a highly nitrogenous food, of which meat is a concentrated form, to the labouring man, has occasioned the almost universal belief that such meat, of which let beef and mutton be the type, is the most desirable food staple for all. “ If you wish to be strong, eat plenty of meat; ” “ If you are feeling weak, eat more meat, and at every meal; ” such are the well-known articles of a creed which is deeply graven in the popular mind. Nevertheless few statements relating to diet can be more misleading, and this is, as already intimated, one which gives rise to much serious ill health. It is this habit of adopting meat as the chief element of his dietary, which the sedentary man, with little opportunity for bodily exercise, the man who uses his brain more than his muscles, should especially avoid.

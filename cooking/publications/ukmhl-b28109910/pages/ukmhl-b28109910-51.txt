Various methods of cooking Haricots. 37 about two to three hours.* This quantity will fill a large dish, and may be eaten with salt and pepper. It will be greatly improved at small cost by the addi- tion of a bit of butter, or of melted butter with parsley, or if an onion or two have been sliced and stewed with the haricots. A better dish still may be made by putting all or part, after boiling, into a shallow frying pan, and lightly frying for a few minutes with a little lard and some sliced onions. With a few slices of bacon added, a comparatively luxurious and highly nutritive meal may be made. But there is still in the saucepan, after boiling the haricots, a resi- due of value, which the French peasant’s wife, who turns everything to account, utilises in a manner quite incomprehensible to the Englishwoman. The water in which dried haricots have stewed, and also that in which green French beans have been boiled, contains a proportion of nutritive matter. The French- woman preserves this liquor carefully, cuts and fries some onions, adds to it these and some thick slices of bread, a little salt and pepper with a potherb or two from the corner of the garden, and thus serves hot an agreeable and useful croute an pot. It ought to be added that the haricots so largely used by the working classes throughout Europe are not precisely either “red” or “ white,” but some cheaper local varieties, known which is a very palatable one, is well known in France as haricots verts panaches (variegated), and might be served at our tables with ad- vantage. * If the water is hard, a little soda should be added to soften it.

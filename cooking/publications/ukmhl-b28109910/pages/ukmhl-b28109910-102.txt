It is rarely practised, because any other than those conventional methods which have been universally employed in cookery arc slowly adopted by the public, until attention has been thoroughly aroused on the subject. Nevertheless the method I am about to advocate is widely applicable, and well deserves at least to rank among the other and better known modes of preparing fish. It consists in placing the fish, after the usual cleaning, entire, if of moderate size, say from a sole to a small turbot or dory, in a tin or plated copper dish adapted to the form and size of the fish, but a little deeper than the thickness of it, so as to retain all the juices; which by exposure to the heat will flow out. First, however, the surface of the fish is to be lightly spread with butter, and a morsel or two added round it; the dish is then to be plaecd in a Dutch or American oven, in front of a clear fire.* The advantages of this method are, that the fish is cooked entirely in its own juices, which are abundant, and form the best sauce, and that these juices which contain part of the nutriment and much of the charac- * Mr. W. Burton of Oxford Street, some time ago made for me an oven and dishes expressly for the purpose of cooking fish before the fire. The oven is a modification of that known as the “ American,” being rather deeper, from before backwards, and much shallov.-er, from above downwards, on account of the flat form of fish not occupying the space which is required by joints of meat.

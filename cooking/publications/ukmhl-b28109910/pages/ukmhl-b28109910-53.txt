Thus also the French, serv- ing petits pois as a separate dish, add butter freely and a dash of sugar, the former making the compound phy- siologically complete, the latter agreeably heightening the natural sweetness of the vegetable, especially when the peas are a little old, insipid, or have lost their accustomed flavour.

140 Food and Feeding. It should also be noted that numerous popular dishes have been omitted—and purposely so—from these menus, simply for the reason that they are well known, and can therefore be adopted at pleasure by way of addition or exchange. Thus, none of the joints, such as sirloins, rounds, haunches, saddles, loins, shoulders, &c., have been named, with perhaps a single exception only. Everybody is familiar with English joints, which have been on this account ex- cluded from a list necessarily so restricted as the limits of only twenty-four menus demand. For the same reason I have not named turtle in any form, nor curries; nor such special soups as mock-turtle, mulligatawny, hodge-podge, split-pea,* giblet, water- souchets, and fish soups; nor whitebait, nor the fresh-water fish, carp, tench, dace, pike, &c.; nor among sweets, tarts, ices, sorbets, and the farinaceous puddings, custards, &c.; nor have I named the preli- minary oysters, which may well he added during the season as an additional luxury. My object has been to suggest a few of tlie leading smaller dishes of a comparatively simple and not expensive kind, and to place them in proper juxtaposition in relation to each other, so far as this has been possible, -with the view of suggesting some little diversity in-the dietary of our better middle-class tables. Almost every one also * Our common split-pea soup, wholesome and agreeable in winter, with dried mint and tiny croutons, is wholly unknown in France ; the driod green peas, termed pois cassis, only are used for similar purposes there.

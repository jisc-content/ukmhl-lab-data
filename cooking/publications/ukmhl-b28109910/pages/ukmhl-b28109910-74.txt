6o Food and Feeding. this I understand, of course, a mode of cooking supe- rior in some respects to that which the term “stewing” denotes. In hraising, the meat is just covered with a strong liquor of vegetable and animal juices (technically called braise or mirepoix) in a closely covered vessel, from which as little evaporation as possible is per- mitted, and is exposed for a considerable time to a surrounding heat just short of boiling. By this treat- ment tough fibrous flesh, even if old, whether of poultry, of cattle, or meat unduly fresh, such as it is difficult to avoid during the summer heats in towns, is made tender and easily digestible. Moreover, it becomes impregnated with the odours and flavour of fresh vegetables and sweet herbs, while the liquor itself, slowly reduced in the process, furnishes the most appropriate, fragrant, and delicious sauce, with which to surround the portion when served at table.

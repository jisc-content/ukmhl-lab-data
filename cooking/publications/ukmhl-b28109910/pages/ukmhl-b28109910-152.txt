It is unknown in France, and recognised in few of our own cookery books. A most excellent adjunct to roast mutton. Let it soak in two fresh waters, about an hour in each, to get rid of the salt ; then put it in a saucepan with some hot water, and simmer until quite soft and mucila- ginous ; dress it as spinach, with butter, or with a little stock, and a dash of lemon juice ; serve hot.

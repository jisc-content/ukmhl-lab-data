APPENDIX. PART I. ON THE POT-AU-FETJ. Pot-au-feu: Jules Gouffe’s instructions for making it—Directions given by Brillat-Savarin—The receipt of Alexandre Dumas. Jules Gouffe’s instructions for the Pot-au-feu, referred to, page 74. “ The broth (bouillon) of beef is the foundation of domestic cookery. “It constitutes the most essential and really nourishing part of our daily food, that is, good meat soup. It is, moreover, the basis of^a large number of culinary preparations such as ragouts, sauces, purges, &c. “ The chief of all broths is undeniably beef-broth, many others, of course, existing, such as those of fowl, vegetables, fish, and game. “ The production of a good pot-au-feu seems to me to be one of those operations, at the same time ele- mentary and fundamental, with which it is of the highest importance to render everyone familiar, as soon as domestic cooking is treated of.

English and French Cookery compared. 63 treatment of flesh in cookery (butcher’s meat, poultry, ancl game), which finds its place appropriately here. It may be easily recognized that two opposite prin- ciples dominate that treatment, within certain limits, and that one of these characterizes the best English cookery, while the other has been, and still is to a large extent, the ruling principle of French cookery. Both are rational—each perhaps in turn the better one in its place; and only illogical products and examples of defective taste can arise in practical cookery by confounding the two ideas, an error how- ever which is far from uncommon. In spite of the admiration which it is impossible to withhold for the talent of the French cook, it is nevertheless in France that the confusion I speak of is chiefly to be met with. And it is only in our own country, I venture to affirm, that the former of the two principles is carried out to perfection. That principle is, that our own meat and game shall be presented at table in the highest state of perfection attainable, so far as breeding, feeding, and keeping can accomplish it: each animal, when served, to be characterized by its own proper flavour, which is on no account to be masked or disguised by others, which are adventitious. Delicate additions tending to heighten the natural flavour, or agreeably subordinated to it, shall alone be admitted.

Hence an illus- tration of one of the first efforts to make a dish of rice “ complete ” is afforded by the addition of butter and a little Parmesan cheese, in the simple risotto, from which, as a starting point, improvement, both for nutritive purposes and for the demands of the palate, may be carried to any extent (see p. 93).

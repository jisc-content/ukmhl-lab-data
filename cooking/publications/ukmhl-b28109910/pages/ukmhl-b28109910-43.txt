Land Produce, and Imports. 29 to attain to longevity, should gradually diminish his use of strong nitrogenous and much fatty food. He should substitute a lighter dietary, as he subsides naturally, and more or less gradually, into the class of the sedentary, and adopts the regimen best adapted thereto, hereafter to he considered. These things being so, a consideration of no small concern arises in relation to the economical manoge- ment of the national resources. For it is a fair com- putation that every acre of land devoted to the pro- duction of meat is capable of becoming the source of three or four times the amount of produce of equivalent value as food, if devoted to the production of grain. In other words, a given area of land cropped with cereals and legumes, will support a population more than three times as numerous as that which can be sustained on the same land devoted to the growth of cattle. Moreover, the corn-land will produce, almost without extra cost, a considerable quantity of animal food, in the form of pigs and poultry, from the offal or coarser parts of vegetable produce which is unsuitable for human consumption. Thus this country purchases every year a large and increasing quantity of corn and flour from foreign countries, while more of our own land is yearly de- voted to grazing purposes. The value of corn and flour imported by Great Britain in 1877 was no less than 63,536,322/., while in 1875 it was only just over 53,000,000/. The increased import during the last thirty-two years is well exhibited in the following

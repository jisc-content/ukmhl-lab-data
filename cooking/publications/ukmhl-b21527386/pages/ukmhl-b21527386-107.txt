Creams. 103 quantity only remains—thickened, and mixed with cream. Sauce is made stronger and better by being well reduced. If you want to have good sauces, reduce them well. 13read sauce is a very great favourite in English homes. To make it, prepare about an ounce and a half of bread- crumbs by rubbing stale bread through a wire sieve. Put these in a stewpan with half a pint of milk, add a litde salt, and five or six peppercorns. Let the crumbs soak for a few minutes only, then put the stewpan on the fire, and stir the sauce till it boils. Remove the peppercorns, add a tablespoonful of cream, and serve.

For variety’s sake, a little nutmeg may be added to the sauce. When the sauce is wanted very good, the crumbs and onion, after being boiled in the milk, may be rubbed through a hair sieve.

I have, therefore, contented myself with describing as clearly as I could how the fundamental sauces, those which are the foundation of others, are made. I have one more suggestion to offer with regard to them. It is, that when delicately-prepared sauces have to be kept hot for a while, they should not be left to simmer in the saucepan, as this would spoil them ; but that, instead, the vessel in which they are should be placed in another containing hot water to the depth of four or five inches. This hot water vessel will constitute an improvised bain marie. It may be put by the side of the fire ; and here the sauce can be kept hot till wanted, without fear of its flavour being injured by overheating. XVII.

However, the best thing we can do is to speak of general rules of universal application, and urge the mem-

28 V. THE FRYING-PAN. ALWAYS look upon a frying-pan as the pet utensil of a-it incompetent cook. Those who scramble through the preparation of food, instead of cooking it intelligently, generally rely upon a frying-pan to save them from the difficulties into which their want of punctuality and fore- thought lead them. The result is that food from their hands is usually presented either burnt, greasy, or hard, very often all three, and it is nearly always indigestible. There is no method of cookery that is so popular amongst a certain class of cooks as what they call frying, and there is no process that is so little understood by them as real frying. I am going to try to explain very clearly what true frying really is, and the difference be- tween it and half frying. You will remember that when we were talking about boiling, 1 said that if meat were plunged into boiling water and boiled for about five minutes, the albumen would coagulate on the surface, and make a sort of case that would keep in the goodness of the meat. Now, frying is boiling in fat, and the cause of the difference between boiling in water and boiling in fat, is that fat can be made so very much hotter than water that the work can be done much more quickly, while at the same time a peculiar brown appearance and tasty flavour is given to the article fried. If we had a ther- mometer we should find that when w.ater is boiling it reaches 212 deg. We might make a fire large enough to roast an ox, but we should never get water hotter than that. Fat, however, can be made more than twice as hot as water, and therefore it conveys heat much more quickly. We have, I dare say, all felt what it is to be scalded with boiling water, and that is bad enough ; but the pain is trifling compared to that which we suffer when we are burned with boiling fat. And that is because hot fat is so very, very hot

PREFATORY NOTE BY SIR J. RISDON BENNETT, M.D., F.R.S. i- following pages are intended to instruct the middle 'G classes of our community in the art of Cookery, not merely for the purpose of contributing to their own health, comfort, and enjoynnent, but also to enable them to render much needed help to others, especially the poor, both in sickness and health. Neither the moral, physical, nor economic bearings of wholesome, properly-cooked food are sufficiently under- stood or appreciated by our countrymen and women. In scarcely any other country does so much prejudice and ignorance prevail on the subject of food and its employ- ment. In no more ready and efficient way can the rudiments of science be imparted than in connection with Cookery ; and-the efforts that are now being made to give instruction in Cookery in combination with Board and other elementary Schools, are a subject for sincere rejoicing with those who desire both the moral and physical welfare of the poorer classes.

53 S)iort Paste. pastry which answers excellently for pies and tarts. The following is the method adopted in making it. Take half a pound of flour, six ounces of butter, a pinch of salt, six drops of lemon-juice, and the yolk of an egg. Prepare the ingredients as for true puff paste ; that is, squeeze the butter to free it from moisture, and be sure that the flour is dry and sifted. Chop the butter in the flour with a knife ; then pile the flour on the board ; make a well in the centre, and put into it the salt, egg, yolk, and lemon- juice. Add the water gradually, and mix it in lightly with the fingers, to make a light not over stiff paste. Flour the rolling-pin and the board to prevent the pastry stick- ing, but do not put too much flour in, or the pastry will be spoilt. Roll it well three times, and after each roll fold it in two, and turn it with the rough edges to the front. If it makes a crackling sound as it is being rolled it is a sign that it is good. If liked, this pastry may be made with half a pound of flour, four ounces of butter, half a teaspoonful of baking-powder, and dripping may be used instead of butter. X. SHORT PASTE, SUET PASTE, AND RAISED PIES. Q SAID in our last lesson that the idea in puff paste is ^ to have the butter and paste separate, so that the paste shall be made up of a number of layers, divided from each other by layers of butter. In short paste, on the other hand, the idea is for the butter to be mixed with the flour by kneading, not rolling. Indeed, one great secret in making good short-crust is to roll it as little as possible. After the butter and flour have been moistened with water, the paste should be rolled once onty to make it smooth and of a good shape. Short paste is much more wholesome than puff paste. It is used chiefly for fruit pies and tartlets. It is made more easily, and is much more commonly met with than puff paste, which is usually regarded as a luxury.

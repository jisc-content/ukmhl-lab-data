IV Prefatory Note. No subject is more deserving of the attention of the zealous advocates of the cause of temperance. It is truer charity to instruct a poor woman how to make a good wholesome stew with a little oatmeal and a few odds and ends of meat and vegetables, than to give her once a week a basin of good soup ; or to teach her how to avoid absolute waste of such food as she has, than to give her a shilling or two to buy a bit of mutton. A contented Christian character and a clean hearth will do much to make home happy, and a knowledge of economic wholesome cookery will also do much to keep the men from resorts of dissipation and intemperance, and the children healthy and cheerful. But let no one imagine that it will be an easy thing to overcome the prejudice and dispel the ignorance existing amongst us respecting food and its use, a subject which has so wide and important a relation to the social welfare of the people. Let us, however, hope that this little work may do something towards making “ Our Girls ” both better housekeepers and more useful as Angels of Mercy, exemplifying the character as well as imparting the good news of “ Him who came to seek and to save the lost.” J.

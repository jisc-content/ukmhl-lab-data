Haw to Make Tea and Cojfce. 143 strength required. Thrifty housekeepers who consider strong coffee injurious, declare that a teaspoonful of coffee is sufficient for half a pint of water. Ordinary individuals will, however, in all probability prefer to drink coffee made with a heaped tablcspoonful of coffee to the half pint of water. If caj^au tail, or three parts coffee and one part milk is wanted, only half the above measure of water should be used, and the coffee (which will then be strong) should be weakened with milk, but never with water. If coffee and chicory are preferred, three tablespoonfuls of the mi.xture will be needed for a pint of water. Whatever the quantity may be, put the coffee into the coffee-pot, and pour over it the requisite measure of boil ing water.

Throw a table- spoonful of cold water into the coffee, let the pot stand by the side of the fire for three or four minutes, then strain the liquid through muslin into the heated vessel from which it is to be served, and send it at once to table.

Put the cover over the spout of the cafeti^re to keep in the steam and fra- grance ; or, if this is wanting, fill the end of the spout with soft paper to prevent their escape. Cover the cafetiere and leave it in a hot place for a few minutes, and when the coffee has drained from the upper compartment into the lower one the coffee is ready for use. There is no difficulty here, is there ? Yet here is good coffee, as good as we need desire. Mixed with sugar and scalded milk, it is caf^ au laitj when very strong, and without cither

I once saw a pie made to look very pretty by placing what the artist called “ wheatsheaves ” (that is, strips of pastry rolled up, then cut finely at one end to make them look something like wheatsheaves) at regular intervals, with leaves of pastry^ between. Of course these ornaments' had to be fastened firmly to the pie with white of egg. Raised pies must be baked in a moderate oven, because they are solid, and have to be cooked throughout.

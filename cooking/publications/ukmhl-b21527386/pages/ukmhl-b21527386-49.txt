vin. SOUFFLES. •Defore leaving puddings entirely, I think girls would be glad to know how to make the very delicious superior puddings called souffles. Souffles are troublesome, because there are so many little points about them which seem trifling, but which really must be attended to ; but these are not very difficult when one has got into the way of doing them. Anyhow, great care must be taken with them, and the directions I am about to give must be followed exactly. There must be no guess work with soufflds. If a girl is inclined to say to to herself, “ Why be so particular about small things ? I dare say they do not really signify,” her souffld will be a failure. Souffles may be either baked or steamed. When they are baked they are served in the tin in which they are cooked. In this case a frill of white paper or a folded napkin made hot is fastened round the tin, or if there is such a thing at hand the mould is put into a plated souffle dish kept for the purpose. It is not every one, however, who possesses a plated dish of this kind ; and when we have to manage without one care must be taken to have the paper trill or the folded napkin quite ready to pop over the souffld, for it must be served straight from the oven before it has time to fall, or its excellence will be gone. Many cooks have a hot salamander—or, what does just as well, a red-hot shovel—ready, and hold it over the souffld on its passage from the kitchen to the dining-room door, in order to keep it up. I should, however, recommend a girl, until she acquired a little skill in this direction, to steam the souffld instead of baking it. A steamed souffld does not sink so quickly as a baked one ; it is easier to manage also; and, in my opinion, quite as good. Also, neither souffld dish nor frill is needed for it. It is simply turned upon a hot dish,

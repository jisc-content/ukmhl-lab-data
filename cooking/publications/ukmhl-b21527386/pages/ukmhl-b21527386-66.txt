The GirTs Own Cookery Book 62 away. It is a great disgrace to English cooks that they act as though extravagance meant cleverness, and thrift meant incompetency. I have noticed again and again that as soon as ever a cook acquires skill she loses her respect for quantities and prices. We will not do this in our cookery class, for we all look upon waste as sin. Therefore, let us resolve that nothing containing nourishment shall be thrown away until it has been well stewed. We will put on one side all the trimmings, skin, bone, and fat that we can collect, and as soon as we have an opportunity we will render down the fat for frying, and will stew the rest for stock.

Perhaps also we may find that we have the bones of poultry or game, and two or three bacon bones ; if so, we should of course make use of them although we should do very well without them. How should we proceed in making stock? We should look very carefnlly over our ingredients, and trim away anything that was unsuitable for our purpose.

The Gridiron. 33 a little before pouring it through the strainer, as otherwise It may melt the metal. The impurities will always settle at the bottom of the fat after melting, and they can be easily removed. Fat that has been once used for fish is likely to have a fishy taste, therefore it should be kept exclusively for that purpose. Now, perhaps, you will feel inclined to say. Is there nothing we can fry without a large quantity of fat.? Cer- tainly there is. We fry pancakes and omelettes and slices of bacon with a small quantity of fat. Mutton chops and beefsteaks are often fried in the same way. Strictly speaking, however, this is not to fry them, but to sauter them. Chops and steaks, however, are not at their best when cooked in a frj-ing-pan. They are sure to be greasy when thus prepared, and are much better broiled over a clear fire. And of broiling I will speak at our next lesson. VI. THE GRIDIRON. is no more excellent way of cooking small ^ things than broiling them. There are all sorts of advantages connected with broiling. It is quickly done, makes meat or fish tasty, and it preserves the goodness of the meat. When it is well done it is always approved, and when it is once understood, it is not at all difficult. The only thing that we need make up our minds to about it is, that while it is going on it must be looked after and cared for. We may put meat in the oven, or hang it on the spit, or place it in a saucepan and leave it for a while ; but if we tried to attend to any other business while engaged with the gridiron, most woeful would be the result. Therefore, if you make up your minds to broil anythin? (and their is no greater delicacy than a well-broiled chop or steak), detennine that you will give your exclusive attention to it during the ten or twelve minutes that it is on the fire. D

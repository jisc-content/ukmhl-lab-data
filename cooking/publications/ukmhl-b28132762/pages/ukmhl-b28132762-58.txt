FISH. 50 HOW TO KNOW WHEN A FlSH 18 SUFFICIENTLY COOKED. —A fish is properly cooked when the meat separates easily from the bone (this can be tested with a fork at the tail end), and when the eyes drop out of the head. Fat for Frying Fish.—Good ground nut oil is certainly the best. Any fat used for frying fish can be used again several times, but for fish only. It is advisable to strain it after using, and to keep it in a glass jar, such as an empty dried fruit jar. 1 large onion. 1. Pour into your large boiler as much water as will be necessary to well cover the fish. Add the salt, peppers, the onion quartered, (if available, the vinegar, thyme and parsley.) Bring the water to a boil. 2. When boiling put in the fish, and if the fish is large and thick let it boil sharply for three or four minutes, then remove the boiler from the fire but leave it near enough for the water to continue bubbling slightly. 3. Try the fish with a fork to see if it is sufficiently cooked, raise it carefully out of the water and place on a hot dish. This dish, covered with a smaller one, can then be stood on top of the boiler near the fire in order to keep hot until the time of serving. On no account should the fish be left in the water. 4. Serve with a white sauce (see Index) mixed with capers if possible, or with a tomato sauce (see Index). Note. Instead of milk, the white sauce can be made with the water the fish has been cooked in, boiled down and strained through a sieve. Boiled Fish. (I). 3 to 4 lbs. fish. 1 tablespoonful salt. 4 native peppers (berkono). (2 tablespoonfuls vinegar, a bunch of parsley, a tea- spoonful of dried thyme.)

Egg Flip. —To make a large tumbler full, three-quarters of a pint of milk (if Ideal, two tablespoons mixed with a little less than three-quarters of a pint of water); one very fresh egg; three or four lumps sugar; one tablespoon brandy, whisky or gin. With a fork beat up the egg in a cup, then pour it into the large tumbler. Pour in the milk gradually, swizzling strongly, and, when quite frothy on top, add the sugar and brandy and swizzle once more. Lime Drink.—The Nigerian limes are delicious and make a far better drink than any bottled lime juice. It must of course be made according to taste, but it is as well to tell your boy exactly bow much sugar you like, or whole tinfuls will disappear. For a small tumbler, the juice of half a lime and two lumps of sugar ought to be sufficient. Cocktail without Egg.—Mix a tablespoon castor sugar (or four lumps crushed) with a teaspoonful of lime juice, three-and-a-half tablespoons gin, three tablespoons water and a few drops of bitters. Add a pinch of nutmeg and four or five small pieces of lime peel and swizzle well. Sherry and Pepper.—Four level tablespoons of peppers (berkono) red and green mixed, to half-a-pint, i.e, a tumbler of sherry. Look over the peppers and pick out all the bad or discoloured ones.

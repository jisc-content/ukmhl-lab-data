120 VEGETABLES. 2. Take the outside leaves off (they can be kept for soup) plunge the cabbage into your largest saucepan or native pot filled with boiling water to which you have added nearly all the salt. Let it boil for an hour. Cabbage, like spinach, must be cooked in boiling water and in an uncovered pot, it must be boiled quickly and not allowed to simmer. 3. Steam or bake two medium sized or one large sweet potato, or the piece of yam ; when cooked crush it with a fork. Take out the cabbage, carefully draining it and pressing out the water; chop it, not too finely, and mix with the sweet potatoes. 4. Put the lard or oil into the flat saucepan and when quite hot and singing put in the cabbage and potatoes, keep moving them with a fork till the fat is absorbed and they brown slightly, dust with the remaining salt and pepper whilst still frying and serve very hot. Note.â€”Stuffed eggs in batter, fried tomatoes, egg plant, cucumber fritters, fowl fritters, or fowl croquettes served on top of the cabbage make a substantial dish which is quite enough for a good lunch. Beetroot. (II). It is worth growing beetroot in Nigeria although they do not reach a very large size. Flat round Egyptian ones seem to do best. 1. Wash the beetroot but do not scrape it with a knife for the least cut lets out the red juice. Cut off the leaves carefully. Fill the saucepan with boiling water and put in the beetroot and a little salt. Boil till quite tender (this can be judged by testing with a fork). If the beetroots are large you may bake them. When done, let them cool, peel and cut in rather thin slices, toss them in a pan with a little melted butter, salt and pepper. Serve sprinkled with a little parsley.

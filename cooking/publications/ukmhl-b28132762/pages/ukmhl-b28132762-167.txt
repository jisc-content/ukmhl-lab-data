159 ODDS AND ENDS. allow two good tablespoonfuls to a small half-pint of water or the coffee will be poor. These quantities will give a breakfastcup-and-a-half of coffee. If sugar is scarce, native honey can be used to sweeten it. Black Coffee.—The best and safest way is to make it one-self. Messrs. Picard, Regent Street, sell a simple one- cup coffee machine, which is excellent, uses very little coffee, and, if the water is brought to you boiling as for tea, your coffee will always be good. Messrs. Picard have also a speciality of ground coffee, which can be sent out fresh every two or three months. If you use an ordinary coffee pot, what is generally known as the French pattern in earthenware or tin, with double strainer, is the best. Allow one dessertspoon of coffee and one coffee cup and a quarter of water for each cup. Put the coffee in the space between the two strainers. Heat the water in the small kettle and as soon as it begins to boil, pour it slowly through the top strainer on to the coffee. Not much more than a teaspoonful should be poured on at a time, and the water in the kettle should be kept boiling. It will take almost six minutes to make a cup, but the full flavour of the coffee will have been brought out. It is as well to stand the pot in a saucepan of hot water while the water is being poured on, especially if several cups are being made. Serve in the coffee pot itself. To Roast and Grind Coffee.—Coffee is much better freshly roasted, so only a little should be done at a time. It can be done in a frying pan over a good, but not too quick fire, and the berries must be moved about the whole time with a wooden spoon. They are ready when they have turned a good deep brown ; any burnt berries should be picked out and thrown away, and the good ones should be kept in a tin with tight-fitting lid. Grind only very little at a time in a small coffee mill.

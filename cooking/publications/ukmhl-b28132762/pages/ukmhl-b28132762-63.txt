55 FISH. 1. Throw the rice into a pint of boiling water and keep boiling till the rice is cooked but not mashy; this will take about twenty minutes for English rice and about eight minutes for native rice. Strain off all the water and leave the rice to dry in the colander at the door of the oven. 2. With a fork break up the fish, freed from skin and bones; break the hard-boiled egg. (If the tomato or tatassa (or both) are obtainable, cut them into small pieces, put them in the small frying pan, and turn them for a few moments over the fire with half-a-teaspoonful of butter, just to get rid of the moisture.) 3. Mix together the fish, egg, rice, salt, pepper (the fried tomato and tatassa if available). 4. Put the teaspoonful of butter, lard or ground nut oil into the flat saucepan, add the mixture and toss on a slow fire until all the fat is absorbed. This will take about five minutes, the saucepan being shaken the whole time until the mixture is perfectly dry. Serve very hot. Fish au Gratin. (II). 4 or 5 fillets of freshly boiled fish. 1 teacupful white sauce (see index.) A pinch of salt and pepper. 1 tablespoonful oreadcrumbs or crushed biscuit. 1 teaspoonful butter or lard. 1 teaspoonful chopped pars- ley and the same of finely chopped onion. 1. Divide the boiled fish into fillets as if for frying. Grease a pie dish, sprinkle the chopped parsley and onion at the bottom, lay in the fillets dusted with the salt and pepper, pour over the white sauce (if you have any leftover from the day before, it will do quite well) and cover with the breadcrumbs. Put the butter in three little dabs on top. 2. Bake in the oven for seven or eight minutes and serve when it is a good brown colour. Note. If you have any cheese, a tablespoonful of it grated and added to the white sauce is a great improvement. Fish au gratin makes a nice change from plain boiled fish.

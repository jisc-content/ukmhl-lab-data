54 FISH. 2. Put the oil into the flat saucepan and set it to heat over a good fire, watching it from time to time to see that it does not burn. 3. Break the second egg into a soup plate and beat it slightly. Spread the flour over one half of the cook’s board and the bread crumbs over the other; turn the cakes first in the flour, then in the egg, and lastly in the bread crumbs, pressing them well into the latter so that the crumbs adhere evenly to both sides of the cakes. 4. By this time the fat should be ready for frying; when it has ceased to bubble, carefully slide in the cakes, which should be covered by the fat. Turn them over as soon as they are yellow, and take them out when pale brown. Serve very hot; a good tomato sauce (see Index) improves them. Note. These cakes can be prepared some time in advance and set aside between two plates to keep them from drying, but they should not be fried before the time to serve. This is the best way of using any muddy tasting fish. Fish Pie.

32 Transplant with great care so as not to break any of the fibres. If cool and cloudy weather no shade necessary. Hoe frequently. CARROTS (Demi Longues de Lucques).—Sow in open ground, in light soil, rich in decayed leaves. No manure. Sow in lines twelve inohes apart. Thin out at intervals; even quite young carrots not much thicker than a pencil give a good flavour to soup and stews. No shade necessary. TURNIPS (Marteau).—Sow like carrots but more lightly. Thin out when they begin to develop till they are six inches apart. Require much water at first; if ground suitable will grow quickly but should be eaten young or become rather stringy. Sow at intervals of three weeks. No shade required.

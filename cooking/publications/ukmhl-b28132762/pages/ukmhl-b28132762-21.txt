13 One cook’s knife. One wooden spoon. One ordinary knife, fork and spoon. One meat board and chopper. One tin opener. One small knife board. Two pudding dishes, half and one pint, in white enamel. Two one-lb. bread tins. One baking tin. Two pudding basins, half pint and one pint. Two large sparklet bottles (with spare tubes and parts) will also be required but these had better be carried separ- ately. Two enamel basins for washing up, one for the cook and a larger one for the boy, can be bought from the Niger Company. When starting on trek, as few utensils as possible should be taken; every native knows how to make excellent ovens with a large native pot sunk in the ground and should always be able to give good roasts and good bread. If no native pot is available the cook’s basin turned upside down, half buried in sand and covered with fire, will make an oven fit for baking bread. The man who lives in a station will probably have a small brick kitchen containing a diminutive range but little else. A shelf made from an old packing case will have to be put up to serve as a table and some nails will be wanted on which to hang the saucepans; this is important as otherwise they usually find their dwelling place on the muddy floor. The same arrangement can be made in the mud hut which serves as a kitchen in the bush. In addition to the absolutely necessary kitchen utensils required on the journey up country or on tour, we would suggest— One two-pint Kenrick enamel saucepan. One four-pint Kenrick enamel stew pan. One Wellbank boilerette or a double boiler. *One fish kettle, for fish, vegetables or a ham.

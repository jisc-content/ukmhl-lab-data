166 ODDS AND ENDS. Arrowroot.—One dessertspoon arrowroot, one teacup milk (if Ideal, one large dessertspoon to the rest of water), two lumps sugar. Mix the arrowroot to a paste in a cup with two dessert- spoons cold milk. Put the remaining milk and the sugar in the small enamel saucepan. When boiling, pour it on to the paste and stir. The arrowroot can then be returned to the saucepan, brought to the boil and allowed to simmer for two minutes, but this is not necessary. Arrowroot can be made with water if no milk is available. Cornflour.—The same proportions and made in the same way as arrowroot, but in this case it is necessary to return the cornflour to the saucepan for an extra boil. Chicken Jelly.—Make a chicken broth (see index) with one whole fowl and the carcase and trimmings of another if available; use the same amount of water but omit the onion and use very little pepper. A few carrots and parsley can be added. Let the broth boil down to nearly half a pint, then strain it through a cloth. Let it stand for a short time and strain again. Put it back again in the empty saucepan, add a quarter teaspoon Lemco, heat to nearly boiling point and then dissolve in it two- and-a-half leaves of gelatine. When dissolved strain again into a cup, cover it carefully and stand it in a cooler. If the jelly has been made in the evening, it will be firm by next morning.

When well mixed, add the juice of half a lime, a little peel and four or five lumps of sugar, according to taste. Pour on a pint boiling water, drink hot or cold. If liked, some milk can be added just before drinking. Barley Water with ordinary Barley.—Well wash two good handfuls of barley. Put it in a saucepan with

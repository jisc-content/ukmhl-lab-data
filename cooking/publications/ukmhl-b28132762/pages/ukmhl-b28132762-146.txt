SWEETS. 138 3. Put the pie in the oven and bake for about half an hour. Serve hot or cold with small glasses of custard (see index) if liked. Note.—An apple tart can be made in exactly the same way, using a square of dried Prevet apples. They should, of course, not be passed through the sieve before putting them in the pie-dish. Bottled fruit to be used in a tart must always simmer with a little added sugar for about half an hour before putting it in the pie dish. Glasses of custard served with any fruit tart are always an improvement. Fruit Salad. (I). Whenever possible, keep the tin of fruit in a cooler over- night. Empty the contents into a glass dish an hour or two before serving, add to them two good tablespoons gin, or kirsch, or brandy, and a little crushed sugar. Stand till required in a cool place. Two different kinds of fruit, plums and apricots, or pears and peaches, make a good salad which can be further improved by adding some slices of preserved ginger. Best of all is a salad made of one tin of fruit mixed with fresh pine apple, or bananas, or oranges if obtainable. ♦ee*

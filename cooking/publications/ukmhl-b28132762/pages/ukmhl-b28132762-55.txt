SOUPS. 47 5. Just before serving put in half a teaspoon fresh butter if available. Some finely chopped parsley added to the soup is an improvement, as are fried dices of bread. Note.—This soup can be made without either stock or milk if necessary. Fresh beans can be used instead of dried ; they require no soaking. Dried Pea Soup. (I). Small £ teacup dried peas. 1 breakfast cup stock or milk. 14 pints water. 1 large onion stuck with one clove. 2 berkonos, or a pinch of black pepper. 1 pinch of salt. 1. Put the peas to soak over-night in enough water to cover them. At 3 p.m., if the soup is required for dinner, put the peas into the two-pint saucepan together with the onion cut in quarters, the salt and pepper. Pour over one and a half pints water and bring it to the boil. When it is boiling put the saucepan aside, letting the contents continue to simmer till half an hour before dinner. The peas will then be like a thick puree. 2. Pass the peas through a sieve taking care to keep the water that drains from them. 3. Return the puree and water to the saucepan adding to them a breakfast cup of stock or boiled milk, let it simmer together. When ready to be served, the consistency must be that of thick cream, if too thin let it boil down a little, if too thick add a little more stock, milk or water. Serve plain or with a little dried mint, or a little fresh minced ham, or small dices of fried bread. Lentil Soup. (I). Small half tea-cup dried lentils 1 breakfast cup stock or milk lj pints water. 1 large onion 2 berkonos or a pinoh of black pepper. 1 teaspoon salt. Proceed exactly as for pea soup, soaking the lentils over- night. Lentils require an hour less cooking than peas.

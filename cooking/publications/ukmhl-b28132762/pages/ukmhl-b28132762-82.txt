74 FOWLS. Other Birds.—Pigeons killed in the evening must be eaten for breakfast or lunch; if wanted for dinner they must be killed in the morning. Guinea fowl and bush fowl killed in the evening must also generally be eateD for lunch next day, though it is possible to keep them till evening by turning them in a little hot lard about mid-day. Turkeys can be killed about four p.m., hung in a cool place, plucked and cleaned very early the following morning, and eaten in the evening. Fowls or any other birds killed in the morning and which are to be eaten for dinner should be wrapped in a paw paw leaf to make them tender. How to Truss a Fowl.—Correct trussing, necessitating various skewers and bits of string, is generally beyond the resources of an African kitchen, but the cook should be taught to neatly cut off the bird’s feet, the pinions, the neck close to its base, and to then bring the joints back close to the body of the fowl. The trimmings and the gizzard must always be kept for making stock. In all the recipes given for making up the remains of cold fowl, the remains of a turkey can be substituted for the fowl. We have given the recipe for a pie at some length as it is a very good one and a nice cold dish comes in so useful. Roast Fowl or Guinea Fowl.

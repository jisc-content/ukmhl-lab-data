20 NATIVE PRODUCTS. On first arriving in Nigeria, it would seem as if meat, fowls and eggs represented the whole extent of local resources. A few months in the country will show you that much else can be obtained but it must always be asked for. The native will never bring anything to the white man on his own initiative, not from any ill-feeling, but because he thinks it “ no be fit for white man.” The Accra cook will, of course, especially affect to despise anything native! You must show that you know what the local products are and when they can be had, and if you insist sufficiently, they will soon be obtained. For the assistance of the newcomer, we give what we fear is a quite incomplete and sometimes inaccurate list of native grains and vegetables, and the best ways of using them. We include remarks on native milk, butter, etc., etc.; meat and poultry will be treated separately at the head of the various chapters in which they are dealt with. WHEAT (alkama).—Especially grown in the north, but found in Bauchi and around Wase. Makes excellent bread on condition that it is carefully ground and kept free from the dust of the Harmattan. The bread can be made wholly from Alkama flour, or mixed with an equal quantity of European flour. It makes, also, delicious pancakes. If one is certain of going to a province where wheat is easily obtainable, it would be worth while to take out a small handmill and to make all one’s bread with Alkama flour, thus greatly reducing the bulk of one’s European stores. GUINEA COEN (dawa).—The flour can be used for making porridge. A taste for it can be acquired in time.

PREFACE. AN APOLOGY TO EVERY NIGERIAN READER. We left the writing of the preface to the end, thinking that once the word “ Einis ” had been written, it would take but a moment to pour out the paean of praise and self laudation to which we thought ourselves entitled. Alas, it is with no 9uch feelings that we turn back, but rather with humble mindedness and much misgiving. It is true that personal experience has bought all our know- ledge and that we entered into the work with no light spirit, but we have weighed and pondered every cup or spoonful as if it were the measure of gold and precious stones. Yet the satisfaction of certainty is lacking, the comfortable assertion of indisputable truth. Proportions, times, ingre- dients all mingle and fade and waver in tbe sunshine and once more Nigeria triumphs over logic, and smiles at common sense. Yet do not wholly condemn us for our errors but judge charitably,—for the sake of intentions so sincere. The needs of Northern Nigeria were those we had at heart when compiling this book, but it is hoped that it will apply equally well to other Colonies in West and East Africa. The main object in view was to enable the white man to obtain that well cooked and varied food so essential to health, and to facilitate economy by making every possible use of native foodstuffs, and by showing bow to minimise wastage of material on the part of the native cook.

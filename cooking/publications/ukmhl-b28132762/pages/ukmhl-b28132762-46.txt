SOUPS. 38 3. Put the pot on the range as far as possible from the fire with just enough heat to keep it simmering. If on a native fire keep several large pieces of wood just burning so as to give out a slow and equal heat. Let it cook thus for at least a good hour, then pour the soup through the sieve and serve. Notes. After the second boiling point has been reached, pick out the legs and wings with a fork, cut off the best portions of the meat and return the bones to the pot. This meat can be cut into small squares and put back in the soup after it has been strained, together with squares of the carrots and turnips. If not served in the soup, the meat can be used for cro- quettes, cottage pie, salad, or for the stuffing of tomatoes, etc. A nice addition to the soup if it is served without meat is two or three thin slices of bread put in the tureen with the vegetables, or in the soup plate before pouring over the soup. Chicken Soup or Stock. (I). All the trimmings, liver, gizzard, and any bones of a fowl. 1 pint water. 1 large onion stuck with a clove. I teaspoon salt. 1 native pepper (berkono) or a pinch of black pepper. 3 carrots, 2 turnips and a bunch of parsley if avail- able. Even the trimmings of a fowl with the addition of vegetables or even only an onion will make a good plate of soup if thickened with rice, tapioca, or yolks of eggs (see Index). This chicken soup is also what we have called “ stock ” in the following recipes, and have used as a base for vegetable soups, stews and sauces. Unless you want a real chicken broth, never allow your cook a whole fowl for making soup; if each time a fowl is killed for roasting, boiling, etc., he keeps the trimmings and uses them as directed, he will have enough stock on hand for the making of his day’s soup, stew or sauce.

22 SWEET POTATOES (dankali).—They can be usually obtained except in May and June. When they are quite fresh, just out of the ground, they should be laid in the sun for a day, they will then keep much better. Keep them in a dry place. TUMUKTJ.—A small tuber which cannot always be obtained but is worth while looking for. Fried, or mixed in a stew it makes an excellent vegetable rather resembling new potatoes. EIZGA.—A small tuber obtainable at the end of the rains and right through the dry season. CASSAVA (rogo).—It can be got everywhere and can take the place of yams or sweet potatoes. The very young leaves can be used as spinach if no other green vegetable can be found, or as a salad. Cassava dried, ground finely with a bottle and put in the oven just long enough to turn light brown, makes a very good tapioca. DUYx\N BISSA.—A creeper with an edible fruit about the size of a potato, and can be used as such. BEANS.—“ Wake” is the name of the ordinary bean, but the “ Waken bissa,” or climbing bean is much superior and exactly resembles the “haricot de soissons.” It is very good either fresh or dried and can be kept for a long time so it is wise to lay in a provision. It can be used for making soup, and is a useful vegetable during the dry season when everything else is scarce. ONIONS (albassa)—As these become very expensive during the rains, it is better to buy a supply of them during the dry season and keep them spread out on a layer of sand, taking care not to let them touch each other. Young onions can be had during the rains and are very good in a salad, or the green sprouts give an added ilavoui to soups and stews. In the north a kind of garlic can also be found, rather less strong than the European garlic.

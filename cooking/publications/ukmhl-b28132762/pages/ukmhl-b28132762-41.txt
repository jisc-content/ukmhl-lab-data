33 SUGGESTIONS FOR MENUS. In the following recipes we have endeavoured to suppress nearly all tinned foods and to encourage the utilisation of rice, macaroni, eggs and especially fresh vegetables. In the menus suggested for the use of a man alone in the bush, we have supposed that he has neither even beef, mutton nor game and the one course of fresh fish included could be replaced by a tin of salmon. On those days when meat or fish is obtainable, he must remember to make out his menu so as to take full advantage of these resources and it is always advisable to try to com- bine a lunch of eggs, rice, stuffed vegetables, etc., so that the inevitable fowl appears but once a day. BREAKFASTS. Quaker oats porridge. Fried fish or fish pie, with \ tin salmon. Devilled fowl (remains of poulet menagere) Maize pancakes with honey. Maize porridge. Buttered eggs. Maize cakes with honey. Cottage pie (with remains of roast fowl.) LUNCHEONS. Rice and Tomatoes. Curried fish or remaining salmon with mayonnaise. Tapioca pudding. Stuffed eggs in batter. Vegetable curry or potato salad. Baked custard. Macaroni and cheese. Stuffed tomatoes or egg plant. Paw paw tart. Stuffed eggs with mustard and cress. Egg plant fritters with mashed yam and cabbage.

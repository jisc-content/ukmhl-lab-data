MUTTON AND BEEF. 95 Mutton or beef should only be wrapped in paw paw leaves if you have been obliged to kill it in the morning to eat the same day. The leaves make it tender but hasten decomposition. Beef should be kept and treated in the same way as mutton. The greatest care should be taken that the meat is sound. The amount of time required to cook meat can only be quite approximate, depending upon the size of the piece and the kind of fire. Twenty minutes to the pound is the average time required. A kitchen chopper and a small kitchen saw are indispens- able if you want to have neat joints. Roast Leg of Mutton. (I). A leg of mutton. 1 bit garlic or Â£ onion stuck 2 tablespoons butter or lard. in the upper part of the leg. 1 tablespoon water. j 1 teaspoon salt. ; 1 teaspoon pepper. 1. Trim the leg by cutting off any loose pieces of skin and scraping off the flesh and skin that adheres to the lower end of the bone for at least an inch. Lay the leg flat on the table and beat it into shape with the flat side of the chopper. This will also break the fibres and make the meat more tender; care must be taken not to break the bone. 2. Rub the leg with a little of the butter, melt the remainder in the baking tin, put in the leg and place the tin in a good oven. Baste it from time to time, add one tablespoon of water and a little more butter or lard if the fat dries up and sprinkle with salt and pepper. In a good oven a Nigerian leg of mutton will take less than an hour to cook. Roast Saddle. (I). Cut off the end of the saddle, keeping only the best middle part, t.e., about six good chops. With a knife, trim off the skinny edge of the flap. Divide the chine bone

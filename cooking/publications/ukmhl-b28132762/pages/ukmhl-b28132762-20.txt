It is best not to touch your provision boxes during the journey up country but to take out one or two specially made up “ chop boxes containing all that is necessary in the way of food for as many days as you require. Fresh provisions can be bought off the steamer and as they are often both dear and scarce on the way up river, it is as well to take eggs, bread, potatoes and some bacon or ham. It is advisable to have those loads which you want to use on the river journey, including the oook’s box of which we speak later, dearly marked with a coloured band or some other distinguishing sign, so as to be able to recognise them easily as they come out of the chaos of the steamer’s hold.

It should be strong and contain, besides the usual fittings, two enamel dishes on which to serve the meat and vege- tables, two small tablecloths, three napkins and half a dozen cloths to be given out to the cook on the way. All kitchen utensils should be packed in a strong wooden “ cook’s box,” fitted with padlock and key so that they can be safely left in storage at Burutu when going home. The box must not be too heavy, and the size of a man’s load. The contents should consist of— One large iron kettle about eight pints. One small kettle, three pints. One frying pan. One iron Kenrick saucepan, three pints, fitted with cover. One iron Kenrick saucepan, five pints, ,. One stew pan Kenrick, six or seven pints, ,. One colander to fit the five piut saucepan. One grill (light),

139 SAUCES. Sauces.—The proper amalgamation and cooking of the flour and butter and the right degree of colour (pale yellow for a white sauce, deep brown for a brown one), at the moment when the milk, stock or water is poured in, is the whole secret of sauce making. Once the cook has mastered it, the number of varied sauces he can produce becomes only a question of different seasonings and extra ingredients. The proportions given in the following recipes will make a teacupful of sauce; if more is wanted, double the pro- portions. The quantity of butter required will vary according to the amount of moisture left in it after it has been washed; only boiled native butter is free from water. We have given the average quantity required, but the cook must use bis judgment. White Sauce. (I). 1 teacup milk, or 1 dessert- spoon Ideal to a teacupful of water. £ tablespoon flour. £ tablespoon butter or lard. A pinch of salt and pepper. 1. Melt the butter in the small enamel saucepan. When it is melted and just begins to sing, but before it turns at all brown, very lightly shake in the flour. Stir quickly with a wooden spoon until the flour and the butter are mixed to a smooth paste, looking like honey. 2. Pour in the milk by degrees, stirring all the time. It is good to warm the milk slightly beforehand by standing it near the fire. Add the salt and pepper and let the sauce come slowly to a boil. Keep boiling for two or three minutes, always stirring it, then stand it by the side of the fire to keep warm, but do not let it boil again.

37 SOUPS. steam can escape, and the cook should be induced to take off all the scum as it rises before the first boiling point has been reached. The proportion of water to Nigerian meat should be about three pints to 2-lb. meat, or to l^-lb. meat and £-lb. bones. The quantities given in the following recipes are sufficient to make two good platefuls of soup. Soup is much better if made in rather large quantities, and can always be heated up again. If the soup is not all finished at dinner, the remainder can be kept till the following lunch, though it is safer to give a short boil in the morning in very hot weather. A native cooking pot with a lid is almost better than a saucepan for making soups, on condition that it is kept absolutely clean and scalded out with boiling water each time after use. Chicken Broth. (1). 1 fowl, old and skinny and freshly killed, if nothing better can be had. l£ pints water. 1 onion stuck with one clove. 1 teaspoon salt. 1 native pepper (berkono) or a pinch of black pepper. A pinch of nutmeg. (3 large carrots, 3 large tur- nips and a bunch of parsley if available). 1. Clean the fowl, cut off the wings and legs and break its carcase into four pieces. Put it all into the large saucepan or native pot, together with the neck, feet, the salt and pepper. Pour over the cold water and set it on a slow fire. With a spoon remove the scum as it rises to the top and throw it away. Keep the fire low so as to keep the pot from boiling as long as you can. If the soup is in a saucepan it should take about twenty minutes, or half an hour if in a native pot. 2. As soon as it boils throw in the onion, the berkono and the nutmeg (and the parsley, carrots and turnips split in four pieces). Throwing in the vegetables will stop the boiling, watch it till it boils again, then put on the lid a little sideways so that the steam can escape. c

SOUPS. 41 salt, barley, (the carrots and turnips split in two, the bunch of parsley, the dried thyme). Throwing in the vegetables will stop the boiling, watch it till it boils again, then put on the lid a little sideways so that the steam can escape. 3. Put the pot on the range with just enough heat to keep it simmering. If on a native fire keep several large pieces of wood just burning so as to give out a slow and equal heat. Let it simmer thus for at least two good hours. Do not strain the broth but carefully pick out the bones. Cut the best parts of the meat in squares about half-an-inch large, also the carrots and turnips, place them in the soup and serve very hot. Note. If barley is not available, rice will do very well. A tablespoonful of English rice to be put in the soup half- an-hour before serving. If native rice is used, only a quarter of an hour before serving. White Soup. (II). 1 pint hot stock. 1 undiluted teaspoon Ideal milk. 2 yolks of eggs. 1. Break the eggs, separating the yolk from the white. This is done by holding the egg in the right hand and cracking it gently against the edge of a plate nearly all round the middle, then take it in both hands and break it open in the middle, holding it close over a plate. Do not let the yolk fall out but pour out the white on the plate, sliding the yolk from one half shell to the other. When the yolk is quite separated from the white, drop it into the enamel saucepan, and do the same thing for the second egg. 2. Mix the eggs with the milk, add a tablespoon of soup not too hot, stir well, add another spoonful, stir again and then pour on the rest of the soup. The soup should be very hot but not boiling, or it will set the eggs. If rice or tapioca is liked, a small tablespoonful can be boiled for twenty minutes in the stock before mixing it with the eggs and milk.

VI. The recipes, nearly all French ones, adapted to Nigerian needs, contain what would often appear absolute heresies to the home cook, but each one has been repeatedly tested and only written down when proved a success. All ingredients not absolutely necessary are in brackets, both in the list at the head of each recipe and in the body of the recipe itself. The Roman numbers I. and II. indicate the degree of difficulty ; those marked II should not be attempted until the I’s have been mastered. The vexed question of stock makes an added difficulty in African cookery. As repeated later on, the home stock- pot, simmering indefinitely on the fire, is an impossibility in Nigeria, and the “ stock ” we refer to in many recipes is in reality a soup made daily from the trimmings and bones of fowls or meat. We describe the method under “ Chicken Soup or Stock,” in the chapter on Soaps. Our best thanks are due to Mr. E. A. Brackenbury for his kind revision of the proofs. Zungeru. 1908. 1hi, 1910.

FOWLS. 82 2. Put the palm oil in a native pot with a lid, when quite hot put in the onion and fowl, frying till a pale yellow, then add the water, okro, tatassa, gauta, chopped berkono and salt. Bring it to the boil, let it simmer for a short hour, then add the yam and continue boiling for twenty five to thirty minutes. If sweet potatoes are used, twenty minutes will be enough. Serve very hot in the native pot with a napkin folded round. Note.—There are many ways of making palm oil chop; this recipe is a mild one, the fresher the palm oil the better the dish is. Natives mix dried fish with the palm oil chop, but this is not much to the European taste. Exactly the same dish can be made with pieces of mut- ton, cut in two-inch squares. Curried 1 fowl. 1 dessertspoon curry. 1 large tablespoon butter, lard, or ground nut oil. Fowl. (I). 1 onion. 1 teacup stock or water. ; £ teaspoon salt 1. Cut the raw fowl as for a fricassee. 2. Put the butter in the flat saucepan. When quite hot, add the sliced onion, then the curry powder, fry till brown; add the pieces of fowl and fry to a deep yellow colour, then add salt and the teacup of stock or water. Let the curry cook slowly until half the liquid is absorbed. Serve with rice or mashed yam or sweet potatoes. Notes. 1. If the tomatoes or gauta are available they can be cut in quarters and added to the curry when the meat is half cooked. 2. Pigeons can be curried in the same way. 3. This is the very simplest of curries; there are many other good ones, but the ingredients not always being obtainable, we have not attempted to give them.

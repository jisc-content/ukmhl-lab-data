121 VEGETABLES. Noth.—Cold beetroot sliced makes a very good salad mixed with sliced sweet potatoes. Beetroots thinly sliced and put in enough vinegar to cover them, adding a pinch of sugar, keep for two or three days and are nice as a condiment, but the vinegar must well cover them. Seasoned in the same manner and bottled in a glass jnr they keep quite a long time. French Beans. (I). Gather the beans when not too old. Be careful that the cook takes away the stringy part before cooking them, by nipping off the ends and tearing away the little strings down the sides of the bean. 1. Put the beans in boiling, salted water, keep boiling for about fifteen minutes, test them ; if soft, take them out and drain them. 2. To a breakfast cup of beans put in a saucepan a tea- spoon butter. Melt it, add the beans, toss them about two minutes over a slow fire, A few drops of lime or vinegar are an improvement. Note.—The water in which the beans have been cooked can be used as stock for soups. Tinned Vegetables, (I). The usual way of heating up tinned vegetables by simply plunging the tin into boiling water is not a good one. It is much better to persuade the cook to open the tin, drain off the liquid and to put the vegetables in the small sauce- pan with half a teaspoon butter, a pinch of salt and pepper, (a pinch of mint and sugar, if the vegetables are green peas) and a little minced parsley if obtainable. Stand this small saucepan inside a larger one containing boiling water and let the outer vessel boil freely until the contents of the inner one are thoroughly hot. French beans and green peas of a good brand and treated in this way are really nearly as good as fresh ones.

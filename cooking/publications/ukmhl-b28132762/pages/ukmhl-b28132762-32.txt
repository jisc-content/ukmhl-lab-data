24 PINEAPPLES.—The cultivation of these seems to be slowly extending northward and already good specimens are grown in Lokoja. MANGOES.—These grow more especially in the southern provinces but will soon be found everywhere. They can be utilized as compote and preserves. BANANAS (ayaba)—Not very good as a rule and always over ripe when brought for sale. For their use, see Fritters, etc. Plantains are also obtainable on the way up river. LIMES (lemu).—These are plentiful nearly all the year and make most delicious lime drinks. PAW PAW (gwanda).—When ripe (during the dry season) this is an excellent fruit to be eaten fresh with a little sugar and lime juice. While still unripe it is invalu- able as a vegetable, or stewed, etc. DATES (dabino).—These can be bought, dried, in the more northern towns. They should be washed, folded in a wet napkin and kept between two plates for two or three days, when they will be almost as good as fresh ones. They are also very nice stewed in milk. COFFEE.—Good coffee is grown at Onitsha and can be bought there on the way up river. NATIVE HONEY (zumma).—At first sight one is apt to despise native honey as it certainty does not present au attractive appearance, but once cleared it is as good as any English honey, and is especially excellent with maize porridge or cakes, and with pancakes. It cau also be used to sweeten tea and coffee if sugar is running short. To clear it, the honey should be strained through a clean cloth (towel or handkerchief), then boiled and kept boiling for a good quarter of an hour. It can then be poured out of the saucepan, leaving the sediment, aud strained once more into any old glass jar. Well stoppered it will keep for any length of time.

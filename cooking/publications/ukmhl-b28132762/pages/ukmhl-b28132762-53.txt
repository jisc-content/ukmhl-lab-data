SOUPS. 45 Cabbage Soup. (II). 1 middle-sized head of cab- bage or 2 small ones. 1 large onion stuck -with 2 cloves. A breakfast cupful of yam, cut in pieces about two inches square. 6 or 7 pints of water. 2 tablespoons native butter or lard. 3 teaspoons salt. 2 berkono or half a teaspoon black pepper. 4 turnips, 5 carrots a bunch of parsley if obtainable. 1. Split the cabbage in half, wash it well and let it stand in cold salted water. This is important to bring out the slugs. Halve the onions, peel the yam (carrots and turnips) and cut them in small pieces. 2. Melt the butter in a large native pot or your largest saucepan. When it begins to sing throw in the yam, carrots, turnips and onion. Fry them very slightly over a small fire until they are just turning yellow, taking care they do not burn. Then pour on the water by degrees, and add the salt, pepper (and bunch of parsley). Let the pot boil up, then set it a little aside and let it go on cooking very slowly for two hours. By that time the water is greatly reduoed, add a pint or more of hot water. Wait till it has fully come to the boil again and then throw in the cabbage. Keep boiling for twenty minutes, then set aside and simmer for an hour and a half. 3. Put five or six thin slices of bread in the soup tureen, pour half of the soup through the sieve straight on to the bread and add a few pieces of vegetable and cabbage taken out of the pot. Let it stand a minute or two and then serve. Note.—The remaining soup can be passed through the sieve and heated up for next meal and the vegetables can make a very good little dish by frying them in a dessert- spoonful of lard, or serving them “ nature ” with a little fresh butter melting on top,

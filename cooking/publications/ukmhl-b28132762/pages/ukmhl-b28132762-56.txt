Gener- ally Lemco is simply put into the cup and boiling water poured over it, but it is greatly improved by putting a tea- spoon of Lemco into the small enamel saucepan, adding a breakfast cup of hot water, bringing it to the boil and letting it boil slowly for three or four minutes adding a little salt and pepper. These are the proportions for a cup of beef tea for an invalid, but if only stock is wanted, to use with dried “Julienne” or to add to a sauce, half a teaspoon of Lemco to a breakfast cup of water is sufficient.

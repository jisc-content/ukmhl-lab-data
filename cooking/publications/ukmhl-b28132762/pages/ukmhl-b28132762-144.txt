SWEETS. 136 If the plums are not of the best quality, they should be soaked for an hour in cold water before stewing them. The same remark applies to figs. Stewed Figs. (I). Dried figs can be cooked in the same way but without the addition of claret. They can be served cold with custard. Stewed Prevet Apples. (I). Half a tablet of dried apple. 1 clove. 1 teacup water. A little lime peel. 2 teaspoons sugar. 1. Break the half tablet into small pieces and soak for an hour in cold water. The soaking is not an absolute necessity. 2. Drain the apples and put them iu the small enamel saucepan with the cold water, sugar, clove and litne peel. Put it on a slow fire and as soon as it boils, set it aside so that it goes on cooking very slowly till the apples are quite soft and have absorbed nearly all the water. Serve hot or cold. Note.â€”If preferred, the apples, when soft, can be passed through the sieve and served in a puree. All other Prevet fruits are prepared in the same way, except that they must never be passed through a sieve. They must always cook very slowly. Paw Paw Compote. (1). 1 quite unripe paw paw.

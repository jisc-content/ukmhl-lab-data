SOUPS. 42 Rice Soup. (1). Â£ pint of stock. 1 small dessertspoon of rice. Wash the rice, put it into the boiling stock. For English rice boil twenty minutes, for native rice eight minutes. Tapioca Soup. (I). 4 pint stock. 1 small dessertspoon tapioca. Put the tapioca into the boiling stock and boil for fifteen minutes. The tapioca must be sprinkled lightly into the stock. If the grains are stuck together, crush them with a bottle before sprinkling them in the stock, otherwise the soup will be lumpy. When thoroughly cooked, the tapioca should look quite transparent. Tomato Soup. (1). 5 or 6 large tomatoes or 10 small ones. 1 pint water. 1 large onion or 2 small ones. 1 small teaspoon sugar. 1 teaspoon salt. 1 berkono or a pinch of black pepper. 1 teacup hot stock or milk (if Ideal, 1 tablespoon to a teacup of water). (A little dried thyme or a bunch of parsley.) 1. Wash the tomatoes, cut them in quarters, also the onion, and put them in the two-pint saucepan with the salt, pepper, sugar (and thyme or parsley). Pour on the cold water and set on a slow fire; when it has reached boiling point, set it a little aside and cook very slowly for an hour and a half, when the soup should be like a thick pur6e. 2. Five minutes before serving, strain the soup through the sieve, return it to the saucepan and add the hot stock or milk. If you add stock, the soup may boil again for two or three minutes, but if you add milk it should have been boiled beforehand, or it might be curdled by the tomatoes, and the soup should not be allowed to boil again. Two tablespoons fried dices of bread passed round with the soup are an improvement.

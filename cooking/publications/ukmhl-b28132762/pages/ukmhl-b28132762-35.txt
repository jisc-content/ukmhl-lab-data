27 FOWLS (kaza, p1. kaji).—The perilous youth of an African fowl leaves upon it an indelible impression. In an endless effort to escape, its body becomes all out-stretched neck and flying legs, petrified into an attitude of fear. Wild-eyed, shrill-voiced, neither oomfort nor security can change its haggard look, but regular feeding and restrained activity may perhaps do a little towards improving the for- lornness of its aspect. Buy the largest fowls you can find, feed them on mixed millet and maize and as much “ doussa as possible, give them plenty of clean water and shut them in every night out of reach of bush cats. Except in some favoured localities, only the bravest will attempt to rear chickens, for what between cats, rats, hawks, sundry horrible diseases and the incredible stupidity of the African hen, it is a most melancholy task. The only chance of success lies in keeping them shut up in an enclosure of wire netting (which must be brought out from England), or of roughly woven native mats, till they have attained the age of reason. If you rear ducklings do not forget to give them a large native pot sunk in the ground of their enclosure and regularly filled with water. TURKEYS (talatalo).—Quite good turkeys are fairly numerous in the north, and Loko on the Benue sells a great number of them. GUINEA FOWLS (zabuwa, pl. zabx), and BUSH FOWLS (fakara), are generally plentiful. PIGEONS (tantabara).—These are really only good when quite young and are best cooked in a pie. The “ green pigeons ” are delicious and are best roasted. FRUIT.—We do not give the names of any of the wild fruits found in the bush as they vary in each locality.

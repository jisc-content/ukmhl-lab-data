Break the second egg into a soup plate and beat it well. Spread the flour over one half of the cook’s board and the bread crumbs over the other; turn the croquettes first in the flour, then in the egg and lastly in the bread crumbs, pressing them well into the latter so that the crumbs adhere evenly to both sides of the croquettes. 4. By this time the fat should be ready for frying, when it has ceased to bubble, carefully slide in the croquettes which should be covered by the fat, Turn them over as soon as they are yellow, and take them out when light brown. If they come out greasy, it is because the fat was not hot enough. Note.—These croquettes can also be made with minced mutton or beef. If necessary, they can be made without eggs or bread crumbs, adding a dessertspoon stock and a pinch of flour to the paste, and rolling them in flour only before frying. If used to make an entree for a dinner party they can be dished on mashed yam or sweet potatoes or tinned peas, or passed with a little tomato sauce. 1 tablespoon bread crumbs. 1 tablespoon flour. 1 breakfastcup ground nut oil.

Do not mince it but lay the wings and breast on a board and cut with a sharp knife. 2. Have ready a small teacup of white sauce (see index) which has been allowed to simmer a little longer than usual so as to thicken it. Mix it very gently in a pudding- basin with the pieces of fowl. When well mixed, spread on a plate which has been slightly greased with butter, and let it stand for nearly an hour till quite cold.

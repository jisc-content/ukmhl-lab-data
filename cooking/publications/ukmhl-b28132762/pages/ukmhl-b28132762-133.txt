125 SWEETS. So many extra ingredients and utensils are needed for the making of sweets that we have been obliged to give only the plainest and most ordinary ones. We do not even give a boiled pudding, knowing the doubtful condition of the necessary pudding cloth. Quite a number of dishes can be made with Brown and Poison’s excellent cornflour, which it is almost a necessity to have. We have given at some length three of the best ways of using it. The “Prevet” brand of dried apples is perhaps the best. They can be had from any export firm in tins containing one dozen squares. As soon as the tin has been opened, put the squares in a tin with tight fitting lid and they will keep good for any length of time. Half a square will make a small dish for one man. A quarter of a square is enough for an apple sauce or as a flavouring for curry. Other dried fruits of the same brand are very good, but apples and mirabelles are the best. Custards can be made with Bird’s Custard Powder, but the fresh custard is so much better and so easy to make that it is worth while to teach the cook how to do it. The only point of importance is that it should be made, not in a saucepan in direct contact with the fire, but in a pudding basin or a cup standing in a saucepan filled with boiling water. The proportions of Ideal milk to water vary a good deal in the following recipes according to the consistency required.

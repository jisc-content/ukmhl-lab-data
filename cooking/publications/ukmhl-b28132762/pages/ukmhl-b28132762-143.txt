SWEETS. 135 4. Have a good fire burning and the small frying pan very clean. Melt in it just enough butter, lard or oil to well grease the pan, less than half a teaspoon ; as soon as it begins to sing, pour in a small tablespoonful of the mixture and move the pan about so that the bottom is entirely covered with a very thin layer of paste. As soon as the pancake begins to set, keep the edges free from the pan with a knife and shake lightly to prevent the pancake from sticking. When the under part is turning yellow in the middle and light brown on the edges, take the pan off the fire and jerk it upwards so that the pancake turns completely over. When both sides are yellow in the centre and brown round the edges, the pancake is done. Slip it on a hot plate and keep it near the fire. 5. For each new pancake, melt a little more butter, lard or oil in the pan. Serve them piled up with halves of lime, native honey or jam. Note.â€”Pancakes can be made with the flour of native wheat (alkama) in exactly the same way. They are also very good made with massara flour which would require only one egg instead of two.

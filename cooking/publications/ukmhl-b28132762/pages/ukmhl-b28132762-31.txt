23 NATIVE SPINACH (alafu).—This grows very easily during the rains and some should be sown in every garden as it does not require the least care. It is best when the leaves are quite young and freshly picked. OKRO.—These are cultivated nearly everywhere, can be used for soup or as a vegetable, and are indispensable for palm oil chop. The young pods are best, and can also be made into a salad. PUMPKIN (kabewa).—By far the best variety is a dark green one covered with small raised white patches, called “ Kurzunu.” It makes a good soup and an excellent vegetable, either mashed or lightly boiled and then fried. GAUTA.—A fruit similar in appearance to a small tomato, but the taste is more like that of an egg plant; it is especially good cut in slices and fried. NATIVE ARTICHOKE (gwaza)—Has large green lily leaves. The root freshly pulled, cleaned and boiled is quite good. It must be freshly boiled, not bought cooked on the market. TATASSA.—A variety of large pepper which can be eaten stuffed or as a vegetable. PEPPERS (berkono).—Are found everywhere ; they are best fresh and are used instead of ordinary pepper for cooking. Soaked in sherry they produce an excellent sauce. Make a good provision of them while they are in season, dry them, and put them in a well-corked bottle. They will not be quite so strong as when fresh, but can well replace ordinary pepper. SOUR SOUR (yakwa).—The red leaves during the rains and the berries during the dry season can both be used to make a refreshing and pleasant drink. A nice jelly can also be made with the berries. GINGER (chitta).—Can generally be obtained on the market. Boiled when fresh it will make quite a good ginger beer.

FOR West African Cookery The Purity of LEMCO offers you the best security against the dangers of meat in the tropics. Its use means wholesome—appetising— more digestible—more nourishing food, having the full rich flavour of freshly cooked beef. LEMCO is unaffected by the intense heat and moisture of the West African climate, and keeps its purity for years. This is due to the extreme care exercised in its preparation,— the natural salts of the beef being retained, and all fatty matters excluded. For use in emergencies LEMCO has no equal. It is a splendid pick-me-up after fevers and breakdowns ; mixed with milk, or soda water, it creates a most refreshing, health-giving beverage,—stimulating after exertion, and a tonic to the digestive and nervous systems. all pure concentrated beef. -THAMES HOUSE, LONDON, E.C.

BREAD, SCONES AND CAKES. 152 2. By morning, the yeast should have risen, swelling the paste into a sort of sponge, frothy on top. If not sufficiently risen, stand it near the fire, the warmth will quicken the action of the yeast. 3. When it is risen, put what remains of the flour into a small enamel basin (bought from the Niger Co.), make a hole in the middle and pour into it the risen sponge. Dissolve the salt in a teacup of luke warm water (or milk), and pour in gradually, stirring your flour into the sponge at the same time. 4. When well mixed, begin kneading the dough with your fists, working always from the sides of the basin towards the middle. Have a little flour beside you in which to dip your hands if the dough sticks, or if it sticks very badly, add a little more flour to it. If, on the contrary, the dough is too dry, add a little water. The right consistency should be a smooth mass, very soft and yielding to the touch, yet not sticky or pasty. 5. When the dough comes clear away from the sides of the basin, put it on a board sprinkled with flour arid continue working it quickly, always with the fists and from the edges inwards, doubling it and turning it round and round. When it can be cut without any of it sticking to the knife the dough is ready. The kneading should take about ten minutes. 6. With a feather and a very little ground nut oil paint the inside of the 11b. baking tin and dust in a little flour. Shake the tin so that the flour is dusted only very lightly over the bottom and sides. Put in the dough, cover the tin with the piece of flannel and stand it rather near the fire until the dough has risen to the top of the tin. This will take, according to the temperature, one and a half to two hours. 7. Place the tin in a good hot oven. Keep the heat equal the whole time. Bake for about three quarters of an hour. When nearly baked, take the loaf out of the tin,

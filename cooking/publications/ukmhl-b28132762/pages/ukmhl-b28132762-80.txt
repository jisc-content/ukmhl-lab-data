MACARONI AND RICE. 72 When it is quite hot and bubbling, throw in the rice and fry it till it has turned a good deep yellow, stirring it about the whole time. 3. Tip the pan a little so that the fat drains off the rice, then take out the rice and put it into the boiling stock. Add the salt and pepper and keep slowly boiling until the stock has been all absorbed by the rice. Do not let the rice burn. 4. Slice the onion and fry it in what remains of the fat left from frying the rice. Throw in the little squares of meat and fry them also, but only just for a moment. Then mix together the onion, meat, rice, and the currants and grated cheese if obtainable. Serve very hot, piled in the small pie dish.

30 plants should be three feet apart and firmly tied to a stick four feet high. To prevent the plant spreading outward, all side shoots should be pinched off with the fingers, never cut with a knife, so as to have only the one strong central stem. When the plant has fruited to a height of three or four branches, pinch off also the top of this central stem. By doing this the fruit will be much larger and the plant will continue to bear longer. Tomatoes can also be allowed to run like cucumbers over a mat or trellis of branches raised a foot off the ground, but this method is not so good. CUCUMBERS (Vert de Paris).—Sow in boxes, leaving a space of three inches between each seed. Transplant when the plant has four leaves. Dig fairly deep holes in non-manured ground, five feet apart, only one row, put mixed manure and soil at the bottom, cover and plant the seedlings on top so that the roots do not reach the manure till the plant is well developed. Let it run over branches laid on the ground, or better, over a frame-work of branches raised a foot above the ground. Give shade during the whole of the first three days, and later during the hottest hours. They require a good deal of water. DWARF BEANS (Petits Noirs d’Alger).—Sow in open ground. Dig holes three quarters of a yard apart, much ■larger and deeper than seems necessary, mix a little manure at the bottom and cover with earth. Sow the beans in groups of five or six and almost on the surface. Cover with leaves or grass till they have sprouted. As they grow, raise the earth round the stalks. No shade required. It is well to sow three or four times at a fortnight’s interval, so as to have a continuous supply. EGG PLANT (Monstrneuse de New York).—Sow thinly in boxes. Transplant when six or seveu inches high, plant in medium rich soil, a yard apart. See that earth does not cake round roots. Shade only during first days after trans- planting.

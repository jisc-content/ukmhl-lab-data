28 THE VEGETABLE GARDEN. In Nigeria, a small vegetable garden is not only a distrac- tion but almost an absolute necessity, and with a little trouble you can make sure of a varied supply of vegetables from May to the end of November. Under certain con- ditions, proximity to a stream or well, it is even possible to have tomatoes, lettuces and beans all the year round, grown on a small space of irrigated ground. European vegetables, combined with the resources of the country, will provide the white man who has some little experience, with the fresh and varied food so necessary to health. Towards the end of March is the best time to begin sowing. This should be done in boxes raised on stones a few inches from the ground, in good light soil, enriched, if the ordinary soil is poor, with a little black soil, but it must on no account be heavy. A little gravel at the bottom will facilitate drainage. These boxes can easily be kept moist and the seedlings will still be under shelter when the first violent tornadoes break. The beds for their reception can be prepared at any time towards the end of ihe dry season. The chief cause of failure in Nigerian gardens is that not sufficient attention is given to the soil of these beds which must generally be enriched unless the garden happens to be on the site of an old village. Horse or sheep manure, never cow, and leaf mould found under old trees or along a river bank where maize has been grown, can be used. The black soil found near rivers is very good but sometimes too heavy unless mixed with about an equal quantity of ordinary soil. The ground must be well dug up ; the hoes of the natives are of not much use for deep digging and they take a little time to learn the use of a spade.

165 ODE’S AND ENDS. Note. Fresh native butter, well washed and drained, can be used with an equal quantity of lard, and greatly improves the crust, especially for a tart. Bread Crumbs.—We mention two kinds in the fore- going recipes, w7hite and brown. The white must be prepared just before using by putting a piece of stale bread in the oven; take it out as soon as it is dry but has not at all coloured and is still quite white; crush it by rolling a bottle over it. The brown bread crumbs should be made in advance. Cut thin slices of bread and put them in the oven with any bits of crust. Leave them there till they turn bright yellow and are quite crisp. The oven ought not to be too hot or the bread will burn. Take out the bread and crush it in a mortar or by rolling a bottle over it. If possible, sift the crumbs through a sieve and keep them in a well- corked bottle. The cook should prepare these crumbs each time he has any bits of bread left over, so as to have a supply always ready.

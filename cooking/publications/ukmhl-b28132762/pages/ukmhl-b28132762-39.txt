31 LETTUCE (Grosee Blonde Paresseuse).—Sow in boxes. Transplant when three inches high; plant in well mixed and manured soil a good foot apart. With plenty of water they will grow very quickly. Should be sown at intervals so as to have a continuous supply. Give shade all day during the first three days, and later during the hottest hours. PARSLEY.—Can be grown in boxes under the verandah all the year round, or can be sown in the open, in good soil, well dug. Requires a little shade. RADISHES.—Grow in boxes or in the open ground. Thin out when they begin to form. Sow frequently. SWEET PEPPER (Piments Doux d’Espagne).—Sow in boxes. Transplant when three or four inches high ; plant in ordinary soil two feet apart. They are best planted in the middle of the rainy season and will not require watering while the fruit is ripening. No shade. CABBAGE (Chou Nantais or Jouannet).—Requires well prepared soil. Dig deeply, scatter dried and well broken up manure over the surface, dig it in and repeat the operation a second time. Sow thinly in boxes, thin out so that they can grow to a height of six inches without getting weakly. Transplant in the evening, plant in quincunx two feet apart. Water plentifully during first days and give shade. When they begin to develop, keep the ground well hoed between the plants and occasionally scatter, and hoe in, a little more dry manure. In soil sufficiently rich cabbages can develop hearts as white and firm as in Europe. Red cabbage can be grown in the same way and is good in salad or pickled in vinegar. BEET ROOT (Covent Garden).—Sow in boxes. Trans- plant when the root is about the thickness of a pencil; plant in quincunx a good eighteen inches apart, in good ground mixed with rich black soil, rather than manure.

ODDS AND ENDS. 161 absorbed, turn on to a plate, flatten out to about three- quarters of an inch thick, allow to cool and then cut into rounds with the lid of a small tobacco or cocoa tin. Melt just enough butter, lard or ground nut oil to grease the small frying pan. Lift the cakes with a knife into the pan set on a medium fire. Turn them over with a knife when they are yellow; they must not be actually fried but just dried. Serve hot with native honey. Note.—The only way to have good porridge is to keep to the proportions of one part of oats to two parts and a quarter of milk or water, and to have it always cooked in a double boiler or in a saucepan standing inside another one. The massara makes even better cakes than the oats. The proportions must be two-and-a-half tablespoons massara to a breakfastcup of milk or water. If the massara is rather old, a little less liquid will be required. Milk.—It is usually safer to boil it, but if you can make perfectly sure that it comes from healthy animals and you have it in sufficient quantities, it is difficult to resist the temptation of having cream, and during the coolest months it is quite possible to keep the evening’s milk till about ten o’clock tbe following morning. It should be put into a wide enamel basin or a very clean wide calabash, covered with a piece of muslin or mosquito curtain (the air must be able to penetrate freely), and stood in a cooler. The cream should be skimmed off in the morning and can be kept even till luncheon time if the day is cool. It is needless to say that the strictest cleanliness is necessary and milk should never be stood close to other eatables. If you wish to take boiled milk with you on trek, be careful that it has quite cooled down before pouring it into the bottle. Junket.—Can be made with dried rennet, obtainable

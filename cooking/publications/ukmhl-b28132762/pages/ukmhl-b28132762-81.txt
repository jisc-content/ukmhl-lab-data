73 FOWLS. It is advisable, if possible, to buy a number of fowls at a time and to keep them for ten or fifteen days so that they may have a chance of fattening. How to Kill a Fowl.—The common way of killing a fowl by cutting its throat and throwing it on the ground to bleed to death is both inhuman and absurb, rendering it even more dry and tasteless than it need be. A heavy blow with a mallet on the back of the head is by far the best and most merciful method. When to Kill a Fowl.—Kill as late as possible in the evening, do not pluck or clean it, but hang it by the legs in a cool place, so that the blood runs dowm and leaves the flesh whiter. This is important. Early next morning, pluck and empty carefully; keep the liver, which should be turned for a moment in the pan with a little hot butter, sprinkled with pepper and s.et aside. It is also as well to Bprinkle a little pepper inside the fowl. Try to persuade the cook not to soak the fowl in hot water in order to render the work of plucking easier, this process absolutely ruins the bird. After being plucked it should be passed over a flame so as to singe off any remaining down, but this should only be done if you have a careful cook. Length of Time to Keep.—This greatly depends upon the season of the year, the place where they are hung and the care with which they have been cleaned. But even during the rains, it is possible to keep a fowl till the following evening; it should be looked at after lunch, and, if the weather is very hot, it can be turned a few moments in the frying pan with a little hot butter or lard.

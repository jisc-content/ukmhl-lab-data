Melt two tablespoonfuls of butter, lard or ground nut oil in the small frying pan over a hot fire ; when it has ceased bubbling, break in two eggs in the same way as was explained for poached eggs, and with a fork immediately bring the white well round the yolk. The eggs are cooked as soon as the edges are light brown and a little frizzled. Take them out of the pan, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and serve very hot. Never fry more than two eggs at a time in the small frying pan, as they must have plenty of fat round them. A few drops of vinegar added at the same time as the salt and pepper are a great improvement. Fried eggs can be served with fried bacon or in any of the different ways suggested for poached eggs.

Peel the pumpkin, cutting a good half-inch of rind away, take out the seeds and cut into pieces about three inches square. 2. Throw the pieces into a pint of boiling water; this stops the boiling, add the salt, bring again quickly to the boil and then let it simmer for about twenty minutes, by which time the pumpkin should be soft. 3. Drain off the water and mash the pumpkin through the sieve, add the milk, butter and pepper and pile it in a pie dish. Lightly scrape the surface with the prongs of a fork and brown it in the oven.

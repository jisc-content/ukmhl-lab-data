14 One small thick omelet frying pan. One tripod. Two wire meat covers. One wire meat safe, folding. *One mincing machine. One grater for cheese. One grater for nut. One small fine wire sieve. *One potato masher. One meat chopper and meat saw. One French tin coffee pot. One coffee mill. One small coffee strainer. One bread board. *One swizzle. *One ljlb. cake tin. *One toasting fork. *One set cutters. *One pestle. One spare wooden spoon. One spare one-lb. bread tin. *One large baking tin. One spare two-pint pie dish. One spare four-pint pudding basin. Spare knife, fork and spoon. Four scrubbing brushes. The utensils marked with an asterisk are not indispens- able. If a mincing machine is taken, it must be of a very simple make, easily taken to pieces, and its cleanliness should be often inspected. A bottle can do instead of a pastry roller and a pestle could be made locally of any hard wood. The swizzle can also be made locally. The pudding basins and pie dishes should be of enamel, not of earthenware. A set of cutters takes little room and is useful for neatly stamping out scones or rounds of bread for savouries, &c. Three yards of “ household flannel ” should be bought to wrap round the basin in which the bread is set to rise. See chapter on bread making.

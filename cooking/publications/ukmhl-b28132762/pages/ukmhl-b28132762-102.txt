94 MUTTON AND BEEF. In stations where there is no properly run meat market, or no “ mutton club,” it is most inadvisable to buy meat- on the native market. On the other hand, if you buy a sheep ior yourself alone or are made a present of one, it is difficult to know how to make use of it without too much waste. This is perhaps the best way: have the sheep killed at sunset, skin it and hang it till the following morn- ing. Cut it up as early as possible. Keep the brains, kidneys, one leg, the saddle, the best end of the neck, and give the rest away. The kidneys can be used for breakfast, the brains and the cutlets from {he neck for lunch, and either the saddle or leg roasted or braised or boiled for dinner. These can go on for the next day as a cottage pie or mince for break- fast, and cold with a salad or curried for lunch. The trimmings of the cutlets and the poorer end of the saddle will make enough soup for both days. As soon as the sheep is cut up, the saddle and the leg should be salted and peppered and kept in the meat safe. If about mid-day doubts arise as to their safety, they should be turned in the frying pan in a little very hot butter or lard. If you intend to boil the leg, it can be plunged for a moment into boiling water instead. Both these methods will preserve the meat safely till the evening. Meat, so long as it is protected from dust and flies, should always be freely exposed to the air, which will slightly harden the outer skin and thus preserve the meat. If the meat does not seem quite clean or has not beeu properly protected from the flies, it should be washed in strong vinegar and water before cooking.

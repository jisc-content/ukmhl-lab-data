104 MUTTON AND BEEF. To Boil a Ham. (I) Soak the ham in cold water for at least fifteen hours, or more if the ham is a large one. Change the water once or twice if possible. The time a ham should soak varies a great deal according to its kind and size. Put the ham in the vegetable boiler or in a large native pot if the boiler is not big enough, with enough cold water to well cover it. Add two onions stuck with six cloves and a little dried thyme. Let it come to the boil, take off the scum and set the pot aside to simmer, counting twenty-five minutes simmering for each pound. A seven pound ham ought to simmer between three and three and a half hours. On no account must it be allowed to go on boiling quickly. If the ham is to be eaten cold, let it cool in the liquid it has cooked in, it will add to its flavour. When cold, take it out, skin and trim it, and cover it with fine yellow bread crumbs. In order to make the crumbs stick, the outside of the ham must be slightly warmed. Lastly, stick in cloves like little nails all over the ham, about half an inch apart. Tinned Meat. (1). “ Army and Navy Rations” or tinned stews of any kind should be heated by putting a tio into a saucepan of boiling water. Tinned cold meat, such as brisket of beef, spiced beef, brawn or tongue, should be put in a cooler as long as possible before opening. A great deal can be got out of a tin of Crosse & Blackwell’s “Roast Beef”; a soup made with the gravy mixed with an equal quantity of water and thickened with rice or atcha, a cottage pie (see index) or croquettes (see index) made with one half of the beef; and the other half, cut in small pieces and mixed with cold yam or sweet potatoes or native beans and tomatoes, will make a very good salad (see index).

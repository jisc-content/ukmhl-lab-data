84 FOWLS. Poulet Cocotte (II). 1 fowl. | pint stock. 1 tablespoon butter, lard or ground nut oil. 10 young green onions (if not available, onion cut in medium pieces). 1 teacup of tumuku, risga or sweet potatoes, cut in one inch squares. 1 tatassa. 1 clove. 1 piece of lime peel. 2 berkono or a pinch of pepper. 1 teaspoon salt. (1 teaspoon parsley and dried thyme). Fresh young carrots, turnips and French beans make this dish much better and if they are obtainable do not use the tumuku, risga or sweet potatoes. 1. Put in the native pot a tablespoon butter. When quite hot and singing, put in the fowl whole, keep it on a brisk fire, turning the fowl with a fork so that it gets nicely browned all over. When this is done take it out of the pot. If you have been using oil, pour it away, if butter or lard let it remain. Put in half the vegetables (carrots and turnips if large cut in dice) putting at the bottom those that are the longest to cook, then return the fowl and put the rest of the vegetables on top with the salt, pepper, lime peel, cloves and herbs, and pour over the stock. Bring to the boil, keeping the pot covered, then let it simmer very gently for an hour. The goodness of the dish depends on the slow cooking. When done, the fowl can be taken out, carved and replaced in the pot (leaving out the carcase). Serve in the pot in which it was cooked.

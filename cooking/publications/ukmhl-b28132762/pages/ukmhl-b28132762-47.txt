SOUPS. 39 1. Put the trimmings into a two-pint saucepan or a small native pot, add the onion, pepper, salt, and cold water. Set on a slow fire, take off all the scum as it rises, and when it has reached boiling point, which ought to take at least twenty minutes, throw in the other vegetables if you have them, boil up again and then put by the side of the fire and let it simmer for a good hour. By this time the soup will be reduced to half a pint. Pass it through a sieve into a pudding basin and let it stand till required. Stock can be made in the same way with any bones of beef or mutton.

As soon as it boils, throw in the onion split in two, the salt and pepper, (carrots and turnips split in two, the bunch of parsley, the onion tops). Throwing in the vegetables will stop the boiling. Watch it till it boils again, then put the lid on a little sideways so that the steam can escape. 3. Put the pot on the range as far as possible from the fire with just enough heat to keep it simmering. If on a native fire, keep several large pieces of wood just burning so as to give out a slow and equal heat. Let it simmer thus for at least two good hours (the cook mate properly

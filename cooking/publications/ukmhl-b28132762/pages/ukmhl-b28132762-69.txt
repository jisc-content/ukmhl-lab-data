EGGS. 61 Oeufs Printaniere. (II). 2 eggs. 1 good teaspoon butter or lard. A pinch of salt and pepper. 1 dessertspoonful small dices of fried bread. 1 dessertspoonful tinned peas or beans. After beating the two eggs, mix in a dessertspoonful of little dices of fried bread and a dessertspoonful of tinned peas or French beans left over from an opened tin, and cook in the same way as the plain buttered eggs. Serve, not on toast, but in a small dish. Buttered eggs mixed with small slices of fried tomato and onion are also very good. i teaspoon salt. An omelet cannot be good cooked in a thin frying pan It must be a thick one. 1. Break the eggs into a large cup or into the small pudding basin, add the salt and pepper (and the chopped parsley if obtainable.) With a fork beat the eggs till they are a little frothy on Lop, which should not take more than two minutes. It is equally bad to beat the eggs too much as to beat them too long in advance, which is what all cooks like to do. 2. Melt the butter in the small omelet pan, and when it has ceased to splutter and begins to turn brown, pour in the beaten eggs. 3. Slowly move tbe pan about till the eggs begin to set round the edges of the pan. 4. Carefully slip a knife under the edges of the omelet, so as to loosen it from the pan and to allow the still uncooked portion of the eggs to run underneath. Do this twice, slightly moving the pan the whole time. When only a very little liquid egg is left on top and the omelet is still quite soft, slip the knife right underneath, shake tbe Plain Omelet. (I). 4 eggs. 1 teaspoon butter or lard. A pinch of pepper. (1 teaspoon chopped parsley.)

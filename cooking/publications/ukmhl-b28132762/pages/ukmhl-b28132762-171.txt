163 ODDS AND ENDS. Carefully boiled and salted, this butter will keep for months, and its use will of course represent a great economy. Tinned Butter.—All the tins of butter should be kept in as cool a place as possible, and each tin should be put in the cooler for some hours before it is opened so that the contents should be more or less solid. When required, empty the tin into a soup plate, pour on enough cold water to cover the butter (soda water or sparklet would be even better), and beat both together with a fork. Then drain off the water, pressing the butter with the back of a spoon so as to get rid of all the moisture. Add half-a • teaspoon salt to the butter, put it in an empty jar (an imperial cheese jar is convenient), press it down tightly, keep the jar covered and standing in a soup plate full of water when not in use. Frying.—We would like to again emphasize the fact that fat must be very hot before it is possible to fry in it If using butter or lard, it should have ceased to bubble, be quite still, and a little smoke should rise from it. Ground nut oil takes much longer to heat than either butter or lard, it must also become quite still and the smoke must be turning'blue. All fat can be used several times over if any little bits of batter, etc., are carefully picked out after each frying. The fat used for frying fish should be always kept in a separate jar. Batter.— One egg ; two tablespoons flour ; three table- spoons milk (if Ideal, one teaspoon to the rest of water) ; half-a-teaspoon olive oil or ground nut oil; a pinch of salt. Mix the flour and milk in the small pudding basin. Add the yolk only of the egg, the oil and the salt. Beat it all well together till it has the consistency of a thick cream. If too thin add a little more flour, if too thick a little water. Cover the basin with a plate and let it stand till wanted,

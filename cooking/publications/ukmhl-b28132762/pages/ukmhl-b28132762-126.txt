VEGETABLES. 118 Drain off the water and put them in the saucepan with half a pint cold water, the onion, salt and pepper. Bring slowly to the boil, then set a little aside and simmer gently for two or three hours, till the lentils or peas are quite soft. The time varies according to their freshness. If the water has been all absorbed before they are cooked, add a little more. The lentils will not take so long to cook as the peas and should be taken off tbe fire before they become a mash. Add half a teaspoon butter or lard and sprinkle with chopped parsley, if possible, before serving. Cold lentils are very good in a salad. The peas must be mashed through a sieve and half a teaspoon butter or lard and a pinch of salt and pepper added to the pur6e before serving. Dried Native Beans. (I).

21 MAIZE (massara).—Exoellent for porridge and for scones, either ground to flour or slightly broken. It is best not to buy the maize ready ground on the market but to arrange with one of your boy’s wives that she should herself grind or break it for you, paying her a little over the ordinary market price on condition that it is free from grit and dust. You thus make sure of having the flour fresh and fairly clean. The handmill advised for grinding the wheat could also be used for the maize. NATIVE RICE (shinkafa).—Two different kinds are sold on the market: “ Shinkafa gumi,” which is not very good, as it has already been half-boiled to facilitate the removal of the husks ; and “ shinkafa danye ” (meaning uncooked), which though generally rather brown, is almost as good as Patna Rice. It must be very carefully washed several times, and half a lime squeezed into the water in which it is going to boil will help to whiten it. The native women know how to grind it, and it can then be used for thickening soups instead of flour, or for making ground rice shapes, or for porridge. ACHA.—Closely resembles semolina and can be had nearly all the year round. It is useful for porridge, fritters, soup and puddings. A MARA.—A tuber which grows wild in the bush and is gathered by women who grind it into a flour very much like cornflour, which can be used for thickening soup or for making into shapes. GROUND NUTS (gedda).—They can be obtained all the year round, but the chief crop is in November. They make excellent soup and stews and are delicious slightly dried in the oven and eaten instead of salted almonds. YAMS (doya).—They can be got almost anywhere in the southern provinces. As they can be easily kept for a long time, if in a dry place, one should lay in a good supply while their market price is reasonable. B

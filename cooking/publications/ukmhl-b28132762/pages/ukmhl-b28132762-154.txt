146 SAVOURIES. A visit to Fortnum and Mason will provide you with many ideas and if such luxuries as foie gras and caviare are attainable they can certainly give you the best. Savouries should be served up very neatly and very hot. Slices of bread slightly fried in a little butter can nearly always take the place of toast, are easier for the cook to prepare and will remain crisp. Eggs on Anchovy Toast. (I). 1 slice bread. 2 eggs. 1 teaspoon anchovy paste. A pinch of pepper and salt. 1 small teaspoon butter or l&rd. 1. Cut a slice of bread a quarter of an inch thick, halve it, trim off the crust, leaving two pieces about two and a half inches long and two inches broad; or the bread can be stamped into rounds of about one inch and a half diameter, with the cover of a tin. 2. Boil the eggs hard, crush the yolks lightly with a fork without making them into a paste, mix with them half of the butter, the pepper and salt. 3. Put the rest of the butter into the frying pan ; when quite hot and singing, put; in the slices of bread, toss them till they are crisp and golden on both sides, turning them once. Little butter must be used and it must be very hot, otherwise the bread will be greasy. 4. Butter the bread with anchovy paste and with a fork pile on top the crushed yolk of eggs. Serve at once. Note.—The same savoury can be made with lobster paste or bloater paste instead of anchovy. Anchovy eggs and capers.—The same as above, putting a few capers on top of the eggs. Anchovy eggs and olives.—Put a stoned olive on top of the eggs.

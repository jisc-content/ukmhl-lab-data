MUTTON AND BEEF. 103 water to well cover it, add the onion, berkono and salt. Bring it to the boil, taking off the scum as it rises. Move it a little aside and let it simmer gently till tender. Take it out of the saucepan and take the skin off at once. Note.—The tongue can be eaten hot or cold, but in Nigeria it is better cold and eaten with a salad. Beef Steak Pie. About 1 lb. of steak cut in strips about 1 inch broad. 2 sheep’s kidneys. 1 hard boiled egg. 1 dessertspoon flour. 1 small teaspoon salt. 1 small teaspoon pepper. 1 large breakfast cup stock. Pie crust (see index). 1. Mix the flour, salt and pepper on a plate. Turn in it the strips of steak and kidneys, cut in slices. Roll up the strips of steak and pack them in the pie dish, filling in the spaces with the sliced kidney and hard boiled egg. Pour over half the stock whioh should nearly fill the pie dish. 2. With a feather and a little water wet the edges of the pie dish. Have ready the paste for the pie crust. Cut a strip the width of the edge of the dish and lay it all round. Wet it with a feather and then lay the remainder of the paste over the dish, press the edges down lightly all round the dish and cut off evenly what is left hanging down. Make a small hole in the middle of the crust. 3. Cover the pie dish with a piece of well greased paper and put it in the oven for about two hours. Do not take off the paper till half an hour before the pie is ready or the crust will be burnt. 4. Heat the remaining stock, then take the pie out of the oven and pour the stock through the little hole, taking care not to wet the crust around it. This pie is better eaten hot.

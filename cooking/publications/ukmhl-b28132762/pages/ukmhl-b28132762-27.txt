19 forks must be brightened with plate powder and a flanuel duster. Brass is better cleaned with damp ashes than with lime juice. A cheap alarm clock would be a source of great pride to the boy and an encouragement to punctuality. Cloths and dusters present a difficult problem which is perhaps best resolved as follows :—take out one dozen good teacloths, one dozen dusters (cheap) and two dozen strong kitchen rubbers. Give only three rubbers at a time to the cook, and two dusters and three tea-cloths to the boy. Inspect their cleanliness twice a week and do not give out new ones till the old ones are nearly worn out, they can then be used for floors and lamps. A few very cheap knitted rubbers or flannel dusters will bo needed for boots, saddlery, etc. Dissuade the boy from wearing a tea cloth, loosely knotted round his neck, while he is serving at table. Washing up must be done immediately after each meal and is easiest done in a large enamel basin which you can get quite cheaply at the Niger Co. It is as well to buy three of these basins, one large one for washing up, one smaller one for the cook and one spare one. See that the boy uses hot water, and that he washes the glasses first, then the knives, forks and spoons, and lastly the plates. The knives should never be left lying in the water or the handles crack. It is very difficult to induce a boy to use sufficient water for washing up ; he seems to consider it less trouble to wash everything in a pudding basin. As soon as he has finished, the teacloths should be hung up to dry. Serving at table is one of the things a boy will often take pride in. Allow ‘him a nice riga and encourage him to make the table look as nice as possible even in the bush.

98 MUTTON AND BEEF. Irish Stew. (I). 8 or 9 pieces cut from the best part of a neck of mutton. 2 onions. 1 teacup yam or sweet pota- toes cut in pieces one inch square. 1 dessertspoon flour. 2 berkono or a pinch of pepper. $ teaspoon salt. (A teacup carrots and turnips cut in pieces one inch square and a bunch of parsley if available). 1. Spread the flour on the cookâ€™s board and turn in it the pieces of mutton which you have previously sprinkled with salt and pepper. 2. Put the pieces in the flat saucepan with enough cold water to cover them. Bring to the boil, when just boiling take off the scum with a spoon, then add the onions (and carrots, turnips and parsley). Move your saucepan a little aside, cover it and let it simmer very gently for an hour. Then add the pieces of yam or sweet potatoes and simmer for another three-quarters of an hour. It must simmer slowly, not boil, and the saucepan must be kept covered. Note. This stew is very good done in the Welbank Boilerette. Cutlets. (II). Cutlets from the best end neck of mutton can be good, even in Nigeria, if they are carefully cut and trimmed. 1. First saw off the chine bone, then the end of the row of bones level and cut off the outer flap ; take a very sharp knife and divide the row of cutlets down to the bone with one clean decided cut between each of them, and lastly, sever them one by one with a single stroke of the chopper. 2. Lay the cutlets flat on the board and give them a few strokes with the flat of your chopper, trim them into shape, remove the gristle and scrape off all the meat at the ends of the bones, exposing an inch-and-a-half of them.

49 FISH. For general remarks concerning the fish obtainable in Nigeria, see the chapter on native produce. When to cook Fish.—Fish caught, as is usual, during the night or in the very early morning, should be cooked as soon as it is brought to you, but if well cleaned and protected from flies, it is possible to keep it till lunch time. Any attempt to leave it uncooked till dinner time will be followed by dire results. Nigerian fish have an all per- vading odour probably unsurpassed by any other species. How to Divide Fish.—If a large fish is brought to you, have it cleaned, then cut off the head and tail, which can be given to the boys, leaving only a middle piece weighing about four pounds. You can then use the four pounds as follows :—Take off about a pound and divide it into fillets which can be fried for breakfast ; boil the remaining three pounds and serve for lunch with a white sauce. What is left over must be carefully put away in the meat safe, and can be eaten cold for dinner with mayonnaise or in a salad. Enough will still remain to be made into croquettes or kedgeree for breakfast the next morning. As fish is seldom plentiful, it is worth while to spend a little thought on the best ways to make use of it. How to Clean Fish.—The cook must not leave the fish lying in water for too long a time before cleaning it. If the fish has scales, they should be scraped off with a knife and the gills cut off. The fish should be cleaned without being slit open more than is possible, and all the blood carefully washed off.

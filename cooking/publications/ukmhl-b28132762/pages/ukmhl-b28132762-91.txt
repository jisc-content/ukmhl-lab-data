FOWLS. 83 I \ Poulet Menagere. (I.) 1 fowl l£ tablespoons butter, lard or ground nut oil. 1 large onion cut in 5 or 6 pieces, not sliced. 1 teacup tumuku, risga or sweet potatoes, cut in one inch squares. 1 clove. 2 berkono or one good pinch pepper. 1 teaspoon salt, i teaspoon dried thyme or chopped parsley. 1. Put one tablespoon butter into the flat saucepan. When hot put in the tumuku or risga, which have been scraped, not peeled, or the pieces of sweet potato. Keep the pan moving till they turn yellow ; add the onion, taking care that it does not burn. When the vegetables are half cooked remove them from the pan, putting them in an empty frying pan to keep hot, but do not let them cook any more, 2. Add to the fat already in the saucepan (but be care- ful that no particles of the vegetables remain) the other half tablespoonful butter. When quite hot put in your fowl whole, and fry both sides equally till light yellow, then put back the vegetables, add the clove, the herbs, pepper and salt, toss once more on the fire, then put aside and cover the pan so that it goes on cooking very slowly, till the fowl and vegetables are thoroughly cooked. The whole process can be done in a little more than half an hour. If towards the end you fear it may burn, add half a tablespoon butter or lard, (water would entirely spoil the dish). Note.—This is a useful bush dish. Pigeons or ducks can be cooked in the same manner, allowing less time for pigeons and more for duck.

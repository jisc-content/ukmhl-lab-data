119 VEGETABLES. Carrots. (II). Young carrots (those taken out when thinning the carrot bed) can be used as a vegetable, the larger ones are better for soup or a stew. Wash and scrape the carrots with a knife, do not peel them. Throw them into boiling water and let them boil for a few minutes, then move them aside and let them slowly finish cooking. Serve them with a little white sauce (see index) adding a little pinch of sugar. When cooked, they can also be turned in a little hot butter or lard, then sprinkled with salt, pepper and chopped parsley. Turnips. (II). Young turnips can be used as a vegetable; the large ones are stringy and can only be used for soup or a stew. 1. Wash and scrape six or eight turnips, cut them lengthways and crossways in two. Plunge them for five minutes in boiling salted water. 2. Drain the turnips and put them in a small saucepan with just enough stock, milk or water to cover them. Let them simmer at the side of the fire till quite tender. 3. Put half a teaspoon butter or lard in the small flat saucepan, when hot, put in the turnips and turn them about till they have absorbed the fat and are of a deep yellow colour. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and a little chopped parsley. Turnips are good boiled in the same wTay and then mashed. Add pepper, salt and half a teaspoon butter; if too thick mix in a little milk. Cabbage. (II). 1 head cabbage. 2 medium sized sweet pota- toes or good piece of yam. 1 dessertspoon lard or oil. 1 teaspoon pepper. 1 dessertspoon salt. 1. To clean a head of cabbage, cut it in four and let it soak for two hours in salted water before using it. The salted water will draw out any slugs, &c.

57 FISH. Curried Fish. (I). A useful way of serving any remains of cold boiled fish is to break it up slightly with a fork, mix it with a curry sauce (see index), and serve it up with a crown of boiled rice around it. Tinned Salmon. (I). Salmon and sardines are the only two really useful tinned fish. Salmon can be prepared in almost as many ways as fresh fish and the same recipes can be used for salad, croquettes, kedgeree and fish pie as for fresh fish. It is excellent grilled whole, hut as it is liable to break on the grill, it is best to turn out the tin into the frying pan and to fry it with a teaspoonful of butter or lard until a light crisp brown. Serve with sauce hollandaise (see index) or with melted butter (see index). It can be served cold with lettuce leaves, sliced tomatoes and oil, vinegar, salt and pepper or mayonnaise sauce (see index).

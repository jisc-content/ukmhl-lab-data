FOWLS. 87 4. Put the butter in the flat saucepan, when quite hot put in the rolls of fowl and cook them slowly, moving the saucepan so that they do not brown too quickly.

Chicken Fritters. (II). The wings and breast of a roast fowl. 1 small teacup batter. 1 breakfast cup ground nut oil. A pinch of salt and pepper. 1. Prepare the batter (see index); this should be done about two hours in advance if possible. 2. Neatly cut the wings and breast making six pieces, removing skin and bone. (The legs can be put aside to be devilled for the next dayâ€™s breakfast). Dust them with salt and pepper and roll them lightly in a little flour spread on the board. 3. Heat the oil in the flat saucepan ; there must be enough oil to cover the fritters. When the oil has ceased to bubble, test it by throwing in a little piece of bread. If you hear the little sizzling sound of frying, the fat is ready. 4. Dip the pieces of fowl into the batter, covering them evenly with the mixture, then put them carefully one by one into the hot oil, turn them once and take them out as soon as they are of a bright yellow colour. If the oil has been hot enough, they will come out quite dry and free from grease. If parsley is obtainable, a few sprigs thrown into the oil while the fritters are frying and taken out as soon as they are crisp but not black, are an improvement if served scattered over the fritters. The fritters can be eaten with tomato sauce (see index) or served on mashed yam, spinach, macaroni or cabbage. These fritters are quite easily made and are often useful as an entrbe.

126 SWEETS. Rice Pudding. (I). 1 heaped up tablespoon rice. £ pint milk (if Ideal, 1 table- spoon to the rest of water.) 3 lumps or 1 dessertspoon sugar. £ teaspoon butter. 2 or 3 drops vanilla essence. 1. Wash the rice. This quantity will be enough for one man only. 2. With a feather paint the inside of the smallest pie- dish with a little of the butter. Drain the rice, put it in the dish, pour over the milk, add the sugar and vanilla and float on top the little piece of butter that is left. Bake in a slow oven for a good hour. If you have no oven, the rice can be simply boiled in the small enamel saucepan with the milk, sugar and vanilla. Boil slowly till the rice has absorbed all the milk, stirring from time to time so that the rice does not burn. Note.— A pudding made of native rice will only take about half an hour to bake. A milk pudding can be improved by adding a few figs. Wash them, soak them, cut them in half and put them in the dish with the rice or tapioca. They will cook gently with the pudding and make it all the nicer. Tapioca Pudding. (I). 1 level tablespoon tapioca. £ pint fresh milk (if Ideal, I tablespoon to the rest of water). 3 lumps or 1 dessertspoon sugar. £ teaspoon butter. 2 or 3 drops of vanilla essence. 1. If the tapioca has stuck together in lumps, crush it with a bottle. Paint the inside of the smallest pie-dish with a little of the butter, and about two hours before the pudding is wanted put in the tapioca with the milk, sugar, vanilla and the remaining butter and let it stand. 2. Fifteen minutes before the time to serve, put the pie-dish in the oven to bake and brown on top.

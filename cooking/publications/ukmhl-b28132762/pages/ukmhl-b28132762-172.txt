164 ODDS AND ENDS. adding just before using the white of egg beaten stiff. If possible, always prepare a good two hours before it will be required. Pie Crust.â€”One good teacup flour; half a small teacup lard ; a pinch of salt; a very small teacup water, as cold as possible, The proportions will make enough crust to cover the large pie dish. If wanted for a tart, put a very small pinch of salt and add a small teaspoon sugar. Use only filtered water, taken straight from the cooler, and mix the paste in the coolest place possible. The cook should wash his hands in cold water before beginning. The flour must be dry and well sifted, and the tin of lard should have been kept in the cooler to make it as firm as possible. 1. Mix the flour, salt (and sugar if required) in the large pudding basin. Add the lard and mix well and quickly with the back of a wooden spoon; pour in the cold water a little at a time until you have made a dough which will come freely away from the sides of the basin, and will be soft but not sticky to the touch. If the lard was firm, a small teacupful will be needed. 2. Sprinkle the bread board with a little extra flour, lay the dough on it, flour your hands well and quickly roll the dough on the board with the palms of your hands. If it sticks to the board, scrape off with a knife and sprinkle on more flour. Continue rolling till it no longer sticks to the board or the hands, and feels elastic to the touch. 3. If you have no pastry roller, use a bottle rubbed with a little flour to flatten out the ball of dough. Always roll away from, never towards, you, and turn the paste about so that it gets rolled in every direction and has shaped into a broad oval. Roll lightly and quickly and stop as soon as you have obtained tbe right thickness. The dough can be made before preparing the pie, but it should not be rolled out till you are ready to lay it on the pie dish,

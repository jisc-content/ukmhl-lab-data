97 MUTTON AND BEEF. To be tender, a boiled leg of mutton must be put into boiling water, not in cold. 1. Put in your big vegetable boiler or native pot sufficient water to well cover the leg of mutton, add the berkono and salt. When the water is boiling put in the leg, and the whole onion peeled, let it boil well for five minutes; then set aside and let it simmer for a short hour. 2. Serve the boiled mutton with caper sauce (see index) and boiled rice. The caper sauce can be made with the water the leg has boiled in. If the parsley, carrots and turnips are available, add them after the first boil up and serve as a garnish round the leg. Mutton Curry, (I). 1 breakfast cup of pieces of mutton cut in small squares 1 breakfast cup stock or hot water. 1 dessertspoon curry. 1 large onion. 1$ tablespoons butter or lard. 1 teaspoon salt. 2 tablespoons dried or Prevet apples, or two tomatoes, or two or three carrots. 1. Put the butter in the three-pint saucepan, when very hot put in the pieces of meat, fry till a little brown, then take them out. Fry the onion and curry powder. (If carrots, tomatoes or apples are available, they must be fried separately in a little extra butter, the carrots minced, the tomatoes sliced and the apples soaked and cooked before frying them). 2. Put the fried meat into the saucepan with the onion and curry (add the vegetables if any) then pour the stock in slowly and let it simmer for two hours. If it gets too dry add a little more stock. Notes.â€”For cooked meat, proceed in the same way, adding the meat to the fried onion and curry powder; use half the quantity of stock and let it simmer only twenty minutes. For beef, cooked or uncooked, the process is the same.

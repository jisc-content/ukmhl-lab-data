151 BREAD, SCONES AND CAKES. than the native yeast or baking powder generally used. We give directions for making bread with these also, but if baking powder is used we think it better to make small rolls rather than loaves. As we give full explanations of how to knead and bake in the recipe for bread made with yeast cake, we do not repeat them when speaking of bread made with native yeast or baking powder. With a practised cook, very little more than one pound of flour should make a 1-lb. loaf; a 7-lb. tin of flour should give six 1-lb. loaves. Do not let the cook bake too much at a time, three 1-lb, loaves are quite sufficient, less would be better. The scones, especially those made with massara. are excellent, and should be tried by everybody. A very good yeast can be made with dried hops, but the process is rather more complicated. Bread made with Yeast Cake. To make one 1-lb. loaf. 2£ level breakfastcups flour. About 2 small teacups warm water. Jr of a yeast cake. i teaspoon salt. A pinch of sugar. If the bread is to be ready for next day’s lunch, set the yeast to rise in the evening. 1. Measure the flour, sift it and set it aside. Dissolve a sixth part of a yeast cake in a teacup of luke-warm water, add the pinch of sugar. When the yeast is quite dissolved, which will be in about half-an-hour’s time, pour it into the large pudding basin and mix with it enough of the flour to make a thick smooth paste. Beat it for a minute or two with a spoon till it looks slightly frothy. Cover the basin with a thick cloth (a cheap stuff called “household flannel” does very well), wrap it in another and stand it in a warm, but not too hot place. An equal temperature, with no chance of draughts, is especially needed. In the bush, the basin, wrapped in flannel, might be stood in a box covered with a cloth.

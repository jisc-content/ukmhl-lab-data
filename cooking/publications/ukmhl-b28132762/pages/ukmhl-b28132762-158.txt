150 BREAD, SCONES AND CAKES. The first attempts at bread-making are seldom successful, and there will be many deceptions before satisfactory results are obtained. The most usual errors are that the dough is kneaded too long and too heavily, and that too much liquid is added to it. If the dough is worked as it should be, one should use about two teacups of water to two-and-ahalf level breakfastcups of flour, i.e., one pound of flour. These are the correct proportions, but an un- practised cook will probably require more water, and in any case, the amount depends greatly on the condition of the flour. A special board should be kept on which to make the bread. The flour should be of good quality, quite dry and sifted through the sieve. A quick oven is required at first and should then be allowed to cool down a little while the bread is baking. If an equal quantity of milk and water can be used to make the dough, the bread will be all the better. If Alkama flour is used, a little less liquid will be required. It should be sifted two or three times before using. Excellent bread can be made with Alkama mixed with an equal quantity of English flour. According to our experience, the best and easiest way to make bread in Nigeria is to use Huckvaleâ€™s Royal Yeast Cake, obtainable from the Army and Navy Stores. It is best to take out six tins and to have a fresh supply sent out every three months. It is cheap, light and not bulky. The cook will say he does not know how to use it, but, if you patiently give him the right proportions every time, he will soon get used to it and it is much safer and nicer

15 OF COOKS AND BOYS. One can say that there are three classes of cooks: the coast man with wages from at least £2 10s. Od. to £3 a month; the native cook at £1 10s. Od. to £2 ; and the simple savage at £1 or less. (All three will ask for the weekly 2/- chop money). If by saving in other ways, you can afford to get a Coast Man, he is certainly the best, especially if he comes from Accra. He is a born cook, he understands recipes, can be taught almost anything and seems to have an instinctive knowledge of how things ought to look and taste. He has a fair idea of order and cleanliness, and under favourable circumstances, can be put in charge of the other boys. Knowing better the value of your possessions, he may be more inclined to steal but with a little luck you will find him a useful reliable man, able to look after your stores and much less wasteful than the ordinary native cook. He will want his passage money from Accra to Forcados (about £2) and will also demand a “ cook-mate,” whom you can allow him. As soon as the cooking falls below the usual standard, the cook-mate should be dismissed, as it is a sure sign that the cook is leaving him to do all the work. The native cook will meet you at Forcados. With equal eagerness he will press his “ book ” into your band or tell you guilelessly “ Me plenty book, big fire catch him, book no live ” ; it matters little if you believe him or not for at this moment only luck can help you in your choice. He may turn out quite good, and though never the equal of the Accra cook, will be anxious to learn and is often more useful on trek, to which the Accra man sometimes objects strongly.

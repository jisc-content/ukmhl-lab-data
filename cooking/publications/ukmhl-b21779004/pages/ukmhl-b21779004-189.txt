A VISIT TO THE MONKS OF ST. BERNARD. 165 M 3 snug in a good bed, like the hero of Kocroy, de- termined to sleep till the battle trumpet sounded. I was awakened by a robust friar, who nearly pulled my arms out of their sockets, and who in- formed me that Mass was about to be performed. I hastened to the chapel, where I found every one at his post. We executed a symphony, an anthem, and other religious pieces, finishing with a quatuor of wind instruments, and, with all due modesty be it said, I think we managed pretty well. Praises were showered upon us, and, after having received the thanks of the abbot, we sat down to dinner. Dinner was served in the style of the fifteenth century ; few side dishes, few superfluities, but an excellent choice of meat, simple, substantial ra- gouts, all well cooked, and vegetables of a flavour unknown to the lowlands. Abundance seemed the order of the day. At the second course there were no less than fourteen different dishes of roast. The dessert was the more remarkable, as it con- sisted of fruits not to be found at such an eleva- tion ; the valleys at the foot of the mountains had been placed under contribution for the occasion.

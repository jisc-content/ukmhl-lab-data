Thus was hospitality born with rights held sacred by every nation ; for no matter how ferocious the race, it held it a sacred duty to respect the life of the man who had eaten its bread and salt. It is during repasts that language must have been improved, because men continually met, and confidence and conversation was the result. Such must have been, from the nature of things, the elements of "the pleasures of the table," which is perfectly distinct, let it be understood, from the " pleasure of eating," which is its neces- sary antecedent. The pleasure of eating is the actual and direct sensation of a want which is satisfied. We share the pleasure of eating in common with all animals ; it simply implies hunger and wherewithal to satisfy it.

POLITICAL GASTRONOMY. 75 often decided at a dinner. This is neither paradox nor novel, but a simple matter of every-day ob- servation. Open any historian, from Herodotus down to the present day, and, not even excepting conspiracies, it may be said, that no great event ever occurred without having been conceived, pre- pared, and determined upon at a feast. Such is the superficial glance at the domain of gastronomy, a domain fertile in results of every description, and which cannot but advance with the onward march of science ; for in a few years gastronomy must have its academy, its lectures, its professors, its prizes. First, some rich and zealous gastronome will invite his friends to his table at fixed periods to discuss, in conjunction with learned theoricians and artistes, some interesting point of alimentary science. Soon (and this is the history of all academies) government will intervene, regulate, protect, institute. Thrice happy the man whose name will figure as the founder of such an academy. His name will be handed down to all posterity with the names of Noah, Bacchus, Triptolemus' and other benefactors of man; he will be amongst ministers what Henry IV. is amongst kings, and his praise will be in every man's mouth without any law to compel it.

HANDBOOK OF DINING. 176 Dinners are well given in the higher circles in Germany. Every guest (we are not speaking of public dinners) has a sort of proc√®s verbal of the menu placed by the side of his plate. He knows then how to regulate his appetite. The table has nothing on it but epergnes full of the choicest flowers, and, as many of the ladies carry bouquets, the room is agreeably perfumed. The dishes are handed round by servants, and vanish. Your glass is never left empty by the attentive butler, who softly asks you which wine you prefer. Con- versation is not interrupted. As soon as dessert is over, all rise together, the doors of the drawing- room are thrown open, and excellent coffee and liqueurs handed round. The guest is now a free man ; the lady of the house is probably going to the opera. If you are a favourite, she may inti- mate that she expects you to look in. The men have dined well and lightly, and are not heavy with wine. All is merry as a church-bell. Another maxim : Do not let the men sit so long as is now the custom. Often have we broken through the magic circle of petticoats in the drawing-room, and always been received with pleasure for doing so.

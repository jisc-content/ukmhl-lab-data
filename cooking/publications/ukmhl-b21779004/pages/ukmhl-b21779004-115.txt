THE TURKEY. 91 spread over France ; and still in many parts of France jésuite is a familiar term for turkey. 4. That America is the only locality where the wild turkey has been found in a state of nature. There are not any in Africa. 5. That in the farms of North America, where it is very common, it is reared either from eggs which have been taken, or from wild turkeys that have been caught young and tamed ; this makes them retain more closely their primitive plumage. Convinced by these proofs, I owe a second ex- pression of gratitude to the worthy fathers for having introduced quinine, which is still known as Jesuit's bark. The same researches proved to me that thé turkey gradually becomes acclimatised in Europe. About the middle of last century scarcely ten out of twenty young birds thrived, whilst now the pro- portions are at least fifteen. Heavy rain especially is fatal to them. Heavy drops of rain driven by the wind, falling upon their tender and uncovered head, speedily kills them. The turkey is the largest, and if not the most delicate is at least the most savoury of our domes- tic fowls. It also has the exclusive advantage of assem- bling around it all classes of society.

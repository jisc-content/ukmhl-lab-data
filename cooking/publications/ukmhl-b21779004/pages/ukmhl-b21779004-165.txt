141 LA GOURMANDISE. Henceforth, then, gentle reader, remember that in these pages " gourmand " and " gourmandise " imply the refinement of the " Art of Dining." Social "gourmandise" combines the elegance of Athens with the luxury of Eome and the re- finement of Paris. It implies intellect, taste, and judgment. It is a passionate preference which grows upon man for objects which flatter his taste. Gourmandise is the very reverse of gluttony ; it is the enemy of every excess. A man who eats till he gets an indigestion, or who gets drunk, is immediately struck off the list of " gourmands." Gourmandise comprises refined taste for the most delicate dishes, even preserves and pastry. It admits women into its ranks. In whatever light you look upon it, it is deserving of praise and encouragement. In a physical point of view it is the result and proof of a healthy and perfect state of the organs destined for nutrition. In a moral point of view it is an implicit resignation to the behests of the Creator, who having ordained that we should eat to live, invites us thereto by appetite, supports us by taste, and rewards us by pleasure.

" Thus, you may with impunity dip your finger in boiling spirits of wine ; you would draw it out very quickly from brandy; still quicker from water, and a rapid immersion in boiling oil would make a cruel wound, for oil is capable of three times the heat of water. "It is consequent upon this disposition that boiling liquids act differently upon sapid bodies thrown into them.

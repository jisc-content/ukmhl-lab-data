G 3 FOOD. CHAP. VII. ON FOOD. What is food? The general definition is : Every- thing which nourishes us. The scientific definition is this: By food we mean those substances which, submitted to the stomach, are susceptible of ani- malisation by means of digestion, and repair the losses which the human body suffers from the course of life. Thus, the distinctive quality of food consists in the property of undergoing animal assimilation. The animal kingdom and the vegetable king- dom are those which have hitherto provided food to the human species. As yet, nothing has been extracted from minerals but remedies or poisons. Since analytic chemistry has become an adopted science, great steps in advance have been made in ascertaining the double nature of the elements of which the human body consists, and in dis- covering the substances which nature seems to have destined to restore the losses it sustains.

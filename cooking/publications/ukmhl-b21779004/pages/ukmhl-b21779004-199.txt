MODERN DINNERS. 175 very good capilotade de faisan aux truffes, for which dish he charges six shillings, and it gives some idea of the great addition truffles are to the table. In Sardinia and Lombardy, truffles are served up alone, fried in butter with cut lemons to squeeze over them. They are delicious. Another, and what has often struck us as a radical evil in English dinners, is that so many dishes are placed upon the table at once. Un- less our dishes are à la Russe, with spirits of wine burning under each, all the entrées are ge- nerally cold when handed to you. Moreover, nothing should be carved at table. The host gets red in the face from exertion, and cannot possibly attend to the lady he has taken down to dinner ; whilst the unfortunate man who has had the ho- nour of taking down the lady of the house is like a culprit going to execution. He has a presenti- ment going downstairs that he will have to carve two fowls smothered in white sauce ; he is seldom deceived, and gets no dinner till the third course. We are here talking of dinners in town, not family dinners. Grod forbid that our good old English custom should ever go out, or the head of the family be found sitting at home with only a table-cloth before him.

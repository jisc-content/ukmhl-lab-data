HOW TO EAT BECCA-FICAS. 103 H 4 Few men know how to eat a little bird ; I had the secret entrusted to me by Canon Charcot, a born gourmand and perfect gastronome, long be- fore the latter word was adopted. Take a fat little bird by the beak, sprinkle a little salt over it, take out the gullet, put the bird cle- verly into your mouth, bite him off close to your fingers, and chew him manfully ; the result will be an abundance of juice to envelope the whole organ, and you will enjoy a pleasure unknown to the vulgar. " Odi profanum vulgus, et arceo." â€” Hor. Amongst game proper, the quail is the most mignon and pleasant. A fat quail is pleasing by its taste, form, and colour. It is a mistake to serve up a quail otherwise than roasted, or en papillote, because its flavour evaporates quickly, and, if brought in contact with a fluid, is gone in a moment. The snipe (or woodcock) is also a good bird, but few men know how fully to appreciate its value. A snipe is never in its full glory except various works on theology and physics, in one of which he endeavours to prove that he discovered the circulation of the blood before, or at least as soon as, Harvey.

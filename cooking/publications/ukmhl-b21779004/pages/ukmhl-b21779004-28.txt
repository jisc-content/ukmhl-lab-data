4 INTRODUCTION. as commissary of the government in the depart- ment of the Seine-et-Oise, at Versailles. He held this appointment on the 18th Brumaire. Called to the Court of Cassation, Brillât Savarin passed the last twenty-five years of his life in that honourable calling, respected by his subordinates, enjoying the friendship of his equals, and the es- teem of all who knew him. Homme oVesprit, a pleasant boon-companion, full of merriment, he was the charm of every society happy enough to pos- sess him. In his leisure hours he wrote the " Physiologie du Groût "—to which he did not put his name. The success was immediate ; the natural flow of his language won him the hearts of all readers, and the severest critics were disarmed. Of manly and robust stature and health, Brillât Savarin himself, though he understood a good din- ner, lived frugally. He caught cold at the funeral of one of his friends, and with his peculiar fine appreciation of every feeling, was at once aware that he was a dying man. The best physicians of Paris were of no avail. He died with a smile on his lips, regretted by all his friends and leaviug behind him the remarkable work, which we place before the reader, as a monument to his memory.

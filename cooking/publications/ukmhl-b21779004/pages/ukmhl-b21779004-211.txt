A LUNCHEON. 187 Let no one leave before eleven, but let every one be in bed by midnight. I have said that the pleasures of the table were susceptible of long duration ; I will prove it by a little anecdote, true and circumstantial, of the longest repast I ever made in my life. It is a little bon-bon I slip into the reader's mouth for having read me attentively so far. A family, relations of mine, lived in the Eue du Bac, consisting of a doctor, aged seventy-eight, a captain, seventy-six, and their sister Jeannette, seventy-four. I sometimes paid them a visit, and was always well received. " Parbleu ! " said Dr. Dubois to me one day, rising on his toes to reach my shoulder, " you have long been praising your fondues (eggs beaten up with cheese) to us, making our mouths water ; it is time to put an end to it. We will come and breakfast with you some day, the captain and I, and see what they are like." "Willingly," I replied, " and you shall have one in all its glory, for I shall make it myself. Your proposal has given me great pleasure. I expect you to-morrow at ten â€” military punctuality."

A DINNER AT NEW-YORK. 207 " Oh ! certainly." The cook broke*- the eggs into the dripping-pan. As soon as he turned his back, I maliciously drew my travelling-knife, and made two or three incisions in the roast to allow the juice to flow more freely.

A DINNER AT NEW-YORK* During my sojourn at New-York (says Savarin), I sometimes used to spend my evenings at a coffee- house and tavern, kept by one Little, who gave turtle-soup in the morning, and in the evening the refreshments customary in the United States. I was generally accompanied by Viscount de la Massue and Jean Eodolphe Fehr, formerly a broker at Marseilles, both émigrés like myself.

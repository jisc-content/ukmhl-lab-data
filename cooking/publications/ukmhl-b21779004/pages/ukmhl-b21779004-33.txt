THE PHILOSOPHICAL HISTORY OF EATING. 9 CHAP. II. THE PHILOSOPHICAL HISTORY OP EATING. Cookery is the most ancient art, for Adam was born fasting, and the new-born babe that has scarcely entered the world cries until it is calmed by its mother's breast. It is also the art which has rendered the most important service to civil society ; for it is cookery which has brought into play the application of fire, and it is by fire that man has subjugated nature. Taking a general view, cookery may be divided into three branches : The first refers to the preparation of food, and maintains its original appellation ; The second is occupied with analysing and verifying the elements of food, and is called Chemistry ; The third, which might be called cuisine de r√©paration, is known under the name of Pharmacy.

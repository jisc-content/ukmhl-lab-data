HANDBOOK. OF DINING. 48 times he had a custom peculiar to himself. When he knew that a company of rich men were dining together in his salon, he would present himself, pay his respects to them, point out the best dishes to them, tell them which dish ought to be eaten first, &c. He would then send up some dish unknown to them, and a bottle of wine from his own private cellar, of which he alone kept the key. All this was done with so much courtesy that it appeared that these little extras were gratuitous. But this part of the Amphitryon was only momentary; he soon vanished, and the addition to the bill and bitterness of the " quart d'heure " of Eabelais sufficiently convinced the guests that they had been dining at a restaurateur's. Beauvilliers made, spent, and remade his fortune more than once. Whether he died rich or poor is not known, but he had so many calls upon him it is not likely he left a large inheritance. The examination of the carte at a first-rate restaurateur's will show that the man who enters to dine has the choice for his dinner of at least : — 12 soups. 12 of pastry. 24 hors d'œuvre. 24 of fish. 15 or 20 entrées of heef. 15 roasts. 20 entrees of mutton. 50 entrémets. 30 entrées of game or fowl. 50 of dessert. 16 or 20 of veal.

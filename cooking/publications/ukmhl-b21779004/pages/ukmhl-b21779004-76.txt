HANDBOOK OP DINING. 52 Smell to the discovery and cultivation of per- fumes. Taste to the production, selection, and pre- paration of every species of food. Touch gave birth to every branch of industry. A man who has dined at a sumptuous table, in a hall resplendent with mirrors, pictures, statuary, flowers, delicate perfumes, adorned with beautiful women, and enlivened by the sound of soft music will not need much mental effort to be convinced that all the sciences have been placed under con- tribution to heighten and crown the enjoyments of taste. Taste is that one of our senses which brings us in contact with sapid substances, through the medium of the sensation they produce upon the organ destined to appreciate them. Taste is aroused by appetite, hunger, and thirst; it is the basis of many operations, the result of which is that the individual grows, developes, lives, and repairs the losses caused by vital eva- porations. All organised bodies are not nourished in the same manner ; the author of creation, as diverse in his methods as he is sure in their effect, has as- signed to them various means of conservation.

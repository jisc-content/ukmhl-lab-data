51 THE SENSES. E 2 that the first sensations were purely direct, that is to say that man saw without precision, heard con- fusedly, smelt without discernment, eat without savour, and was in fact little better than a brute in all his enjoyments. But as all these sensations have the soul as a common centre—the especial distinction of the human species—and the ever active cause of a striving towards perfection, they became modified, swayed by judgment and comparison, and soon all the senses came to the aid of each other for the benefit of the sensitive being or individual. Thus the sense of touch rectified the errors of sight; sound, by means of articulated words, be- came the interpreter of every sentiment; taste became benefited by sight and smell; hearing compared sounds and appreciated distances. The torrent of centuries rolling over the human race has incessantly engendered new perfections, the cause of which, though almost invisible, is to be found in the play of the senses, which, in rotation, exact agreeable employment. Thus sight gave rise to painting, sculpture, and all sorts of displays. Sound gave birth to melody, to harmony, to dance, and music, and all their branches.

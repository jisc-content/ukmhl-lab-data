Opinions of the Press. Mr.Forester's Rambles are very amusing, »l deal of information r< 'nties, and present condition of niation which the reader could not easily find elsewhere in so readable a form." Literary Gazette. " Accompanied by a military friend, with Mr. Forester traversed the two islands .Corsica and Sardinia, from north to south, wth, but both in the frame of [lowing with exuberant beauty, •st impressions of the interior nation Many such remarked by those who take in Forester'sentertaining story of Rambles nds of the Tuscan Sea." Athen.i um . ■anhin versatility of nh. very high position in literature ; but after perusal of its contents, and an examination of i artistic illustrations, we feel assured that as history or descriptive sketch of lands hitherto bi partially known, whereof the customs have be< almost wholly unnoticed, these Hamhles wi awaken general interest, and their publicatit be attended with important national results." John Bull. Mr. Fc îter's book is in all res .ant lithographs bring new Dur eyes, and new glimpsi of the hundred little penci tion evinced by our author, who, with with accuracy, thoroughly never bores We might select volume, since it yields abundant mantic adventurer, the anti- f science, and the artist. Were k to be judged of only by its ths connexion between aborigi- e islands, it would assume a narrative more fresh and agreeable than has lately come before us. Almost the entire island is de- scribed at once in a style vivid and simple, and tions. In Sardinia, though the ground is not so untrodden, Mr. Forester was enabled by his prac- tice of striking into the seclusions of the country, beyond the limits of ordinary travel, to possess himself of much remarkable information, espe- cially in connexion with the revival of ps»gan man- ners and rites among the people—a circumstance which has been particularly noticed in France. Concerning both islands, Mr. Forester interweaves his narrative sprringly and judiciously with frag- ments of history, which have nowhere the charac- ter of digressions. He has related a few local stories which cast much light on the social life of the Corsicans especially A volume of travel so original and varied as Mr. Forester's is a rarity in our days."

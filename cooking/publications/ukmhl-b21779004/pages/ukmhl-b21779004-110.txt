HANDBOOK OF DINING. 86 There is great analogy between these studies, as man consists in a great measure of the same substances as the animals upon which he feeds, and it became necessary to endeavour to discover in vegetables those affinities in consequence of which they also became susceptible of animali- sation. In these two branches the most praiseworthy, and at the same time most minute investigations have been undertaken, and an analysis has been made as well of the human body as of the food which sustains it, first in their secondary depart- ments and then in their elements, beyond which there is a veil which we have not been allowed to penetrate. The greatest service rendered by chemistry to alimentary science is the discovery, or rather the precise knowledge obtained, of "osmazome." Osmazome is that eminently sapid portion of meat which is soluble in cold water, and which differs from that extractive portion which is only soluble in boiling water. The merit of a good soup or broth consists in osmazome. It forms the brown (rissole) on roasts, the rich gravy; it gives the flavour to venison and other game.

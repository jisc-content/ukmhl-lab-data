101 GAME. H 3 The first commences with the thrush, and com- prises all lesser birds. The second ranges higher, commencing with the corn-crake, then snipe, woodcock, partridge, pheasant, rabbit and hare. This is real game. The third is better known as venison ; it com- prises the wild-boar, roe, deer, and all others of the hoof-footed species. Grame forms the charm of our dinners; it is wholesome, warm, savoury, of fine flavour, and easy of digestion to all young persons. But these qualities are not so inherent as not to require some skill in their preparation. Throw into a pot a handful of salt, some water, and a piece of beef; you will have boiled beef and broth. If, instead of beef, you throw in wild-boar or venison, the beef will be far the best of the three. But, in the hands of a clever cook, game under- goes a great many learned modifications and trans- formations, and provides the majority of the high savoury dishes which constitute cc transcendent cookery."

Let your dishes be limited in number, but each excellent, and your wines first-rate. Let the for- mer vary from the most substantial to the most light ; and for the second, from the strongest to the most perfumed. Let everything be served quietly, without hurry or bustle ; dinner being the last business of the day. Let your guests look upon themselves as travellers who have arrived at the end of their journey. Let the coffee be very hot, and the liqueurs first quality. Let your drawing-room be spacious enough to allow a game to be played, if desired, without interfering with those addicted to chatting. Let the guests be retained by the pleasant com- pany, and cheered with the hope that, before the evening is over, there is something good still in store for them. Let the tea not be too strong; the hot toast well buttered ; and the punch carefully mixed.

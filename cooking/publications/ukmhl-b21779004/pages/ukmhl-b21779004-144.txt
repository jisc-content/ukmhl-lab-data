S did full justice to it. On reaching home he was taken with violent spasms. A doctor was sent for, and the symptoms became so serious that some alarm was felt. Suddenly nature came to the rescue. He opened his mouth and shot out a fragment of truffle intact, which bounded back from the wall. The bad symptoms ceased immediately. Poor S 's teeth, which had been doing service for many years, were not quite up to their work ; some had emigrated and others were not so firm as they should have been. The fragment had stuck in the pylorus. There was no indigestion. He fell into a comfort- able sleep, was perfectly well next day, and attacked truffles with as much energy afterwards as ever, taking care, however, to masticate them more carefully. ยง

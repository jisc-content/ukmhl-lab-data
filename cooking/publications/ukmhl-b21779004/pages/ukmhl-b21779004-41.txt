ATHENIAN BANQUETS. 17 with purple, every art was brought into requisition to satisfy the senses. The good cheer was height- ened by agreeable converse, and dining be- came a science. After the third course singers were introduced, and conversation relaxed. The songs were not exclusively devoted to the gods and heroes ; more tender subjects were introduced; love and friendship were sung with a harmony to which our dry and severe language can never attain. The wines of Greece, which we still esteem as excellent, had been examined and classified by the gourmets of the day, from the sweetest to the strongest. At some banquets each wine was passed in succession, and, contrary to modern taste, the size of the glasses increased in proportion to the quality of the wine poured out. Beautiful women added a charm to these volup- tuous meetings. Dances and games enlivened the evening. Attractions attacked every sense ; many a disciple of Plato left under the banner of Epicurus. Learned men devoted their pen to describe these enjoyments. Most of their writings are lost, but one is most to be regrettedâ€”a book on gastronomy by Achestrades, a friend of one of the sons of Pericles. c

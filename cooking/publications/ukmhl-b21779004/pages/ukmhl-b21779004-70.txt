46 HANDBOOK OF DINING. dinner party, to point out the men who usually dine at a restaurateur's. We said that the institution of restaurateurs was of high importance to science. In fact, as soon as experience proved that a single well made ragout sufficed to make the fortune of an inventor, interest, that powerful agent, fired the imagination, and sharpened the wits of the purveyors. Analysis discovered esculent properties in sub- stances formerly discarded as useless ; new articles of food were discovered ; ancient ones were im- proved, and both were combined in a variety of ways. Foreign inventions were imported ; the uni- verse was placed under contribution ; and we have seen dinners which might have provided the mate- rial for a whole course of alimentary geography. There are a few names deserving of historical mention as restaurateurs ; Beauvilliers, Méot, Robert, Rose, Legacque, Very, Henneveu, and Baleine. Some of them owe their reputation to peculiar dishes. The Frères Provençaux made a fortune on cod-fish with garlic * ; Very was strong * This dish would scarcely have pleased Horace.

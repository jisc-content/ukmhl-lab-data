MEEIVALE, B.D., LATE FELLOW OF ST. JOHN'S COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE. Vol. VI. from the Reign of NERO to the Destruction of JERUSALEM. Opinions of Volume the Sixth. "The period upon which the latest historian of Imperial Rome has entered in his sixth volume, possesses peculiar interest at present, from the variety and vividness of the details no less than its pregnant facts and ominous analogies To English readers the opening scene of the History is specially attractive, setting forth the second great invasion of Britain The story as told by Mr. Merivale gives us. in picturesque and vivid chapters, details of the history of the early Christian times, as far a9 the de- struction of Jerusalem, with which the work concludes." Athenaeum. "The sixth volume commences with a chapter on the pacification of Gaul by Claudius and the subjugation of Britain ; re- turning to Rome, it conducts us through the reigns of Nero, Galba, Otho V'itellius, and Vespasian ; and concludes with the destruc- tion of Jerusalem by Titus, and his Judaean triumph. English literature and scholar- ship may well be proud of this masterly work, in every way worthy to take its place between Arnold and Gibbon. The unin- structed reader who runs glibly over the brilliant text of this history will form no adequate conception of the vast and various labour, the deep and comprehensive learn- ing, the patient and laborious investigation, the correct and ample scholarship, which have fitted the historian for the accomplish- ment of a splendid purpose. Sometimes into half a dozen words is compressed the reading of as many ancient historians and modern critics ; and the style is like the quintessence of the great originals whom the author cites in the footnotes, at once weighty and bril- liant, terse and full, severe and elegant, polished and unforced. We shall return to the volume in detail." Leader. " The sixth volume includes the reigns of Nero, Galba, Vitellius, Vespasian, and vespasia nificant if mea- Titus—filling a period ins suredby years, but unparalleled in its illus- tration ot imperialism as carried to its climax in Rome. We have never seen so full or lucid a presentation of Nero's career. It formed no part of Gibbon's plan to draw the full-length effigy of that tyrant. Suetonius, garrulous as he is, supplies only a fragmen- tary account; but Mr. Merivale, drawing from every source of authority, tempering traditionary statements by criticism, and working his materials into aconsistent shape, has written the best biography of Nero in existence. This alone would confer upon the new volume of his history a conspicuous and permanent importance ; but there are other episodes of deep interest upon which he has thrown a strong and clear light—the Clau- dian policy in Gaul, the suppression of the Druid hierarchy, the subjugation of Britain, the insurrection of Boadicea and the Iceni, as preliminaries to the operation of that great curse which gave the Romans to Nero during fourteen infamous and miserable years. After his fall, the stormy reign of Galba, the brief Btruggle of Otho, roused from voluptuousness to empire, the supre- macy of the glutton Vitellius, the c vil wai- led by Vespasian, the provincial revolts, the Fla- vian conspiracies, and the concentration of the Roman power against Jerusalem, fill man v pages ; but the moral of the narrative is nowfi velopeil in a form so imposing as in tin- ii Nero. The scene of his death is described in one of the most remarkable chapters we have i • many years A r.enturvof imperiahVm rendered ten with a singular strength and polish of style, is a work w hich the youth of Enalanrt may study with confidence and with admiration."

Call No. 1 • ~TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE. There was commotion in Olympus in January, 1859. Venus, Minerva, and Juno whispered together so long that at last the attention of Jupiter was attracted. " What is the matter ? " exclaimed the father of gods and men. " Poor little Grasterea is in a great way," said Venus eagerly, " and wishes to be admitted to an audience ; Juno says she has no business here, as in her circle she gives nothing but nectar and ambrosia, and I cannot convince her that Grasterea has no intention of reforming our repasts." Now, be it known, Venus and Grasterea have a secret treaty between them, — offensive and de- fensive, — in case a third power, called " Ennui," should encroach upon the territory of either. Thus, Gasterea has always a voice at the Imperial Court. A 4translator's preface. viii " I have not seen the child," said Jupiter, " for a long time. Show her in ! " Venus vanished, and soon reappeared, leading by the hand as fair a specimen of the demi- goddess as mortal or celestial eye ever beheld. Nearly as tall as Venus, with laughing eye, rounded limbs, golden hair, in natural waves that might make Hebe jealous, a pouting coral lip set off by teeth of pearls, she knelt at the feet of Jupiter. He raised her gently, and kissed her forehead. Juno whistled to her peacock, and left the cloud upon which she had been reclining. "Speak, my child," said Jupiter, patting her cheek ; " what is wrong ? Whatever the cause, we are glad to see you. You are wonderfully improved : one day, perhaps, you shall have a seat here, near Venus, and a temple of your own." Thus encouraged, Grasterea told her piteous tale : " There is a race," she said, " of bold sea-girt islanders who worship me well in their way ; in- deed, mighty fires of coal never cease to burn in my honour; but it is a melancholy fact, that London does not know c How to Dine !9 " "Leave England alone," replied Jupiter, "ittranslator's preface. ix is a hospitable land, the last refuge of Liberty. If the fate of nations depends upon how they are fed, England must live well. Even now, my dis- cerning glance can see a ship with a noble freight of patriots steering for her shores, and they will receive a hearty welcome from your island wor- shippers. They are a hardy and honourable race, those sons of Britain, the compensating balance of the political world." " It is precisely on this account that I wish to improve their dinners," retorted the pert maiden. "They eat too much, and they drink too much, which is worse ; and their dinners are monotonous. They want Eeform ! But here is my Reform Bill." "Which," hastily added Jupiter, "I will read at my leisure ; " and he gave it to his eagle. "Meantime, what can I do to further your views ? " " Send Mercury to touch with his wand, imbued with the magic spirit of Dinner-Reform, any one of the houses you see between these two letters," exclaimed Gasterea, pointing to W. and S. W. on the new postal district map, " and you will see the result." " I will do more," said the father of the gods,x translator's preface. " he shall touch, the dwelling of my great confrere, whose sway below equals mine here, and whose thunder shall be heard." So said, so done. Obedient to the Olympian nod, Mercury pre- pared for flight : " He said ; and straight, with zealous ardour prest, Mercury prepares t' obey his Lord's behest. He clothes his heavenly form with ether light, And makes it visible to human sight ; In shape and limbs like one of earthly race, But brightly shining with celestial grace ; Of youth he seem'd in manhood's ripening years, On the smooth cheek when first the down appears ; Refulgent rays his beauteous looks unfold, White are his nimble wings and edg'd with gold. With these through winds and clouds he cuts his way, Flies o'er the land and skims along the sea. Thus stood bold Mercury, prepar'd for flight, Then instant darted from th' empyreal height; Direct to London, now, his course he bent, There closed his plumes, and made a safe descent."* On the following morning, as all our readers are aware, the columns of the London newspapers teemed with letters on dinner-giving.

From North to South, from East to West, let- ters poured in. England was resolved to learn "How to Dine." Grasterea was satisfied. Once again, through the interest of Venus, she was admitted to express her thanks to Jupiter. " I have still one favour to ask," said the voluptuous Queen of Gastronomy. 66 One of my most devoted worshippers lies buried on the banks of the Seine. He understood me well, and out of gratitude I plant the earliest flowers on his grave. Let the shade of Savarin be invoked ! " It was done.

(Condensed from Savarin.) Considering the pleasures of the table under all their aspects, it struck me forcibly that the sub- ject was worthy of something better than an ordi- nary cookery-book, and that there was a wide field to examine into essential and necessary func- tions, which have so direct an influence on the health and happiness of man, and even upon his affairs. This idea having assumed form and shape, the remainder came naturally. I looked around me, made notes; and often, in the midst of a sumptuous banquet, the pleasure of observation saved me from the ennuis of the dinner. It is true, to carry out my idea, some know- ledge of medicine, chemistry, physiology, and even a little learning was requisite. But without ever dreaming of becoming an author, I hadxiv PREFACE. studied those various branches in my youth, from a very praiseworthy desire of being able to con- verse with the various men I might meet in society, and not be behind my century. I often entertained a doubt my book might be tedious, and make other men yawn as I often have yawned over other men's books. I have done all in my power not to deserve such a re- proach. I have passed lightly over tedious sub- jects ; the anecdotes related are in many instances personal ; I have left untouched a number of ex- traordinary and singular facts which sound criti- cism rejects ; I have awakened attention by making clear and popular certain facts which savans seemed inclined to reserve to themselves. If, despite these efforts, I have served up an indiges- tible banquet, I shall not sleep the less sound with the conscience of having earned the appro- bation of the majority. I do not, however, wish to be thought a Com- piler ; had I been reduced so low, my pen should not have been taken up, and I should not have lived less happily on that account. I said with Juvenal : " Semper ego auditor tantum ! nunquamne reponam."XV PREFACE. And those who know me are aware that I am as accustomed to the tumult of society as to the privacy of the cabinet. Finally, when I speak in the singular, " I," let the reader remember I am conversing with him, but when I make use of the pronoun "We," I profess and exact subjection : " I am Sir Oracle, And when I ope my lips, let no dog bark."

INTRODUCTION. As stated in the title-page, the following volume is based upon the " Physiologie du Grout," of Brillât Savarin ; a work unrivalled in its peculiar sphere. Many parts are, however, condensed, others omitted, as not suited to the present tone of society. It is curious that a translation of this remarkable book has not long since been made. An article in the "Quarterly," which appeared some years since, founded, if we err not, on Savarin's work, for a moment drew attention to an effusion which may be placed on the same shelf with Eousseau, Voltaire, or the political economy of Bastiat. It is, in fact, not a cookery-book; it is a brilliant treatise (as the title, " Physiologie du Grout," implies) on gas- tronomy or the art of eating, regarded in all its 3> b2 INTRODUCTION. branches. Some of the anecdotes are most amus- ing ; some of the ideas most instructive ; the work a masterpiece in its way. The art of dining is quite distinct from the art of giving dinners ; but no person can read through these pages without coming to the conclusion that gastronomy is a science well worthy the study of persons of intel- lect of both sexes ; and it will lead them to the conviction, that a little more study in the selection of their dishes, the management of their kitchen, and due attention to the comfort of their guests, will enhance tenfold the pleasures of the table, and make their dinners select. Keform in dinner-giving is on the tapis, and we trust it will not be dropped. A move has been made in the right direction. Savarin's Aphorisms in the first chapter contain, pretty nearly, all the general rules to be observed. There are a few passages somewhat free—but, gentle reader, skip them over—they are only pop- pies in a corn-field—dandelions on the same bank as the blue-eyed violet. A brief sketch of Brillât Savarin himself may not prove uninteresting. Anthelme Brillât Savarin was born on the 1st April, 1755, at Belley, a small town at the foot ofINTRODUCTION. 3 the Alps, not far from the Khône, where that river marks the boundary between France and Savoy. He was called to the bar at an early age, and prac- tised with distinction. In 1789 he was returned by his fellow-citizens, member for his native place to the Constituent Assembly. He was subsequently appointed President of the Civil Tribune of the Department de l'Ain. An upright magistrate, his amiable and conciliating manners gained the es- teem of all who came in contact with him. As mayor of Belley, in 1793, he boldly resisted every attempt at anarchy, and for some time warded off the Eeign of Terror from his native place. He was ultimately compelled to fly to Switzerland. He subsequently crossed the Atlantic, and spent two years at New York. He gave lessons in French to earn a livelihood, and being an excellent musi- cian, performed nightly in the orchestra of the theatre. In after life, Brillât Savarin always re- called this period of his career with pleasure. As soon as something like quiet was restored to France, Brillât Savarin returned to his native land. He landed at Havre, in the first days of Vendemaire, year v. (September 1796). Under the Directory, he was employed, first, as secretary to the staff of the army of the Eepublic in Germany, afterwards B24 INTRODUCTION. as commissary of the government in the depart- ment of the Seine-et-Oise, at Versailles. He held this appointment on the 18th Brumaire. Called to the Court of Cassation, Brillât Savarin passed the last twenty-five years of his life in that honourable calling, respected by his subordinates, enjoying the friendship of his equals, and the es- teem of all who knew him. Homme oVesprit, a pleasant boon-companion, full of merriment, he was the charm of every society happy enough to pos- sess him. In his leisure hours he wrote the " Physiologie du Groût "—to which he did not put his name. The success was immediate ; the natural flow of his language won him the hearts of all readers, and the severest critics were disarmed. Of manly and robust stature and health, Brillât Savarin himself, though he understood a good din- ner, lived frugally. He caught cold at the funeral of one of his friends, and with his peculiar fine appreciation of every feeling, was at once aware that he was a dying man. The best physicians of Paris were of no avail. He died with a smile on his lips, regretted by all his friends and leaviug behind him the remarkable work, which we place before the reader, as a monument to his memory.APHORISMS. CHAPTER I. APHORISMS. The universe without life would be nothing, and all that lives must be fed. ii. Animals feed ; man eats ; the man of intellect alone knows how to eat. m. The fate of nations depends upon how they are fed. IV. Tell me what you eat, I will tell you what you are. v. The Creator in making it obligatory on man to eat to live, invites him thereto by appetite, and rewards him by the pleasure he experiences. B 36 HANDBOOK OF DINING. VI. Grood living is an act of our judgment, by which we give a preference to things agreeable to taste, to those which do not possess that quality. VII. The pleasures of the table are for all ages, all conditions, all countries, and of great variety; they are the concomitants of all other pleasures, and when all the rest are gone, they remain to console us for their loss. VIII. The dinner-table is the only place where men are not bored during the first hour. The discovery of a new dish does more for the happiness of mankind, than the discovery of a new planet. Men who eat hastily or get drunk do not know how to eat or drink. . I ] /■APHOKISMS. XI. Comestibles vary from the most substantial to the most light. XII. Beverages range from the mildest to the strongest and most delicately flavoured. XIII. To say that a man ought not to vary his wine is heresy : the palate becomes deadened ; after the third glass the finest wine in the world becomes insipid. XIV. A dinner without cheese is like a pretty woman with only one eye. xv. Cookery is a science. No man is born a cook. XVI. The most indispensable qualification of a cook is punctuality. The same must be said of guests. B 4HANDBOOK OF DINING. s XVII. To wait too long for a guest is a breach of politeness towards all who have arrived punctually. XVIII. A man who invites friends to dinner, and takes no personal interest in his dinner, is not worthy of friendship. XIX. The lady of the house should always take care that the coffee is excellent ; and the master of the house should be sure that the liqueurs are of the first quality. XX. When you invite a man to dinner, never forget that during the short time he is under your roof his happiness is in your hands.THE PHILOSOPHICAL HISTORY OF EATING. 9 CHAP. II. THE PHILOSOPHICAL HISTORY OP EATING. Cookery is the most ancient art, for Adam was born fasting, and the new-born babe that has scarcely entered the world cries until it is calmed by its mother's breast. It is also the art which has rendered the most important service to civil society ; for it is cookery which has brought into play the application of fire, and it is by fire that man has subjugated nature. Taking a general view, cookery may be divided into three branches : The first refers to the preparation of food, and maintains its original appellation ; The second is occupied with analysing and verifying the elements of food, and is called Chemistry ; The third, which might be called cuisine de réparation, is known under the name of Pharmacy.10 HANDBOOK OF DININGr. If their end is different, they nevertheless are connected by the application of fire, by the use of furnaces and of the same utensils. Thus the same piece of beef which is converted by the cook into soup or roast, is examined by the chemist to ascertain into how many substances it may be divided, whilst the apothecary cures us should it perchance be indigestible. Man is an omnivorous animal : he has incisive teeth to eat fruit, molar teeth to mash grain, and canine teeth to tear flesh : hence the observation that man approaches nearer the savage the more his canine teeth are developed and easily discernible. It is extremely probable that for some time the species was frugivorous from necessity, for man is the most unprotected animal of the whole world, and his means of attack limited unless armed. But the instinct of progress in-born in his nature soon developed itself: the very knowledge of his weakness induced him to fabricate weapons of defence : his carnivorous instinct represented by his canine teeth also urged him; and once armed, he preyed and fed upon all animals around him. This instinct of destructiveness still exists; children seldom fail to kill the little animals that11 RAW MEAT. are left at their mercy ; if they were hungry they would eat them. It is not surprising that man should have a de- sire to eat flesh: his stomach is too small, and fruit does not contain sufficient nourishment to satisfy him ; vegetables would be better ; but such a diet would imply inventions which it required centuries to perfect. The first weapons of man were doubtless branches of trees, later bows and arrows. It is well worthy of remark that wherever man has been discovered, no matter in what climate or what latitude, he has always been found armed with bows and arrows. It is difficult to explain this uniformity. We cannot understand how the same series of ideas should have presented itself to individuals under such different circumstances ; it must proceed from a cause hidden behind the curtain of ages. Eaw meat has one inconvenience : it sticks in the teeth : with this exception it is not disagree- able to taste ; seasoned with a little salt, it digests easily, and must be more nourishing than any other food. " Mein Grott ! " said a captain of Croats to me in 1815, whom I had invited to dinner, "why so muchHANDBOOK OF DINING. 12 trouble about a repast? When we are on scout- duty and are hungry, we shoot the first animal that crosses our path, we cut off a slice to our liking, sprinkle a little salt and pepper on it, of which we always carry a provision in our sabre- tasche, we place it under the saddle on the horse's back, set' off at a hand gallop, and (making the movement of a man tearing meat with his teeth) gnian, gnian, gnian, we dine like princes." In the Dauphiné, if a sportsman shoots a corn- crake, he plucks it, rubs it inside with salt and pepper, carries it in his cap, and, when hungry, eats it. They maintain that it is much better eating thus than roasted. Moreover, if our great-grandfathers did eat their food raw, we have not yet quite given up the habit. The most delicate palate will eat dried sausages, smoked beef and ham, anchovies, dried herrings that have never been on the fire, and like them all the same. As soon as the properties of fire were discovered, the instinct of perfection made man apply it to food ; first to dry it, then by placing it on hot embers, to cook it. Flesh thus handled was found better ; it had more consistency, was more easily chewed, and13 ACHILLES'S DINNER TO ULYSSES the osmazôme (essence of the meat) becoming fluid, gave it a savoury flavour which was pleasing to the palate. However, it was soon discovered that meat grilled on coals was not free from being soiled, as a portion of cinder generally adhered to it. This was remedied by sticking it on skewers, which were placed on raised stones at a sufficient height to prevent contact with the embers. This was the origin of the gridiron, a most simple and excellent invention, because the meat thus cooked always retains its flavour. In Homer's days matters were not much more advanced. Behold how Achilles received three of the noblest amongst the Greeks, one of whom was a king : — " With that, the Chiefs beneath his roof he led, And plac'd in seats with purple carpets spread. Then thus:—Patroclus, crown a larger bowl, Mix purer wine, and open every soul. Of all the warriors yonder host can send, Thy friend most honours these, and these thy friend. He said ; Patroclus o'er the blazing fire, Heaps in a brazen vase three chines entire : The brazen vase Automedon sustains, Which flesh of porket, sheep, and goat contains : Achilles at the genial feast presides, The parts transfixes, and with skill divides. Meanwhile Patroclus sweats the fire to raise ; The tent is lighten'd with the rising blaze ;14 HANDBOOK OF DINING. Then, when the languid flames at length subside, He throws a bed of glowing embers wide, Above the coals the smoking fragments turns, And sprinkles sacred salt from lifted urns. With bread the glittering canisters they load, Which round the board Menœtius' son bestow'd ; Himself opposed t' Ulysses full in sight, Each portion parts, and orders every rite. The first fat offerings, to th' Immortals due, Amidst the greedy flames Patroclus threw ; Then each, indulging in the social feast, His thirst and hunger soberly represt. That done, to Phœnix Ajax gave the sign ; Not unperceiv'd ; Ulysses crown'd with wine The foaming bowl, and instant thus began, His speech addressing to the god-like man : Health to Achilles," &c. Iliad, Canto IX. Pope's Translation. That Achilles and Patroclus should themselves have prepared the repast, is an exceptional case out of honour to their illustrious guests, for the duties of the kitchen generally fell to the lot of the women and slaves. Here we have the fact of a king, the son of a king, and three Greek generals making an ex- cellent dinner on bread, wine, and a grill. The bowels of animals, stuffed with blood and fat, formed a favourite dish of the Greeks. It was nothing more than sausage. At this period, and doubtless long before, poetryFLESH-POTS. 15 and music were associated with the pleasures of the table. Venerable bards sang the wonders of nature, the loves of the gods, and the noble deeds of warriors ; they formed a sort of priesthood, and it is not impossible that the divine Homer him- self may have been the issue of one of those favoured men of Heaven; he could not have attained so high a position if his poetical studies had not commenced in his childhood. Madame Dacier observes that Homer never speaks of boiled beef in any portion of his work. The Hebrews were more advanced, owing to their sojourn in Egypt; they had cooking utensils which they placed on the fire, and it was in such a utensil that Jacob made the mess of porridge he sold so dear to his brother Esau. It is difficult to ascertain how man first learnt to forge metal. I have never been able to ascer- tain how the first pair of pincers and the first hammer were fabricated. Cookery made a great step in advance as soon as vessels of metal or of clay could be fabricated to resist the action of fire. It became easy to season meat, to boil vegetables ; soup, gravy, jelly became the natural results consequent thereon.HANDBOOK OF DINING. 16 The most ancient writers speak of the banquets of the kings of the East. It is easily imagined that monarchs reigning over lands rich in every produce, especially in perfumes and spices, should maintain a sumptuous table ; but details are wanting. We only know that Cadmus, who introduced the art of writing into Greece, was formerly cook to the King of Sidon. It was amongst these voluptuous and sensual rulers that was first introduced the custom of lying on beds round the dinner-table, and of eating in a recumbent posture. This refinement was not universally well re- ceived. The more warlike nations, who prized manly courage and looked upon frugality as a virtue, rejected it for a long time; but it was finally adopted at Athens and in the civilised world. The Athenians, men of elegant taste and eager for novelty, soon became adepts in the art of cookery. Kings, poets, financiers, litterateurs, made most of the bountiful gifts of nature. If we are to credit ancient writers, their ban- quets were great festivals. Fish and game were always to be had, though the demand made prices run high. Keclining on couches coveredATHENIAN BANQUETS. 17 with purple, every art was brought into requisition to satisfy the senses. The good cheer was height- ened by agreeable converse, and dining be- came a science. After the third course singers were introduced, and conversation relaxed. The songs were not exclusively devoted to the gods and heroes ; more tender subjects were introduced; love and friendship were sung with a harmony to which our dry and severe language can never attain. The wines of Greece, which we still esteem as excellent, had been examined and classified by the gourmets of the day, from the sweetest to the strongest. At some banquets each wine was passed in succession, and, contrary to modern taste, the size of the glasses increased in proportion to the quality of the wine poured out. Beautiful women added a charm to these volup- tuous meetings. Dances and games enlivened the evening. Attractions attacked every sense ; many a disciple of Plato left under the banner of Epicurus. Learned men devoted their pen to describe these enjoyments. Most of their writings are lost, but one is most to be regretted—a book on gastronomy by Achestrades, a friend of one of the sons of Pericles. c18 HANDBOOK OF DINING. "That great writer (says Théotimus).travelled by land and sea to discover where what was most delicate for the table was produced. In his travels he did not attempt to change the customs of the people, because he knew it would be labour lost, but he entered their kitchens, and only visited men devoted to pleasure. His poem is a gem of science, and every line a precept." Such was the state of cookery in Greece, which was maintained until a handful of men who had settled on the banks of the Tiber spread their dominion, first over their neighbours, and finally conquered the world. (rood cheer was unknown or discarded by the Eomans as long as they had to fight for their independence or to conquer their neighbours, poor and hardy like themselves. Their generals did not disdain to put their hand to the plough or to dine off vegetables. Historians are not wanting who have praised those primitive times when frugality was deemed a virtue. But when their conquests extended to Africa, to Sicily, to Greece,— when they had re- galed themselves at the expense of the vanquished, in lands where civilisation was more advanced,— they translated to Eome what had pleased them19 EOMAN BANQUETS. c 2 in foreign parts, and there is every reason to believe that the new introductions were well received. The Eomans had sent a deputation to Athens to bring back the laws of Solon. They went again to study literature and philosophy. Whilst polishing their manners, they became acquainted with the pleasures of the table ; and with orators, philosophers, rhetoricians, and poets—Cooks ar- rived at Eome. In time, when Eome became the centre of the riches of the world, the luxury of the table was carried to a degree almost incredible. From the locust to the ostrich, from the dormouse to the wild boar, everything was tasted. " Œires isicio porcino, item pulpis ex omni glirium membro tritis, cum pipere, nuclseis, lasere, liquamine, farcies glires, et sutos in tegulâ positos, mittes in furnum, aut farsos in clibaro coques." The dormouse was esteemed as a delicacy. Sometimes scales were placed on the table to verify its weight. Martial wrote an epigram on the subject,— " Tota mihi dormitur hyems, et pinguior illo Tempore sum, quo me nil nisi somnus alit." The whole world was placed under contributionHANDBOOK OF DINING. 20 by armies and travellers. Truffles and guinea- fowls were imported from Africa, rabbits from Spain, pheasants from Greece, and peacocks from the remotest parts of Asia. The opulent Eomans vied with each other in the glory of having beautiful gardens, where they cultivated not only the fruits formerly known, as apples, pears, figs and grapes, but fruits introduced from foreign lands, as the apricot from Armenia, the peach from Persia, the quince from Sidon, strawberries from the valleys of Mount Ida, and the cherry the conquest of Lucullus in Pontus. These importations, which necessarily took place under various circumstances, prove, at least, that the impulse was general, and that every man had it at heart to contribute to the enjoyments of the people-king. Fish was an especial object of luxury. Pre- ferences were established for certain sorts; and those preferences increased for fish caught in cer- tain waters. Fish from distant lands was brought to Eome in pots of honey; and when the specimens were of unusual dimensions, they fetched enormous prices, in consequence of the competition of in- dividuals many of whom were richer than kings. Nor was less care bestowed on beverages. The21 WINES. wines of Greece, of Sicily, of Italy were the de- light of the Komans; and, as their price varied either according to the vineyard or the year of vintage, a sort of certificate of birth was engraven on each amphora. " 0 nata mecum consule Manlio." — Hor. This was not all. In consequence of this in- stinct of improvement already alluded to, attempts were made to render the wine more perfumed and delectable by the infusion of fruits, flowers and spices (cups); and the preparations which writers of the period have transmitted to us under the name of conclita must have been hot to the mouth and have irritated the stomach. Thus, already, at that distant period, the Eomans dreamt of alcohol, which was not discovered till nearly fifteen centuries later. But it was chiefly in the accessories of the re- pasts that this gigantic luxury was carried to an extreme. All the furniture requisite for the banquet was of costly material or exquisite workmanship. The number of courses was gradually increased till it exceeded twenty; and after each course every- thing which had served for the previous course was removed and fresh supplied. C 3HANDBOOK OF DINING. 22 Slaves were specially appointed to each con- vivial function, and those functions were most minutely defined. The most delicious perfumes embalmed the banquet-hall. A master of the ceremonies annouuced the merit of the dishes most worthy of special attention—the claims they possessed to this sort of ovation; finally, nothing was omitted of a nature to sharpen the appetite, keep alive the attention, and prolong enjoy- ment. This luxury had also its follies and absurdities. Such were those banquets where the fishes and birds served counted by thousands, and those dishes which had no other merit than that of having cost an enormous price, such as that dish which consisted of the brains of 500 ostriches, and that other of the tongues of 5000 birds, all of which had been taught to speak. After the above the enormous sums spent by Lucullus at his banquets, and the cost of the feasts he gave in the hall of Apollo, will be readily understood. At these feasts the etiquette was to exhaust every known means to flatter the sen- suality of the guests. Those glorious days might be revived at our own time, but we want a Lucullus. Let us sup-LUCULLUS. 23 c 4 pose some man known to be enormously rich, de- sirons of celebrating a great political or financial event, and of giving on the occasion a memorable festival without regard to expense. Let us suppose that he engages the service of every art to adorn the place of the festival in every detail ; that he gives orders that recourse be had to every means to procure the rarest provi- sions and the noblest wines of the most famed cellars ; That he has a troupe of the first actors of the day to perform for the amusement of his guests ; That the banquet be enlivened by vocal and instrumental music, performed by the first artistes of the day ; That, as an entr'acte, between dinner and cof- fee, a ballet performed by the best and prettiest dancers shall enliven his guests ; That the evening shall close with a ball, at which two hundred women, selected amongst the most beautiful, and four hundred elegant dancers shall attend ; That the buffet be provided with the most excellent hot and cold beverages, fresh and iced ; That at midnight a wisely selected collation shall imbue new life into all ;24 HANDBOOK OF DINING. That the servants be handsome and well-dressed, the illumination perfect, and, moreover, that the Amphitryon should have arranged for every guest to be sent for and conveyed home without discom- fort ; — the bill on the following day might startle even the cashier of Lucullus, as will be readily admitted by all who are well acquainted with Paris. What was first done by the Athenians, after- wards by the Eomans, and at a later period in the middle ages by ourselves, and at a still more recent period, is to be attributed to the nature of man, who impatiently strives to exhaust the career upon which he has entered, and to a sort of anxiety which torments him as long as the sum total of life he has at his disposal is not filled up. Like the Athenians, the Eomans ate in a re- clining position, but they only adopted it by degrees. They first made use of couches for repasts offered to the gods ; the high dignitaries of the state and men in power then adopted the habit ; it soon became general, and was maintained until near the beginning of the fourth century of the Christian era. These couches, which were at first little more than stuffed seats of skins and straw, soon partook25 THE LECTI-STERNIUM. of the luxury appertaining to these feasts. The most costly wood was used, inlaid with gold and ivory, and often with precious stones ; the cushions were of the softest down, and the richest stuffs covered them. At dinner you reclined on your left side, lean- ing on your elbow ; and generally the same couch held three persons. "Was this mode of dining, called by the Eomans ledi-sternium, more comfortable or pleasant than that which we have adopted, or rather resumed ? We do not think so. "Physically considered, the recumbent posture exacts a certain exertion to keep an equilibrium, and the weight of the body on the arm causes a certain amount of discomfort. There is also something to be said in a physio- logical point of view ; the food is hot swallowed so easily, and the position of the body is not so favourable to digestion. As regards drinking, it is still more incon- venient, and it required some skill not to spill the wine from the large cups which were in use at great houses, and it was doubtless at the time of the lecti-sternium that the proverb arose : — " There is many a slip from the cup to the lip."26 HANDBOOK OF DINING. Nor was it particularly clean to eat in such lying posture. The beard was worn long, and as forks were not used, but the fingers, or at most a knife, to convey the food to the mouth, it made it still more difficult. Forks are comparatively a modern invention ; none were found in the ruins of Herculaneum, though spoons were found in considerable number. It may also be presumed that a couch holding three persons, at times of both sexes, when in- temperance was not unusual, did not lead to an improvement of morals, and it was not unusual for some of the guests to fall asleep. " Nam pransus jaceo, et satur supinus Pertundo, tunicamque, palliumque." As soon as Christianity established itself from the persecutions it had to suffer, its ministers raised their voice against the excesses of intem- perance. They declaimed against the length of the repasts, and denounced all voluptuous indul- gences. Devoted by free choice to an austere life, they placed gluttony in the list of capital sins, and the reclining posture at dinner was protested against as one of the sources of immo- rality and intemperance.27 CHRISTIANITY. POETRY. Their threatening voice was hearkened to : couches gradually disappeared from the banquet- room ; the sitting posture was resumed, and, by rare good fortune, this posture which morality has ordained is not detrimental to pleasure. At the period of which we write convivial poetry underwent a change, and the verse of Horace, Tibullus, and other poets of the day, breathed a voluptuousness unknown to the Greek muse. " Dulce ridentem Lalagem amabo Dulce loquentem."—Horace. " Quseris quot mihi basiationes Tuœ, Lesbia, sint satis superque."— Catullus. " Pande, puella, pande capillulos Flavos, lucentes, ut aurum nitidum." " Pande, puella, collum candidum Productum bene candidis humeris.".— Gallus. The five or six centuries we have thus briefly reviewed were the great days of cookery, as well as for those who knew how to enjoy good-living. But the invasion of Barbarians from the north completely upset the art, and those glorious days of feasting were followed by a long and terrible obscurity. As the barbarians gained ground the culinary art disappeared with the other sciences of which it28 HANDBOOK OF DINING. is the companion and the consoler. All the good cooks were massacred in the kitchens of their noble masters. Some fled sooner than serve men who could not appreciate their dishes. Some offered their services, but finding that these brutes had no palate for good cheer, died of grief or committed suicide. Huge roasts of beef and venison, buckets of strong drink, were quaffed by the new comers, and as every man bore weapons, blood was often shed at their banquets. However, the very nature of things could not allow this to last. The victors became acquainted with the vanquished and ceased to be cruel ; they gradually became more civilised and learnt to eat like gentlemen. Their dinners became more res- pectable. Men were asked not to stuff themselves but to enjoy their food ; the guests discovered that the host took some pains to entertain them ; they felt a pleasant contentment, and their better feelings expanded. This improvement took place about the fifth century of our era, but a more marked improve- ment took place under Charlemagne ; and history informs us that that great monarch took a personal interest that his domains should be well stored with game best suited to the table.CHARLEMAGNE. 29 Under Charlemagne dinners assumed a gallant and chivalrous aspect. Fair ladies embellished his court ; they awarded prizes to the brave ; the pheasant was served up with his golden claws, and the peacock with his magnificent tail was brought in and placed on the table of princes by pages in rich liveries of gold, and by gentle virgins whose innocence heightened their charms. This is the third time, be it observed, that women—the greatest ornament of society—exclu- ded from public by the Greeks, Eomans, and Franks, were admitted to table. The Turks alone have resisted the appeal. But that unsociable race cannot last, and the emancipation of sultanas is simply a question of time. The impetus once given it has lasted down to the present day, increasing from generation to generation. Women, even of the highest rank, did not think it beneath their dignity to oversee their kitchens, and the duties of hospitality became as sacred as they were in France at the end of the 17th century. Under their pretty fingers some of the dishes -assumed fantastic appearances. The eel was served up in the form of a serpent, the hare with30 HANDBOOK OF DINING. the ears of a cat. Spices brought by the Venetians from the East and perfumed waters from Arabia were in great resort. It was not unusual to boil fish in rose-water. The luxury of the table con- sisted, in a great measure, in abundance. This was carried to such an extreme that kings found it necessary to enact laws to curtail the expense of the sumptuous banquets given ; laws which were of course laughed at and ridiculed, as they were in Greece and Rome. They, however, remain as historical documents.* (rood-living was kept up in monasteries and con- vents, especially where there were rich abbots, as from their mask of sanctity they were less exposed to interference. Science advanced. The Crusaders brought garlic from Ascalon. Parsley was imported from Italy, and long before the reign of Louis XIV. pork and sausage-mongers made fortunes. Pastry- * It may not be out of place to mention here that at Venice the luxury displayed by the nobles in their gondolas caused an order to be issued by the " Council of Ten," prohibiting all display. Some of the gondolas were studded with jewels, the oars gilt, and the money spent threatened to ruin the Republic, The Council of Ten was not to be trifled with. At the present day the gondolas at Venice resemble coffins or water-hearses.IMPORTATIONS. 31 cooks also did a good business. They had a guild of their own as far back as Charles IX., and were no contemptible body. About the middle of the 17th century the Dutch introduced coffee into Europe. Soliman Aga, that powerful Turk of whom our great-great- grandfathers were never tired of speaking, mixed the first cups for them in 1660.* An American sold coffee publicly at the fair of St. Germain in 1670; and the Eue St. André aux Arts opened the first coffee-shop, with marble tables and mirrors, much in the same style as the cafés of the present day. It was about the same time that sugar was introduced f ; and Scarron, when he complains that his sister had from stinginess caused the holes of * Amongst the Europeans the Dutch were the first who im- ported samples of the coffee-plant from Asia to Batavia, from whence they brought it to Europe. M. de Reissont, Lieutenant- General of Artillery, had a plant sent to Amsterdam, and made it a present to the Jardin du Roi ; it is the first seen at Paris. This tree, which is described by M. Jussieu, had one inch dia- meter in 1613, and was five feet high ; the fruit was pretty, something resembling a cherry. f Whatever Lucretius may have written to the contraiy, sugar was unknown to the ancients. Sugar is an artificial production, and without crystallisation the cane would give a liquid insipid and of little use.32 HANDBOOK OF DINING. his sugar-box to be made smaller, informs us at least that such an article of furniture was in use at his day. Again, it was in the 17th century that brandy commenced to be of common use. Distillation, the first idea of which was brought to Europe by the Crusaders, had hitherto remained a secret to all except a few adepts. Towards the commence- ment of the reign of Louis XIV. stills became common ; but it was not till the reign of Louis XV. that brandy became a popular beverage. Tobacco also became of ordinary use nearly at the same time ; so that sugar, coffee, brandy, and tobacco, those four important articles to com- merce and the exchequer, date scarcely two cen- turies back. The century of Louis XIV. commenced under these auspices, and in his brilliant reign the science of banquets obeyed that progressive im- pulse which made all other sciences advance. The memory of the festivities which attracted all Europe, and those tournaments where for the last time lances were broken, now replaced by the bayonet, and those chivalrous suits of armour but a feeble defence against modern artillery, is still extant.THE CENTURY OP LOUIS XIV. 33 All those festivals terminated with sumptuous banquets, which crowned the whole; for man is so constituted that he is never happy unless his taste is gratified; and this imperious want has subjugated even grammar, for if we wish to say a thing has been done with perfection, we say it has been done with taste. As a necessary consequence, the men who pre- sided over the preparations of those festivities be- came men of note, and deservedly so ; for it was requisite they should combine many qualities ; the genius of invention, the tact of arrangement, the judgment of disposal, the sagacity to distinguish, a strong will to enforce obedience, and punctuality, so as not to keep men waiting. It was on these great occasions that the magni- ficence of "plate" was introduced. Painting and sculpture played their part, the table offered a pleasing aspect to the eye ; and often the site selected was appropriate to the event, or to the hero of the fête. Here all the art and skill of the cook was set forth ; but soon small dinner parties of fewer guests, and more recherché wants, exacted greater care and more minute attention. It was at the "petit couvert" in the Salon D34 HANDBOOK OF DINING. des Favorites, and at the delicate suppers of courtiers and financiers, that artists displayed their skill, and, animated by a praiseworthy emu- lation, endeavoured to surpass each other. Towards the end of this reign, the names of the most famous cooks were nearly always annexed to those of their patrons: the latter were vain of their cooks ; the merits of both became united ; and the most glorious names of history are to be found in cookery-books, by the side of the dishes they patronised, invented, or made the fashion. This amalgamation no longer exists. We are not less gourmands than our ancestors ; on the contrary ; but we care much less about the name of the man who presides in the lower regions of the kitchen. Approval, by a gentle inclination of the left ear, is the only tribute of admiration which we grant to the artist that delights us ; and restaurateurs, who are the cooks of the public, alone obtain a nominal esteem, which promptly places them in the rank of great capi- talists. Utile dulci. It was Louis XIV. who had the Epine d'Eté— la bonne poire—as he called it, brought from the East; and it is to his old age that we are in- debted for liqueurs.35 THE CENTURY OF LOUIS XIV. D 2 This Prince had occasional fits of weakness, and that difficulty to live which so often mani- fests itself after sixty. Brandy, mixed with sugar and perfumes, was administered to him in potions he called " Cordial potions." This was the origin of liqueurs. It may be observed, that about this same period the culinary art flourished at the Court of England. Queen Anne was fond of good cheer. She did not think it beneath her dignity to converse with her cook ; and English cookery- books contain many dishes " after Queen Anne's fashion." The culinary science, which remained stationary during the sway of Madame de Maintenon, rose under the Eegency. The Duke of Orleans, a spirituel Prince, worthy of friendship, invited his friends to re- pasts as delicate as they were well selected. From the most authentic sources we learn that the most delicate piques, matelottes as tasty as on the river's banks, and turkeys gloriously truffled, were the favourites. Truffled turkeys ! ! I the reputation and price of which is always on the increase! Brilliant planets, whose appearance made the eyes glisten,HANDBOOK OF DINING. 36 and the lips smack of gourmands of every grade. The reign of Louis XV. was not less favourable to the alimentary art. Eighteen years of peace soon healed the wounds of sixty years' war; riches, the fruit of industry, spread by trade, in a great measure equalised fortunes ; and a spirit of conviviality spread through all branches of society. It was at this period that more order, neatness, elegance, and those various refinements were in- troduced, which have always gradually been in- creasing, and threaten at times to become ri- diculous. According to correct information which I have gathered in various provinces, a dinner of ten persons, in 1740, was as follows :— First Course. Soup. Boiled beef {bouilli). Entree de Veau cuit dans son jus. A side dish. Second Course. A Turkey. A dish of vegetables. A salad. A cream (sometimes).LOUIS XV. s: D 3 ' Dessert. Cheese. Fruit, i Sweets. Plates were only changed thrice : viz., after the soup, at the second course, and at dessert. Coffee was rarely given, but cherry brandy generally. Bachelors and courtisanes kept good cooks in this reign, and did much for the art. It is easy enough to give a large banquet to a crowd of hungry men. Beef, game, fish, poultry can be cooked wholesale and satisfy their cravings But it is a very difficult thing to gratify mouths that only nibble, to satisfy a delicate woman's palate, to create a feeling in a papier mâché stomach, and to excite an appetite which flickers in the socket. It requires genius, discernment, and great labour to solve one of the most difficult problems of the geometry of the indefinite. We now come to the days of Louis XVI. and the revolution. We shall not dwell upon changes which many of us have witnessed, but shall con- fine ourselves to point out generally the various improvements introduced at banquets since 1774. Those improvements belong in some measureHANDBOOK OF DINING. .38 to the natural department of the art and to the customs and social usages connected therewith ; and although these two orders of things continually react upon each other, we think it as well to take each separately. Every trade connected with the sale or pre- paration of food, as cooks, traiteurs, pastry-cooks, confectioners, eating-houses, &c, has increased in an ever increasing ratio. And this proves that the demand is equal to the supply. Physics and chemistry have been called in to the aid of the alimentary art. The most learned men have not thought it beneath them to devote their attention to our primary wants, and have introduced improvements from the simple stew to the most recherche dishes which are only served up in gold or crystal. New branches of trade have arisen—biscuit bakers, for instance, who hold a middle path between pastry-cooks and confectioners. Their domain comprises butter mixed with sugar and eggs, as biscuits, buns, meringues, &c. The art of preserving food has also become a distinct branch, the object of which is to offer us at every time of the year the various delicacies of every season.39 LOUIS XVI. D 4 Horticulture has made immense progress ; hot- houses provide us with fruits of the tropics; amongst others, the cultivation of melons is a great gain to the table. Wines are better selected. We begin with Madeira, drink Bordeaux between the courses, and finish with port and sherry. Caviar, soy,#and other sauces are improvements meriting mention. Coffee has become popular. It is very good for breakfast ; and after dinner is exhilarating, as well as a tonic. The word "gastronomy" is now universally adopted, and this Greek word brings a glow of pleasure to every face. Voracity is obsolete, and your real dining-man now takes his place by the side of other artists. Déjeuners à la fourchette are pretty repasts ; they are elegant and pleasant, and a certain free- dom of toilette adds to their charm. Tea-parties are an absurdity. What does a man care for a cup of tea who has had his dinner and coffee? He is neither hungry nor thirsty. It is an excuse for receiving guests. Political dinners have an object. They oughtHANDBOOK OP DINING. 40 to be the very best in materials. They leave an impression, and " answer " at times. The institution of " restaurateur " deserves a separate chapter. A man with a few pounds in his pocket may now dine like a king.41 RESTAURATEURS. CHAP. III. DININa-HOUSES, OR RESTAURATEURS. About the year 1770, after the glorious days of the reign of Louis XIV., the roueries of the Ke- gency and the long tranquillity of the ministry of Cardinal Fleury, travellers arriving at Paris had but few places where they could get a good din- ner. They had to put up at hotels, generally bad. A few had table-d'hôtes, which however only just offered what was necessary for a meal, and more- over were at fixed hours. There were a few " traiteurs, " but they had usually nothing but joints; and a man who wished to give a dinner to his friends, was obliged to order it beforehand; so that men who had not the good luck to have an introduction into opulent houses, had to leave the capital without becoming acquainted with the resources and delicacies of a Parisian kitchen. At last a man of intellect was found who took42 HANDBOOK OP DINING. the subject into consideration; lie argued that, as the same wants occurred at about the same hour every day, men would not fail to come, if they found they were readily and well served; that if one man had a wing of chicken, the next comer would take the leg, and so on; that a slice from a prime joint would not spoil the remainder, and that a man who found he got a good dinner, would not grumble at a little expense, if promptly served, and well waited upon ; and that a carte, with fixed prices for every dish, would be suitable to all fortunes. This man did not stop short here, but developed his idea still further. He was the first restaurateur, and created a profession which leads to fortune whenever the professor is honest, and combines order with skill. From France, restaurateurs soon spread to the rest of Europe. The institution is one of ex- treme advantage to every citizen, and of high im- portance to science. A man can now dine at any hour he pleases, according to his appetite and his means. He needs not dread his bill, as he knows beforehand the price of each dish which he orders. Having consulted his purse, the diner may make an excellent dinner, heavy, or light, or tasty,RESTAURATEURS. 43 as he feels inclined ; lie may wash it down with the generous wines of France or Spain, crown it with aromatic mocha and perfumed liqueurs, with no other restrictions than the capacity of his sto- mach. The salon of a restaurateur is the Eden of gourmands. It is also very convenient for travellers, stran- gers, or for those whose families are out of town, who have no cook of their , own. Before the period of which we speak (1770), men of fortune or in power enjoyed, almost ex- clusively, two great privileges ; they travelled fast and always had good cheer. The first privilege has been done away by rail- ways, and the institution of restaurateurs has destroyed the second : thanks to them, good living has become universal. Any man with fifteen francs or a pound in his pocket, who takes his seat at a table at one of the first restaurateurs, will have a better and more comfortable dinner than if he dined at the table of a prince; his dishes are as well cooked, and he is not bothered by any personal consi- derations. The salon of a restaurateur, examined a little in detail, offers to the scrutinising eye of the phi-HANDBOOK OF DINING. 44 losopher a picture worthy to excite an interest on account of the various phases it presents. One end is occupied by the usual crowd of daily diners, who order in a loud voice, wait impatiently, eat hastily, pay, and go. Some travelling families may be seen who, content with a frugal repast, nevertheless, generally have some dish which is new to them, which gives a zest to their dinner, and seem always to enjoy the novelty of the scene. Next to them a Parisian couple may be seen, easily recognisable by the bonnet and shawl hung up above them. It is quite clear they have had nothing to say to each other for a long time ; they have made up their mind to go to one of the minor theatres, and a man might bet any sum that one of them will go to sleep there. Not far from them, behold a pair of lovers ; the eager politeness of the one, and sly coquetry of the other, and the gourmandise of both betrays them. Their eyes sparkle with pleasure; and by the se- lection of their dishes, the present serves to pour- tray the past, and predicts the future. In the centre there is a table, where the same men generally dine daily, at a fixed price to suit them. They know all the waiters by name, who45 a eestaueateue's salon. familiarly tell them of any good dish on the table; they are like so many tame ducks, put there as decoys, to catch the wild ones. Individuals are always to be seen there who are known to every one by sight, but whose name nobody knows. They seem perfectly at home, and often try to enter into conversation with their neighbours. They belong to a genus which exists only at Paris, and who, without property, capital, or profession, nevertheless spend a great deal of money. Scattered about are strangers, chiefly English- men. These latter cram themselves with double portions, ask for all the dearest dishes, wash them down with strong wine, and do not always leave particularly steady on the legs. This picture may be daily witnessed ; it may excite curiosity, per- haps even offend morality. Doubtless the display of delicacies may induce many to exceed their means. Some delicate sto- machs may experience indigestion, and Venus may make a few victims. But the dark side, as regards social life, is that there can be no doubt that dining alone leads to selfishness. A man gradually thinks of no one but himself, cares for none else ; nor does he wish to be cared about ; and a very little discernment is necessary, at a46 HANDBOOK OF DINING. dinner party, to point out the men who usually dine at a restaurateur's. We said that the institution of restaurateurs was of high importance to science. In fact, as soon as experience proved that a single well made ragout sufficed to make the fortune of an inventor, interest, that powerful agent, fired the imagination, and sharpened the wits of the purveyors. Analysis discovered esculent properties in sub- stances formerly discarded as useless ; new articles of food were discovered ; ancient ones were im- proved, and both were combined in a variety of ways. Foreign inventions were imported ; the uni- verse was placed under contribution ; and we have seen dinners which might have provided the mate- rial for a whole course of alimentary geography. There are a few names deserving of historical mention as restaurateurs ; Beauvilliers, Méot, Robert, Rose, Legacque, Very, Henneveu, and Baleine. Some of them owe their reputation to peculiar dishes. The Frères Provençaux made a fortune on cod-fish with garlic * ; Very was strong * This dish would scarcely have pleased Horace. Vide Ode to Maecenas:— "Parentis olim si quis impia manu Senile guttur fregerit; Edit cicutis allium nocentius."—Epodon L, c. III..47 BEAUVILLIERS. in truffles ; Robert, with due notice, would serve up a first-rate dinner ; Baleine had the best fish in Paris ; Henneveu had mysterious private rooms on the fourth story. But of all these heroes of gastronomy, Beauvilliers, who died in 1820, is most deserving of mention. Beauvilliers commenced business in 1782. He was the first who had a decent dining-house. In 1814 and 1815, when Paris was occupied by the allies, carriages of every description might be seen waiting at his door. He was personally acquaint- ed with all the foreign ambassadors, and spoke to them all in their own tongue. Beauvilliers published, shortly before his death, a work in two volumes octavo, entitled "The Culinary Art." That work is the fruit of long experience, and is still consulted as a valuable work. Until then the culinary art had never been treated with so much precision and method. This work, which has gone through many editions, has been the groundwork of many others, but none have ever surpassed it. Beauvilliers was gifted with a prodigious memory ; after an absence of twenty years he would recognise and welcome men who had dined perhaps only once or twice in his house. AtHANDBOOK. OF DINING. 48 times he had a custom peculiar to himself. When he knew that a company of rich men were dining together in his salon, he would present himself, pay his respects to them, point out the best dishes to them, tell them which dish ought to be eaten first, &c. He would then send up some dish unknown to them, and a bottle of wine from his own private cellar, of which he alone kept the key. All this was done with so much courtesy that it appeared that these little extras were gratuitous. But this part of the Amphitryon was only momentary; he soon vanished, and the addition to the bill and bitterness of the " quart d'heure " of Eabelais sufficiently convinced the guests that they had been dining at a restaurateur's. Beauvilliers made, spent, and remade his fortune more than once. Whether he died rich or poor is not known, but he had so many calls upon him it is not likely he left a large inheritance. The examination of the carte at a first-rate restaurateur's will show that the man who enters to dine has the choice for his dinner of at least : — 12 soups. 12 of pastry. 24 hors d'œuvre. 24 of fish. 15 or 20 entrées of heef. 15 roasts. 20 entrees of mutton. 50 entrémets. 30 entrées of game or fowl. 50 of dessert. 16 or 20 of veal.A PARISIAN DINNER. 49 oreover, the happy gastronome may wash it down with a selection from thirty wines, from Burgundy to Tokai;—he can select from some twenty different sorts of perfumed liqueurs, with- out mentioning coffee, punch, and other mixtures. A good dinner at Paris is a cosmopolitan wonder. France provides fowls and fruits, and each country of the world gives an idea or an article. Beefsteaks à l'anglaise, sauer kraut from Germany; wild boar from the Black Forest; an olla-podrida from Spain, garbanços and dried raisins from Malaga, hams au poivre de Xerica, and liqueurs; from Italy, macaroni, parmesan, Bolognese sausages, polenta, ices, liqueurs ; from Russia, smoked eels and caviar; dried herrings, curaçoa, and anisette, from Holland ; rice, sago, karisk, soy, wine of Schiraz, and coffee from Asia ; Cape wine from Africa ; ananas, sugar, and other eatables from America. E50 HANDBOOK OF DINING. CHAP. IV. THE SENSES. The senses are the organs by which man is brought into contact with external objects. Sight, which embraces space and informs us, through the medium of light, of the existence and of the colour of the bodies which surround us. Hearing, which receives, through the inter- medium of the air, the vibration caused by noisy or sonorous bodies. Smell, by the means of which we appreciate the odour of bodies that possess it. Taste, by which we appreciate everything sapid or esculent. Touch, the object of which is the consistency and surface of bodies. If we may be allowed to carry back our imagina- tion to the first moments of the existence of the human species, we may also be allowed to fancy51 THE SENSES. E 2 that the first sensations were purely direct, that is to say that man saw without precision, heard con- fusedly, smelt without discernment, eat without savour, and was in fact little better than a brute in all his enjoyments. But as all these sensations have the soul as a common centre—the especial distinction of the human species—and the ever active cause of a striving towards perfection, they became modified, swayed by judgment and comparison, and soon all the senses came to the aid of each other for the benefit of the sensitive being or individual. Thus the sense of touch rectified the errors of sight; sound, by means of articulated words, be- came the interpreter of every sentiment; taste became benefited by sight and smell; hearing compared sounds and appreciated distances. The torrent of centuries rolling over the human race has incessantly engendered new perfections, the cause of which, though almost invisible, is to be found in the play of the senses, which, in rotation, exact agreeable employment. Thus sight gave rise to painting, sculpture, and all sorts of displays. Sound gave birth to melody, to harmony, to dance, and music, and all their branches.HANDBOOK OP DINING. 52 Smell to the discovery and cultivation of per- fumes. Taste to the production, selection, and pre- paration of every species of food. Touch gave birth to every branch of industry. A man who has dined at a sumptuous table, in a hall resplendent with mirrors, pictures, statuary, flowers, delicate perfumes, adorned with beautiful women, and enlivened by the sound of soft music will not need much mental effort to be convinced that all the sciences have been placed under con- tribution to heighten and crown the enjoyments of taste. Taste is that one of our senses which brings us in contact with sapid substances, through the medium of the sensation they produce upon the organ destined to appreciate them. Taste is aroused by appetite, hunger, and thirst; it is the basis of many operations, the result of which is that the individual grows, developes, lives, and repairs the losses caused by vital eva- porations. All organised bodies are not nourished in the same manner ; the author of creation, as diverse in his methods as he is sure in their effect, has as- signed to them various means of conservation.53 ORGANISED BODIES. E 3 Vegetables, which must.be placed at the bottom of the scale of living things, draw their nourish- ment through roots which, implanted in the soil, select, by the action of a peculiar mechanism, the various substances which are proper for their growth and preservation. If we go a step higher we find bodies possessing animal life but deprived of locomotion ; they are born in a centre which favours their existence; and especial organs enable them to extract from around them whatever is necessary to sustain that length and portion of vitality granted to them; they do not seek their food, their food comes to them. Another method was ordained for the preserva- tion of the animals of the earth, of which man is incontestably the most perfect. A peculiar in- stinct advises him to get food ; he looks around him, he seizes upon the objects in which he fancies there is property to satisfy his wants; he eats, feels restored, and thus fulfils the career pointed out for him. Taste appears to have two principal functions :— 1. It invites us by pleasure to repair the continual losses we incur by the action of life. 2. It aids us to select amongst the variousHANDBOOK OF DINING. 54 substances which nature offers us those most suit- able for food. In this selection, taste is powerfully aided by smell, as we shall see further on ; for it may be asserted as a general maxim that nutritious sub- stances are not repulsive either to taste or smell. The number of flavours is infinite, for every substance capable of solution has a peculiar flavour of its own. The sense of smell has a great influence on taste. I am inclined to believe that taste and smell are one and the same sense, the laboratory of which is the mouth, and the nose the chimney. The nose is a sentinel, and is always on the alert to cry, Who's there? Take away the sense of smell, and that of taste goes with it. This principle once put, I maintain that there are three distinct orders of taste, viz. direct sen- sation; complete sensation; and the sensation of judgment. Direct sensation is the first impression from the contact of the food with the organs of the mouth whilst on the point of the tongue. Complete sensation consists of the first sensation and the impression arising from it when the mor- sel of food leaves the first position, passes to theTASTE. 55 back of the mouth, and strikes the whole organ with its taste and perfume. Finally, the sensation of judgment is that of the mind, which reflects upon the impression trans- mitted by the organ. Let us have an example :— The man who eats a peach is first agreeably struck by its fragrance; he puts a slice in his mouth, and experiences a sensation of freshness and acidity, which induces him to continue ; but it is only at the moment he swallows that the real perfume of the peach is revealed ; this is the com- plete sensation caused by a peach. Finally, it is only when he has swallowed the morsel that he can exclaim : " That was delicious ! " The same may be said of a man who drinks a good glass of wine. As long as the wine is in his mouth he experiences an agreeable, but not a per- fect impression. It is only when he has swallowed the liquid that he really can taste, appreciate, and discern the particular perfume of the wine; and then a few minutes must be allowed to the gour- met to give vent to his feelings, by : "-Peste, à est du ChambertinP or, "Mon Dieu! c'est du Sur eue ! " This will suffice to prove that your real connois- E 4 1HANDBOOK OF DINING. 56 seur sips his wine ; at every sip he takes he has the sum total of the pleasure which another man en- joys when he swallows a whole glass. Let us take an opposite example. A doctor orders a man to take a black draught. His nose, a faithful sentinel, warns him of the treacherous liquor he is about to imbibe. His eyes become globular, as at the approach of danger; disgust is on his lips; his stomach rises. He is encouraged by the doctor, he gargles his throat with brandy, pinches his nose, and drinks. As long as the detestable beverage fills his mouth, the sensation is confused and supportable ; but when the last drop disappears the sickening flavours act, and the patient makes a grimace which the fear of death alone would warrant. If it is a glass of water, there is no taste ; he drinks, swallows, and that is all. Taste is not so richly endowed as hearing; the latter sense can compare divers sounds at the same time ; taste, on the contrary is simple in ac- tuality, that is to say, it cannot be impressioned by two flavours at the same time. But it may be double and even multiplied by succession; that is to say, in the same act of gut- turation, a second and even a third sensation may i57 FLAVOUK. be experienced, which gradually lessens, and which is designated as arrière-goût, perfume or fragrance; in the same manner as, when a keynote is struck, a practised ear discerns one or more sonances, the number of which has not yet been accurately as- certained. Hasty and careless eaters do not discern the im- pressions in the second degree ; they are the ex- clusive property of a small body of elect ; and it is by their means that they can classify, in order of excellence, the various substances submitted to their examination. These fugitive nuances of flavour remain for some time on the palate ; the professors assume, without being aware of it, an appropriate position, and it is always with an elongated neck and a twist of the nose that they pronounce their judgment. Let us now take a philosophical glance at the pleasure or unpleasantness taste may occasion. We first find the application of that, unhappily, too general truth, that man is more organised for suffering than for experiencing pleasure. In fact, the injection of very bitter, acid, or tart substances may cause us the sensation of excru- ciating pain. It is even supposed that hydrocyanic acid only kills so rapidly because it causes suchHANDBOOK OF DINING/. 58 excruciating agony that the vital powers cannot support it. Agreeable sensations, on the contrary, are on a limited scale, and though there is a marked differ- ence between what is insipid and what is palatable, there is no great interval between what is admitted to be good and what is reputed excellent; for example, 1st term, hard boiled beef; 2nd term, a piece of veal ; 3rd term, a pheasant roasted to a turn. Yet taste, such as nature has awarded it to us, is still that sense which, well considered, procures us the greatest degree of enjoyment. 1st. Because the pleasure of eating is the only one which, done in moderation, is not followed by fatigue. 2nd. Because it is of all times, all ages, all conditions. 3rd. Because it returns necessarily, at least once a day, and may be repeated, without incon- venience, two or three times within the same period of time. 4th. Because it may be enjoyed with other enjoyments, and even console us for their absence. 5th. Because its impressions are more durable and more dependent on our will, and59 THE ENJOYMENTS OF TASTE. 6th, and finally. Because in eating we experi- ence a certain indescribable sensation of pleasure, which emanates from instinctive consciousness; by what we eat we repair the losses we have sus- tained, and prolong life. This subject is more amply developed in Chapter XII., in which we discuss (( the pleasures of the table" in the point of view of the present state of civilisation. We were brought up in the flattering belief that of all creatures that walk, swim, crawl, or fly, man was the one whose taste was most perfect. This faith is threatened with being upset. Dr. Grail, on what grounds I know not, pretends that there are animals whose organ of taste is much more developed and perfect than is that of man. Such doctrine smacks of heresy. Man, by divine right, king of all he surveys, for whose benefit the earth was covered and peopled, must necessarily be provided with an organ to place him in contact with all that is sapid amongst his subjects. The tongue of animals is in proportion to their intelligence ; in fishes it is simply a moveable bone ; in birds, generally speaking, a membraneous60 HANDBOOK OF DINING. cartilage ; in quadrupeds it is often covered with scales or points, and moreover has no circumflex movement. The tongue of man, on the contrary, by the delicacy of its conformation and of the diverse membranes by which it is surrounded or which are close to it, announces plain enough the sub- limity of the operations to which it is destined. I have, moreover, discovered at least three movements unknown to animals, and which I call movements of spication, rotation, and verrition* The first takes place when the tongue leaves the lips which compress it ; the second when the tongue makes a circular movement round the space comprised between the interior of the cheeks and the palate ; the third when the tongue, turn- ing over or under, picks up the atoms which may remain in the semicircular canal formed by the lips and gums. Animals are limited in their tastes ; some live exclusively upon vegetables ; others only eat flesh ; others feed upon grain; not one understands a combined flavour. Man, on the contrary, is omnivorous ; every- * From the Latin verb verro, I sweep.THE HUMAN TONGUE. 61 thing eatable becomes a prey to his vast appetite ; which at once implies digestive powers proportion- ate to the general use he puts them to. In fact, the machinery of taste in man is of rare perfection, and to be convinced of the fact let us see it act. As soon as an esculent substance is introduced into the mouth it is confiscated, gas and juices, irretrievably. The lips prevent its leaving; the teeth seize upon it and crush it ; the saliva absorbs it ; the tongue bruises it and turns it round; the breath forces it towards the gullet ; the tongue again rises to make it slip down ; the sense of smell enjoys it as it glides past, and it is precipitated into the stomach to undergo ulterior transformations, with- out, during the whole of this operation, the slightest atom, particle, or drop being lost, which has not been submitted to the appreciating power. And a consequence of this perfection is that gourmandise is the exclusive apanage of man. This gourmandise is even contagious ; and we transmit it promptly to the animals we have in our service, and which become, in a certain measure, our companions, as elephants, dogs, cats, and even parrots.1 62 HANDBOOK OF DINING. If some animals have a larger tongue than others, a more developed palate, a wider swallow, it is because that tongue, as a muscle, is meant to move heavier morsels, to press and swallow larger portions ; but no logic can prove that the sense of taste is more perfect. Moreover, as taste can only be esteemed by the nature of the sensation it procures to the common centre, the impression received by an animal cannot be compared to that received by a man; the latter impression, being more clear and more precise, naturally implies a superior quality in the organ which transmits it. Finally, what greater refinement of taste can be desired, when a Eoman bon-vivant could at once tell whether a fish had been caught above or below bridge? And in our own days, a real good eater discovers at once the superior flavour of the leg of the partridge upon which it has slept. And do we not know gourmets who can tell in what latitude a grape has ripened, from the wine they sip, with as much preciseness as Arago would predict an eclipse ? And what results herefrom? Let us render to Caesar that which is Cassar's, proclaim man theTASTE MORALLY CONSIDERED. G3 great gourmand of nature, and not be astonished if Grail, like Homer, sometimes "sleeps." Hitherto we have examined taste only in the light of its physical constitution, and we have kept to the level of science. But our task does not end here, for it is especially in the moral his- tory of this repairing sense that its importance and its glory ought to be sought. We have therefore arranged, according to ana- lytical order, the theories and facts which consti- tute this history, that instruction may result without fatigue. Thus in the chapters which follow, we shall endeavour to show how sensations from repetition and reflection have perfected the organ, and extended the sphere of its powers; how the want, of eating, at first only an instinct, became a passion of influence which nas assumed a marked ascendency over everything else connected with society. We will also point out how all branches of science, which have reference to the composition of substances, act in concert to place apart those which are appreciable to taste, and how travellers have worked towards the same end by submitting to our examination substances which nature seem- ingly never meant to bring together.HANDBOOK OF DINING. We will follow chemistry from the moment it entered our subterraneous laboratories to enlighten our cooks, lay down principles, create methods and reveal causes which have hitherto remained secret. Finally, we shall see how, by the combined power of time and experience, a new science arose, which nourishes, restores, preserves, per- suades, consoles, and, not satisfied with strewing flowers by handfuls along the path of man, con- tributes also powerfully to the strength and pros- perity of empires. If in the midst of these grave lucubrations a piquant anecdote, an amiable souvenir, some ad- venture of an agitated career, should drop from our pen, let it pass, to give a rest to our readers' attention, whose number does not alarm us, and with whom we are always glad to chat; for if they are men, we feel convinced they are as indul- gent as they are well informed; if they are ladies, they cannot be otherwise than charming.

V. GASTRONOMY.—ORIGIN OF THE SCIENCES. The sciences do not resemble Minerva, who issued forth armed cap-à-pie from the brain of Jupiter ; they are the daughters of time, are formed invisibly, first by the collection of methods indicated by experience, and later by the discovery of principles deducted from the combination of those methods. Thus the first old men whose prudence made the invalid send for them, whose compassion in- duced them to bandage wounds, were also the first physicians. The shepherds of Egypt, who observed that certain planets after a certain lapse of time re- appeared on the same line of the horizon, were the first astronomers. The man who first expressed in characters that very simple proposition et twice two make four" created mathematics that powerful science which68 HANDBOOK OF DINING. lias in reality placed man on the throne of the •universe. In the course of the last sixty years, various new sciences have taken a place in the system of our knowledge, as stereotomy, descriptive geome- try, electricity, and the chemistry of gas. All these sciences, cultivated for an infinity of generations, will make still more certain progress, since the art of printing will prevent them from being lost. And who knows, for instance, whether the chemistry of gas may not some day succeed in dompting those elements hitherto so rebellious, of mixing them, combining them in proportions hitherto unattempted, of obtaining by such means substances and effects which would extend beyond measure the limits of our powers ? G-astronomy presented herself in her turn, and all her sisters received her with open arms. And what could be refused to a science which nourishes us from our birth until our death ; which increases the enjoyments of love, the pleasures of friendship ; which disarms hatred, facilitates busi- ness, and offers us in the short passage of life the only enjoyment which, not being followed by fatigue, relieves us from all others ? Doubtless when everything was trusted to the69 GASTRONOMY. F 3 hands of an ordinary cook it remained in an im- perfect state. But men of science finally took it up. They examined, analysed, and classified, the different alimentary substances, and reduced them to their simple elements. They fathomed the mysteries of assimilation ; and following inert matter through all its changes, they discovered how to give it life. They watched a diet in its passing or permanent effects, daily, monthly, for a whole life. They investigated its influence even on the mind, as regards the effect produced upon it by the senses as well as its powers when the senses are dormant ; and from all those labours they deducted a grand theory which embraces the whole of mankind and every portion of creation capable of animal life. Whilst these things were taking place in the cabinets of scientific men, in the dining-hall it was loudly maintained that the science which nourished man was at least as valuable as that which taught how to kill him ; poets sang the pleasures of the table, and works on good cheer became more instructive and important. These were the circumstances which preceded the advent of gastronomy. Gastronomy is the maturer knowledge—theHANDBOOK OP DINING. 70 rationale of everything which concerns man as regards his food. Its object is the preservation of man by pro- viding him with the best possible food. It succeeds in doing so by guiding, by certain principles, all those who seek, provide, or prepare food. In fact, it may be said that it is the motor of the agriculturist, the vine-grower, the sportsman, the fisherman, and the great family of cooks, under whatever name they may disguise their occupation in the preparation or procurance of articles of food. Gastronomy is connected :— With natural history by the classification it makes of alimentary substances ; With physics by the examination of their com- position and quality ; With chemistry by the different analyses and decompositions it subjects them to ; With cookery by the art of preparing the dishes and making them agreeable to the taste ; With commerce by seeking the cheapest and best market to buy in, and an advantageous one to sell in ; Finally, with political economy by the returnsF 4 THE POWERS OF GASTRONOMY. 7Î it brings into the Exchequer, and the means of exchange it provides to nations. Grastronomy rules the whole life of man ; the first cries of the new-born babe are for its nurse's breast; and a man on his death-bed swallows still with some pleasure the last potion, which, alas ! he has not the power to digest. Moreover, it is closely linked with every class of society: it presides at the banquet of a congress of kings, and also is present to calculate how many minutes are necessary to boil an egg to the proper turn. The material subject of gastronomy is every- thing that can be eaten; its direct object the pre- servation of the individual; its means of execution, cultivation which produces, commerce which ex- changes, industry which prepares, and experience which invents the means to turn everything to the best account. Grastronomy considers taste in its enjoyments as well as in its drawbacks; it has discovered the various degrees of pleasure it produces; it has regulated their action, and has fixed limits which no man of self-respect ought to outstep. It considers also the action of food on the moral qualities of man, on his imagination, his mind,72 HANDBOOK OF DINING. his judgment, his courage and perceptions, whe- ther awake or asleep, whether moving or reposing. It is gastronomy, again, which fixes the exact point when an article of food ought to be used, for all are not presentable under the. same cir- cumstances. Some ought to be used before they have attained their full development, as capers, asparagus, sucking-pigs, pigeons, &c. ; others, when they have attained full maturity, as melons, most fruits, mutton, beef, and all adult animals; others, when decomposition commences, as medlars, woodcocks and especially the pheasant; others, again, when their disagreeable qualities have been removed, as the potato, tapioca and others. It is gastronomy, again, which classifies these substances according to their various qualities, and gives them their proper place at the dining- table. It devotes no less interest to beverages, clas- sifying them according to date of vintage, clime, and locality. It teaches how to prepare and pre- serve them, but especially how to present them in an order so exactly calculated, that the enjoy- ment resulting therefrom always increases until pleasure ceases and abuse commences. It is gastronomy which passes in review men and things, that it may convey from one country toTHE PRINCE DE SOUBISE. 73 another what is worthy of being known, and which makes a well-organised banquet an abrégé of the world, where each part has its representative. The knowledge of gastronomy is necessary to all men, because it increases the amount of plea- sure allotted to them. This increases in proportion to the wealth of society; it becomes indispensable to men who have large fortunes, give grand din- ners, and sail in the wake of fashion. They find this special advantage therein, that, on their part, there is something personal in the manner in which their table is served; they take an interest, can superintend, and, to a certain degree, direct the men in whom they must neces- sarily place confidence. The Prince de Soubise * had, one day, the inten- tion of giving a fête; it was to terminate with a supper, and he asked to see his bill of fare. His maître-dliôtel waited upon him at his levee with the required document. The very first item which caught the Prince's eye was fifty hams! "What! Bertrand," he exclaimed, "I think you are extravagant: fifty hams! Do you wish to sup my whole regiment?" "No, my Prince, only one ham will appear at supper; but the remainder are * Côtelettes à la Soubise are still a famous dish: a white sauce with the echo of onions. Very well cooked at the Garrick.HANDBOOK OF DINING. 74 indispensable to me for my espagnole, my blonds, my trimmings, my. . . ." "Bertrand, you are robbing me, and I will not allow that item." "Ah, Monseigneur," said the artiste, scarcely able to suppress his anger, "you do not know our capa- bilities ! Say the word, and those fifty hams, which annoy you, I will put them all in a crystal flacon not bigger than the top of my thumb." What reply could be made to so positive an assertion? The Prince smiled, nodded his head, and the item passed. It is a matter of history, that, amongst tribes which are still of a primitive nature, no affair of importance is concluded without a feast; it is at banquets that savages decide upon war or make peace; and, without going further, all villagers conclude their bargains at the pot-house. This did not escape the observation of those who have often to treat the most important affairs of state; they saw that your well-filled man was a different being than when fasting; that the dinner-table formed a sort of link between the host and the guest ; that the latter was more open to receive impressions it was desirable to make, more ready to submit to certain influences. This gave rise to political gastronomy ; dinners became a means of government, and the fate of nations isPOLITICAL GASTRONOMY. 75 often decided at a dinner. This is neither paradox nor novel, but a simple matter of every-day ob- servation. Open any historian, from Herodotus down to the present day, and, not even excepting conspiracies, it may be said, that no great event ever occurred without having been conceived, pre- pared, and determined upon at a feast. Such is the superficial glance at the domain of gastronomy, a domain fertile in results of every description, and which cannot but advance with the onward march of science ; for in a few years gastronomy must have its academy, its lectures, its professors, its prizes. First, some rich and zealous gastronome will invite his friends to his table at fixed periods to discuss, in conjunction with learned theoricians and artistes, some interesting point of alimentary science. Soon (and this is the history of all academies) government will intervene, regulate, protect, institute. Thrice happy the man whose name will figure as the founder of such an academy. His name will be handed down to all posterity with the names of Noah, Bacchus, Triptolemus' and other benefactors of man; he will be amongst ministers what Henry IV. is amongst kings, and his praise will be in every man's mouth without any law to compel it.HANDBOOK OF DINING. 76 CHAP. VI. ON APPETITE. Movement and life occasion in a living body a continual loss of substance ; and the human body, that complicated machine, would soon be out of order if Providence had not given it a sentinel to warn it of the moment that its powers were no longer in equal balance with its wants. That sentinel is appetite. The word implies the first impression of the desire to eat. Appetite announces itself by a feeling of languor in the stomach and a slight sensation of fatigue. At the same time the mind becomes occupied with subjects analogous to its wants; memory recalls things which have pleased the taste ; imagination brings them up vividly; it becomes a sort of dream. This state is not devoid of a certain charm, and we have heard many adepts exclaim, in the gladness of their hearts, " What a plea- sure it is to have a good appetite, when one is certain of soon having an excellent dinner ! ' Nevertheless the whole system gradually becomesAPPETITE. 77 aroused: the stomach becomes growly; the gastric juices increase ; the gases inside become active; the mouth fills with juices, and all the di- gestive powers are up in arms like soldiers, only awaiting the word of command to charge. A little longer and spasms would succeed, yawning, —in short, hunger. All these various shades may be observed in a drawing-room, where men are waiting for dinner. They are so inherent in man's nature that the most refined politeness cannot subdue the symptoms. Whence I maintain as a maxim :— " Punctuality is the most indispensable quality in a Cook." I will support this grave maxim by relating a little experience I had myself at a dinner to which I was invited — " Quorum pars magna fui," and where the pleasure of observation saved me from the pangs of misery. I was invited one day to dine with a great public functionary. The hour mentioned was half-past five, and punctually to the minute all the guests had arrived ; they all knew the host's punctuality, and that he always plucked a crow with late comers.7S HANDBOOK OF DINING. I arrived a minute or so late, and was struck on entering at a certain appearance of consternation on the countenances of the guests. There were whisperings going on ; some were staring through the window panes into the court-yard ; some faces betrayed annoyance ; it was quite clear something unusual had occurred. I approached one of the guests whom I thought likely to enlighten me, and asked him what had happened. " Alas ! " he said, in a voice of deep affliction, " Monseigneur has just been summoned to a state cabinet-council : he is just going, and God knows when he will be back ! " " Is that all ?" I said, with a nonchalance which was far from real. " It is a little matter, which will be over in a quarter of an hour—some point they wish to be informed upon ; they are aware he has an official dinner to-day, they will not keep us fasting." I spoke thus, but my heart sank within me, and I wished myself far away. The first hour passed pretty well : men who knew each other sat down and chatted, the usual light topics of the day were discussed, and conjec- tures were made why our Amphitryon had been so suddenly called to the Tuileries. As the clock struck the second hour, some signs79 PUNCTUALITY. of impatience were evinced ; men looked at each other with an anxious expression of countenance, and faint murmurs came from the lips of two or three who not having found places to sit, were tired of waiting and standing. At the third hour discontent became general, and every one gave vent to his plaints. " When will he come back ? " said one ; "What the d—1 is he doing !" exclaims another; "It is abomin- able!" shouts a third ; and the question was raised more than once whether it would not be better to go. At the fourth the symptoms became aggravated ; some stretched their arms, at the risk of putting out an eye of a neighbour ; yawns echoed through the apartment; some faces began to assume a livid look, and when I hazarded the observation that he whose absence made us all so sad was most probably the most annoyed of us all, a deaf ear was turned to me. Attention was for a moment aroused by one of the guests. Being on more intimate terms than the others, he had made a descent into the kitchens ; he came back out of breath ; he looked as if about to announce the end of the world, and exclaimed in a broken voice, subdued yet anxious to makehandbook: of dining. 80 itself heard, " Monseigneur left no orders, and no matter how long he stays away, dinner cannot be served till his return." He ceased, and his speech created an effect not easily described. Of all these martyrs, poor kind-hearted d'Aigre- feuille was the most unhappy ; his whole frame denoted suffering, and the anguish ofLaocoon was on his face. Pale, wild-looking, almost blind, he let himself drop upon a sofa, crossed his fat little hands over his paunch, and shut his eyes, not to go to sleep, but to await death. It however did not come. About ten o'clock a carriage rolled into the court-yard ; all rose by a spontaneous movement. Hilarity succeeded discontent, and in five minutes all were at table. But the hour of appetite had passed. They seemed surprised they should commence dinner at so unusual an hour ; the jaws did not display that isochrone movement which announces good work ; and I learnt afterwards that some of the guests were ill after it. In cases like the above the method to be adopt- ed is this ; not to commence eating at once, but first swallow a glass of eau sucrée or a cup of bouillon to console the stomach, and then wait ten or fifteen minutes, otherwise the organ which hasGREAT APPETITES. 81 got out of order feels oppressed by the weight of food forced upon it. When we see in books of an early period the preparations which were made to dine two or three persons, and the enormous quantity served to one guest, we can scarcely help believing that men of past ages had greater appetites than our- selves. That appetite was greater according to the rank of the personage was a common notion, and the dignitary who had half a five-year-old ox served before him was doomed to quaff from a goblet he could scarcely lift. Some individuals have been found in modem times who bear witness to the feats of the past ; and there are examples of voracious appetites on record scarcely credible. I will spare my readers these often disgusting details, but will give two facts which I myself witnessed. Some forty years since I paid a flying visit to the Curé of Bregnier, a man of large stature, and noted for his appetite. Though scarcely noon, I found him already at table. The soup and bouilli had been removed, and a gigot of mutton à la royale, a fine capon, and large bowl of salad were brought in. G82 HANDBOOK OF DINING. He politely offered me a knife and fork which I declined, and it was well I did so, for he very soon polished off everything, eating the mutton till nothing was left but the bone, picking the capon till it was a mere skeleton, and emptying the bowl of salad. A huge cheese was then put on the table, in which the worthy curé made an angular breach of ninety-nine degrees. He washed down the whole with a bottle of wine and a decanter of water, after which he reposed. What pleased me was to observe that during the whole of this performance, which took about three quarters of an hour, the venerable pastor did not display the slightest hurry. The huge morsels he threw into his capacious mouth did not prevent him from chatting and laughing, and he finished everything with as much ease as if he had only eaten three larks. In like manner, General Bisson, who drank eight bottles of wine every morning at breakfast, did not betray it ; his glass was larger than the others', and he emptied it oftener ; but all this so quietly, that a stranger would not have supposed he had drunk more than a bottle. The second case brings back to my memory my brave compatriot General P. Sibuet, for a long'83 GENEKAL SIBUET. G 2 time first aide-de-camp of General Masséna, and killed at the passage of the Bober, in 1813. Prosper, at the age of eighteen, was a fine young man, with that happy appetite which pro- mised well for further development. He one afternoon entered the kitchen of Grenin, where the " ancients " of Belley used to meet to discuss chestnuts and a white wine called vin bourru. A magnificent turkey had just been taken off the spit, well-shaped, golden, done to a turn, and the odour from which was enough to tempt a saint. The "ancients," most of whom had dined, did not pay much attention to the savoury bird, but the digestive powers of young Prosper were stirred within him ; his mouth watered, and he exclaimed, (C I have only just dined, but I will lay a wager I will eat the whole of that turkey myself." " Sez vosu mezé, z' u payo," responded Bouvier du Bouchet, a stalwart farmer who was present, 66 è sez vos caca en rotaz, i-zet vo ket paire et may ket mezerai la restaz." * The young athlete set to work at once. He cut off a wing which he swallowed in two morsels ; * If you will eat it, I will pay for it; but if you break down, you will pay for it, and I eat the rest.HANDBOOK OF DININGr. 84 after which he cleaned his teeth by crunching the neck of the bird, and swallowed a glass of wine as an entr1 acte. He then attacked a thigh, ate it with the same sang froid, and took another glass of wine to prepare the way for the remainder. The second wing soon followed the first, and with increased zest he was about to dispatch the remaining limb, when the unfortunate farmer, with a doleful voice, stopped him, exclaiming, " Hai ! ze vraie praou qu'i-zet fota ; m'ez, monche Chibouet, poez kaet za daive, lessé m'en a m' en mesiet on mocho."* Prosper was as good a fellow as he was a good soldier; he consented, and the farmer got the carcass, no bad part, and cheerfully paid the bill for the turkey and accessories. General Sibuet used often to relate with pleasure this feat of his youth, always maintain- ing that it was simply from courtesy that he allowed the farmer a morsel, and that he would have won the wager with ease, fully confident of his powers, and those who knew his appetite when he was forty had no need to doubt the assertion. * Alas! I see it is done; but, M. Sibuet, as I have to pay for it, let me at least eat a little bit myself.G 3 FOOD. CHAP. VII. ON FOOD. What is food? The general definition is : Every- thing which nourishes us. The scientific definition is this: By food we mean those substances which, submitted to the stomach, are susceptible of ani- malisation by means of digestion, and repair the losses which the human body suffers from the course of life. Thus, the distinctive quality of food consists in the property of undergoing animal assimilation. The animal kingdom and the vegetable king- dom are those which have hitherto provided food to the human species. As yet, nothing has been extracted from minerals but remedies or poisons. Since analytic chemistry has become an adopted science, great steps in advance have been made in ascertaining the double nature of the elements of which the human body consists, and in dis- covering the substances which nature seems to have destined to restore the losses it sustains.HANDBOOK OF DINING. 86 There is great analogy between these studies, as man consists in a great measure of the same substances as the animals upon which he feeds, and it became necessary to endeavour to discover in vegetables those affinities in consequence of which they also became susceptible of animali- sation. In these two branches the most praiseworthy, and at the same time most minute investigations have been undertaken, and an analysis has been made as well of the human body as of the food which sustains it, first in their secondary depart- ments and then in their elements, beyond which there is a veil which we have not been allowed to penetrate. The greatest service rendered by chemistry to alimentary science is the discovery, or rather the precise knowledge obtained, of "osmazome." Osmazome is that eminently sapid portion of meat which is soluble in cold water, and which differs from that extractive portion which is only soluble in boiling water. The merit of a good soup or broth consists in osmazome. It forms the brown (rissole) on roasts, the rich gravy; it gives the flavour to venison and other game.OSMAZOME. 87 G 4 It is to be found chiefly in full-grown animals, and rarely in white meat, as veal, sucking-pigs, or capons. Your real connoisseur always prefers the inner thigh of a fowl, the instinct of taste having anticipated science. The discovery of the qualities of osmazome has led to the dismissal of many cooks convicted of extracting the first soup or bouillon; it formed the groundwork of all great soups; it intro- duced a cup of broth as a beverage after a bath, and induced the Abbé Chevrier to invent caul- drons with lock and key. It is this same abbé who, when he had spinach on the Friday, had it cooked on the Sunday before, and replaced on the fire every day, with an addition of fresh butter, until served up. Finally, to understand the management of this substance (in other words, to make good broth), you must never allow it to more than smile (sim- mer), — not a bad expression, considering whence it came. The qualities of osmazome, discovered after having for centuries been the delight of our forefathers, may be compared to those of alcohol, which had inebriated many generations before it88 HANDBOOK OF DINING. was discovered that it might be extracted pure by distillation. After the osmazome, by the power of boiling water is produced what is generally termed ex- tractive matter ; this latter production, mixed up with the osmazome, forms the juice of beef. To carve well, always cut at a right angle with the fibres of your joint; a joint well carved is more agreeable to the eye, pleasanter to the taste, and is more easily chewed. HOW TO MAKE SOUP OR BROTH. To make a good soup or broth, your water must be allowed to boil gradually, to prevent the al- bumen from coagulating before it is extracted; the boiling must be scarcely evident, so that all the component parts may dissolve and mix gra- dually and quietly. A few vegetables or roots may be added to give a flavour, or bread or paste (macaroni) to give more nourishment. This is a very wholesome food, being light, nu- tritious and suitable to all. It gives tone to the digestive organs. Men inclined to grow corpu- lent should take nothing but soup. You rarely get a better soup than you do in France.89 SOUP. — POULTKY. POULTRY. The whole race of fowls was created to furnish our larders and adorn our banquets. From the quail to the turkey, wherever we stumble upon a member of that numerous family, we are sure to find a light, savoury dish, suit- able to the invalid as well as to the man in the most robust health. Where is the man who has been sentenced by his doctor to the food of the pilgrim in the desert, whose lips will not play with a joyous smile when a neatly cut wing of chicken is placed before him ? It announces to him that he has been re- stored to social life. We are not satisfied with the qualities nature has given to the gallinaceous breed. Art stepped in, and, under the mask of improvement, made martyrs. They are isolated, stuffed, and brought to a size which they never were meant to attain. It is true that this extra fat is very delicious, and that it is by these damnable means that they acquire that succulence and delicacy which form the delights of our best dinners. Thus improved, poultry is to the kitchen what canvas is to the artist. We have it served up boiled, fried, roasted, hot,90 HANDBOOK OF DINING. cold, whole, hashed, with or without sauce, boned, grilled, stuffed, and always eat it with pleasured THE TURKEY. The turkey is assuredly one of the noblest gifts the New World has given to the Old. Men who pretend to be wiser than their betters have asserted that the turkey was known to the Romans, that it was served up at the marriage of Charlemagne, and that it is an error to attribute to the Jesuits the honour of this savoury importa- tion. To that paradox two objections would suffice:— 1. The name of the bird, which attests its origin : for formerly America was designated by the name of Indes Occidentales ; hence dindon. 2. The appearance of the bird, which is evi- dently foreign. Nevertheless, though perfectly convinced I was right, I made very extended researches on the subject, the result of which was : h That the turkey was introduced into Europe towards the end of the seventeenth century. 2. That it was introduced by the Jesuits, who bred a large number, chiefly at a farm which they possessed near Bourges. 3. That it was from thence they graduallyTHE TURKEY. 91 spread over France ; and still in many parts of France jésuite is a familiar term for turkey. 4. That America is the only locality where the wild turkey has been found in a state of nature. There are not any in Africa. 5. That in the farms of North America, where it is very common, it is reared either from eggs which have been taken, or from wild turkeys that have been caught young and tamed ; this makes them retain more closely their primitive plumage. Convinced by these proofs, I owe a second ex- pression of gratitude to the worthy fathers for having introduced quinine, which is still known as Jesuit's bark. The same researches proved to me that thé turkey gradually becomes acclimatised in Europe. About the middle of last century scarcely ten out of twenty young birds thrived, whilst now the pro- portions are at least fifteen. Heavy rain especially is fatal to them. Heavy drops of rain driven by the wind, falling upon their tender and uncovered head, speedily kills them. The turkey is the largest, and if not the most delicate is at least the most savoury of our domes- tic fowls. It also has the exclusive advantage of assem- bling around it all classes of society.92 HANDBOOK OP DINING. When our vine-growers and farmers give a feast on a long winter's night, what do we behold turning on the spit before a hot fire in the kitchen where the cloth is laid ? — a turkey. When the useful manufacturer, the hard-work- ing artisan, wishes to give a treat to his friends, the obligate dish is a turkey stuffed with chestnuts and sausages. And in our high gastronomic circles, in those select reunions where politics are obliged to give way to a dissertation on taste, — what is expected ? what is brought up at the second course?—a truffled turkey ! And my private memoranda contain a note that its restoring juices have more than once enlightened countenances eminently diplomatic. The importation of turkeys has become the cause of an important addition to the public purse, and has given rise to a considerable trade. By the rearing of turkeys the farmers are enabled to be more ready to pay their rent and give their daughters marriage portions ; and the good citizens who wish to regale on such delicacies must open their purse-strings wide. In this financial point of view, truffled turkeys deserve particular mention. I have reason to believe that93 SALE OF TURKEYS. from the commencement of November to the end of February 300 truffled turkeys are consumed daily in Paris, altogether 36,000 turkeys. The usual price of each is, at least, 20 francs, in all 720,000 francs, no small circulation of specie. To this must be added a similar sum for fowls, pheasants, chickens, and partridges, also truffled, which may be seen daily displayed in the windows of eating-houses, to the torture of the passers by who cannot afford to purchase them. During my sojourn at Hartford, in Connecticut, I had the happiness to shoot a wild turkey. That exploit deserves to be handed down to posterity, and I will relate it the more readily as I myself am the hero. An old American farmer invited me to pay him a visit for shooting ; he lived in the back-woods ; he promised me grey squirrels, partridges, wild- cocks (wild turkeys), and told me to bring one or two friends of my own choice with me. One fine day in October, 1794, a friend of mine, Mr. King, and myself, mounted on hacks, set out in the hope of reaching, towards evening, Mr. Bulow's farm, distant five mortal leagues from Hartford, Connecticut. Mr. King was a peculiar sort of sportsman ; he94 HANDBOOK OF DINING. was passionately fond of the exercise, but as soon as he had brought down his bird he looked upon himself as a murderer, and made moral reflections and elegies over the game, which, however, did not prevent him from recommencing. . Although the path was scarcely traced, we arrived without accident, and were received with that cordial and quiet hospitality which is ex- pressed by acts ; that is to say, in a few moments everything was examined, caressed, and lodged, man, horse, and dogs, according to custom. Two hours were devoted to visit the farm and its dependencies ; I might give a description of it, but prefer presenting the reader to four buxom lasses, Mr. Bulow's daughters, and for whom our arrival was a great event. Their ages varied from sixteen to twenty ; they were radiant with freshness and health ; and there was so much simplicity in all their movements, so much natural grace, that the most ordinary action sufficed to give them a thousand charms. Shortly after our promenade, we sat down round a well-provided table. A magnificent piece of corned beef, a stewed goose, and a splendid haunch of mutton, vegetables in plenty, and two huge foaming pots of excellent cider.AN AMERICAN FARMER. 95 When we had proved to our host that we were good sportsmen, at least as far as appetite went, he entered into the object of our visit. He indicated the best places where we were likely to find game, the landmarks to observe to guide us back, and especially the farm-houses where we could get refreshment. Whilst we were thus conversing, the ladies were preparing tea, so excellent that we drank two or three cups of it ; after which we were shown into a double-bedded room, where exercise and good cheer soon sent us into a profound sleep. On the morrow we started somewhat late on our expedition, and having reached the limits of Mr. Bulow's clearings, I found myself for the first time in my life in a virgin forest, where the sound of the axe had never been heard. I wandered along in delight,. observing the blessings and ravages of time, which creates and destroys ; I amused myself in tracing allthe periods of the life of an oak, from the moment it emerges from the earth with two small leaves, until nothing remains of it except a dark line, the dust of its heart. Mr. King reproached me for my distraction, and we commenced our sport. We shot two or three96 HANDBOOK OF DINING. of those small, delicate, fat, little grey partridges which are such tender eating. "We then knocked down six or seven grey squirrels, which are much esteemed in the neighbourhood ; ultimately our lucky star led us into a flock of wild turkeys. They rose at a short interval, one after the other, making a great noise, flying fast and screaming. Mr. King fired at the first bird that rose, and followed it ; the others were already out of shot, when a straggler rose ; I took steady aim, and the bird fell dead. It is only a sportsman who can feel the internal satisfaction I experienced at this shot. I grasped the noble bird, I turned it over and over on the ground, when I heard Mr. King hallooing to me to come and help him. I ran up, and found that all he wanted was to find his turkey, which he swore he had shot, but which had nevertheless disappeared. I put my dog in, but he led us into such a thicket that a snake could scarcely have slided through; so we gave it up as a bad job, which put my comrade into a bad temper until he got home. The rest of the day's sport is not worth mention- ing. We lost our way going back, and began to fancy we should have to sleep in the forest, when we heard the silver voices of the Misses Bulow, and97 AN AMERICAN FARMER. the deep base of the father, who had been kind enough to issue forth to meet us. The four sisters had got themselves up ; fresh dresses, new sashes, pretty little bonnets, and such dandy shoes, showed they had taken some pains on our account ; for my part, I determined to be as amiable as I could to the one who came and put her arm through mine with as much seeming right as if she had been my wife. On reaching the farm we found supper ready ; but before partaking of it we warmed ourselves for a few minutes before a blazing fire, lit on our account, although the weather did not require it. It did us much good, and roused us completely. We ate like famished men ; an ample bowl of punch crowned the entertainment, and the con- versation of our host, who opened his heart more freely than on the previous evening, led us far into the night. We spoke of the war of independence, where Mr. Bulow served as a superior officer ; of M. de la Fayette, who holds a high footing in the hearts of the Americans, who always speak of him as the Marquis ; of agriculture, which made profitable returns to America ; and finally, of France, which I loved all the more from being compelled to leave it. HHANDBOOK OF DINING. 93 As interludes to the conversation, Mr. Bulow from time to time asked his eldest daughter Maria to sing. With a charming blush, she sang Yankee-doodle, the plaintive song of Mary Stuart, Major Andre's lament, all popular in this part of the country. Maria had taken a few lessons, and was looked upon as a virtuosa, but what charmed me most was her simple, unaffected manner and rich voice. We left on the morrow, despite the earnest entreaties to remain, for I had business to attend to. Whilst the horses were getting ready, Mr. Bulow took me aside, and made the following remarkable observations to me :— " You behold in me, my dear sir, a happy man, if there is one under the canopy of heaven. All that you have seen is my own property. These stockings were knitted by my daughters; my shoes and clothes are made from my flocks ; the latter provide me with ample food, and, to the praise of our government be it said, there are thousands of farmers as happy as I am, and whose doors, like mine, have no locks to them. Taxes here are nominal. As long as they are regularly paid, we may sleep in peace. Congress favours as much as possible our rising industry;A PROBLEM. 99 H 2 agents continually visit us to purchase what we have to sell, and I have ready money in hand for a long time to come, as I have just sold my flour at twenty-four dollars per ton, the usual price having been eight. This is the result of the liberty which we have achieved and founded on sound laws. I am master here, and you will not be astonished when I tell you that the sound of the drum is never heard, and that, with the exception of the 4th of July, the glorious anniversary of our independence, neither soldiers, uniforms, nor bayonets are to be seen." During the whole of the ride home I was lost in deep thought : the reader may perhaps fancy I was pondering on the allocution of Mr. Bulow, but I had far other thoughts to meditate upon. I was thinking how I should cook my turkey ; and I was somewhat puzzled, for I feared I should not find at Hartford everything I required, for I wished to elevate a trophy by displaying my prey to advantage. I make a painful sacrifice by suppressing the details of my intense labour, the object of which was to give a distingué dinner to the Americans I invited. Let it suffice to say that I had theHANDBOOK OF DINING. 100 wings of the partridges served up en papillote, and the grey squirrels stewed in Madeira. As regards the turkey, the only roast we had, it was pleasing to the eye, flattering to the smell, and delicious to the taste. Thus, when the last particle had vanished, there was a universal mur- mur of applause, "Very good! exceedingly good! Oh ! dear Sir ! what a glorious bit ! " * GAME. Under the denomination " Grame " we under- stand all animals fit to be eaten, which live in the woods and fields in a natural state of liberty. We say "fit to be eaten," because some such animals do not come under the head of game : as foxes, badgers, crows, magpies, owls, &c. Grame may be divided into three classes : * The flesh of the wild turkey is darker and more perfumed than that of the domestic turkey. I find that my esteemed friend M. Bosc shot some wild turkeys in Carolina, which he found excellent, and of a much better flavour than those we rear in Europe. He advises all rearers of turkeys to allow them as much liberty as possible, to take them out into the fields, and even into the woods ; it will heighten their flavour, and bring them nearer the primitive species.101 GAME. H 3 The first commences with the thrush, and com- prises all lesser birds. The second ranges higher, commencing with the corn-crake, then snipe, woodcock, partridge, pheasant, rabbit and hare. This is real game. The third is better known as venison ; it com- prises the wild-boar, roe, deer, and all others of the hoof-footed species. Grame forms the charm of our dinners; it is wholesome, warm, savoury, of fine flavour, and easy of digestion to all young persons. But these qualities are not so inherent as not to require some skill in their preparation. Throw into a pot a handful of salt, some water, and a piece of beef; you will have boiled beef and broth. If, instead of beef, you throw in wild-boar or venison, the beef will be far the best of the three. But, in the hands of a clever cook, game under- goes a great many learned modifications and trans- formations, and provides the majority of the high savoury dishes which constitute cc transcendent cookery." The value of game also depends upon where it is killed. A red-partridge from Périgord has not the same flavour as a red-partridge from Sologne ;HANDBOOK OF DINING. 102 and, whilst a hare shot in a field near Paris is but a poor dish, a leveret killed in the hills of Val- romey or of the Upper Dauphiné is perhaps the most delicate of quadrupeds. Amongst the little birds, the first in order of ex- cellence is incontestable the becca-fica. It fattens as much as the ortolan, and nature has more- over endowed it with a slight bitterness, and so exquisite a flavour, that all the powers of taste are brought into play. If the becca-fica was as big as a pheasant, it would be cheap at an acre of land. It is sad that this privileged little bird is so rarely seen at Paris ; a few may be had there, but they are poor samples, not fat enough, in which their merit consists, and they will not bear com- parison with those found in the South of France.* * When I was a boy, I remember a story of one Father Fabi, a Jesuit, born in the diocese of Belley, who had a particular fancy for becca-ficas. As soon as they were cried, people ex- claimed, "Behold the becca-ficas! Father Fabi is coming." And sure enough he never failed to arrive with a friend on the 1st of September ; they regaled themselves upon them on the journey. Every one asked them to dinner, and they left on the 25th. As long as he was in France he never omitted this ornithophilite excursion, which was only interrupted when he was sent on a mission to Rome, where he died as penitentiary in 1688. Father Fabi was a man of deep learning; he wroteHOW TO EAT BECCA-FICAS. 103 H 4 Few men know how to eat a little bird ; I had the secret entrusted to me by Canon Charcot, a born gourmand and perfect gastronome, long be- fore the latter word was adopted. Take a fat little bird by the beak, sprinkle a little salt over it, take out the gullet, put the bird cle- verly into your mouth, bite him off close to your fingers, and chew him manfully ; the result will be an abundance of juice to envelope the whole organ, and you will enjoy a pleasure unknown to the vulgar. " Odi profanum vulgus, et arceo." — Hor. Amongst game proper, the quail is the most mignon and pleasant. A fat quail is pleasing by its taste, form, and colour. It is a mistake to serve up a quail otherwise than roasted, or en papillote, because its flavour evaporates quickly, and, if brought in contact with a fluid, is gone in a moment. The snipe (or woodcock) is also a good bird, but few men know how fully to appreciate its value. A snipe is never in its full glory except various works on theology and physics, in one of which he endeavours to prove that he discovered the circulation of the blood before, or at least as soon as, Harvey.HANDBOOK OF DINING. 104 when roasted before the eyes of the sportsman, and especially of the sportsman who has killed it ; then it is perfect, and the mouth waters with delight. Above these, and indeed above them all, the pheasant takes highest rank; but few mortals know how to serve it up. A pheasant eaten within the first eight days after it has been shot, is not worth a partridge or a chicken, because its merit consists in its aroma. Science has investigated the expansion of this aroma, and experience has proved it; and a pheasant kept till it is on the point of decom- position is a morsel worthy of the most exalted gourmands. HOW TO COOK A PHEASANT. The pheasant is an enigma, the key of which is only known to the adepts ; they alone know how fully to enjoy it. Every substance has its apogee of esculence ; some attain it before their full development, as capers, asparagus, grey partridges, pigeons, &c. ; others arrive at it when in the full bloom of the existence allotted to them, as melons, most fruits,HOW TO COOK. A PHEASANT. 105 mutton, beef, venison, and red partridges ; finally, others when decomposition commences, and of these especially the pheasant. This latter bird, if eaten within three days after it has been shot, has no peculiar flavour. It has not the delicacy of a fowl, nor the flavour of a quail. Taken at the proper point, the flesh is tender, sublime, and of high flavour, partaking at once of poultry and venison. This desirable point is when decomposition commences; then its aroma is developed. This moment manifests itself to the profane by a slight smell, and by a slight change of colour under the feathers in front; but the inspired guess it by a sort of instinct which acts on various occasions ; for instance, a good cook knows at a glance when he ought to take his fowl off the spit. When the pheasant has arrived at this state, it must be plucked, but not before. Small slices of firm and sound lard must then be stuck on to it (j)iquê). It is by no means an indifferent matter as re- gards plucking a pheasant too soon. Founded experience has shown that those which have been left in their feathers had a finer flavour thanHANDBOOK OF DINING. 106 those plucked, either because the contact of the air neutralises some portion of the aronia, or be- cause a portion of the juices destined to nourish the feathers is absorbed. Thus prepared, it has to be stuffed. This is done as follows : Take two snipes; bone them, and clear them so as to make two lots ; the first of the meat, the second of the liver and entrails. Make a stuffing of the meat, cutting it up small with beef-marrow, cooked by steam, a little lard (rape), pepper, salt, fine herbs, and a suf- ficient quantity of good truffles to fill the inside of the pheasant. You must be careful that the stuffing does not protrude, which is sometimes a difficulty, when the bird is rather far gone. But it can be done with a little skill, by attaching a crust of bread. Then take a piece of toast, which must exceed the size of the pheasant two inches each way, and lay the pheasant upon it longways; then take the livers and entrails of the snipes, and pound them with two large truffles, an anchovy, a little lard, and a suitable piece of fresh butter. Spread this paste equally over your toast, and then place the pheasant, prepared as above, over107 HOW TO COOK A PHEASANT. it, so that all the juice which issues from it whilst roasting may be soaked in. When the pheasant is done, serve it up reclining gracefully on the toast, place slices of lemon round, and you need not be anxious for the result. This high-flavoured dish ought to be washed down with Burgundy (vin du crû de la Haute- Bourgogne). I arrived at this truth after a long series of observations, which gave me as much labour as going through Euclid. A pheasant thus cooked is worthy of the table of the noblest in the land. I saw one cooked by that worthy chef Picard, at the Château-de-la-Grange, at my charming friend's Madame de Ville-Plaine. It was brought up in solemn procession by Louis, the major-domo. It was examined as minutely as a new bonnet from Madame Herbault's ; it was smelt with anti- cipations of delight; and during this learned inves- tigation the eyes of the ladies twinkled like stars, their lips became the colour of coral, and their features beamed with delight. A pheasant thus dressed is called faisan à la Sainte-A lliance. On another occasion, I had one served up to a board of magistrates of the Supreme Court, whoHANDBOOK OF DINING. 108 know that it is necessary at times to put off sena- torial dignity, and to whom I proved, without much difficulty, that good cheer is the natural compensation for the ennuis of the cabinet. After a suitable examination, the senior judge, in a serious voice pronounced the word "excellent ! " All the others bowed consent, and the judgment passed unanimously. During the deliberation, I had observed that the noses of these venerable senators gave very evi- dent twitches of satisfaction, their brow was calm and serene, and a semi-smile hovered on their lips. However, these marvellous effects are in the nature of things. A pheasant, cooked according to the above receipt, already a noble bird itself, becomes impregnated externally with the savoury fat of the lard, which carbonises; inside, it be- comes impregnated with the odorous gases which escape from the snipe and truffle. The toast, already so well provided, receives a triple supply of juices from the bird whilst roasting. Thus, of all these assembled good things, not an atom escapes appreciation, and considering the excellence of this dish, I deem it worthy of the table of the most august. " Parve, nec in video, sine me, liber, ibis in aulam."109 FISH. FISH. Some wiseacres have maintained that the Ocean was the common cradle of every living thing; that even man was born in the sea, and that his actual state is only due to the action of air and to the habits he was obliged to assume in this new element. However this may be, it is at least certain that the empire of water contains an immense quan- tity of living things of every form and shape, which enjoy vital functions in various degrees, and on a system which is not the same as that of warm-blooded animals. It is no less true that it offers an enormous mass of food, and that, in the present state of science, it provides our table with most agreeable variety. Fish, less nourishing than meat, more succulent than vegetables, is a mezzo-termine which suits nearly every temperament, and may be even al- lowed to convalescents. The Greeks and Eomans, though less advanced than us in the art of preparing fish, nevertheless held it in high esteem, pushing their refinement so far as to discover by the taste in what watersHANDBOOK OF DINING. 110 it had been caught. They kept them in tanks or in fish-ponds ; and history records the cruelty of Vadius Pollion, who fed his eels with the bodies of slaves he had slain for the purpose — an act of cruelty which the Emperor Domitian highly dis- approved, but which he ought to have punished. A great discussion has arisen as to whether sea- fish or fresh-water fish ought to bear the palm of superiority. The question, doubtless, will never be decided, as the Spanish proverb has it, 66Sobre los gustos no hai disputa" (Every man his own taste). No defined character can be given to these fugitive sensations, and there is no scale to judge whether a cod-fish, a sole, or turbot, is better than a salmon-trout or a tench of six or seven pounds. It has been generally agreed that fish contains less nourishment than meat, either because it does not contain any osmazome, or because, being lighter in weight, it contains less volume in the same space. Shell-fish, especially oysters, contain very little nutritious matter; this is why a large quan- tity may be eaten before dinner without interfering with the repast which follows immediately. It may be remembered that not very long since every dinner commenced with oysters, and that many of the guests swallowed some few dozen, evenIll OYSTERS. as many as twelve dozen. I wished to ascertain the weight of this avant-garde, and I found that a dozen oysters (water included) weigh four ounces, or twelve dozen three pounds. This satisfied me that the same men who eat a hearty dinner afterwards, would have been completely appeased, had they eaten the same quantity of meat, even of chicken. Whilst at Versailles, in 1798, as commissary for the Directory, I was brought continually in con- tact with Sieur Laperte, greffier of the tribunal, a great amateur of oysters. He said he never yet had been able to eat enough at one sitting, or, as he expressed it, " tout son soûW I resolved to procure him that satisfaction, and I invited him to dinner. He came. I kept time with him up to the third dozen, when I let him go on alone. He had eaten thirty-two dozen ; the operation taking an hour, the person who opened them being rather slow ; and as I had not dined, I stopped him when he ap- peared only in full swing : " Mon cher," I said, " it is not your fate to eat your soul of oysters to- day. Let us dine ! " We did so, and he made as hearty a dinner as if he had been fasting. The ancients extracted two sorts of seasoning from fishes, muria and garum.112 HANDBOOK OF DINING. The first was simply brine of the tunny, or, to define it closer, the liquid substance which the mixture of salt caused to run from off the fish. Garum, which brought a much higher price, is not so well known to us. It is supposed to have been taken by pressure from the entrails of the scomber, or mackerel; but, then, why its high price? There is reason to believe it was some foreign sauce; perhaps nothing else than soy, which we import from India, and which consists of the result of fish fermented with mushrooms. Some races, from their peculiar position, are doomed to live almost entirely upon fish; they also feed their cattle with them, which become ac- customed to this unusual food; they manure their land with fish, and yet the sea which surrounds them never ceases to provide them always with the same quantity. It has been observed that such races do not possess so much courage as beef-eating nations; they are pale, which is not surprising, because, according to the elements of which fish consists, it is more calculated to increase the lymph than repair the blood. Numerous examples of longevity have been ob- served among ichthyophagi. This may be attri-113 ICHTHYOPHAGI. buted either to the fact of light and unsubstantial food obviating apoplexy, or that the juices it con- tains, being only destined by nature to form bones and gristle, the growth is retarded, and takes a. longer time in the development of all those parts of the body, the solidification of which becomes finally the cause of death. However this may be, fish, in the hands of a good cook, may become an inexhaustible source of enjoyment; it is served up whole, in pieces, boiled, fried, à P huile, in wine, hot, or cold; and it is always well received ; but it never deserves so warm a reception as when served up as a matelote. Analytic gastronomy has endeavoured to exa- mine the effects of a fish regimen on the animal economy. The results obtained are concordant, and must have doubtless been ignored by those ecclesiastical legislators, who ordered that fish should be eaten as a fast at least four days in the week. Kegarded as a species, fish offers to the philo- sopher an inexhaustible source of meditation and wonder. The varied forms of these strange crea- tures, the senses they are wanting in, the limited ones they possess, the influence which the dif- i114 HANDBOOK OF DINING. ference of the centre in which they are doomed to live, to breathe and move, must have exercised upon all this, extend the sphere of our ideas, and of the indefinite modifications which may result from the matter and movement of life. As for myself, I entertain for fishes a sentiment which borders upon respect, and which arises from the intimate conviction that they are evidently antediluvian creatures ; the great cataclysm, which drowned our grand-uncles about the eighteenth century of the creation of the world, must have been for fishes a time of rejoicing, of conquest, and festivity. TRUFFLES. Whoever says " Truffle," pronounces a grand word which arouses at once the feelings of both sexes. The origin of the truffle is unknown. It is found, but whence it is derived is still a secret. The most skilful men of science have endeavoured to analyse it, hoping to get the seed, so as to sow and reap. Vain efforts ! deluded hopes ! No crop rewarded their labour ; and this is perhaps no great evil ; for as the price of truffles is somewhatTRUFFLES. 115 a fancy one, they would perhaps be esteemed less if plentiful and cheap. "Kejoice, my dear Madam," I once said to Madame de V—, "an invention has just been presented to the Society of Encouragement, by means of which the finest lace can be made almost for nothing." "What!" replied the fair lady, with a look of sovereign indifference, " if lace was cheap, do you suppose we should wear such rubbish ? " The truffle was known to the Eomans ; but the French sort does not seem to have reached them. They imported truffles from Greece, Africa, and chiefly from Libya ; they had a white and pink ap- pearance; those from Libya were most sought after, and had the finest flavour. Gustus elementa per omnia quaerunt. {Juvenal. ) From the Eomans down to our own days there was a long interregnum, and the resurrection of truffles is of a recent date ; I have waded through many receipt books, where no mention is made of them; it may even be asserted that the gene- ration, which is about to pass away, witnessed it. About 1780, truffles were rare at Paris; they were to be had only, and in small quantity, at the I 2HANDBOOK OF DINING. 116 t; Hôtel des Américains"and " Hôtel de Provence;" a truffled turkey was a piece of luxury, only to be found on the table of noble lords or of kept women. We are indebted to the green-grocers for the increased supply of truffles. Perceiving that they were sought after, and were well paid, they had them brought by the mail, and paid agents to procure them. In 1825 the glory of the truffle may be said to have reached its culminating point ; no good din- ner was without its pièce truffée, no entree, how- ever good, is perfect without truffles. Whose mouth does not water at the announcement of " truffes à la provençale?" A sauté de truffes is always placed before the lady of the house, who does the honours : in short the truffle is the ec diamond" of the cuisine. Peculiar qualities have been attributed to truf- fles. I will only give one anecdote which, gentle reader, you had better not read. I questioned an old lady friend of mine, whether there was any truth in the common opinion that truffles had an influence upon the heart. She gave me as a reply the following anecdote : —117 TRUFFLES. I 3 " Sir," she said, " in the days when suppers were still the fashion, I was supping one day en trio with my husband and one of his friends. Verseuil (that was his name) was a handsome young man, not devoid of wit, and a constant visitor at our house ; but he had never said anything to me to make me fancy he wanted to make love ; ^and when he did pay me little attentions they were paid with so much good nature that a woman must have been a fool to have heeded them. It seems that this evening we were destined to be alone, as my husband had an appointment on business. Our supper was light, but we had a superb vo- laille truffée, sent to me as a present by the sub- delegate of Perigueux. At that day it was a rare present. The truffles were delicious, and, as you know, I love them ; but I was moderate, and drank only one glass of champagne; I had that pre- sentiment that something unusual was going to happen which is a peculiar instinct in women. My husband left us very early, leaving me alone with Verseuil. Conversation went on on every- day subjects, but it soon partook of a more fa- miliar turn. Verseuil made himself most agree- able, and perceiving that I only laughed at his pretty sayings he became animated. - I woke as118 HANDBOOK OF DINING. from a dream. I was obliged to be severe to stop him. He left, and I went to bed, when I fell at once into a deep sleep. When I awoke in the morning I meditated upon what had passed, and reproached myself with want of energy. I ought to have stopped him at once, pulled the bell, and done everything which I did not do. Well, Sir, I attribute it all to the truffles — and I never eat them afterwards without being on my guard." This frank avowal by no means lays down a law. I made deep investigations, and the result is that I believe truffles have a peculiar influence upon the more tender feelings of the human species. White truffles are found in Piedmont, and they are much esteemed ; they have a slight smack of garlic, which is, however, not disagreeable, as it does not remain. The best French truffles come from Périgord and Upper Provence ; they are in full flavour in January. They are also found at Bugey, but they do not keep. I tried at four different times to have them at Paris, but the attempt only succeeded once. Truffles from Bour- gogne and the Dauphiné are of inferior quality; they are tough and tasteless. There are " truffles " and " truffles."TRUFFLES. 119 I Dogs and pigs are trained especially to discover truffles ; but there are men whose eye is so cor- rect they can tell at a glance where truffles are to be found, and they can even predict their size and quality. Is the truffle indigestible ? We say, no. And we come to this decision on the following grounds : — 1. It is easily chewed : is light of weight. 2. During an observation of fifty years we have never known a regular truffle-eater suffer from indigestion. 3. "We have the same judgment from the most celebrated practitioners in Paris, a city devoted to truffles par excellence. 4. Finally, those learned doctors eat more truf- fles themselves than any one else. I need only mention Dr. Malouet who absorbed a sufficient quantity to give an elephant an indigestion. I, therefore, maintain that the truffle is nutri- tious as well as agreeable, and taken with mode- ration is like a letter slipped in at the post-office. It is true that a man may feel unwell after a great dinner at which truffles were served up. But this only happens to men who cram them- selves with a host of other good things. Had I 4HANDBOOK OF DINING. 120 they afterwards eaten as many potatoes as truffles the result would have been the same. It is so very easy to be mistaken as to the cause of indigestion. One day I asked to dinner an old gentleman, Mr. S , a noted bon-vivant. Whether it was that I knew his tastes, or that I wished to prove to my guests that I had their happiness at heart, I was lavish in truffles. I had a magnificent turkey admirably stuffed. M. S did full justice to it. On reaching home he was taken with violent spasms. A doctor was sent for, and the symptoms became so serious that some alarm was felt. Suddenly nature came to the rescue. He opened his mouth and shot out a fragment of truffle intact, which bounded back from the wall. The bad symptoms ceased immediately. Poor S 's teeth, which had been doing service for many years, were not quite up to their work ; some had emigrated and others were not so firm as they should have been. The fragment had stuck in the pylorus. There was no indigestion. He fell into a comfort- able sleep, was perfectly well next day, and attacked truffles with as much energy afterwards as ever, taking care, however, to masticate them more carefully. §121 SUGrÀK. Poets have not been wanting to sing the glories of the truffle : the following " impromptu " was written by M. B. de V , a distinguished amateur :— Buvons à la truffe noire, Et ne soyons point ingrats; Elle assure la victoire Dans les plus charmans combats. Au secours Des amours, Du plaisir la Providence Envoya cette substance ; Qu'on en serve tous les jours. SUGAE. In the advanced state of science of the present day, we understand by Sugar a substance, sweet to the taste, susceptible of crystallisation, and which by fermentation is dissoluble into carbonic acid and alcohol. Sugar, as formerly understood, was the arundo saccharifera, the thick crystallised sugar of the cane. The sugar-cane is a native plant of India; nevertheless it is true that the Eomans did not use sugar habitually. There are a few passages in ancient authors which may lead to the supposé122 HANDBOOK OF DINING. tion that a sweet juice had been discovered in certain reeds. Lucan says :— "Quique bibunt tenera dulces ab arundine succos," but as regards sugar as we now have it, the Eomans were totally ignorant. It has been brought to perfection step by step, and has become a most important article of commerce; it is a source of fortune to the cultivator and the trader, and for the governments that levy a tax upon it. For some time it was supposed that the heat of the tropics was requisite for the production of sugar; but about the year 1740, Margraff dis- covered it in various plants of the temperate zone, more especially in beet-root. The investigations of Professor Achard of Berlin confirmed the fact. The events at the commencement of the nine- teenth century having rendered sugar scarce and dear in France, investigations were set on foot by the government. The result was that sugar was discovered to exist in the grape, chestnut, and potato, but more especially in the beet-root. The cultivation of the beet-root became quite a separate branch, and manufactories of beet-root sugar sprang up in various parts of France. On the restoration of peace, when the price of colonial123 COFFEE. sugar fell, the beet-root manufactories declined. A vulgar idea—perfectly erroneous—got abroad, that beet-root sugar was not so good as colonial sugar. Science has proved its fallacy. Eau sucrée is a refreshing beverage, wholesome, agreeable, and sometimes salutary as a remedy. It is made use of for syrups, ices, (which were introduced by Catherine de Medici) liqueurs, biscuits, creams, blanc-manger, according to the liquids with which it is mixed. Mixed with coffee it brings out the aroma. Preserves, marmalades, candies, all depend upon it. In fact its use is general. COFFEE. Coffee pounded in a mortar is much more aromatic than ground as is usual. The Turks make the best coffee. That coffee has an effect upon the brain there can be no doubt. A man who takes coffee for the first time is sure to be deprived of a portion of his sleep. Voltaire and Buffon took a great deal of coffee ; it is not improbable that they are indebted thereto, the first for the admirable lucidity observable in his writings, the latter for the enthusiastic harmony ofHANDBOOK OP DINING. 124 his style. It is evident that his treatises on "Man" "the Dog"—"the Tiger"—"the Lion" and "the Horse " were written in a state of extraordinary cerebral exaltation. The wakefulness caused by coffee is not painful ; the intellect is clear, but there is no desire to sleep. That is all. Yet, in the long-run it may prove noxious. I recommend all mothers not to allow their growing children to drink coffee. It curtails their growth and makes mummies of them. The Duke of Massa, when Minister of Justice, asked me to do some work for him which I knew would occupy the whole night, and it was to be done at once. I took two strong cups of coffee after dinner. I returned home at seven o'clock, but instead of the papers I found a letter to say that owing to unforeseen circumstances I should not receive them till the next day. I returned to the house where I had dined, and played two or three rubbers. I returned home and went to bed, hoping that I should have a few hours' sleep at least. In vain. My head became clearer; I was in a violent state of mental agitation. I got up, and put a little story, which I had read the previous day, into verse. But sleep would notCHOCOLATE. 125 come. I never shut an eye all night nor next day. I remained forty hours without sleep. CHOCOLATE. The first men who landed in America were urged by the thirst for gold. At that period almost the only value recognised was that extracted from mines ; agriculture and commerce were in their infancy, and political economy still unborn. The Spaniards discovered precious metals,—a ste- rile discovery, as it depreciates in proportion as it multiplies when compared to the other active means to add to riches. But those lands where a sun of every degree of heat gives extreme fecundity to the earth, were proper for the cultivation of coffee; moreover the potato, indigo, vanille, cocoa, &c, were dis- covered there. Those are the real riches of the country. If these discoveries took place despite the bar- riers opposed to curiosity by a jealous nation, it may reasonably be hoped that in succeeding years they will be tenfold and that the investigations of scientific men of Europe in unexplored lands will enrich the three kingdoms with a multitude of newHANDBOOK OF DINING. 126 substances, which will give us new sensations, as did vanille, and will increase our alimentary resources like the cocoa. It has been agreed to call chocolate the mixture which results from the bean of the cocoa roasted with sugar and cinnamon. Sugar is an integral part, for with cocoa alone you can only make cocoa paste and not chocolate. When vanille is added to the sugar, cocoa, and cinnamon, we have the ne plus ultra of the composition. The cocoa-tree is a product of South America ; it is found on the islands and on the main land ; the trees which grow on the banks of the Maracaibo, in the valleys of Caracas, and in the rich province of Sokonusco are esteemed the best, the berry is larger, the juice less acid, and the aroma finer. Since those countries have become more accessible it has been able to form a comparison ; and an exercised palate is never deceived. The Spanish ladies of the New World are fond of chocolate to excess. Not satisfied with taking it two or three times a day they even have it sometimes brought to them in church. For this they have often been reproved by the bishops. But they finally winked at it, and the venerable father, Escobar, whose metaphysics were as subtile127 CHOCOLATE. as his morals were accommodating, formally de- clared that chocolate à Veau did not interfere with fasting, quoting the old adage, " Liqui- dum non frangit jejunium" Chocolate was introduced into Spain about the seventeenth century ; it became soon popular by the decided predilection shown for it by the priest- hood and the women. The taste still prevails, and throughout the whole of the Peninsula at the present day it is customary to offer chocolate as refreshment to a visitor. Chocolate crossed the mountains with Anne of Austria, daughter of Philip II., and wife of Louis XIII. The Spanish monks also introduced it by the presents they sent to their brethren in France. The different Spanish ambassadors also brought it into use: and at the commencement of the Eegency it was in more general use than coffee, because then it was taken as agreeable food, whilst coffee was only sipped as a luxury and a curiosity. LinnaBus styles cocoa, cacao theobroma, oree drink of the gods/' Attempts have been made to dis- cover the reason for so strong a denomination ; some attribute it to the fact that he was passion- ately fond of chocolate ; others that he wished to128 HANDBOOK OF DINING. please his confessor; others out of gallantry to please a Queen who had introduced it. Chocolate has been the subject of deep disser- tations, with a view to determine its nature and properties, and to place it in the category of hot, cold, or temperate food ; it must be owned that these learned documents have served but little to the establishment of the truth. But time and experience, those two great masters, have established that chocolate, carefully prepared, is as wholesome as it is agreeable ; that it is nutritious and easy of digestion ; that it does not hurt the complexion as coffee is supposed to do, on the contrary, it clears it ; that it is well suited to men of all sedentary or mental occupa- tions, to literary men, barristers, and travellers; finally, that it will not hurt the weakest stomachs ; that it has proved beneficial in chronic diseases, and becomes the last resource in affections of the pylorus. Chocolate is indebted for these various proper- ties to the fact of being an eleosaccharum ; there are few substances which contain in equal volume so many nutritious particles. During the war, cocoa was scarce, and very dear; attempts were made to replace it, but all.CHOCOLATE. 129 in vain ; one of- the benefits of peace was, to de- liver us from the many concoctions, which were as much chocolate as chicory is coffee. Some people complain they cannot digest choco- late ; others, on the contrary, pretend that it does not contain sufficient nourishment, and digests too soon. It is very probable that the first have only themselves to blame, and that they purchase bad chocolate ; good chocolate will not offend the most delicate stomach. As regards the others, the remedy is easy ; let them have a chop or a kidney with it, and let them thank Heaven for giving them a strong digestion. I will now mention a fact which is the result of observation. After having made a hearty and excellent breakfast, swallow a cup of good chocolate, and within three hours the digestive organs will have performed their functions. From zeal for the science, I requested various ladies to try it ; they first said they should die, but found it answer so well that they glorified the professor. Persons who take chocolate, generally speak- ing, enjoy constant good health ; they are less subject to a host of little ills which jar upon the K130 HANDBOOK OF DINING. happiness of life ; their embonpoint remains the same ; these two advantages may be verified in society amongst those whose regimen is known. In Spain, they make very good chocolate ; Italian chocolate is not so pleasant to the taste, the berry being generally overroasted, which gives a bitter flavour. To make good chocolate, dissolve about an ounce and a half, for one cup, in water heated gradually, stirring it with a wooden spoon. Let it boil for a quarter of an hour, and serve up hot.131 HOW TO FRY. K 2 CHAP. VIII. HOW TO FKY. It was a fine May day ; the sun shed its warm rays on the roofs of the houses of the great city of delights, and the streets (a rare occurrence) were free from mud and dust. The heavy diligences had, for some time, ceased to shake the pavement ; luggage vans were silent, and only a few open carriages, full of fair ladies with elegant bonnets, passed at intervals. It was three o'clock in the afternoon, when the professor sat down in his arm chair to meditate. His right leg rested vertically on the carpet ; his extended left leg formed a diagonal ; his back reposed comfortably on the cushions, and his hands rested on the lion heads that adorn the arms of that venerable household relic. His ele- vated brow indicated deep thought, and his mouth betrayed amiable distractions. His whole attitude was one of meditation; and any one beholdingHANDBOOK OF DINING. 132 him would have mentally observed : That is a sage ! Thus established, the professor sent for his head cook ; and shortly he entered, ready to receive advice, lessons, or orders. " Maître la Planche," said the professor, with that grave accent which penetrates every heart, " every man who dines at my table proclaims you a potagiste de première classe : that is well, for the potage is the first consolation of a hungry stomach ; but I am sorry to find that you have much to learn in the art of frying. " I heard you sigh yesterday, when that magni- ficent sole was served up pale, soft, and dis- coloured. My friend E shot a glance of disapprobation towards you ; M. H. E. turned his gnomonic nose to the west, and President S. de- plored the failure as a public calamity. " This misfortune has befallen you for having neglected theory, the full importance of which you do not appreciate. You are a little obstinate, and I have some difficulty in making you under- stand that the phenomena which take place in your laboratory are nothing else than the execu- tion of the eternal laws of nature ; and that cer- tain things which you do carelessly, simply becauseHOW TO FKY. 133 K 3 you have seen others do so. emanate, nevertheless, from the highest abstractions of science. " Listen to me, then, with attention, and learn, that you may not again have to blush at your performance. " Liquids exposed to the action of fire do not all attain the same degree of heat ; nature has made them unequal in this respect ; it is an order of things, the secret of which she reserves, and which we call calorific capacity. " Thus, you may with impunity dip your finger in boiling spirits of wine ; you would draw it out very quickly from brandy; still quicker from water, and a rapid immersion in boiling oil would make a cruel wound, for oil is capable of three times the heat of water. "It is consequent upon this disposition that boiling liquids act differently upon sapid bodies thrown into them. Those put into water become soft, dissolve, and form a soup ; those, on the contrary, put into oil, condense, acquire a hue more or less brown, and end by carbonising. " In the former case, the water dissolves, and extracts the internal juices of the substances thrown in ; in the latter, those juices are jare- served, because oil cannot dissolve them ; if those134 HANDBOOK OF DINING, substances dry up, it is because a continuation of the heat finally makes them evaporate in hu- midity. " The two methods have also different names ; the process of boiling substances intended for the table in oil or grease is called 'frying? I think I have already explained to you that oil and grease are almost synonymous, grease being simply con- densed oil, and oil liquid grease. "Fried things are pleasant dishes; they make a tasty variation. The whole merit consists in the formation of the crust, or, to use the proper word, * la surprise? To do this well, the boiling liquid must be sufficiently hot for its action to be sudden and instantaneous ; it requires a good well-kept- up fire to procure this result. To ascertain whether the liquid is hot enough, dip a piece of bread into the frying-pan and keep it there for five or six seconds ; if you withdraw it firm and coloured, make your fry at once ; if not, stir your fire and try it again. The surprise or immersion once done, moderate your fire that the juices thus impri- soned may undergo, under a prolonged heat, the change which unites them and enhances their fla^apur. " You will, doubtless, have observed that theHOW TO FRY. 135 K 4 surface of well-fried objects will not dissolve either salt or sugar, which, nevertheless, they need according to their peculiar nature. Therefore you must reduce both those aggredients to the finest powder, and use a sprinkling box. fs I will not tell you what oil or grease to use ; your library contains sufficient books on that subject. 66 However, you must not forget that when you have to fry trout, which scarcely exceed a quarter of a pound, which have been caught in some run- ning stream, you must take the very best olive oil ; this simple dish, well fried and adorned with slices of lemon, is worthy to be offered to a Cardinal. " A Neapolitan, dining with me one day when I had this dish, exclaimed,6 Questo è un vero boccone di Cardinale.'' ' Why,' I retorted, 6 don't you say a dish for a King ? ' 6 My dear Sir,' he re- plied, i we Italians do not believe that kings are gourmets; their repasts are too short and too solemn ; but Cardinals ! eh ! ! ! ' and he chuckled with delight, { Hou hou, hou hou, hou hou ! ' " Cook smelts in the same way. They are the beccafica of the water ; same smallness, same perfume, same superiority. These two prescriptions are also founded on the136 HANDBOOK OF DINING. nature of things, and experience has taught that olive oil should only be used for operations which can be quickly done, or that do not require great heat. « You took charge of my 6 lower regions,' and you were the first man to serve up an immense turbot, fried. Great was the joy that day amongst the elect ! " Gro, continue to give your usual attention to everything ; but do not forget that as soon as the guests arrive in my salon, their whole happiness is in our hands."137 THIRST. CHAP. IX. THIRST. A man dies much sooner of thirst than he does of hunger. Men who have been provided with water have been known to live for eight days without eating, whilst a man without beverage cannot live beyond five. The reason of this difference is, that the latter dies of exhaustion and weakness, whilst the former suffers from a burning fever, which increases till he dies. Water is the only beverage which really ap- peases thirst. This is why we drink very little of it. All other drinks are simply palliatives. If a man drank nothing but water, he could never have been accused of drinking without being thirsty. Beverages have one peculiar quality ; they have immediate effect, and give immediate relief. Grive a worn-out man the most substantial food ;HANDBOOK OF DINING. 138 he will turn from it with disgust : pour a glass of wine or brandy down his throat; he will revive. There is a curious fact well worthy of remark, namely, that sort of instinct, as general as it is imperious, which makes us desire strong drink. "Wine, the most pleasant of beverages, whether we are indebted for it to Noah who planted the vine, or to Bacchus who squeezed out the juice of the grape, dates from the childhood of the world ; and beer, attributed to Osiris, goes back to times beyond certainty. All men, even savages, have been so tormented by this thirst for strong drink, that they have procured it however limited their knowledge. They have soured the milk of their domestic animals ; they have extracted the juice of fruits and roots, and have stumbled upon the elements of fermentation. And wherever we go in society we find men provided with strong drink. They use it at their feasts, their sacrifices, their mar- riages, their burials, in fact at every solemnity. For centuries wine was drunk and sung before it was supposed that spirit, which gave it its strength, could be extorted from it. But the Arabs having taught us the art of distillation139 THIEST. which they had discovered to extract perfume from flowers, more especially from the rose, so celebrated in their writings, it occurred that the flavour of wine might be extracted, and, step by step alcohol, spirits of wine, brandy, were ex- tracted. Alcohol is the monarch of liquids. America was subjugated by alcohol as much as by gunpowder. This thirst for a liquid which nature has wrap- ped in mystery, this extraordinary desire trace- able in every race of man, in every clime, under every temperature, is well worthy the attention of the philosophic observer. I have pondered over it as others have done, and I am inclined to place the desire for fer- mented liquors side by side with anxiety for the future, for both are unknown to the brute creation, and I regard them as distinctive features of the master-piece of the last sublunary revolution.140 HANDBOOK OF DINING. CHAP. X. LA GOURMANDISE. We have no equivalent in the English language for the word " gourmandise " or " gourmand." "Epicurism" and epicure are perhaps the nearest approach. It is curious that Savarin throughout his work makes use of the expression " gourmand" to denote a refined eater. The French language possesses another definition, which Eoget would do well to insert into the next edition of his w Thesaurus" viz. Gourmet* Our English idea of a "gourmand" is a man who has a voracious appetite, likes good things, and swallows them wholesale; in fact — a glutton. Savarin's "gourmand" is the "man of taste" as defined in Aphorism II. : " Animals feed ; man eats ; it is only the man of intellect who knows how to eat." * I allude to the sixth edition of this valuable work; perhaps it may be in a later one.141 LA GOURMANDISE. Henceforth, then, gentle reader, remember that in these pages " gourmand " and " gourmandise " imply the refinement of the " Art of Dining." Social "gourmandise" combines the elegance of Athens with the luxury of Eome and the re- finement of Paris. It implies intellect, taste, and judgment. It is a passionate preference which grows upon man for objects which flatter his taste. Gourmandise is the very reverse of gluttony ; it is the enemy of every excess. A man who eats till he gets an indigestion, or who gets drunk, is immediately struck off the list of " gourmands." Gourmandise comprises refined taste for the most delicate dishes, even preserves and pastry. It admits women into its ranks. In whatever light you look upon it, it is deserving of praise and encouragement. In a physical point of view it is the result and proof of a healthy and perfect state of the organs destined for nutrition. In a moral point of view it is an implicit resignation to the behests of the Creator, who having ordained that we should eat to live, invites us thereto by appetite, supports us by taste, and rewards us by pleasure.HANDBOOK OF DINING. 142 In the point of view of political economy, "gourmandise" is the common link which unites nations by the reciprocal exchange of articles of daily use. It sends wines from pole to pole ; brandy, sugar, groceries, and provisions of every description, even to eggs and melons, are all at its command. It regulates the price of good and bad articles of food according to their respective merits. It keeps up the emulation of sportsmen, fishermen, and gardeners, whose labours adorn the tables of the rich. Finally, it gives employment to a host of cooks, pastry-cooks, confectioners, and others, beyond calculation. In the present state of society, it would be dif- ficult to imagine a people living exclusively on bread and vegetables. If such a nation existed, it would infallibly be subjugated by a carnivorous army, as the Hindoos have successively fallen a prey to all who attacked them, or else it would be converted by the cuisine * of its neighbours in like manner as the Boeotians became gourmands after the battle of Leuctra. * There is not an equivalent for the word cuisine in the English language.143 LA GOURMANDISE. To the Exchequer i( gourmandise " is a god- send. Everything good we eat is taxed, and " gourmands " are the main support of the Trea- sury. What saved France from bankruptcy in 1815 ? — " La gourmandise." When the Allies entered Paris, the sums they spent paid the indemnity. Very made his for- tune ; Achard commenced his ; Beauvilliers made a third fortuDe ; and Madame Sullot of the Palais Koyal sold 12,000 petits pâtés daily. When the army entered Champagne, it took 600,000 bottles of wine from the renowned cellars of M. Moet d'Epernay. The owner consoled him- self for the loss when he found the pillagers retained the taste of his wine, and the orders he afterwards received amply compensated. him for the robbery. Gourmandise is not confined to the male sex. There is nothing so agreeable to behold as a " pretty gourmande." Her napkin is well placed ; one of her hands rests on the table ; the other armed with a fork conveys delicate little morsels to her mouth ; her eyes sparkle ; her lips are vermilion ; her conversation is agreeable ; every movement isHANDBOOK OF DINING. 144 graceful ; she is not wanting in that clever coquet- terie * which a clever woman knows so well how to turn to account. With such advantages, she is irresistible ; and Cato the Censor himself would be moved. The inclination of the fair sex for good-living is a natural instinct, because it is favourable to their good looks. A series of observations has convinced me that ladies who live well remain younger much longer than others. It gives more brilliancy to the eye, more fresh- ness to the skin, more support to the muscles; and, as physiology has proved that the depression of the muscles causes wrinkles, those dreaded enemies of beauty; it is also true, taking all on an equal footing, that the ladies who know how to eat are, comparatively, ten years younger than those who are ignorant on the subject. Painters and sculptors are well aware of this truth, for they never paint or chisel a miser or an anchorite without making them appear pale, wrinkled, and miserable. * Coquetry is a bad translation ; we have no equivalent in the English language.DINNER-PARTIES. 145 La gourmandise is one of the great links which keeps society together ; it gradually ex- tends that spirit of conviviality which daily unites various classes, amalgamates them, animates the conversation, and rounds off the sharp corners of conventional inequality. It also makes it incumbent upon the man who asks his friends to dinner, to have a care to their comforts; and the latter feel grateful at finding they have been well taken care of. Eternal shame to those stupid feeders who bolt down with indifference the most delicate morsels, and who gulp first-rate wines without tasting them. Every well-bred man may pay a delicate com- pliment to the host who has done his best to please him. It is not every man that is born a " gourmand." There are individuals to whom nature has de- nied that delicate formation of organs without which they are incapable of appreciating the most savoury morsels. There is another class of men who are bad eaters. Absent-minded, business men, ambitious men, who wish to do two things at once, and think whilst they eat, and who only eat to satisfy their cravings. LHANDBOOK OF DINING. 146 Napoleon I. was one of this class; he was irregular in his meals, and ate hastily and badly ; but he displayed in this matter that same abso- lute will he exercised in everything else. As soon as he felt an appetite he must be satisfied ; and his attendants had strict orders to be ready at any moment to give him chicken, cutlets, or coffee. But there is a privileged class whom a material and organic predestination calls to the enjoyments of taste. I was always a disciple of Lavater and Grail. 1 believe in innate dispositions. As some individuals come into the world evi- dently with bad sight, a distorted walk, or bad ears, so are they blind, lame, and deaf. Why then should not certain individuals be predisposed to experience in a higher degree certain series of sensations. Moreover, with a little observation, you may, at every moment, discover men in so- ciety who bear upon their countenance the marked stamp of some ruling passion. When a face bears this mark it is rarely deceptive. Passions act on the nervous system, and often though a man is silent you may read in his face what is passing in his mind. This tension of the muscles, if habitual, soon leaves sensible traces,147 PHYSIOGNOMY OF GOUKMANDS. and gives a permanent and recognisable character to the countenance. Gourmands by predestination are generally of the middle height: they have round or square faces (carré), sparkling eyes, small forehead, short nose, full lips*, and round chins. The women are dimpled, pretty rather than handsome, with an inclination to embonpoint. Those who are especially addicted to good eating, have finer features, a more refined ap- pearance; they are more mignonnes, and are distinguished by a peculiar manner of their own in swallowing. Under this exterior the most 1 amiable dinner-companions are to be found : they partake of every dish handed to them, eat slowly, and taste with reflection. They are in no hurry to leave the spot where they have been well enter- * Tasso well describes this voluptuous lip : — " Quel labbro, che le rose hau colorito, Molle si sporge e tumidetto in fuore, Spinto per arte, mi cred' io d' amore, A fare ai baci insidioso invito." " That lip, which (like the rose that morn with dew Has largely fed), so moist, so sweetly swells; That lip approaches thus, by Cupid's spells, To tempt to kiss, and still that kiss renew." L 2HANDBOOK OF DINING. 148 tained, and you have them for the rest of the evening, because they are aware what games and amusements are to follow the ordinary accessories of a gastronomic meeting. Those, on the contrary, to whom nature has denied an aptitude for the enjoyments of taste, have long faces, long noses, and long eyes; no matter what their stature, there is something lon- gitudinal about them. They have sleek black hair, and are thin and lanky : it is they who in- vented trowsers. Women, whom nature has similarly afflicted, are angulous, yawn at dinner, and live upon whist and scandal. I do not fear many contradictions to this phy- siological theory, because any man can verify its truth for himself ; I shall, however, support it by two or three examples. I was sitting one day at a large dinner, and had opposite to me a very pretty person, whose whole figure denoted sensuality. I whispered to my neighbour that with such features she must be a gourmande, "What nonsense !" he replied; " she is scarcely fifteen ; that is not yet the age for gourmandise." However, let us watch her. The commencement was not at all favourable149 À GOTJKMANDE. L 3 to me : I began to fear I had compromised myself; during the two first courses the young lady was abstemious to a degree. This discretion astonished me, and I feared I had stumbled upon an excep- tional case, for " nulla régula sine exceptione. " But a magnificent dessert was served up, and this revived my hope. I was not deceived : not only did she eat of everything offered to her, but asked for dishes farthest off from her. She tasted everything; my neighbour was astonished where she could put so much. My diagnostic was veri- fied, and once again science triumphed. Two years afterwards, I met the same person ; she had been recently married; she had grown up into a beautiful woman; slightly coquettish, she displayed all her charms to the best advan- tage. She was ravissante. Her husband was a picture. He looked like that celebrated ventri- loquist, who could laugh on one side of his face, and cry on the other. He appeared much pleased that his wife was so much admired, but as soon as he thought an admirer was too warm in his atten- tions, a cold shiver of jealousy visibly pervaded his frame. The last sentiment prevailed. He hurried off his wife under his arm, and I never saw them again.150 HANDBOOK OF DINING. On another occasion, I made a similar observa- tion on Duke Decrès, for a long time minister of marine. He was short, stout, fair, broad shouldered; his face was nearly round, with rounded chin, full lips, and the mouth of a giant. I at once de- clared him a predestined amateur of good cheer. I whispered my physiognomical observation into the ear of a pretty lady, who, I thought, was dis- creet. Alas ! I was deceived. She was a daughter of Eve, and my secret would have choked her. That very evening his Excellency was informed of the scientific induction I had drawn from the ensemble of his features. I learnt this on the following morning, in a very amiable letter from the duke, modestly de- fending himself against possessing the qualities I had attributed to him, however estimable they might be. I did not regard myself as beaten. I replied that nature never worked without an object ; that she had evidently formed him for certain missions, and that if he was abstemious it was by self-con- straint. I, however, had no right to challenge his word. The correspondence ended here ; but, shortly after, all Paris was informed by the morning151 DUKE DECKÈS papers of the memorable pugilistic encounter be- tween the minister and his cook. The battle was long disputed, and his Excellency had not always the best of it. Now, if after such an adventure, the cook was not dismissed (and he was not), I think I may draw the conclusion that the duke was absolutely dominated by the talents of that artiste, and that he despaired of finding another one who could flatter his taste so agreeably, otherwise he never could have overcome the very natural repugnance he must have felt at having so belli- cose a servant. As I was writing the above lines, on a fine winter's evening, M. Cartier, ex-premier violon of the opera, entered my room, and sat down by the fire.. Being full of my subject, I looked at him with attention. " My dear professor ! " I exclaimed, " how comes it you are not a gourmand ? You possess all the features of one." " I was once," he replied, " but I am obliged to abstain ; " and he gave a deep sigh, almost a groan, worthy of one of Sir Walter Scott's heroes. But if there are gourmands by predestination, there are gourmands by profession. I will point out four great classes : financiers, doctors, literary men, and dévots. L 4.HANDBOOK OF DINING. 152 Financiers are the heroes of good cheer. Hero is the word, for they do battle ; and the aristocracy would have crushed the financiers under the weight of their titles and quarterings, if the latter had not brought into the field against them sump- tuous tables and their strong boxes. Cooks fought genealogists ; and although dukes did not wait till they had left the room to sneer at their Amphi- tryon, nevertheless, they came, and, by their presence, admitted their defeat. Moreover, all those who make large fortunes easily, are almost compelled to become gourmands. Inequality of conditions implies inequality of riches, but inequality of riches does not imply in- equality of wants ; and the man who could afford every day to pay for a dinner that would feed a hundred, is often satisfied himself with the wing of a fowl. Art, therefore, must be had recourse to, to reanimate that shadow of appetite by dishes that encourage it without hurt, and flatter it without stifling it. It was thus that Mondor became a gourmand, and that from all quarters gourmands assembled round him. It is thus that in every cookery-book we are sure to find one or more dishes styled à la finan- cière. And it is a known fact that it was not theDOCTORS. 153 king, but the fermiers-généraux, who formerly ate the first dish of green peas, which always cost 800 francs. Matters have not changed in our times; the tables of our financiers continue to offer the best that nature can produce, hot-houses bring forth, or art accomplish ; and the most noted men of the day do not disdain a seat at their banquets. Causes of another nature, though not less powerful, act upon the medical profession ; they are gourmands by seduction, and they must be men of bronze to resist the temptations offered them. The " dear doctors " are all the better welcome, as health, which is under their care, is the most precious of all goods ; thus they become " spoiled children " in every sense of the word. Always anxiously expected, they are eagerly welcomed ; they are treated like turtle-doves ; they gradually like it; in six months it becomes a habit, and they become gourmands past redemp- tion. One day I hazarded to express this at a dinner- party, I myself figuring as the ninth, Dr. Corvisart in the chair. This was in 1806. 66 You are," I exclaimed, in the inspired tones of a Puritan preacher, " you are the last remnant154 HANDBOOK OF DINING. of a corporation which once covered the whole of France. Alas ! its members are now annihilated or dispersed; no more fermiers-généraux, no more abbes, no more knights, no monks of the white robe ; the whole body of good taste rests now with you. Maintain with dignity so great a responsibility, even should you share the fate of the 300 Spartans at the pass of Thermopylae ! " I said, and there was not one dissentient voice ; we acted accordingly, and the truth remains. I made an observation at this dinner which is worthy of record. Dr. Corvisart, who, when he chose, could make himself most agreeable, drank nothing but iced champagne ; thus, from the very commencement of the dinner, he was noisy, witty, and full of anecdotes, whilst the others were plying knife and fork. At dessert, on the contrary, when conver- sation was just beginning to get lively, he became serious, taciturn, almost morose. From that observation, and others of a similar nature, I have come to this conclusion : " Champagne, which is exhilarating in its first effect (ab initio), is stupifying in its consequences (m recessu), which, moreover, is a noted effect of the acid-carbonic gas which it contains.155 DOCTORS. — THE IK SEVERITY. Before leaving the subject of medical men, I have a crow to pluck with them. I do not wish to die without reproaching them with the extreme severity they sometimes exercise towards their patients. As soon as a poor fellow falls into their clutches, he is at once forbidden everything that is agreeable. I protest against the majority of those interdictions as useless. I say useless, because a sick man never longs for anything likely to hurt him. A clever doctor should never lose sight of the natural tendency of our inclinations, nor forget that if painful sensations are baneful from their very nature, agreeable ones are conducive to health. I have seen a glass of wine, a cup of coffee, or a few drops of liqueur, revive a despond- ing invalid. Moreover, they must be well aware that their severe prescriptions are generally eluded by the sick man ; his friends find plenty of excuses for humouring him, and he dies neither sooner nor later. I give my opinion with the more confidence, as it is supported by numerous facts, and the most flourishing practitioners approve the system. The Chanoine Eollet, who died some fifty yearsHANDBOOK OF DINING. 156 since, was a clergyman of the old school, and a hard drinker, as was customary in his day ; he fell sick, and the first edict of his physician was to prohibit him from tasting wine. Nevertheless, at his next visit the doctor found his patient in bed, and at the side of it a small table covered with a snow-white cloth, a goodly-looking bottle and glass, and a napkin to wipe his lips. At this sight he flew into a great rage, when the unfor- tunate man in a lamentable voice exclaimed; " Ah ! doctor, when you forbade me to taste wine, you did not prohibit the pleasure of beholding the bottle." The physician who attended M. de Montlusin, of Pont-de-Veyle, was still more cruel, for not only did he prohibit the use of wine to his patient, but prescribed him large doses of cold water. As soon as he had left, Madame de Montlusin, eager to obey the doctor's orders and to contri- bute to the restoration of her husband to health, offered him a large tumbler of water pure as crystal. The invalid took it with docility and began to drink it with resignation ; but he stopped short after the first mouthful, and returning the glass to his wife ; " Take it, my dear, (he said), and157 LITERARY GOURMANDS. keep it for another time; I always heard we should not trifle with remedies." In the empire of Gastronomy, the quartier of literary men is close to that of the medical fra- ternity. In the reign of Louis XIV. literary men were drunkards; they followed the fashion, and the memoirs of that day are quite edifying on the subject. Now they are gourmands, it is a step in the right direction. I am far from sharing the opinion of the Cynic Geoffroy, that modern productions are so wanting in force, because the writers drink nothing but eau sucrée. On the contrary, I believe he is doubly wrong, both as regards the fact and the consequence. Men of letters are invited because of the esteem their talents are held in, because their conversa- tion has, generally speaking, something piquant in it, and also because it has latterly become a custom that every dinner should have its " man of letters." These gentlemen generally arrive late, and are all the better received because they are expected ; they are made most of to induce them to come again ; they are given all sorts of delicacies158 HANDBOOK OF DINING. that they may shine, and as they find all this very natural, they get accustomed to it, become, are, and remain gourmands. Matters even went so far as to cause a little scandal. Slanderous tongues have whispered that at certain breakfasts certain littérateurs have been bribed ; that situations have issued forth from cer- tain pâtés, and that the temple of Immortality has been opened with a fork. But they are evil tongues, and I only make this passing allusion to show that I am up in my subject. Finally, many disciples of "gourmandise" are to be found amongst the dévots. All men who enter a profession, endeavour to walk along the path they have chosen, as plea- santly as possible, and this is applicable to the church as well as to any other. The man who sleeps on the hard rock and does penance, is an ex- ception. Now there are some things strictly forbidden, as balls, theatres, gambling, and other amusements ; whilst they are anathematised as well as those who patronise them, good-living steps in quietly with a jolly rubicund clerical countenance. By divine right, man is the king of nature, and all that the earth produces was created for hisTHE CLE EG Y. 159 use. It is for him the quail gets plump and fat, it is for him the Mocca exhales its fine aroma, it is for him that sugar was made favourable to health. Why, then, should the good things offered to us by Providence be neglected, especially if we look upon them as perishable things : more especially, if they awaken our gratitude towards the Creator of all things. No less cogent reasons come to the support of the above. Can we receive too hospitably those who guide us in the right path? Ought we not to invite often, and be kind to those whose object is so praiseworthy? Sometimes the gifts of Comus drop in quite un- sought for ; a souvenir from a college chum, a gift from an old friend, a peace offering from a peni- tent. How refuse to accept such offerings ? It is sheer necessity. Moreover, it has always been so. Monasteries have ever been dépôts of rare delicacies, and this is why many amateurs regret their loss.* * The best liqueurs of France were made at the monastery of the Visitandines; angelica (preserve) was invented at Niort; the sisters of Château-Thierry invented the pains de fleur d'orange; the Ursulines of Belley had a receipt for pickled walnuts, unrivalled.HANDBOOK OF DINING. 160 Many monastic orders, especially that of St. Bernard, were renowned for their good cheer. The cooks of the clergy enlarged the circle of culinary art. When M. de Pressigni, archbishop of Be- sançon, returned from the Conclave which had elected Pius VI., he said the best dinner he had at Eome, was at the table of the head of the Ca- pucins. THE INFLUENCE OF GOOD LIVING ON CONJUGAL HAPPINESS. Finally, the love of good living, when shared, has a marked influence on conjugal happiness. Husband and wife, if both love good cheer, will at all events meet once a day, should they even have separate apartments, and pass a pleasant hour at table : they can discuss not only what they are eating, but what they have eaten, and what they intend to eat; they can talk of new dishes, modern innovations, and interchange that sort of chit-chat which is so charming. Music has doubtless its charms for those who love it ; but it requires attention, and is a labour. Moreover, a man may have a cold, the music- book may be mislaid, the lady have the migraine ; — there is a hitch.A YISIT TO THE MONKS OF ST. BERNARD. 161 A want which is shared, on the contrary, calls a married couple to table, both actuated by the same inclination ; they pay each other those little delicate attentions which betray a wish to oblige; and the manner in which the daily repasts are partaken of has a great influence upon the hap- piness of life. Fielding has ably developed this truth in one of his novels. Honour, then, to gourmandise, such as we pre- sent it to our readers, so long as it does not take away man from his occupations or his duties! The orgies of Sardanapalus do not make us despise all womankind, nor do the excesses of Vitellius make us turn our back upon a well-organised banquet. When it degenerates into gluttony, it loses its name, its charms, and falls into the hands of the moralist, who will censure it, or of the doctor, who will cure it with medicines. A DAT WITH -THE MONKS OF ST. BERNARD. It was in the year 1782. It was about one o'clock A-M. ; it was a beautiful summer night ; a party of young men, myself amongst the num- ber, formed a cavalcade, and after first serenading M162 HANDBOOK OF DINING. the fair ladies in whom we felt an interest, we started on our excursion. We left Belley and took the road towards St. Sulpice, a monastery belonging to the order of St. Bernard, situated on one of the highest moun- tains of the district, at least 5000 feet above the level of the sea. I was at that time the leader of a band of amateur musicians, all jolly fellows, and endowed with all the gifts of youth and health. At a dinner one day, the Abbé of St. Sulpice took me aside into a window recess, and said, " My dear Sir, if you would come with your friends and give us a little music on the fete-day of our saint, it would be to the glory of the saint, it would delight our neighbours, and you would be the first sons of Orpheus who have penetrated into our elevated regions." I did not let him repeat the request, but at once accepted : " Annuit, et totum nutu tremefecit Olympum." We took all our precautions beforehand, and left at the early hour already mentioned, because we had four leagues to travel over roads steep enough to try the boldest traveller. The monastery was built in a valley shut in onA VISIT TO THE MONKS OF ST. BERNARD. 163 M 2 the west side by the summit of the mountain, and on the east by a less elevated cone. The peak on the west side was crowned by a forest of fir-trees, of which 37,000 were blown down by one storm. The valley itself consisted of pasture land and fields hedged in in the English style. We reached the monastery at daybreak, and were received by the bursar, a monk with a massive head and a nose like an obelisk. " Gentlemen," said the worthy father, " you are welcome; it will gladden the heart of our reve- rend abbot when he knows you have arrived : he is still in bed, being much fatigued from exertion yesterday ; but come with me, and you will see that we expected you." He led the way, and we followed him, guessing rightly he was taking us to the refectory. There all our senses were aroused at the sight of a most seductive breakfast, truly classic. In the centre of the large table rose a pasty as large as a church, flanked on one side by a cold quarter of veal, on the south by an enormous ham, on the east by a huge pile of butter, and on the west by a bushel of artichokes à la poivrade. Fruit of every description, plates, napkins, knives, and silver spoons and forks in baskets164 HANDBOOK OF DINING. were spread over the table, and at the end of the hall were a number of lay servants ready to wait upon us, though rather astonished at such an early gathering. In one corner of the refectory more than one hundred bottles were placed under a rippling jet of pure water from the rock, murmuring, as it were, Evo'è Bacche; and if the aroma of Mocca did not greet our nostrils, it was because in those heroic days coffee was not taken so early. The reverend bursar for some time enjoyed our astonishment, and then addressed us in the fol- lowing speech, which, in our wisdom, we settled he had prepared beforehand. " Gentlemen," he said, " I wish I could keep you company ; but I have not yet heard matins, and this is a great day. I might invite you to eat, but your years, your ride, and the mountain air will do that for you. Accept heartily what we heartily offer : I leave you to say my matins." He left us, and we set too with all the vigour of hungry youth. But the efforts of us poor chil- dren of Adam were of no avail against a repast seemingly prepared for the children of Sirius. We left but a small mark of our attack. We were then shown to the dormitory, where I was soonA VISIT TO THE MONKS OF ST. BERNARD. 165 M 3 snug in a good bed, like the hero of Kocroy, de- termined to sleep till the battle trumpet sounded. I was awakened by a robust friar, who nearly pulled my arms out of their sockets, and who in- formed me that Mass was about to be performed. I hastened to the chapel, where I found every one at his post. We executed a symphony, an anthem, and other religious pieces, finishing with a quatuor of wind instruments, and, with all due modesty be it said, I think we managed pretty well. Praises were showered upon us, and, after having received the thanks of the abbot, we sat down to dinner. Dinner was served in the style of the fifteenth century ; few side dishes, few superfluities, but an excellent choice of meat, simple, substantial ra- gouts, all well cooked, and vegetables of a flavour unknown to the lowlands. Abundance seemed the order of the day. At the second course there were no less than fourteen different dishes of roast. The dessert was the more remarkable, as it con- sisted of fruits not to be found at such an eleva- tion ; the valleys at the foot of the mountains had been placed under contribution for the occasion.HANDBOOK OF DINING. 166 Liqueurs were handed round, but the coffee de- serves special mention. It was clear, perfumed, and beautifully hot. It was not served up in those degenerated vases called cups on the banks of the Seine, but in deep bowls, out of which the thick lips of the monks sucked it in with a loud note of satisfaction. After dinner we attended vespers, and between the psalms we performed some sacred music I had composed expressly for the occasion. The day's ceremonials being over, the neigh- bours began to leave ; others played games in the open air. I preferred a stroll, and, with a few others, wandered about inhaling the pure air of these elevated regions, which is so refreshing to the mind, and disposes the imagination to meditation and romance.* It was late when we returned. The worthy Superior came to wish us good-night; "I am going," he said to me, "to my own apartments, and will leave you to yourselves for the rest of the evening ; not because I think my presence would * " I have constantly" (says Savarin) " experienced this effect under similar circumstances, and I am inclined to believe that the lightness of the air in the mountains allow certain cerebral powers to act which its heaviness oppresses in the plains."À VISIT TO THE MONKS OF ST. BERNARD. 167 be a restraint upon my worthy brethren, bnt because I wish them to know they are at perfect liberty. It is not every day St. Bernard. To- morrow we resume our usual daily avocations, f eras iterabimus cequor.' " As soon as the Superior had left, the monks became more lively, and a good deal of good- humoured joking went on. At nine o'clock supper was served, — a careful, delicate repast, three centuries removed from the dinner. We all ate heartily; songs were sung, and one of the worthy fathers spouted some verses of his own composition, which were not bad for a monk. Towards the close of the evening, a voice ex- claimed, ce Father cellarer, where is your dish ? " " All right," replied the venerable monk, " I am not cellarer for nothing! " He left the refectory, and soon after returned, followed by three servants, one bearing plates of excellent buttered toast, and the others with a table and a huge bowl of burning spirits and sugar equivalent to punch, the concoction of which was not then universally known. "We did ample honour to the cellarer. As the clock of the monastery struck midnight, each re- st 4168 HANDBOOK OF DINING. tired to his apartment to enjoy the sweets of slumber, to which the day's labours had given inclination and a claim. The father cellarer mentioned above, having grown old, and being told that a new Superior was coming from Paris, reputed a stern man, "I am easy about it," he said ; " let him be as bad as he can be, he can never have the heart to deprive an old man of his seat in the chimney-corner, or to take the key of the cellar from him." Let it be observed that good cheer is by no means detrimental to health ; and, taking every- thing into equal consideration, your good eater lives the longest. This has been proved statistically in a very able article read at the Academy of Sciences by Dr. Villermet. He has compared the different states of society where men eat well with those where they are badly fed. He has even compared various districts of Paris, and has proved, for instance, a great difference of mortality between the Faubourg St. Marceau and the Chaussée d'Antin. It must not be supposed that a high- feeder never falls ill. But he has more vitality in him, all parts of his system are better nourished, nature has more resources, and the body has in- comparably more power to resist destruction.GOOD CHEEK FAVOUEABLE TO HEALTH. 169 This physiological truth is supported by history, which informs us that every time imperious cir- cumstances, as war, sieges, sudden changes in the seasons, have diminished the means of food, that state of distress has always been accompanied by contagious diseases and a great increase of mor- tality. M. du Belloy, Archbishop of Paris, who. lived nearly a century, had a great appetite ; he loved good cheer ; I have often seen his patriarchal coun- tenance beam at the sight of some favourite dish. On every occasion Napoleon showed him the most marked deference and respect.HANDBOOK OF DINING. 170 CHAP. XI. ÉPROUVETTES GASTRONOMIQUES. Up to the present chapter, these pages, with a few exceptions, have been nothing more than a free translation of Savarin's Physiologie du Goût The recent movement in the "Art of Giving Dinners," taken up by the leading journal and immediately responded to by hundreds of " dinner- givers" (Amphitryons is the classical term) of both sexes, induced us to translate Savarin. As is correctly observed by an elegant writer in the Quarterly Eeview *, " there exists nothing in En- glish at all comparable to it." The same writer observes : " The history of gastronomy is that of manners, if not of morals; and the learned are aware that its literature is both instructive and amusing, for it is replete with curious traits of character and comparative views of society at different periods, as well as with striking anecdotes of remarkable men and women, whose destinies * July, 1835.ÉPROUVETTES GASTRONOMIQUES. 171 have been strangely influenced by their epicurean tastes and habits. Let it, moreover, be remem- bered, that a tone of mock seriousness or careless gaiety does not necessarily imply the absence of sound reflection. The laughing philosopher may prove better worth attention than the solemn pedant." As a man enters a church in a careless mood, and is suddenly struck by some observations from the preacher, and becomes an attentive listener, so will many a man who takes up this book read it through, and put it down with the conviction that convivial intercourse is capable of much higher refinement than is usually given to it. Under the head of ee éprouvettes gastrono- miques" Savarin gives the menu for a dinner suited to various degrees of fortune. By éprouvettes gastronomiques we mean (says Savarin) dishes of such recognised flavour and of such indisputable excellence, that their apparition alone ought, in a well-organised man, to move all his faculties of taste ; so that those who, on such an occasion, evince no spark of desire, no radiance of ecstasy, ought to be justly noted as unworthy of the honours of the sitting and of the pleasures attached thereto.HANDBOOK OF DINING. 172 The system of êprouvettes, duly examined and deliberated in full council, has been inscribed in the "golden book" in a tongue that changes not: — (( Utcumque ferculum, eximii et bene noti saporis, appositum fuerit, fiat autopsia con- vivœ, et nisi fades ejus ae oculi vertantur ad extasim, notetur ut indignus" In other words : — " Whenever a dish of dis- tinguished flavour or renown is served up, scan attentively the countenance of every guest, and note down as unworthy all those whose counte- nances do not beam with delight." The power of êprouvettes is relative, and must be suited to the habits and capacities of every class of society. All circumstances considered, an êprouvette must be calculated to create admiration and surprise. It is a dynamometer, which in- creases as we approach the higher zones of society. Thus, an êprouvette (in other words, a dinner), given by a shopkeeper in the Strand, would not tell upon a clerk in a first-rate concern; whilst upon a select few assembled at the table of a minister or a financier, it would not even be thought of. This gives us a maxim at once : —ÉPROUVETTES GASTRONOMIQUES. 173 "Let your dinner be according to the guests you invite." As the reader progresses through these pages, many other truths will force themselves upon his mind. Let him turn occasionally to the apho- risms in Chapter I. ; for instance, aphorisms xvi. and xvii., on Punctuality ; and xviii., xix., and xx. Gradually we shall arrive at grand conclusions. I. For a fortune of about 2Q0l. a year, Savarin gives the following as a good dinner : — A roast fillet of veal, larded, with gravy. A farmyard turkey, stuffed with chesnuts. Stewed pigeons. A dish of stewed cabbage (Sauerkraut), ornamented with sausages, and crowned by a fine piece of bacon. Œufs à la neige. II. For a fortune of 6001. per annum : — A fillet of beef piqué, roasted, with gravy. A quarter of chevreuil (venison), sauce hachée aux cornichons. A turbot, au naturel. A gigot of mutton*, à la provençale. A dindon truffé. Early green peas. * Pré-salé, equal to our Dartmoor or Welsh mutton.HANDBOOK OF DINING. 174 III. For a fortune of 1200L per annum and up- wards : A carp, à la Chambord. A river pike, stuffed and smothered in a cream of prawns, secundum artem. A capon of seven pounds, crammed with Périgord truffles. A large Strasbourg pâté de foie-gras. Truffled quails on toast, au basilic. A pheasant, à la sainte alliance. 100 asparagus (early), sauce à Vomazbme. A dish of ortolans, à la provençale. A pyramid of meringues, à la vanille and à la rose. The latter is not a bad dinner. It is curious that Savarin makes no mention of soup or dessert in these éprouvettes, probably taking them as a matter of course. Moreover, the dishes enumerated must necessarily vary according to the season of the year. As regards fish, in his day, sea-fish was not so easily to be had in Paris. Kail ways considerably modify his carte. Instead of the pike, for instance, red mullets, or a John à Dory, or soles à la Hol- landaise. In a word, then, variety, and of the best, is another maxim. It also implies a good cook. There is another point worthy of observation : truffles. They are sorely wanting at our English dinner-tables. Very, in Eegent Street, gives aMODERN DINNERS. 175 very good capilotade de faisan aux truffes, for which dish he charges six shillings, and it gives some idea of the great addition truffles are to the table. In Sardinia and Lombardy, truffles are served up alone, fried in butter with cut lemons to squeeze over them. They are delicious. Another, and what has often struck us as a radical evil in English dinners, is that so many dishes are placed upon the table at once. Un- less our dishes are à la Russe, with spirits of wine burning under each, all the entrées are ge- nerally cold when handed to you. Moreover, nothing should be carved at table. The host gets red in the face from exertion, and cannot possibly attend to the lady he has taken down to dinner ; whilst the unfortunate man who has had the ho- nour of taking down the lady of the house is like a culprit going to execution. He has a presenti- ment going downstairs that he will have to carve two fowls smothered in white sauce ; he is seldom deceived, and gets no dinner till the third course. We are here talking of dinners in town, not family dinners. Grod forbid that our good old English custom should ever go out, or the head of the family be found sitting at home with only a table-cloth before him.HANDBOOK OF DINING. 176 Dinners are well given in the higher circles in Germany. Every guest (we are not speaking of public dinners) has a sort of procès verbal of the menu placed by the side of his plate. He knows then how to regulate his appetite. The table has nothing on it but epergnes full of the choicest flowers, and, as many of the ladies carry bouquets, the room is agreeably perfumed. The dishes are handed round by servants, and vanish. Your glass is never left empty by the attentive butler, who softly asks you which wine you prefer. Con- versation is not interrupted. As soon as dessert is over, all rise together, the doors of the drawing- room are thrown open, and excellent coffee and liqueurs handed round. The guest is now a free man ; the lady of the house is probably going to the opera. If you are a favourite, she may inti- mate that she expects you to look in. The men have dined well and lightly, and are not heavy with wine. All is merry as a church-bell. Another maxim : Do not let the men sit so long as is now the custom. Often have we broken through the magic circle of petticoats in the drawing-room, and always been received with pleasure for doing so.ÉPIiOUYETTES GASTRONOMIQUES. 177 To turn from these (if we may so term them) outside observations, let us come again to the more substantial. The letters which have recently appeared in the London journals, from all parts of England, have struck a key-note which will echo for some time to come, They threatened for a moment to throw the Eeform Bill of Mr. Bright into the shade. Another point worthy of observation is this : All ladies like rissoles, whether of lobster or chicken matters not. Curry is too hot for them; they will eat sweet- bread, but rissoles are No. 1. A. They will also partake of oyster-pâtés. It is curious that Savarin does not mention Charlottes-Russes. All ladies like ice, particularly à la vanille, and do not object (though they often refuse it) to a glass of Maraschino after it. We think it a mistake to have game and pudding brought up together. How can a gentle girl eat sweets, when the man next to her is eating a piece of woodcock so high that she nearly faints ? After this little digression, let us return once more to Savarin. For an éprouvette to be certain in producing N178 HANDBOOK OF DINING. the desired effect, it must necessarily be, compa- ratively, on a large scale ; experience, founded on the knowledge of the human species, has taught us that the most rare delicacy loses its influence when not in exuberant proportion ; the first move- ment of pleasure amongst the guests is justly checked by the fear that they will be stingily served, or have to decline out of politeness. We have often witnessed the effect of " éprou- vettes gastronomiques." I will mention one : I was present at a dinner of gourmands of the fourth category (clericals). — My friend J— K— and myself the only profane. After an excellent first course, a huge truffled fowl was brought up, and a Gribraltar-looking monster Strasbourg pâté de foie-gras. This apparition produced a marked effect upon the assembly like the " silent laugh " of Cooper, difficult to describe. Conversation dropped as if by tacit consent from the fulness of the heart; and as each guest's plate was filled, I saw the eagerness of desire, the ecstasy of enjoyment, and, ultimately, the perfect repose of bliss on every countenance.179 THE PLEASURES OF THE TABLE. N 2 CHAP. XII. THE PLEASURES OF THE TABLE, Man is incontestable the most sensitive being that inhabits our globe, the one which undergoes the most suffering. Nature in the first instance condemned him to pain by the nudity of his skin, by the formation of his feet, and by the instinct of war and des- tructiveness which accompanies the human species wherever it has been found. Animals have not this curse upon them ; and with the exception of a few battles on the score of jealousy, suffering, in the state of nature, would be almost unknown to most species ; whilst man who can only experience pleasure in a passing manner, by a restricted number of organs, is al- ways open, in every part of his body, to the risk of excruciating pain. This decree of destiny has been aggravated in its execution by a host of ills emanating from the habits of social life ; so that the most lively and con-HANDBOOK OF DINING. 180 tinuous pleasure we can imagine cannot, either in intensity or duration, compensate us for the atro- cious pain which accompanies certain ills, as gout, tooth-ache, rheumatism, &c. It is this practical fear of pain which makes man, without his being aware of it, throw himself bodily into the opposite camp, and he gives him- self up to the small number of pleasures nature has allotted to him. It is from the same reason that he increases them, draws them out, shapes them, finally, wor- ships them. For many centuries during the reign of idolatry all the secondary divinities represented the pleasures presided over by the superior gods. The severity of the Christian religion has de- stroyed all those patrons. Bacchus, Cupid, Comus, Diana, are nothing more than poetical souvenirs ; but the thing subsists ; and under the most serious of all religions we carouse at marriages, baptisms, and even at funerals. Eepasts, in the sense which we give to the word, commenced with the second era of the human race, that is to say, when it ceased to live upon fruits. The preparation and distribution of food rendered a meeting of the family necessary ; the fathers distributed to their children the pro-THE PLEASURES OF THE TABLE. 181 N 3 duce of their chase, and, in their turn, adult chil- dren rendered the same service to their parents. Those meetings, limited at first to blood rela- tions, extended gradually to friends and neigh- bours. At a later period, as the human race increased in number, the weary traveller would find a seat at those primitive repasts, and relate the sights he had seen in foreign lands. Thus was hospitality born with rights held sacred by every nation ; for no matter how ferocious the race, it held it a sacred duty to respect the life of the man who had eaten its bread and salt. It is during repasts that language must have been improved, because men continually met, and confidence and conversation was the result. Such must have been, from the nature of things, the elements of "the pleasures of the table," which is perfectly distinct, let it be understood, from the " pleasure of eating," which is its neces- sary antecedent. The pleasure of eating is the actual and direct sensation of a want which is satisfied. We share the pleasure of eating in common with all animals ; it simply implies hunger and wherewithal to satisfy it.182 HANDBOOK OF DINING. The pleasures of the table are peculiar to the human race. It premises preparation beforehand for the repast, the locality, and the selection of guests. The pleasure of eating requires, if not hunger, at least, appetite ; the pleasures of the table are, generally, independent of both. Both states may always be observed at our banquets. At the first course men eat eagerly, without speaking or paying attention to what may be said ; and, whatever may be our rank in society, we forget everything to set to work like the others. But when our cravings begin to feel satisfied, reflection steps in, conversation opens, a new order of things commences, and the man who up to this point was only an eater, becomes a more or less agreeable companion, according to the means given him by the master of all things. The pleasures of the table do not consist in transports of delight or ecstasies ; but they gain in duration what they lose in intensity, and have the peculiar privilege of disposing us to all others, or of consoling us for their loss. And, in sooth, after a good dinner, soul and body feel happy and comfortable.THE PLEASURES OF THE TABLE. 1S3 N 4 Physically, whilst the brain is lighter, the countenance brightens, the colour rises, the eyes sparkle, a warm heat runs through our veins. Morally, the intellect is brighter, the imagination warms, and wit and humour follow. Moreover, we often find assembled round the same table, all the modifications which extreme sociability has introduced amongst us. Love, friendship, business, speculation, power, solici- tation, protection, ambition, intrigue ; hence con- viviality concerns everything; hence it produces fruits of every flavour. The immediate consequence of these antece- dents is, that every branch of human industry exerts itself to add to and increase the intensity of the pleasures of the table. The goblet and jugs were ornamented with flowers, and the guests crowned with wreaths * ; banquets were held in the open air, in gardens, surrounded by all the beauties of nature. To the pleasures of the table were added the charms of music and the sound of instruments. At times, dancers and comic actors were intro- * Vide Couture's picture : La décadence Romaine. Boccacio's Decamerone is descriptive of another epoch of this refined epicurism.184 HANDBOOK OF DINING. duced to occupy the eye without interference with the taste ; the most exquisite perfumes exhaled their odour around; a further step was taken, and the most beautiful women were engaged to wait upon the guests. Volumes might be written on this subject, but Greek and Roman authors are at hand to corro- borate what I advance. In the 18th and 19th centuries, we have, more or less, according to circumstances, adopted these various means of gratifying the senses, and we have, moreover, added what new discoveries have revealed to us. However, these accessories are not indispensable to constitute the pleasures of a table. Four con- ditions suffice, viz. : good cheer, good wine, amia- ble companions, and time sufficient. Thus have I often wished for that frugal repast which Horace destined for his neighbour, or to some unexpected guest constrained to find shelter under his roof ; namely, a good fowl, a piece of fat venison, and for dessert, grapes, figs, and nuts. Add to this, wine of the vintage of the Consul Manlius ( nata mecum consule Manlio), and the conversation of that voluptuous poet, and I flatter myself I should have supped well.185 HOW TO GIVE A DINNER. " At mihi cum longum post tempus venerat hospes, Sive operum vacuo, longum conviva per imbrem , Vicinus, benè erat, non piscibus urbe petitis, Sed pallo atque hœdo, turn pensilis uva secundas Et nux ornabat mensas, cum duplice fica." HOW TO GIYE A DINNER. A dinner, no matter how recherché, how sump- tuous, will never go off well if the wine is bad ; the guests not suited to each other, the faces dull, and the dinner eaten hastily. But some impatient reader will exclaim, How can we manage to unite all these conditions which enhance, in a supreme degree, the pleasures of the dinner-table ? I will reply to this question, so listen attentively, gentle reader. It is Grasterea, the prettiest of the muses, who inspires me; I will be clearer than an oracle, and my precepts will live for centuries. Let the number of your guests never exceed twelve, so that the conversation may constantly remain general. Let them be so collected that their occupations are different, their tastes similar, and with such points of contact, that it is not necessary to go through the odious form of introduction. Let your dining-room be brilliantly lighted,186 HANDBOOK OF DINING. your cloth perfectly clean, and the temperature of the room from 13° to 16° Reaumur. Let the men be clever without presumption, the women amiable without conceit. Let your dishes be limited in number, but each excellent, and your wines first-rate. Let the for- mer vary from the most substantial to the most light ; and for the second, from the strongest to the most perfumed. Let everything be served quietly, without hurry or bustle ; dinner being the last business of the day. Let your guests look upon themselves as travellers who have arrived at the end of their journey. Let the coffee be very hot, and the liqueurs first quality. Let your drawing-room be spacious enough to allow a game to be played, if desired, without interfering with those addicted to chatting. Let the guests be retained by the pleasant com- pany, and cheered with the hope that, before the evening is over, there is something good still in store for them. Let the tea not be too strong; the hot toast well buttered ; and the punch carefully mixed.A LUNCHEON. 187 Let no one leave before eleven, but let every one be in bed by midnight. I have said that the pleasures of the table were susceptible of long duration ; I will prove it by a little anecdote, true and circumstantial, of the longest repast I ever made in my life. It is a little bon-bon I slip into the reader's mouth for having read me attentively so far. A family, relations of mine, lived in the Eue du Bac, consisting of a doctor, aged seventy-eight, a captain, seventy-six, and their sister Jeannette, seventy-four. I sometimes paid them a visit, and was always well received. " Parbleu ! " said Dr. Dubois to me one day, rising on his toes to reach my shoulder, " you have long been praising your fondues (eggs beaten up with cheese) to us, making our mouths water ; it is time to put an end to it. We will come and breakfast with you some day, the captain and I, and see what they are like." "Willingly," I replied, " and you shall have one in all its glory, for I shall make it myself. Your proposal has given me great pleasure. I expect you to-morrow at ten — military punctuality."188 HANDBOOK OF DINING. Punctual to the hour came my two old friends, still hale and hearty, clean shaven and combed. They smiled with pleasure when they saw the table laid for three, and at each plate two dozen oysters, with a bright golden lemon. At each end of the table stood a bottle of Sau- terne, carefully wiped, all, except the cork, which indicated its quality in an unmistakable manner. Alas ! these oyster luncheons have gradually fallen off ; they disappeared with the abbés, who always managed a gross, and the chevaliers, who never stopped. I regret them ; but, philosophi- cally, if time modifies governments, what right has it not over simple customs ? After the oysters, which were found fresh, we had some roasted kidneys, some foie-gras aux truffes, and finally the fondue. The elements were collected in a pan, which was placed upon the table over a burner of spirits of wine. I functioned on the field of battle, and my cousins did not lose one of my movements. They were loud in their praises of the prepara- tion, and asked for the recipe. I told them, more- over, two anecdotes, which the reader will find further on.189 A LUNCHEON. After the fondue we had fruit and preserves, a cup of real mocca à la Dubelloy, and two liqueurs, the first a spirit to settle down, the second oil to soften. After breakfast I proposed a little exercise, and offered to show them over my house, which is far from being elegant, but is commodious and com- fortable, the ceilings and gildings dating from the reign of Louis XV. I showed them the original cast of my pretty cousin Madame Eécamier, by Chinard, and her miniature portrait, by Augustin ; they were so charmed that the doctor kissed the portrait, whilst the captain took a similar liberty with the bust, for which I beat him ; for if all the admirers of the original took a similar liberty, it would soon share the fate of the big toe of the statue of St. Peter at Eome, which pilgrims have considerably reduced by kissing. I then showed them casts of some of the best antiques, some pictures, not without their merit, my guns, my musical instruments, and a few rare editions of French and foreign works. I showed them over my kitchen, explained to them my fuel économiser, my roasting oven and turn-spitHANDBOOK OF DINING. 190 with clock, steam valve, all of which they ex- amined most minutely. As we returned to the drawing-room it struck two o'clock. "Peste !" exclaimed the doctor, " it is dinner time, and sister Jeannette is waiting for us. We must go. I am not very hungry, but I should like my soup. It is an old habit, and if I omit it I exclaim, like Titus, diem perdidi!" "My dear doctor," I rejoined, " why go so far for what you have close at hand ? I will send a messenger to your sister to tell her you stop to dinner with me. You must not be over particular, as it will not have the merit of a got up impromptu." After an ocular consultation between the two brothers, the offer was accepted. I sent off a mes- senger to the Faubourg St. Germain, gave some instructions to my chef-de-cuisine, and in a very short time, what with his own resources and restaurateurs in the vicinity, he dished us up a very nice little dinner. It was a great satisfaction to me to behold the sangfroid and aplomb with which my two friends sat down, drew their chairs close to the table, spread their napkins, and prepared for action. They had two "surprises" of which I myself had not thought ; I gave them grated parmesan191 A LUNCHEON. with their soup, and a glass of Madeira sec after it. Both were novelties introduced a short time previously by Prince Talleyrand. Dinner was done ample justice to, and my two guests made themselves most agreeable. After dinner I proposed a game of piquet, but they pre- ferred the far niente, and we drew round the fire. Despite the pleasures of the far niente, I have always entertained the opinion that conversation runs smoother when some little occupation goes on, so I ordered tea. Tea was a novelty for Frenchmen of the old school, but they drank two or three cups with the more relish, as hitherto they had looked upon it as a medicine. A long experience has taught me that complacency follows complacency. Therefore, almost in an imperative tone, I proposed to wind up with a bowl of punch. " But you will kill us ! " shouted the doctor, " You will make us drunk ! " exclaimed the cap- tain. I replied by calling loudly for lemons, sugar, and rum. I mixed the punch; meantime delicate slices of thin toast, well buttered and salted, were under preparation. This time I met opposition ; but as- I knew the attractions of this simple preparation,HANDBOOK OF DINING. 192 I replied that I only hoped they had made enough for us. Shortly afterwards the captain was de- spatching the last slice, and I saw a glance at the empty dish which made me order up some more. Time was getting on, and the clock on my mantelpiece struck eight. u We must go now," said my guests, " and have a bit of salad with our sister, who has not seen us all day." I made no objection, and saw them safely to their carriage. During the whole time they were with me not one of us felt the slightest ennui. The doctor was full of anecdotes, and the captain had spent many years in Italy in the army, and on a mission to the Court of Parma, and so our conversation never lagged. On the morrow I received a note to inform me that far from having suffered from the little excess of the evening before, they had slept like tops, and were quite ready to try me again. HOW TO MAKE A " FONDUE." Take the same number of eggs as of the guests you invite. Take then a piece of good fromage de Gruyère weighing about one third, and a piece of butter one sixth of this weight.193 A CAUDLE LECTURE. Break and beat up your eggs well in a saucepan ; then add your cheese and butter grated. Put your saucepan on the fire and stir it with a wooden spoon until the substance is thick and soft ; put in a little salt, according to the age of the cheese, and a good sprinkling of pepper, which is one of the positive characteristics of this ancient dish ; serve up on a warm dish. Get some of your best wine from the cellar, which pass round briskly, and you will see wonders. LA POULARDE DE BRESSE. (A Caudle Lecture.) These little déjeuners are nice little things, but they sometimes have the effect of upsetting the other arrangements of the day. I have the follow- ing little anecdote from Madame de Franval, who could not keep the secret. It was early in January, 1825, a young married couple, Mme. and M. de Versy, were present at a déjeuner d'huîtres — bien sellé et bridé; we knew what that means. The party was a pleasant one, and ample justice done to the good fare. But when the dinner-hour came, though the young couple sat down to table, it was simply pro forma. Madame took a spoonful of potage, and Monsieur o194 HANDBOOK OF DINING. drank a glass of wine-and-water ; some friend dropped in, a rubber of whist was played, the evening passed over, and the pair retired to rest. About two o'clock in the morning, M. de Versy awoke ; he was uncomfortable ; he yawned, and was so restless that his wife became anxious, and asked him if he was ill. " No, my dear," he said, " but I fancy I am hungry ; and I was thinking of that poularde de Bresse, which looked so tempting, and which we did not touch at dinner." "Well, to tell the truth," replied Madame de Versy, " mon ami, I am every bit as hungry as you, and as you have mentioned the poulet, let us have it." "What folly ! every one in the house is asleep, and we shall be laughed at to-morrow." " If everybody is asleep, then everybody shall get up, and we shall not be laughed at, as nobody will hear about it. Besides, one or both of us may die of hunger before to-morrow, and I for one do not intend to run the risk. I will ring for Justine." So said, so done : the poor lady's maid was roused up, who, having eaten a good supper, slept like a young girl of nineteen without cares. She entered yawning, with heavy eyes, to know what was wanted. But the difficulty was not yet over. It was195 A CAUDLE LECTURE. O 2 necessary to rouse the cook : the latter grumbled, growled, and was recalcitrant. However, she at last got up. Meantime Madame de Versy had put on a dressiûg-gown and her husband made himself as comfortable as he could, whilst Justine had spread a napkin on the bed and brought the indispensable accessories to this improvisé repast. Everything thus prepared, the poularde was brought in, cut up and demolished without mercy. After this first exploit, the young couple ate a large pear between them, and some confiture d'orange. In the entr'actes they had nearly finished a bottle of vin-de-Grave, and had exclaimed more than once that they never enjoyed a repast so much. The repast, like everything else in this world, terminated at last. Justine took away the frag- ments, and the conjugal curtains were drawn. On the morrow, Madame de Versy told the whole story to her bosom friend, Madame de Franval ; and it is to the indiscretion of the latter lady that the public is indebted for this little anecdote. She never omitted to state, when she came to the end of her story, that Madame de Versy coughed twice, and positively blushed.HANDBOOK OF DINING. 196 A PERSONAL ADVENTURE. Savarin loved a good dinner. The smell of a roast pheasant or turkey acted upon him like the sound of the bugle on the war-horse, or the " full cry" on the hunter in the field. Though on a mission in which his head was at stake, he could not resist the temptation of stopping on the road to enjoy the good things which Providence threw in his way. He thus relates his adventure : ■— Mounted on my good nag " La Joie " one day, I was riding through the laughing hills of the Jura. It was in the worst days of the Kevolution ; I was on my way to Dole, to see the representa- tive Prôt, to obtain a " safe conduct," which might prevent me from being sent to prison, and from thence, probably, to the scaffold. At about eleven o'clock in the morning, I stopped at a small inn in the little village of Montsous-Vaudrey. I first saw that my nag had a good feed, and then made my way into the kitchen, when I was struck by a sight which would delight any traveller. A spit was turning before a glowing fire, ad- mirably furnished with quails — king-quails—fatÀ PERSONAL ADVENTURE. O 3 and plump ; the gravy from them was dropping on a fine piece of toast, which showed a knowing- hand, whilst close by a leveret, already roasted, was keeping hot, the perfume of which tickled my nostrils " Grood ! " I inwardly ejaculated ; 64 Providence has not yet forsaken me. Let us cull this flower on the road ; there is always time to die.5' Turning to the host, who, during this examina- tion, was whistling, with his hands behind his back, walking up and down his kitchen with the strides of a giant, " My good man," I said, " what can you give me good for dinner ?" " Nothing but good, Sir ; good boiled beef, good potato soup, a good shoulder of mutton, and good beans." At this unexpected reply, a shiver of disap- pointment ran through my frame; I never eat boiled beef (bouilli) of which soup has been made, it is the meat without its juice; potatoes and beans tend to promote corpulency; the mutton did not tickle my fancy. The host kept throwing side glances at me, as if he guessed the cause of my abject looks. " And for whom do you reserve all this game ? " I said, in an annoyed tone of voice. " Alas ! Sir," he said, with a voice of commiseration, "I cannot198 HANDBOOK, OF DINING. dispose of it ; it belongs to some gentlemen of the law, who have been down here for the last ten days to make an estimate for a rich lady in the neighbourhood. They finished their work yester- day, and are going to have a jollification to-day." " Sir," I said, after a few moments' deliberation, " take my compliments to those gentlemen, and say that a gentleman solicits as a favour to be admitted to share their dinner, and will willingly pay his part of the expenses, and that he will feel deeply obliged to them." My host went on the errand. But shortly afterwards, a fat, jolly-looking little man entered the kitchen, displaced two or three things, took the cover off one of the stew-pans, and went out again. " Grood ! " said I to myself,te he has been sent to have a look at me." And hope rose within me, for experience had already taught me that my exterior was not repulsive. My heart beat, nevertheless, as loud as that of a candidate when the votes are being counted, when the host returned and said, " the gentlemen were much flattered at my proposal, and only awaited me to sit down to dinner." I left with a spring, received the most hearty199 A PERSONAL ADVENTURE. o 4 welcome, and in a few minutes we were quite at home. What a good dinner ! ! ! I will not enter into details, but I must make honourable mention of a fricassée de poulet aux truffes, only to be had "en province" so good, that it would have brought Tithonus to life again. Of the roast I have al- ready spoken; it was done to a turn, and the obstacles I had to overcome to partake of it heightened its flavour. The dessert consisted of a crème à la vanille, cheese, and various sorts of fruits. We washed all these down, first, with a light wine, subse- quently with Hermitage, afterwards with a soft and generous wine of a straw-colour. Excellent coffee and liqueurs of Verdun crowned the repast. Not only was the dinner good, but we were very merry. After speaking cautiously of the events of the day, all sorts of anecdotes went the round. Songs were sung, and I volunteered the fol- lowing impromptu on the occasion : Air.—Du maréchal-fer rant. " Qu'il est doux pour les voyageurs De trouver d'aimables buveurs ! C'est une vraie béatitude. Entouré d'aussi bons enfans,200 HANDBOOK OF DINING. Ma foi ! je passerai céans, Libre de toute inquiétude, Quatre jours, Quinze jours, Trente jours, Une année. Et bénirais ma destinée." We had been four hours at table ; a walk was proposed, and I was politely asked to join and re- turn to supper. It was, however, time for me to be off. The sun, already sinking in the West, warned me that I had not much time to spare. They would not allow me to pay my share in the dinner, and all came to see me mount. We shook hands all round, and parted the best friends in the world. On reaching M. Prôt's residence, I found that I had been informed against, and he received me with sinister looks. I do not believe he was a man cruel by nature; but he had little intellect, and did not know how to wield the fearful power placed in his hands; he was like a child armed with the club of Hercules. I was better received by Madame Prôt, having brought a letter from a friend. By good luck, the conversation turned upon music. As soon as she found I was an amateur she was delighted. ITHE CURE'S OMELETTE. 201 spent the evening with them. I sang, she sang, we sang. I knew all her favourite airs. On leaving, Madame Prôt put out her hand, and said, " Citoyen, a man who like you cultivates the fine arts is incapable of betraying his country ; I know you came here to ask a favour from my husband: it shall be granted, I promise you." I kissed her hand respectfully, and on the mor- row I received my " safe-conduct," duly signed and magnificently sealed. The object of my journey was thus accom- plished; I returned home in good spirits; and, thanks to Harmony, that amiable daughter of Heaven, my ascension was postponed for a good number of years. THE CURÉ'S OMELETTE. Every one knows that for twenty years Madame E * occupied unchallenged the throne of beauty at Paris. It is also known that she was as chari- table as she was beautiful, and that she took a great interest in every work of benevolence. Wishing to consult the Curé of , respect- ing some charity, she went to his house at five in * Madame Récamier, Savarin's cousin.202 HANDBOOK OF DINING. the afternoon, and was astounded to find him already at table. Madame R was about to retire, but the curé requested her to stay, as it would by no means interfere with his repast. The table was laid with a neat white cloth ; some good old wine sparkled in a decanter of crystal ; the white por- celain was of the best quality ; the plates had heaters of boiling water under them, and a neatly dressed servant-maid was in attendance. The repast was limitrophe between frugality and luxury. A crawfish soup had just been re- moved, and there was on the table a salmon-trout, an omelette, and a salad. "My dinner will tell you," said the worthy curé with a smile, " that it is fast-day, according to the regulations of our Church." Our fair friend bowed ; though a private note tells me the colour somewhat came to her cheek, which, however, did not prevent the curé from eating. The execution commenced by the trout, the sauce of which betrayed a skilful hand, and the countenance of the curé denoted satisfaction. After this first dish he attacked the omelette, which was round, pretty thick, and cooked to a point.203 THE CURÉ'S OMELETTE. At the first incision of the spoon, a thick rich juice issued forth, pleasant to the eye as well as to the smell ; the dish seemed full of it, and Madame E owns it made her mouth water. This sympathetic movement did not escape the curé, accustomed to watch the passions of man, and as if answering a question which Madame E never put, "It is an omelette au thon" (tunny omelette) he said, " and few people taste it without lavishing praises upon it." " I am not surprised at it," rejoined the fair denizen of the Chausée-d'Antin, " I have never seen so enticing an omelette on our worldly tables." The salad followed. [" I take this opportunity," says Savarin, "of recommending salad to every one'* who places confidence in me ; salad refreshens without weakening, and comforts without irritat- ing ; I usually say it regenerates."] The dinner did not prevent conversation, and the matter in hand was duly discussed. Other topics were mooted. Dessert, consisting of three apples, a cheese, and a pot of preserves, followed, after which the maid brought up a cup of hot coffee. After having sipped his coffee, the curé said grace. " I never," he said, " take spirits ; I always offer liqueurs to my guests, but reserve the use of204 HANDBOOK OF DINING. them for my old age, should it please Providence to let me live so long." The clock struck six, and Madame E , who had a dinner-party that day, had to hasten to her carriage to be in time to receive her guests, of which I was one. She, " as usual," arrived late, but did arrive at last, quite full of all she had seen and smelt. The cure's dinner, but especially the omelette, monopolised the whole conversation during dinner. Madame R discussed its size, appearance, and odour ; and as all the data were from personal observation, it was agreed it must have been a first-rate ome- lette. Each guest ate it in imagination. The matter finally dropped, and the conversa- tion turned to other subjects. I, however, the propagator of useful truths, feel it a duty to with- draw from obscurity a preparation which I believe to be as wholesome as it is agreeable. I gave in- structions to my chef to get the recipe with the most minute particulars ; and I give it the more readily to amateurs, as I do not believe it is to be found in any cookery-book. HOW TO MAKE AN " OMELETTE AU THON." Take, for six persons, the roes of two carp ; bleach them by putting them for five minutes in boiling water slightly salt.HOW TO MAKE AN "OMELETTE AU THON." 205 Take a piece of fresh tunny, about the size of a hen's egg, to which add a small eschalot already chopped. Hash up together the roe and the tunny so as to mix them well, and throw the whole into a saucepan, with a sufficient piece of very good butter ; whip it up till the butter is melted. This constitutes the speciality of the omelette. Take a second piece of butter, à discrétion, mix it with parsley and chives, place it in a long- shaped dish destined to receive the omelette, squeeze the juice of a lemon over it, and place it on hot embers. Beat up twelve eggs (the fresher the better), throw in the sauté of roe and tunny, stirring it so as to mix all well together. Then make your omelette in the usual manner, endeavouring to turn it out long, thick, and soft. Spread it carefully on the dish prepared for it, and serve up at once. This dish ought to be reserved for recherché déjeuners, or for assemblies where amateurs meet who know how to eat well ; washed down with a good old wine, it will work wonders. Note. The roe and the tunny must be beaten up (sauté) without allowing them to boil, to pre-HANDBOOK OF DINING. 206 vent their hardening, which would prevent them mixing well with the eggs. Your dish ought to be hollow towards the centre, to allow the gravy to concentrate, that it may be helped with a spoon. The dish ought to be slightly heated, otherwise the cold china would extract all the heat from the omelette. EGGS FRIED IN GRAVY. I was travelling one day with two ladies to Melun. We left rather late in the forenoon, and reached Montgeron with a famous appetite. We put up at a very decent-looking inn, but, to our disappointment, were informed three diligences and two post-chaises had passed, and the tra- vellers had eaten up everything, like locusts from Egypt. We had, however, looked into the kitchen, and saw a very nice-looking gigot of mutton turning on the spit, towards which the ladies cast hungry eyes. It belonged to three travellers in the coffee-room. With a half-angry, half-supplicating voice, I asked whether we could not have some eggs fried in the gravy ; with a cup of coffee it would suffice.A DINNER AT NEW-YORK. 207 " Oh ! certainly." The cook broke*- the eggs into the dripping-pan. As soon as he turned his back, I maliciously drew my travelling-knife, and made two or three incisions in the roast to allow the juice to flow more freely. I then watched my eggs, and, when they were done, took them to my party. They were found excellent, and we cer- tainly had the best part of the mutton. A DINNER AT NEW-YORK* During my sojourn at New-York (says Savarin), I sometimes used to spend my evenings at a coffee- house and tavern, kept by one Little, who gave turtle-soup in the morning, and in the evening the refreshments customary in the United States. I was generally accompanied by Viscount de la Massue and Jean Eodolphe Fehr, formerly a broker at Marseilles, both émigrés like myself. We used to have a Welsh-rarebit *, and a glass of ale or cider, and talk of the misfortunes of our country, of our pleasures, and our hopes. Here I made the acquaintance of a Mr. Wil- kinson, a Jamaica planter, and of a person who * Savarin naively enough calls this a lapin gallois.HANDBOOK OF DINING. 208 always accompanied him, but whose name I never learnt. He was one of the most extraordinary- looking men I ever met in my life. He had a massive square head, bright eyes, and appeared to examine everything with great attention ; but he never spoke, and his features were as rigid as those of a blind man. Only, when anything funny or amusing was said, he would open his mouth as wide as a trap-door, his face would lengthen, and he would give a loud hoarse laugh ; as soon as he shut his trap-door, his features became rigid again. It was like a flash of lightning through a dark cloud. As regards Mr. Wilkinson, who appeared about fifty years of age, he had all the manners and appearance of a perfect gentleman. These two Englishmen seemed to take pleasure in our society, and had more than once shared the frugal repast I sometimes offered to my friends. One evening Mr. Wilkinson took me aside, and said he hoped I and my two friends would do him the pleasure of dining with him. I accepted for myself and friends, and the dinner was to be on the day after the morrow. The evening passed as usual, but as I was leaving, the waiter took me aside and told me that the "Jamaica gentlemen" had ordered a good209 A DINNER AT NEW-YORK. dinner, but had given particular orders about the wines, because they looked upon their invitation as a challenge who could drink most, and that the man with the large mouth had said that he hoped he alone could drink the Frenchmen under the table. This information would have induced me at once to send an excuse, if I could honourably have done so, for I hate such orgies, but it was out of the question. The Englishmen would have pro- claimed everywhere that we shirked, and that their presence alone sufficed to appal us; and therefore, though prewarned, we followed the maxim of Marshal Saxe : the wine was drawn, and we resolved to drink it. I was not without some anxiety ; but not on my own account. I knew that being younger, bigger, and more vigorous than our Amphitryons, my con- stitution, uninjured by bacchanalian excesses, was a match for the two Englishmen; but, though I might have come off victorious, that victory would have been greatly lessened by the defeat of my two companions. Consequently, I held a sort of council of war with Fehre and Massue. I recom- mended them to drink as little as possible, above all things, to eat slowly, and to preserve a little p210 HANDBOOK OF DINING. appetite throughout, because food mixed with drink moderates the effect, and prevents its rushing to the head so strongly. Finally, we ate between us a plate of bitter almonds, which I believe have the peculiarity of obviating to a certain extent the effects of intoxicating liquors. Thus armed, physically and morally, we pro- ceeded to Little's, where we found the Jamaicans ready to receive us. Dinner was served up at once. It consisted of a huge roast of beef, boiled vegetables, a roast turkey, salad, and a fruit tart. The beverage was excellent claret. Mr. Wilkinson did the honours well, encouraging us to eat, and setting us the example ; his friend seemed lost in the bottom of his plate, did not say a word, but there was a sly smile on the corner of his lips. I felt proud of my two companions. La Massue, who was gifted with a great appetite, ate like a petite maîtresse, and Fehre emptied his glass once or twice into a beer-jug near him. For my part, I drank glass for glass with the Englishmen, and as the dinner progressed I felt my confidence increase. After the claret we had Port, then Madeira, which was passed round briskly. The dessert consisted of fresh butter, cheese,211 A DINNER AT NEW-YORK. P 2 cocoa, and hickory nuts. Toasts were proposed. We drank the health of kings, the liberty of na- tions, the beauty of women. Mr. "Wilkinson pro- posed the health of his daughter, which we drank in bumpers. After the wine, spirits were brought in ; that is to say, rum, brandy, and gin. We now sang songs : I saw it was getting hot. I feared the spirits ; I avoided taking any by asking for punch. Little himself brought in a mighty bowl, evidently brewed beforehand, which would have sufficed for forty persons. I have never seen a bowl of such dimensions in France. This gave me new courage ; I ate five or six slices of well-buttered toast, and felt my head quite clear. I now cast a scrutinising glance around me, for I began to feel anxious how it would terminate. My two friends appeared steady enough, were sipping their punch and eating hickory nuts. Mr. Wilkinson's face was a purple- red, and his eyes unsteady,—he seemed to have had enough ; his friend was silent, as usual, but his head fumed like a boiler. I saw the crisis was coming. Mr. Wilkinson suddenly roused himself, and in a sonorous tone struck up "Rule, Britannia ;" but212 HANDBOOK OF DINING* before he had got through the first verse, he lost his balance, reeled off his chair, and slipped under the table. His friend gave one of his deep laughs, and stooped to help him, fell over, and could not get up again. My mind was greatly relieved at this brusque dénouement I pulled the bell ; Little came up himself, and I gave the usual phrase, " See that these gentlemen are properly taken care of." We had a glass of punch with Little to their health. The waiters came in, and seizing upon the van- quished, carried them off, feet foremost ; Wilkinson still endeavouring to sing " Eule, Britannia ; " his friend, as usual, silent. The New York papers got wind of the affair, and it went the round of all the papers of the Union. Hearing that Mr. Wilkinson was laid up from the effects of the dinner, I went to see him, which seemed to give him great pleasure. He was suffering from a severe attack of gout, and, shak- ing me by the hand when I left, said : — *' My dear Sir, you are very good company, but too hard a drinker for us."P 3 ft CLASSICAL GOURMANDISE. 213 CLASSICAL GOURMANDISE. Under the title of " History of M. de Borose," Savarin gives some valuable hints on the " Art of Eating." As a dinner-giver, M. de Borose ac- quired a reputation at Paris ; of independent for- tune and good position in society, he made it an object to make his dinners as perfect as possible. This became so well known, that when a butcher or victualler had a choice piece of meat or game, he would prefer letting M. de Borose have it at a fair price to selling it at a high price anywhere else, simply because he knew its merits would be discussed by competent judges, and his shop be sought after. With Epicurus, M. de Borose said : — "Is man to disdain the gifts of nature? Is he placed on earth to cull only bitter fruits ? For whom are the flowers the gods ordain to grow beneath the feet of mortals ? It is pleasing to Providence that we should give way to the incli- nations it suggests to us ; our duties emanate from its laws ; our desires from its inspirations." A little time, reflection, and experience soon taught M. de Borose that, the number of dishes being almost limited by custom, a good dinnerHANDBOOK OF DINING. 214 I ought not to cost much more than a bad one; that it does not cost 201. a year more whether you give good or bad wine ; and that everything de- pends on the will of the master, the order he keeps in his household, and the authority he exercises over his servants. Starting from these fundamental points, Borose's dinners acquired a classical reputation; men took pains to get invited, and some talked about them who had never been there. He never asked a soi- disant gastronome who was a glutton and who ate wholesale. He invited men of intellect and taste, who knew what was good, and never forgot the maxim which reason says to appetite : " non procèdes ampUus" His dinner-parties seldom exceeded nine, and the dishes were not very numerous ; but his care and exquisite taste made them perfect. At all seasons of the year his table presented the best that was to be had, and you were waited upon with such attention that it left nothing to be desired. The conversation during dinner was always general, amusing, often instructive ; this latter quality was due to a very peculiar precaution of Borose. Once a week a learned friend of his, to whom he gave a salary, used to give him subjects215 CLASSICAL GOURMANDISE. fit for discussion at table. De Borose used cleverly to turn the conversation to the subject. Twice a week he invited ladies, and always took care that each lady had a cavalier into whose charge he placed her. This precaution greatly enhanced the pleasure of the evening, because even the severest prude feels humiliated if no notice is taken of her. Music and écarté whiled away the evening. On the first Monday of every month, De Borose made a point of asking his parish clergyman. On that day the conversation assumed a tone a little more serious, but did not exclude innocent gaiety. The worthy pastor has been heard to say, that he wished there were four first Mondays in every month. Borose was very particular as to whom he dealt with. He insisted upon a first-rate article, and a moderate price. He would lend money to his providers, if times were bad, as long as he found they were honest, and served him well. He made the fortune of his wine-merchant, by proclaiming him a man who did not adulterate his wines, a quality already rare at Athens in the days of Pericles, and scarcely to be found at the present day. He did not allow anything at his table to be p 4 )HANDBOOK OF DINING. 216 wasted or taken as perquisites by his servants, whom he paid liberally. He gave away his broken meat in charity. The above few lines contain within them nearly the whole art of giving dinners.DIGESTION. CHAP. XIII. The following chapter scarcely comes under the head of " The Art of Eating ;" yet it is intimately connected with it. Savarin was no mean profi- cient in the medical science, and had made him- self master of the structure of the human frame. He had studied it theoretically and practically. The conclusions he came to on various points more nearly affecting the health of man, are most valuable, and will be read with interest even by the ce Faculty." Sufficient will have already tran- spired in the preceding chapters to prove to the reader that Savarin was a man of superior mind, of deep thought, and, moreover, highly practical in his deductions. Many a valuable hint may be taken, by both sexes, from the few following pages. ON DIGESTION. " We do not live (says an old adage) upon what ive eat, but upon what we digest." To live,HANDBOOK OP DINING. 218 therefore, we must digest, and this rule is appli- cable to the rich as to the poor, to the peasant as to the king. But how few men are acquainted with the func- tions of digestion. Thoroughly to understand them, they ought to be studied in their antecedents and in their consequences. We shall not follow M. Savarin in his scientific description of those organs of the human frame more intimately connected with the digestive functions and of those functions themselves, but come to his conclusions. Digestion is of all the functions of our body that one which has the most influence on the morale of the individual.' The principles of the most simple psychology teach us that the mind is acted upon by the organs which are subject to it, and which place it in contact with external objects ; hence it comes, that when those organs are out of order, badly restored, or irritated, that state of degradation exercises a necessary influence on the sensations which are the intermediary and occasional means of intellectual operations. Thus, without our being aware of it, and, what is more, without our being able to prevent it,219 REPOSE. accordingly as we digest are we sad, gay, taciturn, lively, morose, or melancholy. Young persons will sometimes shiver after din- ner, and elderly persons feéT inclined to go to sleep. In the first instance, it is nature which with- draws the caloric from the surface to employ it in its laboratory ; in the second, it is the same power which, already enfeebled by age, cannot suffice at the same time for the work of digestion and the keeping up of the sensations. In the first moments of digestion, it is bad, even dangerous, to do mental work or commit any excess. This is applicable to youth, as well as to middle and old age. Some people are in- variably in a bad temper whilst digestion is going on ; if men in power, this is not the time to pro- pose a plan, or ask a favour from them. ON REPOSE. Man is not meant to enjoy indefinite activity ; nature has only destined him to an interrupted existence ; his perceptions finish after a given time. The period of activity may be lengthened by varying the form and nature of the sensations he experiences ; but that continuity of existence220 HANDBOOK OF DINING leads him to desire repose. Kepose leads to sleep, and sleep brings dreams. Shelley's beautiful lines will rise before the reader : — t" How wonderful is Death, Death and his brother Sleep ! One, pale as yonder waning moon, With lips of lurid blue ; The other, rosy as the morn When throned on Ocean's wave, It blushes o'er the world : Yet both so passing wonderful ! " But to return to Savarin. We have now reached the last limits of huma- nity. For the man who sleeps is no longer a social being ; the law still protects him, but com- mands him no longer. The general laws imposed upon the globe which we inhabit have necessarily influenced the mode of life of the human species. The change of day and night which is felt upon the whole earth with certain varieties, but still sufficiently to com- pensate each other, has naturally enough indi- cated the time for activity and for rest ; and, pro- bably, the use of our life would not have been the same if we had been given day without end. However this may be, when a man has for a certain length of time enjoyed the fulness of life,SLEEP. 221 he begins to feel weary ; his impressions become less vivid ; in vain he strives to keep his senses alive; the organs refuse compliance; the soul is saturated with sensation ; the hour of rest is at hand. The reader will observe that we are here con- sidering social man surrounded by all the re- sources of comfort and high civilisation, for the want of sleep comes much quicker and much more regularly to the man who undergoes assiduous labour, or to men who have made a long journey, been on the battle-field, at the chase, or who have gone through any other great exertion. And Nature, that excellent mother, has endowed sleep, like her other gifts, with great pleasure. The man who reposes experiences an inexpres- sible feeling of happiness ; his arms fall from their own weight, his muscles relax, his brain feels light, his senses are calm, his sensations deadened ; he desires nothing, he does not think ; a veil of gauze is drawn over his sight. A few moments more, —he sleeps. There are some men so organised that it may almost be said they do not sleep at all, yet the general truth is that the want of sleep is as im- perious as hunger or thirst. The outposts of anHANDBOOK OF DINING. 222 army often fall asleep, even though they throw snuff into their eyes. Pichegru, when tracked by the police of Bonaparte, gave 30,000 francs for a night's sleep, and that very night he was betrayed and given up. Like all other pleasures, sleep may be carried to an extreme. Men have been known to have slept away three quarters of their life ; the effects in such case are baneful : — idleness, indolence, weakness, stupidity, and death. The school of Salerno allowed seven hours' sleep to all ages and sexes. That doctrine is too severe ; children and women require more ; but more than ten hours in bed is always an excess. And what does the mind do during this lapse ? It lives in itself ; it is like a pilot in a calm, as a mirror in the night, a lute, the strings of which vibrate not to a touch ; it awaits fresh excitement. There are, however, some psychologists, amongst others Count de Eedern, who maintain that the mind never ceases to act, and the latter supports his opinion on the ground that every man aroused from his first sleep experiences the sensation of one disturbed in some serious occupation. There is some truth in the observation, which is worth investigation.THE INFLUENCE pF DIET. 223 THE INFLUENCE OF DIET ON BEST, SLEEP, AND DREAMS. Whether a man rests, sleeps, or dreams, he does not cease to be under the power of the laws of nutrition, and does not leave the limits of the empire of Gastronomy. Theory and experience agree to prove that the quality and the quantity of food exercise a power- ful influence upon labour, repose, sleep, and dreams. An ill-fed man cannot support the fatigue of prolonged labour ; he perspires ; his strength leaves him; and, for him, repose is simply the impos- sibility of action. If it is a mental labour, the ideas are weak and vacillating; reflection refuses its aid, and judgment fails; the brain wearies itself in vain efforts, and the writer dozes off. On the other hand, the man who lives well, and is careful of himself, will do an amount of labour scarcely credible. Diet has no less influence on sleep and dreams. A hungry man cannot sleep; the pains in his stomach keep him in a painful state of sleep- lessness. On the other hand, the man who has224 HANDBOOK OF DINING. eaten too much, falls at once into a heavy sleep ; if he dreams, he has no recollection of what he dreamt about. He awakes suddenly, and it is some time before he is again restored to social life ; and when the heaviness of sleep has quite left him, he still suffers, for a long time, from want of digestion. As a general maxim, it may be said that coffee drives away sleep. Custom obviates the effect; but it infallibly has this effect upon all Europeans who are not accustomed to it. Some articles of food, on the contrary, promote sleep, namely, all those where milk predominates, chicken, orange- flower, and especially a rennet apple, if eaten just before bed-time. Experience, supported by a thousand facts, shows that diet determines dreams. Generally speaking, all articles of food of an exciting nature cause dreams, more especially pigeons, ducks, game, and especially hare. The same may be said of asparagus, celery, truffles, perfumed sweets, and especially vanille. It would be a great error to suppose that all these things ought to be banished from the table; for the dreams they occasion are generally speak- ing agreeable, and prolong our existence, even225 DREAMS. during our sleep. There are persons for whom sleep is a sort of separate existence, a sort of pro- longed romance ; that is to say, their dreams are continued from night to night, and they recognise old faces, which, however, they never meet in the real world. The man who reflects upon his physical ex- istence, and regulates it according to the principles which we develope, that man will carefully pre- pare his repose, his sleep, and his dreams. He will divide his labour so as not to overwork him- self ; he will make it lighter by variety, and re- freshen himself by short intervals of rest which relieve him without interrupting his train of thoughts. If sometimes he should find a longer rest than usual necessary, let him take it in a sitting posture ; let him rest without sleeping, un- less quite overcome, and let him especially avoid acquiring the habit of it. When he retires to bed at the usual hour, let his bedroom be airy, let him not draw the bed- curtains close, which would make him breathe continually the same air; and let him not close his shutters completely, so that whenever his eye opens it may be comforted by a ray of light. Let his pillows be slightly raised; his pillow Q226 HANDBOOK OF DINING. ought to be of horse-hair, his nightcap of linen ; his chest not oppressed with bed-clothes, but let his feet be warmly covered. He has eaten well, but not too much ; he has drunk the best wines, abstemiously, even of the very best. At dessert he has talked of gallantry more than of politics; he has taken a cup of coffee, and perhaps a glass of liqueur after it. He has been an amiable companion, and has after- wards spent a pleasant evening where music has prevailed. He retires to rest satisfied with him- self and others, his eyes close, and he falls into deep calm sleep. Nature is soon relieved. Plea- sant dreams hover round him and impart a mys- terious existence; he sees the persons he loves, finds his favourite occupations, and rambles amongst his favourite haunts. Finally, sleep leaves his eyelids, and he returns to society without regretting the time lost, be- cause, even in his sleep, he has enjoyed activity without fatigue, pleasure without alloy. OBESITY OK EMBONPOINT. The primary cause of embonpoint is the na- tural disposition of the individual. Most men are born with certain predispositions which areOEESITY. 227 Q 2 stamped upon their features. Out of one hundred persons who die of consumption, ninety have brown hair, a long face, and a sharp nose. Out of one hundred fat ones, ninety have short faces, round eyes, and a short nose. Consequently there are persons whose destiny it is to be fat. This physical truth has often given me annoyance. I have at times met in society some dear little creature with rounded arms, dimpled cheeks and hands, and pert little nose, fresh and blooming, the admiration of every one, when, taught by experience, I cast a rapid mental glance through the next ten years of her life, and I behold those charms in another light, and I sigh internally. This anticipated compassion is a painful feeling, and gives one more proof that man would be very unhappy if he could foresee the future. The second and chief cause of obesity is to be found in the mealy or floury substance of which man makes his food. All animals that live on farinaceous food grow fat ; man follows the com- mon law. Mixed with sugar the fattening quali- ties increase. Beer is very fattening. Too much sleep and little exercise will promote corpulency.HANDBOOK OF DINING. 228 Another cause of obesity is in eating and drinking too much. M. Louis Grreffulhe called upon me one day and said that having heard I was writing a trea- tise on obesity, and he was very much inclined to be corpulent, he should feel obliged to me for advice. " My dear Sir," I said, " not having taken out a regular diploma, I might refuse to advise you, but if you will give me your word of honour to follow for one month the instructions I give you, I will tell you what to do." He promised to do so. I gave him my in- structions, requesting him to have himself weighed at once, and again at the expiration of the month. When the month was out, M. Grreffulhe came to see me, and spoke to the following intent :— " Sir, I have followed your instructions to the letter, as if my life depended upon it, and during the month I have lost more than three pounds of flesh. But, to obtain that result, I have been obliged forcibly to gainsay all my tastes, all my customs,—in a word, I have suffered so much, that whilst I give you my best thanks for your good advice, I now renounce all benefit I might deriveOBESITY.—ITS PREVENTION. 229 Q 3 from following it, and shall allow Providence to deal with me as it thinks fit." It grieved me to hear this, for I feared the re- sult ; M. Greffulhe grew more and more corpulent, and, before he reached his fortieth year, died of suffocation. To cure embonpoint (obesity, corpulency) you must commence by these three precepts of absolute theory,—discretion in eating ; moderation in sleep; exercise on horseback or on foot. These are the first resources that science offers us ; but I count little upon them, because I have a knowledge of men and things, and know that if a prescription is not carried out to the letter it can- not produce the desired effect. Now, 1st, it requires a firm will to leave the dinner-table with an appetite; as long as the craving is felt, one morsel invokes another with irresistible attraction, and, generally speaking, we eat as long as we are hungry, despite the doctors, and even the example of doctors. 2nd. To tell a person of embonpoint to get up early in the morning, is to break his (or her) heart ; they will tell you it will ruin their health ; that if they get up early, they are not fit for any- thing during the rest of the day ; the ladies will230 HANDBOOK OF DINING. complain that their eyes look heavy ; they will all consent to sit up late, but they must have a long snooze in the morning ; and here is one resource lost. 3rd. Eiding is a dear remedy, which does not suit every fortune or every position. Propose to a pretty fat girl to ride, she will consent with delight, but on three conditions — she must have a pretty and quiet horse, a well- made habit of the last fashion, and a handsome fellow to ride with. Now, these three things are not always to be had, so riding is given up. Walking has many other objections. It is so fatiguing, the mud and the dust are dreadful, and the stones cut the pretty little boots, and then, if a pimple, the size of a pin's head, should break out, it is immediately put down to that horrid doctor and his system, which is, of course, aban- doned. Of all medical powers, diet is the most efficient, because it acts incessantly, day and night, sleeping or waking ; it ends by subjugating the individual. Now, the diet against corpulency is indicated by the most common and active cause of obesity ; and as it has been proved that farinaceous food produces fat, in man as well as in animals, it may231 OBESITY. ITS PRETENTION. Q 4 be concluded that abstinence from farinaceous substances tends to diminish embonpoint. I hear my fair friends exclaim that I am a monster, who wishes to deprive them of everything they like. Let them not be alarmed. If they must eat bread, let it be brown bread ; it is very good, but not so nutritious as white bread. If you are fond of soup, have it à la julienne or with vegetables, but no paste, no macaroni. At the first course eat anything you like, except the rice with fowls, or the crust of pâtés. The second course requires more philosophy. Avoid everything farinaceous. You can eat roast, salad, and vegetables. And if you must needs have some sweets, take chocolate, creams, and gelées, and punch in preference to orange or others. Now comes dessert. New danger. But if you have been prudent so far, you will continue to be so. Avoid biscuits and macaroons ; eat as much fruit as you like. After dinner take a cup of coffee and a glass of liqueur. Tea and punch will not hurt you. At breakfast brown bread and chocolate in pre- ference to coffee. No eggs. Anything else youHANDBOOK OF DINING. 2 32 like. You cannot breakfast too early. If you breakfast late, the dinner hour comes before you have properly digested ; you do not eat the less, and this eating without an appetite is a prime cause of obesity ; because it often occurs. The above regulations are to prevent embon- point, the following are for those who are already victims. Drinks every summer, thirty bottles of Seltzer water, a large tumblerful every morning, two hours before breakfast, and the same before you go to bed. Drink white wines and rather acid. Avoid beer like the plague. Eat radishes, arti- chokes, celery ; eat veal and chicken in preference to beef and mutton ; only eat the crust of your bread; you will be all the lighter and younger for it. I must now warn you against a danger which extra zeal might lead you into. That danger is the habitual use of acids, which ignorant people sometimes recommend, and which experience has shown to have very baneful effects. This dreadful doctrine prevails amongst ladies, and the idea that acids, especially vinegar, will prevent embonpoint, carries many a fair girl to an early grave.OBESITY.—ITS CUKE. 233 There is no doubt a continual use of acids will make a person thin ; but it destroys their fresh- ness, their health, their life ; even lemonade, which is the mildest of them, will gradually do harm. This truth cannot be made too public ; many readers could give me examples to support it. I will only give one case which came under my own personal observation. In 1776 I lived at Dijon; I was studying law* chemistry, and medicine. I had a Platonic friendship for one of the most charming persons I have ever met. Louise was a lovely girl, and had that classical embonpoint which charms the eye and is the glory of sculptors. Though only a friend, I was not blind to her attractions, and this is perhaps why I observed her so closely. " Chère amie," I said to her one evening, "you are not well; you seem to be thinner." se Oh ! no," she said, with a smile which partook of melancholy, " I am very well ; and if I am a little thinner I can very well afford it." " Afford it !" I said, with warmth ; (s you can afford neither to gain nor lose ; remain beautiful as you are," and other phrases pardonable to a young man of twenty.HANDBOOK OF DINING. 234 Since that conversation, I watched her more closely with an interest not untinged with anxiety ; gradually I saw her cheeks fall in, her figure decline. One evening at a ball, after dancing a quadrille, I cross-questioned her, and she reluc- tantly avowed that, her school friends having laughed at her, and told her that in two years she would be as fat as St. Christopher, she had for more than a month drunk a glass of vinegar every morning; she added that she had not told any- body of it. I shuddered when I heard her confession ; I was aware of the danger she incurred, and next day I informed her mother, who was terribly alarmed, for she doted upon her child. No time was lost. The very best advice was taken. All in vain! The springs of life had been attacked at the source ; and when the danger was suspected, all hope was already gone. Thus, for having followed an ignorant advice, poor Louise was carried to her grave in her eighteenth year, her last days embittered by the thought that she herself, involuntarily, had cut short her existence. She was the first person I ever saw die ; she died in my arms; as, at her wish, I was raising her235 LEANNESS. up that she might behold the light. Some days after her death, I accompanied her bereaved mother to take a last glance at her countenance. With surprise we observed that a radiant almost an ecstatic expression was on her features, which was not there when she died. I was astonished. The mother drew from it a favourable augury; but this is not a rare occurrence ; Lavater men- tions it in his " Treatise on Physiognomy." Savarin recommends a belt to be worn round the waist, to be gradually tightened as corpulency decreases. He himself wore one with effect for six years. He recommends bark (quinquina) as conducive to reduce embonpoint, a teaspoonful in a glass of white wine about two hours before breakfast. ON LEANNESS. There are two sorts of leanness. The first is that which, being the result of the primitive dis- position of the body, is accompanied by the full health and exercise of all the organic functions, the second is that which, having for cause the weakness of certain organs or the defective action of others, gives a sickly and miserable appear- ance to the individual. I knew a young lady of236 HANDBOOK OF DINING. the middle size, who only weighed sixty-five pounds. Leanness is no disadvantage to a man. He is every bit as strong and more active. The father of the young person I just mentioned, although very thin, was so strong that he could take a chair in his teeth and throw it over his head. But it is a great disaster for ladies, for beauty is their life, and beauty consists chiefly in the rounded limb and graceful curve. The most re- cherché toilet, the best dressmaker in the world, cannot supply certain absences, or hide certain angles. But a woman who is born thin may be fattened like a chicken. It may take more time. The ladies must pardon me the simile, but I could not find a better. Every thin woman would like to be fat: we have heard the wish expressed a thousand times ; it is as a homage to that all-powerful sex that we shall endeavour to replace by real forms those inventions which in the shop-windows shock the sight of the passer by. The whole secret how to get fat consists in a suitable diet. You must know " how to eat," and how to select your food. Let us, then, put down the daily food of someLEANNESS.—ITS CURE. 237 sylph or sylphide that wishes to increase in cor- pulence. General rule. — Eat a quantity of fresh bread — the same day's baking — and do not throw away the crumb. Before eight A.M., when in bed, take a basin of soup (potage au pain or aux pâtes), not too much, or, if you prefer it, a cup of good chocolate. Breakfast at eleven. Fresh eggs, boiled or poached, petits pâtés, cutlets, or anything else ; but eggs are essential. A cup of coffee will not hurt. After breakfast take a little exercise. Gro shop- ping, or call on a friend, sit and chat, and walk home again. At dinner, eat as much soup, meat, and fish as you like, but do not omit to eat the rice with the fowl, macaroni, sweet pastry, creams, &c. At dessert, savoy biscuits, babas, and other fari- naceous preparations which contain eggs and sugar. This diet may seem limited, but it is capable of great variation, and comprises the whole animal kingdom. Drink beer by preference ; otherwise Bordeaux, or wine from the South of France.238 HANDBOOK OF DINING. Avoid acids; except salad, which gladdens the heart. Eat sugar with your fruit, if it admits of it. Do not take baths too cold ; breathe the fresh air of the country as often as you can; eat plenty of grapes when in season ; do not fatigue yourself by dancing at a ball. Gro to bed at eleven o'clock ; on extra nights be in bed by one. If this system is boldly and exactly adhered to, the failings of nature will soon be supplied ; health and beauty will be the result. We fatten sheep, calves, oxen, poultry, carp, crawfish, oysters, whence I deduct the general maxim : 66 Everything that eats can be fattened, pro- vided the food is well and suitably chosen" FASTING. Fasting is a voluntary abstention from food, with a moral or religious object. Although contrary to our inclinations, or rather to our habitual wants, it is nevertheless of great antiquity. It originated in cases of private affliction. If a father, a mother, a beloved child died in a family,239 FASTING. the whole house was in mourning; they wept, they washed and embalmed the body, and it was buried with the honours due to the rank of the deceased. On these occasions men cared little for eating ; they fasted without being aware of it. In like manner, in cases of great public cala- mities, in great droughts or incessant rains, cruel wars or dire pestilences, in a word, in the case of scourges against which toil and industry were of no avail, men gave themselves up to lamentations, and imputed the disasters to the anger of the gods ; they humiliated themselves before them, and mortified the flesh by fasting. The scourges ceased,- and this was attributed to the offerings and fasting, and on future occasions they were again had recourse to. Thus men afflicted by public or private ca- lamities, gave themselves up to sorrow, and neg- lected to take food ; ultimately, they looked upon this voluntary abstinence as an act of religion. They thought that by macerating their body, when mind was in sorrow, they would move the pity of the gods, and this idea taken up by all nations, led to mourning, offerings, prayers, sacri- fices, mortifications, and abstinence.HANDBOOK OF DINING. 240 Finally, our Saviour sanctified fasting, and all Christian sects have adopted it with more or less mortifications. Fasting has considerably fallen off, and there are some persons of such delicate constitution that it is death to them. Here gastronomy steps in to their relief. A man who has undergone great muscular exer- tion, ought to take a good basin of soup, some generous wine, meat, and sleep. A literary man, who excited by his subject has fatigued himself, should seek the open air, take a warm bath, dine on fowl and vegetables, and take repose. ON DEATH. " Omnia mors poscit ; lex est, non poena, perire." The Creator has imposed upon man six grand and principal necessities, which are, birth, action, eating, sleep, reproduction, and death. Death is the absolute interruption of sensual relations and the complete extinction of the vital power, which leaves the body to the laws of de- composition. These various necessities are all accompaniedDEATH. 241 and softened by pleasurable sensations, and even death is not without charms when it is natural, that is to say, when the body has gone through the different phases of growth, virility, old age, and decrepitude, to which it is destined. When Fontenelle was dying, he was asked how he felt : " Simply a difficulty to live," he replied. I was (says Savarin) at the death-bed of an old aunt, watching over her with tenderness. "Are you there, my nephew?" she said, with a voice scarcely audible. "Yes, my aunt, and I think a glass of generous wine would do you good." " Grive it to me, mon ami. I can swallow that." I gave her half a glass of my best wine. She seemed to revive at once, and looking at me with eyes which were once very fine, she said: " Thanks for this last service ; if ever you at- tain my age, you will feel that death is quite as necessary as sleep." These were the last words she ever spoke. Half an hour afterwards she slept the long sleep of death. Schiller, in his master-poem " Lie Kiinstler" * has a beautiful allegory on Life and Death. He * The Artists. Very ably translated by our present Secre- tary for the Colonies, Bulwer Lytton. R242 HANDBOOK OF DINING. compares the life of man to an arch, that is to say, to an imperfect portion of a circle, which is continued throughout the night of the tomb to complete the circle. Now the young moon is such an arch, and the remainder of the circle is not visible.* He places two youths side by side, the one with a lighted torch, the other with his torch extinguished ; the former he compares to that portion of the moon which is light, and the latter with that part which is in darkness. " Da zeigte sich mit umgestûrztem Lichte, An Kastor angelehnt, ein bliïhend Pollux-Bild." Ossian, speaking of a man at death's door, says : — "Death stood behind him like the dark side of the moon behind its silver horn." Dr. Eicherand has described with so much truth and philosophy the last degradations of the hu- man body, and the last moments of the individual, that my readers will thank me for the following extract : —- * " Der Schatten in des Mondes Angesichte." " The shadow in the Moon's pale glimmer seen."DEATH. 243 "The intellectual faculties leave as follows: Keason, that quality of which man pretends to be the exclusive possessor, abandons him the first. He first loses the power of expressing a judgment and then of connecting his ideas. It is then said c he has lost his head/—that he is talking wildly, —that he is delirious. In this state, his favourite ideas prevail, his dominating passion betrays it- self. The miser mumbles about his hoarded gold, and betrays where his hidden treasures lie con- cealed; another dies in religious torments. An- other, in touching words, dwells upon the delights of his distant country. Great weakness is the next step. Memory then goes. The dying man, who even in his delirium could recognise who approached him, now does not know his dearest relations. Soon all feeling is lost ; but the senses expire in a successive and fixed order : taste and smell no longer give any sign of existence ; a veil comes over the eye, and it has a dull appearance; the ear is still sensible to noise and sound. This is why, probably, the ancients used to scream into the ears of the dead. The dying man who has lost taste, smell and hearing, still feels; he is restless on his couch, puts his arms out ; he hasHANDBOOK OF DINING. 244 no pain, he fears not death, his ideas are gone, and he ceases to live as he commenced to live, without knowing how."

Were k to be judged of only by its ths connexion between aborigi- e islands, it would assume a narrative more fresh and agreeable than has lately come before us. Almost the entire island is de- scribed at once in a style vivid and simple, and tions. In Sardinia, though the ground is not so untrodden, Mr. Forester was enabled by his prac- tice of striking into the seclusions of the country, beyond the limits of ordinary travel, to possess himself of much remarkable information, espe- cially in connexion with the revival of ps»gan man- ners and rites among the people—a circumstance which has been particularly noticed in France. Concerning both islands, Mr. Forester interweaves his narrative sprringly and judiciously with frag- ments of history, which have nowhere the charac- ter of digressions. He has related a few local stories which cast much light on the social life of the Corsicans especially A volume of travel so original and varied as Mr. Forester's is a rarity in our days."

SIR KENELMS DIGBIS 242 ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE HARTS- HORN-GELLY Take a small Cock-chick, when it is scalded, slit it in two pieces, lay it to soak in warm water,until the blood be well out of it. Then take a calves foot half boiled, slit it in the middle and pick out the fat and black of it. Put these into a Gallon of fair-water; skim it very well; Then put into it one Ounce of Harts-horn, and one Ounce of Ivory. When it is half consumed, take some of it up in a spoon ; and if it gelly, takeitall up,and put it into a silver bason, orsuchaPewteroneaswill endure Char-coal. Then beat four whites of Eggs, with three or four spoon- fuls of Damask-Rose-water very well together. Then put these into the gelly, with a quarter of an Ounce of Cinnamon broken into very small pieces ; one flake of Mace ; three or four thin slices of Gin- ger; sweeten it with loaf Sugar to your liking; set it then over a chafing dish of coals ; stir it well, and coveritclose ; blowunderit,untilthereariseascum or curd ; let it boil a little, then put into it one top of Rose-mary, two or three of sweet Marjoram ; wring into itthe juyceof half aLimon ; letnotyour curd fall again, for it will spoil the clearness of the gelly. If you will have it more Cordial, you may grind in a Sawcer, with a little hard Sugar, half a grain of Musk, a grain of Ambergreece. It must be boiled in an earthen pipkin, or a very sweet Iron- pot, after the Harts-horn and Ivory is in it. It must constantly boil, until it gellieth. If there arise any scum, it must be taken off.

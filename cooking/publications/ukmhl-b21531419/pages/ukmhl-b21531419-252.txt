19o SIR KENELMS DIGBIS it grow cold in the air, it will not take it in. Mean while prepare your sauce of melted well thickened butter (which you may heighten with shreded Onions or Syves, or what well tasted herbs you please) and if you will, you may first strew upon the fish some very small shreded young Onions,or Sib- bouls, or Syves, or Parsley. Then upon that pour the meltedbutter to coverthe fish all over,andsoak into it. Serve it in warm and covered. TO DRESS PARSNEPS Scrape well three or four good large roots, cleans- ing well their outside,and cutting off asmuch of the little end as is Fibrous, and of the great end as is hard. Put them into a possnet or pot, with about a quart of Milk upon them, or as much as will cover them in boiling, which do moderately, till you find they are very tender. This may be in an hour and half, sooner or later, as the roots are of a good kind. Then take them out, and scrape all the outside into a pulpe, like the pulpe of roasted apples, which put in a dish upona chafing dish of Coals, with a littleof the Milk, you boiled them in, put to them ; not so much as to drown them, but only to imbibe them : and then with stewing, the pulpe will imbibe all that Milk. When you see it is drunk in, put to the pulpe a little more of the same Milk, and stewthat, till it be drunk in. Continue doing thus till it hath drunk in a good quantity of the Milk, and is well swelled with it, and will take in no more, which may be in a goodhalf hour. Eat them so, withoutSugar or Butter ; for they will have a natural sweetness, that is beyond sugar, and will be Unctuous, so as not to need Butter.

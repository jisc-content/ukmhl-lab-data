THE CLOSET OPENED 157 TO ROST FINE MEAT When the Capon, Chickens, or Fowl, have been long enough before the fire, to be through hot, and that it is time to begin to baste them : baste them once all over very well with fresh Butter ; then pre- sently powder it all over very thin with Flower. This by continuing turning before the fire,will make a thin crust, which will keep in all the juyce of the meat. Therefore baste no more, nor do any thing to it, till the meat be enough rosted. Then baste it well with Butter as before, which will make the crust relent and fall away ; which being done, and that the meat is growing brown on the Out-side, besprinkle it over with a little ordinary white Salt in gross- grains ; and continue turning, till the outside be brown enough. The Queen useth to baste such meat with yolks of fresh Eggs beaten thin, which continue to do all the while it is resting. SAVOURY COLLOPS OF VEAL Cut a Leg of Veal into thin Collops, and beat them well with the back of a Knife. Then lay them in soak a good half hour in the yolks of four eggs, and the whites of two very well beaten, and a little small shreded Thyme mingled with it; then lay them in the Frying-pan, wherein is boiling Butter, and pour upon them the rest of the Eggs, that the Collops have not Imbibed, and carry with them, and fry them very well, turning them in due time. Then pour away all the Butter, and make them a Sauce of Gravy seasoned with Salt and Spice, and juyce of Orange at last squeesed upon them.

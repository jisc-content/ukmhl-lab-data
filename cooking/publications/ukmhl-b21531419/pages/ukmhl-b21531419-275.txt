213 THE CLOSET OPENED dry Salt, rubbing it in well: Then lay what quantity you will in a tub for seven or eight days (in which time the Salt dissolveth to water); then take it out, and wipe it dry, and hang it in a room, where they keep fire, either on a hearth, or that smoak cometh out ot a stove into the room (as most of those rooms do smoak) but hang them not in the Chim- ney, that the hot smoak striketh upon them ; but if you have a very large Chimney, hang them pretty high and aside, that the smoak may not come full upon them. After a while, (when they are dry) take them thence, and hang them from the smoak in a dry warm room. When the weather groweth warm as in May, there will drop from them a kinde of melted oyly grease, and they will heat, and grow resty, if not remedied.

Change the Hay every thirty, or twenty, or fifteen days, till September, when the weather groweth cool ; then hang them up again in the free air, in a dry Cham- ber. If you make the shoulders into Gambons, you must have a care to cut away a little piece of flesh within, called in Dutch the Mause ; for if that re- main in it, the Bacon will grow resty.

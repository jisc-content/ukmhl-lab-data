SIR KENELMS DIGBIE 206 into each pot, for bigger are unwieldy. Into every pot, put twelve cornsof whole Pepper,four Cloves, a great Onion peeled and quartered, and two bay- leaves, before you put them into the oven. Before they are set in, you do not fill them with water to the top, least any should spill in sliding them in; but fill them up by a bowl fastned to a long Pole. No water must be put in, after the oven is closed (northeovenever beopened,till afterall is through- ly baked) and therefore you must put in enough at first to serve to the last; you must rowl your Col- lars as close as may be, that no air may be left in the folds of them : and sow them up in exceeding strong cloth, which a strong man must pull as hard as He can in the sowing. Their cloths must not be pulled off, till the Collars have been three or four days out of the oven, least you pull off part of the Brawn with them. You may put the same proportion of Pepper, Cloves, &c. into the Souce drink as you did in the baking them ; which at either time (especially at first) give them a fine taste. The Souce-drink is made of six shillings Beer, and Thames or River- water, of each an equal quantity, well boiled with Salt. When boiled and cold, putintoittwoor three quarts of skimmed Milk, only to colour it; and so change it once in three Weeks.

SALLET OF COLD CAPON ROSTED It is a good Sallet, to slice a cold Capon thin ; mingle with it some Sibbolds, Lettice, Rocket and

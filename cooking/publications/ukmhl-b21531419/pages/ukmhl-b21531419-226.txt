164 SIR KENELMS DIGBIS pipkin with the flat-side downward. Take three pints of Elder-wine-vinegar, and as much water, and three great Onions, and a bunch of Rosemary tyed up together. Put them all into a Pipkin, and stew them three or four hours together with a soft fire being covered close. Then dish it up upon sip- pets, blowing off the fat from the Gravy; and some of the Gravy put into the Beef, and serve it up. TO BOIL SMOAKED FLESH Mounsieur Overbec doth tell me, that when He boileth a Gambon of Bacon, or any salted flesh and hanged in the smoak (as Neats-tongues, Hung- beef, and Hogs-cheeks, &c.), He putteth into the Kettle of water to boil with them threeorfour hand- fuls offleur de foin, (more or less according to the quantity of flesh and water,) tyed loosly in a bag of course-cloth. This maketh it much tenderer, shorter, mellower, and of a finer colour. A PLAIN BUT GOOD SPANISH OGLIA Take a Rump of Beef, or some of Brisket or But- tock cut into pieces, a loin of Mutton, with the su- perfluous fat taken off, and a fleshy piece of the Leg of Veal or a Knuckle, a piece of enterlarded Bacon, three or 4 Onions (or some Garlike) and if you will, a Capon or two, or three great tame Pigeons. First, put into the water the Beef and the Bacon ; After a while, the Mutton and Veal and Onions. But not the Capon or Pigeons till only so much time remain, as will serve barely to boil them enough. If you have Garavanzas, put them in at the first, after they have been soaked with Ashes all night in heat, and well washed with warm water.

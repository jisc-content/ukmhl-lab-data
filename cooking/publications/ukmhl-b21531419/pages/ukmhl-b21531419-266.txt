SIR KENELMS DIGBIS 204 is cut, in the Liquor, wherein Capons and Veal, or Mutton have been boiled, so to make very strong broth of them. The bones must be broken, thatyou may have the Marrow of them in the Liquor ; and they must stew a long time(covering the pot close:) that you may make the broth as strong as you can ; and if you put some gravy of Mutton or Veal to it, it will be the better. When the Pasty is half baked, pour some of this broth into it, by the hole at the top ; and the rest of it, when it is quite baked, and wanteth but standing in the oven to soak. Or put itall in at once, when the Pasty is sufficiently baked, and afterwards let it remain in the oven a good while soaking. You may bake the bones (broken) with the broth and gravy, or for want thereof, with only water in an earthen pot close stopped, till you have all the substance in the Liquor ; which you may pour into the Pasty an hour before it is baked enough. If you are in a Park, you may soak the Venison a night in the blood of the Deer ; and cover the flesh with it, clotted together when you put it in paste. Mutton blood also upon Venison, is very good. You may season your blood a little with Pepper and Salt. TO BAKE VENISON TO KEEP After you have boned it,andcutawayallthesinews, then season it with Pepper and Salt pretty high, and divide a Stag into four pots; thenputaboutapound of Butterupon the topof each pot, and cover it with Rye-past pretty thick. Your oven must be so hot, that after awhole night it maybe baked very tender,

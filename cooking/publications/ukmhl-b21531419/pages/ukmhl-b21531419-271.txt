209 THE CLOSET OPEC^ED TO BAKE PIDGEONS, (WHICH ARETHUS EXCELLENT, AND WILL KEEP A QUAR- TER OF A YEAR) OR TEALS, OR WILD- DUCKS Season them duly with Pepper and Salt; then lay them in the pot, and put store of Butter, and some Claret-wine to them. Cover and bake as above: but a less while according to the tenderness of the meat. In due time take out your pot, and your birds out of it, which press not, but only wipe off theLiquor. Pour it out all. Clarifie theButter; put in the birds again, and the clarified butter, and as much more as needs (all melted) upon them, and let it cool. You may put a few Bay-leaves upon any of these baked meats, between the meat and the Butter. GREEN-GEESE-PYE An excellent cold Pye is thus made. Take two fat Green-geese; bone them, and lay them in paste one upon the other, seasoning them well with Pepper and Salt, and some little Nutmeg, both above and belowandbetween the two Geese. When it is well- baked and out of the oven, pour in melted Butter at a hole made in the top. The crust is much better than of a Stubble-goose. TO BOIL BEEF OR VENISON TENDER AND SAVOURY The way to have Beef tenderest, short and best boiled, as my Lordof Saint Albanâ€™s useth it, is thus. Take a rump or brisket of beef; keep it without salt as long as you may, without danger to have it smell ill. For so it groweth mellow and tender, which it would not do, if it were presently salted. o

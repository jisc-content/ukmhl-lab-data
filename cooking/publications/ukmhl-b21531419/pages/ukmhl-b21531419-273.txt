21 I THE CLOSET OPENED in a Pye, seasoned with Pepper and Salt, adding a pretty deal of Parsley, a little sweet-marjoram and Savoury, and a very little Thyme. Rost wilde Ducks putting into their Bellies some Sageanda little Onion(both well shreded) wrought into a lump with butter, adding a little Pepper and Salt. And let their sauce bealittle gravy of Mutton, to enlarge the seasoned gravy, that comes from the Ducks when they are cut up. TO SOUCE TURKEYS Take a good fat Turkey or two; dress them clean, and bone them ; then tye them up in the manner of Sturgeon with some thing clean washed. Take your kettle, and put into it a pottle of good White- wine, a quart of Water, and a quart of Vinegar ; make it boil, and season it with Salt pretty well. Then put in your Turkeys, and let them boil till they be very tender. When they are enough boiled, take them out, and taste the Liquor; if it be not sharp enough, put more Vinegar, and let it boil a little; then put it into an earthen pot, that will hold both Turkeys. When it is cold enough, and the Turkeys through-cold,put them into theLiquor in the Pot, and be sure they be quite covered with the Liquor; Let them lye in it three weeks or a month; Then serve it to the table, with Fennel on it, and eat it with elder Vinegar. You may do a Capon or two put together in the same manner: but first lardingitwithgreatLardons rowled in Pepper and Salt. A shorter time lying in the pickle will serve.

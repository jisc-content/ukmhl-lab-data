170 SIR KENELME DIG BIS and half before you take it out to serve it up, open the Oven,and draw out the dish far enough to pour in at the little hole of the cover the strong decoc- tion (in stead of decoction in water, you may boil it by it self in Balneo in duplici vase ; or bake it in a potwith broth and Gravy of Mutton)of the broken bones and flesh. Then set it in again, to make an end of his baking and soaking. The meat within (even the lean) will be exceeding tender and like a gelly ; so that you may cut all of it with a spoon. If you bake a side at once in two dishes, the one will be very good to keep cold ; and when it is so, you may, if you please,bake it again,to have it hot; not so long as at first, but enough to have it all per- fectly heated through. She bakes thus in Pewter- dishes of a large cise. Mutton or Veal may be thus baked with their due seasoning; as with Onions, or Onions and Ap- ples, or Larding, or a Cawdle, &c. Sweetbreads, Beatifies, Champignons, Treuffles, &c. AN EXCELLENT WAY OF MAKING MUTTON STEAKS Cut a Rack of Mutton into tender Steaks, Rib by Rib, and beat the flesh well with the back of a Knife. Then have a composition ready, made of Crumbs of stale Manchet grated small, and a little Salt (a fit proportion to Salt the meat) and a less quantity of White-pepper. Cover over on both sides all the flesh with this, pretty thick, pressing it on with your fingers and flat Knife, to make it lie on. Then lay the Steaks upon a Gridiron over a very quick fire (for herein consisteth the well doing)

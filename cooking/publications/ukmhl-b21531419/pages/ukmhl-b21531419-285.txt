TO MAKE SL1PP COAT CHEESE According to the bigness of your moulds propor- tion your stroakings for your Cheese-curds. To six quarts of stroakings, take a pint of Spring- water : if the weather be hot, then let the water be cold, and before you put it into the stroakings, let them stand a while to cool after they are milked, and then put in the water with a little Salt first stirred in it : and having stirred it well together, let it stand a little while, and then put in about two good spoonfulsof Runnet, stir it well together,and cover it with a fair linnen-cloth, and when it is be- come hard like a thick jelly, with a skimming-dish lay it gently into the moulds, and as it sinks down into the moulds, fill it still up again, till all be in, which will require some three or four hours time. Then lay a clean fine cloth into another mould of the same cise, and turn it into it, and then turn the skirts of the cloth over it, and lay upon that a thin board, and upon that as much weight, as with the board may make two pound or thereabouts. And about an hour after, lay another clean cloth into the other mould, and turn the Cheese into that ; then lay upon the board so much, as will make it six or seven pound weight; and thus continue turning of it till night : then take away the weight, and lay it no more on it; then take a very small quantity of Salt finely beaten, and sprinkle the Cheese all over

H3 THE CLOSET OPE.^ED big to pass through the strainer, after they have given their taste to the quantity, in boiling a suffi- cient while therein, you put them away with the husks of the Pease. The Pint of Pease that you reserve whole, is only to show that it is Pease-por- age. They must be of the thickness of ordinary Pease-porage. For which these proportions will make about a Gallon. BROTH FOR SICK AND CONVALESCENT PERSONS Put a Crag-end of a Neck of Mutton, a Knuckle of Veal, and a Pullet into a Pipkin of water, with a spoonful or two of French-barley first scalded in a water or two. The Pullet is put in after the other meat is well skimmed, and hath boiled an hour. A good hour after that, put in a large quantity of Sorrel, Lettice, Purslane, Borage and Bugloss,and boil an hour more at least three hours in all. Be- fore you put in the herbs, season the broth with Salt, a little Pepper and Cloves, strain out the broth and drink it. But for Potage, put at first a good piece of fleshy young Beef with the rest of the meat. And put not in your herbs till half an hour before you take off the Pot. When you use not herbs, but Carrots and Turneps, put in a little Peny-royal and a sprig of Thyme. Vary in the season with Green-pease, or Cucumber quartered longwise, or Green sower Ver- juyce Grapes; always well-seasoned with Pepper and Salt and Cloves. You pour some of the broth upon the sliced-bread by little and little, stewing it, before you put the Herbs upon the Potage.

241 THE CLOSET OPENED TO MAKE HARTS-HORN GELLY Take a pound of Harts-horn, and a prety big lean Chicken, and put it into a skillet with about nine quarts of water, and boil your stock prety stiff, so that you may cut it with a knife ; you may try it in a spoon, as it is a boiling. Then drain your liquor clear away from the Harts-horn through a fine searse, and let it stand until the next morning; Then if there be any fat upon it, pare it away, and likewise the settlings at the bottom. Then put your Geliy into a good big skillet, and put to it a quart of the palest white-wine that you can procure, oraquartof Rhenish-wine, and one pound of double refined Sugar, and half an Ounce of Cinnamon broken into small pieces,with threeorfourflakesofMace. Then set it upon the fire, and boil it a good pace. Then have the whites of sixteen Eggs beaten to a high froth ; so put in the froth of your Eggs, and boil it five or six Walms; then put in the juyce of six Limons, and boil it a little while after, and then run it into a silver bason through your gelly-bag : and keep it warm by the fire, until it have run through the second time. You must observe to put but a very little into your bag at a time for the second run- ning, that it may but little more then drop ; and it will be so much the clearer: and you must not remove the whites of Eggs nor Spice out of the bag, all the while it is running. And if the weather be hot, you need notput in so much wine; for it will not then be so apt to gelly as in cold weather. Q

9o SIR KENELME DIGBIE TO MAKE METHEGLIN THAT LOOKS LIKE WHITE-WINE Take to twelve gallons of water, a handful of each of these Herbs : Parsley, Eglantine, Rosemary, Strawberry-leaves, Wild-thyme, Baulme, Liver- wort, Betony, Scabious : when the water begins to boil, cast in the herbs : let them boil a quarter of an hour : then strain out the herbs; and when it is al- most cold, then put in as much of the best honey, you can get, as will bear an Egg to the breadth of two pence ; that is, till you can see no more of the Egge above the water, then a two pence will cover: Lave it and stir it till you see all the honey be melted; then boil it well half an hour, at the least: skim it well,andput inthe whitesof six Eggs beaten,toclari- fie it: Then strain it into some woodden vessels ; and when it is almost cold, put some Ale-barm into it. And when it worketh well, Tun it into some well seasoned vessel, where neither Ale nor Beer hath been, for marring the colour of it. When it hath done working, if you like it, Take a quantity of Cloves, Nutmegs, Mace, Cinnamon, Ginger, or any of these that you like best, and bruise them, and put them in a boulter bag, and hang it in the vessel. Put not too much of the Spice, because many do notlike the taste of much Spice. If you make it at Michael- mas, you may tap it at Christmas : but if you keep it longer, it will be the better. It will look pure, and drink with as much spirit as can be,and very pleasant. TO MAKE WHITE METHEGLIN Take Sweet-marjoram, Sweet-bryar-buds, Violet- leaves, Strawberry-leaves, of each one handful, and

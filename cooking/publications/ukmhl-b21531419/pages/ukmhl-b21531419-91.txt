29 THE CLOSET OPENED do other Spirits ; At last an oyl will come, which is not for this use. Sir Thomas Gower maketh his ordinary drink thus : Make very small well Brewed Ale. To eight Gallons of this put one Gallon of honey ; when it is well dissolved and clarified, tun up the Liquor, making it work in due manner with barm. When it hath done working, stop it up close, and in three months it will be fit to drink. He makes Metheglin thus. Make a good De- coct of Eglantine-leaves, Cowslip flowers, a little Sweet-marjoram, and some Rosemary and Bay- leaves, Betony, and Scabious, and a little Thyme. After the sediment hath settled, put J or J- or ^ or ^ part of honey, (according as you would have it strong, and soon ready) to the clear severed from the settlement, and stir it exceeding well with stripped arms 4 or 5 hours, till it be per- fectly incorporated. Then boil and scum it ; let it then cool and tun it up, &c. After it hath cooled, lade the clean from the settlement, so that it may not trouble it, and run up the clear thus severed from the settlings. Much of the perfec- tion consisteth in stirring it long with stripped arms before you boil it. Then to boil it very leisurely till all the scum be off. And order your fire so, that the scum may rise and drive all to one side. This will be exceeding pale clear and pleasant Metheglin. He useth to every Gallon of water, a good handful of Eglantine-leaves, and as much Cowslip flowers ; but onely a Pugil of Thyme or Marjoram.

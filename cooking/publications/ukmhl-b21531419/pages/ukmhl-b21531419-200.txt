138 SIR KENELMS DIGBIS half hour before you are to take your possnet from the fire. You are to season your Gruel with a little salt, at the due time ; and you may put in a little Nutmeg and Mace to it. When you have taken it from the fire, put into it a good proportion ol butter, which stir well, to incorporate with the Gruel, when it is melted. ABOUT WATER GRUEL When you set to the fire a big pot of Oat-meal, (which must be but once cut, that is, every corn cut once a two) and water, to make water-gruel; Let it boil long, till it be almost boiled enough, then make it rise in a great ebullition, in great galloping waves, and skim of all the top, that ris- eth ; which may be a third part of the whole, and is the Cream, and hath no gross-visible Oat-meal in it. Boil that a while longer by it self, with a little Mace and Nutmeg, and season it with Salt. When it is enough, take it off, and put Sugar, Butter, and a little Red rose-water to it, and an Egg with a little White-wine, if you like it, and would have it more nourishing. This is by much better, then the part which remaineth below with the body of the Oat- meal. Yet that will make good Water-gruel for the servants. If you boil it more leisurely you must skim off the Cream, as it riseth in boiling ; else it will quickly sink down again to the rest of the gross Oat-meal. And thus you may have a finer Cream then with hasty boiling.

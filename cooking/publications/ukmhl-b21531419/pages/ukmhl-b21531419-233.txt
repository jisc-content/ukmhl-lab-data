THE CLOSET OPENED 171 and when the fire hath pierced in a little on the one side, turn the other, before any juyce drop down through the Powder. This turning the steaks will make the juyce run back the other way; and before it run through, and drop through this side, you must turn again the other side ; doing so till the Steaks be broiled enough. Thus you keep all the juyce in them, so that when you go to eat them (which must be presently, as they are taken from the fire) abundance of juyce runneth out as soon as your Knife entereth into the flesh. The same Per- son, that doth this, rosteth a Capon so as to keep all its juyce in it. The mystery of it is in turning it so quick, that nothing can drop down. This mak- eth it the longer in rosting. But when you cut it up, the juyce runneth out, as out of a juycie leg of Mutton ; and it is excellent meat. EXCELLENT GOOD COLLOPS Take two legs of fleshyjuycie tender young Mut- ton, cut them into as thin slices as maybe. Beat them with the back of athick Knife, with smart, but gentle blows, for a long time, on both sides. And the stroaks crossing one another every way, so that the Collops be so short, that they scarce hang to- gether. This quantity is near two hours beating. Then lay them in a clean frying-pan, and hold them over a smart fire : And it is best to have a fit cover for the Pan, with a handle at the top of it, to take it off when you will. Let them fry so covered, till the side next the Pan be done enough ; then turn the other side, and let that fry, till it be enough. Then Pour them with all the Gravy (which will be

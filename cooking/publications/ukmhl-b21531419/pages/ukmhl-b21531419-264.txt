202 SIR KENELMS DIGBIS porate it well with them, by stirring them together. You stew these between two dishes. The quickest Apples are the best. PORTUGUEZ EGGS The way that the Countess de Penalva makes the Portuguez Eggs for the Queen, is this. Take the yolks (clean picked from the whites and germ) of twelve new-laid Eggs. Beat them exceedingly with a little (scarce a spoonful) of Orange-flower-water. When they are exceeding liquid, clear, and uni- formly a thin Liquor, put to them one pound of pure double refined Sugar (if it be not so pure, it must be clarified before) and stewthem in yourdish or bason over a very gentle fire, stirring them con- tinually, whiles they are over it, so that the whole may become one uniform substance, of the consist- ence of an Electuary (beware they grow not too hard ; for without much caution and attention, that will happen on a sudden) which then you may eat presently, or put into pots to keep. You may dissolve Ambergreece (if you will, ground first very much with Sugar) in Orange-flower or Rose-water, before hand, and put it (warm and dissolved) to the Eggs, when you set them to stew. If you clarifie your Sugar, do it with one of these waters, and whites of Eggs. The flavor of these sweet-waters goeth almost all away with boiling. Therefore half a spoonful put into the composition, when you take it from the fire, seasoneth it more then ten times as much, put in at the first.

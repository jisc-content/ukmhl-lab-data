THE CLOSET OPENED 75 whole day, until the honey be consumed. Then let it stand a whole night again a clearing. Then put it into a kettle, and let it boil a quarter of an hour, with the whites and shells of six Eggs ; Then strain it clean, and so let it stand a cooling. Then put it into a barrel, and take Cloves, Mace, Cinamon, Nutmegs, and beat them together : put them into a linnen bag, hang it with a thread into the barrel. If you would have it work, that you may drink of it presently, take the whites of two or three Eggs, a spoonful of barm, a spoonful of wheat-flower ; beat all these together : Let it work, before you stop it up. Then afterwards stop it well with clay and salt tempered together, to keep it moist. TO MAKE METHEGLIN If your honey be tryed, take six Gallons of Milk- warm-water, to one of honey,and stir it well together ever and anon,and so let itstandforadayand night, or half a day may serve ; then boil it with a gentle fire, for the space of half an hour or thereabouts, and skim it, still as the skum ariseth. After it is scummed once or twice, you may put in your herbs, and spice grosly beaten, one half loose ; the other in a bag, which afterwards may be fastned with a string to the tap-hole, as Pepper, Cloves, Mace, Ginger and the like ; when it is thus boiled, let it stand in the vessel until it be cooled ; then Tun it up into your barrel, and let it work two or three days, or more before you stop the bung-hole ; but in putting up the boiled liquor into the barrel, re- serve the thick grounds back, which will be settled in the pan or kettle.

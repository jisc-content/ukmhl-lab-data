Then pour it into a warm dish, and squeese some juyceof Orange upon it, and soserveitup. If you would havethe meatfirst made brown and Rissole, fry it first with Butter, till it be brown on the outside; then pour out all theButter, and put water to it,in which boil it,and do all as be- fore. If you like Onions or Garlike, you may put some to the water. Fresh broth may be used (both ways) instead of water, and maketh it more Savoury. A NOURISHING HACHY TAKEgood Gravy of Mutton or Veal, or of both,with the fat clean skimmed off. Break into it a couple of new-laid Eggs, and stir them in it over a Chafing- dish of Coals; in the mean time, mingle some small cut juycy hashy of Rabet, Capon or Mutton with another parcel of like Gravy as above, till it be pretty thin. Then put this to the other upon the fire, and stir them well with a spoon, whiles they heat. When all is heated through, it will quicken of a sudden. You may put in at first a little chipping of crusty bread, if you will. Season this with white Pepper, Salt, juyce of Orange or Verjuyce, of Berberies, or Onion, or what you like best.

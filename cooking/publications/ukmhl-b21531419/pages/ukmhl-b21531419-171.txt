THE CLOSET OPEVjED 109 THE COUNTESS OF NEWPORTâ€™S CHER- RY WINE Pick the best Cherries free from rotten, and pick the stalk from them; put them into an earthen Pan. Bruise them,by griping and straining them in your hands,and let them stand all night; on the next day strain them out (through a Napkin ; which if it be a course and thin one, let the juyce run through a Hippocras or gelly bag, upon a pound of fine pure Sugar in powder, to every Gallon of juyce) and to every gallon put a pound of Sugar, and put it into a vessel. Be sureyour vessel be full,or your winewill be spoiled; you must let it standamonthbeforeyou bottle it; and in every bottle you must put a lump (a piece as big as a Nutmeg) of Sugar. The vessel must not be stopt until it hath done working. STRAWBERRY WINE Bruise the Strawberries, and put them into a Lin- nen-bag which hath been a little used, that so the Liquor may run through more easily. You hang in the bag at the bung into the vessel, before you do put in your Strawberries. The quantity of the fruit is left to your discretion ; for you will judge to be there enough of them, when the colour of the wine is high enough. During the working, you leave the bung open. The working being over,you stop your vessel. Cherry-wine is madeafter the same fashion. But it is a little more troublesome to break the Cherry-stones. But it is necessary, that if your Cherries be of the black soure Cherries, you put to it a little Cinnamon, and a few Cloves.

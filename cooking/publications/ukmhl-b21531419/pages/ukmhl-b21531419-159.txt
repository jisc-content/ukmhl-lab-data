THE CLOSET OPENED 97 three fingers breadth of the top (for otherwise it will break the vessel with working) and leave the bung open whiles it worketh, which will be six weeks very strongly, though it be put into a cold cellar. And after nine moneths, you may begin to drink it. MORELLO WINE To half an Aume of white wine, take twenty pounds of Morello Cherries, the stalks being first plucked off. BruisetheCherriesandbreakthestones. Pour into the Wine the juyce that comes out from the Cherries ; but put all the solid substance of them into a long bag of boulter-cloth, and hang it in the Wine at the bung, so that it lie not in the bottom, but only reach to touch it, and therefore nail it down at the mouth of the bung. Then stop it close. For variety, you may put some clear juyce of Cherries alone (but drawn from a larger proportion of Cher- ries) intoanother parcel ofWine. To either of them, if you will Aromatise the drink, take to this quantity two Ounces of Cinnamon grosly broken and bruis- ed, and put it in a little bag at the spiggot, that all the wine you draw may run through the Cinnamon. You must be careful in bruising the Cherries, and breaking the stones. For if you do all at once, the Liquor will sparkle about. But you must first bruise the Cherries gently in a mortar, and rub through a sieve all that will pass, and strain the Residue hard through your hands. Then beat the remaining hard so strongly, as may break all the stones. Then put all together, and strain the clean through a subtil strainer, and put the solider sub- stance into the bag to hang in the Wine. G

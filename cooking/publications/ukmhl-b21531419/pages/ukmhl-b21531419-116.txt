When it is almost cold, put barm to it, and when it worketh well,Tun it into a well-seasoned vessel, where neither Ale nor Beer hath been, for marring the colour; and when it hath done working, take a good quantity of Nutmegs, Mace, Cinnamon,Cloves and Ginger bruised, and put it into a boulter bag, and hang it in the barrel. If you will have it taste much of the spice, let it boil 3 or 4 walms in it, after you have put in the honey. But that will make it have a deep colour. A RECEIPT FOR MEATHE To seven quarts of water, take two quarts of honey, and mix it well together ; then set it on the fire to boil, and take three or four Parsley-roots, and as many Fennel-roots, and shave them clean, andslice them, and put them into the Liquor, and boil alto- gether, and skim it very well all the while it is a boyling; and when there will no more scum rise, then is it boiled enough: but be careful that none of the scum do boil into it.

THE CLOSET OPENED 107 WEAK HONEY-DRINK Take nine pints of warm fountain water, and dis- solve in it one pint of pure White-honey, by laving it therein, till it be dissolved. Then boil it gently, skimming it all the while, till all the scum be per- fectly scummed off; and after that boil it a little longer, peradventure a quarter of an hour. In all it will require twoorthree hours boiling, so thatatlast one third part may be consumed. About a quarter of an hour before you cease boiling, and take it from the fire, put to it a little spoonful of cleansed and sliced Ginger ; and almost half as much of the thin yellow rinde of Orange, when you are even ready to take it from the fire, so as the Orange boil only one walm in it. Then pour it into a well-glased strong deep great Gally-pot, and let it stand so, till it be al- most cold, that it be scarce Luke-warm. Then put to it a little silver-spoonful of pure Ale-yest, and work it together with a Ladle to make it ferment: as soon as it beginneth to do so, cover it close with a fit cover, and put a thick dubbled woollen cloth about it. Cast all things so that this may be done when you are going to bed. Next morning when you rise, you will find the barm gathered all together in the middle ; scum it clean off with asilver-spoon and a feather, and bottle up the Liquor, stopping it very close. It will be ready to drink in two or three days; but it will keep well a month or two. It will be from the first very quickand pleasant. MR. WEBBâ€™S ALE AND BRAGOT Five Bushels of Malt will make two Hogsheads. The first running makes one very good Hogshead,

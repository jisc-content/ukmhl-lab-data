SIR KE NELMS DIGS IS 214 and tender. You must not take much Sorrel, for fear of turning the Cream ; but less Tansey, so little that it may not taste distinctlyin the composi- tion. The juyce of Limons is put in at the end of all. You may lay thin slices of Limon upon the Tansey made, and Sugar upon them. ANOTHER WAY Beat twelve Eggs (six whites put away) by them- selves exceeding well (two or three hours), some- times putting in a spoonful of Cream to keep them from oyling; Then mingle them well with a quart of Cream ; to which put about half a pint of juyce of Spinage (as much as will make the Cream green) or of green wheat, and four spoonfuls of juyce or Tansey, one Nutmeg scraped into thin slices, and half a pound of Sugar ; All things exceeding well Incorporated together; Fry this with fresh butter, no more then to glase the Pan over, and keep the Tansey from sticking to the Pan. TO MAKE CHEESE-CAKES Take twelve quarts of Milk warm from the Cow, turn it with a good spoonful of Runnet. Break it well, and put it into a large strainer, in which rowl it up and down, that all the Whey mayrun out into a little tub ; when all that will is run out, wring out more. Then break the curds well; then wring it again, and more whey will come. Thus break and wring till no more come. Then work the Curds exceedingly with your hand in a tray, till they be- come a short uniform Paste. Then put to it the yolks of eight new laid Eggs, and two whites, and a pound of butter. Work all this long together.

140 SIR KENELMS DIGBIS I should like to put some pulp of Barley, boiled by it self, to strain with the Almond-Milk, and, if you will, some Melon seeds. You may put some juyce of Limon or Orange to it. Also season it with Cin- namon, and make the broth stronger of the flesh. The Queens white Potage is made only of the white flesh of Capon beaten with good broth and strained, and a little juyce of Limon or Orange; but no Almonds. PRESSIS NOURISSANT The Queen Mothers Pressis was thus made. Take un Gigot of Mutton, a piece of Veal, and a Capon (or half the quantity of each of these) and put them to rost with convenient fire, till they are above half rosted,or rather, till they be two thirds rosted. Then take them oft, and squeese out all their juyce in a press with screws, and scum all the fat from it, and put it between two dishes upon a Chafing-dish of Coals to boil a very little, or rather but to heat well; for by then it is through hot, the juyce will be rip- ened enough to drink, whereas before it was raw and bloody ; then if you perceive any fat to remain and swim upon it, dense it away with a Feather. Squeese the juyce of an Orange (through a holed spoon) into half a Porrenger full of this, and add a little Salt, and drink it. The Queen used this at nights in stead of a Supper ; for when she took this, she did eat nothing else. It is of great, yet tem- perate nourishment. If you take a couple of Part- ridges in stead of a Capon, it will be of more nourish- ment, but hotter. Great weaknesses and Consump- tions have been recovered with long use of this,

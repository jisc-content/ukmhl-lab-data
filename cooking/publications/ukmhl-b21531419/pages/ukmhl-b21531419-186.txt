I24 SIR kenelms digs is ORDINARY POTAGE Take the fleshy and sinewy part of a leg of Beef, crag-ends of necks of Veal and Mutton. Put them in a ten quarts pot, and fill it up with water. Begin to boil about six a clock in the Morning, to have your potage ready by Noon. When it is well skim- med, put in two or three large Onions in quarters, and half a loaf (in one lump) of light French bread, or so much of the bottom crust of a Venison Pasty ; all which will be at length clean dissolved in the broth. In due time season it with Salt, a little Pep- per, and a very few Cloves. Likewise at a fit dis- tance, before it be ended boiling, put in store of good herbs, as in Summer, Borrage, Bugloss, Pur- slain, Sorel, Lettice, Endive, and what else you like ; in Winter, Beetes, Endive, Parsley-roots, Cabbage, Carrots, whole Onions, Leeks, and what you can get or like, with a little S weet-marj oram and exceed- ing little Thyme. Order it so that the broth be very strong and good. To which end you may after four hours (or three) boil a Hen or Capon in it; light French-bread sliced, must be taken about noon, and tosted a little before the fire, or crusts of crisp new French-bread ; lay it in a dish, and pour some of the broth upon it, and let it stew a while upon a Chaf- ing-dish. Then pour in more Broth, and if you have a Fowl, lay it upon the bread in the broth, and fill it up with broth, and lay the herbs and roots all over and about it, and let it stew a little longer, and so serve it up covered, after you have squeesed some juyce of Orange or Limon, or put some Ver- juyce into it. Or you may beat two or three Eggs,

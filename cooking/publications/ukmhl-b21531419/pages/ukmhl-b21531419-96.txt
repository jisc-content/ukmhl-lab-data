A RECEIPT FOR WHITE METHEGL1N Take to every quart of honey, 4, 5, or 6, quarts of water; boil it on a good quick fire as long as any scum riseth ; as it boils, put about half a pint of water at a time very often, and scum it very well as it riseth; and be sure to keep it up to the same height and quantity as at the first : Put into it a little Rosemary, according to the quantity that you make, and boil it half a quarter of an hour ; scum it very well. You may put a little Ginger into it, onely to give it a taste there- of, and let it have a little walm of heat after it. Then take and put it into a Woodden vessel,(which must be well scalded, least it taste of any thing) let it stand all night, and the next morning strain it through a sieve of hair. Then if you please, you may boil up your grounds that are in the bottome of the vessel with three or four quarts of water; and when it is cold, strain it, to the rest, and put to it a little good light barm. That which you make in the winter, you must let it stand three days and three nights covered up, before you bottle it up ; and two nights in summer, and then bottle it up. But be sure, you scum off the barm before the bott- ling up.

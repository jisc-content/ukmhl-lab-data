SIR KENELMS DIGBI8 252 porated and clear, strew in a little more of the Su- gar ; and continue doing so by little and little, till you have put in all your Sugar; which course will make the colour the finer. When they are boiled enough, take them off, and bruise them with the back of a spoon ; and when they are cold, put them . up in pots. You may do the same with Morello Cherries ; which will have a quicker-tast, and have a fine, pure, shining, dark colour. Both sorts will keep well all the year. MARMULATE OF CHERRIES WITH JUYCE OF RASPES AND CURRANTS Mingle juyce of Raspes and red Currants with the stoned Cherries, and boil this mixture into Mar- mulate, with a quarter, or at most, a third part of Sugar. The juyces must be so much as to make Geliy of them to mingle handsomely with the Cherries, to appear among and between them. Madam Plancy (who maketh this sweet-meat for the Queen) useth this proportion. Take three pounds of Cherries stoned ; half a pound of clear juyce of raspes, and one pound of the juyce of red currants, and one pound of fine Sugar. Put them all together into the preserving pan ; boil them with a quick fire, especially at the first, skimming them all the while, as any scum riseth. When you find them of a fit consistence, with a fine clear gelly, mingled with the Cherries, take the preserv- ing pan from the fire, and braise the Cherries with the back of your preserving spoon ; and when they are of a fit temper of coolness, pot them up.

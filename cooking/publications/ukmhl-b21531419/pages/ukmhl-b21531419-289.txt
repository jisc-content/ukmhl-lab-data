THE CLOSET OPENED 227 begins to stiffen, lay green grass or rushes upon it: when it is stiff"enough,let rushes be laid both under and over it. If this Cheese be rightly made, and the weather good to dry it, it will be ready in eight days : but incase it doth notdry well, you must lay it on linnen-cloth, and woollen upon it, to hasten the ripening of it. TO MAKE A SCALDED CHEESE Take six gallons of new milk: put to it two quarts of the evening Cream ; then put to it good runnet for winter Cheese; let it stand, till it be even well, then sink it as long as you can get any whey out: then put it into your fat, and set it in the press, and let it stand half an hour : in this time turn it once. When you take it out of the Press, set on the fire two gallons of the same whey; then put your Cheese in a big bowl, break the Curd as small with your hands as you do your Cheese-cakes: when your whey is scalding hot, take off" the scum : lay your strainer over the Curd, and put in your whey: take a slice, and stir up your Curd, that it may scald all alike : put in as much whey as will cover it well: if you find that cold, put it out, and put in more to it that is hot. Stir it as before : then cover it with a linnen and woollen cloth: then set some new whey on the fire, put in your Cheese-fat and suter and cloth. After three quarters of an hour, take up the Curd, and put it into the Cheese fat, as fast, as two can work it in: then put it into the hot cloth,and set it into thePress. Have a care to look to it, and after awhile turn it,and so keep it in the press with turn- ing, till the next day : then take it forth and Salt it.

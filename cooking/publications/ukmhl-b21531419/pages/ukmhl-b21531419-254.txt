192 SIR KENELMS DIGB18 pipkin. Make this boil byitself; as soon as it doth so, put to this half a pound of sweet butter, let it melt gently, or suddenly, it imports not, so as the liquorboiled,whenyou did put thebutter in; when the butter is melted, then take it from the fire, and holding the handle in your hand, shake it round a goodwhileandstrongly,anditwill come to be thick, that you may almost cut it with a Knife. Then squeese juyce of Limon into it, or of sharp Orange, or Verjuyce or Vinegar ; and heat it again as much as you please upon the fire. It will ever after con- tinue thick,and never again,upon any heating,grow oily, though it be cold and heated again twenty times. Butter done with fair water, as is said above, with the otherLiquor,will bethickinthe sameman- ner, (for the liquors make no difference in that:) Put of this butter to boiled Pease in their dish, which cover with another ; so shake them very strongly, and a good while together. This is by much the best way tobutter pease,and not to let the buttermeltin themiddle of them,and thenstirthem long with a spoon. This will grow Oily (though it be good at the first doing) if you heat them again : The other, never; and therefore, is the best way up- on all occasions to make such thickened melted Butter. You may make sauce for a Pike in thesame manner you did for aCarpe; putting Horse-radish to it if you please. A HERRING-PYE Put great store of sliced Onions, with Currants and Raisins of the Sun both above and under the Herrings, and store of Butter, and so bake them.

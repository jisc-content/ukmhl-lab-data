*39 THE CLOSET OPENED AN EXCELLENT AND WHOLESOME WATER-GRUEL WITH WOOD-SORREL AND CURRANTS Into a Possnet of two quarts of water, besides the due proportion of beaten Oat-meal, put two hand- fuls of Wood-sorrel a little-chopped and bruised, and a good quantity of picked and washed currants, tyed loosly in a thin stuff bag (as a bolter cloth). Boil these very well together, seasoning the Com- position in due time, with Salt, Nutmeg, Mace, or what else you please, as Rosemary &c. when it is sufficiently boiled, strain the Oat-meal, and press out all the juyce and humidity of the Currants and Herbs, throwing away the insipid husks ; and sea- son it with Sugar and Butter; and to each Por- renger-ful two spoonfuls of Rhenish-wine and the yolk of an Egg. THE QUEENS BARLEY-CREAM You must make a good barley-water,throwingaway the three first waters as soon as they boil; which will take up about three quarters of an hour. Then you boil a large quantity of water with the Barley (which thus prepared makes the water no more Red or Russet) during an hours space or more; (that it may be strong of the Barley ; perle-Barley is best,) towards the latter end put in the Pullet flead, and thelegs cut off; If itshould boil too long, the emul- sion would taste too fleshy. When it is enough, let the broth run clear from the Barley and pullet, and beat the Almonds with the broth, and strain them from it. Then sweeten it with Sugar. This is to make at least two English quarts of Emulsion.

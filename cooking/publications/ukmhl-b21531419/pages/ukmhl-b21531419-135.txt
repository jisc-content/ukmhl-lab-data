Then tun it in a vessel; and draw it into bottles,afterit is sufficiently settled. Whitesof Eggs with the shells beaten together,do clarifieMeath best. If you will have your Meath cooling, use Violet and Straw-berry-leaves, Agrimony, Eglantine and the like: adding Borage and Bugloss,and a little Rose- mary and Sweet-Marjoram to give it Vigor.

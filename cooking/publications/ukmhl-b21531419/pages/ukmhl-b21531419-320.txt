SIR KENELME DIGBIE 258 judge fit, after having done it once ; The Doctors Apothecary takes two pints) of Spring water ; till the water have drawn out all the Tincture of the Roses into it self, and that the leaves be very ten- der, and look pale like Linnen ; which may be in a good half hour, oran hour,keeping the pot covered whiles it boileth. Then pour the tincted Liquor from the pale Leaves (strain it out, pressing it gently,so that you may have Liquor enough to dis- solve your Sugar) and set it upon the fire by it self to boil, putting into it a pound of pure double re- fined Sugar in small Powder ; which as soon as it is dissolved, put in a second pound ; then a third, lastlyafourth, so that you have four poundof Sugar to every pound of Rose-leaves. (The Apothecary useth to put all the four pounds into the Liquor altogether at once,) Boil thesefour poundsof Sugar with the tincted Liquor,till it be a high Syrup, very near a candy height, (as high as it can be, not to flake or candy) Then put the pale Rose-leaves, into this high Syrup, as it yet standeth upon the fire, or immediately upon the taking it off the fire. But presently take it from the fire,and stir them exceed- ing well together, to mix them uniformly ; then let them stand till they be cold ; then pot them up. If you put up your Conserve into pots, whiles it is yet throughly warm, and leave them uncovered some days, putting them in the hot Sun or stove, there will grow a fine candy upon the top, which will preserve the conserve without paper upon it, from moulding, till you break the candied crust, to take out some of the conserve.

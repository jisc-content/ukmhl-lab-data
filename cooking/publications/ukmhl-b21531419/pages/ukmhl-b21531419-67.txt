5 A RECEIPT TO MAKE METHEGL1N AS IT IS MADE AT LIEGE, COMMUNICAT- ED BY MR. MASILLON Take one Measure of Honey, and three Measures of Water, and let it boil till one measure be boiled away, so that there be left three measures in all ; as for Example, take to one Pot of Honey, three Pots of Water, and let it boil so long, till it come to three Pots. During which time you must Skim it very well as soon as any scum riseth ; which you are to continue till there rise no scum more. You may, if you please, put to it some spice, to wit, Cloves and Ginger ; the quantity of which is to be proportioned according as you will have your Meath, strong or weak.

But this is not necessary at all ; and much less to set it into the Sun. Mr. Masillon doth neither the one nor the other. Afterwards for to Tun it, you must let it grow Luke-warm, for to advance it. And if you do intend to keep your Meathe a long time, you may put into it some hopps on this fashion. Take to every Bar- rel of Meathe a Pound of Hops without leaves, that is, of Ordinary Hops used for Beer, but well cleansed, taking only the Flowers, without the Green-leaves and stalks. Boil this pound of Hops in a Pot and half of fair water, till it come to one Pot, and this quantity is sufficient for a Barrel of Meathe. A Barrel at Liege holdeth ninety Pots,

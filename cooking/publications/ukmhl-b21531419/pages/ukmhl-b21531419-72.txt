IO SIR KENELMS DIGBIS TO MAKE EXCELLENT MEATHE To every quart of Honey, take four quarts of water. Put your water in a clean Kettle over the fire, and with a stick take the just measure, how high the water cometh, making a notch, where the superficies toucheth the stick. As soon as the water is warm, put in your Honey, and let it boil, skiming it always, till it be very clean ; Then put to every Gallon of water, one pound of the best Blew-raisins of the Sun, first clean picked from the stalks, and clean washed. Let them remain in the boiling Liquor, till they be throughly swollen and soft; Then take them out, and put them into a Hair-bag, and strain all the juice and pulp and substance from them in an Apothe- caries Press ; which put back into your liquor, and let it boil, till it be consumed just to the notch you took at first, for the measure of your water alone. Then let your Liquor run through a Hair-strainer into an empty Woodden- fat, which must stand endwise, with the head of the upper-end out ; and there let it remain till the next day, that the liquor be quite cold. Then Tun it up into a good Barrel, not filled quite full, but within three or four fingers breadth ; (where Sack hath been, is the best) and let the bung remain open for six weeks with a double bolter- cloth lying upon it, to keep out any foulness from falling in. Then stop it up close, and drink not of it till after nine months. This Meathe is singularly good for a Consump- tion, Stone, Gravel, Weak-sight, and many more

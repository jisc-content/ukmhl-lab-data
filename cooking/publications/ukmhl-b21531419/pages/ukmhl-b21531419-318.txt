Boil them together a little while, till it be well scummed, and enough to become gelly. Then put a good handful or two of the berries of Currants whole, and cleansed from the stalks and blackends,and boil them a little till they be enough. You need not to boil the juyce, before you put it to the Sugar, and consequently do not scum it be- fore the Sugar and it boil together : but then scum it perfectly : and take care before, that the juyce be very clear and well strained. MARMULATE OF RED CURRANTS Take some juyce of red Currants, and put into it a convenient proportion of some entire Currants cleansed from the stalks and buttonsat theother end. Let these boil a little together. Have also ready some fine Sugar boiled to a candy height. Put of this to the Currants at discretion, and boil them to- gether, till they be enough : and bruise them with the back of your spoon, that they maybe in the con- sistence of Marmulate (like thatof Cherries) which put in pots, when it is cool enough. You do not stone the whole Currants put into the juyce, unless you please.

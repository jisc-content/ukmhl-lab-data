THE CLOSET OPENED 245 with gelly, when it is first half filled with Marmu- late a little cooled. PRESERVED QUINCE WITH GELLY W hen I made Quinces with Gelly, I used the first time these proportions ; of the decoction of Quin- ces three pound ; of Sugar one pound three quar- ters ; Flesh of Quince two pound and an half; The second time these, of decoction two pound and an half, Sugar two pound and a quarter, Of flesh two pound three quarters. 1 made the decoc- tion by boyling gently each time a dozen or four- teen Quinces in a Pottle of water, an hour and a half, or two hours, so that the decoction was very strong of the Quinces. I boiled the parings (which for that end were pared very thick, after the Quin- ces were well wiped) with all the substance of the Quince in thick slices, and part of the Core (ex- cepting all the Kernels) and then let it run through a loose Napkin, pressing gently with two plates, that all the decoction might come out; but be clear without any flesh or mash. The first making I in- tended should be red ; and therefore both the de- coction, and the whole were boiled covered, and it proved a fine clear red. This boiled above an hour, when all was in. The other boiled not above half an hour, always uncovered (as also in making his decoction) and the Gelly was of a fine pale yellow. I first did put the Sugar upon the fire with the de- coction, and as soon as it was dissolved, I put in the flesh in quarters and halves ; and turned the pieces often in the pan ; else the bottom of such as lay long unturned, would be of a deeper colour

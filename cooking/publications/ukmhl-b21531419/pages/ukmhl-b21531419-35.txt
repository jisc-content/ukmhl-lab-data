In 1651 Evelyn was visiting him there, and being stirred by his enthusiasm into attending Febur’s chemistry lectures along with him. Before that must have taken place his pilgrimage to Des- cartes, who died in 1650. Apparently Sir Kenelm had gone to Egmont as an unknown stranger; and it throws light on his wide reputation as a man of ideas and a conversationalist, that into his torrent of questions and speculation Descartes brokewith, “ You can be none other than Digby.” The Eng- lish scientist’s practical mind—for he had always a practicalend in view, however fantastichis methods —showed itself in his counsel to the author of the Discours sur la Mtthode.

SIR KENELM8 DIGBIS 154 ing liquor to eat with bread, and the Capon will be short, tender, most savoury and full of juyce, and very nourishing. I conceive, that if you put enough Ox-marrow, you need no butter ; and that it may do well to add Ambergreece, Dates-sliced and pithed, Raisins, Currants, and a little Sugar. Peradventure this might be done well in a Silver- flagon close luted, set in Balneo bulliente, as I make the nourishing broth or gelly of Mutton or Chic- kens &c. AN â€™EXCELLENT BAKED PUDDING Slice thin two peny-roles, or one, of French-bread, the tender part. Lay it in a dish or pan. Pour upon it a quart of Cream, that hath been well boiled. Let it stand almost half an hour, till it be almost cold. Then stir the bread and Cream very well together, till the bread be well broken and Incorporated. (If you have no French bread, take stale Kingston bread, grated) add to this two spoonfuls of fine Wheat-flower, the yolks of four Eggs, and the whites of two ; a Nutmeg-grated small; Sugar to your tast; a little Salt, and the Marrow of two bones a little shreded. Stir all these together ; then pour it into a dish greased over with Butter, and set it uncovered in the Oven to bake. About half an hour will serve, and give the top a yellow crispiness. Before you put in the Marrow, put in a quarter of a pound and a half of Raisins of the Sun, and as much of Currants; Ordering them so, that they may not fall to the bottom, but be all about the pud- ding.

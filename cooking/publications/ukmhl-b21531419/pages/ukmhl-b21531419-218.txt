156 SIR KENELME DIGBIE well here. A pound of flesh, and proportionally of all things else, is enough for once in a large family. ANOTHERWAYOFMAKINGEXCELLENT MINCED PYES OF MY LADY PORTLANDS Parboil Neats-tongues. Then Peel and hash them with as much as they weigh of Beef-suet, and stoned Raisins and picked Currants. Chop all exceeding small, that it be like Pap. Employ therein at least an hour more, then ordinarily is used. Then mingle a very little Sugar with them, and a little wine, and thrust in up and down some thin slices of green Candyed Citron-peel. And put this into coffins of fine light well reared crust. Half an hour baking will be enough. If you strew a few Carvi comfits on the top, it will not be amiss. MINCED PYES My Lady Lasson makes her finest minced Pyes of Neats-tongues; But she holdeth the most savoury ones to be of Veal and Mutton equal parts very small minced. Her finest crust is made by sprinkling the flower (as much as it needeth) with cold water, and then working the past with little pieces of raw Butter in good quantity. So that she useth neither hot water, nor melted butter in them ; And this makes the crust short and light. After all the meat and seasoning, and Plums and Citron Peel, &c. is in the Coffin, she puts a little Ambered-sugar upon it, thus ; Grind much two grains of Ambergreece and half a one of Musk, with a little piece of hard loaf Sugar. This will serve sixor eight pyes, strewed all over the top. Then cover it with the Liddle, and set it in the oven.

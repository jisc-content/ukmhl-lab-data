SIR KE NELMS DIG BIS 128 Sorrel, Purslane, Borage and Bugloss, or what other pot-herbs you like. But green herbs do rob the strength and vigor and Cream of the Potage. The Queenâ€™s ordinary Bouillon de sante in a morning was thus. A Hen, a handful of Parsley, a sprig of Thyme, three of Spear-minth, a little balm, half a great Onion, a little Pepper and Salt, and a Clove, as much water as would cover the Hen ; and this boiled to less then a pint, for one good Porren- ger full. NOURISSANT POTAGE DE SANTE Fill a large earthen pot with water, and make it boil; then take out half the water, and put in Beef and Mutton (fit pieces) and boil and skim : and as soon as it boils, season it with Salt and Pepper. After an hour and half, or two hours, put in a Capon, and four or five Cloves ; when it is within a good half hour of being boiled enough, put in such herbs, as you intend, as Sorrel, Lettice, Purslane, Borage and Bugloss, or Green-pease ; and in the Winter, Parsley-roots and White-endive, or Na- vets, &c. so pour the broth upon tosted light bread, and let it stew a while in the dish covered. You should never put in fresh water. And if you should through the consuming of the water by long boiling, it must be boiling hot. The less broth re- mains, the better is the Potage, were it but a Por- renger full, so that it would be stiff gelly when it is cold. It is good to put into the water, at the first, a whole Onion or two ; and if you will, a spoonful of well-beaten orge monde, or bottom crust of bread, or some of the bottom of a Venison Pasty.

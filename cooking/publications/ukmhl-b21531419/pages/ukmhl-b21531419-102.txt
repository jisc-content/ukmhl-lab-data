SIR KE NELMS DIGBIS 4o about too good handfuls of all together, to ten Gal- lons. When it hath boiled enough to take the ver- tue of the herbs, skim them out, and strew a hand- ful or two of fine Wheat-flower upon the boyling Liquor. This will draw all the dregs to it, and swim at the top, so that you may skim all off together. And this she holdeth the best way of clarifying the Li- quor, and making it look pale. Then pour it into vessels as above to cool. Let it stand three days ; then Tun it up into a Sack cask without yest or Spice, and keep it stopped till it work. Then let it be open, till it have done working, filling it up still with other honey-drink. Then stop it up close for a year or two. You may at first stop it so, that the strong working may throw out the stopple, and yet keep it close, till it work strongly. She saith, that such a small proportion of wormwood giveth it a fine quick tast, and a pale colour with an eye of green. The wormwood must not be so much, as to discern any the least bitterness in the taste ; but that the composition of it with the honey may give a quickness. The Rosemary and Sage must be a great deal less then the Wormwood. Sometimes she stoppeth it up close as soon as she hath Tunned it, and lets it remain so for three moneths. Then pierce it and draw it into bottles, which stop well, and tie down the stoppels. This will keep so a long time. She useth this way most. It makes the Mead drink exceeding quick and pleasant. When you pierce the Cask,it will flie outwith exceeding force, and be ready to throw out the stopper and spigot.

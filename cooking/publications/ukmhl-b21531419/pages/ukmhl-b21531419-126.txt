Then take six Nutmegs, six fair Races of Ginger, a quarter of an Ounce of Cloves, half an Ounce of Cinamon ; bruise all these together, and put them into a Linnen-bag, with a little Pebble-stone to make it sink. Then hang it in the vessel. You may adde to it, if you please, two grains of Amber-greece, and one grain of Musk. Stop the vessel with a Cork, but not too close, for six days ; then taste it : and if it taste enough of the Spice, then take out the bag; if not,let the bag hang in it, and stop it very close, and meddle with it no more. It will be ready to drink in nine orten weeks. A RECEIPT TO MAKE GOOD MEATH Take as many Gallons of water, as you intend to make of Meath ; and to every Gallon put a quart of honey,and let it boil till it bear an Egg. To every Gallon you allow the white of an Egg, which white you must remove and break with your hands, and put into the Kettle, before you put it over the fire. Before itboileth, there will arise a skum, which must be taken off very clean, as it riseth. Put to every Gallon two Nutmegs sliced, and when it hath boiled enough, take it off,and set it a cooling in clean wort- vessels : And when it is as cold as wort, put in a little barm, and work it like Beer, and when it hath done working, stop it up, and let it stand two months.

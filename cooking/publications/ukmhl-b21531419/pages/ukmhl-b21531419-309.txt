THE CLOSET OPESjED 247 or five hours in a cold place, till it be quite cold. Then reverse the plates, that it may shale and fall out, and so put the parcels up in boxes. Note, you take fountain water, and put the Quinces into it, both of them being cold. Then set your Kettle to boil with a very quick-fire, that giveth a clear smart flame to the bottom of the Kettle, which must be uncovered all the while, that the gelly may prove the whiter ; And so likewise it must be whiles the juyce or expression is boiling with theSugar,whichmustbe the finest,that it may not need clarifying with an Egg ; but that little scum that riseth at the sides at the beginning of moderate boiling must be scummed away. Youlet your juyce or expression settle a while, that if any of the thick substance be come out with it, it may settle to the bottom ; for you are to use for this only the clear juyce : which to have it the clearer, you may let it run through a large, thin, open, strainer, without pressing it. When you boil the whole Quinces, you take them out, to strain them as soon as their skins crack, and that they are quite soft; which will not happen to them all at the same time, but according to their bigness and ripeness. Therefore first take out and press those, that are ready first: and the rest still as they grow to a fit state to press. You shall have more juyce by pres- sing the Quinces in a torcular, but it will be clearer, doing it with your hands ; both ways, you lap them in a strainer.

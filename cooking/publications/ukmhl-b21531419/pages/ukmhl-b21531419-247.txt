Then put more Butter upon them, covering the pot with a fit cover, and so set them into a quick oven, that is strongly heated ; where they will require three or four hours (at least) baking. When they are taken out of the oven and begin to cool, pour store of melted Butter upon them, to fill up the pot at least three fingers breadth above the fish, and then let it cool and harden ; And thus it will keep a year, if need be, so the Butter be not opened, nor craked, that the air get into the fish.

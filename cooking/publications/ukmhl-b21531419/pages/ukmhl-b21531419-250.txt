188 SIR KENELME DIGBIE put it to fry with Onions. If you put it first intohot water (as ling and such salt fish,) or being boiled, if you let it cool, and heat it again it will be tough and hard. Buckorneis to be watered a goodhourbefore you put ittothe fire. Then boil it till it be tender, which it will be quickly. Then Butter it as you do Ling ; and if you will, put Eggs to it. THE WAY OF DRESSING STOCK-FISH IN HOLLAND First beat it exceedingly well, a long time, but with moderate blows, that you do not break it in pieces, but that you shake and loosen all the inward Fibers. Then put it into water(which maybealittle warmed) to soak, and infuse so during twelve or fourteen hours (or more, if it be notyet pierced into the heart by the water, and grown tender.) Then put it to boil very gently, (and with no more water, then well to cover it, which you must supply with new hot water as it consumeth) for six or seven hours at least, that it may be very tender and loose and swelled up. Then press and drain out all the water from it; and heat it again in a dish,with store of melted Butter thickened ; and if you like it, you may season it also with Pepper and Mustard. But it will be yet better, if after it is well and tender boiled in water, and that you have pressed all the water you can out of it, you boil it again an hour longer in Milk ; out of which when you take it, to putit into the dish with butter,you do not industri- ously press out all the Milk, as you did the water, but only drain it out gently,pressing it moderately.

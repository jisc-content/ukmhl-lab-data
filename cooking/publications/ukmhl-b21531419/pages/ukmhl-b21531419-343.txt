QUOTES 281 “My worthy Master, that Incomperable “Sir Kenelm Digby, being a great lover “of this Drink, was so curious in his “ Researches, that he made a large Col- lection of the choicest & best Receipts “ thereof.” Hartman, Select Receipts, p. I. Concerning the difference between Mead and Metheglin, Borde (Regyment of Helth) says:— “Of Meade: Meade is made of honny & “water boyled both togyther; yf it be “fyred and pure, it preserveth helth; “but it is not good for them the whiche “have the Ilyache or the Colycke. “ Of Metheglyn: Metheglyn is made of honny “and water, & herbes, boyled and sod- “den togyther: yf it be fyred and stale, “it is better in the regyment of helth “than meade.” But the distinction seems to have been for- gotten in the hundred odd years between the publication of Borde’s book and Digby’s.

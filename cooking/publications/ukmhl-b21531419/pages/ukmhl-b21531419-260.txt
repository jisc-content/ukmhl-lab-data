SIR KENELMS DIGBIS 198 &c.) and a good large Onion peeled, and stuck as close with Cloves, as you can stick it, if you like the tasteof Onions. Theymust be the strong biting Onions, that are round and red : a little Nutmeg, and some Mace. Put to the wine about a pint of the Liquor that you have already boiled the Beef in ; and if you would have it strong of the season- ing of Pepper, and Salt ; take the bottom of this Liquor.

SIR KENELMS DIGBIS 5Â° last very well half a year drawing. But if you stay broaching it a year, and then draw it into bottles, it will keepadmirable good three or fouryears,grow- ing to be much better, then when broached at six months end. It will be purer, if you first boil the water by it self,then let it settle24 hours; and pour the clear from the earthy sediment, which will be great, and dissolve your honey in that. You may Aromatise it with Ambergreece or Musk, or both (if you like them) by dissolving a very few Pastils in a Runlet of this Liquor, when you draw it into little vessels, (as He useth to do after five or six moneths) or with a few drops of the Extract of them. This Metheglin is a great Balsom and strengthener of the Viscera; is excellent in colds and coughs and consumptions. For which last they use to burn it (like wine) or rather onely heat it. Then dissolve the yolk of an Egge or two in a Pint of it, and some fresh Butter, and drink it warm in the morning fasting. As it comes from the Barrel or Bottle, it is used to be drunk a large draught (without any alteration or admixtion, with a toste early in the morning (eating the toste) when they intend to dine late. Consider of making Metheg- lin thus with purified rain water (of the Mquinoxe) or Dew. The handfuls of Herbs, are natural large hand- fuls (as much as you can take up in your hand) not Apothecaries handfuls, which are much less. If a pottleof Barm do not make itwork enough to your mind, you may put in a little more. Discretion and Experience must regulate that.

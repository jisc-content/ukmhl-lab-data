io6 SIR KENELMS DIG BIS is much the better ; because the former Ale tasted a little Raw. Now because itconsumesin boiling, and would be too strong, if this Malt made a less pro- portion of Ale; I have added a Gallon of water at the first, taking fifteen Gallons instead of fourteen. Since I have added half a peck of Malt to theformer proportions, to make it a little stronger in Winter. APPLE DRINK WITH SUGAR, HONEY, &c A very pleasant drink is made of Apples, thus ; Boil sliced Apples in water, to make the water strong of Apples, as when you make to drink it for cool- ness and pleasure. Sweeten it with Sugar to your tast, such a quantity of sliced Apples, as would make so much water strong enough of Apples ; and then bottle it up close for three or four months. There will come a thick mother at the top, which being taken off, all the rest will be very clear, and quick and pleasant to the taste, beyond any Cider. It will be the better to most taste, if you put a very little Rosemary into the liquor, when you boil it, and a little Limon-peel into each bottle, when you bottle it up. TO MAKE STEPPONI Take a Gallon of Conduit-water, one pound of blew Raisins of the Sun stoned,and half a pound of Sugar. Squeese the juyce of two Limons upon the Raisins and Sugar, and slice the rindes upon them. Boil the water, and pour it so hot upon the ingredients in an earthen pot, and stir them well together. So let it stand twenty four hours. Then put it into bottles (having first let it run through a strainer) and set them in a Cellar or other cool place.

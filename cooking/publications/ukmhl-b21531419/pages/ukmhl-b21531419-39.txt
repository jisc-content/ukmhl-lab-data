INTRODUCTION xxxiii inaugurated, in 1663, he was one of the Council. His house became a kind of academy, where wits, experimentalists, occultists, philosophers, and men ot letters worked and talked. This was the house in Covent Garden. An earlier one is also noted by Aubrey. “ The faire howses in Holbournebetween King’s Street and Southampton Street (which brake-off the continuance of them) were, about 1633, built by Sir Kenelme ; where he lived before the civill warres. Si nee the restauration of Charles 11 he lived in the last faire house westward in the north portico of Covent Garden, where my lord Denzill Hollis lived since. He had a laboratory there.” This latter house, which can be seen in its eighteenth-century guise in Hogarth’s print of “ Morning,” in The Four Hours of the Day set, is now the quarters of the National Sporting Club. There he worked and talked and entertained, made his metheglin and aqua vita and other messes, till his last illness in 1665. Paris as ever attracted him; and in France were good doctors for his disease, the stone. He had himself borne on a litter to the coast; but feeling death’s hand on him, he turned his face homeward again, and died in Covent Gar- den, June 11, 1665. In his will he desired to be buried by his beautiful Venetia in Christ Church, Newgate, and that no mention should be made of him on the tomb, where he had engraved fourLatin inscriptions to her memory. But Ferrar wrote an epitaph for him :— “ Under this tomb the matchless Digby lies, Digby the great, the valiant, and the wise,” etc.

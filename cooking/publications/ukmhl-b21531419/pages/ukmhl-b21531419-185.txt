THE CLOSET OPENED 123 well to put into the pot, at first, twenty or thirty corns of whole Pepper. POTAGE DE BLANC DE CHAPON Make first a very good bouillon, seasoned as you like. Put someof it upon the white fleshofaCapon or Hen a little more than half-rosted. Beat them well in a Mortar, and strain out all the juyce that will come. You may put more broth upon what re- mains in the strainer, and beat again, and strain it to the former. Whiles this is doing, put some of your first plain broth upon some dryed bread to mittonner well. Let there be no more broth, then just to do that. None to swim thin over. When you will serve the potage in, pour the white liquor upon the swelled and gellied-bread, and let them stew to- gether a little upon the Coals. When it is through hot, take it off, and squeese some limon or orange into it, and so send it in presently. It mendeth a Bouillon much, to boil in it some half-rosted Vo- laille, or other good meat. TO MAKE SPINAGE-BROTH Take strong broth, and boil a neck of Mutton, and a Marrow-bone in it, and skim it very well ; then put in half a pound of French barley, and a bundle of sweet herbs, and two or three blades of Large- mace. Let these boil very well. Then mince half a peck of Spinage, and two great Onions very small, and let it boil one hour or more ; season it with salt as you please, and send the Mutton and the Mar- row-bone in a dish with French bread or Manchet to the Table.

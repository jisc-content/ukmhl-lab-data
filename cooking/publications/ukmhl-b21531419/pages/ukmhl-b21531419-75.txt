13 THE CLOSET OPENED from filth and grass : Then put your field herbs first into the bottom of a clean Furnace, and lay all your Garden-herbs thereon ; then fill your Furnace with clean water, letting your herbs seeth, till they be so tender, that you may easily slip off the skin of your Field-herbs, and that you may break the roots of your Garden-herbs between your Fingers. Then lade forth your Liquor, and set it a cooling. Then fill your Fur- nace again with clear water to these Herbs, and let them boil a quarter of an hour. Then put it to your first Liquor, filling the Furnace, until you have sufficient to fill your Tun. Then as your Liquor begins to cool, and is almost cold, set your servants to temper Honey and wax in it, Combs and all, and let them temper it well together, breaking the Combes very small ; let their hands and nails be very clean ; and when you have tempered it very well together, cleanse it through a cleansing sieve into another clean vessel ; The more Honey you have in your Liquor, the stronger it will be. Therefore to know, when it is strong enough, take two New- laid eggs, when you begin to cleanse, and put them in whole into the bottome of your cleansed Liquor ; And if it be strong enough, it will cause the Egge to ascend upward, and to be on the top as broad as sixpence ; if they do not swim on the top ; put more.

Letit remain boiling, whilesyour Pulse beateth two hundred stroaks. Then take it out immediately, and you will find it of an exact temper: others put Eggs into boyling water just as you take it from the fire,and let them remain there, till the water be so cooled, that you may just put in your hand, and take out the Eggs. Others put the Eggs into cold water, which they set upon the fire, and as soon as the water begins to boil, the Eggs are enough.

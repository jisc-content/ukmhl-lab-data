RUSSIAN, POLISH, AND SIBERIAN 6i Chicken Cutlets a la Poskari. (Russian) Take a chicken, roast it, let it get cold, then chop it very fine with slices of bread and eggs served up in the shape of a cutlet with brown chaudfroid sauce ; fill the centre with small glazed truffles, and jelly croutons round. Kissel of Currants Take three pounds (six tumblerfuls) of fresh currants crushed and pressed through a sieve, as much water as currant juice, six teaspoonfuls (one tumblerful) of potato flour. Put into a metal basin, and steam in the oven and let it boil. Add loaf sugar to taste and stir constantly, stirring till the kissel thickens ; then pour into china moulds and serve hot or cold with cream or sugar. Koulbac or Coulebraka Take three pounds of flour and half a tumbler- ful of warm milk, half an ounce of yeast, and put in as much flour as the milk will absorb; when risen add the remainder of the flour, one pound of butter, six eggs, and a little salt. Boil two pounds of rice in butter, put into it some chopped mush- rooms, pepper and salt, boil six eggs hard and cut them into slices, with any cold remains of boiled fish also cut in slices ; roll a layer of pastry on a buttered metal dish, and put the rice on to thin slices of fish and eggs, then rice again and then another layer of eggs ; put breadcrumbs on the top, and bake in the oven.

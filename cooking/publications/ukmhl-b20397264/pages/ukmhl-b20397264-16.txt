NATIONAL VIANDS 4 Clam Fritters (' Boston Cook Book') Take fifty large or twenty-five small clams ; if large, cut each into two ; lay them on a thickly- folded napkin. Put a pint bowl of wheat flour into a basin, add to it two well-beaten eggs, half a pint of sweet milk, and nearly as much of the liquor of the clams ; beat the butter until it is smooth and perfectly free from lumps, then stir in the clams. Put plenty of lard or beef fat into a thick-bottomed frying-pan ; let it become boiling hot, and put in the batter by the spoonful ; let the fritters fry gently ; when one side is a delicate brown turn them over and fry the other side the same ; serve hot. Chowder Cod Take some thin slices of fat salt pork and put them in a deep stewpan, and over these some sliced onions and mixed sweet herbs. On these flake some thin pieces of codfish and place them on the top of the pork and on that a layer of ship's biscuits soaked in milk, and fill up the saucepan with all these ingredients arranged alternately ; let it stew for four or five hours, then add pepper and salt to taste, a wineglassful of Madeira made hot, some cooked mushrooms and oysters, and let all stew for half an hour. x\dd a little minced cucumber before serving. Cocoanut Kisses Dissolve three cupfuls of granulated sugar and a pinch of cream of tartar in sufficient water.

NATIONAL VIANDS 10 Succutash. (American) Shell or string Lima beans and cut them into small pieces ; cut the green corn from the cob, using one third more corn than beans. Boil the beans for twenty minutes, then strain and mix with the corn. Cover them with boil- ing water; add sufficient salt. Stew for half an hour, stirring frequently ; then pour off the water and replace it with milk, adding butter, pepper, and salt to taste ; stew for ten minutes more and serve very hot. Slaw. (American) Get a good solid white-heart winter cabbage ; remove all the outer leaves and quarter it. Cut out the stalk and thinly slice up the heart. Stand the cut cabbage in a colander, sprinkle it freely with salt, and toss it about well. In half an hour's time hold the colander under the cold-water tap and well rinse the cabbage, and dress with any dressing which may be preferred. Fresh oysters are gene- rally eaten with it.

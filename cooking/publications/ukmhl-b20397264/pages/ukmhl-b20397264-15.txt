AMERICAN AND CANADIAN B 2 AMERICAN AND CANADIAN Beaten Biscuit. (Canadian) To one quart of sifted flour add a dessertspoon- ful of butter, the same of lard, and a teaspoonful of salt, and make it into a stiff dough with a teacupful of milk. This must be beaten with a mallet till the dough blisters are very light. The biscuits are formed with the hands into little balls, then flattened into the required thickness, stuck with a fork or pricker, and baked in a quick oven. Chowder Clam Put half a pound of fat salt pork into a frying- pan. Let it slowly fry till crisp, then put it aside ; it should not be very brown. Chop up fifty good- sized clams, three sticks of celery, four large onions, and two tablespoonfuls of parsley. Pare two quarts of potatoes and cut them into dice. Add the onions to the fat pork ; fry them for a moment till soft ; put all into a saucepan and add all the other ingredients, a pint of tinned tomatoes, a table- spoonful of thyme, a saltspoonful of pepper, a teaspoonful of salt, and two tablespoonfuls of Worcester sauce. Cover and cook slowly at the back of the fire for twenty minutes. If the chowder is too thick add sufficient water to make it of the proper consistency. When it begins to boil add twelve water crackers broken into small pieces, and stir constantly for five minutes. Add five or six slices of lemon and serve.

ITALIAN made of old Cyprus wine and two other kinds, mixed together, such as Malaga and Marsala, one sweet and the other spirituous. It is made, according to Italian recipe by taking three yolks of eggs for every two guests, a spoonful of sugar to each egg, and as much wine as the eggs will use up. First mix the yolks and sugar well together ; then add the wine and put the mixture over the fire till it becomes condensed. It must not boil, and should be served very hot in glasses. Zuppa alia Romana Take some marrow from a marrow bone, and cook it over the fire in a saucepan ; then pass it through a colander. When it is cool add two eggs to it, with a piece of crumb of bread which has been soaked in soup and then pressed nearly dry, a sprig of parsley, an almond, grated cheese, and salt; reduce this to a good consistency, mix it with flour, and make it into little balls the size of a nut, which must be put into the stock to cook, throwing in a few at a time. While the stock is boiling, which only takes a few minutes, have ready some little croutons made of bread or fried butter ; put these in the soup tureen, and pour over the soup with the soaked balls.

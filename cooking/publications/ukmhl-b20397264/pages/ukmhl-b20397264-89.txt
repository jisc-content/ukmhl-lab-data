77 SWEDISH and a pinch of chopped chives, and mix all these ingredients well together ; add a few cold boiled potatoes. All should be of the consis- tency of cream, which lay smoothly on a flat dish in a dome shape, mask with mayonnaise, and cover with minced beetroot. Garnish with anchovy fillets, capers, and cherries in vinegar. Serve the salad with a sauce made of cream, vinegar, mustard, and sugar, or with oil, vinegar, and pepper. Smoked Eels Take two or three moderate-sized eels and place them in salt for a few hours ; then wipe and hang them up by some hooks by their heads, placed at a distance from each other at the bottom of an over- turned tun open on one side. Put the tun on three bricks round a half-dying fire, which keep up with small pieces of bark of resinous wood, thus con- centrating in the tun a thick warm smoke. In five or six hours the eels will be smoked and cooked. Divide them into pieces freed of the skin, place in a kitchen basin, season, and baste with oil and vinegar. Prepare a mixed salad of boiled potatoes, beetroot, celery, boiled carrots, gherkins, salted cucumber, and capers ; all these vegetables, except the capers, cut up into small pieces, seasoned and basted with oil and vinegar, and thus left for two hours. When ready to serve put these vegetables into a border mould. Turn it out on a dish ; place the pieces of eel in the centre and baste them with their seasoning.

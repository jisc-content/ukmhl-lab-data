57 ORIENTAL Quince Sambal. (Chinese, Malay) Peel and quarter three or four green quinces and pound them in a mortar with a green chilH, some sHced onion, and salt to taste. This is good to eat with roast meat. Sweet Pillau Boil one pound of Patna rice in two quarts of strong white stock, with only a pinch of salt. Watch the rice carefully ; the moment it is tender drain and steam before the fire. Now prepare a syrup flavoured with either lemon, cocoanut, musk, or rose water. Turn the rice into a dish, put a little piece of fresh butter on it, stir lightly with a fork for the butter to mix with it, then pour over the syrup ; garnish the top with fried almonds or pis- tachios and sultanas. If preferred, the rice may be coloured with a little saffron. White Indian Soup Cut up an onion into very thin rings ; fry it—in two ounces of butter with twenty-four cloves—to a delicate brown. Now add a tablespoonful of the very best curry powder; stir in one pint of water ; add it to two tablespoonfuls of pea flour that has been mixed to the consistency of cream in a little cold water ; allow it to thicken a little, and then add one pint of fresh curds, a stick of cinnamon, a blade of mace, the seeds of twelve cardamoms, two beads of garlic chopped, three bay leaves, a few leaves of tarragon and chervil ; let it simmer gently for an hour, strain through a wire sieve or tammy cloth just before serving ; put in salt to taste. The juice of a lemon is a great improvement. Serve with a separate dish of plain boiled rice.

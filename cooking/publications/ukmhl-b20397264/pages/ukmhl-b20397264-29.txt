The squash may either be put up like citron preserve in the syrup or it may be crystallised. Tomales, or Corn Rolls Boil a large chicken and flake the meat off and chop it fine ; also chop fine one pound each of raisins and olives stoned, and the pressed juice of two dozen red peppers boiled soft; mix these with two pounds of dried Indian corn. Season with salt and stir over the fire for fifteen minutes, and then add six hard boiled eggs minced finely ; mean- time, lay smooth the soft inner husks of corn and tear some strips for tying ; lay upon two of the husks as much of the tomale paste as they will contain, wrap them about it, and tie each roll with the stripped husk ; drop these rolls into boiling salted water, and boil them for an hour. When the tomales are done take narrow red and yellow ribbons in place of the strips of husk, and serve them piled upon a napkin laid on a hot dish. Salad is eaten with them.

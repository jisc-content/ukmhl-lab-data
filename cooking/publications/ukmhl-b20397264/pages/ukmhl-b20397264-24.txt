12 NATIONAL VIANDS paste. Serve warm, not hot, with a little fine sugar sprinkled over the tops. Water-Melon Rinds Pickled. (Harpur's Bazaar) Peel the rinds evenly w^ith a sharp knife ; trim off every trace of the pink flesh ; then cut the strips of rind into small pieces two or three inches long and place them in a large earthen dish ; sprinkle them lightly and evenly with salt. Cover the dish and let it stand over night; drain off the water in the morning, rinse the rinds in cold water and cook them in a steamer till a broom splint will readily pierce them. When the rinds are tender take them out carefully and put them into a stone jar. Take a quart of good cider vinegar, two pounds of sugar, half an ounce of stick cinnamon broken into inch pieces, and half a teaspoonful each of cloves and blades of mace. Boil the vinegar, sugar, and spices together quickly for half an hour, skim- ming off the froth, and pour the pickle boiling hot over the rinds. Press the rinds down under the pickle by means of a plate, fasten the cover on, and tie a cloth over the whole. These pickles will be ready for use in two weeks.

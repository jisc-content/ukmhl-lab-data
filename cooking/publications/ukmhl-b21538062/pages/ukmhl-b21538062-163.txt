Salads. 147 Mayonaise of Chicken. Cut up a cold roast chicken into small joints, and remove the skins; season them with a little pepper and salt; take a casserole shape and wet it inside with cold water, pour in aspic jelly to about the depth of an inch, and put it away to firm. Have two eggs boiled very hard, cut them in halves; take a small cutter the size of a sixpence, and cut the whites up with this cutter, then take a smaller cutter, the size of a threepenny piece, and cut out the centre of the larger pieces, thus leaving a round ring of white of egg. Cut out some pieces of black truffle with the smallest cutter, and place this piece of truffle into the ring of the white of egg, thus forming an eye. Place the eyes on the top of the jelly about an inch apart. Take a spoon and pour some aspic jelly over the eyes in the mould, remember- ing that the jelly must be cold but not set. When the aspic is again firm, place the fillets of chicken on the aspic with jelly over them about an inch deep. Take a small vegetable cutter, scoop out some boiled beet- root in the form of eggs, place these on the jelly in the shape, cover them over with aspic, and allow it to firm. Then fill with chicken and jelly alternately, and allow it to firm. Then turn it out upon its dish. Take about two or three heads of lettuce, cut away the outside leaves, using the centre portions only. Cut them up rather small, with one stalk of celery (shred very fine), and a little water-cress, with the yolks of the eggs minced, seasoned slightly with pepper and salt, mix up the salad and place it in the centre of the shape of aspic, add a little thick cream to the mayonaise sauce, pour

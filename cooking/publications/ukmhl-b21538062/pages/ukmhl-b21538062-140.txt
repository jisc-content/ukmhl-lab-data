Pies. 124 Pigeon Pie, Lay a few pieces of tender beef-steak at the bottom of a pie-dish; upon this place the halves of four pigeons; season with chopped mushrooms, parsley, shallot, pepper and salt, moisten well with gravy or water, and a table-spoonful of catsup, add the yolks of four hard-boiled eggs, cover with puff paste, bake the pie in a moderate oven for an hour-and-a-quarter. Grouse Pie. Pluck and draw two or three young grouse; cut off the wings and legs. Tuck the drumsticks in through a slit made under the thigh; singe the birds with white paper; split them in halves, season them with pepper and salt. Place some pieces of very tender beef-steak at the bottom of a pie-dish; add chopped mushrooms, parsley, and shallot, and two teaspoonfuls of chutnee sauce. Sprinkle a little of this over the pieces of steak. Place the halves of grouse in neat order on the top; add a little more seasoning; moisten with sufficient gravy made from the necks, legs, and wings of the birds. Cover with puff paste, and bake for about an hour-and-a-half. Lark Pie. Cut about one pound of veal into small collops, with half a pound of ham; fry both together slightly, and place them at the bottom of a pie-dish. Then pluck and singe two dozen larks, from which the gizzards only have been removed. Chop up some parsley, shallot, truffle, and mushrooms; put two ounces of butter in a frying-pan, and fry the larks and herbs

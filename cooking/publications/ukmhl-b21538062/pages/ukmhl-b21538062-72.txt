FISH ENTREES. Oyster Patties. To prepare oysters for patties, put fresh oysters in a pan with a small blade of mace, scald them, but do not let them boil; pick out the oysters and beard them; pour the liquor through a sieve. Put a little piece of fresh butter in a small stew-pan; add a little flour, half the weight of the butter; mix the two together, then pour in the liquor of the oysters, and boil it for a few minutes. Cut the oysters in two, add them to the sauce, season with pepper and salt, a little grated nut- meg, and a little thick, sweet cream. Make the cases very hot, then fill with the mixture; sprinkle a few fried bread crumbs on the top; put on their lids; dish them on a napkin, and serve them very hot. Frittered Oysters. Take some large, fresh oysters, dust them with a little flour, dip them in beaten egg, and roll them in fine bread crumbs; fry them in a pan, with boiling lard, to a light brown colour: three or four minutes will cook them. Pile them in the middle of an entree dish, shake fried bread crumbs on the top, and thicken their own liquor and pour it round them.

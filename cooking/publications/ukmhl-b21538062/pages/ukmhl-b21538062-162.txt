Salads. 146 separately in some cold, stiff Robert sauce, shred three or four lettuces, season them with oil, vinegar, pepper and salt, place them on the back of a sieve to drip, put them on their dish, then lay the pieces of fish on the bed of lettuces, garnish round the base of the salad with a border of hard-boiled eggs (each cut in four), and some raddishes cut in shapes and placed between each quarter of egg. Lobster Salad. Take a boiled lobster, remove all the meat from the back and claws, cut it in neat pieces about two inches in length, season them slightly with pepper, salt, and vinegar; take a casserole shape, wet it inside with cold water, pour in some dissolved aspic jelly, about an inch deep, put it upon ice or in a cool place to firm. When quite stiff, place the pieces of fish in the mould upon the jelly, put some more jelly over the fish and let it firm. Take a small tin cutter and cut out fancy shapes from truffles, lay them in the mould on the jelly and cover it over with aspic; when set, cover with lobster and aspic alternately until the mould is full. Prepare some lettuce with a little mustard and cress, season with pepper and salt. When the aspic jelly is perfectly firm, dip the shape in tepid water to loosen it round the edges, give a shake and turn it out upon its dish. Place the lettuces, mustard, and cress in the well of the casserole shape, sauce it over with mayonaise sauce without touching the aspic. Sprinkle a little of the lobster coral over the sauce, garnish round the base with a few sprigs of parsley and serve.

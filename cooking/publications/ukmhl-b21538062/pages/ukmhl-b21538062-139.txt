Pies. 123 added if liked; cover with puff paste and bake in a moderate oven from an hour to an hour-and-a-half. Veal and Ham Pie. Cut up a pound and a half of veal into collops twice the size of a crown piece, and also a pound of ham, chop a few mushrooms, some parsley, and shallot, and fry these with an ounce of butter in a small stew-pan; season with pepper and salt, a little Harvey sauce, a table-spoonful of flour, and half-a-pint of gravy or water; stir this sauce over the fire until it boils, add the juice of half a lemon, let it cool a little, and mix with the veal and ham; place hard-boiled yolks of eggs on the top, cover with puff paste, bake for an hour-and-a- quarter ; pour in a little gravy and sauce. Sheep-head Pie. Singe and clean a sheepâ€™s head and feet, lay them in cold water for one night, wash and cover them with cold water, boil for three hours and a half; take them up and allow them to cool, and reduce the liquor; strain and allow it to cool also; skim off the fat, cut off the meat from the bones of the head and feet, pare off the fat and dark skin without waste; lay a few pieces of thin-cut beef-steak at the bottom of a pie-dish; season with pepper and salt; cut the meat in nice square pieces, and pack them in the pie-dish, with a few slices of ham and two dozen of raw oysters; fill the dish, shake in a little flour, moisten well with the liquor, cover with puff paste, and bake for an hour- and-a-half.

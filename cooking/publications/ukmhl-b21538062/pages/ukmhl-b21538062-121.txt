Roast Fillet of Veal. Veal, to be in perfection, should, if possible, be pro- cured fresh killed, as it does not improve by being kept. Take out the bone from a good fat fillet, and with the bat flatten the udder; make a deep incision between the udder and the fillet with a knife, and fill it with veal stuffing. Sew it up with small twine. Wrap the udder tightly round the fillet, and secure its shape with skewers and twine. Spit the fillet in the usual manner; cover it with buttered paper; roast it for about two hours and a half. Just before it is done take off the paper, and after shaking some flour over it from a drudger, baste the fillet with a little fresh butter, and froth it; then dish it up. Pour round it some melted butter, coloured with a little browning, and lemon juice; and serve some boiled bacon with greens, separately. Loin of Veal, Brazed. Trim, stuff, and truss a loin of veal. Place it on a bed of sliced vegetables in a brazing-pan. Cover it with a fitting piece of thick white paper, previously rubbed over with butter; moisten with sufficient stock

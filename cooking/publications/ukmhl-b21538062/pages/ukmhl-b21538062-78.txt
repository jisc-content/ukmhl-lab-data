62 Fish Entrees. Pound and mix the forcemeat thoroughly; then make it up into balls about the size of a walnut, flatten them slightly to prevent them rolling, and place them in a pan with plenty of boiling water, seasoned with a little salt, and poach them for about ten minutes. Remove them from the pan, and place them on a hot, flat dish. Cover each bouch with thick white sauce. Dish them on a stand of puff-paste about half-an-inch thick; sprinkle over with a little of the lobster coral, and serve hot.

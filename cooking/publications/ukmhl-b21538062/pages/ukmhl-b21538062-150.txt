Lay the cabbages in cold water with salt; put them in a pan of boiling water with salt; boil them sharply for half an hour; drain them, and sauce them over with plain butter sauce. To Dress Beet-Root. Wash the earth off the beet-root without breaking the skin; boil it for two hours or more, according to the size of the beet-root. When cold, skin it and cut it in thin slices. Beat the yolk of an egg with a spoon- ful of vinegar, half a teaspoonful of made mustard, and a wine-glassful of cream ; pour over the beet-root. To Boil Spinach. Get a good-sized basketful of spinach, and pluck off the stalks from the leaves, which throw in cold water as thus prepared; wash them in several waters; put them into a pan with boiling water, and boil for twenty minutes; then turn them into a sieve to drain, and place them into a clean cloth and wring all the water out of them. Melt a piece of butter in a stew-pan with the spinach, and make very hot; then add half a tea- cupful of cream, pepper and salt, and a pinch of sugar; stir well together, and dish it up very hot. To Boil Asparagus. Wash the asparagus in cold water, and scrape the bottom parts a little; tie them up in bundles; let them lie in cold water. When wanted, put them in a pan of boiling water to boil for ten or fifteen minutes;

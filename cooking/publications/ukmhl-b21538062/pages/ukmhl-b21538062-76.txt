Fish Entries. 6o sauta-pan, with two spoonfuls of white sauce, and three yolks of eggs, a little nutmeg, cayenne, and anchovy. Stir this over the fire with a wooden spoon to set the egg firm in the mixture. When this is done turn the croquet meat out on a plate, and set it to cool, and finish as directed for Oyster Croquets. Note.â€”Attention must be paid to the proper time required for boiling a lobster. If it is boiled too long the flesh becomes thready and disagreeable; and if not done enough the spawn is not red through. This must be obviated by great attention. Lobster Loaf. Boil a lobster, and take off the four large claws; break the shells without bruising the meat; put the meat of the claws away on a plate. Next take all the meat from the body and small claws, pound it in the mortar with an egg, and a little fresh butter; add a little chopped parsley, pepper, and salt to taste; then butter a jelly pot of a proper size to hold the mixture; put the mixture into the jelly pot, tie a piece of white paper over it, steam it in a flat pan with a little boiling water, put the lid close on the pan and steam for half an hour. While the loaf is steaming take a small sauta-pan, and pour in a little clear brown stock, thicken with a little arrowroot, season with a tea- spoonful of vinegar, pepper and salt to taste; then place the meat of the claws into the pan with the sauce, put the lid on the pan, stew very slowly for ten minutes, when the entree is to be served; turn out the loaf on the middle of the dish, put the claws round

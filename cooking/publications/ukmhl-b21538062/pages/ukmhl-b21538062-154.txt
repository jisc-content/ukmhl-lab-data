Cover the birds with thin slices of raw bacon, tied on with string. Spit them, and roast them before a clear fire for about half an hour, frequently basting them with butter. Place some toasted bread under the birds while they are roasting, to receive the droppings from the trail; and when they are done, dish them up with a piece of toast under each bird. Serve plain butter sauce separately in a sauce-boat. Roast Larks. Cut off the heads and legs, and take out gizzards. Season their insides with chopped parsley, pepper and salt, and the grating of a nutmeg. Rub the larks over with beaten yolks of eggs; bread-crumb them, and moisten them with clarified butter. Roll them in bread-crumbs a second time; put them on a lark-spit, and tie it on a common spit, and roast for a quarter of an hour. Dish them, and serve with fried bread- crumbs and brown sauce, seasoned with cayenne pepper and lemon juice. Pea-Hens. These birds must be trussed in the same way as pheasants, and must be closely larded all over the breast, and roasted before a moderate fire for an hour and a half, frequently basted with butter; and when done the larding must be glazed slightly, and the birds dished up with rich brown gravy, and garnished with water-cresses, and bread sauce served in a sauce-boat.

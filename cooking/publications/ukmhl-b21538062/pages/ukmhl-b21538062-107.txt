POULTRY* To Roast a Turkey. Have a young fat turkey; pick, singe, and rub it well with a dry cloth. Cut off the head by the shoulders, leaving the front skin of the neck long. Cut off the points of the toes, and put the legs in the fire for a minute, and take the upper skin off them, then draw the fowl, taking care not to break the gall or the gut. If properly done it will not require to be washed. Put a little pepper and salt into the inside, and put the vent over the rump. Have a stuffing ready and put it in where the crop was taken out, sew it up, and put a large skewer through the wing, the under side of the thigh and the body, to the thigh and wing of the other side. Press down the legs and put another skewer through them, down the side of the vent. Have a piece of tape; put it firmly round the turkey, and fasten it on the point of each of the skewers to keep the skin of the bird from giving way. Fix a piece of paper over the breast of the turkey, roast it for an hour and a half. Baste it well while it is roasting; when about done, drudge it with flour, baste it with butter; dish and garnish with sausages, pour gravy round it, and serve bread sauce in a sauce tureen.

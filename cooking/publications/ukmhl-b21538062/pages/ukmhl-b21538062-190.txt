174 Puddings. Cabinet Pudding. Butter the inside of a mould slightly, ornament the bottom and sides with dried cherries or raisins. Fill the mould with cut sponge-cakes, and ratafia biscuits. Then fill up the mould with a cold custard, made with six eggs, and a pint of boiled milk, with five ounces of sugar, a glassful of brandy, and a little lemon juice, all mixed together. Steam the pudding for an hour, and serve with wine sauce. College Puddings. Put sugar and butter, to the weight of two eggs, into a basin. Beat it to a cream, drop in the eggs one at a time. Beat five minutes between each. Mix in the same weight of flour, a few currants, and a table-spoonful of sherry wine. Butter the insides of small pans and dust them with pounded sugar. Fill them three parts full. Place them upon a baking sheet, and put them in the oven to bake for twenty minutes or half an hour. When done, dish them and pour wine sauce round them. Note.â€”These puddings may be eaten cold. The mixture may be put in a basin and steamed instead of baked. Custard Pudding. Beat up six eggs with four ounces of sugar. Boil one pint of milk with a stick of cinnamon, or two bay leaves; when it boils, remove the cinnamon or bay leaves, and pour the milk among the eggs, stirring them all the time. Butter the inside of a pudding-dish slightly, and pour in the custard. Bake for half an hour.

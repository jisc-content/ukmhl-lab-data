165 Savouries. of fresh butter, the yolks of three eggs, a small piece of glaze, some lemon juice, nutmeg, and pepper and salt. Stir it over the fire until well mixed, without boiling. Pour it over the cauliflowers, and cover with bread-crumbs and grated parmesan cheese. Place them in the oven for about a quarter of an hour. When they are a nice yellow colour dish them, and garnish round with toasted bread cut in small diamonds. Large Truffles. Cleanse the truffles by brushing in water. Drain and place them in a stew-pan; pour some Italian sauce on them; place â€¢ some pieces of bacon on the top, and set them to boil on a slow fire for about three-quarters of an hour. Then dish them on a folded napkin. Send sauce separately in a sauce-boat. Mix a gill of the finest salad oil with a table-spoonful of chopped parsley, the juice of a lemon, pepper and salt, and two table-spoonfuls of the sauce that the truffles were boiled in, skimmed and boiled down to half glaze. Souffle Potatoes. Take six or more potatoes of a size; wash them with a brush in cold water, and dry them with a cloth. Bake them in the oven until they are quite soft. Cut a small piece off the tops of the potatoes, and with a teaspoon scoop out all the inside of the potatoes, leaving the skin quite whole. Put the pulp into a pan with a piece of butter, a little cream, and pepper and salt. Beat well with a fork; fill the skins; put the tops on; and put them back in the oven for ten minutes. Then dish them on a napkin, and serve hot.

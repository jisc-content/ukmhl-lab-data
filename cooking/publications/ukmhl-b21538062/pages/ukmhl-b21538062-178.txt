Savouries. 162 Canapees of Ancliovy. Toast or fry some squares of bread, butter them slightly, and spread with anchovy paste. Cut up small some lettuces or mustard and cress, boil two eggs hard, pass the yolks through a wire sieve, chop up small the whites and put them upon the toast. Make them all different by putting a little yolk, then the cress, and then the chopped whites by the side of each other in strips, and dish them on a napkin and serve them cold. Cream Cheese Fritters. Whisk a quarter of a pint of cream, add the yolks of four eggs previously well beaten, six ounces of grated parmesan cheese, a pinch of sugar and cayenne pepper. Mix well together, and put the mixture into patty- pans and steam for ten minutes. Turn them out of the pans, and cut them out with a round cutter; then egg and bread-crumb them, and fry in hot lard to a pale brown colour. Then dish them on a napkin and serve hot. Macaroni Cheese. Soak six ounces of macaroni in cold water for one hour; pour off the water and boil it in a quart and a- half of sweet milk, stir it occasionally to prevent the milk from burning. When the macaroni is very soft and milky, mix in lightly three ounces of mild cheese ; spread it on a flat dish, and sprinkle brown bread- crumbs over the top; brown it with a hot salamander or before a clear fire, and serve it very hot to be eaten with mustard.

To Roast a Pheasant. Pluck, and singe the bird with white lighted paper. Cut a slit in the back part of the neck and remove the crop ; leave the head attached to the bird. Draw, and wipe the inside with a cloth; turn the head under the wing; run a trussing-needle and string through the wing and under part of the thigh through the body to the thigh and wing on the other side. Press the feet close to the body, and tie the string tightly. Next pass the needle with string through the hollow of the back, just below the thighs; thrust it again through the legs and body, and tie the strings tightly. Spit and roast the pheasant before a clear brisk fire for three- quarters of an hour, basting it frequently. Have a piece of toast slightly buttered; place it under the bird while it is roasting. Let the gravy drop from the bird on to the bread. When the bird is done cut the toast in four pieces; place them on a dish. Lay the bird on the toast, and put a wall of brown bread- crumbs round the dish. Serve with brown gravy, and bread sauce, in sauce-boats, and also potato ribands.

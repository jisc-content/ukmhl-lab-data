Jellies. 198 Thick Orange Jelly is prepared in the same manner, but without the use of eggs, and when the oranges are very sweet, a few bitter oranges may be used. Oranges filled with Jelly. Cut the oranges in halves, and then with the handle of a teaspoon work out all the juice and fibres of the fruit; then soak the skins in cold water for an hour. Drain them upside down upon a sieve. Pound some rough ice, and place it in a deep dish, and arrange the skins upon it, taking care to stop up any hole with bits of butter. Fill one half of the skins with jelly, coloured pale pink, with two or three drops of cochineal, and the remainder with white. When the jelly is set firm in the oranges, they must be wiped with a napkin. Cut them in quarters with a sharp knife, and build them up on a silver or crystal dish, with small geranium leaves between each quarter. The juice and pulp of the fruit may be used for the jelly. Lemon Jelly. Soak two ounces of gelatine in half a pint of cold water for fifteen minutes; then pour in one pint of boiling water, and put it into a brass pan; add half a pound of lump sugar, the rind and juice of four lemons, the whites of three eggs whipped with a gill of cold water. Mix all together, and whisk the jelly on the fire until it boils about three minutes. Then pour it through the jelly-bag, and when it runs clear, pour it into a mould, and set it on rough ice or in a cool place to firm.

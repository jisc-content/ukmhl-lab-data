Sauces. 48 firm, creamy substance. This cold sauce is especially adapted for chicken and lobster salads. When made, pepper and salt must be added, also two table-spoonfuls of very thick cream. Soubise Sauce. Peel and slice eight large onions, and put them into a stew-pan with two ounces of butter, a little nutmeg, pepper, and salt; place the lid on, and set this to stew very slowly, until the onions are nearly dissolved; next add four ounces of flour, two fresh boiled potatoes, and a pint of white stock, half a pint of cream; stir over the fire for a quarter of an hour, and then rub through a hair sieve; keep hot in a covered stewpan until used. Cardinal Sauce. Put a gill of white stock into a small stew-pan, a very little flour and butter, add a lump of lobster spawn, and a little anchovy and Chili vinegar. Mustard Sauce. Add some butter sauce to a teaspoonful of mustard, a dessert-spoonful of Chili vinegar, and a little anchovy; make hot, and serve with broiled or fried herrings. Bread Sauce. Take two ounces of bread crumbs, and put them into a pan with a shallot, pepper and salt, half a pint of milk, and a pat of butter; boil and stir for five minutes; take out the shallot, serve hot.

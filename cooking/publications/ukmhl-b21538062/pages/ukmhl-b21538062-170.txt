Sandwiches. 154 toast, then of yolk, then of chopped parsley, and so on until the piece of toast is covered; then dish on a napkin. Victoria Sandwiches. Cut thin brown bread, and butter it; and between two slices place alternate layers of thinly-sliced, hard- boiled eggs, a little American cress, and cleaned fillets of anchovies. Divide these slices into small square pieces, and dish them on a napkin.

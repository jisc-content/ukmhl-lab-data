205 Ices. Custard Pudding, Iced. Make a good custard, and when cold pour it into the freezing-pot in its pail, well surrounded with broken ice mixed with salt.

Put the pud- ding into an iced pudding-mould, and imbed it in ice for three or four hours. When wanted, turn it out upon its dish. Iced Souffle.

If flavoured with liqueur soak some pieces of sponge cake in wine, and place them at the bottom of the souffle-dish, and pour the mixture in the dish, sur- rounded with a band of paper two inches higher than the dish; fasten with gum or pins.

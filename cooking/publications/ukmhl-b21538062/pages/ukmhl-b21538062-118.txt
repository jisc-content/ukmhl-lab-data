102 Beefs. half-an-ounce of cloves, same of mace and of pepper- corns, all mixed together and ponnded in a mortar. Rub it well into the piece of beef intended to be cured. The beef must remain in the brine for about twelve days, when it will be ready for use. When about to cook the beef, let it be rolled into and fastened in a cloth, which must also be sewed at opening, and otherwise corded with twine, in the form of a lobster. Put it in a pot with cold water to boil very gently for about four or five hours, according to weight and thickness. When the beef is done, let it be put in press between two dishes with heavy weights on the top. When the beef is perfectly cold, take it out of the cloth, trim and glaze it over, garnish with aspic jelly or merely with picked parsley, and serve either for breakfast, luncheon, dinner, or supper. Beef Steaks. Have the steak cut from the houghbone or ribs, have a clear fire and clean gridiron, let the latter become hot, then rub it with a little suet, lay on the steak, and with a pair of collop-tongs keep turning it con- stantly. Have the dish made very hot when the steaks are half done, sprinkle them over with salt, take them off and put them into a dish before the fire, and cover them with a hot cover. In the course of five minutes put them back upon the gridiron, turning them for other five minutes. When done, dish the steak with the gravy, and serve with horse-radish.

75 Meat Entrees. Frying Batter. To half-a-pound of flour, add one ounce of dissolved butter, a little salt, and the yolk of an egg; mix these together with a wooden spoon, pouring in at intervals about a breakfast cupful of tepid water. Let this batter be well worked with the spoon until it presents a smooth creamy appearance. It must be set aside for an hour or so, and, when about to use it, add lightly two whites of eggs previously whisked into a firm froth. Cream of Chicken. Skin a chicken, and cut all the meat off the bones, and pound it in a mortar; when well pounded, rub all the meat through a fine wire sieve; then season with salt, white pepper, and a very little nutmeg; then mix in some sweet cream with the puree of chicken. It should be the thickness of very thick cream. Then take a convenient sized mould, rub the inside with fresh butter, slice some truffles, and, with a very small tin cutter, cut out any ornament you like from the truffle, ornament the sides and bottom of the mould, pour the mixture into the mould, tie a buttered paper over the top, and place it into a pan of boiling water. Place a close cover on the pan. The water should not be allowed to boil after the mould has been put into the pan, but must be left on the stove to poach for about two hours. When wanted, turn it out on its dish and pour some white mushroom sauce round it, and serve hot.

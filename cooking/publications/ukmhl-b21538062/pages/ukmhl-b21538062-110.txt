Poultry. 94 To Boil Fowls. Singe and draw the fowls; wipe them; stuff the breasts with plain stuffing; put them into a pan that will just hold them; cover them with cold water; add a little salt and a cupful of new milk; set the pan on the stove or slow fire; skim the water when it boils. If young fowls, three-quarters of an hour, if old, two hoursâ€™ boiling will be required. Have a boiled tongue, skin and glaze it; dish the fowls with the tongue in the centre; pour bechamel or any kind of white sauce over them, and serve very hot. To Roast a Fowl. Have a young tender fowl; clean and singe the fowl, and cut off the toes; draw and truss it; stuff the breast with plain stuffing; put a little pepper in the inside; fix a piece of paper on the breast of the fowl; put it before a clear fire to roast for three-quarters of an hour; baste it all the time with dripping, and before you dish it, shake a little flour over it. A spoonful of butter may be melted to froth it; dish, and pour a little gravy round it; serve with fried ham, or tongue, and bread sauce in a sauce tureen. To Roast Chickens. Pick, singe and draw the chickens. Cut off the points of the toes; put a little stuffing in the breasts, sew them up, skewer them as for roast turkey, put them before a clear fire, and baste them well with butter while roasting. They will require twenty minutes. Dish them, and pour a little rich gravy

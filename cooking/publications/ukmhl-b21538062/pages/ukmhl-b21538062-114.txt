Put the lid on the stew-pan, and set the peas to stew very gently over a slow fire for about twenty-five minutes, tossing them up occasionally to admit of their being done equally. When the peas are become soft and are done, should there happen to be too much moisture, boil down on the fire until reduced; add a little white sugar and a good pat of butter; mix these in with the peas, and use to garnish the duck. When dished up, sauce over all with the stock from the duck, previously boiled down to half glaze. Pigeons for a Remove. Take three or four pigeons; truss them as you would chickens for boiling. Season the inside with pepper and salt, herbs and pickles. Rub a little butter on their breasts ; drudge them with flour ; make thin paste and roll each in it separately. Keep them a nice shape, and tie each in a cloth; boil very slowly for an hour and a half. Remove the cloths from them ; place them on a dish; garnish with hard-boiled eggs. Pour rich brown gravy over them, and serve very hot. Turkey Stew. Take the remains of a roast turkey; cut it up in nice sized pieces ; boil the bones for stock, skim it, and put it into a stew-pan with the pieces of turkey. Season slightly with pepper and salt; add thirty oysters, a few chillies, and button onions, one glass of white wine. Stew for an hour, and serve hot.

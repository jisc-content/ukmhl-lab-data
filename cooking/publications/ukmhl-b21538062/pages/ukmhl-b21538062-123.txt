107 Veal. Loin of Yeal, a la Creme. Prepare and roast a loin of veal, and, about twenty minutes before it is done, put a clean dish under it, and baste it all over continuously with a pint of sweet cream; this, as the veal continues to turn round before the fire, will cause it to assume a bright, light brownish crust of a very delicate aspect. While removing the veal from its spit on to its dish, it must be carefully handled so as the crust may not be knocked off. Let the brown deposit, which has fallen from the veal during the time it has been basted with cream, be detached from the dish which has received it; with some white mushroom juice or water, add this to some white sauce and a little cream, and pour it round the veal.

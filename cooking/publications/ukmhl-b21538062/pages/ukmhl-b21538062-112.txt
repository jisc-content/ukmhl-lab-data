Poultry. 96 To Roast a Goose. Singe and draw a goose, leaving the skin long enough to turn over the back; take the upper skins off the feet, turn them round upon the back, and cut off the wings at the first joint. Mince two onions, with four blades of sage, some bread-crumbs, pepper, and salt; mix them all together and put the stuffing into the goose. Put the vent over the rump to keep the stuffing from dropping out; pass the skewer through the wings and body, and fix a piece of paper over the breast. It will require one hour and a-half before a clear fire. Ten minutes before you dish it, take off the paper to let the goose brown. When dished, pour a little good brown gravy round it; serve with apple sauce in a tureen. Note.—A duck is dressed in the same manner, only one hour’s roasting will suffice. Brazed Goose, a la Jardiniere. Truss a goose and place it in a brazing pan, with two carrots, one small turnip, four onions, one head of celery, a little parsley, pepper and salt, with just enough stock or water to cover the goose. A blade of mace, six cloves, and a few pepper-corns must be added, and set to braze slowly for two hours, remembering that the lid of the pan should be covered with live embers, and that the goose must be frequently basted with its own liquor. When the goose is done, drain it and dish it up. Garnish it with spring vegetables; sauce it over with brown sauce, in which there has been incorporated the stock from the goose, previously freed from grease, and boiled down to half glaze.

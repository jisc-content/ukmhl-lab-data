Salads. 144 to boil. Draw it to the side of the fire, place the lid on the pan, allow it to simmer for an hour, then pass it through a jelly-bag or napkin. Keep it in a cool place ready for use. Oyster Salad. Open two dozen large oysters ; add their liquor to half a pint of dissolved aspic jelly, and the white of an egg beat up with the shell; mix in a small pan, place on the stove till it boils ; pass the jelly through a napkin. Take a casserole shape, and wet the inside with cold water; pour in as much jelly as cover the bottom of the shape; place the shape on ice until it is set quite firm; then place a row of oysters on the top of the jelly, distant about an inch from each other; and with a spoon pour a little of the jelly gently over the oysters. Let the shape remain on the ice, or in a cool place. Cut some thin slices of beet-root lengthways, and, with small fancy tin cutters, cut out some shapes of beet-root; lay them round in position as for oysters; sauce them over with the jelly, which must be cold but not set. Place alternate layers of oysters, beet-root, and jelly in the mould till it is filled. The jelly must be allowed to firm before any other layer is added. When set and quite firm, dip the shape in tepid water, and loosen it round the edges; turn it out on its dish with- out breaking it. Cut up two or three lettuces; add some mustard, and cresses, well washed and dried in a cloth; mix two table-spoonfuls of salad oil with two of vinegar, and a little pepper and salt. Sprinkle them over the lettuces, and mix them up lightly; place them in the centre of the aspic.

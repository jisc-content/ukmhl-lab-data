Venison Puddings, Take three quarters of a pound of venison suet and mince it very fine. Add half a pound of oatmeal, pepper and salt, and mix well together. Put a little of this mixture in a small stew-pan and stir it over the fire for a few minutes to ascertain that it is well seasoned. If it is not, add a little more pepper and salt to the suet and oatmeal. Have some sausage skins well cleansed, fill them with the mixture; have a pot of boiling water on the fire; put in the puddings, prick them with a skewer to prevent them from bursting. Boil them for an hour; take them out and dish them upon a folded napkin, serve hot with oatmeal cakes and cheese.

214 Cakes and Biscuits. Sultana Cake. Ingredients Required.—One pound and a-half of sultana raisins, one pound flour, one pound sugar, three-quarters of a pound of butter, and twelve eggs. Place the butter and sugar into a basin ; beat it with a spoon for about half an hour; add two eggs, and beat for five minutes ; then other two, and so on until six have been added. Then add a handful of flour, and then the other six eggs. Keep beating the mixture all the time. Then mix in gently the flour and raisins. Then bake in a moderate oven for about two hours. Note.—The finest flour, dried in an oven, or before the fire, and passed through a hair sieve, should always be used for cakes and biscuits. Pounded white sugar and very fresh eggs should also be used. Petticoat Tails. Ingredients.—One pound of flour, six ounces of butter, and six ounces of sugar. Rub the butter into the flour, then the sugar, a pinch of salt, and a little water, and work it into a smooth dough.

Boiled Turkey, a la Yorkshire. Cut the legs off a turkey; scald, trim, and set them aside; bone the turkey without removing the wings; nearly fill the inside with veal force-meat; thrust a trimmed boiled tongue down the middle of the force-meat, close the pouch of the turkey by sewing it up securely, and truss the turkey for boiling, inserting the feet in their natural position; give it as nearly as possible its original form; the turkey, thus far prepared, must be tied up in a cloth and boiled very gently in order not to burst it; it will take an hour and a half to boil, more or less, according to the size and age of the bird. When the turkey is done, dish it, pour bechamel or any kind of white sauce over it. When carving a turkey, a la Yorkshire, the slices must be cut from across the breast, so as to give to each guest a slice composed of equal parts of tongue, turkey, force-meat, adhering together. Turkeys dressed in this fashion, and sauced over with cream bechamel sauce, decorated with truffles and tongue, and garnished with aspic jelly, form an elegant dish for ball suppers.

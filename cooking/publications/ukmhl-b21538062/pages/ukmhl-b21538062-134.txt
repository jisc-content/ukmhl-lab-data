VENISON. Roast Haunch of Venison. Saw off the shank hone, remove the sinew; pare away the dark, dry skin from the skirt, and also the dried surface of the under part. Then cover the haunch with a large sheet of well-greased paper, and over that place a covering of fiour-and-water paste, about half an inch in thickness; envelop the whole with two large sheets of greased paper, securely tied on with string. Place the venison in a cradle spit, and set it down before the fire to roast for about four hours, more or less—the exact time depending upon the size and weight of the haunch. When about to take it up from the fire, the paste and paper should be removed ; then place the haunch on a very hot dish; pour hot brown gravy round it, cover it quickly with a hot cover, and send to table exceedingly hot. Serve red currant jelly and French beans separately. The following sauce is appropriate for roast venison: —To one pound of currant jelly add a gill of port wine, the rind of a lemon, and a small piece of cinnamon; stir over the fire, but do not boil it. Serve in a sauce- boat.

145 Salads. Salmon Salad, Boil about a pound of salmon, and when cold cut it up into pieces about two inches long and an inch thick. Prepare two or three shred lettuces with a little mustard and cress; steep them in a basin with a little salad oil and vinegar, pepper, and salt, then drain them on a cloth; mix them up lightly with the pieces of salmon, place them on their dish, sauce the whole over with Prince of Wales’ sauce, garnish with boiled beet-root (cut with fancy cutters), and two hard-boiled eggs, their yolks cut in four parts, and the whites cut with cutters in small shapes. Genoese Salad. Fillet two soles, place them in a sauta-pan with a little butter, pepper and salt. When done, place them between two dishes until they are cold; then cut them in pieces two or three inches long. Season the fillets with pepper and salt, then roll them in stiff Genoese sauce, place them on a bed of shred lettuces; take the yolks of three hard-boiled eggs and pound them in the mortar with a piece of fresh butter, pepper and salt; rub them through a coarse wire sieve, put a border of the vermicellied yolks round the salad; cut the whites in small forms with small fancy tin cutters to ornament the salad.

ICES. Arrowroot Pudding, Ieed. Mix together six ounces of arrowroot, one pint of milk, ten ounces of sugar, the juice of one lemon, and half a gill of brandy. Stir the whole on the fire until it boils and becomes thick; then remove the pan from the fire, and mix in the yolks of ten eggs previously well beaten ; and when thoroughly cold, mix in lightly the whites of the ten eggs previously beaten to a snow. Pour the mixture into the freezing-pot in its pail, well surrounded with rough ice mixed with salt. Work the freezer round with the hand for about ten minutes, and then detach the set ice from the sides of the freezer with the ice spattle, and continue freezing and working the ice with the spattle, to give smoothness and body to the ice, until it forms a stiff, smooth, com- pact body. It may then be put into the mould, previously ornamented with strips of angelica and orange peel. It must then be imbedded in ice mixed with salt, until it is time to dish it. When it is wanted, remove it from the ice, and wipe the mould. Dip it in cold water for about a minute; wipe it; then turn the pudding out on its dish.

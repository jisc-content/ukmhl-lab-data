129 Pies. are being formed. Pork pies are made in the same manner, only in seasoning add a little sage instead of mushrooms and parsley. Serve very hot. Take cold roast beef, mutton, or veal; cut it in ordinary-sized slices, and season it with pepper and salt. Cut some onions in slices and fry them in butter, with chopped parsley, and mix with the pieces of meat. Put the whole into a pie-dish. Collect all the roast meat, bones, and any trimmings of fresh meat that can be had; put them in a pan with carrot, turnip, celery, and a sprig of thyme, and cover with cold water. Boil until the substance is out of the bones ; strain and skim the stock; pour it over the meat. Have some potatoes boiled, and nicely beaten, add an egg well beaten, and a little milk; season with pepper and salt. Beat them up with a fork, cover the dish with the potatoes, smooth it all over with a knife, pinch it round the edge, and mark it on the top the same as paste. Bake it in an oven until the meat is very hot, and the potatoes a nice brown colour. Shepherdâ€™s Pie.

SALADS. Aspic Jelly, for Salads. Cut up about ten pounds of shanks of veal, two ox feet, or four calvesâ€™ feet, and an old fowl, with three carrots, one stalk of celery, small bunch of parsley, one bay leaf, one sprig of thyme, the same of sweet marjo- ram, six cloves, and eighteen pepper-corns, and about an ounce of salt. Put all the meat, vegetables, herbs,, and seasonings into a large pot; pour in as much cold water as cover them thoroughly; place the pot on the stove ; and when the water boils, skim it well and boil it gently for seven hours without reducing it much in quantity. Then strain the stock through a tammy- sieve into pans, and place it in the larder to cool till the next day. When the stock is perfectly cold and firm, with a spoon skim off all the oil and grease. Dip a clean napkin in boiling water; wring it out and dab it over the stock to free it from grease ; place the aspic in a proper-sized stew-pan, and set it on the stove to dissolve; lightly draw some pieces of white blotting- paper over its surface, to remove any remaining grease. Whip up four eggs with half a pint of cold water, and half a pint of French white wine, and a small wine-glass- ful of tarragon vinegar and a few egg-shells. Mix all up with a whisk, and continue whipping it until it begins. *

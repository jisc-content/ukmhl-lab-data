PUDDINGS. Paradise Pudding. Six ounces chopped beef suet, six ounces sultana raisins, chopped with six ounces of apples, six ounces of bread-crumbs, the grating of a lemon and juice, three eggs well whipped and mixed with the other ingredients, with six ounces of sugar. Butter the inside of a pudding mould; put the mixture into the mould; cover the top of it with a piece of cloth or paper; put it into a pan with boiling water, and steam it for four hours. Take care that the water does not boil into the pudding. When done, turn it out on its dish and pour wine sauce round it, and serve hot. Pompeiian Pudding. Put into a pan the yolks of four eggs, one ounce fresh butter, two ounces pounded sugar, the rind and juice of two lemons; stir it over the fire until dissolved and thick; it must not boil; then beat up the whites very stiff, and add to the other ingredients; then steam for half an hour; the water must be boiling before the pudding is put in, but not on any account to boil after it is put into the pan to steam; serve with apple jelly round it.

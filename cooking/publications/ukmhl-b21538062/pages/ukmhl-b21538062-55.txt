Remove the beards from some dozens; strain the liquor into a stew pan; add thereto two ounces of but- ter kneaded with two ounces of flour, a little cream, anchovy, nutmeg, and cayenne; stir the sauce over the fire to boil, and reduce for ten minutes; then add a couple of yolks of eggs, and a little lemon juice, and some chopped parsley; add the oysters, cut up; stir all together over the fire for a few minutes, and fill some scollop shells with this preparation; cover them over with a thick coating of fried bread crumbs; place them on a baking sheet in the oven for five minutes, and serve them quite hot. If you have no scollop shells, the deep shell of the oyster, well washed, will serve the purpose. Scolloped Mussels. These are prepared similarly to oysters, and placed in scollop shells likewise.

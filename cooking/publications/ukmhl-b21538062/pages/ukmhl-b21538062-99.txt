Meat Entries. 83 Italian Pigeon Stew. Take three or four pigeons, skin and clean them, cut Out the fillets from the breasts; cut off the legs and lay them aside with the fillets ; then cut up the hack bones, with the necks and gizzards; put them into a pan with a pound of raw, lean beef; add a little pepper and salt, cover well with cold water, and boil for sauce. When the substance is abstracted from the bones, strain the sauce into a small stew-pan; put the legs and fillets of the pigeons into the pan with the sauce, stew them until tender; cut some macaroni in pieces, boil it in plenty of water, drain it on a sieve; grate some parmesan cheese, and strew a little on the bottom of the entree dish; then a layer of macaroni, then of cheese, then of macaroni, and a little of the sauce. Put the pieces of pigeon on the top. The sauce should be reduced to half glaze, and poured over the entree. Have two eggs hard boiled and skinned; take out the yolks without breaking them, cut each in two, and place a piece in each corner of the dish; cut the whites in small stars or diamonds, and ornament the dish with them, and serve up very hot. Salmis of Grouse. Take the remains of cold roast grouse, trim the fillets and legs; make some salmis sauce of the bones, rather thick; put the pieces of grouse into the sauce, season with salt and a little cayenne pepper, and a small glass of port wine. Mushrooms or truffles may be added, and the whole served very hot.

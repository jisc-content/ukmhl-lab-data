67 Meat Entrees. Veal Cutlets, a la Financiere. About six bones of the best end of a neck of veal will be required for this purpose. The chin bone must first be removed with a small saw, and also the upper part of the cutlet or rib bones, leaving the bones intended to form the cutlets only about three inches long. The cutlets must then be divided, trimmed, and closely larded; next overlay the bottom of a stew-pan with sliced carrot, onion, celery, parsley, and an onion stuck with four cloves. Place the larded cutlets on this bed of vegetables, moisten with stock or water, just enough to reach up to the edge of the larding. Set the pan on the fire to boil, and then put it in the oven to braze for about an hour and a half, basting them frequently with their own liquor; when they are cooked, and of a nice brown colour, dish up the cutlets, with the bones under, thus showing the larded part uppermost. Use the strained stock from the cutlets to make the sauce; pour the sauce round the dish; fill up the well in the centre with stewed mushrooms, or green peas.

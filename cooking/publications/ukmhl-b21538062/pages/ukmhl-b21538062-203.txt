Puddings. 187 Shape of Sea Moss Farina. Mix two large tea-spoonfuls of the powder in half a pint of boiling milk; stir it until smooth; then put it into a pan with one English pint of new milk and an ounce of sugar, and slowly boil it, stirring all the time until quite melted. Then let it simmer by the fire until it is like thick cream; then strain it through muslin into a basin. Beat two eggs and add them to the mixture; then put it all into the pan and just bring it to the boil, and put it into a shape. When cold, turn out and serve it with plum jam round the dish, and cream, separately. Devonshire Cream. Put new milk into a pan; let it stand for twelve hours ; then put it on a slow fire or stove, in the same pan in which it has stood. Let it heat slowly until one can just suffer the finger in it; let it then stand in a cool place for other twelve hours, after which skim it. Stewed Prunes. Put about a pound and a quarter of prunes into a pan, with about a quarter of a pound of lump sugar. Add as much cold water as nearly cover them. Place the pan on a slow fire or stove, and stew the prunes slowly until tender; then remove the stones without breaking the fruit much. Place the prunes in a circle round the dish, the same as with cutlets. Break the stones, and pick out the kernels; dip them in boiling water and skin them. Place a kernel upon each prune. The juice of the fruit must be boiled down to a syrup.

163 Savouries. Cheese Souffle. Take four ounces of flour and mix it with half a pint of new milk, add three ounces of fresh butter; boil it in a stew-pan, stirring all the time; when it has boiled about three minutes, and is quite thick, re- move it from the fire; beat up four eggs, yolks and whites separately, mix in the yolks with the latter, and three ounces of grated parmesan cheese; then mix in the whites of eggs ; the eggs must be very well beaten so as to make the souffle light. When all the in- gredients are mixed together, pour into a well-buttered souffle dish. Put it in a brisk oven and bake for about half-an-hour. It should rise very much and be nicely browned on the top, and sent to table the moment it is removed from the oven. Cheese Ramakins. Mix three ounces of flour with a breakfast-cupful of sweet milk and two ounces of fresh butter. Stir all together and boil for a few minutes. Take the pan from the fire and mix in lightly the yolks of three eggs, pre- viously well beaten; then mix in two ounces of grated parmesan cheese, and a very little pepper and salt. Have the three whites of eggs whipped to a snow, and mix in lightly with the other ingredients. Have some paper ramakin cases in readiness on a baking sheet; fill them three parts full with the mixture. Put the baking sheet in a brisk, oven; bake them from ten to fifteen minutes. They should be well risen and nicely browned on the top. Dish them on a napkin-and send them Ho table the moment they are removed from the oven.

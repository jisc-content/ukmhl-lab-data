Jellies. 197 To Clarify Gelatine. Soak one ounce of gelatine in one pint of cold water for fifteen minutes; then pour it into a pan, and add the juice of half a lemon, and about half an ounce of white sugar. Stir it all together, and boil for about twenty minutes. Remove the scum as it rises, and strain it through muslin, previously wrung out of hot water. It is then ready for use. Rum Jelly. Soak three ounces of gelatine in a pint of cold water; add half a pound of sugar, the rind and juice of three lemons, half a stick of cinnamon, eight cloves, ten pepper corns, a little grated nutmeg, and a gill and a half of rum. Whisk all well together. Pour it into a brass pan, and stir it over the fire until it boils. Allow it to boil gently for a few minutes; pour the jelly through the bag several times until it runs bright. When all has run through, add a glassful of brandy, and pour the jelly into moulds. Set them on rough ice or in a cold place to firm. Clear Orange Jelly. Soak one ounce of gelatine in an English pint of cold water; add the juice of eight sweet oranges, half a pound of lump sugar, the whites and shells of three eggs. Whisk all well together in a brass pan, and stir it on the fire until it boils for a few minutes; then pour it through a jelly bag ; return it to the bag until it runs perfectly clear. Pour it into a mould, and when set, turn it out upon its dish. o

SAUCES. Plain Butter Sauce. Take four ounces of butter; put it in a pan with the same weight of flour; put the pan on the stove or slow fire; melt and mix together. Then pour in some boiling water until it is the thickness of cream; boil it for ten minutes ; skim it. If you should find it lumpy, pour it through a strainer. This sauce may be served with boiled fish, and it makes a foundation for many other sauces. White Bechamel Sauce.

io6 Veal. or water just to reach the edge of the surface of the veal, and set it to braze in the oven, or very gently over a slow fire, with live embers on the lid of the pan. Take due care to baste it frequently with its own liquor during the time it is being brazed, in order that the meat, by continuously absorbing the stock, may be im- pregnated with the flavour of the vegetables. When the loin of veal has thus stewed, or brazed, for about three hours, let it be drained and placed on a baking dish; and after straining and boiling down its own liquor to the consistency of half glaze, add it to the meat, and set it in the oven, continuously basting it with its glaze, until it presents a light, glossy aspect. The loin of veal must then be dished up and garnished with cooked tomatoes, onions, and carrots, and sauced over with the liquor of the veal. Roast Loin of Veal. Take the best end of a loin of veal, weighing about eight pounds, with a fair proportion of the skirt on; trim it square, and place some veal stuffing in an incision made for that purpose in the flap or skirt. Wrap the skirt round the kidney fat, and secure the loin tightly with skewers and string. Envelop the loin well in greased sheets of clean paper, secured with string; spit it and roast it before a moderate fire for about two hours. When done, dish it up, and pour over it either some clear brown gravy, or some melted butter, coloured with a spoonful of mushroom catsup, and serve separately either ham, or tongue, or some bacon, garnished with some sort of vegetable.

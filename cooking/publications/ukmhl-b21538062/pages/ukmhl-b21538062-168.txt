SANDWICHES. Fish Sandwiches. Cut some thin slices of bread, and butter them; place thin scollops of any kind of cooked fish you may happen to have, on the bread so prepared; spread a little tartar sauce over the pieces of fish, and strew some shred lettuce-leaves, and a few shred gherkins, and hard-boiled eggs cut in thin slices; season with pepper and salt; place another slice of bread and butter upon this, and press it. Cut up the sandwiches in squares, and dish them upon a napkin and serve. The Princeâ€™s Sandwich. Take the meat of roast pheasant, grouse, or part- ridge, and cut it into small, neat squares ; to this add a third portion of tongue and truffle, cut in the same manner. Make a stiff salmis sauce from the bones of the birds; add a small piece of good soup glaze, set it away to become cold and firm. All the meat, tongue, and truffle must be mixed with the sauce, and then be cut out in shapes to suit the slices of bread, which must be cut from small milk-rolls, and be spread with butter.

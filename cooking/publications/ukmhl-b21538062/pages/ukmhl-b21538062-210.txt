JELLIES. Calf’s Feet Jelly. Clean and cut into pieces four calves’ feet; put them to boil in a gallon of cold water; boil gently for four or five hours, until the water is reduced to half its former quantity. Then strain the stock through a tammy or hair sieve into a basin, and, when it has become cold and set firm into a jelly, scrape off all the grease ; wash the surface of the stock with a little hot water, and dab it over with a clean cloth. Then put the stock into a brass pan with two pounds of lump- sugar, the juice and rinds of six lemons, half an ounce of whole cinnamon, twelve cloves, and twenty pepper- corns. Set the pan on the fire to dissolve the jelly, and then add the whites of six eggs, well whisked, with half a pint of water, and also the shells of eggs. Stir the jelly until it boils; then add a pint of sherry wine; allow it to boil again; and then pour it into a jelly-bag, previously wrung out of boiling water. Place a basin under the jelly-stand to receive the jelly as it passes through the bag; return the jelly through the bag until it passes quite bright and clear. Then fill the shape, previously wet with cold water. When a shape is wanted, dip it in warm water, and turn it out on a silver or crystal dish.

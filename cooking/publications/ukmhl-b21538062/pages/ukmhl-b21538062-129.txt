The saddle, thus prepared, must be brazed in white stock, with the usual complement of stock vegetables, for about an hour and a half. When done, and taken out of the braze, it must be left in the napkin, and pressed between two dishes, with a heavy weight on the top dish. The saddle must be allowed to remain in the napkin until it is quite cold. It must then be removed from the napkin, slightly trimmed, made hot in a little of the stock, without boiling, as that might deform it. Then, placed on its dish, the sauce must be made free from grease, slightly thickened with flour, and poured round the lamb, which may be garnished with any kind of dressed vegetables.

Miscellaneous Recipes. 236 Pickled Red Cabbages. Slice the cabbages into a colander, and sprinkle each layer with salt. Allow it to drain for two days ; then put it into a jar, and pour in boiling vinegar enough to cover the whole. Cover the top of the jar with bladder. Mushroom Catsup. Gather mushrooms when dry; break them into bits, and put them into a dish. Sprinkle each layer with salt. Let them remain for two days ; stir occasionally; strain the liquid through a hair sieve, and put it into a pan. Add mixed spices, the beat whites of two or more eggs. Boil for about five minutes ; then strain it through a napkin into a basin. When cold, put it into bottles; cork and seal them, and keep in a dry place. Cream Cheese. Place a piece of linen inside a round basin; pour therein about two quarts of thick sweet cream ; gather up the edges of the cloth, and tie with twine close to the cream; suspend it upon a hook or nail; place a basin under it to receive the thin cream as it passes through the linen cloth. When the cream ceases to run remove the twine nearer to the cream; then let it drip for twenty-four hours. Turn it upside down, and place a heavy weight on the top, with nettles under and over the cheese. And when about to serve remove the cloth; place the cheese upon its dish; garnish round the base with small nettle leaves, and serve with oatmeal cakes or hard biscuits.

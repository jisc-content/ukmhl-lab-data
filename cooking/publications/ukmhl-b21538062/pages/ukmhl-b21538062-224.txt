208 Ices. Cherry Water Ice. Bruise about a pound and a half of ripe cherries in a mortar, and put them into a pan with about five ounces of sugar. Boil for a few minutes, and rub through a sieve into a basin. Then add a pint of syrup, and half a pint of cold water. Freeze and mould the ice. Raspberry Water Ice. Bruise one pound of raspberries and half a pound of red currants; add four ounces of sugar, and a gill of cold water; pour it into a pan, and stir it over the fire until it boils. Strain it through a hair sieve into a basin; add a pint of syrup, and freeze in the usual way. Strawberry Water Ice is made the same as above by substituting strawberries for raspberries. Orange Water Ice. To the juice of six oranges and two lemons add the rinds of three oranges rubbed with sugar, one pint of syrup, and half a pint of cold water. Mix all together, and strain through a hair sieve. Then freeze in the usual way. Lemon Water Ice. The juice of eight lemons, the rubbed rind of two, a pint of syrup, and a gill of cold water. Mix and freeze in the usual way. Note.â€”Bear in mind that while ices are being frozen they must be frequently well worked with the spattle, to render them smooth and give them consistency.

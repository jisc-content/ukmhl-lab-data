Sauces. 5i Brone Sauce, Mix with a gill of salad oil in a basin, half a gill of vinegar, two ounces of brown sugar, the juice of an orange, and a tablespoonful of mustard. Mix well together, and serve. Salmis Sauce, Chop up small some trimmings of roast game, and put these into a stew-pan, with a bay leaf, a sprig of thyme, and a tablespoonful of salad oil; fry the whole of a light brown colour, then add a glass of white wine, and half a pint of brown stock; boil gently on the corner of the stove for ten minutes; remove the grease and scum; strain into a stew-pan for use. Mushroom Sauce. One pint of mushroom buttons, salt to taste, a little grated nutmeg, one blade of mace, one pint of cream, two ounces of butter, and flour to thicken it; boil all together for ten minutes. This sauce should be the thickness of double cream, and is excellent for boiled fowls. Sauce for Boiled Fowls, Put some new milk in a pan with one ounce of fresh butter; mix two table-spoonfuls of flour in a little cold milk, pour it into the pan, put it on the stove, keep stirring until it boils; grate some ham or tongue, mix with the sauce, pour over the fowls.

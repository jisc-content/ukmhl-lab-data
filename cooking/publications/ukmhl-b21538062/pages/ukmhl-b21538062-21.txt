SOUPS. Soup made from Dried Turtle. Soak one pound of dried turtle meat in cold water for twenty-four hours, cut up fourteen pounds of beef- hough and one fowl; place all the meat in a convenient- sized stock-pot, and fill it up with cold water, and place it on a hot plate or over a slow fire. Add two carrots, six onions, one stalk of celery, six cloves, two blades of mace, and a few pepper-corns; then add the turtle- meat ; boil the stock very gently for eight hours; re- move the pieces of turtle from the pot, wash them in lukewarm water, and place them between two flat dishes until they are wanted; strain the stock through a hair sieve, and let it stand in the larder until the next day, when it must be clarified. Remove every particle of fat from the stock; mince two pounds of lean beef, and mix it with the stock and the whites of four eggs beat up with their shells, a little parsley, green onions, sweet basil, sweet marjoram, a sprig of lemon-thyme, three blades of tarragon, and a handful of button-mushrooms. When the stock has boiled about a minute, draw the pot to the side of the stove; let it remain there for half-an-hour to clear and infuse the herbs ; then strain through a tammy sieve or cloth ;

54 Sauces. thus far prepared must now be spread out with the bent knuckles of the right hand on the slab, and having pressed the butter in a cloth to extract any milk it may contain, place it in the centre of the paste, and partially spread it by pressing on it with a cloth. The four sides should then be folded over so as entirely to cover the butter. Shake a little flour over and under it. Shape the paste in a square form, measuring about ten inches each way; place this on a flat dish, put it way for ten minutes in a very cool place to keep it firm; roll it out on the slab with a rolling pin, and shake a little flour over and under the paste, to prevent it from sticking either to the rolling pin or slab. Roll the paste out to about thirty inches in length; fold it in three equal folds; press these together by running the rolling pin over the paste; turn it round and roll it out again the reverse way, in the same manner and length as before. Fold it in three equally, fasten these folds by running the rolling pin over them with pressure, and set the paste back in a cool place to firm for eight or ten minutes. At the end of this time give two other turns as just described, and having rested for other eight minutes, it must receive two more turns previous to its being cut out for baking. The next thing to be done is, when after the last turn has been given to the paste, and it has been rolled out to the thickness of the fourth of an inch, and has been allowed to rest in a cool place for five minutes, with a plain or fluted round tin patty cutter to stamp out as many patties as you require. Place these on a

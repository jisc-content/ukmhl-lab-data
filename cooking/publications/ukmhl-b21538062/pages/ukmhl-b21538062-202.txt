Have a piece of paste ready, and, with a paste-brush, egg the edge of the dish. Set the pie-dish on the paste, and run the knife round the outside of the dish; take it off, and cut a small bit of paste the breadth of the border of the pie- dish ; lay it round the edge of the dish, and brush it with egg. Then lay on the cover, press it round the edge on the border, and nick it round the edge with a knife; brush it over with egg, and dust it with pounded sugar; bake in a moderate oven for about an hour.

MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES. Elderberry Wine. Boil five gallons of water for half an hour, and let it stand till lukewarm'. Mince roughly twenty-four pounds of Malaga raisins; add them to the water. Let it remain for ten days. Stir it twice a day. Then strain the liquor through a hair sieve. Have ready about six pints of the juice of elderberries, extracted as for jelly. Mix it cold with the raisin juice, and put it into a cask. Let it stand in a warm place. Tilt the cask a little, and stir the contents well up from the bottom once or twice a-day. Any sediment that the wine may contain will be cast off at the lower side of the bung-hole. A little liquor must be kept in readi- ness for filling up the cask as occasion may require during the process of fermentation, which may last for two or three weeks, according to the size of the cask. When the wine has ceased to hiss, the cask may be edged up until the bung-hole is level. Then cork it tight, and let it remain in a cool, dry place for three months. It may then be put into bottles, and kept for any length of time.

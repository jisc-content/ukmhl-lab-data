139 Game. Green Goose. Pluck the goose, and with a penknife pick off all the stubble feathers; dip the legs in boiling water, and rub off the skin with a cloth; cut off the head and neck, leaving the skin long enough to turn over the back, and twist the legs round so as to let the web of the feet rest flat upon the thighs. Run a trussing- needle with string through the wing and thigh of the right side through the body of the bird to the thigh and wing on the left, and tie it tightly at the back of the goose. Place it on a spit, and roast it before a brisk fire for an hour, basting it frequently. Froth it with flour and butter, and when done, dish it up. Pour brown gravy round it; garnish the dish with water- cresses and serve. Wild Duck. These must be trussed in the same manner as young geese, and roasted before a clear fire for twenty minutes, and served with brown gravy, seasoned with port wine and cayenne pepper. Roast Partridges. Pluck, singe, and draw the partridges; cut away the head and neck and the points of the toes ; truss them in the same manner as grouse or black game; place them on a spit and roast them before a clear fire for twenty minutes; place toasted bread under them while they are roasting. When done, cut the toast in four parts, and cut off the crusts. Dish the birds upon the toast; put brown gravy under them, and serve bread

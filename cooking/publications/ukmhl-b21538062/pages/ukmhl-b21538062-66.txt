Sauces. 50 pulp into a stew-pan, with a wine-glassful of spinach juice; add a little piece of butter, a pinch of sugar, a little grated nutmeg; pepper and salt to taste. Make it hot, and serve with boiled or grilled mackerel. Fennel Sauce. Chop fine a handful of fennel, and parboil it for three minutes ; drain free from water, and add this to some plain butter sauce ; work in a small pat of butter to make it smooth, and serve hot. Port Wine Sauce for Wild Ducks. Add the juice of half a lemon to a glass of port wine, three shallots sliced, a pinch of cayenne pepper, a table-spoonful of Harvey sauce; boil for three minutes, and strain it into a sauce boat. Allemande Sauce. Put a pint of white stock into a sauce-pan; thicken it with two spoonfuls of flour, a few sliced mushrooms, or some mushroom juice. Reduce this by stirring it over the fire for ten minutes; then remove it from the fire for a few minutes; beat up the yolks of four eggs; mix them with half a pint of cream, a little grated nutmeg, pepper and salt, a teaspoonful of pounded sugar, and the juice of half a lemon; pour it into the pan, stirring all the time. Now place the pan on the stove; keep stirring; make the sauce very hot in order to thicken it, but do not allow it to boil, as that would spoil the sauce. Now strain it off for use.

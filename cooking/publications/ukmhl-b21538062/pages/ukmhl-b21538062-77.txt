When the lobster has been boiled and become cold, take out all the meat, mince it very fine, brown two ounces of butter with a table-spoonful of flour, and put in the mince; season with white pepper, a pinch of cayenne, one teaspoonful of lemon pickle, and two table-spoonfuls of white stock or gravy, and stir it over the fire until it is well mixed, and quite hot. If one lobster, beat up one egg; if more, two will be required. Add to the mince, and stir it a little; lay it upon a dish until it is cold, make them in the form of lamb cutlets, brush them over with beat yolks of eggs, and shake bread crumbs over them; have the frying pan ready with plenty of boiling lard or fresh drippings; fry them a nice light brown. Stick into the narrow end of the cutlet a joint of the small claw, place them upon a napkin round the dish, and garnish with parsley in the centre. Crab Cutlets are done in the same way as Lobster Cutlets. Bouches of Lobster. Take a fresh boiled hen lobster, break the shell and remove the meat, coral, and spawn.

Pound it in a mortar, with four ounces of butter, two whole eggs, and two yolks; season with a teaspoonful of anchovy, a little grated nutmeg, pepper and salt.

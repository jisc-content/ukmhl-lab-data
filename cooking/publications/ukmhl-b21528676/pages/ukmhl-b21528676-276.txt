When the rice has taken up all the butter, add four cloves, four car- damoms, four sticks of cinnamon, two coriander leaves, two blades of mace, and three teaspoonfuls of salt. Give it all a good stir, and pour over the stock the fowl was boiled in, along with a cupful of milk which has been boiled to half its bulk; add one red and three green chillies sliced, and a handful of sultana raisins.

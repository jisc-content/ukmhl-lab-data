POLAND 491 Barszcz. (Meat Soup.) Put into a stockpot eighteen or twenty ounces of brisket of beef ; cover well, half with broth and half with sour juice of beetroot ; set the stockpot on the fire, skim the liquid, and at the first bubbling remove it to the corner of the stove. After the lapse of an hour and a half add to this meat a knuckle of veal, a well- cleansed duck (previously blanched in water), half a pound of lean bacon also blanched, two carrots, parsley and celery roots, an onion, and some whole spice. Two hours afterwards plunge into the broth four smoked sausages ; continue a moderate ebullition. Take the meat out as soon as done, then pass the liquid through a sieve, skimming its fat. Clarify with whites of eggs mixed with a little cold water and slightly whipped. The broth being clear pass it through a napkin. This done, it should be of a rose colour ; keep it warm on the corner of the stove. A quarter of an hour previous to serving take up the fillets of the duck and pare and cut them in neat pieces, slice in a slanting direction the sausages; cut in long squares the lean bacon and brisket of beef. Put all these garnishes into the tureen, with a few tablespoonfuls of cooked beetroots cut in thin strips, as well as two dozen little dumplings, about the size of a walnut, formed with a hash of beef and mushrooms covered with a good thin pastry and boiled in salted water. Pour the consomme over these garnishes. If the soup should have lost its fine rose colour it may be helped with a few spoonfuls of raw but filtered beetroot juice, or a few drops of carmine.

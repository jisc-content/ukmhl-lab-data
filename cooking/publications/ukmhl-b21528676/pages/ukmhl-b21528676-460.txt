BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 424 paste. Cut this paste into round pieces, and put some bean or azuki compound (which is called ann) in each of these pieces, and turn the piece of paste from all sides, which then becomes something like English tarts. Put them on a sieve set on a cloth over bubbling water, so as to be steamed through till sufficiently cooked. Rice Cake. Grind some rice, and make into a dough by mixing some water with it; then steam and spread out into a thin sheet. Cut this paste into pieces of various sizes, and dry them by sunlight or any other heat. These dried pieces of paste are baked like English toasted bread, and served with sauce or a mixture of sugar and sauce. Soy. Take one gallon of the seed of Soya hispida (white haricots or kidney beans may be used instead) , boil them in water until quite soft and the water almost evaporated ; then add one gallon of bruised wheat. Keep the mixture in a warm place for twenty-four hours, and then stir in one gallon of common salt dissolved in two gallons of warm water. Put this into a stone jar and bung it loosely, leaving it thus for eight or ten weeks, giving it an occasional stir up. At the expiration of that time squeeze out by pressure all the liquor, and bottle it for use. The residue may be salted and soaked again for a further supply, which would not be so good as the first.

BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS Suet Dumplings. Take half a pound each of dried flour and minced beef kidney suet, a teaspoonful of salt, and a quarter teaspoon- lid of pepper ; mix all together. Make a well of the mix- tuie, and put in a little water, and make a dough suffi- ciently firm so that it will not stick to the sides of the bowl. Break off pieces double the size of a large walnut, and roll round with the hands. Put them into boiling salted water, and boil steadily for three hours. A large one may be put in a cloth dipped in boiling water, and tied up, leaving room to swell. Braised Belfast Ham. Take a smoked ham and saw off the knuckle bone quite close, then soak it for twenty-four hours in cold water, scrape off the dirt and slime, and put it on in cold water to boil with plenty of fat in the water ; when boiling, skim carefully ; add some vinegar, two celery heads, a carrot and turnip, a large bunch of sweet herbs, and half a tablespoonful of sugar. Simmer steadily for three hours. Remove the rind, trim the surface of the fat smoothly with a knife, put it in a baking pan in the oven for half an hour, and baste well with a little stock and its own gravy, and garnish with green peas, or Brussels sprouts, spinach, etc. Serve with mashed potatoes and a sauce-boatful of ham cullis or essence, with a little sherry mixed in it. 39Â°

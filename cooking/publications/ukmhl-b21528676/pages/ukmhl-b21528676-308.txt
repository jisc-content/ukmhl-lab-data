BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 272 Mutter Chahkee. (Green Peas.) Put in a pot of boiling water half an ounce of sugar and two pounds of shelled green peas, and boil steadily for twenty minutes; drain, and put them in another pot. Now fry lightly in four ounces of boiling ghee six ounces of roughly chopped onions, which add to the peas with a ground red chilli, and salt to taste. Stew gently for another twenty minutes. Eat with lentils, rice, new unleavened bread, ghee, chutnies, etc. Dahl Falooree. (Spiced Lentil Crusts.) Put into a basin two pounds of lentil flour which has been perfectly dried, two pounds of onions, a table- spoonful of parsley and sorrel (all finely chopped), a dessertspoonful of salt, and the same quantity of finely ground green ginger. Mix all thoroughly. Pour in sufficient water, very gradually, to make it into a paste which will stand by itself when dropped off a spoon. The mixture must be continually and smartly beaten when the water is being added so that it foams much like whipped cream. Boil eight slices of lemon peel in a deep pan half full of ghee. When the peel is thoroughly cooked take it out, and with a tablespoon drop the mixture in the shape of rocks into the boiling ghee, and allow to brown on all sides. Continue doing this till all the mixture is finished. Be careful to remove all floating particles before putting in additional mixture. These must be eaten hot.

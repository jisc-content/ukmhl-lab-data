BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS Shrimp Sauce. Make exactly the same as lobster sauce, only substi- tuting boiled shrimps, passed through a sieve, and some whole shelled shrimps instead of lobsters. Fried Fillets of Sole. Skin and put two soles in a deep dish, season them with chopped sweet herbs, salt and pepper, cover with white wine, and leave to soak for half-an-hour. A few minutes before cooking, fillet the soles, dip the fillets in milk, dredge them well with flour, and fry them in lard. When nicely browned, put them in a folded napkin placed on a hot dish, and garnish with fried parsley and slices of lemon. Lamb Cutlets. Take six cutlets about an inch thick. Grill them as you would chops, and serve them with this garnish :— Trim twenty-four pieces each of young potatoes, carrots, and turnips a couple of inches long, and as thick as a pencil, pointing the ends of them. Blanch these for five minutes in boiling water, drain, after which put them into a stewpan with two ounces of butter, putting the carrots in first, then the potatoes, and lastly, the turnips. Cook over a slow fire, seasoning with salt and pepper, and a dust of sugar. When tender, drain and serve in the centre of the dish of cutlets, with a teaspoonful of melted glaze poured over them. Mutton or veal cutlets may be cooked the same way. 1 3°

ASIA MINOR 55 Shiftah Composto (Stewed Peaches). Skin some peaches, cut them in halves, and stew in a strong syrup of sugar till the fruit is quite clear. Serve cold. Kuftes (Minced Balls). Take one pound three ounces of minced mutton, and let the eighth part of it remain uncooked. Have some pieces of onion fried in butter, and when they become of a brown colour fry the meat in it; add some water and boil till tender. When this is done, take it out and put in some salt, one teaspoonful of cardamoms, one teaspoon- ful of cumin, a pinch of caraway and a good pinch of pepper, all ground together. Then grind the eighth part of the meat which was kept uncooked, and mix it with the fried meat, the ground condiments, and a considerable quantity of minced parsley, and make all this into small balls. Put them in a pan along with a little water and two ounces of butter, and stew very slowly. Garnish the dish with sliced hard-boiled eggs and lemons. Serve with bread and pickles.

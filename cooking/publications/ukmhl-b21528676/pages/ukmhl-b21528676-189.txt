FRANCE (North) Port Wine Sauce. Put a piece of fresh butter in a pan and fry the red parts of two large carrots and two medium-sized onions cut in small dice, a little thyme, and a bay leaf. When well browned, but not burnt, set it aflame with half a glass of Martel brandy ; add half a glass of port wine* and after boiling for one minute put in four spoonfuls of fresh tomato pulp, a slice of glaze, a large glass of port wine, and half a glass of white stock. Simmei three- quarters of an hour, pass it through a fine hail sieve, stir in a pinch of cayenne pepper, two spoonfuls of gooseberry jelly, and a small piece of fiesh butter. Pour over the slices cut from the breast and serve with orange salad. This is a most excellent sauce for most kinds of game, such as venison, hare, wideon, teal, wild pigeon, etc., etc. To see Mons. Frederick of the Restaurant Tours d’Argent in Paris serve this dish is as good as a play. An assistant cook with great solemnity bears from the kitchen the dish containing the bird ; he is followed by other two carrying the various ingredients for making the sauce, and two waiters come after carrying the ashets, etc., and, last of all, Mons. Frederick himself bringing up the rear. He commands the cook to show the duck to the diners and then to place it on the side table to be operated on. One of the waiters hands him a knife and fork, which he gracefully flourishes, and then deftly cuts thin slices from the breast and places them on a hot ashet. He then orders one of the cooks to put the carcase into the press, and another to turn the handles. ‘53

BELGIUM 73 Gateau Riche (Rich Cake.) Ten ounces flour, half a pound butter, five eggs, one teaspoonful baking powder, half a pound castor sugar, quarter pound sultanas, one ounce angelica or pistachio nuts, quarter pound almonds, quarter pound cherries, three ounces candied peel, rind of one lemon, a little nutmeg. Cream the butter and sugar, then add one egg and a little flour ; beat again, and so on, adding one egg and flour till all are in. Then mix in fruit, etc.; add powder last. Bake in a well greased papered tin until nearly browned and firm. Try with a skewer, and when baked, slip on to a wire sieve till cold. Cut in finger lengths, and cover tops with white soft icing coloured and flavoured to taste. For British table do not use icing. Sultana Cake. Make exactly as above, only using one pound of sul- tanas instead of the other fruits. Plum Cake. Make the same as Rich Cake, substituting currants for angelica or pistachio nuts and stoned raisins for cherries. This cake is all the better of half a glass of brandy. Madeira Cake. Make the same as Rich Cake, leaving out all fruits. The grated rind of a lemon is an improvement.

HUNGARY 221 pound weight one good-sized sliced onion, three table- spoonfuls of shred parsley, a tablespoonful of strips of parsley root about an inch long, a dessertspoonful of horseradish shavings, twelve peppercorns, a good tea- spoonful of salt, and a pinch of paprica. Cover with cold water, bring slowly to the boil, skim, then simmer slowly for an hour, and strain. Then put on the fire again and reduce to half the quantity. Into this hot broth (using another stewpan for the operation) put the fillets with six freshly cut bunches of parsley (which should be previously blanched in scalded water for three minutes) and simmer gently for about ten minutes until the fillets are tender. A spoon, instead of a fish knife, as well as the fork, are necessary to eat this dish comfortably. Borju-sult. (Stewed Veal). Cut up in squares a pound of veal meat taken from the side of the knuckle, and add to this meat an equal quantity of loin of pork. Cut an onion into dice, put it into a flat stewpan with lard, add half a bay-leaf, sprinkle over paprica and fry it a little, then add the meats ; season, fry the meats for seven or eight minutes, cover the stewpan, draw it over a moderate fire, and stew the meats with warm ashes on the lid, stirring from time to time. When done, baste them simply with two tablespooniuls of brown sauce, or some glaze ; dish them up in a border of plain boiled rice.

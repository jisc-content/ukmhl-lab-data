Strain, and rub as much through a sieve as possible ; add this to the polenta and the water it was boiled in. Season with paprica pepper and salt, heat up, and serve. If the colour is not very rich add some cochineal. Calcan Prajit. (Baked Turbot.) Clean and wash a small turbot; thickly butter a shallow baking dish ; place some slices of onion at the bottom, and lay the fish on them. Put in a few sliced mushrooms, a couple of bay leaves, two or three cloves, salt and pepper to taste. Moisten to height with an equal quantity of white wine and water.

BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS Puaa. (Baked Pig.) Dig a hole in the ground, line it with stones, and kindle a fierce fire on the top. After this has been burning for some hours, take a pig which has been killed and properly cleaned in the usual manner, roll it on the top of the hot stones, and sear the skin so that it can be easily removed. Cut open and make a second cut under the fore shoulder. Remove the fire from the top of the stones, put some of the latter inside the pig, fine the stones with ti and banana leaves, and place the pig therein. Place leaves on top, a mat on top of the leaves, and last of all some earth on the top of the mat. At the end of some two or three hours, according to the size of the pig, it will be cooked.

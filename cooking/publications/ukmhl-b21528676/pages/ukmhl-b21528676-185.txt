FRANCE (North) 149 aromatics, and a few peppercorns ; moisten with a glass of good white wine, and a few fresh cut tomatoes. Cover, and boil them for ten iniuntes ; then drain, take out the thick part of the tails, and pound with a little broth the remainder of the crayfish with some dry rolls, six ounces of rice boiled dry, and two anchovies. Dilute the pre- paration with the crayfish liquor and a quart and a half of veal or fish broth, pass the soup twice, season highly, warm it well without letting it boil, and add to it the crayfish tails cut in pieces, a pinch of cayenne, and a cupful of wine. Pour the soup into the tureen ; and send up separately some small croutons of bread fried in butter. Fillets de Soles a la Marguery. (Fillets of Soles ) Fillet a thick sole and place the fillets in a buttered dish. Season them with pepper and salt, and a pinch of nutmeg ; then pour over sufficient good white wine to cover them. Cover with a sheet of white kitchen paper, buttered on one side ; put the dish to cook in a very hot oven for a few minutes. Drain the fillets well, and place them on a dish (silver or china). Take the liquor in which the fillets have cooked, the yolks of four and four ounces of butter, and stir over a very slow fire to prevent curdling, stirring all the time. When the eggs and liquor have caught, it is ready. The sauce thus made is finished by mixing with it a good piece of shrimp butter. Sauce au vin blanc thus prepared is called sauce riche.

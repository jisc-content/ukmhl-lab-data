Reduce ten pounds of milk to a fourth of its bulk by boiling on a slow fire, so as to get a good thick cream, and put it into a towel and hang up to drip. When it is well drained take a chatty (deep dish or pan) and tie a rough towel over it. Then put a lump of the curd and a handful of sugar on the towel, and with the hand press the mixture through the towel into the chatty ; continue doing this till all the curds are finished and three pounds of sugar used. Mix a thimble- ful of saffron with a little milk, and add it along with a few ground cardamoms and some small pieces of broken sugar candy to the mixture. Hulluah. (Cinnamon Sweet.) Soak one pound of roughly ground wheat till the water is of a thickish milky nature. Strain this through a coarse cloth into a pan, in which you will also put half a pound of sugar. Boil till it begins to thicken (you must stir all the time); add six ounces of ghee in which you have boiled for five minutes six white cardamoms and six sticks of cinnamon. Continue stirring till mixture is thick. Remove seasonings ; take pot from the fire, whip till it is like foam and make into large rough balls.

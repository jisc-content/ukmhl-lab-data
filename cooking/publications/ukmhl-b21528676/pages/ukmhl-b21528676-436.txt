(Farced Ox-Palates). Fake five or six fillets of ox-palates, cooked ; trim them straight, divide each in two parts ; mask on one surface with a layer of cooked fine herbs finished with truffles and thickened with a little forcemeat. Roll the ox-palates round themselves into neat shapes like long, very thick corks ; keep them in shape by means of two small wooden skewers ; dip into beaten eggs and bread- crumb, and plunge into plenty of hot fat. When the paupiettes are drained, draw out the skewers, and range them pyramidwise on a folded napkin, and serve with macaroni. Macaroni. Put in a pot half a gallon of water, two ounces of butter, and an ounce of salt; when boiling, throw in a half-pound of macaroni, which boil until tender (say, for half an hour or more, if need be), being careful that it is not too much done. Lay it on a sieve to dry for one minute ; put it in a pan, with four spoonfuls of white sauce ; add half a teaspoonful of salt, a quarter ditto of pepper, and a little paprika (red pepper). Place the pan over the fire; when boiling, add two ounces each of grated Parmesan and Gruyere cheese and the pulp of two tomatoes ; toss round and round till well mixed, then serve with a gill of strong gravy round it.

SICILY 579 back again, and lay the dish upon it; then turn it over again and take off the mould, and serve immediately with the sauce in a sauceboat. Duck, wild duck, teal, larks, partridges and pheasants may thus be prepared. It is usual to put the game in whole, though many cut them in pieces, which is more convenient for those who serve at table. Pudino-ti Vermicelli. (Vermicelli Pudding.) Wash six ounces of vermicelli, and simmer it in water till it is tender, but not soft, and strain it. Beat up five yolks and two whites of eggs, stir into them a very little salt and pepper, and half a pint of good sweet cream. Mince, but not too finely, the skinned breast of a cold fowl and rather less of a dressed lean ham. Crate about an ounce and a half of Parmesan cheese over the mince, and mix the whole ingredients well together with the vermicelli. Butter and fill a melon- shaped or other pudding dish, and steam till thoroughly done. Turn the pudding carefully out, and serve it hot, with a strong clear gravy flavoured with onions, parsley, and a little tarragon. Fritata Siciliana. (Pancakes Glazed.) Put into a small stewpan one ounce of dried sifted flour, two ounces of fine sugar, two ounces of sweet macaroons, and a pinch of candied orange- flowers ; crush, and mix the whole with five yolks of eggs, half a quart of double cream, and a grain of salt, which thus affords a clearer paste than the common pancakes.

PUNJAB (Brahmin) Am Kustel. (Mango Fool.) Remove the skin and stones from six green mangoes, cut them in quarters, and steep for several hours in cold water. Drain carefully, and put in clean cold water and boil till quite tender, then pass them through a sieve. Put them into another pan, sweeten to taste, and add very gradually (stirring all the time) as much rich milk as will reduce the pulp to the consistency of a good custard. A few grains of white cardamoms may be added along with the sugar. Rasgullah. (Milk Croquettes.) Six tumblers of milk, lemons sufficient in number. Boil the milk, and squeeze the lemons in till milk curdles. Pour the mass into a muslin bag, and hang it up till all the water is away. Then make it up into small balls, with an almond and a few cardamom seeds in the centre of each. Roll the balls in flourâ€”just enough to keep the particles together. Fry these in ghee or butter till brown, then put them in syrup for a day, and serve. Pera. (Rose Tablet.) Take a pound of milk, the same quantity of sugar, and boil them candy high. Remove the pan from the fire, stir in a few drops of cochineal and attar of roses, and beat till all is thick and creamy. Pour on to an oiled dish, and when nearly cold cut into small round cakes about an inch and a half in diameter. 35i

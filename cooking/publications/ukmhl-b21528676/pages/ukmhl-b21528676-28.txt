INTRODUCTION TO THE MENUS xxiv men, advocates, lawyers, doctors, artists, musicians, and literary and other professional men. The Association, though not specifically academic, is thus largely comprised of men who have studied at Edinburgh or other Universities. The Club has had the honour of counting as its guests not a few scholars, scientists, thinkers and poets of world-wide fame. The evening’s function consists of a “quantum suff” dinner, not too prolonged, followed by a varied round of cheerful conversation, songs and glees, solo and concerted music, pathetic and merry recitations, stories and interludes of many kinds. The Club has no political or other party colouring, and exists only for its periodic social gatherings. It was a Southron who sang:— “We may live without poetry, music, and art, We may live without conscience and live without heart, We may live without friends ; we may live without books ; But civilised man cannot live without cooks.” The Scottish philosophy repudiates with horror the hideous materialistic maxim “Man ist, was er isst.” The Scotsman remains a Scotsman, whether he lives on dough-nut or damper, on bread-fruit or birds’ nest soup; and he will be a Scotsman still when he is reduced to pure nectar and ambrosia. The Cap and Gown Club exists to prove that the proper enjoyment of accomplished services of the most cunning cooks— CAPULET : “ Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning; cooks ! ” Second Servant : “You shall have none ill, Sir.” are not to be thought of as possible apart from poetry, music, and art, apart from friends or (ma conscience) heart !

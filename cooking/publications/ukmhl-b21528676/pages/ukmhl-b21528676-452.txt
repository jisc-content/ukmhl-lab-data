BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 416 Chavvan. (Fish Consomme.) Make a strong fish stock with the trimmings of any white fish, also three or four soles (keeping the fillets to clear). Only salt and a pinch of mignonette pepper must be put in the water when making the stock. Skim and strain the stock very carefully through a fine cloth. Pound the fillets with the whites of two eggs, stir them in the liquor, replace the pot on the fire, and simmer for a few minutes. Strain again as clear as crystal. Serve the soup in little bowls, with a piece of cooked mushroom floating on the top. See that the mushrooms are free of any loose matter, so as not to spoil the colour of the soup. Yakiyakana. (Grilled Salmon.) Rub with soy some fillets of salmon, and grill them in front or over the fire. Serve on small flat saucers with horse-radish sauce. Horse-radish Sauce. Grate two tablespoonfuls of horse-radish, and mix with it a tablespoonful of soy, two tablespoonfuls of lime juice, a suspicion of garlic, a teaspoonful of sugar, and a tablespoonful of water. Sashimi. (Raw Fishâ€”living.) Take a small live bream and put it on a dish. Carve thin slices and serve on small flat saucers with scraped horse-radish and soy mixed, also cucumbers sliced very thin.

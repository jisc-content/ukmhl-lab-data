BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 148 Pot-au-feu. (Clear Soup.) If the soup is wanted for seven or eight persons, choose a rump of beef weighing about six pounds. Having washed it in cold water, bone and put it into an earthen- stockpot, with giblets of poultry and a little knuckle of veal; let these meats be steeped in seven or eight quarts of cold water, observing that the stockpot should be about full; add a small handful of salt, and set this stockpot on a moderate fire, gradually bringing the hquid to ebullition.

Two hours after the liquid begins to boil, add to it the half of a blanched crisped colewort, a large onion—coloured in the oven, four new carrots, three leeks, a large turnip cut up, a celery root, and a parsnip. The meat being nearly done, add to it a bunch of chervil, a few cloves, half a bay-leaf ; let it boil continually.

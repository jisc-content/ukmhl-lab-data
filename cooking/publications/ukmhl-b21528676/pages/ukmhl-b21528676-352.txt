BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS Annah. (Rice.) Wash rice thoroughly and steep for half an hour; plunge it into furiously boiling water, stirring lightly to keep the grains separate. When nearly soft, drain and return to the pot to dry, stirring occasionally to keep it from adhering. Serve in a large bowl. Byalleh. (Boiled Lentils.) Wash and boil the lentils, drain off the water (keep it), and return lentils to the pot. They should be thoroughly boiled—not too pulpy, but much of the same consistency as boiled rice. Serve in a. large bowl. Vanghee Bath. (Pillau of Egg-Plant.) Take one pound of egg-plants which wash, divide each into four, and fry in boiling ghee, remove the portions and place to the one side. Wash one pound of rice, dry it, then fry in the same ghee. In a separate pan fry the following in ghee :—Five ounces sliced onions and four garlic points, half ounce stick of cinnamon, half ounce of cloves, three ounces of cardamoms, half ounce cinnamon leaves. Then put the fried condiments amongst the rice, and add sufficient water to more than cover the rice. Boil all this till the rice is three-quarters done, and then add the fried egg- plant to it, with two cupfuls of cocoanut milk, six or seven green chillies pounded to a paste, six ounces skinned almonds, three ounces rosewater, a pounded red chilli, and a pinch of saffron (just enough to colour) ; 3l6

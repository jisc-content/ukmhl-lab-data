BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 382 Put the pan on the stove for six minutes until the contents arc of a golden colour, and add two raw peeled tomatoes cut into pieces, three tablespoonfuls of Spanish sauce, a pinch of salt, half a pinch of pepper, and one crushed clove of garlic. Put in the okras, cover with the lid, and cook for fifteen minutes, slowly. Turn out on to a hot, deep dish, sprinkle over a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, and serve with plain boiled rice. The latter must be quite dry. Fillet of Widgeon. Draw and truss a brace of widgeon; put a skewer through them, and roast before a good fire for a quarter of an hour, basting with a brush dipped in a little oil. When they are done, salt them a little, slip the fillets off, and put them into a flat stewpan with a little glaze at the bottom. Place them over a brisk fire for a minute so that the moisture of the fillets will eva- porate ; then arrange them on a dish in a circle, pour orange sauce over them, and serve. Wild duck and teal may be cooked the same way. Orange Sauce. Peel half an orange, removing all the white pith ; cut the skin into slices, then in thin strips ; put them in a gill of water to boil for two minutes ; drain on a sieve, and throw the water away. Place in a pan two spoonfuls of demi-glaze, and when boiling add the orange strips and the juice, a little sugar, a little made mustard, and a pinch of cayenne. Simmer ten minutes, skim, and serve.

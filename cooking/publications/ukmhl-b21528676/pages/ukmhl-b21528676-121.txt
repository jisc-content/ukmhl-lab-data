BULGARIA 85 sliced carrot, and the partridges on top. Fill the pan with good stock half up to the birds, and add a bunch of savoury herbs, a large bay leaf, some mild red pepper, and a little salt when nearly finished. Clear the gravy and stir in a cup of very thick sour cream and the same quantity of cullis of partridge, place all on the fire and finish cooking. Serve with fried potatoes and dressed salad. Cullis of Partridge. Pound roasted partridges ; take a piece of veal cut into slices, with a bit of ham, put these into a stewpan with onions, and a carrot cut into bits ; stew until it sticks, then moisten with good broth and gravy ; season with a slice of lemon, a little sweet basil and mushrooms, and again stew very softly. This done, strain, skim the fat well off (let it be of a good taste), and mix your par- tridges with it, together with a ladleful of stock cullis; strain, and use it with any soups or stews. Omelet sâ€™ Sladko. (Sweet Omelet.) Beat up eight eggs and add a little finely chopped lemon peel and a little castor sugar. Melt a good-sized piece of butter in a frying pan, or omelet pan, pour the beaten egg in, and fry both sides a light brown. Have ready a hot dish well sprinkled with castor sugar, score the omelet in lines like a herring-bone by holding a red- hot poker close to it; dish, sprinkle castor sugar over, and serve with any melted preserve poured over, flavoured with creme de menthe, or with thick sour milk whipped to a foam in a sauce boat.

CHINA (North-West) Liu hsia ren. (Shrimp Mayonnaise.) Put one pint of sauce, similar to Bechamel, only using oil instead of butter, into a saucepan with four mush- rooms, one truffle, and the meat from a dozen large shrimps, all chopped up very small. Thicken well, and let it cook for five minutes, and when cold divide into small fancy shapes. Tan fen kao. (Eggs in Aspic.) Set a plain border mould in ice, and have ready suffi- cient warm savoury aspic jelly coloured green to fill in. Cut some eggs in quarters, and dip them in the jelly, and stick them round the interior of the mould, whites and yolks alternately. Fill up with the eggs and aspic. Turn out. Chi Kan. (Chicken Livers.) After steeping well in clean water, put some chicken livers in a pan with some good stock, seasoning well with aromatic spices. Stew very slowly. Take equal weight of boiled pork fat with some more seasonings, including pepper and salt, and pound all together to a smooth paste. Make up into nicely shaped squares, and serve neatly on a dish. Yen hwang kwa. (Pickled Cucumbers.) Take some small cucumbers, and cut into two-inch lengths, and pour over while hot some strongly spiced vinegar. When cool, bottle and cork tightly. 93 /

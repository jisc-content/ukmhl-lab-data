Give them a good shake each time before putting them out in tho morning. Mince small the dried limes. Pound in good vinegar twenty-five dry dates, fifteen large dry red chillies, three whole peeled garlics, and one ounce of green ginger. Mix all together and sweeten with sugar, first adding to it the strained juice of twenty-five limes. It will be ready in a week. A cool oven will do in place of the sun. Kullah Yekhanee.

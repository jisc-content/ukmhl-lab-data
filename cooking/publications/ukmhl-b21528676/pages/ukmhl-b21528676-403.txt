Make a paste of two pounds of fine flour of gram (the flour of the very small white pea will do), one pound of ghi, and a quarter ounce of salt; boil in a deep frying- pan two and a half lbs. of ghi; pour the paste with a cup into a strainer with big holes, and press it with a small pestle so as to get small round grains like peas into the boiling ghi.

Boil five pounds of sugar till nearly candy high and put the boondi in it. and make into balls as large as small apples. Angir Marabba. (Fig Preserve.)

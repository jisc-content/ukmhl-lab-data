BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 458 add water and good vinegar, and place in a pan with a point of garlic, two laurel leaves, one whole onion, a slice of lemon, pepper and salt to taste. Bring to the boil, skim carefully, then place at the side of the fire to simmer from two to three hours. Strain the liquor, add a little browning, and reduce the whole to a semi-glaze, which pour over the meat. Serve with boiled potatoes and vegetables. Coles Morados. (Browned Cauliflower.) Semi-boil a cauliflower, and break up into nice branches. Peel and core six green apples, which place with the cauliflower in a pan with one pint of milk, four ounces of butter, and a seasoning of pepper and salt. Simmer on a slow fire till all are tender. Pour into a dish, and brown in a sharp oven. If there is too much liquid, thicken with the yolks of eggs. Barquillo de Papas. (Potato Pudding.) Take half a pound of mashed potatoes (they ought really to be sweet potatoes), four ounces of butter, four eggs, a quarter pint of milk, three tablespoonfuIs of sherry, half a saltspoonful of salt, the juice of one small lemon, the rind minced up very fine, two ounces of sugar, a handful of stoned raisins, and the same quantity of chopped blanched almonds. Mix all well together and put into a buttered pie-dish, and bake for rather more than half an hour. Ten minutes before it is ready pour a well-whipped egg over, and finish cooking.

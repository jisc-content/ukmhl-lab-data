BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS Rasvarennaya Riba. (Stewed Fish.) Make a highly-seasoned fish or chicken broth, flavoured with nutmeg and cleared with the white of an egg before straining. Into this put a sterlet (a carp or piece of sturgeon will do) cut up into suitable pieces, pour in a little cold water, and cook over a moderate fire until the fish is done, taking care to remove any scum that rises. Turn the whole into a pan, in which it is to be stewed, having placed slices of lemon (without pips or peel) at the bottom, pour in champagne (cider will do) ; boil up once more, strain, then clear the sauce with caviare or the white of an egg. Add some chopped parsley or'fennel, and pour over the fish or serve in a separate sauce-boat. Coulebiaka. (Fish Pie.) Take out the fillets of two small trout, and of eight small perch ; season with pepper and salt, add one dozen crayfish tails, and keep them on ice. With a quarter pound of pike, or whiting flesh, prepare some quenelle forcemeat; when passed through a sieve, put it into a stewpan, and add two ounces of butter ; season, and close the stewpan hermetically, keeping it at the entrance of the oven for ten minutes, then remove back, and let it cool.

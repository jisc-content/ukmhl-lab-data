437 KURDISTAN Pirindj Pilawi. (Pillau of Rice.) Put on the fire a clean saucepan with a quarter of a pound of butter ; let this boil on the fire till it frizzles; add a quart and a half of water; let it boil. Wash two pounds of rice in two or three waters, rubbing it in your hands ; strain off the water; put the rice into the sauce- pan with the boiling water, adding a little salt. Put a wooden spoon in the middle, and if it will stand straight without being held the water is enough, but if it falls there is too much water. Cover the pan close with a lid, and let it cook on a slow fire without stirring it. When it is ready, after an hour’s cooking, take the end of a spoon and stir it; every particle will be separate. Pour some melted butter over it, and serve very hot. Tchorba Yakhxie. (Soup and Boiled Mutton.) Put a leg of mutton in a large pot with plenty of water, and skim very carefully. Lift the meat out after an hour and a half’s very gentle boiling ; cover it up to keep warm ; take the lid off the pot, and suffer the liquor to evaporate by rapid boiling till what remains is strong and good, and the broth a proper consistence. Cut some carrots and turnips into small slices, and put these with a head of celery sliced, or a little parsley shred, to the broth, and boil gently for an hour longer. Serve the soup, mutton, and rice in equal portions of one for each two guests.

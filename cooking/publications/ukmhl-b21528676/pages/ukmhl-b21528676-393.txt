PUNJAB (Mussulman) 357 Korma. (Curried Mutton.) Eight ounces of good thick milk curd, two tablespoon- fuls of curry powder, a pinch of cayenne, five ounces of bruised sweet almonds, two or three bay leaves, a table- spoonful of water, the juice of five lemons, twelve large onions cut lengthwise into fine slices, three-quarters of a pound of butter or ghee, and a teaspoonful of salt. Cut two pounds of good fat mutton into pieces an inch square. Fry the sliced onions in half of the ghee, and put in another dish ; then fry the curry powder and pepper in the pan with the ghee. When quite brown, throw in the mutton and salt, and allow the whole to brown, after which add the water, spices, pepper, and bay leaves, the lemon juice, and the fried onions finely chopped ; close the pot and allow it to simmer over a gentle fire for about an hour and a half or two hours, by which time the mutton will be quite ready. When just about finished, remove the bay leaves and add the rest of the ghee; then put in the milk curd, which must be good and thick, giving it all a stir round, and finish cooking. Eat with kacliauri (lentil croquettes), rice, and chutnies. Kachauri. (Lentil Croquettes.) Make some cakes the same as in “ Puri,” but not so large.

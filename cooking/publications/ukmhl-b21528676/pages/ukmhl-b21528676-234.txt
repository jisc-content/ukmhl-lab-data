Grate five cocoanuts, pour a quart and a half of boiling water over it, and stand for fifteen minutes ; squeeze through a cloth, and mix with grated taro ; add a little water—about a pint of water to a quart of cocoanut juice. Add a little sugar. Use two taro roots to five cocoanuts. Mix well together, put the mass into ti leaves, and bake with other meats. Koele Palau. (Potato Pudding.) Pound and mash some sweet potatoes which have.been baked under ground or well boiled, and mix, while hot, with the juice of grated cocoanut ; set aside till cold, and it is ready for eating. Haupia. (Arrowroot Blanc Mange.) Mix arrowroot with the juice of grated cocoanut. Heat some of the juice, and, when very hot, stir it into the mass. Set aside to cool. This somewhat resembles blanc-mange. Luau. (Stewed Taro Leaves.) Clean the leaves from young plants, and boil till tender, and mash and serve same as spinach — which it very much resembles.

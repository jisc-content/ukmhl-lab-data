TURKESTAN 649 Khochgan Ivaimak Tukham. (Whipped Cream and Eggs.) Sweeten one quart of milk with castor sugar and put it over the fire until boiling. Whisk the whites of six eggs to a stiff froth, drop the froth in small quantities into the milk, turn them over once or twice, then take out, and lay them on a fine hair sieve to drain. When all the white of egg has been used, beat the yolks of the six eggs and stir them into the milk, adding more sugar if required. Stir the cream at the edge of the fire until thick, but without letting it boil, or the eggs will curdle ; then turn it into a basin and stir it occasionally until half cold. Flavour the cream with a few drops of rose- water and half a wineglassful of brandy ; turn it into a glass or fancy china dish, and arrange the poached whites of eggs on the top.

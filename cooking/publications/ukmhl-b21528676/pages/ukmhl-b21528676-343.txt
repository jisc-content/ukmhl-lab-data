MADRAS (Hindu) 307 ounces of rice flour ; knead it well. Roll out in about twenty-four very thin pancakes of the size of a cheese plate. The thinner they are the better. Roast or bake separately one pound castor sugar, half pound ground cocoanut, and quarter ounce ground cardamoms till they get red brown in colour. Take one pancake and spread over it some of the baked castor sugar, cocoanut, and cardamoms; put another pancake upon it, spread again, and continue till you have made one pancake of four, then fry it in boiling ghee. Six pancakes are thus made. Badam, Phul Mithai. (Pistachio, Almond, and Raisin Tablet.) Boil two pounds of sugar and three ounces of ghee in a pound of water to crackling height. Meanwhile, having reduced three pounds of milk to a fourth of its bulk by boiling, remove the boiled sugai from the fiie, stir in the milk along with five ounces each of chopped pistachios, almonds, and sultana raisins ; keep stirring till thick and creamy; colour slightly with the juice of spinach ; then pour out into oiled forms, or a deep dish, in which case you would cut it into lengths when nearly cold. Rojapoovu Mittayee. (Rose Tablet.) Proceed exactly the same as in Lemon Tablet, only substituting attar of roses and carmine colour for lemon essence and saffron colour.

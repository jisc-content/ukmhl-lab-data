Boil for a few minutes. Have ready a shred white cabbage and a cauliflower broken into small branches, some small white radishes, young French beans (stringed), small gherkins, and small silver onions. Pour boiling brine over them, and let steep for three days. Drain and dry in a cloth, and then thoroughly dry on a sieve in front of the fire. Place this in bottles with the vinegar.

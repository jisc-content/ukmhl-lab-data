CENTRAL PROVINCES (Brahmin) 269 Bhat. (Rice.) Wash the rice thoroughly, and, having put it in a pot, add water until it reaches a level about three inches higher than the rice. Boil until rice is soft, then cover the pot and leave it on the hot embers until the fire dies out. No water is poured off, and nothing else is added. Dahl. (Lentils.) First boil the water, and when fully boiling put in some split lentils and allow them to become soft. After putting in the lentils, and when boiling point is again reached, add a little turmeric powder. Allow the con- tents to simmer half an hour, stir well, add hot water, and some salt. Aloobhat. (Curried Rice and Potatoes.) Half pound of rice, one pound potatoes. Wash rice well, and cut potatoes into thin slices. Put rice in four ounces boiling ghee, stir a little, and then take out. Put a thin layer of this rice in a pot, and place upon it a thin layer of raw potato. Again rice and again potato, and so on until material is used up. Put the pot upon a slow fire. Another pot full of water is placed upon the first, so that the vapour from the first mav condense and fall back into the lower pot. Finally salt, chillies, cloves, and cinnamon are added on removing from fire.

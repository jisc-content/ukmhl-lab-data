SCOTLAND 539 tureen before pouring in the soup. The liquid should be of a consistency between a clear soup and a thick one. Teased Skate. Take the dried wing of a skate, and after stripping off the skin cut it into lengths of about one inch in breadth. Put the fish so prepared into water, and boil for the space of twenty minutes, after which let it be put into the oven, where it should remain a quarter of an hour, during which time it will become so tender as to permit the bones to be drawn out. The flesh being now detached from the bones, put it into a cloth, and rub with the hands till it puts on a woolly appearance, which it will soon do. In a saucepan reduce half a pound of butter into oil, put the teased fish into it, and keep stirring for a few minutes. When sufficiently heated, serve up. Baked Stappit Haddies. Thoroughly clean the insides, scrape the skins, and stuff some small haddocks with a forcemeat made of fish, toasted oatmeal, minced suet, onions, seasoned with pepper and salt (some of the forcemeat may be made into balls for garnishing). Brush the fish over with egg, strew with fine breadcrumbs, minced parsley, etc., and bake in the oven, basting them well with butter. Garnish with sliced lemon, forcemeat balls, and pickled samphire. Serve with mussel or white sauce.

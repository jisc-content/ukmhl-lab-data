BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 422 spoonful of vinegar, and a pinch of mustard, pepper, and sugai. Serve small portions on flat saucers. The modem custom is to use mayonnaise instead of the above dressing. Mochi. (Rice Cakes.) In order to make the mochi one will choose the mochi rice, which is different from ordinary rice, though the latter will do. First soak the rice in cold water, after having washed it clean by steeping overnight; then put it in a steamer and steam it thoroughly by placing a layer of rice on two or three sieves which will fit on top of one another. Close the top one, and place it on a pot of boiling water, and seal the edge so that all the steam will pass through the sieves ; or use an ordinary set of steamers. When the rice is cooked, mash it thoroughly in a wooden mortar till it becomes a smooth tenacious paste. Then put it on a board where ground rice flour has been spread, and roll up into sets of four round cakes, which put on top of one another, the lowest one being about two inches in diameter and one inch thick ; the others are gradually smaller until the top one is like a pigeon’s egg. They are called okagami, and are only served on New Year’s feast day and the following seven or fourteen days of the year, on the shrine of the “family god,” and after the first seven days are over the family circle enjoy these cakes. When the seven days are over they are toasted and put into chicken soup.

BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 464 Boil four ounces of oil in a frying pan over a slow fire. When bubbling add half an ounce of sweet red pepper powder and a little water. The fish being filleted, put them on the bottom of a stewpan, cover with chopped green coriander leaves, three points of garlic, breadcrumbs, and salt; pour half a pint of water on the oil and let it boil for ten minutes. Cool and pour into a stewpan, being careful not to wash the breadcrumbs, etc., off. Keep out the red pepper sediment ; throw it away. The dish will be ready in from twenty minutes to half an hour if kept covered. See that it does not burn. A slow fire is preferable. Serve with sliced oranges. Haman bi-louz. (Broiled Pigeons.) Clean and truss some pigeons, make a stuffing of semi- boiled rice and chopped almonds, and season with aromatic spices, pepper and salt, and fry in plenty of butter. When cooked, strain the gravy, add some water, and thicken slightly with a little flour. Blanch some almonds, and put them in the gravy, which serve with the pigeons, along with bread and salt. Kabab. (Grilled Liver.) Cut half a pound of calfâ€™s liver into pieces the size of a two-shilling piece, a quarter of an inch thick ; also cut a quarter of a pound of fat into pieces half of that size. Roll all in mixed coriander, cumin powder and parsley, pepper and salt, and thread alternately on skewers. Broil over a slow clear fire. Turn occasionally, and serve (if possible on the skewers) with hot new bread.

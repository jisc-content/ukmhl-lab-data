BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 194 Paghoton Anthous Portoicaleas (Orange Blossom Ice.) Bruise to a paste a pound of very fresh pistachios in a mortar, with a handful of sugar. Dilute with two pints of nearly cold English cream; let it infuse for half an hour ; pass the preparation through a sieve, and freeze in the usual manner. Ten minutes previous to dressing the ice, gradually introduce into it five or six tablespoonfuls of genuine orange-blossoms (eau de fleurs dâ€™oranger), previously mixed up with a little cold syrup and a little of the pre- paration. Now dish the ice in a rock shape on a folded napkin.

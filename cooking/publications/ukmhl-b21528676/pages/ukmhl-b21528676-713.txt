R.H.C.â€™s 677 Add three glasses of Jamaica rum and serve in sauce- boat. Savoury Grece. Place twelve freshlv-opened medium-sized oysters with their liquor in a pan with three-quarters of a gill of white wine, and just bring to boiling point. Skim well, remove the beards, squeeze them in a tammy cloth to extract the juice, and strain with the lest of the liquor. Heat in a saucepan one tablespoonful of melted butter, add a quarter chopped seeded sweet pepper, one finely-chopped shallot, and one finely- chopped well-peeled and cleaned fresh mushroom , then gently brown for five minutes, stirring once in a while. Stir in one tablespoonful of flour till quite smooth for half a minute ; add the strained oyster liquor, three tablespoonfuls of cream, two saltspoonfuls of salt, a quarter saltspoonful of cayenne, and half a pinch of grated nutmeg, then gently simmer for six minutes. Remove the pan to the side of the fire, put in the oysters cut in quarters, with a squeeze of lemon, a dozen and a half freshly boiled and shelled shrimps cut in small pieces. Mix well, seeing that the mixture is kept hot but not cooking. Fill six oyster shells with this ; strew some very fine breadcrumbs on top and push into a fierce oven to brown lightly, or brown with a salamander. If to be served cold add two leaves of gelatine in place of half of the flour (omit breadcrumbs). Fill moulds, and turn out when cold and decorate with aspic jelly.

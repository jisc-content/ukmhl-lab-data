BENGAL (Hindu) 237 Egg Plant Chutney. Roast a couple of good large egg plants, remove the seeds, and pound the flesh to a smooth paste with a teaspoonful each of mustard oil and salt, and then mix with onions, red chillies, curd, and lime juice, as given in potato chutney, only using two limes instead of one. Tamarind Chutney. Stone two pounds of ripe tamarinds and put in a glazed pot with two ounces each of ground red chillies, garlic, and green ginger, one ounce of ground cinnamon, four ounces of cleaned currants, four ounces of sultana raisins, two ounces salt, one pound of soft sugar, and one pint of vinegar. If not enough of the latter to cover all the ingredients, add more. Put on a good fire to stew fairly quick. Care must be taken to stir continuously the contents of the pan till the mixture is thick. Remove from the fire, and when cold it can be bottled for future use.

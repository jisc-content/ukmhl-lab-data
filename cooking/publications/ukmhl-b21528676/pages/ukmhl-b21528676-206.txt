BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 170 Rub the inside of a basin with a clove of garlic, pul in it the yokes of four or five eggs, and mash them to a smooth paste with a spoon ; then add one teaspoonful of mustard, one teacupful of oil, a little vinegar, and some pepper and salt. Drain the celery roots and truffles, and mix them with the eggs. Turn into a salad-bowl, sprinkle over a little chopped tarragon and cloves, and serve. Puffer. (Potato Pancakes). Boil some potatoes, grate and pass through a sieve, and mix with them a good seasoning of grated onions, pepper and salt to taste, and some whipped eggs and milk. Fry the mixture in butter similar to the way you would do small round pancakes, and serve hot with a salad. Gebackene Schwetnebrust. (Baked Breast of Pork.) Take a breast of pickled pork, four or five pounds in weight, cut it open and stuff with dried fruits, such as prunes, apples, pears, apricots, etc,., which have been steeped for some time. Sew up, and make into a good shape. Put in a pan on the top of some cut carrots, onions, and celery root, and pour over melted butter. Then put breadcrumbs over, and bake in the oven for two to two-and-a-half hours, and serve with potato dumplings and brown or a sweet sauce.

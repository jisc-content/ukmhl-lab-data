ENGLAND Venison Pasties. Chop fine as much cold roasted venison as will fill a breakfast cup, mix it with nearly one ounce of sifted bread crumbs, and a seasoning of chopped parsley, powdered mace, and a very little grated lemon peel. Place on the fire, in a saucepan, half-a-pint of good gravy, well thickened with browned flour, and stir into it a teaspoonful of currant jelly, When the jelly is well stirred into the gravy, add the meat and bread crumbs, when it is pretty hot take it from the fire and stir in a beaten egg. Let the mixture cool, then make a good puff paste, cut in squares, and put some of the mixture in the middle, fold over three-corner ways, press the edges, brush with the yolk of an egg, and fire in oven. Arrange them on a hot dish, and garnish with fried parsley and sliced lemon. Serve with them in a sauceboat some good brown game sauce. Game Sauce. fake a spoonful of the dripping which came from the venison when roasted (a cupful of good game stock will do as well). Put on the fire with some browned flour, a bit of butter, two glasses of claret, and dessert- spoonful of red currant jelly, a little salt, cayenne, a squeeze of lemon. Bring all to the boil, and, if necessary, pass through a tammy cloth.

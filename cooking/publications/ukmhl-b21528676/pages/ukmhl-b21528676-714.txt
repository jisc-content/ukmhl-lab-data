678 LXXXVII.—COOKING IN PAPER BAGS. Cooking en papillote, under its new name of “ paper bag cookery,” having created some little stir in the gas- tronomic world, I have given a few suggestions which may be of assistance to those who desire to adopt an old fashion in a slightly more elaborate form. Meats, poultry, and fish can be successfully roasted, boiled, stewed, grilled, and fried in small quantities, but for elaborate made-up dishes and sauces, the paper bag is useless. Bags can be bought from any first-class ironmonger, but if a little tiouble is not objected to, and cheapness is desired, equally good results can be got by folding grease- proof paper to the desired shape, and hermetically sealing it by first folding the edges and fastening with flat paper clips. Hundreds of the plainer recipes in this book can be adapted to Paper Bag Cookery; but make sure that the following particulars are observed :— 1. The oven must be heated up to 300 degrees Fahren- heit before putting in the food, and seven minutes after lowered to 150 degrees, or place a piece of paper in the oven, and if it browns, it is hot enough. 2. Well grease the foods with oil, butter, or dripping before putting them in the bag, then seal it hermeti- cally with clips. 3. On no account put the bag on a solid iron shelf in the oven (gas or kitchen range). It must be placed on the bars of the oven, or on a trivet or gridiron, to ensure an even heat all round the paper. 4. When water is put in the bag, it is not necessary to grease it or the foods.

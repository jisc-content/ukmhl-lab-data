BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 566 half teaspoonful of powdered cinnamon, and a very small quantity of powdered cloves. Put half a pound of honey into a lined saucepan, place it over the fire till hot, but without letting it boil, then stir it in with the in- gredients in the basin, flavoured with attar of roses, and knead all well together. Cover the basin with a cloth and leave the paste for an hour. At the end of that time dredge a small quantity of flour over the table, put the paste on it, and roll it out about one inch thick, first mixing a quarter of a pound of chopped almonds in the dough. Lay the paste on a greased baking dish, and bake in a moderate oven with blanched and halved almonds spread on top. Kanam San Kaja. (Cocoanut Custard.) Grate a cocoanut and pour over a pint of boiling water, and after it has steeped for fifteen minutes strain off all the moisture. Again pour a pint of water over the grated cocoanut and strain after fifteen minutes. Make a custard in the ordinary way with sugar and eggs, only using the cocoanut milk instead of the cowâ€™s. Fai Thong. (Golden Hair.) Boil six eggs hard. Remove the whites so that the yolks are not broken. Make a strong sweet syrup and pour over.

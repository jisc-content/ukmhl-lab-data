BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 478 Burjul. (Wheat Porridge.) W'ash and clean some wheat, then steep it for a day in clean water. Drain, and put into boiling water till soft, then dry in the sun till it becomes perfectly hard. Now roughly grind it, so that you can sift the husks from the grain. Then put the grain in a pot with boiling water and boil till soft; drain, and place on a dish, and sprinkle salt over. Put some olive oil in a pan and bring to boiling point; fry some very finely shred onions to a nice brown in this, and then pour this over the top of the boiled wheat, and stir all round till thoroughly mixed. Eat with soft bread and boiled meats. Soft Bread. A dough is made of flour and water. Knead it well, then take up a portion in the hands and beat it between them till very thin. Have a piece of iron considerably raised in the middle, heat this, and when very hot clap the thin cake on it, and when lightly browned turn quickly and do the other side the same way. Anzei. (Boiled Lamb.) Take a young lamb, turn its face to the east, and kill it by cutting the throat. Then, with a sharp-pointed stick, cut the skin and force it through the sinews, so that the killer can blow into it and separate the skin sufficiently to enable it to be torn from the whole body.

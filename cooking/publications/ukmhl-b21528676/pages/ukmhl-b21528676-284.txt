BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 248 Batatachi Bhaji, (Curried Potatoes,) Peel two pounds of potatoes and cut them into half- inch pieces, boil in water in which you have put a tea- spoonful of mustard seed, a shred red chilli, and a large teaspoonful of salt. When the potatoes are soft, drain, and pass through a sieve. Put in a tablespoonful of white pease flour, and a little of the water in which the potatoes were boiled. Bring all to the boil, stirring all the time so that the potatoes and flour amalgamate. Now boil two ounces of oil, in which fry quarter tea- spoonful of mustard seeds, and when they are crackling and dancing, be sure that you remove the pan from the fire at once. Pour this into the potato mixture, and stir well over the fire so that it is hot. The whole should be the consistenc}? of soft porridge. Gujarachi Bhaji. (Carrots.)

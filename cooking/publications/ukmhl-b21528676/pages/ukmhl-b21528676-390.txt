BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 354 Mahi Palao. (Fish Pillau.) Take two pounds white fish, one pound rice, nine ounces ghee, one pound goat’s flesh, and fifteen grains each of cinnamon, cardamoms, and cloves, half a pound of onions, seventy-five grains black pepper, three ounces curd, and half ounce salt. Cut the fish into pieces about two inches long and one broad, and steep in plenty of lemon juice. Cut the onions in fine slices and fry in half of the ghee. When nicely browned, place to the one side, and fry the condiments for two minutes, then brown the fish on both sides. In a separate pot boil one pound goat’s flesh in plenty of water till all the good is taken out of it, remove the meat, and put into the stock two pounds of rice. When the moisture is evaporated, and the rice tender, dish it; put the pieces of fish on top, then the condiments, and finish by pouring the rest of the ghee over, which has first been boiled for two or three minutes. Eat with bread and chutnies. Pataur ni Papeta. (Fried Potatoes.) Take some large potatoes and have them peeled and cleaned. Cut square pieces out of them, and have them fried in butter. When this is done, take some flour and put some salt as well as red and black pepper in it, and mix it with coagulated milk or curds (dahi), with which coat the pieces of potato and again have them fried, after which the pataur will be done. The milk may be curdled with rennet.

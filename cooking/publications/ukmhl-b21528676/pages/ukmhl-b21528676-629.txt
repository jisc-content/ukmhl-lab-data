To discover the proper degree, dip the point of the knife into the glaze, and, taking a little from it, roll it between your fingers ; if sufficiently down it will form itself into a ball, but if not it will stick to the fingers. If at the proper point, take off the stewpan and set it on one side for a quarter of an hour, that the glaze may more easily dissolve ; then fill it up with consomme or beef stock, and set it at the corner of the stove. (If no partridges can be obtained, the carcases of two rabbits, or one whole one, will afford an agreeable flavour.) When it boils, skim it, and make a roux (thickening) with four ounces of oil or butter, adding as much sifted flour as will make it a little stiff ; put it over a slow fire, and stir it often, that it may receive equally and gradually a light gold colour. Pour into this roux two ladlefuls of stock, stirring it continually (but remove it from the fire) till it becomes quite smooth, then add more stock, and sta- rt until smooth and well mixed ; then pour it back on the veal, add a bunch of parsley and shallot, with half a bay-leaf, a little thyme, two cloves, and, above all, some trimmings of rflushrooms. Let it go gently at the corner of the stove, skim it, and after an hourâ€™s boiling take off the fat, and after another hour and a half again skim it, and pass it through a tammy ; stir it occa- sionally with a spoon, that the surface may not be covered with a skin formed by the action of the air. Thus attended this should be an Espagnole of a good flavour, though not salt ; its colour a clear lively red, although light.

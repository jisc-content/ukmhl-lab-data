BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 174 Prinz Puckler Eis. (Prince Pickier Ice.) Beat the yolks of six eggs and put them on the fire in a pan. and pour in three-quarters of a pint of milk gradually, and half a pound of powdered sugar, and stir till it becomes thickish ; then pass it through a fine sieve. When cold, stir in a pint of well-whipped double cream, and freeze. \ ou will now divide the cream into three portions of (i) one-fourth, (2) one-half, (3) three- fourths. Into the first put some raspberry juice and enrich the colour with a little cochineal, and then press into an ice mould. Into the second put a good handful of pounded ratafia biscuits and a few drops of essence of sweet almonds, and press it in the mould on the top of No. 1 ; and into the third you will put a handful of finely chopped pistachio nuts, a glass of green chartreuse, and some green colouring, and put in the mould on top of No. 2. Cover very carefully, and pack in ice for three or four hours, and turn out in the usual way. Any of the foregoing combinations can be used as a single ice cream ; and others can be made by substituting peach, apricot, strawberry, pineapple, lemon, orange, chocolate, or coffee flavourings or pulps. If desired to make the ice lighter, leave out the custard, and use only whipped cream.

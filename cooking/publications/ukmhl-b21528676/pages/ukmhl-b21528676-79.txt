It should be cut into small thin slices, and placed in a stone jar in layers, alternating with chopped vege- tables, such as onions, carrots, turnips, French beans, soaked dried beans, peaches, sliced pumpkins, potatoes, and the grated rind of a lemon. Season each layer well with mixed spices, pepper, salt, and a suspicion of cayenne pepper, and a pounded clove of garlic. Pour over all two teacupfuls of water and one tablespoonful of tarragon vinegar, cover the jar, and put into a slow oven to stew for three or four hours.

BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 266 Tho-tha-jayv. (Fried Mutton.) Two pounds of mutton, two tablespoonfuls of lard, two teaspoonfuls of coriander seed, one and a half tea- spoonfuls of salt, half tablespoonful curry powder, pinch of cayenne pepper, the same of white pepper, one small onion, one sour salted lime, six sour and salted plums, and three teacupfuls of water. Pound the coriander, salt, curry powder, cayenne, and onion, into a semi-solid paste, which fry in melted lard in a hot stew-pan for a minute, but do not let it char. Then put the meat (already washed in cold water and cut in small pieces) in the lard, stirring till it is thoroughly browned. Put in the water and the sour lime and sour plums, which have been pounded into a smooth mass, close the lid on the pot, and stew on a slow fire for one and a half hours, or till tender. The gravy left at the end of the cooking should be reduced to one cupful. Serve with boiled rice. If any vegetable is to be added to the meat, then it should be fried with the meat and undergo the same process as the meat. Skinned potatoes cut in quarters are the best. Thayet thee. (Stewed Mangoes.) Steep a dozen green mangoes in water for thirty-six hours. Drain thoroughly, and put them in a pan with strong sugar syrup, and stew till tender.

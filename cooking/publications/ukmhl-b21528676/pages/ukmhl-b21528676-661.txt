SWEDEN 2 R 625 Rye Meal Cakes. Put two pounds of fine rye meal (not flour), a dessert- spoonful of salt, and sufficient lukewarm water to make a dough about the same consistency as double cream ; then mix in an ounce of German yeast, diluted in a little warm water. Cover, and let it stand in a warm place until it has risen to more than double its size. Add a teaspoonful of caraway seeds and more flour, till it can be easily handled. Knead thoroughly, and again cover and put in a warm place for half an hour to rise once more. Put it on a baking board and knead well; dust with flour, and roll into thin round cakes about an eighth of an inch thick and eighteen inches in diameter ; prick them with a steel fork all over; cut out a hole in the middle the size of a shilling, and bake in a quick oven till cooked. Each cake is kept separate till per- fectly cold, when the flour is brushed off and they are strung on a thin piece of wood and hung up to dry. These cakes are eaten at every meal, except tea. Yeast. Put rather less than one dessertspoonful of salt and a quarter-pound raw sugar in half a gallon of water ; add this liquor very gradually to half a pound of flour and mix well. Let it stand for two days, then mix in three pounds of peeled potatoes, boiled and mashed. Let it stand till the following day and then bottle it. When making the yeast the liquor should be kept in a warm place and stirred frequently. Two ounces or a little more will be required for nine pounds of flour.

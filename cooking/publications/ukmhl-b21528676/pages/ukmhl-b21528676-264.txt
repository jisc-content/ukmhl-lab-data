BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 228 milk ; mix these well together and pour into the pan on the fire, stir until it thickens, and then pass through a fine sieve into a bowl or basin. Add one wineglassful of Tokay, place the basin on the ice to freeze the con- tents, and mix in, just before it is completed, one break- fastcupful of well-whipped cream, three ounces of sliced pistachios, and the same quantity of finely-minced orange peel. When it has frozen sufficiently it is ready to be served. Vienna Rolls. Dissolve one teacupful of German yeast in one quart of lukewarm milk, stir in one pound of fine flour, and set to sponge. Three hours afterwards add one table- spoonful each of salt and moist sugar, and make all up into a stiff dough. Let this rise for four hours, then work it well on a table or board, and roll out to about an eighth of an inch in thickness, then cut it into strips about six inches in width; these must be cut again into long triangles, not very wide at the base. Roll these pieces up, commencing at the base or bottom, and the top of the triangle will come in the centre of the roll. Roll them a little with the hands, then put them into a crescent shape on to a baking-sheet, and brush over with melted lard or water ; let them rise on the sheets for half an hour, and then bake for about ten minutes, or until lightly coloured.

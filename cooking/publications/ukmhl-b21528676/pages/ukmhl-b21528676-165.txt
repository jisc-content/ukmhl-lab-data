You have previously cut up a hare into neat smallish pieces ; put them into the stewpan, and keep stirring round over the fire until they are set; then fill it up with five quarts of second brown stock ; add two onions, a head of celery, a pinch of parsley, thyme, and bay- leaves, a blade of mace, and four cloves : when bo>lin°- 7 O ’ season with one ounce of salt and a little pepper, and let it simmer at the corner until the pieces of hare are done, which would be in about an hour if a young hare, but double that time if a very old one ; the better plan is to try a piece occasionally. When done, take out the best pieces and lay to one side, and the meat of the in- lerioi ones pound in a mortar, remove the bones, put it back in the soup, and pass all through a tammy, and put it again into a stewpan with a tablespoonful of red currant jelly and the best pieces of the hare, boil for ten minutes, and serve. Boiled Salmon and Cucumbers. Dress this fish in slices from an inch to two inches in thickness, boiling it in plenty of salt and water about twenty minutes ; the whole fish may be boiled, or the head and shoulders of a large one, but they require longer boiling. Salmon eats firmer by not being put into the water until boiling. Dress the fish upon a napkin, and serve with lobster sauce, shrimo ditto, or plain melted butter in a boat with fresh sprigs'of parsley boiled a few minutes in it, and sliced cucumbers. T29 j

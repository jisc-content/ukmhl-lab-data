CHINA (South-East) 11 i Ching-mi-fan. (Boiled Rice.) Boil the same way as in North-West recipes. Kwo mien kwei. (Tartlets.) Having made a puff paste, roll it out, or roll out the paste to a strip of twelve inches by four, the thickness of half-a-crown, then put in the centre any kind of preserves, and on top fine strips of paste. Bake on a tin, and, when cold, cut into fancy shapes. Yan ja kuai. (Dough-nuts.) Put three ounces of plain and one of rose water, one ounce of sugar, and one ounce of sweet-nut oil in a pot, and bring to the boil. When bubbling, drop in four ounces of flour, all at once, which has been dried and sifted. Stir briskly till the dough is quite smooth and thoroughly cooked and leaves the spoon freely. Remove the pan from the fire and work an egg into the dough with a wooden spoon. Wren thoroughly done, work in other three, but be sure to do only one at a time, so that the dough may be as light as possible. Heat a pan of fat to blue heat, and drop the dough in in teaspoonfuls, a few at a time, and fry till a golden yellow. Sprinkle with sugar, pounded cinnamon, and ginger, before serving.

BRAZIL 77 Carne Anada. (Fillets of Mutton.) In a deep stewpan place a piece of butter say two ouncesâ€”and melt it; when in a liquid state put in sliced Spanish onions, potatoes, and two or three tomatoes, and a clove of shredded garlic, with pepper and salt to taste. Lay on the top thin slices of lean mutton, cover it up and allow it to stew gently for about thirty minutes until the ingredients are cooked, then add a tablespoonful of Chili vinegar.

Pluck and draw a fowl, rub it well with salt, and leave it for a few minutes. Wash the heart, liver, and gizzard of the bird, finely chop them, and put them in a frying- pan with a lump of butter. Wash half a breakfast- cupful of rice, put it in with the liver mixture and half a teacupful of pistachios, the same quantity of well- washed currants, salt and pepper, and a small quantity of powdered cinnamon to taste, and a couple of roughly chopped apricots. Stir the mixture over the fire for a few minutes, then moisten it with two or three table- spoonfuls of water, and continue stirring until the moisture is all absorbed and the rice partly soft. Stuff the fowl with the mixture, and fry till browned; then drain off the butter, moisten to height with clear chicken broth, and keep it boiling gently at the side of the fire until the bird is tender. When cooked place it on a hot dish, and serve in a dish of rice cooked in brown stock.

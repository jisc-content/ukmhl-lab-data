Although this is almost exclusively a Chinese dish, it is not altogether unknown in this country, the nests bemg imported in small quantities, and commanding large prices. After they have been steeped and thorough- ly washed there is really nothing but a gelatinous mass which is without flavour or virtue, so that gourmets think that substituting Irish moss for the nests makes a much more delicate soup, and appeals more readily to the European palate. Take a quarter of a pound of Irish moss, soak in two waters till all bitterness is extracted, and boil with plenty of meat or fowl stock and the usual vegetables till cooked, season with pepper and soy (it must not be sweet browning, which is usually sold under that name). Strain and clear, then add along with the bones the pounded flesh of a couple of fowls, taking care not to lose any of the juice. Boil for a quarter of an hour. Add more seasoning, if required, and again strain and clear with the white of an egg and some of the pounded raw fowl. If birds nests are used, take three and put them into boiling water, and steep for forty-eight hours, then wash again in cold water, so that they are perfectly clean. Then proceed as above. (Sea Slugs.) Soak, wash, and clean in several waters, then sprinkle with a seasoning of soy, pounded cloves, mace, and pep- per ; put them into a stew-pan with strong chicken gravy

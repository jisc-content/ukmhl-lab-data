BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 222 Toltott Kaposzta. (Dolmas of Cabbage). Strip off the leaves of a white cabbage, wash them thoroughly, put them into a saucepan of salted water, and boil for twenty-five minutes. Take them out, plunge into cold water, and afterwards dry them. In the meantime prepare one and a quarter pounds of force- meat, using an equal quantity of finely chopped fat pork and lean veal, two eggs, a small chopped onion, a breakfastcupful of boiled rice, a good dash of paprica, pepper and salt, three tablespoonfuls of minced mush- rooms, and a little minced parsley. Divide this into pieces the size of a walnut, wrap them up separately in pieces of the leaves, put them close together in a pan, sprinkle well with salt, pour over a little melted butter, and add broth and buttermilk in equal quantities to half their height. Cover them over and cook until the liquor is reduced to a glaze, then remove the pan to the side ; have ready ten ounces of rice boiled in stock and finished with butter and grated Parmesan cheese. Cover the bottom and sides of a timbale mould with tender large leaves of the cabbage, without any of their hard parts, spread a layer of rice one inch thick over the bottom leaves ; mask this with tomato sauce ; arrange ten slightly flattened dolmas on top, grate over a little Parmesan cheese, and continue in this way until all are used up, by which time the mould should be full. Cover over with a cabbage leaf, then with thin slices of fat bacon; put the mould in a moderate oven, and cook for an hour. Drain off the fat, remove bacon and cabbage leaf, turn the timbale on to a hot dish, glaze the leaves

Prepare a pancake batter with four eggs, four table- spoonfuls of flour, two ounces of warmed butter, one ounce of sugar, and half a pint of warmed milk. Put a lump of butter into a frying pan, melt it, then pour in a thin layer of the batter. Fry until browned on one side, then turn it over and brown the other. Continue in this way until all the pancakes are cooked, putting more butter into the pan when required. Beat the yolks of four eggs, and mix them with half a pint of sour cream ; then put in two tablespoonfuls of well-washed currants, the same quantity of sultanas, and a small quantity of grated lemon peel. Spread the mixture over the pancakes, roll up lightly, lay them in a buttered dish, moisten with a few tablespoonfuls of sweetened milk, and put a small piece of butter on each. Place the dish in the oven until the pancakes are lightly browned, and serve while very hot with a sweet syrup made with brown sugar poured over.

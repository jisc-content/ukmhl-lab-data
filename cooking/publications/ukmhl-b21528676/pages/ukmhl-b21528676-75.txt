ARABIA 39 Murabbit Balah. (Stuffed Dates.) Mix together in a saucepan half a pound of loaf sugar, half saltspoonful of cream of tartar, and half a teacupful of water. Set the saucepan over a moderate fire and cook, keeping it closely covered, till, when a little of it is tued in cold water, it forms a jelly. Then remove immediately from the fire, let it stand covered for ten minutes, and beat it to a smooth stiff cream with a wooden spatula. When as stiff as a very soft dough, turn it out on a paste-board and work it with the fingers. Have ready some fine dates, carefully stoned, fill the cavities with the cream, arrange them in a heap in the centre of a glass dish, and serve. Urz wa Laban. (Rice and Milk.)

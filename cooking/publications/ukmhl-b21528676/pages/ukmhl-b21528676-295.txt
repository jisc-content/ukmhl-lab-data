BOMBAY (Mussulman) 259 Bundee. (Sweet Balls.) Take half a pound of rough wheat flour, and cook in sufficient ghee (melted butter) until it forms into small pellets by continuous moving with a spoon. Boil four ounces of sugar with the same quantity of ghee which you put into the flour, till it is a liquid. Then add the pellets and boil till it takes a solid form, and let it cool. When cold enough roll into balls (with the hands) about the size of tennis balls, and eat when cold. Mo-Rubba. (Guava Preserve.) Peel and quarter some ripe guavas. Steep in water for an hour. Put them in a preserving pan and just cover with water ; boil for an hour, or till in a soft mass. Strain through a jelly bag overnight. Now put the juice in the pan again and boil for fifteen minutes ; then add enough sugar to sweeten, but not to deaden altogether the tartness of the fruit. Skim carefully, add the juice of five limes to ever}' fifty guavas, and boil for half an hour, or till clear of scum. Pour into jars whilst hot, and cover closely when cold. Guava Cheese. Pass the pulp of the guavas, from which you have made the jelly, through a sieve, and add the juice of a lime to every three quarters of a pound weight of pulp. Boil slowly till quite thick, colour with cochineal, then pour into buttered pots and dry in a cool oven.

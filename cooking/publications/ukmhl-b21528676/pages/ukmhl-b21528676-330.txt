BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 294 Apple Jelly. Wash apples, and remove any decayed parts. (Crab apples are the best.) Put them in a preserving pan and cover with water ; boil till perfectly soft. Strain through a jelly bag, and to every pound of juice add a pound of sugar, and boil briskly for seven or eight minutes. Skim carefully, and pour into jars while hot, and cover when cold. Apple Jam. Put the apples on the fire again with more water, and after boiling for half an hour pass all through a sieve, and put to it the juice of a lemon to every three pounds of pulp, and three quarter pounds of sugar to each pound of pulp, and boil for half an hour. Apple Cheese. Proceed as above, only put the pots in a cool oven till all the moisture has evaporated. Orange Marmalade. Cut twenty-four Seville bitter oranges in two. Squeeze the juice out, and scrape away the pulp, rejecting all pith and pips. Boil the skins in water till quite tender, and cut into very fine chips after having removed all the pith. Take the same weight of sugar as the oranges, and clarify it ; add the chips, pulp, and juice, and boil for ten minutes ; now add the juice and grate of four lemons, and boil for twenty minutes, skimming carefully, and stirring occasionally in case of burning.

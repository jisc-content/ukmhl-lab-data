Rub the pieces of salmon with this, and let soak for an hour. Now wipe tire pieces and thread them on to skewers with a piece of pickled mango between each fillet. Roast in front or over the fire. Machleeka Salan. (Curried Soles.) Remove the heads, tails, and black skin from two soles each weighing about a pound. Cut each into three pieces and wash thoroughly.

Fry in four ounces of boiling ghee four ounces of finely shred onions, and when nicely browned place to the one side. Wipe the pieces of fish, and fry them lightly on both sides.

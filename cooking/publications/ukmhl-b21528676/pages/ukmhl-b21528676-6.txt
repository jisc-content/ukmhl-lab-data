A BALLADE OF DINNER. There are pleasures of various kinds, Which are nicely adjusted to suit The balance of various minds In a manner remarkably cute. But the best of them all I salute— It is shared by the saint and the sinner, It is common to man and to brute— The joys of an excellent dinner ! Not the beggar whom poverty grinds, Who is blind, or one-legged, or mute ; Not the German who constantly winds The most horrible airs on his flute ; Neither doctor nor lawyer astute, Nor ascetic who strives to grow thinner, Will ever attempt to dispute The joys of an excellent dinner. Not the thinker who suddenly finds He has settled a point which was moot ; Not the poet whom self-conceit blinds To the discord he twangs on his lute •, Not the lover whose bliss is acute, When of beauty and worth he’s the winner, Will venture to try and refute The joys of an excellent dinner. L Envoi. Prince, do you hold in repute The joys of the mind, which are inner ? They are miserable, weak, and dilute To the joys of an excellent dinner ! R.

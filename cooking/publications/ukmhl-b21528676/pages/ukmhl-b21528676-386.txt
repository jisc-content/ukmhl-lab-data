BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS one pound of sugar and half a pound of water. Roll the paste out into a sheet a quarter of an inch thick, and cut into rounds of about three inches in diameter, and score them rather deeply crossways with a knife ; cover with syrup ; bake in an oven till the syrup is well soaked in and the rounds quite brown. Before getting cold cover with sliced pistachios. Bhat Pullau. (Sweet Rice Pillau.) Take one pound of rice, one pound of sugar, eighth of an ounce of cardamoms, five ounces of melted ghee or butter, two ounces of almonds, two ounces of pistachios, and two ounces of sultana raisins. Wash the rice in three waters, and then soak for half an hour. Put three and a-half pounds of water in a pot, and, when boiling, put the rice in and boil quickly dll half cooked. Strain the rice on a sieve, giving it a stir to separate the grains. Put one third of the melted ghee into a pot, and when it begins to boil put in the carda- moms, which have been soaked in water for half an hour. Boil eight ounces of water with one pound of sugar for two or three minutes, then put in the half-boiled rice, and mix well. Put on the lid till it boils, then remove the lid and stir until all the water has evaporated. Add the almonds, pistachios, and raisins, cover the pot with the lid or a cloth, and steam for half an hour. Pour the contents into a dish and sprinkle the rest of the melted ghee or butter over it, also adding two ounces of strong perfumed water. 35Â°

ARABIA 33 c Shurbit Khaskhas. (Cuscus Soup.) The “ cuscus ” (cooscoocoo) is a sort of semolina, or paste of wheat, prepared thus by the Arabs. (The usual semolina makes a good substitute.) Take some good wheat (grain) ; cleanse it well, and wash it in several waters, until the epidermis be some- what tender ; then gather it into a heap on a smooth table, cover it with a damp cloth, and expose it for several hours to a burning sun, that is until the grain swells ; then remove the cloth, spread the corn in a thin layer so as to dry quickly and shrivel in the heat of the sun. In such a state grind it between two millstones, according to the usual process ; but notice that the stones be distant enough to bruise the wheat without pulverising. Winnow it afterwards, to extract the bran and flour which may remain. To prepare this soup, one should have at one’s dis- posal a colander without a handle, fitting closely to the mouth of an earthen stock-pot, which is kept hanging by aid of three hooks, so as not, however, to prevent the stock-pot from being closed hermetically. Cut the half of a leg of mutton, off the knuckle end ; put it into the stock-pot, with a good hen, a little salt, and four or five quarts of water, observing that the water only reaches to three-quarters the height of the vessel; place it on the fire to bring the liquid to ebulli- tion ; skim it well, and at the first bubbling remove it back.

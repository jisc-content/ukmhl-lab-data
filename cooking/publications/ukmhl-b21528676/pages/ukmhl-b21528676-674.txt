BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 638 Iadi sha toub. (Hashed Fowls.) Remove the skin and bones from a fowl, mince the meat very fine, and then pound it. Put the bones and trimmings into a stewpan with one and a half pints of stock, a small onion stuck with two or three cloves, a point of garlic, and a bunch of sweet herbs. Boil the stock gently for an hour, then strain it carefully into a stewpan, skim off the fat, put in the minced fowl, and keep it simmering at the edge of the fire. When the fowl is cooked, strain and reduce the stock to a fifth of the original quantity, mix in a little sour curd and a tablespoonful of flour, which put into pan with mince, and bring all up to the boil. Serve with bread, plain boiled rice, or savoury rice puddings as in Turkestan. Mo-mo. (Meat Dumplings.) Cut the meat into small pieces like dice, rub them well with lemon juice, and roll in a mixture of finely chopped herbs and shallots seasoned with white pepper. Wrap portions of the meat in a good pudding or pie dough, fastening it securely so that the juice may not escape, plunge them into a saucepan of boiling water, and boil slowly for two hours. Meanwhile make some well-flavoured sauce with good stock, and when strained squeeze the juice of a lemon in it. Drain the dumplings well when cooked, place them on a hot dish, and serve at once with the sauce in a sauceboat; add a little poured over each and round the dish. Eat with plain boiled rice or savoury rice pudding.

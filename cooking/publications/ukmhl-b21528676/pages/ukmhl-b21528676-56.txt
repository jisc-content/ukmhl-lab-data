BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 20 Mesfouf. (Semolina Pudding.) Put twelve little almonds in one and a half pints of milk, and simmer very gently for half an hour, strain, and put into the milk three ounces of semolina, quarter of a pound of sugar, and three ounces of butter. Bring to the boil, stirring all the time. Remove from the fire, and a couple of minutes afterwards stir in four well- beaten eggs gradually. Pour the mixture into a pudding dish, and bake in a moderate oven. Murabbit Tin. (Stuffed Figs.) Mix together in a saucepan half a pound of loaf sugar, half a saltspoonful of cream of tartar, and half a tea- cupful of water. Set the saucepan on the fire and cook, keeping it closely covered till, when a little of it is tried in cold water, it forms a jelly, then remove from the fire, and let it stand with cover on for ten minutes, and beat it to a smooth stiff cream with a wooden spoon or spatula. When as stiff as very soft dough, turn it out on a paste board and work the inside of some soft figs into it with the fingers. Have ready some figs from which you have removed a good portion of the inside. Fill up the cavities with the cream, and array neatly on a dish. Temer. (Stewed Dates.) Peel two dozen fresh dates, remove their stones, pound their pulp, and pass it through a sieve ; give sugar to this puree, add a few drops of extract of roses

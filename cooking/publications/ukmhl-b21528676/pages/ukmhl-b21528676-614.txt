BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS trimmings of carrots, turnips, six onions stuck with cloves, three heads of celery, two lettuces, and some good stock ; skim it and boil slowly ; when done, strain through a napkin, let it settle, pour off all the clear liquid, and reduce a good Espagnole sauce with it, that it may obtain the flavour of the roots. Blanch three cabbages cut in quarters, take out the stocks and open each quarter to season it with pepper and salt ; tie them up and put them in a stewpan with slices of fat bacon and a slice of lean ham ; put in the midst of the cabbage a sausage, a piece of bacon previously blanched, and three pigeons (with their legs drawn in) larded with fat bacon and ham ; add a bunch of parsley and shallot; cover the whole with fat bacon, and set them to stew with clear brown stock or the skimmings of a poultry stock over a slow fire for three hours. Drain on a napkin the carrots and turnips, and place them round the bottom and sides of a buttered mould; drain the cabbage in a colander, and the pigeons, bacon, and sausages; press them in a double napkin to firm them and to preserve the form of the chartreuse ; cover the bottom and sides thinly with the cabbage, lay round the bottom a border of the sausage and bacon, then the pigeons with their breasts downwards, and on them more bacon and sausage, and fill up the mould with cabbage, rendering it very even at the top. Cover it with oiled paper and put it in a bain marie for an hour. Some minutes before serving, turn the chart- reuse over upon a napkin folded in eight and laid upon a stewpan cover to drain ; turn the mould over,

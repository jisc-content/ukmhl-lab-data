BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 614 Mjolk ost Pudding. (Custard Cheese Pudding.) Boil for three minutes one pint of milk with half a bay-leaf, an anchovy, and just a grate of nutmeg. Pour this on to three whipped eggs with a tablespoonful of grated cheese, a pinch of mustard and pepper mixed in them. Put this in a pudding-dish and bake for twenty-five minutes, or it may be steamed and turned out on to a dish. Custard pudding is made the same way, only sub- stitute one ounce of sugar for the grated cheese and other seasonings. Torskrom Pastag. (Scallops of Codâ€™s Roe.) Cook about three-quarters of a pound of roe. Take one teaspoonful each of corn and wheaten flours and mix them with one tablespoonful of water. Next take three tablespoonfuls of the liquor in which the roe was boiled while it is still *at boiling point, stir it into the flour mixture, adding half an ounce of butter, one teaspoonful of essence of anchovy, and a little cayenne pepper, and put it over a brisk fire, stirring until it gets quite thick. Mix this with the roe, which you have first passed through a wire sieve ; put it on a dish well buttered and sprinkled with sifted bread- crumbs. Spread out the roe evenly to about one inch in thickness, and cover with more breadcrumbs, seasoned with salt and pepper ; melt a little butter, spread it over the top, and then bake for twenty minutes in a quick oven. If it is not well browned in this time use a salamander to finish it.

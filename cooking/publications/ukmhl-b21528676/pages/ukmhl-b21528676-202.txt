BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 166 Aal Suppe mix Klossen. (Eel Soup and Dumplings.) Fillet and cut in thick pieces four small eels, one small tench, and one perch ; with the heads and bones of these fish, water, wine, vegetables, and spices, prepare two quarts of good broth. Blanch in white wine three or four dozen oysters, drain and trim them, to be kept on one side, preserving their liquor. Mince, fry in butter a carrot, an onion, and a piece of celery root ; moisten these vegetables with the pre- viously prepared broth, and a little white wine ; season, add the pieces of fish, and let them boil on a moderate fire ; this done, pass the broth through a fine sieve, and skim off the fat, preserving the pieces of fish. Mix three ounces of butter, and two tablespoonfuls of flour, cook without allowing it to take colour ; dilute it with the previously prepared fish broth. Stir the liquid over the fire till boiling, then remove the stewpan to the side of the fire. Twenty-five minutes afterwards carefully skim the fat off the soup, pass it through a sieve into another stewpan, add to it shredded raw mushrooms, as well as the oyster liquor ; ten minutes afterwards thicken the soup with four yolks of eggs diluted with a little raw cream ; take it off the fire ; mix in the oysters as well as the pieces of tench, perch, and eel, carefully pared without skin and bone. Finish the soup with a pinch of cayenne, and another pinch of chopped parsley.

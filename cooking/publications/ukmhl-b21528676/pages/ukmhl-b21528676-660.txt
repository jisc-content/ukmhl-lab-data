BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 624 brown ; dust with sugar and roll up, and serve with quartered lemons. Blabar Glasse. (Bilberry Ice Cream.) Crush twenty ounces of good fresh bilberries, which pass through a fine sieve or else through a tammy. Pour this puree into a sugar-pan, and mix in a few spoonfuls of sugar flavoured with vanilla. Set the pan on pounded ice in order to have the puree cooled, stirring continually. As soon as well set by the cold, introduce into it double its volume of sweetened and perfumed whipped cream, kept very firm. Then freeze. Cranberries may be substituted for the bilberries. Rye Bread. Put one tablespoonful of butter and sugar into a basin, pour over one pint of boiling milk, add one tea- spoonful of salt ; let the mixture cool, and then add half an ounce of yeast reduced in a teacupful of water. Mix in three breakfastcupfuls of rye flour, and knead well. Do all this in the morning, and let it stand in a cool pantry all night with a cloth over it. Next morning, when it is well swollen, add more rye flour, so that the dough can be easily handled, and knead long and well. Shape it into rolls about two feet long and two inches thick, with tapering ends; place on a floured baking-tin, put in a warm place for twenty minutes to rise, make three incisions across each loaf, and bake in a good oven.

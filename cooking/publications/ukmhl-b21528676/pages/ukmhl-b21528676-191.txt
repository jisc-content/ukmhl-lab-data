FRANCE (North) done, empty out the rice, without taking the crust out of the mould ; then tie a band of buttered paper (four inches wide) round the top, and put to the one side until wanted. Boil sufficient chestnuts, pound them, and pass through a fine wire sieve, after which dry and pound again into a flour (if you can purchase chestnut flour it will save this trouble). Put six ounces of chestnut flour (thus made or pur- chased), and four ounces of butter in a stewpan, and mix well without melting it. In anotliei stew- pan have rather more than two pints of milk, into which, when boiling, put one stick of vanilla; place a cover upon the stewpan, and let it remain until half cold, then take out the vanilla and pour the milk upon the butter and flour, stir over a sharp fire, boiling it five minutes, then stir in the yolks of five eggs quickly, and sweeten with four ounces of sugar; when cold, and an hour and a quarter before you are ready to serve, whip the whites of the five eggs very stiff, stir them in with the mixture lightly, pour into the mould paste, and bake about an hour in a moderate oven ; if going too fast, and liable to be done before required, open the oven door, as it ought to be served the moment it is done ; when ready to serve take it from the oven, detach the band of paper, take it from the mould, dress it upon a napkin on a dish, and serve immediately. Strawberry, pineapple, peach, and any kind of flavouring, may be used in place of the vanilla, and use fine Vienna flour in place of the chestnut flour. *55

BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS teacupfuls of Italian cullis, one teacupful of rice which has been thoroughly washed and dried, a teaspoonful of lemon juice, salt and pepper; boil for three minutes. Pour into a baking dish and put into a hot oven to finish cooking. When sufficiently cooked, the rice will have absorbed all the liquid and have formed a brown crust on top. Good gravies and sauces can take the place of cullis. Pescada Cosiha. (Boiled Hake.) Cut a large hake into nicely shaped pieces, make some good stock with the bones and odd bits, adding a couple of onions cut in quarters, a large carrot, a celery root, a large bunch of parsley, some pepper, salt, and fine herbs ; strain and reduce it. Place the fish in this, along with some quartered peaches, two or three halved tomatoes, some cooked chick beans (small white ones will do), and stew gently. When cooked, place the fish on a dish, and surround with the beans, tomatoes, onions, carrot in neat pieces, the peaches, and some hard-boiled eggs cut in four. Pour a little of the cleared stock over, reduce the rest of the stock, and serve in a separate sauce-boat, along with potatoes. Cod, ling, halibut, and turbot may be cooked the same way.

Cut some lean pork into pieces about the size of a five-shilling piece ; rub them with salt, and pack in a deep earthenware jar ; bruise a few cloves of garlic, which spread on the pork, along with some whole pepper, 5Â°4

Bossor-ouf-Entil. (Ragout of Duck.) Half roast a duck, and divide it into joints or neatly cut pieces ; put it into a stewpan, with a pint and a half of broth or water, with any trimmings of meat, a large onion stuck with cloves, allspice and black pepper, and the rind of a lemon cut very thin. Bring the con- tents of the pan to the boil and skim it clean, then let it simmer gently, with the lid closed, for an hour and a half. Take out the pieces of duck, and strain the gravy. Put two ounces of a good beef dripping into a small stewpan, and sufficient flour to make it rather a stiff paste, and then stir in the gravy gradually. Let it boil up ; then add the juice of half a lemon, a glass of wine, and a little salt. Put the duck in a dish and pour the gravy over it, and dish up. Serve with mashed potatoes. Petuchei Pf.rurim.

Mix one teacupful of grated boiled salt tongue, one breakfastcupful of mashed potatoes, and one tablespoon- ful of finely-pounded bread crumbs, and a little white pepper, grated nutmeg, and salt to taste ; drop in an egg, pound all together in a mortar, then roll out half an inch thick, and cut with a cutter about two inches in diameter

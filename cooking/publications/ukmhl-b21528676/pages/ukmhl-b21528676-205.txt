Beat them well, then dip in beaten egg and breadcrumbs. Fry in butter a golden brown. Dish, and put a squeeze of lemon on each. Fry eggs equal to the number of fillets, trim them neatly, and place one on each of the fillets. Serve with pancakes and celeriac. Lamb or mutton chops may be cooked the same way. Selerie Salat. (Celeriac Salad.) Peel and cut a fresh celery-root into fine shreds, and soak it in water for a quarter of an hour. Peel and boil four truffles for three minutes in a little Madeira wine.

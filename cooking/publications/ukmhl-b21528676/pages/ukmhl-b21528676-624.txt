BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 588 Huevos pasados por aqua. (Lightly Boiled Eggs.) Have ready some boiling water, into which place some eggs, and boil for not longer than thirty seconds, as the whites must not on any account be cooked. Eaten out of the shell or out of glasses into which they may be poured. Sopa de Arroz (Olla). (Rice Soup.) Put into an earthen stock-pot half a quart of chick- peas, previously softened in tepid water for twelve hours ; add three pounds of brisket of beef, the third of a leg of mutton (taken off the knuckle end), two pig’s feet, two pig’s ears, one pound beef gristle and one pound mutton gristle (both taken from the briskets, and cut in finger lengths), also two sheep’s tails cut in three pieces, half-a-pound of smoked streaky bacon, the same of raw ham (both blanched). Add some salt and pepper. Cover this meat abundantly with cold water, set the stock-pot on a blazing fire, carefully skim the liquid ; at the first bubbling remove the stock-pot to the corner of the stove, letting the liquid only simmer gently during all the time of its cooking. Two hours afterwards plunge into the stock-pot two partridges, two pigeons, two large carrots, two onions, a bunch of parsley garnished with a bay-leaf, a bunch of leeks, and a head of celery, both tied up. An hour afterwards add three small smoked sausages and six lettuces blanched and braised.

BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 540 Mussel Sauce. Make three-quarters of a pint of very strong stock from a pound or more of good veal, onions, and parsley, and thicken with plenty of butter kneaded in flour. Strain and add some mussels, a glass of white wine, the juice of a lemon, salt, and white pepper. Mutton Collops and Cucumbers. Pare and slice the cucumbers as thick as a five-shilling piece. Sprinkle them with fine salt and pepper, and pour vinegar over them. Brown the collops (small pieces of mutton the size of a five-shilling piece) in the frying-pan, and then stew them with the drained cucumbers in a little broth. Skim and season the stew, and serve it hot in a ragout dish. Haggis. Clean a sheep’s pluck thoroughly. Make incisions in the heart and liver to allow the blood to flow out, and parboil them, letting the windpipe lie over the side of the pot to permit the phlegm and blood to dis- gorge from the lungs : change the water after a few minutes’ boiling for fresh water. Another half hour’s boiling will be sufficient; but throw back the half of the liver to boil till it will grate easily. Take the heart, the half of the liver, and the lungs, trimming away all skins and black-looking parts, and mince them together along with a pound of good beef suet. Grate the other half of the liver. Have eight onions peeled and scalded

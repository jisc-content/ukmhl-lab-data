BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 576 Nouille Paste. Sift six ounces of fine flour into a basin, make a foun- tain, add within it a pinch of salt, seven or eight eggs, and mix the whole into a stiff paste ; then work it by passing it in small pieces between the pressure of the hands and the dresser to mingle the soft and hard pieces together, forming it into one equally smooth and hard body ; perform this operation once in summer and twice in winter ; the paste should be firm, and yet soft enough to mould easily ; cut and mould it in four equal parts, which roll as thin as possible ; cut into strips two inches wide, flour them lightly, lay four of these strips one on the other, and cut them across as thin as possible ; when thus cut, move the pieces gently with the ends of the fingers, to separate them, thus forming a kind of vermicelli, which strew on large stewpan covers, that they may not adhere together by their own weight, which will happen if laid more than an inch in depth ; follow the same process with the rest of the sheets, and when thus arranged, if intended for entrees, turn them into boiling stock ; if for sweets, into boiling cream or milk. Lingua d’Agnello. (Sheeps’ Tongues.) Braise ten or twelve pickled sheeps’ tongues in well- flavoured stock in which you have put a glass of red wine. After three-quarters of an hour’s gentle simmering they will be cooked. Put them flat on a dish, and put another dish on top with a weight so as to press them.

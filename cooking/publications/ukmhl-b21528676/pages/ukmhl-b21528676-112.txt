BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 76 Carne Secca. (Dried Beef.) Soak two or three pounds of dried salted beef till the brine is well washed out. Put it in a pot of water and boil steadily (being careful to skim away any fat or dirt that may rise) till three-quarters cooked, then put in some onions, carrots, cabbage, green peppers (pimen- tas), a little black pepper. Finish cooking. Dish the meat and surround with some of the vegetables, putting some of the stock in a dish. Serve with fricassee of beans. Fejoues. (Fricasse of Beans.) Blanch and skin one quart of well-softened black beans, put them into a saucepan with one breakfast- cupful of water or veal broth, and add a small bunch of sweet herbs, a little each of mace, grated nutmeg, salt and pepper, and one wineglassful of white wine. Cover over the saucepan, and cook gently for fifteen minutes, then remove the bunch of sweet herbs, and add a small lump of butter kneaded with flour, tossing it about in the pan until it is dissolved and the liquor thick. Put the yolks of two eggs in a basin, pour in one breakfast- cupful of cream, and beat well together. Add them to the saucepan, and stir it in one direction until the liquor is quite thick and smooth. Remove the pan from the fire, add the juice of half a lemon, turn the fricassee on to a hot dish, and serve. If dried beans are used, they must be soaked in salt water for ten or twelve hours, and then boiled until they are tender, when the skins will easily come off.

Pitcaithly Bannocks. These are made the same as shortbread, with the addition of some currants, roughly chopped almonds, and small pieces of candied peel mixed with the dough before making into cakes. Girdle Scones. Put in a basin three-quarters of a pound of flour, half a teaspoonful each of carbonate of soda and cream of tartar, a teaspoonful of salt, a pinch of sugar, and a tablespoonful of lard. Mix all together very thoroughly, then pour in sufficient buttermilk gradually, stiiring all the time with a knife very lightly till you have a dough easily handled. Turn on to a floured baking board, and roll out into a round half-an-inch thick, and cut it in four. Put a brick on each side of the fireplace, and stand the girdle on them ; dust the girdle with flour, and when it browns it is hot enough to cook the scones. Put the four on at once, and when they get a light brown turn them; and when done, place them between several towels as long as they are hot, to keep out the air till quite cold. Repeat the process till you have made as many scones as you wish.

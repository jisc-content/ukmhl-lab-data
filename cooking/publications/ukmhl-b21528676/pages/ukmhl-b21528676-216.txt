Cut about six pounds of tender veal from the thick end of the leg, rub with salt, and place in a roasting pan in which you have heated half a pound of butter. Fry both sides lightly, then put it into the oven with three large onions cut in thick slices, and cook for one and a half hours or till ready, being sure to baste very often. Take the roast out, pour into the pan two cupfuls of water and a little salt if necessary, and bring to the boil, stirring all the time to take up the glaze which will be in the bottom of the pan. Strain, and put back into the pan, and stir in two cupfuls of thick sweet cream. Heat up and serve in a sauceboat. Dish the roast, and serve with any seasonable vege- tables, mashed potatoes, liver dumplings, and the cream sauce.

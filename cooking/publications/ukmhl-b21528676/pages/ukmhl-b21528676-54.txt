BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 18 Cheurba. (Stewed Mutton.) Take some nice small fillets of mutton, some halved tomatoes, halved onions, and a good quantity of roughly chopped parsley ; put them in a pan with a little water, with a seasoning of cayenne pepper and salt, and stew very slowly till the meat is tender. Serve with pulled bread. Taam Bel Horour. (Couscous.) To prepare this soup one should have at oneâ€™s disposal a colander without a handle, fitting closely to the mouth of an earthen stockpot, which is kept hanging by aid of three hooks, so as not, however, to prevent the stockpot from being closed hermetically. Clean three pigeons and a good hen, and put them into a stockpot, with a little salt and two or three quarts of water, observing that the quantity only reaches to three- quarters the height of the vessel. Place it on the fire to bring the liquid to ebullition ; skim it well, and at the first bubbling remove it back. Three-quarters of an hour later add half a turnip, two carrots, half a cabbage, some peas, artichokes, and a pinch of red pepper. One hour afterwards wash half a pound of semolina, put it into the colander, and this over the stockpot, which must shut closely, thus cooking the semolina by the steam. For this purpose the colander should stand a little above the liquid. Continue boiling until the pigeons and hens are done. Pull the meat off the birds,

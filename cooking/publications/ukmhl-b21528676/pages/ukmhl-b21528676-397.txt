PUNJAB (Mussulman) 361 Put three ounces of ghee in a pan, also lour cloves and six ounces of water. When the water boils put in the rice, and when the water dries up put thirty grains of saffron in the syrup already prepared, and mix it with the rice. Stir it with a spoon, and when the syrup is dried mix in four ounces of milk. Take the juice of an orange along with the juice of three prunes, which have been first steeped for some time in water, and pour it into the rice, and cook till rice is soft. Rabbri. (Curdled Milk and Fruit.) Have two pounds six ounces of milk boiled slowly, and have the cream put aside by a spoon. When the milk is reduced to nearly four ounces remove it, and mix up all the cream with it. When it becomes cool, mix in two ounces of sugar, forty-five grains of small cardamoms, and some almonds, pistachio nuts, and raisins. Phirni. (Rice Sweet.) A quantity of ground rice is soaked in water for twelve hours, and afterwards mixed in sixteen times the quan- tity of milk, to which is added a quantity of sugar double the quantity of rice. The mixture is then placed in a pan on the fire, and stirred until it becomes some- what thick in the process of boiling. Mix in some small black cardamoms and little pieces of pine-apple, one for each of the cups. It is then poured into small cups of brass which, when cooled, are covered with exquisitely thin silver leaves on which chopped pistachios are sprinkled. The silver leaves are also eaten.

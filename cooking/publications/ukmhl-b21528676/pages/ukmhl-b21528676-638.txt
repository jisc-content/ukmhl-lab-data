BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 602 Alondras Cocidas en Marmita. (Braised Larks.) Bone the required number of larks, and stuff them with chicken forcemeat, putting a truffle turned to a ball in the middle. Tie each lark up in a small piece of muslin cloth, so that they may keep a good shape, and braise in Madeira and a little herb and vegetable essence generally known as Mirepoix. Put a layer of mashed potatoes on a hot dish, take the cloths off the larks, arrange them on the top of the potatoes, reduce some Madeira sauce with essence of larks, pour over, and serve. Essence of Vegetables and Herbs. Take two carrots, two onions, two shallots, two bay leaves, a sprig of thyme, a clove of garlic, and mince them together with a half pound each of fat bacon and raw ham. Toss these in a saute-pan with two ounces of butter and salt to season. Stew with a half pint of red or w'hite wine, and add to stock or sauce as required. Gazpacho. (Bread Salad.) Put in a bowl (the bottom of which you have rubbed with a piece of garlic) a large cupful of breadcrumbs, three sliced tomatoes, one cucumber sliced, one shallot minced, and a little minced tarragon. Pour over this a dressing made of one tablespoonful of water, one tablespoonful of oil, half that quantity of vinegar, half a teaspoonful of salt, and a good pinch of pepper. Mix all well together and serve as a separate dish.

BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 146 Luumu. (Stewed Plums.) Wash two pounds of good plums, put in a preserving pan with a little water, and boil till nearly tender. Then put in two pounds of sugar first boiled in a little water till it is a strong syrup ; when the whole has boiled for another ten minutes or so, pour into a dish till cold. Put some in a glass dish with very little syrup, and heap on top stiffly-whipped cream flavoured with a little vanilla and a dash of sugar. Yaatynytta. (Curdled Milk.) Pour sweet milk into a glass dish about two inches deep and lay it by till quite sour and quite firm. Then sprinkle ground ginger and sugar on top, and serve with sponge biscuits. A tablespoonful of sour milk added to the sweet milk will hasten the souring process.

BOMBAY (Brahmin) The preparation which has stood overnight is then rubbed in a pot until it forms a paste so adhesive that the pot may be lifted by taking hold of the contents. It has now become too thick to pour, so milk must be added and whipped till it froths. Then a kettle containing one pound of ghee is put on a slow fire ; when this boils, the paste is poured into it from a cocoanut shell with a hole as large as a big pea in it, or is squeezed through an ice piping cloth. In pouring the paste the hand is carried round and round in such a way that the paste forms circular masses of coils, which at once solidify in the boiling ghee. These masses are then placed in the hot pak, and after a little time removed on to a sieve or strips of wood and allowed to drip. Green Mango Jelly.

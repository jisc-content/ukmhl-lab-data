BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 26 Boiled Turkey and Cranberry Sauce. Singe, draw, wipe the inside, and bone a tender turkey, weighing about sixteen pounds. Dust the inside with a little pepper and salt. Mince very fine four pounds of lean raw veal, six pounds of fresh fat pprk, and a pound of bacon, seasoned with a teaspoon- ful of salt, two pinches of white pepper, two thirds of a saltspoonful each of grated nutmeg and thyme. Cut in inch squares half a pound of the red part of a cooked smoked tongue, and three dozen medium- sized chestnuts. Mix them thoroughly with the force- meat, two wineglassfuls of Madeira wine, a breakfast- cupful of pine cone seeds, or peeled pistachios. Cut away even slices from the breast of the bird, put these on the thin parts, so that it has an equal thickness all over. Put the forcemeat right in the centre, column shaped, leaving a clear space of two inches at the ends, and of four inches at the sides. Fold up both ends, then the sides, and lay it in the centre of a wet napkin, roll it carefully in this, tightly tie the ends, put it in a large pot, with the bones and trimmings, completely cover with cold water, place the lid on pot, and when coming to the boil, skim thoroughly, then add one' large grated carrot, two peeled onions, with three cloves stuck in each, a saltspoonful of salt, and boil on a gentle fire for two and a half [hours. Strain, and reduce the stock to a demi-glaze, dish the turkey, without the cloth, pour a portion of the sauce over, and serve the rest in a sauceboat, along with cranberry sauce and baked sweet potatoes.

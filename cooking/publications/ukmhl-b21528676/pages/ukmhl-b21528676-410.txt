BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS 374 Beef, mutton, Iamb, kid, venison, ducks, and chickens may be cooked the same way. Phulki Laroo. (Gram Pudding.) Grind half a pound of gram (the very small brown bean will do) till it is the size of semolina : mix it with four ounces of ghi and half a pound of castor sugar. When the ghi and sugar are melted and well mixed with the flour by stirring them over the fire, add a pinch of cinnamon, one teaspoonful of ground cardamoms, and half a teacupful of milk curd ; give a good stir round and simmer at the side of the fire till it is a soft moist mass. Take portions in the hands and mould into balls as large as tennis balls, on the top of which sprinkle finely sliced pistachios and sweet blanched almonds ; or you may pour the mixture into a dish and spread the pistachios and almonds on top. Naryal Pittas. (Cocoanut Croquettes.) Put some finely scraped cocoanut into a pan along with some thick sugar syrup and a pinch of black carda- mom powder. Fry till browned, but not charred, and place to the one side. Make a nice dough of finely sifted rice flour and boiling water ; knead well. Take a piece of the dough as large as an egg and press it out flat with the hands to the size of a large saucer ; put a tablespoonful of the cocoanut mixture in the centre, and fold over in the shape of a half moon ; wet the edges and press them closely together.

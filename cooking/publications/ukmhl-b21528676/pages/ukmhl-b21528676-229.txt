GREECE of the halves of the peaches ; put the balls of apples drained and cut into two round the edges. Mask the preparation (not the pears) with half set lemon jelly, dish the peaches on a gum paste bottom, having a small support on its centre ; seven or eight in a circle, one in the middle ; garnish the bottom of the dish with fancy shaped pieces of calfâ€™s foot orange jelly, and whipped cream. Loukoumi. (Honey and Pistachio Sweet.) Take one pound of honey, one ounce of gelatine, half the rind of a large lemon, the rind and juice of one orange, two ounces of pistachio nuts, one tablespoonful brandy, and a small teacupful of cold water. Soak the gelatine in the water, and, when quite soft, put il along with the honey on to boil for twenty minutes, giving an occasional stir. Peel the rind of the orange and lemon very thinly (there must be no white pith), and add to the boiling liquid along with the brandy, and let it stand by the fire for fifteen minutes to extract the flavour. Remove the orange and lemon peel, and add the orange juice along with the pistachios, which you have split, and stand at side of fire for other five minutes, after which pour into a greased tin. When cold and firm, draw the jelly out of the tin and cut into squares. Roll the squares in cornflour, and let them stand for a day, and then rub them in icing sugar. In damp weather the jelly may take longer than a day to become sufficiently dry to roll in icing sugar. *93 N

RUSSIA Zakouski. (Appetisers.) The dishes are generally composed of sandwiches (small and neat) prepared with smoked salmon, boiled anchovies, caviare, chopped hard-boiled eggs, etc. Be- sides these there are different kinds of pickled fish, small pieces of lobster or crayfish tails, little savoury tartlets, pickles, sour and salted cucumbers, thin slices of smoked sausages, and smoked breast of goose, etc. Different kinds of liqueurs and spirits are also served. These are all laid out on a buffet or side table, and are partaken of a few minutes before sitting down to dinner. ICrapivniya Schtschi. (Nettle Soup.) Take equal quantities of young nettles, spinach, and sour sorrel. Wash them in several waters, and boil with a little salt until soft, then rub through a coarse wire sieve. Slice an onion thinly, and cut it into lengths, fry these in butter, and when taking colour put in the previously pre- pared puree. Fry all together for a few minutes, stirring, mixing, and dusting occasionally with flour from a dredger. Transfer this when nicely cooked, without being burned, into a large saucepan, and gradually moisten it with two quarts of beef broth. Let this boil up, move it to one side, so that it will continue to simmer, and then drop in six smoked sausages, either whole or cut into slices. Boil slowly for an hour, skim off the fat, and just before serving stir in one brealcfastcupful of sour cream. With this soup it is usual to serve halves of hard-boiled eggs, which may be either plain, stuffed, or fried. 5*9

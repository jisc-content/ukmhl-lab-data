The meat being nearly done, strain two quarts of the stock, add some minced and lightly seasoned raw beetroots, onions, leeks, a quarter of a white cabbage head, and a piece of celery root, which have first been fried in oil or butter on a moderate fire. Put in small pieces of the meat and smoked bacon cut into middling-sized squares, and boil gently till the meats and vegetables are cooked. At the last moment stir into the soup a little sour juice of beetroot, thicken it with sour cream mixed with three tablespoonfuls of raw beet- root rasped, and finish with a piece of chopped fennel.

Place some fillets of sturgeon in a baking dish, season them with salt and pepper, and put in two or three small lumps of butter ; bake the fish for a quarter of an hour, turning it at the end of seven minutes. Take the fish out of the baking dish, mix a little flour with the butter, season with chopped shallots, chives, and parsley, then turn it into a stewpan, pour in one pint of red wine, and boil for fifteen minutes. Move the stewpan to the side of the fire, put in the fish to warm again, but do not boil it. Turn the fish and cooking liquor on to a hot dish, sprinkle some capers over it, and garnish with crotons of fried bread.

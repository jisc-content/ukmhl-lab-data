VEGETARIAN 669 green peas in separate waters. Fill small timbales with these, decorating top and sides with small pieces of eggs, vegetables, and beetroot cut into different shapes. Pour in aspic as you fill your shape, and let one poition foim before putting in any more. Stand on ice, and when required turn out on to an ashet and surround with watercress and the tender leaves of a lettuce. Aspic. Boil in three quarts of water two large carrots, two onions, a turnip, and a head of celery all sliced, a good- sized bunch of savoury herbs, two bay leaves, lind of a lemon, a parsley root, twenty white peppers and salt to taste. When thoroughly cooked, strain very carefully into an earthenware crook to cool, after which pour into the pot again, being careful to keep back all sediments. Add the juice of two oranges, a pinch of sugar, and six ounces of Irish moss which has been steeped in two waters for at least three hours. Boil very gently for a couple of hours. Strain once more into another clean pot and whisk up a cupful of the vegetable stock (which must now be only half the quantity) with the whites of three eggs, and stir this gradually into the pot, and keep stirring until nearly boiling. Now add a pint of tarragon vinegar and a pinch of cayenne pepper, boil up, and let it stand by the side of the fire for fifteen minutes, then strain. If the aspic is not stiff enough add some more Irish moss.

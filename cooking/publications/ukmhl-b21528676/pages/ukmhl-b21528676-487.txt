This is a dish of little omelets which, after being cooked, are taken off the omelet pan flat, laid on a hot dish, spread over with banana or other fruit glaze, then folded over, piled in a pyramid on a hot dish, covered with more of the glaze flavoured with rum, and sprinkled over with finely chopped pistachio nuts or almonds. Make the omelets in this way :â€” Break three eggs whole into a bowl, add the yolks of two more, sweeten with a dessertspoonful of castor sugar, add a pinch of salt, a dessertspoonful of melted butter, and a tablespoonful of rum ; mix thoroughly, but do not beat the eggs overmuch. Melt an ounce of butter in the omelet-pan ; when quite hot pour in a measure of the mixture (2 large tablespoonfuls), stir gently with a fork, then let it set, lifting it out with a slice on to a hot dish. Repeat the same process with all, and finish them as already described.

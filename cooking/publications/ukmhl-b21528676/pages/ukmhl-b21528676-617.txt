SICILY flower or rose water, or juice of lemon ; when per- fectly smooth put it into a preserving pan with eight ounces of sifted sugar, and stir the mixture continually with a wooden spoon over a gentle fire, that it may not stick; when the paste forms itself in a mass round the spoon, press the finger on it, and, if it adheres to it, con- tinue drying until it ceases to stick to the finger, then take it from the fire, detach all the paste from the sides and bottom of the pan, and roll out in a sheet one- twelfth of an inch in thickness. Divide it into two equal parts. On one part place small portions of apricot or pine-apple jam of about the size of a filbert, and an inch from each other ; wet the surface of the sheet slightly, and lay the other sheet on top, pressing it that it may contain the sweetmeat between the sheets ; then with a round or oval cutter, one inch and a quarter in diameter, cut them out, gather up the trim- mings, roll them out and use them as above. With an icing prepared with a white of an egg and two ounces of sugar mask the tops and sides of the marzipans and strew broken sugar equally over them, and in the centre stick a pistachio upright; lay them upon sheets to bake of a fine light colour ; when cold detach them very care- fully from the paper. They may also be masked with any of the various coloured icings, putting them into a very slow oven not to brown them. This sort of marzipan may be made of filbert kernels instead of sweet almonds.

586 Kuna fa. Sharbot. BANQUETS OF THE NATIONS (Almond Tart.) Make a thin paste of fine flour and water. Heat an iron plate so as to cook this paste immediately it falls upon it in fine streaks. This is effected by pouring the paste into a metal cup which has the bottom per- forated with small holes. The cooked streaks are then put in layers into a baking dish. Between these layers is run a mixture of pounded sugar, pounded almond nuts, and rose water ; top and bottom layers must be in cakes of paste. The whole is then slightly soaked in melted butter, and baked sufficiently to colour the top brown. (Sherbet.) Raisins, almond nuts, dried figs, dried dates (carob), locust, and any other dried fruits, are well soaked in hot water. This liquid is cooked and drunk before and after meals; during the meal only plain water is offered. Ric.e brings the finish of the repast, and after hands and mouths are washed the usual Egyptian coffee is handed round.

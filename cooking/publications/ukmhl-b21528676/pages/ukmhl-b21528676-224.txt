Then add a bay- leaf, a blade of mace, four or five peppeixorns; dredge in one tablespoonful of flour, and moisten with some of the liquor from the olives. Stir the whole until mixed, then place the pan over the fire for an hour, and stir occasionally. Boil the chestnuts, and when tender peel them, put them in a mortar with one ounce of butter, salt and pepper to taste, and a small quantity of grated nutmeg, and pound until smooth. Peel the olives, remove the stones, fill the hollows with the chestnuts, and lay them in a rather shallow lined stewpan. Strain the above sauce over them, carefully, and simmer at the edge of the fire till hot through. Cut a thick slice of bread, fry it in butter till a light brown, then drain and scoop out the centre, making a hollow large enough to hold the olives.

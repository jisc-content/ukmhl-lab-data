RAJPUTANA (Royal) Pulav. (Pillau of Mutton.) Fry eight ounces of sliced onions in eight ounces of boiling butter (ghi) till browned. Remove the onions to one side, and in the butter fry for a few minutes one pound of lean mutton cut in small pieces, and four ounces each of ground coriander seeds, cucumbers (gherkins) sliced, and green ginger, one ounce of garlic, a teaspoonful of salt, and a sliced red chilli. Put the meat in another pan along with four ounces of curds, half a stick of cinnamon broken into pieces, twelve large and twenty-four small cardamoms, an inch of mace broken into pieces, twelve whole cloves, and a little more salt. Simmer at the side of the fire till meat is tender. See that the pan is kept closely covered. Wash twenty-four ounces of rice, and fry till slightly browned in eight ounces of ghi; then add another eight ounces of ghi, and cover closely, and stew till soft. Take two pounds of the back ribs of mutton cut in small pieces, a few cloves, two ounces ginger, a point of garlic, and a little salt, and boil in sixty-four ounces of water till quite tender and the stock is reduced to twenty-four ounces. Strain and add to the two meats, fried onions and rice. In another pan heat four ounces of ghi, and add two ounces each of sliced almonds, pistachio nuts, raisins, and a little cayenne pepper, a quarter ounce of musk, and the juice of two limes. Toss the pan till all are thoroughly heated, then add to the meats, etc., giving all a good stir to mix thoroughly. Hermetically close 37i

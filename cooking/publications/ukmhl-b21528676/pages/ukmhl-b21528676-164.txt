Cut the carrots and turnips round with a cutter for that purpose, and put them into separate basins of water ; the turnips must be fried a light brown, with a few onions cut square, in some good clarified butter ; when done, put them in a hair sieve. The carrots must be blanched by themselves, and added to the turnips when done ; the lettuce must be cut in large squares and put in a basin of water with the celery, which is to be cut round and blanched by themselves, and both put into the sieve with the other vegetables ; then put some common thyme, well-washed and picked fine, in the soup pot, enough to cover the bottom, and stew with a small bit of butter. The vegetables in the sieve may then be put in the soup pot with the thyme, and filled up with some good beef stock and one ladleful of plain mutton broth. The parsley must be cut fine and blanched by itself, as well as the marigolds, and not put in before the soup is clarified. When clarified, add a little sugar and salt. Hare Soup.

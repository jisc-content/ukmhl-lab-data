76 Food and Feeding. 3. A clear decoction of game. 4. A decoction of fish proper, and with shell fish (oysters, mussels, &c.) ; including “ bisques,” p. 135. 5. A decoction of vegetables only, comprising also herbs, roots, grains, and farinaceous substances. Any of these may be used as made at first hand; then most may he presented with some slight addi- tion, such as with the well-known dried Italian pastes, and also fresh made pastes (nouilles and quenelles); cut fresh vegetables, in rounds, in squares, in long strips, fresh, or lightly fried before adding them, with crusts of bread, with an egg, &c.; each single addition de- noted by a distinctive appellation, which will suggest itself in each example named above, to any one who has the least acquaintance with cookery. The consomme of meat, or of veal, beef, and fowl mixed, or of game, may also he thickened by addition of a flesh, fowl, and game puree respectively ; white soups, commencing with a consomme of veal and poultry, thickened with a puree of the white meat of fowl; and brown purees following, from consomme of beef and veal, and of game. The same consomme, or the weaker broth, furnish bases for vegetable purees in like manner, either white or coloured. Many of these, like the others, have their distinctive names ; e.g., puree of carrot as Crecy, of green peas as S. Germain, of red haricots as Conde, and of artichokes, curiously enough, and by virtue of a bad pun, called Palestine.

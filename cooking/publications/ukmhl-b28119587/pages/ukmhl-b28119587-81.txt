The fish emerges when done, with a surface to which a little oil adheres, but this Avill drain off owing to its extreme fluidity when hot, if left on a napkiu slanting a minute or two before the fire; it may thus be served absolutely free from grease. The film of egg often applied to the surface of an object to be fried, is in the same manner instantly coagulated and forms an impermeable case ; while the fine bread crumbs adhering to it take a fine yellow colour from being slightly charred by the high temperature they are exposed to.

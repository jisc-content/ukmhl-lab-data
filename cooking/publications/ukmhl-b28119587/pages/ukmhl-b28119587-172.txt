Yet care must he taken not to alter the flavour; therefore if any colouring matter is used, it should be caramel, while fried onion, fried carrot, and similar substances should be avoided for the reason given.” * The same principle is laid down by Brillat-Savarin. “By a pot-au-feu we understand a portion of beef destined to be treated in boiling water lightly salted so as to extract the soluble parts. “ The bouillon is the liquid which remains when the process is completed. “The bouilli is the flesh, deprived of its soluble parts. “ The water dissolves, first, a part of the osmazome; then the albumen, which coagulates by heat, some of it forming the scum which is removed ; then more osmazome and extractive matter or gravy; finalty, some portions of the sheath of the muscular fibres, which are detached in boiling. “ To make good bouillon, the water must boil very gently, &e. Some vegetables are to be added to heighten the flavour; and bread or pastes to render it more nourishing ; and then it becomes a soup.” f * J. Gouffe : Lc Livrc dc la Cuisine. Paris. 1867.

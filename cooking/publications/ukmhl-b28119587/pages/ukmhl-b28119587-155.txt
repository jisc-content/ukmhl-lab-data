Cookery may be refined\ yet not costly. 141 is more or less typical in its character, so that given the knowledge of preparing it, several minor varieties can be produced. At the same time, such dishes are unpretentious, and do not demand the skill of a rare expert; yet, when really well executed, they offer results not to be surpassed by any, either in relation to refined tastes, nor in wholesome and nourishing qualities, in relation to the powers of the stomach and the wants of the system. To the remark regarding an estimate of the expense just made, I admit two or, at most, three exceptions, of which the chapon truffe is the most obvious example. And it is not suggested, moreover, that this should be prepared at home, but obtained only during the season of fresh truffles, from France ; stuffed on its native soil with native produce, it forms a very important addition to a dinner, and stamps it with a rare distinction. There is no difficulty in procuring truffled poultry of any size by rail direct from Paris, when the indulgence of a little extravagance is to be permitted; but even this trouble is not necessary, since a few first-rate London poul- terers import fresh truffles, and will furnish a fine Dorking fowl properly stuffed, the quantity used determining in any case the cost of the dish.* * No Letter names could be mentioned than those of Chevet, of the Palais Royal, and Bailey, of Mount Street, Grosvcnor Square.

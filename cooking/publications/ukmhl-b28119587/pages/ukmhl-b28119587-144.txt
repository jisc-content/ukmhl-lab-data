130 Food and Feeding. Let the foregoing ideas be represented in a concrete form, either as simple, and applicable to one or two persons ; or with additions of a luxurious kind, for the purpose of providing the variety necessary when there are several guests. It may be laid down as a self- evident axiom, that while two persons agreeing in their tastes may dine well on three, four, or at most five dishes, a larger number or choice of dishes must he provided to meet the differing tastes of six or eight persons, not one of whom individually will require more than the former. Thus:— 1. Introductory or Soup Preliminary or Dishes. Pish. Soup Soup and and Pish. Choice of Fish. 2. Substantial Dish Joint or other portion of meat; tender —relevi or remove. and juicy ; not necessarily roast: to he well garnished, and attended with vegetables. 3. Choice Dishes; entrees. An entrie of some kind ; one of fish may come here if soup only were taken before the meat. Two entrees—rare- ly more—simple or luxurious, ac- cording to the entertainment de- sired. 4. A Dish of Marked Flavour—the Boast. Almost always a bird; game when in season ; attended or followed by a salad. The Entremets. 5. Veuktable (which Tho best in season carefully cooked, may sometimes pre- and served by itself, eede, but will mostly follow, the roast).

59 Roasting v. Baking. into law, there may be a disposition to adopt a healthier diet and a more grateful variety of aliment. For variety is not to he obtained in the search for new animal food. Often as the lament is heard that some new meat is not discovered, that the butcher’s display of joints offers so small a range for choice, it is not from this source that wholesome and pleasing additions to the table will be obtained. But our most respectable paterfamilias, addicted to “ plain living,” might be surprised to learn that the vaunted “ roasting ” has no longer in his household the same significance it had five-and-twenty years ago ; and that probably, during the latter half of that term, he has eaten no roast meat, whatever he may aver to the contrary. Baking, at best in a half-venti- lated oven, has long usurped the function of the spit in most houses, thanks to the ingenuity of economical range-makers. And the joint, which formerly turned injEresh air, and was basted before a well-made fire, is now half stifled in a close atmosphere of its own va- pours, much to the destruction of the characteristic flavour of a roast. No doubt modern range-makers have to some extent improved the oven by ventilating it, but a true roast, constantly watched and basted at the proper time, is only to be produced before the open fire. Again, in relation to our present object, the defect just described is perhaps not less considerable than our neglect in this country of the process of braising as a valuable one in the preparation of animal food.

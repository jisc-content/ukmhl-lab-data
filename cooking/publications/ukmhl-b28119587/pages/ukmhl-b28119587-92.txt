Food and Feeding. 73 fish, or exclusively vegetable bases (potcuje maigre) ; into the latter class also, eggs are admitted. All these take rank of course among the five classes first named; but they are referred to separately here in order to draw attention to a fact not generally recognised in this country, that excellent soups may bo made without employing meat. Yegetable soups, clear and thick, are extremely palatable; the former being agreeable and wholesome, especially in the warm season when fresh vegetable growth is abundant, and full of juice and fragrance; and the latter or thick soup, may be very nutritious also, as already shown, since they contain a consider- able quantity of barley, peas, beans, haricots, Indian corn, rice, &c. See receipts in the Appendix; page 164. Nutritious and palatable soups may also be made from fish, the cheaper sorts being available for stock, while the better sorts are applicable as garnish. When we possess an adequate, and therefore cheap supply—an event which, with the enormous resources of this country, can only be a question of time— valuable soups and stews of fish and of shell fish, will be available for the poorer classes, whose tastes only require educating in order to appreciate them, doubt- less also a work of some little time. I need only to refer to oyster soups, to the much esteemed bisques, a term usually denoting highly flavoured purees of crayfish, and to that delicious dish, bouillabaise, eaten in perfection at Marseilles, as among the most agree- able products of culinary art in this direction.

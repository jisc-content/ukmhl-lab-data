Among the poorer classes this dish is, of course, intended to supplement a considerable quantity of bread. It will be apparent that, up to this point, our esti- mate of the value of these combinations has been limited, or almost so, by their physiological complete- ness as foods, and by their economical value in relation to the resources of that great majority of all popula- tions, which is poor.

Food and Feeding. IOO a light one, and not a combination of dishes, which is then taken. At or about noon a substantial meal, the dejeuner, is served ; and at six or seven oâ€™clock, an ample dinner. Such is the two-meal system, and it appears to answer well throughout the West and South of Europe. 2. What I have termed the provincial system con- sists of a substantial breakfast at eight or nine, a dinner at one or two, a light tea about five, and a supper at nine or ten. It is this which is popular throughout our own provincial districts, and also among middle-class society of our northern districts throughout both town and country. The habits also of the great German nation correspond more to this than to the first-named system. 3. The prevailing system of London, and of the numerous English families throughout the country whose habits are formed from partial residence in town, or by more or less intimate acquaintance with town life, is that of three meals daily. In general terms the breakfast takes place between eight and ten; the lunch from one to two; the dinner from half-past six to eight. In all cases each meal has its own specific character. Thus, here, breakfast is the most irregular in its ser- vice, and least of all demands general and intimate coherence of the party assembled.

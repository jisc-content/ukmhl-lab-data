Rice, and its combinations in food. 43 source of great discomfort, or of a “ bilious attack ; wliile the outdoor labourer, who requires much fatty material for his work, would have no difficulty m consuming a large quantity of such compounds with advantage. Nitrogenous matter also is commonly supplied at all middle-class tables beyond the eater’s wants; and if more is consumed than can be used tor the purposes which such aliment subserves, it must bo eliminated in some way from the system ; and pio- bably, as we have seen, by some uncomfortable method. Quitting the subject of wheat and the leguminous seeds, it will be interesting to review briefly the com- binations of rice, which furnishes so large a portion of the world with a vegetable staple of diet. He- membering that it contains chiefly starch, with nitro- gen in small proportion, and almost no fat or mineral elements, and just sufficing perhaps to meet the wants of an inactive population in a tropical climate, the first addition necessary for the people who dwell on the temperate margin of this limit, and just beyond it, will be fat, and, after that, more nitrogen. Hence an illus- tration of one of the first efforts to make a dish of rice “ complete ” is afforded by the addition of butter and a little Parmesan cheese, in the simple risotto, from which, as a starting point, improvement, both for nutritive purposes and for the demands of the palate, may be carried to any extent (see p. 93).

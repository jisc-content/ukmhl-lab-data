Value of Milk easily tested. 53 regarded as an exact test of quality, since the quan- tity of cream varies with different specimens; and as cream is of lighter specific gravity than milk, a speci- men of the latter which is extremely rich in cream, other ingredients being the same, will Aveigh lighter than one which is deficient in cream. But that a sample of milk exceptionally rich in cream should be offered for sale, although hypothetically possible, must he regarded as practically impossible in the last degree. The nutritive value of milk corresponds of course Avith the aggregate amount of all the solids contained, and for all purposes of the consumer, the specific gravity corresponds Avith that amount, the figure rising as the solids are augmented. The specific gravity of unadulterated milk furnished by different healthy coavs may be regarded as ranging between 1027 and 1035. But the mixed product of several such coavs equals at least 1030 or 1031. If the milk furnished by any dealer is persistently below 1030, there is ground for complaint on the part of the customer ; and I think it may be said that any metro- politan dairy of repute Avill furnish an uniform supply of milk decidedly above 1030. Nevertheless, there is a large quantity sold by the small dealers to the poor, of Avhich the specific gravity is no more than 1025 or 102G. Nothing, hoAvever, is easier than to ascertain the real value of any sample Avhich the purchaser desires to test. A lactometer may be bought for 2s. 6d.: it is only necessary to float it in a jug of milk, and the figure on its scale which is level with the surface of

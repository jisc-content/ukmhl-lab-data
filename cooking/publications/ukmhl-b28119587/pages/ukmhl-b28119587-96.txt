82 Food and Feeding. And here, again, the distinctive principles, already referred to, of French and English cuisine, are illus- trated in relation to the cooking of vegetables; and again, let me add, not to the disadvantage of our own system. I find it the more necessary to call atten- tion to this subject, as much has of late been said, which may lead many to believe that French usage is invariably right, and English usage invariably wrong. Yery far from the truth, I humbly submit, is such an allegation as this, even in regard of our treatment of vegetables. No doubt we are too often guilty of carelessness and inattention to the condition in which vegetables are presented, in the service of our tables, but our principle is in the main correct, and only wants to be pursued with intelligence. When vegetables are really good, well grown, and fresh, no good judge desires that their natural qualities of flavour, odour, and consistence, or even colour, should be destroyed bv the addition of other materials, and of foreign flavours. Let us take two, in illustration of these remarks, the pea and the tomato. Garden peas, petits ]^ois, when young, quickly grown, and fresh, have a delicious characteristic flavour of their own, are rather sweet, and almost crisp when eaten ; and maintain these attributes unimpaired, if simply boiled in salt and water. Such should be eaten a Iâ€™Anglaisc, the use of the term itself being a uncommon to hear the best produce of the fields of Argenteuil in- sufficiently appreciated here, and our own asparagus preferred, is, that the former is rarely sufficiently cooked at English tables.

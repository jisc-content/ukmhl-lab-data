170 Food and Feeding. skeleton, head and fins may be utilised for stock, these parts being of course useless for that purpose when already cooked, as by boiling, frying, &c. Having regard to economy, it may be remarked here, that by all these methods, but particularly by boiling, some waste of nutritive material occurs. Relative to this subject I have made numerous experiments, and find that the loss in weight by boiling varies with different fish, and also with the mode of operating. It is rarely as low as five per cent., it is generally much more, and I have known it to reach thirty per cent., the water always containing more or less solid animal matter. In order to avoid waste as much as possible, the fish should be placed in a relative quantity of water, which should be boiling. The liquor in which the fish has thus been cooked, I have evaporated, and have obtained from it, in solid deposit, no less than four per cent, of the original weight of the fish; a very startling quantity, constituting it in fact a fish broth. There is no doubt then that steaming is a more economical process than boiling, and ought to be substituted for the latter. To return to the utilisation of the commoner kinds of fish, and of fish trimmings or cuttings, in the composition of stock. From such materials may be made a soup, or better still a stew of fish, in very savoury and nutritious form, for the economical pur- chaser; or a delicate and attractive dish may be presented, for an experienced palate.

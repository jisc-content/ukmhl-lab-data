54 Food and Feeding. the milk is the specific gravity; the temperature should be about 60° Fah. Where an exact analysis is required, as for example, to determine the question of fining a fraudulent dealer, the value of the sample has to be found, by ascertain- ing the amount of solids present, apart from the cream, and estimating the latter separately. The Society of Public Analysts requires a mini- mum of “nine per cent of solids, not fat;” and any sample which does not reach that amount has almost invariably been adulterated with water, and the seller of it is liable to a fine. But “ nine per cent.” is a low standard, determined on to avoid the infliction of hardship on any small dealer who may have been supplied from the country with a genuine, though exceptionally poor milk, of which the solids did not exceed nine per cent.; and it may probably yet be altered. Hence vast quantities of milk which are sold every day at that standard, contain a good deal of added water. The standard of the best metro- politan dairies, whose interest it is to supply unadul- terated milk, is always higher. Milk is essentially the food of the growing animal. Supplied by nature for the rapid development of the young calf, it is, with a little modification, admirably adapted for our young children. It is excellent food, too, for some adults, by no means for all. Those who take much exercise, or follow laborious occupations, may make it a useful portion of their dietary. It is rarely suitable for sedentary persons, or for those who

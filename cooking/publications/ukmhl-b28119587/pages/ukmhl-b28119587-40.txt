26 Food and Feeding. o is an object of the first importance to consider whether other aliments can he obtained at a cheaper rate, and at the same time equal in quality to those of the existing dietary. Many believe that this object may be accomplished without difficulty, and that the chief obstacle to improvement in the food- supply, not only of the classes referred to, but in that of the English table generally, is the common pre- judice which exists against any aliment not yet widely known or tried. The one idea which the working classes possess in relation to improvement in diet, and which they invariably realise when wages are high, is an abundant supply of butcher’s meat. To make this the chief element of at least three meals daily, and to despise bread and vegetables, is for them no less a sign of taste, than a declaration of belief in the perfection of such food for the purposes of nutrition. We have already seen that not only can all that is necessary to the human body be supplied by the vegetable kingdom solely, but that, as a matter of fact, the world’s population is to a large extent sup- ported by vegetable products.

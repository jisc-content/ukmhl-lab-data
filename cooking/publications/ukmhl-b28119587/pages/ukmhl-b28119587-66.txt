52 Food and Feeding. importance of the dairy and its products, in connec- tion with the subject of food, even when considered apart from the question of their dietetic value. I shall next proceed to describe the composition and characteristics of good milk, adding some remarks on its use as diet, and then indicate the practical mode in which those who are interested in obtaining it un- adulterated and uncontaminated may attain their object. Of good cow’s milk, nearly one seventh part by weight is solid matter, the remainder is water. Of this seventh part, rather more than a third is “ lactose ” or milk-sugar; rather less than a third is “casein,” the basis of cheese; rather more than a fourth is “ milk-fat,” or cream; the small remainder being salts or mineral matter. The foregoing propor- tions are sufficiently correct for ordinary purposes, and are easily remembered. A more exact analysis is given here of the proportions in 100 parts of milk by weight.

Principles and Practice of braising. 61 method, to which the term is applied, and consequently the cookâ€™s conception of it is apt to be somewhat loose and indefinite.

It is that of partially browning or half-roasting the portion also; and this may be accom- plished in two ways. The legitimate or original way of doing this, is, to have well fitted to the hraise-pot a

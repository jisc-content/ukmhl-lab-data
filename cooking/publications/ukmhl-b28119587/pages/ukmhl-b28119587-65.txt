It was greatly due to the late Dr. Murchison, and to Mr. Ernest Hart, who more than anyone has studied this subject exhaustively, that the great epidemic of typhoid fever in the parish of Marylebone, in 1873, was traced to a single case at a country farm which supplied milk to a dairy in that parish ; directly occasioning no less than 218 cases of fever among the customers of that dairy, of whom twenty-six died. From these a vast number of other cases arose, how many could never by any inquiry be correctly estimated.

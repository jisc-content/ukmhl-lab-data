123 Aerated Waters. cannot be over-rated. The quality of that furnished to the population of London is happily now good, but the only mode of storing it possible to many often renders it dangerous to health. Disease and intem- perance are largely produced by neglect in relation to these two matters. It would be invidious, perhaps, to say what particular question of home or foreign poli- tics could be spared, that Parliament might discuss a matter of such pressing urgency as a pure water supply; or to specify what particular part of our enormous expenditure, compulsory and voluntary, might be better employed than at present, by divert- ing a portion to the attainment of that end. But for those who can afford to buy water, no purer exists in any natural sources than that of our own Malvern springs, and these are aerated and provided in the form of soda and potash waters of unexceptionable quality. Pure water, charged with gas, does not keep so long as a water to which a little soda or potash is added ; but for this purpose six to eight grains in each bottle suffice—a larger quantity is undesirable. All the great makers of these beverages have now their own artesian wells or other equally trustworthy sources, so that English aerated waters are unrivalled in excellence. On the other hand, the foreign siphon, made, as it often is, at any chemist’s shop, and from the water of the nearest source, is a very uncertain production. Probably our travelling fellow-country- men owe their attacks of fever more to drinking water contaminated by sewage matter, than to the malarious

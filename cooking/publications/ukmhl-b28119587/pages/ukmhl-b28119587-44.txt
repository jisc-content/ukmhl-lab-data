Food and Feeding. 30 extract:—“In 1846 the imports of corn and flour amounted to seventeen pounds weight per head of population ; in 1855 they had risen to seventy pounds per head ; and in 1865 to ninety-three pounds weight per head of population. Finally, in 1877 the imports of corn and flour amounted to 170 pounds weight per head of population of the United Kingdom.” * Lastly, those who are interested in the national supply of food must lament that, while Great Britain possesses perhaps the best opportunities in the world for securing a large and cheap supply of fish, she fails to attain it, and procures so little only, that it is to the great majority of the inhabitants an expensive luxury. Fish is a food of great value ; nevertheless it ought in this country to be one of the cheapest aliments, since production and growth cost absolutely nothing, only the expenses of catching, and of a short transport being incurred. This is a question which must sooner or later be solved by the public themselves, unless some persons in the trade, more enterprising than those who now pursue it, will abandon existing conventional rules and habits, and venture on the assuredly safe and profi- table enterprise of supplying fish good and fresh, at prices far lower than those which it is agreed shall rule at present. * Statesman’s Year Boole, 1879, p. 258. Ancl what might be the extra cost of obtaining this supply in time of war ?—a contingency wc ought seriously to reckon on. We should then, perhaps, draw much more largely than we do at present on the enormous resources which exist on all our shores, referred to in the succeeding paragraph.

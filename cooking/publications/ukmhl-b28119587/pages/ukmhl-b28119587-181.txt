Next in order the skate and the plaice, of which tho same may be said ; while their price also brings them, or should do so, within the range of the poor; in nutritive qualities they rank much higher than the sole and whiting. But besides all these there are fish, which may be placed if not in the first, yet certainly in the second rank, many of which are practically unknown to ninety-nine out of every hundred London house- keepers.

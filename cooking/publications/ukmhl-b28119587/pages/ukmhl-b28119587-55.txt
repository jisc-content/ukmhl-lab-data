A Receipt for whole-meal Bread. 41 bably after a trial or two, in producing excellent, light, friable, and most palatable bread:— To two pounds of coarsely ground or crushed whole wheat-meal, add half a pound of fine flour and a sufficient quantity of baking powder and salt; when these are well mixed, rub in about two ounces of butter, and make into dough with half milk and water, with skimmed milk, warm, or with all milk if pre- ferred. Make into flat cakes like “tea-cakes,” and bake without delay in a quick oven, leaving them afterwards to finish thoroughly at a lower tempera- ture* The butter and milk supply fatty matter in which the wheat is somewhat deficient; all the saline and mineral matters of the husk are retained; and thus a more nutritive form of bread cannot be made. Moreover, it retains the natural flavour of the wheat, in place of the insipidity which is characteristic of fine flour, although it is indisputable that bread produced from tbe latter, especially at Paris and Vienna, is un- rivalled for delicacy, texture, and colour. A palatable addition is made, in my opinion, by exchanging the half pound of flour ordered in the foregoing receipt * The following is a simple and excellent formula for “baking powder ; " one which has been long used for this and other purposes. It may be obtained at any chemist’s and in any quantity, based on the following proportions : Tartaric acid, 2 ozs. Bicarbonate of soda, 3 ozs. Common arrowroot, 3 ozs. Mix well; place in a wide-mouthed corked bottle, and keep perfectly dry.

March, 1884. PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION. —»—• A Third Edition of this little work having been called for, the publishers have had it en- tirely re-composed, and the author has carefully revised it throughout, making emendations, where they have appeared to he necessary, and numerous additions. Among the latter, a new chapter, the fourth, has been devoted to one of the most important articles of food consumed in this country, viz., Cow's Milk, to which no special consideration had been given in any previous issue. The subject of Fish in relation to diet has also been discussed much more fully than before, and several fresh suggestions made as to the preparation of it for the table. These appear partly in Chapter VI., and partly in the Appendix.

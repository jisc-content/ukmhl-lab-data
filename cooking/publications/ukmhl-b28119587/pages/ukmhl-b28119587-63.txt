Meantime, as our population grows more dense, sources of contamination increase, and the task of obtaining an absolutely pure supply is more difficult. Yery much more is contained in these simple statements than is at first discerned by the popular eye. Before making further comments thereupon, let us recall the fact that, excepting only the article of wheaten bread, milk is perhaps the most universally employed food in this country. And I am not quite sure that the exception made above is correctly stated to be so.

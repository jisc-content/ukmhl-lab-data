butcher’s meat, fish, &c. 217 removal of its operation by heating, it appears from Gay Lussac’s experiments, can be renewed a number of times. Nay, by occasional exposure to the heat of boil- ing water, without the exclusion of the air, * he found the exemption from putrefaction to be attained. The theory of these effects is not very apparent. Gay Lussac supposes, that the oxygen may combine with that principle analogous to gluten, which excites fer~ mentation, and which may equally excite putrefaction ; that this by a kind of coagu- lation is separated by heat, and thus ren- dered inert; and that it is only that part of it which has suffered oxygenation which is capable of this coagulation ; it is thus removed, while the exclusion of oxygen prevents the putrefaction from taking place, which would otherwise be excited by the L

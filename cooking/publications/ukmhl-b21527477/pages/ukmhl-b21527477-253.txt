The hole in the lid is now closed perfectly, by soldering-, whilst the air is rushing out. © The vessel is then allowed to cool, and from the diminution of volume in the con- tents, in consequence of the reduction of temperature, both ends of the cylinder are pressed inwards and become concave. The tin cases, thus hermetically sealed, are ex- posed in a test-chamber for at least a month, to a temperature above what they are ever likely to encounter; from 90° to 110° Fahrenheit.

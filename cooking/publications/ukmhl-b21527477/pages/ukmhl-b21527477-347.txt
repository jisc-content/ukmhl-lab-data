305 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE COFFEE TREE. The tree which produces coffee contains ten species, chiefly natives of the East In- dies, South America, and the Polynesian isles. The only species, however, that we have to notice in the present work is the cof- fee Arabica, of which there are two varieties, though both are sold in our shops as Turkey coffee, and possess similar qualities. The tree seldom rises more than 16 or 18 feet high, with an erect main stem, covered with a lightish brown bark: the leaves are oblong-ovate, and pointed; the flowers are set in clusters ; they are of a pure white, and possess a very plea- sant odour, but their duration is very transient. The fruit resembles a cherry.

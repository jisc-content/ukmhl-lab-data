194 METHOD OF PREPARING BACON, &C. The season for killing hogs for bacon is between October and March* The articles to be salted are sprinkled over with bay- salt, and put for twenty-four hours in the salting trough, to allow the adhering blood to drain away. After this they take them out, wipe them very dry, and throw away the draining. They then take some fresh hay-salt, and heating it well in a frying-pan, rub the meat very well with it, repeating this every day for four days, turning the sides every other day. If the hog be very large, they keep the sides in brine, turning them occasionally for three weeks ; after which they take them out, and let them be thoroughly dried in the usual manner.

130 COMPARATIVE DIMINUTION OF THE We are indebted to Professor Wallace (of Edinburgh) for the detail of a very accurate and extensive experiment in a public establishment* of which the results were* that, in pieces of 10lbs. weight, each 100lbs. of beef lost, on an average, by boiling, 26.4 ; baking, 30.2 ; and roasting, 32.2: mutton, the leg, by boiling, 2\A; by roasting, the shoulder, 31.1 ; the neck, 32.4; the loin, 35.9. Hence, generally speaking, mutton loses, by boiling, about one-fifth of its original weight, and beef about one-fourth; again, mutton and beef lose, by roasting, about one-third of their original weight. The loss arises, in roasting, from the melting out of the fat and the evaporation of the watery part of the juices, but the nutritious matters remain condensed in the solid meat when cooked ; but in boiling,

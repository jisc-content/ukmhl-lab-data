183 PICKLING AND DRY SALTING OF MEAT. Common salt is advantageously employ- ed as an antiseptic, to preserve aliments from spontaneous decomposition, and par- ticularly to prevent the putrefaction of animal food. In general, however, the large quantity of salt which is necessarily employed in this way, deteriorates the alimentary properties of the meat, and the longer it has been preserved, the less whole- some and digestible does it become. Meat, however, which has not been too long preserved, simply pickled, or corned meat as it is called, is but little injured or decomposed, it is still succulent and tender, easily digested, nourishing and wholesome enough.

300 ON THE INFUSION OF TEA. explained, by considering that the action of heat, retained by the silver vessel, so far exhausts the herb, as to leave very little soluble substance for a second infusion ; whereas, the reduced temperature of the water in the earthenware pot, by extracting only a small portion at first, leaves some soluble matter for the action of a subsequent infusion. The reason for pouring boiling water into the teapot, before the infusion of the tea is made, is, that the vessel, being pre- viously warm, may abstract less heat from the mixture, and thus admit a more power- ful action. Neither is it difficult to explain the fact, why the infusion of tea is stronger if only a small quantity of boiling water be first used, and more be added some time afterwards, for if we consider that only the water immediately in contact with the herb

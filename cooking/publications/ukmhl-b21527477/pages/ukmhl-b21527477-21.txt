Vli PREFACE. ! have animadverted on certain material errors, sometimes committed through ignorance or negli- gence, in the preparation of food, and various deli- cacies of the table; and I have also given hints that will be found useful, with regard to the prac- tice of making tea and coffee. And lastly, I have made some remarks on the construction of kitchen fire-places, to which I have added designs, ex- hibiting the most approved cooking apparatus, calculated for the use of private families or public establishments. In resuming the whole, I have endeavoured (and I hope with some degree of success,) to communi- cate to those to whom the superintendance of a family is entrusted, such useful culinary information as may lead to beneficial consequences. 1821.

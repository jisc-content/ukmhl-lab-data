133 BROTH May be defined a weak decoction of meat, slightly seasoned with the addi- tion of aromatic herbs, roots or spices, in which the flavour of the meat greatly pre- dominates. To produce a high flavoured broth, it is essential that the boiling of the meat be moderate, and continued for some time; the simmering should be done in a vessel nearly closed. Cooks consider it essential that the broth be clear ; the scum, or albu- men of the meat, which becomes coagu- lated and rises to the surface during the boiling, must therefore be removed from time to time.

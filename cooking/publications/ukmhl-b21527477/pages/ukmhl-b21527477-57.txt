COOKERY. 19 as a gormand, or a gourmet. The epicure Qr gormand is definedâ€”a man having accidentally been able to study the dif- ferent tastes of eatables, does accordingly select the best food and the most pleasing to his palate. His character is that of a practioner. The gourmet speculates more than he practises, and eminently prides himself in discerning the nicest degrees, and most evanescent shades of goodness and perfection in the different subjects pro- posed to him. He may be designated a man, who, by sipping a few drops out of the silver cup of the vintner, can instantly tell from what country the wine comes, and its age. The glutton practices without any regard to theory. The gormand, or epicure, unites theory with practice. The gourmet is merely theoretical.

176 GRAVY* strained off through a sieve. If the gravy he intended for made dishes, it is customary to give it the consistence of cream, by means of thickening paste. (See p. 160.) The meat is capable of furnishing an additional quantity of gravy. It is therefore covered with water and suffered to simmer for about one hour, or till the fluid is reduced to one half its bulk. One pound and a quarter of lean beef, or one pound and a half of veal, will afford one pint of strong gravy. When broth, soups, or gravy, are pre- served from day to day, in hot weather, they should be warmed up every day, and put into fresh scalded pans, this renders them less liable to spoil.

MARMALADES, JAMS, AND FRUIT PASTES. 259 burning. This accident is almost un- avoidable if the quantity be large, and the fire applied, as usual, under the pan; it may be effectually prevented, by pouring the mass, when it has acquired the con- sistence of syrup, into shallow eartheu pans, and placing those in ah oven with its door open, moderately heated ; which, acting uniformly on every part of the liquid, will soon reduce it to any degree of con- sistence required. This may likewise be done, and more securely, by setting the evaporating vessels in boiling wrater; but the evaporation is in this way very tedious. The application of steam by means of what is called a preserving pan, is the best con- trivance for preparing jams, fruit pastes, and all other culinary preparations, which are liable to become injured by a degree of heat exceeding that of boiling water.

120 ON THE CHEMICAL CHANGES OF fat itself. And since these membranes are for the most part exceedingly thin and easily ruptured, and since heat increases the volume of the fat which they contain, the application of heat in roasting or broiling- wili soon make all the membranes burst which are within its influence, and thus give a free passage for the juices to unite with each other. There is, according to these statements, but little loss of the substance of meat when roasted or broiled, and the chemical changes produced are so slight, that nearly all its nutritive elements must be preserved and concentrated in the cooked meat. When there is a watery medium used, through which heat is applied to animal food, as for example, in the process of stew ing or boiling, a portion of the fat, gelatine, and osmazome, is dissolved, and

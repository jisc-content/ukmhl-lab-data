44 EXTRAORDINARY GREAT EATERS, name of Tarare, who, at the age of 17, could devour in the course of 24 hours, a leg of beef weighing 24lbs. and thought nothing of swallowing the dinner dressed for fifteen German peasants. But those men were remarkable not only for the quantity of food they consumed, hut also for its quality, giving a preference to raw meat, and even living: flesh and blood. Domery, in one year, eat 174 cats, dead and alive; and Tarare was strongly sus- pected of having eaten an infant. Man can sustain the privation of food for several days, more or fewer in number, according to circumstancesâ€”the old better than the young, and the fat better than the lean. The absolute want of drink can be suffered only a short time, they have been strikingly described by Mungo Park and Ali Bey, as experienced in their own persons.

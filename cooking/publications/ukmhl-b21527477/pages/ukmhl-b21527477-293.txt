CONSERVATION OF RECENT FRUITS. 251 water, and the remainder being boiled up with a little sugar, makes a rich and agree- able syrup. The fruit ought not be cracked by the heat; some trials were made by keeping the bottles in a heat of 190Â° for three quar- ters of an hour, but the fruit was reduced nearly to a pulp. It is also advisable that the fruit be not quite ripe, nor should it be bruised. Some fruits may be preserved in a suc- culent state by being kept in water, without boiling. This is practised in regard to the cranberry : it also succeeds with the smaller kinds of apples. All pulpy fruits, such as damsons, plums, &c., if gathered when not quite ripe, and not wounded, may likewise be preserved, by putting them into dry bottles, so as to exclude the air, by sealing over the cork, and then burying them in a trench, with the cork downwards.

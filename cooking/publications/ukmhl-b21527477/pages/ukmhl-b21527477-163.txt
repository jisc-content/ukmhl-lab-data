123 COOKERY ON ANIMAL FOOD. on vegetable substances, though usually very slight and simple, are in some in- stances both striking and unexpected. For example, some sorts of vegetables are extremely acrid and even poisonous in their crude state, and altogether unfit for human food ; yet, by simply boiling them in water, they become bland, sweet, and wholesome. Several species of arum (cuckoo-pint), which are very acrid, and would be dan- gerous to use raw, become quite palatable pot-herbs when boiled. Their acrimony must reside in a very volatile principle, which, during the boiling, makes its escape, or is chemically altered; but the nature of this principle has not yet been accurately investigated by chemists. A more familiar example than this is found in onions, leeks, and garlick, whose acrimony and strong odour can be almost destroyed, or rather Gr 2

88 ROASTING IN AN OPEN OVEN. A Dutch or open oven is a machine for roasting small joints, such as fowls, &c. It consists of an arched box of tin open on one side, which side is placed against the fire. The joint being either suspended in the machine on a spit, or by a hook, or put on a low trevet placed on the bottom of the oven, which is moveable. The inside of the oven should be kept bright that it may re- flect the heat of the fire. This is the most economical and most expeditious method of roasting in the small way.

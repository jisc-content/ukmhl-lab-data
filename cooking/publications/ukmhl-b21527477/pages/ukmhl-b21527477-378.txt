COPPER COOKING UTENSILS. 356 vegetable acids, or saline preparations, at- tack utensils covered with a glaze, in the composition of which lead enters as a com- ponent part. Wooden Tubs lined with lead, should not, as they often are, be used for salting meat, as the salt brine corrodes the lead, and all compounds of this metal are dan- gerous to health. FINIS. C.

KINDS OF ANIMAL FOOD. 67 in mutton, superior to that of the female, which is always more tender, and of liner fibre than that of the uncastrated male. By destroying also the ovaries of the females, their flesh is rendered more delicate, though this operation is not often practised. The sow is the animal which is most usually operated upon with this view ; the flesh of the uncastrated boar is very coarse and bad. Even in calves the dif- ference is observable, and veal is greatly improved by castrating the males. The same practice greatly improves fowl, as in capons. Venison is rank, tough, lean, and ill flavoured, and not fit to be eaten when killed during the rutting season, in September and October; and salmon, when about to spawn, are also bad, and pro- hibited, we believe, by our laws, to be caught or sold.

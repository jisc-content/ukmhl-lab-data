FRUIT SYRUPS. 273 be considered as the basis of all syrups, and seems to be the degree of boiling syrup called smooth by the confectioners. After having squeezed the fruit for the syrup, leave the mass for several days undisturbed : a slight fermentation takes place, this will separate the mucilage and thick parenchyma which rendered the juice viscid. By degrees these matters subside, and very often the liquor appears perfectly clear. This liquor may be sepa- rated by decantation : put the remaining matter under the press, and by these means a juice not so clear as the preceding is ob- tained, but which easily becomes clear spontaneously, especially if put into bot- tles immediately on its being expressed, and suffered to ferment during some days ; by this means a transparent juice of the fruit is obtained.

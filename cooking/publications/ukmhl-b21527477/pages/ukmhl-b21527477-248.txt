206 PICKLING OF FISH. proceed from the fish when inclosed in the cask. For judging of the relative strength of different solutions of common salt, Mr. London recommends a glass bottle, with a ground-glass stopper, to be filled with brine made from a solution of solid salt in water; within this bottle are three glass bubbles, of different specific gravities, so graduated, that supposing the temperature of the air to be at sixty degrees of Fahren- heitâ€™s thermometer, and only one bubble floats on the surface, and that it indicates the specific gravity of the brine to be 1.155, containing about 20 parts salt, and 80 of water, which is insufficient to cure animal matters with certainty by immersion in it. When the second bubble floats, it indi- cates the specific gravity of the brine to be 1.180, or about 24 parts salt, and 76 parts

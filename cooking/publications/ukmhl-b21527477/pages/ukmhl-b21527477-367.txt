and cooking utensils. 325 which tbe stew-pans and kettles are put, is furnished with a moveable plate, directly over the fire-place. This contrivance is covenient for causing (when the plate is removed) the fire to act in a direct man- ner upon a vessel placed over the opening as occasion may require. The small door in front, above the fire bars, serves for throwing on the fuel. The door shown under the bars of the fire-place is furnished with a register, for regulating the heat. The door under the boiler, on the right hand side, and that under the baking closet, on the left hand, serve to keep in the heat. For cleaning the flues, a move- able cast iron slider is fitted in front, below the boiler, and another below the baking closet, as shown in the design.â€” The upper part of the flues are cleaned in the usual manner, above the iron hearth.

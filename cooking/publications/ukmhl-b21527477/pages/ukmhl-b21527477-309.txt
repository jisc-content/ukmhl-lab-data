267 PINE APPLE MARMALADE. Cut the fruit into small pieces, pound it in a mortar, and pass the mass through a coarse splinter sieve ; weigh the pulp, and add to every pound three-quarters of a pound of powdered loaf sugar, and six ounces of water, and simmer it as before described. APRICOT MARMALADE. Boil ripe apricots in water till they can be crushed between the fingers, then take them out, extract the stones, reduce the fruit to a pulp, and pass the mass through a sieve ; weigh the pulp, and to every pound take three-quarters of a pound of loaf sugar; simmer it till it hangs on the spoon, like a stiff jelly. Quince marma- lade may be prepared in a like manner. n 2

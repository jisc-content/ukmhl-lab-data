226 PRESERVATIVE EFFECTS OF FROST OK Substances, so long as they are hard frozen, probably undergo no chemical change, of which the most striking proof was afforded by the body of an animal, probably antediluvian, being found imbed- ded in a mass of ice at the mouth of the Lena ; but in the act of freezing, or of the subsequent thawing, some alteration is produced, which affects the nature of the substance.

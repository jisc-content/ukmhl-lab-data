METHOD OF CONSERVING APRICOTS. 253 push out the stone ; simmer them in water till nearly half done, then peel them, and simmer them again for about twenty mi- nutes in a syrup, made of two parts by measure of water, and one part by weight of loaf sugar. When this has been done, put them aside for about twelve hours ; strain off the syrup, and to one pint of it add four ounces of lump sugar, simmer the fruit again for about ten minutes in this concen- trated syrup ; skim off the impurities that rise to the surface, and repeat the simmer- ing of the fruit in the syrup three or four times; and, lastly, put the apricots into pots, and cover them with a syrup made of seven ounces, by measure, of water, and one pound of loaf sugar. Tie over or cork the jar to exclude the air.

291 RASPBERRY VINEGAR. Take a pound of fine gathered red rasp- berries, mash them in a wooden bowl, or earthenware pan, add to the pulp a pint and a half of vinegar ; make the mixture boiling hot, and strain it through a flannel bag. To every pint of liquor add a pound of lump sugar, suffer it to simmer in an earthen pipkin for about five minutes, and remove the scum as it rises. When cold put it into dry bottles. Or, better mash the raspberries, suffer them to ferment till the juice separates from the pulpy matter; then add to a pint of the mass a pint and a half of vinegar, let it simmer for a few minutes, and strain it through a flannel. o 2

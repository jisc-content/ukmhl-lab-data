IV The art of preparing good and wholesome food is, undoubtedly, a branch of chemistry$ the kitchen is a chemical laboratory ; all the processes employed for rendering alimentary substances fit for human sustenance, are chemical processes; and much waste of the materials, as well as labour to the parties, might often be spared, were those who practise this art, made acquainted with some simple chemical truths which invariably would lead to certain results. I have, in the first place, premised, as introductory to what follows, some general observations on the various kinds of alimentary substances commonly used for food; in which I haye noticed their chemical constitution, and comparative nutritive qualities. After these preliminary statements, I have pro- ceeded to explain the summary processes of the

OBSERVATIONS ON THE 172 August, the animal should not be killed till he is about four years old. Fowls—for boiling should be chosen as white as possible, those which have black less had better be roasted. The season of perfection in poultry is just before they have quite come to their full growth. Chickens three months old are very delicate. Age makes a striking- difference in the flesh of fowls, since after the age of twelve months it becomes tougher. The cock indeed, at that age, is only used for making soup. Pigeons—are in their greatest perfection in September, there is then the most plentiful and best food for them; their finest growth is just when they are full feathered. When they are in the pen- feathers, they are flabby; when they are full grown, and have flown some time, they are hard.

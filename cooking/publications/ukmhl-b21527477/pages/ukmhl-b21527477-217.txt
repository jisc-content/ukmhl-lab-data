CRIMPING OF FISH. 175 transverse sections of the muscles being made, and the fish immersed in cold water, the contractions called crimping1 takes place in about five minutes, but if the mass be large, it often requires 30 minutes to com- plete the process. The crimping of fresh water fish is said to require hard water, and the London fishmongers usually em- ploy it.‚Äù Mr. Carlisle found, that by crimping, the muscles subjected to the process have both their absolute weight, and their specific gravity increased, so that it appears, that water is absorbed and condensation takes place. It was also observed that the effect was greater in proportion to the vivaciousness of the fish. From these observations, it appears, that the object of crimping is first to retard the natural stiffening of the muscles, and then by the sudden application of cold water, to

216 METHOD OF PRESERVING COOKED leading- to putrefaction, or even counter- acting it, while by this combination it is effectually removed. The air accordingly, where the process is successful, is deprived of oxygen ; but if the heat were not suffi- ciently prolonged, and by far the greatest part of the air in the vessel not exhausted, putrefaction soon comes on. From experi- ments that have been made on this mode of preserving alimentary substances, it has been proved, that if the vessels were opened only for a short time and again closed, with- out heat being applied, the inclosed sub- stances soon putrefied: as they did also from mere exposure to the air. But if, after having been exposed even for an hour or two, they were re-placed, the vessels again treated as before, and then the due degree of heat ap- plied, they could be preserved as at first. And this repeated exposure to the air, and

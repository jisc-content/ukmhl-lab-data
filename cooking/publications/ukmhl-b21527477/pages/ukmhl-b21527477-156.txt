This doctrine, however, the expe- rience of every cook will disprove; for if the boiling be long continued, the fibres of the meat will alone remain, and so far from becoming more soft and pulpy, they will become dry and juiceless. If indeed the boiling point of the water be artificially increased above 212°, by pressure applied to the surface of the liquid, the fibres may be reduced to a pulp, quite homogeneous. When this is done by Papin’s digester, or by any other apparatus of the same kind, and when the process under such circum- stances is long continued, the hardest bones may be converted into jelly. It is only by boiling that the more gela- tinous parts of flesh can be completely extracted unaltered from such parts as are cartilaginous, ligamentous, or tendinous.

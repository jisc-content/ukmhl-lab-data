265 ORANGE MARMALADE. Marmalades scarcely differ from jams. This name is applied to those eomfitures which are composed of the firmer fruits, such as quinces, pine-apples, &c. ; whereas jams are made of the more juicy, esculent berries, such as strawberries, currants, mulberries, &c. Cut the oranges into pieces, remove the pulp, squeeze it through a sieve, and measure it. Boil the rind in water till it is quite soft, then clear it from the interior side of the white pulpy mass, so that nothing but the thin outer yellow rind is left. To every pint of the pulpy juice add three-quarters of a pound of coarsely pow- dered loaf sugar, and add also the rind of the yellow orange, cut into thin slips.

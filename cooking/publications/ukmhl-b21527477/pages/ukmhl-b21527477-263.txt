221 POTTED LOBSTER. Take the meat and eggs from the shell; season it with powdered mace, cloves, nut- meg, pepper, salt, and anchovy liquor. Pound the meat in a marble mortar, and reduce the liquor, by evaporation, to a thick jelly ; then put it and the meat together, with about one quarter of its weight of butter. Mix all together, and press it into a small pot; cover it with melted butter. When it is cold, put paper over the pots, and set them in a dry place. Craw fish, crabs, shrimps, and prawns, may be potted in the same way. i

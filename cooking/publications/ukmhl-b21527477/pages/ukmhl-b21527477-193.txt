OBSERVATIONS ON MADE DISHES. 151 that the French, who sit so long, and enjoy themselves so leisurely at dinner, rise, im- mediately after the dessert, from the table, and are ready for business ; and that the English, who hurry the dinner over, pass whole hours over the bottle as if time were of no value. Such are the inconsistencies of mankind, arising from different tastes and different circumstances. The construction of our kitchen grates and fire places, and the nature of the fuel we burn, are unfavourable to the slow and regular simmering with which made dishes are prepared; and, at the same time, that they are unfavourable for made dishes, they are exactly what is wanted for English cook- ery. The construction of the grates, to- gether with the nature of the fuel, produce a fierce scorching fire, so that the direct rays of heat may be made to impinge on the substance to be cooked.

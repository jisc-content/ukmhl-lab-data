132 PRIMARY OR CHIEF DISHES OF THE ENGLISH TABLE. The principal or chief dishes that are prepared for the English table, what the scientific cooks for the marshals and ge- nerals of France would term dishes of the first order, are few in number. Flesh, fowl and fish, roasted, boiled or fried, accompanied by some simple and easy made puddings and pies, are the primary dishes of an English table. Soups and broths are less generally made use of; and the flesh, fowl and fish, served up in made dishes, are, like the lord mayor in his state coach, generally less noticed than the attendants.

222 PRESERVATION OF EGGS. Eggs may be kept for three or four months, or more, if the pores of the shell be closed, and rendered impervious to air by some unctuous application. We generally anoint them with mutton-suet, melted, and set them on end, wedged close together, in bran, stratum super stratum% the containing box being closely covered. Another method of preserving eggs is, to place them into a vessel containing lime water, or more properly slacked quick- lime diluted with water, to the consistence of a thin cream, taking care that the eggs are completely covered with this liquid. The first mentioned process is, however, preferable, and answers exceedingly well.

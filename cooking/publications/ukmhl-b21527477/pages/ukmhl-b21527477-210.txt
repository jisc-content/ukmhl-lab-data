168 OBSERVATIONS ON THE The following* wholesome advice on this subject we copy from Doctor Kitchiner : * —-cc When you order meat, poultry, or fish, tell the tradesman when you intend to dress it, and he will then have it in his power to serve you with provision that will do him credit, which the finest meat, &c. in the world, will never do, unless it has been kept a proper time to be ripe and tender. If you have a well-ventilated larder, in a shady, dry situation, you may make still surer, by ordering in your meat and poultry, such a time before you want it as will render it tender, which the finest meat cannot be, unless hung a proper time, ac- cording to the season and nature of the meat, &c. but always till it has made some very slight advance towards putrefaction.” * The Cook’s Oracle.

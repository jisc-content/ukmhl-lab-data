NATURAL HISTORY OF THE COFFEE TREE. 307 trees and roasted themselves, were as well flavoured as any of the coffee brought from Mocha; so that the fault is in the drying*, and bringing over; for if in the drying of the berries they be laid in rooms near the sugar-works, or near the house where rum is distilled, the berries soon im- bibe the surrounding effluvia, which will greatly alter their flavour. In like manner the coffee brought in the same ships with rum and sugar, were the coffee ever so good, would hereby be entirely altered. Raw coffee materially becomes amelio- rated by age. It should be kept in bags, or vessels permeable to air, and in a dry, or rather warm place.

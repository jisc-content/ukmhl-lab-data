BEEF, AND FISH. 201 in Swansea, and its vicinity, practise, with the greatest success, this mode of curing hams, tongues, beef, fish, &c.” “ This acid is very easily and cheaply pre- pared : the first distilled product of the wood, in that state denominated black acid, answers the best when separated from its tar and naphtha. More than 70 gallons of acid, sufficiently strong, are procured from a ton of wood ; a gallon is quite sufficient for 2-| cvvt. of pork, beef, and most animal substances, with the addition of a compara- tively small portion of salt, not only afford- ing a considerable saving in this article, but also materially contributing to the increase of flavour and nutritive quality. Hams or beef cured this way require no previous soaking in water to being boiled, and when boiled swell in size and are extremely suc- culent.” k 3

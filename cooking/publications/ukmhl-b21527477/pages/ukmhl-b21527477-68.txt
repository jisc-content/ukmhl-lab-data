COOKERY. 30 Ill the olden time, every man of conse- quence had his magister coquorum, or master cook, without whom he would not think of making a day’s journey ; and it was often no easy matter to procure master cooks of talent. By a passage of Cicero* we are led to understand, that among other miseries of life, which constantly attended this consular personage and eloquent orator, he laboured under the disappointment of not having an excellent cook of his own; for, he says, “ coquus meus, prceter jus fervens, nihil potest imitari.” Except hot broth, my cook can do nothing cleverly. The salary of the Roman cooks was nearly £1000. f Mark Antony, hearing * Fam. ix. 20. t Tabella Cibaria, ps-19 and 20.

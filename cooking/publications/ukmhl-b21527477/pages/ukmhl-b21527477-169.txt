COMPARATIVE DIMINUTION, &C. 1*29 of beef to sell by retail, after it is boiled, get 19 lbs. of cold boiled beef from 25lbs. raw ; bat the meat is always rather underdone. Messrs. Donkin and Gamble boiled in steam 56 lbs. of captainâ€™s salt beef; the meat, when cold, without the bones, which amounted to 5lbs. 6 oz. weighed only 85lbs. In another experiment, 113lbs. of prime mess beef, gave 9lbs. 10 oz. of bones, and. 47lbs. 8 oz. meat; and in a third, 2131bs. mess beef gave 13 lbs. 8 oz. bones, and 103 lbs. 10 oz. meat; or, taken in the aggre- gate, 372 lbs. of salt beef, including bones, furnish, when boiled, 186lbs. 2 oz., without bone, being about 50 per cent.; or, disre- garding* the bone altogether, salt meat loses, by boiling, about 44.2 per cwt. or nearly half. g 3

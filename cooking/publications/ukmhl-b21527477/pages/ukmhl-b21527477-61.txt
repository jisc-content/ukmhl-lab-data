23 COOKERY. an individual, young or old, in any civilized country, who has not some time or other suffered severely from errors committed in the practice of this art. “ A skilful and well directed cookery abounds in chemical preparations highly salutary. There exists a salubrity of ali- ments suited to every age. Infancy, youth, maturity, and old age, each has its peculiar adapted food, and that not merely appli- cable to the powers in full vigour, but to stomachs feeble by nature, and to those debilitated by excess.”* Without abetting the unnatural and in- jurious appetites of the epicure, or the blameable indulgences of the glutton, we shall not perhaps be far out in our reckon- ing, if we assert, that almost every person is an epicure in his own way. * Ude’s Cookery, p. 25.—Ibid, 23.

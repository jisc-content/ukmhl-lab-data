35 PLASMON ARROWROOT. Plasmon Arrowroot is composed of the purest Arrowroot and Plasmon in dietetically suitable proportions. Plasmon Arrowroot is a highly strengthening food, and is specially suitable in cases of Acute Diarrhoea in Children and Adults ; it is useful also in cases of Chronic Diarrhoea and Dysentery, and in all conditions where a light nutritious diet is indicated. The chief requirement in cases of Diarrhoea—particularly in Children— is a form of nourishment which sus- tains the strength without aggravating the intestinal disorder. Plasmon Arrowroot at once controls the intestinal flow and provides nourishment in a form which is ab- solutely non-irritating, well retained and easily digested; it is quickly assimilated, and speedily revives and sustains the strength. PLASMON BISCUITS. Plasmon Biscuits are made in many varieties—sweet, unsweetened, whole- meal, celery flavour, ginger nuts and special biscuits for sportsmen, cyclists, etc., etc.

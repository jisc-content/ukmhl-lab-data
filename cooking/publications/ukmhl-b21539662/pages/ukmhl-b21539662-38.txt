:4 BEEF PLASMON. This is a scientifically complete food, being a combination of Beef Extract and Plasmon. The ideal meat preparation which Liebig stated would far surpass his extract of meat, but which he, at the time, saw no prospect of being realised, has now been obtained in Beef Plas- mon — which is composed of pure extract of meat combined with Plasmon —the natural albumen with its phos- phates and other salts. Beef Plasmon thus contains both nourishing and stimulating qualities. It is free from added salt and colouring matters and flavourings, and can therefore be fla- voured to taste by the addition of sail, or any flavouring. Beef Plasmon is useful for enriching gravies, stews, &c. It may be mixed with a little butter and salt for sandwiches. Liebig adds : “ Were it possible to furnish the market with a preparation of meat combining in itself the albu- men, together with the extractive principles, such a preparation 'would have to be preferred to the Extract of Beef for it would contain all the nutritive constituents of meat.”

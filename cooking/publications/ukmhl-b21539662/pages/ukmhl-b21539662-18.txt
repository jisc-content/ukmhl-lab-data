There are not many varieties of meat, but few species of fish, and not too many vegetables. How, then, can one obtain variety ? This is answered by Plasmon, which will prove an excellent aid to bring about variety, by taking the following recipes as a basis for a number of other dishes by merely substituting the chief in- gredient for another. Variety, it is often said, not only charms the palate, but frequently it is the means of creating an appetite in those to whom the mere thouglit of food has been distasteful. Good cooking does not always mean expensive cooking, and as a rule the best cooks are the most economical. The use of Plasmon spells interior economy, because, when pro- perly blended and treated upon correct culinary lines, food thus prepared fulfils that important mission of mak- ing it more wholesome, more varied, more pleasurable, and therefore more profitable in the end.

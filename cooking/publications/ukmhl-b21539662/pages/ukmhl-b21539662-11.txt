9 The Lancet, August nth, 1900, page 40* “ The introduction of Plasmon marks an important advance in the separation of the nutrient material without any deterioration of its dietetic quality frcm the most natural of all foods—milk. It is to be feared that in the preparation of many foods the process adopted seriously affects the nourishing qualities of the material in its original state. Chemical analysis may show an excellent proportion of flesh-forming constituents, but only physio- logical evidence can decide upon the rca. nourishing quality of the food product Plasmon has satisfied both chemical and physiological enquiries. At no step in the process is objectionable chemical treatment introduced. Plasmon has been found of great value as a nutrient in enfeebled conditions of the digestive organs, and to be an excellent means of administering food to the sick. Jt is important to point out that Plasmon con- tains, as our analysis shows, the salts of milk, including the phosphates. It is obvious that Plasmon may be employed with the greatest advajitage for enriching foods or for raising their actual fesh-forming value to a high and trustworthy degree. The preparation is one worthy of the highest praise." How to Use Plasmon, see pageb 12 and following.

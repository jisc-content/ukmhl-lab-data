Albu- men, termed proteid, is the nourishing principal contained, in varying quan- tities, in all foodsâ€”whether animal or vegetable. It is the principal sub- stance absorbed by the system for forming and feeding all the component parts of the human body, blood, muscles, nerve, bone, brain, etc., and for renewing the waste which is con- tinually taking place. Flesh-forming albumen is only pre- sent in very small quantities in most foods; it results, therefore, that a large bulk of food is eaten without perfect nourishment being obtained. The albumen (proteid) in fresh milk is the nutriment provided by nature, and is therefore the most perfect form of food. But the milk albumen (pro- teid) is liable to speedy changes, which render it insoluble and indigestible. Any addition of a free alkali, carbonate

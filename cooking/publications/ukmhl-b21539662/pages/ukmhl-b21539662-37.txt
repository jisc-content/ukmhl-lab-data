33 ried three sticks of Plasmom Choco^ LATE each. None of us suffered the slightest from heat or fatigue or hun- ger, although we had breakfast at 5.30 a.m. and did not mess until 8 p.m. One of the senior captains told me that, with the exception of the Chocolate and a drink of lime juice and soda, he had absolutely nothing be- tween times, and that he felt quite fresh and had no feeling of exhaustion.” Professor Jago, in his Lecture before the Society of Arts, December 3rd, 1901, on the Nutritive Value of Sweets, Cantor Lecture III., stated :— Plasmon Chocolate contains ly’g pro- teid, or as a proportion of i to 3, as against milk chocolate of the best brand, which contains only i to 10. Plasmon Chocolate is thus over three limes more nourishing’ than the best milk chocolate.” Professor Jago stated further that Plasmon Chocolate is complete in its proportions of sugar, cocoa, fat and proteid for what is re- quired to make a perfect food. ‘'It is,” he adds, "doubtful whether any more concen- trated form of nutriment than this mixture of chocolate and milk proteid is possible, ana certainly there is no other form likely to be discovered outvieing it in palatability. Such a preparation should have an immense value as an emergency ration for explorers and soldiers on active service.”

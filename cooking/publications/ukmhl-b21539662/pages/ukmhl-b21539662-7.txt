5 For these reasons, Plasmon invigor- ates the digestive system, so that other foods taken with it or after it, are more easily digested. Although it increases the weight, it does not do so by inducing an undue accumulation of fatâ€”but not only gives strength to the digestive system, but speedily rectifies all evils arising from imperfect diges- tion, and the use of non-nourishing foods. Plasmon, being economical, free from flavour and smell and perfectly soluble, is an ideal addition to all descriptions of foods. Scientific Reports, together with the notices and analyses from The British Medical Journal^ The Lancet^ The Medical Press and Circular^ etc., show that Plasmon is a pure food, not a drag, and does not contain a drug. Medical men testify to its important value as a health and strength-giving food fer the sick, the convalescent and the delicate.

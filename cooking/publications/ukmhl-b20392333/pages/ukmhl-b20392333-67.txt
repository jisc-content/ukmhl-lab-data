DIET IN DIFFERENT DISEASES. DIET FOR INFANTS. Resort to artificial food, though sometimes necessary, is always unfortunate for the baby. Trouble then be- gins. The baby fortunate enough to have a healthy mother and a natural diet acquires a strength and vigor which are of incalculable value in after-life. For the first three days of the baby's life a little sweetened water in a spoon is all-sufiicient. It is de- sirable to adopt, as far as practicable, regular periods for nursing. Once in every three hours during the daytime and about twice at night for the first month will generally be sufficient. After the first month three times during the day and once in tlie night will ordinarily suffice. This may be continued until the child is six months old. According to many and the best authorities, no fari- naceous food or thickening of any kind whatever should be given to a child under six months old. (See Appen- dix, page 216.) The child is until then " wholly un- provided with the physiological machinery requisite for the digestion of starchy foods." After six months the capacity for digesting starchy foods commences, and then a little gruel of sifted Graham flour, or barley, or cornmeal may be given. If the mother can nurse the child even partially, it is better to do so. If she cannot nurse the child at all, of course it is far better to procure a wet nurse than resort to cow's milk. Great 3

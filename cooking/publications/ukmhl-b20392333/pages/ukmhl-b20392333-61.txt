peptonized Milk Jelly. 43 milk-strainer or sieve. Pour it into cups or moulds (previously wet with cold water), and set in a cold place. This jelly can be made of any flavor, with or without wine or spirits. It is very good when flavored with lemon or orange alone, or with lemon or almond ex- tract. When the milk is thoroughly peptonized (brought to a point when a slight bitter taste is detected), lemon juice or acids will not curdle it, as with the ordinary milk. The milk gruels can be used as well as the milk it- self in making jelly.

78 Corpulency. sherry or madeira (lieat-prodncing wines), or of rusks, wliich are sweet biscuits, is doubtful. The following comprise the fat-producing foods, viz.: Milk, cream, butter, fats, soups, puddings, pastry, su- gar, candies, cake, and all sweet dishes, rice, corn-starch, and all the farinaceous foods (excepting toasted bread or bread crust), potatoes, corn—in fact all edible roots and vegetables growing under ground—sweet fruits, and spirituous and malt liquors. The following are non-fat-producing foods, viz.: All the meats, poultry, and game, with the excep- tion of the fat portions thereof, oysters and shell-fish ; celery, spinach, and all the greens, cabbage, onions, let- tuce, squash, tomatoes, and other vegetables containing little or no starch, and all acid fruits. Dr. Dobell thinks that a certain amount of fat should be taken with the food. On this subject, he says : " On comparing the following analysis of Mr. Banting's diet for getting thin with my tables of normal diets, it will be seen that it yields less than half the normal quantity of carbon, leaving the deficiency to be ob- tained from the fat already stored up in the system, by the consumption of which the obesity is removed. The fault consists in this reduction of carbon being obtained by diminishing the hydrocarbons (fats) of the foods in- stead of only cutting off the carbohydrates (sugar and starch). It has happened to me to have much to do with a great number of persons who have tried Bant- ingism, and I do not hesitate to say that Mr. Banting has done a great deal more harm than good. Mr. Banting candidly told his readers that he was ignorant of the physiology of food.

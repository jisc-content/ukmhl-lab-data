Preface. vi ining medical students, reveals a tendency in them to consider themselves ' medicine men,' as is shown by the undue importance they attach to the pills, powders, and potions they are prepared to give. They ignore the great fact that upon a carefully selected diet the patient must depend for the natural strength which is to be the chief reliance in stemming the adverse tide." The professor might have added more; for the treat- ment of most chronic complaints is chiefly dietetical and hygienic, rather than medicinal. The science is comparatively new which treats of the chemical composition, preparation, and physiological effects of foods. May the time come when nothing in the way of dietetical treatment need be left to the fickle appetites of patients, nothing to the judgments of anx- ious friends, and nothing to untrained cooks! If this hand-book — intended to be small, though the subject is large — can be of use in the direction just indicated, it will give great pleasure and satisfac- tion to The Authoe. St. Louis, March, 1885.

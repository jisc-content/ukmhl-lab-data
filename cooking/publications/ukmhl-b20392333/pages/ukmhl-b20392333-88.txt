A vegetable diet is also recommended by most of the authorities (Chambers being an exception), on the sup- position that meat throws extra work upon the kidneys. In the use of the grain foods such preparations only should be selected as contain the full nutriment of the grain (see pages, 26, 207). A diet wholly or partially of milk is much recom- mended. Niemeyer says: " In a series of cases which have been described by Dr. Schmidt, in his inaugural thesis, I have obtained most brilliant results, where all other treatment has failed, by putting the patients on an almost exclusive diet of milk." The ordinary mixed diet should be gradually changed in favor of the milk diet, until one exclusively of milk is finally reached. This should be kept up for a month or so, when improvement is almost certain. The patient should drink freely of pure soft water, as that carries off much of the impurities of the blood. Flax-seed tea is at times beneficial. No alcoholic or malt liquors should be allowed in any form. They act as a certain poison in kidney affections, and their exces- sive use, without doubt, is the provoking cause of a ma- jority of such diseases.

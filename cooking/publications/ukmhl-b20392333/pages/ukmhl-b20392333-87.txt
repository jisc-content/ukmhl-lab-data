BRIGHT'S DISEASE. Pavy says: " Physiology teaches us that the kidneys perform an eliminative office. The water which they remove in regulating the amount of fluid in the system is made the vehicle for carrying off solid matter, consist- ing of useless products of the metamorphosis of the food, and effete materials, resulting from the disintegration of the tissues, which poison and produce death, if al- lowed to accumulate in the blood. In Bright's disease their eliminative capacity is interfered with. "The amount of urinary matter to be discharged is largely dependent upon the nature of the food. The fats and carbohydrates* throw no woi'k upon the kid- neys. The products of their utilization—carbonic acid and water—pass off through another channel. " The nitrogenous ingesta, on the other hand, in great part undergo metamorphosis, and yield their nitrogen to be carried off in combination with a portion of their other elements, under the form of urinary products. In this way the kidneys become taxed by the food. So a vegetable diet should preponderate. "It must not be lost sight of, that, on acconnt of the escape of albumen, an extra amount of nitrogenous mat- ter should be supplied to make up for the loss of alba- men. In Bright's disease the kidney is contracted, and frequently the escape of albumen is insignificant, and * Composed of starch.

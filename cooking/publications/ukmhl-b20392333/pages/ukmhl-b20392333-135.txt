117 Sip;pets. .roperly made, it becomes the most unwholesome of The slices should be cut quite thin and even, the shapes made regular by cutting off the crust and uneven sides. The scraps of bread left may be dried and saved in a can for bread-crumbing, i. e., they are not to be wasted. The slices can be placed on a tin platter and dried for a little time in the open oven, or at the top of the range, when they will toast very quickly. The operation is not so quick without this drying process, for then the slices must be placed in the toaster and simply turned from one side to the other without coloring until the bread is thoroughly dried through, then it should receive a deep yellow color quite even and artistic. If allowed to color at first it will be dif- ficult to di-y the interior. If the toast is to be served dry it should be served immediately on a warm plate; indeed, the bread should not be toasted nntil the person for whom it is intended is ready to eat it. If the toast is made to serve with a poached egg, a bird, or a vegetable, a little boiling wa- ter should be poured in the bottom of the plate to partly soften the toast. It should be buttered, and salt- ed slightly also, as soon as cooked. A prettier way of serving toast is in the form of Sippets. Cut thin slices of bread into parallelogram strips; toast them carefully and evenly, without breaking, un- til they are crisp and golden. Serve them on ^ a hot plate as soon as they come from the fire, arranged as in cut, and 'â€”^ slightly buttered if there be no objection.

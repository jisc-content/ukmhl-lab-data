154 Little Dishes. bubbling, add a generous tablespoonful (a quarter of a cupful) of flour; let it cook a minute, and then add a cupful of stock, half a cupful of cream, two table- spoonfuls of grated cheese, fifth of a nutmeg (grated), salt, little pepper, and, when all is well mixed and cooked for a couple of minutes, take the mixture from the fire and stir in also the beaten yolk of an egg. Eeturn the saucepan to the fire to cook tlie egg slightly, but do not let it boil, as that Avould curdle the egg. Now mix in evenly the macaroni rings (two cupfuls), and spread the mixture about half an inch in thickness over a pan. When cold it should be made into croquette form, egged and bread-crumbed, to be fried in boiling lard. This mixture is quite soft to handle, but with a little practice it is easily managed. Take enough for a cro- quette with a spoon ; shape it on the table with a knife; sprinkle over some sifted cracker crumbs, then lift it dexterously with a pancake turner on the plate of slightly beaten egg; turn it over with the pancake turner; then again lift it to a plate of sifted cracker crumbs. It can now be rolled without trouble. Croquettes of all kinds are better to be quite soft. Cheese served in this manner is not indigestible, ac- cording to M. Mattieu Williams in an article on " The Chemistry of Cookery," published in the Popular Sci- ence Monthly. Mr. Williams asserts, with good reason- ing, that cheese, although indigestible when eaten raw, is very digestible when cooked and mixed with other arti- cles of food. The diet is so hearty and rich, that when eaten in much quantity, other food should not be taken at the same time. In this receipt the cheese can be omitted if preferred. These croquettes are to be served with tomato sauce.

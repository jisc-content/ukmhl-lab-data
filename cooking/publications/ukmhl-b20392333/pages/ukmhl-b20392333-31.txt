Buttermilk contains, the same as skimmed milk, the full nourishment of the milk without the fat; how- ever, it retains a very small proportion of fat, less than skimmed milk. It is very beneficial in some weak con- ditions of the stomach (dyspepsia, fever, etc.). Dr. Ballot, of Eotterdam, has had miTch to say about the value of buttermilk in the treatment of infants for summer complaint, cholera infantum, etc. Koumiss, or peptonized milk, might be found equally efficacious, and possibly preferable, in many cases. Whey. Whey is almost without nutritive value. As a drink in febrile or inflammatory conditions it is refreshing and often beneficial. It is sometimes recommended to per- sons who find difficulty in retaining food in the stomach. However, in such cases, koumiss would probably be of greater value, Anmal Foods.

It is very digestible, and because of its fine texture and richness in red-blood juices, it furnishes more nutriment in proportion to weight than any other meat.

To be at perfection the animal should be four years old, not worked, and partly corn-fed.

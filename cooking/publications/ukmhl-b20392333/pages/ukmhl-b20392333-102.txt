84: Something about Longevity. twelve couples had been married from one hundred to one hundred and five years, and another couple one hundred and ten years, so tliat this last pair were doubt- less one hundred and thirty years old," Thomas Parr, buried in Westminster Abbey, died in 1655, at the age of one hundred and fifty-two. He lived in Shropshire, England, a place noted for its long- lived people. He was a farmer of extremely abstemious habits, his diet being chiefly milk and coarse bread. He married his second wife when one hundred and twenty- two, and worked at the age of one hundred and thirty. He was taken to court in his one hundred and fifty- second year as a curiosity, by the Earl of Arundel, and his life was prematurely cut off on account of the change from a parsimonious to a plentiful diet. Two of his grandsons lived to be each one hundred and twenty- seven years old, and a third grandson to be one hun- dred and nine; and Robert Parr, a great grandson, died in Shropshire, in 1757, aged one hundred and twenty- four. Mr. Ephraim Pratt, of Sliutesbury, Mass., who died at the age of one hundred and seventeen years, lived chiefly on milk, and his son, Michael Pratt, attained the age of one hundred and three by similar means. A study of the subject shows us that great longevity has always been accompanied by abstemiousness in diet; also, that great eaters never live long.

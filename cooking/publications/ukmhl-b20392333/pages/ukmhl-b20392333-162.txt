Little Dishes. 144 properly cooked beef is pinkish-red. The inner cuts are the most digestible." Beef Sandwich. Scrape very fine two or three tablespoonfuls of fresh, juicy, tender, uncooked beef; season it slightly with pepper and salt; spread it between two thin slices of slightly buttered bread, cut it neatly into little dia- monds and serve. A Venison Steak. A venison steak should be cooked in the same man- ner as a beefsteak, A little melted currant jelly is a pleasant addition. It is sometimes made in the form of a sauce by di- luting the jelly with a little water, and thickening it with a little corn- starch or flour. A Mutton Chop. A cut from the loin is best. One containing a large tenderloin could be chosen for our invalid. Let it be cut thick and leave on it plenty of the fat. Broil as described for beefsteak. Serve with mashed potatoes or other vegetables, and decorate it artistically. Breast of Chicken. For an invalid a chicken fricassee or a tender bit of boiled chicken is most desirable. A breast of a tender chicken, seasoned and rubbed with butter, and thrown on some burning charcoals which are not too hot, is very sa- vory. If skilfully cooked the surface will be very little charred, and the inside will be very tender and juicy. When done, season again with butter, pepper, and salt.

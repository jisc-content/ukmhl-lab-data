Diet for the Corpulent. 79 « The facts in the case are these: 1. A certain amount of fat in the system is one of the most essential ele- ments of health. 2. The quantity required by differ- ent individuals to maintain health difiers. As much fat should be taken as the stomach likes. 3. The effects of a deficiency of the quantity actually required are most disastrous, the tissues of the body and the brain and nerves being at length disintegrated to supply the elements of fat which they contain. 4. When there is a quantity of fat in the body in excess of that necessary to health, it may be lessened with great and (needed) ad- vantage, provided it be done slowly and without cutting off too much of the fat element of food." There is much to be gained by observing certain other rules, aside from the dietary. For instance, every morning a hasty cold water sponge-bath should be taken, and the body should be well rubbed with a crash towel. And whenever the body is too warm, the cold water sponge-batli may be repeated without a general undress. The clothing should not be too warm. All the bodily exercise that can be taken without fatigue should be persistently kept up. • The vibratory-motion machine is most excellent for reducing fat. This ma- chine makes two thousand vibrations a minute, and is made to accommodate different portions of the body. To those who are unable to take other and ordinary ex- ercise this machine is especially recommended. Its action is to produce a rapid circulation of the blood, which takes up and carries off adipose and effete matter. With plenty of exercise there will be less need of an exacting dietary.

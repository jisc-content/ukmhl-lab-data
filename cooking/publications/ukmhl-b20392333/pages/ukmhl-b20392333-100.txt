82 Something about Longevity. lation reached its thirty-ninth edition in 1845. Cornaro exclaims: " O blessed temperance, how worthy art thou of our highest esteem ! and how infinitely art thou pref- erable to the irregular and disordei'ly life! There is as wide a difference between you as there is between light and darkness, heaven and hell." Again, he says, in older age: " O sacred and most beautiful temper- ance ! how greatly am I indebted to thee for rescuing me from such fatal delusions, and for bringing me to the enjoyment of so many felicities, and which over and above these favors conferred on your old man, has so strengthened his stomach that he has now a better rel- ish for his dry bread than he had formerly for the most exquisite dainties! My spirits are not injured by what I eat, they are only revived and supported by it." To a distinguished archbishop he again wrote: "Is it not a charming thing that I am able to tell you that my health and strength are in so excellent a state? that instead of diminishing with my age, they seem to increase as I grow old ? all of my acquaintances are surprised at it, and I, who know the cause of this singular happiness, do everywhere declare it. ... I confess it was not with- out great work that I abandoned my luxurious way of life." When Cornaro was ninety-five, he wrote: " I find myself as healthy and brisk as if I were but twenty- five. Most of 3'our old men have scarce arrived at sixty before they find themselves loaded with infirmities. They are melancholy, unhealthful, always full of dread- ful apprehension of dying." There are many famous instances of longevity. Count Jean Frederick de Waldeck died in Paris, in 1875, at the age of one hundred and nine. He had been conspicuously before the world for over ninety years. He became member and honorary member of the prin- cipal learned societies of London and Paris.

Graham Sjponge Cake. 193 fill all together) witli six tablespoonf iils (a scant half cup- ful) of cold water. Add to this two cupfuls of boiling water, and let it simmer over the fire three or four min- utes, until the flour is thoroughly cooked. Take it off the fire, and when partly cooled add the yolks of three eggs, beaten with one and a half cupfuls of sugar to a froth, a piece of butter the size of a black-walnut, and the grated rind and juice of a large lemon. Bake with un- der crusts, and when done spread over the top the beat- en whites of three eggs, with a heaping teaspoonful of sugar added (after they are beaten), and color in the oveii. The pie is much more attractive if the meringue is put on in fancy design, with a paper funnel (made of thick writing-paper and a pin) or the meringue deco- rator. The egg froth should be slightly sweetened, and flavored by stirring in the yellow cuts of lemon peel, which are afterwards removed. The lemon peel gives delicate flavor as well as color to the meringue. The pie-paste can be made more wholesome by using very little lard or butter and a small portion of baking- powder. Or, the paste may be made with half Graham flour (sifted) and half white flour, a little baking-pow- der, and mixed with cream. The crust may be rubbed over with a little of the beaten white of an egg before the custard is added, which will prevent it from soaking into the crust. The custard may be baked in a little pudding dish without pie crust.

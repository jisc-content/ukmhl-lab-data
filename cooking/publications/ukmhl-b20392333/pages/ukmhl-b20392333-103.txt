UTENSILS. A Double Tin Steamer with double tin cover and copper bottom is invaluable among cooking utensils, es- pecially for making several dishes suitable for the sick. The double tight-fitting cover, perfectly securing the heat, cannot be satisfactorily supplied with any impro- vised cover. The steamer is also a valuable utensil as a lain marie; i. e., for keeping any cooked dish hot. DOUBLK TIN STEAMER. For this purpose the steamer containing hot (not boil- ing) water is kept at the back of the range. The double cover and the hot - water lining protect^ soup, vegetables, sauce, oysters, or any dish placed inside. The flavor of a dish is almost perfectly preserved when kept in this manner.

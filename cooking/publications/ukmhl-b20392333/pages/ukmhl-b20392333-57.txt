ARTIFICIAL DIGESTION- BY MEAN'S OF PANCREATIC FERMENTS. Important discoveries have lately been made in the matter of supplying artificially digested, or partly di- gested, food, which is of great benefit in the treatment of certain diseased conditions. The digestive agent is pancreatic juice, or ferment, which can be taken from animals in an active, potent form. This is mixed with milk, milk gruel, milk punch, beef tea, and other foods, as explained in the receipts. Such digested food is es- pecially indicated when there is an inability to digest the caseiue of milk, or starch or fats, as often occurs with infants unable to retain milk in the stomach, and with consumptives who cannot digest fats. It is also indicated in cases of extreme emaciation or weakness, in cases of typhoid fevers,* and especially in gastric troubles brought on by alcoholic excesses. It is probably better to resort to artificial digestion only in extreme cases, where exercise and bracing air cannot accomplish their usual results in aid of natural digestion. Pepsin for stomachic indigestion has long been in use. Much of the digestive process, especially in the case of fats and starches, takes place when the food has left the stomach and entered the large intestine. This * The ulcerated bowels, common to typhoid fever, must not be exposed to the irritation of foods that leave a solid residue after digestion. The curdling of the caseine of milk can be prevented by giving it already di- gested (peptonized).

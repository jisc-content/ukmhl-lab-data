Broiled Fish. For this purpose a white fish from the lakes, or a bass is generally used. The two sides of the fish are spread open by cutting partly through the back. It is seasoned with pepper and salt and sprinkled well with flour. The inside of the fish is first presented to the fire on a gridiron, well greased with lard or a piece of pork. As the fish can only be turned once, it must be watched carefully to avoid burning. Before turning, loosen the fish carefully from the gridiron with a knife or pancake turner. If large, place a platter close over the top, and, turning the grtdiron, the fish is left in the platter, when it can be easily slid to the gridiron again, for the pur- pose of cooking the other side.

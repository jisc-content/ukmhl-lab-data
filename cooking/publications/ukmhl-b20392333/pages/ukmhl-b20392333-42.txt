Remarks about Foods. 24 marketable strawberries are so very acid and devoid of flavor, that they, especially, cannot be recommended to invalids. Stewed fruits (compotes) are very wholesome and beneficial for almost any one. They should be served in some form every day, provided a laxative diet is not at the time objectionable.

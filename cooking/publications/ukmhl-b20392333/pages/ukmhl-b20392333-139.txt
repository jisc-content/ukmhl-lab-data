Dixie Biscuits. 121 warm; in the meantime put the yeast cake to dissolve in a couple of tablespoonfuls of milk, and so soon as the yeast becomes soft, rub it smooth and add it to the milk and lard when the latter are lukewarm (not before). Mix the salt and flour well together; make a M^ell in the middle, pour in the egg, well beaten, with the sugar, then the milk, lard, and yeast. Stir all well together with a spoon, place it in a moderately warm place at the side of the range. When it has risen light (about an hour, or possibly a little longer), knead it, without add- ing more flour, about flfteen or twenty minutes, always stretching out the dough towards you, doubling it, and kneading on top (to form a proper grain). Cover and set it away nntil it has risen quite light again (about three or four hours). Then roll it out a good half-inch thick; cut it neatly with a cutter about two and three fourths inches in diameter; roll the smaller cuts left, to about half the thickness of the other, and cut it with a second cutter two inches in diameter (a kitchen pep- per-box top will do). Place the small cuts on top the large ones in a platter, and do not place the large ones too near each other. When all are arranged set them away to rise for the tliird time (about an hour). When quite light, bake in a quick oven. If the biscuits are wanted for the invalid's six-o'clock tea, they should be begun about half-past ten o'clock in the morning. Or the dough (without the egg and sugar if for a dinner or break- fast bread) can be made in the form of braids, as shown in cut. This is easily done. Three rolls of even size are braided, the ends trimmed and turned under. 6

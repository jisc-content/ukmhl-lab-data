SOMETHING ABOUT LONGEVITT. Before the age of eighty, it is not years that make us old. It is want of health, either inherited or brought on by our own imprudences. Health is youth. Many are younger at sixty than others at twenty. The person in health is always yonng. The invalid is always old. To him life is without enjoyment, without energy, and without aspiration. And yet, when health is every- thing, life itself, how little it is guarded ! how little ap- preciated, except when lost! What a plaything it is! And so our youth is our middle age. Our middle age is our old age. When it is time to live and enjoy tlie fruits of experience, stud}', and labor, we are practically dead. Men have lost their vigor at sixty, and women have lost their beauty at forty. There are some who stop to think. They discuss ill- ventilated bedrooms, temperance, corsets, graham bread, Dieu nous defend! What disagreeable subjects! What cranks and crazy theorists they are ! These theorists attack established habits. Fixed habits are tyrants, and their power is irresistible, and so the study of health is unpopular. Sickness alone must be considered. There is no doubt that the natural period of human life is greatly shortened by long and perverse violation of natural laws, and that the requirements to guard the divine gift are many. The total length of life among dumb animals is about five times the period between birth and full maturity.

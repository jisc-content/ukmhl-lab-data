Other Soups. 166 ounces ; one head of celery, say one ounce ; two tur- nips, say ten ounces ; one parsnip, say two ounces. Oystek Soup. To one quart, or twenty-five oysters, add a half-pint of water. Put the oysters on the fire in their liquor. The moment it begins to simmer (not boil, for that would shrivel the oysters), pour it through a colander into a dish, leaving the oysters in the colander. Now put into the saucepan two ounces of butter (size of an egg) when it bubbles, sprinkle in a heaping tablespoon- ful (one ounce) of sifted fiour; let the roux cook a few moments, without coloring ; stirring it well with the egg whisk, add to it gradually the oyster juice, and half a pint or a cupful of good cream (which has been brought to a boil in another vessel); season carefully with Cayenne pepper and salt. Skim well, then add the oysters. Let it get hot without boiling and serve immediately. Clam Broth. This broth is much used of late years for invalids. Indeed, in New York it seems to be as standard a sick- room dish as beef tea. It can often be retained on the stomach when other foods disagree with the patient, and is a valuable substitute for milk, when that proves unsat- isfactory. It is stimulating and nutritious. It can be administered by the spoonful, like beef tea, in cases of severe illness, or can be taken by the cupfnl, when, with a Graham cracker, it affords a hearty repast for others. For half a pint (a cupful) use six large hard-shelled clams. Wash them well with a brush, and place them in a kettle with two or three tablespoonfuls of water over the fire.

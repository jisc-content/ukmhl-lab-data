VEGETABLES. A Baked Potato. A Potato baked, when properly prepared, is proba- bly the most digestible form in which it can be served. The excellence of a baked potato depends much upon its being served immediately when cooked to a turn. A moment underdone and it is indigestible and worth- less ; a moment overdone and it has begun to dry. It requires abont an hour to bake a large potato in a hot oven. When served and mashed, the addition of some cream and a little salt is most excellent. To Boil Potatoes. Choose those of equal size. Take off a very thin peeling, as the best of the potato lies nearest the skin. Put them into enough well-salted cold water to cover them; let them boil till thoroughly done, and do not let them remain a moment longer. Drain oil the water, cover them closely, and set the vessel at the side of the fire, to allow them to steam for several minutes. A point is made in keeping the potatoes covered while steaming, for the pnrpose of retaining heat enough to draw out the moistnre. The escaping moisture, though covered, will not return to the potatoes. Sprinkle over some salt as soon as they are fully steamed. It requires about thirty-five minutes to boil medium-sized potatoes. A copper saucepan, or an iron pot retaining an even heat, should be iised for boiling potatoesâ€”never a tin saucepan,

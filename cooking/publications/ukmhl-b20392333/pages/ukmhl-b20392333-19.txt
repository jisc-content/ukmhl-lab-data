Authorities differ regarding the effects of tea upon the system. Liebig claims that theine and caffeLiie, in some way not satisfactorily explained, prevent or suspend the waste of tissue. As nitrogenous foods are necessary to supply or reinforce the tissues, he thinks that whatever prevents the waste of tissue takes the place of such foods, and, pro tanto, dispenses with the necessity of their use. This theory is now substantially exploded. More thorough investigation, supplemented by careful experiments, has demonstrated almost beyond question that the waste of tissue is not, in fact, prevented by tea or coffee. The essential principles of both are stimu- lating in their effects. They increase the action of the heart and the arteries, and furnish, like alcohol, a tran- sient increase of vital energy. These stimulating effects have, by Liebig and some others, been accepted as the prolongation or maintenance of healthful strength and vital force. These effects are deceptive. The advan- tages are as unreal as those sometimes supposed to spring from the use of alcoholic liquors. In truth, if alcohol were taken in small enough quantities to produce an

Appendix. 215 obviously true that an apology might almost seem necessary for stating so self-evident a proposition; but experience shows that this simple truth is one which, in practice, is constantly lost sight of. That that child thrives best who is most largely fed, and that the more solid the food the greater its nutritive power, are two articles of faith so firmly settled in the minds of many persons that it is very dilEcult indeed to persuade them to the contrary. To them wasting in an infant merely suggests a larger supply of more solid food; every cry means hunger, and must be quieted by an additional meal. To take a common case: A child, weakly, perhaps, to begin with, is filled with a quantity of solid food which he has no power of digesting. His stomach and bowels revolt against the burden imposed upon them, and endeavor to get rid of the offending matter by vomiting and diarrhoea; a gastro-intestinal catarrh is set up, which still further reduces the strength; every meal causes a return of the sickness; the bowels are filled with fermenting matter, which excites violent griping pains, so that the child rests neither night nor day; after a longer or shorter time he sinks, worn out by pain or exhaustion, and is then said to have died from 'consumption of the bowels.' " Cases such as the above are but too common, and must be painfully familiar to every physician who has much experience of the diseases of children. "The food we select for the diet of an infant should be nutritious in itself, but it should also be given in a form in which the child is capable of digesting it; otherwise we may fill him with food without in any way contributing to his nu- trition, and actually starve the body while we load the stomach to repletion. No food can be considered suitable to the re- quirements of the infant unless it not only possess heat-giving and fat-producing properties, but also contains material to sup- ply the waste of the nitrogenous tissues; therefore a merely starchy substance, such as arrowroot, which enters so largely into the diet of children, especially among the poor, is a very undesirable food for infants, unless given in very small quanti- ties and mixed largely with milk.

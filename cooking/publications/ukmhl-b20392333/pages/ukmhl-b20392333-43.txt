25 Sea-moss Farine and Sea Moss. the objections to tin, cannot be found. Here is an op- portunity for some inventor. Sea-Moss Faeine aot) Sea Moss. An article was sold several years ago, at all the gro- cers, called sea-moss farine. It was a most excellent preparation, especially valuable for invalids, and could be made into various blanc-manges and puddings, ac- cording to directions accompanying the packages. I have tried in vain to obtain it within the last two or three years, and it seems to be out of market. I hope very much to see it in market again, as it is an especial- ly valuable health-food. Sea moss is very nutritious, exceedingly digestible and wholesome, and can be used to advantage for al- most any invalid. Its flavor takes one to the sea-shore, it matters not how far away. The blanc-manges made from the Irish and Iceland mosses are especially good. 2

112 Panada. more than enough for a patient at one time, as it is very palatable when freshly made, and quite insipid if served cold. Toasted bread cut into thin, even slices may be served in the same way. This is also a good baby-diet for a child over seven or eight months old. A panada gruel may be made by adding to a cupful of boiling water, in a saucepan, a half-cupful of stale bread crumbs (without the crust) and a pinch of salt. Let it simmer five or ten minutes, or until it is, when stirred, of the consistency of gruel. It can be sweet- ened or not. A tablespoonful of split raisins, boiled with the gruel, makes a pleasant flavor. Sprinkle su- gar over the top when served. The raisins should not be eaten. If panada is made of the new-process flour, it is as nourishing as any of the gruels.

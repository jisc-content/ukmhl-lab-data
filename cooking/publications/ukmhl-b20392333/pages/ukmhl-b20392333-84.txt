G6 Fevers. Typhoid Fever. This being a long and exhausting disease, the chief treatment consists in good nursing and careful diet. In this disease the lining membrane of the intestines be- comes ulcerated. This complicates the question of diet, as nothing should be given which will leave a solid residue in the bowels, for fear of irritating the ulcers and causing them to perforate through the intestines. This cuts off fresh milk, the curd of which forms more or less solid masses. Koumiss which is partly digested is to be preferred to milk, also peptonized milk gruel (see pp. 42, 213, 228). Beef tea is also beneficially given. The experience of Sir Wm. Jenner is so extended in the treatment of typhoid fevers that I add his remarks on " Diet in Typhoid Fever" in the Appendix (page 223). There is rapid waste in this fever, and the patient must be fed regularly with very nutritious food. Kou- miss, beef tea, the gruels, eggnog, etc., are the chief ar- ticles of diet. If the patient becomes unable to swal- low, nutrient enemeta must be resorted to. Kubbing the body with oil is of great value.

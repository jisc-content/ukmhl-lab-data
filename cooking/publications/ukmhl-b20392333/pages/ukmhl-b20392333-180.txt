Cream Soups. 162 scant two quarts of clear stock, made witli either veal or beef. When the potatoes are thoronglily cooked, pass them, with the stock, througli a wire sieve ; then add the beaten yolks of two eggs and half a cupful of good, thick cream; season carefully with salt and cayenne pepper. Stir it for a minute over the fire, to slightly cook the eggs, without allowing it to boil; then keep it at the side of the range (better kept in a double kettle or lain marie) until about ready to serve. At the same time that the soup is being made pre- pare some vegetables for a garnish, as follows: Cut a me- dium-sized turnip (two ounces) into little dice this wayâ€” cut the turnip into slices about a quarter of an inch thick, without allowing the knife to cut quite through, BO the slices will hold together; then slice them trans- versely in the same manner. Now, holding the turnip firmly together, cut off the ends into little dice about a quarter of an inch square. In the same manner cut a carrot (two ounces) into little dice; provide, also, a ta- blespoonful or more of pease and some string-beans cut into quarter-inch lengths. All these vegetables may be used, or part of them, as convenient; the carrots and pease, however, are desira- ble for their fine color and flavor. Boil the vegetables separately, in little cups of salted boiling water; drain, and place them in the soup tureen. Wlien about ready to serve, place the soup over the fire without allowing it to boil, and whip it vigorously with the egg whisk for one or two minutes; then add the vegetables, and serve immediately. Or, the soup can be made without stock, boiling the potatoes in water, and adding more cream and a piece of butter size of a small egg.

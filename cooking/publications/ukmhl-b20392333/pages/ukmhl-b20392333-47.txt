29 Prepared Articles of Food. The best prepcaration I have seen for making barley ornel (one of the most valuable of gruels) is Kobinson's barley flour. It is manufactured in England, but is very generally sold here by the druggists. It is exceed- ingly palatable and valuable for invalids. Peaeled Oats.—Good for making porridge; also the Granulated Oats, admirable for puddings, gruels, etc., and the Oat Flouk, especially good for gruels.^ These are all articles which can be used beneficially in many difierent ways. " Cereal Coffee"—made of barley and wheat glu- ten parched. It is a good substitute for tea and coffee. It has some of the coffee flavor and is without more stimulant than is imparted by any nourishing drink. . Among other of tlie health-food preparations are crackers''made of the cold-blast flour, gluten, oats, g-ranulated wheat, etc. The manufacturers of what is known as the new patent-process flour claim that it also contains the full gluten of the grain. The flour is necessarily of a creamy color, gluten being light brown in appearance. This flour can be obtained of grocers in all of the large cities. If the flour sold for the "new-process" flour is purely white, it is not genuine. If the necessary amount of gluten is retained it must color it to some extent, indeed, to the extent of giving it a decidedly creamy hue. There are agencies in the large cities for cereal foods (oatmeal, barley, groats, hominy, cornmeal, etc.) pre- pared at Akron, Ohio, which are most excellent. The Graham flour from this source is especially fine.

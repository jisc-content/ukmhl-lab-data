Pour this out, add another half teaspoonful of soda, fill the bottle with water, and let it remain until it is wanted for use, when it should be rinsed with fresh water. The Champagne Tap. â€” It must be repeated that the kou- miss bottle should never be opened except by a champagne tap. The best one for the pur- pose that I have found is rep- resented in cut. There is another kind of tap with a wire enclosed in a tube, which wire has to be withdrawn after it is in the cork, before the screw is turned. The developments are disastrous while the wire is being drawn out, before the very important sci-ew can be turned. After the tap is in the bottle, keep the neck of the bottle alwaj's down to prevent the escape of gas. Keep the bottle also in a cool, dark place. It has occurred to me that the making of koumiss might often afford profitable em- ployment for women. After perfecting themselves in its manufacture, they might send notices and samples to neighboring physicians and then sell it through the agency of druggists or grocers; tlie latter having generally better means for the transportation and delivery of articles. The difficulty in procuring quite fresh milk in the large cities might preclude its best manufacture there. CHAMPAGNE TAP.

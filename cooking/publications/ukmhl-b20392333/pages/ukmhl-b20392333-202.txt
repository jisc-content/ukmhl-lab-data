JELLIES. "Wine Jelly. Ingkedients : One box of gelatine, soaked in one pint of clear, cold water, one pint of wine, the juice and the thin cuts of the rinds of three lemons, one and a quarter pounds of sugar (or according to taste), one quart of clear boiling water, the whites of two eggs (well beat- en) and the shells, and a small stick of cinnamon. Soak the gelatine in the pint of cold water an hour, then pour over it the quart of boiling water, stirring it well; now add the wine, sugar, lemon juice (strained in a fine strainer), and the thinnest possible cuts from the peels of the lemons. These cuts take only the little globules of oil in the peel, which are exceedingly deli- cate in flavor, the white being bitter. Add, also, the small stick of cinnamon, as it adds much to the flavor of the jelly. Put this into a porcelain kettle; let it boil rapidly about a quarter of a minute without stirring it; now, setting the kettle on the hearth, let it remain another half-minute to settle; then skim off carefully the scum which is on the top, and pour it through the jelly-bag. It should be entirely clear; if, however, the first should not be so, return it to the bag. Cold water should be poured into the moulds, then emptied just be- fore using. Jelly hardens much quicker on ice, or in the coolest place to be found. Dip the moulds into warm water a moment before taking out the jelly. If al- lowed to remain a moment too long the jelly might dis- solve too much and injure the form.

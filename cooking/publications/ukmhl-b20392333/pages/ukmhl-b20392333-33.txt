15 Animal Foods. The table inserted below, giving the relative nutritive and other values of the live animal foods principally used, is taken from Dr.Bellow's "Philosophy of Eating.

An analysis of the two kinds of food shows a similar composition. The muscle-making ele- ments in beef, the fibrine and albumen, correspond with the muscle-making elements in wheat—gluten and albu- men ; and they so agree in chemical composition as to be considered mere modifications of the same substance, and, being dried, contain principally the same elements in the same proportions. Thus the popular idea that grain food is not so strong and nourishing as animal food is erroneous. The meat of animals is nitrogenous and therefore muscle-building. So are the grains nitrogenous and muscle-building. Dr. Eadcliffe, in an interesting article in the Popular Science Monthly, says: " It is impossible to distinguish between the albuminose or peptone into which fibrine is resolved in the process of digestion and the albuminose or pep- tone into which albumen or caseine or gluten or legu- mine is resolved in this process. It is apparently of little or no moment whether these various uitrogenous arti-

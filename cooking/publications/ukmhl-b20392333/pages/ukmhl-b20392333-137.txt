Pulled Bread. Break off irregular pieces of fresh bread about the size of an egg, and bake them in a slow oven until quite dry and slightly colored. Pieces of stale bread or cold biscuits split in two can be made as good as new by dipping them quickly in cold water and baking them in a hot oven until the surface is crisp and the interior is well heated through. Zwieback. The German zwieback, which can be obtained of the bakers, is an excellent breakfast bread, to serve with a hot beverage. It is composed merely of slices of rusk dried in a very slow oven to a delicate orange color. Vienna bread slices are prepared in the same way. The zwieback is subjected for a long time to a slow, even heat, which can be best obtained in a brick-oven.

Serve with sweet- ened cream or a little soft-boiled custard, and a couple of preserved strawberries for a garnish. Chaelotte-eusse. The charlotte-rnsse made after this receipt is un- doubtedly one of the very best ever made. Bring a cupful, or half a pint, of milk almost to the boiling-point, and then stir in the yolks of four eggs, previously well beaten, with three tablespoonfuls of sugar. Stir this carefully over the fire (in a double kettle) making a boiled custard. Care must be taken that it does not curdle, or become too thick. Take it from the fire and add to it a quarter of a boxful of gelatine, previously soaked with enough milk to cover it in a cup, and dissolved, by setting it at the side of the fire. Add also, when the custard is a little cooled, two or three tablespoonfuls, of best sherry wine for a flavoring. Set this custard on ice, or in a cold place, until partly congealed, and then stir into it, evenly and carefully, a quart of cream whipped to a stiff froth. This can be poured into either a charlotte pan, or little paper cases (page 153), lined with lady-fingers, or into a pretty glass dish with a row of lady-fingers around the sides, and then it is served in the same dish. If sponge cake is objectionable for the invalid, the creamy custard, which is simple and wholesome enough for almost any one, can be served alone, in the paper cases.

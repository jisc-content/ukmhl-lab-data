Put into the saucepan two ounces of butter (size of an egg), and when it bub- bles sprinkle in one ounce (a tablespoonful) of sifted flour; let it cook a minute without taking color, stirring it well with a wire egg whisk, then add, mixing well, a cupful of the oyster liquor. Take it from the fire and mix in the yolks of two eggs, a little salt, a very little cayenne pepper, one teaspoonful of lemon juice, and one or two gratings of nutmeg.

Place a pint of oysters (the measure nearly solid with oysters) over the fire, with a quantity of their cold liquor; when they begin to simmer, drain them quite dry from their liquor (through the colander), and cut them into large dice.

Next, place butter size of a black walnut in a little saucepan, and, when it bubbles, throw in a dessert- spoonful of onion, minced fine; let it fry a couple of minutes without taking color; then add a tablespoonful (quarter of a cupful) of flour; let it also cook a few mo- ments without taking color; then pour in half a cupful of cream or milk, and half a cupful of the oyster liquor; season with salt, cayenne pepper (very carefully), and a few dashes of nutmeg. When it is evenly mixed and the flour is thoroughly cooked (a couple of minutes), take it from the fire, stir in the oysters, and set it away to get cold. Mould them, roll in egg (slightly seasoned with pepper and salt) and sifted cracker crumbs, and fry them by immersion into boiling lard.

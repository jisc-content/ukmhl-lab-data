90 EeceijpU for the Sich and Convalescent. About a teaspoonful to a tablespoonful of lime- water to a half-pint of milk is usually prescribed. Baeley-water. Add to a pint of boiling water half a tablespoonful (half an onnce) of Eobinson's patent barley, or the "health-food" barley, rubbed smooth, with two table- spoonfuls of cold water; add also a pinch of salt and a tablespoonful of sugar. Let it boil five minutes. It is to be drunk cold. The simple barley-water has a not unpleasant taste, and is often prepared without addi- tional flavor. Yet zest—-i. e., the thin yellow cuts of the rind of a lemon, or lump sugar rubbed over to ex- tract the oil—can be added as a flavoring, or a lemonade may be made of barley-water. Barley-water may be used temporarily instead of milk when the latter disagrees. Oatmeal Drink.

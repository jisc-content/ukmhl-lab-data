RECEIPTS FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT. DRINKS. Distilled Water (Dr. Beard). " Foe diseases of kidneys, etc., this, the purest of water, may be obtained by fixing a curved tin tube three or four feet long to tlie spout of a tea-kettle, and conducting its free end into a jar which should be placed in a basin of cold water. The liquid, as it drops, must be kept cool by frequently changing the water in which the jar is placed. The steam thus condensed is pure water. Distilled water is mawkish to taste, but this is easily corrected by pouring it from one vessel to another successively for ten or fifteen minutes, so as to involve in it a quantity of atmospheric air." LiME-WATEK. Pour over a piece of fresh unslacked lime, about an inch square, two quarts of hot water. When it has slacked (in a few minutes) stir it thoroughly. Let it remain over-night. Bottle carefully all the liquid that can be poured off in a perfectly clear state. As water will only hold a certain amount of lime in solution, the addition of more lime would make the water of no greater strength. Lime-water (an alkali) is generally added to milk for the purpose of neutralizing the effects of an acid stomach.

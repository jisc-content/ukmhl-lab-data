GRUELS. I WISH to call special attention to the barley gruel made of Eobiuson's patent barley flour (page 29), as explained in the following receipt. The gruel is deli- cate and delicious in flavor and is most invaluable for nearly all conditions of sickness. I have tried the same receipt with several American preparations of barley which were good, but not to be compared with the one first mentioned. It would be well for our own manu- facturers not to be outdone in supplying an article so generally useful. Baeley Geuel. Wet gradually (stirring it smooth) half an ounce, or one tablespoonful, of Robinson's patent barley flour, with half a gill of cold water; stir well into it one gill of boiling water; add a small pinch of salt. Let it cook over the fire for five minutes, stirring it slowly part of the time, then add half a gill of hot milk. Let it again come just to a boil, then take it off the fire, stir in a teaspoonf ul of sugar, and it is ready to serve. Gruels are always better when served quite fresh-made and hot.

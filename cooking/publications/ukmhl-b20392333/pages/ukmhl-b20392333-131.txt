BREADS AND OTHER GRAIN PREPARATIONS. Beead. It is very important to have wholesome, sweet, and well-made bread, especially for an invalid. The new- process flours (see page 29) are indispensable for mak- ing the most nutritions white bread. As for yeast, the Fleischman's yeast insures always sweet bread. Receipts come with these yeast cakes. The breM'ers' yeast is most excellent. A gill of this yeast to three and a half pounds of flour is the proper proportion. In the country the home-made yeast is generally used. Yet this is unreliable unless made by an expert. I will give one receipt for bread which can be made of a dry yeast, that can be obtained in the country. It is made of the "National Yeast," manufactured at Seneca Falls, N. Y. " On the Raquette," where moist yeast never has ventured, and we hope never will, we bad the very best and most wholesome of bread made of this yeast. The yeast packages are dated, so that only those quite fresh need be purchased. If baking-powder is used for any of the small bread receipts, the Horsford's baking-powder is considered quite reliable and hygienic.

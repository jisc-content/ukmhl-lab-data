There are probably some good results from drinking tea and coffee, viz.: the water used is purified by boil- ing, the liquid is generally taken in a warm state, and the warmth of the water tends to aid digestion.

It is now generally conceded that the effect of the active principle in tea and coffee is more or less injuri- ous to the nervous system, and the tannin contained in them acts as a constant irritant to the stomach, present- ing a formidable obstacle to digestion. Slavery of body and mind to any unnatural stimulant is unfortunate, whether that stimulant be tea or coffee, alcoholic drinks or opiumâ€”all more or less beneficial as remedial agents and injurious as constant beverages.

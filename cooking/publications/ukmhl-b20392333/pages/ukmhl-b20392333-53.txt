The corks must have been previously soaked for two or three hours, immersed in hot water over a warm stove, when they become soft; they are then pushed through the corking-machine (see cut) with a hammer, or, better, a wooden mallet; quite heavy and vigorous blows of the mallet on the liandle of the machine will not break the bottle, as one might suppose. The corks are then tied. When this operation is all completed, put tlie bottles in a standing position in an even (or as nearly so as possible) temperature of 52° Fahr.,* where they should remain for two and a half days. Some closed closet or cellar in winter or a refrigerator in summer will generally afford this temperature. This slow fermenta- tion is desirable. At the end of the two days to two days and a half, .place the bottles on their sides and on the stone-floor of the darkest and coolest place in the cellar—or, in default of such place, in a refrigera- tor. Many consider koumiss at its best when it is five or six days old, but it can be kept indefinitely if kept in a temperature not above 52 kept without freezing the bettei CORK MACHINE. The colder it is The brewers' lager- beer yeast is decidedly the best for making what I call the sweet koumiss, imparting to it a beer flavor. As the * My first instructions were to leave the koumiss at this stage in ii tem- perature of 62° for the two and a half days, but I have found, by experi- menting, that a temperature as low as 52° produces even better results.

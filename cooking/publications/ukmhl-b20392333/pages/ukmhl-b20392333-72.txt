Diet in Different Diseases. Oatmeal Getjel.—(Dr. Kice of Colorado.) Oatmeal is a very hearty food, too much so to be com- mended as a common diet for infants. For a change, though, it often suits most admirably. Add one teacnpful of oatmeal to two quarts of boil- ing water very slightly salted; let tliis cook for two hours and a half, then strain it through a sieve. When cold, add to one gill of the gruel one gill of thin cream and one teaspoonful of sugar. To this quantity add one pint of boiling water, and it is ready for use. Beef.—(Dr. Rice.) Scrape one half pound of beef, and remove all the shreds; add one half pint of water, and three drops of muriatic acid. Let it stand one hour; tlien strain it through a sieve, and add a very small portion of salt. Mellin's Food foe Infants. Mellin's food for infants, which is said to be merely the Liebig receipt carried out perfectly, is probably as good food for infants as can be purchased. It is an English preparation, but can be found for sale every- where, as the food is well known and much used.

Make the caramel by putting two tablespoonfuls of brown sugar and a teaspoonful of water over the fire and stirring it until it gets a quite dark brown—not black; then add a dessertspoonful of water. It will make a thick syrup. Pour this into the bottom of two cups or little fancy moulds, and turn it around until it covers the bottom and sides. For the custard, beat well three eggs (yolks and whites), with a teaspoonful of white sugar and the very thin yellow cuts of a lemon; then stir in a cupful of milk or thin cream which has been brought to the scald- ing-point (not boiling) over the fire. Fill the cups or moulds (previously lined with the caramel) with the custard; place them in a basin of hot water, the water reaching nearly to the top of the moulds, and bake them in the oven until the custard is set, or feels firm to the finger—no longer. Tliey will set in twelve or fifteen minutes. The custards may be served either hot or cold—although they are generally served cold—turned from the mould when just ready to be served.

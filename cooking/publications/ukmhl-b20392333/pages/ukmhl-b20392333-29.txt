MilJc. 11 foods —for instance, with rice, porridge, bread, etc.; or it can be boiled and tliicliened witli a little barley flour, etc. The reason is explained by Dr. Eustace Smith, page 216. It is preferable to give milk to diabetics in the form of koumiss, -which contains no sugar. In typhoid fever it should be either administered peptonized or in the form of fresh koumiss. This pre- vents the formation of curd, which is irritating to the bowels in that disease. Milk in its acid state and buttermilk are nourishing and beneficial in febrile conditions. Cows' milk is not always of uniform quality. That of the Alderney cow yields the largest proportion of butter. The feeding, too, influences the quality of milk ; for instance, with dry food, the milk is relatively richer in solids, and with good grass it abounds in fat. Water constitutes nine tenths of milk; the remainder consists of albuminoid or the muscle-building principle, caseine (the curd which is used in making cheese), the carbonates or heat-producing principle (the butter and sugar). Then there is some mineral matter—the phos- phates. The sugar is called lactine, and by fermenta- tion or souring it is converted into lactic acid. When the "milk cure" is resorted to, the patient should gradually leave off his ordinary mixed diet until he reaches an exclusively milk diet. Mitchell formulates his method of administering a milk diet as follows: " My own rule, founded on considerable experience, is this: Dating from the time when the patient begins to take milk alone, I wish three weeks to elapse before anything be used save milk. After the first week of the period I direct that the milk be taken in just as large amount as the person desires, but not allowing it

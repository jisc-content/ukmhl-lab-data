The caseine of milk turns into curd in the stomach, and leaves a solid residue. It is estimated that each quart of kou- miss contains four ounces of solid food. After such a richesse of authority (and there is much more before me) it would seem unnecessary to mention that I have become enthusiastic as to the merits of koumiss, after having seen its almost miraculous effects upon a member of our own family.

52 I>iet in Different Diseases. Liebig's Receipt. Take half an ounce of wheat flour, half an ounce of malt flour, and seven and a quarter grains of crystallized bicarbonate of potash, and, after mixing them well, add one ounce of water, then five ounces of cow's milk. Warm the mixture, continually stirring, over a very slow fire, till it becomes thick. Then remove the ves- sel from the fire, stir again for five minutes, put it back on the fire, finally let it boil well. It is necessary that the food should form a thin and sweet liquid previous to its final boiling. Before us- ing, it should be strained through a fine hair sieve. Pavy says, in regard to this receipt: " To avoid the trouble of weighing, as much wheat flour as will lie on a tablespoon is an ounce, and a moderate tablespoonful of malt flour corresponds with half an ounce." It is malt made from barley that should be used, and a common coflee-mill answers the purpose of grinding it into flour, which is to be cleaned from the husk by a coarse sieve. The bicarbonate of potash is added to neutralize the acid reaction of the two kinds of flour, and also to raise the amount of alkali in the food to the equivalent of that in woman's milk. The ferment in the malt leads, during the exposure to the warmth employed in the process of preparation, to the conversion of the starch of both the flours into dextrine and sugar, the latter of which gives the sweet taste that is required. The newly found products also being soluble, will account for the mixture being thin, and the point contended for by Liebig is, that the same principles in this state tax the digestive and assimi- lative powers of the infant much less than starch.

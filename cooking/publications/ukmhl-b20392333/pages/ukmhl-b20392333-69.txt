Diet for Infants. 51 be kept exclusively for the baby's use, and, before the milk is added, the pans, used alternately, should have been thoroughly cleansed, scalded, and dried. In sum- mer, the milk, if in danger of becoming sour, can be scalded when first put into the pan, but it must not be boiled. Glass jars are still better than tin pans for keeping milk.-^ Always use a fresh, clean bottle every time milk is given to the baby. Several bottles should be provided, also the black thimble rubber nipples; the white are said to contain injurious ingredients. Never use the long rubber tube for the nursing-bottle, as it is almost impossible to keep it clean and free from acid. Dr. Gatchel says: " As soon as the child has taken enough for one feeding, empty from the bottle what remains, and, without delay, scald and wash the bottle with hot water and soap. After scalding, put the bot- tle into a basin of clean, cold water in which a little soda has been dissolved. Let it remain in the soda bath for half an hour, then rinse it in clean water and let it dry by hanging inverted on a peg." A wire basket would be better and more convenient than the peg. "While the baby is under a month old, the usual quan- tity for a meal should be the ordinary feeding-bottle half full. Afterwards the bottle nearly full. In its chemical properties, goats' milk approaches nearer than any other kind to human milk. "Very little water should be added to it—about four per cent, to make it suitable for infants. Probably the most perfect artificial substitute for hu- man milk is Liebig's food for infants, prepared accord- ing to strict chemical principles. It is composed of malt flour, wheat flour, cow's milk, bicarbonate of potash, and water in such proportions as to imitate woman's milk as nearly as possible. ♦ In regard to glass jars for keeping milk, see page 12.

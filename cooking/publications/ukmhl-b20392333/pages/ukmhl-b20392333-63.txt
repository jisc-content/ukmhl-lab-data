45 Canning of Grape Juice. be its color and the better the natural flavor of the grape will be retained. This, like all other articles to be canned, must be at the boiling-point when it is sealed. If the juice is to be used at once it should not be brought to the boiling-point a second time. Use wooden spoons in its preparation, and only glass jars for keeping it. The action of any acid substance on tin is to corrode it and poison the fruit. Before heating the grapes see that all the necessary preparations are complete, viz., that the jars and covers are clean, the covers fitted, and the hot water ready for holding the jars, etc. To avoid breaking the jars, manage them as follows: When the grape juice is nearly ready for canning, fill a large wooden tub about three quarters full with water quite hot, but below the boiling-point. Holding the jar sidewise, roll it over quickly in the water, and then sot it right side up with the water in and around it. Continue in the same manner with other jars. Place the covers also in hot water. The juice being ready to be canned, roll one of the jars again quickly in the hot water, empty it, place it on a tin platter, and pour it full of the boiling juice, rather slowly at first. Wipe the moisture from the top of the can, adjust the rubber ring, and screw on the top (taken from the hot water and wiped dry) until it clasps the rubber tightly all around. Do it all as quickly as possible. Set this jar aside and proceed in the same way with the others. After the jars are cool enough to handle, screw down the tops again, and when entirely cold give them another twist in order that the sealing may be perfect. The best plan is to let them stand twenty-four hours and tighten them from time to time. Last of all, wipe them clean with a damp cloth, and set them away in a dark, cool

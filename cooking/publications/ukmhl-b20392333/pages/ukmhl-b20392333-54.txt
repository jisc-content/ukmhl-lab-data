Koumiss. 36 koumiss is drawn it should appear in the glass like thick whipped cream. The koumiss will become acid by long standing, or by placing it in a higher temperature. Yery good koumiss can also be made with Fleisch- man's Compressed Yeast. A fifth of a two-cent cake of this yeast to a quart of milk is the proper proportion. It should be well-dissolved before it is added to the milk. The proportion of sugar or syrup is the same as when the other yeast is used. If the milk is quite fresh and sweet, and the bottles are perfectly clean and free from acid, there is little dan- ger of the koumiss curdling. If it should become cur- dled, it can be used for cooking purposes. It makes the best of biscuits, pancakes, or anything which can be made with sour milk. Most of the medical works advise the use of old kou- miss instead of yeast to produce fermentation. This I would not recommend. After the koumiss is made one or two days, a thick curd (the caseine) will gen- erally be found at the top. It is also recommended to turn the bottles two or three times (not shake them, for fear of explosion) so as to mix this curd with the liquid below. I was quite particular about this at first, but, becoming more negligent, found that the koumiss was qnite as good without this care. When the bottles are turned to the side (after the two and a half days), the caseine is loosened from the top, and when the koumiss is drawn, the effervescing gas accomplishes the mixing. To Tie the Bottles.â€”With a strong hemp twine make a loop as in Fig. 1, page 37. In Fig. 2, the twine at a is drawn up, and in Fig. 3 it is placed over the top of the cork. The two ends, 5, b, are drawn as firmly as possible under the rim of the bottle, c, as in Fig. 3.

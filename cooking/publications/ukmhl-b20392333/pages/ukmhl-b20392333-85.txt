GOUT AND RHEUMATISM. An excess of uric acid in the system, and the conse- quent tendency to deposit urate of soda in the fibroiTS tissue around the joints, is the cause of gout. This con- dition is superinduced by the use of too much highly seasoned animal food and by indulgence in stimulants, without taking sufficient physical exercise. In other words, more food is taken than can be properly digested and assimilated. Laborers, taking a less proportion of animal food, and more out-door exercise, are rarely ever troubled with gout. Gouty patients and the children of gouty parents should promptly adopt habits of strict ab- stemiousness. The diet should be chiefly vegetable, and physical exercise in the open air is indispensable. The regimen recommended for dyspepsia will answer very well for gout and rheumatism—rheumatism, hke gout, being often consequent upon dietetic abuses. Meat should be strictly avoided in all cases of gout. It will only aggravate the trouble, and the same may be said of alcoholic drinks, malt liquors, and especially port wine. Probably the surest cure for both gout and rheuma- tism is to be found in a complete change of the ordi- nary dietary in favor of a purely milk diet—or a diet composed of milk and the grain preparations, viz.: oatmeal porridge, cracked wheat, Graham bread, etc. Skimmed milk is generally prescribed, but the patient must be ill indeed if not able to digest fresh, new milk.

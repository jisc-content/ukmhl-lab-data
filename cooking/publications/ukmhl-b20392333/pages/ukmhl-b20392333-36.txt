The nitrates in oysters are in the form of al- bumen, like the white of an egg; they are, therefore, more easily digested in a raw state than when cooked, but when stewed are not indigestible." Fat.

Without knowing why, fat has generally been considered unwholesome, tending to produce biliousness, corpulence, and heat, besides being a general clog and burden in all digestive pro- cesses. Oil has been avoided; butter on bread has been scraped down to the smallest quantity, and the fat of meat has been sedulously trimmed. Fat is as necessary to the system as the muscle-mak- ing properties of foods. It not only serves to produce heat, but has an essential share in the tissue-making process. It does not produce the material, but influ- ences the assimilation of the other principles of food by well-established processes. Although it is essential to the formation of every structure in the body, it is an especially essential constituent of the brain and ner- vous system.

It is af- firmed that if one takes and assimilates a sufficient quantity of fat in the ordinary diet, one is not liable to have consumption or nervous diseases. In foods supplying all the necessary elements for sustaining life, fat constitutes a considerable proportion

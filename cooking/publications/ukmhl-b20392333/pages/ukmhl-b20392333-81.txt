The incessant thirst from which the patient suffers it is hard to gratify, for water taken into the stomach aggravates the vomiting; and yet the patient should receive all the water that he craves, he can retain it. If this is impossible, much benefit may be derived from holding small pieces of ice in tlie mouth until they melt away. Injections of warm milk may be used with advantage, if nothing can be taken by the stomach. " After the attack no solid food should be taken until the stools are consistent and fffical. Great care must be observed during convalescence. An attack of indi- gestion at this time is often followed by a fatal relapse. At first only farinaceous food should be given, and this in small quantities, frequently repeated. " Kice thoroughly cooked, thickened milk, and the like may first be taken. Milk, however, is to be pre- ferred to this, and, if the patient can take it, nothing else need be sought for."

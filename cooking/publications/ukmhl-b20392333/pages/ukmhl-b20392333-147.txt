Oatmeal Porridge.â€”Gornmeal Mtmh. stirred with the other. When all mixed it should boil slowly, uncovered or partly uncovered, without after- wards being stirred more than is necessary to keep it from adhering to the bottom, and to mingle the grams two or three times that they may all be evenly cooked. If much stirred the por- ridge will be starchy or waxy and poor in fla- vor. The puffing of tlie steam through the grains without much stirring swells each one separately, and when done the porridge is light and palatable. Professional cooks insist upon hav- in^g copper saucepans for cooking the grains, for the good reason that there is but little danger of burning in them. A common earthen crock placed on top the range answers the purpose very well. Care must be taken that a cold crock should not suddenly be placed on a very hot surface. Pour hot water in the crock before placing it on the range, and there will be little danger of breaking. This manner of cooking is ap- plicable to all the grains. CORNMEAL MuSH. This may be made by stirring, say, a pint of corn- meal into three pints of salted boiling water, and cook- ing it a good half-hour. Or, stir a pint of cornmeal, mixed with a pint of milk and a teaspoonful of salt, into a quart of boiling water, and let it boil half an hour, stirring often. 6*

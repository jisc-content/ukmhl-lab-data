Iced Water and Iced Tea. 1 An acquaintance of the writer, in Missouri, who was blessed with a most perfect physique, drank an unusual quantity of iced water one hot summer's day, and died three days afterwards from paralysis of the stomach. Dio Lewis, in his work on " Our Digestion," writes as follows: " Dr. Beaumont makes an interesting statement illus- trating the influence of cold drinks upon the digestion. He placed his thermometer in St. Martin's stomach,* and found the temperature 99°. A gill of water at the temperature of 55° was introduced. As soon as it was diffused over the interior surface, tlie temperature was reduced to 70°, at which it stood a few minutes, and then began very slowly to rise. It was not until thirty minutes had elapsed, and all the water had been for some time absorbed, that the mercury regained its for- mer level of 99°. " When we reflect that in this case there was but a single gill of water and the temperature was 55°, which hardly deserves the name of cold, we shall not hesitate in pronouncing upon the habit of drinking the usual quantities of iced water with our meals, or that of con- suming, at the end of a full meal, a dish of ice-cream. When we remember that a temperature of 99° is abso- lutely required to carry forward the process of digestion, can we doubt, if a gill of water at the temperature of 55° produced such an effect upon St. Martin, a person of rarest vi^or of health, what would be the influence of a. * The author would explain, in reference to this apparently rash remark, that Alexis St. Martin was wounded in such a manner by a gunshot thaS the stomach was exposed; the edges of the wound cicatriised, leaving a permanent fistulous opening leading into the cavity of the stomach. Tiie orifice, usually closed, could be opened, and the process of digestion in- spected. Dr. Beaumont made a long series of experiments with St. Mar- tin, most valuable and interesting to the medical profession.

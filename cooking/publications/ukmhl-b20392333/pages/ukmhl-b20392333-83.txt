Barley, oatmeal, and Grabam-flour gruels are mucb used, especially during convalescence. It is well not to use stimulants unless tbe patient is alarmingly weak, wben an eggnog can be given if koumiss is not a sufficient stimulus. Peptonized milk and gruel are also recommended when fresh milk and gruel do not agree with the pa- tient. If milk disagrees, or is thrown up curdled, a tablespoonful of lime-water to a cupful of milk will generally correct the difficulty. The fruits are especially beneficial to fever patients. Dr. Oswald says: " Bananas hvq par excellence an anti- fever food, being refreshing, palatable, and nutritive, as well as exceedingly digestible." When the patient has no appetite for food, very little or none should be given. Dr. Oswald says: "When coolness, sweetness, and fruity flavors cannot make a dish acceptable to the appetite, its obtrusion would do more harm than good, and it is a great mistake to sup- pose that even total abstinence could, in such cases, ag- gravate the danger of the disease." In the critical stage of fevers, milk, koumiss, a light gruel, orange juice, and the cold drinks are all that need be given. After the crisis has passed, bananas, pears, baked apples, raw eggs (page 141), bread jelly, dipped toast (made of nutritive flour), or barley gruel could be added. All animal food or greasy dishes should be avoided until full recovery. If the patient's mouth is furred it may be washed out with cold water containing a little lemon juice, be- fore food is taken.

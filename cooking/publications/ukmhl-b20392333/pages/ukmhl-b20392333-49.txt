KO UMISS. This nutritions beverage, made of fermented milk, Las been hitherto comparatively unknown in our coun- try. It has been used for centuries in Tartary and in Asiatic Russia. It is there chiefly made of mares' milk (see Appendix). Mares' milk differs from cows' milk, the former possessing (according to Pavy) a smaller amount of nitroa^enous matter and butter, and a much larger amount of sugar. By adding sugar to cows milk a koumiss may be obtained superior in its nutri- tive properties to that made of mares' milk. Koumiss is of incalculable value for almost all inva- lids, containing the full nutriment of milk and the stimulating qualities of wines and liquors without any ill-effects. Dr. Dobell, of London, in his valuable work on " Diet and Regimen," says: "Koumiss, when properly pre- pared, is a higlily refreshing, effervescent preparation of milk obtained by a natural process of fermentation, in which the albumen and caseine are partly digested, while its abundance of free carbonic acid makes it sedative to the most irritable stomach, so that it has succeeded in numerous cases, recorded by medical practitioners, where stimulants, beef-tea, and rectal enemata, aided by the most varied pharmacopoeial treatment, had alike failed. "Its chief qualities are: " (a.) Its agreeable, refreshing, and liighly digestible character.

Fat. 19 -for instance, milk, eggs, etc. The yolk of the egg is about one third fat. . Dr. Eadcliffe says, " There is no essential diflerence as to the chemical composition between vegetable albu- men and fibrine, and leguniine and oily matters, and animal albumen and tibrine, and caseine and oily mat- ters; there is no perceptible diflerence in the albumi- nose or peptone into which the vegetable and animal nitrogenous substances are alike transformed in the pro- cess of digestion ; there is no difference in the way in which the vegetable and animal oily matters are emul- " si lied and then taken up directly into the general circu- lation of the blood." Another writer says: " If the inhabitants of the Arctic regions gorge themselves with animal fat, those of warm countries take the same thing in vegetable oils. In most warm climates olive-oil is taken, and in India ghee, with no inconvenience to digestion and with unmistakable benefit." An interesting article on the subject of fats, by Dr. Radcliffe, was pirblished in the Poimlar Science Monthly (March, 1883). It is in the form of a dialogue between a physician and a young man who had eaten a breakfast of lean meat and toast in anticipation of a hard day's rowing. The physician explains to the young man his mistake, and shows that, as force-producing agents, fat and oil are as necessary as fibrine or albumen. He also says : " I find that very many persons suffer- ing from various chronic disorders of the nervous sys- tem have abstained from the fatty and oily articles of food, and that their state is almost invariably very much changed for the better when induced to take what they have avoided." Because we have, perhaps, been mistaken in taking too little fat in the past, it is not recommended that too large a quantity be taken in the future.

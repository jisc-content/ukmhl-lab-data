40 Artificial Digestion. inaj be called intestinal digestion. It is here that the pancreatic ferment does its work. For information on this subject, viz., the practical use of pancreatic extract and its action on the human sys- tem treated philosophical!}', we are indebted to Dr. Will iam Roberts, of Manchester, England. This infor- mation was given in a series of lectures before the Eoyal College of Physicians, which have since been published in book form, entitled " On the Digestive Ferments." In our own country a preparation of the pancreas, called "Extractum Pancreatis," is made by Fairchild Brothers & Foster, New York City. Mr. Fairchild has published a small book on the subject, having given it a very thorough investigation. His extract is in powdered form, is easily kept, and quite perfect in its results. Dr. Horace Dobell has also contributed valuable in- formation on the same subject; having, in fact, pre- ceded Dr. Eoberts in his publications. His experi- ments have been chiefly directed to the action of the pancreas on fats.* An article, which can be obtained in most of our large cities (prepared by Savory & Moore, of London), called " Pancreatic Emulsion," i. e., pancreatized snet, cod-liver oil, etc., is the result of his investigations. This aliment is considered especially valuable for consumptives. (See Appendix, p. 212.) Dr. Dobell says: " Pancreatic emulsion has proved most magical in its effects on miserable, wasted children â€”children who have been subjected to chronic defects in diet; for instance, when the mother's milk is poor in fat and lactine, or when the child's diet has been de- * The albuminoids and starch have been digested with pepsin and vege- table diastase; no other digestive agent has been found to emulsify fat but pancreatine; the pancreas, however, is the only organ concerned in the digesliiin of fat.

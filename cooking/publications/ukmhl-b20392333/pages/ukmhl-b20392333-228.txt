To avoid repetition, I will simply cite one case given by Dr. Neftel relating to koumiss treatment. 'The patient, twenty-five years old, had always lived in St. Petersburg.

In this condition the patient, by my advice, left the city, passed the whole sum- mer in the steppe, in a Mbitka, and was methodically treated with koumiss. Her general condition gradually improved; she

114 Breads and other Grain Frejparations. Hathorn's Adirondack Bread. This bread can be made in one day, or the sponge may be made at night and finished in the morning. If made in one day the sponge must be given a warmer temperature, which will cause it to rise more quickly. To be quite explicit, when setting the sponge at night for four loaves of bread, place in a large bread-pan three heaping quarts of sifted flour and a teaspoonful of salt. Into this mix one and a quarter cakes of National Yeast (see preceding article) which has been previously soaked for a few minutes, softened and mixed in two quarts of lukewarm water, or water at about the temperature of 96° Fahr. Mix this all well together with a spoon, and it will make a sponge a little thicker than is necessary for pancake batter. Cover this with a clean cloth, several times folded, and set it to rise over-night, selecting a situation where as even a tem- perature as possible, of about 70° Fahr., can be obtained. In the morning, at about seven or eight o'clock, the sponge will be found to be in biibbles, not increased, however, more than a third of its original size. At this time add enough more flour to make it a dough solid enough to handle, though not too stiff. Knead it for about ten minutes, not more, as the grain of bread does not want to be too fine. Then cover it again in the pan and set it at the side of the fire (temp, about 90°) until it has increased about double or more in size. This will require about five hours. Now separate it into loaves, knead them separately two or three minutes, and place them in the baking-pans. Cover and set them to rise for the third time in the same warm place. This will require about an hour longer, when they are ready to bake in a rather quick oven. If it be desirable to make the bread m one day, tlie

Remarks about Foods. 20 Pavy says tlie supply ouglit not to be less, even with inactivity, than one ounce daily, and that about two and a half ounces will constitute the average amount in the dietaries recommended for working people. Fresh milk furnishes fat in proper proportions. Cream and butter furnish the most assimilable fat. Bread generously buttered (not too much so, however), meat with streaks of fat, and the oil dressing on salads will ordinarily afford a sufficient supply. Pork fat is the most objectionable of the fats to persons of seden- tary habits. Dobell says: " When it is necessary, for any special object,* to reduce the quantity of carbon taken in the aliments, this can more safely be done by diniinisliiiig the saccharine, amylaceous (sugar and starch) matters, than the fat." Eggs. Eggs contain all that is required for the building and maintenance of the body. They are, therefore, a most invaluable article of food. The white is almost pure albumen and water, and the yolk contains the fat and other necessary constituents. They are'more easily digested when taken raw or slightly cooked, as described for poached eggs (cooked in water below the boiling- point). Continued boiling, or cooking in any manner, toughens the albumen and renders it difficult of diges- tion. Indeed, a valuable cement is made by thickening the white of egg with powdered quicklime, and heating it. The whole egg can be made hard and tough enough by heating to become a cement of itself. Pice. Pice is very rich in starch, and poor in fat and al- buminous matter. It contains less than half the muscle- * lAir instance, to reduce corpulency.â€”Eu.

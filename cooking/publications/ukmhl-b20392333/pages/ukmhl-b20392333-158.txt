Little Dishes. 140 tough if overcooked—indeed, it forms a cement wlien heated above a certain point. The white of the egg, to be properly poached, should be white, but of a soft, transparent, jelly-like substance. It should be tender and delicate, evenly cooked through- out, no part being bard while anotlier is semi-raw. To prepare it in this manner the water in which it is cooked should not reach the boiling-point. The easiest way is to slip the egg (previously broken into a saucer) carefully into salted water which is sim- mering. Then immediately set the saucepan at the side of the range (to prevent the water from boiling) and let the egg remain about ten minutes.* Let the water be about two inches high in a low saucepan. Each egg should be broken separately into a saucer and slipped very carefully into the water. When cooked just enough take out the egg with a perforated ladle (there should be nothing to trim), and slip it on a thin, buttered, and slightly salted square piece of toast which has previously been partly moistened by pouring a little boiling water in the bottom of the platter, and allowing the toast to soak it. As soon as cooked, sprinkle salt and a little pepper over the egg tops. Any substance absorbs more readily the flavor of seasoning when it is hot rather than when lukewarm or cold. Poached eggs are very good introduced into beef broth. Delmonico serves poached eggs on toast with sorrel sprinkled over the tops. Fine water-cresses make a pretty garnish. * W. Matthieu Williams in "The Chemistry of Cooking" says the per- fection of egg-poaching is to keep the egg in water at the temperature of 160° for half an hour.

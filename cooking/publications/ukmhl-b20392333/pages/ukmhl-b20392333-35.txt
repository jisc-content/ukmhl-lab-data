Oysters. incr life is its appropriate digestive ferment-diastase. Mastication mixes tliese constituents and they are di- gested witlioiit other aid. Cooking destroys the digest- ?no- properties of the diastase, and then the oyster has to°be digested like other food-by the eater's own di- gestive power. -, 1 -nw -D 1 4. ? Other authorities question and doubt Dv. Koberts theory. The excessive use of condiments—salt, pepper, lemon-juice, and vinegar—more especially pepper, com- bined with imperfect mastication, may possibly impair the wholesomeness of raw oysters to many persons.* The hard portion, or muscle, which fastens the oyster to the shell should be removed in all cases when served for weak stomachs. The author would recommend oyster soup, properly prepared (the oysters slightly cooked), as the best mode of administering oysters to an invalid. The flavor of the juice and the extra nourishment furnished by the cream or milk used, together with the advantage which foods served warm afford to digestion, would be good reasons for preferring oyster stews or soups. Dr. Bellows, in " The Philosophy of Eating," speak- ing of oysters, says : " They have not, as food, the mus- cle-making elements of the Crustacea or other active fish ; and'although their chemical composition indicates phosphatic salts, they are mostly salts of lime, which go to form the shell and to make bone rather than a food for the brain and nervous system. Oysters, therefore, are very unsatisfactory food for laboring men, but will do for the sedentary and for a supper to sleep on. They contain but 7^ per cent, of solid matter, including fibrin, albumen, gelatine, mucus, and osmazone; and * Whatever the cause, the fact remains that many persons find raw oys- ters quite indigestible.

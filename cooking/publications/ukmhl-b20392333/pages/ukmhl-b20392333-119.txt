101 Liebig's Beceipt matter. The liquor will contaiu the whole of the solu- ble constituents of the meat (albumen, creatine, etc.), and it may be drunk cold or slightly warmed. The temperature should not be raised above 100° Fahr., as at the temperature of 113° Fahr. a considerable portion of the albumen, a very important constituent, will be co- agulated. Liebig's Keceipt foe Beef Tea is nearly the same, viz.:—Ingredients: Half a pound of finely minced raw beef (chicken or any meat may be similarly used), one pint of pure water, four drops of muriatic acid, about one half a saltspoonful of salt. Dilute the acid and salt well in three fourths of a pint of the water, then mix well with the meat. Let it stand an hour; strain through a hair sieve, and rinse the residue with the extra quarter of a pint of water. It may be administered in a red wineglass if the patient should become prejudiced against it on account of its red color. Baron Liebig adds: " The liquid thus obtained con- tains the juice of the meat with the albumen in an un- coagulated state, and syntonine, or muscle fibrine, which has been dissolved by the agency of the acid." It seems strange that Baron Liebig, with so much knowledge of the subject, should have made his " beef extract"* so deficient in nutrient qualities as to be condemned by many eminent physicians. Dr. Dobell says: " It is important to bear in mind that Liebig's extract of meat and other similar preparations con- tain very little, if any, nourishment properly so called. . . . Their principal virtues belong to the class of stim- ulants. . . . When mixed with water they are excellent menstrua in which to administer nutritive materials, * Another preparation largely sold in market.

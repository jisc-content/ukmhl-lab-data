CUSTARDS. Plain Baked Custakd (very good). A PLAIN custard may be made with a piut of milk, either two whole eggs or the yolks of three eggs, and a couple of tablespoonf uls of sugar. It can be flavored with a little nutmeg or extract of lemon. It is very good without flavoring. The eggs and sugar are well beaten together before the milk is added. It is poured into a small pudding dish or basin, and this is set in a larger basin containing hot water, which reaches three fourths to the top of the pudding dish. The two vessels, one in the other, are then placed in the oven until the cus- tard is set (about twenty minutes). As soon as it is set it is done, and should not be left to allow the whey to separate. This is the very best way to bake custards. CusTAKD A LA MoEKisoN (a dclicious custard).

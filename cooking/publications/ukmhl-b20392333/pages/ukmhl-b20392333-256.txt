HARPER'S BAZAR. AN ILLUSTRATED JOURNAL OF FASHION, INSTRUCTION, AND DOMESTIC ECONOMY. Subscription per Year, $4 00. The Eighteenth Volume began with the Number issued on December 19,1884. Harpek's Bazak is the only paper in the world that combines the choicest literature and the finest art illustrations with informa- tion about the latest fashions, methods of household adornment, and all the minor useful arts that are dear to the model house- keeper, and make home attractive. Harper's Bazar is acknowledged as an arbiter of taste and fash- ion. Its weekly illustrations and descriptions of the newest Paris and New York styles, with its useful pattern-sheet supplements and cut patterns, spread the news of the changes of fashion all over the land, and, by aiding ladies to be their own dressmakers, save many limes the cost of subscription. It also furnishes information con- cerning the materials in vogue, with suggestions as to the best meth- ods of making them up at home, and adapting last year's wardrobe to the style of to-day. Its papers on cooking, the management of servants, and housekeeping, from the best sources, are eminently practical. Its illustrated articles and designs for household adorn- ment, art needle-work, etc., are from the highest authorities. Its pithy editorials are marked by good sense and good taste. In literary and artistic merit, Harper's Bazar is unapproached by any journal of its class; its stories, sketches, and other articles being furnished by the best writers of America and Europe, while its superb wood-engravings are marvels of perfect execution.

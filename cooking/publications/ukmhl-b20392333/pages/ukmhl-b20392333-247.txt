229 Appendix. warm, it can be slightly heated (a little more than lakewarm) just before it is administered. The boiling of the food kills the digestive principle of the extract used. Yet it is some- times, in the absence of ice, desirable to boil it in order to keep it. The digestive function is not destroyed by cold tempera- tureâ€”only arrested. I do not understand why it would not be as satisfactory to mix the pancreatic extract with the food just before eating, and allow the entire digestive process to be carried on in the stomach. I merely give the advice of others who ought to know more about it than the author. I will also add that pancreatized barley gruel (made without sugar) is the most palatable of the pancreatized gruels. I am also tempted to add a new receipt for a pancreatized food which is now much used. Pancreatized Oysters. Chop half a dozen raw oysters fine as possible, also pound them. Bring two cupfuls (one pint) of the oyster liquor (it may be part water if there is not oyster liquor enough) to a boil, then thicken it with half a cupful of barley flour, rubbed smooth with half a cupful of water. Let it boil three or four minutes to cook the barley, then add the oyster pulp, and a seasoning of salt and very little pepper. When it comes to the boiling- point again, take it from the fire, and when the temperature is reduced to blood heat, mix in a fourth of a teaspoonful of pan- creatic powder, and half a saltspoonful of soda. Pour it into a glass jar or bottle, and put this into water so hot that the whole hand can be held in without discomfort for a minute. Let it stand an hour as described for milk. It takes a little longer to digest oysters than milk. The dish is most palatable served immediately. It is liable to curdle when brought to the boiling-point again. It can either be placed on ice, or brought to the boiling-point for the purpose of keeping.

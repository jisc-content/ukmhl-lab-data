Bemarks about Foods. Mutton is generally more digestible than beef, it and venison being regarded as the most digestible of all the meats. It is popularly supposed to be a lighter food than beef, the latter being adapted to physical exercise, while mutton is rather a food for persons of sedentary habits, and for invalids. Dr. Smith, in an interesting work on "Foods," says that Kean suited the kind of meat which he ate to the part which lie was about to play, and selected mutton for lovers, beef for murderers, and pork for tyrants. Mutton broth has less nutritive value than beef broth. Venison. When sutiiciently hung and tender, veni- son outranks all meats in point of "digestibility. It is also palatable and highly nutritious. Veal and Lamb. Although the flesh of young animals is more tender than that of old, it is less digestible and less nutritious. Tlie tissues of young animals are more gelatinous than those of the adult, the latter containing more of fibriiie and. of the flavoring principle, omazone. Porh. Unless it be a small, thin slice of breakfast-ba- con taken in the way of an appetizer, pork should be ex- cluded altogether from the invalid's dietary. Althouo-h it is a convenient and inexpensive meat and an appetiz- ing one for many, and perhaps an unobjectionable one for laboring men, yet, on account of the uncertain feed- ing of the animal, and the hardness of its muscular fibre, it is doubtful whether pork should be used at all by peo- ple of sedentary ha])its. Lard and pork have seemed indispensable for frying purposes, and for larding and seasoning. It must be tak- en on trust, however. In the Southern States many are using cotton-seed oil, which has quitetheflavor of olive oil, for cookingâ€”using it in place of lard for everything for which lard is used. It is now sold in all the large cities, and in time will undoubtedly be very generally used.

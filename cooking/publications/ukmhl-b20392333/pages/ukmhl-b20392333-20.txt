Remarlcs about Foods. 2 effect no more stimulating than the use of tea, it would be less injurious to the system, from the fact that tea is mixed with the food, adulterating it with tannin, which is not contained in alcoliol. Dr. Bellows considers Liebig's theory fallacious, and attributes the benefits of tea rather to its osmazone (the flavoring principle). He says that food is more digesti- ble and assimilable when it is taken with gustatory pleas- ure. Tlie aromatic principle of tea commends it to the taste. Pie instances an experiment on a dog that was sluit up and given good natural food containing all the needed elements except osmazone; i. e., the food was cooked and recooked until all flavor and odor were lost. The dog finally refused to eat and pined away. It may be possible that the overcooking renders the fibres and other elements unfit for digestion, making them tough and depriving tliem in some degree of nu- tritive power. The dog's food, in the case named, was, perhaps, little better for dietetic purposes than so much wood. Flavor, or the sense of taste, is possibly an index by which nature, unperverted, determines the proper food to be taken into the stomach at any given time. Professor Lehman also believed that tea and coffee lessen the waste of the body. Dr. Edward Smith be- lieves to the contrary. He says (in "Foods"), "I per- formed a very extended series of experiments on myself and others, which proved that tea excites vital action, and is practically a respiratory stimulant. ... In reference to nutrition, tea increases waste, since it promotes the transformation of food without supplying nutriment, and increases the loss of heat without supplying food." Tea, therefore, he thinks, should only be taken after a full meal, unless the system be at all times replete with nutritive material.

She brought it up just as it was in the dish in which it had got cold—the dish smeary round the rim with Mary Ann’s thumb-marks. The gravy had of course settled, and was thickly studded over with hard white wafers of fat. Some of the fat, too, had of course settled on the meat itself. Yet the meat was in every respect equal to the decorated joint, and many a poor hungry man would see no difference between the two, any more than a hungry bull-dog would. At least, some might even prefer the latter, in order to lap up the cold gravy with the blade of their knives. A poached egg nicely done, the yellow yolk sur- rounded with an equal rim of clear white, in contra- distinction to one badly done, in which the yolk has broken and run and got mixed up with the white, is another instance of how much depends upon appear- ances, for both eggs would be equally wholesome.

217 Turtle Soup. claret-glassful of madeira, which can now be obtained really good at forty shillings a dozen from any re- spectable wine-merchant. If, however, it is not thought necessary to have madeira bought on purpose —and it is a somewhat rare wine in the present day —a similar quantity of good golden sherry will do. The soup is now done, and only requires a few drops of lemon-juice added to it after it is put in the tureen. One of the greatest mistakes in the use of wine for cooking is to think that any wine will do. I have known cases where people have ordered a few bottles of what they chose to call cooking sherry from the grocers, and filthy stuff it has been—enough to spoil anything. If you think turtle soup does not deserve a glass of good wine, my advice is, do not make any. It is no use adding a glass of some horrible concoc- tion called sherry or madeira, and then tasting the soup and saying, “ Ah! it is not a bit like what we had at Francatelli’s.” Of course it is not, and you have only yourselves to blame. The same thing applies to real mock-turtle. “ What does he mean by real mock- turtle ?” I can imagine you saying. But we live and learn. This is exactly the question I asked a waiter many years ago. We were discussing the important subject of what I should have for dinner. “Soup, sir? yes, sir; very nice mock-turtle sir— real mock-turtle, sir.”

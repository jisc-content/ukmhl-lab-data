Game and Gravy. 165 story of the man who arrived home after a days’ shoot- ing, who had, however, been driven to buy a brace for appearances, the look of which called forth the remark from his wife— “ Well, my dear, it is time they were shot, for they are getting very high.” The next point to be considered is the actual cook- ing. We will suppose the birds ready trussed. They should be wiped inside, but never washed. All game requires a brisk fire, and plenty of basting. It is the custom among French cooks to fasten a thin slice of bacon over the breast, in order to prevent the bird being too dr}-. Indeed, they go so far as to send the bird to table with the bacon still on. In my opinion, this spoils the flavour of the bird altogether, giving it what may be termed a greasy taste. If bacon is fastened on at all, it should be taken off before the bird is taken down; the breast should then be basted with a little butter, and frothed and browned before it is sent up. With regard to the time that it takes to cook game, it is difficult to lay down any general rule. The time of course varies with the size of the birds. Young:, small partridges want about twenty-five minutes; good-sized partridges as much as thirty-five minutes ; small grouse will take a little over half an hour, and good-sized ones require three-quarters ; pheasants

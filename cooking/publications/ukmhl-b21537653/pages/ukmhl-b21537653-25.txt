We have endeavoured to explain the art of frying at greater length than it would be possible to do in any work on cooking, and on some future occasion may again call attention to some of the points where ordinary books on the subject seem to us to fail to meet the requirements of small households. Unfor- tunately, many of the best works on cooking are only adapted for very large establishments, or hotels, where probably a book would not be required. For instance, a recipe for Yorkshire pie, as given in one of the best works on cooking yet published, commences as follows :—“ First bone a turkey, a goose, a brace of pheasants, four partridges, a dozen snipes, four grouse, and four widgeons ; then boil and trim a small York ham and two tongues,” &c. The recipe, we have no doubt, is excellent, but with all due submission to so great an authority, it appears scarcely adapted for small families of limited income.

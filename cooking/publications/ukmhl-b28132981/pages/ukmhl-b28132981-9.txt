PREFACE. There is a saying ‘ Dumb as an Oyster.’ It may be dumb, but that is no reason why its lovers should be so; and therefore, in bringing a little volume before the public on the subject of oysters, and the numerous ways in which they can be cooked, I do not wish to be dumb, and I trust my readers will receive this little work as kindly as they have done my previous ones. Personally I agree with the many who consider oysters are best when served in their homely shell ; but there are many who prefer them in gorgeous and fancy dresses, and for these there will be found plenty of oyster costumes in this little book. Several of the recipes are original, and I hope that the result of a trial of them will prove as satis- factory to connoisseurs as those which I have culled from celebrated authorities.

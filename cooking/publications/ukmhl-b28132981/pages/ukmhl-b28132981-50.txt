OYSTERS A LA MODE. 34 hot fat till of light brown colour. They should be dished up on a napkin, and sent very hot to table garnished with fried parsley. Oyster Quenelles. Quenelles dâ€™Huitres. Grate four ounces of the crumb of a stale loaf very finely, add half a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of white pepper, half a teaspoonful of pounded mace, a dust of cayenne, two ounces of fresh butter broken into small pieces, the grated rind of half a lemon, and a table-spoonful of chopped parsley. When these ingredients are all thoroughly mixed, stir in a dozen plump oysters which have been bearded and cut into small pieces ; bind it with the yolks of two eggs and the white of one, and a little of the oyster liquid. Pound all these materials until reduced to a smooth paste; then take a spoon the size required to make the quenelles, and fill it with the forcemeat, and smooth the surface with a knife which has been dipped into hot water. Dip another spoon of the same size into hot water, and with it slip the force- meat out of the first spoon; put it into a buttered dish, and proceed with another quenelle. When as many are made as required, slip the quenelles from the dish into a saucepan of boiling water, and let them poach till firm. Dish them in a circle and mask them with white sauce in which the liquor and some chablis has been strained ; put some of the sauce round, and sprinkle lobster coral and truffle cuttings alternately. Garnish with lemon sippets.

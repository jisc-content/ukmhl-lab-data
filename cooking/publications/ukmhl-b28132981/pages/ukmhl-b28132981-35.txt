Open twelve oysters, put the liquor in a stew- pan, and the oysters in a saucepan, and when nearly boiling take them out and put them in cold water, strain them off, cut away the hard part of the oyster, which must be chopped fine ; then pound eight ounces of cod fish, and put this with the oyster liquor, and two ounces of butter, one tea- spoonful of chopped parsley, one of spring onions, and one of mushrooms. Stir all this on the fire, add half a teaspoonful of flour, wet it afterwards with a little vinegar, and let it simmer till nearly all the sauce is reduced. Just before serving add to it the yolks of two eggs diluted with a little milk, and serve. Iced Savoury Oysters. Take three or four dozen oysters, and after bearding them and straining their liquor from them, cut them up into small pieces and let them soak in Mayonnaise sauce made with lemon instead of vinegar, for two hours. Have some well-flavoured aspic jelly, and whip it till it is frothy. Put some of this at the bottom of the dish it is to be served in ; then place a layer of the minced oyster, and fill it up with oyster and aspic alternately till the mould is nearly full; place a stiff band of paper round and fill in with whipped aspic. Put it on ice for two hours ; remove the paper and serve.

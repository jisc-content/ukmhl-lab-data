12 OYSTERS A LA MODE. Indian Oysters Curried. Huitres a l’lnde. Open and beard two dozen large oysters and preserve their liquor. Mince an onion finely, and fry it in an ounce of butter till tender. Stir into it a heaped dessertspoonful of curry powder, add a little more butter, and pour in gradually a gill ol nicely seasoned stock. When the mixture boils stir in some desiccated cocoa-nut, about a tablespoon- ful, and a small sour apple finely minced. Simmer gently till the apple is dissolved ; then thicken the gravy with a little flour, and season with pepper and salt. Put in the oysters with their liquor, and half of the milk of a cocoa-nut. Let all this stew for a few minutes, stirring it gently all the time ; then add a teaspoonful of strained lemon-juice. Serve with a border of boiled rice. Oyster Cutlets. Cotelettes d’Huitres. Take half a pound of lean and nicely cooked veal, two ounces of butter, half a pound of large stewing oysters. After the beards have been cut away, mince all very small, and pound in a mortar. Soak three tablespoonfuls of bread-crumbs in the liquor of the oysters, and mix with veal mixture ; season with salt, pepper, a dust of cayenne, the juice of half a lemon ; add the beaten yolks of two eggs to the above, and mix all thoroughly. Make up in the shape of small cutlets, egg and bread- crumb them, and fry them. Drain well, and serve in a circle with fried parsley in the centre.

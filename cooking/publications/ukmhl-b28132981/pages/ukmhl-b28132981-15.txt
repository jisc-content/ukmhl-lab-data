INTRODUCTION xi Some, whose stomachs generally require much con- sideration, can eat oysters with impunity. Dr. Paris, however, condemns them for invalids. It is said that if a cupful of hot milk is taken by delicate persons immediately after eating them, it will greatly assist their digestion. The Rev. J. G.

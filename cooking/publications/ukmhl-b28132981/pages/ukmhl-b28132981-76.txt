SHELLFISH. 6o Mussels k la Poulette. Take one quart of small mussels, scrape the shells carefully with a knife, and wash them in several waters. Put a pint of them in a saute-pan with a sliced onion, a few sprigs of parsley, a pinch of salt, a pinch of pepper, and half a pint of chablis. Cover the saute-pan, put it on the fire, and toss the mussels occasionally; when the shells are open the mussels are done ; take them out and take one shell off. Put the other pint on the fire and cook in the same way. Then strain the liquor into a basin, and put into a stewpan half an ounce of butter, and the same of flour ; stir over the fire for three or four minutes, mix the liquor, and add enough water to produce half a pint of sauce; thicken it with the yolk of an egg, and a quarter of an ounce of butter ; add a dessertspoonful of chopped parsley. Dip the mussels in plenty of hot water, drain them well and wipe them. Serve the mussels in their shells, pouring the sauce over them. Ragout of Mussels. Cleanse the shells and boil the mussels. When bearded and the black parts are removed, put them into a basin, and the juice which flows from them into another. Dissolve a lump of butter in a stew- pan, mince some parsley, button mushrooms, and two small shalots. Stew them in the butter with a seasoning of pepper and a tiny grate of nutmeg ; moisten with the liquor and some gravy. If it be not enough, thicken with flour, and put in the mussels to get hot through, but do not let them boil; a few drops of vinegar improve this dish.

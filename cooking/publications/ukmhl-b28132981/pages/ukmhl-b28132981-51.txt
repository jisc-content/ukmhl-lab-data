OYSTERS A LA MODE. 35 Oyster Ragout. Ragout dâ€™Huitres. Take two dozen oysters ; open them, saving all the liquor. Make a thick batter with the yolks ol two eggs, a grate of nutmeg, the minced peel of half a lemon, a spoonful of the juice, a little flour, and two spoonfuls of milk or cream. Dip the oysters one by one into this batter, roll them in bread-crumbs, fry them in butter to a bright brown, and set them before the fire to keep hot. Have ready two dozen chestnuts, shelled and skinned, and fry them in butter. Pour the fat out of the pan, dredge some flour in, rub a piece of butter over it with a spoon, put in the oyster liquor, a quarter of a blade of mace, and half a pint of chablis or vin-de- grave. Let them boil, thicken the liquor with the yolks of two eggs, beaten up with four spoonfuls of cream, and when it is thick pour it over the oysters and serve. Oysters a la Reine. Huitres a la Reine. Take a small oval tin about an inch deep, butter it well all over, and cover with bread-crumbs. Have ready some good oysters, bearded, and free from grit; put a layer of oysters over the bread- crumbs, shake in a little pepper, repeat the bread- crumbs with butter over them, and so on till the tin is full. Pour the oyster liquor (strained) over, and strew bread-crumbs smoothly at the top; pour clari- fied butter over, and brown in the oven for from fifteen to twenty minutes.

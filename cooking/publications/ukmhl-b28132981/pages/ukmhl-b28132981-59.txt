Serve immediately. Oyster Souffld. Take two dozen small oysters, mince them, and rub them through a wire sieve. Blanch and beard a dozen large oysters, and cut each one into four pieces. Put'two ounces of flour and one ounce of butter into a stewpan, and mix them well together over the fire ; then a quarter of a pint of oyster liquor, and stir all together till it thickens and the flour is well cooked. Put this sauce and the pounded oysters into a mortar and pound them well together, adding the yolks of eggs one at a time, a little salt, cayenne pepper, and a gill of cream ; when these are thoroughly mixed, beat three whites of egg to a stiff froth and stir them into the mixture very lightly ; then put in the oysters. Butter the mould, pour in the mixture, cover it with buttered paper and steam it gently for half an hour; strew lobster coral over all. Oyster Soup. Allow three dozen oysters to a quart of soup. Open them carefully, keep and strain the liquor from them, beard the oysters and put the strained liquor over them. Take a quart of the palest veal stock, and simmer the beards in it for twenty minutes, strain, adding a little more stock if required

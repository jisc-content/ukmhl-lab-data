OYSTERS A LA MODE. 36 Oyster Rissoles a la Metropole. Take some large oysters, beard them, and put into a stewpan four large tablespoonfuls of thick brown sauce, with half a shalot chopped fine ; season with a dust of cayenne pepper and half a wine-glass of chablis or sauterne, and half an ounce of glaze ; reduce this to half the quantity, skimming it well, pass it through a sieve, mix in the oysters, and let it stand to get cool. Now take some slices of fat bacon (cooked), stamp them out into little rounds big enough to hold an oyster, cover each oyster with some of the brown sauce and place it on the bacon ; place another round of bacon on the top, press the edges together, and put it between rounds of very thin puff paste, pressing the edges well to- gether. Put them into boiling butter and fry them a pale yellow colour. Have some vermicelli rolled very fine, and dust over them, and then sprinkle them alternately with lobster coral and dried parsley ; garnish with lemon. Oyster Rolls. Cut some slices of brown bread very thin, butter them ; place three oysters, over which a little lemon has been squeezed, a tiny dust of cayenne sprinkled, and roll them up. Serve mounted up in a pyramid on a napkin, garnished with parsley, and celery finely shred handed with them. Oyster Roly Poly. Mix half a pound of flour with a quarter of a pound of very finely-shred suet, freed from skin

OYSTERS A LA MODE. 25 Oysters a la Maitre d’Hotel. Huitres a la Maitre d’Hotel. Open some large oysters in the deep shells, put over each a little Maitre d’Hotel sauce cold, place them on a gridiron, and serve them the moment the liquor boils. Hand lemon and brown bread and butter with them. Oysters with Leg of Mutton. Make half a dozen incisions in the thick part of a leg of mutton, and fill them with a forcemeat made with a dozen fresh oysters boiled in their own liquor for two minutes, then bearded, and minced finely with a shalot, a tablespoonful of scalded and chopped parsley leaves, and the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs. Tie the mutton in a cloth, put it into boiling water, let it boil, then draw it to the side of the fire, and simmer very gently till it is done enough. Serve with oyster sauce. Oysters au Naturel. One of the prettiest ways of serving oysters at an oyster supper is to place a little china barrel before each guest, in which are packed a dozen bearded natives ; large barrels holding three dozen should be placed on the side table ; the lemons cut in quarters and piled high in a dish, garnished with parsley ; plates of brown bread and butter around ; oyster forks on each plate, with little shells for vinegar, and cayenne glasses.

INTRODUCTION. X 144 oysters. The ‘Almanach des Gourmands’ (1803) states that ‘beyond five or six dozen, as a mere indispensable prelude to a winter dejeuner, it is proved that oyster eating most certainly ceases to be an enjoyment.’ Brillat-Savarin once weighed a dozen oysters, and found they weighed four ounces, which gives for the weight of a gross three pounds, and re- marked that the same persons who dined were not a bit the worse after their oysters, who would have been completely satiated had they eaten an equal quantity of any meat, however delicate. He also relates that, in 1798, when he was at Versailles in the capacity of a commissioner of the Directory, that he was frequently thrown in the way of the Sieur Laporte, clerk to the Tribunal of the Department, who was excessively fond of oysters, and often complained that he had never had ‘ his fill of them.’ Brillat-Savarin resolved to procure him this gratification, and invited him to dine. They both ate three dozen, and then Brillat- Savarin had to stop, but the Sieur went on alone ; but when he had arrived at the thirty-second dozen, his host was getting so tired of the game of looking on, he at last exclaimed, ‘ My very dear fellow, I see it is not written that you are to have your fill of oysters to-day ; let us begin our dinner,’ and when they began the Sieur dined ‘ with the vigour of a man who had fasted for twelve hours previously ! ’ Dr. Spencer Thomson, in speaking of the nutri- tive powers and wholesomeness of the oyster, says that when uncooked they are especially wholesome, but their digestibility in all probability depends greatly upon the person by whom they are eaten.

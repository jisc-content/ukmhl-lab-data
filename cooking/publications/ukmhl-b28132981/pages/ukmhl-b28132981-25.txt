9 OYSTERS A LA MODE. •simmer. When warm strain the liquor, and add to it eight or ten sheets of best French leaf gelatine, melted in a gill of oyster liquor, with a good pinch of white pepper; boil it up and clarify it with whites of eggs, tammy it, and then add a little of Marshall’s apple-green colouring. Now have two plain moulds, one about one inch larger than the other, and pour a very little of the jelly into the bottom of the larger one ; then place on it a layer of the oysters, with pieces of the anchovies here and there; cover this with more jelly, but only just enough to make a smooth surface ; lay this on ice. When it is quite firm put the smaller mould inside the larger one, taking care to place it exactly in the middle, so that the vacant space may be the same all round. In this vacant place dispose of the rest of the oysters and anchovies, filling up the interstices with jelly till the whole mould is filled up. Place the mould upon ice to freeze, and when ready to turn out fill the inner mould with warm water, and then pull it out and fill up the inner space with iced lobster sauce, and turn out the entire mould. Garnish with red aspic jelly. Oysters Cold au Naturel. The true lover of oysters will prefer them without any adjuncts except their own gravy, but still there are many who like to have vinegar and pepper, or lemon and cayenne, as accompaniments. Brown bread and butter is usually served with them ; stout or chablis is generally drunk with them.

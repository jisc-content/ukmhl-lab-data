44 OYSTERS A LA MODE. Put the oysters over the fire in their own liquor to plump them, but do not let them boil. Put the soup over the fire, add cayenne, and pour the liquor from the oysters to it, and a pint of cream quite hot; put the oysters into the tureen, and pour the soup over them and serve. Thicken with a dessert- spoonful of corn flour, mixed quite smooth with a little milk, and then added by degrees to the soup (letting all simmer together a little). This should be added before the cream. It is better to boil all cream alone before adding it to soups. Stewed Oysters of the Last Century. Take two dozen oysters, put them in a stewpan with three ounces of bread-crumbs, add the strained liquor from the oysters, a little mace, also pepper to taste, two ounces of butter, and one tablespoonful of vinegar. Boil all together for a short time, but mind the oysters do not harden. Garnish the dish with fried sippets, and serve very hot. Oysters Stewed in Wine a la Ronde. Rub over the bottom and sides of one of the fireproof china dishes with a little butter, lay some oysters in it, strew over them a little pepper and minced parsley, then put to them a small glassful of chablis, cover them with slices of butter cut very thin, strew grated bread over, put a cover on the dish, and set them in the oven with a few hot coals on the cover, and let them cook till they are brown ; then take off the fat and serve hot. Half a glass of champagne is preferred by some, but they are more delicate with chablis.

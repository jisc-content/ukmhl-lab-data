Open two dozen large oysters, add their liquor to half a pint of dissolved aspic jelly, and the white of an egg beaten up with the shell, mix in a small pan, and place on the stove till it boils ; pass the jelly through a tammy. Take a casserole shape, and wet it with cold water, pour in as much jelly as will cover the bottom. Let this set firm, then put in a row of oysters, distant about an inch from each other, and with a spoon pour a little of the jelly over the oysters. Let it get cool. Then have ready some thin slices of beetroot cut lengthways, and with small fancy tin cutters cut out some shapes of beetroot, lay them round in a row the same as the oysters, sauce them over with the jelly, which must be cold but not set. Place alternate layers of oysters, beetroot, and jelly in the mould till it is filled. Put it on ice, and when firm turn it out.

SHELLFISH. 64 chopped parsley, and a little pepper, salt, and a tiny dust of cayenne. Make a white sauce, cook it well, add the squeeze of a lemon, then throw the minced scallops into the sauce for a second, give one turn on the fire, and pour into the shells ; add six drops of chili vinegar, strew bread-crumbs over, and place on the top plenty of little pieces of butter. Brown with the salamander, and serve very hot. Croutes of Shrimps au Diable. Chop fine sufficient shrimps to fill six croutes (see Prawns), cook them in a saucepan with a pat of butter, a dust of cayenne, and a pinch of dry curry powder. Make hot and fill the croute with the mixture, and just before serving add one dessert- spoonful of half glaze over each. Dry Curry of Shrimps. Dissolve a good slice of butter in a saucepan, shake it over a brisk fire till it begins to colour, then put in some picked shrimps and heat them through. Shake the pan well and turn the shrimps frequently. When done lift them out, and put into the saucepan three large onions finely minced, and a bit of butter, and fry till they begin to soften. Add a gill of stock, a large sour apple, and juice of half a lemon, a few pickled gherkins, and two tomatoes (freed from seeds) ; stew all this till it becomes thick, put in the shrimps with a dessert- spoonful of flour, a teaspoonful of salt and a table- spoonful of curry powder. Simmer softly till the whole is done, which will be in about three-quarters of an hour. Serve with rice.

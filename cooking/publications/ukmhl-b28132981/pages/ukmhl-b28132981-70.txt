SHELLFISH. 54 ice. A tablespoonful of cream may be thought an improvement by some, as well as a little flavouring of tarragon and chili vinegar. A little lobster coral rubbed through a sieve and mixed with it makes it look very pretty. Buttered Crab. Pick the meat from the shell of a large crab, mix it with a little salt, pepper, a grate of nutmeg, a spoonful or two of salad-oil, or good cream and vinegar. Be careful to leave out the part near the head, which is not fit to be eaten. Fill the shell with the mixture, strew finely- grated bread-crumbs over it, and heat it in the oven. Garnish the dish with parsley, and send toasted bread to table with it. Hot Crab. Pick the meat out of a crab, clear the shell from the head, then put the meat, with a tiny pinch of nutmeg, a good pinch of pepper, salt, three spoon- fuls of vinegar, some bread-crumbs, and a good bit of butter, into the shell again. Set it before the fire and brown with a salamander. Crayfish a la Bordelaise. Pick and wash the crayfish, put them into a stewpan with some French white wine, sliced onions, parsley, salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg ; toss the fish over the fire till they are done, then drain and keep them warm.

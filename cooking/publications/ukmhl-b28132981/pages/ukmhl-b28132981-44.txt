28 OYSTERS A LA MODE. Oysters and Parmesan Cheese. Huitres au Parmesan. Butter one of the fireproof china dishes, and sprinkle it with browned bread-crumbs. Lay the oysters on this bed of bread-crumbs, strew some finely-chopped parsley and grated Parmesan over them, and then a few more crumbs. Pour in half a glass of chablis and put them in the oven, and pour on a little warm butter whilst in the oven. Oyster Patties (No. i). Petits Pates aux Huitres. Take two dozen oysters, beard them, and cut them up small, strain the liquor, and put the pieces back into it. Put into a stewpan two ounces of butter, and when it is warmed, dust into it as much flour as it will take up, stirring well all the time, but do not allow it to brown. Then stir in three tablespoonfuls of the liquor from the oysters, and add as much thin cream as will make it the consis- tency of good butter. Let it simmer till quite smooth, adding to it a dust of cayenne. Add the oysters and give them a warm through, and then leave to cool. Have some little thin paste cases made in dariole moulds ready baked, and fill them with this mixture. Make them very hot and serve. Some prefer the oysters whole, instead of being chopped, with one drop of anchovy sauce on each oyster. Oyster Patties (No. 2. Another Way). Make some puff paste, roll it out very thin and line some little dariole moulds with it; fill them

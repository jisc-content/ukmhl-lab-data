What joy lies within that crusty coat! What power to please the palate e’er is thine ! What welcome waits thee from th’ impatient throat! Stewed, fried, or roasted, panned or on the shell, Or broiled—-no matter how they choose to serve thee, Thy odours all my senses quick compel, And for a gastronomic battle nerve me. No dainty yet prepared on earth’s broad range Can match thee fresh from out thy pearly cloister. Thy name? we’ll breathe it—Shakespeare’s line to change— Unrivalled dainty! sure thy name is Oyster’ The Family Doctor SECOND EDITION LONDON LONGMANS, GREEN, AND CO.

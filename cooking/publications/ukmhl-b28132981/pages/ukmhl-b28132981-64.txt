OYSTERS A LA MODE. 48 oysters with a silver knife and fork, put them into the sauce, cover the saucepan with its lid, and let it stand on the range for five minutes, taking the greatest care that it does not approach to boiling; the heat of the sauce should be sufficient to cook the oysters—boiling or simmering would simply spoil the dish. Take some little paper cases, which should be less deep than those used for ramekins; take a feather and brush them over with salad-oil, then fill them with the oyster mixture. Oysters a la d’Uxelles. Blanch some large oysters, press them slightly between two dishes till they are cold, slit up, then open without quite severing them. Put a quarter of an inch layer of reduced d’Uxelles sauce inside, and fold the oysters together again, press them slightly, then dip them in frying butter, and fry them in hot fat till they are crisp. Veal and Oysters. Take two pounds of veal cutlets, cut them into thin pieces, put them in a frying-pan with boiling lard, and let them fry till the veal is half done ; then add a quart of large stewing oysters, their liquor strained and thickened with grated bread-crumbs, and seasoned with a dust of cayenne and a grate of nutmeg. Continue frying till the veal and oysters are thoroughly done, give one squeeze of lemon, and serve garnished with croutons soaked in lemon- juice and fried.

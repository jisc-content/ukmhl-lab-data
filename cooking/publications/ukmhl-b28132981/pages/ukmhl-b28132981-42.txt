26 OYSTERS A LA MODE. A coloured glass and a tumbler before each person, and bottles of chablis and stout arranged alternately down the table. Oyster Omelet (No. i). Take twelve good-sized oysters, and mince them very fine ; beat the yolks and whites sepa- rately of six eggs, the white until it stands in a firm froth. Now put three tablespoonfuls of butter into a frying-pan, and make it hot. Whilst the butter is heating, stir a cup of milk into the yolks, and season with a little salt, pepper, and a dust of cayenne. Now add in the oysters, stirring well as you add them gradually. When thoroughly mixed pour in a spoonful of the melted butter, then whip in the whites very lightly. If the butter is hot, put the mixture into the pan, and put it over the fire, and when it begins ‘ to set ’ slip a broad-bladed knife round the sides and very cautiously under the omelet, so that the butter may reach every part. As soon as the centre is set, turn it out to a hot dish, with the browned side uppermost. Oyster Omelet (No. 2). Break two eggs in a basin, the whites separately ; whip them, adding pepper and salt to taste ; mince parsley enough to fill a teaspoon (fry it for a second in a little butter before mincing). Melt some butter in the omelet pan, and when quite hot, pour in the eggs, and when getting firm put in a tablespoonful of rich oyster sauce, and fold it over and serve. This omelet is sometimes sent up with a glass of boiling chablis poured round it.

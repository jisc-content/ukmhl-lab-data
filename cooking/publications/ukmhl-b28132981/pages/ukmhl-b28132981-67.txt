5i SHELLFISH. , Clam Soup. Wash as many clams as may be required, and put them into a saucepan with just sufficient boiling water to keep them from burning. Boil them for a few minutes, and when the shells open, and the juice runs out, take the clams from the shells and chop them small. Strain the liquor, and stir into it the chopped clams ; season it with pepper, and thicken with it a little butter, rolled in flour, and let it boil for a quarter of an hour. A little celery or onions may be added, or a little milk, or the yolks of well-beaten eggs. Stewed Clams (American Dish). Place the clams in a stewpan with a little water, and boil for half an hour, removing the scum carefully ; season the juice with pepper and salt, and serve in the centre of the dish with brown bread and butter sippets around it. Clams can also be fried in batter with egg and bread-crumbs. Â£ 2

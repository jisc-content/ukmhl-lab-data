TI ounce of butter smoothly in a stewpan with half an ounce of flour, add the oyster liquor, a dust of cayenne, a teaspoonful of anchovy sauce, a grate of nutmeg, and a gill of milk.

Stir the sauce again over the fire till the eggs are set. Then add the oysters, let them get quite hot, spread the mixture upon a plate about one and a half inches thick, and put it aside to get cold. Strew some finely-grated bread-crumbs on a board, divide the oyster mixture into equal sized parts, roll these to the shape of balls, egg and bread-crumb them, and fry them in hot fat till crisp and of a pale colour. Pile them up on a napkin and garnish with fried parsley. Curried Oysters. Kari aux Huitres.

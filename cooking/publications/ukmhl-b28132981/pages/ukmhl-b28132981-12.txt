INTRODUCTION. Vlll boat over the beds. As soon as they are taken from their native beds, they are stored in pits, made for the purpose, furnished with sluices, through which at the spring tides the water is suffered to flow. This water being stagnant soon becomes green in warm weather, and in a few days afterwards the oysters acquire the same tinge, which increases their value in the market. They do not, however, attain their perfection, and become fit for sale, till the end of six or eight weeks. They are not considered proper for the table till they are about a year and a half old, so that the brood of one spring are not to be taken for sale till at least the September twelve months afterwards. The more delicate and smallest kinds are called natives, and are used for eating; the coarser kinds are called the deep-sea oysters, and are dredged for, and are used for cooking. There are several kinds of oysters. Of the former, which we receive from Milton, Colchester, and the vicinity of those places, the Ostend, Anglo-Dutch, Arcachon, and the cele- brated Rocher de Cancale and Burton Bindons Red Bank are the best. A very singular circumstance, not generally known, is that the finest oysters we have in Eng- land and Ireland both come from a place with the same name, viz. from Burnham, Essex, in England, and from Burnham, co. Clare, in Ireland. Of the deep-sea oysters those that are unfed are the best, as their flavour is stronger and their flesh is firmer. Real lovers of oysters maintain that no oyster is worth eating till it is quite two years old. Their age is known by their shell, just the same as the age of a tree is known by its bark, or a fish by its scale, and the smaller the oyster the finer its flavour.

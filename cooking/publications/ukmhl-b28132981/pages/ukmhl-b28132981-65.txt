49 OYSTERS A LA MODE Oysters a la Villeroi. Huitres a la Villeroi. Blanch some large oysters, warm them in Villeroi sauce, take them out one by one, and coat them thoroughly; dip them in bread-crumbs and egg, and fry them ; dish them up in a pyramid, and garnish with fried parsley. Villeroi sauce is made with a thickening of butter and flour ; let it be of a good yellow colour. Stir in some fish stock, add a few mushrooms, and a bouquet garni ; simmer for fifteen minutes, pass through a hair sieve, put it in a saucepan again to reduce it, and stir in the yolks of two eggs. Be sure to see the egg does not curdle by cooking it over too fierce a fire. Vol-au-vent of Oysters. Vol-au-vent aux Huitres. Make the vol-au-vent case in the usual way, and prepare the oyster mixture for the inside thus. Beard two dozen oysters, and put the beards and the liquor into a saucepan with an inch of lemon- rind, a small pinch of salt, half a grain of cayenne, a quarter of an inch of mace, and one grate of a nutmeg. Boil quickly for eight minutes, then strain it. Mix a tablespoonful of flour smoothly with two ounces of butter. Add a gill of cream and the oyster liquor, and simmer gently till the sauce is thick and smooth. Put in the oysters, simmer two or three minutes longer, and serve. E

THINGS TO BE REMEMBERED. 121 SATURDAY. Rise at o'clock. Light the kitchen fire, open the house, clean the boots, take them up with the hot water. Do the dining-room fire-side, sweep up the pieces, dust, lay the breakfast; dust the drawing room, clean the fan- light and glass door, thoroughly clean the passage, sweep and rub the walls, beat the mats, clean the steps, clean the kitchen stairs. Strip the beds, empty the slops, fill the jugs and bottles, take away the breakfast, wash up. Make the beds, dust the rooms and the stairs, clean the knives and chamber candlesticks. Thoroughly clean the kitchen, scullery, and all below. Attend to the meals ; wash up. Go to led at o'clock. When the table-cloth is taken off the table, sprinkle it with a little cold water, fold it up in the same creases, and put into the press, or under a board with a heavy weight upon it. If there are spots upon it, take them off by dipping the corner of a clean cloth into hot water and rubbing the spot till it disappears ; by this means a table-cloth is always tidy. If you break any- thing, or find anything broken, mention it at once. Be particular in fixing up the candles; fold two pieces of paper, about two inches and a half long, cross them over the socket, and force the candle in; by this means, the candle will always be upright and steady. When there is the least smell of drains in the house, either deodorising powder, disinfecting fluid, or chloride of lime should be put down the drains. Be very careful to fasten all doors and windows at night. Don’t drop lucifers about the house, and don’t strike them on the wall j use the box.

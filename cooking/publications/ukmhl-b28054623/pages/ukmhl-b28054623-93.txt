PORK, ETC. 61 147. SAUSAGE PUDDING. Rub a quarter of a pound of dripping into half a pound of flour, moisten it with sufficient cold water to make it into a firm paste, knead it well, rub a pint and a half basin with dripping, roll out the paste, line the basin, press the paste so as to make it of an equal thickness, put in a pound of pork and half a pound of beef sausages; turn the paste over, press it together so that the water will not get in ; tie a cloth over; put the pudding into boiling water, and boil fast for three hours; turn out carefully, and serve at once. 148. RAISED PORK PIE. Any part of fresh pork will do, but the part called the hand (the bladebone) will be the most economical. Cut the meat entirely off the bone, and trim off the skin, put the bone and the skin into a saucepan with a pint and a half of cold water, a small onion, four allspice, eight peppercorns, and a saltspoonful of salt. Let it boil slowly for two or three hours, then strain and let it get cold ; it should be reduced to three-quarters of a pint. Cut up the pork into small square pieces; there will be about two pounds and a half; season it with two teaspoonfuls of salt, the same of black pepper. Make a paste as follows. Put six ounces of lard into a large basin, and pour over three-quarters of a pint of boiling water, stir it till it is dissolved, then stir in a pound and a half of flour, knead it to a firm paste, roll it out a quarter of an inch thick. Make the pie either oval or round by raising the paste in plaits, press it to make it the same thickness as the bottom; put in the meat, trim off the paste with a sharp knife, roll that out to the size of the pie ; place it over, wet the edges to make the paste adhere; pinch it round the edge. Make a hole in the centre, pour the gravy into the pie through a small funnel, and bake it in a slow oven for three hours and a half.

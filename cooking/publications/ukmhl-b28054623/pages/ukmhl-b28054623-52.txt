Put the mussels into plenty of cold water and brush them; change the water once or twice, then pull out the weed which hangs to each mussel, and throw them into clear cold water as they are done. When thoroughly cleansed put the mussels into an iron saucepan without water, with a tablespoonful of salt; put on the lid and shake the pan constantly ; when the shells open they are done. Turn them into a tureen or bowl and send to table at once. Note.â€”The weed cannot all be extracted in cleaning the mussels, therefore each one should be examined before eaten. It will be found under the little black tongue, and is sometimes as fine as a hair.

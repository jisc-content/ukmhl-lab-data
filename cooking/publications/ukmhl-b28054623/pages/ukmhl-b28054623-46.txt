14 MEALS FOR THE MILLION. 31. STUFFED HADDOCK. Make a stuffing as follows. Two ounces of fine crumbs of bread; two tablespoonfuls of shrimps, chopped; a tablespoonful of chopped parsley; one shalot, chopped ; two ounces of suet, chopped; a small saltspoonful of pepper, the same of mixed herbs; and one egg. Beat the whole together. Bub the fish over with two tablespoonfuls of salt, and let it remain for two or three hours, then dip it into cold water and wipe it dry. Put the stuffing into the belly, sew it up with fine thread. Lay the fish on a drainer in a dish, put about three ounces of dripping over the upper side, in small pieces ; put it into a moderate oven, and bake for three quarters of an hour. 32. FRIED PLAICE. Lay the fish in cold water with a tablespoonful of vinegar and a dessertspoonful of salt in it. Let it re- main ten minutes; then wash it well, and roll it in a cloth to dry. Beat an egg. Cut the fish across from side to side, into two, three, or four pieces, according to the size of the fish. Dip each piece into the egg on both sides, and then dredge it with flour. Put half a pound of good dripping, or lard, into a frying-pan and when it boils put in the fish, the black side uppermost; fry at a distance from the fire. When one side is brown turn it, and fry the other ; each side will require from eight to twelve minutes, according to the thickness of the fish. Note.â€”Be sure that the fat boils or the fish will be greasy. Try it by putting a small piece of bread in ; if it turns brown the fat boils. Lay the white side uppermost in the dish. 33. BOILED PLAICE WITH ACID SAUCE. Well wash the fish. Put it into plenty of nearly boiling water with a tablespoonful of salt and two of vinegar. Boil up quickly, skim, then simmer for from fifteen to twenty-five minutes, according to the size

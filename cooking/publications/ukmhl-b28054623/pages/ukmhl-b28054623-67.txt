MUTTON AND LAMB. 35 « S5. CURRIED SHEEP’S KIDNEYS. Trim off the pith and the skin, and cut the kidneys, first into halves, and then each half into four pieces. Knead a tablespoonful of curry powder with two ounces of butter. Peel, slice, and chop a good sized onion and a small acid apple. Put the whole into a fryingpan, and fry till nicely browned, stirring con- stantly. Add a teaspoonful of salt and half a small tea- cupful of any kind of gravy, or water; continue to stir and fry for ten minutes. Serve with or without plain boiled rice in a separate dish, and with any kind of pickles or chutney. Note.—The receipt is for eight kidneys. 86. RICE FOR CURRY. Wash a large cupful of rice. Put it into a quart of water, and boil it for half an hour. Stir it frequently to keep it from binning to the saucepan. Drain in a sieve before the fire. Stir it with a fork to divide the grains; then serve it either round the curry or in a separate dish. 87. MUTTON CHOPS. Mutton chops, simple though they be, are rarely nicely cooked and served. The fire should be good and perfectly free from smoky coals, the gridiron clean, and the chops not too fat. Place the chops upon the gridiron about five inches distance from the fire, and turn them twice while broiling, by putting a fork into the fat. A chop three-quarters of an inch thick will require from ten to fifteen minutes to broil, ten minutes to be underdone, and fifteen to be well done. Serve them simply between hot plates the moment they are off the fire. 88. HOT POT. (Second dressing.) Peel eight or nine medium sized potatoes, and wash them in cold water; peel and slice one large onion; cut

THINGS TO BE REMEMBERED. 119 THURSDAY. Rise at o'clock. Light the kitchen fire, open the house, clean the boots, take them up with the hot water. Do the dining-room fire-side, sweep up the pieces. Sweep the passage, beat the mats, clean the steps; dust; lay the breakfast, clean the looking glasses, dust the drawing- room, sweep the kitchen, clean the table and hearth; dust. Strip the beds, open the windows, empty the slops, fill the jugs and bottles. Take away the breakfast, wash up. Make the beds, dust the rooms, and thoroughly clean the best bedroom. Dust the stairs and w. c., clean the knives, the chamber candlesticks and the plate. Attend to the meals : wash up. Go to bed at o'clock. In washing the floor, use sufficient vrater to take up the dust, and to thoroughly cleanse the boards, but not so much as to penetrate the crevices, and mark the ceiling of the room below. In emptying slops down the w. c., be careful not to pour them in so quickly that they overflow the basin, and thus cause damage to the ceiling beneath. Brush the bell-ropes, watch-pockets, and fringe over the head of the beds, or they will become a harbour for moth, and not impossibly for other little enemies to cleanliness and comfort. Do not take laundressâ€™s baskets into the bedrooms, count the linen below, and take it up upon a tray. If there be any spots of candle grease or composite on the table covers or carpets, take them off at once by placing a piece of brown paper over, and then ironing the part with a hot iron. If ink be spilt on any woollen article, take it out by repeatedly washing it in cold water without soap. If done at once no mark will remain.

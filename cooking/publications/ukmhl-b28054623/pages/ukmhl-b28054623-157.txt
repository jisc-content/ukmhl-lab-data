THINGS TO BE REMEMBERED. 125 in cold ; dishes and plates also, and indeed everything for the use of the table. Encourage the habit of putting all things in their place as soon as done with. Varnished walls require rubbing every week with a cloth tied over a long broom. If they become cloudy, wash them quickly with a flannel wrung out of hot water, and polish them with a clean wash-leather. Take any dirty marks off’ the paper of the rooms, by rubbing them with bread two days old. Examine bedsteads frequently, and have them taken down at least once a year ; the spring is the best time. If bugs should be in bedsteads, scrub them well with hot water with soda in it, and then fill every hole with white precipitate powder. Keep bed-room floors well washed in the summer, and if troubled with fleas, put a bunch of rue into the water you use, and put another bunch under the mattress. If the boards are marked with oil, or grease stains, make a paste with Fuller’s earth, soda, and boiling water, spread it thickly over the part, and let it remain two or three days. Cane or rush-bottomed chairs should be cleaned with soap and water occasionally. If buttons come off leather chairs or sofas, put them on at once, by passing a long needle through the chair with twine in it, and tie it underneath. If you find pieces of gilding or molu, steel, veneer, screws of any kind about the house, put them all in one place, so that when it is discovered to what they belong you will have them ready at hand. Keep a tool box, with hammer, screw-driver, pincers, gimlet, glue-pot, nails, tacks, &c. always in a ready place. Don’t use tea leaves for laying the dust, in sweeping carpets, but if you do, let them be washed till all the colour is out. The best thing to use is a number of shreds of cloth, list, or felt carpet, wrung out of cold water. Strew them over the carpet and then sweep them off.

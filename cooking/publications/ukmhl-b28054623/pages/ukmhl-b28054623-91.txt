a& PORK, ETC. sized onion, season it with half a teaspoonful of dried sage in powder, and two cayenne-spoonfuls of cayenne ; rub this into the scored lines, place the head in a deep dish, put it into a moderate oven, and bake for an hour and a half; then put round it six or eight peeled potatoes, and bake another hour and a quarter. Serve the head, in the centre and the potatoes round it. 141. BOILED LEG OP PORK. If a leg of pork weighing six pounds has been in pickle more than five days, it must be washed and put into cold water ; but if less, it must be put into warn water with the salt upon it. Put it in the pot the skin side uppermost, and quite cover it with water. Let it come slowly to the boil. Skim, then simmer for two hours and forty minutes from the time of boiling up. If carrots be served with the pork, boil them with it; they will require two hours. Serve the pork the skin side uppermost, and a little of the liquor it was boiled in, in the dish. Note.â€”Eeserve the liquor in an earthen pan, uncovered. 142. BOILED HAND OP PORK. A hand of pork, although not so thick as a leg, requires rather more boiling, in consequence of it being more sinewy. The thin streaky part also requires more boiling. Therefoi'e any of these parts may have half an hour to the pound, reckoning from the time of boiling up, five pounds weight or under, and beyond that a quarter of an hour for every extra pound will be sufficient. If the pork has been in salt beyond four days, it must be washed, and put into cold water ; but if less, it must be put into warm water with the salt upon it. Put it in the skin side uppermost, boil up slowly, skim, then simmer till done. Lay the pork on a hot dish, the skin side uppermost, pour a little of the liquor into the dish, and serve. Keep the liquor in an earthen pan to make soup.

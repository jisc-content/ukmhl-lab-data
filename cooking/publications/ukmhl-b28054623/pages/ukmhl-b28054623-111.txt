PUDDINGS, PASTRY, ETC. 79 Note. The cost given of each pudding is exact, agreeing with the list of prices subjoined ; therefore, if the right quantities be used, it can only vary with the market prices, which may be higher or lower according to localities, season, and other circumstances. Every pudding is sufficient for four persons, and many of them for six or seven, which will be easily seen by the weight of the chief ingredient, namely, flour, bread, or rice. List of Prices.

28 MEALS FOE THE MILLION. 69. KOAST BEEAST OF MUTTON. Hang the mutton before a good fire with the screen round it; baste frequently till done. The breast, being very fat, requires more cooking than any other part, although it is thinner; therefore, whatever the weight, or if it be a part of or the whole breast, it may be roasted for an hour and a half. As no gravy will drip from this joint, it will be well to have a Sussex pudding with it (see the receipt), or to put the potatoes under it to brown for a quarter of an hour before serving. Place it on a very hot dish. 70. EOAST LEG OF MUTTON. A leg of mutton is much better for being kept some days. When about to roast it, hang it four inches distance from a good fire, and let it roast for a quarter of an hour.

Place the mutton on a hot dish, the skin side downwards ; pour the fat into a basin, add a teacupful of boiling water, and a saltspoonful of salt to the gravy dripped from the mutton ; pour it into the dish and serve. 71. BOILED LEG OF MUTTON. A leg of mutton, although thicker than a shoulder, does not require quite so much time; as, generally, it is liked rather less done. A leg weighing six pounds will be nicely done in an hour and a half from the time of boiling up, and for every extra pound allow eight minutes longer. Put the mutton into an iron pot, the skin side downwards, well cover it with cold water, boil up quickly, skim, then simmer gently (skimming often) till done. Serve with or without caper sauce, made as follows. Knead an ounce of butter with a

MEALS FOE THE MILLION. IX DINNERS. In the arrangement of the dinners, the joints are intended to mark Sunday or the early part of the week; as some of the viands suggested, can only be obtained at the end of the week. The second dressings of each joint are given in succession ; but in cold weather, when meat will keep, other dinners may be introduced between them ; this would give a greater variety of diet, which is always advisable when it can be had without waste. The joints, and all other dishes are in quantities suitable to serve to two or three persons; therefore with increase of numbers, a proportionate increase of quantity must be added. The dinners, as well as the dishes for other meals, must only be regarded in the light of helping suggestions, as it is needless to state it would be impossible to meet the requirements of all. From January to May. 1. Roast leg of pork. Greens. Potatoes. Smyrna pudding. 2. Potato soup. Pork primer. Turnip tops. 3. Mutton sea pie. Potatoes. Celerina pudding. 4. Stuffed haddock. Broiled beef-steak. Potatoes.

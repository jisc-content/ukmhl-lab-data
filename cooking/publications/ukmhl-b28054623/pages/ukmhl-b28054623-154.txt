MEALS FOE THE MILLION. 122 SUNDAY. Rise at o'clock. Light fires, make the fire-sides neat, sweep up the pieces; sweep the passage, dust both the rooms, clean the boots and the knives, lay the breakfast. Make the kitchen neat, strip the beds, open the windows, empty the slops, fill the jugs and bottles. Make the beds; dust. Take away the breakfast; wash up; attend to the meals. Church. Go to bed at o'clock. Keep a strict account of money laid out for your mistress. Be neat and clean in your person at all times. Go to church when you leave the house for that purpose. If you occasionally wish to go elsewhere, ask permission of your mistress; but don’t deceive her. Note.—The plan of writing out a book for regulating the work of the house, has been successfully followed for twenty-five years. Servants have occasionally ob- jected to it, but as soon as they found that in the end the system saved them trouble, they have used it as wished. The plan therefore is put forth and recom- mended with confidence. The outline of the book is only intended as a helping suggestion, as it would be impossible to give rules to suit all.

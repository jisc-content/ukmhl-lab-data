MEALS FOE THE MILLION. 108 done. A small chicken will require half an hour, but the fire must be good, and the screen must be round it, or it will not be done in that time, and if longer time be taken the chicken will not be so good in flavour, or so nutritious. Serve without gravy or sauce. Note.â€”The bones will make a cup of very nice broth if broken and stewed two hours; see the following receipt. 286. CHICKEN BROTH. Break up the bones of any cold chickens, whether boiled or roasted. Put them into a saucepan with a pint and a half of the liquor the chicken was boiled in, or cold water, a sprig of parsley, the white heart of a lettuce or endive, and half a saltspoonful of salt; simmer till it is reduced to a cupful, then strain. Take off every particle of fat and serve with fresh toasted bread cut into strips. 2S6a. MINCED CHICKEN. Cut up the cold chicken, take off the skin, and chop the meat as fine as possible. Season it with half a saltspoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of either potato flour, oswego, or well baked flour; put it into a bright saucepan, with a teacupful of gravy made from the bones, or the same quantity of milk. Simmer very gently, shaking the saucepan frequently, for half an hour. Serve with boiled macaroni placed round it. Soak an ounce of Genoa macaroni in warm water for an horn-; boil it in a quart of water for two hours, then drain on a sieve, and serve as directed.

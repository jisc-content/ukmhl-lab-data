The choice of fish should be made according to the market, as the prices vary from day to day; and in London, even, from morning to night. A dish of fish, for three persons, selected from any of the following receipts, should not cost more than from eightpence to a shilling. Salmon however must be excepted, and considered as a luxury ; as it is rarely less than fifteen pence a pound.

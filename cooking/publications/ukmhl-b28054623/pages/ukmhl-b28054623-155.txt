123 THINGS TO BE REMEMBERED. Things to he Remembered. Gas : A small gaselier used daily, will require a little water to be put in frequently; it is therefore better to do it regularly on a certain day every week; there is then no danger of it being forgotten. It is put in at the top of the pipe in which the inner pipe works; the globes should be cleaned on the same day. Be very careful to turn the gas off at every burner before it is turned off at the meter. Wash the globes in a tub with a cloth at the bottom, as there is a risk of cracking them if a pan or a basin be used. When workmen are doing repairs you should lay down a cloth, that they may not injure the carpet or , oilcloth with their tools and chips. The kitchen chimney requires sweeping every five or six weeks, but the mouth of the chimney should j be swept every morning, when the fire is lighted. If good fires are kept in the other rooms the chimney should be swept twice during the year. A broom I should be put up, and the register well cleared every ; day; Smoky Chimney : When a chimney smokes on first lighting the fire, set light to a large piece of paper and hold it up the chimney. If the smoke is caused by : damp or fog in the chimney, this will dispel it. Don't let the leaves remain in the teapot, they will discolour it, and cause it to be furred. It shoidd be emptied quickly after each time of using, washed out with hot water, and wiped inside and out with a ! clean soft cloth, then rubbed with a wash-leather, and be put away with the lid open. By attending to this, the teapot will not get furred ; should it however be discoloured, put a piece of soda, the size of a nut, into it, fill it with boiling water, and let it stand some hours. Pour the water away through the spout, scrub the inside with salt, pick out the holes of the spout with a wire skewer, rinse the pot several times, and then wipe it dry. This applies to coffee pots also.

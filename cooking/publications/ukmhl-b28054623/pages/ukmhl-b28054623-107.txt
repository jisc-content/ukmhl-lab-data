VEGETABLES. 75 fifteen to forty-five minutes. When clone, pour them into a colander, take out the mint, turn the peas on to a hot dish, stir a piece of butter the size of a walnut into them, and serve at once.

If cut, twenty-five minutes will boil them. In either case, for variety, they may be afterwards fried with a chopped onion and two ounces of good dripping; or this may be done, if any be left, on the following day. 183. CURRIED VEGETABLES.

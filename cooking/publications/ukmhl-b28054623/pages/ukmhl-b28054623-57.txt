MUTTON AND LAMB. 25 In all sauces where capers or gherkins are ordered, the pickled leaves or berries of nasturtiums (see receipt) may be substituted. They are very good, inexpensive, and little trouble to make. In making melted butter or thickening any kind of sauce, it must be stirred one way, or the butter will oil, and the sauce will be spoiled. Dish covers should never be hung up without being wiped first; and they should be dusted inside and out, and made hot before putting them over the dish. They should be kept very bright all over. Plates and dishes should be made hot before the fire; the oven spoils them, and also makes them too hot. 62. ROAST SHOULDER OP MUTTON. A shoulder or part of a shoulder of mutton, weighing six pounds, will require roasting an hour and three-quarters, and above that weight allow a quarter of an hour for each pound. Hang it before a good fire, and as soon as the fat begins to drip, baste it frequently. Half an hour before it is done sprinkle it over with a saltspoonful of salt, and dredge it with dry flour; baste it well, then leave it till done. When ready to serve, lay it on a hot dish, the skin side uppermost, pour the dripping off into a basin, add a teacupful of boiling water to the gravy that has dripped from the mutton, pour it into the dish and send it to table at once. 63. HALF A SHOULDER OF MUTTON STUFFED. The blade-bone end is the best. Put a sharp-pointed knife into the fat on the cut side, and loosen it from the lean. Make a stuffing with the following ingredients. A small head of celery, a good sized onion, half of an acid apple, all cleaned, peeled, and chopped small ; a tablespoonful of fine crumbs of bread, a saltspoonful of pepper, half a saltspoonful of salt; the same of powdered sage and powdered mixed sweet herbs, and a teaspoon- ful of chopped parsley. Mix these well together, and

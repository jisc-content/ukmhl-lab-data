MEALS FOE THE MILLION. 62 149. BOILED BACON. Soak the bacon in cold water for an hour or longer ; scrape the skin and the under part, put it into cold water, boil up very slowly, then simmer gently till done. A piece weighing three pounds will require two hours; and twenty-five minutes extra must be added for each extra pound up to six pounds weight, and over that ten minutes for each extra pound will be sufficient. Pull the skin off, and grate a little stale crust of bread over the fat, then serve. 150. BAKED BACON AND EGGS. Cut as many rashers of bacon as wall be required, trim off the bones and rind. Lay the bacon upon a tin dish, and put it into a well-heated oven for a quarter of an hour; crack the number of eggs required separately in cups and lay them carefully on the rashers ; put the dish again into the oven for about seven or eight minutes till the eggs are set. Serve in the same dish placed upon another. 151. EOAST PIG. Make a stuffing with the following ingredients. Two medium sized onions and two juicy apples, peeled and chopped, two ounces of currants, washed and rubbed dry, four tablespoonfuls of crumbs of bread, a tea- spoonful of sugar, a saltspoonful of salt, a salrspoonful of ground ginger, the fat from the kidneys of the pig, chopped, and enough milk to moisten the whole; put this stuffing inside of the pig and sew it up. Kub the skin with a clean cloth, dredge it with flour, and spread it over thickly with dripping. Place the hook through the throat, and hang the pig before a good lire at a distance of twenty inches from the bars, and roast slowly for two hours and a half. Shorten and lengthen the chain once or twice, so that every part may be well done. Place the pig on a hot dish the back uppermost, and serve with some gravy in a tureen.

60 MEALS FOR THE MILLION. 143. BOILED PIG’S CHEEK. This part requires to be well salted, as it is very fat. Put it into cold water, boil up slowly, skim, then simmer for two hours from the time of boiling up. If carrots or parsnips are to be served with it, they should be boiled with it. Carrots can be put in as soon as the water boils, and parsnips an hour and a quarter after it boils. Place the cheek on the dish, skin side upper- most, and put the carrots or parsnips round it. 144. PORK CHOPS. Put the chops into a cold fryingpan, place it at a distance from the fire, and fry them very slowly. The chops should be the thickness of the bone, therefore the time will depend on the size of the meat; if small, twenty-two minutes, and if large, half an hour will be required from the time the pan has become hot. Turn them twice while frying, by putting the fork into the fat; and just before serving season them slightly with pepper and salt; about a saltspoonfril of pepper and a small teaspoonful of salt will be enough for four or five chops. Serve them very hot. Note.-—Don’t cut the chops to see if they are done, as it lets out the moisture of the meat, and also destroys the good appearance. Notice the time of putting them on, and they will be done at the time given. 145. PORK SAUSAGES. Pork sausages are nicer roasted than any other way. Hang them on the jack without dividing them, and let them roast before a bright fire for half an hour. Toast a round of bread, lay the sausages upon it, separate them one from the other, and serve them at once. 146. BOILED PORK SAUSAGES. Put the sausages into cold water, boil up quickly, then simmer for twenty minutes. They may also be served on toast.

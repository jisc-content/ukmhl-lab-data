PORK, ETC. 67 cover closely, and simmer gently for two hours, occa- sionally shaking the saucepan. Or it may be put into a brown jar, tied over with stiff paper, and baked in a moderately heated oven for two hours and a half. Serve it very hot, and neatly placed upon the dish. Note.â€”A hare should be kept a week or ten days. Cut open the belly and take out the paunch, put a cloth into the opening, hang up the hare, and place a basin under the nose to catch the blood. When about to skin it, lay it on its back, loosen the skin from the ribs and back, place the hand in the opening and pull the legs out of the skin, turn the skin over the back, pull out the shoulders, turn it over the head, and pull it off entirely. Then proceed as directed in the receipt. 160a. ROAST WILD DUCK. If the duck be unplucked and undrawn, follow the directions contained in the note under the receipt for roast goose. Hang the duck before a good fire, baste it with dripping or lard, and roast it for twenty-five minutes. Then serve, with a cut lemon, in a plate, and the cayenne caster at hand, and no gravy. Wild duck should not be overdone or it will be very dry and tasteless. Or it may be cooked in the following man- ner. Cut up the duck into joints, season it with a teaspoonful of salt, and half a saltspoonful of cayenne. Put it into a saucepan with an ounce of butter, and one shalot and the liver, chopped; cover the saucepan, place it by a slow fire, keep it closely covered, and simmer shaking the pan frequently, for one hour; then add the strained juice of one lemon and two oranges. Shake the pan over the fire for five minutes, then serve. Cold wild duck may be redressed in this way : in this case, a quarter of an hour will be time enough, and the juice must be put in with the duck. r 2 V

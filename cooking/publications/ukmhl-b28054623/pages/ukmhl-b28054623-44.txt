MEALS FOE THE MILLION. 12 Frying Fish. The fat should boil before the fish is put in the pan, which is easily known by putting a small piiece of crumb of bread into it; if it boil, the bread will at once become brown ; and if not, it will swell and absorb the fat. There should be sufficient fat to entirely cover the fish. If these remarks be attended to, the fish will be nicely browned on both sides, and will be dry; but if not, it will be soddened, unsightly, and very unwholesome. 24. FEIED SOLES. Eub a slice of bread to fine crumbs, put them in the oven to become quite dry, then roll them to a fine dust with, the rolling pin. Wash and wipe the soles. Beat an egg, dip the soles into the egg on both sides, and then into the crumbs. Put half a pound of dripping into the flying pan, and when it boils put in the soles, the skin side next the pan, and fry at a distance till nicely browned, then turn them and fry the other side : about seven minutes for each side for medium sized soles. Drain them on a sieve before the fire for two or three minutes, then send them to table. 25. SAVOUEY SOLES. Make a seasoning with the following ingredients. Two ounces of fine crumbs of bread; three ounces of fat bacon chopped; a tablespoonful of shrimps, chopped; a dessertspoonful of chopped parsley; a very small onion chopped; a saltspoonful of mixed sweet herbs, in powder; half a Cayenne-spooniul ol Cayenne ; all mixed well together. W ash a medium sized pair of soles, wipe them dry. Beat an egg; dip the soles into the egg, and then into the seasoning, on both sides. Lay them on a dish, cover them with another dish, put them into a well heated oven, and bake for thirty-five minutes. Then serve. Be carelul not to knock oil' the seasoning in changing the dish.

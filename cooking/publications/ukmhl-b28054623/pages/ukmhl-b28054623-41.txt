9 SOUPS AND GRAVY. 20. A DINNER COOKED IN CAPT. WARRENâ€™S COOKING POT. Put in the water, and prepare the pot as directed by the inventor. Then place a piece of the round of beef, about five pounds, in the centre compartment, together with two onions peeled and sliced ; one large turnip, peeled and cut into four ; two good sized carrots scraped cut in two, and the thick end split in two ; a quart and half a pint of water and (over the beef) a good salt- spoonful of salt; cover it with the steamer, place the pot over the fire, and when it boils let it continue to do so for three hours and a half. Any kind of pudding that may be boiled can be cooked in one end of the steamer, giving it the same time as for boiling, and the potatoes can be steamed half an hour in the other end. Take the beef and the carrots out, place them on a dish, pour a cupful of the soup over, cover it with a hot cover, and place it over the pot to keep hot. Skim the fat off the soup, pour it into a tureen, and send to table at once. Thus you have excellent soup, very tender beef, two kinds of vegetables, and a pudding, with very little trouble. No skimming required. 21. GRAVY, NO. 1. Peel a medium sized onion, sprinkle over it a tea- spoonful of moist sugar, put it on an old plate, and bake it in a slow oven till it is quite black through, but not burnt; then put it into a small saucepan with half a pound of very fresh gravy beef, one clove, two allspice, six black peppercorns, and a pint-and-a-half of cold water; let it come very slowly to boiling heat, skim carefully and simmer for three hours; toast half a slice of bread till it is well browned and crisp, put it into the gravy, simmer half an hour longer, add a tablespoonful of any good ketchup or sauce, a saltspoonful of salt, and half a mustardspoonful of mustard. Take out the beef and spice, and rub the gravy through a fine sieve.

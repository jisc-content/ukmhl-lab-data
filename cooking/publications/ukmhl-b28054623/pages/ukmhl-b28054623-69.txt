37 MUTTON AND LAMB. 91. LEG OF LAMB ROASTED. All young meat should be well done. A leg of lamb weighing from four to five pounds will require to be roasted an hour and a half before a good fire at a distance of eighteen inches. Baste it constantly ; ten minutes before it is done dredge it with dried flour and a saltspoonful of salt. When about to serve, lay it on a hot dish, the skin side downwards; pour off the dripping, add a small teacupful of boiling water to the gravy dripped from the lamb, put it into the dish, and send it to table at once with mint sauce in a tureen. 92. MINT SAUCE. A tablespoonful of chopped fresh mint, a table- spoonful of moist sugar, and two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, mixed well together. 93. LAMB’S FRY. Cut up the liver into slices, dip it into cold water, wipe it dry, and dredge it with flour; put the rest of the fry in boiling water for five minutes ; wipe it dry and dredge it with flour; put six ounces of good dripping into a fryingpan, and when boiling hot, put in the fry (not the liver), and fry at a distance from the fire, till it is of a pale brown colour on both sides (about twelve minutes) ; put it on a hot drainer, while the liver is fried in the same fat for eight minutes. Lay that to drain while the gravy is made; pour the fat away, dredge the fryingpan all over with a dessertspoonful of flour, a saltspoonful of salt, the same of pepper; put in an ounce of butter, shake the pan till it is slightly browned; pour in by degrees a teacupful of boiling water, shake till it is nicely mixed; add a teaspoonful of any kind of good sauce or ketchup; pour it into a dish, lay in the fry, and send it at once to table. 94. LAMB’S HEAD AND MINCE. Cleanse the head and pluck well. Put them into a saucepan with sufficient cold water to cover them, and

If a lamp be used, it must be trimmed every day, or it will not bum well. A basket should be kept in a dry place with all the things for trimming and cleaning the lamp. To trim the lamp, cut the wick off evenly, close to the burner, and be careful not to let the pieces drop into the lamp; pour in the oil within an inch of the top. Wipe the screws and the neck of the lamp, wind it up twelve turns of the key, rub the chimney with a wash leather, put it on, dust the globe, put it on and put the lamp at once in its place. Ten minutes before lighting it, wind it up again, turn up the cotton about the third of an inch high, light it all round with a u-ax lucifer, put on the chimney so that the holes below the splits of the holder are quite free. The projecting part of the chimney should be half an inch above the lighted part of the cotton, then put on the globe. Be careful not to touch the ground side of the globe, as the fingers will mark it. The oil must be kept closely bunged, and in a warm, dry place. The cottons must be perfectly dry, and will require to be changed every four days. Don’t wipe the foot of the lamp with an oily cloth. Wash ground glass globes with soap and with soda in the water.

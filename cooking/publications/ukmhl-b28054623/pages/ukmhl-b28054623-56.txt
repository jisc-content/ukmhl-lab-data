MEALS FOE THE MILLION. 24 order ; it should always be in the same place, together with the wheel, hooks, and chain. The screen and dripping-pan must be kept perfectly clean and bright—not merely for the appearance, but for the utility, as the bright tin attracts the heat and assists in cooking the joint. The fire should be good and the screen placed before it, before putting down the joint. The basting-ladle should have its place near the screen, that all may be at hand when required for use. In frosty weather the meat should be in the kitchen some time before it is cooked; and in cooking it, whether roasting or boiling, a quarter of an hour should be added to the time given in the receipts for cooking joints of six pounds weight. Steaks, chops, and sausages also require more time; about two minutes extra will be sufficient. The deep tin dishes mentioned in many of the receipts are called souffle tins, and may be had any size you require, price from eightpence to two shillings. They are much nicer for many of the dishes, particu- larly those of second dressings and puddings, and if kept bright they are better in appearance than a pie dish that is frequently used. They should be placed on another dish and covered when sent to table. 1 The gravy that has dripped from the meat ’ will be found under the dripping; therefore the dripping must be poured off very carefully and entirely, before the water is added. All things that are stuffed are better for being pre- pared an hour or longer before cooking, as the article then becomes impregnated with the flavour of the stuffing. Any kind of pepper may be used except where specified. The liquor that any kind of meat has been boiled in. should be kept; it makes excellent soup, as will be seen by the receipts. It must never be left in the saucepan or pot to get cold, but be poured into an earthen pan and kept uncovered. This is very im- portant.

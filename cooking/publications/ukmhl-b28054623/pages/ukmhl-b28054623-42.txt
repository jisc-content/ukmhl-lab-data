10 MEALS FOE THE MILLION. 22. GEAVY MADE FEOM THE BONES OF COOKED MEAT, NO. 2. Any kind of bones may be used for gravy ; they should be broken with a chopper; the quantity of gravy must depend on the quantity of bones. A quart of water will make a pint of gravy by simmering for four hours. For that quantity cut up and fry, in good dripping, till well browned, a large onion, half of a small carrot, and half of a small turnip ; while frying add a saltspoonful of flour of mustard, the same of salt, half a saltspoonful of pepper, a small teaspoonful of moist sugar, two allspice, and six black peppercorns. Skim often, and half an hour before the gravy is done, moisten a tablespoonful of flour with a large table- spoonful of ketchup, and stir in. Strain before serving. 23.

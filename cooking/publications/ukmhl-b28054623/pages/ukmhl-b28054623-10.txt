PEEFACE. VI receipts. The joints selected, and the mode of cooking them, are suck as to suit small means, and a small amount of culinary appliances. Most of the puddings are new, and have been tested by the authoress. The exact cost of each is given, and a priced list of every ingredient to he used, precedes the receipts. In Delicacies far Invalids, there is little that is new. Strict economy too is laid aside ; as for the sick we must be con- tent to make a sacrifice. A Few Remedies, a Little Advice, Things to be Remembered, a Short Ready Reckoner and a Table of Wages, it is hoped will prove to be useful. To increase the perspicuity, notes or remarks, as well as an Index, precede each division or class of receipts ; and a calculation of the probable amount of expenditure for one week is added to the meals. If the authoress succeeds in lightening the labour of inexperienced housewives, and in teaching them to â€˜practise economy with comfort, she will not have worked in vain.

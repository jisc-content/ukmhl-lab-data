126 MEALS FOE THE MILLION. Clean combs with thread. Washing them splits the teeth and spoils them. Wash hair-brushes in warm water, with yellow soap, rinse them, and wipe them dry, turn them on the bristles to dry. Don’t clean ladies’ kid boots with blacking, put the hand inside the boot, and with an old tooth-brush wash off the mud with cold water, wipe the boot dry, then brush it with a small clothes-brush, which should be kept for the purpose. The hand should not be dirty or it will soil the lining. To maize dry toast.—Cut the bread a quarter of an inch thick, toast it at a distance till it is nicely browned all over, turn it, and toast the other side. Then put it into the rack. Dry toast should be quite crisp through. To make tea.—The inside of the pot must be bright, or at least quite free from fur. For two breakfast cups of good tea, put in three ladles. Make the pot quite hot, put in the tea, and pour fresh boiled water over it. Let it stand four or five minutes. Never put water in a second time without putting in more tea. To make coffee.—The coffee must be fresh ground : make the biggin hot, put the coffee into the lower part of the upper compartment, press it down with the coarse drainer, pour the quantity required of fresh boiled water over, stand it on the hob, or before the fire till it has filtered through. Take off the upper part and send the coffee to table at once. To make very strong coffee an ounce to a cup is required. The flavour of coffee is much improved by slightly re-roasting the coffee before grinding it. It may be done in a small untinned iron frying-pan (which should be kept for the purpose). Put in the coffee, and shake it over the fire till it is quite hot. The little pan will cost about 9d.

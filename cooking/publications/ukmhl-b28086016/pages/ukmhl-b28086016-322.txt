300 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT Knowing the weight of a grown man or woman, and some- thing of the daily occupation, as in the case of a professional man, we can estimate the probable energy requirement somewhat as follows: Sleeping, 8 hours; 8 x 0.4 Calories = 3.2 Calories per pound. Sitting quietly (at meals, reading, etc.), 8 hours ; 8 X 0.6 Calories = 4.2 per pound. At light muscular exercise (dressing, standing, walking, etc.), 6 X 1.0 Calories = 6.0 Calories per pound At active muscular exercise 2 hours, 2 X 2.0 Calories = 4 Calories per pound. Total Calories per pound for 24 hours, 17.4; 17.4 X 154 pounds (the weight of the average man) = 2679.8, or 2680, Calories per day required. Calculate in this way the energy requirement for various grown persons whom you know. Energy requirements during growth. â€” In estimating food requirements of those who are under twenty-five years old, we must bear in mind that the same materials which serve for fuel serve in part for building material. Protein is used for muscle building as well as for supplying energy, and the larger one grows, the greater the reserves of carbohydrate and fat which he can carry. Furthermore, internal activity is greater in the young than the middle aged or very old, and external activity is apt also to be greater. Think, for in- stance, how much running children do compared with their parents. For all these reasons, we cannot use the table for adults in calculating the energy requirement of young people. In the following table an attempt has been made to take ac- count of their greater needs, but the estimates include only moderate exercise; with hard work more will be required. Notice that the highest allowance per pound of body weight is for the youngest children.

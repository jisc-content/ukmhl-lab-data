Digestion of carbohydrate. â€” The simplest carbohydrate is a sugar which cannot be broken up into other sugars. Such a simple sugar is called a monosaecharid. There are two common in foods, glucose and fructose ; a third, galactose, is derived from more com- plex sugars. Two simple sugars united chemically make a double sugar or disaecharid; thus cane sugar or sucrose will yield glucose and fructose, while milk sugar or lactose will yield glucose and galactose, and maltose will yield two portions of glucose. These three disaccharids are the only common ones. Starches, dextrins, and cellulose or vegetable fiber are made of many simple glucose

FOOD PREPARATION 61 This is now the common practice. Tin and glass half-pint cups are made gauged in quarters and thirds. Those commonly on sale sometimes measure more than one fourth of the standard quart. Inquire when you buy if the cup measure is standard, — that is, exactly one half standard pint. A quart measure, with four divisions, is necessary for careful work. A pint measure is convenient, but not necessary if you have the quart and half-pint measuring cup. It is necessary to know the relation of these different weights and measures to each other. While you may find tables of relative weight and measures in many cookbooks, it is much better for you to work out a few of the most useful for yourself, making careful record in your notebooks. The following abbreviations are short cuts in reading and writing. oz. = ounce lb. = pound ssp. = saltspoonful tsp. = teaspoonful tbsp. = tablespoonful cp. - cup pt. = pint qt. = quart gall. = gallon If you wish something quicker even than this for note- book work, you can use, t = teaspoonful T = tablespoonful C = cup P = pint Q = quart G = gallon Experiments in weighing and measuring.1 Answer these questions by performing the experiments, in notebook in orderly form. Record 1 Teacher’s Note. — These experiments may be performed as each food material is used. In this case a page should be kept in the notebook for the table of weights and measures, and each observation recorded as it is made. It may be that the perishable articles will not be on hand, except as they are used in order. The weighing and measuring should be dwelt on all through the course.

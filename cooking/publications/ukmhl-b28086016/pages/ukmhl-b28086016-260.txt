None of the mollusks have high nutritive value, but they are a protein food, and add to the variety of the diet. The com- position of the oyster is shown in Fig. 65, and it will be noted that the fat percentage is small and the calorie value low. The oyster is raised in beds in the ocean, or bays often near the river mouth, and it is the neighborhood to the river that makes it possible for the oyster to carry germs of contagion, particularly of typhoid fever, when city sewage poured into the river passes over the oyster bed. Here, too, government protection is essential, and this is a matter that has created so much excitement that conditions are already improved.

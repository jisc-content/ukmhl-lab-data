v PREFACE This volume, like its companion, Shelter and Clothing, is in- tended for use in the course in household arts in the high school and normal school, whether the work be vocational or general in its aim. It is hoped that both volumes will prove useful in the home as well, including as they do a treatment of the homecrafts, and the related topics now so significant to the home maker, â€” the cost and purchasing of foods and clothing, the cost of operating, the management of the home, and questions of state and city sanitation vital to the health of the individual family. The volume treats specifically of foods, their production, sanitation, cost, nutritive value, preparation, and serving, these topics being closely interwoven with the practical aspects of household management, and they are followed by a study of the household budget and accounts, methods of buying, house- wifery, and laundering. It includes about 160 carefully se- lected and tested recipes, together with a large number of cooking exercises of a more experimental nature designed to develop initiative and resourcefulness. Shelter and Clothing deals with the organization and ideals of the home, house sani- tation, decoration, and furnishing; and treats in full, textiles, sewing, costume design, and dressmaking. Some of the recipes here given are adapted from those of such authorities as Mrs. Lincoln, Miss Farmer, and Miss Bar- rows, and others are original and from private sources. Ihe authors are glad to acknowledge their indebtedness to those who have read and criticized the manuscript: Professor

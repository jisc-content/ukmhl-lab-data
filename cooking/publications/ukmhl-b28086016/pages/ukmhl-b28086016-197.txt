MUFFINS, BISCUIT, CAKE, AND PASTRY 175 A loaf should be baked at a lower temperature than a biscuit or muffin. Why? For loaves, 380° F. Test by the hand, counting fifteen slowly, fifteen seconds. A piece of white paper will become a delicate brown in five minutes. For biscuits, muffins, and small cakes, 425° to 450° F. —- Test by the hand, a count of ten. A piece of paper becomes a deeper golden brown in five minutes. Any mixture containing baking powder may stand some little time before it is put in the oven, provided it is kept cold. The action of the baking powder is not immediate, and is very slight at a low temperature. The stages of the baking are first, the rising; second, the crusting over; third, the baking of the interior; and last, a shrinkage of the whole. Many ovens bake unevenly, and pans must be shifted. This should be done with care and not before the third stage of the baking. It is often well to cool off the oven the latter part of the time. An oven that is too hot may be cooled by a pan of water. Paper may be laid over the top of the cake if the browning has been too rapid. These are all make- shifts, and indicate a poor oven, or poor management of the fire. Do not look into the oven for the first ten minutes of baking, and always close the oven door gently. When we are privileged to have electric ovens, with glass doors, and an accurate thermometer, baking will be an easy and accurate process. EXPERIMENTS AND RECIPES A.

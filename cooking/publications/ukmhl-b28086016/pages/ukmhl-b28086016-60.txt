38 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT summer. With the new blue flame stoves it gives an intense heat, easily regulated. There is no heavy labor involved in its use, but even the best stove requires constant care and watchfulness. It is not so clean and easy to use as gas. The kerosene supply should be kept in a cool place, and stoves and lamps should never be filled by candle or lamplight. Gasolene is used as a fuel for cooking in some places, but in others the fire insurance companies have such strict rules in regard to it that its use is practically prohibited. It is more volatile than kerosene, and its flashing point is very low. Kerosene is much safer for household use. Alcohol is used with the chafing dish. Denatured alcohol is so cheap in Germany that it is used in large and especially adapted stoves for cooking purposes. There are denatured alcohol stoves on the market here, but they are little used. Charcoal, wood partially burnt out, is little used for do- mestic purposes now. The relative value of the common fuels is stated in quan- tities as follows, but this is of course dependent on the quality of the coal and the gas. One thousand feet of gas about equals from fifty to sixty pounds of coal, or four and one half gallons of kerosene; and one half ton of coal approximates a cord of wood. Those who may be interested will find a fuller discussion of fuels and fuel values in Snell’s “ Elementary Household Chemistry.” Electricity is not a fuel, but is classed here as a source of heat. It may be supplied for cooking purposes by any com- pany that furnishes electric light, and should be available in the country wherever an electric trolley runs. The energy supplied is measured and paid for by the kilowatt; that is, one thousand watts. The terms used for electrical measure- ments cannot be really understood until one has studied

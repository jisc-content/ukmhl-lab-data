91 FRUIT AND ITS PRESERVATION be taken by little children and invalids who might find the fiber troublesome. Some people cannot eat berries on ac- count of irritation caused by the seeds. In this case, juice may be squeezed from cooked berries and used for beverages and jelly. How to buy. — Since we should eat fruit daily, and not merely as a “ treat,” it is important to practice economy in buying it. Fresh fruits in season, and dried fruits are the cheapest. Canned fruit is economical when it is a product of one’s own garden, or put up when some fruit has a low market price. Prices are so variable, even with one variety, that no definite sum can be given as a fixed price. Apples vary from fifty cents a bushel near the orchard and in season, to ten cents apiece for a fancy table variety in the winter. When you buy fresh fruit, inquire the prices of the many kinds offered, note which is cheapest, and then observe whether the cheaper kind is such because it is abundant, or because it is of inferior quality. If you chance to want apples for cook- ing, and the only cheap apples are spotted and bruised, then buy dried apples, or even canned. It is best to decide upon the fruit after you have studied market conditions rather than before. GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES Fresh Fruits Principles of preparation. Thorough cleansing in clear water.

MENUS AND DIETARIES 299 which will help to get the exact amount of heat given off from the body is employed. Just as it takes more fuel to run a big machine than a little one, so it takes more energy for a large person than a small one; therefore we must know the weight of the one whose food requirements we wish to calculate, as well as the amount of energy required to do different kinds and amounts of work. The following table will help in* calculating the approximate fuel requirements of any grown person. The food needs of children and young people under twenty-five -will be discussed later. Approximate Energy Requirements of Average-sized Man Occupation Calories per pound per hour Sleeping 0-4 Sitting quietly . 0-6 At light muscular exercise 1-0 At active muscular exercise 2.0 At severe muscular exercise 3.0 Light exercise may be understood to include work equiv- alent to standing and working with the hands, as at a desk in chemistry or cookery; or work involving the feet like walk- ing or running a sewing machine. Many persons, as stu- dents, stenographers, seamstresses, bookkeepers, teachers, and tailors do little or no work heavier than this. Active exercise involves more muscles, as in bicycling- compared -with walking, or exercise with dumb-bells as com- pared with typewriting. Carpenters, general houseworkers, and mail carriers do about this grade of work while on duty. Severe exercise not only involves a good many muscles, but causes enough strain to harden and enlarge them. Bicy- cling up grade, swimming, and other active sports would be included in this land of exercise. Lumbermen, excavators, and a few others do even heavier work than this.

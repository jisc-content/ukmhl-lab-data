79 WATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES country has different varieties and grades. Russian tea is not grown in Russia, but is Chinese tea carried across the continent of Asia. In general, tea may be classed as green or black, this difference in color depending upon the age of the leaf, and largely upon differences in the curing process. Green tea is made from the young leaf, and after picking is dried im- mediately by artificial heat, being constantly stirred for about an hour, in which time the leaves twist and curl. For black tea the leaves are allowed to wilt and ferment, before they are rolled and heated; and sometimes the heating is repeated. These details of the process vary in different localities. The leaves are finally sorted and graded for packing. Both black and green teas are made in China. “ Bohea ” is one of the famous black Chinese teas. “ English Breakfast Tea ” is known as such only in America, and is a blend of black teas. Black-tea is not so successfully made in Japan as in China. “ Oolong,” from the island of Formosa, has the appearance of a black tea, with the flavor of a green. In Japan and China old-time methods prevail, with much handling of the tea leaves, but in Ceylon and India modern machinery makes the process a much more cleanly one. Another classification of tea is that depending upon the age and size of the leaf, the young leaf making the finer grade tea. For example, in the black teas of India “ flowery pekoe ” is made from the youngest leaf, “ orange pekoe ” from the second, “ pekoe ” from the third, and “ souchong ” and “ congou ” come from the larger leaves. The adulterations of tea are usually the leaves of other plants, but as a matter of fact very little adulterated tea is imported. The first grades of teas, however, and those most highly prized by the Chinese and Japanese, seldom find their way to America.

328 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT Savings. Something should be saved yearly even if at first it is but little. Small amounts put away regularly in a savings bank mount up to a considerable sum at compound interest, for regular saving is the only kind that counts. Life and sickness insurance are other forms of saving. Allowances. — Each member of the family should have a personal allowance, even though it is small. One mother gave each of her children five cents a week, beginning at five years of age, and increasing a cent a week each year, until they were old enough to be trusted with more. Even at this age opposite characteristics showed themselves. One boy saved his allowance until he had a quarter to spend at one time; another was in debt before the end of the week. Each had a bank, and kept accounts, as well. It is sometimes better for a child if he “ earns ” his allowances by performance of such household duties as seem best adapted to promote his development. Suggested and typical budgets. — In preparation for the division of one’s income it is helpful to study the budgets of other families or individuals. Mrs. Richards in her book on “ The Cost of Living ” gives a theoretical division of in- comes, which is shown in the accompanying table headed Suggested Budgets. It is interesting to study this account and then those of families who have worked out their prob- lems (either with or without the preparation of definite budgets in advance) as shown in the table of Typical Budgets. In New York City it has been estimated by those studying the problems of the cost of living of to-day that it is im- possible for the average family of mother, father, and three children under 14 years to get food enough to keep the body in good condition with clothing and shelter to meet the most urgent demands of decency for less than S900.

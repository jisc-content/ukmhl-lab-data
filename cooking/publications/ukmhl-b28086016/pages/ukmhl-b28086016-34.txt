12 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT / contain inedible matter, as in the shells of eggs, the bone of meat, the skins and pods of vegetables. Moreover, the fiber that we eat in vegetable foods is not digested under ordinary circumstances, but seems rather to serve a useful purpose in giving bulk to our foods. Food adjuncts. — In preparing foods for the table, we have the habit of adding substances to develop or give flavor. With the exception of sugar, which we use largely for its agreeable taste, these substances have no nutritive value. They are not hurtful unless used in excess, although pepper and other spices sometimes disturb digestion. Pepper, too, irritates a delicate throat. Only a few flavors are really detected by the sense of taste. These are salt, sugar, acids; and something in the spices that gives a sensation hard to describe, but is unmis- takable in an overdose of mustard or horse-radish. “ Pun- gent ” is the descriptive word for such a flavor. The other flavors are really odors, and are detected by the sense of smell. Have you not at some time seemed to lose the sense of taste when suffering from a severe cold in the head? Yet even then you could taste sugar, salt, vinegar, and feel the pungency of pepper. These other flavors or odors are due to a volatile oil in the flavoring material, that is, an oil that readily evaporates, especially when heated, as distinguished from the non-volatile oils and fats like olive oil and butter. This is a practical bit of knowl- edge in our cookery, for .whatever passes off as fragrance during the cooking process, is lost as flavor. For instance, to cook vanilla essence in a soft custard is equivalent to throwing most of it away. Salt. — A mineral substance that develops other flavors. It should not be used in excess. A small amount is desirable even in sweet dishes.

194 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT but a combination of winter and spring wheat in flour is considered the best for bread by some authorities. We must learn to like a creamy color in bread, for this means the presence of more gluten. To summarize : a good bread flour contains a large percentage of gluten, is creamy in color, and granular to the touch. Manufacture of flour. — Modern machinery has taken the place of the old-time stones in the grinding of flour, although the two main divisions of the process remain the same, these being the crushing of the grain and the sifting out of the coarse portion. Milling now includes many stages in the process not possible with the cruder ma- chinery of former times, and the present effects a greater number of separations and permits the miller to make a greater variety of products. Figure 53 shows a dissected kernel of wheat, with its five layers of bran. Within these at B is a shell of glutinous matter, yellowish and of flinty hardness, and within this, but not sharply divided from it, lie the starch granules in a network of woody fiber, the germ lying at A. The milling process must remove the bran coats and the germ, and crush and roll the remain- ing portions to the necessary fineness. The germ if allowed to remain affects the color and keeping properties. The breaking and rolling are accomplished by steel machinery, and the final sifting is done through silk bolting cloth.

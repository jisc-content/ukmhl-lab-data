75 WATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES The rapid evaporation of water will absorb heat so rapidly as to reduce the temperature of adjacent bodies. In the tropics when ice is lacking, water is hung in porous jars in the breeze, and the temperature of the water in the jar is reduced. To keep milk and butter cool wrap a wet cloth about the containing jar, and set the jar upon the window sill, keeping one end of the towel in a vessel of water; or the cloth may be wrapped directly around the butter. This method is surprisingly effective. Fruit beverages. — Fruit juices with water and sugar make refreshing beverages and have nutritive value as well. (See the next chapter.) Cocoa and chocolate, coffee, and tea. — These are the three most important non-alcoholic beverages used by man. They are used because of the agreeable flavor given them by volatile oils, and also because they have a stimulating effect. The stimulating property is due to an alkaloid, a crystalliz- able substance known in cocoa as theobromine, in coffee as caffeine, and in tea as theine. Chemical investigation in- dicates that caffeine and theine are the same and theobromine is a closely related substance. These substances have a recog- nized stimulating effect upon the nervous system, and the beverages containing them should therefore be used with caution by all. In the opinion of the writers, tea and coffee should not be taken by young people under twenty-five years of age. Tea and coffee also contain tannin, an astringent substance giving a disagreeable flavor to coffee and tea when these are improperly made, and having an undesirable effect upon digestion. Chocolate contains a non-volatile fat (cocoa butter) in large amount, and should be classed as a food as well as a beverage. The plants from which cocoa, coffee, and tea are derived are natives of semi-tropical or tropical Africa, Asia, and

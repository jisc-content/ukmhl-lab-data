142 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT the conclusions of the scientist and frankly admit that the differences of temperature in cooking of egg do not have any great effect upon its digestibility. Why then the popular idea that a hard-boiled egg is “ ab- solutely indigestible ” ? A hard boiled egg, or more than one, eaten rapidly, without mastication, at a picnic, and with much sweet food at an unusual hour, may interfere with the “ ease and comfort in digestion ” resulting from such a meal.

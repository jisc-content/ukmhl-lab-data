154 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT Matzoon and other similar preparations are essentially soured milks, prepared under controlled conditions. These preparations are the common form of milk in certain parts of the Orient, where milk is never used sweet. Kumyss is milk slightly soured and fermented with one species of yeast. This is a Russian method. These prep- arations are excellent for invalids and exhausted people, for they can sometimes be assimilated because of the fine curds when sweet milk cannot. Condensed milk is a practical method of preserving milk. The milk is evaporated under pressure at a high temperature in apparatus constructed for the purpose. Cane sugar or glucose is sometimes added. A new patent process con- denses the milk at low temperature, preserving it for a short period, as compared with the condensed milk in tins, but it keeps well for several days, and bears transportation. Con- densed milk may be used in cooking, when clean fresh milk is not available. The unsweetened kinds are most useful, but, like pasteurized milk, must be treated with care after the cans are opened. Cheese. — Cheese is made from the curd of milk, and con- tains the most nutritive parts of the milk in highly con- centrated form. In the process of manufacture, the milk is first curdled by rennet, and the whey strained out. The curds after preliminary treatment, varying according to the style of cheese to be made, are finally pressed together very slowly in a cheese press, which is screwed down more tightly as the cheese becomes dryer. The cheeses are then covered with cheesecloth and “ ripened ” slowly, the ripening process giving characteristic consistency and flavor. This ripening is due to the action of bacteria and molds. (See page 97.) Foreign varieties of cheese, made originally in some one lo- cality, have marked colors, quality, and flavors, as Brie,

Other forms of flour. — There has been much discussion of entire wheat flour versus white flour, and the practical conclusions are as follows: the bread from whole wheat flour compares favorably with that from white flour (see Fig. 51), but this material is slightly less available for digestion than the material of the white flour. The mineral content is higher, and when the income is so limited that this cannot be furnished in milk, green vegetables, and fruit, whole wheat bread should be used. It makes a pleasing variety, too, for any table. Graham flour is a coarse flour, containing the outer bran It is useful for its effect upon the intestines in case of con- stipation, but has to be avoided by some people on account of its irritating effect. White flour may have coarser mate- rial mixed with it, for variety in bread making, such as rye or Indian meal, or graham flour. Yeast in bread. — Yeast is put into bread dough in order to produce carbon dioxide gas to lighten the whole mass. It is studied in the chapter on preservation of fruit, but in bread making we need to foster its growth instead of destroy- ing it as, you will recall, we found necessary in preserving. You can easily reason out for yourself just how this should be done, especially after performing the experiments with yeast. If yeast is in good condition, it has little effect on the flavor of bread, even if used in a rather large quantity to hasten the process. The best forms of yeast now in use are the compressed and dried cakes, the former needing to be fresh, the latter

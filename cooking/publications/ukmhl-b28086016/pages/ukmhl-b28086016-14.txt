Vlll SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS menus and dietaries. An occasional lesson on housewifery or laundering may be introduced from time to time, if a complete sequence of lessons on these topics does not seem practicable; and through the year the pupils may be encouraged' to keep simple accounts for themselves and in connection with the supplies of the school kitchen. Those teachers are fortunate who may cooperate with a school lunch room, thus affording their pupils opportunity for dealing with practical administra- tive and economic problems. The way in which the topics are used must of necessity vary with the previous experience of the pupils, whether or not they have had cookery, chemistry, and physiology, and the teacher will use the exercises at the end of the chapters with freedom, omitting some questions, and adding others as the need arises.

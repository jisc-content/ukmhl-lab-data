55 FOOD PREPARATION eggs, milk, old beans and peas coagulate, or become slightly harder or firmer at a temperature below the boiling point of water. We shall perform an experiment to show this while studying the egg. There is no marked chemical change; that is, the protein is not changed to another substance. Fats. — Solid fats are liquefied by heat, and freed from the tissue that contains them in animal fats like suet. When a fat begins to smoke with heat, a chemical change is taking place. If intense heat is continued, all the hydrogen and oxygen are driven off and pure carbon remains. When the fat is “ brown,” giving the flavor we like, a part of the oxygen and hydrogen have been driven off. The “ boiling ” of fat in a kettle is ordinarily due to the boiling of the water contained in the fat. Starch. — Starch occurs in the form of granules. See Fig. 39. In boiling water, the granule expands and finally bursts, and frees the content, the pure starch, and the whole mass thickens. Boiled with an acid the starch is changed to dextrin, a sub- stance resembling a gum, and the mixture becomes thin; and this process continued changes the dextrin to dextrose. With intense “ dry ” heat, as in toasting, the granule expands and opens, and the contents change to dextrin. Continued heat reduces the starch to pure carbon. The brown color and pleasant flavor in toast are a stage on the road to carbon. Sugar. — Sugar first melts with heat, then begins to de- compose, giving off water. This is also a stage on the road to pure carbon. Caramel, a familiar flavor, is sugar in the brown stage, with the water partly driven off. The art in applying intense heat to fat, starch, and sugar is to know the stopping point, — to reach the “ brown taste ” and stop short of the “ burnt taste.”

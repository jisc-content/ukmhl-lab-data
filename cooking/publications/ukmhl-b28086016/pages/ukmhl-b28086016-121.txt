FRUIT AND ITS PRESERVATION 99 a soft dough being left in a warm place to ferment naturally, the yeast cells probably being present in the flour. The yeast that spoils the canned fruit is present in the fruit, in the utensils, or can, and has not been killed as it should be in the canning process. The bacteria are also one-cellecl microorganisms, smaller than the yeast. Figure 31 shows the four types of bacterial cells. Their size is measured by the unit used in the Buchanan's Household Bacteriology. Fig. 31. â€” The four types of bacterial cells. A, cocci. B, bacilli. C, spirilla. D, branched filamentous organism. microscope, called the micron, which is about of one inch. Bacteria may measure from one to three or four of these microns in length. Some bacteria are reproduced by means of spores which form within the cell. Bacteria, as they develop in some material, produce substances from the material that may or may not be injurious to us. One im- portant truth about the bacteria is this : that many of them are harmless, and may even be made useful, as in the manufacture of fruit vinegar. The pleasant acid of butter- milk and of sour milk is due also to bacteria which are not harmful to us. However, there may be disease pro- ducing bacteria present in milk that is not clean, and their presence must not be tolerated. Other bacteria, de-

MENUS AND DIETARIES 311 In selecting food to satisfy these requirements it is a good plan to make first a list of those foods that need to be in- cluded in the day's dietary, no matter what the particular menu may be. This will include foods for growth where there are children, special dishes needed if any one is sick, and those common foods which we are accustomed to include in every day’s menu, such as bread and butter. For the family which we are considering, this list will stand somewhat as follows: Food 100-Calorie Portions Milk 20 1 (6 for each child, the rest for the adults) Cereal 5 Eggs (for children) 2 (counting f portion per egg) Fruit 5 Green vegetable 2 Meat or meat substitute .... 5 Bread 15 Butter 15 This list is to be kept in planning the menu, whose char- acter is further determined by certain dishes which we wish particularly to have included. For instance, we may desire roast beef for dinner. This is a highly flavored meat, and a protein food which will go a long way towards satisfying the adult’s protein needs. Special protein food for breakfast may well be omitted, or take the form of eggs, which are a contrast to the meat in flavor, form, etc. Protein food for luncheon might be fish or some other meat substitute. Vegetables for dinner should not only harmonize with the meat, but contrast pleasingly with each other. This result is insured by choosing one vegetable from the starchy type, as potatoes or sweet potatoes, and the other vegetable of the green or succulent group, as spinach or asparagus. Below are two menus, in which have been kept in mind the 1 One quart of milk yields 6| portions.

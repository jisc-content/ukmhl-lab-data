52 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT necessary. There are no waste products, and no matches to light or throw away. If the wiring is properly done, there is no danger from fire. The one present disadvantage is the cost. Each piece of apparatus is expensive. The cost of running must depend upon the cost of electricity in the neigh- borhood, and the number of watts per hour used by each piece of apparatus. The larger the utensil, the more watts consumed. The disk stove in Fig. 22 uses 250 watts; a disk of 6 inches diame- ter, 475 watts; of 8 inches, 650 watts. Some pieces of ap- paratus are ar- ranged for three different heats, with a different number of watts for each heat. With one disk stove 10 inches in diameter, 3 heats are possible, with 250, 500, and 1000 watts respectively. Oven thermometers. — A thermometer is furnished set in the door of many ranges. While these are guides after one has learned to use the oven, they are not really accurate by scale. For exact work in testing oven temperature, a hole must be bored in the side of the oven, and a chemical thermometer inserted, protected by asbestos and metal. Simple tests for oven temperature will be found in Chapter XI. EXERCISES 1. Why is the question of the cost and kind of fuel important? 2. What is the difference between hard and soft coal?

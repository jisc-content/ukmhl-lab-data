Chemistry and its Relations to Daily Life By LOUIS KAHLENBERG and EDWIN B. HART Professors of Chemistry in the University of Wisconsin Cloth, i2vio, illustrated, 393 pages. List price, Si.2 5 If the contributions of chemical science to modern civilization were suddenly swept away, what a blank there would be 1 If, on the other hand, every person were acquainted with the elements of chemistry and its bearing upon our daily life, what an uplift human efficiency would receive ! It is to further this latter end that this book has been prepared. Designed particularly for use by students of agriculture and home economics in secondary schools, its use will do much to increase the efficiency of the farm and the home. In the language of modern educational philosophy, it “functions in the life of the pupil.” Useful facts rather than mere theory have been emphasized, although the theory has not been neglected. The practical char- acter of the work is indicated by the following selected chapter headings : II. The Composition and Uses of Water. IV. The Air, Nitrogen, Nitric Acid, and Ammonia. IX. Carbon and Its Compounds. XII. Paints, Oils, and Varnishes. XIII. Leather, Silk, Wool, Cotton, and Rubber. XV. Commercial Fertilizers. XVI. Farm Manure. XX. Milk and Its Products. XXI. Poisons for Farm and Orchard Pests. THE BOSTON CHICAGO MACMILLAN COMPANY 6.4-66 FIFTH AVENUE NEW YORK CITY DALLAS ATLANTA SAN FRANCISCO

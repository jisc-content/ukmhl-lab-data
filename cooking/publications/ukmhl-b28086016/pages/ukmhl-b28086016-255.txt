fish, shellfish, and meat substitutes 233 an effect on the quality and taste. The chequit, for instance, is so sluggish and easy to catch that it is sometimes called “ lazy ” or “ weakfish,” and it is watery and poor flavored compared with the shad, a fish of more vigorous habits. The amount of fat also causes a difference in flavor, such high flavored fish as salmon and shad containing much fat. The distinctive flavors of mackerel and herring are apparently not due to fat, since their fat content is not particularly high. Among the most common and best liked fish are bass, black- fish, bluefish, cod, flounder, haddock, halibut, herring, mackerel, porgy (sometimes called scup or scuppaug), salmon, shad, smelt, weakfish, whitefish. Brook trout and salmon trout are luxuries. Composition and nutritive value. — Figure 65 shows the composition of several kinds. Compare their composition with that of meat. The nutritive content is high, yet fish seems a lighter and less satisfying food than meat, although on the seaboard of some countries it is the chief animal food. The digestibility of fish and meat are about equal, but some varieties of fish are less digestible than others, this being true of the oily and strong-flavored fish, —-herring, mackerel, salmon, and shad. There are popular prejudices for and against fish that are not warranted. The idea that fish is a “ brain food ” be- cause it contains phosphorus was exploded long since, for fish contains no more phosphorus than some other foods, and phosphorus is no more valuable to the brain than to the other tissues. Fish, however, is valuable in the dietary for supplying protein and giving variety, and in season, it is one of the cheaper foods. Quality of fish. — Fish deteriorates and decomposes much more rapidly than meat, and is at its best when cleaned and

146 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT A method easier for the novice is to accomplish the first stage in a bowl set into a teakettle, beating into the mass as it thickens a teaspoonful of butter, or a tablespoonful of cream. When the mixture is evenly creamy, turn it into the hot buttered pan and proceed as with (1). (2) Light omelet. — This is not a true omelet, but in reality a souffle cooked in a frying pan. It is somewhat insipid in flavor and is not easier to make well than the French omelet. As commonly served it is apt to be underdone or tough. With the light omelet, the eggs and whites are separated and the whites beaten until light and dry. Beat the yolks until creamy, adding water and salt as in (1). Pour this mixture over the white, and cut and fold the mass. See page 63. Pour this into a buttered baking dish and set in a moderate oven. The oven should not be more than 300° F. Serve in the pan. When gas is used, the souffle may be set in the oven with the flame low, and browned for a moment under the flame turned high. Both of these omelets may be varied by the addition of chopped parsley or chopped ham, or grated cheese. Laboratory management. When the price of eggs is high, some of the experiments can be demonstrated by the teacher. Eggs should be used when the price is at its lowest, even if this interferes with the logical se- quence of lessons. Milk and Milk Products Milk is the natural food of the young mammal, and con- tains all the foodstuffs in a form easily assimilable. Starch is not present, the carbohydrate being found in the form of lactose, or milk sugar, a sugar differing somewhat from the sugars found in vegetables and fruit (see Chapter X). Whole milk and the milk products, cream, butter, and cheese, are all important food materials among the nations of the western world ; and the manufacture of milk products, such as condensed milk, butter, and cheese, has developed

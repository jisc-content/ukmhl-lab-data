FOOD MATERIALS AND FOODSTUFFS 7 also, appropriate as food. The composition of both the milk and the beans is given in this table. Compare also Figures 35 and 41.

The water that the young plant needs is, of course, supplied from the earth. There is another difference to note although this is not shown in the table; in the beans the carbohydrate is of two kinds, sugar and starch.

48 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT The gas burner (Fig. 20) is constructed on the principle of the Bunsen burner, which you may have used in the labora- tory. There is an opening in the pipe, near the stopcock, which admits the air, that it may mix with the gas, and give the blue flame. If there is not enough air, the flame burns with a yellow color, and smokes. If there is too much air, there is a roaring sound, and the flame “ pulls back ” and burns with a smoky yellow flame, and disagreeable odor. There is a valve always to reg- ulate the air supply for each burner. Figure 20 shows a burner removed from the range. (1) is the hollow, star-shaped chamber which gives space for the thorough mixing of the gas with the air. The gas enters from the connecting pipe at (2) , the air at (3), and (4) is the valve for regulating the air supply. Gas ranges of this type are built in different sizes, and with varying arrangements of ovens and hot-closets. An oven above the stove is convenient. Ranges are built also for using either gas or coal. A range of the size pictured, with four large burners on the top, will serve for a family of five or six, if the work is well planned. The oven burner consumes 30 to 40 cubic feet per hour, the top burners 2 cubic feet each, and the simmering burner somewhat less. This is estimated for a burner turned on full. To manage a gas stove. — Before lighting the top or oven burners see that the stopcocks are all tight, with no escaping gas. To light the top burners, strike the match, turn on the stopcock, and touch the match to the gas when it is flowing well. A disagreeable Courtesy of Detroit Stove Works. Fig. 20. — A gas stove burner.

Eggs. — Hard-boiled eggs are used as a garnish. Cream cheese.—May be served with lettuce. Salad dressings. — Plain lettuce or celery served with salt is in a sense a salad, but it is our custom to dress the lettuce with a mixture which contains an acid and usually an oil. A very simple, old-fashioned form of dressing used in this country is vinegar and sugar. Substitute lemon juice or fresh lime juice for the vinegar and you will have a very refreshing and simple salad for a summer day. The ordinary dressing consists of vinegar or lemon juice, and oil; another form is mayonnaise, where the yolk and sometimes the white of egg are used to hold the oil and vine- gar together. Another form is a cooked dressing which may be bottled and kept for a longer time than the French dressing or the mayonnaise. Olive oil. — This is the most delicious oil for salad dressing when the flavor is liked and when it can be afforded. Cottonseed and corn oil. — There are now in the market clarified cottonseed oil and corn oil that may be used in mayonnaise dress- ing, and the flavor is not unacceptable, and certainly superior to the poorer grades of olive oil which quite likely contain one of these oils as an adulterant. Cottonseed oil makes a better substi- tute for olive oil then does corn oil as it is at present refined.

FISH, SHELLFISH, AND MEAT SUBSTITUTES 239 long, and in Rhode Island the hard round clam still bears the Indian name Quahaug, the soft shell clam being the only “ clam.” The long clam lies buried in the soft mud of creeks and muddy shores left exposed at low tide, when they are dug by hoes from the mud. The round clam lies on the bottom of shallow warm waters, and is raked with an implement made for the purpose. The round clam is used when very young and small in place of raw oysters; but both kinds when matured have a tough portion that is not softened in cooking, and that is more or less indigestible. The long “ neck ” which protrudes from the shell has to be discarded. Both kinds may be roasted in the shell, and are very palat- able served hot with melted butter, salt, and pepper.

The escallop, or scallop, is migratory, mov- ing by a shooting motion, the mature scallops reaching the creeks and shores in the autumn, and though found in so- called beds they are not fixtures like the oysters. The flavor is sweet, and they have a quality that makes them more or less indigestible, especially when fried. They are very palatable and more digestible served in a stew made like an oyster stew. They are sold by the measure and are cheap in season. The lobster is now a luxury, for methods of catching in the past have made them scarce in their old haunts. The lobster is a much more highly developed animal than the mollusk, having strong muscles inside its coat of mail, and the flesh has a protein content that compares very favorably with

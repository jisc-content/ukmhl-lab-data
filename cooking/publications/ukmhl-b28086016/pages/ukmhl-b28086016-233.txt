Lamb is pink, rather than red, and slightly less firm. Pork is rather pale, somewhat less firm than beef and mutton, and the fat is softer. Tough and tender meat.—To understand the difference between the tough and tender cuts we must be familiar with the structure of the muscle (see Fig. 57). Each muscle consists of bundles of tubes held together by connective tissue. In tough meat, the muscle tubes are thicker and there is more connective tissue present. Exercise strength- ens the muscle, and this accounts for the fact that the unexercised muscles of the young animal give us a softer meat. In the mature animal the muscles most exercised furnish the tough meat, and the less used muscles the tender. If you study Fig. 58, you can easily £0rnu“ determine where the tough meat "■ wingrib’ will occur, if you think of the proportionate amount of exercise that the different muscles receive.

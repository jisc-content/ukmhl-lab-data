Molasses 1 cup Boiling water 1 cup Flour 21 cups Soda 1 teaspoonful Ginger 11 teaspoonfuls Salt 1 teaspoonful Butter 4 tablespoonfuls Method. — Melt butter in boiling water. Mix dry ingredients. Add the molasses to the water and butter and stir this mix- ture into the dry ingredients, beating vigorously. Pour into a buttered shallow pan and bake twenty minutes in a moderate oven. If the molasses is taken from a freshly opened can, no acid will be present and the soda should be omitted and 3 tea- spoonfuls of baking powder used instead. Pastry. — Pastry is a stiff dough with a large proportion of shortening, and is flaky when baked rather than porous. Pastry and pies should not be used as a staple food, but when well made and properly masticated, pies may be eaten oc- casionally by people in good health. The crust should be flaky, and thoroughly baked. Laboratory management. — Effective work in batters cannot be accom- plished with less than \ cup liquid, though a smaller portion is sometimes used. It is well to have some group work, so that the pupils may learn to beat larger quantities. If there is a school lunch room, large quantities may be utilized there.

the cost and purchasing of food 285 the accuracy of his weighing. It is also important to inspect fruit and vegetables for quality and cost. Quantities in which to purchase food.—The amount that one purchases of a certain food depends on its keeping quali- ties, and upon the storage space available at home. A gen- eral rule may be stated: Buy perishable foods in small quantities; non-perishable foods in large. The reason for buying in larger quantity is that the cost is somewhat less, although sometimes it seems but little less. Some one has remarked that no one is a good buyer who does not consider a quarter of a cent. In a modern house or apartment where there is not room for a barrel of flour or sugar, then the quantity must be gauged by the space. The same is true of canned goods as of flour and sugar. Buying by the dozen saves a little on each can if you have shelf room for piling the cans. Foods may be classed in this connection as perishable, semi-perishable, and non-perishable. This depends some- what for any one housekeeper upon the size of her refrigera- tor, and upon an available place where food may be cool, even’ if not so cold as in the refrigerator. Those foods classed here as perishable are those which readily “ spoil,” that is, those that are affected by mold and bacteria on ac- count of the moisture that they contain, and also those that lose flavor and freshness quickly. Those most easily affected should be kept the coldest; those in the semi-perishable group do not deteriorate so rapidly, although a low tem- perature is desirable with all of these. Under the non-perish- able foods are classed those that are not subject to bacteria or mold in ordinary circumstances. These should be kept dry, however, and never in a heated place. In a sense, no food material is non-perishable. Insects sometimes develop in the cereal products, for instance, and the material is thus

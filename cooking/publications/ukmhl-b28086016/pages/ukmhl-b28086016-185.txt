163 THE FATS AND THE SUGARS or give one to each person on a butter plate, just at the last moment before serving the meal. Never serve soft butter. 3. To cook bacon. — Bacon has alternate layers of fat and lean, but it is the fat that has chief consideration in the cook- ing process. The aim is to brown and crisp the fat without burning it and without causing a volume of smoke in the kitchen. Make ready a frying pan, and have at hand a jar for holding fat standing on a plate. Cut the bacon in thin slices with a sharp knife. Heat the pan, and put in the bacon. The fat wall begin to “ try out ” at the melting point. Pour this melted fat into the jar. Turn the pieces of bacon with a fork. If the smoke is rising in volumes the pan is too hot. The novice should not try this experiment for the first time by her- self. The fat may even burst into flame if the pan is too hot. When the bacon is sufficiently cooked to become crisp on cool- ing, it is ready to serve, by itself, with toast, or with eggs. The making of sauces and gravies. — Many sauces and gravies are made from a fat, mixed with a starchy substance, the two mingled with a liquid. The fat gives flavor and nutriment, the starch is used for thickening, the liquid also gives flavor. You are now familiar with the cooking of fat and starch, and can readily understand that the combination of all these ingredients is not an easy matter. The fat will float upon the top of the liquid unless the right amount of starch or flour is used, and the flour will have a tendency to lump. There are several good methods in use. The method given for your experiment is one of the simplest, because it uses onlj a few utensils, and gives uniformly good results. It requires no more watchfulness than the other methods. These sauces and gravies are not foods for little children and invalids. 4. Foundation recipe for sauces. Proportions.

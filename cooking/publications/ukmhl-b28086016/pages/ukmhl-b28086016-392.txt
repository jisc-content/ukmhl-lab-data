370 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT Some women who do their own work even fold sheets and pillow cases without ironing. The smoothing of the fabric is accomplished by heated irons, or by pressing between rollers in a mangle. To summarize. — The essential steps in laundering are: the forcing of clear water through the fabric ; loosening of the soil and stains by soap and appropriate chemicals, sterili- zation by boiling temperature, drying and sweetening in the air if possible. The less essential are bluing, starching, and in some cases ironing. Laundry equipment. — We are beginning to realize that a separate room for laundering purposes is an essential in a well-equipped home. Such a laundry will be light and well ventilated, will have washable floors, walls, and ceilings, running water and hot water supply, sanitary tubs and con- veniences in the shape of machinery. We shall not have perfect laundries until electric power is available at a fair price. Much is said about electricity on the farm, and the progressive farmer who has his own engine should not fail to use the power for all laundry work. Trolley power should be available, and this use of electricity should be made co- operative when practicable. In a few communities abroad and at home, the power available in a creamery is used for laundering purposes as well. Where there cannot be a separate laundry, take pains to have the equipment as good as space will allow. The tubs. — If possible, have three tubs, for this makes for econ- omy of time. Enameled tubs are the most sanitary, and be sure that they are white. You cannot tell whether or not the clothes are clean and blued to the proper tint in a buff-tinted tub, which you may be tempted to buy because it is cheaper. Round portable tubs, to be set upon a bench, should be of gal- vanized iron, which is sanitary and light. Wooden tubs are things of the past, unsanitary and heavy.

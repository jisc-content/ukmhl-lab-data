96 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT Other dried fruits may be treated in the same way. Apricots and peaches yield delightful flavors when carefully prepared; and dried apples are also excellent. Preservation of Fruit and Other Foods The preservation of fruit and other foods has been a house- hold industry for generations, and it is now an important commercial industry. The old-time farm had its smoke- house where hams and beef were “ cured,” the barrel of brine stood in the cellar for pork and corned beef, apples and corn were dried for winter use, and rows of preserve jars stood upon the shelves. Food was preserved by simple processes long before the reason for the decay and spoiling of food was fully understood, but with larger knowledge and better appliances, we now preserve food more effectively and in quantities larger than were possible in former days. Fruit is the food material now most commonly preserved in the home kitchen. Vegetables need to be subjected to heat for a much longer time than fruit, and many people prefer to buy canned vegetables rather than to go to the trouble and expense of canning them at home. Where there is an oversupply of vegetables in the home garden, it is sometimes economy to can them, and this may be done if care is exercised. The cost of fuel and labor must be counted in, when studying the question of home preserving versus buying the canned product. Whatever the food material, and the process, the principles of preservation are the same for all. Why does food spoil ? -—- The decay and moldiness of fresh fruit are matters of common observation; and the housekeeper knows that mold is liable to cover the top of a jelly glass, and that a can of fruit will ferment at times, even to the point of bursting the can.

80 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT Other beverages. — Several very acceptable coffee sub- stitutes are on the market, made from roasted and ground grain, and they give an agreeable hot drink for breakfast when served with cream or milk. In some cases they seem to have a laxative effect, which is well for some people and not for others. A pleasant hot drink of the same nature may be made from the browned crusts of bread. The substitutes for tea are not usually satisfactory. The Indians of the western coast of the United States make a tea from a plant which they call “ Buona Yerba,” but for us it has a strong resemblance to the medicinal herb teas formerly used for curative purposes, such as sage, catnip, motherwort, and the like. GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES i. Lemonade and fruit drinks. Utensils. — Silver knife for paring and slicing, glass lemon squeezer, a grater, a strainer, and a saucepan. Avoid the use of tin and iron utensils. Materials. — Lemon or other fruits, sugar water. Proportions.:— One half lemon to a glass, or 2 or 3 to a quart of water. Other fruits “according to taste.” Experiment here, using the juice and pulp of any fruit, combining those that are very acid with those that lack acidity, — lemon and rasp- berry, for example. One third to § cup sugar to a quart. The proportion cannot be stated with exactness, for fruit varies in acidity, and the final result must always be tested by the taste. Method. Plain lemonade. — After deciding upon the proper amounts to be used, dissolve the sugar in a part of the water, brought to the boiling point. When cool, add the lemon juice and re- maining water, ice and serve. A small portion of grated rind may be added to the boiling water. Another method is to use lump sugar, rubbing the peel of the lemon upon each lump before dissolving. The general method is the same with other fruits, pulpy fruit and berries being mashed, the water added, and strained.

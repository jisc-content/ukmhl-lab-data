56 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT Mineral matter. — The “ ash ” remains for the most part unchanged by heat, but may be lost in the water in which vegetables and meat are cooked if the water is thrown away. Vegetable fiber is softened by heat and moisture, and the protein, starch, fat, and sugar are freed, making them avail- able for our digestion and nutrition. Meat fiber softens at a low temperature, that is, below the boiling point of water, with moisture; continued intense heat shrinks and hardens it. A tender steak fried with fat in a hot pan will soon resemble sole leather. The technique of food preparation. — From the moment the food materials enter the kitchen until the unusable portions are destroyed or carried away, there is a best way of working with them at each step, and the sum of these may be said to make a good technique. This technique will include cleanliness first and foremost, then skill in the use of tools, judgment in managing cooking apparatus and in ap- plying heat in cooking processes, and accuracy and rapidity of execution. It will also include or add to itself the aesthetic element, the fine art of flavoring, the dainty garnishing of a dish. Moreover, this technique is the method of putting into practice some basic, scientific principle. To illustrate: The 'principle that underlies toast-making is threefold, — Heat evaporates moisture throughout the slice of bread. Intense heat changes the content of the starch granules on the surface of the slice of bread to dextrin. Intense heat, long continued, will change first the surface starch, and then all, to carbon (charcoal). A good technique will secure the first two, and avoid the third and includes, — The selection of bread already partially dry. The cutting of bread into slices of uniform thickness. Regulating the source of heat.

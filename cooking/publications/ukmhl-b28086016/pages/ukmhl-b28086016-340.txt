318 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT choosing foods with regard to cost a table that shows which are cheap fuel and which dear, is a great help. Prices vary so much with place and season that it is difficult to make one which is very exact, and some rearrangement to suit any particular region may be necessary. The table on page 317 will, however, serve as a guide. Inspection of this table shows that if we can afford only one cent per 100 Calories for food, we must get a large share from Group I, and a few from Group II; if we wish to use foods in Group III, we shall have to do so sparingly, or offset them with some of the very cheapest in Group I, to keep the average as we wish it. When we plan an attractive menu and find it is too ex- pensive for us, we may often carryout our plan by substitut- ing cheaper foods of the same sort. Thus in the dietary on page 313 we may substitute as follows: Bananas for oranges. Top milk for cream. Oleomargarine for a part of the butter. Bean loaf with tomato sauce for creamed salmon and peas. Stewed apricots for pears. Rump roast instead of rib roast. Doing this, omitting the soup and crackers and the salad for dinner, and increasing bread and potatoes, flaked wheat, and other cheaper foods to prevent any deficiency in fuel, we can still prepare palatable and digestible meals with the right food values, and save perhaps 25 per cent on the total cost for the day. Feeding the sick. — When illness is serious enough for a physician to be consulted, he will give directions concerning the diet, and these should be scrupulously followed. If the case is so severe as to demand a trained nurse, she will have charge of the feeding, under the physician’s guidance.

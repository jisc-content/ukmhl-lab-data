MENUS AND DIETARIES 309 lates the appetite and helps to prevent or overcome constipa- tion. A mild-flavored food like cereal is better relished be- fore we have had meats or other highly flavored food. Soup at the beginning of a meal puts the stomach in better condi- tion to digest the food that follows. Ice cream at the end of a meal is less likely to chill the stomach than at the be- ginning. Bread and butter afford a good combination of fat and carbohydrate. Crackers help in the breaking up of cheese into particles easy to digest. Not all of our eating habits are good, however. Griddle- cakes, melted butter, and maple sirup taste good, but the cakes make a pasty mass difficult for digestive juices to pene- trate. The sirup is likely to ferment, and the butter coating the whole delays digestion greatly. Chicken salad is popu- lar, but combinations of protein with much fat (as in the mayonnaise dressing) always digest very slowly. Simple dishes, without rich sauces or gravies, and not excessively high in fat, are easiest of digestion. Pastries, fried foods, meats with much fat, like pork and sausage, are always more or less difficult and should be attempted only by the strong, or when the body is free from physical or nervous weariness, and not about to undertake mental work. Attention to the art of menu making not only helps to make the diet easier to digest, but also better balanced. Foods which are similar in color, flavor, and texture, like potatoes and rice, are not artistic in combination, and it is better to substitute for one of them a green vegetable, or meat or butter, in which case we get a better balance, as more ash, protein, or fat would then be included with the starch of the rice or potato.

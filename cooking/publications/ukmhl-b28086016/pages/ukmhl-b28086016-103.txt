WATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES 81 Cherries, strawberries, and pieces of pulp are sometimes added before serving, when the fruit drink is ladled from a bowl as fruit punch. Be sure to cut the berries if they are large. A brightness is imparted to the fruit punch by the addition of carbonated water just before serving. A quart of fruit punch, if served in small cups, will suffice for eight people. 2. Cocoa shells. Principle. — To extract the flavor from the shells, by boiling in water. Utensil. — A saucepan or coffee boiler. Proportions. — One half cup shells to 1 quart boiling water. As much as 1 cup of the shells may be used. Method. Wash the shells in a strainer under the faucet. Put the shells in the pot, pour on boiling water, and simmer gently for | hour. Strain off, and serve with cream, or milk, or evap- orated milk and sugar. 3. Cocoa. Principle. — To mix the particles smoothly and evenly with the liquid by stirring and by heating. Utensils. — A measuring cup, a saucepan, spoon, and beater. A double boiler, if milk only is used. Ingredients. Powdered cocoa, sugar, water, or milk, or milk and water. Cocoa made with milk does not agree with some people, in which case it may be made with water only, and served with cream, milk, or evaporated milk. Pi oportions. One teaspoonful of cocoa to J measuring cup. More or less as preferred. One teaspoonful of sugar, ditto. Method. Heat the liquid. Stir a portion of the liquid cold, with the cocoa, add this to the hot liquid, add the sugar, and beat vigorously for a minute before removing from the fire. 4. Chocolate. Principle.

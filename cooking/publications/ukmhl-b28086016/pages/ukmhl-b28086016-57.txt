Coal is measured by the ton of two thousand pounds avoir- dupois. A common hod of coal holds about thirty pounds. Coal should be bought in large quantity, and stored away in summer, if possible. The retail dealer in the city often charges an exorbitant sum for coal by the bag, so that the buyer of small quantities pays a much higher price for a ton bought in this way. The wholesale price of coal has increased on an average about 13 per cent since 1900. Coke is the solid substance remaining after gas has been made from certain kinds of coal, and is sometimes sold by gas companies, as a by-product. It is light, and therefore easy to handle and does not smoke, but it burns out quickly, and the fire of coke requires frequent replenishing. It is sold bjr the bag, or in large quantities by the ton, also some- times by the chaldron, an old English measure for coal, containing from thirty-two to thirty-six bushels. Gas was used for illuminating long before it came into common use for heating and cooking. Commercial gas manufactured for both lighting and cooking is really a mix- ture of various gases. One method produces it from bitu- minous coal heated in retorts. Another method gives “ water gas,” by passing steam through heated coal. The value of gas will depend upon-the components of the mixture, and the manufacturer has an opportunity to make an in- ferior gas unless the law stipulates what the quality shall be. The small town or country dweller may use a gas machine on the premises, the gas to be stored or generated in some tank in the ground, and piped into the house. Acetylene, a compound of carbon and hydrogen, is used in this way. Acetylene has a low flashing point, and there is question as to

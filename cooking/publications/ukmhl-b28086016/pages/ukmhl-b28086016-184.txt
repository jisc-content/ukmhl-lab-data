162 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT Fat as a cooking medium. — Fat is necessary for the saut6, and for deep fat frying. For deep fat frying several prep- arations are made from cottonseed oil that are agreeable to use and of moderate price. Lard has been the most commonly used, but many people object to the flavor. Beef drippings should be saved and kept cool in covered jelly glasses. These drippings are useful for browning vegetables, meatballs, and in pan-broiling if a small amount of additional fat is necessary. When deep fat frying is used, great pains must be taken to see that the fat is sufficiently hot in order that the food ma- terial may not soak fat, and the cooked food must be kept hot when the fat is draining off on absorptive paper. The best fats for this purpose are the vegetable oils. The re- fined cottonseed oils now on the market are excellent. For details of use see page 120. Keep a box of sand to pour into it, if the kettle of fat takes fire. Never pour water into blazing fat. GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES Principles of cooking. Fat melts at a low temperature. At about 350° F. it begins to smoke. At a higher temperature, a chemical change takes place, and the fat finally “ burns,” as the hydrogen and oxygen pass off. . It is emulsified by mixing with a substance like egg. 1. To whip cream. — Chill the cream, and set it in a bowl of ice water, or chipped ice. If the cream is warm, the beating will churn the cream to butter. (1) For a fine, close-whipped cream use a Dover egg beater. (2) For a lighter whipped cream, use a wire beater. 2. To mold butter. — A pair of wooden butter pats is necessary for this. Dip these first into hot water, then into cold. Cut off a square piece of butter, enough for one person, make it flat or round with two knives, and then roll it into shape between the butter pats. Chill, and serve in a dish on ice;

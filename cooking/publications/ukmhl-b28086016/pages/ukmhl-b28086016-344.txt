This common understanding between members of a family forms a bond of union, and each feels a greater pleas- ure and pride in doing his part. The fact that there is a budget and a system brings orderliness in methods of work and freedom from worry and anxiety as well as a saving of money. And this saving of money and strength is the same as an increase in income. This budget or division of ex- penses acts as a sailing chart and can be referred to from month to month. It should not, however, become a burden, and one should not worry if every penny is not accounted for. Statisticians tell us that about 75 per cent of the male adults of our country earn somewhat less than $600 a year. That in large cities $900 to $1000 a year is necessary to bring up a family to live decently and enjoy human happiness. Much depends upon how this income is divided as to whether results will tend to develop efficiency in the members of such a family. As the income increases from $1000 to $5000 it is possible to apportion the income and indicate certain per- centages which represent wise family expenditures so as to include the higher intellectual and emotional life as well as the physical welfare of the family. From comparison of many budgets statisticians have worked out certain percentages that are helpful in making our decisions, although they arc not to be taken as fixed rules. Expenditure for food. â€” On examining the budgets of families having incomes from $500 to $5000, it is found that the percentage spent for food increases as the income de- creases, amounting sometimes to at least 50 per cent of the in- come. This means that there is a limit to the money spent per capita per day for food, below which we cannot go and maintain life with even sufficient efficiency for unskilled labor. Figure 77 shows that a $900 income gives about 45 per cent to

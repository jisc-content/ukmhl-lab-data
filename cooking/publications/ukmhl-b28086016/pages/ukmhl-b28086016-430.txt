Dallas Atlanta San Francisco Boston Chicago Studies in Literature By FREDERICK MONROE TISDEL Assistant Professor of English in the University of Missouri. Cloth, i2tno., illustrated, 333 pages, list price $.90 In Part I of this book the author introduces the student to more than twenty standard English classics, giving in connection with each a brief explanatory introduction, suggestions for study and topics for oral and written discussion. These classics are grouped with respect to the dif- ferent types of literature which they represent,—epic, drama, essay, novel, etc., and there is a brief exposition of the type. The result is that in the mind of the reader the individual masterpiece and the type with its characteristics are inseparably connected. Part II consists of a brief but masterly survey of English literature. The book as a whole serves to systematize and unify the study of sec- ondary school literature, — a most desirable end. Professor E. A. Cross, State Teachers College, Greeley, Colo. “ It meets with my heartiest approval. It is brief, considers all the writers high school students need to know, touches the interesting features in the lives and works of these men, — about all you could want it to do.” Mr. John B. Opdycke, English Department of the High School of Commerce, New York City. “ I like it very much indeed. It has just enough in its re- view of the history of English literature, and its treatment of the classics is restrained and dignified. So far as I have seen, this is the only book that combines the two in one volume. I am all against the use of an abstract History of English Literature in the high school and I am all in favor of put- ting into the hands of the students some book that analyzes classics fully and yet with restraint. This book seems to have combined the two in just the right proportions and treated them in just the right manner.” THE MACMILLAN COMPANY Publishers 64-66 Fifth Ave. New York City

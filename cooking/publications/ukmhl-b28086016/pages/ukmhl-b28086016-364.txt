342 CHAPTER XXI HOW TO BUY The first rule in good buying is to know standard quality in your intended purchase, for then you need not be depend- ent upon the salesman. The second is to know your own needs, that you may not be beguiled by the clever advertise- ment in the daily paper, or the well-displayed bargain, and will not need to ask the salesman’s advice about quantity. Keep lists of articles needed in the card file, and make your shopping lists from these. The third rule is to apportion your purchases to your income and the divisions of your budget. Where to buy. — Patronize reliable firms. There are in any community shops of different grades, and you wall not find the best return for your money always at those houses where there is the greatest parade of cut prices and bargains. In the end the reliable places are the cheapest. Sometimes a firm trades on its reputation and a degree of fashion it has attained, but on the whole it is true that if one house has goods uniformly cheaper than another, it is because the quality is inferior. One fact that a good shopper learns is this — that certain articles may be purchased to greater advantage at one place than another. One firm excels in silks, another in household linen, another in coffee, and so on. Almost every community now has a “ white list ” and a branch of the Consumers’ League, the significance of which was explained in “ Shelter and Clothing,” p. 202.

10 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT change to heat. So in our bodies, the fuel foods, which enable us to do both involuntary and voluntary work, fur- nish heat at the same time, to keep our bodies warm. When we are too cold, we can shiver or run or jump, and thus, by doing more work, get more heat too. The unit of fuel value. — In our studies of food materials, we must find out just how much energy, or working power, can be obtained from each kind. We must have a measure of energy or fuel value; and just as the inch is a measure of length, and the pound of weight, so the Calorie serves as a measure of fuel value. This unit1 measures energy as heat, being the amount of heat required to raise 1 kilogram of water 1° C. (or 1 pound of water about 4° F.), but we can express it also as work, being sufficient energy to raise a 1-pound weight 3087 feet into the air (or 1 ton about 1^ feet) if it were possible to convert it into mechanical work without loss. By burning foods in pure oxygen in a vessel placed in water so that all the heat is given off to the water, and then noting the change in temperature of the water, it is possible to find out just how much energy each will yield. Such a device is called a calorimeter. In the body there is usually a small portion of each kind of foodstuff which escapes diges- tion, and protein is not quite so completely burned as in the calorimeter. When allowance for the probable loss is made, the energy values of the fuel foodstuffs are as follows: Protein 4 Calories per gram or 1814 per pound. Pat 9 Calories per gram or 4082 per pound. Carbohydrate .... 4 Calories per gram or 1814 per pound. The standard portion. — Knowing the composition of any food material, it is possible from these figures to calculate 'This is the “greater calorie” or “kilogram calorie,” and is written Calorie to distinguish it from the “lesser calorie’ or gram calorie, largely used in physics and chemistry.

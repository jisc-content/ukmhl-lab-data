65 FOOD PREPARATION natural force of heat under control. One novice who had allowed a flour paste to boil over and burn while she was looking out of the window remarked : “We may forget, but they never do! ” — a pretty way of stating the steady working of nature’s forces which we can harness for our use only by the exercise of reason and will and constant watch- fulness. The unintelligent cook is impatient of slow pro- cesses, and cannot believe that food will finally be “ done ” unless the water is at a “ galloping ” boil, and a red-hot fire is keeping the oven at burning temperature. Look upon the application of heat as a continuation of nature’s slow ripening process, a softening of tough fibers and a development of pleasing flavors. For why do we cook at all except for these reasons ? Primitive man thought only that the food had a better taste. He may have decided, too, that it was easier to masticate; but we have learned that in some cases we may, with right methods of cooking, make it easier to digest farther on in the alimentary canal. Modern science carries us a step farther and teaches us that cooking destroys lower organisms, such as harmful bacteria that may be present, and even animal parasites in meats. We cook, therefore, to improve the appearance of food, to develop flavors, to render some foodstuffs more digestible and to destroy microorganisms. We have at our command the following processes : Heat direct from coal, charcoal, wood, or gas. Toasting. — Surfaces of food exposed and turned for browning. Broiling. — Thin portions of meat or fish exposed and turned for searing, browning, and short cooking of the interior. Roasting. — Thicker cuts of meat exposed and turned frequently for searing, browning, and gradual cooking of the interior. This is an ancient method. It survives in the French “ Rotisserie ” ; and we use it in the modern gas stove when we cook directly under the gas. F

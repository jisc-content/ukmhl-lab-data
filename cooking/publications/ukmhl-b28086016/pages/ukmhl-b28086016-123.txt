Poor, even decayed, fruit may be used, the whole process may be unclean from beginning to end, and unde- sirable preservatives or an excess of sugar or spice may be in- troduced to cover the use of poor materials or methods. The condition of the worker in the cannery is one of the important industrial problems at the present time. Unhappily, poor conditions do often exist in canneries that turn out a cheap product. On the other hand, there are firms that may well take pride in their system from beginning to end.

43 FUEL AND STOVES Another illustration of the conserving of heat by the pre- vention of radiation is in the fireless cooker. This is a method used in Sweden in simple form, and adapted and improved to suit modern needs. Heat is supplied in the first place by gas or kerosene, and the water in the vessel containing the food is raised to the boiling point, and held there in some cases for a few minutes. The vessel is then placed in the “cooker,” which is a box with thick walls of some non-con- ducting material, and the heat already present is sufficient to finish the cook- ing process, since the radiation is very slow. In some cookers a heated stone is introduced to raise the temperature slightly. Both of these devices are ex- cellent for the long, slow cooking that seems to mellow the food material and develop the flavors that do not result from rapid cooking. At the same time, we need rapid pro- cesses, such as broiling and toasting, which give characteristic flavors. To meet this double need, a new type of gas stove has been made. See Fig 17. Fig- 16'~T^e Atkinson This is a gas stove, where the oven has thick walls of a non-conducting material. The oven is heated, for a short time only, the gas flame bying cut off when the oven has reached the desired temperature. At the left is an attachment where rapid cooking may be accomplished when desired, and there is a device at (1) with the same prin- ciple as the fireless cooker, or the tea “ cosey.” This cover is dropped over the kettle when the boiling point is reached, the flame is turned out, and the heat in the water finishes the process. There is no good reason why stoves embodying

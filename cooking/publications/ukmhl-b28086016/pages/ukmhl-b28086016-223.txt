201 YEAST BREAD 1. What should be the temperature of the ingredients when the bread is mixed ? 2. If milk is used, how may the souring of the milk be prevented ? 3. What temperature will you secure for the bread while it is rising ? 4. If an emergency occurs, and the dough cannot be kneaded or baked at the moment it is ready, what can be done ? Can you think of two expedients? A few suggestions. — The kneading stretches the gluten and long kneading gives a fine grain. In such a recipe as that for the making of Parker House rolls, a very delicate quality results from a protracted process; one old-fashioned housekeeper recommends a half hour’s kneading three times. Fortunately a sufficiently good bread or roll may be made by ten or fifteen minutes’ kneading at a time. Bread dough may be cut or stirred with a large knife in place of the kneading, and this is a good method to teach to those who live in crowded space and find it difficult to have a perfectly clean kitchen and proper utensils. With this method the dough must be softer, and it remains in the bowl until it is turned into the baking pan. The resulting loaf is somewhat moist, and not fine-grained, but the flavor is good. Brushing the surface of the dough in the bowl or pan with water or milk will prevent the formation of a dry crust on the top. Baking the bread. — The temperature of the oven should be steady, and about 380° F. An authority recommends 180° C. (355° F.) when the loaf is put in, rising to 220° C. (425° F.).1 The amount of flour for one loaf has been given. A loaf this size should be baked in a pan 8§ to 9 inches X 3| to 4 X 3 to 3|. The material of the pan is not of great consequence. Tin gives good results, a longer time being ^‘Some Points in the Making and Judging of Bread,” 1913. Isabel Bevier, Univ. of 111. Bulletin No. 25.

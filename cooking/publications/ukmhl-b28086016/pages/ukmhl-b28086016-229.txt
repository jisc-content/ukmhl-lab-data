Be careful to spread it evenly and see that it is near the edge of the bread. Sand- wiches may be made either with or without the crust. If the crust is to be removed, cut it off the loaf before buttering and slicing. The filling. — There is an endless variety of filling pos- sible for sandwiches, from slices of meat and poultry, which make a substantial luncheon for picnics, to the dainty fillings used for afternoon teas and receptions.

For a sweet sandwich, jam or jelly may be spread on the slices and possibly a small amount of cream cheese put between. You can invent many combinations. The shape of the sandwich may be oblong, triangular, or round. The round sandwich is cut with a sharp cooky cutter. The pieces remaining may be dried and used for bread crumbs. The crusts may always be utilized in this way. 9. Croutons. — Cut a slice of bread a day old 5 inch thick.

193 YEAST BREAD and the time of planting, also, affects the quality of the grain. The time of planting and reaping gives us two classes of wheat and flour, the winter and spring. Winter wheat is sown in the fall and obtains its first growth before winter, living through the winter in those latitudes where the climate is sufficiently mild, being harvested in early summer. Spring wheat is sown in the spring and harvested late and it is the wheat of the great flour-producing state, Minnesota. The difference in the composition of the two wheats is shown in this table.1 Water Protein Fat Carbo- hydrate Ash Wheat Spring varieties . . . 10.4 12.5 2.2 73. 1.9 Winter varieties . . . 10.5 11.8 2.1 73.8 1.8 Note that the spring wheat contains more protein and there- fore more gluten. The flour from spring wheat is creamy in color, granular to the touch, has more gluten, and is known as a strong flour. Flour from winter wheat is somewhat whiter in color and smoother to the touch, feeling more like corn- starch, and if a portion is squeezed in the hand, it retains the imprint of the fingers. It has less gluten, more starch, and is known as a soft flour. This type of flour is some- times called “ pastry flour,” the smaller percentage of gluten making it more desirable for pastry or cake than the stronger flour. Flour manufacturers and bakers are constantly experi- menting to find the best possible varieties and combinations of varieties for bread flour. Some difference of opinion exists, 1 U. S.

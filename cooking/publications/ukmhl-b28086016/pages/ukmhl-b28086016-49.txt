KITCHEN FURNISHINGS 27 Tin. — Tin, a “ useful metal,” is plated on thin sheet iron for utensils. So called block tin is the best quality. Will not endure intense heat.’ The tin wears and scratches off with use. Not easy to clean. Discolors easily, and colors acid fruit. Poor tin ware is not worth buying. Good quality is not cheap. May be used for measures, and for small saucepans, but is less desirable than other wares. Wooden ware. — Used for molding boards, meat boards, and spoons. The patterns of utensils. — Select those made without seams, or flutings, where food particles collect. Bowls, saucepans, and kettles should have a lip on the side, for the pouring out of liquids. A pitcher should be of such shape that it can be easily washed, and it should have a lip that will pour well. A pot for boiling coffee should have a lip and not a spout. Select utensils with .non-conducting handles. Study carefully the selection of knives, and do not try to economize in their purchase. Knives must be sharp, and poor quality steel will never take a good edge. A worn table knife of Sheffield steel, when ground down, makes the best of kitchen knives. Buy a good sharpener and use it frequently. Labor-saving devices. —- A good machine saves the wear and tear of human muscle, and also much time. If you have studied the principles of the lever and other mechanical devices, you will understand why this is.1 Learn to pay for, use, and clean good machines. A “ Dover ” egg beater is built on the principle of the “ wheel and axle.” The large wheel has five times as many 1 Teacher’s Note. — The machines operating with a crank are examples of the “wheel and axle,” or the windlass, or both.* The mechanical advan- tage can be worked out mathematically, — a good problem for the physics or mathematics class.

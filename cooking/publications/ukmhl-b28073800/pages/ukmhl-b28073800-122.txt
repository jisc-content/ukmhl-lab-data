The best way of cooking them is by stewing; when, if well done, they are quite equal to any fresh-water carp, which, when prepared in this manner, they very closely resemble in flavour. They are also very good baked with a forcemeat pudding in their bellies. They may also be cooked in the same way as we shall hereafter point out for dressing surmullet; and in that form afford so good an imitation of the latter fish, that few persons who are not good judges of fish would detect the difference. They also make a very good fish-pie. The chads, or young fish, are very nice marinated; and when potted in the way we shall hereafter point out, may be made nearly, if not quite, equal to potted char. It is, however, a fish that does not keep well, and ought to be gutted soon after it is taken. Another disadvantage it possesses is, that it does not take salt well; consequently, it is next to useless to attempt to preserve it in that manner. The brightness of the eyes and colours, and transparency of the slime, denote it to be fresh; when stale, it looks dull, and becomes soft and discoloured about the abdomen.

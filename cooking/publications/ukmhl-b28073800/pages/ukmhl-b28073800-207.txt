199 GRAVIES FOR FRIED FISH. become brown; the pieces must then be taken out and placed in a stewpan, with a small quantity of water or broth. A large-sized onion, or two or three small ones, well coated with flour, must then be fried brown in the butter in which the pieces of fish were done, and then, with the butter, must be cast into the stewpan, with some sweet herbs and a small piece of butter of about the size of a walnut, or, what is still better, a proportionate quantity of cream in lieu of the butter. Season with cayenne, common pepper, salt, nutmeg, a squeeze of lemon, a teaspoonful of Cornubian sauce, or twice that portion of lemon pickle or ketchup. Let the whole stew together until it becomes of the consistency of raw cream, or rather until the liquid has decreased about one-third of its original quantity. You may add to the above some pickled onions and mushrooms, as also a few oysters, either fresh or pickled; if fresh, add to the gravy in the stew- pan the liquor of the oysters also. A glass or two of wine, either red or white, will also be found an improvement. If your stock of head and bones is not suffi- cient, then throw in a spare cutlet or two of the fish, or a small eel, conger, gurnard, or flounder cut up in pieces, and without any consideration about their being all of the same kind of fish.

THE COOKERY OF FISH. 230 dish in an oven, and there let it remain until sufficiently baked. Then take up the fish, and place it carefully on a clean dish; and pour out the liquor from the baking-dish into a saucepan, adding to it a glass of wine or cider, or something less than half that quantity of vinegar, a few oysters, either fresh or pickled, chopped up in small pieces (if in summer, when oysters cannot be procured, substitute cockles or mussels) ; add a tea-spoonful of the ketchup, soy, or half the quantity of Cornubian sauce, and a piece of butter well coated with flour. The whole must be kept well stirred together until it boils, and must then be poured into the dish over the fish. Garnish with fried bread and sliced lemon. To roast a Codâ€™s Head. Boil a cod's head and shoulders until it is about half done. Then, taking it up, strip all the skin carefully off, and place it before a brisk fire, basting it well with butter, and dredging it over with flour; and, as soon as the froth rises, strew fine bread-crumbs over it, and continue basting until the fish is thoroughly done. Then serve it up, garnished with fried parsley, or scraped horseradish, and sliced lemon around the border of the dish. Oyster sauce may also be served up with it.

T1IE COOKERY OF FISH. 222 * See page 163. To stew Cud's Sounds and Tongues. Having the sounds and tongues prepared as before directed*, boil them in milk and water until they are about half-done. Then, having ready some veal broth, put into it two boiled onions, a small piece of butter rolled in flour and enough cream to thicken the gravy, and a piece of lemon- peel ; then put in the sounds and tongues, and let the whole stew away gently for about twenty mi- nutes. Season with a little nutmeg, cayenne, com- mon pepper and salt. Garnish with sliced lemon. To stew Pilchards with Potatoes. This is a truly Cornish dish, and will, we fear, suit few but Cornish palates. Wash some salt pilchards, and place them with some peeled pota- toes in a saucepan, with a sufficient quantity of water to prevent the stew from burning; let the whole boil until the potatoes are done, and then serve up the fish and potatoes in the same dish. To stew Lobsters. Take a large lobster, or two small ones, and extracting all the meat from the head, body, tail, and claws, and carefully extracting the black gut, break it all up into small portions; put the whole into about half a pint of strong fish or meat gravy,

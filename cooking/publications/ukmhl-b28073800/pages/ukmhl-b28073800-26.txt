CHOICE AND COOKERY OF FISH. 18 stale appearance of a codfish that has been for some time captured; and it is from the scales being thus detached, and the dull, dry-looking aspect of the fish, that a trawl-caught codfish may be dis- tinguished from one taken by a hook and line. The colour of the gills will, however, still afford a test of its freshness, which may also be deter- mined by pressing the point of your finger hard enough upon the body of the fish to make an im- pression, which will remain if the fish be stale, but will rise again immediately on the removal of the pressure if it be perfectly fresh. There is a smaller variety of cod called the variable or speckled cod, which is sometimes taken on our coasts, and which differs from the common codfish in having a smaller head, and by the lower jaw being considerably shorter than the upper one, as it also does in its external colouring; which is a greyish brown speckled over with yel- low or pale drab spots. It is a smaller fish than the common cod, as it seldom exceeds seven or eight pounds weight; but if in good order is superior in flavour to a well-fed common codfish of the same size. 2.

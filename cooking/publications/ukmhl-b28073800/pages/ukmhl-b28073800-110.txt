These fish, although inhabitants of our seas, are not often captured upon any part of our coasts, for want of some mode of fishing properly adapted to the purpose; those we consume are always sent over to us from abroad preserved in pickle. Like sprats and whitebait, the very larjie ones are not so good as those of smaller size. Shads. Both species of shads resemble an overgrown herring. Of these the allice is the larger fish ; be in" sometimes met with as much as two feet Â© in length. The twaite is usually about one- ' half that length ; and may be distinguished from the former fish by a row of dusky spots, five or six in number, commencing at the gill covers, and running along the side line about half-way down the body. The allice has only one of these spots, which is placed immediately behind the gills. The twaite also possesses teeth, which the allice is entirely without.

The best season for both these fishes is April, May, and the early part of June. About July

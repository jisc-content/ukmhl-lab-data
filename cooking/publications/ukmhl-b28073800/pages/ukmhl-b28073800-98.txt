90 CHOICE AND COOKERY OF FISH. sides; but absence of the beak-like elongation oi the jaws shows a marked distinction between them. The former also differ essentially from the garfish in the number, shape, and position of their fins, the former wanting the ventral fins, with which the latter is provided; and also in having a very elongated dorsal fin, which extends nearly from the nape to the tail, that of the sea-pike being placed far back, and, al- though elevated, being narrow. There are two distinct kinds of launces, the greater and the less; the larger kind beino- known in most places as the sand-eel, the smaller as the sand-launce. In many parts of Cornwall, however, we have found these titles reversed; the term sand-launce being applied to the larger, and sand-eel to the smaller species. The latter it must, however, be observed, is so much the better fish, that the two will not bear any com- parison with each other, the larger kind beino- watery and insipid, the smaller delicious beyond description. It is most essential, therefore, that we should point out how the two kinds may be t guished from each other; for, although the larger kind sometimes grows to the length of two feet, and the smaller species is seldom more than seven or eight inches, yet it often happens that small fish of the former kind associate themselves

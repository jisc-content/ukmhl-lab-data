82 CHOICE AND COOKERY OF FISH. The Gudgeon Is a small fish of six or seven inches long; but which, in spite of the smallness of size, is held in fair esteem on account of its wholesome qua- lities and delicacy of flavour; hence it is recom- mended to invalids ; and, as these fish cannot be eaten in too fresh a state, they are exposed for sale alive in small tubs or vessels. They soon decompose after death; which may be detected by a dull-red, discoloured appearance about the abdomen, through which the intestines often pro- trude. They ought, therefore, to be gutted as speedily as possible after they are taken, as the delay of even an hour or two may cause them to become tainted; when, if the precaution we have recommended had been adopted, they would have kept good for a much longer time. The best, and we believe the only proper way of dressing gudgeons, is by frying them, when, if cleverly done, they will nearly equal smelts in delicacy of flavour. Minnows, Loaches, and Bullheads, When you can obtain a sufficient supply, make a very nice fry ; but they ought all to be cooked very soon after they arc taken, as they soon become tainted.

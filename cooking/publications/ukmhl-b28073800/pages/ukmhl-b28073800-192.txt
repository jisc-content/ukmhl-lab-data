THE COOKERY OF FISH. 184 with plain melted butter. Many of the fish- sauces we have previously mentioned may be eaten with this fish, liuffes and weevers, and also shads, or the fry of the sea-bream may be cooked and served up in the same manner. To fry Bass and Mullet. Small bass and mullet, that is, fishes of either of these kinds, of less than half a pound weight, should be prepared and fried in the same manner as we have just before directed for cooking pei ch, when they exceed the above-mentioned size they should be split open by the back, and fiied in the way we have before directed for cod- lings and haddock. A very large bass should, however, be cut up in steaks, in the way we have ordei ed a cod to be done; but a large mullet should be cut up in cutlets in the same manner as a hake. The head, bones, and other super- fluous parts will serve as materials for a gravy. Serve up with plain melted butter, and any of the fish-sauces we have before mentioned may be eaten with either of these fishes. To fry H rasse. Scale them thoroughly, and cutting offâ€™ all their fins close to the body, pepper and salt them well, and hang them up to dry for three or four hours

202 TIIE COOKERY OF FISH. * See page 188. To broil Salmon Peel, Trout, Mackerel, Codlings, Whitings, Haddocks, Whiting Pollack, and Gurnards. All these fishes should be dressed entire, being split by the back and spread open, and being well peppered and salted inside; after which they must be well dredged with flour on both sides, to prevent them from sticking to the gridiron; and when done, lay them flat and spread open, with the inside uppermost, into which plenty of butter must be rubbed before the fire. To broil Herrings. These fishes should be prepared in the same manner as for frying*, and should be thoroughly dried and well dredged with flour. The roes should not be dressed in the fish, but dressed separately; but as the latter are apt to slip off, between the bars, into the fire, the best way of dressing them is by frying; and as fried onions are an excellent accompaniment to broiled her- rings, the roes and onions may share the frying- pan together. The herrings should be broiled until they are thoroughly brown, and, plenty of butter being rubbed into them, they should be served up with mustard and plain melted butter.

Ill THE EED MULLET. flavour, they are celebrated for the delicious taste of their livers, which is the only sauce that should be eaten with them; on which account they are usually dressed without being drawn, in the same manner as woodcocks: but this is an objectionable mode, as the intestines have afterwards to be separated from the livers; which, if not properly done, leads to very disagreeable consequences; besides which, the garbage presents an unsightly appearance. But all this may be avoided by adopt- ing the plan we shall point out when we come to treat of the proper ways to prepare and cook this most excellent of fishes. Bed mullets are in best season during the latter part of summer; and so they continue until the end of the year. The best proof of their fresh- ness is the brightness of their colours and the moisture on the scales; as also the brightness of the eyes and redness of the gills. If they look dry, and are soft about the abdomen, the eyes sunk, and the gills pale, they are stale. If caught in a trawl they are comparatively worthless, the livers being squeezed up with the intestines, and utterly spoilt. A trawl-caught surmullet may be recognised by having its scales rubbed off. If you see one of these fishes with all its scales on, you are safe, for even if caught in a trawl it has in that case incurred no injury.

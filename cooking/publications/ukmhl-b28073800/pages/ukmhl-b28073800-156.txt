148 nOW TO CLEAN AND PRESERVE FISH. then hang up the fish by the head, when a great quantity of watery slime will drain from it; and if the skin does not come off readily the skinning process may be accelerated by scalding the fish in boiling water. The best parts are the fins, the cartilages of which should be cut across with a sharp knife into strips of about an inch or so in width. The other parts may be cut up in small pieces. When cut up, the pieces should be thrown into strong salt and water, and kept there for some hours, or even a day or more, before they are dressed, which will extract every rank taint, and impart a more white and delicate appearance to the flesh. Eels should be skinned before they are dressed. This must be done whilst they are quite fresh, otherwise the skins do not come off so readily; but it is as unnecessary as cruel to skin them whilst alive, for the skins come off quite as easily when the fish is recently dead as when the bar- barous proceeding above alluded to is practised. The way to kill eels speedily we have already pointed out. To skin these fish in the most easy manner you should first cut just through the skin all around the body below the gill aper- tures ; then stick a strong skewer or the prong of a stout steel fork through the head above, and, holding on by that part with one hand, take a

206 THE COOKERY OF FISIT. t See page 151. * See page 151. To broil Redherrings and Salt Pilchards. Having steeped the herrings either in boiling water or beer, pursuant to the directions before laid down*, broil them before a brisk fire, upon a toasting-fork, until they are sufficiently done, and be sure that the roe is thoroughly dressed through; then rub in as much butter into it as will absorb before the fire. If any of them contain hard roes, open the belly, and insert some butter between the lobes of the roe, closing it up again so that the heat may the more readily melt the butter. Mustard is the proper accompaniment for red- herrings, although but few persons seem aware of it. Salt pilchards may be broiled in the same way as redherrings. To broil Salt Fish. Salt fish, after being well watered, pursuant to our previous directions f, may be broiled on a oridiron, over a slow fire, and, when done, as much butter should be rubbed into it as it will absorb. It may be served up with egg sauce and parsnips. Mustard also may be eaten with it.

150 HOW TO CLEAN AND PRESERVE FISH. salted, it is an improvement to make the pickle with equal portions of salt and saltpetre. Hake are also cured in the same way, when they are intended to be smoked as well as dried. This smoking process is a great improvement to salted hake, as it also is to all the salmon tribe; and may be done in the same way as hams or bacon. When fish are kept in pickle only, they should be taken out after they have been a week or ten days in the brine, and be thoroughly washed â€” pumping over it is the best way; and new pickle being made, the fish should be cast into it, and there allowed to remain until required for use. When wanted for the table, they should be watered and drained, for the purpose of extracting the salt, in the same manner as dried salt fish. Keeping fish in pickle improves the colour, or rather pre- serves it better than when the fish is thoroughly dried; but if kept for any great length of time, it is difficult to extract the excessive saltness which it imbibes there.

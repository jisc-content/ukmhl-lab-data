CHOICE OF SALT FISH. 131 by means of saltpetre to a colourless and un- healthy fish; numbers of which are cured in this way, and whose defects are attempted to be dis- guised in the manner we have just mentioned. Red herrings should look very bright, and shine like burnished metal, and be thoroughly stiff. If limp, and dull in colour, and soft or broken about the belly-parts, they are not good. Pilchards should look firm; but these fishes are seldom met with ill cured, although, from their extreme saltness and strong, oily, rancid taste, few persons, excepting those who have been accustomed to them from early life, can be prevailed upon to eat them. Fishes hejjt in pickle should present a clean ap- pearance, and be free from spots or bruises. They should also feel firm and elastic to the touch. Anchovies shoidd be firm and hard, and the abdomen entire and unbroken ; they should also be of a red colour under the skin. If soft and of a brown colour, with the abdomen broken, and the ribs showing through the aperture, they are bad. The smaller ones are considered superior to those of larger size. K 2

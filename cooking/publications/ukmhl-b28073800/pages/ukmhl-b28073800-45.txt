37 THE TORSK. inches in length, and is very ugly to hootâ€”the fishermen who catch them, much oftener than is supposed, throw them aside as worthless. We ourselves have occasionally taken them with a hook and line ; and, having put the edible merits of the first we captured to the test, were so well satisfied with the result, that we have taken care to turn all the rest that have come in our way to the same account. The best parts are about the head and collar-bones, which are beyond description delicious. 13. The Torsk. The torsk is entirely a northern fish, swarming about the Shetland Islands and the Orkneys, from whence we receive it in the form of dried salt-fish; but it is rarely brought to our markets in a fresh state. It has, however, been sometimes brought from Scotland to London in well-boats; but this, it seems, only occurs at rare intervals. When eaten quite fresh it is said to be rather tough; on which account it is usually preferred in a salted state. It has something the form of a ling, but is of a much stouter make. As we can only speak from our own knowledge of this fish in its salted state we must defer any further observations upon it until we come to treat upon the subject of salt fish.

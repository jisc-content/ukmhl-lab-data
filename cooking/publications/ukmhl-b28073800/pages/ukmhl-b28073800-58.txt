CHOICE AND COOKERY OF FISH. 50 pally at the junction of the fins with the body. Although small, they are quite equal in goodness tÂ° a sole of the same size. They are not a very common fish, but may be frequently seen in Ply- mouth fish-market in the early part of the spring. 13. The Scald Fish Seldom exceeds four or five inches in length. It is shaped like a sole, but differs from it essentially in having the eyes placed on the reverse side of the head. Its scales are very large in proportion to its size, but come off so readily as to be always rubbed away by the rough usage it encounters in the trawl nets; which gives it the naked, par- boiled appearance from whence it derives its name. It is rather a scarce fish, which is little to be regretted, as, independently of its insignifi- cant size, it does not possess an agreeable flavour. There is also another small kind of sole, called the solinette; which is a little fish of about the same size as the last, but is of a longer make than any of the preceding. It is a very scarce fish, and even when taken by the trawlers is usually thrown overboard with the weeds and rubbish of the trawl; so that it very rarely finds its way into the fish-markets.

168 THE COOKERY OF FISII. * See page 165. up in the same manner as we have previously directed for a salmon.* Garnish with sliced lemon, and serve it up with plain melted butter. Eels and Congers. Neither of these fishes should be boiled, unless of large size. Eels should be first skinned, but the skin must be retained upon congers; but either kind should be cut up in small portions, to disguise their snake-like form, and for the same reason most persons throw the head away. They should be served up with chopped parsley, mixed up in melted butter. To boil a Turbot. Great attention is required to boil a turbot properly, for being, when in prime order, a very thick and solid fish, as compared with the rest of the flounder tribe, it necessarily takes some time to boil thoroughly, and if the process be con- ducted carelessly the skin is very apt to break, which not only injures the appearance of the fish, but in some degree deteriorates from its goodness. To prevent this some preliminary steps are neces- sary, both in preparing the water, as well as the fish itself, before it is put into it.

87 THE PIKE. only just then introduced into this country; yet this cannot possibly be correct, as it is clearly established that pikes were a marketable com- modity in this kingdom as far back as the reign of King Edward I. The best portions of a pike are those over the ribs, which have, in addition to superiority in richness of flavour, the advantage of being free from those forked-bones with which the other parts of this fish are plentifully supplied, and which prove exceedingly troublesome. In the first year the young pikes—or rather jack, for so they are technically styled until they attain the weight of four pounds—have a greenish cast over their scales, which assumes a grayish- brown tint, with large pale spots as the fish increases in size and age. When in highest condition, these spots acquire a golden tint, and the grey cast turns to an olive green, which, combined with a bulky thickness about the shoulders, and depth of body well filled out, afford a sure proof of the healthy order of the fish. We have heard, and also read of fishes of this species being sometimes met with of a beautiful golden cast, with black spots, and of others possess- ing a green backbone; the latter of which are said to be highly esteemed, on account, we presume, of the rarity of this extraordinary peculiarity.

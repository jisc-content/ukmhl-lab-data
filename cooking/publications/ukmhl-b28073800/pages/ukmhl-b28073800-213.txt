1I0W TO BROIL FISII. 205 To broil Bream and Shads so as to resemble Surmullet. Wipe the fish down the body with a cloth, so as to cleanse it from the slime, but not so as to displace any of the scales; then, opening the fish, take out the inside and wipe out the body with a cloth; and then, separating the liver from the intestines, introduce it again into the fishâ€™s belly, wrap the fish in white paper, and broil it in the same manner as a surmullet, and serve it up the same way. A fish under a pound weight is best adapted for this purpose ; and, as fish of this kind are remarkably cheap and plentiful, the livers of two or three fishes may be taken to fill the body of one fish, and the other fish applied to some other purpose; and when prepared in this manner there are very few persons upon whom these fish might not be passed for genuine surmullet. To broil Cod's Sounds and Tongues. Prepare these as for boiling*, and after season- ing them with cayenne, and common pepper and a little salt, flour them well and broil them whole. Serve them up with melted butter. * As to which, see page 163.

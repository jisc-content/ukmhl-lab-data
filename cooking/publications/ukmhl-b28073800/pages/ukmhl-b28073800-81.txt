73 THE CARP AND CRUCIAN. very inferior fish, and, though capable of being made an agreeable dish, can never be rendered equal to the former fish. Externally, the two fishes bear a strong resemblance to each other; but as one is so much the superior, it is essential that we should give such directions as may enable our readers to detect the difference between them. One certain rule for discrimination is the size, for a crucian seldom exceeds the weight of two pounds; so that if you select a fish of three or four pounds weight, you may, though not safe from deception, at any rate congratulate yourself upon being the purchaser of something monstrously wonderful. But these other cri- teria may always be relied on: â€” Thus, the crucian is a deeper-bodied fish than the common carp; its head is also shorter, and its nose more blunt. The colour also is paler; the sides being of a light olive brown, with a slight golden cast, becoming pale towards the belly, the lower part of which is white, whilst, in the true carp, the general colour is a deep brown on the back, growing paler, and acquiring a deep golden cast on the sides, passing into a lighter shade towards the belly. The head of the true carp is also of a much darker cast than that of the crucian; but the most certain and never-failing mark of dis- tinction lies in the formation of the back fin.

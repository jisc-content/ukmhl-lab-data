CHOICE AND COOKERY OF FISH. 20 the scales undisturbed, and all the fins unruffled, if the scales are rubbed off, the body assumes a dull reddish tint, and if the rays of the fins, par- ticularly the tail fin, are broken, and separate from the membrane, the fish has been caught in a trawl, and will be scarcely worth eating; as the pressure it encounters in the net squeezes up the liver and intestines, and imparts a strong and disagreeable taint to the whole fish. Redness of the gills and brightness of the eyes also afford a test of the freshness of this fish. When it is stale the gills turn to a dull cast, the sides grow dull, and the fish becomes limp. A haddock, like a codfish, ought to be perfectly stiff; but this does not always occur even in a perfectly fresh and healthy fish; still a fish that does not stiffen never flakes out well. The largest haddocks, it seems, are found in Dublin Bay, and on the coasts of Devonshire and Cornwall; on the latter of which they are some- times taken weighing as much as fourteen pounds, and specimens of from eight to ten pounds may be constantly met with in the fish-markets alono- the southern line of coast of those counties; whilst from two to four pounds weight may be con- sidered the common average of those fishes ob- tained by the London markets from the other parts of our sea-coast.

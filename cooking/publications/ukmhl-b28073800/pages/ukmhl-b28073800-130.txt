It does not, however, come into season so early as its congeners, being seldom found in good order before September; from whence it continues in season until the spring. But at all times a number of these fish may be met with that are in a thin and emaciated condition, and these should always be rejected. The proof of good condition is the fulness of the body, and a bright coppery tinge upon the sides. Its freshness is tested in the same way as the rest of its tribe.

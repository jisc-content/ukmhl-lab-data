144 HOW TO CLEAN AND PRESERVE FISH. fish is to be cooked, should be split through from nose to tail with a very sharp knife, so that the flesh may be cut clean and without being jagged close to the back bone; the belly being left entire, and the fish thus spread open. This mode of preparation is well adapted to some particular kinds of fish when designed for either broiling or frying, such as salmon peel, mackerel, garfish, cod, whiting, and fish of the like kind; as by that means the rich fat portion about the belly part is preserved, which would be in great measure lost if the fish was opened by the belly in the usual way. When opened by the back, also, the form of the fish is better suited to either the gridiron or the frying-pan, than when pre- pared in any other way.

Sprats, sand-launces, and many other very small fishes, are best cleaned by cutting off the head just below the collar bones, and at the same time drawing out the intestines with the gills, without ripping open the bodies.

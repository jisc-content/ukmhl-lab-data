244 THE COOKERY OF FISH. * See page 221. f See page 222. Salt-Jish Pie. Prepare your fish as for stewing*, and when it will bear it pull it in pieces with a fork; and having four or five hard-boiled eggs chopped up fine, season the whole with cayenne and com- mon pepper, and then fill up the dish with as much milk as it will contain ; when the pie is baked, lift the lid, pour a little cream into it, and close it up again immediately. Lobster Pie. Prepare your lobsters in the same way as for stewing f; and if the lobster be a female, beat up the coral and spawn in a mortar. This being done, cast all you have picked out, both great and small together, into a stewpan, with a small quantity of water, veal broth, or thin fish gravy, three tea-spoonfuls of vinegar, and a good-sized piece of butter rubbed in flour; season with cayenne, pepper, salt, a small quantity of grated nutmeg, and pounded mace. Let all these in- gredients warm very gently over a slow fire, until the mixture begins to simmer ; then put the whole into a very shallow pie dish, and cover it with a rich crust, and bake it until the paste is done, when it will be ready for the table.

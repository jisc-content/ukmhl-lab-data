182 THE COOKERY OF FISH. jected parts serve to make a gravy for the other parts, and may also be converted into an excellent souj), as we shall duly notice hereafter. To fry conger properly, the process must be twice gone through. First, the pieces must be put into the frying-pan with a moderate quantity of dripping, in which the fish must be first par- tially fried, for the purpose of extracting the watery particles from the body, which, mixing with the fat in the pan, causes a considerable frizzing, and in this the fish would never fry to a proper brown colour. Let the frying, however, go on until the frizzing begins to subside, and then take out the fish, and having poured away the contents of the pan, wiped it out, and put in plenty of fresh dripping, replace it on the fire, and when the dripping is melted and begins to boil, put in the pieces of conger again, and let them fry gently until thoroughly dressed. When done, serve it up with plain melted butter, parsley and butter, or fennel sauce; anchovy, soy, ketchup, or Cornubian sauce may also be eaten with it. If a fish-gravy is made from the other parts, it should be served up in boats with the melted butter.

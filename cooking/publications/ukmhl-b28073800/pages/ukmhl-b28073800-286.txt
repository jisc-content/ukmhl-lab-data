Mix up a good-sized piece of butter in plenty of flour, and melt it with some of the liquor from the cockles, a spoonful of anchovy sauce, or a dis- solved anchovy, and a little vinegar ; then throw in the cockles, which must be previously boiled and extracted from the shells, and shake them about for two or three minutes; and serve them up in boats.

Take as many anchovies as you are likely to require out of the pickle; dip them into boiling water, and, taking them out instantly, lay them flat upon their sides, and scrape off all the scales and white slime, and with a knife remove what- ever portion of intestines they may contain.

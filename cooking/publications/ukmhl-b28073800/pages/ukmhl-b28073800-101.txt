93 THE COMMON MACKEREL. very common fishes, but the two latter are only occasional visitors to our shores. The only shape in which we can get tunny is in a pickled state from abroad, and the banito we never see in any shape or form. As our sole object is to treat about such fishes only as may be met with in our fish-markets, we shall therefore pass over the two latter, and confine our observations to the two former species. The Common Mackerel Is a very general fish, and perhaps more familiarly known to the public than any other kind of fish whatever; and yet very few persons know how to recognise a good fish of this kind from a bad one ; though with no species of fish whatever is this knowledge more requisite ; for not only is there a vast difference between the relative srood- O ness of condition of these fishes, but they also keep so badly, that it is quite as necessary to know how the state of its freshness may be pro- perly tested. On account, indeed, of fish of this kind keeping so badly, an act of Parliament Avas expressly passed so far back as the reign of King William III., authorising the sale of mackerel on Sundays; and thus the law has continued to the present day.

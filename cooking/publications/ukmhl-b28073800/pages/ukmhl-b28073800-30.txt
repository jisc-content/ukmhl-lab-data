22 CHOICE AND COOKERY OF FISH. about two pounds to half a pound weight. It is a fish that keeps badly, from the oily nature of its liver, which soon imparts g rancid flavour to the fish, but which may be entirely prevented by extracting the intestines within a few hours after it is caught; if this, however, be duly at- tended to, the fish will be found to possess a very agreeable flavour ; the larger ones being delicious when boiled, and the smaller ones equally so when fried, provided they be done soon after they are caught; but they lose a great deal of the delicacy of their flavour when kept; and, though they may be preserved by being sprinkled with salt, it deprives them altogether of the fine taste they possess when perfectly fresh. From being so seldom partaken of in a state of perfection this fish does not bear so good a reputation as it really merits. Those caught in a trawl are rendered worthless, and may be detected by the dull aspect they acquire by being deprived of their scales. In selecting a bib, see that the eyes and scales look bright, and the slime on the bodies clear and transparent; that the fish is well filled out, deep-bodied, high at the back, and thick behind the shoulders. Gut the fish as soon as possible, and cook it at the earliest opportu- nity.

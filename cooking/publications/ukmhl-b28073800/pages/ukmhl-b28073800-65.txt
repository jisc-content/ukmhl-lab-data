57 THE SALMON. acquire a coppery tinge; and the cheeks, particu- larly of the male fish, become marked with orange-coloured stripes; and, when at the very worst, the whole fish assumes a dusky cine- reous hue, whilst its thin and emaciated ap- pearance denotes the wretched state of the fish; but long before this, in fact as soon as the sides assume the coppery tinge above alluded to, the fish is unfit to be eaten. When a salmon first comes in from the sea, it is often covered with small parasitical insects, which, so far from de- noting ill-health, affords a certain proof of the excellence of its condition. The male fish, or, as it is sometimes called, the kipper, is known from the female by the hooked shape of the lower jaw ; and this, as the fish grows out of season, increases in size, forming at length a groove in the upper jaw. When the fish is cut up, the flesh should be of a beautiful pink, and the flakes clearly de- veloped. This is the best proof of its being in season. It is a common practice to crimp salmon, in order to make it eat dry and crisp; but, to pro- duce this effect, the operation must be performed immediately after it is taken out of the water; the fish being killed with a few hard blows over the head, and the incisions made instantly afterwards.

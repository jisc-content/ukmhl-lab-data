169 HOW TO BOIL FISH. * See page 159. In the first place, see that your kettle is suffi- ciently large, and then pour into it water enough to cover the fish, and throw in a handful of 6alt, half a pint of vinegar, some pieces of shred horseradish, and sweet herbs ; let all these in- gredients boil up for some time in the water, so that it may imbibe all their strength; then lift oft the kettle and allow the water to become per- fectly cool. Then take the turbot, and scoring it just through the skin on the dark side (Avhich is the most effectual means of preventing it from cracking on the other), place your fish in the kettle, with the dark side downwards, and as soon as the water boils check it as before directed.* A moderate sized turbot will take about twenty minutes, and a large one from five-and-twenty minutes to half an hour boiling. When done enough, take care to drain it well, lay it on a napkin placed upon a fish-drain, and serve it up garnished with sliced lemon, and scraped horse- radish strewed over the fish. The spaAvn of a hen lobster spread over the AAdiite side of the fish gives it a very elegant and attractive appearance. It should be accompanied Avith lobster, or shrimp, or crab sauce. Anchovy, soy, ketchup, Cornubian sauce, or vinegar, may also be eaten Avith it, as may also sliced cucumber.

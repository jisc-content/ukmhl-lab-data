108 CIIOICE AND COOKERY OF FISH. length about three or four inches. They are both prettily marked fishes, being striped over the body and sides with various colours ; but they have a waspish look about their countenances, which is borne out by the formidable weapon they bear in the form of three or four short but sharp spines placed on the nape just behind the head, with which they can inflict a puncture attended with great pains, often succeeded by violent inflammation. To prevent these con- sequences, the French fishermen are compelled, by the laws of their country, to cut oft these spines before they are allowed to expose the fish for sale. The most effectual cure for a wound of this kind is to make a strong brine, and then, plunging in the wounded part, to keep the brine as hot as the patient can bear it. Mr. Couch says,* that smart friction with oil soon restores the part to health. It is probably owing to a prejudice against these fishes arising from their poisonous weapons, that they are rarely eaten in this country, although held in great esteem amongst the French; which indeed they truly merit, as they possess a sweet and rich flavour, very like that of the sole. They are excellent fried or stewed. Although plentiful in * YarrelTs British Fishes, p. 21.

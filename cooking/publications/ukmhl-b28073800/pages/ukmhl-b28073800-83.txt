THE CARP. 75 time to time ; and, after this has gone on for some time, the fish becomes thin and emaciated, and a red and raw appearance is visible about the abdominal region, caused by the scales being rubbed off from that portion of the body. In many waters that are well adapted for the fattening of carp, they are found to acquire a rank and muddy taint, either from the nature of the soil, or, more probably, from the par- ticular property of some kind of vegetable matter upon which they subsist. This bad effect can be counteracted by placing the fish for a few days in a small pond or stew of clean water. Two other modes have, however, been practised successfully in removing this muddy taste : one is to sew up a piece of bread in the body of the fish when it is undergoing the frying process previously to stewing, the bread being extracted before the fish is transferred into the stewpan; the other, which is the French plan, is to pour a glass of strong vinegar down the throat of the fish whilst it is alive, which produces an instant- aneous exhalation through the pores, which is said to be also greatly facilitated by instantly scaling the fish. The latter part of the proceeding we think had better be dispensed with, or at any rate not attempted so long as the fish has a spark of life remaining in him; after which it is appre-

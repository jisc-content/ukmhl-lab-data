Although held in little repute at the present day, these fish seem to have borne a better character some centuries ago.

The head and belly are said to be the best parts of a bream, whilst, as we have just before observed, the head and back are the best portions of the carp. Breams are dressed in the same manner as the latter fish, and the smaller ones may be fried; but they are rather insipid when cooked in that manner. Another plan is to broil them with the scales on; but even then they are very poor and tasteless. In Ireland the poorer classes cure them by splitting and salting them, and drying them in the sun; and when so cured they eat them with their potatoes. These fish are in best condition from midsum- mer to Michaelmas. Their spawn is harmless, but possesses little flavour. Their spawning time * A pike, or jack.

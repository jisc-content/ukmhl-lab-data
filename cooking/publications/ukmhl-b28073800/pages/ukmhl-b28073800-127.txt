119 THE TUBFISH. sidered the most valuable of the whole of the gurnard tribe. It is capable of being cooked in a great many ways. It is exceedingly good plain- boiled ; and presents a very attractive appearance when prepared in that manner, from the snowy whiteness of its flakes. It is also very good either split and fried, or cut up in quarters, being well- coated with egg and bread-crumbs. It also makes a nice dish either stewed, or baked with a force- neat pudding in its belly. It is not, however, considered equal in flavour to the piper; but which we are inclined to think rather j^roceeds from the greater scarcity of the latter fish. We have often partaken at the same tune of tubfish and pipers, both kinds of which have been cooked in the same manner, and served up at the same time, and we could never detect any difference whatever in flavour between the two fishes; which, after all, is no ill compliment to the piper, the tubfish being in reality so good a fish that even to equal it is no small merit. Tubfish may be found in good order at all times of the year; but, as there is a great difference between fishes of this kind, great care will be required in the selection.

PRAWNS AND SHRIMPS. 135 smaller species has claws like a lobster, but not so large in proportion to the rest of the body; the sea crayfish has no large claws, but possesses slender legs, with a small kind of forceps at the extremity, with which it can give a very severe pinch. Both species resemble a lobster, but do not come up to it in flavour; the smaller being more insipid, and the latter ra- ther too tough and wanting the exquisite rich- ness of flavour for which the lobster is so pre- eminently distinguished. Still, crayfish are by no means to be despised, and when lobsters cannot conveniently be procured, they act very well as substitutes. Their goodness and freshness is tested in the same way as with lobsters. Praicns and Shrimps. Prawns and shrimps are in best order when the females are in roe, the latter being, in fact, the most delicious part of them. When boiled, if they are elastic and spring back upon being pulled by the tails, and the flesh is moist within the shells, well filled out, they are fresh; if dry, tough, and shrunk up, they are stale ; and if soft, slender, and watery, they are in bad condition.

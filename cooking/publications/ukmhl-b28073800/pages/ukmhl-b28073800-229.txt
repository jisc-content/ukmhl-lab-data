HOW TO STEW FISII. 221 * See page 150. be required, and at a time and season when no other kind of fish can possibly be procured. And now for the receipt. Having thoroughly steeped your fish in water, and allowed it to drain, so as to extract the su- perabundant saline particles *, take a piece of the proportionate quantity you require, and boil it gently, until sufficiently done to enable you to pull it in pieces with a fork, which you must do by that means, at the same time taking care to detach all the bones from it. The supply of sauce will, of course, depend upon the quantity of fish it is intended to ac- company. For a moderate-sized piece, four onions, four eggs, and a pint of new milk, and half that quantity of cream, will be sufficient. The onions must be boiled before the sauce is made, and the eggs boiled hard and cut up into slices. Then take some butter rolled in flour, and some mustard, and mix it with the onions and eggs, and let the whole of these boil up gently with the fish for about half an hour. Then take up the wdiole and throw it in a dish, placing sliced hard-boiled egg over it, and gar- nish with sliced lemon.

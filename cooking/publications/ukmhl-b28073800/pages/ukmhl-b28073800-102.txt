Unless a mackerel is in prime order, a narrow black line of an inch or two in length unites the black bars or lines upon the back, a little above the lateral line, and between the tail and the termination of the second back fin. This is termed by scien- tific fisherman “ the rogue’s mark; ” and, although not a proof that the fish is thoroughly out of season, is never found in a fish that is in first-rate condition. When a mackerel is perfectly fresh, the back is of a pale green, the colour bright, and the black bars distinctly marked ; those of the males being nearly straight, whilst those of the females are in a waving line.

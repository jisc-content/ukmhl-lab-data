THE HADDOCK. 19 by the black mark, sometimes a stripe, but more commonly a spot, on each shoulder, vulgarly be- lieved to have been made by the finger and thumb of St. Peter when he took the tribute-money out of the mouth of this fish, and which, as a me- morial of the miracle, has been continued to the whole race of haddocks down to the present day.

It may be dressed either quite fresh or slightly powdered, and it eats agreeably enough when salted either in pickle or dried. The larger the fish the firmer it is, depending of course upon its health and condition; for these fish difler quite as much from each other in their comparative goodness as the codfish, and quite as many bad specimens may be found amongst the one as the other, so that equal attention is necessary in making a selection of either of these fishes. To choose a haddock, pick out one, if you can find any such, that is deep-bodied, thick, and well filled out, rounded at the poll, and elevated on the back; for if sharp ridged, like the top of the roof of a house, and if the form of the fish is lanky and compressed, it is out of season.

129 THE STURGEON. The Sturgeon. This, although a fish of most peaceable disposi- tion, bears an external resemblance to the shark race, particularly in the projecting snout and position of the mouth. A sturgeon, from its large size, is sold and cut up in portions in the fish- mongersâ€™ shops. It is a rich and well-flavoured fish, and exceedingly useful, from its capacity of being cooked in a great variety of ways. Unfor- tunately it is a scarce fish in this country, and consequently, when obtained, is sold at a high price. The proof of goodness is, that the flesh should cut clean, and present a Avhite appearance, strongly contrasted with the blueness both of its veins and gristle; a brown or yellowish cast in these parts denotes the fish to be in bad condition. It is of the hard roe of this fish that caviar is usually composed, although sometimes, as we have previously noticed, it is prepared from the hard roes both of the carp and grey mullet. SECTION XIII. As to the Choice of Salt Eish. The fishes that are usually salted dry, are cod- fish, ling, hake, whiting, and rawlin pollock, silver, whiting, and the torsk or tusk. K

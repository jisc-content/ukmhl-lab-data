150 nOW TO CLEAN AND PRESERVE FISH. care and attention was paid in preparing it for cookery. To prepare a salt fish — a ling, for example, which is by far the best of all fish that can be cured in this manner, — it should lie for six or eight hours at least in a sufficient quantity of fresh water to cover it entirely; being then taken out, it should be scrubbed with a hard brush or a coarse cloth, placed on a clean stone or flat board, and then allowed to drain for six or eight hours more.

Warm milk-and-water is considered to soften and im- prove both the flavour and appearance of the fish. Some persons add vinegar to the water as a means of extracting the salt. Two soakings and one draining are indispensable to render the fish fit for cooking; one soaking, for however long a time (which, by the way, is all the salt fish usually gets), only makes a kind of pickle, in which, as long as the fish remains, it gets rid of very little of its original saltness. Dried cod may be prepared in the same manner as ling; and it must also be observed that the

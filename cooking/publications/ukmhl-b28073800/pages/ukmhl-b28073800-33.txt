POLLOCK AND WHITING. 25 usually of a darker colour, but also in the forma- tion of the jaws; the upper jaw of the whiting projecting beyond the lower one, whilst in both kinds of pollock the lower jaw projects beyond the upper one. The difference between the two kinds of pol- lock may be detected by examining their lateral lines; that of the whiting pollock being of a dark colour and of a curved form, rising towards the middle of the back, and then sinking and running straight towards the tail; whilst in the rawlin pollock the line runs straight along the whole length of the body from gill to tail, and is of a silvery white. Both kinds of pollock attain a large size, the rawlin pollock sometimes reach- ing to forty pounds, the Avhiting pollock to as much as fourteen ; but about half that size may be taken as the usual average of the adult fishes. The rawlin pollock is not held in very high estimation, and has acquired a worse reputation than it deserves from being often met Avith out of season, as the larger fish usually are during the greater part of the summer months. The almost general rule, that “ the larger the size the better the fish” is reversed in the rawlin pollock, the small ones being much the best flavoured. In choosing one of these fish, you must see that it is thick about the poll, Avell rounded over

THE BARBEL. 81 The spawn of all these fishes is wholesome, and is by many considered the best part of them; but it is tasteless, and carries out the old adage of “bad the crow, bad the egg;” and we must also bear in mind, that when these fishes are in spawn they are always out of condition, which may be de- tected by the white, warty excrescences which appear about the head, in the manner we have previously noticed as peculiar to the carp. The Barbel Is so bad a fish, that it is almost rejected by all classes in this country as an article of food; and yet our French neighbours, by dint of good cookery, do contrive to make a very good dish out ot such apparently impracticable materials, dressing it in the same way as the carp. But the spawn, from the poisonous qualities* we have already alluded to, is always rejected. The large barbels are considered the best; and the parts about the head around the tongue, and the pickings about the collar-bones are esteemed the choicest morsels. This fish attains to a respectable size, ranging from between two to five pounds weight. * Ante, p. 77. G

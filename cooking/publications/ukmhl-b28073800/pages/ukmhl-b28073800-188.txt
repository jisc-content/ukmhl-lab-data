THE COOKERY OF FISH. 180 as follows:—Cut the cutlets lengthwise, and not across the body of the fish, of about the length and breadth, but of twice the thickness, of an ordinary veal cutlet, the fish being previously well 'scaled and gutted, and the backbone ex- tracted in the manner we have already pointed out*, but the skin must be retained; then, drying the pieces well in a cloth, cover them plentifully with egg and bread-crumbs, and when dressed serve them up in a clean napkin, and garnish with fried parsley and sliced lemon. Melted butter and the same sauces may be eaten with it as with whiting. The head, backbone, the portions about the fins, and other parts not adapted for cutlets, may, however, be turned to very good account in fur- nishing the materials for a gravy to accompany the cutlets, the directions for making which will be duly given when we come to treat of fish- gravies, — a subject by no means to be passed over lightly, though it is a branch of the art of cookery which people in general know little about, or seldom attempt to carry into practice. * See page 143.

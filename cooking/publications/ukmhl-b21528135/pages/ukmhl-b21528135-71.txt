59 MISCELLANEOUS. 1. Seville Orange Marmalade. Boil fifty oranges entire; change the water they boil in at least three times, to prevent their being too bitter. When they are so tender that a pin’s-head will go through the skin easily, they are done. Take them off one by one, and drain them : be careful that they do not break. As soon as they are nearly cold, weigh them, and to every pound of fruit allow a pound and a half of loaf sugar; then cut the oranges into quarters ; put the pulp on one side, and commence cutting the skins into thin strips with a sharp knife ; this done, remove all the pips, add the pulp and juice to the cut skins, and allow half a pint of water to every pound of fruit; place all on the fire, allowing it to boil until the marmalade becomes clear; place a little on a plate, and if it jellies it is done. There is no need to skim the marmalade, as that wastes it; stir well with a wooden spoon, and especially just before you take it off the fire, and there will be no need for skimming. Place in jars ; when cold, make some paste ; cut papers larger round than the pots ; wet the edges with paste, and place over the jars to exclude the air. This marmalade, which is much more economical than most recipes, will keep good equally long as those which recommend a larger quantity of 3ugar. Note.—It will be found advisable to boil and cut up the oranges one day, and finish making the marmalade the next, as they take a great many hours to become tender, and preparing them afterwards is also a long operation. 2. Blackberry Jelly. To one pound of blackberries allow half a pound of lump sugar; put the blackberries in a jar in the oven, and allow them to bake for some hours ; strain them through coarse muslin; add the sugar to the juice of the blackberries, and also the juice of one lemon ; boil all together ; stir well.

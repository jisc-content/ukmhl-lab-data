ECONOMICAL COOKERY. IG Worcester sauce and a little stock. Mash some potatoes with a little milk, place them on the cod and seasonings in a pie- dish, and bake until the potatoes are nicely browned on the top. Note.—The remains of any fish, or tinned fish of any sort, can be used in this way. 11. Fricandeau of Cod. Bone the remains of cold cod, mix with oyster sauce or a few tinned oysters, anchovy sauce, some spice, cayenne pepper, and salt. Soak several slices of bread in milk, mash them up, and mix with the fish, etc. Place the mixture in a buttered tin, strew bread-crumbs on the top, with a few dabs of butter on them. Bake for an hour. Turn out of the tin and serve. 12. Boiled Pike. Scale and clean one or two small pike ; boil in plenty of salt and water ; about ten minutes before they are done add a cupful of vinegar to the water to make the flesh of the fish firm. Serve with parsley or anchovy butter. Note.—The remains of this fish, well cleared of its many bones, can be served up in many ways,—either curried, or made into rissoles, or like cod pie (Recipe No. 10). 13. Salmon Mayonnaise. Turn out a tin of salmon (preserved), free it from the liquor and bones. Make the following sauce : boil one egg hard, mash the yolk quite smooth with a silver spoon, add to it a teaspoonful of unmade mustard, a small saltspoonful of sugar and salt, cayenne pepper to taste; add some oil, drop by drop, stirring all the while, a little anchovy and Worcester sauce, a tablespoonful of vinegar, and lastly a wineglassful of milk. Pour this sauce over the sahnon ; cover it with young lettuces torn into small pieces, and place over them the white of the egg cut in rings. Note.—The tinned salmon for this dish is actually nicer than the fresh, is more economical, and can be always in readiness for sudden emergencies. 14. Rissoles of Salmon. The contents of one tin of salmon freed from bone and liquor : pepper and salt to taste; sufficient fine bread-crumbs to make

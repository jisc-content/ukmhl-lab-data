ECONOMICAL COOKERY. 3° bones are removed), and fill up the mould with the stock. Make this one day, and turn it out the next. A knuckle of veal done as above, with the addition of two hard-boiled eggs, and a slice or two of cooked ham, is excellent. 53. Jugged Steak. Beat two pounds of steak with a rolling-pin ; place the meat in a jar in the oven, with enough stock thickened with flour to cover it; add an onion with the peel on, a few cloves, pepper, and salt to taste ; bake it for four or five hours. When you dish the steak, pour the gravy over it through a sieve. Note.—The skin of onions colours whatever moat it is placed with, the knowledge of which saves much trouble in all dishes where it is not necessary to slice your onions. 54. Brawn. Take a small pig’s-head, or half a large one with the tongue entire ; put this on to boil with a good handful of salt, until it is so tender that the bones drop from the meat; have ready some powdered spices, cloves, peppercorns, etc., mixed with a good handful of powdered herbs, including sage, but not parsley, and a seasoning of cayenne and black pepper ; free the flesh of the pig’s-head from the bones, and cut it up quickly, so as not to let the fat settle; as you cut it, powder it with the above ingredients ; skin the tongue (which must not boil all the time that the head does, as it is only required to be done through, and to remain firm). At the bottom of your brawn tin, or large mould, place a layer of the seasoned and chopped meat; on this lay the tongue, and cover it over with the remainder of the meat, etc. ; press the top with a weight, and turn out after it has been moulded twelve hours.

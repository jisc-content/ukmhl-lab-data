The ingredients have been chosen with the object of providing a gentle stimulant to the appetite without in any way affecting injuriously the digesti ve organs. They are perfectly pure and innocuous, and this appetising Sauce has been strongly recommended by the medical pro- fession."—Court Journal, Nor. 10th, 1877. ESSENCE OF BEEF. (Similar preparations are also made from MUTTON, from VEAL, and from CHICKEN.) This essence consists solely of the juice of the finest meat, extracted by a gontle heat, without the addition of water or of any other substance whatever. It contains, therefore, the most stimulating and exhilarating properties of the meat, calculated to invigorate the heart and brain immediately, without any fatty or other elements which require solution in the stomach. It has been introduced into medical practice as a stimulant, after loss of blood from any cause, and in cases of nervous exhaustion and enfeebled digestion. It is liquid in warm weather, but in cold weather, or when iced, it takes a jelly form, in which state it is usually preferred. CONCENTBATED BEEF TEA.

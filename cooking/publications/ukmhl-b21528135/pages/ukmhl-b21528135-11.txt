Vll PREFACE. are procurable of most seedsmen, and are to be bought quite as cheaply as other vegetables which take up more space, and are not capable of affording nearly as much nutritious food. The practice of constantly having soup at one’s meals is undeniably an economical one if neither bones nor meat are bought from which to make it. No carefully conducted household should be without a Digester, the cost of which is only four-and-sixpence for one which contains two gallons of stock. Into this useful saucepan every bone which has done its “ duty in the flesh ” should be cast, and allowed to remain in its “ watery grave ” so long as any portion of its nourishment exists. The Digester should be always kept three parts full, and remain beside the fire night and day. "Whenever soup is required, the stock should be first well skimmed, and then placed in a clean saucepan: the Digester meanwhile undergoes a careful inspection; all soft bones are removed, and fresh ones added, if there be any in the house to add; in any case it must again be filled three parts full of water, and returned to its allotted home in one corner of the kitchen range. In conclusion: if your means are small, and your appetite requires tempting with the varied viands which Nature’s bounty proves to be necessary for the good of man, let me beg you to escape from the trammels of the ordinary British fare, and give the following recipes an unprejudiced and honest trial.

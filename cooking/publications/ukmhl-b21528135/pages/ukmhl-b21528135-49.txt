37 VEGETABLES. parsley, pepper, salt, an onion cut np small, and one or two tomatoes sliced, or tomato sauce ; fill each half of the marrow ; bind it with wide tape ; place it in a baking-tin in the oven; baste now and then with dripping. When quite tender, remove it from the oven, take off the tapes, and serve very hot. Note.—This dish, though I have placed it among the vege- tables, is more of an entree—very satisfying and delicious. 36. English Sorrel. Treat it exactly as you would spinach. It is delicious as a breakfast dish, with two or three poached eggs on the top. 37. French Puree of Sorrel. Boil the sorrel with some chopped mushrooms and onions ; drain, and warm up in some thickened stock, with pepper and salt; then serve. 38. Potato Rissoles. Boil and mash some potatoes, add to them finely chopped parsley and onion, salt and pepper. Make them up into balls, and fry. 39. Potato Cakes. Boil and mash some potatoes, add pepper and salt, make them into small flat cakes, dip in egg and bread-crumbs, and fry a light brown. 40. Deviled Potatoes. Any remains of cold potatoes : mash them roughly, and add cayenne and black pepper, and salt. Knead them into a flat surface, fry each side until brown, then serve. 41. Stuffed Potatoes. Take six large raw potatoes; peel them, and scoop out a good deal of the inside ; fill them with minced meat, chopped parsley, a little butter, salt, pepper, and tomato sauce ; place them in a tin, and bake them until they are quite tender. What you take from the insides can be steamed, and then mashed with a little milk, and placed beside the baked potatoes in the shape of small round balls. UNIVERSITY LIBRARY LEEDS

1 SOUPS, 1. Portuguese Soup. Take one pound of pickled pork, and simmer in about two quarts of water. Cut up two large onions, two cabbages cut into quarters, six pieces of pumpkin the same size as the cabbage when quartered (vegetable-marrow will do as a substitute, but is not so rich), two turnips cut in halves, about eight potatoes entire, three or four bits of celery, a few sprigs of common thyme, and a little marjoram. Place all these vegetables in the saucepan with the pickled pork and water, and stew gently until quite tender. When served, break a small quantity of stale bread into the tureen, grate some cheese over it, and moisten with some of the liquor from the soup. Carefully place the vege- tables on the bread, adding some more liquor, and when the tureen is full grate more cheese thickly on the top of the vegetables. The meat is not served up in the soup, but is very nice to eat separately, either hot or cold. 2. Portuguese Bread Soup. Cut up about four onions, and brown them well in some dripping ; add two spoonsful of tomato sauce, some pepper and salt, and some herbs, then as much water as you want soup. Let it boil about three hours. Cut up some pieces of stale bread in a tureen, and pour the soup over it ; let it stand some time, covered up for the bread to soak well, and then grate a little cheese over the top. 3. Pumpkin or Vegetable-marrow Soup. Cut up one large Spanish onion, and place it in a saucepan with some dripping and about six tomatoes (tomato sauce will do if the tomatoes are not procurable), and let the onion brown slightly; add a little water and twelve pieces of pumpkin or vegetable-marrow cut rather small, a sprig of thyme, and popper and salt to taste. Cook it until the vegetables are reduced to pulp.

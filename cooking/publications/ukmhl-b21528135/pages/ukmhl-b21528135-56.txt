ECONOMICAL COOKERY. 44 12. Sweet Chesnuts. Proceed as in the above recipe, but do not allow the chesnuts to mash. When they are tender, take them out carefully, leave the syrup to thicken, and then place the chesnuts in it again for a minute or two. Take the pan off the fire, and arrange the chesnuts on a dish, pouring the syrup (which can be flavoured with essence of vanille) over them. 13. Chesnut Cream. Peel and skin the chesnuts ; boil them in milk until they mash ; pass through a sieve. To one pound of mashed chesnuts add one pint of milk and a quarter of a pound of sugar ; mix all together on the fire until the mixture boils, then add the yolks of two eggs beaten with a little milk ; give a good stir, but do not let it boil for more than a minute, or the eggs will curdle. Take it off the fire, add a teaspoonful of essence of vanille, and stir until the mixture is nearly cold. Place in a glass dish. 14. Apple Shape. Boil some sour apples with a little water until they mash ; pass them through a sieve ; add sugar to sweeten. Have ready an ounce of Nelsonâ€™s gelatine, dissolved overnight in cold water ; add this to the apple pulp, and the juice of one lemon. Place all on the fire ; let it boil ten minutes, stirring all the time. Place in a wetted mould, and turn out next day. 15. Apple Fool. Boil some apples as above ; when mashed, add sugar to taste, the juice of one lemon, and place in a deep glass dish. Beat half a pint of cream, and pour it over the apples. If cream be not obtainable, milk will do ; mix it with the apple, beat it up to make it look frothy, and place in a glass dish. 16. Apple Snow. Bake four large apples ; when they are cold, pass them through a sieve ; add sugar and lemon-juice to taste. Beat up the whites of two eggs into a stiff froth, add the eggs to the apple, etc., and beat until the whole mixture becomes white and thick. Place lightly in a glass dish.

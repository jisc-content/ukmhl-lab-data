41 PUDDINGS AND SWEET DISHES. 1. Abobra Doce (Sweet Pumpkin). ' Cut a pumpkin in pieces, remove the skin and all the inside pips, etc., boil the pieces of pumpkin in water until quite tender (but not smashed at all), strain the pumpkin, and throw away the water it was boiled in ; before boiling the pumpkin, weigh it, and to every pound allow one pound of loaf-sugar ; after the pumpkin is boiled, make a syrup of the sugar—rather less than half a pint of water to one pound of sugar. When the syrup has boded up well, pour it over the pieces of pumpkin, which must be placed in an earthen jar. Every day the pumpkin pieces must be carefully lifted out and placed on a dish, while the syrup is put on the fire and boded up ; carefudy replace the pumpkin into the jar and pour the boding syrup over it; repeat this every day for seven days ; on the eighth day place the pieces of pumpkin as wed as the syrup in the preserving-pan, and let both bod up, then remove the pan from the fire, take out the pieces of pumpkin, and when nearly cold wash each piece in cold water, then arrange them on drainers for a few minutes, afterwards place them on a wooden tray (the paste-board does very wed), and put them down inside the kitchen fender, where they can candy and dry quickly.

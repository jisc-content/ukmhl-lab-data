VEGETABLES. 1. Portuguese Eice and Cabbage. Chop a large cabbage into small pieces (as you would do lettuces for salad), put this on to boil for a few minutes ; change the water twice. When the third water (which should not be more than the rice will take up) boils, add a teacupful of rice, some salt and pepper. When the rice is nearly done, stir in a good-sized piece of dripping. Note.—This is a favourite dinner with the peasants of Madeira, and with us is greatly esteemed eaten with any cold meat. 2. Milho, or Indian Corn finely ground. Mix one pound and six ounces of milho powder with three quarts of cold water ; stir slowly from time to time in the sauce- pan until it boils ; as soon as it boils quickly, throw in little by little half a pound more of raw milho, stirring all the while to prevent its being lumpy. When it is nearly done, throw in a piece of butter or dripping (not more than one ounce) and two teaspoonsful of salt. It must boil for at least half an hour after you put in the raw corn. Note.—This milho, or Indian corn, is easily procurable in England. Some people buy the whole corn, and have it ground at home, but that of course entails trouble.

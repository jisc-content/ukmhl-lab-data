ADDENDA Wherever haricot beans are used in cooking, it is necessary to soak them first in cold water for twelve hours. Where colouring is required, either in stews or hashes, let the onion used have its outer skin left on, and neither burnt sugar nor any other coloured matter will be required. To prevent greens from either smelling or tasting strong, place a crust of dry bread in the water in which they are boiled ; and to keep the greens a good colour, put a spoonful of brown sugar into the water instead of soda. Fruit puddings with suet crust should always have a sprinkling of soft sugar placed on the buttered surface of the basin before the crust is laid in. This makes them look richer, and forms a thick sauce which flows over the pudding when it is turned out of the basin. I am much obliged to my kind critic of The Queen, who points out a material omission in the recipe for £ ‘ Bouillabaisse ” —Tomatoes. It is certainly much improved by the addition of two or three, or if not to be had, Tomato sauce might be used as a substitute. In this unfortunate season, when good cooking apples are so scarce and dear, I cannot too strongly recommend the American tinned apples. I always use those put up by the “ Oneida Community.” The large tins are most economical, as they keep well for quite a week after they are opened. They each contain about 7 lb. of peeled, cored, and half-cooked apples. Hazell, Watson, and Viney, Printers, London and Aylesbury.

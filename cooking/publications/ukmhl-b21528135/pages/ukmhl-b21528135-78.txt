66 ECONOMICAL COOKERY. 29. Fondue or Cheese Pudding-. A teacupful of grated cheese, a cup and a half of bread-crumbs, and a little cayenne pepper : mix these ingredients, and pour on them one pint of boiling milk, adding a small bit of butter (size of a walnut). When the mixture is nearly cold, add two well-beaten eggs ; butter a pie-dish, pour in the above, and bake until it begins to brown. Serve at once, or it will fall. 30. Potato Cheese. Cut some boiled potatoes (cold) in slices, and lay them in a pie-dish which has been well buttered, then add some cheese cut in slices, a few dabs of butter, and a little unmade mustard, on this some slices of cold potato, and so on until the pie-dish is nearly full. Pour over all one pint of milk, and bake in a quick oven for an hour. 31. French Omelette. Twq eggs : beat the whites and the yolks separately ; to the yolks add a teaspoonful of chopped onion and one of chopped parsley, some pepper and salt ; mix well, and add the stiff whites ; have ready some boiling Australian marrow in a frying-pan, throw in the mixture, and fry until the lower side is yellowish brown and the upper side begins to set; fold it in half, but do not turn it, and serve very hot. 32. “ Perada,” or Pear Jam. To every three pounds of pears, weighed after they are peeled and cored, allow one pound of loaf-sugar; place the pears and sugar in a preserving-pan ; stir well until the sugar melts, or the jam will be burnt.

Fill your jars, and when cold cover them with paper wetted with paste round the edges. 33. Swiss Recipe for Orang-e Marmalade.

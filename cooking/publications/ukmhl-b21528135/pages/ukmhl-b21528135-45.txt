VEGETABLES. 33 some butter, salt, and pepper; tie in a floured cloth, and boil three hours. If any of this pudding remain, it is very nice cut into thick slices and fried in dripping for next day’s dinner. 10. Lentils Fricasseed. Have ready a dish of boiled lentils and onions (the onions having been sliced and boiled with the lentils), add salt and pepper, a bit of butter, and some thickened gravy. Simmer gently for half an hour, then serve. 11. Spanish Tomatoes. Cut some large tomatoes in half; take out the insides, and make a forcemeat of chopped ham, parsley, a little garlic or onion, some salt, and cayenne. Fill both halves of the tomatoes, and bind each one with a piece of tape. Bake in the oven, with a little lard or oil in the tin. 12. Spanish Baked Tomatoes. Choose some equal-sized smooth tomatoes; cut off the tops; put in some salt, black pepper, a little lard, and a few fine bread- crumbs. The inside of the tomato is not removed. They will take about half an hour to bake. 13. Tomato Puree. Boil some tomatoes ; when tender, pass them through a sieve ; boil them again in some stock, with butter, pepper, and salt. Let them simmer twenty minutes, then serve. 14. Boiled Chesnuts. Cut as many chesnuts as you require half-way down each side from the thin end ; put them into a saucepan of boiling water in which a large lump of salt has been placed ; let them boil twenty minutes ; drain them as you would potatoes, and serve in their skins. At table you eat butter and salt with them. Note.—This makes a most nourishing meal. In my house it frequently takes the place of pudding at dinner, and is par- ticularly appreciated by children. 15. Haricot Beans. Soak all night; boil in salt and water ; drain them well; place in a vegetable-dish, with a small piece of butter in the middle. 3

ECONOMICAL COOKERY. i6 MEAT. 1. Tortas. Mince any sort of cold meat, mix with it some finely chopped parsley, salt and pepper, and a little gravy wherewith to bind the “ tortas.” Make them into flat cakes, dip them in egg, and fry them a light brown colour. Note.—A small mincing-machine is almost indispensable when economy of servants’ labour is a consideration. Mincing- machines are by no means expensive, and will last a lifetime with moderate care. 2. African “ Babotie.” One onion, one cupful of milk, one thick slice of bread, six sweet almonds blanched and pounded, two eggs, any sort of meat minced, one small spoonful of currie-powder, a little bit of butter, pepper and salt. Set a slice of bread to soak in the milk, pound the almonds, fry the onion after cutting it up very finely, beat two eggs and add to them the milk which remains from the cupful, part of which was used for soaldng the bread ; mix these ingredients well together, and add the minced meat, currie-powder, butter, salt and pepper. Rub a pie-dish with a lemon or some vinegar, put in the mixture, and bake half an hour. It should look like a custard pudding when taken out of the oven. 3. Dormers. Boil half a pound of rice, drain it, and when cold add a quarter of a pound of suet, and some scraps of any sort of cold meat (about a pound), both minced very fine ; add some pepper and salt, and mix all well together, wetting with gravy or stock of any kind ; roll them up in the shape of sausages, and fry in boiling dripping. To be served either dry or with a nice thick gravy poured over them.

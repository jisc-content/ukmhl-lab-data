Soak a packet of Nelson’s gelatine in half a pint of cold water for ten minutes ; add half a pint of boiling water, stir until the gelatine is dissolved; add two wine-glasses of raisin or ginger wine, half a pound of sugar, and some lemon-peel; boil all together for five minutes ; take it off the fire, stir in a few drops of cochineal to make it a pretty colour, then pour into a wetted mould. 9. Sago Shape. Boil a small cup of sago in a pint of milk, add a quarter of a pound of sugar, and some cinnamon to flavour, and half a pint more milk in which half an ounce of gelatine has been dissolved.

Boil a cupful of rice in a quart of milk, adding sugar to taste, lemon-rind, and a small pinch of salt, until the mixture is suffi- ciently thick. Place in a mould, and turn out next day. 11. Chesnut Shape. Peel the chesnuts from their shells (about one quart), then throw them into boiling water for a few minutes to rid them of all inner skin ; when quite freed, make a syrup with a pound of sugar, a pint of water, and some lemon-juice, and boil the chesnuts in the syrup until they mash. Pass all through a sieve, place in a mould, and turn out next day.

Five minutes before dinner beat up the yolks of two eggs in a bowl, adding gradually some of the soup to them, and then put the mixture back near the fire to simmer. Grate a very little nutmeg into the tureen, and pour the soup on it. 13. Barley Soup. Two quarts of stock, a quarter of a pound of pearl barley, parsley, four onions, salt and pepper.

NOTE TO SECOND EDITION, IN once again bringing my little book before tbe public, I beg sincerely to thank all those friends who have so generously tried to help me by placing their manuscript recipe-books at my disposal. At the same time I am bound to confess that in only a very few instances have I been able conscientiously to add to my previous collection, under the strict denomination of “ Economical Cookery.” The art of cooking, which was formerly delegated only to cooks and kitchen-maids, is now being acquired by ladies, so that such dishes as could once only be enjoyed by the rich, may now with a little judicious modification be seen on the tables of the poorer classes as well. I have in many instances not specified exact quantities in my recipes : e.g., “ two or three eggs ” indicates that eggs must be used in the recipe given, but if eggs happen to be dear, two will do instead of three, and in many cases perhaps only one: the same of butter; when I say “a piece of butter,” I mean as much or as little to be used as circumstances will permit; for this reason— my book is intended for the mistress of a family who wishes to study economy. One word I must here say in defence of my frequent use of garlic, an article so seldom mentioned in English cookery-books, and still less often found in English homes. In very moderate doses,—so moderate that its one objection of making the breath unpleasant is unnoticed,—there is scarcely any savoury dish but to which it imparts that “nameless something” which makes foreign cookery so nice and tasty, and the want of which makes ordinary English dishes so insipid. In conclusion, I would beg my lady readers to study w’ell the subject of cookery in all its branches, there being nothing menial, nothing derogatory to their dignity, in knowing how to cook, and how to make the nicest things with the least expensive materials. 1 KATE ADDISON.

PIES, PUDDINGS, AND PASTE V. HS Veal {or Chicken) and Parsley Pie. Cut some slices from the leg or neck of veal; if the leg, from about the knuckle. Season them with salt •, scald some parsley that is picked from the stems, and squeeze it dry; cut it a little, and lay it at the bottom of the dish j then put the meat, and so on, in layers. Fill the dish with new milk, but not so high as to touch the crust. Cover it; and when baked, pour out a little of the milk, and put in half a pint of good scalded cream.—Chicken may be cut up skinned, and made in the same way. Veal-olive Pie.

Half boil the head, and cut it into square bits; put a layer of ham at the bottom • then some head, first fat, then lean, with balls and hard eggs cut in half, and so on till the dish be full; but be particularly careful not to place the pieces close, or the pie will be too solid, and there will be no space for the jelly. The meat must be first pretty well seasoned with pepper and salt, and a scrape or two of nutmeg. Put a little water and a little gravy into the dish, and cover it with a tolerably thick crust; bake it in a slow oven, and, when done, pour into it as much gravy as it can possibly hold, and do not cut it till perfectly cold; in doing which, observe to use a very [sharp knife, and first cut out a large piece, going down to the bottom of the dish; and wlien done thus, thinner slices

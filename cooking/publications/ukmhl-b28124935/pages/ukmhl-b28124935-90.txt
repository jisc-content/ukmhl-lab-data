DOMESTIC COOKERY. 86 Mutton Steaks Should be cut from a loin or neck that has hung ; if a neck, the bones should not be long.

Steaks of Mutton, or Lamb, and Cuciwibers. Quarter cucumbers, and lay them into a deep dish, sprinkle them with salt, and pour vinegar over them.

Take a pound of the rawest part of a leg of mutton that has been either roasted or boiled; chop it extremely small, and season it with pepper, salt, mace, and nutmeg; add to it six ounces of beef-suet, some sweet herbs, two anchovies, and a pint of oysters, all chopped very small; a quarter of a pound of grated bread, some of the anchovy-liquor, and the yolks and whites of two eggs well beaten. Put it all, when well mixed, into a little pot; and use it by rolling it into balls or sausage- shape, and frying. If approved, a little shalot may be added, or garlic, which is a great improvement.

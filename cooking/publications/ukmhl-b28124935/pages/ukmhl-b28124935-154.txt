Vegetable Pie. Scald and blanch some broad beans; cut carrots, turnips, artichoke-bottoms, mushrooms, peas, onions, lettuce, parsley, celery, or any of them you have; make the whole into a nice stew, with some good veal-gravy.

Lay a fowl, or a few bones of the scrag of veal, seasoned, in a dish; scald a cullender-full of picked parsley in milk ; season it \ and add it to the fowl or meat, with a tea-cupful of any sort of good broth, or weak gravy. When it is baked, pour into it a quarter of a pint of cream scalded, with .the size of a walnut of butter and a bit of flour. Shake it round, to mix with the gravy already in. Lettuces, white mustarileaves, or spinach, may be added to the parsley, and scalded before put in. 7'urnip Pie.

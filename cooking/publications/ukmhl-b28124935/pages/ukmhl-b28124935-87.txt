Take off the chump end of the loin, butter some paper and put over it, and then a paste as for venison; roast it two hours. Do not let it be the least brown.

Take off some of the fat, and cut the middle or best end of the neck into rather thin steaks; flour and fry them in their own fat of a fine light brown, but not enough for eating. Then put them into a dish while you fry the carrots, turnips, and onions ; the carrots and turnips in dice, the onions sliced ; but they must only be warmed, not browned, or you need not fry them. Then lay the steaks at the bottom of a stewpan, the vegetables over them, and pour as much boiling water as will just cover them ; give one boil, skim well, and then set the pan on the side of the fire to simmer gently till tender. In three or four hours skim them ; and add pepper, salt, and a spoonful of ketchup. To hash Mutton.

Serve in a covered dish. Instead of onion, a clove, a spoonful of currant-jelly, and half a glass of port wine will given an agreeable flavour of venison, if the meat be fine.

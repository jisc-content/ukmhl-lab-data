POULTRY. 93 111 dressing wild-fowl, be careful, to keep a clear brisk fire. Let them be done of a fine yellow-brown, but leave the gravy in ; the fine flavour is lost if done too much. Tame fowls require more roasting, and are longer in heating through than others. All sorts should be continually basted; that they may be served with a froth, and appear of a fine colour. A large fowl will take three-quarters of an hour; a middling one half an hour; and a very small one, or a chicken, twenty minutes. The fire must â€¢ be very quick and clear before any fowls are put down. A capon will take from thirty to thirty- five minutes; a goose an hour; wild ducks, a quarter of an hour 3 pheasants, twenty minutes ; a small turkey stuffed, an hour and a quarter; turkey-poults, twenty minutes; grouse, a quarter of an hour; quails, ten minutes ; and partridges, from twenty to twenty-five minutes. A hare will take near an hour, and the hind part requires most heat. Pigs and geese require a brisk fire, and quick turning. Hares and rabbits must be well attended to, and the extremities brought to the quick part of the fire, to be done equally with the backs. POULTRY. To boil Turkey. Make a stuffing of bread, herbs, salt, pepper, nutmeg, lemon-peel, a few oysters or an anchovy, a bit of butter, some suet, and an egg; put this into the crop, fasten up the skin, and boil the turkey in a floured cloth to make it very white. Have ready a fine oyster-sauce made rich with butter, a little cream, and a spoonful of soy, if approved, and pour it over the bird ; or liver and lemon-sauce. Hen birds are best for boiling, and should be young.

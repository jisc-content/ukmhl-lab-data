DOMESTIC COOKERY. 66 Or, boiled and eaten with bacon and greens. The best end may be either roasted, broiled as steaks, or made into pies. Neck of Veal a la braise. Lard the best end with bacon rolled in parsley chopped fine, salt, pepper, and nutmeg; put it into a tosser, and cover it with water. Put to it the scrag end, a little lean bacon or ham, an onion, two carrots, two heads of celery, and about a glass of Madeira wine. Stew it quick two hours, or till it is tender, but not too much. Strain off the liquor; mix a little flour and butter in a stewpan till brown, and lay the veal in this, the upper side to the bottom of the pan. Let it be over the fire till it gets coloured : then lay it in the dish, stir some of the liquor in and boil it up, skim it nicely, and squeeze orange or lemon juice into it. Breast of Veal. Before roasted, if large, the two ends may be taken off and fried to stew, or the whole may be roasted. Butter should be poured over it. If any be left, cut the pieces into handsome sizes, put them into a stewpan, and pour some broth over it; or, if you have no broth, a little water will do; add a bunch of herbs, a blade or two of mace, some pepper, and an anchovy; stew till the meat is tender, thicken with butter and flour, and add a little ketchup; or the whole breast may be stewed, after cutting off the two ends. Serve the sweetbread whole upon it, either stewed or par- boiled, and then covered with crumbs, herbs, pepper, and salt, and browned in a Dutch-oven. If you have a few mushrooms, truffles, and morels, stew them with it, and serve. Boiled breast of veal, smothered with onion-sauce is an excellent dish, if not cold or too fat.

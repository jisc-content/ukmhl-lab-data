DOMESTIC COOKERY. 126 SAUCES, ETC. A very good Sauce, especially to hide the bad Colour of Fowls. Cut the livers, slices of lemon in dice, scalded parsley and liard eggs ; add salt, and mix them with butter, boil them up, and pour over the fowls. This will do for roast rabbit. White Sauce for-Fricassee of Foivls, Rabbits, White Meat, Fish, or Vegetables. It is seldom necessary to buy meat for this favourite sauce, as the proportion of that flavour is but small. The water that has boiled fowls, veal, or rabbit, or a little broth that may be in the house, or the feet and neck of chickens, or raw or dressed veal, will suffice. Stew with a little water any of these, with a bit of lemon-peel, some sliced onion, some white peppercorns, a little pounded mace, or nutmeg, and a bunch of sweet herbs, until the flavour be good, then strain it, and add a little good cream, a piece of butter, and a little flour; salt to your taste. A squeeze of lemon may be added after the sauce is taken off the fire, shaking it well. Yolk of egg is often used in fricassee, but if you have any cream, it is better, as the former is apt to curdle. Sa^ue for Wild Fowl. Simmer a tea-cupful of port wine, the same quantity of good meat-gravy, a little shalot, a little pepper, salt, a grate of nut- meg, and a bit of mace, for ten minutes ; put in a bit of butter and flour, give it all one boil, and pour it through the birds. In general they are not stuffed as tame, but may be done so if liked. Another for the sa?ne, or for Ducks, Serve a rich gravy in the dish ; cut the breast into slices, but do not take them off; cut a lemon, and put pepper and salt on

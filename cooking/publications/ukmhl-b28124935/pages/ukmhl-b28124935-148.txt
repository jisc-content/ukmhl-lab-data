Beefsteak Pic. ^ Prepare the steaks ; beat, flour, and season, and when rolled with fat in each, put them in a dish with puff paste round the edges; put a little water in the dish, and cover it with a good crust. N.B.—For beaf-steak pudding, do the same; cover with a cloth, and boil slowly for a length of time. Veal Pie. Take some of the middle, or scrag, of a small neck; season it; and either put to it, or not, a few slices of lean bacon or ham. If it is wanted of a high relish, add mace, cayenne, and nutmeg, to the salt and pepper ; and also forcemeat and eggs ; and if you choose, add truffles, morels, mushrooms, sweetbreads cut into small bits, and cockscombs blanched, if liked. Have a rich gravy ready, to pour in after baking.—It will be very good without any of the latter additions. A rich Veal Pie. Cut steaks from a neck or breast of veal; season them with pepper, salt, nutmeg, and a very little clove in powder. Slice two sweetbreads, and season them in the same manner. Lay a puff paste on the ledge of the dish ; then put the meat, yolks of hard eggs, the sweetbreads, and some oysters, up to the top of the dish. I^ay over the whole some very thin slices of ham, and fill the dish with water ; cover; and when it is taken out of the oven, pour in at the top, through a funnel, a few spoon- fuls of good veal-gravy, and some cream to fill up; but first boil it up with a tea-spoonful of flour. Truffles, etc., if approved.

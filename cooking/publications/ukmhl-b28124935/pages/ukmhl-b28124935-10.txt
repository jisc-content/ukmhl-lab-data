INTRODUCTION. 6 despise the knowledge and understanding of what to do with her husband’s money when she comes to deal with market or store in making provision for the daily meals. Many persons will say that such knowledge is of the first importance for those women, at least, who look forward to inarriage as their proper sphere. The highest mental culture will not prevent heartburnings at home, and a number of concomitant troubles, where the “ helpmeet ” is above giving proper attention to the value of money and such other little matters which somebody must suiDerintend if husband and children are to be healthy and happy. Girls are not born with a knowledge of how to control servants, keep the house clean and dainty, and devise home comforts. Many well-meaning girls marry without even those meagre hints from their mothers which would smooth the difficulties of the first few months; others unmarried, with invalid or busy parents, are obliged to take charge of the household at a very early age. To such, a book full of motherly hints from a capable housekeeper will be as welcome as any tale of deeds of valour, and “ hair-breadth escapes, and moving accidents by flood and field.” “ Housekeeping,” which the foolish may deride, means, on the woman’s side, much vigilance, much mental strain, much self-sacrifice. Some men who find the wheels run smooth, they know not how, forget to give the weaker vessel credit for what she knows and does. Most, however, are warmly grateful, and recognize the importance of the angel in the house who is not too angelic to know what goes on in the kitchen. I think, without further preamble, I can invite every housewife to invest in this most useful and suggestive threepennyworth. This issue contains the meat recipes only, as the pilces de resistance of every dinner. I intend to publish, as a sequel, recipes for sweets and dessert, together with a variety of vegetable and savoury dishes. H. R. HAWEIS.

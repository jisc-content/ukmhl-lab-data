139 SAUCES. At many tables- where everything else is well done, it is common to find very bad stuffing. According to what it is wanted for, should be the selection from the following list, observing that of the most pungent articles, least must be used. No one flavour should predomi- nate greatly; yet, if several dishes be served the same day, there should be a marked variety in the taste of the forcemeat, as well as of the gravies. It should be consistent enough to cut with a knife, but not dry and heavy. Forcemeat Ingredmits. Cold fowl or veal. Scraped ham. Fat bacon. Beef-suet. Crumbs of bread. Parsley. White pepper. Salt. Nutmeg. Yolk and white of eggs well beaten, to bind the mi.x- ture. Oysters. Anchovy. Tarragon. Savory. Pennyroyal. Knotted marjoram. Thyme. Basil. Yolks of hard eggs. Cayenne. Garlic. Shalot. Chives. Jamaica pepper, in fine powder, or two or three cloves. The first column contains the articles of which the forcemeat may be made, without any striking flavour; and to those may be added some of the different ingredients of the second column, to vary the taste. .

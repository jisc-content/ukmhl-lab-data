The butcher should take out the kernels in the neck-pieces where the shoulder-clod is taken off, two from each round of beef, and one in the middle, which is called the popeâ€™s-eye ; the other from the flap j there is also one in the thick flank, in the middle of the fat. If these are not taken out, especially in the summer, salt will be of no use for keeping the meat sweet. There is another kernel between the rump and the edge-bone. As the butchers seldom attend to this matter, the cook should take out the kernels j and then rub the salt well into such beef as is for boiling, and slightly sprinkle that which is for roasting.

To salt Beef or Pork for eating immediately. The piece should not weigh more than five or six pounds. Salt it very thoroughly just before you put it,into the pot, take a coarse cloth, flour it well, put the meat in, and fold it up close. Put it into a pot of boiling water, and boil it as long as you would any other salt beef of the same size, and it will be as salt as if done four or five days.

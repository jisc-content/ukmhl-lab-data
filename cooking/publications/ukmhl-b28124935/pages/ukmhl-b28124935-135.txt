f 131 SAUCES. The old Curra7it Sauce for Ve7iison. Boil an ounce of dried currants in half a pint of water for a few minutes j then add a small tea-cupful of bread-crumbs, six cloves, a glass of port wine, and a bit of butter. Stir it till the whole is smooth. Leni07i Sauce. Cut thin slices of lemon into very small dice, and put them in melted butter; give it one boil, and pour it over boiled fowls. Carrier Sauce for Mutto7i. Chop six shalots fine; and boil them up with a gill of gravy, a spoonful of vinegar, some pepper and salt. Serve in a boat. Ha77i Sauce. When a ham is almost done with, pick all the meat clean from the bone, leaving out any rusty part; beat the meat and the bone to a mash with a rolling-pin; put it in a sailcepan, with three spoonfuls of gravy; set it over a slow fire, and stir it all the time, or it will stick to the bottom. When it has been on some time, put to it a small bundle of sweet herbs, some pepper, and half a pint of beef-gravy; cover it up, and let it stew over a gentle fire. When it has a good flavour of the herbs, strain off the gravy. A little of this is an improvement to all gravies. A very fi7ie Fish Sauce. Put into a very nice tin saucepan a pint of fine port wine, a gill of mountain, half a pint of fine walnut-ketchup, twelve anchovies, and the liquor that belongs to them, a gill of walnut- pickle, the rind and juice of a large lemon, four or five shalots, some cayenne to taste, three ounces of scraped horse-radish, three blades of mace, and two tea-spoonfuls of made mustard; boil it all gently till the rawness goes off; then put it into small bottles for use. Cork them very close, and seal the top.

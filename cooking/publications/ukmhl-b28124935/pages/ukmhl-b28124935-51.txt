MEATS. 47 Boiling in a well-floured cloth will make meat white. Particular care must be taken that the pot is well skimmed the moment it boils, otherwise the foulness will be dispersed over the meat. The more soups or broth are skimmed, the better and cleaner they will be. The boiler, etc., should be kept delicately clean. Put the meat into cold water, but flour it well first. Meat boiled quick will be hard j but care must be taken that in boiling slow it does not stop, or the meat will be underdone. If the steam is kept in, the water will not lessen much; therefore, when you wish it to boil away, take off the cover of the soup-pot. Vegetables should not be dressed with the meat, except carrots or pai'snips with boiled beef. As to the length of time required for roasting ajid boiling, the size of the joint must direct; as also the strength of the fire, the nearness of the meat to it, and in boiling, the regular though slow progress it makes j for if the cook, when told to hinder the copper from boiling quick, lets it stop from boiling up at all, the usual time will not be sufficient, and the meat will be underdone. Weigh the meat; and allow for all solid joints a quarter of an hour for every pound, and some minutes (from ten to twenty) over, according as the family like it done. A ham of twenty pounds will take four hours and a half, and others in proportion. A tongue, if dry, takes four hoursâ€™ slow boiling, after soaking; a tongue out of pickle, from two hours and a half to three hours, or more if very large; it must be judged by feeling whether it is very tender. A leg of pork, or of lamb, takes the allowance of twenty minutes above a quarter of ah hour to a pound. In roasting, beef of ten pounds will take above two hours and a half; twenty pounds will take about three hours and three quarters.

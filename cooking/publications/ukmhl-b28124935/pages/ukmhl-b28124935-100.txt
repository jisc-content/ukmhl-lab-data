96 DOMESTIC COOKERY. A nice way to dress a Fowl for a small dish. Bone, singe, and wash a young fowl; make a forcemeat of four ounces of veal, two ounces of scraped lean of ham, two ounces of fat bacon, two hard yolks of eggs, a few sweet herbs chopped, two ounces of beef-suet, a tea-spoonful of lemon-peel minced quite fine, an anchovy, salt, pepper, and a very little cayenne. Beat all in a mortar, with a tea-cupful of crumbs and the yolks and whites of three eggs. Stuff the inside of the fowl, and draw the legs and wings inwards; tie the neck and rump close. Stew the fowl in a white gravy; when it is done through and tender, add a large cupful of cream and a bit of butter and flour; give it one boil, and serve; the last thing, add the squeeze of a lemon. To force Fozvl, etc.., Is to stuff any part with forcemeat, and it is put usually between the skin and flesh. To braise, Is to put meat into a stewpan covered with fat bacon, then add six or eight onions, a faggot of herbs, carrots if to be brown, celery, any bones, or trimmings of meat or fowls, and some stock (which you will find among Soups and Gravies). The bacon must be covered with paper, and the lid of the pan must be put down close. Set it on a slow stove, and according to what it is, it will require two or three hours. The meat is then to be taken out j and the gravy very nicely skimmed, and set on to boil very quick till it is thick. The meat is to be kept hot; and if larded, put into the oven for a few minutes ; and then put the jelly over it, which is called glazing, and is used for ham, tongue, and many made dishes. White wine is added to some glazing. The glaze should be of a beautiful clear yellow-brown, and it is best to put it on ^Yith a nice brush.

DOMESl'IC COOKERY. 114 pound of pickled pork, in three quarts of water, till quite tender. On first boiling, skim. Half an hour before serving, add a lobster, or crab, cleaned from the shells. Season with salt and cayenne. A small quantity of rice should be put in with the meat. Some people choose very small suet-dumplings boiled with it. Should any fat rise, skim nicely, and put half a cup of water with a little flour. Pepper-pot may be made of various things, and is understood to be a due proportion of fish, flesh, fowl, vegetables and pulse. Tu7‘nip Soup. Take off a knuckle of veal all the meat that can be made into cutlets, etc., and set the remainder on to stew with an onion, a bunch of herbs, a blade of mace, and five pints of water; cover it close; and let it do on a slow fire four or five hours. Strain and set it by till next day \ then take the fat and sediment from it, and simmer it with turnips cut into small dice till tender, seasoning it with salt and pepper. Befoi’e serving rub down half a spoonful of flour with half a pint of good cream, and the size of a walnut of butter. Let a small roll simmer in the soup till wet through, and serve this with it. It should be as thick as middling cream. Pea Soup. Save the water of boiled pork or beef; and if too salt, put as much fresh water to it; or use fresh water entirely with roast-beef bones, a ham or gammon-bone, or an anchovy or two. Simmer these with some good whole or split peas \ the smaller the quantity of water at first, the better. Simmei ti I the peas wall pulp through a cullender; then set the pulp, and more of the liquor that boiled the peas, wath two carrots, a turnip, a' leek, and a atick of celery cut into bits, to stew till all is quite tender. The last requires less time; an hour will do for it.

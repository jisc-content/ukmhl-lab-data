SOUPS. ”5 ^Vhen ready, put fried bread cut into dice, dried mint rubbed pfine, pepper, and (if wanted) salt into the tureen, and pour the soup in. Green-pea Soup. In shelling-the peas, divide the old from the young; put the old ones, with an ounce of butter, a pint of water, the outside leaves of a lettuce or two, two onions, pepper, and salt, to stew till you can pulp the peas ; and when you have done so, put to the liquor that stewed them, some more water, the hearts and tender stalks of the lettuces, the young peas, a handful of spinach cut small, and salt and pepper to relish properly, and stew till quite soft If the soup is thin, or not rich enough, either of these faults may be removed by adding an ounce or two of butter, mixed with a spoonful of rice or wheat-flour, and boiled with it half an hour. Before serving, boil some green mint shred fine in the soup. ■When there is plenty of vegetables, no meat is necessary; but if meat be preferred, a pig’s foot, or ham-bone, etc., may be boiled with the old peas, which is called the stock. More butter than is mentioned above may be used with advantage, if the soup is required to be very rich. When peas first come in, or are very young, the stock may be made of the shells, washed and boiled till they will pulp with the above ; more thickening will then be wanted. Gravy Soup. Wash and soak a leg*of beef; break the bone, and set it on the fire with a gallon of water, a large bunch of sweet herbs, two large onions sliced and fried a fine brown (but not burnt), two blades of mace, three cloves, twenty berries of allspice, and forty black peppers. Stew till the soup is as rich as you choose; then take out the meat, which will be fit for the servants’ table with a little of the gravy. Next day take off the cake of fat, which will serve for basting, or for common pie- crust. Have ready such vegetables as you choose to serve.

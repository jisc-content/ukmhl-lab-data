92 DOMESTIC COOKERY. in their size, because a full crop is as large as the whole body of a small pigeon. The Avood-pigeon is large, and the flesh dark-coloured; if properly kept, and not over-roasted, the flavour is equal to teal. Serve with a good gravy. Plovers.—Choose those that feel hard at the vent, which shows they are fat. In other respects, choose them by the same marks as other fowl. When stale, the feet are dry. They will keep sweet a long time. There are three sorts : the grey, green, and bastard plover, or lapwing. Hare or Rabbit.—If the claws are blunt and rugged, the ears dry and tough, and the haunch thick, it is old; but if the claws are smooth and sharp, the ears easily tear, and the cleft in the lip is not much spread, it is young. If fresh and newly killed, the body will be stiff, and in hares the flesh pale. But they keep a good while by proper care; and are best when rather beginning to turn, if the inside is preserved from being musty. To know a real leveret, you should look for a knob or small bone near the foot on its fore leg; if there is none it is a hare. Partridges.—They are in high season in autumn. If young, the bill is of a dark colour, and the legs yellowish; if fresh, the vent will be firm; but this part will look greenish if stale. Pheasants.—The cock-bird is accounted best, except when the hen is with egg. If young, he has short blunt or round spurs ; but if old, they are long and sharp.

The cook must be careful, in drawing poultry of all sorts, not to break the gall-bag, for no washing will take off the bitter where it has touched.

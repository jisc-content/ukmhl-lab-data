GENERAL REMARKS. In every rank, those deserve the greatest praise who best acquit themselves of the duties which their station requires. In the variety of female acquirements, though domestic occupations stand not so high in esteem as they formerly did, yet, when neglected, they produce much human misery. There was a time when ladies knew nothing beyond their own family concerns; but, in the present day, there are many who know nothing about them. Instances, however, may be found of ladies in the higher walks of life, who condescend to examine the accounts of their house-steward; and, by overlooking and wisely directing the expenditure of that part of their husbandâ€™s income which falls under their own immediate inspection, avoid the inconveniences of embarrassed circumstances. How much more necessary, then, is domestic knowledge in those whose limited fortunes press on their attention considerations of the strictest economy! We sometimes bring up children in a manner calculated rather to fit them for the station we wish, than that which it is likely they will actually possess : and it is in all cases worth the while of parents to consider whether the expectation or hope of raising their offspring above their own situation be well-founded. It frequently happens, that before impressions of duty are made on the mind, ornamental education commences; and it ever after takes the lead: thus, what should be only the embellishment, becomes the main business of life. There is no opportunity of attaining a knowledge of family management at school; and during vacation, all si^jects that might interfere with amusement are avoided.

97 POULTRY. Fricassee of Chickens. Boil rather more than half, in a small quantity of water ; let them cool; then cut up, and put to simmer in a little gravy made of the liquor they were boiled in, and a bit of veal or mutton, onion, mace, and lemon-peel, some white pepper, and a bunch of sweet herbs. When quite tender, keep them hot while you thicken the sauce in the following manner : Strain it off, and put it back into the saucepan with a little salt, a scrape of nutmeg, and a bit of flour and butter ; give it one boil; and when you are going to serve, beat up the yolk of an egg, add half a pint of cream, and stir them over the fire, but do not let it boil. It will be quite as good without the egg. The gravy may be made (without any other meat) of the necks, feet, small wing-bones, gizzards, and livers \ which are called the trimmings of the fowl. To pull Chickens. Take off the skin; and pull the flesh off the bone of a cold fowl with a fork, in as large pieces as you can ; dredge it with flour, and fry it of a nice brown in butter. Drain the butter from it; and then simmer the flesh in a good gravy well- seasoned, and thickened with a little flour and butter. Add the juice of half a lemon. Another way.â€”Cut off the legs, and the whole back, of a dressed chicken ; if underdone the better. Pull all the white part into little flakes free from skin ; toss it up with a little cream thickened with a piece of butter mixed with flour, half a blade of mace in powder, white pepper, salt, and a squeeze of lemon. Cut off the neck-end of the chicken, and broil the back and sidesmen in one piece, and the two legs seasoned. Put the hash in the middle, with the back on it j and the two Jegs at the end. Chicken Curry. Cut up the chicken ra\v, slice onions, and fry both in butter E

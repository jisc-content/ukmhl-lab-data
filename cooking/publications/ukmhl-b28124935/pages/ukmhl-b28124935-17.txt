GENERAL REMARKS. 13 the character he receives, and equally cautious and scrupu- lously just in giving one to others. Were this attended to, many bad people would be incapacitated for doing mischief, by abusing the trust reposed in them. It may be fairly asserted that the robbery or waste, which is but a milder epithet for the unfaithfulness of a servant, will be laid to the charge of that master or mistress, who knowing, or having well-founded sus- picions of any such faults, is prevailed upon by false pity or entreaty to slide him into another place. There are, however, some who are unfortunately capricious, and often refuse to give a character because they are displeased that a servant leaves their service; but this is unpardonable, and an absolute robbery, servants having no inheritance, and depending on their fair name for employment. To refuse countenance to the evil, and to encourage the good servant, are actions due to society at large; and such as are honest, frugal, and attentive to their duties should be liberally rewarded, which would en- courage merit and inspire servants with zeal to acquit them- selves. A proper quantity of household articles should be always ready, and more bought before the others be consumed, to prevent inconvenience, especially in the country. A bill of parcels and receipt should be required, even if the money be paid at the time of purchase; and, to avoid mistakes, let the goods be compared with these when first brought home. Though it is very disagreeable to suspect any oneâ€™s honesty, and perhaps mistakes have been unintentional, yet it is prudent to weigh meat, sugars, etc., when brought in, and compare with the charge. The butcher should be ordered to send the weight with the meat, and the cook to file these checks, to be examined when the weekly bill shall be delivered. Much trouble and irregularity are saved when there is com- pany, if servants are required to prepare the table and sideboard in similar order daily.

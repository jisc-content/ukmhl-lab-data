DOMESTIC COOKERY. 50 from two or three pounds of a loin of old mutton, and set it in steaks on a gridiron for a few minutes, just to brown one side; put them into a saucepan with a quart of water, cover close for an hour, and simmer it gently; then uncover it, and stew till the gravy is reduced to a pint. Season with only salt. Currant-jelly sauce must be served in a boat. Formerly pap-sauce was eaten with venison; which, as.some still like it, it may be necessary to direct. Grate white bread, and boil it with port wine, water, and a large stick of cinnamon ; and, when quite smooth, take out the cinnamon and add sugar. Claret may be used for it. Make the jelly-sauce thus :—Beat some currant-jelly and a spoonful or two of port wine, and set it over the fire till melted. Where jelly runs short, put more wine and a few lumps of sugar to the jelly, and melt as above. Serve with French beans. Haimch, Neck, and Shoidder of Venison. Roast with paste as directed above, and the same sauce. To stew a Shoulder of Venison. Let the meat hang till you think fit to dress it; then take out the bone, beat the meat with a rolling-pin, lay some slices of mutton-fat that have lain a few hours in a little port wine, sprinkle a little pepper and allspice over it in fine powder, roll it up tight, and tie it. Set it in a stewpan that will only just hold it, with some mutton or beef-gravy not strong, half a pint of port wine; and some pepper and allspice. Simmer it close- covered, as slow as you can, for three or four hours. When quite tender, take olf the tape, set the meat in a dish, strain the gravy over it, and serve with currant-jelly sauce.—This is the best way to dress this joint, unless it is very fat, and then it should be roasted. The bone should be stewed with it. Breast of Venison. Do it as the shoulder, or make it into a small pasty.

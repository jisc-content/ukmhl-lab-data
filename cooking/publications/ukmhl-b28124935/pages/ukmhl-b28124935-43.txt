39 FISH. LOBSTERS AND SHRIMPS. To Pot Lobsters. Half boil them, pick out the meat, cut it into small bits, season with mace, white pepper, nutmeg and salt, press close into a pot and cover with butter, bake half an hour; put the spawn in. When cold, take the lobster out, and put it into the pots with a little of the butter. Beat the other butter in a mortar with some of the spawn ; then mix that coloured butter with as much as will be sufficient to cover the pots and strain it. Cayenne may be added, if approved. Another way to Pot Lobsters, as at Woodâ€™s LLotel. Take out the meat as whole as you can ; split the tail and remove the gut; if the inside be not watery, add that. Season with mace, nutmeg, white pepper, salt, and a clove or two, in the finest powder. Lay a little fine butter at the bottom of a pan, and the lobster smooth over it, with bay-leaves between ; cover it with butter, and bake gently. When done, pour the whole on the bottom of a sieve, and with a fork lay the pieces into potting-pots, some of each sort, with the seasoning about it. When cold, pour clarified butter over, but not hot. It will be good next day; or highly seasoned, and thickly cpvered with butter, will keep some time. Potted lobster may be used cold, or as a fricassee, with a cream-sauce; it then looks very nicely, and eats excellently, especially if there is spawn. Mackerel, Lierrmgs, and Trout, are good potted as above. Stewed Lobster, a very high relish. Pick the lobster, put the berries into a dish that has a lamp, and rub them down with a bit of butter, two spoonfuls of any sort of gravy, one of soy, or walnut-ketchup, a little salt and cayenne, and a spoonful of port stew the lobster cut into bits with the gravy as above.

4 SAUCES. 133 An excellent substitute for Caper Sauce. Boil slowly some parsley, to let it become a bad colour, cut, but do not chop it fine; put it to melted butter, with a tea- spoonful of salt and a dessert-spoonful of vinegar. Boil up and serve. Oyster Sauce. Save the liquor in opening the oysters, and boil it with the beards, a bit of mace, and lemon-peel. In the mean time, throw the oysters into cold water, and drain it off. Strain the liquor, and put it into a saucepan with them, and as much butter, mixed with a little milk, as will make sauce enough; but first rub a little flour with it. Set them over the fire, and stir all the time; and when the butter has boiled once or twice, take them off, and keep the saucepan near the fire, but not on it; for if done too much, the oysters will be hard. Squeeze a little lemon-juice, and serve. If for company, a little cream is a great improvement. Observe, the oysters will thin the sauce, so put butter accordingly. Lobster Sauce. Pound the spawn, and two anchovies \ pour on them two spoonfuls of gravy; strain all into some butter melted, as will be hereafter directed; then put in the meat of the lobster, give it all one boil, and add a squeeze of lemon. Another way.â€”Leave out the anchovies and gravy; and do it as above, either with or without a little salt and ketchup, as you like. Many prefer the flavour of the lobster and salt only. Shrimp Sauce. If the shrimps are not picked at home, pour a little water over them to wash them ; put them to butter melted thick and smooth, give them one boil, and add the juice of a lemon.

GENERAL REMARKS. 14 All things likely to be wanted should be in readiness; sugars of different qualities kept broken, currants washed, picked, and perfectly dry, spices pounded, and kept in very small bottles closely corked; not more than will be used in four or five weeks should be pounded at a time. Much less is neces- sary than when boiled whole in gravies, etc. Where luncheons or suppers are served (and in every house some preparation is necessary for accidental visitors), care should be taken to have such things in readiness as are proper for either, and a list of several will be subjoined, a change of which may be agreeable, and, if duly managed, will be attended with little expense and much convenience. A ticket should be exchanged by the cook for every loaf of bread, which, when returned, will show the number to be paid for; as tallies may be altered, unless one is kept by each party. Those who are served with brewer’s beer, or any other articles not paid for weekly, or on delivery, should keep a book for entering the dates; which will not only serve to pre- vent overcharges, but Avill show the whole year’s consumption at one view. An inventory of furniture, linen, and china should be kept, and the things examined by it twice a year, or oftener, if there be a change of servants \ into each of whose care the articles used by him or her should be entrusted, with a list, as is done with plate. Tickets of parchment, with the family name, numbered, and specifying what bed it belongs to, should be sewed on each feather-bed, bolster, pillow, and blanket. Knives, forks, and house-cloths are often deficient; these accidents might be obviated if a notice at the head of every list required that the former should be produced whole or broken, and the marked part of the linen, though all the others should be worn out. The price of starch depends upon that of flour j the best will keep good in a dry warm room for some years; therefore

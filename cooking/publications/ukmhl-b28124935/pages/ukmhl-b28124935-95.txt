( 91 ) POULTRY, GAME, ETC. To choose Poultry, Game, etc. A Turkey-cock.—If young, it has a smooth black leg, with a short spur. The eyes full and bright, if fresh, and the feet siqrple and moist. If stale, the eyes will be sunk, and the feet dry. Hen-turkey is known by the same rules ; but if old, her legs will be red and tough. Fotvls.—If a cock is young, his spurs will be short j but take care to see they have not been cut or pared, which is a trick often practised. If fresh, the vent will be close and dark. Pullets are best just before they begin to lay, and yet are full of eggs; if old hens, their combs and legs will be rough; if young, they will be smooth. A good capon has a thick belly and large rump, there is a particular fat at his breast, and the comb is very pale. Black-legged fowls are most moist, if for roasting. Geese.—The bill and feet of a young one will be yellow, and there 'will be but few hairs upon them ; if old, they will be red ; if fresh, the feet will be pliable; if stale, dry and stiff. Geese are called green till three or four months old. Green geese should be scalded ■, a stubble-goose should be picked dry. Pucks.—Choose them by the same rules, of having supple feet and by their being hard and thick on the breast and belly. The feet of a tame duck are thick, and inclining to dusky yellow; a wild one has the feet reddish, and smaller than the tame. They should be picked dry. Ducklings must be scalded. Pigeons should be very fresh; when they look flabby about the vent, and this part is discoloured, they are stale. The feet should be supple; if old, the feet are harsh. The tame ones are larger than the wild, and are thought best by some persons; they should be fat and tender; but many are deceived

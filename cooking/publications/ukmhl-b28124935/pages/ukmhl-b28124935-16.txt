GENERAL REMARKS. 12 this work will be as useful as the cookery; and it is recom- mended to be strictly observant of both, which in the course of time will make them familiar in the practice. It is much to be feared, that for the waste of many of the good things that God has given for our use, not abuse, the mistress and servants of great houses will hereafter be called to a strict account. Some part of every person’s fortune should be devoted to charity; by which “ a pious woman will build up her house before God, while she that is foolish {i.e. lends nothing to the Lord), pulls it down with her hands.” No one can complain of the want of gifts to the poor in this land:—but there is a mode of relief which would add greatly to their comfort, and which being prepared from superfluity, and such materials as are often thrown away, the expense would not be felt.

GENERAL REMARKS. i8 Stone jar on a hot iron hearth; or by putting the vessel into a saucepan of water, called a water-bath. ' If chocolate, coffee, jelly, gruel, bark, etc., be suffered to boil over, the strength is lost. The cook should be encouraged to be careful of coals and cinders; for the latter there is a new contrivance to sift, with- out dispersing the dust of the ashes, by means of a covered tin bucket. Small coal wetted makes the strongest fire for the back, but must remain untouched until it cake. Cinders, lightly wet, give a great degree of heat, and are better than coal for furnaces, ironing-stoves, and ovens. The cook should be charged to take care of jelly-bags, tapes for the collared things, etc., which if not perfectly scalded, and kept dry, give an unpleasant flavour when next used. Cold water thrown on cast iron, when hot, will crack it. In the following, and indeed all other recipes, though the quantities may be as accurately directed as possible, yet much must be left to the discretion of the person who uses them. The different tastes of people require more or less of the flavour of spices, salt, garlic, butter, etc., which can never be ordered by general rules; and if the cook has not a good taste and attention to that of her employer’s, not all the ingredients which nature and art can furnish will give exquisite flavour to her dishes. The proper articles should be at hand, and she must proportion them until the true zest be obtained and a variety of flavour be given to the different dishes served at the same time. Those who require maigre dishes will find abundance in this little work; and where they are not stidctly so, by suet or bacon being directed in stuffings, the cook must use butter instead; and where meat gravies (or stock, as they are called) are ordered, those made of fish must be adopted.

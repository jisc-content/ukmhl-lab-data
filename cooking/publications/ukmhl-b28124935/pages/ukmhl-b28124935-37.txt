33 FISH. To bake Pike. Scale it, and open as near the throat as you can, then stuff it with the following .-—Grated bread, herbs, anchovies, oysters, suet, salt, pepper, mace, half a pint of cream, four yolks of eggs; mix all over the fire till it thickens, then put it in the fish, and sew it up; butter should be put over it in little bits; bake it. Serve sauce of gravy, butter, and anchovy. Note.—If in helping a pike, the back and belly are slit, and each slice gently drawn downwards, there will be fewer bones given. HADDOCK. Boil; or broil with stuffing as under, having salted them a day. To dry Haddock. Choose them of two or three pounds weight; take out the gills, eyes, and entrails, and remove the blood from the back- bone. Wipe them dry, and put some salt into the bodies and eyes. Lay them on a board for a night; then hang them up in a dry place, and after three or four days, they will be fit to eat; skin and rub them with egg, and strew crumbs over them. Lay them before the fire, and baste with butter until brown enough. Serve with egg-sauce. Whitings, if large, are excellent this way; and it will prove an accommodation in the country where there is no regular supply of fish. Stuffijig for Pike, Haddock, and small Cod. Take equal parts of fat bacon, beef-suet, and fresh butter, some parsley, thyme, and savory; a little onion, and a few leaves of scented marjoram shred fine; an anchovy or two ; a little salt and nutmeg, and some pepper. Oysters will be an improvement with or without anchovies; add crumbs, and an egg to bind. c

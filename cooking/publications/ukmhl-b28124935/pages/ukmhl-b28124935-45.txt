41 FISH. CRABS. Hot Crab. Pick the meat out of a crab, clear the shell from the head, then put the meat, with a little nutmeg, salt, pepper, a bit of butter, crumbs of bread, and three spoonfuls of vinegar, into the shell again, and set it before the fire. Dry toast should be served to eat it upon. Dressed Crab cold. Empty the shells, and mix the flesh with oil, vinegar, salt, and a little white pepper and cayenne ; then put the mixture into the large shell, and serve. Very little oil is necessary. OYSTERS. To feed Oysters. Put them into water, and wash them with a birch-besom till quite clean; then lay them bottom downwards in a pan, sprinkle with flour or oatmeal and salt, and cover with water. Do the same every day, and they will fatten. The water should be pretty salt. To stew Oysters. Open and separate the liquor from them, then wash them from the grit; strain the liquor, and put with the oysters a bit of mace and lemon-peel, and a few white peppers. Simmer them very gently, and put some cream and a little flour and butter. Serve with sippets. Boiled Oysters Eat well. Let the shells be nicely cleaned first; and serve in them, to eat with cold butter.

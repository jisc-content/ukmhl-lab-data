22 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Observations on Dressing Fish. If the fishmonger does not clean it, fish’ is seldom very nicely done ; but those in great towns wash it beyond what is neces- sary for cleaning, and by perpetual watering diminish the flavour. When quite clean, if to be boiled, some salt and a little vinegar should be put into the rvater to give firmness, but cod, whiting, and haddock, are far better if a little salted, and kept a day; and if not very hot weather, they will be good two days. Those who know how to purchase fish, may, by taking more at a time than they want for one day, often get it cheap; and such kinds as will pot or pickle, or keep by being sprinkled with salt and hung up, or by being fried, will serve for stewing the next day, may then be bought with advantage. Fresh-water fish has often a muddy smell and taste, to take off which, soak it in strong salt and water after it is nicely cleaned ; or if of a size to bear it, scald it in the same; then dry, and dress it. The fish must be put into the water while cold, and set to do very gently, or the outside will break before the inner part is done. Crimped fish should be put into boiling water ; and when it boils up, pour a little cold water in, to check extreme heat, and simmer it a few minutes. The fish-plate on which it is done may be drawn up to see if it be ready ; it will leave the bone when it is. It should then be immediately taken out of the water, or it will soon be woolly. The fish-plate should be set crosswise over the kettle, to keep hot for serving ; and a clean cloth cover the fish to prevent it losing its colour. Small fish nicely fried, covered with egg and crumbs, make a dish far more elegant than if served plain.—Great attention should be paid to garnishing fish : use plenty of horse-radish, parsley, and lemon.

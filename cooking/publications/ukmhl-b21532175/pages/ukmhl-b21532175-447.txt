THE LADY’s ASSISTANT. 421 taken of all fruit kept in fyrup ; if there is any froth on them, they muft be boiled up, and if they are very frothy and four, the fyrup muft be firft boiled; and then put in the fruit, and boil all together. Cucumbers. TAKE large cucumbers that will quarter like citron, and fmall ones to be whole, let them be very green, and as freed from feed as poflible ; put them into a wide-mouthed pot, pour over them a ftrong brine; lay a cabbage-leaf to keep them down, tie over a paper, fet them into the chimney-corner till they become yellow ; fet them over the fire in other fait and water, with a frefh cabbage leaf, and clofe covered, let them heat gently to green them, but they muft not boil ; if they fhould not be green enough fo foon as may be expe&ed, change the fait and water ; (in order to do it, take out the cucumbers, fcour the pan, and let the frelh fait and water be warm before they are put in again ; cover them as before directed.) When, they are of a good colour fet them off the fire, let them ftand in the water till cool, then put them into cold water, fhifting the water twice a day to take out the fait.—The large ones muft be quartered, and the feeds taken out, before they are put into the cold water; then make a fyrup according to the quantity of fruit, rather more than half a pint of water to one pound of fine fugar ; when boiled and feummed, put in above an ounce of ginger, the outfide feraped, fome very thin lemon- peel ; when the fyrup is boiled thick, fet it by till cold, then put in the cucumbers; boil up the fyrup once in two days, or as there isoccafion, for three weeks, but never put it to the cucumbers till cold ; if it is neceffary, add more fugar to the fyrup. Melons do rather better than cucumbers, having more fub- ftance ; but either melons or large cucumbers look very like citron, and do very well in cakes or pies. Currants preferved in Bunches. STONE them; tie the bunches to bits of flicks, fix or feven together; allow the weight of the currants in fugar, which make into a fyrup ; boil it high, put in the currants, give them a boil, fet them by, the next day take them out; when the fyrup boils, put them in again, give them a boil or two, take them out; boil the fyrup as much as is neceffary ; jfhen cold, put it to the currants in glaffes: brandy-paper. £ e 3 Currants

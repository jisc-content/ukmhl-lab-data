AS neatnefs is a moll: material requifite in a kitchen, be par- ticularly careful to keep all the utenfils perfe&ly clean, the po.s and faucepans well tinned, or lined with filver ; let all meat boil gently, and always ufe foft water, if to be had ; put the meat into the veflel while the water is cold, unlefs it is not fait enough (if beef or pork) then put it into hot, or boiling water ; be fure always to let the veflel be large enough, that the meat may be well covered with water; cover the pot, to prevent the foot dropping into it, and fo clofe that the fmoke from the fire does not get under the edge of the cover ; when it boils, never negleCt to take off the fcum, as that not being at- tended to, fpoils the look of the meat—fome fhake a fmall handful of flour upon the water, which takes up all the fcum —and others pour a little cold water in, when the pot boils, to make the fcum rife. General Directions for Roafting. AS foon as the meat is put to the fire, pour over it fome warm water, which throw away ; this is very neeeflary to thofe who are nice in the drefling their meat, it being a good deal handled in the fpitting ; fhake fome flour over it, bafte it with butter, and-do not put it too near the fire : this, with frequently bail- ing it, a brifk fire, and allowing time enough, are the only means of roafting in perfection : when the fleam draws to the fire, the meat is near done : flour and bafte it juft before it is fent to table, that it may have a nice froth : always allow a longer time for the meat to roaft in frofty weather: take parti- cular care to have the fpit clean, as nothing is more difagreeable than a fpit mark ; and remember, when the meat is half done, to remove the dripping-pan and fpit a little from the fire, and flir it: if it is a good fire before the meat is laid down, once flirting it will in general roaft a joint of meat. Never fait the meat before it is put to the fire, it draws out the gravy too much : if it is to be kept fome time before it is drefled, as in- deed mutton and beef are not good frefli killed, be fure to dry it well with a cloth, and hang it where it will have a thorough air; look at it every day, and wipe off all the damp; it will keep a long time : fome pepper it a little.

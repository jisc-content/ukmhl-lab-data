THE PAPER-BAG COOKERY MANUAL. 27 “If the food is fresh and good before cooking it will be fresh and good after cooking; if it were tainted and decomposed before, the cooking will not make it safe, pot or bag, because poisonous products of decomposition may remain. Moreover, the ‘Express’ paper-bags when fastened as directed are not gas-tight. If they were they would burst. The poisonous effect of some foods,” he continued, “is not due to any gaseous or readily volatile matter, but to alkaloidal and similar substances pro- duced by bacterial development. The bacteria themselves are killed by proper cooking, whether in pots or in ‘Express’ bags. The products of decomposition, however, once formed, remain almost wholly after cooking, whether in pots or bags. Cooking in ‘Express’ bags,” the analyst added, “has an important advantage over the pot-and- pan system, inasmuch as it tends materially to diminish the possibility of the contami- nation of food.”

92 THE PAPER-BAG COOKERY MANUAL. Mushrooms with Ham. Peel about half a pound of fresh mush- rooms, cut off the stalks, then wash and drain them on a cloth, season with salt and pepper. Next, cut thinly a few slices of ham, place them in a buttered paper-bag with the mushrooms, pour over a little oiled butter, fold in the ends of the bag and fasten securely, then put it in a hot oven on a grid shelf or trivet, and cook for about 15 minutes. Take up, slit the bag, and dish up the mushrooms and ham carefully; sprinkle over a little chopped parsley; and serve hot. Butter Bean Croquettes. Soak 1 pint of butter beans in water for several hours, and cook them in salted water until they can be easily mashed, press them through a sieve; heat up 2 ozs. of butter in a stew-pan, add the beans, and season with salt and pepper and a very little powdered sage. Shape the mixture like small sausages, dip in egg and oatmeal or bread crumbs, and place them side by side in a grease-proof paper-bag, after being thoroughly greased with clarified butter; close up the bag and fasten the end with clips, then put it on a grid shelf or wire tray in a fairly hot oven, and cook for about 18 minutes. Take up the croquettes, put them neatly on a dish; garnish with parsley and lemon, and serve hot.

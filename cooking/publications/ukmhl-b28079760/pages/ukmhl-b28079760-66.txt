62 THE PAPER-BAG COOKERY MANUAL. inside a well buttered, grease-proof paper- bag; upon this put the prepared slices of liver; close up the bag, fasten it with clips, and put it on a grid shelf in a fairly hot oven; cook thus for about 12 minutes, by which time the bacon and the liver should be quite tender. Great care should be taken not to cook the liver too long, else it becomes hard and tough. Take the bag out of the oven, slit it open, and range the contents neatly on a hot dish; garnish with sprigs of parsley, and serve. Boiled Pork and Bacon. Both pork and bacon can be successfully cooked in paper-bags. In the case of pickled pork, chose the thin parts of meat, and put it in a greased paper-bag with two or three small carrots, each cut in four, also a sufficient quantity of water, and fold in the bag and fasten it securely with clips, and cook them on a grid shelf in a moderately heated oven, allowing from 20 to 25 minutes to each pound of meat. Bacon should be soaked for several hours in tepid water, and then enclosed in a greased paper-bag and cooked the same as directed for boiled pork. Boiled Ham. One can hardly expect to get a large ham successfully cooked in a paper-bag, but a portion, say about half a ham, or a small gammon, can be so cooked to perfection.

Break or slit the bag, put the contents carefully on a hot dish, and serve. Stuffed Tomatoes. Take six firm, ripe, even sized tomatoes, cut off the tops; scoop out the insides, rub the pulp through a fine wire sieve; with this prepare the stuffing, adding 2 ozs. of fresh butter, three table-spoonfuls of bread crumbs, six finely chopped preserved mush- rooms, and a little chopped parsley or chives; season with salt and pepper. Stir the mix- ture, and bind with two yolks of eggs and a little cream. Fill the tomatoes with the stuffing thus prepared. Place them side by side in a well buttered paper-bag, close it up securely, put it on a wire grid, and bake in a hot oven for about 15 minutes. Dish up the tomatoes, and serve hot. Baked Tomatoes. Cut six tomatoes into halves, season them with pepper and salt, and sprinkle bread crumbs over them, put small pieces of butter here and there on them. Place them in a buttered paper-bag, close it up securely, put it on a wire grid, and bake in a fairly hot oven for about 20 minutes. Dish up the tomatoes, and serve hot.

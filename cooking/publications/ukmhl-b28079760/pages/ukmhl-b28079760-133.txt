THE PAPER-BAG COOKERY MANUAL. 129 PAPER-BAG COOKING HINTS. The real and ultimate success of any fresh method of cooking whatsoever depends upon its effect on the palate and digestion. Everything else—labour saving, time sav- ing even absence of kitchen aromas—is secondary to the great question as to whether we are getting our food better cooked by the new system, and it is doing us more good. That is why I am rather inclined to deprecate the insistance that has been laid on the merely expeditious advantages said to attach to paper-bag cookery. Getting rid of pots and pans, halving time and abolishing the odours of the cuisine, are not so important as ensuring an improved meal, both for the taste and the stomach. It is the cook’s business to consider whether the quicker system is also the more effective from a strictly dietetic point of view. Holding as I do that cooking in paper- bags possesses many obvious advantages, I have endeavoured to set forth some directions calculated to assist the cook in obtaining the best possible results. Un- doubtedly, paper-bag cookery is capable of producing some exquisite dishes, but only, of course, if it is scientifically carried out. j

THE PAPER-BAG COOKERY MANUAL. 29 FISH. Boiled Fish. Cod, salmon, turbot, halibut, trout, or any other kind of fish suitable for boiling, can be cooked successfully with water in a paper-bag. After cleaning, trimming, and wiping the fish thoroughly, butter the inside of an “Express” paper-bag of suitable size, then put in the fish, with one or two slices of onion and carrot, a little vinegar or lemon juice, and enough salted water to well moisten the fish. Allow about a pint of water to 2 lbs. of fish. Fold in the end of the bag with two folds, then fasten with several wire clips, and place it carefully on to a cold wire tray or grid and put it in the oven to cook. The oven should register about 225 degrees when the fish is put in. The time required for cooking depends greatly on the shape and thickness of the fish. 2 lbs. of turbot will take about 25 to 80 minutes. To serve, take out the bag carefully with the grid; slit the paper and lift out the fish with a fish slice, or small skimmer, and place it on a hot dish; garnish with sprigs of parsley and serve.

THE PAPER-BAG COOKERY MANUAL. 41 spread this on one side of each prepared fillet and roll up neatly. Butter some strips of white paper and roll up each fillet in paper. Arrange them closely in an upright position in a well buttered paper- bag, moisten with a little white wine and mushroom liquor, then fold in the end of the bag, and fasten securely. Now place the bag on a grid shelf in a hot oven and cook from 20 to 25 minutes. Take up the bag carefully, remove the paper, and range the fish neatly on to a hot dish. Turbot a la Creme. Procure a small piece (about 1\ lbs.) of turbot, remove the black skin and wipe the fish with a damp cloth, season with salt, put it in a well buttered paper-bag, with a small onion, sliced, a gill of water, a gill of milk, and, if liked, the juice of half a lemon. Fold in the end of the bag and fasten with clips; turn up, also, the four corners of the bag and place it in the oven on a wire grid, cook in moderate heat for about 25 minutes, or longer, according to the thickness of the fish. When done, slit open the bag care- fully, take out the turbot, and put it on a hot dish; mix, in a small basin previously heated, a little cream with a yolk of egg, season with salt, pepper, and a grate of nutmeg, pour in the liquid found in the paper-bag, stir well, and pour over the fish; garnish with slices of lemon and parsley, and serve hot.

14 THE PAPER-BAG COOKERY MANUAL. saving of time, money, fuel, and labour. The saving in fuel alone is estimated to be about 25 per cent., and joints of meat or birds require no basting. Quickness, economy, and added leisure for the cook are notable features of a form of cookery which dispenses with pots and pans. All dishes so prepared entail no watching, no leaning over hot stoves to the ruin of both complexion and temper. Every dish cooks itself in an “ Express ” paper-bag. Paper-bag cookery banishes the dis- agreeable odours inseparable from meal times under the antiquated pot-and-pan regime. It has been proved by expert chefs that the use of “ Express” paper-bags enhances the tenderness, flavour, and food value of every dish. Food is far more nourishing when cooked under the “Express” system ; meat, for instance, increasing at least 35 per cent, in food value. Joints are subject to very little, if any, shrinkage when cooked in “Express” paper-bags. Again, the employment of these bags makes bad cooking impossible if the few simple instructions given are observed. Last, but not least, food so prepared is clean. There should be no contamination whatever of food under this hygienic method.

50 THE PAPER-BAG COOKERY MANUAL. MEAT. Roast Joints. Trim the meat, if necessary, and cut off any projecting bones, as these often cause the paper-bags to burst, wipe it with a cloth, then weigh the joint. Allow from 20 to 25 minutes to each pound of meat. Veal and pork require a little more time than beef or mutton, as the former should always be well done. Dredge the cut side of the joint with flour, seasoned with salt and pepper. Have ready the correct size of an “ Express” paper-bag, select it rather too large than too small, so that there is no possible chance of its breaking when the joint is put in. After spreading a little dripping or butter over the meat, put it in a well greased paper-bag. Fasten the end after folding it, with several wire clips. Next place it on a grid shelf in a hot oven and cook till tender. When done, open the bag and dish up the meat. Serve with gravy. The time required for cooking depends upon the size and weight of the joint; it is safe to allow about 20 minutes to every pound. For other information on this point the time table found at the beginning of this book should be consulted.

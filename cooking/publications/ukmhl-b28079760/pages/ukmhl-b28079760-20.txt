In the case of coal-heated stoves, which have solid shelves, a wire grid or trivet must be placed upon the shelf. The initial heat of the oven should, in the case of cooking meat, be between 275 to 800 degrees Fahrenheit before it is put in, and should be kept at this temperature for 15 or 20 minutes before there is any reduction. The subsequent average heat should not be less than 220 degrees Fahrenheit. When a gas cooking stove is used, the bags should be placed on shelves well out of reach of the flames. No unnecessary expense need be incurred by people who have no cookers, for portable gas rings, tubings, and tin ovens may be purchased inexpensively, and even paraffin oil stoves, with a portable oven, may be successfully utilised.

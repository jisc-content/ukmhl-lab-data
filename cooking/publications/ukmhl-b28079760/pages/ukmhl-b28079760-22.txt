18 THE PAPER-BAG COOKERY MANUAL. When once the food material necessary for the dish has been placed in the bag, fold the end (the opening) several times, and fasten with one or more paper wire- clips, or with small, thin, wooden skewers, so as to seal hermetically the bag. It is a good plan to fold in also the corners at the bottom of the bag to ensure against leakage. The Oven. The oven in which the food is to be cooked should in the first place be icell heated for about ten minutes before re- quired for use. To ascertain correct heat a cooking thermometer should be used. If this is not available, use a piece of thin white paper, or else throw a little flour on the top shelf. If it turns quickly a light brown, the oven is hot and is right for the first cooking stage. The average oven heat maintained during cooking should never be less than 220 nor more than 800 degrees Fahrenheit. As proving the economy of heat-power effected by paper-bag cookery it only needs to be remarked that the average heat of 220 degrees required for this method is nearly 80 degrees less than that needed (in ordinary baking) for mutton, 90 degrees less than for beef or poultry, and 120 degrees less than for cakes and pastry. The Cooking Process. The paper-bag when filled with the food and ready for cooking must be placed in the

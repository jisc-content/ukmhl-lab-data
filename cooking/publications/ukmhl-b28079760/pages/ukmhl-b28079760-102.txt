98 THE PAPER-BAG COOKERY MANUAL. Baked Apples. Peel thinly six sour cooking apples, cut out the core of each with a cutter, and fill the cavities with currants, paste, and castor sugar, pour a little oiled butter over each apple, and place them in a buttered paper- bag, close it up securely, put it on a wire grid, and bake in a moderate oven for 20 minutes. Rolled Jam Pudding. Take half a pound of flour, 2 ozs. of bread crumbs, 4 ozs. of finely chopped beef suet, one teaspoonful of baking powder, gills of water, half of a teaspoonful of salt, and about a quarter of a pound of jam. Sift the flour and mix with the chopped suet, bread crumbs, baking powder, and salt; work it into a fairly stiff paste with the water. Roll it out on a floured board. Spread it over with the jam, leaving about half an inch free at the edges; roll up the paste gently, press the ends together. Butter a large “ Express ” paper-bag, put in it the pudding so that the joint of the paste is downwards, pour in about three quarters of a pint of water, close up bag, and fasten the end with wire clips, then place it on a wire grid in a moderately heated oven, and cook for about 1^ hours. When done slit open the bag, and take out the pudding carefully, place it on a hot dish, serve plain or with some sweet melted butter sauce.

72 THE PAPER-BAG COOKERY MANUAL. Loin of Pork a la Robert. Bone half a small loin of pork and remove the rind if liked. Peel and chop finely two shallots, mix these with half ounce of butter and a table-spoonful of flour, also a peeled ripe tomato cut up very small. Put this mixture inside the loin and fold in the end, and season the meat with salt and pepper, now put it in a paper-bag with a gill of stock or water, close up the bag securely, and put it on a grid shelf and cook for about 1J to If hours in a fairly hot oven. Put the meat on a hot dish, mix the sauce formed in the bag with a little hot water and pour round the base of the pork, and serve. Ham and Eggs. Cut thinly the required number of rashers of ham or gammon; trim off the rind, and enclose them in an “Express” paper-bag, and cook for about 6 minutes on a grid shelf in a fairly hot oven. Now take out the bag, and with a pair of scissors cut out the centre portion of the paper. Carefully break three new-laid eggs on top of the ham, put the bag back in the oven and cook for another 3 minutes; then slide out the ham and eggs by means of a slice or skimmer on to a hot dish, and serve.

THE PAPER-BAG COOKERY MANUAL. 91 Coloannon. Mash or mince finely some cold boiled potatoes, season them with salt and pepper, and mix with them sufficient cooked and chopped spring cabbage to give a pleasant green colour to the potatoes, add a little butter, and put into a buttered paper- bag, sprinkle with bread crumbs, close it up securely, place it on a wire grid, and bake in a hot oven for about 15 minutes. Dish up, and serve with thinly cut rashers of bacon, cooked separately in a paper-bag. Stuffed Mushrooms. Take about a pound of mushrooms, wash, drain, and skin them, and cut off the stalk end. Stuff each mushroom with a layer of force-meat made the same as for roulade of veal. Pour a little oiled butter on top of each, and place in a buttered “Express” paper-bag, fold in the end of the bag and fasten with clips, and cook in a fairly hot oven for about 8 minutes on a grid shelf. Broiled Cup Mushrooms. Peel rather more than half a pound of cup mushrooms, cut off the stalks, and wash and drain thoroughly on a cloth; season wfith salt and pepper, and put about half a tea-spoonful of parsley butter into each mushroom. Then place them, head downwards into a large well buttered grease proof paper-bag, fold over and fasten the bag securely, place in a sharp oven, and cook on a grid shelf from 6 to 8 minutes.

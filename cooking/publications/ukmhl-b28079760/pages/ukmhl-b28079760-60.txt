56 THE PAPER-BAG COOKERY MANUAL. Veal Olives with Tomato Sauce. Cut into rather thin slices about 1| lbs. of lean veal (loin, neck, or cushion part). Shape them into ovals and flatten out the ends by means of a cutlet bat, chop the meat trimmings very finely together with 2 ozs. of cooked ham and a few preserved mushrooms. Mix this with a tea-spoonful of chopped parsley, 1 oz. of soft bread crumbs, and moisten with a beaten egg, season with salt and pepper, and stir well. Spread one side of the veal slices with a layer of this mixture and roll up each, tie with a piece of very thin string or twine, and place them in a well buttered paper- bag, previously lined with thinly cut slices of bacon, a sliced carrot and onion (the latter may, if liked, be previously fried with a little butter). Lastly, add about a gill of stock, half a gill of well reduced tomato sauce, and a small glass of claret or sherry. Fold the open end of the bag carefully and fasten with clips, then put it on a grid shelf in a fairly hot oven to cook for about 35 minutes; by this time the meat and stuffing should be quite tender. Kemove the bag from the oven, slit it open, and take out the meat rolls, remove the string, dish up the meat, and strain the sauce over. Beef Rolls or Olives. Proceed the same as directed for veal olives, only substituting lean beef (rump steak or top side) for veal.

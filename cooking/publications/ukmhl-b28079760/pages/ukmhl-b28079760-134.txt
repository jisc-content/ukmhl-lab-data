130 THE PAPER-BAG COOKERY MANUAL. The following additional hints and obser- vations on the subject should therefore be carefully studied by those adopting this system :— First, the bag itself: This must be made of grease-proof paper, and be free from all injurious chemicals, both in its own composition and the paste used to bind it together. The size of the bag should be as convenient as possible for the amount of food intended to go in it— neither too large nor too small. A thorough examination should be made to make sure that there is no possibility of leakage. The slightest leakage would lead to the escape of juice, gravy, or flavour, thus tending to spoil the food so cooked. In the case of pastry or milk puddings, it is desirable to prick the top of the paper here and there. Before the bags are used they must be well greased over the inside with clarified butter, lard, clarified dripping, or olive oil. This has the effect of rendering them extra grease-proof as well as air-proof, a great factor in the success of any cooking by this process. In the case of meat for roasting, it is not so essential to grease the paper outside. When the food material has been placed in the bag, the opening must be folded over several times and secured with two, three, or more wire clips, so that the bag is well sealed.

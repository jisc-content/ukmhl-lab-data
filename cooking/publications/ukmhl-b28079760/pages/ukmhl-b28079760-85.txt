THE PAPER-BAG COOKERY MANUAL. 81 paprika pepper ; stone eight or ten French olives ; prepare a stock with the carcase of the bird, and colour it with a little caramel. Butter an “Express” paper-bag, put in the pieces of duck, the olives, and a few small peeled button onions, also gills of the prepared stock, and, if liked, a little claret. Close up the bag securely and put it on a wire grid in a moderately heated oven for about 30 minutes, or longer; dish up the salmi with the olives and onions, pour over the sauce, and serve hot. Roast Rabbit. Take one rabbit, 1 oz. of chopped beef suet, two table-spoonfuls of bread crumbs, half a tea-spoonful of chopped parsley, one egg to bind, and eight small rolls of bacon. Wipe and truss the rabbit for roasting; fill the body with stuffing made with the chopped suet, bread crumbs, parsley, a tea- spoonful of savoury herbs, and sufficient egg to bind, season with salt and pepper ; sew up or skewer the opening, spread some dripping or butter over the rabbit, and place it in an “Express” bag, fold and fasten the opening securely with clips. Put the bag on a wire grid in a hot oven, and cook from 1£ to If hours. Cook the rolls of bacon separately in a paper-bag. Remove the rabbit from the bag, take out the string and skewers and put it on a hot dish, pour over the gravy from the bag, and put the rolls of bacon round the base of the dish.

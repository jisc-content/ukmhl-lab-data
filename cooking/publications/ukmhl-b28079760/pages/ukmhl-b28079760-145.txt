To every pound of ordinary flour add 2 ozs. (one id. packet) of “Paisley Flour” —the sure raising powder— and mix dry. Mix it fresh every time—it only takes a minute. Stir round till the lighter coloured “Paisley Flour” disappears and sift through a dredger. In this way you have a self-raising flour superior to anything you can buy—one in which the raising pow- der has lost none of its virtue by waiting, exposure to air or damp in shops, etc. And it will cost you no more, if not less, than ready-made self-raising flour, and very much less than cake and bun flours and mixtures.

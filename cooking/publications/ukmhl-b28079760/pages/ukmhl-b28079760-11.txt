THE PAPER-BAG COOKERY MANUAL. 7 During my culinary career at the Reform Club, the roast cooks rarely ever cooked a joint of meat or a bird without it was first wrapped in grease-proof paper ; the roasts then, as now, were always a great feature of the Reform Club, and the same may be said of other first-class catering establishments. This process of enveloping raw food in paper was not alone confined to meat and poultry, it has always been adopted by professional cooks at hotels, restaurants, and clubs, for various kinds of dishes, thereby securing all the true flavour of the food materials. It will thus be seen that the principle of enclosing viands in an air-tight envelope has been long regarded as one of the higher attainments in the culinary pro- fession. By the paper-bag method similar results are obtained, only in a more simplified form. On this account it deserves to become more generally adopted for household cookery, whilst cleanliness of the paper-bag method is in itself a strong recommendation.

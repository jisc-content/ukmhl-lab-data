THE PAPER-BAG COOKERY MANUAL. 87 slightly salted boiling water for a few minutes, then drain on a cloth. Next, place the potatoes into a thickly buttered grease- proof paper-bag and bake them on a grid or trivet in a brisk oven for about 25 minutes. Test the potatoes with a skewer, and when found done open the bag, add a good pinch of fine salt to the potatoes, also a little chopped parsley and a tiny piece of fresh butter. Shake the contents well, then dish up the potatoes and serve. Baked Potatoes. Wash and scrape, or peel thinly, 1 to 1J lbs. of new potatoes; parboil them for a few minutes in salted water, then drain, sprinkle over with oiled butter, and put them into a buttered grease-proof paper- bag. Fasten the bag securely and place on a grid or trivet in a hot oven, and bake for 25 or 30 minutes. Potato Chips. Wash and peel thinly four or five potatoes, and cut them into very thin slices; put them on a cloth and drain thoroughly so as to absorb all the moisture. Have ready a well buttered paper-bag, put in the prepared potato chips, and close up the bag, fasten the end with clips, and place on a grid shelf in a hot oven ; cook thus for about 15 minutes, turning the bag once or twice during this period ; the potato chips will be found quite crisp by this time.

THE PAPEE-BAG COOKEEY MANUAL. 127 7. —Don’t forget to ascertain the correct heat of the oven before placing in the food. 8. —Don’t place the paper-bag in too hot an oven, or in the case of a gas oven, too near the gas jets, so as to cause the paper to scorch or burn. 9. —Don’t attempt to economise when once a bag is scorched, remove it at once, and put the food in a fresh bag. 10. —Don’t omit to observe the instructions for obtaining and maintaining the proper oven temperatures; the cooking times for each kind of food will be found on pages 19 and 20 in this book. 11. -*-Don’t forget to use a wire trivet or grid to support the bag in every case, whether the oven shelf be of the “solid” or “open bar” variety, whether the cooking be done by gas, coal, oil, or electricity. 12. —Don’t consider the Senn Oven Thermo- meter a permanent oven fixture during the cooking process. Place the thermo- meter in the oven only when you wish to test the heat. 18.—Don’t, please don’t, put this reliable little half-crown, china thermometer directly over the naked flame, and then express surprise if it cracks. 14.—Don’t omit, when baking pastry, to punch or pierce a few small holes here and there in the end of the bag with a skewer or the prongs of a fork, this will ensure the pastry acquiring a golden brown.

100 THE PAPER-BAG COOKERY MANUAL. Baked Custard. Break two or three eggs separately into a basin, acid about half an ounce of castor sugar, beat thoroughly; add a pint of milk by degrees, pour into a shallow buttered pie-dish, grate over a very little nutmeg, put the dish carefully into a paper-bag, seal up, and bake slowly in a very moderately heated oven for about 20 minutes. Spotted Dick. Sift three quarters of a pound of flour, add to it a pinch of salt, a tea-spoonful of baking powder, and mix with 6 ozs. of chopped suet, add enough water to make into a fairly stiff paste. Roll it out and sprinkle with plenty of currants ; wet the edges and roll up the paste. Butter and flour a paper-bag, place in it the prepared roll with about a pint of water, and tie the ends securely. Put it on a wire grid in a moderately heated oven and cook for about If hours. Currant Cookies. Take half a pound of flour, 2 ozs. of butter, 3 ozs. of currants, 2 ozs. of sugar, two eggs, half a tea-spoonful of baking powder, one table-spoonful of milk, one tea-spoonful of ground cinnamon. Rub the butter into the flour, then add the baking powder, the sugar, the currants, and the cinnamon. Beat up the eggs with a little milk and add to the dry ingredients.

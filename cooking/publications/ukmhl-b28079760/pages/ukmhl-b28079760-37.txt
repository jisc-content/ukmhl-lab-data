THE PAPER-BAG COOKERY MANUAL. 33 Fillets of Plaice. Remove the fillets from a medium-sized plaice, cut each fillet in two, season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle over a little lemon juice, fold each fillet in two or roll up (skin inwards). Put a small piece of butter on top of each, and place carefully in a buttered “ Express ” paper-bag, fasten the ends with clips, and cook for about 10 minutes on a wire grid in a hot oven. Cut open the bag and lift out the fish carefully on to a hot dish. Garnish with sprigs of parsley, and serve. Stuffed Haddock. Wash, scale, and wipe a good-sized fresh haddock; remove the eyes. Prepare a stuffing with two table-spoonfuls of chopped suet, two table-spoonfuls of bread crumbs, half tea-spoonful of herbs, one tea-spoonful of chopped parsley, and season with salt and pepper. Moisten the stuffing with half an egg. Stuff the body of the fish and sew up the opening, or simply fold in ends. Brush it over with beaten egg, and sprinkle over some browned bread crumbs, and place a few very small pieces of dripping, wrap carefully in greased paper-bag, fold the end and fasten with wire clips, and place on a wire grid in the oven. Bake in a fairly hot oven from 25 to 80 minutes, according to size of fish. Dish up, remove the string, and serve.

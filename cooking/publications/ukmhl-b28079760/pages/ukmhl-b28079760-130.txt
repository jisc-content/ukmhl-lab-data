126 THE PAPER-BAG COOKERY MANUAL. 17 DONTS in Paper-Bag Cookery. 1. —Don’t forget to examine each bag care- fully before using, and if any possible rent, tear, or tendency to become un- fastened is discovered, to repair the defect with white of egg or a little paste made with flour and water. 2. —Don’t omit to brush over the inside of each bag thoroughly with clarified butter, clarified dripping, lard, or good olive oil. 8.—Don’t fail to cut, saw, or trim off all projecting sharp bones, fins, or pointed skewers, such as are likely to pierce the paper-bag, before placing meat or fish in the bag. 4. —Don’t forget, when once the food has been placed in the proper sized bag, to fold over at least twice the opening of the bag, and fasten with wire clips; to turn down both corners, and secure also with a wire clip. 5. —Don’t put the loaded bag on a hot grid, trivet, or shelf in the oven ; place it on a cold grid on the hot oven shelf. 6. —Don’t forget to remove the top portion of the paper-bag a few minutes before the meat is done, when a joint or bird is required to be nicely browned.

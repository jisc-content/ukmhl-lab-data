28 THE PAPER-BAG COOKERY MANUAL. An Ideal Oven Thermometer. A Culinary Thermometer is indispensable for successful and uniform cooking results. By its help the various heats required for cooking every kind of food are shown. It also serves for registering oven or pot heats. SENN’S OVEN THERMOMETER is acknowledged by all chefs who have used it to be the most useful instrument in the market for their purpose, giving reliable information, performing its work with mathematical accuracy, and registering every degree of heat from 100 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. It is good news to all cooks who have to study economy in the kitchen that Senn’s Oven Thermometer can now be obtained for 2s. 6d. The new thermometer is exactly the same reliable guide as the dearer varieties, differing only that the cheaper kind is made of earthenware, instead of brass. It is perfectly adapted for testing heats inside an oven or for hanging on pots, and is specially suitable, in fact absolutely necessary, for Paper-Bag Cookery, where so much depends on knowing exactly when the food is properly cooked and tender. The essential thing in an instrument of this nature is its accuracy and the knowledge it imparts. In these respects Senn’s Oven Thermometer is unrivalled, and at the modest price of 2s. 6d., it is now brought within the reach of all. This useful instrument can be obtained from the Office of The “ DAILY EXPRESS,” 23, St. Bride Street, E.C., post free for 2s. 9d.; or from The INVENTOR, 329, Vauxhall Bridge Road, London, S.W.

THE PAPER-BAG COOKERY MANUAL. 71 Kidneys a la frangaise. Skin and cut into thin slices four or five sheeps’ kidneys, or one calf’s kidney; season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle over a little melted butter, three slices of finely minced onion, also about a table- spoonful of flour. Mix all carefully and put into a well buttered paper-bag, together with a small glass of white wine and a gill of stock. Close up the bag securely, place it on a grid shelf in a fairly hot oven, and cook rather briskly for about 12 to 15 minutes; if cooked too long the kidneys will get tough. To serve, open the bag, put the contents with the sauce into a hot dish, and sprinkle over a little chopped parsley. Fillets of Beef & la Yiennoise. Chop finely, or pass through the mincing machine, 1 lb. of lean beef, put it in a basin and add half a finely chopped onion, 4 ozs. of bread crumbs, season with salt and pepper, and mix with a well beaten egg ; shape into even-sized round flat cakes and brush over with butter. Dredge them lightly with flour and place them in a well buttered “Express” paper-bag, pouring a little clarified butter on top of each fillet, close up the bag securely, and bake on a wire grid in a fairly hot oven for about 15 or 20 minutes.

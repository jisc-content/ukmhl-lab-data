THE PAPER-BAG COOKERY MANUAL. 55 over each side of the cutlets with this, then place them side by side into a thickly buttered paper-bag, fold in and fasten the ends, then put the bag on a grid shelf or trivet and cook in a hot oven from 18 to 20 minutes. Slit open the bag, and arrange the cutlets neatly on a hot dish, garnish with parsley and quarters of lemon, and serve with a sharp tomato or piquante sauce. Note.â€”If liked, a few finely cut slices of streaky bacon can be cooked at the same time as the cutlets. These can be placed on top of the cutlets, or may be cooked in a separate bag. Veal Steak with Mushrooms. Procure a thick fillet or steak cut from the leg-part of veal and flatten with a bat. Brush over both sides with the cut side of a lemon, then season with salt and pepper. Put a thinly cut slice of gammon on top, then place into a well buttered grease-proof paper-bag, fold over the end and fasten with clips. Place in a very hot oven on a grid shelf or trivet and cook quickly for the first 5 or 6 minutes, allowing altogether from 12 to 15 minutes, according to the thickness of the meat. To serve, slit open the paper-bag and carefully take out the steak, place on a hot dish together with the slice of gammon. Round the dish range neatly some broiled cup mushrooms, or baked tomatoes, and send to table hot. This dish is particularly nice if served with kidney potatoes.

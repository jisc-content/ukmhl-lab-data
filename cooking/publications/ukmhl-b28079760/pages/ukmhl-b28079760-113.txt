THE PAPER-BAG COOKERY MANUAL. 109 Stewed Greengages. Wipe some greengages and stone them if liked, but this is not necessary. Place them in an “Express” paper-bag, which has been previously coated inside with clarified butter ; add sufficient castor sugar to sweeten, also about a gill of water to a pound of fruit. Fold in the end of the bag, fasten with clips, place the bag carefully on a wire grid, and cook in the oven at slow heat from 15 to 20 minutes. Stewed Prunes. Prunes should be soaked over-night, or at any rate for a few hours in tepid-water. Drain them, and put them into a well buttered “ Express ” paper-bag with a strip of lemon rind or a small piece of whole cinnamon, also the necessary sugar, and a gill of water to a pound of fruit. When cooked, take out the fruit, let it cool, then dish it up on a compotier. Garnish with glace cherries and angelica, and strips of almonds if liked.

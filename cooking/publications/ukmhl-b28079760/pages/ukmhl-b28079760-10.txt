6 THE PAPER-BAG COOKERY MANUAL. pages. I have further to state that I am not an inventor of a paper-bag or the patent clips used in this system of cookery. I have subjected to severe tests several makes of paper-bags, also various kinds of grease-proof paper, in which different kinds of food have been cooked. As a result of these tests I have found the “Express” Paper-Bag (Papakuk) to be best and to answer the purpose thoroughly, and it is for this reason, as well as on account of the low price at which these bags are sold, that I have no hesitation in recommending this special make of bag. Cooking in paper-bags has been described and largely advertised as the “ greatest culinary triumph of the age,” and some writer even went so far as to call it an “ earth-shaking revolution in culinary methods.” There is, however, nothing strikingly novel about this “ new method of cooking,” for the principle of cooking in paper has been known for generations, and those who will take the trouble to look up any standard cookery books will find plenty of recipes where paper is used for the purpose of wrapping-up food in and during the process of cooking. In this way fish, flesh, and fowl is directed to be grilled, boiled, roasted, and baked, and the results obtained have always been acknow- ledged to be more satisfactory than by the ordinary cooking methods.

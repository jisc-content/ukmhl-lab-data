Baked Roly Pudding. Rub 8 ozs. of beef dripping into half a pound of flour and mix with milk or water to a fairly stiff paste. Roll it out on a floured board and spread thinly with jam. Roll it up carefully, put it in a well buttered paper-bag, and bake on a grid shelf for about three quarters of an hour in a moderate oven. Semolina and Currant Pudding. Skin and chop finely 1 oz. of beef suet; put 2 ozs. of semolina to soak in a pint of warm milk. Mix well in a basin the suet, 2 ozs. of clean currants, and 1 oz. of castor sugar, and pour over the milk, previously boiled, with the thin rind of half a lemon. Pour the mixture into a buttered shallow pie-dish, place this in a paper-bag, seal up the end, and bake slowly in a moderately heated oven for about 45 minutes.

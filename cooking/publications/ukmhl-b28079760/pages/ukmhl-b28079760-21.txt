THE PAPER-BAG COOKERY MANUAL. 17 Instructions for Paper-Bag Cookery. The Bag. In order to prevent any possibility of the paper-bag breaking or bursting, either be- fore or after being placed in the oven, the following directions are offered : Select the size bag which will conveni- ently hold the food intended to be cooked in it. It must not be too large or too small. Examine the bag carefully to see if there is the slightest rent or break. If so, paste over with white of egg or a paste made with flour and water. The least hole in the bag is certain to increase in size when placed in a heated atmosphere, thus causing loss of gravy or juice from food. Cut, saw, or trim off all projecting sharp bones of joints of meat, etc., also fins, or protruding edges from any food that are likely to tear the paper, before placing it in the bags. Without this precaution meat or poultry is likely to cause incisions in bag perhaps unknown to the cook. Before using the bags they must be well greased inside with butter, dripping, lard, or olive oil. This will render them extra grease-proof as well as air-proof, which is very essential to the success of cooking by this process. B

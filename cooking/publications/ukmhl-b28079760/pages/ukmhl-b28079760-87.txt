THE PAPER-BAG COOKERY MANUAL. 83 with oiled butter, one side, and wrap the vegetables, buttered side inwards, in the paper. Care must be taken to see that the ends of the paper are carefully sealed up; for this reason “Express” paper-bags are more convenient, being much cleaner to use and easier to seal up. Dried peas, lentils, and haricot beans are excellent cooked in paper-bags, but they must be allowed to soak for rather longer than usual before cooking them. It is well to remember that all vegetables must undergo some kind of preparation, washing, draining, scraping, peeling, etc., before they can be cooked in the correct sense, and unless this is done well the success of a dish is often spoiled, so that the paper-bag cannot be of much help unless this is done. Always cook the vegetables on the same day on which they are prepared and wanted for table. Vegetables of strong flavour, which in- clude almost every kind of green vegetable, are not recommended to be cooked in a paper-bag, they should be cooked in a large quantity of water, sufficient to well cover the articles to be cooked. The water in which they are cooked must be well seasoned with salt. About a tea- spoonful to every quart of water is the average proportion used.

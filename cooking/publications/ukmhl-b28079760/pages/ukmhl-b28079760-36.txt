Procure two slices of cod, each weighing from half to three-quarters of a pound. Wipe it and place on a buttered dish. Prepare a mixture of bread crumbs, savoury herbs, and parsley, and bind it with a little beaten egg. Place this upon each slice of fish and season with salt and pepper. Put a slice of raw ham or lean bacon on top of each, then place the fish in a well greased “ Express ” paper-bag, fold the end and fasten with clips. Put the bag on a grid shelf in a fairly hot oven. Bake for about 20 minutes. Dish up, and, if liked, pour round some anchovy sauce, and serve. Skate. Procure the skate skinned, cut into strips and twisted into rings. Skinning skate is a rather difficult operation; it is therefore advisable to get it ready skinned from the fishmonger. Put the fish into a well buttered paper-bag, with enough salted water to just cover it; add a bay leaf, a few slices of onion, and a dessert-spoonful of vinegar. Fold the bag and fasten with wire clips, then place it on a wire grid in a moderate oven, and cook for about 20 minutes. Take up the fish and drain, and put it on a hot dish. Pour over a little hot butter and some chopped parsley, garnish with slices of lemon, and serve.

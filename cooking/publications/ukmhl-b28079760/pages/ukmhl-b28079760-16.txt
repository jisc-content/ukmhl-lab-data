12 THE PAPER-BAG COOKERY MANUAL. well as food to be fried in deep fat, must still continue to be cooked after the old method, so that saucepan and casserole makers need not actually despair. Fresh meat of all descriptions can be satisfactorily cooked by the bag process; it does not lose nearly so much in weight as when other- wise cooked, and the flavour is vastly superior. Joints may be roasted to per- fection, and stews are excellent, whilst poultry and game, and fish especially, lend themselves admirably to the paper-bag method. Paper-bags again afford an ex- cellent protection to small or fancy bread, scones, cakes, and many puddings. They prevent scorching, and help to distribute the heat more evenly. Experiments in cooking pastry after this method have been entirely successful, as also with milk puddings. Many vegetables, too, are well adapted to being cooked in a bag, but the various plants of the cabbage tribe, and most green vegetables except peas, are best boiled in a saucepan to allow of the escape of purins. Our vegetarian friends have also been heard to say the same about game, and there is no doubt that people suffering from too much uric acid in the system would do well to avoid eating either game or vegetables that have been cooked in sealed paper.

538 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XXIV. dropped into cold water, and snaps between the teeth without sticking. Sugar, 1 lb.; butter, 5 ozs.; almonds, 2 ozs.: 20 to 30 minutes. CHOCOLATE DROPS. Throw into a well heated metal mortar from two to four ounces of the best quality of cake-chocolate, broken small, and pound it with a warm pestle until it resembles a smooth paste, or very thick batter; then add an equal weight of sugar, in the finest powder, and beat them until they are thoroughly blended. Roll the mixture into small balls, lay them upon sheets of writing paper or upon clean dishes, and take them off when they are nearly cold. The tops may be covered with white nonpareil comfits, or the drops may be shaken in a paper con- taining some of these, and entirely encrusted with them ; but it must be recollected that they will not adhere to them after they become hard. More or less sugar can be worked into the cho- colate according to the taste; and a Wedgwood mortar may be used for it when no other is at hand, but one of bell-metal will answer the purpose better. CHOCOLATE ALMONDS. When the chocolate has been softened, and mixed with an equal proportion of sugar, as directed in the foregoing receipt, enclose singly in small portions of it some almonds previously well dried, or even slightly coloured in the oven, after having been blanched. Roll them very smooth in the hand, and cover them with the comfits, or form them like the almond shamrocks of page 543. Filberts and pistachio-nuts may be substituted for the almonds with good effect; but they also must be per- fectly dry.

APPENDIX. CHERRY-BRANDT. ( Tappington Everard Receipt.) Fill to about two thirds of their depth, some wide-necked bottles with the small cherries called in the markets brandy- blacks ; pour in sufficient sifted sugar to fill up more than half of the remaining space, and then as much good French brandy as will cover the fruit, and reach to the necks of the bottles. Cork them securely, and let them stand for two months before they are opened: the liqueur poured from the cherries will be excel- lent, and the fruit itself very good. BRANDIED MORELLA CHERRIES. Let the cherries be ripe, freshly gathered, and the finest that can be had ; cut off half the length of the stalks, and drop them gently into clean dry quart bottles with wide necks; leave in each sufficient space for four ounces of pounded white sugar candy (or of brown, if better liked) ; fill them up entirely with the best French brandy, and cork them closely : the fruit will not shrivel if thus prepared. A few cherry, or apricot kernels, or a small portion of cinnamon, can be added when they are considered an improvement. PEACHES IN BRANDY. (Rotterdam, Receipt.) Prepare and stew some fine full-flavoured peaches by the receipt of page 430, but with two ounces more of sugar to the half pint of water; when they are tender put them, with their syrup, into glass or new stone jars, which they should only half fill; and when they are quite cold pour in white, or very pale, French brandy to within an inch and a half of the brims : a few peach or apricot kernels can be added to them. The jars must be corked down.

PREFACE. 3T entirely suited to the need of the totally inexperienced; none, in fact, which contained the first rudiments of the art, with direct tions so practical, clear, and simple, as to he at once understood, and easily followed, by those who had no previous knowledge of the subject. This deficiency, we have endeavoured in the present volume to supply, by such thoroughly explicit and minute instructions as may, we trust, be readily comprehended and carried out by any class of learners; our receipts, moreover, with a few trifling exceptions which are scrupulously specified, are confined to such as may be 'perfectly depended on, from having been proved beneath our own roof and under our own personal inspection.

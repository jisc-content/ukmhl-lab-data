XXIII. 516 MODERN COOKERY. rind mixed, and one ounce of citron; then add to them two ounces of flour, three quarters of a pound of sugar, a small teaspoonful of mace and cinnamon mixed, and the whites of three large eggs; roll the mixture into halls about the size of a large marble and bake them on wafer-paper twenty minutes in a moderate oven: they should be quite crisp, but not deeply coloured. Almonds, 8 ozs.; candied orange-rind, 6 ozs.; citron, 1 oz.; flour, 2 ozs.; sugar, f lb.; mace and cinnamon mixed, 1 tea- spoonful; whites of eggs, 3 large: baked, moderate oven, 20 minutes. Obs.â€”When the flavour is not disliked, it will be found an improvement to substitute an ounce of bitter almonds for one of the sweet; and we prefer the whole of the almonds and candied peel also cut into spikes instead of being chopped: the ingre- dients must then be made into a lither paste, and placed in small heaps on the paper.

Blanch, dry, and pound to the finest possible paste, eight ounces of fresh Jordan almonds, and one ounce of bitter; moisten them with a few drops of cold water or white of egg, to prevent their oiling; then mix with them very gradually twelve fresh eggs which have been whisked until they are exceedingly light; throw in by degrees one pound of fine, dry, sifted sugar, and keep the mixture light by constant beating, with a large wooden spoon, as the separate ingredients are added. Mix in by degrees three quarters of a pound of dried and sifted flour of the best quality; then pour gently from the sediment a pound of butter which has been just melted, but not allowed to become

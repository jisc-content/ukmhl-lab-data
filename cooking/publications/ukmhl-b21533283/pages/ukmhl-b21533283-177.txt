Prepare and plump two dozens of oysters as directed in the receipt above; add their strained liquor to a quarter-pint of thick melted butter made with milk, or with half milk and half water; stir the whole until it boils, put in the oysters, and when they are quite heated through, send the sauce to table without delay. Some persons like a little cayenne and essence of ancho- vies added to it when it is served with fish; others prefer the unmixed flavour of the oysters. Oysters, 2 dozens; their liquor; melted butter, \ pint. (Little cayenne and 1 dessertspoonful of essence of anchovies when liked.) SHRIMP SAUCE. The fish for this sauce should be very fresh.

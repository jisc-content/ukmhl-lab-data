[CHAP. VII. 166 MODERN COOKERY. meat over with it; put the rest in the dish with the fillet, after the tape has been removed from it, and send it directly to table.‚Äù Equal parts of Madeira and gravy are sometimes used to moisten the meat. No attempt should he made to braise a joint in any vessel that is not very nearly of its own size. A round of buttered paper is generally put over the more delicate kinds of braised meat, to prevent their being browned by the fire, which in France is put round the lid of the braising- pan, in a groove made on purpose to contain it. The embers of a wood fire mixed with the hot ashes, are best adapted to sustain the regular, but gentle degree of heat required for this mode of cooking. The pan shown at the head of this section, with a closely fitting copper tray, serving for the cover, is used commonly in Eng- land for braising; but a stewpan of modern form, or any other vessel which will admit of embers being placed upon the lid, will answer for the purpose as well. Copper stewpan. Common cooks sometimes stew meat in a mixture of butter and water, and call it braising. LARDING. Larding Pins. Cut into slices, of the same length and thickness, some bacon of the finest quality; trim away the outsides, place the slices evenly upon each other, and with a sharp knife divide them obliquely into small strips of equal size. For pheasants, par- tridges, hares, fowls, and fricandeaux, the bacon should be about the eighth of an inch square, and two inches in length ; but for meat which is to be larded quite through, instead of on the outside merely, the bits of bacon (properly called lardoons) must be at least the third of an inch square. In general, the breasts only of birds are larded, the backs and thighs of hares, and the whole of the upper surface of a frican- deau: these should be thickly covered with small lardoons,

NOTICE TO FIFTH EDITION. to young housekeepers. She has therefore now supplied them, in the best manner that time and circumstances would permit; and they are accompanied by a series of very superior illustra- tive engravings on steel, which do credit, she thinks, alike to the artist whose name is attached to them, and to the spirit and good taste of the publishers by whom they were decided on. It is improbable that, after these, any further additions will be made to the work, which has already been extended very far beyond its original limits. Her own exertions for it being thus apparently terminated, the Authoress hopefully commits its future fortunes to the public, whose reception of it has been marked by a degree of urbanity of which, through all her life, she will remain deeply sensible, Her task has been a laborious and a trying one; so much so, that she has been tempted often entirely to relinquish it; yet, in parting now from her kind readers, she sees it finally accomplished almost with regret. Note.â€”The Authoress has to acknowledge here her great obligation to M. Soyer of the Reform Club, who, to facilitate the progress of the plates, was so good as to direct the arrange- ment of many of the subjects, and allow drawings of them to be made under his own most able surveillance. Circumstances of the moment prevent the Authoress from entering, for the present, upon the further subjects on which she had proposed to offer some remarks; she will therefore hope to retract her adieu, and to make them hereafter an occa- sion of again addressing herself to her readers. April, 1846.

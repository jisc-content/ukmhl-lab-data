XXXUl TRUSSING. Trussing Needles. Common and untrained cooks are often deplorably ignorant of this branch of their business, a knowledge of which is, neverthe- less, quite as essential to them as is that of boiling or roasting, for without it they cannot, by any possibility, serve up dinners of decently creditable appearance.

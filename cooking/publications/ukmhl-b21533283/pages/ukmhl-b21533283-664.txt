APPENDIX. 584A SPRING SOUP AND SOUP A LA JULIENNE. Throw into three quarts of strong clear broth, or shin of beef stock, or of gravy-soup, half a pint each of turnips and carrots, prepared by the directions of page 5, or turned into any other shape that may be preferred, with rather less of the solid part of some white celery stems, and of leeks or of very mild onions mixed. The latter must, if used, be sliced, drawn into rings, and divided into slight shreds. When these have simmered from twenty to thirty minutes, add the leaves of one or two lettuces and a few of sorrel, trimmed or torn, about the size of lialf-a- crown. Continue the gentle boiling until these are tender, and at the moment of serving add half a pint of asparagus-points boiled very green, and as many French beans cut into small lozenges, and also boiled apart; or substitute green peas for these last. For the Julienne soup, first stew the carrots, &e. tolerably tender in a couple of ounces of butter ; pour the stock boiling to them; skim off all the fat from the surface, and finish -as above. Sprigs of chervil, spinage (boiled apart, and sparingly added), green onions, very small tufts of brocoli or cauliflower, may all be used in these soups at choice. Both the kind and the proportion of the vegetables can be regulated entirely by the taste. Bread stamped out with a very small round cutter, and dried a pale brown in the oven, is added generally to this spring soup, but is, we should say, no improvement. Winter vegetables should have three or four minutes previous boiling (or blanching) before they are put into the soup.

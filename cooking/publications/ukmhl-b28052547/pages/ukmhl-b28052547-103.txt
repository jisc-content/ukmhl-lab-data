PARTIES AND PARTY-GIVING 93 pinch of powdered mace, a liberal dust of pepper, and a little shallot juice. When sufficiently pounded, pass through a wire sieve and stir in by degrees a pint of very stiff white sauce and an ounce of bread-crumbs which have been soaked in a little milk or cream until they have absorbed all moisture. Spread this mixture out as directed for lobster cutlets. When quite cold make it into any fancy shapes that taste may indicate, or into small round balls ; egg and bread-crumb these, and fry them in deep fat. Care must be taken not to fry too many at once, or they will be spoilt. Drain care- fully. When cold, pile high upon a dish and garnish with parsley. Chicken cutlets are made in the same way, but are differently shaped. Shrimp patties are invariably appreciated by men folk. Take a dozen patty cases, scoop out the middle and fill them with the following mixture : Take fourpennyworth of picked shrimps and make them hot in some rich white sauce which has been strongly flavoured with essence of anchovy and tabasco or cayenne pepper. When per- fectly cold, scatter finely-chopped capers on top of each and then aspic jelly. Then curl a fillet of anchovy round and place on top. Arrange neatly on a fancy dish, and garnish either with thinly-sliced lemon or parsley. Fish Salad is also always appreciated if properly made. Take the meat of a lobster, a slice of cold boiled salmon, and the same quantity of cold turbot or halibut, flake carefully, and mix into a salad made according to directions given in a former chapter.

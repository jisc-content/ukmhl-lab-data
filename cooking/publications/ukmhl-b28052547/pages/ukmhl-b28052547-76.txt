66 DINNERS OF THE DAY dines, which, up to now, I have been unable to procure either potted or in glasses. I hope I have said enough in this chapter to convince you of the virtues and beauties of a well-stocked store cupboard. Not one of the articles mentioned above deteriorates in the least degree by keeping, if we except, perhaps, oil, and the one instance of tinned food ; and I can again assure you that, with a storehouse stocked after this fashion and the aid of the Dinners of the Day recipes, all things culinary are possible, even to a mistress of soaring gastronomic aspirations. Therefore let me once more reiterate my former advice ; never let even one article get low or exhausted, but replenish it beforehand ; for by so doing you will save yourself endless trouble and irritation.

MENUS AND RECIPES 267 little finely-chopped spring onions, some chopped tarragon and chervil, a teaspoonful of essence of anchovy, a squeeze of lemon or orange juice, and plenty of white pepper ; cayenne may be added to taste if liked. Fricassee of Rabbit.—The following method of cooking a rabbit will be found an immense improve- ment upon the old-fashioned and, truth to tell, some- what insipid “boiled rabbit smothered in onions Wash and wipe thoroughly clean a fresh rabbit, cut it into small joints, and place the pieces in a stew-pan with two ounces of butter, a little pepper, salt, and nutmeg. Let this simmer gently, but be careful to shake the stew-pan frequently, as the meat must not be allowed to acquire any colour. As soon as the rabbit begins to look cooked dredge in two ounces of flour, and add a dozen small onions (whole), a dozen mush- rooms, and a pint of weak stock or water. Continue stirring the fricassee till it boils, then draw it to one side, and let it simmer gently for thirty-five minutes. Skim carefully, and let the sauce reduce a little in order to thicken it. Then add a little sugar, a dust of cayenne, and the juice of half a lemon. Mix the yolks of two eggs with twopennyworth of cream, add this to the sauce, let it get very hot without boiling, dish up, and serve with plainly-boiled, floury potatoes, or potato snow. N.B.—This sauce is spoilt if allowed to boil after the cream and eggs have been added. They may both be omitted, and a glass of white wine used in their stead, if the sauce is considered too rich.

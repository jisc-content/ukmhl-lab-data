86 DINNERS OF THE DAY itself. If his wife be of an economical turn of mind, and everything is made at home, then his lot is indeed a hard one. But if she be at all ambitious, and has fiercely determined within herself “ to do the thing in style, and show those Browns what party-giving really is,” why, it is harder still, for the aid of the local confectioner is called in, and paterfamilias knows to his cost what he may expect when the bills make their appearance. An army of boys may be seen cautiously pursuing their way down the area steps, carrying mys- terious-looking trays and exchanging, apparently, much chaff and repartee with the cook and housemaid. The latter, as often as not, hasn’t troubled to don afternoon dress, and is minus her cap ; equally as often as not does it so happen that this is just the very time selected for a call on paterfamilias by his old friend, the Rev. Starche Straighte-Lace, whose wife is a perfect martinet in matters domestic, and who is therefore accustomed to seeing everything strictly cn regie at all times and seasons, even though the event be that all important one, “ a dinner to the county.” Consequently, pater- familias is vexed and annoyed, and says so in that charmingly frank manner which is so characteristic of the British householder, husband and “ head of a family.” Materfamilias is hurt, and reports to this effect; then there is a pleasant little domestic scene, and “ the head of the family ” announces that the next time he allows his house to be turned upside down in this nonsensical manner for any party, well—an expres- sive blank generally follows this.

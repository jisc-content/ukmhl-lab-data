DINNERS OF THE DAY 286 little chili vinegar, a gill of good brown sauce, a table- spoonful of finely-chopped parsley, a dessertspoonful of chopped shallots, two or three drops of tabasco, a pinch of sugar, and salt to taste. Work well together with a whisk till of the consistency of thick cream, then place on ice till required for use. This sauce is equally good for serving with plainly-boiled green artichokes, or cucumbers which have been stewed after the fashion mentioned in the foregoing recipe for saddle of lamb a la Milanaise. Chicken Cutlets a la Zingara.—Dip a sufficient number of lillets of cold underdone chicken into egg and bread-crumbs, and fry in boiling lard. When done, drain carefully upon clean kitchen paper, and dish up in a circle on a hot silver dish. Fill the centre with a ragout of truffles. Pour over some sauce Parisienne, and serve with endive salad. Custard Fritters a la Suisse.—Put into a basin a pint of double cream, the well-beaten yolks of ten eggs, an ounce of potato flour, some grated rind of lemon, and six ounces of sifted sugar. Whisk together for ten minutes, then strain through a sieve into a well- buttered mould, cover with buttered paper, tie round tightly, and steam for an hour and a half. When done place in the larder till cool; then imbed the mould in rough ice for half an hour. When turning out, cut the custard into slices about half an inch thick, and these again into squares of two inches each. Place upon a dish, sprinkle a little vanilla sugar upon each, and pour over all a liqueurglassful of either brandy or cura90a.

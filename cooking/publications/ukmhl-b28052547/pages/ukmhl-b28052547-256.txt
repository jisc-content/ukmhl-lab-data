Let it cool a little, and then add the yolks and whites of three eggs whisked separately ; when cold make into balls about the size of Tangerines, put a spoonful of marmalade in the centre of each, roll them in sweetened egg and bread-crumbs, and fry in boiling lard till of a light fawn colour ; drain on kitchen paper, scatter some sifted sugar over them, and serve immediately. Canapes of Cheese.—Stamp out some slices of stale bread, about half an inch thick, with a fancy cutter, fry these in boiling fat; when done, drain on kitchen paper and spread with the following mixture ; put an ounce of cheese, half an ounce of butter, half an ounce of salmon or bloater paste, quarter of a teaspoonful of red pepper, and a little lemon juice, in an enamelled saucepan ; stir carefully till very hot.

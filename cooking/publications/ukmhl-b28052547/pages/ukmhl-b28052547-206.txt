196 DINNERS OF THE DAY of ten eggs, grate three dozen sweet almonds into this, having previously blanched them in the usual way, and as soon as the milk reaches boiling point add it to the eggs, whisking vigorously all the time ; strain through a gravy- strainer, or small sieve, into the moulds, and either bake these in the oven or steam them in the usual manner till set. If to be served cold, they may be turned out and the top decorated with a little jelly, cut into stars, etc., or with strips of angelica cut thinly and placed latticewise. Another very nice pudding can be made by following the above recipe, but omitting the almonds, and substituting in their stead a little essence of coffee. This can be made at home by tying two or three ounces of coffee in a bit of muslin or cambric, and pouring over it just enough boiling water to give, say, two tablespoon- fuls of the essence. Lest this should sound a very extravagant method, I may add that the coffee need not be wasted, as it can still be used for the after-dinner cafe noir. This form of custard should be steamed, and served with a jelly sauce made as follows : Take a gill or more of cream, place it in a sauce-boat, and stand the latter in a stew-pan full of boiling water. Add to the cream two or more ounces of red currant jelly, and a dessertspoonful of either cognac or any liquor best liked ; stir over a slow fire until the cream has nearly reached boiling point, then add a little essence of vanilla, and send to table as quickly as possible. Note that, when making the above custards, the bay-leaf must be removed from the milk before it is added to the eggs, etc. END OF PART I.

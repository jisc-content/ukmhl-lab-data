2 I O DINNERS OF THE DAY through a hot gravy-strainer over the cod’s head, and serve with plainly-boiled potatoes. Shoulder of Lamb Maitre d’Hotel.—Select a lean shoulder, and get the butcher to bone it for you. Then fill the cavity with the following stuffing : Chop to- gether a fried shallot, an ounce of lean ham, two hard- boiled eggs, half a dozen olives, a teaspoonful of capers, and a truffle if possible—but this item is not absolutely necessary ; season with a pinch of spice and pepper and salt, and bind with the yolk of an egg. Roast the lamb in the usual way, using a little butter to baste it with. When thoroughly cooked, dish it up, and pour over it some maitre d’hotel sauce, and serve immediately ; as, if the sauce is allowed to chill, the flavour of the lamb will be completely spoilt. Brussels Tops a la Fran^aise.—Boil the Brussels tops till thoroughly cooked and of a good green colour, then drain them upon a sieve, chop finely, and put them into a saucepan with two ounces of fresh butter and a little pepper, salt, and nutmeg; toss well over a slow fire till all the butter is absorbed. Add a few drops of orange juice and a tablespoonful of well-flavoured tomato pulp. Make very hot, and serve with tiny fleurons of puff pastry. These can easily be made from the “ trimmings” from a tart. They are merely shapes of pastry, stamped out with a fancy cutter, and either baked in a very quick oven or fried in boiling lard. Brown Bread Pudding.—Take six ounces of stale brown bread-crumbs, six ounces of sugar, and half a pint of milk; then beat in by degrees the yolks of three eggs

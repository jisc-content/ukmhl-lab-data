SALADS AND SALAD-MAKING r - 5 expensive salad to make. Prepare a salade Franfaise as above directed ; next mix into it lightly a large tablespoonful of cream, half a pound of black grapes (each grape just “ pinched,” in order to allow the juice to escape), a thinly-sliced apple, and the peel from half a dozen Spanish Queen olives. Take the contents of a tin of Norwegian sardines, smoked; drain each sardine carefully upon clean kitchen-paper until all the oil is completely absorbed, add to the salad, and mix as lightly as possible. Chop finely equal quantities of tarragon, chervil, parsley, and shallot, mixed with a little orange juice and another tablespoonful of cream ; add to the salad, together with about fourpennyworth of picked shrimps, mix again, scatter chopped capers and grated hard-boiled yolk of egg on top, and serve with thinly-sliced brown bread and butter. This is an ideal salad to serve with the fish course at a cold supper. Indeed, the remains of cold boiled cod, if served up with the above salad as an accompaniment, will be found to have lost a great deal of its usual insipidity.

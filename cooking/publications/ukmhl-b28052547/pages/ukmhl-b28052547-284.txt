Tschi, a Russian Soup.â€”Peel and slice four large onions, and fry them with an ounce of butter till they are a bright brown colour, using for the purpose a deep enamelled stew-pan. Next add to the onions a finely-shredded white-heart cabbage (if cabbage is not obtainable spring greens may be used, but the soup will not be so good in this case). Fry for another ten minutes ; then dredge in by degrees two large tablespoonfuls of flour, stir well together with a wooden spoon, then add gradually three pints of good stock, season to taste with black pepper and salt and a pinch of powdered nutmeg. Draw the pan to the side of the fire, and simmer gently for an hour, taking care to skim it frequently. Just before sending to table, add a little lemon juice and a dessertspoonful of finely-chopped tarragon. When about to serve, place in the soup tureen two dozen little boules of sausage- meat, pour the soup over, and serve immediately. The boules are made as follows : Take a quarter of a pound of beef sausages, and the same quantity of pork ditto ; squeeze them out of their skins, and add to them a quarter of an ounce of bread-crumbs, a pinch of mixed herbs, a liberal grating of nutmeg, a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, and a little lemon juice ; mix and bind with the yolk of an egg, roll into little balls, cook thoroughly in a little weak stock, and use as above directed.

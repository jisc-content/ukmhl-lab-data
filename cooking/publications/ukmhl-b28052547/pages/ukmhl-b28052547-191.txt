TWO TO VAT MENUS 181 for this purpose). Have ready a pint and a half of puree of mushrooms ; pour this over and round the veal and serve as quickly as possible. Plainly-boiled spinach and fried or boiled potatoes should accompany this dish, which is one of the most delicious ways known of cooking veal. And here let me offer a word of advice as to the proper way of cooking that very ill-used vegetable yclept spinach. To begin with, it should never be boiled in water ; it possesses quite enough moisture of its own to enable it to be cooked without any extraneous aid from the tap in the scullery. The following is the correct method of procedure : Pick the spinach carefully, and look it well over, in order that any small insects which are in hiding may be promptly dislodged. Next wash it thoroughly at least six or eight timesâ€”the more the better, for spinach is always exceedingly full of grit. Drain it in a colander, and put it into an iron saucepan with a pinch of salt and just a dust of white pepper. Place the saucepan containing it at the side of the fire, and let it cook as slowly as possible, shaking it every few minutes at first. You will be astonished at the amount of moisture which you will find to run out of the spinach. When thoroughly cooked, drain it upon a hair sieve, place it upon the vegetable board, and chop finely or else pass it through a wire sieve (a coarse one is the best for this purpose). When sieved or chopped to your satisfaction, put it into a clean stew-pan with a bit of butter the size of a walnut, and a tablespoonful of either cream or good strong gravy ; the latter can be omitted if desired.

PARTIES AND PARTY-GIVING 87 Really, you know, all the foregoing fuss and commo- tion is absolutely unnecessary. In party-giving, as in everything, method only is the one golden path that leads to success. To begin with, if your means are small, don’t attempt to “ do things in style,” or to be ostentatious ; believe me, the only thing you u osten- tate ”—to coin a word—by such a course is the inade- quacy of your income. You don’t succeed—how can you expect to ?—in persuading people that your income reaches four figures when in reality it is under or only just five hundred per annum. That way debt and discomfort lie—most emphatically not success. Better by far the simplest refreshments, daintily served and dispensed by a hostess serene and at her ease and deft servants who, though they be but two in number, have yet been well and carefully trained by their mistress, than all Guzzard’s and Bunter’s elegancies, handed by an army of haughty waiters and—unpaid for. Also, why upset the house for days beforehand ? This also is quite unnecessary ; so is the bill you persist in incurring for palms, etc. Why hire these at all ? Two or three (five, if you like) shillings worth of flowers would answer your purpose well or even better ; and besides, your friends are perfectly cognisant of the fact that you don’t as a rule have those palms elegantly grouped around the entrance to the conservatory, “ banked up ” in the drawing-room fireplace if it is summer, or grace- fully disposed upon the top and in the curve of the grand piano if it happens to be winter, and are well aware that you hired them from the local florist.

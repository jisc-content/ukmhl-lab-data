DINNERS OF THE DAY 130 of three eggs ; make very hot without actually boiling, and serve immediately. Apples can be used in place of plums when the latter are out of season. So much for sweet dishes, wherein fruit figures largely. I shall give you some savoury recipes of the same character in another chapter ; but let me repeat that it is really difficult in this England of ours for either children or grown-up people to take too much fruit, since the tendency is so much the other wayâ€” always within reasonable limits that is, and always excepting uncooked stone fruit. On this latter point it is well to be particular, more especially when catering for delicate children or adults ; indeed, the former should be strictly forbidden to indulge in plums, greengages, or damsons without express permission being first given, since they cannot, by reason of their inexperience, discriminate between ripe and over-ripe plums with the degree of nicety absolutely necessary where stone fruit is concerned. An odd-sounding but very good dish for nursery tea is poached fruit eggs. Stew a pound and a half or two pounds of any fruit best liked and reserve the juice, sieve the remainder of the fruit and place it on a hot dish ; allow an egg for each child, pour the fruit juice into a clean enamelled sauce- pan, and poach the eggs in it; when done, place on squares of toasted bread in the sieved fruit, pour over and around the remaining juice ; sift a little sugar over, and serve. Children who cannot touch eggs cooked in any other way invariably like them when served after the foregoing fashion.

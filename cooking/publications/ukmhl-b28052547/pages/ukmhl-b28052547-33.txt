23 AN ENGLISH v. A FRENCH DINNER Pommes aux Sirop des Fraises. — Select four apples of a size ; there will be about four to a pound. Wash, and core them with a vegetable-cutter or apple-corer, if you are lucky enough to possess one. Do not peel them. Fill the hollow centre of each with a spoonful of strawberry jam, and bake in the oven till cooked. When about to serve whip two pennyworth of cream, with a little sugar and vanilla ; place a spoonful on the top of each apple, and send to table immediately. Cost : apples, 3d. ; cream, 2d. ; jam., etc., id. And now, dear madame, I think you will find that the total cost of my dinner, including 2d. for bread for the table and the croutons for the Chou d la Crane, is 4s. 9d., as opposed to your “ simple ” English dinner costing 8s. ! Now don’t, as a favour, please, tell me that French cooking is “ expensive ” again. Re- member that, with the difference saved—3s. 3d. in this one instance only—one can do a good deal in these hard times. The above, too, is but an example of what you can do upon little. For you are not obliged to follow out the menus herein set down if your means do not admit of it. You can use your own judgment and select the cheapest dishes from among them, and you will still always be sure of having something satisfying, economical, and out of the common.

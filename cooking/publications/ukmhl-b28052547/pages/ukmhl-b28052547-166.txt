DINNERS OF THE DAY 156 minutes, and serve with grated cheese handed separately. Bretonne sauce is made as follows : Chop two large onions finely, place them in a stewpan with an ounce of butter, and fry till of a bright brown colour. Then add half a pint of brown roux and a gill of good stock, season with pepper and salt, boil slowly for five minutes without reducing, pass through a hair sieve, and use as directed. For children, macaroni a la vanille is prepared as follows : Boil a pound of macaroni, drain, and cut it into two-inch lengths. Put a pint and a half of new milk into a clean enamelled saucepan with four ounces of sifted sugar and a bit of vanilla stick. Let the macaroni cook gently till all the milk is absorbed, then serve with sweetened or Devonshire cream. I hope I have said enough in the above recipes to prove to you that macaroni cookery is not bounded, north, east, west and south, by the cheese entree of that name and a milk pudding. Special Dinner.

Mouton a la Framjaise.—Take a leg or shoulder of mutton, and having got your butcher to bone it for you, fill the cavity with the following farce. Chop together two large mushrooms, two shallots, an ounce of lean ham, an ounce each of bread-crumbs and suet ; bind with yolk of egg and season with pepper and salt. Trim off all superfluous fat and braise the mutton in about a pint of well-flavoured weak stock, with a clove of garlic and a bouquet garni in it. This will take about three hours. When done, place the joint in the oven to brown, skim carefully all grease from the stock it was braised in, thicken it with an ounce of butter, and add a spoonful of soy. Remove the garlic, boil up for ten minutes, pass through a hot strainer over the mutton, and serve.

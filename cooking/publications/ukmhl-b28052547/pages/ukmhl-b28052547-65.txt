THE FALSE ECONOMIST 55 write of, and which I myself have frequently seen my “ over-thrifty ” sisters purchasing in the morning as I passed by. It is always a marvel to me why the vestries do not swoop down upon such so-called provision dealers, for—at any rate in the one of which I write— the smell from the “ slightly tainted ” rabbits, hares, ducks, fowls, and so forth, is sometimes positively sickening.

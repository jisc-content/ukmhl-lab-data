Grenadines of Yeal with Spinach.—Take a large cutlet of veal of about, say, a pound and a half, or a pound and three-quarters in weight, and cut it into neat fillets ; place some slices of fat bacon in a deep enamelled iron saucepan, add a finely-minced carrot and shallot and the pieces of veal, pour over the whole a pint of good stock, and simmer gently at the side of the stove till thoroughly cooked ; then take them out, drain carefully, and place upon a very hot dish, garnish with forcemeat balls and a puree of spinach. Have ready the same number of poached eggs as there are fillets, place an egg upon each grenadine, and send to table at once. Note, however, that the success or non- success of this latter depends almost entirely upon the degree of carefulness with which the spinach is washed, as any grit, however slight, is sufficient to spoil an otherwise excellent puree. Saute potatoes should also accompany the grenadines of veal. They are prepared as follows : Take a sufficient quantity of cold boiled potatoes, and cut them into slices a little less than a quarter of an inch thick ; place two ounces of butter in a clean enamelled frying-pan, and as soon as it boils add the potatoes, together with a teaspoonful of finely- chopped parsley ; fry for five or six minutes, then take out quickly, drain upon clean kitchen paper, scatter powdered parsley on top, and use as above directed.

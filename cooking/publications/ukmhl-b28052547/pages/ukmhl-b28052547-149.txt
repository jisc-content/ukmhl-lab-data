SUNDAY SUPPERS 139 Braised Ox-Cheek a la Bretonne.—This is a very in- expensive and at the same time a very substantial dish. Get your butcher to bone an ox-cheek for you ; then steep it in cold water and a spoonful of vinegar for about two hours. Next parboil it for live minutes, and then drain and rinse it in cold water. Drain again, and place it in a deep braising-pan with an onion stuck with cloves, two carrots, a bay-leaf, twenty peppercorns, and a blade of mace. Pour over it about a pint and a half of good stock, and set it to braise slowly over a slack lire. This will take about two hours. When sufficiently cooked, take it out, drain, and cut it into neat fillets. Put a little of the liquor in which the ox-cheek was cooked into a clean stew-pan, and let it reduce to half glaze ; then add the fillets, and braise them over the fire for three or four minutes. Next arrange them on a hot dish, garnish with a border of boiled peas, and pour over and round about half a pint of the following sauce : Peel and slice three large onions, put an ounce of butter into a clean frying-pan, and, as soon as it oils, add the sliced onions, a pinch of salt, a dust of white pepper, and a very tiny piece of finely-chopped garlic. Fry till of a light fawn colour, then add half a pint of brown sauce, a tablespoonful of rich gravy, and, if liked, a few chopped capers ; boil for ten minutes, sieve, and use as directed above. Haricots Yerts a la Frangaise.—If the recipe for this is considered too expensive, the butter and cream may be omitted, and white sauce, with a spoonful of gravy and a squeeze of lemon juice, used instead.

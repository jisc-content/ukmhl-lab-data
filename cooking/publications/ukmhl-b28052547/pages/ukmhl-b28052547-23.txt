THE STOCK POT 13 there is no end to the dainty hunger-inducing and satisfying soups which carefully-prepared stock, such as I have above indicated, will produce. To mention yet one other, peel and slice six large onions, add to a quart of stock, and simmer, without allowing your stock to reduce. When the onions are thoroughly cooked you have the delicious “ Bouillon a l’Ognon ” so much appreciated by our friends across the Channel. I shall go more fully into this subject in another chapter and give you some recipes for the many delicious and too little known purees of various kinds ; and also for the production of fish-stock, scups, and bisques, all as inexpensive and appetising in their way as those above indicated.

MENUS AND RECIPES neat diamond-shaped pieces. If possible add a finely- chopped truffle and a few halved button mushrooms previously cooked in a little white broth and drained on a sieve. Add this mixture to the Supreme sauce, stir gently till thoroughly mixed, then use it to fill the centre of the patty cases. Put a button mushroom on top of each, and place in a very hot oven for ten minutes. Serve immediately, or the pastry will “ fall ” and be spoilt. Roast Guinea-Fowls—Salad.—Directions for cook- ing these have already appeared in a former chapter. A delightful variety of salad for serving with them can be made as follows : String a pound of red currants, selecting if possible those of a larger sort ; then wash and dry, free from moisture, a couple of lettuces ; tear these into pieces, and place in a salad bowl with as much finely-chopped garlic as would go on the point of a very small knife ; add the currants, two tablespoon- fuls of oil, a tablespoonful of either lemon juice or tarragon vinegar, whichever flavour is preferred, and pepper and salt to taste ; mix thoroughly, add a drop of tabasco, and serve immediately. Note.—All salads should be made only just before using or they will be flabby, and consequently spoilt. Note also that lettuces for a salad should never be cut with a knife, but, if the leaves are too large for use as they are, should be torn apart with the fingers.

DINNERS OF THE DAY 5« her always remember that trop de zele is as bad as no zeal at all, and that meanness and niggardliness are not thrift, but, as I said before, the falsest of all false economy. With the help of the recipes given, the most thrifty housewife of you all should yet contrive to save more than by cooking in the English fashion, can have a greater choice of and more dainty dishes, and all this without buying the most expensive joints, poultry, or fish, and without resorting to that basest of all means of keeping down the weekly bills, the buying of impure food, which in the end must mean a sacrifice of health. Better pay the butcher twice over than the doctor— estimable gentleman !—once. The same remark holds good with reference to the greengrocer, baker, and milkman. Apropos of the knight of the shining cans and unmelodious cry, let me warn the too thrifty housewife of the folly of purchasing what is known as “ skim milk ” for drinking, or indeed any purpose, where children are concerned. Milk from which the cream has been extracted loses most of its goodness and all its nourishing properties, since it becomes thereby deficient in fatty matter. By all means use it for purees or puddings for yourselves, if you think fit to do so, but never, under any circumstances, when preparing food for the “ times ”—not even for that delight of childhood’s days, a nursery pudding. You will reap your reward in days to come, when your children have grown into the fine women and sturdy men for whom England has from all time been famed.

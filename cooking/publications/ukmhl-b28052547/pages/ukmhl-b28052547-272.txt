262 DINNERS OF THE DAY mace, and four or five ounces of red currant jelly. Let all simmer gently for about fifteen minutes, then strain through a hair sieve ; return to saucepan, make very hot (but do not allow it to become reduced), and use for whatever purpose is desired. Mustard sauce is a very good one for serving with broiled or fried herrings, or, indeed, with any kind of fried fish. Melt an ounce and a half of fresh butter ; as soon as it oils, mix in carefully a good spoonful of French mustard, a teaspoonful of anchovy essence, a dessertspoonful of chili vinegar, and a tablespoonful of very thick brown sauce. If to be served with herrings, add the soft roes, make hot, pass through a gravy- strainer, and use as required. Mushroom sauce is another easily made and very appetising sauce. For this proceed as follows : Fry a dozen small mushrooms in half an ounce of butter ; when done, add by degrees half a pint of good brown roux, a glass of mushroom catsup, half a glass of sherry, and a pinch of pepper and sugar ; boil carefully for ten minutes, then remove any grease that may have risen ; stir in a tablespoonful of cream, boil up again, without reducing, and use as needed.

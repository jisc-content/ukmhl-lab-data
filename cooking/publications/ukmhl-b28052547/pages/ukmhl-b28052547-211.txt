Ox-cheek Soup.—Take a fresh ox-cheek and braise it gently in a stew-pan with three pints of weak stock from a “ second boiling,” a large onion, a carrot, a turnip, a blade of mace, six cloves, and several pepper- corns, add salt to suit your own taste. When the ox- cheek is done, take the meat from the bone and put it to press between two heavy dishes. Strain the soup through a hair sieve, and add a teaspoonful of soy to colour it ; then clarify it according to directions given in a former chapter, using for the purpose the whites and shells of two eggs, but omitting the raw beef. Next, cut the ox-cheek into small neat pieces about an inch square, and put them into a saucepan with some carrots which have been sliced and cut into fancy shapes, and a few small onions.' These must be previously cooked in a little weak stock. As soon as the soup is properly clarified pour it upon the vegetables, cheek, etc. ; add a lump of sugar. Boil up gently for ten minutes and serve. This will be found a cheap and very substantial soup, especially where a large family has to be catered for.

DINNERS OF THE DAY 140 Apples and Strawberries (French fashion).â€”Peel, core, and slice a dozen apples; place them in a saucepan with three ounces of butter, the juice of a large lemon, four ounces of butter, four ounces of pounded loaf sugar (more will be required if the apples are green and sour) and a piece of cinnamon stick or a pinch of cinnamon powder ; add a tablespoonful of brandy, and let them stewT very slowly over a slack lire ; when they are thoroughly done, remove the cinnamon stick, and add about two pounds of ripe strawberries ; boil for another live minutes, and then dish up in a deep bowl, and place in the larder till cold. When sufficiently cool, pour over the fruit about a pint and a half of custard, made with the yolks of eggs only. Whip the whites separately till they meringue, then add a large spoonful of sifted sugar and a few drops of vanilla essence. Just before serving, pile up as high as pos- sible on top of the fruit and custard. Wafer biscuits should be handed separately with this dish, which is much improved by being placed upon ice for an hour before using.

MENUS AND RECIPES 229 brown Italian sauce, simmer gently for fifteen minutes, and when very hot serve, garnished with a border of plainly-boiled peas. Italian sauce is made as follows : Chop half a dozen shallots very finely, rinse them in cold water, drain, and put them into a clean enamelled saucepan with four ounces of finely chopped mush- rooms, a bay-leaf, a pinch of sweet herbs, and either an ounce of butter or a tablespoonful of salad oil. Fry till of a light brown colour. Then add a gill of stock, and a gill of thick brown sauce. Simmer gently for ten minutes, take out the bay-leaf, sieve, and use as above directed. This is a most delicious sauce if carefully made. Note that the shallots must on no account be allowed to burn. Cucumbers a la Poulette.—When cucumbers are so cheap this can certainly not be called an expensive entree. It is a most uncommon one, and rarely met with at English tables. (Recipe, see page 239.) Here is another strawberry sweet, very easy of preparation. Strawberry Custard.—Make a pint and a half of boiled custard in the ordinary manner. Sieve two pounds of ripe strawberries, using for the purpose a coarse one of wire. Mix the strawberry pulp with the custard. Add half a pound of whole strawberries, which have first been duly stalked ; place upon ice till needed, and serve with wafer biscuits. If ice is not obtainable, immerse the bowl of custard in a larger basin half full of cold water and leave in the larder till needed for use.

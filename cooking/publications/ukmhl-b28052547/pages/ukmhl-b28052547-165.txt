MACARONI AND HOW TO COOK IT 155 an ounce of very mild grated cheese, fill up the croustade with the macaroni, scatter brown sugar on top, make hot in a very quick oven, and serve directly.

Macaroni au Jus..—Boil half a pound of macaroni, drain, and cut it up into three-inch lengths. Have ready a stew-pan containing half a pint of strong chicken broth (unclarified). Place the macaroni in this ; add a small bottle of capers and any little pieces of cold chicken, freed from skin and bone, which may have been left from the previous day’s dinner, and an ounce of grated cheese. Make very hot, and serve with fried croutons. Macaroni a la Provengale.—Boil half a pound of macaroni and drain, but do not cut it up. Rub a stew- pan with a clove of garlic, put into it a gill of Lucca oil, place the pan over a slow fire, and as soon as the oil boils add half a dozen finely-minced shallots. Fry for two or three minutes, then add the macaroni, and con- tinue tossing over the fire till all the oil is absorbed. Serve immediately upon a very hot dish and with grated cheese handed separately. Macaroni a la Bretonne.—Boil a pound of macaroni, drain it carefully, and cut it into lengths.

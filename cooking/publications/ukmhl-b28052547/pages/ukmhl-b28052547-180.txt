170 DINNERS OF THE DAY feminine readers—it is far, far better for the com- plexion. By a diner maigre I do not mean a con- glomeration of badly-cooked herbs, onions, rice, and carrots—the which I have, alas ! too often had to make a pretence of eating at the houses of my vegetarian friends ; and I do not intend a cabbage stewed with a distinctly sugary sauce to figure as the principal dish of the menu, for on one never-to-be-forgotten occasion I partook of this. I draw a veil over my subsequent feelings, and will only remark that I know of but one dish which I can conscientiously say is worse, and that is the aforementioned cauliflower and sweet tomato sauce. I append a menu and recipes for a dinner with- out meat. Try it for yourselves, and then you will realise what French vegetarian cookery really is—always providing, of course, that the instructions given are well and carefully carried out. Mind, I do not advise a dinner of this kind as a regular thing, and not at all in very cold weather, but for, say, one day in the week during the hot season such a meal will be found not only a pleasant but a healthful change from the eternal roast and boiled meats, which are apt to lose much of their wonted savour at certain seasons of the year.

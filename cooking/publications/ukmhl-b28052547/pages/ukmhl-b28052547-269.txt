259 MENUS AND RECIPES Grosse Meringue aux Amandes. — Prepare some meringue as directed in a former chapter, using for the purpose the whites of ten or twelve eggs. When of the right consistency, take six or eight cheese plates, selec- ting for preference those with a broad rim. Grease slightly the rim of the plates. Then pile the meringue paste upon the rim only, to about the depth of an inch and a half, leaving the centre of each plate empty. Bake in a slow oven till of a light fawn colour. When cool, slip each circle of meringue carefully off its plate. Pile the circles one upon the other with strawberry jam between each, fill the centre with whipped cream sweetened to taste and flavoured with vanilla, scatter finely-chopped sweet almonds thickly upon the top, and serve with strawberry wafers. Bouchees Imperials.—Take some thin slices of salame, chop them very finely, and mix with them a large spoonful of rich white sauce and half a teaspoon- ful of cayenne. When this mixture is quite cool, roll it into little balls about the size of a walnut, dip each into batter, and fry in boiling lard. When done, drain quickly, scatter some salt and finely-chopped gherkins on top of each, and serve immediately. The above are also improved by a dust of Parmesan cheese, but this should not be added when, as is the case in the fore- going menu, cheese has been employed in the making of any previous dish.

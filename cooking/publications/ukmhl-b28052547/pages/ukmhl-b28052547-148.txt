Salmon Fritters, with Curry Sauce.—This is a good way of using up any pieces of cold salmon which may have been left from a previous day’s dinner. Divide the salmon with a silver knife into pieces of about two inches square ; marinade them for a few minutes, then drain carefully, and dip each piece into some light frying-batter. Have ready a saucepanful of boiling lard, throw in the fritters, and fry till of a bright, light brown colour. Take out quickly, drain upon clean kitchen paper, and serve with curry sauce. The frying- batter should be made about an hour before it is likely to be required.

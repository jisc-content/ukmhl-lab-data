DINNERS OF THE DAY 190 To powder parsley quickly, it should first be dipped in boiling water for an instant, and then placed on a plate in a quick oven for a couple of minutes ; take out, and rub between your two hands over the dish for which it is required. Note : your hands must be scrupulously clean and very dry to do this successfully. Also do not leave the parsley too long in the oven, or it will become brown and consequently spoilt. Rice (Polish Fashion).—A recipe for this has already been given. It can be varied, however, by the addition of a little saffron, if the flavour is liked ; in this case the picked shrimps should be omitted, and the remains of any white meat from a cold chicken substituted instead. Currant Sago.—Stalk an equal quantity of red and black currants—they must weigh just a pound when stalked ; stew them with sugar sufficient to render them very sweet; then sieve and mix with an ounce of coarse sago which has been previously well soaked ; add the juice of half a lemon, and if needed a little more sugar ; cook gradually over a very slow fire for three-quarters of an hour, stir continuously to avoid burning, but do not allow the mixture to become reduced. Rinse out a jelly mould with cold water, and as soon as the sago is thoroughly cooked use it to fill the mould; place in a cool corner of the larder till quite cold, then turn out carefully, and serve with lemon custard poured over and around it. If the flavour of essence of lemon is not liked, vanilla or almond may be used in its stead. Note that boiled custard, to be served in perfection, must always be carefully strained.

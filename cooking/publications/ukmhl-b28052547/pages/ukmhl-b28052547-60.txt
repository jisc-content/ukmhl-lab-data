DINNERS OF THE DAY 5° mencement before her, and seeing that she watches with due care and attention. By work I mean the ordinary everyday routine of her duties. Write these out clearly and concisely for her upon a piece of card- board, and nail it behind the kitchen door ; then, if she follows out your orders, there will be no need for her to complain that she is u rushed,” save upon some all- important occasion, such as a dinner or supper party, when extra help should always be allowed. After all, you pay her a reasonable wage to do your work; there- fore, why lower yourself in her estimation by paying her money for labour you afterwards carry out with your own hands ? Better by far save your purse and do without such so-called help, or adopt the more sensible plan. Further, when engaging her, make her fully understand that if her work is not performed to your full satisfaction she will be cautioned twice, but not a third time, and that repeated faults of any descrip- tion will entail dismissal. Now, as to the training in cookery itself. Begin by teaching her to produce good stock, both thick and clear. The recipe—I have already given it to you—is so simple and concise that even the most unintelli- gent of cooks should be able to carry it out unaided. From soup, go on to the easiest modes of cooking fish. That recipe for coquilles is a good one to begin with, but take care that it is strictly adhered to, or failure will result. After the fish, let her essay a simple braise—for example, fillet of beef or shoulder of mutton are both fairly easy of accomplishment.

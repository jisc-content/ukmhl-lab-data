A very delicious and inexpensive pudding can be made from gingerbread if the following recipe is care- fully carried out : Take three-quarters of a pound of gingerbread and break it into small pieces. Place these in a mortar and moisten them with a very little milk ; then pound them vigorously until the)7 become a thick paste. Next add to the paste half an ounce of finely- chopped candied peel, a tablespoonful of treacle, and the well-beaten yolks of three eggs. Should the paste seem at all heavy, or be considered too thick, add a little more milk. Mix thoroughly. Finally add the whites of the eggs, whisked to a stiff froth. Fill a well- greased mould with the mixture, steam for two hours, and serve with a little golden syrup poured over, or else with brandy sauce. Note that the golden syrup should first be made hot before being used. The brandy sauce is too well known to need description. Almond custard is another pudding which is in- variably appreciated, and if baked or steamed in small white dariole moulds—one of these must be allowed for each guest—always presents a dainty appearance. It is made as follows : Put a quart of new milk into a clean enamelled iron saucepan ; add sufficient nutmeg or cinnamon to flavour it to your own taste, a bay-leaf, and enough sifted sugar to render it very sweet. Bring gently to the boil. Have ready the well-beaten yolks

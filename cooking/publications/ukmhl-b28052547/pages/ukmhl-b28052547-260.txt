DINNERS OF THE DAY 250 day, the following will be found an equally nice and economical fashion for improving upon our old enemy, hashed mutton. Cut the remains of a leg of mutton into fine long shreds. Put an ounce of butter or clari- fied fat into a stew-pan, with an ounce of flour and a couple of finely-chopped shallots. Stir this mixture rapidly till it is of a bright fawn colour ; then add a glass of “cooking” port, a glass of Harvey sauce, a little grated nutmeg and lemon rind, pepper and salt to taste. Add the shreds of mutton. Make very hot, stirring rapidly all the time, and serve with a border of mashed potatoes.

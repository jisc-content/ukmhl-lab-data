102 DINNERS OF THE DAY described. I hope I have said enough in this chapter to convince you that dainty dinner-tables and fresh flowers thereon are not an undue extravagance, and that narrow means need be and are no excuse for slovenliness. For, though we cannot all own family plate and cut-glass of fairy-like fragility, yet the simpler products of nineteenth-century good taste are within the means of most of us, if we exercise due care and discretion when adding to our stock of household gods. One more suggestion for decoration before I attend to the less spiritual needs of the eaters of dinners of the day. Beg, borrow or buy a Gris de Flandres jug or bowl (they only cost 2s. 9d.), fill it with blue flags, place it on a slip of lavender-grey velvet, and that rarity of nowadays, a new sensation, shall be yours. Note, however, that this also is a daylight decoration.

297 MENUS AND RECIPES a remnant of cold beef or mutton, not large enough to serve for a ragout, and yet too large to give to the cat, is left over. 11 It’s only fit for rissoles,” says cook dubiously. Now the ordinary rissole of the average cook is a thing to fill one with dread. It is almost always a lumpy ball, hard as a bullet, and consisting principally, so far as our taste can make out, of half- cooked bits of onion. Still, you don’t like to waste that piece of meat, so, with a sigh, you assent to cook’s pro- position. Try the following recipe next time you find yourself upon the horns of such a dilemma, and I think you will agree with me that there is a very great and marked improvement possible. Pass the cold beef or mutton through the mincing machine, having previously freed it from every vestige of skin and fat. Then add to it about a third of its weight in stale bread-crumbs which have been soaked in a little milk. Season to taste with pepper and salt, add a pinch of mixed herbs and a little grated shallot—mind, not chopped, grated. Next add a large teaspoonful of grated lemon-peel. Have ready a sufficient quantity of stiff brown or white sauce—it doesn’t matter which, but it must be rich and well flavoured. Mix thoroughly with the minced beef, etc., then spread out upon a large dish to the depth of about half an inch, and place in the larder to get cold. When sufficiently cool, stamp out into shape with a fancy cutter, or make it into small round balls or large corks. Egg and bread-crumb these in the usual way, and fry in deep lard or fat. Serve garnished with fried parsley, and surrounded by a wall of mashed potatoes

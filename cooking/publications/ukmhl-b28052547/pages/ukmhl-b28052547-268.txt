258 DINNERS OF THE DAY croutons, each spread with green butter. Indian corn sauteed in a little butter, and flavoured with mignonette pepper, should accompany this dish. N.B.—Pigeons or any other small birds can also be cooked after the foregoing fashion when widgeon are not in season. Cr6me d’Oliyes a la Propert (original).—Take a shilling bottle of Spanish olives, empty them into a dish, and pour away the brine. Next, pour over the olives about half a pint of nearly boiling water. Let them soak in this for ten minutes. Pour away the water, drain them upon a dry cloth or sieve, and peel them carefully. Put them into a mortar with about an ounce of butter, and pound vigorously for five minutes. Then pass through a sieve. Have ready a gill and a half of very rich chicken stock (unclarified), stir the olives into this, add a good pinch of nutmeg, a teaspoonful of white pepper, and a gill of cream which has a clove of garlic steeped in it. Mix well together, then add by degrees the well-beaten yolks of four eggs and half a dozen Norwegian sardines cut into small pieces. Finally, stir in as lightly as possible the whites of five eggs whisked to a firm froth. Fill a well- buttered mould with this mixture, and steam for two hours. Turn out carefully, and serve with the follow- ing sauce poured over and around it : To half a pint of rich butter sauce add five or six ounces of grated Dutch cheese, stir over the fire till very hot, add a dozen Norwegian sardines cut into small pieces, boil up again and use as directed above.

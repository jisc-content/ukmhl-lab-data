Cream of Rice.—Add to three pints of good stock a pound of parboiled rice, then set the saucepan to simmer gently over a slow fire for an hour, by which time the rice should be thoroughly cooked. Pass it through a hair sieve, and then return to a clean saucepan. When the soup is needed, add to it a gill of cream and the well-beaten yolks of two eggs. The cream may be omitted if desired, and milk used in its stead. In this case a small pat of butter must be added. Make very hot without actually boiling, and serve as quickly as possible. Care must be taken when boiling the rice that the stock does not reduce. This will be found a very inexpensive and palatable soup. Cod’s Head Baked.—Put some veal stuffing into the hollow of the gills, and place the cod’s head on a deep fireproof baking-dish. Season it well with a little chopped shallot, parsley, pepper and salt; add a glass of sherry, two glasses of mushroom catsup, some small pieces of butter, and about a gill of stock ; place it in the oven for ten minutes, basting frequently, then remove it, scatter plenty of fried bread-crumbs over the surface, and return to the oven. When it is thoroughly cooked place upon a hot dish, add to its sauce a gill of brown roux, a teaspoonful of essence of anchovy, and the juice of half a lemon. Boil up for live minutes. Pass 15

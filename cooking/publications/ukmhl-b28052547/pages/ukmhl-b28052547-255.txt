245 MENUS AND RECIPES beat to a very stiff cream, then add by degrees a little lemon juice. Send the sole to table with maitre d’hotel sauce served separately in a sauce tureen. Maitre d’Hotel Sauce.—To a gill of white sauce add a little mushroom juice, a tablespoonful of finely- chopped parsley, pepper and salt, the juice of half a lemon, and a little nutmeg. Make very hot and serve as directed. Poulet a la Gudewife.—This is a delicious and little known method of cooking a fowl. Truss the bird as if for boiling, and put it into a saucepan with half a pound of ham cut into squares. Fry over a slack fire till the fowl is well browned all over. Then add four or five Spanish onions cut into very thin slices, and two large tablespoonfuls of chutnee. Let the whole simmer gently for three-quarters of an hour—longer time will be needed if the fowl is old. When cooked, arrange on a very hot dish, run the sauce through a hot strainer, and serve with grilled tomatoes and either boiled or fried potatoes. Game of any kind can also be cooked in this fashion, and will be found equally good. Artichauts a l’ltalienne.—Peel and parboil two pounds of white artichokes, place them in a stew-pan, spread thickly with butter, season highly with pepper, salt, nutmeg, and a little lemon juice ; add just enough strong chicken stock to cover them. Simmer carefully over a slow fire for about half an hour. By this time the artichokes should have acquired a deep yellow colour. Arrange them on a hot dish ; reduce the sauce to just a gill, pour it over them, and serve immediately.

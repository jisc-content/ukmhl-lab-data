Croustade aux CerYelles.—Prepare a croustade according to instructions given in a former chapter, taking care that the lard in which it is fried has reached the right degree of heat, as if this is not attended to carefully the croustade will be completely spoilt, and only fit for the pig-tub. Next take two sets of calves’ brains, and, having cleansed them in the usual way, proceed to blanch them till they are fairly white. Then place them in a deep saute-pan with a quart of nearly boiling water, two large tablespoonfuls of vinegar, a turnip, an onion stuck with cloves, a carrot, a pinch of mixed herbs, and a bay-leaf ; add pepper and salt to taste, and simmer for twenty minutes gently over a slow fire ; then remove the brains to a plate with a straining spoon, and add the liquor they were cooked in to the stock-pot; next drain the brains carefully, and trim them into neat fillets ; make the croustade very hot, and place the brains in it. Have ready half a pint of matelotte sauce, pour over the brains, cover the top of the croustade completely with button mushrooms which have been previously sauteed in butter and then drained carefully. Place in a hot oven for a couple of minutes and serve immediately. In matelotte sauce omit the essence of anchovy when making for the above purpose.

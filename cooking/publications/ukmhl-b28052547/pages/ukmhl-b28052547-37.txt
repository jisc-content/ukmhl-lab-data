27 “ ECO NO MIC A L MEALS ” “ Oh, but fish is almost always so dear ; you can’t deny that, Mrs. Careful Cook.” May I propound another startling theory ? Fish is always cheap, providing, that is, you buy the right sort of the finny delicacy ; and by the right sort I mean that which is in season and plen- tiful, and consequently cheap. You must keep yourself well posted in the fluctuations of the fish market as represented to you by the local fishmongers’ shops, and you will have no need to complain that fish is “ so dear.” If, however, you will insist on purchasing salmon when it is 4s. or 5s. a pound, why then the blame will rest with yourself, most assuredly, and not with the fish- monger. You must train yourself to resist his blandish- ments—not for you is whitebait at prohibitive prices ; and you must turn a blind eye to the coral beauties of the lobster offered to you as the quintessence of cheap- ness at “ Three shillings, mum.” Believe me, the humble haddock or hake, the fleshy fresh herring, the winningly dainty whiting, with his tail in his mouth, even the plain and homely plaice, is capable of being turned into as dainty a plat as ever graced dinner-table or delighted diner ; yet if treated aright—as I shall presently show—this way lies culinary and marketing wisdom. Fillets of Hake or Haddock a la Tartare.—Trim the fillets of fish neatly, soak them in a little vinegar to which has been added a couple of cloves, a minced shallot, and a little nutmeg and salt, for half an hour. Then take them out of the mixture, dry carefully, and egg and bread-crumb them. Fry in boiling lard or fat.

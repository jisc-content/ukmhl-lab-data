THE STOCK POT 11 that only. Secondly, an ordinary saucepan, being of lighter make, is more liable to burn. Yet one other rule of great moment to the would-be successful cook. The stock-pot must be kept scrupulously clean. When the stock is emptied out after its daily “ boiling up,” the pot must be thoroughly cleansed, and finally rinsed out with clean cold water. If this is not done—and more- over, done carefully—the stock will turn sour, and all your painstaking will have been for nothing. And now to turn to the making of soup. Order from your butcher sixpennyworth of bones—veal and beef mixed. You should get about seven or eight pounds for six- pence, if you give him a standing order to deliver them every week. Break these into pieces, not too small, and take out all the marrow, which you must reserve for marrow toast, or potted marrow for sandwiches, and for which I will give recipes later. Having broken up the bones, put them into your stock-pot, and add enough cold water to well cover them. Bring them gently to boiling point. As soon as they boil add a gill of cold water, and remove all scum as fast as it makes its appearance till no more rises. Then add a bay leaf, twenty peppercorns, a bunch of mixed herbs, half a dozen onions, as nearly of a size as possible, four or five cloves, two or three carrots, salt to suit your own taste (always remembering that it is better to rather under- than over-do the salting of any dish), and a little celery, or celery seed. Bring the stock to the boil again, and then draw the pot to the side of the stove, and let the whole simmer for about five hours ; strain through a hair

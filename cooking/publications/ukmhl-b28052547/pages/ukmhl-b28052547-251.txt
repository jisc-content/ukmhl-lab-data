MENUS AND RECIPES 241 Boeuf a l’Homard.—Cut a steak into neat pieces, about an inch thick ; fry in a saucepan with an ounce of butter till well browned on both sides. Then dredge in a little flour, and add a tablespoonful of Harvey sauce, a teaspoonful of essence of anchovy, a little lemon juice, and pepper and salt to taste. Add the white meat of a small lobster, cut into tiny pieces, simmer gently till done, adding half a glass of sherry just before serving, and garnish with a border of mashed potatoes. Spinach a la Creme.—Pick the spinach carefully, and then wash it in half a dozen waters ; drain upon a sieve, boil it in its own juice, and cook till tender. Pass through a hair sieve, and put it into a saucepan with an ounce of butter, a little pepper, salt, and nutmeg, and a spoonful of sugar. Stir it carefully till quite hot, then add two pennyworth of cream. Make it again very hot, and pile up in the centre of a dish garnished with fried croutons. Poudin de Pain a la Frangaise.—Put eight ounces of bread-crumbs into a basin, with six ounces of sugar, a pinch of salt and the grated rind of a lemon. Add a pint of boiling milk, and soak for fifteen minutes. Then add four yolks and whites of eggs, whisked separately ; beat well together for ten minutes. Fill a buttered mould with this mixture, and steam for two hours. Serve with white sauce, sweetened to taste, and flavoured with vanilla. Savoury Croutons.—Take a sufficient number of soft bloater roes and fry them in a little butter. Season 17

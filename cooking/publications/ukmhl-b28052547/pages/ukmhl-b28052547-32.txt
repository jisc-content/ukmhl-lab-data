22 DINNERS OF THE DAY saucepan with an ounce of dripping and an ounce of butter, a clove of garlic, a shallot, a bouquet of sweet herbs, a bay-leaf, and twenty peppercorns. Fry the bird in the fat till it is a bright brown in hue, turning it frequently, and basting to avoid burn- ing, then pour off the fat, take out the garlic, add a gill of stock, draw the pan to the side of the stove, and simmer gently for an hour and a half. By this time the bird should be quite tender. Serve on a hot dish, remove the herbs, etc., from the sauce, pour off a little of the fat, thicken with flour, boil up and pour over and around the bird, and serve with chipped potatoes, which should have been fried in the fat saved from the weekly stock. The cost of this dish will not exceed 2s. qd.—viz., fowl, 2S. ; herbs, butter, and fat, 4d. And the cost of the next plat is even more trifling. A good- sized cabbage can be bought for 2d., cream will cost another 2d., and butter id. ; total, 5d. Chou a la Creme. — This is a delightful way of serving our homely old friend, the cabbage, and one that is much in vogue abroad. Boil a white-heart cabbage in well-salted water, with an onion stuck with a clove. When done, drain carefully till every drop of water has been extracted, then press through a hair sieve. Place an ounce of butter in a saucepan ; when melted add the cabbage, stirring rapidly ; then add by degrees two pennyworth of cream and a dust of white pepper, make very hot, and serve piled up in the centre of a dish with fried linger croutons.

5i HOW TO TRAIN A COOK Fried potatoes would go well with either dish ; but here, again, great care and discrimination are re- quired, or the greasy, whitey-brown slabs which the ordinary plain cook will persist in misnaming u fried ” potatoes will result. The following is the right method of procedure : Wash, peel, and cut half a dozen large potatoes into slices not quite as thick as a shilling ; wash them again carefully, and dry, till quite free from moisture, upon a clean vegetable cloth. Have ready a clean, dry saucepan ; put into it a pound and a half of clarified fat or lard, place upon the lire, shake it gently occasionally to prevent burning, and when a faint blue smoke arises, throw in a few of the potatoes—say a small handful, not more, or the fat will be chilled and the potatoes spoilt accordingly—shake every now and then, and fry till a bright light brown ; then drain carefully upon clean kitchen paper, and reserve till the rest of the potatoes are cooked ; sprinkle a little salt over them and serve. The raw cook should next try her ’prentice hand at a vegetable course. Nothing better and simpler could be found than chon ci la creme (p. 22), or celery dressed after the same fashion. And for a sweet it will be better just at first to coniine her maiden efforts to a steamed pudding or a mixed fruit salad ; and when conlidence shall have become hers (and yours), let her essay a compote if orange, or creme caramel, or aught that a soaring fancy may dictate. But, at the first, when training your raw material, always bear in mind that truest of all proverbs, “ Discretion is the better part of valour.”

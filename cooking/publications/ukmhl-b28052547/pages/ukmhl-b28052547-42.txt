32 DINNERS OF THE DAY joram. Draw the pan to the side of the stove and simmer gently till the lish is cooked. If you desire to use the piece of lish for a separate plat it must now be removed ; if not, it can be left in the stock-pot, and the whole allowed to continue simmering for another thirty to forty minutes. The soup can now be linished in either of the following fashions : For a puree de poisson lift out a pound or so of lish and pass it through a hair sieve, strain the broth from the bones, etc., into a clean saucepan, and add to it the sieved lish, an ounce or more of butter, and, if possible, half a gill of cream. This latter is not necessary, but is an improvement. Then stir gently over a slack lire for ten minutes till very hot, but do not allow it to actually boil. Pass through a hot strainer, in order that the soup may be properly mixed and of the right cream-like consistency, and serve with tiny squares of buttered toast. If the puree is not sufficiently thick it may be made so by the addi- tion of a tablespoonful of potato Hour. Pepper and salt must, of course, be added to suit individual tastes. Second method : Where it is desired to use the piece of hsh for a course it must be taken out as above directed, and the broth, onions, etc., be allowed to simmer gently for another half-hour or more. Then strain through a hair sieve and return to the saucepan, stirring in bit by bit two ounces of butter, add a little nutmeg, pepper and salt, four ounces of parboiled rice, and two- pennyworth of picked shrimps ; boil gently till the rice is sufficiently cooked, then add a squeeze of lemon juice and a little cayenne, and serve immediately.

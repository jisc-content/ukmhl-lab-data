7 DINNERS OF THE DAY as follows : Plunge the empty crust—its shape kept quite intact—into boiling lard, and let generosity reign ; have a saucepan full of it. It can be used over and over again, always taking care that it does not burn. Fry on till your croustade assumes a deep, golden- brown colour. Then lift it out with care, and drain upon ordinary kitchen paper. Do you wish to have a hastily-prepared sweet ?

Heat them in a sauce, for which this is the recipe : Fry an ounce of flour and an ounce of butter in a stew-pan till they assume a bright brown hue. Next add a gill of stock (made from the bones of the chicken), two shallots, a bay leaf, a liberal scraping of horseradish, a little lean ham, a tablespoonful each of red currant jelly and Harvey sauce, pepper and salt to taste, and half a pint of brown roux—i.e.t flour and butter browned in a stew-pan—

200 DINNERS OF THE DAY half a pint of Bretonne sauce ; simmer over the fire for ten minutes, tossing frequently to avoid burning, and serve garnished with fried croutons. Bretonne sauce is made as follows : Chop two large onions very finely, and fry them in a stewpan with an ounce of butter till of a bright brown colour ; add an ounce of flour kneaded with an ounce of butter, half a pint of very strong stock, a tablespoonful of China soy, plenty of pepper and salt to taste. Stir over the lire for ten minutes, strain through a gravy-strainer, and use as directed above. Porcupine des Pommes.—Prepare some apple mar- malade, using for the purpose some eighteen or twenty apples. Put this into an oval case of pie-crust which has been previously baked. Make a hole in the centre of the apple marmalade and fill this up with some rich thick custard, which must have been made with cream instead of milk. Whip the whites of six eggs till they form a firm froth, flavour with vanilla, and sweeten with sifted sugar. Spread this carefully over the apples, giving it as much as possible the shape of a hedgehog. Blanch six ounces of sweet almonds, cut them into long fine strips, and stick them into the meringue in close rows to imitate the bristles. The head and feet can be cut out of strips of angelica, using currants for the eyes. Bake in a slow oven till of a delicate fawn colour, and serve immediately, garnished plentifully with red currant jelly. Whipped cream can be handed separately if liked, and should be sweetened and flavoured with either vanilla or lemon essence—as may be liked best. Game Toast.—Take the remains of any cold game,

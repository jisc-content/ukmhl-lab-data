THE STORE CUPBOARD 61 and into this we will put the rice and flakes of chicken, and stir them gently till thoroughly mixed ; then we will fill a requisite number of little paper cases with the mixture, and with a generous hand sprinkle fried bread- crumbs upon the top of each. Ten minutes before they are needed we propose to put them into a very hot oven for that space of time, and then to serve them with all possible expedition. In a former chapter a delicious recipe for a rechaufee of mutton was given ; we will cook ours after that fashion, and serve with it plenty of boiled potatoes, which have been sauteed in butter for a few minutes before serving. For the next course we have no fresh vegetables ; we will again have recourse to our invaluable little cup- board. What do we see ? Oh, that half-pint bottle of fonds d’artichauts—the very thing, again. We will drain them carefully, make them very hot in a gill of well-flavoured stock, drain again—this time upon a hair sieve—and serve with a sauce an frontage. Now what are we going to do for a sweet ? I know, “ Russian pudding,” a positive inspiration. No difficulty about that either. The cupboard always contains a large tin of golden syrup. Last time the pudding didn’t “ hold ” very well together, so this time we will add an extra half-ounce or more of bread-crumbs. Vanilla sauce must accompany it, else would it seem somewhat dry. Now for a savoury. Anchovy toast ; we will serve it “ piping hot ” and with finely-chopped capers and olives scattered liberally on top. So that difficulty is disposed of. We are never without fruit in the house,

175 CHAPTER XXIV TWO LOYAL MENUS Englishmen and Englishwomen all the world over are nothing if not loyal, and at the thought of their beloved Queen and country the mind not unnaturally turns to thoughts of feast and feasting. I now append two menus with recipes, one suitable for a special dinner and one for a popular dinner. Several of the special dinner recipes are those of the celebrated Francatelli, who once had the honour of serving her most gracious Majesty as “ chef de cuisine ” in those long-ago days of the forties. Hence the language is a little quaint. It will be noticed that I have given a choice of two soups for the special dinner. My reason for doing so is that the “ Puree de petits pois ” may be thought somewhat similar to the entree of fowl which follows it further on in the menu.

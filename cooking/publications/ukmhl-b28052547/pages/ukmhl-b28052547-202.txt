ICJ2 DINNERS OF THE DAY I know of is bread pudding a la Frangaise. This, if prepared as follows, will be found an immense improve- ment on the well-known entremet of that name. Take some slices of bread—whether fresh or stale is im- material, but in the latter case they will naturally require longer soaking—place them in a basin, and pour over them half a pint or more, according to the amount of bread used, of boiling milk. If the bread is new, beat up at once with a fork ; if not, cover the basin and let it stand for half an hour. At the end of that time add a small pinch of salt, and beat vigorously until all the milk is absorbed. Add enough sugar to sweeten, and sufficient white sauce to form into a light batter ; leave till cold ; then add half an ounce of finely shredded candied peel, some essence of vanilla or a little pow- dered cinnamon, whichever is best liked, the well-beaten yolks of two eggs, and, last of all, the whites, whisked separately to a stiff froth. Mix thoroughly, pour into a well-greased mould, and steam for two hours. Turn out carefully, and serve with jam sauce, which is made as follows : Place three or four ounces of any sort of jam—for preference use strawberry or apricot—in a clean enamelled stew-pan ; add a dessertspoonful of water, and bring to the boil ; then strain through a heated gravy-strainer on to the pudding. If liked, golden syrup made hot in the same way may be used in place of the jam. Note that in this case it is unneces- sary to strain it, and that it need not be diluted. Variety can be introduced into the above pudding by adding a little chopped glace fruit or some stoned and chopped

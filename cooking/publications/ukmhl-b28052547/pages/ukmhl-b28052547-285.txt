MENUS AND RECIPES 27 5 Filet de Boeuf a PAllemande.—Lard a lean fillet of beef, and fry it in two ounces of beef dripping or butter till of a light brown colour, then place round it a mixture of finely-chopped carrots, turnips, beet- root, onions, and, if obtainable, celery. Season highly with pepper and salt, and moisten with a pint of strong stock. Place the lid of the saucepan on tightly and braise gently for about two hours and a half, basting frequently. When sufficiently cooked lift out the beef, and glaze it quickly in a hot oven, garnish- ing it round with the mixed vegetables. Skim the liquor it was braised in, and thicken it with a little Hour, previously kneaded with butter ; strain through a sieve into a clean stew-pan, add to it a glassful of mushroom catsup, a pinch of sifted sugar, and a few filleted and boned anchovies. Boil up again, pour over and around the fillet of beef, and serve with plainly-boiled potatoes. Macedoine of Mixed Fruits.—Take a sufficient quantity of mixed raw fruits, as, for instance, grapes, bananas, strawberries, cherries, oranges, if obtainable, and a couple of apples. Peel and slice the apples, bananas, and oranges, stone the cherries, and pick and divide the strawberries. Place together in a deep fancy bowl, and sprinkle over them about two ounces of sifted sugar ; add a wineglassful of cooking brandy and a tablespoonful of any kind of syrup preferred, set in a cool place till needed, and serve with or without whipped cream, handed separately.

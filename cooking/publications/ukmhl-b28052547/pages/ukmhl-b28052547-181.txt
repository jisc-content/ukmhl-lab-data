A DINNER WITHOUT MEAT I7I Milk Soup.—If this is liked as a puree, refer to the directions given in a former chapter for making milk soup for children. If preferred clear, proceed as follows : Simmer three pints of milk with a couple of onions stuck with cloves, a blade of mace, a bay-leaf, and a few peppercorns ; do not allow it to become reduced. After it has stewed for about thirty-live minutes, by which time the onions should be quite soft, remove the herbs, etc., add salt to taste and half a pint of boiling cream, strain through a heated gravy- strainer into a soup tureen, and serve immediately, with fried croutons handed separately. This soup is splendid for delicate children and adults, as it is most nourishing and not at all sickly.

When it is thoroughly cooked, place it in the oven for ten or twelve minutes, and glaze it brightly. Serve with the following sauce poured around it, and with some handed separately in a sauceboat. Sauce Chevreuil : Chop four ounces of lean raw ham or bacon, and put it into a clean enamelled iron stew-pan with a bay-leaf, a pinch of mixed herbs, twenty peppercorns, and a good handful of parsley. Pour over the whole a gill of shallot vinegar, add salt to taste, and simmer over a slow fire till reduced to about half ; add a gill and a half of rich brown sauce and half a tumblerful of port. Stir briskly till quite boiling; then add a large spoonful of rich chicken stock, sieve, and return to a clean stew-pan ; add the juice of a large orange and a dessertspoonful of red currant jelly. Make very hot, and use as above directed. Plainly-boiled French beans and potatoes should accompany this dish. Peas a la Frangaise.—When fresh green peas are unobtainable, equally good results with this entree can be produced by using bottled peas. A pint bottle will be needed for a single dish for four or five people. Roast Guinea-fowl, Salade.—Roast these as directed for pigeons, taking care to baste frequently. POPULAR DINNER RECIPES.

DINNERS OF THE DAY 128 wherein fruit plays a prominent part—why, there is absolutely no end to them. To begin with there is our homely old friend stewed fruit, which, did it but have its due, should by rights find a place on every breakfast-table in the United Kingdom, and that too on every morning in the year. Then there is macedoine of fruit, which, if properly made, is an entremet so delicious as to entitle it to figure unashamed upon even the swellest of “ special dinner menus.” Fruit-cream custard is another delight- ful and not at all difficult dish to achieve. It is made thus : Take half a pint of cream, double for preference, and have ready sufficient stewed fruit to render half a pint of syrup. Mix the cream and syrup together thoroughly ; put the fruit through a sieve, and reserve it. Next make a custard with the cream in the usual manner, allowing two eggs to the pint. This must be made in a double saucepan in order to prevent the cream from burning. When made, stir in the sieved fruit, beat up the whites of three eggs to a stiff froth and pour on top ; then place in a slow oven till of a light fawn colour, and serve. This sweet can be eaten either hot or cold. Another nice and very pretty dish is made as follows : Boil a pound of lump sugar with a very little water until it reaches the “snap” degree. Have ready a plateful of mixed fruit ; if oranges or apples are used they must be carefully peeled, and the cores and pips duly removed. Dip each piece into the liquid sugar, and arrange on a very large dish in such a way that the pieces do not touch.

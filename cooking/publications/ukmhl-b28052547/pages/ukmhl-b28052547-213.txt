The objec- tion may perhaps be raised that not every middle-class household possesses that somewhat costly article a braising-pan ; or the charcoal embers for its lid. But this difficulty is soon overcome. It is quite easy to braise either poultry or meat in an ordinary stew-pan, if care is taken that the contents thereof are never allowed to get beyond the simmering stage. Braising is the art of cooking slowly. The pan containing the fowl, or whatever has to be braised, can be placed either in the oven or at the side of the stove. But the oven must be a “ slow” one ; and if the pan is to be placed on the side of the stove, then the fire must be of the order known as “ slack.” Also, the contents of the saucepan must never be allowed to get as hot as the “bubbling” stage, and the lid must, in all cases, be put on tightly. Follow these directions carefully, O amateur cook, and all will be well with your braising, and no man — or woman either, for that matter—shall guess aught but that you have braised bravely in the regulation pan and with live embers upon the lid.

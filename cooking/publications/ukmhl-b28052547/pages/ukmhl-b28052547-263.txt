MENUS AND RECIPES made with strong stock instead of water ; pour this over the mushrooms, and scatter equal parts of bread- crumbs, grated lean ham, and Parmesan cheese on top. Bake in a quick oven for fifteen minutes, dust with red pepper, and serve very hot. Compotes of Oranges.—Peel the rind from half a dozen oranges as thinly as possible, divide into halves and remove all the white pith ; boil eight ounces of sugar with half a pint of water for five minutes, then put in the oranges very gently, and boil for another five minutes ; remove the oranges to a compote dish, add a glass of liqueur (cura^oa for preference), strain over the fruit and serve. This compote is delicious either hot or cold. In either case it can be served with the addi- tion of whipped cream, sweetened, and flavoured with vanilla or orange-flower water. (Eufs a l’Allemande (original).—Boil three eggs till quite hard, then shell them, cut them exactly in halves, and take out the yolks ; dip the halved whites in egg and bread-crumb, and fry them lightly in boiling lard till of a light fawn colour. In the meantime get ready the following mixture : Chop finely a piece of smoked salmon roe, two anchovies, a boned sardine, and the yolks from the eggs ; fry these in half a table- spoonful of chili vinegar and boil up again. Fill the halves of egg with this mixture and scatter hot fried bread-crumbs on the top ; give a liberal sprinkling of cayenne pepper to each ; place in a hot oven for a minute, and serve immediately.

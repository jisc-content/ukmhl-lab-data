243 MENUS SIND RECIPES need less medicine, and effect, besides, no inconsiderable saving in the butcher’s bill. I shall hope later on to devote one or two special articles to this branch—that is, vegetable cookery. I hold that no cook should be considered efficiently trained who cannot send up a dinner consisting entirely of vegetables, each plat different to the one which has preceded it, and all cooked to such a degree of nicety that the absence of meat will not even be noticed, much less commented upon. But in this respect, as in many others, I know, alas, only too well, how very far behind her foreign compeers is the English so-called cook of to-day. Let her mistress take heart of grace, however, for, guided by the recipes given in this chapter even an ignorant cook should be able to turn out a puree of more than ordinary goodness : and with a cook who can send to table a decent puree, there is hope of better things, even, maybe, a chance for the poor despised vegetable.

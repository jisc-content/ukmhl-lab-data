36 DINNERS OF THE DAY salmon now so much in vogue is, however, not well adapted for a souchet. Take the skin, bones, and trimmings which will be left after having filleted two and a half or three pounds of salmon. Put the fillets themselves on one side till needed. Place the trimmings in a stewpan with two sliced carrots, a head of celery, or a teaspoonful of celery salt, a blade of mace, a bouquet garni, a sprig of parsley, and two small shallots. Add two large glasses of Chablis, pepper and salt to taste, and a quart of weak stock or water. Simmer gently for three-quarters of an hour, then strain off carefully through a soup serviette. Place the fillets of salmon in a stewpan with an ounce of butter, and fry till of a very delicate fawn colour. Then add the broth and about a pennyworth of well-washed and dried parsley. Let all boil together till the fillets of salmon are thoroughly cooked. Add the juice of half a lemon and a little cayenne pepper. Arrange the fillets neatly at the bottom of a soup tureen, pour over the souchet, and serve immediately. This is an uncommon dish, and one rarely met with on an English table. Brown bread and butter should be handed separately, and the usual plat of fish omitted, or care taken to provide a fish as different in flavour and preparation as possible.

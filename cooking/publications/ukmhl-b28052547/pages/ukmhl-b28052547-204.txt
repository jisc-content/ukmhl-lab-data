Mix lightly, use to fill a well-greased mould, steam for two hours, turn out carefully, and serve with apricot sauce.

In all other respects proceed exactly as directed above. Banana Pudding is a delightful sweet. It is made as follows : Take eight or ten large bananas, selecting only such as are thoroughly ripe. Peel and pass them through a wire sieve. Have ready half a pint of rich white sauce ; sweeten this to taste, and add it to the bananas ; leave till cold ; then add the well-beaten yolks of four eggs, a glass of curapoa, and lastly the whites of the eggs, previously whipped to a firm froth. Grease a clean mould with a little fresh butter, and having whisked the pudding lightly, fill the mould, tie down tightly with buttered paper, and steam for two hours. Note : this pudding requires great care in turning out. It should be served with almond sauce, which is made as follows : Take an ounce of sweet almonds, and having blanched them in the usual way, pound them in a mortar with a tablespoonful of orange-flower water until they are of the consistency of thick paste. Place the paste in a stew-pan with four ounces of sifted sugar and a tablespoonful of brandy ; mix thoroughly ; then add the well-beaten yolks of two eggs and a gill of double cream. Place the stew-pan on a very slack fire, and whisk vigorously till the sauce becomes frothy.

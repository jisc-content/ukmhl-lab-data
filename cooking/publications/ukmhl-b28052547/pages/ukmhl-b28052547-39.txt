“ECONOMICAL MEALS" 29 Fried Fresh Herrings, with brown caper sauce.— Having cleaned and drawn the herrings (the soft roes must be reserved for a savoury) wipe them very dry ; then dip in milk and roll in dry flour, and fry them carefully in hot lard. Serve with fried parsley and brown caper sauce. Put an ounce of butter in a stew-pan with half an ounce of flour, a little salt, pepper, and nutmeg ; work these well together with a wooden spoon, and then add a gill of strong stock, a few drops each of essence of anchovy, Worcester sauce, Harvey sauce, and a table- spoonful and a half of very finely-chopped capers ; stir carefully over the fire for ten minutes ; when quite boiling, pass through a wide strainer and serve with cayenne pepper, handed separately. Boiled Mackerel a la Poulette.—Boil the mackerel with a little parsley, nutmeg, and a shallot, and a plenti- ful sprinkling of pepper, a bay-leaf, and a couple of cloves. When done serve with sauce poulette. Put a gill of good white sauce into a clean saucepan, add twopennyworth of cream, a little, very little spice, pepper and salt to taste, the yolks of two eggs, and a teaspoonful of chopped parsley ; stir carefully over the fire for ten minutes, but do not allow the sauce to boil. It must get very hot without actually boiling, then add a teaspoonful of finely-chopped mushrooms, and serve poured over the mackerel. N.B.—Almost any white fish can be cooked as above, and the flavour will be found much superior to fish boiled in the ordinary way.

A DINNER WITHOUT MEAT 173 and place in a very hot oven for ten minutes ; serve immediately. When frying mushrooms, for safetyâ€™s sake, place a bit of silver in the pan in which they are being cooked. If the silver shows the least discolora- tion, the mushrooms are unfit for food, and should be thrown away immediately ; the pan should be scoured out with the greatest possible care, and finally rinsed in, first, boiling water and soda, and then cold water for at least half a dozen times. A small silver teaspoon can be placed in the frying-pan when cooking ; failing that, a silver sixpence or a shilling may be used, but these should first be carefully cleansed. The above is said to be an absolutely infallible test as to the pre- sence of bad fungi amongst mushrooms, and this pre- caution, no matter where they have been purchased, should never be omitted. Here, too, is a very good luncheon dish for days when meat is not acceptable. Peel and slice thinly eight or ten large onions ; place an ounce of butter in an enamelled frying-pan, and as soon as it oils add the sliced onions, and fry till of a light brown colour ; drain and place in a large pie-dish ; have ready about a dozen hard-boiled eggs, and a like quantity of forcemeat balls, made as above directed ; add the onions, press a dozen ripe tomatoes through a fine wire sieve, season the pulp with pepper and salt to suit your own taste, add two tablespoonfuls of oiled butter, mix thoroughly, and pour over the eggs, etc. Cover the whole with light puff-paste, glaze the top, and bake in a very quick oven till of a light brown hue. Serve with plainly-boiled

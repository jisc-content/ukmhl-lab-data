Keep stirring till the endives have absorbed all the butter, then add a gill of either rich brown gravy or cream, whichever is best liked, make very hot, and serve piled high in the centre of a dish, and garnished with fried croutons. Souffle de Yolaille a la Royale.—Take half a pint of chicken puree, made after the same manner as the puree of rabbit, described at the commencement of this chapter ; or, if liked, puree of rabbit can be used, and another soup substituted in its stead. Add to the half- pint of puree the yolks of five eggs, a teaspoonful of essence of anchovy, and the whites of six eggs whisked separately, flavoured with spice, and salted to taste. Fill a buttered mould with the mixture, tie it tightly down with greased paper, and steam for an hour and a half. Do not fill the mould more than three- parts full. Serve with a rich gravy and any salad best liked. Fanchonettes.—Prepare half a pint of mixed rich custard made with cream and apricot jam ; flavour with curafoa.

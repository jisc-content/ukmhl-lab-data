Especially is this the case with the recipes for vege- table entrees, such as “ Haricots vert a la Franyaise,” u Chou a la Creme,” “ Celery a la Creme,” Braised Cabbage, “ Carrots a PAllemande,” and a host of others. If you do not care for milk soup pure and simple, try “ Creme de Riz,” and use water instead of stock ; only in this case you must add seasoning to suit your own palate.

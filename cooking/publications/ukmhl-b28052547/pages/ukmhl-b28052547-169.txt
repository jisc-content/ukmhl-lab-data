Keep stirring till the mixture becomes a soft paste and leaves the sides of the stew-pan, then remove the pan from the lire, and stir in the well-beaten yolks of three eggs and about four ounces of Parmesan cheese. Finally add a^gill of cream and the whites of the eggs whisked to a stiff froth ; stir over the fire for two or three minutes, and mould into quenelles with two dessert-spoons. Have ready a pint of boiling consomme, slip the noukles gently into this, and poach for ten minutes over a clear fire, drain upon a sieve, and place neatly in a white china souffle-dish. Pour over them a gill of very rich white roux, scatter some grated cheese and bread-crumbs on top, and set in a brisk oven for fifteen minutes. Serve as quickly as possible.

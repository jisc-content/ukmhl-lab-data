POPULAR DINNER RECIPES. Cream Soup.—This is by no means such an expensive dish as its name would seem to imply. To make it, proceed thus: Take a large coffeecupful of finely- chopped parboiled potato, and about a teacupful of minced onion. Add a turnip thinly sliced, and a tea- spoonful of new bread-crumbs. Mix all these ingredients thoroughly, add a teaspoonful of white pepper, and salt to suit your own taste, and place all in a large enamelled iron saucepan with a quart of water. Simmer gently till quite soft, then add an ounce of Carolina rice, which has been previously cooked in a little milk, sieve, return to a clean saucepan, and add by degrees a quart of hot milk, and, bit by bit, about an ounce of butter. Stir gently over a slow fire till quite boiling ; then serve immediately, with grated Parmesan cheese handed separately.

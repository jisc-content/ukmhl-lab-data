DAINTY DINNER-TABLES ior your table-centre be a strip of silk or velvet of just the shade of the glasses. The effect will be a lasting joy. You can buy a big dark blue Wedgwood or Japanese bowl for two shillings. Get one, and fill it with yellow marguerites, and place it on a square of Gobelin blue velvet; hll your sweetie dishes with abricotines, and you will feel that you would rather do without half a dozen new gowns than go without flowers on your dinner-table again. If you own one of those dearly quaint-shaped Belgian vases, in what, for want of its proper name, I will call Liberty green, fill it with white lilies and lilies of the valley, mixed with their lovely sheath-like leaves, when you want to be widely ex- travagant and place it on a centre of golden-brown velvet ; naught of disappointment will assail you when you view it, that I promise. Now for some hints as to these same-table centres. They are not at all expensive, if you go the right way to work. At all the “art” shops “ cushion squares” in silk and velvet of lovely colourings are sold from is. iid. each, and these, the edges slip-stitched with due care, make delightful centres. But if your purse be of unusually narrow girth, content yourself with muslin of the various shades I have described. These are all obtainable at 2fd. a yard, and, carefully and daintily “ rucked ” into place, the effect will be almost, if not quite, as good as in the more costly material. If 3^011 would know what.

DINNERS OF THE DAY 282 gently for an hour ; drain upon a sieve, remove the bacon, bay-leaf, and parsley from the broth they were cooked in, skim it free from grease, add to it a wine- glassful of sherry and a quarter of a pound of finely- chopped tongue, make very hot, reduce to about half a pint, pour over the cabbages, which must have been piled up as high as possible in the centre of the dish, and serve garnished with fried croutons. Cabbage cooked in this way, and with the wine omitted from the sauce, makes a good nursery dinner, with the addi- tion of plenty of boiled potatoes, handed, of course, separately.

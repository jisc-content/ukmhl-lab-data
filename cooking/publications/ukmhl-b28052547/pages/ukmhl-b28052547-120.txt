DINNERS OF THE DAY i ro Simmer slowly for about two hours and a half, taking off the scum as it rises; then place in the larder, and when cold remove all the fat, add an ounce of par- boiled rice or barley, and simmer till cooked. Serve with some crusts of bread added lastly. Cream of Hake.—Take eight ounces of hake, free it from skin and bone, and pound in a mortar till it becomes a stiff paste. Then rub it through a hair sieve, add an ounce of bread-crumbs, a pinch of nutmeg, pepper and salt to taste, the yolks and whites of two eggs whisked separately, a gill of milk, half that amount of white sauce, and a few drops of lemon juice. Fill a buttered mould with this mixture, steam for two hours, turn out, pour some white sauce over, and serve. Ragout of Mutton.—Take the remains of a shoulder of mutton, trim off the fat, and cut the meat into long, thin strips. Fry an ounce each of flour, finely chopped shallot, and butter, in a stew-pan, till of a bright brown colour, then add a glass each of Harvey sauce and stock, a little grated nutmeg and lemon-peel, pepper and salt to taste ; add the strips of mutton, make very hot, and serve garnished with a border of mashed potatoes. Stuffed Eggs.—Boil four eggs till hard. Shell and halve them, and take out the yolks. Pound these in a mortar with half an ounce of butter, a little pepper and salt, and a large tablespoonful of potted chicken. Use this mixture to fill the whites. Have ready a gill of white sauce which has had two ounces of grated Dutch cheese melted in it. Place the eggs gently in this ; make very hot, and serve with fried crusts.

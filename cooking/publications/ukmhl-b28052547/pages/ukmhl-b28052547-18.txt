DINNERS OR THE DAY 8 with water added, and a small glassful of either port or sherry. Stir these ingredients over a slow tire for fifteen minutes, strain through a hair sieve, and when the chicken has been made thoroughly hot in this sauce, till the croustade with the mixture, pouring over it the remainder of the sauce, place in a hot oven for ten minutes, and, hey presto 1 you have “ Croustade Napoli- taine.” Then as to that pound or two of Brussels- sprouts, served as an accompaniment to the chicken when it made its first appearance as a roast. Nobody ate them, but treated as herein described, and turned into u Puree de choux de Bruxelles,” they will not be recognised, and are likely to be devoured with avidity. Simmer a quart or rather more of water with three large onions stuck with cloves, a bunch of mixed herbs, and twenty peppercorns, salt to taste. When the onions are thoroughly cooked add the cold sprouts, boil for five minutes, then strain through a hair sieve, and return to the saucepan, adding an ounce of butter and the yolks of two eggs. Stir carefully for ten minutes, taking care that the eggs do not curdle, serve with crusts of fried bread, stamped out before frying with a vege- table cutter. Finally, I again maintain that, with proper care taken, the French system of management in your kitchens will mean a decrease, and not an increase, of that bugbear of all housekeepers the butcher’s bill.

MACARONI AND HOW TO COOK IT 61 potatoes into slices about half an inch thick and put them into a stew-pan with two ounces of butter, two penny- worth of cream, and the juice of half a lemon ; season with pepper and salt and a very small pinch of mace ; make very hot, tossing continually to avoid burning, and serve with fleurons of pastry. Cocoanut Pudding.—Mix four ounces of desiccated cocoanut with three ounces of bread-crumbs, the juice of half a lemon, the yolks of three eggs, half a pint of milk, and three ounces of sifted sugar ; mix thoroughly, then stir in the whites of four eggs whisked to a stiff froth. Use this mixture to fill a buttered mould, steam for two hours, and serve with a sweet sauce, flavoured with lemon juice. Caviar Crusts.—Spread some cold croutons with a thin layer of caviar, dust liberally with red pepper, place in a hot oven for five or six minutes, and serve immediately. Anchovy may be used in place of caviar where the latter is not liked or is considered too expensive a luxury for a family dinner.

86 CONVALESCENT COOKERY. RABBITS. To choose a rabbit for boiling, see that it has smooth and sharp claws, in which case it is young. If the claws are blunt and ragged, and the ears dry and tough, you may be sure the animal is oldâ€”too old for cooking for an invalid. As Gouffe said of the fowls, you will never do any good with an old rabbit. After it has been emptied and shinned, the rabbit ought to be very well washed. If there still seems any remains of blood lingering about it, leave it to soak in water for a quarter of an hour. This is necessary, whether it is intended to be roasted or stewed, or boiled or baked. From half-an-hour to three-quarters is enough for cooking a rabbit in almost any way. Like the leg of mutton (page 76), authori- ties differ as to the boiling of a rabbit. Mrs. Beeton would put it into hot water.

CONVALESCENT COOKERY. 15 hours ; the patient's stomach rejects it. If so, try a tablespoonful every hour; if this will not do, a teaspoonful eveiw quarter of an hour. If we did but know the consequences which may ensue in very weak patients from ten minutes' fasting or repletion (I call it repletion when they are obliged to leave too small an interval between taking food and some other exertion, owing to the nurse's unpunctuality), we should be more careful never to let this occur. In very weak patients there is often a nervous difficulty of swallowing, which is so much increased by any other call upon their strength that, unless they have their food punctually at the minute, which minute again must be arranged so as to fall in with no other minute's occupation, they can take nothing till the next respite occurs ; so that unpunctuality, or a delay of ten minutes, may very well turn out to be one of two or three hours. And why is it not as easy to be punctual to a minute ? Life often hangs upon these minutes.

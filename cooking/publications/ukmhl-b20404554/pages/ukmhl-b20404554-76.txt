56 CONVALESCENT COOKERY. Warm up for the patient about half-a-pint of the broth, adding a little bit of butter about as large as a nut, a small lump of sugar, and a very small quantity of grated nutmeg. Take it off the fire, add the yolk of an egg which has pre- viously been well beaten, stir the mixture over the fire until it thickens, but do not allow it to boil again after the egg is added, or it will curdle, and the broth will be spoiled. CHICKEN BROTH. Take half a fowl, or the inferior joints of a whole one; make up a bunch of sweet herbs in a faggot; add a blade of mace, half an onion, salt to taste, ten peppercorns. Put the fowl into a saucepan with all the ingredients and a quart of water; simmer gently for an hour and a half, carefully skimming the broth well. When done, strain, and put by in a cool place until wanted ; then take all the fat off the top, warm up as much as may be required, and serve with a little toast.

APPENDIX. { In the treatment of disease/ says Dr. Kirby, late physician to the London City Dispensary, ' the regula- tion of diet always demands particular attention; it may be made a powerful agent in the restoration of health, while negligence or errors are often exceedingly disastrous. The writer has seen cases lost which, humanly speaking, might have been saved had the nutrition of the patient been properly regarded; in other words, if he had had food in the proportion that his malady had medicine.' DIET TABLES AT PRINCIPAL LONDON HOSPITALS. Each London Hospital has regular dietaries adapted to every stage of illness, but the details may be varied by the physicians. At the London Fever Hospital there are three scales—low, middle, and full. The first consists of bread, milk, gruel with sugar j or it may be beef-tea diet—beef tea, milk, and bread. L 2

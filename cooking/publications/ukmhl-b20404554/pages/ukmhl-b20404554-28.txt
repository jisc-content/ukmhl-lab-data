8 CONVALESCENT COOKERY. morsel of food swallowed is counted as so much strength, and every little accession of strength is another day or hour of life; so, how important is it that eveiy woman should know before the need arises how to cook for sick people, and not find it out for herself when the experience comes too late to be of any use in prolonging the one life that was all the world to herâ€”a thousand times dearer to her, perhaps, than her own. There is one great difference between pro- viding food for one who grows better every day and for one who is growing worse. For the convalescent returning health gives renewed strength and a better appetite, but with the fading invalid, every day's experience is a new difficulty; the palate is more fastidious, the appetite more capricious, and the powers of digestion have grown weaker. Then, indeed, will the abilities of the cook be tested to the utmost; she will find that all, and more than all, the skill she possesses is required.

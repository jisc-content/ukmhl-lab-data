42 CONVALESCENT COOKERY. the shoulder, known as gravy beef, are also very generally employed. Meat for beef tea must be perfectly fresh. Have a good but slow fireâ€”good enough not to require to be replenished for an hour or two, but not so strong as to hurry the boiling. Cover the pot closely. As it comes to the boil remove all the scum which comes to the top; do not allow the fat to boil through, but shim it off. When meat comes to the boil, it should be drawn to the side, and allowed to simmer very slowly. If vegetables are to be added to the soup, they should not remain in the pot a minute longer than necessary to be well cooked, as they will otherwise absorb some of the flavour of the broth ; a fact easily proved by tasting them when they have thus been allowed to linger in the broth after their proper cooking. It will then be found that they have taken mush of the richness of the broth, to the great loss of the broth itself.

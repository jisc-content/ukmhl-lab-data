By the time you have prepared something else for him to eat, his appetite is gone, actually because he has not strength enough left for swallowing. The next point to be insisted upon in a cook is punctuality, and with it may be joined order and method. To have the food prepared at a certain hour, it is absolutely essential that the cook shall have everything she may require in the house beforehand, everything she is in the habit of using kept in its right place, and every branch of preparation carried out in its proper order.

CONY A LESCEKT CO OKEIl T. 98 COW'S-HEEL JELLY. This is a less expensive stock, and the cow's heel can be eaten by some of the healthy members of a family, with mustard and vinegar. The heel is first dressed, then boiled like the calves' feet for six or seven hours, and strained ; this should be done, if possible, the day before the jelly is to be made. To a quart of this stock, after re- moving the fat, add either a quart of home- made wine or a quart of beer, the juice and rind of two lemons, a quarter of a pound of brown sugar, and six eggs well beaten. Finish like calves'-foot jolly. Stout flannel is the best material for a jelly bag : the kind called double-mill, used for iron- ing-blankets, is recommended. The seam must be sewed twice, to ensure its closeness and equal filtration. The shape is that of a fool's cap, running to a point. It is more comfortable for the cook to have the mouth of the bag sewed round a hoop; some people tie it on with strings

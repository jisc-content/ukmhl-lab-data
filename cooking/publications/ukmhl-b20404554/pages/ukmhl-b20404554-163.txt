CONVALESCENT COOKERY. 143 CONCLUSION. It only remains to nrge on cooks the necessity for giving the same care and thought to the manner in which the food is served as has been given to the food itself. Everything should be scrupulously clean as well as faultlessly neat. Cover the tray with a white cloth always, no matter how cheap the material of which it may be. The sight of a black tray, perhaps one which has seen better days, will not improve a sick person's appetite. Never fill a huge tray with a cover dish and one or two large plates, and a great carving- knife and fork. Anything which suggests weight to the patient fatigues. There are nurses who would not only bring up such a tray, but would deposit it on the bed.

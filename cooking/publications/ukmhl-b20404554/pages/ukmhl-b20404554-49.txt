CONVALESCENT COOKERY. 29 Good flour is smooth to the touch, cold, aud when pressed retains the form of the pressure. Good meal has a peculiarly sweet smell. Good grain is plump and firm. Vegetables for sick people ought to be very- fresh, in which case they are crisp, not limp. Fresh fruit has a downy, glossy look upon the skin. Fresh milk everyone can recognise. Many people use the condensed milk for cooking, mixing it with water. The Swiss condensed milk is much preferable to the English. It costs a halfpenny or a penny a tin more than the English, but it is quite worth the difference in price.

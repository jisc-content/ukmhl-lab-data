100 CONVALESCENT COOKERY. Mutton shanks may be broken up and used also in this way, or as foundation for jelly. Miss Nightingale lias no respect for jelly; nevertheless it has been thought advisable to give these receipts for the use of those who differ from her in opinion. She says : 'Jelly is another article of diet in great favour with nurses and friends of the sick ; even if it could be eaten solid, it would not nourish, but it is simply the height of folly to take one-eighth of an ounce of gelatine and make it into a certain bulk by dissolving it in water, and then to give it to the sick, as if the mere bulk represented nourishment. It is now known that jelly does not nourish, that it has a tendency to produce diarrhcea, and to trust to it to repair the waste of a diseased constitution is simply to starve the sick under the disguise of feeding them. If one hundred spoonfuls of jelly were given in the course of the day, you would have given one spoonful of gelatine, which spoonful of gelatine has no nutritive power at all.'

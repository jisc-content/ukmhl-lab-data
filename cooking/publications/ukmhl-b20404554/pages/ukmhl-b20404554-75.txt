CONVALESCENT COOKERY. 55 off, and season with parsley root (a piece about the size of two fingers), a small carrot, an onion or two, a blade of mace, and about two ounces of clean bacon, if the palate of the invalid be strong enough to bear this addition ; boil it an hour and a half at least, till the meat is tender ; then strain it. This recipe is given on the authority of J. H. Walsh, Esq., F.E.C.S., assisted by a committee of ladies; but the advantage of first washing the meat in boiling water is questioned by many authorities equally to be relied upon. CALF'S-FOOT BROTH. Stew two calf's feet in three pints of water, or two pints of water and one of new milk, with a small bit of lemon-peel, very gently, until the liquid is boiled down to a pint and a half, very carefully removing any scum which rises to the surface. Set it by in a basin until quite cold, then take off every particle of fat.

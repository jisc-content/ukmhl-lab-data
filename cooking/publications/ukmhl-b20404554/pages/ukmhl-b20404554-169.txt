The half-convalescent is similar, only the allowance of meat is reduced in quantity. Besides these two dietaries their are pudding diet, ordinary diet, half- ordinary diet, mutton-broth diet, fish diet, and simple diet. The extras include chops, beef tea, broth with neck of mutton, rump steaks, tripe, chicken, oysters, greens, eggs, arrowroot, sago, jellies, porter, wine, and spirits. London Hospital has a tempting dietary under the name of ' fancy.' It varies on each clay of the week, beginning on Sundays with roast mutton and rice pudding; then through the week, fish and batter lidding, rabbit and light pudding, roast mutton and rice pudding, etc. etc.; and for supper a pint of broth. Children have bread and milk daily, meat and potatoes five times a week, rice pudding twice a week. Among the extras here are green vegetables, water-cresses, wine, spirits, and porter. The diet in all the hospitals is the same for men and women, but the quantity of each article is less for the latter than for the former.

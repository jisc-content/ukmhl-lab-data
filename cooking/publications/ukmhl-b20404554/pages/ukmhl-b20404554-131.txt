CONVALESCENT COOKEHY. Ill ICELAND BLANCMANGE. The former recipe, only substituting- milk for water and omitting the white wine. The milk requires some strong flavouring—almonds, lemon, or vanilla—as a marine taste often re- mains in the moss. The muslin through which it is strained must be coarse, or a coarse hair sieve will answer. ICELAND MOSS AND CURKANT JELLY. About four ounces of moss (carrigeen it is sometimes called), washed very clean in luke- warm water. Put it on to Loil slowly in a quart of cold water. When the moss is quite dissolved—about forty-five minutes ought to suffice—strain it on a tablespoonf ul of currant jelly, some sugar, and, if preferred, half a tea- spoonful of cream of tartar. Mix well, and turn into a mould to cool. This is admirable for coughs.

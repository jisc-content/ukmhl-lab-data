Full diet includes bread, meat, potatoes, cocoa, milk, and beer. Extras at medical discretion provide for the last diet beef tea in two degrees of strength, eggs as ordered, arrowroot, custard pudding, tea, sugar, and butter. In the Hospital for Diseases of the Chest there is no diet table which answers to that required for low patients in fever cases. For breakfast, patients have bread, milk, or cocoa ; for dinner, meat, potatoes, and porter ; for supper, bread pudding, rice pudding, gruel, corn-flour, or Scotch broth. The middle diet only differs from the full diet in giving a less weight of meat, and half the quantity of porter. At this hospital there is also a milk diet, and a beef-tea diet. The former allows bread, milk, and rice or bread pudding. The latter provides bread, milk, beef tea, and one egg per day to each patient. Every patient on being admitted to the hospital is placed on beef-tea diet until further orders. At King's College Hospital the full diet breakfast consists of bread and milk. Dinner of meat, bread, potatoes, and porter. Supper of gruel and milk.

Gi CONVALESCENT COOKERY. The chop or cutlet must be nicely trimmed, and any superfluous fat removed, but a little should be left on during cooking, as it prevents the meat becoming too dry. Melt some butter in the pan, and dip the chop in it, so as to cover both sides equally. Lay it on a dish and sprinkle it neatly with the fine bread crumbs, in which a little salt, has been mixed, and, if permitted to the pa- tient, a little white pepper. A raw egg beaten up is daintier than melted butter. Put the cutlet into the pan in which is the remainder of the melted butter, and fry it. The fire for a crumbed cutlet must be slow, and seven minutes on an average will be long enough, dividing the time between the two sides of the cutlet, about four minutes to the first, and three to the second after the cutlet has been turned.

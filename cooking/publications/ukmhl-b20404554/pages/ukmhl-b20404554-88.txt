Before taking roasted meat off the spit it should be ascertained whether it is done or not, as to put the spit through it a second time is ruinous to the meat, allowing the gravy to escape; and meat which has been sent to table underdone cannot be recoohed unless by treat- ing it as if it were cold meat. To ascertain if meat be fully roasted, draw it back from the fire and press the fleshiest part with the finger. If the cooking be perfect the flesh will yield to the finger; if not, there will be a little resistance. For fowls or game, exa- mine the leg; if the flesh yield and is ready to come away from the bone, the cooking is suffi- cient. There are small jets of steam to be seen coming from the meat at the side next the fire when it is nearly done.

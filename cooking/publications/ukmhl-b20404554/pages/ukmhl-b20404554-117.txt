CONVALESCENT COOKERY. 07 ingredients together cold. Set the saucepan on the fire, but do not stir the jelly after it begins to warm. Let it boil ten minutes after it rises to a head, then throw in a teacupful of cold water; let it boil five minutes longer, then take the saucepan off, cover it closely, and let it remain half-an-hour near the fire. Have a flannel bag ready for straining it through; wring it out of hot water quite dry, and fasten it on a stand or the back of a chair, which must be placed near the fire, to prevent the jelly stiffening before it runs through the bag. Place a basin underneath to receive the jelly; then pour it into the bag, and should it not be clear the first time, run it through the baa- again. This stock is the foundation of all jelly. Wine and lemon may be added if they can be had. ir

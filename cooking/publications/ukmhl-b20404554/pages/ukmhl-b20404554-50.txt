30 CONVA LESCENT COOKEIt Y. IN THE KITCHEN. It is much easier to cook nice dainty dishes if a woman have no other occupation to follow, and nothing else to think of but roasting, stewing, and boiling. But it is quite another matter if she be wife, mother, nurse, and cook, all at one and the same time. A sick husband, three or four young child- ren (one perhaps an infant), very small quarters iu which to live, and very little money to pro- vide for the wants of so many people, and her task is no easy one. She will not be able to go out to buy what she wants, as a sick person cannot always be left alone, and it is always more expensive and less satisfactory to have to employ someone else.

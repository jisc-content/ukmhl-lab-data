133 CONVALESCENT COOKERY. CAMOMILE TEA. Put about thirty flowers into a jug, pour a pint of boiling water upon them, cover up the tea, and when it has stood about ten minutes, pour it off from the flowers into another jug ; sweeten with sugar or honey; drink a cupful of it fasting in the morning to strengthen the digestive organs, and restore the liver to healthier action. A teacupful of camomile tea, in which is stirred a large dessert-spoonful of moist sugar and a little grated ginger, is an excellent thing to administer to aged people a couple of hours before their dinner. TOAST WATER. Toast a piece of bread, thoroughly browned to its centre without being burnt; put it into a jug, pour boiling water upon it, cover over, and allow it to stand and steep until it has cooled. The toast water will then be fit to drink.

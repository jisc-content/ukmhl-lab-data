73 COXYALESCEXT COOKERY. BOILING. The most important rule in boiling is, when the water has once boiled, never to allow it to go off the boil until the meat or vegetable be finished. If it be necessary, in consequence of the water boiling away, to add more, it ought to be boiling water, not cold nor tepid, nor even nearly boiling. The next rule is to pay attention, especially in boiling meat, to remove any scum which may rise to the top of the water. Before the water reaches boiling point, after the meat is put in, is the time for this, as, if the scum is allowed to boil with the meat, the taste as well as the look of the meat is affected by it. Never allow anything to boil over; never allow water in which meat is, to boil quickly, as it will harden the meat.

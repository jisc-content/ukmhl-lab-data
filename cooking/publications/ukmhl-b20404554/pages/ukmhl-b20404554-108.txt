88 CONVALESCENT COOKERY. STEWED BABBIT. To stew a rabbit, if done with care, makes a more tempting dish than plain boiling. Cut the rabbit into small joints, and put them into a stewpan. Add (if the appetite of the invalid will permit) two small onions, six cloves, a very small teaspoonful of chopped lemon peel, a bit of butter about as large as a walnut, and a little salt. Pour in sufficient cold water to cover the meat, but no more, and stew very slowty, keeping the lid close. At the end of half-an-hour, blend a tablespoonful of flour and stir it in, and a tablespoonful of ketchup. Boil for three or four minutes and serve. KABBIT FEICASSEE. If any of the boiled rabbit (see No. 1) remain from the previous day, it can be made into a fricassee.

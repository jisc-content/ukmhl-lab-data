CONVALESCENT COOKERY. Â£9 sewed to the flannel, and being thus stretched open, it is easy to pour in the stock. JELLY FOE A CHILD WITH WEAK LIMBS. Buy two pounds of shin beef-bone ; it is no object to have much meat upon it. Chop it up into very small pieces, not larger than a farthing piece. Wash and put these into a saucepan, with a quart of water and a good pinch of salt. Boil very gently for six or eight hours, the object being to extract the lime from the bones ; then strain through a jelly-bag and set aside in a basin. When cool, remove the fat, and if the bone of which it was made was without meat, the jelly will be quite tasteless, but very firm. This may be given to the child, a table- spoonful at a time, once, or if necessary twice, a day. It may be dissolved in warm milk, or a little sugar may be added, to induce the child to take it; or it may be melted and poured over bread for an infant. B 2

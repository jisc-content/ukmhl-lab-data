CONVALESCENT COOKERY. 50 Cut the beef into very small pieces, put it into a stewpan with the butter, clove, onion, and salt; stir the meat round over the fire for a few minutes until it produces a thin gravy, then add the water, and let it simmer gently from half-an-hour to three-quarters, skimming off every particle of fat. When done, strain through a sieve, and put it by in a cool place until required. The same, if wanted quite plain, is done by merely omitting the vege- tables, salt, and clove ; the butter cannot be objectionable, as it is taken out in skimming. One pound of beef ought to make a pint of beef-tea. If the meat be boiled a little more than three-quarters of an hour, it can be taken out, pounded, and spiced, and then potted ; potted meat is an excellent breakfast dish, and makes admirable sandwiches for luncheon. Francatelli, a famous cook, recommends beef- tea to be boiled very fast for half-an-hour, stirring it occasionally, and then taken up and strained through a bit of muslin.

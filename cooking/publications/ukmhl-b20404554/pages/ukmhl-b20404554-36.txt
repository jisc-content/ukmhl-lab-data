16 CONVALESCENT COOKERY. One of the greatest authorities on cooking that we have is Monsieur Jules Gouffe, Her Majesty's head pastrycook. He advises cooks not to lose sight of one great practical principle; namely, that it is always better to be in advance in the preparation of any meal rather than behindhand. It is always easier to proceed slower when one finds oneself ready too soon, but when you are compelled to hurry things for want of time, there is every probability of doing badly, and it is rare that some part of the cook- ing should not suffer.

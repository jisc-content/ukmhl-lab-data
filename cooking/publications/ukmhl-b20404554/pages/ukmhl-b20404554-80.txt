60 CONVALESCENT COOKERY. If a cook cannot manage to broil meat well, she ought to fry it, wliicb. is less likely to be a failure; but broiling is more highly recom- mended for weak digestions. First, the care of the cook ought to be the fire. The French cooks use charcoal, but in this country cinders are the substitute. The fire must be prepared at least a quarter of an hour before it is required; a layer of cinders about an inch and a half thick, spread over the hot coals, and left to burn clear. If not per- fectly clear at the last moment, a little salt thrown on the fire makes it burn more clearly and frees it from smoke. The ordinary gridiron is merely a square frame of iron, with cross-bars of the same. An improved kind is used for steak and chop broiling, with the upper surface concave or grooved, and all terminating in a hollow in the handle, so as to save a little of that rich gravy which would otherwise fall into the fire.

82 CONVALESCENT COOKERY. Cod may be cut into slices and broiled. It may be crumbed also, and fried like a cutlet. Flounders may be fried and crumbed like cutlets, but the crumbing must not be done until the lard or butter is melted and the pan ready for the fish, for before the fish is dipped into the egg or mixture it must be rubbed as dry as possible with a cloth, or it will stick to the pan, and the unhappy cook will be driven to despair on finding she is unable to turn the fish without it falling to pieces. The same rule applies to all fish which is fried. Mackerel is best broiled. Herrings are best broiled; a little oatmeal sprinkled over them, instead of bread crumbs, improves the flavour. TIME REQUIRED FOR FRYING FISH. Cod cutlets—seven to ten minutes. Salmon cutlets—five to ten minutes. Flounders—five to ten minutes.

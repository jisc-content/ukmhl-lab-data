To broil fowl for invalids, which is con- sidered one of the lightest and most digestible modes of dressing, it must be cut in halves— divided down the middle—some butter rubbed upon it and a little pepper, but the salt is not to be put on until it has been turned for the last time. The inner side must be first done, which allows the upper to heat thoroughly ; it is then turned, a little salt sprinkled over it, and in a few minutes it is cooked. The grid- iron ought to be well rubbed with lard or drip- ping before the fowl is put on. Some prefer half roasting the fowl first, in which case it ought first to be cut in quarters, then roasted, then broiled. If a young chicken, it must not be roasted, but altogether done on the broiling-iron.

CONVALESCENT COOKERY. 5 could grasp, if a tumbler was beyond rny strength; but I would not like my drink out of a large delft basin, with a thick edge that hurt my lips, and a great side to drink at, which, as I could not swallow quickly, would send all the water over me, wetting my night-clothes and the bed-clothes. Even if a woman have enough natural perception and refinement to guess at these things for herself, there is a great deal to be learned about cooking for sick people that nothing but downright learning, patience, and practice will teach. In speaking of convalescents, we generally mean sick people who are returning to health ; who have had a long illness, and are recovering from it. To these people there comes a stage of convalescence when the doctor, having care- fully watched his patient all through the worst part of the illness, pronounces him to be out of danger, and that he only requires the cook now instead of the doctor.

CONVALESCENT COOKEEY. Gl Before using the gridiron—taking care that it is very clean—the upper surface, on which the meat is to rest, ought to he greased with lard, butter, or dripping, to prevent it sticking, and it should he set slanting downwards towards the hand of the cook. The steak or chop, or whatever meat is to broiled, is to be put on the gridiron, and con- tinually turned every half-minute, moving it gently each time it is turned, to avoid leaving the marks of the bars on the meat. Invalids are rarely allowed to have pepper, so salt is all that may be sprinkled over an invalid's chop. The length of time which meat takes to broil varies according to the thickness of the meat or the heat of the fire, but some idea may be had from the following table, until experi- ence teaches the cook. A rump steak of about H lb.—ten minutes. A fillet steak, rather under £ lb.—seven minutes.

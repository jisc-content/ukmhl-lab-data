CONVALESCENT COOKEIt Y. LI HOW TO GO TO MARKET. ' Ready money,' says Lord Byron, ' is Aladdin's lamp.' If you want to buy with advantage, try and pay ready money for everything. Then, if the beef be not prime in one shop, you may go to another; and if you know of some place where a basket of fresh eggs has just been brought in, you can have some of them, instead of being obliged to keep to a shop having stale ones, because you have a running account there. Good beef ought to be of a bright red colour, with light yellow fat, approaching the hue of fresh butter; the skin thick, with a thin layer of fat between the outer skin and the lean flesh. Inferior beef is hard and firm to the touch but the fat is not firm; the flesh of a dull brown red, with a good deal of gristle.

The diet of the patient should be low till all ap- prehension of a relapse is passed, and limited to milk, boiled vegetables, light puddings, and fish. At no subsequent period ought he to indulge in a full animal diet, or to drink undiluted wines. At the same time, too lowering a regimen is to be avoided, as thereby the irritability of the system and th e heart's action generally are increased. All the causes of the disease already fully referred to should be avoided, counteracted, or overcome.2 1 Mr. Pridlrani, Brit. Med.

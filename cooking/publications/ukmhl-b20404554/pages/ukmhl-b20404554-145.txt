CONVALESCENT COOKERY. 125 and a little lemon peel and sugar. Cover closely, and simmer very slowly for half-an- hour—the slower the better. To bake them, put the peeled and cored apples into a deep dish, scatter sugar over them, add a little water, and bake. TO PREPARE SAGO PLAIN. Put a large tablespoonful of sago into a small saucepan with half-a-pint of hot water, four lumps of sugar—if possible, a glass of port wine. Stir the whole on the fire for a quarter of an hour, and serve it in a teacup. ANOTHER METHOD. Wash a large tablespoonful of the sago in cold water, put it into a saucepan with half-a- pint of milk, a little cinnamon, and when nearly done add two lumps of sugar. Simmer for half-an-hour.

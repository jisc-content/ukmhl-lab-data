COXVALESCENT COOKERY. 109 quarts of water and strain; when the jelly is cold, shim it clear from all fat and sediment; melt it, and flavour with home-made wine and a little lemon peel, or with any essence for which the patient may have a partiality. If for blancmange, the stock must be still more reduced, to bear the addition of some milk, fla- voured with laurel leaf or vanille and lemon peel; the addition of a little wine or brandy will of course improve it. COW-HEEL BAKED IN MILK. Clean well a cow-heel, and put it with two quarts of milk into an earthen jar ; let it stand in a slow oven for five or six hours. The heel may be taken and served with a little parsley and butter, or eaten with mustard and vinegar ; and the milk, which resembles blancmange, skimmed when cold, then melted and flavoured as in the above recipe.

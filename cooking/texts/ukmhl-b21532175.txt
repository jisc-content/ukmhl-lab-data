LONDON! Printed for J. Walter, at Homer’s-Head, Charing-Crofs. M.DCC.LXXXVI.INTRODUCTION To die First Edition. gfll ERE having been a great Number of Publications concern - ^ ing the Art of Cookery, it may perhaps be thought unneceffary to produce another book on the fubjeCi—yet, 1 trujl that, upon exami- nation, this ivork will appear of more real utility than may be at frjl imagined. There are many books of receipts, but I have never met with one that contained any infiruCiions for Regulating a Table.—The great inconvenience, I experienced, on commencing mifirefs of a family, from the vaant of fuch affiance, has find prompted me to attempt a fet of bills of fare, ivhich, I flatter my- felf, will be of great ufe to ladies in general, but particularly to the younger part of my fex, who, on their entering into life, may not have thofe advantages which arife from infiruCtion or from prac- tice, and who are fometimes at a lofs how to conduct their table with that decency and propriety, ivhich are much to be defined, not only in making dinners for company, but in a family way likewife. It is certain, that a woman never appears to greater advantage than at the head of a Well-Regulated Table; whichJhould be ahvays fo fupplied\ that the unexpected viflt of a friend, or even of a fir anger, Jhould occafion no inconvenience or confufion. If a dinner be fmalL and fimple, the manner of ferving it will make it appear to great advantage ; and, I think, 1 may vefiture to fay, that with the af- fifiance of the bills of fare herein inferted, and with the variety that every perfon of moderate tafie will be able to introduce, a table may be fo conducted as to be of credit to the tafie and management of the mifirefs. In regard to the Receipts—They are feleCted with great care from the manufcripts of an experienced houfekeeper-, they are not expenfive, yet, I may with certainty affirm, they will prove excellent in their kind, if followed with exaCtnefs and attention ; and I have given neceffary inflrudions for a fervant in a plain way, that, by applica- tion, if Jhe has a common genius and a go od palate, Jhe may be made capable of any cook's place. I Jhall only add, to recommend this publication, my hope that the pains taken will be found to anfwer the end propofed. a 3 adver.[ ADVERTISEMENT \ ** ' TO THE FIFTH EDITION. f | MHE Editor of Mrs. Mason’s Book of Cookery, moll grateful for the very favourable reception it has been particularly honoured with by the Ladies and the Public, prefents a new edition, in forming which every attention has been exerted to render it complete as pojjible to the prejent time.—Many modern and defirable Receipts are added—The articles of the Appendix to the former Editions are inferred in their proper places of the Work— A full Table of Contents" is at the beginning—and, at the end, a copious Index of the whole—from which the Ladies’ Assistant, by Mrs. Mason, is the most complete House-Keeper’s Companion, and young / married Lady’s fullest Guide for her Table, hitherto extant.

General 'Directions for Boiling, &c. AS neatnefs is a moll: material requifite in a kitchen, be par- ticularly careful to keep all the utenfils perfe&ly clean, the po.s and faucepans well tinned, or lined with filver ; let all meat boil gently, and always ufe foft water, if to be had ; put the meat into the veflel while the water is cold, unlefs it is not fait enough (if beef or pork) then put it into hot, or boiling water ; be fure always to let the veflel be large enough, that the meat may be well covered with water; cover the pot, to prevent the foot dropping into it, and fo clofe that the fmoke from the fire does not get under the edge of the cover ; when it boils, never negleCt to take off the fcum, as that not being at- tended to, fpoils the look of the meat—fome fhake a fmall handful of flour upon the water, which takes up all the fcum —and others pour a little cold water in, when the pot boils, to make the fcum rife. General Directions for Roafting. AS foon as the meat is put to the fire, pour over it fome warm water, which throw away ; this is very neeeflary to thofe who are nice in the drefling their meat, it being a good deal handled in the fpitting ; fhake fome flour over it, bafte it with butter, and-do not put it too near the fire : this, with frequently bail- ing it, a brifk fire, and allowing time enough, are the only means of roafting in perfection : when the fleam draws to the fire, the meat is near done : flour and bafte it juft before it is fent to table, that it may have a nice froth : always allow a longer time for the meat to roaft in frofty weather: take parti- cular care to have the fpit clean, as nothing is more difagreeable than a fpit mark ; and remember, when the meat is half done, to remove the dripping-pan and fpit a little from the fire, and flir it: if it is a good fire before the meat is laid down, once flirting it will in general roaft a joint of meat. Never fait the meat before it is put to the fire, it draws out the gravy too much : if it is to be kept fome time before it is drefled, as in- deed mutton and beef are not good frefli killed, be fure to dry it well with a cloth, and hang it where it will have a thorough air; look at it every day, and wipe off all the damp; it will keep a long time : fome pepper it a little. ' Boiled v LTHE LADY’s ASSISTANT. 121 Boiled Beef. BEEF mud be boiled according to the different pieces: a round, or a haunch-bone, ought not to be thoroughly boiled, as they makegood * bubble and (queak, if under done, or the infide of a round will make a good pie ; a middling fized round will take three hours : brilket and inferior pieces ought to be very well boiled.

Directions to choofe Pork. PORK, if it is meafly, is very dangerous to eat; it may be eafily feen, the fat being full of little kernels: if it is young, the lean will break if pinched, and the fkin will dent by nipping it with the fingers ; the fat will be foft and pulpy, like lard ; if the rind is thick, rough, and cannot be nipped with the fingers, it is old : if the flefh is cool and fmooth, it is frefh : if it is clammy, it is tainted ; it will be worfe at the knuckle than at any other part. Different Pieces of Pork. Fore Quarter. THE fpringand the fore-loin, the fpare-rib and grifkin, are cut from the fore-quarter: the fpring is generally falted and boiled, and the fore-loin roafted ; but fome like them both roafted. Hind Quarter CONSISTS only of the leg and the hind-loin. The leg is either boiled or roafted, and the hind-loin is generally roafted. P'he Head. Tongue. Ears. AND Fhe Feet.

Hog’s lard is the fat of the bacon hog. Many are fond of the liver, fried with bacon. Bacon. THE fat will feel oily, and look white, and the lean of a good colour, and will ftick clofe to the bone, if it is good ; but if there are yellow ftreaks in the lean, it is or will be rufty very foon.

HARE and LEVERET. IN the choice of a hare, both the age and frefhnefs are to be confidered ; if the claws are blunt and rugged, the ears dry and tough, and the cleft wide and large, it is old; if, on the contrary, the claws are fmooth and fharp, the ears tear eafily, and the cleft in the lip not much fpread, it is young. If frelh and newly killed, the body will be ftiff, and the flefh pale; if the flefh is turning black, and the body limber, it is not new. But a hare is never bad till it fmells. To know a real leveret: there fhould be a knob or fmall bone near the foot, on its fore leg ; if not, it muft be a hare. To roaft a Hare. STUFF it with a pudding made of bread-crumbs, chopped fuet, the liver parboiled and bruifed, lemon-peel grated, flared parlley, and fweet herbs, pepper, fait, nutmeg, the yolks of two eggs ; few up the hare ; put a quart of fmall beer into the dripping-pan,[or three pints, according to the fize of the hare ; bafte it with this till the whole is ufed, then flour the hare and bafte it with butter; fend it to table with a fine froth. I have tried all the different things recommended to bafte a hare with, and never found any thing fo good as fmall beer. A fmall hare will take an hour and a half, a large hare two hours. For £iuce—gravy, melted butter, and fweet fauce. To drefs a Hare. WHEN the hare is cafed, cut it in two juft below the ribs ; cut the fore-quarters into pieces, and put them into a clean ftew-pan, with a blade or two of mace, an onion ftuck with cloves, fome whole pepper, an anchovy, and a bunch of fweet herbs ; cover them with water, and let them ftew gently ; make a pudding, and put into the belly of the other part; lard and roaft it, flour and bafte it well with butter or fmall beer : when the ftew is tender, take it out with a fork into a difh, and ftrain off the liquor ; put into it a glafs of red wine, a fpoonful of good ketchup, and a piece of butter rolled in flour; ffiake all together over the fire till it is of a good thicknefs : take up the roaft hare, and lay it in the middle of the difh, with the ftew round, and fauce poured over it.—Some good gravy in a boat* AnotherTHE LADY’s ASSISTANT. 302* Hare Another Way to drefs a Hare.

PHEASANTS. To choofe Pheafants. THEY are of the Englifti cock and hen kind, very beauti- ful, and of a fine flavour : the hen is much valued when with egg : the cock has fpurs, the hen has not: if the cock pheafant is young, the fpurs fhould be fhort and blunt; or round ; if they are long and fharp, he is old. Examine the hen at the vent ; if that is open and green, it is a fign fhe is ftale ; if {he is with egg, it will be foft; if they are ftale, and are rubbed hard with the finger, the fkin will peel. To roajl Pheafants. THEY muft be kept at a diftance from the fire ; flour them, and bafte them often with butter; half an hour will roaft them at a good fire. For fauce—gravy and bread fauce.

SPICES. Ginger. GINGER is a root which grows in the Eafl Indies, and in many parts of America ; the plant which fprings from it has leaves like flags ; it bears fmall flowers. < The beft comes from Calcutta, but very good from many other places, it is dug up in autumn, then wafhed, and fpread on thin hurdles, fupported on treflels. That which is found, and of the deepeft yellow, is bell. Cloves. V/E have cloves from the Dutch. They have deflroyed them in the Molucca iflands, and are propagating them in the ifland of Ternate. They are the fruit of a large beautiful tree, and are gathered before they are ripe. The tree has leaves like the bay. The clove is firft green ; as foon as it begins to turn a little brown, it is gathered, long before it is ripe. What are left upon the t ees grow very large, and are called the mother of cloves ; the fmall ones are gathered in the middle of the day, and laid in a fhady, airy place to dry. X 2 Macejo8 TIIE LADY’s ASSISTANT. Mace and Nutmeg. THESE two fpices are produced from the fame tree, which is large and beautiful ; the leaves are long, and of a fine green ; the flower is like an apple-blofiom ; the fruit is round, and the fize of a middling peach, which it very much refembles. The nutmeg is the kernel, and is covered by the mace. The fruit is cut open, the mace taken off, and that and the nutmeg are dried in a cool, airy place. Some diftinguifh the nutmeg into male and female. The common nutmeg is the female; the other is longer, and Jefs valuable. They are produced from the fame tree, which is not unlike our pear-tree in its manner of growing. Its leaves, •whether green or dried, have, when bruifed, a very agreeable fmell. It grows in the Eaft Indies. The belt mace is foft, oily, and fragrant. The nutmeg fliould be found, hard, and heavy, of a pale colour on the outfide, and finely marbled within. The Dutch fupply us with nutmegs and mace, the whole fpice-trade being in their hands. Cinnamon. CINNAMON is the produce of the ifland of Ceylon. It is the inner bark of a beautiful tree. The leaves are like thofe of a bay-tree; of a fine fpicy tafte, and moft agreeable fmell. The bark, when frefh, has little tafte; its flavour grows higher as it dries. The fincft is in fmall quills, of a bright colour, a ftrong fmell, and a fharp biting tafte. Sometimes they extract an oil from it before it is brought over ; it is then very infipid, and Caftia bark is often amongft it. The tafte is the beft way to judge of its excellence ; that which has loft its oil, is lefs iharp and quick. After holding the Caflia fome time in the mouth, it turns to a kind of jelly. Pepper. THERE are three kinds of pepper ; the black, the white, and the long. The Chyan and Jamaica pepper are not of that kind, though called by that name. There are two forts of white pepper; one is made by fteeping black pepper in fea wa- ter, and then taking off the fkin ; the other is the fruit of a different plant, but very like the black pepper. I hefe are both long trailing plants; they have jointed ftalks, and are Email : the fruit follows them. It is firft: green, then reddilh.THE LADY’S ASSISTANT. 309 and of a deep purple when ripe, but grows black and wrinkled when d refling. Pepper is gathered in November ; the white is larger and milder than the black. It comes from" the Eaft Indies. 1 hat which is largeft, and moil: free from duft, is the beft. The long pepper is of the fame nature, but milder. All-fpice. THIS fpice is called Jamaica pepper, from the place of its growth; and all-fpice, from its having the tafte of all other fpices. It is the fruit of a large tree: the leaves are broad ; the flowers are fmall, and grow in bunches; after which comes the fruit, which is gathered when ripe, and dried in the (hade. When it is good, it is large, full, and of a good colour. It is a very good fpice for common ule, but not equal to the others in flavour. 1Turmerick IS the root of a plant of an oblong figure ; it is generally in pieces from half an inch to an inch in length ; and at the utmoft furface, the thicknefs of a man’s little finger : it is very heavy, hard to break, and not eafily cut with a knife : the out- lide is of a fine whitifh grey, with a tinge of faint yellow ; but, when it is broke, the infide is of a fine yellow, if the root is frefh. It grows redder by keeping, till at laft it will become of the colour of faffron in the cake; thrown into water, it foon, gives it a fine yellow tinge. It is eafily powdered in a mortar, and, according to its different age, makes a yellow, an orange- colour, or reddifli powder. It has a kind of aromatic fmell, fomething like ginger; the tafte is acrid, difagreeable, and bitter. It is brought from the Eaft Indies, where they ufe it in fauces and foods. SALTS. THERE are two kinds of fait; the common, and fait- petre. i he firft is made from the fea-water, from falt-fprings, or ehe dug out of the ground. The other is collected from old walls, or the cliffs of rocks, in a rough ftate ; or from certain earth, and afterwards refined. We have the falt-petre rough from the Eaft, and we refine it here. The common fait, of feveral kinds, is dug or made in Europe. Of xhe common lalt there are four different kinds 3 fea fait, X 3 bay/ •< 3jo THE LADY’s ASSISTANT. bay fait, rock fait, and bafket fait. Sea fait is made by boiling and evaporating lea water over the fire. Bay fait, by evaporat- ing fea water in pits, clayed on the infide by the heat of the fun. Bafket fait is made by boiling away the water of fait fprings over the fire. Rock fait is dug out of the ground, and when very fine, is called falt-gemme. There are only two kinds of falt-petre ; they go by different names : that which is purified is called falt-petre, and that which is rough as it conies from abroad, is called petre-falt. The pure falt-petre is much ftronger than the other. S U G v- A R. SUGAR is the product of the Eaft and Weft Indies. It is a kind of reed, but is called a fugar-cane. 1 he reed is of the nature of ours, only much larger. The fugar is made of its juice boiled up to a confidence. At firft it is very coarfe and brown, but is refined, after it is brought over, by our fugar- bakers. O I L. THERE are many forts of oil, but only one ufed for the table, which is that produced by the olive. Thofe which we eat, are gathered before they are ripe ; but when the oil is to be preffed from them, they are left upon the tree till full ripe, and preffed when they are almoft rotten. We have oil from moft of the warm parts of Europe, but it is different in purity and value, by the lcfier or greater care taken in the making of it. Italian oil is generally the fineft. That of Lucca and Florence is particularly efteemed. They make very good oil in France. In the choice of oil we are to judge by the fmell and tafte. It Ihould be free from both. In general any fmell or tafte is a fault. Oil fhouid he quite pure and infipid, its only quality being foftnefs. In cold weather, oil congeals, and its purity may be guefl'ed by its appearance 5 for the finer the oil, the fmaller are the lumps. VINEGAR. To make common Vinegar. TAKE a middling fort of beer, but indifferently hopped $ when it has done working, and is quite fine, put into it fome rapes ; mafh them together in a tub, let it ftand till it fettles, then draw it off very clear, and put it into a cafk $ cover the bungTHE LADY’s ASSISTANT. 311 bung with a piece of flate, then fet it where the fun may come upon it, for thirty-five or forty days ; by that time it will be fit for ufe. It is very good fined, and kept from growing mufty. Vinegar made of Sugar and Water. TO two quarts of water put one pound of brown fugar, boil and feum it well ; add two quarts of cold water, and work it with a toaft fpread with yeaft ; ftir it nine days fuccefiively, then put it into a calk, and let it ftand from April till Septem- ber in the fun ; the calk not flopped, but covered with a board. White-Wine Vinegar, FILL a calk with good white wine, but do not put in the bung; fet it where the fun may come upon it, or in any other hot place ; in a little time it will be fit for ufe. Vinegar of foul Wine. BOIL it till one-third is wafted ; while it is boiling, take care to feum it very clear; then put it into a calk, and fome chervil with it; flop it clofe, and it will foon be fit for ufe. Vinegar may be made of any fruits, flowers, herbs, or roots, by putting them into the vinegar, and letting them ftand till it fmells or tallies of them. Garlic Vinegar. A quart of vinegar, eight cloves of garlic, two lliced nut- megs, and fixty cloves. Goofeberry Vinegar. BRUISE fome goofeberries that are quite ripe, and to three quarts of water put one of goofeberries ; let it ftand twenty- four hours, then ftrain it through canvafs, and after that through a flannel bag; put one pound of coarfe fugar to every gallon of this liquor; ftir it well together ; put it into a calk, and let it ftand nine or ten months, then it will be fit for ufe. The longer it Hands the better. The water muft be boiled, and ftand till it is cold, before it is mixed with the goofeberries. This is good vinegar for pickling. Raifin Vinegar. TO every two pounds of Malaga raifins put four quarts of fpring water; lay a tile over the bung, and fee it in the fun till it is fit for ufe. A ftone bottle will do as well as a calk. If it is put in tne chimney-corner, and kept there a proper time, it floes as well as if fet in the fun.312 THE LADY’s ASSISTANT. Vinegar of Rofes. TAKE dried rofes, put them into double glafles, or a ftone bottle; a handful or more to a quart of white-wine vinegar •, fet them in the fun, or by the fire, or in a warm oven, till their virtue is extra&ed ; then ftrain it, and keep it for ufe. Tarragon Vinegar. TO every gallop of ftropg white-wine vinegar put a pound of tarragon leaves, (tripped from the {talks juft as it is going to bloom ; put it with the vinegar into a (tone jug, to foment for a fortnight, then run it through a flannel bag; to every four gallons of vinegar put half an ounce of ifinglafs diflolved in cyder; mix it well with the vinegar : then put it into large bottles, and let it ftand one month tp fine ; then rack it off, and put it into pint bottles for ufe.

TRUFFLES grow like mufhrooms, but never appear above the ground in their natural ftate. They generally lie ten inches deep ; after they are ripe, they rot in the ground, and young ones grow in great numbers from every old truffle which de- cays. ^ The truffle has a very rich, tart, and high flavour, when , frefh, but lofes it in a great ineafure when dried ; however, they are generally ufed in made difhes. They are common in France and Italy, and we have them in fome parts of England. M O R E L L S. MORELLS are likewife of the mulhroom kind, but they rife above the earth about three inches, of the bignefs of an egg, of a dufky-whitifh colour; they have a higher flavour frefh than drv. They grow in England, but are more com- mon and richer in flavour in the warmer parts of Europe. CHYAN PEPPER. THE plant which bears this pod, is raifed fometimes in out- gardens. Its proper name is Capficum. From its growing in Africa, it is called Guinea pepper; and Chyan pepper, from its growth in America. The pods are long, and when ripe, of a fmooth fine red colour. Some call it Garden-coral. The powder of this is called chyan pepper, and is made as follows : The pods are gathered when full ripe; they are opened, the feeds taken out, and the pods laid to dry in the fun ; when quite dry, they are beaten to a coarfe powder. This powder is chyan pepper in the plaineft way, but there are many ways of preparing it. Some mix bay-falt with it, and ethers powder of mufhrooms. MUSHROOMS. MUSHROOMS are very ufeful for fauces and made difhes, but great care fnould be taken to procure the right fort. Thofe are good which grow upon commons, but are liable to be mixed with bad ones ; therefore it is beft to ufe thofe from the hot-beds. The upper part of the right fort are of a roundifh form, like a button ; the ftalk white, the under part, or gills, of a fine pale red, but when broken, are very white ; when they are left in the ground, they grow very large and flat, and the red part changes to a very dark colour. When they are fmall, they are called buttons, and are fit for pickling; but when they grow large, they are called flaps, and are put to otfler3U THE LADY’s ASSISTANT. other ufes, which will be mentioned hereafter. Thofe which are a fize between the buttons and flaps, are fit to ufe frefh. The bad fort, which are picked up amongfl thofe that grow naturally on the commons and in the fields, are not fo flat at the top ; the under part, or gills, is white, inftead of the fine red ; if they are rubbed with the fingers, they turn yellow, and ■when pickled are never white.

The liquor will make ketchup. To keep Mujhrooms in Salt and Water. MAKE them very clean, taking out the gills ; boil them tender in water and a little fait, dry them with a cloth ; make a ftrong brine ; when cold put in the mufhrooms; at the end of a fortnight change the brine ; put them into fmall bottles, pour oil on the top.

T AKE fome fine hard white cabbage?, cut them very fmall; have ready a tub, according to the quantity which is to be done ; put the cabbages into the tub : to every four or five cabbages throw in a handful of fait; when they are all putin. Jay on them a very heavy weight, to prefs them down as flat as poflible ; throw a cloth on them, and lay on the cover ; let them ftand a month, when they may be ufed, but they will keep twelve months ; it muff be always kept clofe covered : a few carraway-feeds pounded fine, and thrown in, make it eat well. The way to drefs it, is with a fine piece of fat beef flawed. Cauliflower-ftalks, and cabbage-ftalks, peeled and cut down, and done in the fame manner, are very good. 2~he true German Way of making Sour Croat, or Sour Cabbage. TAKE white cabbages, and clean them v/ell from all the green and fuperfluous leaves; cut through the middle, and take the hearts out; cut and flice the cabbages as fmall as poflible, but cut them no longer than they are perfe£tly nice and fine. Rub the infide of the cafk well with yeaft, it will help to four the cabbage, and prevent the fait liquor from running out. When there is a quantity cut (not all which is to be done), fpread it upon a dry table, fait it moderately, and roll it well. Do not pull too much at a time, as it cannot be worked thro’ fufficiently ; ftrew a little coriander-feed over it, if agreeable. Put it into the calk, and prefs it down very hard ; repeat this till the calk is quite full ; cover it with vine-leaves, put a dry cloth over them, and leave it till next morning, then put on the head of the calk over the leaves and cloth, and put a very heavy weight upon it, to keep it quite clofe. O&ober is the proper time to do it; it will be fit to eat in two months. When the cabbage is taken out to drefs, be careful to take off all that looks whitilh ; it is not good till it begins to grow yellow ; the deeper the cabbage lies, the finer and better it will be. When what is wanted is taken out for one d refling, cover the cabbage with vine-leaves, as long as they can be got, and when they fail, with a dry cloth. Take great care the fait liquor does not run out, if it does, the cabbage will infal- libly fpoil. Boil the cabbage with a good deal of butte r in a weli-tinn’d veffel; put no more water than jult enough to Z 4 cover344 THE LADY’s ASSISTANT. cover it, with a fheet of paper over it, and let it boil till fuffi- ciently done.

They gather the buds from the blofToms before they open, then fpread them upon the floor in a room where no fun enters, then let them lie till they begin to wither ; they then throw them into a tub of fharp vinegar; and after three days they add a quantity of bay-lalt: when this is diflolved, they are fit for packing for fale, and are fent to all parts of Europe.

To fome olives they add a fmall quantity of effence of fpices, which is an oil drawn from cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, coriander, and fweet fennel feed diftilled together for that purpofe : twelve drops are enough for a bufhel of olives: fome prefer them fla- voured with this eflence, but others like them beft plain.

PUT the chips of eighteen Seville oranges into three quarts of brandy, and let them fteep a fortnight, in a ftone bottle clofe flopped: boil two quarts of fpring water with a pound and a half of the fineft fugar, near an hour, very gently ; clarify the water and fugar with the white of an egg, then flrain it through a jelly- bag, and boil it near half away ; and when cold flrain the brandy into the fyrup.

Birch Wine with Raifins. TO an hogfhead of birch-water, take four hundred of Ma- laga raifins, pick them clean from the {talks, and cut them fmall, then boil them in the birch-liquor an hour at lead; fcum it well, and let it ftand till it is as warm as cow’s milk ; then put in the raifins, and let it {land clofe covered, ftirring it well four or five times every day; boil all the {talks in a gal- lon or two of birch-liquor, which, added to the other when alrnoft cold, gives it an agreeable roughnefs.. Let it ftand ten days, then put it in a cool cellar, and when it has done hif- fing in the veflel, flop it up clofe ; let it ftand at leaft three quarters of a year before it is bottled. To procure the Birch-Liquor. IT fhould be taken in the month of March from the birch- tree, while the fap is rifing, before the leaves fhoot out; holes muft be bored in the body of the tree, and foflets put in, which are generally made of the branches of elder, the pith being taken out—the tree may be tapped in four or five places at a time, and by that means fave from many trees feveral gal- lons every day ; the bottles in which it drops muft be corked clofe, and rofined or waxed, but it fhould be ufed as foon as poffible. Birch Wine with Sugar. TO every gallon of birch-liquor put two pounds of good fugar; let the liquor boil half an hour, and fcum it well be- fore the fugar is put in, for it muft boil no longer after the fugar is in, than while fcummed ; then put it through a hair- fieve into a tub, and when it is cold, pour it from the grounds, and put fome yeaft to it; a quart will work up twelve gallons ; let it v/ork twenty-four hours, till it hath a pretty good head ; the veftel muft be entirely filled, and muft be very fweet and ftrong, and fmoaked with brimftone before the wine is put in when it has done working, ftop it up very clofe. Let it ftand ’ in a cool cellar three quarters of a year before bottling. Mead462 THE LADY’s ASSISTANT. Mead JVine, an excellent Receipt, from a Lady. TO one hundred and twenty gallons of pure water (the fofter the better) I put fifteen gallons of clarified honey; when the honey is well mixed with the water, I fill my copper (the fame I ufe for brewing) which holds only fixty gallons, and boil it, till it is reduced about a fourth part; I then draw it off, and boil the remainder of the liquor in the fame manner. When this laft is about a fourth part wafted, I fill up the cop- per with fome of that which was firft boiled; and continue boiling it and filling it up, till the copper contains the whole of the liquor, or mull; by which time it is of courfe half evaporated. I mull obferve, that, in boiling, I never take off the fcum ; but, on the contrary, have it well mixed with the liquor whilft boiling, by means of a jet; when this is done, I draw it off into under-backs, by a cock at the bottom of the copper, where I let it remain till it is only as warm as new milk. At this time I turn it up, and fuffier it to ferment in the veflel, where it will form a thick head. As foon as it has done working, I flop it down very clofe, in order to keep the air from it as much as poftible. 1 keep this, as well as all my mead, in a cellar or vault I have for the purpofe, being very deep and cool ; and the door fhuts fo clofe, as to keep out, in a manner, all the outward air; fo that the liquor is always in the fame temperature, being not at all affe£ted by change of weather ; and to this I attribute, in a great meafure, the good- nefs of my mead. Another proportion I have of making mead, is to allow eighty pounds of purified honey to one hundred and twenty gallons of foft water, which I manage in the making, in all refpe&s, like that firft above mentioned ; and it proves very pleafant, good, light drinking, and is by many preferred to the other, which is much richer, and has a fuller flavour; but at the fame time it is more inebriating, and apt to make the head ach, if drank in too large quantities; there- fore, upon the whole, I imagine the laft to be the proportion that makes the wholefomeft liquor for common drink; the other being rather, when properly preferved, a rich cordial, fomething like fine old Malaga, which, when in perfe&ion, is efteemed the beft of the Spanifh wines. I chufe, in general, to have this liquor pure and genuine, though many love it beft when it has an aromatic flavour—fuch mix elder, rofe- mary, and marjoram flowers with it; and ufe cinnamon, cloves, ginger, pepper, and cardamoms, in various propor- tions.THE LADY’s ASSISTANT; 463 tions, according to their tafte. Qthers put in a mixture of thyme, eglantine, marjoram, and rofemary, with various lpices ; but I do not approve this laft practice at all, as green herbs are apt to make mead drink flat; and too many cloves, befides influencing it greatly in the tafte, make it high-co- loured.—I never bottle my mead before it is half a year old ; and when I do, I take care to have it well corked, and keep it in the fame vault wherein it ftood whilft in the cafk. Another Way to make Mead. TO five quarts of honey put fixty quarts of water, eighteen races of fliced ginger, and one handful of rofemary ; let them boil three hours, and continue fcumming while they boil; when it is cold put in the yeaft, and it will be fit to bottle in eight or ten days, T0 make fmall Mead. TO a gallon of water, two pounds of honey, one pound of fugar ; boil it an hour, put in the whites of three or four eggs, to raife the fcum ; fcum it clean while boiling, then turn it into a clean tub, and let it ftand a week, but at the fame time put in a toaft with honey to make it work ; then tun it, and put in the peels of three or four lemons j let it ftand a month, and if it is not fine, add fome more honey to it, and let it ftand longer. Clary Wine. TO ten gallons of water, a quarter of a hundred of fugar, and the whites of thirteen eggs beat, and put into the water cold; then boil the water and fugar two hours, fcum it all the while, let it ftand till it is cold ; put it in the veffel upon the clary, ftir it three or four times when it has done working, then flop it clofe: in fix months it will be fit to draw. Cowjlip Wine. TO fix gallons of water put thirty pounds of Malaga rat- fins; boil the water full two hours, and then meafure it out of the copper upon the raifins, which muft be chopped fmall, and put into a tub ; let them work together ten days, ftirring it fe~ veral times a day 5 then ftrain it off, and prefs the raifins hard, to get out their ftrength ; then take two fpoonfuls of good ale yeaft, beat up with it fix ounces of fyrup of lemons, put in three pecks of cowflips by degrees; let all the ingredients work to- gether4S4 'THE LADY’s ASSISTANT. gether three days, ftirring it three or four times a day, then tiin it up ; bottle it at four months end. To make Currant Wine. GATHER your currants when full ripe, fqueeze them, and prefs out all the juice through an hair fieve ; throw the ftalks into cold water, ftrain them out alfo through an hair fieve; to every gallon of juice put two gallons of water ; and to every gallon of liquor, when mixed, put three pounds and a half of the beft Lifbon lugar ; put it in a tub, and let it {land two or three days, ftirring it twice a day ; then put it in a cafk, and let it ftand ten or twelve months—you muft notftop it up until it hath done finging : when you draw it off, bottle all that is fine ; and let the thick run through a flannel bag, and put it into the cafk again with a little fugar, juft to keep it from fpoiling, and let it ftand until it is fine. When you firft put your wine into your cafk, before it has done working, you muft lay a piece of paper over the bung ; and when it hath done working, flop it up clofe. That which is racked off through the flannel muft be.flop- ped up directly, when put into the cafk. N. B. A pint of brandy may be put in when it is working (that is, in a ftate of fermentation) and another pint when the fermentation is flopped : the above quantity of brandy to about twenty gallons of wine. Another Way to make Currant Wine. TAKE five quarts of the juice of currants.; fourteen pounds of fugar will make a five-gallon cafk ; fill it up with water, and let it all work together ; when it has done working, put in a quart of brandy, and a hop or two. Orange Wine. TO every fix gallons of fpring water, one ftone of the beft powder fugar, and the whites of five eggs beat up to a frotn ; let it boil near two hours flowly; when it is quite cold, add the juice of fifty Seville oranges, fo thin pared that none of the white remains; add five fpoonfuls of barm, beat up with as much fyrup of citron, or of oranges ; let it ftand two days and two nights ; when it is tunned, add to it two bottles of moun- tain wine ; tun up the rinds and all together. Let it ftand fix months or more ; if it is not fine in that time, it muft be fined.THE LADY’s ASSISTANT. 465 and muft be looked at once a week : as it fometimes works in the veflel, it muft have air by a vent. Vino Pontificate. STEEP the zeft rinds of fix oranges and fix lemons twenty- four hours in a gallon of good brandy, clofe flopped ; boil on« pound and a half of loaf-fugar in two gallons of water a quar- ter of an hour, and clarify it with the whites of ten eggs % when it is cold add the juice of twenty-four oranges and five lemons to the gallon of brandy ; then mix it all together, and ftrain off the rinds : put the liquor into a calk well flopped j after fix weeks draw it off into bottles, it will then be fit for ufe, but grows better for keeping. Raifin Wine. THREE hundred and a half of Malaga raifins, fixty-fix: gallons of water, in a large tub with a falfe bottom ; let them Hand for twenty-two or twenty-three days, ftirring them once or twice a day ; then draw them off into a clean hogfliead, and let them work as long as they will, filling the hogfhead full every day for five or fix months; then rack the liquor into another calk, and put to it two gallons of brandy. Red. Raifin Wine. TO every gallon of water boiled, and cold, put five pounds of velvedores ; let it ftand fourteen days, ftirring it twice a day, then prefs it off; if there is no prefs, it muft be ftrained through a cloth ; work in it a toaft fpread with yeaft, for two days, and then put it into a cafk—it muft not be flopped till it has done working; when it is fine, bottle it off. The raifins muft be chopped before they are foaked. Goofieberry Wine. TO every three pounds of ripe goofeberries, put a pint of fpring water unboiled ; firft bruife the fruit with the hands in, a tub, and then put the water to them ; ftir them very well, and let them ftand a day, then ftrain them out; and to every three pounds of goofeberries and pint of water, put a pound of fugar; ftir it till the fugar is diftolved, and let it ftand twenty- four hours more, then feum the top clear off; put the liquor in a veflel, and the feum into a flannel bag, and what runs from it, put into the veflel ; it muft work two or three days, and then be flopped clofe. Let it ftand four months before it is bottled ; II h ani466 THE LADY’S ASSISTANT. ahd if it is not clear, let it (land in the bottles for fome time, and then rack it off into other bottles—when it is drawn out of the cafk it muff not be tapped too low. ‘ . • JiLj*. K- * n Grape Wine. TO a gallon of grapes put a gallon of water; bruife the grapes, let them ftand a week without ftirring, then draw it off hue ; put to a gallon of the wine three pounds of fugar, and then put it in a veffel, but do not flop it till it has done bif- fing. Elder Wine. TAKE fixteen pounds of Malaga raifins, pick and chop them very fmall ; take fix pounds of powder fugar, and five gallons of water; boil them all together a quarter of an hour, then pour the liquor boiling hot upon the raifins : ftir them well together, and let them ftand ten days, flirring it well every day ; then ftrain the liquor, and prefs out the raifins ; add to each gallon a pint of the pure juice of elder-berries; put to it a very little ale-yeaft fpread on a bit of toaft, juft enough to make it move, not to work up ; let it ftand two or three days to ferment, then tun it up irito a veffel, but let it not be full, that there may be room for it to work ; ftop it clofe, let it ftand to be thoroughly fine, and then bottle it. Another very excellent Receipt for Elder Wine.

CONTAINING CAUTIONS RELATIVE TO THE USE OF LAUREL-LEAVES, HEMLOCK, MUSPIROOMS, COPPER-VESSELS, EARTHEN-JARS, &c. WITH Obfervations on the Adulteration of Bread and Flour, And the Nature and Properties of Water. ON KITCHEN-POISONS. l. The Lauro-Cerafus, or Common Laurel. THE water diftilled from the leaves of this tree has been frequently mixed with brandy, and other fpirituous liquors, in order to give them the flavour of ratifia ; and the leaves are often ufed in cookery, to communicate the fame kind of tafte to cream, cuftards, puddings, and fome forts of fweetmeats. But, in the year 1728, an account of two women dying fuddenly in Dublin, after drinking'fome of the common diliilled laurel-water, give life to feveral experiments, made upon dogs, with the di{tilled water, and with the infufion of the leaves of the lauro-cerafus, communicated by Dr. Madden, phyfician at Dublin, to the Royal Society in EYigland, and afterwards repeated (in the year 1731) and confirmed by Dr. Mortimer, F. R. S. by Which It appeared, that both the water and lVe infufion bro ugh Lon convulfions, palfy, and death.THE LADY’s ASSISTANT. 4;$ The laurus of the ancients, or the bay, is, on the contrary, of a falutary nature, and of ufe in feveral diiorders. The lauro-cerafus is a plant of a very deleterious kind, and, in a large quantity, moft formidably poilonous ; yet, when adminiltered with proper caution, and in l'mall proportion, the leaves of the plant are generally thought not otherwife than innocent ; and therefore, for kitchen purpoies, as the flavouring of cuftards, &c. the ufe, in guarded and common mode- ration, may be continued in perfect fafety. T he bitter parts of the plant, in which alfo the noxious properties are fuppofed to refide, are determined to be the fame in quality, and not fenfibly different in degree, from the bitter almond, and the kernels of any of the ltoned fruits ; and in Holland, Linnaeus mentions, that an infufion of this kind of laurel is ufed in the praCb'ce of the healing art. Miller alfo fays, that laurel-leaves are perfe&ly innocent 5 a nice attention is however certainly neceffary in the ufe of them. The remedy againft the poifonous laurel is from ten to forty drops of fal ammoniac, in a glafs of water, repeated as the fymptoms may require. 2. Small Hemlock, or Fools Parjlcy. Defcription. THE firft leaves are divided into numerous fmall parts, which are of 2 pale green, oval, pointed, and deeply indented. The (talk is flender, round, upright, ftriated, and about a yard high. The flowers are white, growing at the tops of the branches in little umbells. It is an annual plant, common in orchards and kitchen gardens, and flowers in June and July This plant has Seen often miflaken for parfley : and from thence it has received the name of Fools Par/ley. Though it feems not to be of fo virulent a nature as the larger hemlock, yet Boerhaave places it among the vegetable poifons, in his Inftitutes ; and, in his Hillory of Plants, produces an inftance of its pernicious effeCts. It is therefore neceffary to guard againft. it in collecting herbs for fallads, and other purpofes. 3. Mujhrooms. • MUSHROOMS have been long ufed in fauces, in ketchup, and other forms of cookery. They were highly efteemed by the Romans, as they are at prefent by the French, Italians, and other nations. Pliny exclaims againff the luxury of his countrymen in this article.; and wonders what extraordinary pleafure there can be, in eating fuch dangerous food. The ancient writers on the Materia Medica leem to agree, that mufhrooms are in general unwholsfome ; and the moderns, Lemery, Allen, Geoffroy, Boerhaave, Linnaeus, and others, concur in the fame opi- nion. There are numerous inftances upon record of their fatal effeCfs. Aimoft all of them, as the laft-mentioned author affirms, “ are fraught with poifon.” The common efculent kinds, if eaten too freely, frequently bring on heart-burns, fickneffes, vomitings, diarrhoeas, dyfenteries, and other dan- gerous fymptoms It is therefore to be wifhed, that they were banifhetl from the table. But, if the palate muff be indulged in thefe treacherous gratifications, or, as Seneca calls them, this “ voluptuouspoilon,” it is ne- ceffary.47-6 THE LADY’S ASSISTANT. ceflary, that they who are employed in colle&ing them Ihould be extremely cautious, left they (hould collett fuch as are abl'olutely pernicious ; which, confulering to whole care this is generally committed, may, and undoubt- edly has, frequently happened. The eatable mulh rooms at firft appear of a roundifli form, like a button ; the upper part and the ftalk are very white ; the under part is of a livid flelh-colour ; but the flefhy part, when broken, is very white. When thefe are fuffered to remain undifturbed, they will grow to a large fize, and ex- pand themfelves almoft to a fiatr.efs, and the red part underneath will change to a dark colour. Copper Vejfels. COPPER, when it is handled, yields an offenfive fmell, and if touched with the tongue, a Iharp pungent tafte, and even excites a naufea, Ver- degris is nothing but a iolution of this metal by vegetable acids. And it is well known, that a very fmall quantity of this folution will produce cholics, vomitings, intolerable thirft, univerfal convulfions, and other dan- gerous fymptoms. If thefe effefls, and the prodigious divifibility of this metal be confidered, there can be no doubt of its being a violent and fub- tile poifon : we are daily expoied to this poifon by the ufe of copper vefiels for drefllng our food. The very air of the kitchen, abounding with olea- ginous.and faline particles, penetrates and difpofes them to difl'olution, be- fore they are uled. Water, by Handing fome time in a copper veftel, is im- pregnated with verdegris, as may be demonftrated by throwing into it a ima’ll quantity of any volatile alkali, which will immediately tinge it with a paler or deeper blue, in proportion to the ruft contained in the water. Vinegar, apple-fauce, greens, oil, greafe, butter, and almoft every other kind of food, will extraft the verdegris in a greater degree. It is true, people imagine, that the ill effefts of copper are prevented by its being tin- ned ; but the tin, which adheres to the copper, is fo extremely thin, that it is foon penetrated by the verdegris, which infinuates itfelf through the pores of that metal, and appears green upon the furface. Verdegris is one of the moft violent poifons in nature : yet, rather than quit an old ctiftom, the greater part of mankind are content to fwallow fome of this poifon every day. Ou.r food receives its quantity of poifon in the kitchen, by the ufe of copper pans and difhes. The brewer mingles poifon in our beer, by boil- ing it in a copper. Salt is diftributed to the people from copper fcales, covered with verdegris. Pickled cucumbers are rendered green by an in- fufion of copper coin. The paftry-cook bakes our tarts in copper patty- pans. But confeftions and fyrups have greater powers of deltru&ion : for they are let over a fire in copper vefiels, which have not been tinned; and the verdegris is plentifully extracted by .the acidity of the compolition. And though we do not, after'all, fwallow death in a ftngle dofe, yet it is certain, that a quantity of’poifon, however fmall, which is repeated with, every meal, mult produce more fatal effefts than is generally believed. Bell-metal kettles are very often uled in boiling cucumbers for pickling, in order to make them green. This is an abfurd and dangerous practice. If the cucumbers acquire any additional greenneis by the ule of thefe kettles, iiiey can only derive it from the copper, of which they ate made. According iTHE LADY’s ASSISTANT. 477 According to fome writers, bell-metal is a compofition of tin and coppeY, or pewter and copper, in the proportion of twenty pounds of pewter, or twen- ty-three pounds of tin, to one hundred weight of copper. According to others, this metal is made of copper, a tboufand pounds ; tin, from two to three hundred pounds; and brafs, one hundred and fifty pounds. Spoons and other kitchen utenfils are frequently made of a mixed metal, called alchemy ; or, as it is vulgarly pronounced, ockimy. The ruft of this metal, as well as the former, is highly pernicious. The author of a trafl, entit'ed, “ Serious Refleflions on the Dangers attending theUfeof Copper Velfels,” publilhed atLondon in 1755, afferts, that *' the greater frequency of palfies, apoplexies, madnefs, and all the frightful train of nervous diforders, which fuddenly attack us, without our being able to account for the caufe, or which gradually weaken our vital faculties, are the poifonous effects of this pernicious matter, taken into the body infenfibly with our victuals, and thereby intermixed with our blood and juices.” However this maybe, it is certain, that there have been innumerable inftan- ces oi the pernicious confequences of eating food drelfed in copper velfels, not fufficiently cleaned from this ruft. On this account the Senate of Sweden, about the year 1753, prohibited copper velfels, and ordered, that none but fitch as were made of iron Ihould be ufed in their fleets and armies. But if copper velfels are Hill continued, every cook and good houfewife Ihould be particularly careful in keeping them clean and well-tinned : and Ihould fuller nothing to remain in them longer than is abfolutely necelfary for the purpofe of cookery.

The glazing of fuch veflels is corroded by tile vinegar ; for, upon evaporating the liquor, a quantity of the fait of lead will be found at the bottom. A Cure way of judging whether the vinegar, or other acids, have diflblved part of the glazing, is, by their becoming vapid, or Jofing their (liarpnefs, and acquiring a fweetifh tafte by (landing in them'for feme time : in which cafe the contents are to be thrown away as pernicious. The fubflance of the pottery ware commonly called Delft, the bed being made at Delft in Holland, is a whitifh clay when baked, and ’foft, as not hav^ ing endured a great heat in baking. The glazing is a compofition of calcined lead, calcined tin, land, fame coarfe alkaiine fait, and fandiver ; which being run into a white glafs, the white colour being owing to the tin, is afterwards ground in a mill, then mixed with water, and the veflels, after being baked in the furnace, are dipped into it, and put into the furnace a fecond time ; by which means, with a i'mall degree of heat, the white glafs runs upon the veflels. This glazing is exceedingly foft, and eafily cracks. What effe&s acids will have upon it, the author of thel’e oblervations cannot fay, not having tried them : but they feem to be improper for infpiflating the juice of lemons, oran- ges, or any other ar id fruits. The molt proper velfels for thefe purpofes are porcelain or china ware. The fubflance of them is of fo clofe a texture, that no faline, or other liquor, can penetrate them. The glazing, which is made likewile of the fubflance of the china, is l’ofirm and ciofe, that no fait or faline fubflance can have the lead ef- feCl upon it. It mult, however, be ohferved, that this.remark is only applica- ble to the porcelain made in China : for fome fpecies of the European manu- factory are certainly glazed with a fine glafs of lead, &c. Next to china is the ftone ware, commonly called the StafFordfliire ware. The fubflance of thefe veflels is a compolition of black flint, and a ftrong clay, that bakes white. Their outfides are glazed by throwing into the fur- nace, when well heated, common or fea fait decrepitated ; the fleam or acid of which, flying up among the veflels, vitrifies the outfides of them, and gives them the glazing. This ftone ware does not appear to be injured or affected, by any kind of falts, either acid or alkaline, or any liquors, hot or cold. They are therefore extremely proper for all common ufes ; but require a careful management, as they are much apter to crack with any fudden heat, than china. REMARKS on the ADULTERATION of BREAD and FLOUR. IN the fophiftication of flour, mealmen and bakers have been known to ufe bean-meal, chalk, whiting, flaked lime, alum, and even aflies of bones. Thefirft, bean flour, is perfectly innocent, and affords a nourifhment equal to that of wheat; but there is a touglinefs in bean-flour, and its co- lour is dufky. To remove thefe defeCts, chalk is added to whiten it, alum to give the whole compound that confiftence which is neceflary to make it knead well in the dough, and jalap to take off the aftringency. It may be fuppofed, that thefe horrid iniquities are only imaginary, or at leaft exagge- rated, and that fuch mixtures mult be difcoverable even by the moft ordinary taile jTHE LADY’S ASSISTANT. 479 * The tafte 5 but as fome adulterations of this nature have certainly been prac- ticed, the following experiments may ferve to gratify curiofity, or dil'cover frauds, where uny fucllcxilt. “ To difeover whether flour be adulterated with whiting or chalk, mix with it fome juice of lemon or good vinegar. If the flour be pure, they will remain together at reft ; but: if there be a mixture of whiting or chalk, a fermentation, like the working of yeafl, will enfue. The adulterated meal is whiter and heavier than the good : the quantity that an ordinary tea- difh will contain has been found to weigh more than the fame quantity of genuine flour, by four drachmsand 19 grains Troy. “ The regular method to detect thefle frauds in bread is this:—Cut the crumb of a loaf into very thin dices $ break them, but not into very finall pieces, and put them into a glafs cucurbit, with a large quantity of water. Set this, without (baking, in a fand furnace, and let it (land, with a mode- rate warmth, four-and-twenty-hours. The crumb of the bread will in this time loften in all its parts, and the ingredients will ieparate from it. The alum will diflolve in the water, and may be extracted from it in the ufual way. The jalap, if any have been ufed, will fwim upon the top in a coarfe film 5 and the other ingredients, being heavy, will fink to the bottom. This is the beft and molt regular method of finding the deceit: but as cucurbits, and land furnaces, are not at hand in private families, there is a more fami- liar method. “ Let the crumb of a loaf be diced, as before directed, and put it, with a great deal of water, into a large earthen pipkin. Let this be fet over a very gentle fire, and kept a long time moderately hot ; and the pap being poured eif, the bone aflies, or other ingredients, will be found at the bottom.” On WATER. IT is a long-eftabliflied obfervation, that the beft waters boil and cool again the Iqoneft; and that they evaporate in the leaft time, and with the leaft degree of heat. A well-known mark of the purity of water is its foftnefs. This quality is dilcoverable by the touch, if we only wafh our hands in it : and the dis- tinction between hard and foft water generally arifes from its difficult or eafy union with oily fubftances. J Soft water is the molt proper for the waffiing and bleaching of linen, the maxing of paper, and for molt medicinal purpofes. It mixes’ more uniform- J/ with milk, and does not curdle it, as hard waters frequently do. It boils peak and beans fofter, and mixes better with flour, rice, oatmeal, ’&c.

Hard water J,“l a fira,"'ls M a"for,s of4*«» THE LADY’S ASSISTANT' The Burton, Nottinghamfhire, Liverpool, and feveral other kind9 of ale* which are much admired, are faid to he brewed with hard water. But Dr. Mead and others condemn the ufe of thefe liquors, as productive of various diforders, and particularly the cholic. From thefe remarks we may reafonably infer, that hard water cannot fo well anfwer thepurpofes of diluting and digefting our food ; as it will not fo readily mix and unite with the different parts of it, nor aifimilatc and di- geft them properly. Befides, the large quantities of acid and nitrous falts, with the loads of felenite and calcareous earth, which thefe waters generally contain, will naturally difpofe them to form obftruCtions, when, by the courfe of circulation, thefe folid particles come into the minuteft veffels, more efpe- cially thofe of the glands. Hence they are often blamed, as laying the foundation of fcrophulous, ftrumoUs, and other glandular fwellings and ob- ItruCtions. It is from the quantity of ftony matter, which the hard waters generally contaib, that moft of them have large incruftations upon the fides of the vef- fels in which they are boiled ; and they have by fome been difapproved for this reafon, as caufing the Hone. But the calculous concretions in the blad- der and kidneys are of a very different nature from thefe incruftations ; and, as Dr. Heberden juftly obferves, “ they totally differ from all foffil ftones in every thing except the name; and the pretended experience of the effects of certain ftony waters in breeding the ftone, may, upon the belt authorities, be rejected as falfe.” The belt way of determining the hardnefs or foftnefs of water, is by fcrap- ing any certain quantity of foap into it, and obferving how it diffolves or la- thers. If water be perfectly loft, the foap will diffolve quickly, uniformly, and without curdling; and, upon fhaking theglafs brifkly, will raife a ftrong froth or lather at the top. But the fmallert: degree of hardnefs will fliew it- felf, either by the foap not diffolving fo readily, by its turning curdly and uneven, or by lefs froth remaining after it is agitated ; and the different de- grees of hardnefs may hereby be very well determined. The belt way of mak- ing this trial is with a fmall quantity of Caltile foap, viz. about a grain to an ounce of water. Rain-water. In fummer-time rain-water brings along with it the feeds and embryos of vegetables and animalcula, which render it difagreeable to the tafte, and pro- mote its putrefaction. If it be kept in wooden veffels, it will foon ftink,and become unfit for ule ; and then, if it be viewed with a microfcope, it will be found to contain an amazing number of various animalcula > and particu- larly thofe which, from their form and motion, are called the wheel ani- mals. Thefe animalcula are fuppofed to be the chief caufe of the water’s pu- trefaction. Rain-water is a little hard, when it firft falls ; but in two or three days it becomes perfectly foft. The rain, which falls through the fmoke of large towns, is rendered foul and black ; more efpecially if it be coHeCted, as it generally is, from the roofs of houfes ; when it brings with it a great many particles of foot, which, give it a very difagreeable talle and colour. Where the tiles are blackened by the fmoke of glafs-houfes, &c. the water which falls from them is unfit lor almolt any domehic purpofes.THE LADY’s ASSISTANT. 481 When rain-water fubfides, and is well filtered, it becomes perfe&Ly clear and bright. If it be kept in wooden veffels, it contrails a particular fmell, tafte, and colour from the wood. Clean earthen jars are the bell for keeping water. Though leaden cifterns may be uled with fafety, if they be kept clear from vegetable acids ; all of which are found to corrode lead, and to produce a very noxious fait. The veffels in which water is preferved fliould be covered, to prevent any dull: or filth from getting in 3 and the water will be more agreeable, if kept in a cool place. Snow-water. Some of the greateft philofophers and phyficians have differed much in their opinion of fnow-water. Hippocrates, Hoffman, and others, condemn it. But Boerhaave, on the other hand, is laviih in its encomiums. He afferts, that fnow, which is collefted from the tops of high fandy mountains, at a diftance from any towns or houfes, where it has fallen after a long fharp froft, in calm weather, and lies at a confiderable height above the furface of the earth, produces water, “ which is the pureft of all, quite immutable, ca- pable of being kept for many years, and is a lingular remedy for inflamma- tions of the eyes.” Dr. Rotheram having mentioned the efficacy of fnow-water in burns, ani in fertilizing tire ground, relates the following experiment; which, though it may appear of a trivial nature, he veryjuftly remarks, is not below the no- tice of a philofopher. “ Oneeffetf of fnow, of which I do not remember any where to have read, is, that a certain quantity of it, taken up frefh from the ground, and mixed in a flour-pudding, will fupply the place of eggs, and make it equally light. The quantity allotted is two table fpoonfuls, inftead of one egg ; and if this proportion be much exceeded, the pudding will not adhere together, but will fall to pieces in boiling. I affert this from the experience of my own. family j and any one, who choofes to try it, will find it to be a fact. Spring-water. As all our fprings are originally fupplied by rain or melted fnow, and hail, (trained through the pores and cavities of the earth, their waters will vary according to the different foils, or ftrata, through which they pafs. If waters meet with nothing in their fubterraneous'paffages, which will unite with them, or diffolve in them, they iffue out in their greateft purity. Thefprings, which come from gravel, fand, or fome light and porous ftones, are generally the pureft and bell : for the water, being filtered through their finall pores, is cleared from almoft every foreign fubftance or impurity, which it had con- tracted in the air; acquires an agreeable coolnefs, and becomes limpid, bright, and fparkling. But, as there are few foils, which do not contain fome kinds of fait, or other mineral fubftances, which are foluble in water, mod of our fprings are found to partake, in fome meafure, of the nature of the foil through which they pals; and are innocent, falutary, or noxious, in proportion to the quan- tity, kind, or mixture, of the various ingredients of which they are compof- ed ; and the conftitufion of the pcrfon who ufes them ; and fome of them are •f great medicinal efficacy. I i ✓ Stagnant-THE LADY’S assistant. 482 The Stagnant-'water. Stagnant-water in ponds and ditches is generally efteemed the worft. But large lakes, which are kept in almoft a continual agitation by the wind, do not properly come within the denomination of ftagnant waters. Pump-water, efpecially in London. It appears, from the analyfis performed by Dr. Heberden, that feveral pump-waters in London, which he had examined, and probably moft of them, contain powder of lime-ftone, and the mineral acids of vitriol, nitre, and fea-falt, united in various proportions. Thefe waters are likewife taint- ed with an oilinefs,which gives them a remarkably yellowifh call, when com- pared with pure diililled water. It is reafonable to think, that waters im- pregnated with fuch aftive fubftances, in a quantity fufficient to renderthem difagreeable to the tafte, cannot always be drank with impunity. They have accordingly been fufpefted of occafioning pains in the ftomach and bowels, glandular tumours, and coftivcnefs, where the fimple lime-done prevails ; and diarrhoeas, where much of it is united with the folution of acids ; and it is probable, that a continued ufe of fuch water may be the caufe of many other diforders, efpecially to the infirm, and to children. From whence it follows, that a change of place may often be of as much ufe to weak perfons, from the change of water, as of air. Some obfcure notion of the unwholefomenefs of pump-water induces many perfons to boil it, and let it ftand to grow cold; by which it will in- deed be made to part from moft of its unneutralized lime-ftoneand felenite; but at the fame time it will become more ftrongly impregnated with the faline matter, and therefore it will be worfe. If a fmall quantity of fait of tartar were added to the water, it would readily precipitate both the loofe lime-ftone, and likewife that which is united to the acids. Ten or fifteen grains would generally be enough for a pint; but the exaft proportion would readily be found, by continuing to add to it, by little andTittle, till it ceafed to occafion white clouds. This is an eafy way, not only of ipeeing the water from its lime-ftone, but alfo of changing the faline part into fiitre and i'al fylvii, both of which we know, by long experience, to be innocent. But the belt way of avoiding the bad effe&s of pump-water would be, not to make a conftant ufe of it; and in a place l'o well fupplied with river-water as London, there is very little necelfity to drink of the i'prings ; which, in /o large a city, befides their natural contents, mull collefl many additional im- purities from cellars, burying-grounds, common-fewers, and many other of- fenfive places, with which they undoubtedly often communicate ; fo that it is indeed a wonder, that we find this water at all tolerable, 1Thames and New-River Water. RIVER-waters partake of the properties of their fprings, and the channels through which they run ; yet, in a wonderful manner, they foon free them- felves from their impurities. The motion of the current *, the abforption of the foil, the fun and rain, have each of them a confiderable (hare in this effect. * The moft rapid rivers contain the pureft water.THE LADY’s ASSISTANT. 483 The Thames-water, efpec:ally in the neighbourhood of London, is mixed with many impure ingredients. It is faid to become offenfive in feven or eight days, or fometimes fooner, if it be kept in unfeafoned cafks. In this Hate it generates a quantity of foul inflammable air, as may be feenby holding the flame of a candle to the bung-hole of a calk, when it is firft opened. But by this fermentation it foon purifies itfelf; and by opening the bung, it will often become lweet in twenty-four hours, and looner if it be poured from one veffel to another, or ventilated. Methods by which Water may be obtained in its great eft Purity. AS it appears, that almoft all the water ufed in cookery is tainted with im- pure ingredients ; rain-water, with a great variety of volatile bodies, fuligi- nous particles, exhalations, invifible feeds, and infefls ; river, pond, and well- water, with a mixture of foil and mud, decayed vegetables, and the fpawn. of vermin ; it will be very proper to purify it, before it is ufed for drinking, or any kitchen purpofe. This maybe done by various contrivances, 1. The wat,er of the Thames, and that of the New River, are very often muddy, or tafte ftrongly of weeds and leaves. Dr. Heberden acknowledges, that the latter fault cannot eafily be remedied ; but, he obferves, they would foon be freed from their muddinefs, if kept fome time in an open jar : and he is of opinion, that if the water given to very young children were thus purified, it might prevent fome of their bowel-diforders, and fo contribute a little to lefi'en that amazing mortality among the children which are nurf- edin London. 2. Rain-water, when grown putrid, may be eafily rendered wholefome again, and may be drank without being offenfive, by only boiling it a few moments : for by this expedient the animals that are in it will be deftroyed, and, with the reft of the impurities, will fubfide to the bottom. If then you make it moderately acid, by adding to it a fmall quantity of acid that is very ftrong, it will be fit for ufe. This is found to be of excellent fer- vice under the equator, and between the tropics, where the waters putrify , in a horrible manner, and breed a multitudeef infefits, and yetmuft be drank. For the fame reafon, a fmall quantity of fpirit of vitriol, mixed with water, will prevent its growing putrid, and breeding any animals, and, at the fame time, preferve it wholefome and good. 3. A common way of purifying water is by filtration. Water, which is fil- trated through porous ftones, is extremely clear and limpid ; but fome wri- ters have aflerted, that it acquires a petrifying quality in its paflage, which, at length, may produce dilagreeable effefts. However this may be, thefe ftones are too dear for common ufe. Dr. Rotheram aflerts, that one of the readied and beft methods of filtering water, is, to let it run through a bed of clean land. This is, he fays, pre'l ferable to the filtering-ftone, as it performs its work much former; and the grains of far.d are of To many different figures, that they are pretty fure to ftop the progrefs of any bodies of fenfible bulk in palling through them. “ A friend of mine,” fays the Doftor, “ in this town [Newcaftle] hasacif- tern for collecting rain-water fo conftrufled, that it both allows the water to fubfide, and the upper part of it to run through a bed of fand, which is railed by a partition above the bottom of theciftern ; by which means the water be- comes perfectly clear and bright, and is preferred, by moft who have tailed it, to any other v/ater in this town.” I i z +. Som*484 THE LADY’s ASSISTANT. 4.. Some have objeSted, but probably without rcafon, to this mode of fil- tration, on a prefumption that the fand has the fame effect on the water as the filtering-ftone: for it is faid, that the fand is infenfibly diffolved by the water$ fo that in four or five years it will have loft a fifth part of its weight. M. Amy therefore recommends the filtration of water through a fpunge, more or lefs comprefled. And this, he allures us, will render it, not only more clear, but more wholefome, than either a ftone or fand. 5. As the pureft of all water is obtained by diftillation. Dr. Heberden re- commends this method, as particularly ul’efu! where fuel is cheap and the water is bad ; as it is in fome of our foreign fettlements. The firft running of diftilled water has a difagreeable mufty tafte : on this account, if the ftili hold twenty gallons it will be neceflary to throw away the firft gallon. The reft, though free from this muftinefs, will have a difa- greeable empyreumatic or burnt tafte. This tafte goes off by keeping about a month, by ventilation, in a few minutes, or by boiling the water in an open veflel. Diftilled water muft be kept in perfe&ly clean glafs or ftone bottles, with glafs ftoppers, or metal covers; and then, having in it no principle of corruption, it is incapable of being fpoiled, and will keep juft the fame for ever. But the leaft particle of any animal or vegetable fubftance, will fpoil a great quantity; and therefore the ftili and bottles ftiould be kept wholly for this ufe. This procefs, though certainly attended with many good effefts, requires too much time and attention for common ufe ; and therefoie, in general, it may be fufficient to adopt the mode of filtration, recommended by Dr. Rothe- raip, or that which is propofed by M. Amy. Thefe obfervations are not new, they have been communicated to the pub- lic by others. They are difperfed through many different publications. T have therefore thrown them into a final 1 compafs. And I flatter myfelf, that in a book of Cookery they may be acceptable to the public ; as many of the foregoing articles are of infinite importance to the health, find eonfi** quently to the happineCt, of mahkind. 1 N D E> X,N D E X.

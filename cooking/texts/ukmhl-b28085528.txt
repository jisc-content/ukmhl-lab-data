Amid tlie numerbus books, to which the names of well- known professors of the culinary art are attached, it may appear in some degree presumptuous in one unknown, to present to the Public her ‘ Cre-fydd’s Family Fare. The Authoress would not have been thus daring had she not ascertained by her own experience, as well as that of many friends, that whatever the other merits of previous works on the subjects of cookery and household manage- ment, they are not practically available for the moderate and economical, yet reasonably luxurious, housekeeper, or for those who are young or who are inexperienced in those matters. In those works there is no lack of receipts, maxims, and ‘ directions to the cook;„’ but in general, when tested by a moderate cook, or directed by an inexperienced person, failure and disappointment are the result. Let any young housewife in moderate circumstances (and we cannot all afford to invoke the shade of Ude, or have Francatelli at our elbow) answer whether, when she has put the newly-purchased cookery-book into the hands of her cook, she has not been ultimately disappointed. Not from excessive fastidiousness on her part, or from the want of goodwill in the cook, but because, in the majority ofX PREFACE. instances, the receipts and directions are only suited to those cooks who are well informed, and have had considerable practice (see note, p. xi.). They are often the result of theo- retical ingenuity, or the productions of those who know, hut who cannot impart their knowledge to the uninformed. Theory and practice must be combined; and that com- bination put forth in such language, that while the lady will not object to read, the cook will be able to understand. The Authoress of the present work has, from various motives, sought opportunities, and from peculiar circum- stances found them, of acquiring the receipts it contains. They are not all new to the Public, though many of them are, but they have all this recommendation — that they have been tested, and served on the table of the Authoress, under her direct supervision. Those dishes have past the ordeal of fastidious and almost morbidly critical palates, and have come forth with ap- proval. The materials suggested are reasonably econo- mical, the quantities exact, and the directions plain. The words ‘reasonably economical’ are used advisedly, as it would be insulting to the understanding of sensible persons to state that inferior materials can be formed into superior dishes. In addition to the receipts on cooker}', the Authoress has introduced a variety of other receipts and suggestions for the management of a house and ser- vants. With regard to servants, it may be observed that many of them would be much better for the gentle but firm directions of a kind mistress Experienced and skilful servants need no direction ; but such are not always to be found; and when found, the rate of wages required by them would not be suitable to persons with a moderate income. A mistress, under such circumstances, if she would haveXI PREFACE. a comfortable establishment, must be able, in some degree, to instruct her servants; without this, it is impossible that they, who have but little experience, can know the wants incident to a respectable family. The necessity of doing what she advises, has been forced on the Authoress during a long life of much experience. In order to moderate, in some degree, the diflSculty of managing a household, these suggestions are made. If the Authoress has aided the young housewife, and smoothed the way in the difficulties of housekeeping, and in that essential to health and comfort, good cooking, her object has been attained. It will be observed that the quantity of every ingredient used is carefully given, as well as the exact time required in cooking. Each receipt is perfect in itself, for it is found that reference to other receipts is, to the inexperienced, extremely perplexing. French terms are avoided. It is right to add that the whole of the receipts have been successfully used, with the simple aid of an ordinary range, and the usual appliances found in the kitchen of a small establishment. NOTE. The following extracts from modern and much-praised cookery-books, in our own language, as well as French, Italian, and Gierman, will fully justify the remark in the text:— ‘lamb cutlets a la princesse. ‘ Trim and fry the cutlets in the usual manner ; and when be- come partially cold, dip each cutlet up to the bone in some stiffly-Xll PREFACE. reduced Allemande sauce, strongly flavoured with mushrooms; each cutlet as it is dipped to be afterwards placed flat on a baking- sheet upon rough ice, to set the same quite firm on the cutlets; they are then to be egged, crumbed, fried in hot lard, and, being dished up, are to be garnished ■with a puree of green asj;aragus, or asparagus peas, and some supreme or any other ■white sauce poured round the base.’—Francatelli’s Cook's Guide. ‘SHOULDERS OF TEAL, STUFFED. ‘ Take the joint and lay it with the skin side downwards ; with a sharp thin knife carefully detach the meat from the bladebone; then hold the shoulder edgewise, and detach the. meat fi-om the other side of the bone, being careful not to make a hole in the skin ; then cut the bone from the knuckle and take it out. You may at first be rather awkward aboitt it, but after once or twice trying it will become easy; you may also take out the other bone, but I prefer it in, as it keeps the shape better; then lard the lean part like the neck (in No. 320); mix some salt and a little mixed spice together, with Avhich rub the meat from Avhence the bone has been cut, stuff Avith veal stuffing, or sausage-meat, or suet jHidding ; braise, garnish, and serve (as No. 303). This being the toughest pm-t of the veal, it should be tried before taking up, to see if it is properly done, by thrusting a larding needle in it. If it goes in easily, it is done. This joint is excel- lent cold, and should be carved in thin slices crossAvi.se.’—Soyer s Modern Housewife. ‘ POULETS. ‘ Set the foAAds for one hour in cold Avater, then they are to bo plain boiled. For the sauce, use a pint and a half of bechamelle and a teaspoonful of Avhite sauce ; reduce it to a pint; put into it equal quantities of mushrooms and truffles, and pieces of quenelle the size of a nut; leave it in the bain-marie to keep Avarm, and remain till Avanted. Serve the sauce in a tureen, to be put on each plate by the carA^er.’—The Lady s Guide. ‘ HARICOT HUTTON. ‘ This dish is nothing more than mutton chops broAvued in flie frying pan, and then stcAved in just enough Avater to cover tlicm,XIU PBEFACE. Fate una buona gelatina come al No. 7, aggiungendo la cottura with pieces of onion, carrot and turnip (also browned), cut into dice, and placed upon them, flavoured with mushroom or walnut catsup, tomato or Eeading sauce, and served with a slice or two of pickled gherkin.’—The Dinner Question. ‘BEEF PALATES. ‘ Simmer them in water several hours, till thej'^ will peel; then cut the palates into slices, or leave them whole, as you choose, and stew them in a rich gravy till as tender as possible. Before you serve, season them Avith cayenne, salt, and ketchup. If the gravy Avas draAvn clear, add also some butter and flour. If to be served Avhite, boil them in milk, and steAv them in a fi-icassee sauce, adding cream, butter, flour, and mushroom-powder, and a little pounded mace.’—Mrs Eundell’s Domestic Cookery. ‘ TETE DE VEAU EN TOBTUE. ‘ Apres avoir fait blanchir et bouillir la tete do veau, a'ous la deso.ssez entierement et la coupez en morceaux. Vous dentolez I'orcille pour mettre en haut et couronner votre plat, et vous la faites cuire comme pour manger au naturel, avec neanmoins un peu de vin blanc. Pendant qu’elle cuit, vous disposez votre ragoflt. Vous faites un roux que vous mouillez de bouillon. Vous y ajoutez des cretes de coq,rognons, champignons, quenelles, ris de veau, foies de volaille.s, bouquet de persil, bem-re, sel, piment, vin de Madere, avec jaunes d’ceufs durcis, la langue et la cervelle. Les morceaux de la tete ^tant bien egouttes, vous les dressez en pyramide, vous versez votre sauce et A’-os garnitures dessus, et vous gamissez votre plat d'ecrevisse et de croCitons frits.’—La Bonne et Parfaite Cuisiniere. ‘IKSALATA DI YITELLO CON SALSA TABTABA. (In un bordo di Gelatina.) ‘ Fate cuocere G ettogrammi di coscia di vitello ben niortificata, in un tegame, con un po’ di cipolla, carota, e prezzemolo, nettati e tagliate, un po’ di butirro, una fetta di lardo; fatela rosolare un poco, bagnatela con un po’d’ acqua, ed aceto, sale, 2 garofani; fatela cuocere fmche e tenera; raffi eddata, ponetela sopra un piatto.XIV PREFACE. della coscia, fatte ben chiara; empite uno stampo a bordura; fatela congelare ferma, rinversata sul piatto; mettete un poco d’insalata trita nel mezzo, miscliiata con un po’d’ olio; quindi tagliate la came a fette sottilissimi, disponetela sull’insalata, rico- perta ben liscia con salsa tartara spessa (No. 54); impiantate sopra il bianco d’ una lattuga ben netta, e guemita all’ intomo di lattuglie e servitela di bella figura.’—Trattato di Cucina Moderna di Vialardi Giovanni, Aiutante capo cuoco del Ee di Sardegna. ‘BEIGNETS VON UBEIGGELIEBENEM FISCH. ‘ Man macbt eine Farce von einem Stuck zerriilirter Butter etwas Muskatnuss und Salz, einigen Eiem, Zitronenscbale, geriebenem Weissbrod und dem von’iitbigen, fein gehackten Fiscb, formt davon fingerlange und zweifingerbreite Stuckchen, Aviilzt sie in Ey und gestoszenem Zwieback, worunter man Parmesan, oder HoUiindiscben Ktise mischen kann, imd brat sie in Butter, bellbraun.

They are, however, so arranged, that by a proportionate addition of quantity, they will serve for four or six persons; and those who may consider them too much for two, will have a choice of dishes to select from. If the bills of fare be followed in succession, it win be seen that everything is disposed of, as nearly as can be, without being acquainted with the appetites and habits of the consumers. The puddings may be found too large, but they can easily be reduced, as the exact quantities are given in each receipt. The price of fish varies considerably, consequently it should be chosen according to the market of the day. The fish for family fare should not exceed the prices in the subjoined list. Those prices, and all others, as well as the calculation of house- keeping expenses {see Hints to Mistresses), will only be a guide to residents in London or the suburbs, and even there they will vary in dififerent districts. It must be remarked that the bills of Family Fare are made out for the present year, 1864 ; the Sundays and Movable Fasts and Feasts are marked, consequently they may be regulated to serve for any year.

In writing receipts, it is impossible to give in each, every detail; it must therefore be rmderstood that ‘ a spoonful,’ whether table, dessert, tea, or saltspoon, be used, means a spoon of the ordinary- size for kitchen use, filled, but not piled. The same observation applies to cups and glasses. When carrots, turnips, celery, onions, mushrooms, potatoes, lemons, &c., are ordered without specification, the medium size must be understood; ‘ pepper,’ either kind ; ‘ mustard,’ made or w?i-made ; ‘ dry flour,’ dried, but not haked; ‘ dried crumbs,’ bread prepared as directed; ‘ water,’ cold. K these remarks be remembered, no difficulty can arise, as in all cases where detail is necessary, it is given in the receipt. Kitchen Utensils.—Exti-eme cleanliness is indispensable to good cooking. Pots, stervpans, saucepans, fryingpans, and every other utensil, must be kept bright inside. Each time they are used, they should be well washed with hot water, scoured rvith silrer sand and a wisp of hay (which should always be at hand), rinsed and dried before putting them away. Soda should not be used, as it soon destroys the tinning of. the vessels. Pudding-cloths, jelly-bags, and sieves should be washed several times in very hot water, without soap or soda, and dried in the open air. Paste- slabs, rolhng-pin, moulds, earthen pans, and the lids, tables, &c., must be kept scrupulously clean. The Oven.—The oven requires attention both in cleansing and heating, or it will not work satisfactorily. It should be swept and weU rubbed with a wet cloth every morning. l\Iore or less fire must be applied to obtain the degree of heat required, which may be ascertained by putting in a piece of stale crumb of bread.EE5IABKS AND DIRECTIONS TO BE REMEMBERED. clvii and shutting the door for ten minutes. If the heat be great, it •\vill be baked brown; if moderate, slightly browned; and if gentle, yellow. Fire for Roasting.—The ashes should be well cleared out before making up the fire for roasting. Poultry, game, or joints imder twelve pounds weight, require a fire nineteen inches wide and fifteen inches high. It should be burnt through, and the screen and dripping-pan placed before it, to get hot, before the joint is put down to roast. Roasting.—The joint should be hung close to the fire (^four inches from the bars'), for the first quarter of an hour, unless otherwise directed in the receipts, and then drawn to a distance {twelve inches from the bars) till done. This process sets the juice in the meat, and much improves the flavour. Boiling.—Great care is required in boiling. Except where otherwise directed, the joint should be put into sufficient cold water to cover it, boiled up guichly, then simmered till done ; that is to say, the water must be kept at boiling heat, but must not be permitted to bubble, or to wave perceptibly. This process causes the meat to swell, renders it tender and juicy ; while boiling will cause the meat to shrink from the bone, and render it hard and dry. I Braising.—This word means to cook meat, poultry, &c. by the appliance of very gentle heat, and with little or no liquid. The process is much longer than ordinary stewing, or than boiling, consequently simmering must be attended to. Steaming.—An ordinary steamer may be used in aU cases where steaming is ordered ; the saucepan under it must be full of water, and boil fast all the time ; or for puddings a pint pie- dish may be tmmed upside down in a saucepan with three pints of boiling water in it, and the pudding placed upon that. Plates and Dishes should be washed in plenty of hot water (without soda), rinsed in cold water, then drained till dry. When sent to table, they should be hot, but not so much so as to be disagreeable. The bottom of the dishes should be care- fully wiped. Sen'ing, Whether about to serve immediately, or if the dinnerclviii EEMABKS AND DIRECTIONS TO BE RE5IE5IBERED. be unavoidably delayed, everything should be taken up at the moment it is done. Boiled fish, poultry, or joints should be covered with a hot cloth, and kept over the steam, but not over the fire. Three minutes before sending to table put them into the water and boil up. Lay roast poultry or joints in the dripping-pan, and protect them from the fire by a dish ; put them into a hot oven, or rehang before the fire, for five or ten minutes before serving. Fish may be re-fi:ied. Potatoes may be mashed and browned, and other vegetables may be thrown into fast-boiling water for three or four minutes; thus a dinner need never be spoiled by a little delay. The dinner should be sent to table covered by hot covers, which should be scrupulously clean and highly polished inside and out. Pastry and puddings are better not covered, as the steam makes them heavy and spoils their appearance. Second Dressing.—The various dishes arranged firom cold fish, meat, poultry and game come under this denomination. Clearing Soup.—Fast boiling, uncovered, is the best way of clearing soup, but it sometimes fails; in this case, throw in the whites of three or four fresh eggs, and whisk it briskly for ten minutes while boiling fast; then take it off the fire, let it settle for ten minutes. Strain carefully. Sieves and Jelly hags.—Hair or tammy sieves and jeUy bags must be put into very hot water for five minutes, then dipped into cold wafer before using. The bags must be wrung out as hot as possible; attending to this will render the straining process more effectual. Moulds.—Moulds must be dipped into cold water before putting either jelly or cream into them ; and when about to turn out the contents, they must be quickly dipped into hot w'ater and wiped dry. Baked Flour.—Put one pound of fine flour into a soup plate, and bake in a cool oven till it is quite dry, but not coloured; when cold, pound it and put it into a glass jar; tie it over with paper, and keep for use, as directed in the receipts. Bake another pound in a quick oven till of a pale brown colour. M hen cold, pound it; put it into a jar, aud use when directed. Baked flourEEMARKS AND DIRECTIONS TO BE REMEMBERED. clix is an essential to good cooking, and tlie cook should never be without it. Dried or prepared Crumbs.—Put some bread on a sheet of paper, place it in a cool oven, and let it remain till perfectly dried through. Divide the crust and brown part from the crumb, and pound them separately till in veiy fine powder. Put them into jars, and keep them in a dry place. The white crumbs are to be used for sweetbreads, cutlets, fried fish, puddings, &c. The brown crumbs are to be used for hams, bacon, coloruring broth, &c. Any pieces of bread there may be, should be baked daily, as the bread should not be stale, and pounded twice or thrice a week. Burnt Sugar, for colouring Soups, ^c.—Put a quarter of a poimd of sifted loaf sugar into a small iron saucepan (untinned), and place it over the fire to bake, till it becomes black, but not crisp, like a cinder; add a pint of water, and simmer till the sugar dissolves, and the water is reduced to half a pint. Strain through a cloth, and when cold, bottle and keep for use. Great care is required in colouring, not to put too much, or it will spoil what it is intended to improve, both in appearance and flavour. It must be used by drops till the desired effect is attained. Black Onions, for Soups, ^c.—Peel six large^onions, and place them on a tin dish. Knead together a quarter of a pound of salt butter and a quarter of a pound of moist sugar; divide it, into six equal parts, and place one on each onion. Put them into a slow oven, and bake till they are black through, but not burnt cri.sp. Baste them fi’equently with the liquor. When done, put them into a pie-dish, and keep for use. These onions give a finer colour to soup and gravy than anything else; they also impart a good flavour. Weights and Measures.—As the same weights and measures are not used everywhere, it is necessary to state that those re- ferred to in this book are avoirdupois, i. e. sixteen ounces to the pound, and imperial, i.e. twenty liquid oimces to the pint. Sieves vary even in London, therefore by a sieve must be imder- stood fourteen dry quarts. Seasoning.—The over use of seasoning will spoil every otherclx REMARKS AND DIRECTIONS TO BE REMEMBERED. flavour, "while the moderate use brings it out and improves the dish. Great care has been taken in stating the quantities to be used, and they should be strictly adhered to. lilany persons object to all condiments, "while others like them profusely em- ployed. This can only be ascertained by the cook at first follow- ing the receipts, and then, if alteration be necessary, decrease or increase the quantities to suit the palates she cooks for. The nutmegs referred to in the different receipts must not weigh more than the sixth of an ounce, or if they be larger, less in proportion must be used. By a grain is meant the sixtieth part of a drachm; and of most things a cayenne-spoonful will be equal to a grain. A drachm is the eighth part of an ounce ; and of many things a teaspoonful is equal to a drachm. Garlic.—Garlic must be used very carefully, or it will spoil what it is intended to improve. Strict attention, therefore, must be paid to the directions contained in each receipt when this vegetable is used. Condiment Sauces.—Ketchup and other condiment sauces must be used in moderation. Cre-fydd’s* casureep "wiU be found to be a convenient* sauce, as no other condiment nor "wine need be added when it is used. It imparts an agreeable flavour to aU brown soups and made dishes. * See Notice foUo"wing Index.CRE-FYDD’S FAMILY FARE. ■o SOUPS, BROTHS, ETC. 1. STOCK, Yo. 1. (Four quarts.)

A gill of good vinegar in a pint of cold water, a large camel’s hair brush (a shaving brush will do), and clean soft cloths. The frame must be perfectly free from dust. Dip the brush into the liquid, and squeeze ft slightly, that it may not be too wet; brush the gilding (a small piece at a time) lightly, up and down, till it is quite restored. The brush must be constantly washed; and in finishing, it should be squeezed dry, and the gilding brushed till dry. Frames and other gilt articles should be dusted daily ■with a soft brush, and never touched with a cloth. By observing this, and cleaning every two years, covering will be found quite unnecessary, and the gilding will always be in good order. The liquid must be renewed when dirty. 982. PASTE FOE CLEANING PLATE. Break up two cakes of whiting into three pints of cold water, stir it well, so as to wash out all the grit, then let it stand till it settles to the bottom ; pour off the water, and put the whiting into the oven to dry. Scrape off the sandy sediment. Dissolve three-quarters of a pmmd of soft soap ; mix half of the whiting into it; add three-quarters of a giU of spirit of wine; stir till in a soft paste, then put it into covered pots; the rest of the whiting to be kept in a lump for polishing. \ 983. TO CLEAN PLATE. The plate should be well washed in hot water {without soda). Dip a piece of soft flannel into cold water, then into the paste {see foregoing receipt); rub till all tarnish disappears ; wipe off’ the past with a .soft cloth, then polish with wash-leather and dry prepared whiting. Brush the carved edges and between the prongs of the forks; finish with a clean wash-leather. If plate be cleaned thus once a fortnight, and rubbed daily, it will always be in beautiful order. 984.

Ivory, mother of pearl, and tortoise-shell-backed brushes should never be put into water ; they should be cleaned Avith pipeclay. Hub the pipeclay welLover the bristles till the brush is full, then rub one brush against another till the pipeclay is all out; then rub the brushes Avith a clean cloth. 988. TO WASH SILK STOCKINGS. Wash silk stockings in cold Avater and Avith white soap: rinse them in cold Avater; lay them flat in a fine toAvel, roll it up tightly, and let them remain till dry; then rub them Avith a piece of dry flannel, to give them a gloss. As they must not be left in the Avater, it is better to wash one pair at a time. Silk stockings Avashed in this Avay will ahvays look ncAV, and ncA’^er require colouring or mangling. 989. HINTS TO THE MISTRESS. It is generally unAvise to take serA'ants from a po.sition inferior to that they are expected to fill. When engaging them, their duties should be described, and not made to seem less than they are. In taking the character, questions should be put as to the morals, habits, cleanliness, capability, and health of the servant; and there should be no hesitation or prevarication in the ansAvers. At the same time, it is necessary to observe the stylo and order of the house from Avhich the chiu-acter is taken, and also of the person giving it. It Avill be found a good plan to Avrite doAvn the daily Avork of each servant, and the hours for doing it, as avcU as the days on Avhich extra cleaning is to be done. The hours for rising, meals, retiring, and all matters on Avhich order and comfort depend, should also be Avritten doAvn.321 DINTS TO THE MISTRESS. STORES. The Hints to Servants will serve as a foundation to this plan, as it is impossible to lay down positive rules for every family. The merit or demerit of servants should never be made the subject of conversation. Servants should be forbidden to relate what they hear of neighbours and friends. Firmness, kindness, and punc- tuality in all relations between mistress and servant, will encourage obedience and respect. The kitchen and larder should be visited daily by the mistress; and every room in the house should be inspected by her, at least once a week. Great comfort will be found in the regular system of writing ‘ bills of fare; ’ they ensure the dinner ordered being served, and act as a check to tradesmen’s books. They should be kept, and at the end of the week com- pared with the books. Errors are then easil}' detected. Keceipts should be filed, and kept at least one year. A strict account of expenditure, with date of payment, should be kept; it is always satisfactory, and often useful as a reference to correct mistakes. The .subjoined outline of a month’s housekeeping expenses for four persons may in some degree guide the young housewife. The calculation is made on the prices of the best London trades- men of the present period (1863), and admits of the ‘ bills of fare’ being followed. The amount will frequently vary; but at the end of the year it will be found a tolerably accurate estimate on which diminution or increase may be made. The calculation admits of an occasional visitor.

Regularity should be observed in giving out stores, whether it be done daily or weeldy. The following prac- tical observations may be useful, and may be depended on as correct: — Twenty-eight teaspoonfiils of tea are equal to a quarter of a pound; thirty-two moderate-sized lumps of sugar (about three-quarters of an inch square) are equal to half a pmmd. Tea, to be good, requires three teaspoonfuls to the breakfast-cup ; coffee, one ounce to the coffee-cup; composite candles, eight to the pound for bedroom use, burn four horns and a half. These minute details are intended to aid the inexperienced housewife in giving out the right quantities, according to the taste and habits of the consumers, and will be found useful if weights and scales are not at hand. Kitchen stores must depend on the use there is for them. Each seiwant requires, for personal use and cleaning purposes, three-quarters of a pound of • soap a fortnight. All other stores are regulated by the receipts, as each contains the exact quantity required. A moderator lamp of good size, always in use, in the course of a year consumes fourteen gallons of the best oil, if burnt till eleven or hall-past. Coals should be laid inKITCHEN STORES.

Stores for the week :—Baked flour, dried or prepared crumbs of bread, garlic, shalots, onions, black onions (see receipt), burnt sugar, stock, glaze, salt, mustard, pepper, cayenne, all kinds of spice, dried herbs, vinegar, oil, string, pud ding-cloths, paper for roasting, paper for fried fish, &c.; fish napkins, plenty of clean towels, oatmeal, groats, flour, split peas, which must be kept in w'ood, dripping, lard, butter, eggs, &c. &c. A cook shoifld always have the foregoing articles in readiness. She should also have •weights and scales at hand ; hammer, nails, screw-driver, pincers, &c. &c. 992. HINTS TO SERVANTS. In small establishments, where only two house servants are kept, the ■work is generally divided thus:—The cook takes the dining-room, library, hall, steps, kitchen stairs, kitchen, larder, and all offices below; the housemaid, all above the hall, her p.antry, plate, china, and glass. Early rising will be found to add much to the comfort both of employers and servants. The work should be arranged in such a Avay that each day brings the same amount of labour. Every room and office should be thoroughly cleaned once a week, and a day set apart for each. On those occa.sions, windows and sills should be cleaned, curtains brushed, and marks taken off paint. In bedrooms, mattresses and beds beaten and brushed, and the boards under the bed scrubbed. By doing this, the house is always clean, and with Amry little labour. Both servants should be clean and neat in their Avork. Things to he Remeinhered. — Answer bells immediately. Be careful not to drop lucifers about the house ; never strike them on the Avail. Shut windows in foggy Aveather. Be careful to fasten all doors and AvindoAvs at night. ■ Do not let strangers into the house. Do not put jJate A\’here it can be seen by passers-by. Should any unpleasant smell ari.se from sink or other drains, throwA FEW THINGS WOKTH KNOW'ING. 324 down a handful of chloride of lime, and let the water run. Never throw greenswater down drains ; let it get cold, then throw it on the earth in the garden. Burn all vegetable matter, or send it away ; if it be put into the dust-bin, it decays, and an unwholesome smell arises; put nothing into the dust-bin but ashes. Do not throw human hair down drains or W. C.; bum it. Do not throw bones into cellars or elsewhere, as they cause a bad smell. If kept for the purpose of selling, the precaution must be taken to boil them till quite bare, wash them in hot water, and dry them on the hearth; if not, bum them. Keep all firesides neat, and let each fire bum up the cinders it makes. Avoid putting things on the stairs or landings. Let ever^'thing have a place. Shut doors after you, bg the handle, so as not to mark the paint. Use a fireside cloth and a housemaid's box for upstairs firesides. Always have a clean cloth expressly kept for chamber use. AVash out all utensils before wiping them. Put fresh water into jugs and bottles daily. AA’ear a large apron for bedmaking. Bedsteads should be taken down in spring and autumn, the woodwork and joints scrubbed, and the whole well cleansed; the fui-niture brushed, and cleaned with bread, or washed. Carpets are kept in nice order by cleaning them once a year Avith bread. Never use dirty brooms, brushes, or dusters. AVear gloves in aU dirty Avork. After cleaning fire-ii'ons and coal-scuttles (wliich should be daily in the Avinter), Avipe them Avith a cloth, so that they may not soil the hands Avhen used. Never dust gilt fi-ames Avith anything but a soft brush. Careful daily dusting preserves the furniture, and makes a house alAA'ays look clean. Never put a tablecloth on the table with a spot on it. AVhen there are any marks, lay the cloth on a clean table, dip a piece of flannel into hot Avater, and rub them till they dis- appear ; then fold the cloth smoothly, and put it into the press ; frequent Avashing Avears out the cloths, and accidents Avill occur daily. Do not use soda, excejAt for lamp and gas globes, other gi'ound-glass, and rough kitchen Avork. Do not let Avorkmen go upstairs in their thick dirty shoes. A pair of carpet-slippers or a pair of India-rubber overshoes should be kept for the purjwse. Lay doAvn cloths Avhere they are at AA'ork, if on a carpet. A\ hen rooms are SAvept, cover beds, sofas, &c. Avith sheets; old sheets should be kept for dusting-sheets. Never use kitchen-clothsHINTS TO SERVANTS. 325 dusters, &c. but for what they are intended ; and do not put them, away wet, as they cause a fusty smell, and will become mildewed. Render a strict account of all money expended for your em- ployers. Chimneys.—The kitchen chimney should be swept every five weeks. The discomfort on those occasions may be much lessened by arranging the hour according to the habits of the family. The ‘ upstairs work ’ should be done before the sweep aixives, and that should be one hour before the family breakfast. A fire should be lighted elsewhere; and after sending up the breakfast, the cook can remain in the kitchen till the cleaning is finished. Other chimneys are generally swept once a year (in May) ; but the dining-room, if constantly used, will require sweeping in December also. To Clean Varnished Paper Walls.—Wring a soil linen cloth out of very hot water (ivithoid either soap or soda), and rub the w'all quickly (a small piece at the time) ; wipe it dry, and polish with a clean soft wash-leather. Cisterns.—The Avater shoirld be drawn off once a fortnight, and the cisterns should be cleaned out three times a year or ofteuer. Filter.—The sponges should be washed in two or three Avaters, and the filter should be Avell rinsed out once a Aveek. Decanters.— Decanters and Avater-bottles should be cleaned with tea leaves and a bottle bnish, and Avell rinsed Avith cold Avater, then turned upside doAvn to drain. Be carefi.il never to use soda, or any acid, it makes them look thick, cloudy, and white, instead of clear and brilliant. China and Glass. Tavo clean tubs should be kept expressly for china and glass. Wash it Avell in Avarm Avater, and rinse in plenty of cold, and Avipe Avith clean soft cloths. Be careful to keep the handles of cup.s and jugs clean. To take off tea stains use a little silver .sjind, or .salt, but never .soda. Tea Urns.—When about to send the urn to table, nearly fill it Avkh fast boiling water, put on the circular shelf, put in the heater, Avhich must be quite red hot, put the small lid over it, put on the lid of the urn, and rub it quickly over Avith a Avash- leather, that there may be no du.st upon it. When taken aAvay, take out the heater, draAv off the Avater, Avipe the inside quite dry, and polish the outside Avith a AA’a.sh-leather.326 A FEW TillNGS WORTir KNOWING. Tea-Pots,—Tea will not be good unless the inside of the tea- pot be kept bright. After use, the leaves should be taken out immediately, the pot well rinsed with boiling water, and wiped quite dry. Once a week it should be scrubbed with fine salt; the spout cleaned with a piece of whalebone, and the holes cleared out with a small skewer. Gas.—The gas should be turned off at every burner before it is turned off at the meter. The gasliers should be dusted with a brush every day, and the globes washed every week, ■i^^len the meter and gasliers are hydraulic, it is better to fill them up with water on the same day every week ; this wiU effectually prevent mistakes. Larnj)S.—The oil, cottons, and aU things used for lamps, must be kept in a warm dry place. The oil must be closely corked. Lamps should be trimmed at once, when removed from the table; they can then never be forgotten. Cut the. wick close to the burner, and quite even; be careful not to drop it into the lamp. Fill the lamp with oil, within an inch of the top. "Wipe the moutli of the lamp, the knobs, and the chimney holder; clean the chimney with a stick covered with wash-leather and a little rotten-stone; dust the foot of the lamp, and put on the glasses; care should be taken not to touch the ground side of the globe, as it would leave finger marks on it; once a month generally is enough to wash the globe; it must be perfectly dry before it is put on. Wind up the lamp ten minutes before lighting; turn up the cotton the third of an inch; light it all round -with a wax lighter; put on the chimney; the shoulder of the chimney should be half an inch above the flame; when regulated put on the globe. The cotton must be changed every four days. These directions are given for a ‘ Moderator Lamp.’ Candles.—Candlesticks should be cleaned every morning. In fixing candles, cross two pieces of paper (two inches and a half long) over the socket, and force the candle in; they will then be perfectly upright and steady, and the paper not seen. If ciindles gutter, scrape off the waste. Clocks.—Wind up clocks regularly; never turn the hands back to alter the time.327 CARYING. « 993. HINTS ON CAEVING.

A sharp knife should be used. Turbot and Brill.—Run the fish-knife along the middle of the fish, from head to tail; then cut the sides into pieces two inches broad. Serve a portion of the fin to each person. The white side of the fish is the best, and the thick part is the most esteemed. John Dory and large Tor Bay Soles may be carved hke as turbot, &c. The cheek of the dory is the epicure’s piece.

Ley.—Make an incision through the thick part of the leg, and help slices from both sides; or it may be carved ‘ haunch fashion.’ Loin may be either carved as the saddle or cut into chops. Shoulder is cut through the straight or lean side. Lamb fore-qUarter.—The shoulder should be taken off by the cook, but replaced to send to table; or if not taken off by the cook, must be taken off by the carver, and placed on a separate di.sh. Carve lamb as directed for mutton. Beef.—The underside of the sirloin should be cut across the bones into slices the third of an inch thick. The upper side, lengthways, and in slices the fifth of an inch thick. A little fat and gravy sent on each plate. mbs should be carved lengthways and cut thin. Aitchbone.—Cut from the narrow and fat side and in as thinA KKW THTAGS WORTU KXOAVIXG. 328 slices as possible. The suet fat is lD?st when hot. All salt beef should bo cut thin. Veal.—The fillet must be cut from the round part in verj' thin ■ slices; stuffing and gravy should be served to each person. Loin., neck, and chump end of loin should be cut into slices the sixth of an inch thick. Pork.—Cut the leg through the middle, close to the bone. Serve slices a quarter of an inch thick. If stuffed, send stuffing and gravy on each plate. A boiled leg of pork, and all other parts salted, should bo cut the sixth of an inch thick. Ham should be cut as thin as possible, unless cooked in tlie Spanish way, Avhen the slices should be a quarter of an inch thick. In either case, place the knife three inches above the knuckle, which should be to your left hand, slanting toward the knuckle ; cut off the piece down to the knuckle; then carve the ham in very thin slices, flit and lean. A ham cut in this way looks better and goes farther than when cut as a leg of pork, as it often improperly is. Bacon must always be cut thin. . Tongue.—Cut the thick part of the tongue doum to the root, but not through, and seiwe slices a quai-ter of an inch t hick. Bath Chap.—Cut very thin slices from the thick part of the chap lengthways. A small piece of the tongue, if any, should be sent to each person. Fowls.—Fix the fork in the middle of the breast, and do not remove it till the fowl is cut up. First take off the legs thus : Place the point of the knife flat under the thigh, eut throrjgh the skin, turn the leg back, and separate it from the body ; then take off the Avings by jilacing the knife doAvn the side of the breast, in the line Avith the joint of the Aving, and cut through to joint, and separate it. Place the knife across the breast, half an inch beloAv the point of the breast-bone, slanting toAA*ards the neck, and remove the merrythought; then take off the small bones called the flyers, Avhich present their points on each side of the neck; then cut through the ribs on both sides ; pull up the fork Avith the breast. The back, if Avanted, may be cut across into three pieces. Slices may be taken off the breast. Ducks.—Slice the breast longtliAvays, and cut up in the same Avay as foAA’ls.IIINTi! OX CAUYING. 329 Turl-ei/ is frequently boned, and stuffed with a tongue and forcemeat. Cut slices lengthways the fifth of an inch thick, and sufficiently deep to cut through the tongue and stuffing. If not boned, cut slices off the breast, legs, and Avings. Di.sjoint as directed for fowls. Goose is carved in the same way as ducks, after removing in slices the meat from the breast. Tlic stuffing will be found in the body. Cut through the skin below the breast, and insert a spoon. Send stuffing on each plate. Pheasants are carved like fowls. Partridges.—If the birds are .small, cut them through the breast and back lengthways, and then each half into two; or they may be carved like a fowl. Grouse is carved like a partridge. Hare.—Cut slices lengthways off the back and legs; the stuffing is in the body. Turn over the hare, and cut it open. Send stuffing‘on each plate.

London : SIMPKIN, MARSHALL, & CO. NOTICES of the FBESS. 1 ‘ Tlie author does not profess to teach the recondite science of highly-flavoured cookery so much as to play the humble office of •“ The Young Housewife’s Daily Assistant,” and under the alliterative title of Cre-Fydd’e Family Fare has put forth a work that, as far as our experience goes, has considerable claims to the patronage of the public, not only on the score of special excellence in many of the general recipes, but on the ground of absolute novelty of design and construction as developed throughout the work. It is, therefore, for this practical character that we would chiefly commend the labours of our authoress, for we arc disposed to view and criticise them from the point of view which would be selected by a bachelor “ on promotion.” To such as these the book now before us must be a great boon. And we would ask ourselves,—Would it not be a comfort to marry a girl who had made herself mistress of the art of giving herself and myself a breakfast and dinner every day ? That which strikes us as being a special recommendation in Cre Fydd’s work is that it is to a considerable extent devotcci to the task of simplifying the daily routine of housekeeping, as practised in every-day life. We opine that upon that especial characteristic will the success which we prognosticate for this work mainly depend. That the authoress has taken great pains is evident in every page. Her work must, indeed, have been a labour of love, and we can well credit her assertion that every receipt has been tested in her own kitchen, and served at her own table; and we cannot do belter in taking our leave of her labours than re-echo her own Horatian motto for the edifleation of all the widows, wives, and maids of England :—“ If you know better pre- cepts than these, candidly tell me; if not, follow them as I do.” ’ Times, March 26, 1864. 2 ‘ Among the books relating to cookery, we may safely state that this is new. There is nothing precisely resembling it. Here we have, in the first place, a bill of fare for every day in the year, and, being adapted to only two persons, it can easily be increased to the right proportions according to the number at table. No better plan than this could be adopted for enforcing that variety of fare which is so requisite but so little practised. Dinners on a large scale follow, as well as suppers for any number of persons, all very useful in their way. The receipts given in the second part are to be noted for the plain planner in which they are described, and the exactness with which every single ingredient is specified. There cannot be a better cookery book for a small family and a young2 OlMNIONS OF THE PrESS. 3 ‘ Ladies who desire to have always at hand an accomplished puide in domestic aflTaira to discourse to them, clearly and pleasantly, on all subjects appertaininK to cookery proper, and to initiate them into the more recondite mysterv'es of the kitchen—such as the making: of jellies, creams, and the hundred other subtleties which constifute the arcana, the fine arts, of housewife lore—should obtain a work recently published, entitled “TlieToung: Housewife’s Daily Assistant in all Matters relating to Cookery and House- keeping.” It is of the most practical kind, and contains bills of family fare for every- day in the year, also twelve bills of fare for dinner parlies and two for evening enter- tainments, with the cost annexed. Many of the receipts are new, and all of them have been tested and served on the table of the authoress, under her direct supervision. It adds greatly to the practical value of the book to know that the whole of the cookery receipts in it have been successfully used with the aid of an ordinary range and the appli- ances usually found in the kitchen of a small establishment. In each case the quantity of every ingredient used is carefully given, as well as the exact time required in cooking. In addition to the large amount of valuable culinary information contained in the work, the authoress has introduced a variety of other receipts, and suggestions for the manage- ment of a house and servants, including items for invalids, and hints on all kinds of domestic matters.’ Illustrated Lo.ndo.v News,/'eft. 6, 18&I. ‘ “ Cre-Fydd” has presented the public with a very useful book; especially valuable to “ persons about to marry” on a moderate income. Not only does the author give many excellent receipts in simole language, purposely adapted to the comprehenHon of the idainest of “ plain cooks,” but she also provides bills of fare sufficient for every emer- gency. We find breakfasts and dinners, for the guidance of young and iuexperienc^ housekeepers, for every day in the year, of a description which, without being extrava- gant, ought to suffice to keep in good humour the most epicurean of husbands. We have in addition bills of fare for dinner-parties, with the precise sum which should be spent on each entertainment.’ Athen.sum, Jan. 16, lS6l. 5 ‘ This carefully written book is a model for utility and good sense. It gives precisely the kind of information which is useful to the housewives who manage professional homes; contains a bill of fare for a small family, servants included, for every day in the year; and the text amply fulfils the author’s statement that “the materials suggested are reasonably economical, the quantities exact, and the directions plain.” A chapter is devoted to “ Items for Invalids,” which the medical man, often sorely puzzled to prescribe a fitting diet for feeble stomachs and morbidly delicate palates, will find serviceable; but the work is likely to be most useful in his own home by way of adding to his own gastro- nomic comforts and enlarging his bill of fare—and no other bills.’ The L.ancet, March 26, 1864. 6 ‘ Few matters are of more social and sanitary importance than the preparation of our food, and such a book as the one before us is consequently of inestimable value in setting us right upon the many points connected with this subject. It is clearly and sensibly written, and is thoroughly practical. We especially commend to the notice of our readers the “ Items for Invalids,” amongst which will be found many little delicacies for the sick chamber. “ A few things worth knowing,” “ Hints to Mistresses,” and “ Hints to Ser- vants,” are well written, and treat of matters of vital importance, as regards the comfort of every household. We have very great pleasure in endorsing all that has been said in the numerous favourable notices of this book which have appeared in different pro es- Eional and other journals.’ ^ Medical Mirror, .4/»r»7 1864. ‘ The receipts have the merit of each being perfect in itself, without references and cross-references to ethers, which is often perjile.xing to the novice, and always tedious and troublesome. All French terms have been avoided; and as “Cre-fydd’s” establish- ment seems to have consisted only of two female servants, and the usual appliances found in the kitchen of such an establishment have been sufficient to prepare all the dishes set lortli, the whole of these receipts will be found suitable to persons of moderate income, whose position in life demands from them a due regard to its conventionalities.’ The Header, .fiiM. 16, 1864. 8 ‘ The receipts are practically available for the moderate and economical, yet reasonably luxurious, housekeeper. They have been tested and served on ^he fable of the authoress, and passed the ordeal of fastidious and critical palates. The quantity of everv ingredient used is carefully given, as well ns the exact time required for cooking. Cre-Fydd has in this way done good service to her countrywomen and their husbandt. „ Notes AND Queries, .fan. 30, 1861,3 Opinions of the Press. 9 ‘ “Cre-Fydd ” is persuasive, perspicuous, and precise : she makes it evident that a cook must save herself trouble by a careful observance of her instructious. The system on which this admirable cookery-book is arranged is the most comprehensive and simple which can be desired. To bills of family fare (suitable for a household of moderate means, and including two servants), which are cleverly diversified, and highly satisfactory, twelve bills of fare for dinner parties, eminently calculated to allay the mental anguish of the hostess and the gastronomic cravings of the guests, without disproportionate or unwaranted expense. Under the head of “ A Few Things Worth Knowing,” we find in- structions for the remedying of a number of painful emergencies with which the master and mistress of a household are tolerably certain to become unpleasantly familiar, from smoky chimneys to scalded fingers and sprained ankles. Deserves all manner of (pot) luck.’ Morning Post, Jan. 29, 1864. 10 ‘Written to help young housekeepers, and one that is really likely to be of use to them even if they only study the daily bills of fare for the kitchen. Cre-fydd’s information on other matters of domestic economy is well worth attending to.’ Globe, Feb. 11, 1864. 11 ‘This is a book of cookery on a new and original plan. It commences with Bills of Family Fare, calculated for two persons (with a corresponding allowance for the kitchen), but which a little addition or multiplication will easily render available for the instruction of a larger number. Bills of tare for dinner and other parties follow, to which are added careful instructions in cookery, plain or ornamental, but so worded as to be intelligible to others besides professed cooks or housekeepers imbued with the knowledge of many years. Nor is the information contained in this alluring work strictly confined to culinary proceedings. It includes prescriptions for invalids, good advice to mistresses and servants, and many other things well worth knowing by house- keepers, not omitting hints on carving. Every sentence is worth gold.’ Naval and Military Gazette, Jan. 9, 1864. 12 ‘This is not a common-place cookery book, merely giving receipts for making certain dishes, and nothing more. The authoress enters much more fully into the spirit of the work she has undertaken, and is evidently anxious to teach her fair readers to be good and economical managers as well as artistes. She actually provides a memi for every day in the year, selecting the dishes with practised taste, but at the same time not dis- regarding the question of expense. The useful information afforded under the head of ‘‘Things worth knowing ” is well worth the price of the entire book.’ . Army and Navy Gazette, Feb. 13, 1864. 13 ‘Thebook is arranged so that a servant by the exercise of moderate attention may produce any of the dainties specified, and may be presumed to afford a satisfactory response to the oft-propounded question, ‘‘What shall we have for dinner?” The authoress concludes with a number of suggestions for the practical guidance of mis- tresses and servants on the subject of household arrangements which, if well studied and acted up to by both mistress and maid, would tend to promote much greater comfort and much more mutual good feeling than at present exists in nine tenths of British households.’ Bell’s Life, Jan. 30, 1864. 14J. ‘ Messrs. SiMPKiN, Marshall, & Co. haveju.st published a handsome and useful volume designed for the special edification and instruction of young housekeepers. As a mere guide to the mysteries of domestic cookery the volume has much value; but it is likewise a teacher of domestic economy, and thus becomes more useful still. Among Its peculiarities is the publication of a bill of fare for every day in the year, including breakfast and dinner, for a small family. The cost of every article is clearly set out, and the result is to show in the simplest manner how the best result can be obtained on the most economic principles. The book may be safely recommended in every respect.’ Morning Star, Feb. 16, 1864. ‘The want that has been felt so long—of a plain sensible hook—that will really be a l>y“Cre-Fydd's Family Fare,” and we therefore offer no 'V ^ giving a bill of fare for each day in the year “Vi' /< r'.'” a» to what they shall order and what P 1 . ‘m P'"'o »o<> wholesome; and making use of what each holds > within the reach of most moderate and respectable house- CouRT Circular, 5, 1864.Opinions of the Press. 4 16 Cre-Fydd’s Family Fare ; or, Young; Housewife’s Daily Assistant,” is exactly wliat it pretends to be—a book of plain simple directions from an experienced lady, who in her own houseliold has suffered from the intricacy of, and tlie often absurd directions with which, the best cookery books perplex good plain cooks and housewives.’ North Londo.v News, March 5, 18C4. 17 ‘Need we say more in commending the work to all who wish to profit by the experi- ence of a practical housewife ? ’ .

There is a bill of fare here for every day in the year—what to have for breakfast, what the two servants should dine off in the kitchen, and what should be served up—both tasty and economical —up-stairs, Uesides this, there is a cyclopaedia of cookery and a budget of things worth knowing in the housewife sense.’ Court Journal, March 5, 1864. 19 “‘The Young; Housewife’s Daily Assistant,” on all matters relating to cookery and housekeeping, is written in language adapted to the understanding of the cook, and yet such that the lady ‘‘will not object to read.” The directions are plain and simple, and have all been tested by the authoress, therefore they may be considered thoroughly reliable. Regarding the expenses, the materials to be employed are ‘‘ reasonably econo- mical,” and beyond this nothing can be promised. The work contains a ‘‘ bill of fare” for every day throughout the year, and for an occasional ” dinner party ”—some 900 recipes; and a chapter on “ Things Worth Knowing” is given. Among the above we have hints to mistresses and servants, and directions for carving. The book is printed with a copious inde.x, and deserves a large circulation.’—Public Upinio.v, Jan. 9,1864. 20 ‘ What constant variety may, without extravagance, be introduced into the ordinary meals of a household, is partly shown in a capital new housekeeper’s book, called “ Cre-fydd’s Family Fare.” Such a book would carry any housewife, resolved to become pleasantly skilled, as she ought to be, in culinary lore, far on her way.’ All the Year Round, Feb. 27, 1S64. 21 * ‘ The work is mainly designed for families that are in comfortable rather than opulent circumstances; some directions touching health and general comfort are added. The instructions are all plainly conveyed, and the volume will be a treasure to those young and inexperienced couples who have just issued out of the honeymoon into the more substantial moons of joints and made dishes.’ London Review, Feb. 27, 1S64. 22 ‘ Twelve bills of fare for dinners of entertainment are given, with the estimate cost; no less than 898 receipis lor all sorts of dishes, sauces, &c. ; receipts for punch liqueurs, &c.; a few things worth knowing as remedies for many of the ‘‘ ills that flesh is heir to:” directions for doing little things; hints on carving; hints to mistresses and servants, and a capital index to the whole.’ Cape Argus (English Edition), March 5, 1864. 23 ‘ It is no doubt true that most of our cookery books are not adapted to a moderate, economical, or to a reasonably luxurious household. They suppose a degree of wealth and knowledge which are the exception more than the rule. The authoiess of the bock before us has aimed to assist, not the few only, but a class beyond, and in the main she has been successful.’ Rritish Quarterly RsvtEW, April 1, 1864. ‘ We hail, in the pages of “ Cre-fydd,” a judicions resolve to supply that infomiation which is most wanted, and therefore most useful, and to prefer the claims of evep--day life to a mere di.“play of scientific gastronomy.

In the main, Cre-fydd appears to have reco°:nised the wholesome principle; and if she has here and there, in the e.\cusable pride of matured experience, ventured to give us a grand combination, it will only enhance the value of her book in the opinion of the higher votaries of the culinary art. That she has carefully studied the details of that mysterious science, and that her disciples may derive great benefit from the knowledge she has so laboriously acquired and so lucidly set forth, there cannot be a moment’s doubt.’ Bell’s Weekly Messenger, April 2, 1861. 25 ‘ The notes appended to the receipts are very valuable charming little hints, laden with instruction. A new class of dishes is found in “ Cre-Fydd ”—we refer to those with the heading in brackets (second dressing). We have looked carefully through the bills of family fare—we pronounce them so good, and so well arranged, as to leave us to desire nothing better than that they should be the diary of our gastronomic doings for 1864. We heartily recommend the book, and would advise all our fair young brides who desire to see their husbands eat a good dinner in good temper at their own tables, to include “ Cre-Fydd ” amongst the treasures of their trousseau, and suggest to our valued friends, the matrons, that if they place it on their book-shelves, they will often turn to it as a valuable help and coadjutor.’ York Herald, Jan. 30, 1864. 26 ‘This book we have referred to a jury of our female friends, who have discussed its merits, and have pronounced a most favourable opinion of the work. Every wife or daughter who was not well up in such affairs would do well to take this book into their confidence.’ Yorkshire Gazette, Jan. 30, 1864. 27 ‘ In a new work on cookery, published under the somewhat singular title, “ Cre-Fydd’s Family Fare, the Young Housewife’s Daily Assistant,” the writer, a Yorkshire lady, gives excellent hints to mistresses and servants.’ Leeds Mercury, Jan. 15, 1864. 28 ‘ We think, after a careful perusal, it fulfils our views in conformity with the wants of the middle class, possessed of only moderate incomes. It takes up entirely new ground, and forms and executes a plan totally different from that of its predecessors. The part called “ Remarks and Directions to be Remembered,” is one of the most valuable parts of the book, and we believe not to be found in any other cookery-book. It consists of a clear explanation of many of the terms used in the succeeding receipts, and directions as to the state, preparation, use, and management of the various utensils and ordinary condiments employed in cooking, as well as accurate information in conducting the processes of roasting, boiling, braising, and steaming. A part to our mind is of the greatest importance in promoting the comfort, well-being, and happiness of a household, and which appears under the modest title of “A Few Things Worth Knowing.” It contains a variety of suggestions as to what medical stores the careful housewife should always have at hand; what is to be done in the event of sudden attacks of illness, such as fainting fits or paralysis, until proper medical aid can be procured.’ Stockton Herald, Jan. 29, 1864. 29 ‘ “ Cre-fydd ” has to our mind fulfilled her mission, as the writer of a good practical book on cookery, but in our estimation there are other points in the book of at least as much importance and value. We allude to the excellent information and advice to be found under the title “ A Few Things Worth Knowing.” There are introduced a variety of “ Hints to the-Mistress ” as to hiring servants, ordering dinners, keeping accounts, the proper contents of the store-closet, the right quantities to be given out to servants, and the length of time those quantities ought properly to last, the seasonable time for laying in stores, the suitable weekly stores for the kitchen, as well as many other matters of the same description, which arc well worthy of attention. The next minor head is ‘Hints to Servants.” Herein are to be found many invaluable directions as to the distribution of the work of the household between the servants ; the lime when, and the mode in which it should be performed; the proper appliances to be employed in tier- forming It, and the mode of using them.’ Darlington and Stockton Times, Jan. 30, 1864. t 30 Cre-fydd’’desires to be a real friend, and the puzzling question: “What shall we nave for dinner? is answered with suwli circuinstantiulity that in one part of her volume she jjiyes the materials for two meals for every day in the year.

In conclusion, we think that we may confidently express an opinion that “ Cre-fydd’s” book should be found in every house where, although a moderate income is possessed, there is a reasonable desire to secure as much comfort and happiness as circumstances will permit.’ Wakefield Joubval. 32 ‘Cre-fydd has a most praiseworthy desire to make the book meet the wants of those who feel that economy in housekeeping matters is a necessity; not pinching, harassing economy, but careful prudence, while enjoying the comforts of middle life. Towards the end of the book come some “ Items for Invalids,” and hints as to the management of servants, &c., which are not only exceedingly useful, but something new, and really likely to be of great service to many. If there are many delicacies in the dishes made expressly for the sick room, no one would grudge them, and the receipts that Cre-fvdd gives certainly promise to make the invalid’s meals less uninteresting than they often are, and will also, we think, meet the doctor’s views as regards their wholesomeness.’ Sheffield Independent, March H, 1861. 33 ‘ Cre-fydd has to our mind made to the culinary literature of the country a valuable addition, from its perfect novelty, and forms, to the middle class whose incomes are moderate, a perfect guide in all matters of, or connected with. Housekeeping and Cookery.’ Newcastle Daily Chronicle, March 18,1861. 34 ‘ It is specially intended, as far as we can judge, for the use and behoof of the middle classes, in all matters of cookery and housekeeping, whose incomes are of limited amounts. Under the head “ Housekeeping,” this volume embraces a truly valuable code for the direction of household affairs. In conclusion, we are bound to say that ” Cre-fydd ” is at once novel and complete, and that the fair authoress of this book has conferred a lasting benefit on every household in which the mistress and the cook adopt it as their daily companion and guid^’ Hull Advertiser, March 19,1861. ♦ 35 ‘The “ Hints to the Mistress ” are difficult to overvalue by the inexperienced house- keeper. Under the title “ A few things worth knowing,” we find directions as to the management of a house in all its departments, calculated to render every home far happier than it is generally found to be, so far, at least, as depends on domestic manage- ment.’ The Scarborough Gazette, March 17,1861. 36 ‘ The pages before us are addressed to the middle classes of English society. Each recipe is perfect in itself, and thus, much perplexity is avoided. There are several bills of fare introduced, with the cost of each, both for dinner parties and evening entertain- ments; items for invalids are also not forgotten ; and many hints are given in relation to the economy of domestic life that cannot fail to be found frequently useful in every household ; among these, “ Hints to Servants ” are not the least valuable.’ The Manchester Examiner, March 29, 1864. 37 ‘ “Cre-fydd’s Family Fare.”—It is not often that one meets with a book of this kind that is so well entitled to be called “ The young housewife’s daily assistant in all matters relating to cookery and housekeeping” as this is. In all respects it is admirably adapted to its purpose, and must have cost the lady who wrote it, and who has evidently bad a rich store of experience and keen and accurate observation to work upon, intense labour and application. The recipes, some of which we have tried, are very suitable for the use of the middle class, aud have evidently been prepared with a view to judicious economy as well as excellence of result. In short, it is one of the most complete books of the description ever issued from the press, aud ought to be placed in the hands of every young housekeeper.’ Manchester Courant, Feb. 20, 1864. 38 ‘ This is a work that is likely to supersede all other books on the same subject. To families of moderate means “ Cre-fydd’s Family Fare ” will prove invaluable. The ®ent merit of her book, apart from the excellence of the rcciints themselves, is the clear way in which they are given. The work therefore can stand on its own merits, and needs only to be known to be appreciated. The book contains, likewise, various miscellanMus instructions and directions to servants and others, to which, it is to be hoped, those into whose hands it may be placed will give the attention they deserve.’ Chester Courant, Feb. 24, 1864.Opinions of the Press. / 39 ‘ “Cre-Fydd ” has no cause to dread the criticism of us, or tliat of any other journalist. The book is quite new in its plan and execution. It is the sound guide for the middle class, whose incomes are moderate, in matters of Cookery and Housekeeping. “Hints to the Mistress.”—Here suggestions are made as to the hiring of servants, tlie contents of the store-closet, the giving out those stores, and the time they ought to Inst, keeping accounts, ordering dinners, and checking tradesmen’s bills. Next are “ Hints to Ser- vants ’’—Equal good sense and knowledge appear under this head. We can without hesitation recommend it as an invaluable guide to those persons “who are about to marry.” Cheltenham E.xamineb, March 20, 1864. 40 ‘ As far as we can judge, the various recipes given bear all the appearance of excellence combined with a consistent regard to cheapness. A bill of fare for every day in the year is given; also necessary arrangements for small and large dinner and evening parties, with the average costs attached.’ Bath Journ.^l, March 5, 1864. 41 ‘ The old adage says “ Too many cooks spoil the broth,” and possibly too many cookery books may spoil the cooks; but if there is not room for an additional one, v\e must cer- tainly displace one of our older guides to make room for the new comer with its quaint Cambrian title, for it has special features of its own, which, when it is generally known, will, we feel sure, give it an equal circulation to the most celebrated manuals. We notice some special features which ought to make Cre-fydd’s book a treasure to housekeepers and cooks. Besides the actual receipts and lists of dishes, there are some valuable hints to young housekeepers on household matters; and that great desideratum, a Dietary for the Sick Chamber, for the want of which many an invalid goes dinnerless, in spite of the best wishes and lavish expenditure. We heartily recommend “ Cre-fydd’s Family Fare ” as one of the best and most practical cookery books yet published.’ Bath Express, March 12, 1864. 42 ‘ It is an additional recommendation to find that “ the quantity of every ingredient used is carefully gpven, as well as the exact time required in cooking.” Each receipt is perfect in itself. The book contains much novel and excellent information, in a shape we have not before met with.’ Western Daily Press, Jan. 25, 1864. 43 ‘ “ What shall we have for dinner to-day?” was the title of a very popular little book, which proposed to answer rather a puzzling question. The work before us, however, directs us not only in matters of dinner, but in matters of breakfast also. Cre-Fydd is entitled to public thanks, and we hope will receive public support for her useful volume.’ Bristol Times,/an. 22, 1864. 44 ‘ This is a very complete and useful book on all matters relating to cookery and house- keeping. This book is, in many respects, new in design, and its object is to teach the young ^usekeeper not only how to serve a good dinner, but how to do it in the most economical way. It also contains recipes for almost every dish that even an epicure could desire, and these possess the merit of perspicuity, a merit which is thoroughly appre- ciated by the uninitiated in the culinary art; and we are told that they have passed the ordeal of fastidious and almost morbidly critical palates, and have come lorth with approval. Great labour has evidently been bestowed on the work, and it may be recom- mended with confidence.’ Hampshire Telegraph and Sussex Chronicle, March 12, 1864. TTiis is called “ The young housewife’s daily assistant on all matters relating to cookery and housekeeping,” and it is certdinly in every way worthy of its title. Every receipt is wnttoi in a plain style that can be easily understood, and altogether the work is one of the best of the kind we have ever read.’ Hampshire Independent, March 19, 1864. B B8 Opinions of the Press. 46 ‘ The main value of a cookery book depends upon the instructions for preparine the materials. In this matter we can unreservedly recommend the work before us. Upon the whole, we think that the lady who has written “ Cre-fydd’s Family Fare ” has made a valuable addition to what may be called the “ culinary literature ” of the day. Westmoreland Gazette, January 16,1664. 47 ‘ We feel that the authoress (for the preface discloses that we are indebted to a lady for the production), has taken up entirely new ground, and has produced a book perfectly fitted to supply a want long felt by those belonging to the middle class, and who possess moderate incomes. In perusing the work, we were struck with the remarkable minute- ness, perspicuity, plainness of language (all French terms being avoided), which cbarac. terise the directions with reference to weight, measure, number, size, quantity, quality, proportion, fire, implements of cooking and their proper use. As far as we can judge, nothing but obstinacy would prevent the dullest of unskilled servants from producing any of the dishes described. The “Hints to Mistresses” and “Hints to ^rvants” may justly be called “ Manuals ” for each class. The subjects of our remarks are, we believe, completely new, and we can confidently state that Cre-fydd has produced a work eminently beneficial to experienced as well as inexperienced housekeepers, in all matters of cooking and housekeeping; and well deserves the praises which have been so liberally bestowed upon the work by our cotemporaries.’ Reading Mercury, March 12, 1864. 48 ‘ This is one of the most comprehensive, lucid, and useful books on all those subjects connected with cookery and household management which we know of. Its recent pub- lication may be taken as a guarantee that it possesses the fuilest and soundest informa- tion on the culinary art. A young housewife could not have a better “ assistant ” in domestic matters than this work is likely to afford.’ Leicester Journ.al, Feb. 12, 1864. 49 ‘ Lastly, we must refer to the title, “ A Few Things Worth Knowing.” This may justly be called a minute code of the duties of housekeeping, properly so called. It contains many valuable suggestions to the mistress and to the servant in their respective spheres. We have arrivedat the conclusion that there is much that is new in “ Cre-Fydd’s Family Fare,” which cannot fail to recommend it to every class of readers.’ Essex Herald, Feb. 23,1864. 50 ‘ The work has many things peculiar to itself, many ideas which if not new are well put; and containing as it does a vast number of bills of fare for the family in its ordinary course, as well as for the extra occasions of friendly parties, with the cost of each dish; plain cooking and the provision that ought to be made for servants; cooking for in- valids ; and directions so minute and plain that no one of ordinary intelligence can mis- understand them, as to quantities, time, state of the fire. &c.—it must be ver>- useful for the young housewife, and a good present for her to place in the hands of a new servant.’ Chelmsford Chronicle, March 9, 1864. 51 ‘ This is the most complete and practical work that has yet come under our attention on that apparently simple, but in reality very difficult, art of preparing our daily food in a wholesome, palatable, diversified, and inexpensive style.’ Brighton Herald, Ja»L 30,1864. 52 cared ia a ^ __ ' ItemSfor Invalids.” are generally uie iiiiiiisieniig nugeis ui mu oiui. ...a,, a ............... ... — — , too, we think it would be most useful, by diminiSliing, in some degree, his irksome labours, and would promote the comfort of the patient. \^ e heartily commend the worK both to the experienced and the inexperienced housekeeper.

We cannot too strongly recommend “ Cre-Fydd ” as a sound and sure guide to the inexperienced housekeeper, and a useful aid to those who have the advantage of experience.’ , , Richmond (Yorkshirb) Chronicle, April 2, 18C4. 54 ‘ A more appropriate gift for a young housewife than this volume we cannot possibly conceive, while to those of limited income, as well as to the affluent, it will prove invalu- able. The bills of fare for each day are carefully arranged, so that persons need not incur the risk of having dishes served up which are out of season—a very acceptable piece of information, we conceive. The numerous directions for conducting culinary processes are both precise and copious. It adds vastly to the practical value of the book to know that the whole of the receipts in it have been successfully used with the aid of an ordi- nary range and the appliances generally found in the kitchen of a small establishment; and we can safely declare that neither mistresses nor servants will ever turn in vain for instruction to its well-stored pages.’ Royal Leamington Spa Courier, April 2, 1864. 55 ‘ The book before us is the work of a lady who has evidently used to some purpose her domestic opportunities, and looked well to the ways of her household. The contents of the volume invite our faith, and we would be well pleased to leave our domestic destinies in the hands of Cre-Fydd. It is probable, that of the purchasers of Cre-Fydd’s capital book— who, we hope, will be very numerous—few may think of following the entire programme, but all we believe will find something in it to promote the comfort and en- joyment of their meals. The authoress is especially desirous to make herself understood by the young housewife and the plain cook. She writes not for the learned in these matters, but for those who have yet to learn, and so anxious is she to smooth the way that French terms are as far as possible avoided. It is, in short, a book of good English cookery, suited to moderately sized but comfortably provisioned establishments. In addition to the culinary receipts, there are numerous suggestions given calculated to promote household cleanliness and health.’ Edinburgh Evening Courajjt, Peb. 18, 1864. 56 ‘This is a most excellent cookery book, and should supply a want that must have been keenly felt by many a young housewife who has not had a thorough practical training in the mysteries of the kitchen.’ Aberdeen Herald, Jan. 16, 1864. 57 The woman who has learned the art of cooking well and of teaching her servants to do the same, has learned an an which will conduce more to the comfort and happiness of her home than almost any other she can acquire. Among the number of books on cooking we have seen none that can be more confidently recommended to the class for whom it is intended than “ Cre-Fydd’s Family Fare.” It is written from the point of view of a lady in the middle class, who has to keep house in a style of comfort on moderate means. All the receipts are in plain Rnglish, and are such as mav be understood and acted on by any person who can read and who has learned the first elements of cooking.’ Inverness Courier, March 10, 1864. 58 ‘ If any are, however, disposed to enter upon so useful a branch of education as cookery, we can recommend no better book than the present, which, written by a prac- tical hand, who writes not alone for accomplished arlMes, sets down everything so plainly that she who reads may cook, however inexperienced she may have been.’ Banffshire Journal, Jan. 12, 1864. 59 ou appears to have universal experience in the matter of dinner-giving She brings to her task a skill and taste almost reaching the elevation of genius As far as we can undertake to judge, all former books of the kind are cast into the shade by her 11 1^,* ^*i****®J'*'”, *^®®aaris the ne plus ultra of a manual of cookery.

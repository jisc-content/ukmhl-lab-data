This publication is a bumble endeavour to afford some assistance to ladies in the daily difficulty of what to order for dinner, and how to describe it. Cooks are not generally gifted with fertile imagi- nations, and are inclined to get into a routine which is a source of annoyance to those who desire a variety of dishes, if not for themselves, at least for their friends. Ladies often wish to be ready with suggestions of a change in the proposals of the cook, and even when in some measure provided with these, a second difficulty arises—what are these dishes to be called? What are the correct technical names for them ? The French of cookery is a language of itself, and those who are not learned in it are often entirely at a loss when suddenly called on to write out a correct French menu with no other assistance than that of a dictionary. In carrying out this idea, lists ofIntroduction. VI various dishes have been given, arranged in courses, with the French names, as well as the English equivalent or description. It is not intended to give recipes, such as would he adequate for the preparation of the dishes in the kitchen; the dishes are only so far described as to enable the*"mistress to recognize them, giving a general idea of their ingredients and of their ap- pearance when sent to table. If the full recipes are desired for the cook’s use, they will he found in the well-known cookery hooks, so many of which are now published.CONTENTS. Introduction . CHAPTER I.

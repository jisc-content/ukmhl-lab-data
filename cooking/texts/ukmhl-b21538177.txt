The need for good, nourishing food, well cooked and tastefully served, is the need of all ages. It has been said that they who provide the food of the world decide the health of the world. That being the case, the more knowledge there can be disseminated on such an im- portant subject the better; and the result of long years’ knowledge bought by experience cannot fail to help many a perplexed housewife in these days of hurry and high pressure. I As was stated in the first edition, the book does not claim to be original. The idea is, that every housewife has her own special recipes, or tit-bits of household information, the result of practical experience. These tested recipes, gathered from a wide circle of friends, have formed a most useful Cookery Book, as has been amply proved by the success and rapid sale of nine editions. E. W. KIRK.

GOLDEN RULES FOR THE KITCHEN. Without cleanliness and punctuality good cooking is impossible. Leave nothing dirty; clear as you go. A time for everything, and everything in time. A good cook wastes nothing. An hour lost in the morning has to be run after all day. Haste,, without hurry, saves worry, fuss, and flurry. Stew boiled is stew spoiled. Strong fire for roasting, clear fire for boiling. Wash vegetables in three waters. Boil fish quickly, boil meat slowlyINDEX. SOUPS.

SOUPS. A thick soup should be about the sawe consistency as cream, but a clear soup can never be too transparent. To obtain this transparency, be^in to skim directly it begins to boil, and skim until no scum remains. ^ teaspoonful salt added as soup comes to boil, also a cup of cold water thrown in ivhen it boils, make scum rise more freely. Add ketchup at last moment, as boiling dissipates the flavour. In hot weather, soups and gravies, if kept from day to day, should be warmed every day, and kept in cool larder, in freshly-scalded tureens. If stock is to be kept several days,'leave fat on till ready to use. Stock boiled with vegetables is more apt to turn sour than when made from meat alone. Broth will keep longer fresh if a cauliflower has been one of the vegetables used. Soyer says a little vinegar and brown sugar should be added to all vege- table soups. Before serving clear soup, add a lump of sugar. This improves its appearance. Boil soup steadily but not too rapidly, or vegetables will harden and the nourishment be kept from flowing out into water. To skim soup; if cold, dip spoon in warm water and skim; if hot, with paper drawn over top. When there is no time to boil meat, bones, &c., and stock is wajtied, take 2 tablespoons Plastnon powder, add gradually 2 breakfast cups tepid water. Stir till it boils, add large pinch of salt, and boil 2 minutes. To remove acidity from soup, put soup in pan to boil, add ^ teaspoonfid carbonate of soda, boil a minute. Skim carefully and serve.

Clean them, and wipe them di-y with a cloth—a soft cloth and a gentle hand are necessai'y. Then dredge them lightly with flour, or roll in fine oatmeal. Melt enough dripping in your frying-pan to just cover the fish; when it is still and smoking, put in the fish one at a time, with a few seconds between each, so as to keep up the heat of the fidture. Fry a golden brown, take up, sprinkle with sale, drain on thickly-folded kitchen paper in front of the fire, and serve—a good appetite is the only sauce needed. Largo trout are good for grilling, which can be done in several ways. The fish can be cleaned, wiped, rubbed over with oiled butter, and placed on a gridiron over a very claar fire, being' turned several rimes in the process of cooking.

In cooking all meat 7tot to he made into soup, whether roasted, stewed, or boiled, subject the outside of the meat to strong heat to shut up all pores and keep in juices, then cook more slowly. A little juice of lemon squeezed over lamb chops before broiling them gives them a delicate and delicious flav- our. When making pies, to prevent crust becoming soaked with the gravy, &c., place pie-funnel in centre and lay a few clean wooden meat skewers {which come from the butcher') across the dish before putting on crust. Never pierce meat while cook- ing, or the juices will escape. Veal must not be laid on a plate, but hung in an airy place till cooked.

Then add cold water—a pint for every pound; a peeled onion, stuck with a clove or two ; and a sprig of pai'sley, a bay leaf, some herbs, and a bit of lemon peel, all tied in a piece of muslin. Simmer slowly for 3 hour's. Meanwhile, out up some onion, turnip, and carrot into dice ; allow 1 or 2 breakfastcupfuls of each (according to taste and circumstances) to each pound of hough. If you have the time, fry these lightly in a pan with a piece of dripping—it greatly improves their flavour. About ] hour before you wish to serve 3Kiur stew, add the vegetables to it, and slightly increase the heat, but don’t boil. Then at the last, stir in a good tablespoonful of ketchup or Worcester sauce, and, with a good dish of potatoes, you will have a dinner “fit for a king,” which gives the maximum of nutriment at the minimum of cost.

While these are steAviug cut up the steak (or raljbit or chicken) into dice, trimniing off all fat, gristle, (tc., from steak, or disjointing the two latter as small as joints will i^ennit. Mix curiy powder and pea flour into a thick paste with a little warm water, stir to browned onions, mix cut-up beef and salt, and stir all well together. Pour boiling water over all, sufficient to cover the meat or poultiy, and sinuner the whole for 2 hours, or until quite tender. To this oun’y may be added I table- spoonful lemon juice or vinegar, and the milk of ^ big cupful of dessi- cated cocoanut, which must be first soaked in boiling water for h hour and then squeezed through a strainer. Serve cuny very hot in a dish by itself, and some boiled rice in a separate dish. Curry and rice should always be eaten with a spoon and fork, and not a knife; there- fore, the meat or poultry must be well cooked. If made with cold meat, stock must be used instead of hot water. Slices of any fish may be made into a cuny, in which case the onions, curry powder, pea flour, and stock must all be boiled first for ^ hour at least, and then the slices of fresh fish should be boiled in it, alloAving sufficient time only for cooking the fish—7 or 8 minutes. Any good meat stock may be used for the above. Cold vegetables—the greater the variety the better—make a delicious dry curry, but then more good dri23ping must be used instead of any stock, and the whole, sliced up after being- boiled, is fried in it, being stirred constantly till it looks brown and done. lb. of dripping at least will be reejuired, and a tablespoonful of vinegar at last, well mixed into the Avhole.

Hagrsris (Genuine Scotch). Procure the large stomach bag of a sheep, also one of tire smaller bags called “King’s Hood,” together with the pluck, which is the lights, liver, and heart. The bags must be well w’ashed, first in cold water, then plunged in boiling water, and scraped. Great care must be taken of the large bag; let it lie and soak in cold water, with a little salt, all night. Wash also the pluck. You will now boil the small bag along with the pluck; in boiling, leave the windpipe at- tached, and let the end of it hang over the edge of the pot, so that impurities may pass freely out. Boil for hours, and take the w'hole from the pot. Yflien cold, cut away the windpipe and any bits of skin or gristle that seem improper. Grate the quarter of the liver (not using the remainder for the haggis), and mince the heart, lights, and small bag very small, along with ^ lb. of beef suet.

The haggis is now complete. Put it in a pet with boiling water, and prick it occasionally with a large needle, as it swells, to allow the air to escape. If the bag appears thin, tie a cloth outside the skin. There shoidd be a. plate beneath it, to prevent it sticking to the bottom of the pot. Boil it for 3 hours. Serve in a napkin on a dish, without garnish or gravy, it being sufficiently rich in itself. Hagrgis (Scotch, Simpler). Take 2 or 3 handfuls oatmeal; brown in oven; add to this J lb. suet minced fine, and any cold meat minced; but it is often made without the latter. Season with a little minced parsley, onion, salt, and pepper. Mix with a breakfastcupful of water, then put in a dish or pan with a close lid; boil 3 hours.

Gather Vegetables in cool of morning If the sun is on them they are sure to be tough and discoloured. Green Vege- tables ought to be crisp, fresh-coloured, and sweet smelling, and root vegetables firm. Keep in cool dark place. Cover celery and catdiflower from the light with paper. Before wash- ing vegetables, give them a little slap against the palm of the hand, and much of the dirt, sand, and insects will drop off, which would otherwise stick when plunged into the water. Soak cabbage and catdiflower in cold water, with a tablespoonful vinegar added. Better than salt; salt only kills the caterpillars —vinegar also draws them out. The zvater should not boil before wanted, or vegetables will be discoloured. All green vegetables float on the water first, and when cooked fall to the bottom. . To prevent vegetables from smelling the house when boiling, put a little piece of bread in muslin and put in pan. A little vinegar may be kept boiling on the stove while onions or cabbage is being cooked; this also will prevent the disagreeable odour going through the house. The proportion of salt to allow in cooking vegetables is one teaspoonful to every half-gallon of water. Remember that all green vegetables, except spinach, are cooked with the cover of the saucepan off. Vegetables of strong flavour, which include most green vegetables, shoidd be well covered with fast boiling water, and cooked rather rapidly till done, but if at any time the water go off the boil replace the lid till water boils up again, as slow boiling spoils the colour of all green ""egetables. A good rule is that vegetables which growTRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY BOOK. 58 below the ground should always be put in cold water for cooking, while all that grow above should be plunged in boiling water. All white vegetables need a little acid; all green, a little soda. When boiling green vegetables of any kind, if a. piece of drip- ping about the size of a ivalnut is put in the centre of the vege- tables just as they begin to boil it ivill prevent all boiling over. After cookmg, vegetables must be zvell drained of all super- fluoits moisture, ivhether they are to be served with sauce over or not. Before cooking onions, let them lie, when peeled, in a little boiling water with a tiny piece of soda added. When preparing onions for cooking it will be fotind much more com- fortable work if they are peeled or .diced under water. Hold in the lap a large bowl filled ivith clear water, and work with the hands under the water. Onions done in this manner will not cause tears of stained fingers. To clean a knife that has been used for cutting onions, hold it under the cold water tap. It is a mistake to use hot water to remove the smell of onions from a knife. Onions should not be eaten after they have lain about peeled and cut, as they absorb any bad odour or infectious con- dition that may exist. All waste leaves of vegetables should be burned; if thrown into the dust-bin they will decay, and help to create bad smells and fever. When burning vegetable refuse in stove or fireplace, put a handful of salt into the fire with it, and there ivill be no unpleasant odour. KECIPE FOR STEAMING VEGETABLES, Jiy Miss L. Bardsley, I<''uotl JkTorm Cookery Lecturer. For cooking greens, sprouts, cabbage, lettuce, and caulitlowei’, I find the most successful -way is' to steam them in a perforated steamer and do them very quickly, at a great rate. This I find preserves their green colour more than in any otlier way. They ought to be served as quickly as possible after cooking. Lettuce does in about 7 minutes, cabbage and caulifiower from 20 to 30 (cut up slightly). The loss of salts is so infinitesimal that it is hardly Avorth speaking of. Experiments have been made by Mr Broadbent, and he says the residue of salts in a cup of water that has boiled the cabbage in an ordinary AA'ay, and that Avliich lias steamed it, is remarkable, so much more being extracted by lioiling. I often steam cabbage (first shred- ding it) in a “Yankee Idea” steamer (not perforated), anrl add no UxOre Avater than the drippings left on it. I have also used a Wellbank boilerette, and steAA'ed my cabl3age, first putting a very little boiling Avater at the bottom, as not so mucli steam is generated as in the Hutchinson Patent. What makes them strong, I find, is too much cooking. Celery and root vegetables I steam Avithout a perforator. I find a large fish kettle the best thing for sprouts, Ac., as the heat penetrates better ini account of the extra surface. Quarter of an hour quick steaming is quite enough. Do you OA^er try A’egetable ragouts? This is a splendid Avay for conservatively cooking the vegetables. BroAvn some onions in butter, Avitli some carrot and some chopped59 TRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY BOOK. celery (about equal quantity of all), with some thin vegetable stock (not too much),’ and cook gently for about U- hours. A little cauli- Mcyver, artichokes, or tomatoes could be added if liked, and thicken with a little baked flour, and add a few drops or more of Mapleton’s nut gravy essence. This, with some crisp toast or fried bread, makes .a tasty and wholesome dish. I .save nearly all my rough pieces of veo-etable for stock, even tho outside of onions washed well, and tougli pi«:es of cabbage, Ac. A delicioms soup is made from all sorts of vegetables cooked a long time, straincil well, and a little veimicelR added. Tliere must bo plenty of vegetable, and then it is fit for the mo.st fastidious taste. Tt is quite good without any butter, but a few onions, browned in a little nutter (vegetal)le Imtter) first, add a riclier flavour, perhaps, and also'a little vegefable gravy essence. It is cer- tainly a good 'vay of niaking use of the salts! Jerusalem Artichokes. 1 lb. artichokes, well Avashed and scrajicd, eacli one throAvn into fresh cold water and vinegar; when .all are done, lanso in water and put into boiling milk and water, and salt.

Put the butter and flour into a pan, and stir over the fire; then add tlie milk, and stir till boils. Add parsley, pepper, and salt; mix well, and pour over the beans when dished— serve hot. Beet Root. Wash and brush the roots, being careful to avoid breaking off the fibres, to prevent the juice escaping, and spoiling the colour and flavour. Put them in a pan of boiling water, adding salt and a small piece of soda, and boil from 1 to 2 hours, according to size. Put into cold water, and rub off the skin with the hand. Slice them, and serve either with vinegar or mustard sauce. Beetroot is very good boiled as usual, and served covered with white or parsley sauce, or with Spanish onions sliced. When a piece of straw will pierce the beets, they are ready. Beet Root, Fried. Prepare as above. Season with pepper and salt. Fry slices in butter or dripping. Place on a flat dish, and garnish with parsley. Brussels Sprouts. Allow them to stand for some time in cold water and salt, cut off stems, and take away outer leaves.

Place in oven ten minutes, turn on hot dish, and sprinkle on top the paisley, and serve with sauce of melted butter oi floui and milk. Cauliflower, au Gratin. Take a good-sized cauliflower, thorouglily cleanse, and boil until tender; drain, and dish it with tlie flower standing upriglit (a basin is the best thing for this purpose). Pour suflicicnt white sauce over the cauliflower just to cover the top. Sprinkle over some grated parmesan cheese and bread crumbs, and a little Cayenne .pepper and salt; then put a few pieces of butter on the top. Bake in a moder- ately hot oven for about 15 minutes, or until it is a nice brown. Other vegetables, such as fresh peas and beans, onions, parsnips, artichokes and marrow, may be prepared the same way. Before cooking cauliflower, tie it in thin muslin, and it will be easily lifted out of the pan whole. Cauliflower, with Tomato Sauce. Steam the cauliflower until tender; have ready a sauce prepared by thickening 1 pint of strained stewed tomatoes with a tablespoonful of flour, rubbed smooth, in | cupful of cream, and pour over the cauli- flower while hot.

Select the best pieces, and cut in 3-inch lengths. Dust rather freely with pepper and salt, then dip in beaten egg, and toss in bread crumbs. Fry in boiling fat. Chestnuts, Stewed (German Recipe). Take away the shell; then put for a short time in boiling water to remove the inner skin. Put them into a saucepan with a little stock of some kind—bovril will do—then let them simmer away until ready. A little sprinkling of flour is generally added when they are being cooked, about as much as wall lie on the end of a knife. The Italian way of cooking chestnuts for a vegetable is by mash- ing them like turnips, with a little milk or cream. .Colcannon. 1 oz. Onion, equal quantities cold Potatoes and cold Cabbage, 1 oz. Dripping to 1 lb. Vegetables, Pepper and Salt. Chop cabbage; mash potatoes. Toss all in saucepan or frying- pan. Grease basin and put in mixture. Brown before fire or in oven. Cucumber.

Cook for 5 minutes, boiling rapidly. Have ready 1 gill white .sauce, add cucumber to it, with 1 taldespoonful cream, lemon juice, and 1 tablespoonful parsley, (tarnish with coraline pepper. Always begin to cut cucumbers at the thick end. The thin end often lias a bitter taste. Do not slice till it comes to table. You could then eat a whole cucumber witliout it being indigestible. If not finished, stand end cut in a basin of water. Ka.le or Curly Greens. 1 lb. fresh kale to 2 c^narts water, one heaped tablespoonful salt, piece of soda the size of filbert.

Drain well, pressing all water out with a plate. Leeks. 8 or 10 medium-sized Leeks. Trim off root and outer skin, wasting as little as possible; cut off top leafy part, so that all are one length. Throw in boiling salted water, and boil rapidly -J- hour. If very young, rather less time ; if fidl-grown, ratlier more. Drain well, and serve on toast with melted liutter over. If leeks are very small, tie in a bunch before putting to boil. Lentils, Dahl. i pint Egyptian Lentils, 1 Onion, 1 teaspoonful Curry, 1 oz. Butter, 1 oz. Dripping, i teaspoonful Sugar. Wash lentils well and let them soak all night; strain them. Fry the onion (sliced) to a nice brown in the dripping. In a saucepan put the lentils to them, with enough water to cover them, and let them boil f hour, stirring occasionally. When quite soft and smooth, let the water dry off, then mix in the curry powdei', sugar, and butter, and serve hot. They should be the consistency of mashed potatoes. Lentils, Indian Dahl. ] teaciipful each of Lentils, Milk, and Water, 1 teaspoonful Curry Powder, 1 Small Onion, Lemou .Tuice, H oz. Butter, Pej)per and Salt to taste.

Pare and cut in quarters, remove pulp, lay pieces in pie-dish, nearly cover with milk, and simmer till marrow is tender. Add a piece of butter, thicken with flour, add a little salt, and allow to boil up again in oven.TRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY BOOK. 63 VegretabiG Marrow, au Gratin. Semi-boil a couple of marrows, quarter them lengthwise; drain thoroughly, and place upon a well-buttered dish, previously nibbed with a slice of shallot or garlic. Sprinkle over well with grated Par- mesan cheese; pepi>er and salt, and a little grated nutmeg. Lay small pieces of butter hei'o and there; dust over identifully with bread crumbs. Bake 20 minutes, and sei've quite hot in the original dish. VegfGtable Marrow, Stuffed. 1 r,arge Vegetable Marrow, 2 large Onio'iie, 1 teaspoonfiil of Sage, a break- fastciipful soaked Oread, 1 oz. of Butter, 1 lilgg, Pepper oud Salt to taste. Trim the marrow, cut in lialvcs lengthwise, take out the seeds; parboil the onion, and chop it line; mix it with the bread, sage, butter, pepper, and salt. Fill the marrow witli tlie mixture, put botli halves together; brush liutter over them, and liake i hour. This is excellent; some vegetarians call it “vegetable I'oast duck.” Mushrooms. To distinguish mushrooms IVom j)oi.sonous fungi, sprinkle a little salt on the spongy part, or gills. If they turn yellow they are poison- ous ; if black, they are wholesome. Or peel an onion and put it with the fungi while being cooked. If tiie onion remains white, eat with, confidence; but if it turns black, it is not fit to eat. Use a silver s])o,on in cooking mushiooms. The silver will blacken if any injurious property is present. Never re-heat mush- rooms. If any are left over, throw them away. They are liable to develop injurious propei'ties. Grilled Mushrooms. Skin and jieel and remove stems. Put on a i)late, season with pepper and .salt.

Scatter chopped capers over the onions just before serving. May add a very little sugar when boiling. Onions, Stuffed. Take a large Spanish onion; scoop out the centre; peel and blanch it; fill centre with forcemeat, and place it in a stewpan. Cover it with slices of bacon; sprinkle with salt and pepper, and cool? over a quick fire. When done, remove the onions; reduce the sauce, and pour over, and serve. The forcemeat can be made of chicken, ham, parsley, mushrooms, and some chopped suet, all finely minced together, with pepper and salt to taste. Fried Parsley. Wash, pick, and dry the parsley; put it into a frying basket and immerse in hot fat 15 seconds, till crisp, keeping it green (if black, it has been too long in the fat), drain on soft paper and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Instead of keeping parsley in water, which often turns it yellow, put it in an air-tight jar in a cool place. This will keep it fresh for some time. Parsley must be quite dry. Parsnips. Cut lengthwise in halves. Put in plenty boiling water. Boil f hour, or till tender. Mix teaspoonful flour, teaspoonful butter, \ teacupful milk, pepper and salt. Stir till boiling, add parsnip, shake over fire till hot, and serve. Parsnips are much improved by being boiled in two waters. Pour off when half cooked, and put in fresh boiling water till tender.

Green Peas. peck peas, boiling water salted, sprig of mint. If peas are old, a teaspoonful moist sugar. No soda, as it causes peas to smash. Boil at a moderate rate for 16 or 20 minutes, and drain well. To Boil Dried Green Peas. pint peas soaked all night in water, with a little soda, and look over to see none worm-eaten. Pour off water next day and throw into boiling water, salted, and boil 1^ hours. Drain well and serve in vegetable dish with a small piece of butter and a little pepper added. Peas Pudding: (or German Lentil). 4 pint Peas soaked overnight. Boil the peas, whole or split, in a cloth loosely tied 2 or 3 hours, or till they are soft, then pidp them through a sieve. Add salt, pepper, butter, and some well-boiled potatoes, also passed through aTRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY BOOK: 65 sieve. Mix tliem all well together; tie them firmly in a cloth and boil I hour; then serve the pudding with melted butter. Potatoes—How to Boil. Select as near in size as possible. Barely cover with water. Add as much salt as tastes water. Bring slowly to boil. The larger the potatoes, boil the more slowly, because the heat takes longer to pene- trate to the heart. For very large potatoes, a little cold water may be added once or twice during boiling. Drain before skin cracks in the least, but not quite dry. Steam 5 to 10 minutes with lid on and a few minutes with it off. Potatoes best boiled with skin on, unless when unripe and just in, and when old and out of season, in spring and early summer. When pared, do so very thinly—right under the skin is all the rich potass which is so beneficial to the body. When old, let them lie in cold water some time before using after peeling. If small and large are cooked at same time, put on large ones 10 or 15 minutes before small. If new potatoes bo soaked in water in which a handful of salt has been dissolved, for a few minutes before scraping, the skin will come off’ much more easily, or rinse the potatoes, then place in a canvas bag with a little salt and a sprinkle of water. Then carefully fold over the mouth of the bag. Take hold of each end, well shake the potatoes from one* end to the other, and all the skins will be found to be removed. Thoroughly wash in clean water. To boil potatoes when watery, score the skin of the potato with a knife lengthwise and across, quite around, and then boil in plenty of water and salt and keep the skin on. The skin readily cracks when it is scored, and lets out the moisture which otherwise renders the potato soapy and wet. Water placed in pan directly over a red-hot fire will, of course, boil more vehemently, yet it will not cook meat nor potatoes any quicker and not so well as water that just keeps at the boiling point and quickly simmers. Potato Balls. Cold Potatoes, small piece Butter, Pepper and Salt, 1 yolk of Egg, if liked. Work potatoes and butter together with back of wooden spoon until smooth. Bind together with a little milk, sufficient to form into balls without breaking. Sprinkle a little flour over your hand, and form into balls free from cracks. Brush over with beaten egg, to which has been added the' pepper and salt, and toss in bread crumbs. Let them lie a few minutes before putting them in fat. Fry in boiling fat for 3 or i minutes. Potatoes, Casserole of. Take 1^ lb. mashed potatoes, add salt, pepper, ^ oz. butter and i egg. Mix all well; flour a board and form it into a cake, with pyramid in centre. Put it on a greased baking tin; brush it over with the other half egg, and bake ^ hour. Place cutlets or sausages round. This may also be'made with rice or macaroni. Potatoes, Maitre d’Hotel. Boil or steam pared potatoes, carefully drying them. For 12 potatoes take 2 ounces butter, a little chopped parsley, and mix c66 TRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY BOOK. together with knife. Siirinkle salt and pepper over potatoes, and place parsley and butter on top. Pota.to Ribbons. Wash and peel the potatoes, taking out the eyes and specks; peel them as you would an apple, very thinly into ribbons; lay in very cold water 1 hour before using, or overnight, if for breakfast. Dry place them in a frying basket, and fry them in boiling fat for about 6 minutes. Sprinkle with salt, dish them in a pyramid on a napkin. Potatoes, Savoury. 8 large Potatoes, 1 large Onion, 2 oz. Butter, i pint Water, teaspoonful Saae, Salt and Pepper. Pare potatoes and slice them ; chop onion fine ; grease a pie-dish. Put a layer of potatoes, sprinkle pepper and salt, sage, and onions. Place butter in pieces on the top, add water, and bake for 1| hours. Potato Souffle. Well wash 4 large potatoes and bake in oven for J hour; then cut off top, scoop out the potato with teaspoon, taking care not to break the skin; then pass potatoes through wire sieve. Take 3 ozs. of this, place in pan with \ ounce butter, ^ gill milk, the beaten yolk of 1 egg, and a little chopped parsley. Stir well, and add the whites of 2 eggs, switched to stiff froth. Half fill the potatoes, sprinkle a little grated cheese over, and bake 5 minutes. Baked Potatoes. Wash and peel the potatoes; if large, cut in half, put in dripping pan with plenty of beef dripping, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and bake a nice brown, turning occasionally. They require about 1 hour. Wlien mashing potatoes, to make them light and creamy, beat them well with a fork, adding a little hot milk. It is mixing them with cold milk that makes them stodgy and heavy. When frying potatoes, dredge a little flour over the potatoes be- fore frying, and they will cook much better and brown beautifully. Roast Potatoes. Scrub well. Prick all over. Bake 1 hour or till soft, or lay on grid shelf of gas oven and roast gently 30 or 40 minutes. Serve with salt butter. It is a good way to parboil the potatoes before roasting. This makes them crisper and more digestible. Pomme de Terre, au Gratis. Fill a Avell-buttered pie-dish with alternate layers of thinly- sliced potato and grated cheese. Dip each slice in a mixture of pepper, salt, and a little flour) add ^ teacupful of milk, and place a good-sized lump of butter on the top layer. Bake in a hot oven for 1 hour. Rice for Curry. 1 lb.

Turn all on to a hot dish, and put into a warm oven for 10 minutes or so to dry. Rice and curry must always be served piping hot and on separate dishes, and should always be eaten with a spoon and fork only—the meat being cooked till quite tender. To Boill Rice Dry (No. 2). Wash J lb. whole rice, and put it in a pot with 2 breakfastcup- fuls of water and a pinclx of salt. Let it boil about 20 minutes, covered closely with the lid and never stirred ; then it will be cooked and dry. Press it into a shape, and turn it out to use with meat instead of potatoes. OR, 1 breakfastcupful rice, well waslied and put on fire with three breakfastcupfuls water and a pinch of salt.

Carefully pick, wash, and put into pan that will just hold it. Sprinkle with salt and cover close. Set on fire, and shake frequently. When done, squeeze quite dry between two plates and beat it well with a bit of butter, or press into a mould, and serve with plain melted butter in a tureen. Any tender greens, beet, or turnip tops, kale, Ac., treat like spin- ach. When ready put in hot dish piece butter size of egg, \ teaspoon salt, saltspooh pepper, and, if liked, a tablespoonful vinegar. Kale, however, require 2 hours’ boiling. Tomatoes. To peel ripe tomatoes without puttjng in hot water, press the back edge of the blade of the knife gently all over the surface of tom- ato, then make an incision in the skin with the sharp edge of the knife, and it can be peeled off, and the tomato served immediately.&S TRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY BOOK.

Spread the croutons with a little chopped chutney beforehand, or mixed pickles; place tomatoes on top, sprinkle chopped parsley over, and serve very hot. Baked Tomatoes. Cut tomatoes in bits, and put layer of tliese and layer of bread crumbs. Dot top over with bits of butter and bake. Tinned toma- toes are almost as good, and thin slices of well-buttered bread may be used instead of crumbs. Stewed Tomatoes. ^ lb. Tomatoes, a little Butter or Dripping, Pepper, very little Salt, and a dessertspoonful Vinegar. Cut tomatoes in slices and lay in pan, with seasoning, and butter. Cover pan closely and stew gently till tender (30 or 40 minutes). When done, either add vinegar or not according to taste. . Stir well, boil up and serve. Stuffed Tomatoes. 6 Tomatoes, 3 tablespoonfuls Cooked Meat, 2 tablespoonfuls Bread Crumbs, 1 oz. Butter, and 1 Shallot, Pepper and Salt; 6 croiltons of Bread.

A salad dressing requires a spendthrift for oil, a judge for salt, a miser for vinegar, and a madman to mix them.—Spanish Proverb. French vinegar must always be used with oil. ' Malt vine- gar imparts a very disagreeable taste to the salad, for which the oil is often blamed. When preparing lettuce, place a little water in bottom of deep dish, and put in lettuces, then cover with muslin or thin calico, wetted, and they will keep_ beautifully crisp. Either tear up the lettuce with your fingers, or cut with a silver knife. Salad should not be too wet, and, when mixed, all the oil and vinegar should adhere to the lettuce, etc., -and not be in the bowl. Nothing but practice will teach the exact quantity of oil and vinegar to use. It is impossible to give the exact quantities, as the lettuce may vary in size. A salad in which cucumber is used will always be more moist than one made of lettuce alone. Beetroot Salad. 2 boiled Beetroots, 2 Eggs (hard boiled). Salt, Pepper, Oil, Vinegar.

BefoTe putting milk into pom to boil, put u little cold wciter in pan, bring to boil, and then add milk; this prevents milk catching. To prevent milk running over when it comes to the boil, put a spoon in. When you are cooking anything with milk, and require to add a little salt, do not put it in till the last, as it zvill curdle the milk. To scald milk, set it in a jug or basin in a pan of cold water over the fire- When the water boils the milk is scalded. Never leave a spoon in the saucepan if you wish the contents to cook quickly, and in any case a metal spoon should never be allowed to stand in a boiling saucepan contain- ing fruit or any acid. In steaming puddings keep them at a uniform heat all the time, and be careful not to lift the lid off' pan for the first hour. Never allow steamed puddings to boil too fast. If a souffle is boiled too fast it zvill be full of holes. Avoid lid on steamed pudding, mould, as that so seals pudding that none of the gas engendered by the cooking escapes, so it cannot be either so light or wholesome. • ’ ' , Batter puddings need quick oven. Buddings composed principally of milk and eggs should be very gently cooked, as a very strong heat will cause them to curdle. When beating whites of eggs add a tiny pinch of salt; this will make them froth much quicker, as zvell as make the froth stiffer. In stewing Fruit, prepare syrup first. Apportion water to your fruit as you desire much or little juice, and then sweetest to taste, generally \lb. sugar to i pint zvater. Bring to the boil, lay fruit in, simmer gently.

For green, a beautiful colour may be obtained from the expressed juice .of spinach-leaves'. For yellow, if a transparent colour be required, orange or lemon jelly dissolved ; if opaque, the poiinded yolks of eggs. For white, pounded almonds or arrowroot. Damson or other Plum Cheese.

To choose Flour take a handful, squeeze it; if it goes into a lumf it is good, because starchy; if it falls away it is bad. A bowl of water in the oven will prevent Pies, Cakes, &c., from burning. Remember that small cakes require oven hotter than large. Do not ofen door of oven for seven minutes for small cakes or fastry, and twenty minutes for large cakes—always opening or closing door very gently, as a sudden action is injurious. Test Cakes, &c., with Skewer or a clean broom straw, KJever move a cake in the oven until the centre is thoroughly set. Seed and pound cakes require rather a hot oven. Light sponge cakes and large cakes zvith baking powder require a moderate oven. A very light cake put in a quick oven rises rapidly round sides, but is hollow in the middle. Cakes burn be- cause the heat of the oven is not reduced after the cake has risen. In baking, a moderate oven is one which a teaspoonful flour will brown while you count thirty; a quick one, where only twelve can be counted. T0 beat butter to a cream, scald the fan, and well dry, before putting in butter and sugar. Will beat it much more easily. Lard is better to grease cake pans zvith than butter. The salt in butter causes the cake to stick. When icing a cake, an excellent plan is to dust a little dry flour over the top of cake before putting on the icing, as, if this is done, the icing is not so likely to run off. Never wash girdle or omelette pan; rub over zvith kitchen paper and salt. An apple kept in the cake box will keep moderately rich cake moist for a great length of time, if the apple be renezved when withered. Cut new bread with a. hot knife. Bakitigr Powder (Excellent). Take equal weights of rice-flour, bi-carbonate of soda, and pow- dered tartaric acid; mix thoroughly, pass through a sieve, and lieep in tins for use. For pastry, use 1 teaspoonful to 1 lb. flour; for cakes, 2 teaspoonfuls to 1 lb. flour. Bread (1). lbs. Flour, 2nds (one quartern), 1 oz. G-erman Yeast, 2 teaspoonfuls Salt.

When dough has risen sufficiently, work in the rest of the flour, kneading from outside, and poking down in centre, and being careful always to have plenty flour on hands, &c. Knead well until all flour is used up. Divide now in loaves (two), place in tins, &c., or on clean oven tray. ^ This may be floured or greased. Cut or score across bread to assist it to rise. Place near fire to rise, covered with cloth, for ^ hour, then bake for I, hour, trying with skewer to see if ready. Place tins in hottest pait of oven for 15 or 20 minutes, then if browning, turn, and gradually move aside to cooler part. Bread (2). li Ills, riour, 1 oz. Yeast, nearly 1 pint Water, 1 teaspoonful Salt. _ Cream yeast and salt, add warm water to it. Put flour in basin, make well in centre and nse enough flour just to make a sponge.

Pour over this J pint of boiling water in which 1 oz. of butter or dripping has been melted. Mix well with a spoon, then turn out on board and knead with the hands into a round. Take the rolling pin and roll out very thin, taking care tb dust the pin well with meal to keep it from sticking. Nick nicely round edges with finger and thumb. Cut in four. Have the girdle nice and hot, bring it to the edge of the board, and slip the cakes on to it. Fire on cne side until edges begin to curl up, then toast the other side in front of the fire. An hour or two in a moderately hot oven makes them nice and dry and crisp. Prepared Flour (Self-Raising:). Put half-a-stone of flour into a basin; mix with the flour IJ oz. carbonate of soda, and exactly the same weight of cream of tartar. Add also 3 teaspoonfuls of fine salt, and 1 tablespoon fine sugar. Mix, and pass through wire sieve, or very carefully with the hand. Will keep good in a covered crock for weeks. In winter, when the butter- milk is not so acid, 2 oz. cream of tartar will be required for 1^ oz. of soda. For 4 teacupfuls of this prepared flour, add 1 breakfastcup of butter-milk; a dessertspoon of butter rubbed into the flour is a great improvement. . Prepared Flour for Scones. 4 lb. Flour, 2 oz.

It is the juice of the meat that contains the nourishment. The juice is much the same as the zvhite of an egg, and contains albumen. Every one knows if the white of an egg is boiled hard it becomes indigestible. So is juice for beef tea. If one is strong and well it is all right, but tvhen sick, the stomach is not cTble nor strong enough to digest it. Salt is added to loosen the fibre, and so helf the juices of the meat to leak out into the water. The meat is finely shred, so that the juices may more easily leak out. Cold water must be added; hot water woidd coagulate the albuminous farts of 'the meat, and prevent juices getting out. Any fat on beef tea must be removed with kitchen paper. “ The secret of success in making beef tea is not to cook it too fast." Beef Juice. Broil a thick piece of steak 3 minutes. Squeeze all juice out with a lemon squeezer into a cup. Salt veiy lightly, and give like beef tea. Beef Tea (cheap). ' 2 lb. Hough, or Shin of Beef. Take out the bone, remove the fat, and cut the meat into pieces about an inch square. Put these into a basin or jar, with a slight seasoning of pepper and salt, and a sprig or two of green parsley. Add pint of cold water, cover closely, and put into a quick oven. May be put in about 6 or 7 in the evening, when there is a good fire, and allowed to remain all night. When cold in the morning, take off any fat, and remove the meat. You need not strain the liquor, some of which may be just warujed up, not boiled, as required for use. The quantity of water will depend on the condition of the patient. If very weak, and only able to take a teaspoonful or so at a time, a half pint will be quite sufficient; if the tea is to be taken as a strengthen- ing draught by a convalescent, twice that quantity, or even more, may be used. Beef Tea (slowly made). 1 lb. lean Beef (freshly killed meat from top of the round), 1 pint Cold Water, small pinch Salt, if allowed. Cut beef in thin strips, and shred with knife on board. Put in jar with salt and water, stir well with fork ; stand for 2 hours, stir- ring occasioually to draw out all albumen. Place buttered paper over, to prevent steam condensing and adding to its bulk, and. stand in pan of boiling water half-way up jar. Simmer 2^ hours; give final stir when takeTi out, and strain through coarse strainer, pre.ssing out beef tea with fork. Another Good Recipe. Take some very lean beef, cut it into small pieces, removing any fat, and put into a stone jar, more than covering it with water. Allow this to stand 12 hours; next put it into the oven to stew slowly for 3 hours, or in saucepan with water, and steam 3 hours.TRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY BOOK. 175 Beef Tea (Diabetic). 1 lb.

Break raw egg into basin of cold water and let it soak there 12 hours. Strain off water very carefully, and poach egg in boiling water with a little salt.

Egfg: with Tea, Coffee, Cocoa, or Milk. 13i-eak the egg into a- teacup, beat with a foi-k till well mixetl. Pour in the tea, coffee, cocoa, or milk, gradually, Stirling all the time. This is very nourishing and good in cases of exliaustion from overwork or mental strain. Tea is of value in the sick-room;, if propeiiy prepared, and if not Used after G'o’clock in the evening. It is peculiarly refreshing after a restle.ss night. Tea must be made with freshly-boiled water’, which is just in the act of boiling over. Good tea cannot be made Avitli water that has been standing on the stove and boiling for’ some time. The teapot must be well heated with boiling water before the tea is put in. Put in immediately a teaspoonful of tea, add about ^ pint of fi’eshly-boiled water, let it stand in a warm place for .‘1 or I- minutes, pour off. Do not let it stand on the hob, as t:eai stewed oi’ boiled is most hui’tful. It is very much improved if the milk taken with it is liot, especially if the person to drink it is going on a jornriioy or likely to bo subject to great fatigue. Tea made with boiling milk instead of water will be found a most sustaining and delicious beverage. Cori’EB.—To make a cpiar’t of coffee take 2 m. good coffee, 1^ pints water, 1 pint milk, tiny pinch salt, arrd as nruch dry ri.ustaird as will lie on a shilling. Boil the water. Take hot dry jug (don’t rinse), put in coffee, salt, and mustard, and stir with fork. Pour boiling water over and stir well with fork. Stand to clear till you boil milk.

Put oatmeal in basin and pour cold water over. Let it soak 20 or 30 minutes. Then with a spoon press all the flour from the oatmeal, and pour into the pan, leaving meal as dry as possible. Keep stirring till it boils. Boil very slowly, with a pinch of salt, for 16 or 20 minutes. You may use milk instead of water to cook it, or half milk and water. If butter is allowed, you may put it in basin, before you pour gruel in ; or if you want sweet gruel, put sugar in before pouring gruel in. Water gruel or weak tea assists perspiration; milk and coffee retard it. Effervescing: Gruel. An old advice, when a person has got a slight cold is—take an oatmeal gruel and go to bed. Some mix into the gruel, after the meal is strained out, a bit of fresh butter and a little sugar. But an effer- vescing gruel is not well known. When the gruel is prepared in the usual manner, and the meal strained off, sufficient boiling water and milk is added to make the gruel thin enough to drink from a break- fast cup. Then have ready the juice of the lemon, strained. Put in the gruel as much carbonate of soda as will cover a sixpence. Stir in the lemon juice and drink the gruel during effervescence.' This will counteract a chill and help to produce sleep. Invalids’ Jelly. 1 oz. Q-elatinc, 3 oz. Lump Sugar (or to taste), 1 Egg, 1 pint cold Water, \ pint Orange Juice or Lemooi Juice (to taste).

Change each night and morning, and in a few days the com can be taken out without any pain. After corn has been taken cut, continue the leaves for a day «r two, in order to remove any little hardness that may remain.TRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY BOOK. 192 A piece of lemon bound over a corn, and changed daily for 3 days, will loosen a corn so much that it may easily be removed if the foot is first soaked for a few minutes in warm water.

When tender, strip off the skin and squeeze out the juice by twisting in a thin cloth. Bottle and save for use. When needed, pour one or two drops in a spoon, waiun a little, and drop into the ear. Afterwards put in a bit of wann cotton to exclude the air. It rarely, if evei', fails to effect a speedy cure. Good Disinfectants. For travelling, take a Is box of permanganate of potash. Being dry, there is no chance of spilling, and water to mix it can always be had. It is most useful as a mouth wash or gargle. To make Condy’s fluid, 1 oz. to a gallon of water. Camphor is also most valuable. A few lumi^s packed in one’s box prevent unpleasant visitors, all too common in warm climates. Remedy for Dysentery. 1 egg, 1 teaspoonful sugar. Beat egg and sugar very lightly, and swallow at one gulp if possible. It soothes the inflammation in the stomach and intestines, and forms a transient coating to these organs till gradually the disease is removed. 2, or even 3, eggs a day may be used in this way, and patient kept very quiet, with very light diet other than the egg. Quick Cure for Earache. Take a small piece cotton wool, make a depression in centre witli the Anger, and All the indentation with as much ground pepper as will rest on a 3d piece.

If yotir own dress, tlirow yourself at once on the ground (so that the rising haanes may not catch the upper part of your clothes, nor burn your head and chest); roll about (so putting the flames out by pressure); and at Uie same time, if possible, wrap yourself up closely in a rug, hearth rug, blanket, table cloth, overcoat, or carpet (so as to smother the fire.) Do not get up to call for assistance, but for that purpose crawl to the bell rope or door. If another person’s dress, throw the pei'son on fire down at once, wrap him or her up in a rug or something similar, or, if there is no- thing at hand suitable, use your own coat, rolling the patient about in it (for the purpose of smothering the flames). A woman rendering help in this way must exercise grea.t self-possession, and be careful not to get her own clothes entangled in the flames. Fomentation (1). For fomenting a knee, foot, or ankle, a good-sized half blanket is neoessaiy. Fold this one way till it is 20 inches broad ; lay it out on a table, and sprinkle sparingly boiling water across one end.

Put sufficient bran in hot basin ; pour boiling water, by little ana little into the bran, and mix and stir it up till it is all a moist mass, but not wet. The great thing is to avoid using more water than bran can easily absorb. Fill flannel bag ready for purpose, and fasten with binder; one or tw'O tablespoonfuls mustard may be added if .great power is required, not otherwise. Bread Poultice. Take slice of bread without crust—better than little bits—put in basin, and pour boiling water over; cover with plate, and let it stand by fire; strain, break with fork, spread, and a}]tply, with nothing be- tween poultice and skin. Carrot Poultice. Most useful for relieving pain, &c.; good for crashed finger or knocked knee—takes pain aw'ay in a few minutes; good also for stye.

Have ready a board to make poultice on, two basins, a piece of calico rather larger than required, a broad knife, piece of macintosh or oiled silk, to cover, a piece of thin soft muslin, and a flannel binder. Pour thoroughly boiling water into one basin, then into the other. This heats the basin you are going to use. Then pour in sufficient boiling water, say one large breakfastcupful; stir in linseed meal as for porridge, stirring quickly all the time; when stiff enough, spreadTRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY BOOK. 195 on foundation very quickly a,nd evenly witli broad knife, wetting knife with hot water from other basin, and putting a few drops over poultice when finislied, to prevent it sticking. Lay the muslin over it, turning the edge all round well over the calico to prevent linseed com- ing out. Have ready the oiled silk, lay the poultice on it, calico side downwards, then double poultice over, covered with the oiled silk. It will keep veiy hot some minutes. Put on wann platter, and take to bedside; before putting on patient, unroll the poultice, and try the heat with the back of the hand; if bearable, poultice is not too hot. In laying the poultice on, apply the lower edge first. A poultice covered with oiled silk (it must quite cover it) will remain hot quite four hours. The poultice must not be made too thick or dry, or it will bo heavy and uncomfortable, and, as in the case of pneumonia with high temperatui’o, will increase the temperature instead of help- ing to lower it, as a light and wet poultice will do, by means of evapor^ ation; do not pour water on meal, or poultice will be heavy. It is a good thing first to rub with hot olive oil the part of skin where poultice is to be applied; and if part poulticed is tender from frequent poultie- iti^, &o., put layer of flannel between it and skin. If constant potil- ticing is necessaiy, have two pieces of oiled silk, as it doubles up and contracts in a very tiresome way. When it does so, )ilac6 in a basin of tepid or cold water and gently pull straight; then wipe diy and it is ready for future use. If from accident, a patient has to wait some time after poultice is remoiTd before another is ready, cover the part affected with cotton wool or warm flannel. Mustard Poultice. Mix half and half mustard and linseed (dry), and sprinkle into the water the same as fora linseed poultice. (3 tablespoonfuls of each will make a good-sized poultice.) Porridge Poultice. (Clieaper than linseed, and almost as good.) Have boiling water in pan, and stir in oatmeal; to be just thick enough to pour out; ready in ten minutes. Potato Poultice. Boil 4 or 5 potatoes in their skins till soft, put them in an old white cotton stocking, and ciaisli with the hands to flatten. Apply at once to the throat. Excellent for sore throat, &c. Buchanan’s Prune Paste. INVALUABLE IN THE HOME. J lb. Prunes, i lb. Brown Sugar, 1 oz. Senna Powder. Place prunes with sugar and J pint of water in pan. Stew for one hour, watching to maintain the quantity of syrup in pan by adding more water if necessary. Pom- syrup into jelly can. Allow to stand until lukewantij then stir into it tlie senna powder until it becomes a fine paste. 'This forms a most agreeable medicine to the taste, easily carried when travelling, and invaluable in chronic constipation if taken at bed-time, and it is not a purgative. Children all like it. Dose for children, ^ teaspoonful; adults, one teaspoonful.196 TRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY BOOK. Ring^wortn Ointment. 2d Linseed Oil, 3d White Wax, Id Eed Precipitate Powder. Mix well for 1 hour .over a good fire. Will cure after a few appli- cations. Scalds. Cover with rags soaked in strong solution of carbonate of soda and water. For any Sore or Gathering'. 1 teaspoonful Calendula, i oz. Glycerine, and 6 tablespoonfuls Water. ‘' Apply lotion on linen rag. To Prevent the Skin from discolouring after a fall. Take a little dry starch or arrowroot, moisten it with a little cold frater and lay on the aflEected part. This must be done immediately, so, as to prevent the actioar of the air on the skin. Stings. If mouth or throat is stung, keep chewing raw onion till doctor comes. It is not necessai'y to swallow onion, but chew it well to ex- tract the oil, and then put it out. For stings of gnats, apply 1 part carbolic acid and 3 parts vinegar. Next day it will be quite away. A Good Spring Medicine for Children. Take ^ oz. Senna leaves, ^ oz. of manna., and pour over it ^ pint of boiling water. Into this put ^ lb. of prunes or tigs, and 2 large table spoonfuls of golden syrup. Stew gently till liquid is nearly absorbed. Pass through a sieve and put into a pot for use. Dose, a teaspoonful when required. . For Nursery Bedrooms. Keep one or two strong sacks about 3^ feet in depth and IJ in diameter, held open at top by thick wooden hoop, and having a very long strong rope attached. In case of tire, children may be let down safely. Rules for a Water Bed. Only fill half full, and use warm water to prevent chilling patient. To Restore Voice. When the voice is lost from the effects of a cold, a simple remedy —Beat up the white of an egg; add to it the juice of a lemon, and sugar to taste. Take a teaspoonful from time to time. Or, gargle the throat with warm olive oil eveiy four hours (a few times will cure). For a cough a baked lemon is an excellent remedy. Put it into a moderate oven and let remain till soft. Mix together an equal quan- tity of honey and the juice of the baked lemon, and take a teaspoonful, which should be lukewa.nn, whenever the cough is troublesome. For Hoarseness.—Lemon juice squeezed to soft sugar till like a syrup, and a few drops glycerine added—relieves at once. Tooth Powder. 1 lb. rough prepared chalk to be put in a large jar. Fill up with cold water; stir well; allow to settle. Pour off the miUt into another vessel, and leave it (the milk) to stand a day and night,TRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY KOOK. 19? when fine ohalk will be precipitated. Pour off the water, and sediment at bottom will be the finest tooth powder in the world. Add a few drops of eau-de-cologne if liked. In order to prevent decay, the teeth should be carefully brushed at least once a day, preferably at night, but, better still, after each meal. There is no better dentifrice than pure soap, and M'Clinton’s tooth soap being specially prepared from the ash of plants and a pure vegetable oil, does not leave the objectionable soapy taste in the mouth which all soda soaps do.—Dr Kirk. A Good and Cheap Mouth Wash. For preserving tlie teeth, few things are better than a glass of water, in which ^ teaspoonful of bi-carbonate of soda has been dis- solved. Brush the teeth with this solution. Mouth-Wash. Id worth Chlorate of Potash, Id of Borax, Id of Camphor. Put in quart bO'ttlo and pour boiling water over. The potash cools, the borax cleans, and the camphor gives refreshing perfume. Use 1 tablespoonful to 2 tablespoonfuls of water to brush teeth. Another Excellent Mouth-Wash. To a pint of boiling soft water add one ounce of borax, and before it is entirely cold add thirty drops of the spirits of camphor, one drachm of soap-tree bark, and twenty drops of cinnamon essence; bottle and cork tightly for use. This preserves the teeth and gums, removes the tartar, arrests decay and malces teeth veiy white. When used add two or three teaspoonfuls of the liquid tO' as much tepid water. Apply with a soft brush. Chlorate of Potash Gargrle. For relaxed sore throat and inflamed tonsils. Get 2 oz. chlorate of potash from chemist and put in tumbler of cold water. Only a portion will dissolve, but each time, after gargling with the solution, fill up the tumbler with fresh water, until the whole of the potash has been dissolved. Keep tumbler covered with paper. Hair Wash. strong Liquor Ammonia, 1 oz.; Spirit of Eosemary, 3 oz.; Tincture of Cantharides, 1 oz.; Almond Oil, 1 oz.; Lavender Water, 2 oz. Mix and apply to the roots of the hair with a piece of sponge or a fine brush, when the hair is falling off. To Promote the Growth of the Hair. Equal quantities of olive oil and spirit of rosemary ; a few drops of oil of nutmeg. Mix ingredients together, rub the roots of the hair every night with a little of this liniment, and the growth of it will very soon sensibly increase. The following is also recommended for strengthening and promot- ing the growth of the hair:—Mix cantharides with castor oil in the proportion of one. drachm to each ounce of oil, and apply once a day.198 TRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY BOOK. JAMS & JELLIES. Stir jam ivith wooden spoon. Do not mistake the froth that rises during the earlier fart of the operation for scum. The real scum rises when the jam boils, and is very thick, but to skim the jam from the first is unnecessary and wasteful. Let jam boil rapidly—not merely simmer. Store all jam in a cool, dry place; as free from draught, and of as even a temperature as possible. Damp may turn it mouldy, heat make it ferment. Apple Jam. (Greening Apples best, as they do not fall.) To every lb. of Fruit, weighed after being pared, cored, and sliced, allow J lb. of Preserving Sugar, the grated Rind of a Lemon, the Juice of i Lemon. Peel the apples, core and slice them vei-y thin, and be particular that they are all the same sort. Put thein into a jar, stand this in a saucepan of boiling water, and let the apples stew until tender. Put the apples into a preserving pan, add the sugar, with the grated rind and lemon juice, simmer over the fire for ^ Imur, reckojing from the time the jam begins to boil well all over. Remove the scum as it rises, and when the jam is done put it into pots for use, tie it down to keep the air from it; this jam will Iceep good a long time. Apple Jam that will keep for Years. Weigh equal quantities of brown sugar and good sour apples; pare, core, and chop them fine; make a good clear syrup of the sugai'. Add the apples, the juice and grated rind of 3 lemons, and a few pieces of white ginger. Boil it till the apple looks clear and yellOw; this resembles foreign sweetmeats. On no account omit the ginger. Apple Jelly. (An American Recipe.) Take 7 lb. of apples^—the hard green ones with red cheeks are thO best—wash them, but neither peel nor core them. Cut tliem up rough- ly and remove the tops and tails. Put the apples into a preserving pan with a little more than sufficient water to float them. Boil steadily for 1. hour. Tliey should stir quite easily, so if they get too' stodgy add a little more water. Let it drip through a jelly-bag all night. In the morning add 1 lb. of white sugar tO' each pint of juice, and a little essence of lemon. Boil for | hour, stirring and skimming fre- quently with a wooden, spoon. Do not be alanned if it is not quite stiff when put away; it will soon stiffen in a cool cupboard. Best made in October. The Americans' make it of wild crab apples, and the bright red of their skins makes the jelly a most beautiful colour. Black currants and orreen gooseben’ies treated in the same way make excellent jelly. Apricot Jam (Imitation). 3 lb. Apples (Scotch Cocllins), 3 lb. Plums (Victoria), 3 lb. Pears (largo table), 1 oz. whole Ginger. Paz’e, core, and cut in pieces the apples and pears; stone, skin, and halve the plums. Make a syrup, put the fruit in and boil till tender, keeping it as whole as possible. Take out the ginger before lifting the jam.TRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY BOOK. 199 Black Currant Jam.

Green Gooseberry Jelly. To i pints gooseberries give 3 pints water (always 1 pint less water than gooseberries); boil to a mash, then strain through cheesecloth. Take 1 lb. sugar to every pint of juice, but keep out a little sugar to throw in about 7 minutes before taking it off; this improves the colour wonderfully. Boil J hour, then flavour with essence of lemofi. Marmalade. 30 Seville Oranges, Sugar, 2 Lemons. Cut oranges and lemons right through, peel and all, into thin shces, removing seeds. Cut with a knife and fork the rind of the slices just roughly to make chips, and weigh fruit thus out, and to every»lb. add 3 pints cold water. Put in earthenware vessel, and let' stand for 24 hours.

To each lb. of sliced fiaiit, add 3 pints of cold water ; let stand 24 hours; then boil it until the chips are tender, pour it into an earthenware bowl, and let it stand till next day. Now weigh it, and to every lb. of boiled pulp add 1^ lb. of Imnp sugar; boil all together till the syrup jellies and the chips are rather transpai'ent. In taking out the pips, be careful to leave in all the white pith, as this goes towards making the syrup. Good Marmalade Jelly. 4 lb. Seville Oranges, 4 Lemons, 5 lb. Crystallised Sugar. Pare the rind very thin from 6 of the largest oranges and out into slender chips, and boil slowly for hour in a pint of water. Take away rind, white, and pips from the other oranges and lemons. Break up the pulp with your hands into 3 pints of water and boil gently ^ hour. Then strain through a bag. Put the chips and water they were boiled m to this liquid into the pan, with the sugar, and boil 30 minutes. Remove all scum.

Pull a table up to the fii-e (so that you can beep one eye on the jelly), get a friend to help you if you can, and start cutting the skins with clean scissors, again choosing the finest and thinnest, and cutting them as finely as possible. 10 minutes before the jelly is done, throw in as many or as few of the chips as you like. It is equally good without any chips at all. Best made in March or April. Parsley Jelly. Take a quantity of fresh parsley, well washed. Put in jelly-pan, cover with cold water, and press down lightly. Boil gently for about ^ hour, and pour it twice thix)ugh a jelly-bag. To each pint of juice add 1 lb. sugar.

This is a veiy cooling drink, and costs about 2d a quart. Note.—One lemon is about equal to 10 drops of essence of lemon, or to I drachm of citric acid. If essence of lemon is used in place of lemon, it should be mixed when it is lukewann. A good harvest drink.—Boil oz. hops and oz. ginger (bruised) in 1^ gallons of water for 25 minutes; add 1 lb. of best brown sugar, and boil 10 minutes more; then strain, and bottle while hot.

The bad way is that which they generally follow, viz., to swallow a large quantity at once. When milk goes into the stomach it is in- stantly curdled, and if it is curdled into one big mass, the juices of the stomach can work on only the outside of it. This is the reason that many people who like milk, and to whom it should be of the utmost benefit, cannot drink it. They say it gives them indigestion, and they are right. Let them give it another chance. But this time they must sip it slowly, not taking more than a good teaspoonful at one sip, and taking at least four minutes to finish the glassful. Each little sip thus becomes curdled up by itself when it passes into the stomach, the digestive juices percolate freely around it, and it speedily becomes assimilated. One of the best restoratives known after excessive fatigue, and one infinitely preferable to any fomi of alcohol, is a glass of hot milk. The heat seems to lighten it, and to deprive it of much of the sweetness which is so cloying tO' some tastes. A little bread should always be taken with milk. Oatmeal Drink (1). ' 1 heaped teaspoonful oatmeal at bottom of tumbler Pour a little cold water over, and stir well; fill up half way with boiling water, then to the top with boiling milJe; season with salt. (Splendid for nursing mothers ) Oatmeal Drink (2). When placed by the side of any alcoholic drink it shows itself in- finitely superior, and much cheaper, Take of fine oatmeal ^ lb.; coarse sugar lb.; ground ginger ounce; essence of lemon 30 drops ; boiling water 1 gallon. Pour the boiling water over the other ingred- ients, stirring well all the time, then boil the whole for about 3 min- utes. A thicker and more nourishing drink can be made by adding ^ or f lb. of oatmeal to the gallon of water. Oatmeal Drink (3). Mil 4 ounces of oatmeal with 9 qiiarts of cold water.

Strain througli a hair sieve, and, whilst still hot, sweeten to taste with brown sugar. Wlien cooled, add 1 ounce of tar- taric acid or ^ ounce of citric acid. Serve when cold. This quantity will keep good foi- 2 or 3 days in a dry, cool place. Orangfe Syrup. Select ripe and thin slcinned fruit; squeeze .juice, add to every pint 1^ lb. sifted sugar. Boil it slofwly, and skim as long as any scum rises; you may then take it off; let it grow cold, and bottle. Be sura to secure corks well. 2 tablespoonfuls of this syrup mixed in melted butter makes admirable sauce to plum, &c., puddings, and imparts fine flavour to custards. Peppermint Cordial. 1 lb.

CONFECTIONS. For all Sweet-making operations a plat slab or marble is better than a dish, and a very little butter will be needed to rub on. Use Cox's gelatine for sweet dishes. Salted Almonds. Take a small pan and enough butter to make it 1 inch deep when melted. Get it to boiling heat (try it by putting a piece of bread in to brown). After blanching the almonds throw them all'in at once, so that they all brown alike. Mix some salt and a little cayenne to- gether on a paper. Take out the almonds and roll them in it, shak- ing Ihem well till nearly cold Barley Sug-ar. 1 lb. Loaf Sugar broken email, ^ pint Water, and White of an Egg, flavouring •f Lomon or Vanilla. Put sugar and water into pan. When dissolved put over moder- ate fire, and when just beginning to wann add beaten white of egg. Stir well, and when boiling remove scum, and boil till perfectly clear.

Rub the saucepan with butter and pour in as much treacle as may be wanted. Let it boil gently until a small portion will break between, the teeth after being thrown into cold water. When this ^joint is reached, take pan at once off fire, or it will quickly acquire a burnt taste. Pour on a buttered dish, and when cool roll it into sticks, and fold in clean white paper. The toffee may bo flavoured with essence of peppermint, almond, or lemon, and a Jit,tie cayenne pepper thrown into treacle toffee is an excellent cure for a cough.

A few drops of lemon juice will mitigate the pain of a bee sting. A headache may be relieved by rubbing the temples with a slice of lemon. A corn or bunion may be relieved thus:—After bathing the afflicted foot in hot water, a few drops of lemon juice on the toe will be found very soothing. There is nothing better for breaking up a cold than juice of lemon, when boiled for 2 minutes, and taken as hot as possible at bedtime215 TRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY BOOK. To Keep Oi'a.ng'es and Lemons.

Pull all the leaves off,- and rub them through a coarse sieve, and bottle for use, or tie in bunches by the stems, and hang up till dry; then put in paper bag for use. Mushrooms may be dried slowly in same way and laibbed through sieve. Excellent for adding to soups and stews. To Keep Eggs. Be sure they are fresh. If possible have them rubbed over with butter whenever laid. Place them points down in a stone jar and pour over them the following brine, which is enough for 160 : —1 pint slacked lime, 1 pint salt, 2 oz. cream of taiTar, and 4 gallons water.

To Use up Dry Bread. Brown in oven every scrap that is left, Ijiit don’t scorch. Roll while hot and crisp, and sift. Use tlie fine crumbs for croquettes, &c., the coarser for puddings, &c. Keep dry in glass jars or tin cans. To Sweeten Rancid Butter. Melt the butter and skim it. Then put into it a piece of toast free from burn. In a‘ few minutes it will lose its offensive^aste and smell, which the toast has absorbed. To Keep Food Hot. Instead of putting food into the oven to keep hot for late comers, tiy covering it closely with a tin or plate, and setting it over a sauce- pan of hot water. Tliis plan will keep the food hot, and at the same time prevent it from, drying. Vanilla Pods have a much better flavour than the essence. Stir the pod among the substance to be flavoured till it has enough, then wash pod in 2 or 3 waters, and dry for future use. Will last a long time. To Keep a Larder Sweet. Place a pan of charcoal in it, for it helps greatly to keep eveiy- thing sweet and wholesome. To Test Tinned Vegetables. Open the tin and plunge into its contents a bright steel knife. Let it remain a few moments, when, if copper be present, even in the most minute pix>portion, it will be visibly deposited on the blade. This is an unfailing test. Management of Gas Stove. With proper proportion of gas and air it burns blue. It then gives more heat, and is cheaper than when it lights back and burns white, and also keeps pans cleiiner. Wait till it bums red for toast. Close and open oven door gently, especially when tap is Ioav. Furniture Polish (1). 6 oz. Bees' Wax, 2 oz. White Wax, 3 oz. Castile Soap, 2 pints Turpentine, 2 pints Boiling Water.

Remove from the fire, and stir occasionally until it is quite cold, when it should be like very thick cream. It can be kept in the jar, but if you have old pickle bottles it is better to pour it into' them when still warm, and occasionally stir until quite cold. It will keep for years, and is better old than new. Before polisliing furniture, wash it with clean, cold water, and polish with new chamois leather. Oak or varnish paint, same way.

Dissolve in 1 gallon boiling water 1;^ lbs. washing soda and \ lb. borax. In washing clothes, allow cup of this to every gallon of water. To Cure a Sheepskin. Rub skin well with twO' handfuls salt and lb. pounded alum. Take one-half of skin first; roll it up and let it lie for three days. Take some chalk and spread it over, and rub well with a sandy stone. Repeat on remainder of skin with rest of salt and alum, &c. Nail it up on door of outhouse or airy place to dry thoroughly, and afterwards wash it with soap and tepid water. Facts about Salt. It is wonderful how many things salt may be used for. It is a capital remedy for rheumatism if taken regularly in a glass of cold water before breakfast. A nightly gargle of salt and w^ater strength- ens a weak throat, and keejDS off bronchitis. When eaten with nuts it aids digestion, and it will relievo heartburn if taken in cold water. It is also a good thing for burns, and for stings of bee®, wasps, &c.; if a thick plaster of wet salt is tied on the place it will take the pain out. If the chimney gets on fire throw salt on the fire. If there has been anything bunit in the oven throw salt in, and it will take all smeU away. When soot drops on the carpet throw salt’on it, and then, sweep it up. If salt is thrown on a carpet before sweeping, the colours will be brighter. If it is rubbed on silver, china, or earthenware, it will take stains of teh, eggs, burns, &c., off. If applied at once it will takeTRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY BOOK. 219 but ink stains. In washing coloured clothes, if a handful is put in the water the colour will nedther run nor fade. If used in frosty weather on doorsteps, bricks, &b., it fills the place of ashes, and is much clean- er. Among its many uses it will kill weeds on gravel walks. Damp Beds. To ascertain if beds are damp, place a looking-glass between the sheets for a few minutes. If upon its removal the glass be clouded, it may bo relied on that the sheets are not sufficiently dried, and they had better be removed, for it is bettor to put up with the discomfort of sleeping in the blankets than to stand the chance of catching cold or perhaps rheumatism. Chimney on Fire. To extinguish fire in chimney, shut the door and window of the room, throw a few handfuls of salt on the burning soot in the bhimney, then sprinkle a handful of sulphur on the fire, and immed- iately pin a cloth saturated with water over the front of the fireplace To Waterproof Cloth, Coats, Cloaks, Shawls, &c. Dissolve 2 oz. sugar of lead in 2 quarts of water. In anofliei* vessel dissolve 2 oz. alum in 2 quaits of water. When they are both dissolved pour one into the other, and stir them with a stick until they are well mixeil. Then let the mixture settle, and when a white deposit is formed at the bottom, pour off gently the clear liquid into another vessel, leaving the deposit behind. Put the cloth or garment into the clear liquid, and leave it there to soak for some hours, turn it over a few times before taking out, and then hang it up to dry. Polish for Ladies’ Boots. Mix equal proportions of sweet oil, vinegar, and treacle, and 1 oz. lamp black. When all the ingredients are thoroughly incorporated, rub on boots and place them in a cool place to dry. Brunswick Black for Grates. 1 lb Common Aspbaltum, i pint Liuseed Uil, 1 quart Oil of Turpentine. Melt the asphaltum and add gradually to it the other ingredients. Apply with a small painter’s bnish, and leave grates to' become dry. Polish for Steel. 1 tablespoonful tui’pentiue and 1 do. sweet oil. Mix and stir in sufficient emery powder to' make mixture the thickness of cream. Put on steel with soft flannel, rub off quickly with another piece, and then polish with emery powder and a clean leather. To Clean Bottles, Discolourations, and green marks from vegetation, &c., may be removed from bottles thus : —Put into the bottle a raw potato cut into small pieces, with a tablespoonful of salt and twice that amount of water; shake well until the stains are removed, then rinse in clear water. Stains of all kinds may be removed by rinsing the bottles first with muriatic acid (spirits of salt) and afterwards with clear water.220 TRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY BOOK. LAUNDRY WORK. Washing: and Starching: of Collars & Cuffs. It has been my frivilege to know many economical and thrifty housekee-pers, and 1 have discovered that most of them^ after varied experience^ prefer, if possible, to have the washing and dressing of their linen done under their own supervision. The clothes, they say, are always a better colour, and do not wear out so quickly when done at home. The only objection in many cases is that the dressing of the starched linen is not so effectually done as that by a professional laundress. In the few following remarks I hope to describe a simple method which, if carefully carried out, will enable any of my readers to get up her linen so as to look almost like new.—MARGARET C. Rankine, Liverpool. The Washing: of Starched Linen. Before touchhig upon the method of starching and ironing, let me give a few important hints ooncerning the washing of starched linen. First of all it ought to be steep^ in cold water to soften thoroughly the old starch, so that it may be easily removed by wash- ing. This is of considerable importance, as much rubbing tends to wear out the fabric. The linen should then be washed well in hot water with hard soap until all starch has been rubbed out, then rinsed before boiling, tO' Leep the water in the boiler clean, boiling being done to improve the colour of clothes. AVheii opportunity affords, the linen, after boiling, should be taken out of the soapy water and put in the open air for a few hours to bleach. Sunshine is the best bleaching agent. It must then be rinsed in a good supply of clean water and slightly blued, and thoroughly dried, when it is ready for starching. Hot Water Starch. 1 tablespoonful Starch to 2 tablespoonfuls Cold Water. Break starch down with this water. It is better to put in too little water than too much, as you can add a little, and you cannot make good starch with too much water in it. See that there are no lumps, and take starch over to the kettle to be sure water is absolute- ly boiling, and pour in the boiling water till starch is blue and clear, stirring well all the time. A piece of soap the size of a marble may be added when making staich, and starch stirred till soap is thoroughly dissolved. Gives a lovely gloss and prevents iron sticking. Recipe for Cold Water Starch. 1 tablespoonful of Starch, 1 breakfastcupful of Md Water, i teaspoonful of Turpentine, 1 small teaspoonful of Borax (dissolved in hot water). If too much turpentine were added it would scorch linen.TRIED EAVOVRITES COOKERY BOOK. 221 Method of making' Starch. Put the starch, tiu’pentine, and a little of the water into a clean basin, and mix to a smooth paste. Add the remainder of the water, then the borax, carefully keeping back any sediment that may be at the bottom of the cup. Mix, and the starch is ready to use. As collars and cuffs are usually made vei'y stiff, it is necessaiy to use cold water starch as a stiffening agent. The foregoing is a reliable recipe, and if the proportions are carefully measured, espec- ially those of starch and water, there will not be the slightest difficulty in making the linen look very nice indeed. Another Cold Water Starch. 6 tablespoonfuls Cold Water Starch. Mix smooth in a little water; smooth it out with hand (better than spoon). Add water gradually till quite thin and milky. Put in small bowl 1 teaspoonful turpentine, about 1^ inch lump borax, a lump of ammonia about the size of two beans, and a little starch glaze. Pour teacupful thorouglily boiling water over tliis, and thor- oughly melt while hot. Add to cold water starch. Ammonia keeps iron from sticking. Starch keeps any length of time if well covered ■^up. Cover bowl over with double pjper, and put plate on top. Starch made with boiling water will keep a fortnight without cover on top, if a dessertspoonful of salt is added to starch before mixing. Method of Starching. Dip the collars and cuffs, two or three at a time, into the starch, and rub them well between the hands, so that the grains of starch may enter into the inner folds of linen; wring out, and straighteii them on a clean cloth, and roll up tightly and put on one side for a short time, until the ironing table is prepared. For this is required a piece of clean woollen material to cover the table (an old blanket is very useful for this purpose), a length of clean calico, or an old sheet to cover the blanket an iron stand and ironholder, which should be oblong in shape, with the corners rounded off; and covered with calico ; a duster to rub the irons on ; a small basin with clean water; and a piece of clean rag. Method of Ironing. Place the collars one at a time on the table and rub the right side and the wrong with a damp rag to take off any surface starch. Stretch the stitching at- the edges of the collar, and regulate the ful- ness by passing the hand over the linen, then iron lightly on both sides (wrong side first), then heavily on right side until smooth. Iron till dry, lifting the iron now and again to let steam escape. 'When di'T) it should balance across the finger. On no account pull the collar in front of the iron, as that will draw it out of shape. If the collar is a turn-over one, it ought to be bent into shape while warm, as the linen is less likely to crack than when cold. To iron an Eton collar, iron band first, till quite dry, then collar.522 TRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY BOOK. Method of Polishing:. If a high gloss is desired, it is necessary to have a hard surface under the linen. The collars can be placed oh a clean board for the purpose, or on a corner of the ironing table with the blanket removed. Dip the damping rag into clean water, squeeze out tightly, and rub the right side of the linen firmly until ah even dampness is obtained. Then with the heel of a clean hot glossing iron rub lightly at first over the surface of the linen, then heavily until the gloss becomes even. The toe of the iron is sometimes used to -give a finishing touch to parts that the heel has missed around the edge of the collar. Before Airing:. The collars should be turned into shape before airing. Put them on the table wrong side up, pass the iron over them, and turn the collars, one at a time, after the hot iron. Place, them in front of a good fire to air—this adds to the stiffness. NOTE.—All irons used for starched linen must be quite clean and hot. Dirty irons make bad work, and cool irons leave brown marks. Gum Starch. Pound 2 oz. fine white gum arabic to powder, put it in a jug and pour over it 1^ pint boiling water; cover the jug, and let it remain all night j on the following morning pour the liquid carefully from the dregs into a clean bottle, cork it and keep for use. A tablespoonful stirred into a pint of starch made in the usual manner will give a splendid gloss to linen. Soap Jelly. Collect all odd pieces of soap in clean jar. Add yellow soap cut in small bits to make 4 oz. in all. Add 1 quart cold water. Put in oven till quite melted. Wlien cold it will be a thin jelly. Covered up, it will keep any time. Add sufficient to the washing water to make a lather. Laundry Glazing: Secret. Starch in cold starch and iron damp. Next dip piece flannel in some French chalk and rub smoothly on each article, after which a j^iece of white curd soap is rubbed over the chalk. Finally, the articles are ironed on the right side only with a moderately hot iron, and when finished have the appearance of new articles. Woollen Underg:arment Washing:. The only effects of rubbing are to shrink and destroy the material, so use as little friction as possible. All articles should be first shaken, then turned inside out. If coloured, a very little salt or a few drops of vitriol will prevent the dye running. For white flannel add a tahlespoonful ammonia to first water and less to second water. Ammonia fades coloured flannels. Make a strong lather in warm water, and wash the garment In it, drawing it repeatedly through the hand; then in a secondTRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY BOOK. ' 223 soapy water, hot as hands can bear. Lastly, rinse well in hot water sliehtly blued. I’ut 4 times through the wringer and shake well to raise the pile which makes flannels warmer to wear. Wliile the things are drying they should he repeatedly (but gently) pulletl in every direc- tion When about half dry, fold evenly and mangle well, then dry thoroughly. In winter, flannels are best dried by the fire, or better still, on the pulleys. They should not be allowed to He in water, nor left lying wet. To Wash Flannel or Flannelette So that they may not shrink, stir 1 tablespoonful of ammonia into a gallon of very hot water, also some soap previously boiled. Put in the clothes, and press under the water with a stick j cover the vessel closely, and let it stand for one hour, when the dirt will almost drop out of the flannels. Rinse well in hot water, and hang out quickly. This method is specially good for. white flaimel. To Wash Red Flannel. Wash in same manner as wliite, except to the last water add vitriol, in proportion of 1 teaspoonful to 3 gallons of water; tins Axes the colour. Salt may be used, one large handful to about 2 gallons of water, but it has the drawback of making the flannel absorb moisture. To Shrink Flannel. Before making up, soak for a night in cold water, then wring out of warm water in which a little soap has been dissolved. To Wash New Blankets. Soak for some hours in cold water, to which two or three hand- fuls of salt have been added. Wring well, and you will then have no difficulty in washing in the usual manner. If washed right off in hot water the first time, that tends to set the sulphur in the blankets, and turn them black. Select, if possible, a day with a good breeze for washing. To Wash Muslin Blouses. Begin and finish right off, as muslin thickens if left long wet. Swill well in cold water to get rid of dust, and squeeze dry. Don’t wring, or you will stretch and break the muslin. Knead in warm, soapy lather till clean. Then put in pan with cold water softened with soap and borax, and, if white muslin, boil 10 minutes. Rinse in warm water, then cold, then in light blue water, and while stiU wet, starch in clean starch made as follows : —1 tablespoonful starch mixed smooth in 2 tablespoonfuls cold water. Pour over IJ pints boiling water, stirring rapidly all the time. Starch when cooled a little, squeeze dry as possible, place m clean cloth, roll well with rolling- pinto absorb any superfluous starch, and iron. For blue and mauve muslins, add 1 tablespoonful vinegar to 1 quart rinsing water. For yellow muslins, add 1 teaspoonful methylat^ spirits to 1 quart rins- ing water. For black and white muslins, green or red, use 1 table- spoonful salt to each gallon of rinsing water. Faded colours in mus- lins are restored by steeping in alum auu water oz. to each quart) for about 2 hours.TRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY BOOK. 224 To Wash Laces and Fine Muslins. After soaking them all night in cold water, squeeze (do not wring) out of water. Prepare a lather of soap mixture and tepid water, in proportion of 1 pint of the mixture to 1 gallon of water. Shako laces, &c., well in this, and let them soak for a few hours. Squeeze out and rinse first in warm water, then in several cold waters, some blue being in the last. To Clean White Lace. Roll it round an earthen jar, and stitch tlie ends together so that it shall not come unfastened. When all the lace is rolled put the jar on a plate, so that the lace will not burn when placed at the bottom of a saucepan, and cover the jar entirely with soap and water. Let this boil for some time, adding water from time to time. When the cleaning appears to be done, take out the jar and place it in a basin full of clean tepid water, which change repeatedly. When the water on rinsing is perfectly clear, take out the jar and allow the lace to dry in some place secure against dust, without touching it. If it is desired to give a yellow tint to the lace, plunge it, while still moist. In a decoction of tea, saffron, lime leaves or camomile, according to the shade of yellow required. If it requires to be stiffened it should be put, while still moist, in a weak solution of gum arabic. Lace should be ironed on the reverse side, on a board covered with some soft substance, with a piece of fine linen over it. By this means, when the designs are in relief, as in guipure, they are not crushed. Excellent Sta.rch for Laces, &c. Mix a small quantity of cornflour smoothly with cold water to proper consistency. To Wash Prints, &c. Wash quickly and well in two soapy waters, but do not rub soap on them. Into the clean cold rinsing water put a few drops of vitriol, just sufficient to make it taste a little tart. This fastens all colours except black, but black it fades. For black prints use salt in the rinsing water, or a little spirits of turpentine. Dry in the shade. Do not wash in too hot- water, dip into hot starch, nor iron with too hot iron. AVhen colours are very delicate, wash in bran and water, instead of soap and water. Pour ^ gallon boiling water on f lb. bran ; let it stand for some hours, then strain, and use lukewarm, without soap. Shake articles about, do not rub.^ Never dry coloured blouses in the sun or by the fire. Wash in tepid lather, only knead and squeeze. Rinse in cold water, and, don t use hot iion. Wash crewel Avork and embroidery witli the bran and Avater. The bran giA'^es sufficient stiffness without starch. To Wash Holland Dresses. After washing put some strong tea in the rinsing water. To Wash Silk Handkerchiefs. Soak in cold water | hour. If coloured, put a little salt m ^ water. Rub hems and folds in wai-m lather, not m the but in the palms of hands as 3-u Avould rub a ball of fl^r. Rep^L tbep rinse in several waters till no soap remains. If this is not at'TRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY BOOK. 225 tended to, silk will be cloudy. TliorL add 1 tablespoonful methylated spirits to a bowl of cold rinsing water, shake well, and ii-on while wet, first with cloth over. If white silk is inclined to tura yellow, let it lie after washing in cold water, for a little. Tlien finish off, adding a little blue and methylated spirit to rinsing water. To Wash Chamois Leather. Put first into tepid water, then in two different soapy lathers. Wash by drawing through forefinger and thumb. Don’t rinse. Shake, and dry quickly, pulling often when drying, to soften. To Wash Shetland Shawls. Squeeze them in two soapy lathers. To the rinsing water add thick-made starch in proportion of 1 tablespoonful of starch to IJ gal- lons of water and a little blue Do not wring, but squeeze. Fold in towel, beat Avith hands till nearly dry, lay a sheet on floor, cut four equal pieces of tape exact size of shawl, pin these on sheet where four sides of sliawl should come to and pin out carefully through the tape to sheet. Leave till dry. To Wash Stockingfs. Shake well. Soak in lukewarm water and soap jelly (no ammonia) for J hour to remove the dust. This makes them require much less rub- bing. (It is a good plan to cover over tub with an old blanket to keep in heat and prevent shrinking.) Place next in lukeAvarm water and soaf jelly, and soap will be required to rub on the dirty parts. Take the side part of the foot and lay it over the hands and nib with soap. Stockings nearly ahvays dirty, so require to bo rubbed. Now, put hand inside and mb soles same way, and, lastly, Avash leg by squeez- ing. Turn stocking out for second Avashing, by squeezing only, and put through Avringer, toe first. Rinse in t.Avo lukeAvarni Avaters, putting through wringer each time. Put 4 times through Avringer and shake Avell, and hang up by toes. To Wash Black Stockingfs. To every tAvo gallons of lukeAvarm Avater add a handful of salt and 1 tablespoonful vinegar. Do not forget to shake before washing. Slue the rinsing water to prevent them turning green. Never put blue and vinegar into one Avater, as the one counteracts the other. To Wash Silk Stockingfs (Coloured or Black). Wash with warm bran water (no soap). (See recipe for washing prints). Squeeze, don’t wring, and dry in the shade. To Wash Black Materials. Make a lather by adding a tablespoonful of soap jelly, and' two level teaspoonfuls of powdered borax to a gallon of water of about 110 degs. Work the material up and down in this, drawing it through your hands, but not rubbing it. -Rinse in two lots of clear lukewarm water, and hang in the shade (Avithout wringing) till nearly dry. Pull each piece into shape when hanging on the line. Iron on the wrong side when nearly dry, and continue ironing till quite dry. For other woollen articles, such as children’s dresses, shawls, die., fvhere there are green or other fancy colours, add to your soap jelly ^ gill of spirits of turpentine, and a tablespoonful of spirits of harts- 11S26 TRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY BOOK. horn; then thoroughly wash as quiclQy as possible; rinse in cold water with a little salt in it, and dry quickly. If this is done care- fully, the colours will remain quite fresh. Handkerchiefs. Cambric handkerchiefs should be well soaked in tepid water for 2 hours, then squeezed out to a pan of water, to every gallon of which an ounce of shredded soap and a small tablespoonful of paraffin are added. Boil 20 minutes and rinse in clear cold water, and again in blue water. Pass through wringer, but don’t twist. Spread smoothly between the folds of a towel and roll up tightly. Iron in a few hours, while still damp. A little arrowroot, in a muslin bag and placed in the water in which handkerchiefs are boiled (using no para- ffin), will give them a. faint and agreeable perfume when ironed). If borax ia added to the rinsing water, they will be slightly stiff, with- out being hard. To Wash Sashes and Ribbons, &c. Squeeze in warm soapy lather (not . hot) till clean, then rinse in warm water, then in cold, to which 1 tablespoonful salt and same of vinegar has been added. This is to preserve the colour. Squeeze tightly, fold evenly, and roll in a clean cloth. Beat well between the hands, and iron at once with moderately hot iron under muslin. Never soak coloured silks, but wash and iron as expeditiously as possible to prevent colour going. If wanted slightly stiff, put 1 tea- spoonful prepared gum water to each pint rinsing water, or dissolve a little gum arabic the size of a walnut in the quart of rinsing water. Ribbons treated so will look equal to new. White cotton gloves wash beautifully and do not shrink. Put them on the hands, and wash them as if you were washing your hands; use cold water, and rinse well. Put them in a clean, dry towel, and pass them twice through the wringer, and finish drying in the air or by the fire. Wash white woollen gloves in soapy lather, to which a little am^ monia is added. Rinse in warm water. Put in clean cloth, and pass through mangle. Don’t dry near fire, but in a warm place. Rice is an excellent thing to clean white woollen dresses and coats Take a clean cloth, dip it in dry ground rice, and. thoroughly rub it over every soiled part, using a fresh piece of the cloth as often as it becomes at all soiled. End the process with a good shaking, when the garment should look like new. Spirits of wine rubbed on a white leather belt with a clean cloth will remove all stains. To Iron Blouses. First, iron trimmings, then collar and cuffs, then yoke, then body, beginning with button side of front and with top placed at the left hand. Iron from bottom to top, right across blouse. Lastly, iron sleeves. To Restoi*e Yellow Linen. Linen garments which have become yellow may be whitened by being boiled in a lather made of milk and pure white soap, a pound of the latter to a gallon of the former. After the boiling, rinse linen twice, a little blue in last water.TRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY BOOK. 227 To Remove Mildew. Moisten soft soap and starch with the juice of a leipon. Spread this paste over mildew, lay out and bleach, afterwards wash. If it fails the first time, repeat, or boil \ hour in butter-milk. For Scorched Linen. It is said that when linens are badly scorched the spot can be removed if treated in the following manner : Extract the juice from two peeled onions, and add half an ounce'of white castile soap, cut in small pieces, and two ounces of fuller’s earth. Mix them together, and then stir in one cup of vinegar. Stand the vessel over the file, and let its contents thoroughly boil. When the mixture has become cool, spread it over the scorched linen and let it dry upon the cloth. When well dried wash out the linen. A SIMPLER METHOD. If a short bosom, or any otlier article, has unfortunately been scorched in ironing, lay iti wliero the bright sunshine will fall straight on it. It will take it entirely out, leaving it clean and white as before. To Remove Iron Mould from Linen. Rub thoroughly the affected part with lemon juice, then expose to the sun until the stain disappears If one application is not suffi- cient, repeat the process until the mould disappears. To Remove Medicine Stains from Sheets. Before washing lay on paste made from fuller’s earth and am- monia. Leave till dry, then directly wash the part in a basin of cold water, when stain will come quite out. Chloride of Lime Bleaching: Liquid Will remove all stains from linen. Pour boiling water on chloride of lime in proportion of 1 gallon to J lb. Bottle it, cork it tightly, and in using the liquid be careful not to stir it. Washing:'Blue. 3d Chinese Blue, Id Oxalic Acid. Put these in a bottle, add boiling water to fill the bottle, and allow to stand all night. Add 3 more bottles of water to this. To Wash Clothes in Paraffin Soap. Cut down ^ lb. paraffin soap and put it into a boiler of water to melt. Rub the clothes well out of the soda water, in which they have been previously soaked, put them into the boiler and let them boil for \ hour, then put them into a tub with plenty of cold water; wash them thoroughly, rinse in blue water, and dry. To Render Children’s Clothes Unin- flammable. To 3 parts of dry starch add 1 part tungstate of soda, and use in ordinary way. If material does not require starching dissolve 1 lb. of the same in 2 gallons water. Well saturate the fabric and dry. Will not injure colour, nor will ironing affect it. 1 oz. of alum added to rinsing water will make clothes- practically uninflammable—would only smoulder very slowly, never burst into flame.228 TRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY BOOK. Launciry Hints. On. Ironing Day, try standing on a soft thick rug, and note if it will not prevent the feet becoming so tired as they would otherwise be. The irons must be perfectly clean. Have a little brick dust or sand on a piece of stout brown paper in a box to rub them on, being particular that points and sides of iron are clean. Iron first on the wrong side, then on the right. A thickly-folded blanket, and sheet over, should be used, pinned tightly down at comers of table. Collect all odd ends of candles and place them between an old duster. Clean the iron on it before using, and you will find the iron go over the things as smoothly as you could possibly wish. Tliis is especially useful for starched articles. Clean msty irons with soft soap and bathbrick. If irons are to be put away for some time rub over with tallow or mutton fat to keep out the moisture, and wrap in newspaper which has been toasted in the oven. An iron-holder should be round in shape, and the inter-lining should be of leather. Old gloves or pieces of wash-leather should be saved for this purpose. Tlie tops of worn-out boots or shoes make excellent iron-holders. Always, if possible, iron coarse articles, such as towels, before the starched things; as no matter how clean they are kept, the irons will work better after being used a short time. Never let irons get red-hot, or hang about on range. Spoils temper, and they will never afterwards retain heat so well. When starching any article finished with a fringe gather the fringe tightly in the hand, and dip the material only in the starch When dry shake thoroughly, and either beat the fringe on the edge of a table, or brush with a nail brush. Clothes-pegs and clothes-lines, if boiled for a few minutes and dried quickly once a month, will last much longer. Always boil new lines 10 minutes before using. Care of the Wringer.—Do not fail 'to oil the wringer pretty fre>:- quently. If oiled often there is less wear on the machinery and less strength is expended by the operator. To clean the rollers rub them first with a cloth saturated with kerosene oil, and follow with soap and water. Loosen the rollers before putting the wringer away. Do not wring out of water above ordinary washing temperature. Wear rollers equally by wringing large articles in centre and small articles at each side. Fold buttons inside. To prevent the blue in clothes from looking patchy it is a wise plan to make a quart or two of water a good deep lalue. and from that pour into the blueing-tub until one has the required tint. Hands that have been in hot soda water and become shrunken and soft, will become smooth and natural again if rubbed with ordinary kitchen salt. A good clothes pin bag is made out of a rough towel. Turn up enough to make a bag, stitch each side into position, run tape across top, tie it round waist like apron, and you have always pins beside you. Wear large apron of white oil-cloth while washing—saves wetting and soiling dress. Always wear a shawl round shoulders when going to hang out clothes.TRIED FAYOVRITES COOKERY KOOK. 229 THINGS WORTH KNOWING AND REMEMBERING. A Breakfast-Table Barometer. A cup of hot coffee is an unfailing barometer, if you allow a lump of sugar to drop to' the bottom of the cup and watch the air bubbles arise without disturbing the coffee. If the bubbles collect in the middle, the weather will be fine; if they adhere to the cup, forming a I’ing, it will either rain or snow; and if the bubbles separate without assuming any fixed position, changeable weather may be expected. To loosen Articles that have become 'Gxecl If Tumblers become fixed, tap gently round with another tumbler, and like magic they will come apart. If a glass stopper is fixed, tap round it with another, and it will be loosened. If two flower-pots are fixed, tap with another flower-pot. If two iron screws, tap with piece of iron, and so on. You will always have the same result. The rule is, tap each article with one of similar kind. To Take Bruises out of Furniture. Wet the part with warm water. Double a piece of brown paper six times thick. Soak it and lay it on the place. Apply on that a hot flat iron until the moisture is evaporated. If the bruise has not gone, repeat the process till the dent or bruise is raised level with the surface. To Remove Ink Stains from Linen. Cut lemon, squeeze its juice at once upon place stained. Then rub with yellow soap and rinse in cold water. Effect almost magical, but must be done at once. If stain has been in linen or cotton some time, salts of lemon will erase stain. Wet part, stretch over bowl, rub salts over briskly, and rinse quickly. AnoUier way : —When ink is spilled on linen, try dipping in pure melted tallow. The hot tallow seems to absorb the ink, and after washing stain will be found to have disappeared. To Remove Ink on the Carpet, &c. Throw a quantity of salt on it, which will quickly absorb the ink. Take this up and put on more salt. Keep repeating, rubbing salt well into the ink spot, until ink is all talcen up by the salt. Then brush the salt out of the cai’pet. Or, talce up as much of the ink as possible with spoon or blotting paper. Pour cold sweet milk upon the spot, and take up with a spoon until the milk is only faintly tinged with ink, then wash with cold water and wipe dry. • Ink spilled on woollen covers may be taken out, if washed at once in cold water. Change the water often, till stain is gone. Stains on cotton goods need salts of lemon melted in boiling water. For mark- ing ink stains use chloride of lime and vinegar. Ink stains on printed leaves of books may be renovated by a solu- tion of oxalic acid in water. Blaoklbad SrAnsrs on carpets can be got rid of if covered with a paste of fuller’s earth and water and a little ammonia added.

If the stain has not ontirelv disappeared repeat the process. ^ _ All kinds of cai-pets quickly cleaned if rubbed over with a flannel with a good lather of Sunlight soap and then rinsed with ammonia and water, the water being changed frequently. Candle-grease spots can be removed either by placing blotting paper on spdt and holding a hot iron over it, or, if the mark ia but a small one, by putting a match to it as close as possible, without burning the material. ® Di’y flour lubbed on a carpet and allowed toi remain on for some hours will absorb grease and oil, if any has been spilt by accident, or make a paste, with boiling water, of equal parts of fuller’s earth and magnesia, and while hot lay this over the spots.

Cover and stand for 3 days. Strain and bottle (taking care to label bottle “Poison.”) Rub well into stained parts. This is a capital plan. Coal-tar is removed with butter. An excellent paste for removing grease or soiled spota is made of 1 dessertspoonful pearline and a cup of hot water. Rub it to- gether well, and let it boil for a few minutes. Pour it into a small jar, and keep it at hand for emergencies. Unequalled for cleaning greasy coat collars, &o. To remove grease spots ,or paint stains from cotton or woollen goods, sponge with turpentine. If the stain is fresh it will disappear at once; if it is of long standing, saturate the part, and let it remain for several hours, then rub off the paint. To remove paint from a wooden surface, soak with spirits of turpentine, and rub off with pumice stone. Carbonate of soda will generally remove the most obstinate mud- stains. Rub with cloth or flannel, then press well on wrong side with iron. To prevent cloth being spotted by rain, wipe away the wot from nap of cloth, as soon as possible, using sillc handkei’chief or soft brush or sponge.' Will be found free from spots and smooth. To remove coffee stains from delicate material brush the spot with pure glycerine, rinse in lukewann water, and press on the wrong side. Hot tea and coffee stains removed by soaking in cold water. Wring, spread out, and pour a few drops, of glycerine on. Stand several hours, then wash with cold water and soap. For cocoa and chocolate stains wash with soap in tepid water. Tea, coffee, chocolate, and fruit stains in table-cloth may be com- pletely removed, if done at once. Place stain tightly over large basin and pour boiling water over the mark till it has gone. When nearly dry, press with an iron, and no trace of accident wiU remain. A lump of sugar put in the tea-pot wiU prevent tea staining da- mask, however fine, over which it may be spilled.

Rub stain rapidly, then rinse thoroughly to remove acid. To take paint out of clothing, take equal parts ammonia and turpentine. Saturate spots two or thi’oe times, then wash in soap suds. Gravy makes an ugly grease-spot on a tablecloth, and this may be removed with powdered French chalk. Rub it on both sides of the spot and lay the cloth away. It will absorb the grease and leave the cloth spotless. Remove grease marlcs on pages of books by sponging with ben- zine, placing page between two sheets of blotting paper, and pressing with a hot iron. Kerosene removes ir.k-stains and fresh paint, while nothing takes blood-stains out bettor than cold soap-suds, to which a little kerosene has been added. Blood-stains on silk, satins, &c., can be easily removed by mak- ing a thick paste of starch and water and co^'ering the stain with it. Leave till quite diy, and then brush the starch off with a soft brosh, and all traces of blood will have gone and no harm will be done the material. Use soda water for washing anything greasy. The alkali turns the grease to soap which will do its own cleaning. Ink-Stalns on Wood. For ink-stains on fumiture add six drops of nitre to a teaspoon- ful of water, and apply it to the stain with a feather. I^ the wood is polished, rub with sweet oil immediately after. If the stain does nob yield to the first application, make it stronger, and repeat the process. To renovate tops of writing tables and leather chairs, sponge lightly with warm soap suds, and then wipe off with whites of eggs whipped stiff. To Clean Furs, Tapestry, &c. Warm bran in oven. Rub well into fur sevei’al times. Shake and bi-ush free from dust. Rub light furs witli magnesia. Stains on the Hands will disappear at once if rubbed with fresh lemon juice. The refuse that has been left over from cooking will be quite sufficient for this pui-pose if lemon is not at hand; a little flour of mustard will do equally well. The stains that appear so readily when peeling onions rnay be altogether prevented by cleaning that vegetable under water. To remove whitewash marks from floors, furniture, and windows, apply a small quantity of parafldn on a soft cloth. The stains will dis- appear completely, and this does not injure the most delicate paint. The white spots that appear on mahogany when a hot dish has been placed on it may be greatly improved by rubbing with kerosene. Kitchen Tables and Shelves. You will be able to keep these very white and clean if you have this mixture used for scouring them : —| lb. of sand, ^ lb. of soft soap, J lb. of lime. Work all well together into a paste. Put this on the scrubbing brush, then wash it off with plenty of clean water. To Absorb Damp in a Cupboard. Fill a small box with lime, and place upon a shelf. This will result in the air in the cupboard being kept both dry and sweet.232 TRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY BOOK. Lamps. Clean lamps early in the day, then turn wick down. Clean daily, or flame may dance and flicker. Keep burner very clean, inibbing off burnt oil with emery from time to time. Fill lamps 3 parts full only, and use good oil. It is false economy to use cheap paraflSn, which gives an inferior light, smells badly, dirties the lamp, and is decidedly dangerons. In lighting lamp, turn up flame gradually. To extinguish lamp, turn flame down till it begins to flicker, then give a shai-p puff across 4op of funnel. Never refill lamp while lighted. Every now and then the lamp needs a thorough cleansing. The oil should be carefully emptied away, so as to leave any dregs in the bottom. This may be put into a bottle, and can be kept for stable, coach-house, or other purposes. Wlaen the lamp has been well washed in soda water and dried thoi’oughly the other oil can be poured back again, and added to, till the reservoir is almost full. Before putting on the brass part that holds the globe and chimney, this too must be freed from all impurities, and all pieces of charred wick turned out fmm the edge; the air holes and buniers must be kept clear and open. It will then be found that the lamp will bum clearly, giving out a bright, white light. Cut lamp wicks very occasionally.—Instead of cutting, the burnt part should be rubbed with a soft piece of rag until it is even with the burner.. Wlien a wick is a trifle tight for its tube and -will not move up and down easily, draw out one or two of the threads from one side. * , To prevent new lamp wicks from smoking, soak them thoroughly in vinegar before using, and let them dry before being put into the lamp. Wicks treated in this way seldom smoke, and give a dearer light than if put in as they are. A bit of camphor about as big as a small hazel nut put into the oil reservoir also improves the light. To prevent lamp smelling be careful after filling to wipe any drops of oil off vessel. Turn wick below level of burner after cleaning. This prevents oil from running over edge of burner. If a lamp smells or smokes, put a teaspoonful vinegar in lamp. Will cause clear light and prevent unpleasant odour and smoke. To wash lamp chimneys, tear old newspapers in small pieces, dip into water which has a little ammonia dissolved in it, and wash the lamp chimneys. Just rinse, drain well, and polish with a leather. Excellent lamp wicks may be made out of men’s sdt felt hats by cutting them into slips the width you want your mcks and letting them soak in vinegar for a couple of hours, then drying thein.

Then apply glue, cto., to the cleaned linoleum with a food piece of flannel. Do not tread on. it till dry, and^ it will leave a nice polish, which lasts/ well with even the wear of a family. Or, clean with paraffin, putting 2 tablespoonfiils in the water it is washed ^_ith— no soap. Linoleum so treated will last well and retain its original colour. Tiles, after washing, will keep clean much longer if wiped over with paraffin. A Cheap Flour-Stain. PeiTnanganate of potash is a cheap and effectual stain for board floors. Add ^ oz. of permanganate to a quart of water, and use this to paint over the floor, which must first have been thoroughly scrubbed and allowed to dry. Repeat the process if it is not as dark as you want it, and then let dry, and polish with bees’ wax and turpentine. To Clean Paint. Squeeze clean cloth out of hot water, dip it in wliiting, and with this rub the paint till all dirt is removed. Rinse well with clean water, diy with a soft cloth, and polish with a chamois leather. Paint cleaned in this way looks like new, and the whiting will not injure even the most delicate colours. To remove the smell of paint, put a pail of water in the room and change it every few hours. The water will absorb the smell of the paint, but it will do the work more quickly if a sliced onion or lemon, a large piece of camphor or ammonia, or a handful of hay, be put into it. For washing a varnished wall, a little melted glue, or dissolved glue size, put in the water, is a great improvement. Cement for mending; Hot Water Cans, leaks in Stoves, Kettles, or Iron Articles. Mix equal quantities of glycerine and litharge (oxide of lead) to the consistency of thick cream. It resists the action of hot or cold water, and almostl any degree of heat. Only mix a little at a time, veiy thick, more like putty than cream. Let the article when mended harden for a week before using. Glass. New glass shordd never be used until ti'eated so that it is rendered, as near as possible, unbreakable. Place tumblers, &o., in a lai'ge pan, pack them round with hay, and then fill with cold water. Add handful salt. Place the pot on the fire and then bring it slowly to boiling point. Then remove from the fire, and stand it aside until cold. Broken glass or earthenware can be easily mended by this simple recipe. Tie broken edges together so that they will stay in place. Do not wash or wet them after they are broken, but put them in a flat kettle and cover with skim milk. Put kettle on fire and let sim- mer for 2 hours or more. Then remove, and when cold t ke the ware out carefully and put it on one side for a month, when it will be ready for use. How to Make a splendid Substitute for Glue. Take a small piece of cold potato, which has been boiled, and rub it up and down a piece of paper with your fingers for about fiveJ34 TRIED FkVOVRITES COOKERY BOOK. minutes. It will become the right consistency and stick as well as-, the strongest glue. > o Keep away Moths, &c. Take 1 oz. of each of the following: —Cloves, nutmeg, mace, car- raway-seeds, cinnamon, and Tonquin beans, and 6 oz. orris-root; grind to a powder, mix thoroughly, and put in muslin bags, which store amongst your clothes.

How to make Half a Ton of Coals go as far as 15 Hundredweight. Place a quantity of challc in the grates. Once heated, this is prac- tically inexhaustible from combustion, and gives out gi’eat heat. Place the chalk at the back of each of your fires in nearly equal proportions with the coal. Full satisfaction will be felt both as to the cheerfulness and as to the warmth of the fire, and the saving throughout the winter will be at the rate of 26 per cent. Another way to economise coal.—Take old newspapers, about eight at a time, and roll them up as tightly ^as possible, binding the ends of the roll with wire to prevent it coming undone, and place on the fire. These rolls bum like coal, and give out a good heat. The wire can be used over and over again. To save coals, leave slide at top of range a little open ; will have more heat and great saving of coals. A Sewing Machine Secret, &c. Take out the screw that holds the foot-plate, remove it, and you will be sui’prised at the amount of fiuff accumulated there. Clean the little grooves and under the whole of the plate with a penknife (the needle must be taken out before the work is begun). You will often find this is the only cause for the machine running hard and not carry- ing the work. When working Avith machine on crape or any other flimsy ma- terial, by placing a piece of paper underneath, it will be found to prevent it stretching. Yellow stains left by machine oil on white material may be re- moved by rubbing the spot with a cloth wet with ammonia before washing with soap. Flannel should not be used in needle-books for sticking needles into, as flannel is often prepared with sulphur, which will rust the needles. A piece of fine linen or chamois leather is better. In making sleeves of children’s dresses, make quite full and long enough to turn a hem and gather at wrist. When too short, rip out the hem and gather into a cuff. Test for Bad Water. Buy 1 oz. of saturated solution of permanganate of potash. If, when a drop of this is added to a tumbler of water, its colour changes to brown, it is unfit to drink. If it remains clear or slightly rose- coloured after an hour it is, broadly speaking, safe. This test shouldTRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY BOOK. 235 always be applied when sore throats are prevalent, or diphtheria or typhoid is in a house. Mixture for Destroying Flies &c. 1 pint infusion of quassia, 4 oz. moist sugar, and 1 oz. pepper. Mix well and stand about in saucers. A little tui-pentine sprinkled among the clothes or put about the closets will make moths flee, and exterminate cockroaclies. It will take spots out of muslin, and if a tablespoonful be added to a boilerful of clothes it will whiten them much. It is good for a cut or burn. Fly Papers. 1 oz. Eesin, 1 oz. Castor Oil; add a few drops Iloiiey and a small piece Bees^-Wax. Melt together, and spread on firm papers. Try a little first, to see if proper consistency, when cool. If not hard enough, add a trifle more resin. Cleaning Hints. Old Brass may be cleaned to look like new by pouring strong ammonia on it, scrubbing with a scmbbing binsh, and then rinsing in clear water. Chased Brass Goods, such as are generally known as Benares work, are easily cleaned in this way; Wash in hot soap and water, and dry thoroughly. C\it a lemon in half, and with it mb the brass. When it looks clean, rinse in warm water, dry, and tlien polish well with a chamois leather. Chased work should never bo cleaned with any kind of powder. To Clean Mardle Washstands.—Take 2 ounces of washing soda, 1 of powdered pumice-stone, and 1 of powdered chalk. Pound togeth- er, and then pass through a sieve. Take some of the powder and make it into a paste with cold water, rub it well over the surface of the marble, and leave 24 hours, wash off with soap and water. To Clean Oxidised Silver.—Dip a rag in saturated solution of sulphate of soda and rub. Silver will be clean in a few seconds. Scour badly-stained Knives by dipping raw potato in bath-brick. To CtEAN Knives.—Mix a tiny bit of carbonate of soda with bath- brick. They will polish more easily. To Revive and Preserve Leather.—1 part best vinegar, 2 parts boiled linseed. Bottle and shake till like cream. Apply with soft rag, and polish with vei7 soft duster. Cleans leather, softens, and pre- vents it cracking. Clean Copper Kettles with a cut lemon dipped in salt. Rinse with clean water, and polish with soft cloth. Wash alabaster figures with borax and water, alloiving ^ oz. borax to 1 pint water. Diy carefully with old piece, of soft silk. Wash bmshes and brooms every 6 weeks in mixture of 2 table- spoonfuls ammonia to 4 gallon of water. Let the bristles stand ^ hour in the water. Rinse thoroughly and hang in cool place to dry. Always keep them hanging on nail, so that bristles do not touch the floor. Magic Polishing Cloth. Take one gallon gasolene, two pounds whiting, and half an ounce oleic acid; mix and shake up well. Pieces of woollen cloth soaked in this mixture, wning out, and hung up to dry are said to put a fine236 TRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY BOOK. gloss on any polislied surface, silver-ware, &o.; and althougli the cloths may become soiled and dirty with constant use, they will never dirty the hands of tlie user, or lose their polishing power. A, word of waniing may be added as to the danger of using gasolene anywhere near a naked light or fireplace. .It is obvious, tlierefore, that the cloths should be dried in the open air ; once dried, of course, there will be no further danger. Various Remedies. Onion juice is one of the most effective remedies for earache. Wrap a large onion in heavy wrapping paper, wet it thoroughly, and roast in the coals. W^hen tender, strip off the skin and squeeze out the juice by twisting in a thin cloth. Bottle and save for use. When needed, pour one or tAvo drops in a spoon, warm a little, and drop into the ear. Afterwards put in a bit of warm cotton to ex- clude the air. It rarely, if ever, fails to effect a speedy cure. Ia’'y Leaves Cure fob Corns.—The ordinai'y climbing ivy fur- nishes a veiy inexpensive and easily obtainable remedy. Take a few of the leaves (say about a dozen), saturate for about three days in strong vinegar sufficient to cover them. Tlie leaves may be laid on as a plaster before putting the stockings on in the moniing, or the solur tion may be used as a paint with a camel’s-hair pencil. For hot, tired feet, try a little Paterson’s Clensel in bath water. Relieves wnder- fuUy. Curb for Toothache.—It is said that equal quantities of cvayenne and common pepper mixed with vinegar is a certain cure. The tooth should be plugg^ with a pill of the mixture. Lard and Camphor are excellent remedies for a cold m the head Or tightness of the chest, causing hard breathing. Soften a little fresh lard near the fire, and stir into it an equal amount of camphor. Pour into a tin salve box or open-mouthed bottle, and cool^ as rapidly as possible, beating all the time, that the camphor may be thoroughly in- corporated w'ith the lard, else the latter will settle tO' the bottom, and the camphor remain on the top. If one’s head be “stopped np,” mb aU about nose, as well as foreliead and temples. If a little be rubbed or snuffed up the nostrils it will be all the better. For tightness in chest rub thoroughly on throat and chest, and only a few applications will be needed to effect a cure. Mutton Suet is an excellent remedy for dry lips and chapped hands. Render it doAvn, mn into cakes, and use nightly. If you use M'Clinton’s Barilla Ash Soap, and diy the hands well, they will never chap. It is made from the ash of plants, and its mildness makes it par excellence a toilet soap. If the hands have become chapped, fill a pair of old loose kid gloves with well-Avrought lather of this soap, putting these on just when getting into bed, and Avearing till morning. Doing this for two or three nights will cure chapped, or even the more painful hacked, hands, where the outer skin has got hard and cracked down to the tender inner layer.—Dr Kirk.

It gives no disagreeable odour, corrodes no metals, hurts no texture, injures no* colour, is a simple and safe sweetener and disinfectant. A teaspoonful charcoal in half a glass water often relieves a sick headache. It absorbs the gases and relieves the distended stomach by pressing against the nerves which extend from the stomach to^ the head. It relieves constipation, pains, or heartburn. Borax. 1 proportion witli 2 of honey or glycerine, good for sore throats or thrush. 1 teaspoonful in 1 pint warm water is a healing solution for sores, cuts, or wounds. Wash with the solution, then dip a soft linen rag in, squeeze and bind round. 1 teaspoonful added to washing water prevents rough skin and chapped hands, also good for flushing of face. In laundry, makes collars, curtains, &o., beautifully white; also splendid for washing flannels. Use 2 tablespoonfuls to 3 gallons water. Very little soap needed. Add a little to water for kitchen towels, makes them a good col- our, eradicates dirt and grease, acts as a disinfectant and softens the hands. To wasli black cashmere, add 2 teaspoonfuls to soapy lather. Rinse in very blue water. Add teaspoonful to boiled starch. Dissolve teaspoonful in 1 pint hot water to clean a sponge. Pour a strong solution down drains and sinks. Add a pinch to water silver and glass are washed in, removes marks and makes tliem glitter. To remove fur from kettles, dissolve 2 teaspoonfuls in a kettle full of hot water. Let it boil J hour, when fur will be loosened and may be thrown away. Scatter equal paids borax and castor sugar mixed, about haunts of cockroaches, will disperse them like nothing else. Dissolve tablespoonful in gallon hot water to wash hair. Cleanses scalp from dandruff, softens and brightens the hair. Add a pinch in brewing tea, and to water green vegetables are boiled in; makes them a much brighter colour. Salads laid in cold water with a pinch of borax will be crisp and well-flavoured. A strong solution sprayed on plants will exterminate green fly. Antiseptic mouth-wash: —1 teaspoonful tincture of myrrh and i teaspoonful spirits of camphor in a bottle. Dissolve 2 teaspoonfuls myra borax in a pint hot. water and pour into the bottle with camphor and myi’rh. Shalce well and use in proportion of a tablespoonful to J tumbler of water. Uses of the Lemon. An eminent London doctor writes : —Lemonade from juice of the lemon is one of the best and safest drinks for any person, whether in238 TRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY BOOK. health or not. It is^ suitable for all stomach diseases, gravel, liver complaint, inflammation of the bowels, and fever. It is a specific against worms and skin complaints. Lemon juice is the best antiscor- butic remedy known. It not only cures the disease, but prevents it. Sailors make daily use of it for this purpose. I advise every one to rub the gums with lemon juice to keep them in good condition. The hands and nails are kept clean, white, soft, and supple by the daily use of lemon instead of soaj). A teaspoonful lemon juice in a cup of tepid Avater whitens the nails, and removes grease and dirt if fingers are dabbed in it. It also prevents chilblains. Hub hands well with slice of lemon after Avashing. A few drops of lemon juice will mitigate the pain of a bee sting. After bathing a com or bunion in hot Avater, a few drops of lemon juice on the part will be found very soothing. Lemon is often used in intermittent fever, mixed with strong, hot black coffee, Avithout sugar. Neuralgia and headache may be cured by rubbing the parts affected Avith cut lemon. It is valuable also to cure warts. If the hair bo falling out and also to destroy dand- ruff rub the pulp of lemon on the scalp. It will alleviate and finally cure coughs and colds, and heal diseased lungs if boiled 2 minutes and taken hot on going to bed at night. Its uses are manifold, and the more Ave employ it externally the better we shall find ourselves. Lemon juice is good, in removing tartar from the teeth, antifebrile, Ac. A doctor in Home is trying it experimentally in malarial fever with great success, and thinks it will in time supersede quinine. EXTRACTS from Papers on HEALTH, by Prof. KIRK. —Cold baths, while greatly to be recommended for those who are strong, should not be taken by any one who does not feel invigorated by them. As every one should, if possible, bathe daily, the following method is AVO’’th knowing, as it combines all the advantages of hot and cold bathing : —Sponge all over with hot water and wash with M‘Clinton’s soap ; then sponge all over with cold water. No chilliness will then be felt. Very weak persons may use tepid instead of cold water. These baths, taken every morning, will greatly tend to prevent a person catching cold. Cold bathing in water that is hard is a mistake, especially in bathing of infants. The skin under its influence becomes dry. Warm bathing and M'Clinton’s soap will remedy this. Bedsore •—There are cases in which the outer skin has been taken off by long lying, or wearing wet compresses for a long time. A large part of the body is reduced, as some would say, to “ red flesh.” In reality it is reduced to inner skin deprived of its outer layer. We have taken a few handfuls of well-wrought lather of M'Clinton’s soap (prepared as if for shaving, but from toilet soap) and spread it as lightly as possible over their fiery surface. There was an instant change from severe distress to perfect comfort, and healing began at once. This treatment may be applied to any simple abrasions of the skin. Bedsores are not likely to occur if the skin is sponged daily with this mild soap and rubbed with rectified spirits of wine, to which a small piece of camphor has been added.TRIED FA-VOVRITES COOKERY BOOK. 239 USEFUL TO KNOW IN SIGK-NURSING. Hot SAjfDBAGS.—Get some clean, fine sand, dry it thoroughly in a kettle or pan on the stove j malse a bag about eight inches square of flannel, fill it with the dry sand, sew the opening carefully togeth^ir, and cover the bag with cotton or linen cloth. This will prevent the sand from sifting out, and also enable you to heat the bag quickly by placing in the oven or on the top of the stove. After once using this you will never again attempt to ■vt'ann the hands or the feet of a sick person with hot-water bottles. The sand holds the heat for a long time, and the bag can be tucked up to the back without hurting the invalid. An agreeable me(hod of changing the atmosphere in an invalid’s room is to pour some Eau-de-Cologne into a soup plate, and with a lighted match set fire to it. The spirit will make a pretty flame, and impart a delightful refreshing odour to the air. The best way to treat the eye with a cinder in it is to let that eye alone, and rub the other one. If you shut your finger in a door or bruise it in any way, put it in water as hot as you can bear ; in a few minutes change it for hotter, and keep it in water at least 15 minutes. If the foot is bruised talre off the shoe and stocking and immerse it in hot water from 16 to 30 minutes, adding hot water often. The juice of a lemon before breakfast will often cure a bilious headache; but no sugar must be taken with it. In severe paroxysms of coughing a tablespoonful of glycerine in a glass of hot milk will give almost instantaneous relief. Three strawberry leaves, eaten green, are said to be an unfailing and immediate cure for summer complaints, diarrhoea and dysentery. An application of brown paper steeped in vinegar is an old-fash- ioned remedy for “a cold in the chest,” a soi-e throat, or a bmise. It owes its efficacy to the heat-i’etaining properties of the paper. Paper (thick brown) stitched between the lining and cloth of a waistcoat or in the back of a thin coat will render it warm, as well as light. If the poor only knew this, they would stitch strong sheets of tliick paper to back of old quilts and thus render their families more comfortable, because better protected from the bitter weather. A good remedy for a cold is to spread a piece of brown paper with pig’s lard, then sprinkle sidphur over, and wear over chest. If a mustard poidtice or plaster be mixed with vinegar, instead of water, all risk of a chill is avoided. If the white of an egg is used to mix it, it will not blister the tenderest sliin, and may be applied to infants. _ A sure and simple cure for hiccough is to drink half a teaspoonful of vinegar; and keep your arms in an upright position for a minute or so afterwards, or until you feel it no longer necessaiT- to keep them in that position. To remove fish bones from the throat, suck a lemon, which dis- solves the mineral part of the bone and makes it quite flexible. An- other way is to swallow a raw egg immediately. To drink water is useless. Cold tear-leaves bound on a bum take out the fire at once. Make smelling salts by breaking Id rock ammonia into rather340 TRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY BOOK. small pieces to fill the bottle. Then cover with either lavender water or Eau-de-Cologno. MiUc is said to be more digestible if shaken. (May place a cup over the tumbler.) This is because of the admixture of air. Wash tube of baby’s bottle with piece of tape (white) and a bodkin. Bristles are liable to come out of brush. Blisters should not be out open, but a white cotton thread should be passed through to drain them. Oranges eaten the first thing in the morning will often cure dyspepsia, or grapes can be substituted for oranges. Nothing is better for heartburn than a quarter of a teaspoonful of baking soda mixed in a little sour milk, and taking it will give instant relief. If a child receives a blow causing a bruise immediately smear a small lump of fresh butter on the part affected, and renew it every five minutes for some time. Olive oil may be used if fresh butter is not at hand. For a tight hoarse cough, sip hot water often. This will give immediate relief. A little lemon juice may be added to water. For Hoarseness.—A good remedy is to bake a lemon as you would an apple. Squeeze a little of the thickened juice (heated always) over lumps of sugar and take frequently. Borax is also excellent for loss of voice. People who suffer from perspiring feet will be benefited by bath- ing them with warm water (not hot), to which a little ammonia is added. When dry, dust them over with a little boracic poAvder. For freckles and sunbuni, 2d elder flower water and a tablespoon- ful white rose perfume. Dab over and all skin blemishes Avill quickly disappear. Burns, Scalds, and Insect Bites. A simple and efficacious remedy for these is always at hand, but not sufficiently known. It is treacle. If the bum be on the extremities, take a sufficienb quantity of ti'eacle to plunge the affected part in it. Wliere this is not practicable, apply a piece of cotton wool saturated in the symp to' the bum, and tie it over loosely with a bandage. Ra^v onions, pounded and applied to burns, will give immediate relief. Bites of insects Avill be greatly r-elieved by touching the spot with a drop gf ammonia. It neutralises the poi^n, and consequently soothes the pain. The pain caused by insect bites will also be relieved by putting a little damp salt over the part affected and binding it round tightly with a bandage. COLD WATER AS A PURIFIER. Much is talked noAvadays of the good of the various disinfectants that science has brought fonvard in the last few years. In straining after new ideas we are apt to overlook many good and simple remedies. Fresh cold water is a powerful absorbent of gases, therefore it should be greatly used in a sick room, or in one which cannot be fiequently ventilated. A bowl of cold water, kept in such a room and changed daily, is of great assistance in purifying the air. This, of course, shows that water Avhich has stood in a close apartment is moroughly unfit for drinking purposes.

A vessel of cold water placed near the head of a restl’ess sleeper will give quiet and relief. 1 oz. of alum added to rinsing water will make clothes practi- cally uninflammable—would only smoulder very slowly, never burst into flame. Care of the Hot-Water Bag:. These are not cheap things to buy, and are rather easily put out of order ; but this, in nine oases out of ten, is from carelessness, or not taking proper care of the bag. The reason of an indiarubber bag sticking is that it has been put away for the summer months with no air in it. When not using a bag, drain out the water, let it hang bottom side up for a while, then take it down and blow a little air into it, just enough to keep the inside from coming together, as it would if no air were in •, in which case the bag is quite sure to bo ruined in pulling it apart. If you happen to have a bag in this con- dition, put into it some hot water with a few drops of ammonia; let it remain a few minutes, then, with a thin, dull-edged piece of wood, try to separate the adhering sides very carefully. In preparing the hot-water bag for use, quite boiling water should not bo put into it, and neither should it bo more than half filled. After the water is in it, before putting in the stopper, carefully press out tho steam. This makes the bag softer, as it is relieved of the pressure the steam makes. Never fold a rubber bag after it has once been used. A flannel bag for covering the rubber is very useful, arid very easily made, and saves many a burn from contact with the hot bag. A book that should be in every home is Prof. Kirk’s Papers on Health. Accidents will happen, and reliable information, acted on promptly, would save many a life, and the simple common-sense advice on such subjects as Indigestion, Constipation, Pheumatism, Diet, etc., etc., would save a world of suffering. Tlie letters that come to the editor of this book from all over the world show the blessing Dr Kirk’s advice has brought to thousands. New illustrated edition, 3s; from all boqksellers.

Thread a needle, flat in the eye, with a strong thread, pass the head of the needle with care under the ring, and pull the thread through a few inches towards the hand. Wrap the long end of the thread tightly round the finger, regularly, all down towards the nail to reduce its size, then lay hold ,of the short end and unwind it. The thread repassing against the ring will gradually remove it from the finger. This never-failing method will remove the tightest ring with- out difficulty, however niuch swollen the finger may be. °242 TRIED FAYOVRITES COOKERY BOOK. USEFUL TO HEiVIEIVIBER Ifl COOKING. A Useful Hint. Most people understand that the placing of a marble in a kettle prevents furring, but very few seem to know that a large clean marble boiled in milk, porridge, custards, sauces, or stews will automatically do the stirring, as the liquid cooks. Any chance of burning will be prevented, and thus the fatigue of constantly stirring, and the cook’s time, can be saved, as by tliis means the cook can be attending to several things at once, instead of having tO' give her whole time and attention to one. A little cornflour added to the salt in the salt-cellar will prevent it hardening. ^ teaspoonful of cornflour to 2 tablespoonfuls of salt will be enough. A pinch of salt added to mustard prevents it souring. If soup, gravy, or vegetable is too salt, stir a little coarse sugar in, and the dish becomes palatable again. A little cedar powder sprinkled on the top of the kitchen stove, while cooking is going on, will prevent the smell of food spreading to other parts of the house. If, when using lemon for flavouring, you only need half of one, put the other half on a plate and cover with a glass tumbler. This excludes the air, and prevents it from dicing up or getting mouldy. To keep, lemons fresh and juicy keep in a cool place in a bowl of cold water. Leave plenty room for lemons to float easily in the bowl. When boiling rice, a few drops of lemon-juice or vinegar added to the water makes rice beautifully white and helps to separate grains. Nutmegs may be tested by pricking with a pin, and if they are good the oil will instantly spread around the puncture. In using cloves for pickles or preserves, the blossom end should be removed, as- it darkens the liquid. It will spoil the colour of red cabbage. When plates and dishes have to be warmed on oven top or in oven, if a newspaper is put underneath, it will break the heat and prevent plates from cracking. Dried orange peel will revive a low fire at once, placed among coals. Useful for sick-room—^no noise and pleasant perfume. Keep potato peelings, for, after being dried in the oven, they are very useful for lighting fires. They may be used instead of wood, and will make a fire bum up very quickly. Never throw away the wooden slcewers which come with joints from the butcher, but have them washed and kept in a kitchen drawer. They are useful in cleaning paint, to help the flannel into the niches and corners. When plates or dishes are burnt after baking, they can be easily cleaned by rubbing with a damp cloth dipped in salt. For burnt enamel pans, take a piece fine emery, damp it, and rub pan well. It does not need hard rubbing, as marks come out easily. Einse pan well in cold water. Pflour sprinkled on burning oil will at once extinguish it. When a fire is at its lowest, place a cork under the hot cinders, put a match to it, and it will immediately revive it.243 TRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY BOOK A lump of soda laid upon the sink-pipe down which waste water passes will prevent the clogging of tlie pipe with grease. Chloride of lime is an infallible preventive of rats. It should be put down their holes and spread about wherever they are likely to appear. If the cook has the misfortune to spill grease on the kitchen table, she may save herself a great deal of trouble by sprinkling the stain at onoe with coarse salt; this prevents the grease from sinking into the wood; or, if spilled on the floor, dash cold water over it, so as to harden it quickly, and prevent it sinking into the boards. Prepare new baking tins b^ placing in oven with thick layer of bran in them until bran is quite dry. Puddings, etc., will then never stick. To prevent tlie hands being burnt when dishing up Christmas puddings, put the hand repeatedly into cold water before handling the basin, and it will not be burnt. Do the same when using hot starch. Persons of sedentary and quiet occupations and habits, with much brain work, require food light and easily digested, avoiding all in- digestible and very concentrated foods (e.g., cheese), whieh are more suitable for manual work.

Emery poAvder will remove ordinaiy stains from white ivory knife handles. ' To Cement Lioosened Knife Handles at Home.—Mix 4 parts reain, 1 part bees’ wax, and 1 part plaster of Paris. Fill hole in handle with cement, then heat steel of handle nearly red-hot, and press it firmly into the cement. Scatter a mixture of borax and powdered sugar about tire haunts of cockroaches, and they will disappear. Or pour a strong solution of alum in boiling water over their happy hunting-ground. Clusters of cloves hung up in rooms and allowed to dry will drive away flies better than fly papers. Soak a tooth-brusli overnight in a glass of water, and it will pre- vent hairs coming out, and last twice as long. Sometimes a looking-glass loses “the grip,” and Avill not stay in position, the screw behind being useless. Tie a coloured ribbon rourid the. middle of a coi’k, and hang it at the side. Place it in proper position between glass and stand, and your trouble is at an end. To stop a leak, mix whiting and yellow soap into a thick paste with a little Avater. Apply this to the place where the leakage is, and it will be instantly stopped. A visit from the plumber will stiU be necessary, but there is no special hurry for more radical repairs. Corks may be made air-tight and water-tight by being immersed in oil for 5 minutes. A cork will fit any bottle if boiled for 6 minutes pi'eviously. A convenient substitute for a corkscrew Avhen the latter is not at hand may be found in the use of a common screw, with an -attached string to pull out the cork. Wliite paper should not be used for wrapping round articles that are to be put aAvay, for the chloride of lime in it will destroy the colour of the fabric. YelloAvish or blue paper is far the best for that purpose. Hot liquid may be poured with safety into any glass vessel by holding it up in the hand and not alloAving it to rest on the table. _ Newspapers laid smoothly inside dresses folded for packing will prevent creases. A package or envelope sealed Avith Avhite of egg cannot be steamed open. To keep away insects from birds’ cages, suspend a small bag of sulphur inside.

When needed, wash in wann scwip water and dry thoroughly. Wash silver ornaments in borax and water. To clean gold jewellery with the stones in, wash in warm suds, made with yellow soap, with 10 or 15 drops of sal-volatile in it. This makes jewellery veiy brilliant. When replacing stoppers in bottles, give them a twist round, and they will never stick. Egg-ahells crushed into small bits, and shaken well in water bottles, etc., three parts filled Avith cold water, will not only clean them thoroughly, but make the glass look like new. Glass bottles which have contained oil are very difficult to clean; but if they are required for any other purpose, try the following: — Fill the bottle with wishes, and place it in cold water, which heat gradually till it boils. Let it boil half an hour, then let the bottle remain in the water till cold. Then wash with soap-suds, rinsing in clear water. A candle may be made to fit any candlestick by dipping it in very hot water. Use squeezed lemons for cleaning brasses and dish covers.

Don’t allow to stand, but pour off and well dry. To preserve old furniture that is becoming worm-eaten, pour a little cai’bolio oil on to it, and rub well in. This will improve its ap- pearance. To Clean Leathei' Chairs.—Mix 1 part vinegar with 2 parts boiled linseed oil. Shake well. Apply sparingly, and polish well. Clean dirty chair covers by rubbing with hot bran. Steel ornaments on range can be made to shine like silver by rubbing with vinegar. A teaspoonful of ammonia in a basin of warm water will make hair-brushes beautifully white, but care must be taken not to let the back dip below the surface. Clean hair-brudies when afraid to wet backs by rubbing thor- oughly with flour, and, when quite clean, remove all traces of flour with dry towel. This also prevents bristles becoming soft. Clean old leather bags by dipping a sponge in warm water in which a little oxalic acid has been dissolved. ■ Shoes that have become stiff and uncomfortable by being worn IB the rain, or that have been lying unused for some time, can be made soft and pliable by vaseline well rubbed in with a cloth, and rubbed off with a dry one. If new boots won’t polish, rub over with half a lemon and leave till thoroughly dry. Kepeat once or twice if necessary. Boots and shoes, however damp, will polish in a few minutes if a drop or two of paraffin oil be added to the blacking. It prevents the leather from cracking. Vamish the soles of your boots, and it will render theiti impervious to damp, and will also make them larti longer.2i6 TRIED FAVOURITES COOKERY BOOK. A good mud bnasli for boots is made by glueing a strip of Brue* sela earpet to a convenient sized piece of wood. No injuiy to leather, and less dust and labour than, brush. To clean brown shoes, first rub them with a soft cloth dipped ‘i methylated spii’it; this will remove all stains and keep them a good colour. Then put the brown boot-cream on, and leave it on for a day or so without polishing. Finally, brush the shoes with a soft brush, and they will be much improved. To blacken brpwn boots. Take a raw potato ana cnt in halves. Rub over boots well. Then rub blacking well in. R( suit will be so satisfactory it will be difficult to say boots were not always black. Vaseline malces good dressing for brown shoes. Clean patent boots with milk, or a little sweet oil may be rubbed in. Mix 1 spoonful sweet oil and 2 spoonfuls of black ink, and apply with sponge to boots, black kid gloves, bags, and nisty book covers. Soles for boots or shoes cut from old felt hats are most comfort- able. If a boot or shoe pinches in any particular part, a cloth wrung out of veiy hot water and laid over the place while the boot is on the foot will expand the leather and give relief. Jet trimming, rusty and limp, may be made equal to new by mixing equal parts vinegar and water to cover, and letting it remain in basin 20 minutes. Remove, and leave to dry. Books which have had the leaves torn are best mended by pasting a piece of tissue paper over the entire page. The print is then visible through it. To frost windows. Dissolve some Epsom salts in hot water and make it strong as possible. Then wash it over the glass while hot with a brush. To Keep Moths out of Drawers. Mix together equal parts of oil of cedar, oil of cajeput, oil of cloves. Put a little of this on a bit of flannel and thoroughly rub the inside of the drawers with it. In course of time the wood will acquire a pleasant spicy scent, and moths will not go near them. Little bits of paper or anything else may be moistened with the oil and put amongst the clothes. Of course the oil should not be allowed to corne into actual contact with silks or things that could be marked by it, and it must be remembered that everjdhing should be well shaken before it is put away, as the oil will not kill moths or destroy their eggs if they are already there. For Green Fly on Geraniums. Apply 2 oz. soft soap, stirred into 1 gallon boiling water. Coffee grounds, cold tea, and tea-leaves are excellent for mixing tvith the earth in flower-pots, especially for feras. To Preserve Flowers. Add a spoonful of powdered charcoal to the vnter in which they are placed, and the flowers will last as long as though they were still on the plant without any need of changing the water; or dissolve a small piece of camphor in the water.SAFE AND SIMPLE HOME TREATMENT.

PERSONAL AND PRESS OPINIONS. sir HBNET LITTLEJOHN. M.D., s»yi: — “Ai I haT* always recognised, during nay profesaional lif«, that go^ cookery saTts monoy, and, what is of greater importance, secures healwy digoetio«, I haT® been a diligent reader of works on this pbject. None us pleased me more than one that caught my eye in Mr Fairg^ieTe's shop the other day, entitled ' Tried Favourites.' Clear in description, accurate m quantities, and strictly economical, it is just the book every housewife should have. It is published in an attractive, cheap form, and besides the recipes for ordinary dishes, the volume con tains many useful hints for every-day occurrences in domestic life."—Hbnby D. Litti>ejohn, M.D., Medical Officer of Health, Edinburgh. I have been often asked to name a cheap, concise, and reliable cookery book. There are so m^y books on the market all claiming to be the only one that I have never liMn able to make any choice in the matter, and I have thought it bettor to lot my readers join in the cookery book gamble and spend a few shillings in the purchase of experience. Just lately, how- ever, a cookery book has been brought to my notice which seems so admir- ably suited for a homo of moderate income that I think I do a service to my readers by mentioning it. It is called “Tried Favourites"; _ the recipes it contains ora all eminently practical, the instructions are given in the most simple and unmistakable language, and, while variety is the aim of the book throughout, the needs of the middle-class home may be said to be its keynotes.—Franotes, in “T.P.'s Webklt." Again I have the pleasure of announcing the “debut" of anoiher edition of that culinary wonder of the age—“Tried Favourites"—wHch, like Tennyson's brook, “goes on for ever." No other cookery book ever yet had sueh a run of popularity, and did I not hold so high an opinion oi the sonnd and reliable recipes it contains I should certainly feel quite jealous of Mrs Eirk—the clever compiler of this valuable book.—Mbs Minnie Dowib in “Weekly Scotsman."

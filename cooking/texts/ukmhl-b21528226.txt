In preparing a People’s Edition of the Model Cookery Book, the Publishers have been careful that such receipts should be selected as would best suit the requirements of housekeepers with small incomes. At the same time a few dishes have been added for home entertainments, &rc., of a rather more expensive kind. Plain cooks will find full instructions in it, by which they may execute any receipts hereafter placed in their hands, and it is hoped that by all readers this condensation of the “ Model Cookery ” will be found generally useful.

HINTS TO HOUSEKEEPERS. CW the Lady of the house devolves the tafek of providing food for her household ; i^ should be her care that no waste or iemorant misuse shall squander the property o. her husband—most frequently the bread- winner for the family—and that nothing is wpt by carelessness or bad cookery. She is to take care that there is no lack through fault of hers, nor any drawback to domestic comfort through injudicious rule ; no neglect caused by the love of idle pleasure. A lady will find it best to give her servants orders for the day, before breakfast, if con- venient, and, to do this well, she must visit the larder herself early that she may judge of what is required. Her cook should have a book-slate and pencil, andentertheorders for dinner on one leaf of it that there may be* no mistakes made in them. On the other leaf she should be ordered to enter daily the amount of milk, bread, &c., bought on the previous day, which the mistress should then transfer to her commonplace book, to be entered in the account-book at the end of the week. Pay all your bills, if possible, every week. If some few remain to be paid quarterly, do not on that account delay to examine them weekly, and to make up the week’s accounts. You will then be sure of your expenditure. 1 ake care that the butcher always brings a ticket of weight with the meat ; and have those weight tickets brought to you weekly in order that you may compare them with the entries in your book. All meat brought into the house should be weighed to see if the ticket is correct, and for this purpose a pair of scales should be kept in the kitchen ; groceries, &c., should also be tested as to weight on receipt of them. Ascertain the price of every article of food in your neighbourhood ; as prices differ with localities, and that which might be economical food in one place is frequently the reverse in another. In order to learn prices, do not disdain to market for your- self, if you are your own housekeeper. You will thus be able by personal observation to learn which are the best shops for different articles, and what are the fair rates of pay- ment for them. It is also essential that a housekeeper should know the average weekly consumption of food for each person in an ordinary family, that she may be able to check waste and provide provisions for any period she may desire. For this pur- pose we subjoin a list of the usual allow- ances, which will of course vary very much from differing circumstances ; but it will give a general idea on the subject, which personal experience will modify :— Food for one Person Weekly. Tea, two ounces. Coffee, a quarter of a pound (if for break- fast only). Cocoa paste, a quarter of a pound, for breakfasts. Sugar, half a pound. Cheese, half a pound. Butter, half a pound. Milk, one quart ; varying with the taste of the family. Bread, eight pounds for a woman, six- teen pounds for a man or boy. Meat, six pounds. Beer, one gallon for a woman, seven quarts for a man. Potatoes, three and half pounds. Of course this estimate of quantities must be modified greatly by the habits and tastes of the family, and by the fact of resi- dence either in the town or country. A large supply of vegetables, fish, or puddings will greatly reduce the scale of meat; and making tea and coffee for num- bers will reduce the amount of those articles. \Ve merely give this general idea of quantity to guide, in a measure, the inexperienced BHints to Housekeepers. 2 5. Mouse buttock. or Head. 14. Brisket. housewife. We should have been thankful for such knowledge ourselves, as without it one invariably buys more than is actually needed for the consumption of the house- hold. With regard to meat, an allowance must be made for its waste in cooking, and also for the weight of bone found in every joint, except buttock of beef. Having advanced thus far in our know- ledge of housekeeping, the next step is how' te choose meat, and in order to do this well we must know the names of the different joints. An ox is divided by the butcher into the following joints :—London style. 1. Sirloin. 2. Top, or aitch-bone. 3. Rump. 4. Buttock, or round. 6. Veiny piece. 7. Thick flank. 8. Thin flank. | 9- Leg. ] 10. Fore rib (5 ribs). 11. Middle rib (4 ribs). 12. Chuck rib (3 ribs). 13. Shoulder, or leg-of- mutton piece. 15. Clod. 16. Sticking. 17. Shin. 18. Cheeks.3 Hints to Housekeepers. 7. Neck, scrag end. 11. Head. HOW TO MARKET. We advise our lady housekeepers to market for themselves ; but as some skill is required in a purchaser (if this duty is to be performed to advantage), we will endeavour to give directions by which inexperienced housewives may be enabled to select good articles. First in the list comes butcher's meat; of which beef is considered the best by the generality of English people. An ox should be kept five or six years before it is killed ; it is then in its prime. Ox-beef is the best. It is a fine grained meat; the lean of a A calf is cut into the following joints :— 1. Loin, best end. 2. Loin, chump end. 3. Fillet. 4. Hind knuckle. B 3 5. Fore knuckle. 6. Neck, best end. 8. Blade bone. 9. Breast, best end. 10. Breast, brisket end4 Hints to Housekeepers. bright-red colour, intermingled with grains of fat, when it is well fed and good. The fat should be white, not yellow, and the suet also white and firm. Beef should never be lean ; it is tough and bad unless there is a good quantity of fat. Heifer- beef is paler than ox-beef, and closer grained ; the fat whiter, and the bones, of course, smaller. Bull-beef is only described to be avoided. It is dark coloured and coarse grained ; has very little fat, and a strong meaty smell about it. Of these joints choose the rib or sirloin, for roasting. If you purchase ribs of beef, let them be the middle ribs. You may have one, two, three, or four ribs, as you will ; but one rib is too thin to be economical, as it dries up in cooking. If, however, your family be small, a single rib, with the bones taken out, rolled, and stuffed, will make a nice little roast. If you buy a sirloin, take care to have it cut from the chump end, which has a good under cut or fillet, as then, in addition to a roast joint, you will have A SHEEP is thus divided :— 1. Leg. 2. Chump end of loin. 3. Best end of loin. 4. Neck, best end. 5. Neck, scrag end. 6. Shoulder. 7. Breast. A saddle is the two loins undivided. A chine is the two sides of the neck undivided.Hints to Housekeepers. 5 3> 4' 5' together, Fore-quarter. another dish, i.c., fillcts-dc-bceuf, one of the best dishes ever served. The rump is preferred to the sirloin by epicures ; but it is too large to serve whole. A sufficiently large joint is cut from the chump end to roast. For the servants' hall, or as a dinner for a large family where economy is essential, the buttock of beef is excellent, and very profi- table. It is cheaper than the other roasting portions of the ox, has no bones, and affords quantities of rich gravy. But it should be hung for some time until quite tender. The round, aitchbone, and silver- side arc usually salted and boiled. The neck is used for making soup or gravy—ask for it as "gravy beefthe thin flank is the part to be collared. A " rumpsteak "is to be ordered for frying, &c. A "beefsteak" does for stewing, puddings, pies, &c. The inferior and cheaper parts of beef make excellent bouilli—a dish for which you will find directions in the body of the book. Veal should be small and white, and the kidney well covered with fat. The calf should not be older than eight or ten weeks when-it is killed, or the flesh will be coarse. If veal is large it should be cheaper, as it is less delicate. The flesh should be dry, closely grained, and white ; if it is moist and clammy it is stale, and not fit for cook- ing. The fillet, loin, shoulder, and best end of the neck are the roasting joints. The A Lamb is divided thus i. Leg. | 2. Loin. | 3. Shoulder. | 4. Breast. | 5. Ribs.Hints to Housekeepers. breast is sometimes roasted in very small families, but it is usually stewed, as is also the knuckle ; or the knuckle may be boiled, and served with parsley and butter. A calf s head is a delicacy. Calf's feet are also valuable boiled, stewed, or used for jelly. Veal makes the best stock for rich soups and gravies. It is a most useful meat for made dishes of all kinds, on account of its delicate flavour. Mutton.—Wether mutton is the best. It may be known by its having a knob of fat on the upper part of the leg. It should be dark coloured and have plenty of fat. The colour is important, as it is a proof of age, and the older mutton is the better it is. It should, properly, be the flesh of a shec-p four or five years old, to be in perfection, but such meat is rarely to be bought at a butcher s ; one tastes it only at the houses of countrygentlemenwhokilltheirown animals. All the joints of a sheep may be roasted. The saddle is the best. The haunch is next best to the saddle ; it is the leg and loin undivided. The leg and neck are fre- quently boiled. The leg and loin, sepa- rated, are the best joints after the haunch. Chops are cut from the loin ; cutlets from the thick end of the loin, best end of the neck, or middle of the leg. The leg is sometimes cured and smoked as a ham. The breast of mutton is often salted and A deer is cut up in four portions. i. Haunch, a. Neck. 3. Shoulder. 4. Breast.7 Hints to Housekeepers. 4. Fore loin. 6. Leg. boiled. The scrag end of mutton is very good stewed with rice. Lamb should be small; of a pale coloured red, and fat. Lamb is generally roasted. The leg of “house lamb” (which is in season just before Christmas), is sometimes boiled and served with white sauce. Venison. — Venison is not very often bought, but when it is you can tell as to its being “high” or not, by running a, skewer into the shoulder, and observing the scent on it when withdrawn. The fat should be thick and clean. If the cleft of the haunch is smooth and close, the animal is young. Pork. — Euy pork of a respectable butcher; or get it from some place where you know it has been carefully fed ; from a dairy farm is the best place, or from a miller's, or even from some country neigh- bour, as diseased or bad pork is very dan- gerous food. The fat of pork should be firm, and the lean white, and finely grained. The rind or skin thin and smooth. If the flesh feels clammy to the touch the pork is bad. If the fat has kernels in it the pig has been measly, and the meat should not be eaten. Pork should be perfectly sweet to | be good, therefore do not hang it long. The pig is divided thus :— 1. Spare rib. 2. Hand. 3. Belly. 5. Hind loin.Hints to Housekeepers. 8 Bacon.—If bacon is good the rind is thin, the fat firm and pinkish, the lean tender and adhering to the bone. Rusty bacon has yellow streaks in it. Hams are tried by sticking a knife or skewer into them up to the knuckle ; if when drawn out it has a nice smell, the ham is good. A bad scent will be perceived if it is tainted. The roasting joints of pork are the spare rib, loin, and leg; the other joints are salted ; the leg may also be cured and boiled. The sides or flitches are made into bacon. The leg makes a ham. Meat should be wiped with a dry, clean cloth as soon as it comes from the butcher's ; flyblows should be cut out, and in loins, the long pipe that runs by the bone should be taken out, as it soon taints ; the kernels also should be removed from beef. Never re- ceive bruised joints. If you wish to keep your meat hanging longer than ordinary, dredge it well with pepper. Powdered charcoal dusted over it will also prevent its tainting, nay, will absolutely remove the taint from meat already gone. We have seen a pair of fowls quite green from un- avoidably long keeping made fresh and sweet as ever by being sprinkled with powdered charcoal for an hour before dressing. In hot summers it is very ad- visable to keep a lump of charcoal in the larder. Meat becomes more digestible and tender by hanging, but lamb and veal can- not be kept so well as beef and mutton. Remember that the best, and therefore the dearest joints are the most economical in the end, because they contain more solid meat than the others ; but very large joints are not economical for a small family ; nor are they as wholesome as our old fashioned English prejudices once'deemed them. Poultry and Game, to Choose. Tukkey.—The cock bird, when young, has a smooth black leg with a short spur. The eyes are bright and full, and the feet supple, when fresh ; the absence of these signs denotes age and staleness ; the hen may be judged by the same rules. Fowls.—The young cock has a smooth leg and a short spur ; when fresh, the vent is close and dark. Hens, when young, have smooth legs and combs ; when old, these will be rough ; a good capon has a thick belly and large rump, a poll comb, and a swelling breast. Geese.—In young geese the feet and bills will be yellow and free from hair. When fresh, the feet are pliable ; they are stiff when stale. Ducks may be selected bv the same rules. Pigeons, when fresh, have supple feet, and the vent will be firm ; if discoloured they are stale. Plovers, when fat, have hard vents ; but like almost all other birds, may be chosen by the above rules. Hares.—When a hare is young and fresh, the cleft in the lip is narrow, the body stiff, and the claws are smooth and sharp ; old and stale hares will be the opposite of this. Rabbits the same. In order to ascer- tain whether a hare is young or old, turn the claws sideways ; if they crack it is young. The ears also should be tender, and capable of bending easily. Partridges.—Yellow legs and dark bill are signs by which a young bird may be known ; a rigid vent when fresh. When this part is green the bird is stale. Pheasants may be chosen as above; the young birds are known by the short or round spur, which in the old is long and pointed. Moor Game. — Grouse, Woodcocks, Snipes, Quails, Ortolans, &c., may be chosen by the rules above given. Choose white legged fowls for boiling, and dark for roasting. To Choose Fish. The eyes of fish, if fresh, are bright, the gills of a fine clear red, the body stiff, and the smell not unpleasant. Chloride of soda will restore fish that is not extremely fresh, but it is never so good as when it has not been kept. A turbot should be thick ; the under side of a pale yellowish white, the colour of rich cream. The salmon and the cod should have a small head, very thick shoulders, and a small tail. The flesh of the salmon should be of a bright red colour, the scales very bright. Do not buy herrings, mackerel, or whit- ings unless quite fresh, and do not attempt to keep them even till the next day. Cod may be kept twenty-four hours. Soles the same. Eels should be bought alive. Crabs and lobsters should be heavy and very stiff; if they feel limp they are stale. They are often bought alive. Oysters, if fresh, will dose forcibly on the knife when opened. If the shell gapes in the least degree, the oyster is losing its freshness. When the fish is dead the shell remains open. Small • ‘ natives ” are the best oysteYs for eating ; for sauces or other culinary purposes the larger kinds are good enough. To Choose Eggs. Shake the eggs ; if they are bad they will rattle, But we think the best plan is to put9 Hints to Housekeepers. them in a basin of water, and see if they lie on their side, down in it. If the egg turns upon its end it is bad ; if it lies obliquely, it is only not quite fresh, but may do for pud- dings, &c. M. Soyer tells us that the ' ‘ safest way is to hold them up to the light, forming a focus with your hand ; should the shell be covered with small dark spots they are very doubt- ful.” . . . " If, however, in looking at them you see no transparency in the shells, you may be sure they are rotten and only fit to be thrown away. The most precise way is to look at them by the light of a candle ; if quite fresh there are no spots upon the shells, and they have a brilliant light yellow tint." Eggs to be preserved for use should be quite fresh from the nest. To Choose Vegetables. Take care that they are fresh looking and crisp. Potatoes.-- We think the best are the walnut-leaf kidney for summer and the re- gents for winter use. But tastes differ so much with regard to potatoes that we can only advise buying them of the best and most respectable dealers. To Choose Apples. In choosing apples, be guided by the weight; the heaviest are the best, and those should always be selected which, on being pressed by the thumb, yield to it with a slight crackling noise. Prefer large appies to small, for waste is saved in peeling and coring them. Apples should be kept on dry straw in a dry place, and pears hung up by the stalk. The Store-Room. Every lady should have a small closet for her stores if she has not a regular store- room. Groceries should always be bought in quantities, if possible ; thus the turn of the scale and the weight of paper, &c., is saved. At certain seasons of the year some articles may be bought cheaper than at others. Advantage should be taken of any fall in the market. A book should be kept in the store-room to enter the date when each store is bought, and at what price. The store-room should be very dry, and furnished with drawers, shelves, and nails with a few little nets suspended from them for hanging lemons in. It should contain also earthenware jars for sugars, and tins for keeping tea, coffee, and biscuits. The large or small tins in which biscuits arc sold should be retained for these uses. Jams, pickles, and preserves should be kept in the coolest part of the room or closet. Coffee should not be bought in large quantities, be- cause it soon loses its flavour; unless, indeed, it is roasted at home, which isa very economi- cal plan for large families. It can be bought very cheaply unroasted ; if purchased by the twenty-eight pounds it can be had at one shilling per pound ; and there is a roaster (peculiar to Ireland) which is turned over the fire like a mop, that any one can use with ease, to prepare it whenever required. Loaf sugar should be very white, close, heavy, and glittering; it is economy to buy the best, as the more refined the sugar is, the less the quantity required for sweetening. Moist or brown sugar should have a crystalline, sparkling look, and should not be too powdery or sandlike. Tallow candles should be bought in large quantities if possible, and purchased in the winter, as they keep best when made in cold weather. They should be kept several months in a cool place before they are used. Soap should be bought by the hundred weight for cheapness, and kept long before it is used. It should be cut in pieces fit for use, and then put in a drawer to dry and harden slowly, without being exposed to the air ; for if it were to dry quickly it would be likely to break when used. Mottled soap is the most economical; the best yellow soap melts much more rapidly in water. Soft soap for washing linen is a saving of half the quantity; therefore it is economical, though dearer in price than hard soap. Soda, by softening the water, saves soap. Starch should be left in a warm, dry place. Sugar, sweetmeats, and salt must all be kept very dry. Rice, tapioca, sago, &c., should be kept close covered, or they will get insects in them ; it is better not to have large supplies of these articles. Buy lemons in June or July when they are freshly imported, and hang them in separate nets, for if they touch they will spoil. Onions, shallots, and garlic should be hung in ropes from a ceiling in an out-housc [not in the store-room) ; and parsley, basil, savor)', knotted marjoram, and thyme should be dried and hung up in paper bags, each bag containing only one description ofherb. They should be dried in the wind and not in the sun, and when ordered in a receipt should be cautiously used, as a prepon- derance of one flavour in any seasoning spoils it. When oranges or lemons are squeezed for juice, chop down the peel, put it in small pots and tie it down for use. Vegetables will keep best on a stone floor, out of the air,Hints to Housekeepers. Eggs may be preserved by brushing them all over the shell with a thin solution of gum and laying them in bran. Some persons brush them over with oil ; in fact anything which will render the shell impervious to the air suffices for the purpose of preserving them. Suet may be kept for a twelvemonth, thus: choose the firmest and most free from skin or veins, remove all trace of these, put the suet in a saucepan at some distance from the fire, and let it melt gradually ; when melted pour it into a pan of cold spring water ; when hard, wipe it dry, fold it in white paper, put it into a linen bag, and keep it in a dry cool place : when used it must be scraped ; it will make an excellent pie-crust, either with or without butter. The trouble of housekeeping is much diminished by having a fixed day for giving out to the cook the tea, sugar, coffee, plums, &c., which are likely to be required during the coming week ; weighing out the quantities in proportion to the number of the family. Every week she should account for these quantities/ bringing back whatever may chance to remain over and above her use. The spice-box in the kitchen should be occasionally replenished from the store- room. Keeping Accounts. So many good Housekeeper's-books are now published that much need not be said as to the mode of entry. But we think daily expenses are too minute in small families to be entered under all the various headings in most of the books with printed lists. The housewife is advised to keep a tiny MS. book and pencil in her pocket, and enter at the moment everything she buys or receives in the course of the day. This little record may be examined once a week, and its con- tents (so far as they relate to housekeeping) entered in the family account-book. The cook should produce her slate to check the lady's accounts, and the amount should be carefully added up. We prefer ourselves a plain ruled account- book without printed items. Then on one side, the left, we enter whatever money we receive during the week ; on the opposite page the outlay we have made, which, when added up, can be subtracted at the bottom of the left page from the money re- ceived ; a weekly check is thus placed on the expenditure, which is continually compared with the means of payment. It is well to have a fixed sum for house- keeping which may not be exceeded. 1 f any amount may be left, it is a good reserve lund for extra expenses, or for charity. Ready reckoners* will be found of great use both to save time and also to help those \vho are slow at figures. One of them should always be kept lying next to or on the housekeeper's-book. Butchers bills require careful weekly supervision, even when not paid till the quarter has elapsed, as errors in weight, even of ounces, or of price, as of farthings, t come to a considerable item in the course of the year. The memoranda of weight should be also compared with the book. One morning every week will suffice for these accounts, and, if faithfully carried out, the practice will be attended with a constant improvement in economy and good house- keeping. Dripping is most useful in a moderate family. It is an excellent medium for frying ; it will make good family pie-crust, and sup- ply the place of suet in a dumpling. Bones are absolutely necessary for making gravies and stock for soup. Take care that butter is kept in a cot place and covered from the air. In summe get some saltpetre, dissolve it in cold water and stand the butter crock in it, so that thi saltpetre water may reach well up the sides. Cover it over with a wet cloth, the ends of which resting in the saltpetre water will keep it constantly moist. This is nearly as good as icing the butter. Milk should be kept in scrupulously clean vessels, and stale and fresh milk should never be mixed, or the good will be spoiled. Set apart from your income yearly a small sum to be invested in replacing worn house- hold linen. Buy occasionally a tablecloth, a pair of sheets, &c., See. You will feel these purchases much less than having to supply a whole stock of linen at once. House linen should be looked over every six weeks or quarter, and carefully repaired. We like lavender-bags among the linen, to give it a fresh agreeable smell; but some persons assert that they bring moth. If you observe iron-moulds on the linen, speak at once to the laundress on the sub- ject. It is possible she throws the washing cloths on a brick floor, which will cause iron-mould as soon as rusty iron does. * See Warne’s “ Model Ready Reckoner.” f “ My Market Table,”Food in Season. i i FOOD IN SEASON FOR EACH MONTH OF THE YEAR.

The young and inexperienced house- keeper will, we believe, be glad of some guidance in the selection of the utensils needed in her kitchen, so that she may not be at the mercy of those who desire more than is really required, or who are ignorant of the necessity and use of many articles of the first importance in the art. With a view to helping our readers to decide in this mat- Kitchen Utensils absolutely ter for themselves, we offer them here three lists of the articles absolutely essential in the kitchen. The first list is for a first-rate kitchen, the second for a medium one, the third for a cottage home.

The cook should be careful to keep them always clean and fresh. The moment she has ceased using one she should pour boiling water into it to wash it, and she should never put one away dirty. Saucepan. Braising-pan. Stewpan. Preserving Pan. for malting Bain-marie Pan and Pots, for jams, jellies, marmalades, &-c. keeping sauces and entries hot, &c. btock-pot. Braising Pan.—The food to be braised is put into the lower part of the pan. The lid is covered well with red-hot ashes or charcoal. Full directions for braising are given farther on. The stew-pan is a valu- able utensil; it will in case of need serve as a braising pan, if the lid be made to go a little into the edge of the pan as some are made. Stock Pot.—The stock pot receives in it bones, trimmings of meat, remains of cold game, &c. &c., in short everything available for ordinary or good soup. It is to be wished that every English artizan’s wife possessed one ; it is the pot-au-feu of the French workman, who thus obtains nourish- ing soup and well-dressed meat at the same time,'4 K itchen Utonsils. Saucepan Digester. Stcwpan Digester. The Patent "Digester ” cannot be too warmly recommended to those who have need to practise economy. The mode of using it is simple and easy. Care must be taken in filling a digester to leave room enough for the steam to pass off through the valve at the top of the cover. This may be done by filling the digester only three-parts full of water and bruised bones or meat, which it is to be noticed are all to be put in together. It must then be placed near a slow fire, so as only to simmer (more heat injures the quality), and this it must do for the space of eight or ten hours. After this has been done, the soup is to be strained through a hair sieve or colander, in order to separate any bits of bones. The soup is then to be put into the digester again, and afterwards whatever vegetables, spices, &c., are thought necessary are added, the whole is to be well boiled together for an hour or two, and it will be then fit for immediate use. In putting on the lid of the digester, take care that a mark, thus (X) on the lid, is opposite to a similar one on the digester. The digester may also be obtained to con- tain from four quarts to ten gallons. The saucepan and stewpan digesters hold from one to eight quarts. Salmon or Jack Kettle. Turbot Kettle. Fish Kettle.

It retains the heat better from being fluted instead of plain, and renders it unnecessary to touch the Trussing Needle, for trussing poultry, steak with the beef tongs. It shuts (as shown in the engraving) over the steak or chop, and can be turned over from one side to the other, as the cook pleases, till the meat is dressed.

Scales and Weights. Scales. As one of the great elements of success in cooking is preciseness in the proportions of ingredients, the cook should never be without a good pair of scales, and she should keep them in thorough order. In delicate dishes an unequal propoitio i. of an article inserted only to impart a certain flavour, will ruin the dish. The necessity as well as use of scales is therefore obvious. French Vegetable Cutter, for cutting carrots and turnips in various shapes, for soups, haricots, garnishing, &c. When you use this machine, lay the disc or plate you have selected in the place prepared for it in the machine, with the sharp or cutting side upwards. Cut the vegetables into thin slices ; lay a slice on the disc and press down the handle of the machine, which will force the vegetable on the disc. Then lay a second slice on the disc, pressing down the handle as before, and the slice first laid on will be forced through, cut into small pieces of the required shape. This may be repeated as often as necessary till the quantity is sufficient ; the pieces remaining in the disc should be pushed out with a fork. “The Cottager’s Stove,” WHICH REQUIRES NO BRICKWORK TO FIX IT. A a Tin Kettle, holding seven quarts. B an Iron Cover, which forms an additional oven on the top of the hot plate. C Toaster. D Saucepan to fit the top. Directions.—When coal is used, the front and bottom gratings will be required. When wood is used these may be removed. To improve the Draught if necessary.— Carry the flue-pipe a few feet up the chim- ney, or enclose the fireplace with an iron plate, in which cut outr' round hole for the pipe to pass through.Kitchen Utensils. J9 To use the Stove in the open air, it will be necessary to have about ten feet of perpen- dicular pipe, to ensure a proper draught. Economy in the use of fuel is not to be neglected by the housekeeper. Cinders should be carefully sifted. The grate (if the ordinary one alone be possessed) should be screwed in as soon as the fire for cooking is no longer required. The fire at the back of the open range may then be made of small coals, wetted and left to cake. Cinders may be used for ironing stoves, and for heating ovens. The Cottager’s Stove will be found an economical assistant to the common open range in small kitchens. Ordinary Jelly Moulds. Plain Directions for Roasting, &c. How to Roast.—Roasting meat, though one of the commonest modes of dressing it, is by no means an easy task. Roast meat is too often sent to table nearly raw, or dried up till there is scarcely any gravy in it. Now good roasting consists in dressing the joint the r rughly, and yet retaining its juices in it. The cook should prepare her fire some little time before she puts the meat down. The grate should be let out sufficiently wide to take in the whole size of the joint, with a margin to spare on each side, and the fire should be so good as not to require making up during the time the joint is roasting ; it should be sufficiently large to be of an equal strength all the time the meat is dressing, aided by a large coal put on the top of it occasionally. A great deal of the success in roasting will depend on the heat and good- ness of the fire. Begin roasting by placing the meat at some distance from the fire (about eighteen inches), and baste it from the first. When it is half done, move it gradually nearer to the fire for it to be well browned. If the meat were to be put close to the fire at first, it would diy up, and the outside would be dressedbefore the heat had penetrated the mass ; the juices being thus shut in, the joint would be under-dressed. Some persons prefer meat roasted very slowly. That method is expensive, because it requires a large fire to be kept up for a length of time ; and also, unless done by a cook who understands her business well, and who makes a fire fit for it, the meat is apt to get sodden. We need scarcely say that the meat screen should be placed behind it from the first of its being put down. Cover the fat of veal or lamb with a piece of paper tied on with twine. Baste the meat very frequently, for the Jelly Bag, used for Straining Jelly. more it is basted the better it will eat. When it is nearly done, the paper over the fat maybe removed, and the joint lightly dredged with flour, in order to give it a savoury brown appearance called frothing. Sprinkle a very little salt on it also ; but not till it is just ready to dish up, as salt draws out the gravy. The usual time allowed for roasting is a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes for each pound of meat. But this rule does not always answer. Meat fresh killed takes longer to roast than when it has been kept long ; and in warm weather it takes less time than in cold. Brown meats require less time than white meats do. In frosty weather, it is better to lay the joint before the fire to thaw before it is put on the spit, as, if frozen, it will be impossible to calculate the time required for dressing it, and in fact it will never be dressed through. The cook should always be careful that the spit, and also the hook used in the bottle-jack, be wiped before they are used. She should also be careful how she hangs the meat, so as to avoid disfiguring it by running the spit through the prime parts. Cradle spits are much the best for large kitchens ; for small families, the bottle-jack in a tinned screen does very well, or, better still, the improved spring-jack and roaster. Let the butcher chop the joints of necks and loins of mutton and lamb before they are dressed, or they cannot be well sepa- rated by the carver when they are sent to table. When the roast meat has been taken up, the fat which has dripped from it into the pan should be poured into a basin pre-20 How to Boil and Broil. viously clipped in cold water. It must be left till the next day, when beneath the fat at the top will be found a fine meat jelly fit for gravies, &c. The cake of dripping should be melted and strained into cold water, from which it can be removed in cakes for future use. Veal, pork, and lambshould be thoroughly done, not retaining any red gravy ; at the same time, care should be taken not to dry them up, or roast them till the flesh parts from the bones. Mutton does not take quite the length of time to roast that beef does. A very economical way of making gravy is to skim the fat from the dripping in the pan under the meat, and pour two or three spoonfuls of hot water into it ; stir it, and pour it over the meat through a sieve. How to Boil. Joints to be boiled should be washed ex- tremely clean and skewered into good shape; then they should be put in the saucepan and covered well with cold water. They must be set over a moderate fire and let boil slowly. Just before the water reaches boiling-point the scum will rise to the top, and must be carefully skimmed off; if not done at the moment of ebullition it will fall back on the joint boiling and disfigure it. The pot will require skimming every time the scum rises ; the saucepan must be kept covered all the time, however, the lid being only removed for the cook to skim the pot. Gentle simmering, not fast boiling, is most desirable for meat, as by quick boil- ing the outside is hardened before the joint is done, and the meat becomes hard and tough. Salted meat requires longer boiling than fresh meat; when smoked and dried, it takes longer still. Pickled or salted meat should be soaked before boiling in cold water, for a longer or shorter time as its saltness and size may require. Take care that the joint, if large, does not adhere to the bottom of the pot ; to prevent this pos- sibility cooks sometimes put a few wooden skewers at the bottom under it. The time allowed for boiling is from a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes for each pound, supposing of course that the fire is kept up to an equal temperature all the time. Quick boiling is very much to be avoided; but the pot should never be al- lowed to stop simmering. First-rate, cooks preserve the whiteness of their boiled'meats, and save them from in- sipidity, by not boiling them in water, but using instead a sort of broth called poile, or I another called blanc. But these prepara-1 tions are very expensive, and are not required for ordinary use. For people who cannot af- ford expensive cooking, a well-floured cloth wrapped round the meat to be boiled will make it white; but the cloth must be kept very clean, and should be boiled in pure water after each time it is used ; moreover, it must not be suffered to get damp, or it will give a musty flavour to the meat. How to Broil. Many kinds of fish, steaks, chops, and cutlets are far better broiled than fried ; but much care, niceness, and skill are required to broil properly. First, the fire should be perfectly free from smoke, though brisk, and giving out a good heat; secondly, the gridiron should be scrupulously clean, well heated, and rubbed over with mutton suet before the meat is put on it. If the fire be too fierce, the meat will be hardened and scorched ; if it be too dead, the gravy will escape and the meat will be flabby. The gridiron should be held slopingly over the fire in order that the fat may run off to the back of the grate, for if it dropped on the coals it would create a blaze, and blacken and smoke the meat. If by chance a blaze should spring up during the time the steak, &c., is broiling, the gridiron must be caught off the fire and held on one side till the blaze is gone ; a little salt thrown on the fire will make it clear again. Fish should be wrapped in a piece of well-buttered letter- paper before they are placed on the grid- iron, to preserve them from smoke, and prevent their becoming too dry ; the gridiron may be rubbed with a little chalk first. Cutlets which are covered with egg and bread crumbs, must be dipped in a little clarified butter before they are put on the gridiron. The best way, however, is to season the cutlet with pepper, and brush it over with a little butter before it is broiled. Steaks and chops should be turned often in order that they may be done in every part, but the fork used for this purpose should never be stuck into the lean of the steak, as it would let the gravy escape; it must be put into the outer skin or fat. All kitchens ought to be provided with steak-tongs for this purpose. Birds when cut asunder and broiled, must be laid with the inside first to the fire. Most people prefer broiled mutton chops or beefsteaks rather lightly dressed, but lamb and pork chops should be thoroughly cooked. Everything broiled should be served the moment it is done, very hot. The dish should be kept ready to receive if ip front of the fire,21 How to Stew and Fry. When fish are broiled without paper, great care should be taken to have the grid- iron very hot before they are put on it, and to rub the bars with butter. To preserve the skin of the fish entire when broiled, it should (after being washed and cleansed) be rubbed well with vinegar, dried in a cloth, and floured. The flour will keep it from adhering to the bars. A cinder or charcoal fire is best for broiling fish. While you are broiling slices of cold meat, put into a hot dish a piece of butter the size of a walnut and a teaspoonful of ketchup— melt them together, and lay the meat from the gridiron on the gravy made by these ingredients as soon as it is done. How to Stew. Stewing is a wholesome, excellent, and economical mode of cooking. Very little fuel is used for it, and meat so prepared is both digestible and delicious. But boiling is not stewing; and we warn our readers that all we have said in praise of it may be reversed if they let the stewing-pan do more than simmer very gently. Stewing is best done over a regular stove ; but when a cook can command only an old-fashioned kitchen- range she must place her stew-pan on trivets high above the fire, and constantly watch it, and move it nearer to, or further from the fire. Stewing must of course always be done over a slow fire, and the stew-pan lid should shut quite closely. It should be kept at a gentle simmer, without letting it boil, and it must stew for several hours, according to the weight of the meat, which is hot to be considered done until it is quite tender. Sometimes the cook stews the meat in a jar, placed in a stew-pan full of water, and thus extracts the pure gravy unmixed with water. We have, also, a recipe for stewing meat and vegetables to- gether, without water being put in the jar with them, thus making an excellent soup from the union of the pieces of the meat and the water contained in the vegetables. How to Fry, Cooks should always have twofrying-pans, and a third, not much bigger than a large plate, for omelets, fritters, &c., if they have no saute-pan. The pan must be kept deli- cately clean and nice ; the butter, dripping, lard, or oil in which the fish, meat, &c., is fried must always be boiling hot before the meat is put into the pan. The rule is that a sufficient quantity of fat must be heated thus in the pan, to cover the steak, chop, or whatever is to be fried—frying being ac- tually boiling in fat instead of water. Mutton chops do not require any fat in the pan with them ; they have enough in them- selves, but they must be often turned and moved about to prevent them from burning. Of course we speak only of chops cooked quite plain—i.e., without being egged and bread-crumbed. Cut and skin the chop nicely, and season it with a little pepper before putting it in the pan. Lamb cutlets, and lamb chops, must be egged and bread-crumbed twice, in order to look well. Steaks should be cut three-quarters of an inch thick for frying, and should be pep- pered, but not have salt put on them before they are dressed, as it makes them hard. When done, a little salt is sprinkled lightly over them. Cutlets, a la maintenon, and mullet are fried in buttered paper covers. The first process in frying is to put enough dripping or butter in your pan to cover the chop or steak when the butter is melted. Then the fat must be made to boil in the pan, and when at its greatest heat the sub- stance to be fried must be plunged into it. The pan must then be lifted from the fire for a minute or two, to prevent the outside from getting black before the inside is dressed. Fish must be well dried before frying, in a cloth well sprinkled with flour; or first they may be wiped well, thoroughly dried and dredged with flour. Then an egg is well brushed over them, and finely-grated bread, or biscuit, is sprinkled over them. The fat should be quite at boiling-point (when it will no longer hiss or bubble) before the fish is put in, and it should be well covered by the liquid butter, or oil, which, by-the-bye, is much the best for fry- ing fish in, but of course it is expensive. Hog's lard, and dripping are also used in economical kitchens. The frying-pan should never be left for a moment till the fish is done. In kitchens where strict economy is de- manded, it is usual when liver and bacon are to be dressed to fry the bacon first, which will leave enough fat in the pan for the liver to be put in without either butter or dripping, but this mode, though econo- mical, is very coarse, and we do not recom- mend it. The liver will be more delicate if it be fried before the bacon. To Glaze. Glazing is done by boiling down good rich beef stock till it is reduced to the con- sistence of a thin, bright brown paste. Of course all fat and sediment must first be removed from the stock before it is boiled down for glaze. It should be done over a quick fire, boiled fast till well reduced, then changed into a smaller stew-pan, and should11 Boning, Braising, and Larding. continue boiling till it is made. It must be kept in a jar well covered, and when re- quired for use should be put into a stew- pan and let stand in boiling water till the jelly is melted. It must be brushed over the tongue, chicken, or beef with a glazing brush once or twice till the operation is finished. Boning, larding, and Braising. The three most difficult operations to achieve well in cookery are boning, larding, and braising. Boning is so little understood by inferior cooks that it is best, if your servant is not first-rate, to have it done by the poulterer with whom you deal. Never- theless, it is an art which tends so much to economy, that it would quite repay the mistress of a family to pay for a few lessons for her domestic from a good poulterer or cook. The bones of poultry and hares are most useful for making gravies, and hares are more easily carved, and look better when boned. Any butcher will bone joints when required. Although we cannot hope that our readers will be able to achieve the boning of a fowl, &c., from any verbal description, we, nevertheless, give a few directions on the subject, from an excellent recipe of Miss Acton's for the performance of the operation. Turkeys, fowls, hares, &c., are boned, as well as joints. To Bone a Turkey or Fowl,—Miss Acton’s. “Cut through the skin down the centre of the back, and raise the flesh carefully on either side with the point of a sharp knife until the sockets of the wings and thighs are reached. Till a little practice has been gained, it will, perhaps, be better to bone these joints before proceeding further ; but after they are once detached from it the whole of the body may easily be separated from the flesh, and taken out entire. Only the neckbones and merrythought will then remain to be removed. The bird thus pre- pared may either be restored to its original form, by filling the legs and wings with forcemeat, and the body with the livers of two or three fowls, mixed with alternate layers of parboiled tongue, freed from the rind, fine sausage meat, or veal forcemeat, or thin slices of the nicest bacon, or aught else of good flavour which will give a marbled appearance to the fowl when it is carved, and then be sewn up and trussed as usual ; or the legs and wings may be drawn inside the body, and the bird being first flattened on a table may be covered with sausage meat and the various other in- gredients we have named, so placed that it shall be of equal thickness in every part, then tightly rolled, bound firmly together with a fillet of broad tape, wrapped in a thin pudding cloth closely tied at both ends, and dressed." Larding. The cook should be provided with larding needles of various sizes. Cut small smooth strips of the length required, off flic firmest part of a piece of bacon fat. Put these bits of bacon fat into a larding needle; they are called lardoons. Pierce the skin, and a very little of the flesh of the meat, fowl, sweet- bread, &c., you may wish to lard .with it, leaving the bacon in, and the two ends of equal length outwards. These punctures for lardoons are made in rows at any dis- tance from each other the cook pleases. The flavour of larding may be obtained by raising the skin of the meat and laying a slice of fat bacon beneath it ; this mode is not ornamental, but gives an excellent flavour to the flesh, even better than when larded with the needles. It requires a little practice to lard neatly, but as it is really an easy operation, any cook may learn to do it with care. Cut the bacon in slices, lay them one on the other, and cut strips through them the size you require, in order that they may be all of the same size. Lardoons (as these pieces of bacon are called) should be two inches in length and one-eighth of an inch in width, for larding poultry, game, and fricandeaux ; for fillets of beef and loin of veal they should be rather thicker. We owe, besides many another invaluable lesson, the following admirable description of larding to Soyer:—“Have the fricandeau trimmed ; lay it lengthwise upon a clean napkin across your hand, forming a kind of bridge with your thumb at the part you are about to commence at. Then with the point of the larding needle make three distinct lines across, half an inch apart ; run the needle into the third line at the further side of the fricandeau, and bring it out at the first, placing one of the lardoons in it ; draw the needle through; leaving out a quarter of an inch of the bacon at each line ; proceed thus to the end of the row. Then make another line half an inch dis- tant ; stick in another row of lardoons, bringing them out at the second line, leaving the ends of the bacon out all the same length. Make the next row again at the same distance, bringing the ends out be- tween the lardoons of the first row, proceed- ing in this manner until the whole surface is larded in chequered rows. Everything else is larded in a similar way, and in the23 Carving. case of poultry, hold the breast over a char- coal fire for one minute, or dip it into boiling water, in order to make the flesh firm.” Braising. Braising is a mode of cooking by the action of heat above, as well as below, the article cooked. A braising pan has a deep cover (see engraving at Kitchen Utensils) on which live charcoal is placed. The pan is air-tight, and as all evaporation is thus precluded, the food braised imbibes what- ever flavour the cook may wish to give it ; in order to effect which, she must place in the pan with it whatever vegetables, &c., her recipe may-direct. The ingredients should be very well proportioned, and the stewing should go on very slowly. We will give here one recipe for a braise, as an example of what is meant. A Fowl braised.—Peel and wash a large Portugal onion, and one large turnip ; cut them in thin slices, with a little celery, a few sprigs of parsley, and a bay leaf. Lay a few slices of fat bacon at the bottom of the pan, place the bird trussed for boiling on it, cover the breast with slices of fat bacon. Lay the vegetables round it, with a few bones or trimmings of fresh meat. Add a One of the most important acquisitions in the routine of daily life is the ability to carve, not only well, but elegantly. It is true that the present fashion of Russian dinners is fast banishing the necessity for promiscuous carving from the richly-served boards of the wealthy; but in the circles of middle life, where it is not adopted, the necessity of skill in the use of a carving-knife is sufficiently obvious. The dish upon which the article to be carved is placed should be conveniently near to the carver, so that he may have full con- trol over it; for if it is placed far off, nothing can prevent an ungracefulness of appearance, and a difficulty in performing Ribs of Beef.—There are two modes of carving this joint; the first, which is now becoming common, and is easy to an ama- teur carver, is to cut across the bone, com- mencing in the centre, and helping fat from A, as marked in the engraving of the sirloin, or it should be carved in slices from a to n, commencing either in the centre of the joint or at the sides. Occasionally the bones are removed, and the meat formed into a fillet; it should then be carved as a round of beef. An Aitch-Bone of Beef.—This is a simple joint to carve, but the slices from it must be cut quite evenly, and of a very pint and a half of stock, and seasoning to your taste. Cover the pot closely, set it over a slow stove, put live charcoal at the top, and let it cook slowly. When it is done, keep the meat hot while you strain the gravy and take off the fat, which you can do quicker by plunging the basin partly into cold water ; this will make the fat coagulate. Boil it up very quickly again till it thickens. Some cooks let the gravy adhere to the meat ; this is done by boiling it down till it is reduced just to the quantity required for the purpose. Saute-ing. To " Sautd ” anything means to dress it quickly, in a small pan, with a very little butter, oil, lard, or dripping, doing one side at a time. Two spoonfuls of oil will be enough to sautt a small chicken in. The art of saut^-ing well consists in doing it quickly, to keep the gravy and succulence in the meat. It is an economical mode of dressing small things of every kind of food. It is, you see, very different from frying, which is really boiling in hot fat, and requires a far greater quantity of the butter, oil, &c., for its performance. that which if it were in its proper place could be achieved with ease. In helping fish, nicety and care must be exercised ; lightness of hand and dexterity of management are necessary, and can only be acquired by practice. The flakes which, in fish like salmon and cod are large, should not be broken in helping, for the beauty of the fish is then destroyed, and it becomes less inviting to the appetite. In the following directions, accompanied by diagrams, we have endeavoured to be as explicit as possible ; but practice alone will enable any person to carve with skill and facility. Aitch-Bone.Carving. 24 Sirloin of Beef. Fillet of Veal. Neck of Veal. Breast of Veal. moderate thickness. When the joint is boiled, before cutting it, remove a slice from the whole of the upper part, of sufficient thickness (say a quarter of an inch), to arrive at the juicy part of the meat at once. Carve from a to b ; let the slices be moderately thin —not too thin—help fat with the lean in one piece, and give a little addi- tional fat which you will find below C ; the solid fat is at A, and must be cut in slices horizontally. The round of beef is carved in the same manner. The Sirloin of Beef.—The under part should be first carved, as indicated in the engraving, across the bone. In carving the upper part the same directions should be followed as for the ribs, carving either side, or in the centre, from A to B, and helping the fat from D. Fillet of Veal.—Cut a slice off the whole of the upper part, in the same way as from a round of beef, this being, if well roasted, of a nice brown, should be helped in small pieces with the slices you cut for each person. The stuffing is skewered in the flap, and where the bone comes out there is some placed ; help this with the meat, with a piece of the fat. Neck of Veal.—Were you to attempt to carve each chop, and serve it, you would not only place a gigantic piece upon the plate of the person you intended to help, but you would waste much time, and should the ver- tebras have not been jointed by the butcher, you would find yourself in the position of the ungraceful carver, being compelled to exercise a degree of strength which should never be suffered to appear ; very possibly, too, helping gravy in a manner not contemplated by the person unfortunately near enough to receive it. Cut diago- nally from B to A, and help in slices of moderate thickness ; you can cut from c to D in order to separate the small bones, divide and serve them, having first inquired if they are de- sired. The Breast of Veal.— Sepa- rate the ribs from the brisket, cutting from A to b ; these small bones are the sweetest and mostly chosen ; you will cut them as at n D D, and serve. The long ribs are divided as at c C C ; and having ascertained the prefe- rence of the person, help accordingly; at good tables the scrag is not served, but is found, when properly cooked, a very good stew. Loin of Veal.—This joint is sent to table served as a sirloin of beef. Having turned it over, out out the kidney and the fat, return it to its proper position, and carve it, as in the neck of veal, from B to A , help with it a slice of kidney and fat. The kidney is usually placed upon a dry toast when removed from the joint.Carving. 25 Shoulder of Veal is sent to table with I as a shoulder of mutton, beginning at the the underpart placed uppermost. Help it | knuckle end. Calf's Head.—There is much more meat to be obtained from a calf's head by carving it one way than another. Carve from A to B, cutting quite down to the bone. At the fleshy part of the neck end you will find the throat sweetbread, which you can help a slice of with the other part; you will remove the eye with the point of the knife and divide it in half, helping those to it who profess a preference for it ; there are some nice gelatinous pieces around it, which are palatable. Remove the jawbone, and then you will meet with some fine flavoured lean ; the palate, which is under the head, is by some thought a dainty, and should be offered when carving. A Shoulder of Mutton.—This is a joint upon which a great diversity of opinion exists, many professing a species of horror at its insipidity ; others finding much deli- cacy of' flavour in certain parts. In good mutton there is no doubt that, if properly managed, it is an excellent joint, and if ju- diciously carved, will give satisfaction to all who partake of it. It should be served and eaten very hot. It is sent to table lying on the dish as shown in the annexed en- graving. Commence carving from A to b, taking out moderately thin slices in the shape of a wedge ; some nice pieces may then be helped from the bladebone, from c to b, cutting on both sides of the bone. Cut the fat from D, carving it in thin slices. Some of the most delicate parts, however, lie on the under part of the shoulder ; take off thin pieces horizontally from B to C, and from A ; some tender slices are to be met with at d, but they must be cut through as indicated. The shoulder of mutton is essentially a joint of titbits, and therefore, when carving it, the tastes of those at table should be con- sulted. It is a very insipid joint when cold, and should therefore be hashed if sent to table a second time. A Shoulder of Mutton. Leg of Mutton. — The under or thickest part of the leg should be placed uppermost, and carved in slices mode- rately thin, from b to c. Many persons prefer the knuckle, and this question should be asked, and, if liked, it should be sent to the guest. When cold, the back of the leg should be placed upper- most, and thus carved ; if the cramp bone is requested (some persons regard it as a dainty), insert your knife at D, passing it round to e, and you will remove it. Leg of Mutton.Carving. 26 Saddle of Mutton. Saddle of Mutton. — The tail end is divided in the engraving, and the kidneys skewered under each division ; this is a matter of taste, and is not always done. Carve from A to b in thin slices, help fat from c to d. You may help from the vertebrae on both sides of the loin, and then carve crosswise as marked in the en- graving, which gives you both fat and lean ; help a slice of kidney to those who desire it. The Loin of Mutton, ifsmall, should be carved in chops, be- ginning with the outer chop ; if large, carve slices the whole length. chine bone are removed, is carved in the direction of the bones. The Scrag of Mutton should be separated from the ribs of the neck, and when roasted the bones sent with the meat. Haunch of Mutton is carved haunch of venison. as A neat way is to run the knife along the chine bone and under the meat along the ribs ; it may then be cut in slices as shown in the engraving of the saddle of mutton ; by this process fat and lean are served together ; your knife should be very sharp, and it should be done cleverly Neck of Mutton, if the scrag and OI venison. Fore Quarter of Lamb.—Place your fork near the knuckle, and cut from a to c, to b, and on to d ; pass your knife under, lifting with the fork at the same time. The juice of half a lemon or Seville orange which has been sprin- kled with salt and pepper, is then squeezed under the shoul- der, and a slice of fresh butter placed there also, the parts are reunited until the butter is r- . . T melted, and the shoulder is oie Quaiter of Lamb. then placed upon a separate the rihe frem r, *„ _ , , , , , dish; separate the neck from palate of your guest. ’ ^ 16,1 ldp the breaSt’ G' or the neck> F- according to the Haunch of Venison.-Have the dish placed before you so that the loin is nearest to you, and the knuckle farthest; then cut from a to B, sufficiently near the knuckle to prevent the escape of any gravy ; then make your first cut from a to C, with a slanting cut, and then let each succeeding slice be sloping, so that all the gravy may be retained in the hollow thus formed ; the fat will be found at the left side, and must be served with the meat. ciently roasted, this maybe done with ease ; the meat should be cut in thin slices across the leg, the crackling being served with it, or not, according to taste ; the loins are cut into the pieces scored by the butcher. Ham is served as placed in the engraving, and should come to table ornamented. Carve from A to B, cutting thin slices slant- ingly, to give a wedge-like appearance. Those Haunch of Venison. Kid, if kept until the age at which lambs are killed, is served and carved in the same manner ; if killed at a month or five weeks, it is roasted whole, and carved in the kitchen. Pork.—The leg when s^nt to table should be placed with the back uppermost, and the crackling be removed ; if suffi-27 Carving. who prefer the hock carve at D, in the same direction as from A to B, then carve from D to C, in thin slices, as indicated in the diagram. Boiled Tongue. — Carve across the tongue, but do not cut through ; keep the slices rather thin, and help the fat and kernels from underneath. Sucking Pig.—The cook should send a roast pig to table as displayed here, gar- nished with head and ears; carve the joints in the direction shown by the lines in the diagram, then divide the ribs, serve with plenty of sauce ; should one of the joints be too much, it may be separated: bread sauce and stuffing should accompany it. An ear and the jaw are favourite parts with many people. Hare.—Cut slices from b to A of moderate thickness. When the hare is young, you can, after removing the shoulders and legs, cut across the back and divide it into several pieces ; this is not practicable with a full grown hare, unless it is boned ; the shoulders and legs are easily removed by placing the knife between them, and turning them back, the joint will disclose itself and can then be separated. The head should not be removed until the last, divide it from the neck, remove the lower jaw, then cut through the divi- sion which appears from the nose to the top of the skull, and lay it open. The stuffing should be given with whatever portion may be helped. Roast Rabbits are carved in the same manner. Boiled Rabbit.—Remove the legs and shoulders, they very easily separate, divide the back into two parts, and by holding the fork firmly in the back, and passing the knife underneath, near the middle, and bending it back, this is accomplished readily. The most tender part is on the loins, the meat there is of a very delicate flavour ; liver should be helped with it. Poultry.—Poultry requires skilful carv- ing ; the requisites are grace of manner, ease in the performance, a perfect knowledge of the posi- tion of the joints, and the most complete mode of dissect- ing, so as to obtain the largest quantity of meat. In no case is this ability more demanded than in carving a roast turkey. Unless this is done well, there is not only much waste, but the appearance of the turkey is spoiled. You will commence by carving slices from each side of the breast, in the same directions as the lines marked in the engraving, cutting from a to B. Then remove the legs, dividing the thighs from the drumsticks, and here an instrument termed a disjointer will be found serviceable, for unless the turkey be very young, and the union of the joints very accurately taken, carving becomes difficult: Ham. Roast Pig. Hare. Boiled Rabbit. Roast Turkey. the disjointer effects the separation at once, and it possesses also the advantage of ena- bling the carver to divide a thigh into two,Carving. 28 thus permitting a less bulky portion to be served. The pinions and that portion of the body removed with it, are always a delicacy, and care should be taken to carve them nicely : the joint of the pinion will be found at b. The stuffing, if it be of truffles, you will obtain by making an opening at c. Ordinary forcemeat is found in helping the breast. Boiled Turkey. Boiled Turkey is trussed in a different fashion to the roast, but the same direction given for the first ap- plies to the second. The legs in the boiled turkey being drawn into the body may cause some little diffi- culty at first in their separation, but a little practice will soon surmount it. Roast Fowl.—This operation is a nice and skilful one to perform ; it requires both observation and prac- tice. Insert the knife between the legs and the side, press back the leg with the blade of the knife, and the joint will come apart; if judiciously managed, it will re- quire but a nick where the joints unite. Remove the wing from d to B, cut through and lay it back as with the leg, separating the joint with the edge of the knife, remove the merrythought and neck bones next; this you will accomplish by inserting the knife and forcing it under the bones ; raise it and it will readily separate from the breast. You will divide the breast from the body by cutting through the small ribs down to the vent, turn the back uppermost, now put the knife into about the centre between the neck and rump, raise the lower part firmly yet gently, it will easily separate, turn the neck or rump from you, take off the side bones, and the fowl is carved. Roast Fowl. In separating the thigh from the drum- stick, you must insert the knife exactly at the joint, as we have indicated ” the en- experienced in parts asunder. There is no difference in carving roast and boiled fowls, if full grown ; but in a very young fowl when roasted, the breast is served whole. The wings and breast are preferred, but the leg of a young fowl is an excellent part. Capons when very fine and roasted, should have slices carved from the breast, like a turkey. Geese.—Follow with your knife the lines marked in the engra- ving, A to B, and cut slices, then remove the wing, and if the party be large, the legs must also be removed, and here the dis- join ler will again prove serviceable. The stuffing will be obtained by making an insertion at the apron, c. graving ; this, however, will be found to require practice, for the joint must be ac- curately hit, or else much difficulty will be getting the Roast Goose. Pheasant.29 Carving Pheasant.—Clear the leg by inserting the edge of the knife between it and the body, then take off the wings, B to A, but do not remove much of the breast with them, you are thus enabled to obtain some nice slices ; the pheasant is then carved as a fowl. The breast is first in estimation, then the wings, and after these the merrythought; lovers of game prefer a leg. Partridge.—Separate the legs, and then divide the bird into three parts, leaving each leg and wing together. The breast is then divided from the back, and helped whole, the latter being helped with any of the other parts. When the party consists of gentlemen only, the bird is divided in halves by cuttingdengthwise right through from the centre. Quails, Landrail,Wheatears, Larks, and all small birds are served whole. Wild Ducks and Widgeon.—The breast of these fowls being the best portion, is carved in slices, which are removed, and a glass of old port wine is poured in ; the half of a lemon seasoned with Cayenne and salt should then be squeezed in, the slices relaid in their places, and then served, the joints being removed the same as in other fowls. Pigeon. — Like woodcock, these birds are cut in halves, through the breast and back, and the half is sent to the person helped. Pigeon (breast). Partridge. Pigeon (back). FISH. Fish should never be touched with a steel knife, and fork, are used for carving it. It requires more care than knowledge to help fish—the prin- cipal thing is to avoid breaking the flakes. In carving a piece of salmon as here engraved, cut thin slices, as from A to B, and help with it pieces of the belly in the direction marked from c to d ; the best flavoured is the upper or thick part. Fish slices, or a silver fish knife Middle Cut of Salmon. Turbot.—Cut flat pieces as marked in the engraving without moving the bone; the fin, which is esteemed a delicacy, is always served with it. All flat-fish, such as plaice, brill, Johndory, &c., are carved in the same manner ; soles are cut either into halves, or, if very large, are divided into three, cutting them across right through. Flounders are served whole. Turbot. Cod's Head and Shoulders.—Carry the knife from a to b, and then along the line to C, help slices accompanied by some of the sound, which is to be found lining the back, and which you may obtain by passing the knife under the backbone at c ; serve also a piece of liver* Cod's Head.3° The Breakfast Table. A Dish of Mackerel. Pike are served in many ways. When baked, the back and belly should” be slit up, and each slice gently drawn downwards ; by this means fewer bones will be given. Remember that constant practice is re- Mackerel should always be sent to table head to tail. Divide the meat from the bone by cutting down the back lengthwise ; the upper part is the best. All small fish, such as pilchards, herrings, smelts, &c., are served whole. Whitings when fried have the tail curled as in the en- Fried Whiting, graving. They are sent whole. ' quired to make a good carver. With it and a little care and observation, it will become easy and even pleasant to you to carve ; and will greatly add to the comfort and nicety of the home dinner-table. THE BREAKFAST-TABLE. A lady's taste and nicety are very per- ceptible at the breakfast-table. She should never allow a soiled table-cloth to appear on it. The linen should be fresh and snowy white, the silver brightly cleaned, the tea, coffee, or cocoa nicely made, and, if pos- sible, fresh flowers and fruit should adorn the table. A nicely-laid, pretty, appetizing breakfast is a great promoter of good temper and harmony through the ensuing day. A soiled table-cloth, tough cold toast, weak tea, bitter coffee, See., are enough to derange both the temper and digestion of those who have to submit to such domestic inflictions. Let our homes ever be bright, sunnv, and charming ; and that such may be the case open the day with a cheery and well-arranged breakfast-table. At the head of the table place the break- fast cups and saucers, the tea cups at the left hand side, the coffee cups at the right hand side. The teapot and coffee-pot stand in front of the urn. The slop-basin and milk-jug should be placed on the left. The cream and hot milk to the right. Put hot plates by the broiled bacon, chops, &c., and a smaller plate, knife, and fork to each person. Bread should be put on a wooden patter. Salt-cellars occupy the four comers. Hot rolls should bebrought in covered with a table-napkin. Dry toast should never stand longer than five minutes before serving. Buttered toast becomes soppy and greasy if too long kept before it is served. Large joints, as cold ham, cold beef, &c., should be put on the sideboard or a side table. , . , And now to proceed to the especial pro- vince of our book—i.e., the proper prepa- ration of our breakfast food. We will begin with the tea and coffee. Tea contains in its leaves as soluble substances—caseine, an essential oil to which it owes its taste and odour ; a small amount of tannin ; more or less colouring matter according to the species of the plant, and a little gluten. Now lo ex- tract the due proportions of these substances quite boiling water is needed, and the tea should not stand too long. Never-boil the tea leaves ; the excessive heat would cause the essential oil, which is the flavouring matter, to fly off, and the boiling would ex- tract too much of the tannin, which is dis- agreeable and astringent. Long standing also extracts too much of the tannin, and gives a dead, senna-like taste to the tea. To Roast Coffee. x. Have either a Patent Roaster, or the Irish mop roaster. To every three pounds of coffee you put in the roaster add a piece of good fresh butter, a little larger than a marble, and two teaspoonfuls of powdered sugar; then roast the berries. This little addition develops the aroma of the berry. Many people prefer having chicory added to their” coffee—the proportion is about a quarter of a pound of chicory to a pound of coffee. Excellent Coffee for three Breakfast Cups. z. Four tablespoonfuls of roasted coffee berries ; three teacupfuls of boiling water. Take four tablespoonfuls of roasted coffee berries and put them in the oven till well warmed through ; then grind them Put the coffee in the pot, which should have aToast. 31 piece of tin over the middle strainer to pre- vent the coffee from filling up the holes ; pour in three teacupfuls of boiling water. The breakfast-cup should be filled up with boiling milk. Chocolate. Time, ten or twelve minutes. 3. Four ounces of the cake ; two gills of water ; one pint of milk. Scrape up about a quarter of a pound of the chocolate cake into a saucepan with two gills of water ; set it on the fire ; stir it con- stantly with a wooden spoon until it is rather thick, then work it very quickly with the spoon. Stir in a pint of boiling milk by degrees, and serve it. Cocoa Nibs. (Dr. Todd.) Time, five hours. 4. A quarter of a pound of cocoa nibs ; three quarts of water. A quarter of a pound of cocoa nibs to three quarts of water, to be boiled down to two quarts and a half. The nibs to be strained after five hours’ boiling. If they are allowed to remain in the cocoa, it be- comes bitter and unpalatable. Oatmeal Porridge. Time, half an hour. 5. Two ounces of oatmeal ; one pint of water ; half a pint of cold milk. Put a pint of warm water into a stew- pan over the fire, and as it boils dredge in the oatmeal with your left hand, and stir with the right. When it is made, turn it into a soup-plate, adding a little salt or a little sugar, according to taste. Send it to table with a jug of hot milk, which should be added to it by degrees for eating. Toast. This simple addition to the breakfast- table is seldom supplied in perfection. If the cook were aware of the principle and aim of toasting, it is quite possible that we should be spared the daily infliction of tough toast, burnt toast, greasy toast, &c. Now the aim of toasting bread is to get out of it the remainder of water contained in it, which renders it less digestible than well-made toast. But if, as is generally done, the slice of bread be hurriedly exposed to a hot fire, and the exterior of the bread be toasted nearly black, this intention is defeated, as the heat will then produce no effect on the interior of the slice, which remains as moist as ever. Charcoal is a bad conductor of heat; the over-toasted surface is nothing more or less than a thin layer of charcoal, which prevents the heat from penetrating through the bread. Neither will butter pass through the hard surface ; it will re- main on it, and if exposed to heat to melt it in, it will dissolve and run over it in the form of rancid oil. This is why buttered toast is so often unwholesome. Now if you would have an eatable slice of toast do not allow one spot of the exterior to be burned or charred. Chest- nut-brown is too dark for good toast—a pale golden colour is all that is required. The method to toast bread perfectly is this :— Warm the slice for one minute on each side by the fire without attempting to toast it. Theji turn the first warmed side to the fire, and, holding it at a little distance, move it gently about till it is all over of a pale golden brown. By this means the whole of the water may be drawn out of it, and it will be changed from dough, which has always a tendency to acetous fermenta- tion in the stomach, to the pure farina of wheat, which is far easier of digestion, especially for invalids. As it is turned to pure farina, the dough and gluey nature will be gone, every part will be equally warm, and no part so hotly dry as to turn the butter to oil on the surface. The dried farina will allow the butter to penetrate every part of it. There is greater advantage in this than may at first sight appear. Butter, in masses, however good, is too heavy for the stomach ; but butter divided with sufficient minuteness, and not suffered to oil, makes a valuable addition to our nourishment. The properly toasted bread absorbs the butter, and both butter and farina are in a state of very minute divi- siori, the one serving to expose the other to the free action of the gastric fluid in the stomach, and “that this fluid shall pene- trate the whole mass of the food, and act upon it in small portions, is the grand secret of healthful digestion." When a slice of toast is well made, it is impossible to find anything lighter of diges- tion. Take care that the fire for toasting be clear and hot, and the bars clean from blacks. As bad toast is generally made from the cook not having sufficient time to bestow on the making, we advise all persons who can afford it to buy the Toaster and Trivet, shown in our Kitchen Utensils, by which four rounds of toast may be done at the same time, while other duties occupy the attention of the servant.Toast—Bread. 3 2 Do not cut thick slices of bread for toast; they should be thin, and cut off a stale loaf. Cut off the crust edging. Do not keep the toast for breakfast; serve it as soon as possible after it is done, or it will become tough. Never let it lie flat. Place it at once in the toast-rack, or lean two slices against each other on a plate, like the gable of a house. If a slice lies, the steam from it will prevent it from being crisp ; cut off the crusts quickly on this ac- count. Bread too stale to be eaten buttered will make good toast; if very dry, it may be dipped into warm water before toasting it. Buttered Toast. 6. Cut thin slices the whole way round a stale loaf (it should be at least a day old), warm both sides before the fire, and toast it carefully ; have a hot plate ready to place it on when done. Put some butter cut into dice on it, first warm it before the fire and spread the butter lightly over it ; if well made, it will easily penetrate the bread. Some persons like to have a little butter put on each side of the toast. Toast a second round and lay it on the first; cut off the crusts and divide it into four quarters ; serve very hot. To Toast Muffins. 7. Pull open the sides of the muffin exactly in the centre, about half an inch in ; put the toasting-fork in it and toast it carefully. When it is done, and it should only be lightly toasted, pull it apart, lay a little butter inside, and close the muffin. Put it on a hot plate and cut it in four. If more than one is required, lay them on the first done, but do not send in a great pile of muffins, as they are better served hot. A hot-water plate with a cover,—a regular muffin plate,—should be used, and two at the most only be sent in at a time. Crumpets. 8. Do not open crumpets ; toast them carefully and very quickly ; butter them on both sides, and serve them separately on a hot-water plate, if you have one ; if not, send them in hot and hot, as they are not nice lukewarm. Never put one crumpet on the top of the other, as the under one would become heavy. Bread. Everybody is, I believe, of opinion that home-made bread is cheaper, sweeter, and more wholesome than that bought at the baker's, unless it is badly made. Heavy, close, bitter bread is only too well known in jnany households where it is home-made ; this is not economical, as it cannot nourish the eaters as good bread does, and it is, generally speaking, wasted. Let us see if it is not possible to teach how to make bread of all kinds, which shall be good, light, sweet, and appetizing. The oven plays an important part in this manufac- ture. A brick oven heated with wood is the right one for economy. It is possible to bake bread in the iron oven attached to a range, but the author, from personal expe- rience, can assure her readers that home- made bread thus baked is more expensive than bakers', on account of the quantity of fuel it takes to heat the oven for bread- baking, and the necessity of making it up in small loaves, which are not economical. The brick oven is heated by faggot wood ; after it is cleared out, the door should be shut very closely for half an hour before you put in your loaves. The oven will then be thoroughly heated, and the heat will last for some time. A brick oven for baking bread should be as hot as you can bear to hold your hand in (without touching the bricks of course) whilst counting twenty; this is an estab- lished rule in most farmhouses. Bread is longer baking in an iron oven than in a brick one. Next to the oven in importance comes the yeast. We have used, and like, both German and patent yeast ; but as many persons prefer their own, and it is always well for the house to be independent of external helps in this matter, we give a receipt for making yeast, for the goodness of which we can answer. Flour should be purchased of a miller ; it will be less likely to be adulterated than if it passed through a second hand. The best flour is generally used in gentlemen's kitchens; nevertheless, we know several county families (and one nobleman s family) famous for excellent household bread, in which the " best seconds " are always used. There is no doubt that more nutrition is contained in brown bread than in white, and that the whiter the bread the less is the nourishment derived from it. Brown bread is excellent for weak digestions, and for many other reasons should be eaten alter- nately with white bread in all families; moreover, it is less adulterated than the very white bread when purchased from the baker s. The flour of ‘1 hard wheat, ” as it is called, is the most nutritious ; it is not so white as that procured from soft wheat, but has more gluten in it. , Flour when kept in store should be placed in a warm dry room, as, if at all damp, it33 Receipt for Yeast—To Make Bread. Much kneading makes bread whiter and finer; bread can, indeed, scarcely be kneaded too much. will make the bread or cakes for which it is used heavy. It is safest to put the quantity of flour you are about to make into bread before the fire in a large dish or pan for an hour or two, in order to have it warm and dry for use. Great cleanliness is required for making bread—a clean trough or brown earthenware pan ; very clean hands and arms, and nice fresh yeast. The fresher the yeast the less you will require of it. Never leave the dough half made, nor allow it to get cold before it is finished ; if you do, it will be heavy. Too small a pro- portion of yeast will make the dough heavy. If the sponge or the dough be permitted to overwork itself it will become sour in warm weather. Do not put it too near the fire, but keep it warm at a gentle and equal degree of heat. Bread baked in tins will be lighter than when made into ordinary loaves, and is best for toast or sandwiches. Too little water will spoil the bread ; too much will make it too slack. If by acci- dent the latter fault is perceptible, make the bread up in tins, and it will not much matter. The proportions given in the receipts contained in this book may of course be modified according to the quantity of bread required. The Ingleby Keceipt for Yeast. Time, twenty minutes to boil; twelve hours to ferment. 9. Two ounces of hops ; four quarts of water; two and a half or three pounds of flour ; six or seven boiled potatoes ; one pint of ale yeast. Boil the hops in four quarts of water for twenty minutes ; strain the water tl rough a hair sieve upon two and a half or three pounds of flour—it will seem lumpy, but that is of no consequence; stir it occasionally, and bruise it with a wooden spoon ; let it stand till cool, and then keep it in the air of the fire all night. The next day fill a glass bottle with it; then add six or seven boiled potatoes, bruised, and a pint of ale yeast to it ; stir it well up, and let it stand till next day ; then bottle it for use, remem- bering to take a pint out before you put the potatoes and the harming in. To Knead Bread. 10. After the dough is mixed flour the hands, and, folding the fingers over the thumb, make what is called a fist, and beat and pummel the dough first with one hand and then the other on every side ; work it fhus till it ceases to stick to your hands. To Make Bread. Time, one hour to bake loaves of two pounds weight each. 11. Seven pounds of flour ; two quarts of warm water ; a large tablespoonful of salt; half a gill of yeast. Put the flour into a deep pan, heap it round the sides, leaving a hollow in the centre ; put into it a quart of warm water, a large spoonful of salt, and half a gill of yeast ; have ready three pints more of warm water, and with as much of it as may be necessary make the whole into a rather soft dough, kneading it well with both hands. When it is smooth and shining, strew a little flour on it; lay a thickly folded cloth over it, and set it in a warm place by the fire for four or five hours ; then knead it again for a quarter of an hour ; cover it over, and set it to rise again ; divide it into two or four loaves, and bake in a quick oven. It will take one hour to bake it if divided into loaves weighing two pounds each, and two hours if the loaves weigh four pounds each. This bread need only rise once, and if made of the best superfine flour will be beautifully white and light. In cold weather bread should be mixed in a warm room, and not allowed to become cold while rising. If there is any difficulty as to its rising, set the bowl or pan over boiling w'ater. It is best to mix the bread at night, and cover it close, in a warm room should the weather be cold, till the morning. Of course, if the family be large, the quantities may be increased or doubled in proportion. Another Mode, with Milk. Time, one and a half to two hours. 12. One quartern of flour ; two teaspoon- fuls of salt ; four tablespoonfuls of yeast ; one pint and a half of milk. Put a quartern of flour into a large basin with two teaspoonfuls of salt ; make a hole in the middle, and then put in a basin four tablespoonfuls of yeast; stir in it a pint of milk lukewarm ; put it in the hole of the flour ; stir it to make it just a thin batter, then strew a little flour over the top ; set it on one side of the fire, and cover it over. Let it stand till next morning, then make it into dough ; add half a pint more of warm milk, knead it for ten minutes, and set it in a warm place for one hour and a half; then knead it again, and it is ready either fop loaves or bricks. Bake them from one hour V‘ P34 How to Make Bread and Rolls. and a Tialf to two hours, according to the size. German Yeast Bread. Time, one and a half to two hours. 13. Two quarterns of flour ; one table- spoonful of salt ; two ounces of dried Ger- man yeast; a cupful of water ; a pint and a half of warm water. Dissolve the yeast in a small cupful of cold water, and then add it to a pint and a half of warm water. Put the flour well mixed with the salt into a deep bread pan ; make a hole in the middle of the flour, and pour in the water and yeast; knead it up quickly, and let it stand near the fire covered over with a thick cloth for one hour ; then divide it into loaves, and bake them accord- ing to their size. You may make up a much larger quantity of flour, and bake the loaves two or three at a time, if care is taken not to keep the dough too warm. How to put Potatoes in Bread. Time, three hours. 14. Two pounds of potatoes ; half a pint of yeast; one ounce of sugar to one bushel of flour. Take two pounds of potatoes, boil them well, mash them, and, if dry, add a little water ; when so cold as not to scald the hand put in half a pint of yeast and one ounce of sugar. In three hours the mixture will be ready, and will suffice for a bushel of flour. Bread with Potatoes. 13. Half a gallon of potatoes ; five gallons of flour; some yeast ; and a little warm water. The evening previous to baking in the morning the dough must be set as follows The half gallon of potatoes must be rubbed through a sieve to five gallons of flour, the same quantity of yeast added as you would for common bread, and a little warm water. Cover it up to rise, knead it, and proceed as usual. To Make Brown Bread. Time, one or two hours, according to weight. 16. Three parts of second flour ; the fourth part of rye ; a little milk ; and the right pro- portion of water. Take three parts of second flour, and the fourth of rye, lay it one night in a cool place, and the next morning work it up with a little milk added to the water. Set it at a proper distance from the fire to rise, and then make into loaves and bake. Eice Bread. Time, to bake, one and a half to two hours. 17. One and a half pound of whole Caro- lina or Patna rice ; fourteen pounds of flour ; half a pint of yeast ; three ounces of salt; three quarts of water. Put the whole rice into a large stew-pan with three quarts of water ; boil it slowly for quite five hours, and then beat it to a smooth paste. Mix it while warm with the flour, adding the salt and_ the yeast, and proceed in the same manner as in making other bread, setting it to rise by the fire, &c. Tea Cakes or Loaves. Time, half or three-quarters of an hour. 18. One egg ; two ounces of butter ; half a pound of flour; two or three knobs of sugar. Rub the butter into the flour, add the sugar, pounded, and mix it with one beaten egg- It will make two small loaves for tea or breakfast. Breakfast or Tea Rolls. Time, fifteen to twenty minutes. 19. One pound of flour ; a quarter of a pound of butter ; one tablespoonful of good yeast; one egg ; a little warm milk. Rub the butter into the flour, then add the yeast, breaking in one egg, both yolk and white. Mix it with a little warm milk poured into the middle of the flour ; stir all well together, and set it by the fire to rise, then make it into light dough, and again set it by the fire. Make up the rolls, lay them on a tin, and set them in front of the fire for ten minutes before you put them into the oven, brushing them over with egg. This paste may be used for fancy bread. Breakfast or Tea Cakes Hot. Time, half an hour. 20. Six handfuls of flour ; half a pint of milk ; a small piece of butter ; two ounces of German yeast; one egg. Put the flour in a basin, with half a pint of milk, and a small piece of butter ; warm the milk ; in the winter increase its tempera- ture. Mix two ounces of German yeast in a little cold water ; add it to the milk and batter; make a hole in the flour, and pour the mixed milk and yeast into it, stirring it round until it is a thick batter; add to it one beaten egg ; cover it over, and set it before the fire, keeping it warm. When it has risen a little, mix it into a dough, knead it well, put it again in the warm, and when it has risen a great deal form your rolls. They • will take nearly half an hour to bake, or35 Eggs for Breakfast. according to the size yon make them. Rub them once while hot with a paste brush dipped in milk. Fadge. Time, one hour. 21. Four ounces of brown meal (half rye, half brown flour); two ounces of butter ; a saltspoonful of salt; a quarter of a pint of milk. Take four ounces of brown meal, mixed of half rye, half brown flour, two ounces of butter, and a little salt; make it into a stiff paste with milk, and bake it for one hour on a gridle over the fire, turning it often. It will not do to bake it in the oven. If baked too long it gets like pie-crust. Sir Tatton Sykes’ Water Cakes. Time, fifteen minutes. 22. One pound of flour ; a piece of butter the size of a nut; a quarter of a pint of cold water ; one pinch of salt. To Boil Eggs for Breakfast. Time, three minutes, or very soft, two minutes and a half. 23. Fill a pint saucepan with water, set it over the fire and let it boil. Then, as it boils, put in with a spoon two or three fresh eggs. Take care not to crack the shells, or to boil them too fast. Serve them in egg- cups on a stand. N.B.—Do not use a fresh egg till it has been laid ten hours. The albumen, or white, wiil not be set before that time has elapsed. Poached Eggs. Time, two minutes. 24. One pint of water ; one tablespoonful of vinegar; one saltspoonful of salt ; as many eggs as required. Put the vinegar and salt into the water, let it boil, then break the eggs carefully into it, let them boil gently three minutes. Take them out with a slice, let them drain, and put them on a slice or round of thin but- tered toast. If the yolk separates from the white, the egg is not fresh. The egg may also be done in a regular egg-poacher. Eggs and Bacon. Time, three to four minutes. 25. Six eggs; a quarter of a pound of dripping or butter ; some slices of ham or bacon. Break five or six fresh eggs into cups, and slip them into a delicately clean frying-pan of boiling dripping or butter. When the whites are set, take them up with a slice, trim off the rough edges, and drain them from the grease. Then place them in the centre of the dish, and the slices of fried bacon round the edge, or the eggs may be served on the bacon, whichever you prefer. Eggs a la Bonne Femme. Time, ten minutes. 26. Three eggs; two or three slices of beetroot; a slice or two of cold chicken, or any cold meat; three heads of coss lettuce. Boil three fresh eggs for ten minutes, roll them to break their shells on the table; shell them, cut them in halves, and just cut off the point of the white so that they may stand well. Take out the yolks and fill the white cups thus : two with beetroot (already boiled) cut into tiny dice ; two with cold chicken or meat cut into dice ; two with tiny dice of the yolks, piled up in them. Cut up some coss lettuce very nicely ; lay it on the dish, and place the eggs on it. Brawn. Oxford brawn is considered the best to purchase. The following recipe will be found excellent for family use. Brawn. Time, three nights; six hours to boil, three hours to get cold. 27. Pickled porker's head ; two tongues ; two feet, and two extra ears; four dried sausages; some slices of boiled ox tongue ; dried sage, pepper and salt, one teaspoonful of each for seasoning ; three tablespoonfuls of salt to cover the head. Cut the porker's head in half, and soak one night; cover it with salt for one night, boil slowly six hours. Let it get cold. Take out the bones. Boil the two tongues, feet, and ears one hour and a half; remove the bones and gristle. Cut all the meat into small pieces ; season with sage, peppier, and salt, well mixed. Cut the sausages into slices. Place slices of ox tongue, which should be of a nice red colour, in a pattern round the mould or tin ; put in the meat, and press it firmly down with a weight on the top. Let it stand one night. The tongues may be put in whole, if preferred, about the middle of the mould. Birds’ Nests. Time, fifteen minutes, ten minutes to boil the eggs. 28. Four eggs ; half a pint of rich brown gravy ; a quarter of a pound of forcemeat —for which you will require about one ounce of beef suet, chopped very fine; one ounce of bread-crumbs ; half an ounce of chopped parsley; powdered thyme and marjoram ; a little grated rind of a lemon and half its juice.; one egg to bind it.3*5 Breakfast Dishes. Make your forcemeat by chopping up the beef suet very fine ; grating the bread, chopping the parsley, and mixing the Whole ; grate in a little lemon peel, season it with pepper and salt. (Soyer was wont to say that seasoning could not be suffi- ciently accurate unless it was sprinkled in by the cook's fingers.) Beat the yolk of an egg and bind the forcemeat with it. While making it, let four eggs boil for ten minutes. Warm half a pint of rich brown gravy. When the eggs are boiled hard take them from their shells, and brush them over thickly with the forcemeat. Put a little butter in a stewpan ; fry them a light brown, dish them up, cut them in halves (first cut off also the top of the white that they may stand), and serve them hot with rich brown gravy poured over them. Huitres au Lit. Time, ten minutes. 29. Eight oysters ; four thin slices of fat bacon ; a round of toasted bread. Take two oysters from their shells and roll them in a thin broad slice of fat bacon ; fasten them with a small silver skewer (or steel one), and toast the tiny roll before the fire in a Dutch oven. Make four of these rolls, roast them at the same time, and serve them hot on a round of nicely toasted bread. Buttered Eggs, or Egg Toast. 30. Four eggs ; three ounces of butter; pepper and salt. Beat four eggs, yolks and whites toge- ther ; put three ounces of butter into a basin, and stand it in boiling water, stirring it until it is melted ; then pour the butter and the eggs into a saucepan ; keep a basin in your hand, just hold the saucepan in the other over a slow part of the fire, shaking it one way ; as it begins to warm, pour it into the basin, and back again ; then hold it again over the fire, stirring it constantly in a saucepan, and pouring it into the basin, to mix the egg and butter more perfectly until they shall be hot without boiling. They may then be sent to table on a flat dish with some slices of hard boiled eggs on the top, or spread very thickly on buttered toast. In either way they must be served up very hot. Omelet. Time, eleven minutes. 31. Four eggs ; two dessertspoonfuls of milk ; two ounces of butter; a sprig of parsley, and a few chives. Beat four whole eggs with two dessert- spoonfuls of milk, a sprig of parsley, and chives, and a seasoning of pepper and salt. Put the butter into au omelet-pan, and set it over the fire for five or six minutes, beat- ing the herbs and eggs all the time ; then pour them into the pan, and let them stand for a few minutes over the fire, but taking care to separate the omelet gently from the bottom of the pan, and shaking it to prevent its burning ; fry it for about five minutes on one side, and serve it doubled over. Bacon Broiled. Time, five minutes. 32. A few slices as required by the number of the family. Cut the slices very thin ; take off the rind ; put them to broil on a goidiron over a very clear fire ; turn them three or four times. Five minutes will suffice to dress them well. Some persons prefer the bacon thin enough to roll; but this is better perhaps for garnishing dishes than for breakfast. Ham is broiled in the same time. Pigs’ Kidneys. Time, fifteen minutes. 33. Pigs’ kidneys are prepared exactly as sheep's kidneys are ; they are nearly divided, fastened flat open with a tiny skewer, and broiled over a clear fire. They are served quite plain, or with maitre d'hotel sauce, if preferred. Pigs’ Feet and Ears. Time, to boil, four hours ; to fry, twelve minutes. 34. One teacupful of vinegar ; a salt- spoonful of salt; three ounces of butter ; one spoonful of made mustard ; one spoon- ful of vinegar. Clean the feet and ears carefully, and soak them for some hours ; and boil them tender. Then take them up. Boil some vinegar and a little salt in water, and when they are cold pour it over them. When they are to be dressed, dry them, split the feet in two, lengthwise, and slice the ears. Fry them, and serve them with butter, mustard, and vinegar ; or they may be fried in butter simply, and served. Pigs' feet may be simply boiled after being pickled. Pigs’ Ears. Time, to stew, half an hour. 35. Two ears ; one anchovy ; one tea- spoonful of sage and parsley ; a quarter of a pound of suet, chopped fine ; five ounces of bread-emmbs ; a little salt ; pepper to taste ; two eggs ; two ounces of butter ; half a pint of rich gravy; one glass ofAnchovy and Shrimp Toast, 37 sherry; three teaspoonfuls of made mustard; a piece of butter the size of a walnut; a teaspoonful of flour ; one small onion ; a pinch of Cayenne. Parboil the ears. Make a forcemeat of an anchovy, sage, parsley, a quarter of a pound of finely chopped suet, bread-crumbs, pepper, and salt. Mix.and bind it with the beaten yolks of two eggs. Raise the skin of the upper side of the ears, and stuff them with it. Fry the ears in fresh butter to a nice brown. Pour away the fat, and drain them. Make the following gravy : add to half a pint of rich stock, or gravy, a glass of sherry, three tablespoon fuls of mademustard, a piece of butter the size of a walnut, rolled in flour, one small onion whole, and half a saltspoonful of white pepper. Put this gravy with the ears into a stewpan, and cover it closely; stew it gently for half an hour, shaking it often. Then take out the onion, place the ears carefully in a dish, and pour the sauce over them. If you require more than two ears, the same quantity of sauce will do for four. Pigs’ Feet Soused. Time, one hour and a half. 36. Two feet; one teaspoonful of salt; three quarters of a pint of vinegar; a quarter of a pint of the water in which they are boiled ; six pepper corns ; a little .all- spice ; four cloves ; a little mace. Scald the feet and scrape them clean ; if the covering of the toes will not come off without, singe them in hot embers, until they are loose ; then take them off. Some persons put the feet in weak lime-water to whiten them. Having scraped them clean and white, wash them and put them into a pot of warm, but not boiling water, with a little salt. Let them boil gently till by turning a fork in the flesh it will easily break, and the bones are all loosened. Take off the scum as it rises. When they are done take them out of the water and lay them in vinegar enough to cover them, adding to it a quarter of a pint of the water in which they were boiled. Add whole pepper and spice with cloves and mace. Put them in a jar and cover them closely. Soused feet may be eaten cold from the vinegar, split in two from top to toe ; or they may be split in two, dipped in flour, and fried in hot lard; or they may be broiled and buttered. But in the latter case they should be nicely browned. Anchovy Toast. 37. Six or eight anchovies ; one and a half ounce of butter slices of toast. Bone and skin six or seven anchovies. After washing them very clean, pound them in a mortar with an ounce and a half of butter, and then rub them through a sieve ; take some thin slices of bread, and cut them out with a tin cutter, into squares or rounds ; fry them brown in a little butter, and spread over them (when cold) the anchovy mixture. Wash some anchovies, cut them in four, and put a piece on the top of each slice of toast; serve on a napkin garnished with crisped parsley. Shrimp Toast. Time, half an hour. 38. One quart of shrimps ; three quarters of a pint of water ; one ounce and a half of butter ; half a teaspoonful of flour ; a pinch of Cayenne, more or less, according to taste ; a squeeze of lemon ; two eggs. Shell the shrimps, bruise their heads, and boil them in three quarters of a pint of water for half an hour. Strain this liquor off from them through a fine sieve. Melt an ounce and a half of butter as directed before. Add to it, as soon as it begins to simmer, a little Cayenne to your taste. Shake the whole together till the colour of the butter and flour darkens, then pour into it gradually and carefully the liquor in which the heads were stewed. Boil this sauce, and just as it reaches boil- ing point put in the shrimps, and let them get hot quite through. Have ready a toast cut from the bottom crust of a loaf more than an inch thick, a little hollowed out and fried in fresh butter. Make a liaison, or thickening, of the yolks of two eggs ; stir this in just as you are about to take up the shrimps, and spread the shrimps on the toast. Add a squeeze of lemon, if you like it, to the mixture. Another and simple way is to use nearly the same quantities thus omitting the water in which the heads are boiled. Two ounces of butter; a teaspoonful of flour. Melt the butter, warm the shrimps in it, throw in a little Cayenne, and five drops of anchovy essence, and serve on the toast. Broiled Mushrooms. Time, eight minutes. 39. Sufficient flap mushrooms for a dish ; pepper and salt ; a piece of butter. Wipe your mushrooms very clean with a piece of flannel, and salt; peel the tops, and cut the stalks partly off. Put them over a very clear fire, and broil them lightly on both sides. When done, arrange them on a dish ; dust a little pepper and salt over them, and put a piece of butter on each3» Fish. mushroom. Place them before the fire for a few minutes to melt the butter, and serve them up quickly. To Cook Kippered Salmon for Breakfast. Time, about five minutes to broil the salmon. 40. Half to three quarters of a pound of kippered salmon ; a little pepper. Have ready a well heated gridiron (the bars of which should be greased), and a nice clear fire. Cut the salmon into narrow bars of convenient size, wrap them in buttered writing paper, and broil, turning them once or twice. Serve on a very hot dish, laying the pieces across each other. Finnon Haddocks. Time, about ten minutes. 41. These fish, which are much esteemed, are dressed open on account of one side being thicker than the other. They are generally bought prepared for cooking, and only require a little soaking before they are put on the gridiron. When done lay the fish on a hot dish, and put a little cold fresh butter on it. To Cook Red Herrings and Bloaters. Time, five minutes. 42. Scrape them and wipe them nicely ; cut them from head to tail ; lay them open ; broil them on a greased gridiron for about six minutes, turning them as required. When they are done, lay them open on a hot dish, and put a little butter on them. To Broil Black Puddings. Time, five minutes. 43. Make little diagonal cuts in the skin of the black pudding with a knife. Broil it over a brisk fire, turning it often. Serve it very hot. Sausages. Time, twenty minutes. 44. Prick the sausages with a large needle or fine skewer all over, this will prevent the skin from cracking, broil them over a gentle fire for about twenty minutes. Serve v£ry hot on toast. We prefer putting them into hot water for one minute before dressing, to extract the oil from the skin. Directions for making sausage meat will be found under Ihe head of Pork. FISH. Fish is a delicious adjunct to the dinner table, and in some families may suffice for -a good dinner by itself ; but it requires nice id careful dressing. What can be more unappetizing than a fish brought to table broken all to pieces, as we have seen it, or not half done—salmon red with blood—cod nearly raw—or mackerel not properly cleaned? It is a wicked waste of the pro- vision God has made for his creatures to thus spoil it, when a little attention and study may preserve it for us. And first, let great care be taken to well clean the fish before it is dressed. It is better to let the fishmonger clean it for you ; but if you are compelled to do it for your- self, take care that you slit it low enough, so as not to leave any blood, &c., on the back- bone. We have been obliged to send fish from our own table untasted inconsequence of a careless cook neglecting this part of her duty. In almost all kinds of fish the portions to be removed are the gills, the alimentary or- gans, and the settlement of slime and other impurities inside and outside the fish. Dex- terity must be used to cleanse the inside thoroughly without making too large an in- cision, which disfigures the fish when it comes to table, and may make it, if it is for boiling, watery. The sound, which adheres to the bone, must be left undisturbed, but cleansed ; the hard and soft roe must also be left in their places ; and care must be taken not to injure the liver, but, with most fish, to replace it. Especial care must be taken not to break the gall, as that renders the fish very bitter. As a medium in which to fry, there is nothing better than pure oil, but it is ex- pensive, because the fish must have abun- dance in the pan or it will not turn out well, and wear the bright gold hue that should characterize fried fish. If it be found inconvenient to use oil, plenty of good dripping or lard will do as well. Butter is apt to turn fish black and make them soft. It is utterly useless, however, to provide fine oil or clear fat for frying, if the pan be soiled or smoked, for that will spoil the colour and the flavour too of the fish, be it dressed as carefully as it can be in other respects. Fish-kettles, with plates of con- venient sizes, and kept scrupulously clean, are likewise necessary; also a gridiron for broiling. These utensils are requisite for the methods of dressing fish which are generally most popular. Supposing you chance not to have a fish- kettle and yet wish to dress fish by boiling, you may manage thus : put the fish in a circle on a dinner plate, and tie a napkin over it; then put it in a large saucepan. When it has boiled long enough, take it up carefully by the cloth, drain off all the water,To Boil Turbot. 39 and slide the fish on a white napkin neatly folded on a dish. Garnish and serve. Fresh-water fish have often a muddy taste and smell, which may be got rid of by soaking them in strong salt and water before they are cooked. Saltfish should be soaked in water before boiling according to the time it has been in salt. When it is hard and dry, it will require thirty-six hours soaking before it is dressed, and the water must be changed three or four times. When fish is not very salt, twenty-four hours, or even one night will suffice. Crimped fish must be put into boiling water, and when it has been placed on the fire and re-boils, pour in a teacupful of cold water to check it, and let it simmer a few minutes. Salmon is put into warm water to be dressed. Cod, whiting, and haddock are better if kept a day before boiling ; just putting a little salt on them the night before dressing. But some great cooks have advocated dressing cod quite fresh ; from our own ex- perience we prefer it kept for twelve hours. To Fry Fish. 45. Cleanse them thoroughly, dry them on a folded cloth, dredge flour lightly over them, brush them with a well-beaten egg, then dip them in fine bread-crumbs. Have ready enough fine oil, or meucd lard or beef dripping (clarified), to entirely cover the fish. Place the frying-pan over a clear fire. Let the lard reach boiling-point, and then immerse the fish in it. You may try whether the fat is hot enough by letting a drop of cold water fall into it from the end of your spoon. If the hot fat spits it is ready for use. Then fry, turning the fish (when one side is browned) to the other. When it is done lay it on a cloth, or on white blotting-paper, to drain off all the fat ; or put it on a reversed sieve for a little while. Serve it extremely dry on a white cloth or embossed fish paper. To Broil Fish. 46. A clear fire is required. Rub the bars of your gridiron with dripping or a piece of beef suet, to prevent the fish from sticking to it. Put a good piece of butter into a dish, work into it enough salt and pepper to season the fish. Lay the fish on it when it is broiled, and with a knife blade put the butter over every part. Serve very hot. To Boil Turbot. Time, one hour, fbr ten pounds, more or less according to weight. 47. Empty the fish, wash the inside, rub a little salt over the outside to help remove the slime. Put it in water to cleanse it, change the water several times. Pour plenty of cold spring water into a fish-kettle, add to each a gallon of water, four ounces of salt, and a quarter of an ounce, or less, of salt- petre. Let this dissolve while you prepare your turbot. Make an incision in the skin of the back nearly to the bone, to prevent the skin of the white side from cracking. Do not cut off the fins, these are considered a delicacy. Place the turbot on the fish- plate, and put it into the water, which should quite cover it. Let it boil slowly and skim the water very carefully. Then let it simmer gently for about half an hour, if it is of great size, according to the propor- tionate weight. When it is done lift up the fish plate and let it drain ; keep it very hot while you garnish it with lobster coral (which must be rubbed through a fine hair sieve) ; then slide it gently on a hot dish, on which a folded damask napkin or an ornamental fish paper has been placed previously. It is usual to serve the under or white part of the turbot uppermost, and certainly the contrast of the pure white skin with the lobster coral ornamentation on it, makes it the most inviting-looking fish served. But epicures have lately preferred it served with the dark side or back upwards, on account of some supposed superiority of the flesh of the fish on that side. It is given in our engraving in the newest mode of serving it ; but not being an epicure ourselves, we pre- fer the old and more picturesque fashion. Garnish with sprigs of curled parsley and slices of lemon alternately. Sauce.—Lobster, shrimp, or anchovy, in a tureen. Twice-laid Turbot. Time, twenty minutes. 48. The remains of a turbot boiled the day previously ; two tablespoonfuls of flour ; one quart of milk ; a small bunch of par- sley ; a bay-leaf and a little thyme ; a spoon- ful of salt, and a saltspoon (not quite full) of pepper; a quarter of a pound of fresh butter. Pick the fish from its bones and warm it gently in salt and water. While it is doing make a sauce of the ingredients given above by mixing the flour and milk very smoothly, adding the herbs and seasoning, and stirring it over the fire till it is tolerably thick. Then lift it to the side of the fire, stir in a quarter of a pound of butter, and pass it through a sieve. Cover the bottom of the dish with this simple white sauce, lay on it some of your fish, sprinkling it with white pepper and4° Brill—John Dory—Salmon. salt, then put more sauce, then more fish, till the whole is used up. Sprinkle bread- crumbs over it, and bake it in a hot oven for twenty minutes. Brown it, and serve it in the same dish. Other fiat fish, which are no less popular in their way than the king of flat fish, the turbot, are the brill, the plaice, the flounder, the dab, the sole and the marble sole. The brill is said by some to be almost equal to the turbot, and is dressed in the same way. The plaice, however, when large and fine, is little if at all inferior to this more popular fish. A large plaice boiled, or a small one fried, are not to be despised ; but they are Jess firm in the flesh than the turbot and the sole, on which account they are less gene- rally liked. The flounder, the fluke or mayock fluke of Edinburgh, the butt of Yarmouth fishermen, the carrelel of the French, is a sea-fish, but ascends rivers and lives in salt, brackish, or fresh water. The Thames flounders are especial favourites. Flounders which are brought to market are generally small, but specimens have been known weighing as much as four pounds. The dab, the saltie of the Scotch, la limandc of the French, is a nice little fish, which is brought to the London market in great abundance : it is usually about eight or ten inches long. All flat fish are very tenacious of life. They should be thick, and very firm and stiff, and the eyes should be bright. THE BRILL. A large brill is with difficulty to be dis- tinguished from a small turbot when very well cooked. It is longer and not so round. In season from August to April. Brill. Time, ten to twenty minutes. 49. One brill; four ounces of salt to each gallon of water ; a tablespoonful of vinegar. Thoroughly clean and remove the scales from a fine fresh brill; do not cut off the fins, but mb it over with the juice of a lemon and a little salt ; set it in a fish- kettle with sufficient cold water, a handful of salt, and a tablespoonful of vinegar to cover it; bring it gradually to boil, and then simmer for ten or twenty minutes, according to the size of the fish. Skim it well, as great care is required to preserve the beauty of its colour. Serve it on a napkin, and garnish with lemon, curled parsley, and horseradish; sprinkle some lobster coral over the fish, and send it to table with lobster sauce in a tureen. To Boil the John Dory. Time, three-quarters of an hour. 50. Four ounces of salt; one gallon of water. Prepare the fish as you do a turbot. Put it into a fish-kettle with sufficient water to cover it, with the salt in proportion to the quantity of water; bring it to the boil, and let it simmer gradually for about three- quarters of an hour—more or less according to the size of your fish. Serve it in a neatly folded napkin, and garnish with curled parsley and slices of lemon alternately. Lobster-sauce, shrimp-sauce, or plain melted butter can be sent up with it in a tureen. Boiled Salmon, Time, according to weight. 51. One salmon ; four ounces of salt to one gallon of water. Salmon is put into warm water instead of cold, in order to preserve its colour and set the curd. It should be thoroughly well dressed to be wholesome. Scale it; empty and wash it with the greatest care. Do not leave any blood in the inside that you can remove. Boil the salt rapidly in the fish-kettle for a minute or two, taking off the scum as it rises ; put in the salmon, first trussing it in the shape of the letter S, and let it boil gently till it is thoroughly done. Take it from the water on the fish-plate, let it drain, put it on a hot folded fish napkin, and garnish with slices of lemon. Sauce: shrimp or lobster. Send up dressed cucumber with salmon. Middle Slice of Salmon. Time, ten minutes to the pound. 52. Middle piece or slice. Boil slowly in salt and water. Salmon should be put into warm water, which makes it eat firmer. Boil gently. Serve on a napkin. Sauce : lobster, shrimp, or plain melted butter and parsley. Broiled Salmon. Time, ten to fifteen minutes. 53. Slices from the middle of a salmon ; one tablespoonful of flour; a sheet or two of oiled letter-paper; a little Cayenne pepper. Cut slices of an inch or an inch and a half thick from the middle of a large salmon : dust a little Cayenne pepper over them ; wrap them in oiled or buttered paper, and broil them over a clear fire, first rubbing the bars of the gridiron with suet. Broiled salmon is extremely rich, and really requires no sauce. The slices may also be simply dried in a cloth, floured and broiled over a clear fire ; but they require the greatest care then to prevent them from burning. The gridiron is always rubbed with suet first.4i Cod—Salt-fish. To Pickle Salmon. Time, twelve or fourteen hours. 54. One ounce of whole black pepper; one ounce of whole allspice ; four bay- leaves ; some salt; with equal quantities of vinegar and the liquor in which the fish was boiled. Remove the bone from a boiled salmon, or part of one that has been boiled, and lay it in a dish ; boil a sufficient quantity of the liquor the fish was boiled in, with the same quantity of vinegar ; one ounce of black pepper ; one ounce of allspice ; four bay leaves ; and some salt. When cold pour it over the fish ; and in twelve or fourteen hours it will be fit for use. Cod’s Head and Shoulders. Time, half an hour or more. 55. Cod's head and shoulders ; four ounces of salt to each gallon of water ; a little horseradish. Rub a little salt down the bone and the thick part of the fish, and tie a fold or two of wide tape round it to prevent its break- ing. Lay it in a fish-kettle with sufficient cold water to cover it, with salt in the above proportion; add three spoonfuls of vinegar and a little horseradish. Let the water be brought just to the verge of boiling ; then draw the fish-kettle to the side of the fire, to simmer gently till the fish is done ; which can be ascertained by trying it with a fish slice, to see if the meat can be separated easily from the bone ; skim it well and care- fully. When done, drain it and slip it off the fish strainer on a napkin neatly folded in a dish. Garnish with double parsley, lemon, and the roe and liver of the co l. If the cod be crimped, it will require a shorter time to dress it. 'Picked Cod. Time, fifteen minutes. 56. About one pound and a half of dressed cod ; a little oyster and egg sauce ; two hard boiled eggs ; and four parsnips, or some mashed potatoes. Pick about a pound and a half of dressed cod-fish into flakes, and put it in layers, with a little oyster and egg sauce alternately, in a stewpan. Make it thoroughly hot. When it is done, pile it in the centre of a dish, and serve with mashed potatoes in a wall round it, browned with a salamander ; or garnish it with slices of hard-boiled eggs, and par- snips cut into shapes. Salt Cod. Time, one hour. 57. Put the cod in water the night before it is wanted, and let it soak all night ; boil it; lay it in a dish; and send it up hot, with egg sauce. If it be preferred, instead of the egg sauce, boil parsnips quite tender, mash them with butter, cream or milk, and spread them round the salt fish. If the cod be very dry, soak it for several hours, lay it out to dry in a cold place, and then soak it again for a number of hours. This double soaking is said to soften the driest fish. Salt Fish the Second Day. Time, twenty minutes. 58. The remains of salt fish previously dressed ; same quantity of mashed potatoes and parsnips ; a quarter of a pound of butter ; a little Cayenne ; one egg. Pick the remains of the fish into small flakes ; butter the bottom of a pie-dish, place it in alternate layers with the mashed parsnips and potatoes; sprinkle a little Cayenne in the dish. Bake for about twenty minutes in the oven ; turn it out on a dish ; garnish with a hard-boiled egg cut in slices, and pour over it a little melted butter, or in- stead of the sliced egg, use egg sauce. Cod Sounds Boiled. Time to boil, half an hour. 59. Cod sounds ; half a pint of milk. Soak the cod sounds in warm water half an hour, then scrape and clean them ; boil them in milk and water until tender ; when done, serve them on a napkin with egg sauce. The salt must not be soaked out of the sounds unless for fricassee. Broiled Cod Sounds. Time, three-quarters of an hour. 60. Lay the cod sounds for a few minutes in hot water, rub them with a little salt, clean them until they look white, and give them a gentle boil. Take them up, dry them, flour them, sprinkle salt and pepper over them, and broil them. Serve them with melted butter and mustard, or whatever sauce may be preferred. Baked Hake. Time, varying with size. 61. Be very careful in cleaning your hake, then stuff it with veal stuffing, sew it up with packthread, egg and bread-crumb it over, set it in a baking dish, and put it into a hot oven. Let it bake till the fish parts easily from the bones. It is impossible to fix a time unless the size of the fish were stated.42 Whiting—Mullels— Trout—Carp. Fried Whiting. Time to fry, ten minutes. 6-.!. Egg; bread-crumbs; and a little flom. Clean the whitings, take off the skin, turn them round, and fasten the tail into the mouth ; dry them in flour. Brush them over with an egg well beaten, roll them in bread ciumbs, and fry them in hot lard, and serve them on a napkin, garnished with fried parsley, and shrimp or anchovy sauce, separately. To Boil Whiting. Time, ten minutes for large fish. 63. Four or six whitings ; some anchovy sauce, or plain melted butter ; and three ounces of salt to each gallon of water. Thoroughly cleanse the fish, and lay them in the fish-kettle, with sufficient water to cover them. Bring them slowly to a boil, and simmer for five or six minutes, or for a longer time should your fish be large. Dish them on a folded napkin, and garnish with bunches of double parsley. Serve with an- chovy sauce, or plain melted butter. Eed Mullets in Papers. Time, twenty-five minutes. 64. Two mullets ; one ounce of butter ; one teaspoonful of Harvey’s sauce ; one glass of wine; four truffles ; six mush- rooms ; a little parsley ; a little shallot; one teaspoonful of lemon juice ; a little flour ; three eggs ; one spoonful of cream ; a little nutmeg. Place the mullets in a sautd-pan with the butter, sauce, and wine. Bake them in the oven slowly for ten minutes. Take the fish out of the pan ; strain off their liquor ; add to it the truffles, mushrooms, parsley, shallot, nutmeg, lemon juice, and flour; stir all together over the fire for six or eight minutes, then add a liaison of three well beaten yolks of eggs and a spoonful of cream. Take two sheets of letter paper, oil them well, lay tlje mullets on them and spread an equal proportion of sauce over each. Then fold the papers over them and roll the edges together to fasten them. Broil the mullets over a slow fire, suffi- ciently to brown them on both sides, and warm them through, but be careful not to burn the paper. When done serve them on a napkin. To Dress Mullets. Time, twenty-five minutes. 65. Three red mullets ; four spoonfuls of anchovy sauce ; a little pepper and salt; one tablespoonful of chopped shallot; one of chopped parsley ; one spoonful of chopped mushrooms ; four tablespoonfuls of claret; a piece of glaze the size of a walnut. Take three red mullets, place them in a tin in the oven with four spoonfuls of an- chovy sauce, a little pepper and salt. Put into a deep sautd-pan a tablespoon- ful of chopped shallot, the same of parsley, the same of chopped mushrooms, four table- spoonfuls of claret, a piece of glaze the size of a walnut. Stew them well together. When the fish is baked, pour this sauce over them. Eed Mullet Eaked. Time, twenty-five minutes. 66. Two mullets ; some essence of an- chovies ; a piece of butter; a little flour ; and the juice of half a lemon. Fold each mullet in oiled or well buttered paper, tie the ends, pass the string over them, and bake in a small dish in a moderate oven. Make a sauce of the liquor that comes from the fish, with a piece of butter, a little flour, a teaspoonful of essence of anchovies, and the juice of half a lemon. Boil it and serve it in a sauceboat, and the fish in their paper cases. Trout Boiled. Time, twenty to thirty minutes. 67. The fish ; one wineglassful of vinegar ; water, salt, and a piece of horseradish. Rub and wipe the fish very dry, put them into a fish-kettle of boiling water with a wineglassful of vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of salt, and a piece of horseradish. Boil them slowly for twenty minutes or half an hour, talcing care that the skin is not broken, and serve them on a napkin with anchovy sauce, orplain melted butter. Baked Carp. Time, one hour and a quarter. In season from March to October. 68. One large carp ; forcemeat; egg; bread-crumbs ; a little butter ; one pint of stock ; half a pint of port wine ; two onions ; two bay-leaves ; a bunch of herbs ; six an- chovies ; one teaspoonful of mustard ; one of soy ; a little salt ; Cayenne ; and apiece of butter. Clean and scale a large carp ; put a stuffing as for soles dressed in the Portu- guese way, and sew it up ; brush it over with the yolk of an egg, and cover it with bread- crumbs, then drop some oiled butter over it. Place the carp in a deep earthen dish, with a pint of stock, two onions sliced, two bay-leaves, a bunch of herbs, half a pint of port wine, and six anchovies;43 Tench—Plaice—Flounders— S melts— Sprats. cover the pan, and bake it one hour. Put a good sized piece of butter into a stewpan with a dust of flour; when melted, pour in the strained liquor from the carp, with a teaspoonful of mustard, one of soy, and a little salt and Cayenne ; boil it up again, and serve the fish on a dish, garnished with slices of lemon and bunches of parsley, and the sauce in a boat. Fried Carp. Time, twenty minutes or longer, according to size. 69. Carp ; slices of bread ; a lemon. Clean and dry the fish, flour them well, put them in the pan, and fry them of a light brown ; lay them on a cloth to drain, and fry some three-cornered pieces of bread and the roes. Serve the carp with the roes on each side of the dish ; garnish it with the fried bread and lemon in slices, and make anchovy sauce, with the juice of a lemon added, to eat with it. Fried Tench. Time, varying with size—about twenty minutes. 70. Two tench; a little salt ; lemon juice ; butter ; and flour. Clean two fine tench by throwing them into boiling water just long enough to enable you to raise the skin. Remove the gills and fins, gut them, and clean them thoroughly. Cut them down the back, and take out the bones, sprinkle a little salt over them, flour them, squeeze some lemon juice over them ; fry them in butter, and serve them upon a napkin. To Fillet Plaice. Time, about twelve minutes. 71. Skin them, lay them flat on the table, and cut right down the backbone, then raise the fillet from head to tail. Having quite removed the fillets from the bones, cut them nicely in pieces, and fry them in two ounces of dripping or lard, with a little pepper and salt, and the juice of half a lemon. Drain them on a cloth to absorb the grease, and serve them upon a hot white table-napkin. To Boil Plaice or Flounders. Time, six to seven minutes. Flounders are in'season from September to November. 72. A quarter of a pound of salt to a gallon of water, and a very little saltpetre. Well clean and empty your fish, draw a sharp knife down the thickest part of the middle of the back, nearly through to the bone; lay them in a fish-kettle of cold water, with salt in the above proportion, with a small piece of saltpetre ; let them simmer for six or seven minutes after the water begins to boil, or longer should your fish be very large, taking great care they are not broken. Serve them (with plain melted butter) on a folded napkin. To Fry Plaice or Flounders. Time, five minutes. 73. Two tablespoonfuls of vinegar; an egg ; bread-crumbs ; fried parsley ; and some anchovy sauce. Sprinkle the plaice or flounders with salt, and let them lie for twenty-four hours, then wash them and wipe them dry ; brush them over with egg, and cover them with bread- crumbs ; make some lard or dripping mixed with two tablespoonfuls of vinegar boiling hot in a frying-pan ; lay the fish in, and fry them a nice brown colour, drain them from the fat on a cloth, and serve them on a folded napkin, garnished with fried parsley. Anchovy sauce. To Fry Smelts. Time, three or four minutes. 74. Seven smelts; two eggs; bread- crumbs ; a little flour; and a piece of butter. Smelts should not be washed more than is necessary to just clean them ; cut off the fins, dry them in a cloth, and dredge a little flour over them, melt half an ounce of butter and beat into it the yolks of two eggs. Dip the smelts into it, then into bread- crumbs finely grated, and plunge them into a frying-pan of boiling fat ; let them fry gently, and a few minutes will make them of a bright yellow brown. Be careful not to take off the light roughness of the crumbs, or their beauty will be lost. When done, dish them up on a napkin, garnish with fried parsley, and serve anchovy or shrimp sauce with them separately. Fried Smelts, French Way. Time, three or four minutes. 75. Smelts ; a little flour; milk ; crisped parsley. After the smelts are prepared and dried dip them into milk, dredge them with flour, and fry them until they are of a fine colour, and serve them with crisped parsley. Sprats. Time, two or three minutes. 76. Well clean a number of sprats, fasten them in rows by a skewer run through their gills, place them on a close-barred gridiron, broil them a nice brown, and serve them hot and hot.Soles' and Eels. 44 Filleted Soles. Time, ten minutes. 77. Two soles; one egg; and bread- crumbs. Take two soles, divide them from the backbone, and remove the head, fins, and tail. Sprinkle the inside with salt, roll them up from the tail end upwards, and fasten then with very small skewers. If small or middling-sized soles, put half a fish in each roll. Dip them into the yolk of a well beaten egg, and then into bread-crumbs ; then into the egg a second time, and again sprinkle them with crumbs ; fry them in hot lard, or in clarified butter. Instead of rolling the fish they may be cut into pieces, and arranged in the form of a pyramid in the centre of a dish, and gar- nished with parsley and slices of lemon. Boiled Soles. Time, eight to ten minutes. 78. Two soles ; a large handful of salt in one gallon of water. Well wash and clean the soles, cut off the fins, and put them into a fish-kettle with salt and water. Let them boil slowly, and then simmer until done, which must be ac- cording to the weight of the fish, a large one requiring about ten minutes, a medium size eight. When done, serve them on a napkin, with the white side uppermost. Garnish with slices of lemon and parsley. Anchovy or shrimp sauce are usually sent to table with boiled soles, but may be varied at pleasure. Fried Soles. Time, eight minutes. 79. Two soles ; one egg ; a few bread- crumbs. Remove the skin from the dark side of the soles, clean them, and wipe them dry, and dredge a little flour over them ; brush them over with the yolk of a well-beaten egg, dip them into bread-crumbs, and fry them of a light brown, in sufficient boiling fat for them to swim in. When done, lay them on a cloth to absorb the grease ; dish them on a napkin neatly folded, and garnish with fried parsley. Plain melted butter or shrimp sauce may be sent to table with them. Eels Spitchcocked. Time, half an hour, or till the skin turns up. 80. Two or three eels ; some chopped parsley ; pepper ; salt ; a little sage ; juice of half a lemon ; eggs, and bread-crumbs ; a little mace ; and a little warmed butter. Skin two or three large eels, open them on the belly side, and clean them thoroughly ; remove the backbone, and cut them into pieces three or four inches long; strew over them, on both sides, some chopped parsley, a very little sage, pepper, salt, a little mace pounded fine, a little warmed butter, and the juice of nearly half a lemon ; dip each piece carefully in egg and bread- crumbs ; fry them in a pan of boiling fat, and serve them on a hot dish, in a circular form, with piquante sauce (or any other you like) in the centre. Baked Eels. Time, three-quarters of an hour. 81. Four large eels ; some veal stock ; a bunch of savoury herbs ; a sprig of parsley ; two glasses of port wine ; juice of a small lemon ; salt and Cayenne ; one tea- spoonful of Worcestershire sauce. Skin, empty, and thoroughly wash the eels, cut off the heads, and divide them into rather short pieces, wipe them very dry, dip each piece into a seasoning of Cayenne, salt, minced parsley, and a little powdered savoury herbs ; put them into a deep dish, cover them with veal stock, put a thick paper or cover over the dish, and set it in the oven until the eels are tender. Skim off the fat, take the pieces of fish carefully out on a hot dish to keep warm, and stir into the gravy the wine, strained lemon juice, and sauce ; make it just boil up, and pour it over the fish. Garnish with sliced lemon. Boiled Eels. Time, half an hour. 82. Some small eels, and a little parsley and butter. The small eels are the best; do them in sufficient water to cover them, add a bunch of parsley ; when tender, they are done. Serve them up in a shallow tureen, with parsley and butter sauce poured over them. Fried Eels. Time, eighteen or twenty minutes. 83. One large eel, or two small ones; one egg, and a few bread-crumbs. Prepare and wash the eels, wipe them thoroughly dry, and dredge over them a very little flour ; if large, cut them into pieces of about four inches long, brush them over with egg, dip them into bread-crumbs, and fry them in hot fat. If small, they should be curled round and fried, being first dipped into egg and bread-crumbs. Serve them up garnished with fried parsley. Boiled Conger. Time, half an hour. 84. White conger eel; bread-crumbs ;45 Conger and Perch. peel of half a lemon ; a sprig of parsley; lemon thyme; winter savory ; sweet mar- joram ; a piece of butter or dripping ; pepper ; salt; nutmeg, and a spoonful of suet. Cut a piece about a foot long from the head end of a fine conger, make a stuffing of the bread-crumbs, minced parsley, lemon thyme, winter savory, and sweet marjoram minced fine ; a little chopped suet, grated lemon peel, and butter or dripping ; season it with pepper, salt, and nutmeg ; stuff the fish, and sew it up. Put it into warm water, let it simmer until it is cooked enough, and serve it with any sauce usually eaten with boiled fish. A thick piece will take half an hour after it simmers. It may be boiled without the stuffing, if it be preferred. Stewed Conger. Time, according to size. 85. A conger eel; a bunch of sweet herbs ; one onion ; pepper ; salt, and mace ; water or broth ; a little flour. Cut the conger into pieces as for frying, dry and flour the pieces, and brown them in a frying-pan. Put them into a stewpan with a bunch of sweet herbs, an onion cut in quarters, seasoning of pepper and salt, and of spice, if it be liked, and enough water, or broth, nearly to cover the fish. Let it stew gently until it is cooked enough, thicken the gravy with flour just enough to take off the richness that may have risen to the top, and serve the conger with the gravy round it. The gravy may be flavoured with toma- toes, chutney, or any other sauce. The stewed conger is nice with oysters ; open them, and save the liquor, mix it with a little flour, use it to thicken the gravy, as much as necessary, let it just boil up, and put in the oysters long enough for them to get hot. Baked Conger. Time, one hour ; less in a quick oven. 86. Take such a piece of fine conger as would be chosen for boiling ; make a stuff- ing, and stuff it as mentioned for boiled conger. Put it into a pie dish or a baking dish, with a pint of water, lay pieces of butter over the fish, flour it well, and put it into a moderate oven ; baste it often with the liquor while it is cooking, and when it is almost done thicken the liquor with flour, just enough to correct any little richness that may float on the top of it; not more. Baked conger may be varied in many ways. It is very nice with potatoes baked under it; but as there must be liquor in the dish with which to baste the fish, to prevent the skin getting dry and hard, they will not brown on the outside. The gravy may be thickened with tomatoes, or with tomato sauce, and this is particularly nice. It may be taken from the liquor, and eaten with dressed cucumber and early potatoes. It may be flavoured with or eaten with any sauce that is nice, and it will be excellent any way. A good flavouring for a change, is a tablespoonful of lemon pickle, the same of walnut ketchup, and a dessertspoonful of soy. Tried Conger. Time, twenty to twenty-five minutes, or longer. 87. Conger ; egg ; bread-crumbs. Cut the conger into slices an inch and a half or two inches thick, or a little thicker, according to the size of the fish. This is the best way to cut conger for frying, and most other purposes for which it may re- quire similar subdivision ; because by it the solid back of the fish and the richer under part go together, which they do not when collops are cut longitudinally. Cover the fish with egg and bread-crumbs, and fry it in plenty of fat, made to boil before the fish is put in. Take care that the frying-pan is perfectly clean, and that the fish is fried to a bright colour. Serve it with lemon to squeeze over it, plain melted butter, oyster sauce, shrimp sauce, or any sauce preferred. PERCH. It is so difficult to scale perch that some people have them boiled with the scales on, as they come off easily afterwards. To Boil Perch. Time, half an hour, if large. 88. Cut off the spines from the back, scrape off the scales with an oyster knife, and thoroughly clean and wash them. Then boil them in cold water very carefully, as they are a most delicate fish. To Fry Perch Plain. Time, twelve minutes. 89. When the perch are scaled, gutted, and washed, dry them well with a cloth, and lay them out singly before the fire for a few minutes. Flour them well, and fry them a fine brown in plenty of good drip- ping. Serve them with melted butter and crisped parsley. To Boil Piko. Time, half an hour to one hour. 90. Pike; twelve oysters; half of q46 Pike-Mackerel—Haddocks—Skate. French roll; two eggs ; lemon ; sweet herbs ; pepper ; salt ; nutmeg ; a lump of butter ; a wineglass of vinegar. When you have taken out the gills, cleaned and thoroughly washed the fish, make a forcemeat of a dozen chopped oysters, the crumb of half, or a whole French roll, a little lemon peel shred fine, a lump of butter, a few sweet herbs, the yolks of two well beaten eggs, seasoned to your taste with pepper, salt, and nutmeg. Mix all together and stuff the fish ; sew it up, and fasten it with the tail in the mouth with a small skewar. Put it into a fish-kettle of boiling water with a wineglassful of vinegar and a tablespoonful of salt. If it is of a middling size, it will be done in about half an hour ; or, if large, one hour. Serve it up with melted butter and a lemon, or with anchovy sauce. Garnish with pickled bar- berries. To Bake Pike. Time, one hour. 91. A large pike ; some forcemeat; two or three anchovies ; half the peel of a lemon ; one glass of wine ; one tablespoonful of sauce ; a spoonful of capers. Scale and wash a large pike, fill it well with stuffing made as for veal, skewer the tail in the mouth, and place it in a deep dish. Season it with salt. Put a good- sized piece of butter over it, and bake it for an hour. When done, add to it about half a pint or more of the gravy, two or three small anchovies chopped very fine, the rind of half a lemon, grated, a spoonful of capers, a large spoonful of sauce, either Worcester or Reading, a glass of wine, and a little butter rolled in flour to thicken it. Serve the fish on a dish and the sauce in a boat. Mackerel Boiled. Time, fifteen to twenty minutes. 92. Cut the fish open sufficiently to empty the inside, remove the roes, and thoroughly wash them and tire mackerel. Put the fish into a fish-kettle of cold water with a large tablespoonful of salt, bring them gradually to a boil, and simmet for about twenty minutes if the fish is large ; if small, fifteen minutes will be sufficient, or even less time ; but they must be taken carefully out when the eyes are starting. Remove the scum as it rises, and when done, serve them on a napkin, and send fennel sauce, plain melted butter, or gooseberry sauce to table with them. To Boil Haddocks. Time, a quarter to half an hour, according to size. 93. Two haddocks; enough water to cover them; a quarter of a pound of salt to each gallon of water. Clean the fish,'and wash them thoroughly, they will require scraping first, then put them in the fish-kettle; simmer them gently. Serve with a garnish of sliced lemon and parsley. Sauce : melted butter or anchovy. Baked Haddock. Time, from half an hour to an hour. 94. One haddock ; some veal stuffing, bread-crumbs, and one egg. Thoroughly clean and dry the haddock, fill the inside with veal stuffing, sew it up, and curl the tail into its mouth. Brush it over with egg, and strew bread-crumbs over it. Set it in a warm oven to bake for about half an hour, but if a Dublin Bay haddock, it will require double that time. Serve it on a dish without a napkin, with any sauce you please, anchovy, melted butter, &c. To Broil Haddock. Time, half an hour. 95. Clean and dry the haddock, and put it into a Dutch oven before a very quick fire ; as soon as the skin rises take it from the fire, brush it over with the yolk of a well-beaten egg. Strew bread-crumbs thickly over it, and dredge it with flour. Rub some butter over a gridiron, lay the fish carefully on it, and each time turned, lay a small slice of butter over it. Serve with shrimp sauce or melted butter. To Crimp Skate. Time to soak, one hour. 96. Have the skate alive ; skin, and wash it very clean, cut it in long slips the whole length of the fish, about an inch broad, roll it over your finger, and throw it into spring water; cut the middle part of the fish in any form you like, wash it well, and put it into spring water for one hour, then wash it very clean, and put it to drain for use. To Boil Crimped Skate. Time, fifteen to twenty minutes. 97. Clean, skin, and cut the fish into slices, roll them over your finger, and fasten them round with a thin string. Put them into a stewpan with a large quantity of salt in the water ; boil them for about fifteen or twenty minutes, and hold them over the stewpan to drain ; remove the string, and serve them on a folded napkin placed in a hot dish. Shrimp or lob. ter sauce may be served with it. To Fry Skate. * 9S. Brush it over with the yolk of a well- beaten egg, and cover it with bread-crumbs,L obsters— Crabs— Oysters. 47 fry it a nice brown, and serve it on a hot table-napkin, with anchovy or shrimp sauce. SHELL-FISH—LOBSTER. To Choose Lobsters. 99. The heaviest are the best, and very often a good small-sized lobster will weigh heavier than a large one. The male is the best for boiling, the flesh is firmer, the shell of a brighter red. You may easily distinguish the hen lobster by its broader tail, and the two uppermost fins within the tail being less stiff and hard than those of the male lobster. Hen lobsters are best for sauce or salad, on account of their coral. To Boil a Lobster. Time, half an hour. 100. Boiling a lobster may be made a horrible operation if the advice we are about to give is not attended to ; and its cries in dying are said to be most painful. Happily it is possible to kill it immediately. It is done thus :— Put into a large kettle water enough to cover the lobster, with a quarter of a pound of salt to every gallon of water. When it boils fast put in the lobster, head this is a little difficult to achieve, as the lobster is not easy to hold thus over the hot steam, but we are sure any humane cook will do it. If the head goes in first it is killed instantly. Boil it briskly for half an hour, then take it from the hot water with the tongs, and lay it to drain. Wipe off all the scum from it; tie a little piece of butter in a cloth and rub it over with it. A lobster weighing a pound takes one hour to boil, others in like proportion, more or less. To Dress Lobsters. 101. When sent to table, separate the body from the tail, remove the large claws, and crack them at each joint carefully, and split the tail down the middle with a sharp knife ; place the body upright in the centre of a dish on a napkin, and arrange the tail and claws on each side. Garnish it with double parsley. To Choose Crabs. 102. The heaviest crabs are usually con- sidered the best, although those of a mid- dling size are the sweetest, when perfectly fresh, and in perfection. The shell, whether alive or dead, should be of a brign- red colour, and the joints of the legs stiff. Crabs are stale when the eyes look dull. They are boiled in the same manner as lobsters, but require a much longer time, and are usually eaten cold. To Dress Boiled Crabs. 103. Empty the large shell; mix the flesh with a very little oil, vinegar, salt, white pepper, and Cayenne to your taste, replace the meat in the large shell, and place it in the dish with the claws as represented in the engraving. Scalloped Oysters. Time, a quarter of an hour. 104. Three dozen oysters ; grated bread- crumbs about a large teacupful; two ounces of fresh butter ; pepper. Butter some tin scallop shells, or if you have not any, a small tart dish. Strew in a layer of grated bread, then put some thin slices of butter, then oysters enough to fill your shells or dish. Cover them thickly with bread-crumbs, again add slices of butter. Pepper the whole well, add a little of the liquor kept from the oysters. Put butter over the whole surface, and bake in a quick oven. Serve them in their shells or in the dish. Brown them with a salamander. If you have not one, make the kitchen shovel red- hot and hold it over closely enough to brown your scallops. To Stew Oysters Plain. Time, three or four minutes. 105. Three dozen oysters ; thin melted butter ; a blade of mace ; twenty pepper corns. Open the oysters, cut off the beards and wash them in their own liquor to remove the grit. Strain it into a small stewpan, add a little thin melted butter to thicken it, a blade of mace, and twenty pepper corns tied up in muslin. Let the oysters simmer in this sauce for about three or four minutes, taking care they do not boil. Serve with sippets of bread. Oyster Fritters. Time, five or six minutes. 106. Some good-sized oysters ; four whole eggs ; a tablespoonful of milk ; salt and pepper ; crumbs. Beard some good-sized oysters, make a thick omelet batter with four eggs and a tablespoonful of milk, dip each oyster into the batter, and then into grated bread, fry them a nice colour, and use them to garnish fried fish. Scallop Fish, or St. James’s Cockle. Time, half an hour. 107. Scallops ; bread crumbs ; pepper; salt; a sprig of minced parsley; flour ; a spoonful of lemon pickle. Open the scallops with a knife, and take4 8 Prawns—Cockles them out as you would oysters ; cover them with beaten egg and bread-crumbs, well seasoned with pepper, salt, and minced parsley, and fry them nicely. Put them to keep hot, dredge flour into the frying-pan to take up the grease, mix in water enough for gravy, season with pepper and salt, thicken it if required, make the scallops hot in it, and serve them with the gravy together. Lemon pickle may be added. They may also be floured and fried ; and then stewed. To Boil and Serve Prawns. Time, ten minutes. io3. Prawns ; strong salt and water ; one large China orange ; sprigs of double parsley. Boil your prawns for ten minutes in a stewpan of boiling salt and water, and then drain them dry. Put a large China orange into the centre of a dish, and stick the prawns thickly over it, commencing at the bottom, with their backs upwards. At the top place three with the backs down, and a sprig of double parsley arranged between them and at the edge of your dish. To Boil Cockles and Periwinkles. iog. Put them in a stewpan, with only a small quantity of water, to prevent the pan from burning ; when the shells open, the fish will be done. To Pickle Cockles. no. Equal quantities of vinegar ; with the liquor from the cockles ; one blade of mace ; and some salt. Wash your cockles clean, and put them in a stewpan, cover them close; set them over the fire, and shake them till the shells open, then take them out ; let the liquor settle till it is clear ; then add an equal quantity of wine and vinegar, a little salt, and a blade of mace. Boil this pickle and pour it over your cockles ; put them in jars or bottles, and cover them close. To Stew Mussels. Time, ten minutes. in. One pint of mussels; half a pint of liquor ; one blade of mace; a small piece of butter rolled in flour. Clean the shells thoroughly with repeated washings, and cook them until they open, as mentioned above. Pick them out of the shells, and as you do so save the liquor that runs from them, and pick out from each one the little hairy appendage to be found at the root of the little member shaped like a tongue. To the mussels, thus prepared, put half a pint of the liquor saved, and if there is not enough of it, eke out the quantity Mussels—Herrings. with a little of the liquor in which they were boiled, poured off clear. Put in a blade of mace, thicken it with a piece of butter rolled in flour, let them stew gently for a few minutes, and serve them on toast. To Boil Herrings. Time, twenty minutes. In season from May to October. 112. Some scraped horseradish ; vinegar, and salt. Clean and wash the fish ; dry them in a cloth, and rub over them a little vinegar and salt. Skewer them with their tails in their mouths, lay them on a strainer in a stewpan, and when the water boils put them in, and let them continue simmering slowly for about twenty minutes. When they are done, drain and place them in the dish with the heads turned into the centre, garnish with scraped horseradish, and serve with parsley and butter sauce. To Bake Herrings. Time, one hour. 113. Two herrings ; a large spoonful of pepper ; twelve cloves ; a teaspoonful of salt ; two bay-leaves, and some vinegar. Clean and wash the herrings, lay them on a dish or board, and rub well over and into them a spoonful of pepper, one of salt, and twelve cloves pounded. Lay them in an earthen pan, cover them with vinegar, add two or three bay-leaves, and tie them over with a thick paper. Put them into a moderate oven, and bake them for an hour. To be eaten cold. To Dress Red Herrings, or “Yarmouth Bloaters.” 114. Choose those that are large and moist, split them open without any soaking, and either place them on a gridiron over a slow cinder fire, or hang them on the hooks of a cheese-toaster to brown. If they have hard roes, open them and put pieces of butter into the fish, closing them up to melt the butter. Fried Herrings. Time, six or eight minutes. 115. Clean and scale the fish, and dry them thoroughly in a cloth. When they are quite dry, fry them to a bright colour. Tlie herring, being so rich a fish, should be fried with less butter than fish of most kinds, and well drained, and dried afterwards. A nice sauce to eat with herrings is sugar, mustard, and a little salt and vinegar. Some serve melted butter, but herrings are too rich to eat with a rich sauce. Crisp parsley may be used as a garnisk. Fry sprats inSoups* 49 the same way ; they require no sauce, unless it may be a little lemon pickle or ketchup. Baked Gurnets. Time, thirty or forty minutes. 116. Two gurnets ; two or three slices of bacon ; one onion ; half a pint of melted butter ; two tablespoonfuls of Harvey sauce. Stuff the gurnets with veal stuffing, sew them up with packthread, and put the tail round the fish's mouth, as you do the whit- ing or haddock. Put them in a baking dish, cover them with thin slices of bacon, and bake in a hot oven for about half an hour, or longer if they are large fish. When done, put them on a dish, and serve with sauce over them, made of the onion, melted butter, and Harvey sauce. Fish Cake of Cold Fish. Time, two hours. 117. The remains of any cold fish; as cod ; soles ; turbot, &c. ; a bunch of sweet herbs ; bread-crumbs ; cold potatoes; a sprig of parsley ; one or two eggs ; pepper and salt; quite half a pint of water. Pick the meat from the fish with two forks, and mince it very fine ; mix it well with equal quantities of bread-crumbs and cold mashed potatoes, and season it highly with pepper and salt. Put the bones, heads, and trimmings of the fish into a stewpan, with the sweet herbs, parsley, and a little pepper and salt; pour over it about a pint of water, and let it simmer slowly for an hour and three-quarters, or longer if not done enough. Make the minced fish, bread, and potatoes into a cake, binding it with the white of a beaten egg ; brusli it over with the yolk, strew it well with bread- crumbs, and fry it lightly. Pour over it the strained gravy, and set it over a gentle fire to stew slowly for nearly twenty minutes, stirring it occasionally. Garnish it with slices of lemon. SOUPS. The cook who would succeed in sending good soup to table must take care that she has strong and excellent stock ready for it, and the economical housewife will soon find that stock does not always require meat to be bought for its production. The water in which mutton has been boiled, the liquor left from dressing a calf's head, the bones taken from rolled ribs of beef, or from any boned joint, hare or poultry, will make excellent stock for a family soup. Fish bones will also produce a good jelly for it. The trimmings of large joints or cutlets, the shanks of mutton, the shank of a ham, the large bone of the sirloin of beef, will all add to the stock-pot, and supply a good foundation for her soup. Ox- cheek carefully managed, and sheep's head and trotters, also make excellent stock with a flavouring of ham or anchovy for the soup. Soup should never be made with hard water, unless it is of green peas, in which case the water must be hard to preserve their coloui. The rule as to quantity is : a quart of water to a pound of meat without bone ; but whenever this quantity of water is diminished the soup is increased in strength and rich- ness. Meat should be put into the soup-kettle with very little water at first, and with a piece of butter to keep it from burning. It should be let stew very slowly till the es- sence of the meat is extracted. Very long, very slow stewing, is the certain way to pro- cure good soup. “ The more haste the worst speed " is the proverb of the soup-kettle. Skim the soup frequently also, and do not let it cool until it is quite made. Let the meat of which your soup is made be freshly killed, and very lean, every particle of fat should be removed from it. Onions should be put in the soup soon after it is begun to be made ; herbs, carrots, and celery, three hours afterwards ; turnips, or any delicate vegetable, just before the soup is finished. When celery is out of season, the seeds of the plant, tied up in a piece of clean muslin, will give the flavour equally well. To Colour Soups. A piece of bread toasted very brown may be simmered in the soup for a short time before it is done, and will give it a brown colour. The ordinary colouring, however, is done by putting a little burnt brown sugar into it. The sugar should be put into a saucepan with a piece of butter the size of a walnut, and a glass of ketchup ; it should be melted together, and then put into the soup-kettle. For those who do not dislike them, burnt onions are an improvement, both as to colour and flavour. Colouring to be kept for use is made thus : a gill of water, a quarter of a pound of lump sugar, and half an ounce of roll butter, should be set over the fire in the smallest frying-pan and stirred till it is of a bright brown colour ; add to it half a pint of water, boil and skim it, let it get cold, and then bottle and cork it down for future use. The flavouring of soups must in a great measure depend on the cook ; her taste, therefore, should be discriminating and5° Clear Stock for Soups. delicate. She should be careful in the use of ketchups and sauces, though they are both useful and important. Cow-heel, calfs-feet, and ox-tail soups, all require flavouring, and will bear a little sauce or ketchup, but it should never be over-done. Clear soups have been the fashion of late years ; furies, such as pea-soup, &c., being not so often seen, except at old fashioned people’s tables. To clarify soup break an egg, and throw the white and the shell to- gether into a basin, but take care not to let a particle of the yolk go in. Beat the white well to a stiff froth, and mix it by degrees, and very completely with the soup, which should then be put on the fire and stirred till it again boils. Take it off the moment it boils, cover it close, and let it stand for a quarter of an hour ; then strain it off. When the soup is clarified it will bear a stronger flavouring, as it loses a portion of its own in the process. Force- meat balls and whole eggs are sometimes put into soups, but they are not as fashion- able as they used to be. Take care that the soup-kettle or stewpan is perfectly clean and free from any grease or sand. An iron soup-pot should be washed the moment you have finished using it, with apiece of soda the size of a small nut- meg, dissolved in hot water, to remove all greasiness or taste of onion. A teaspoonful of potash will answer the same purpose. Do not uncover the soup-kettle more fre- quently than necessary for skimming it clean; but if your soup is too weak, do not cover the pot in boiling, as the water will evaporate in steam and leave your liquor stronger. Skim frequently ; it is important that every portion of scum should be removed from the soup. Pour in occasionally a little cold water, which will cause the albumen to rise in abundant scum, or if you put in the re- quired quantity of salt with the meat it will cause the scum to rise ; but the cup of fresh water is much the better mode of helping the soup to clear itself. Always stir your soup with a wooden spoon. Let the soup be quite free from scum be- fore the vegetables are put in. It will take six or eight hours to extract the essence from a few pounds of beef. It is better to make your soup the day before it is required, because then the fat will cake at the top of it and can be easily taken off, and you can judge of the goodness of your soup by the consistency and firm- ness of the jelly. The water in which meat or fowls have been boiled will make good broth, but for soup add a little gravy beef to it. Vegetables to be added to soup should be well cleaned, washed, and picked. It is very difficult to give a perfect mea- surement of seasoning, as the taste of people differs considerably with regard to it, and the cook must conform to that which suits the palates of her employers ; but in a rough way, it is usual to add about a tea- spoonful of salt to a pound of meat, and pepper according to taste, some naturally insipid broths and soups requiring more ; very savoury soups less. It is better to season too little than too highly. P ut fresh meat into cold water to stew' for soup. If you make soup of already cooked meat, pour hot, but not boiling water over it. Time and attention are required to achieve a good soup. Clear Stock for Soups. Time, six hours and a half. 118. Six or seven pounds of knuckle of veal or beef; half a pound of lean ham or bacon ; a quarter of a pound of butter ; salt; two onions ; one carrot; one turnip ; half of a head of celery; two gallons of water. Cut fresh meat and ham into very small pieces, and put them into a stewpan, which has been rubbed over with a quarter of a pound of butter; add half a pint of water, the salt, onions, turnip, carrot, and celery cut into slices ; cover the stew- pan, and place it over a very quick fire, until the bottom of the pan is glazed, but stirring it round frequently to prevent its burning. Then pour in the two gallons of water, and when on the point of boiling, draw it to the side of the fire to simmer for six hours and a half, or seven hours if the stock is made of beef ; skim it thoroughly, and when done pass it through a very fine sieve for use. A little browning or gravy must be used to colour it. General Stock-Pot. 119. Stock, in its composition, is not con- fined to the above proportions, any meat or bones are useful ; pieces of beef, from any part from which gravy can be extracted ; bones, skin, brisket, or tops of ribs, ox- cheek, pieces of mutton, bacon, ham, and trimmings of turkeys, fowls, veal, &c.; and also of hare, pheasant, if they are old and fit for no other purpose ; in fact, anything that will become a jelly, will assist in mak- ing stock ; to this medley of ingredients add carrots cut into slices, herbs, onions, pepper, salt, spice, &c. ; and when all have stewed until the stock is of a rich consistency, take it from the fire and pour it out to cool.5i Stocks for Soups. When cold, all the fat must be taken off, and it must be poured clear from the sedi- ment. When the soup is required to be very rich, the jelly from a cow-heel, or a lump of butter rolled in flour, must be added to the stock. The stock-pot should never be suffered to be empty, as almost any meats, (save salt meats) or fowls make stock ; the remnants should never be thrown anywhere but into the stock-pot, and should too much stock be already in vour possession, boil it down to a glaze ; waste is thus avoided. Medium Stock. Time, five hours and a half. 120. Four pounds of shin or gravy beef; two pounds of bones ; five ounces of lean bacon or ham bone ; two ounces of butter ; one large onion ; five cloves; one turnip ; two carrots ; a bunch of savoury herbs ; one head of celery ; pepper and salt; five pints of water. Put about two ounces of butter into a stewpan, then add the beef and bacon cut into very small pieces, the bones, and any trimmings of meat, &c., that you may have ; one onion stuck with fine cloves, a turnip, carrots, herbs, seasoning of pepper and salt, and a head of celery cut into pieces about three inches long; pour in about three- quarters of a pint of water ; cover the pan, and place it over a quick fire until the bottom of it is covered with a glaze ; taking care to stir it frequently. Then pour in the re- mainder of the water, and let it simmer slowly for about five hours ; skim it very clean whilst boiling, and when done, strain it through a very fine sieve, and it will be fit for use. Cheap Stock. Time, six hours. 121. Three or four quarts of the liquor in which mutton or beef has been boiled ; any bones of dressed meat; trimmings of poul- try, meat, &-c. ; two large onions ; five cloves ; pepper and salt to taste ; one tur- nip ; two carrots ; a head of celery; a bunch of savoury herbs ; a sprig of parsley; two blades of mace. Put any bones of roast beef, trimmings of meat, and poultry into a stewpan; add a head of celery cut into pieces, two onions stuck with cloves, a turnip, carrot, savoury herbs, with a sprig of parsley, two blades of mace, a few pepper corns, and a little pepper and salt ; pour in four quarts of the liquor in which any meat has been boiled ; set it over a slow fire, and let it simmer gently for quite six hours. Remove all the scum the moment it rises, and continue to do so until the stock is clear; then strain it through a fine hair sieve, and it will be fit for use. Bone Stock for Soup. Time, two to three hours. 122. Bones of any meat which has been dressed, as sirloin bone, leg of mutton bone, &c. &c. ; two scraped carrots ; one stick of celery ; enough cold water to cover the bones, or enough of the liquor left from braising meat to cover them ; one spoonful of salt. Break the bones into very small pieces, put them into a stewpan with the carrots and celery; cover them with cold water, or cold braise liquor ; and let it boil quickly till the scum rises ; skim it off and throw in some cold water, when the scum will rise again. This must be done two or three times, till the stock is quite clear ; then draw the pan from the fire and let it stew for two hours, till all the goodness is extracted from the bones. Strain it off and let it stand all night. The next day take off the grease very carefully, not leaving the least atom on it, and lift it from the sediment at the bottom of the pan. It will then be fit for use. To Clarify Stock or Soups. 123. The whites of two eggs to about four quarts of slock or soup ; two pints and a half of cold water. Whisk the whites of two very fresh eggs with half a pint of water for ten minutes ; then pour in very gently the four quarts of boiling stock or soup ; whisking it all the time. Place the stewpan over the fire; skim it clear; and when on the point of boiling whisk it all well together ; then draw it to the side, and let it settle till the whites of the eggs become separated. Strain it through a fine cloth placed over a sieve, and it will be clear and good. Plain Beef Soup. Time, four hours and a half. 124. Five pounds of the leg or shin of beef; one gallon of water ; a tsaspoonful of salt ; two heads of celery; five carrots; three onions ; four turnips ; two tomatoes, and a bunch of sweet herbs. Cut about five pounds of a leg or shin of beef into two or three pieces, and put them into a stewpan with a gallon of water and a teaspoonful of salt. Let them boil slowly, and when the scum has risen, skim it well; place it at the corner of the stove, and let it simmer steadily, so as to continue a regular heat for about four hours, then add' tw heads of celery, and five carrots cut small, two tomatoes, three onions sliced and fried, E 2.5* Various Soups. and the sweet herbs tied Up in rhitslin. The turnips should be added half an hour before serving. If any portion of the meat is required for the table, take it from the soup about a couple of hours before dinner. Let the remainder be left in the soup, which must be strained through a,hair sieve before it is served. Soupe et Bouilli. Time, eight hours. 125. Two pounds and a half of brisket of beef; two pounds of the leg of mutton ; piece of beef; one gallon of water ; one onion ; two carrots ; two turnips ; one leek ; one head of celery ; three cloves ; a little whole pepper • one French roll ; one head of endive. Take about two pounds and a half of brisket of beef, roll it up tight, and fasten it with a piece of tape. Put it into a stewpan with two pounds of the leg of mutton, piece of beef, and a gallon of water ; let it boil slowly, skim it well, and put in an onion stuck with cloves, two carrots, two turnips, a leek, a head of celery cut into slices, with some whole pepper. Cover the stewpan close, and stew the whole very slowly for seven hours. About an hour before it is served, strain the soup quite clear from the meat. Have ready a few boiled carrots cut into wheels, some turnips cut into balls, the endive, and a little celery cut into pieces. Put these into a tureen with a roll, dried after removing the crumb. Pour the soup over these boiling hot, add a little salt and Cayenne, remove the tape from the beef, and serve it on a separate dish. A very Cheap Soup. Time, four hours. 126. One pound and a half of lean beef; six quarts of water ; three onions ; six tur- nips ; thyme ; parsley ; pepper and salt ; a half pound of rice ; one pound of potatoes ; one handful of oatmeal. Cut the beef into small pieces, and put them into a stewpan with the water, onions, and the turnips ; add a bunch of thyme and parsley, a seasoning of pepper and salt, half a pound of Patna rice, a pound of potatoes peeled and cut in quarters, and a handful of oatmeal. Let all stew for four hours, and serve. Cottage Soup Baked. Time, three or four hours. 127. A pound of meat; two onions ; two carrots ; two ounces of rice ; a pint of whole peas ; pepper and salt ; a gallon of water. Cut the meat into slices, put one or two at the bottom of an earthen jar or pan, lay on it the onions sliced, then put meat again, then the carrots sliced. Soak the pint of peas all the previous night, put them in with one gallon of water. Tie the jar down, and put it in a hot oven for three or four hours. Poor Man’s Soup. Time, one hour and ten minutes. 128. Two quarts of water ; four spoonfuls of beef dripping ; an ounce and a half of butter ; a pint basinful of raw potatoes ; a young cabbage ; a little salt. Put two quarts of water in a stewpan, and when boiling throw in four spoonfuls of beef dripping and an ounce and a half of butter, a pint basinful of raw potatoes sliced, and let them boil one hour. Pick a young cab- bage, leaf by leaf, or the heart of a white cabbage, but do not chop it small, throw it in and let it boil ten minutes, or till the cab- bage be done to taste, though when boiled fast and green it eats much better. Season it with a little salt, and pour it over thin slices of bread in a tureen. A French Receipt. Pot-au-Feu. Time, three hours. 129. Three quarts of water ; four pounds of meat ; two teaspoonfuls of salt; three small carrots ; three middling-sized onions (one being stuck with two cloves) ; a head of celery ; a bunch of thyme ; a bay-leaf, and a little parsley, tied together ; two tur- nips ; a burnt onion, or a little browning. Put the meat into a stock-pot full of water, set it over a slow fire, and let it gently boil, carefully taking off the scum that will rise to the top. Pour in a tea- cupful of cold water to help the scum to rise. When no more scum rises, it is time to put in the vegetables, which you should have ready washed and prepared. Cut the carrots in slices, stick the onions with cloves, cut the turnips each in four pieces. Put them into the pot, and let them boil gently for two hours. If the water boils away too much, add a little hot water in addition. A few bones improve the soup very much. It is not necessary to keep the pot very closely covered. It is better to raise the lid a little ; it facilitates the operation. Gravy Soup. Time, seven hours. 130. Seven pounds and a half of gravy beef; two pounds and a half of veal; two ounces of butter ; six quarts of water ; one large carrot ; one small turnip ; three onions stuck with twelve cloves; half a head of53 Soups and Broths. celery ; two blades of mace ; half an ounce of salt; a small bunch of thyme and parsley ; three lumps of sugar. Put the gravy beef and the veal into a well-tinned copper stock-pot, with two ounces of butter ; set it over a hot plate, and cover it tightly over to keep in the steam until it is properly drawn down. You will know when it is sufficiently drawn by the smell, which resembles a delicately-roasted joint, the butter frying the meat; then add the water made very hot, the carrots cut small, the onions, turnips, celery, bunch of thyme and parsley, with two blades of mace, the salt, and lumps of sugar. Half cover the stock-pot with the lid, but by no means cover it wholly, as all the steam must be allowed to evaporate, or the stock will imbibe a coarse flavour, and become thick ; let it simmer gently for seven hours, then strain it off carefully through a sieve into a pan, and heat it when required for use, adding a little salt and loaf sugar. Cock-a-Leekie. Time, three or four hours. 131. One fowl; three bunches of winter leeks ; pepper and salt ; and five quarts of medium stock. Well wash the leeks, take off part of the heads and the roots, scald them in boiling water for five or six minutes, and then cut them into small pieces. Put a fowl trussed as for boiling into a stewpan, with the pieces of leek, a little pepper and salt, and nearly five quarts of stock ; let the whole simmer very slowly at the corner of the fire for three or four hours, keeping it well skimmed. When ready to serve, take out the fowl, cut it into neat pieces, place them in a tureen, and pour the leeks and the broth over them (the leeks being made into a puffie), as the soup should be very thick of leeks. This soup is greatly improved by warming it up a second time. It will keep for some little time good. Hotch-Potch. Time, after it is made, a quarter of an hour. 132. One pint of peas ; three pounds of the lean end of a loin of mutton ; one gallon of water ; four carrots ; four turnips ; pepper and salt ; one onion ; one head of celery. Put a pint of peas into a stewpan with a quart of water, and boil them until they will pulp through a sieve. Then take the lean end of a loin of mutton, cut it into chops, put it into a stewpan with a gallon of water, the carrots and turnips cut into Small pieces, and a seasoning of pepper and salt. Boil it until all the vegetables are quite tender, put in the pulped peas and a head of celery, and an onion sliced ; let it boil fifteen minutes, and serve. Kidney Soup. Time, six hours. 133. One bullock's kidney ; three sticks of celery; three or four turnips ; three or four carrots ; a bunch of sweet herbs; pepper and salt ; a spoonful of mushroom ketchup ; the liquor in which a leg of mutton has been boiled. Add to the liquor from a boiled leg of mutton a bullock's kidney, put it over the fire, and when half done, take out the kidney, and cut it into pieces the size of dice. Add three sticks of celery, three or four turnips, and the same of carrots, all cut small, and a bunch of sweet herbs tied together. Season to your taste with pepper and salt. Let it boil slowly for five or six hours, adding the ketchup. When done take out the herbs, and serve the vegetables in the soup. It is always better (as all soups are) made the day before it is wanted. Scotch Mutton Broth in Summer. Time, three hours. 134. Nine or ten pints of water; half a pound of barley; a quarter of a peck of green peas ; one small turnip; two carrots ; a little parsley; one onion ; four pounds of mutton ; one teaspoonful of salt; one of pepper. Cut into small pieces the turnip, carrot, and onion (after well washing them), and put the meat in first. Skim the pot till no more scum rises, then add the vegetables. Any one of the vegetables may be omitted, except the green peas. Scotch Barley Broth. Time, two hours. 135. Six pounds of flank of beef; six quarts of water ; a quarter of a pound of barley ; three heads of celery ; a bunch of sweet herbs ; a small onion ; two carrots ; two turnips ; and a little chopped parsley. Take six pounds of the thick flank of beef, and cover it with six quarts of water, and a quarter of a pound of barley ; boil it gently for an hour, skimming it frequently. Then add three heads of celery, two carrots, two turnips cut into pieces, one onion, a bunch of sweet herbs, and a little parsley ; boil all together till you find the broth very good. Season it with salt. Then take out the beef, the onion, and sweet herbs ; pour the broth into the tureen, and put the beef in a dish garnished with carrots and turnips,54 Scotch Mutton Broth—Ox-head and Ox-tail Soups. Scotch Mutton Broth. Time, three hours and a half. 136. Six pounds of neck of mutton ; three quarts of water ; five carrots ; five turnips ; two onions ; four tablespoonfuls of Scotch barley ; and a little salt. Soak a neck of mutton in water for an hour, cut off the scrag, and put it into a stewpan with three quarts of water. As soon as it boils skim it well, and then simmer it for an hour and a half. Cut the best end of the mutton into cutlets, dividing it with two bones in each. Take off nearly all the fat before you put it into the broth ; skim it the moment the meat boils, and every ten minutes afterwards ; add five carrots, five turnips, and two onions, all cut into two or three pieces ; and put them into the soup soon enough to be thoroughly done ; stir in four tablespoonfuls of Scotch barley well washed in cold water; add salt to your taste ; and let alt stew together for three hours ; about half an hour before sending to table put in a little chopped parsley, and serve all together. Ox-Head Soup. Time, four or five hours. 137. One ox-head ; one head of celery ; two carrots ; two onions ; one turnip ; thirty black pepper corns ; twenty-five of allspice ; a teaspooriful of salt; a bunch of sweet herbs ; a bay-leaf; a little browning ; a glass of white wine; and five quarts of water. After the head has been soaked for two or three hours, the bones must be broken, and the whole well washed in warm water ; then put it into a stewpan with five quarts of cold water, cover it closely over, and as it boils, which should be slowly, skim it well. Put in a head of celery cut into pieces, two carrots, two onions, one turnip, the pepper corns, and allspice, with a bunch of sweet herbs. Cover it over, and set the pan over a slow fire, taking care to remove the scum, and let it stew gently for three hours, or until reduced to four quarts. Take out the head and put it on a dish. Strain the soup through a fine sieve, and set it by to cool. The next day cut the meat from the head into small pieces, drain off the liquor, and after removing the fat, put it with the meat into a stewpan, and let it simmer gently for half an hour, when it will be ready to serve. The oftener this soup is warmed the richer it becomes. Before sending it to table add a glass of white wine. Ox-Tail Soup. Time, four hours and a half. 138. Two ox-tails ; a quarter of a pound of lean ham ; a head and a half of celery ; two carrots ; two turnips ; two onions ; a bunch of savoury herbs ; five cloves ; a tea- spoonful of pepper corns ; one bay-leaf ; a wineglass of ketchup, and one of port wine, with three quarts of water.

Wash the parsley thoroughly, boil it for six or seven minutes till tender, then press the water well out of it ; chop it very fine ; make half or a quarter of a pint of melted butter as required (the less butter the less parsley, of course), mix it gradually with the hot melted butter. Imitation Parsley Sauce. When parsley is not to be procured. Time, ten minutes. 163. Half a pint of melted butter; one small teaspoonful of parsley seed ; a little salt. Tie a little parsley seed up in a clean piece of muslin, and boil it ten minutes in water ; use the water it has been boiled in, and which it will strongly flavour, for melting your butter instead of the pure water. You had better taste the parsley water before using it, to try whether the flavour is strong enough or too strong. When the butter is made thus, chop a little boiled spinach very fine, and add it to the butter to look like parsley. We may add here that the seeds of celery used in the like manner will give a perfect flavour of that vegetable to any gravy, soup, sauce, See., and may be used when the root cannot be procured. Au Excellent Lobster Sauce. Time, ten minutes. 164. One hen lobster with coral ; two- thirds of its weight of good cream ; one- third of fresh butter.

Boil some veiy strong clear gravy or jelly over a quick fire to the thickness of cream, stirring it constantly until it will adhere like jelly to the spoon. It must then be immediately poured out of the stewpan : the greatest care is required during the time of thickening to. prevent it from burning. When required for use, dissolve it by plac- ing the jar (or whatever it may be kept in) in boiling water, and brushing it over the meat two or three times, when it will form a clear varnish. Any kind of very rich stock can be boiled down to a glaze. To be used for hams, tongues, &c. To Brown Flour. Time, five minutes. 171.

Then put it in a wire basket, and hold it in boiling dripping for two minutes. Take it out of the basket and dry it well before the fire that it may become very crisp. The dripping in which it is fried should be quite boiling. If the cook possess no wire basket, she must fry the parsley as quickly as possible, and dry it before the fire when it is done.

The next day strain off the liquor, measure and boil it for a quarter of an hour. To each quart of liquor add one ounce of pepper, a quarter of an ounce of allspice, half an ounce of ginger, and two blades of mace, and let it boil quickly for nearly half an hour.

Two dozen and a half of lemons ; four ounces of garlic ; one handful of horse- radish ; one gallon of vinegar ; one ounce of mace ; half an ounce of cloves ; one ounce of nutmeg ; half an ounce of Cayenne ; half a pint of mustard seed. Grate off the outer rinds of the lemons with a piece of glass, cut them across but do not quite separate them; work in as much salt as you can with the fingers ; spread them on a large pewter dish, and cover them quite over with salt ; then put them into a cool oven three or four times, until the juice is dried into the peels ; they must be hard but not burned. Then put to them the garlic peeled, the horseradish sliced, and again place them in the oven till there is no moisture left. As the salt dis- solves work in more. Put the vinegar into a stewpan with the cloves pounded, the mace beaten fine, the nutmeg cut into slices, and the Cayenne and mustard slightly bruised, and tied in a muslin bag. Boil all these ingredients with the vinegar, and pour it boiling hot on the lemons. The jar must be well closed, and let stand by the fire for six days, shaking it well every day. Then tie it down and let it stand for three months to take off the bitterness. When it is bottled, the pickle must be put into a hair or lawn sieve two or three times, till it is as fine as possible. After the lemon pickle is cleared off, add about one quart of boiled vinegar to the remaining ingredients, and after it has stood for some time it is excellent for hashes, &c. &c. This pickle may be put into white sauce, one spoonful being sufficient; two spoon- fuls for brown sauce. It is also good for fish, fowls, or any made dish, care always being taken to put it in before the sauce is mixed with cream, or the acid may curdle it. Nasturtiums used as Capers. 2or. Besides being great ornaments to our flower-gardens, nasturtiums supply us with a useful adjunct to frugal tables. They save the expense of capers. Gather the seeds (“cheeses” country children call them) of the nasturtiums, and keep them a few days on a paper tray ; then put them into empty pickle bottles, pour boiling vinegar over them, and leave them to cool. When cold, cover them closely down. They will be fit to eat the next summer in lieu of capers, with boiled mutton. To Make Vinegar. Time, a quarter of an hour to boil. 202. To one pound of coarse sugar one gallon of water ; a piece of toasted bread ; two tablespoonfuls of yeast. Mix the sugar and water well together and boil it for a quarter of an hour, skim- ming it well all the time. Then put the liquor in a cup. When it is about new milk warm, toast apiece of bread, wet it well with yeast, and put it in the liquor. Next day pour it into a clean cask and set it in64 Beef. a warm place. Lay a paper over the bung- hole to keep out the dust, but do not stop it up. It will be ready for use before the end of the year, when it may be tried, and if found not quite acid enough it must stand longer. When it is settled and can be bottled off make the same quantity again, as a seasoned barrel is a great help. Ketchup for Fish, or Elderberry Soy. 203. One quart of elderberries ; one quart of vinegar ; a quarter of a pound of ancho- vies ; a blade of mace ; a little ginger, salt, and whole peppers. Pour a quart of boiling vinegar over a quart of elderberries picked from the stalks, and set it in a cool oven all night; then strain the liquor from the berries, and boil it up with the mace; ginger, salt, whole peppers, and the anchovies, until they are dissolved. When cold, put it into bottles after it has been strained, and cork it down. Some prefer the spice put into the bottles ; but either way it is a good and not expensive soy. BEEF. To Make Tough Meat Tender. 204. Soak it in vinegar and water; if a very large piece, for about twelve hours. For ten pounds of beef use three quarts of water to three-quarters of a pint of vine- gar, and soak it for six or seven hours. Sirloin of Beef. Time, a quarter of an hour to each pound of meat. 205. Make up a good fire ; spit or hang the joint evenly, at about eighteen inches from it. Put a little clarified dripping in the dripping-pan, and baste the joint well as soon as it is put down to dress ; baste again every quarter of an hour till about twenty minutes before it is done ; then stir the fire and make it clear ; sprinkle a little salt, and dredge a little flour over the meat, turn it again till it is brown and frothed. Take it from the spit, put it on a hot dish, and pour over it some good made gravy, or mix the gravy left at the bottom of the dripping-pan with a little hot water and pour it over it. Garnish with fine scrapings of horseradish in little heaps, as in engrav- ing. Serve Yorkshire pudding with it on a separate dish. Sauce: horseradish. Bibs of Beef Rolled. Time, twenty minutes to the pound, or fif- teen minutes, and half an hour over. 206. Order the butcher to take out the bones of the joint; roll it into a round, and fasten it with skewers and a broad piece of tape in the shape of a round. Place it at the distance of eighteen inches before a large fire till it is partly dressed ; then move it gradually forward towards the fire. Put some clarified dripping in the pan ; baste it the moment the dripping melts, and do the same every quarter of an hour. Just before it is done—i.c., about twenty minutes before you remove it from the spit, dredge it with flour, and baste it with a little butter. Re- move the tape and skewer, and fasten it with a silver skewer instead. Serve with good gravy over it. Horseradish sauce. To Boil Beef. Reckon the time from the water coming to a boil. 207. Keep the pot boiling, but let it boil very slowly. If you let the pot cease boiling, you will be deceived in your time ; therefore watch that it does not stop, and keep up a sufficiently good fire. Just before the pot boils the scum rises. Be sure to skim it off carefully, or it will fall back and adhere to the meat, and disfigure it sadly. When you have well skimmed the pot, put in a little cold water, which will cause the. scum to rise again. The more carefully you skim, the cleaner and nicer the meat boiled will look. Put your meat into cold water. Liebig, the great German chemist, advises us to plunge the joint into boiling water, but the great cook Francatelli, and others of the same high standing, recommend cold ; and our own experience and practice are in accordance with the cook rather than the chemist. Put a quart of cold water to every pound of meat. Allow twenty minutes to the pound from the time the pot boils and the scum rises. It is more profitable to boil than to roast meat. Aitchbone of Beef. Time, twenty minutes to the pound. 208. Three-quarters of a pound of salt ; one ounce of moist sugar; aitchbone weighing ten pounds ; two gallons and a half of water. Dry the salt and rub it with the sugar in a mortar, then rub it well into the aitchbone of beef. Turn the joint and rub in some pickle every day for four or five days. Wash it well before you boil it. Put it into a large boiling pot, so as to let it be well surrounded and covered with cold water in the above proportion, set the pot on one side of the fire to boil gently ; if it boils fast at first nothing can prevent the meat .1.

The soft fat which lies on the back of an aitchbone of beef is delicious when hot; the hard fat is best cold. Save the liquor in which this joint is boiled for pea-soup. Garnish with slices of turnip and carrot, as in engraving. Silverside of Beef Boiled. Time, a quarter of an hour to each pound. 209. Ten or twelve pounds of the silver- side of beef; three gallons of water. After the beef has been in the pickle for about nine or ten days, take it out and wash it in water, skewer it up in a round form, and bind it with a piece of tape. Put it into a large stewpan of water, and when it boils remove the scum very carefully, or it will sink and spoil the appearance of the meat. Then draw the saucepan to one side of the fire, and let it simmer slowly until done. When ready to serve, draw out the skewers and replace them with a silver one. Pour over it a little of the liquor in which it has been boiled, and garnish with boiled carrots and parsnips. When taken from the water, trim off any soiled parts from the beef before sending it to table. A Beef Stew. Time, two hours and twenty minutes. 210. Two or three pounds of the rump of beef; one quart of broth ; pepper and salt; the peel of one large lemon, and the juicre; • two tablespoonfuls of Harvey sauce; one spoonful of flour ; a little ketchup. Cut away all the skin and fat from two or three pounds of the rump of beef, and divide it into pieces about two or three inches square ; put it into a stewpan, and pour on it a quart of broth ; then let it boil, and sprinkle in pepper and salt to taste. When it has boiled very gently, or simmered two hours, shred finely the peel of a large lemon, and add it to the gravy. In twenty minutes pour in a flavouring, composed of two spoonfuls of Harvey sauce, the juice of the lemon, the flour, and a little ketchup. Add at pleasure a glass of sherry, a quarter of an hour after flavouring it, and serve. Stewed Shin of Beef—A Family Dish. Time, four hours and a quarter. 211. A shin of beef; one bunch of sweet herbs ; one large onion ; one head of celery; twelve black pepper corns ; twelve allspice ; three carrots ; two turnips ; twelve small button onions. Saw the bone into three or four pieces ; put them into a stewpan, and just cover them with cold water. When the pot simmers, skim it clean ; and then add the sweet herbs, onion, celery, peppers and allspice. Stew it very gently over a slow fire till the meat is tender. Then peel the carrots and turnips and cut them into shapes; boil them with the button onions till tender. The turnips and onions will take a quarter of an hour to boil, the carrots half an hour. Drain them carefully. Put the meat when done on a dish, and keep it warm while you prepare some gravy thus: (*•<?•) Take a teacupful of the liquor in which the meat has been stewed, and mix with it three tablespoonfuls of flour ; add more liquor till you have a pint and a half of gravy. Season with pepper, salt, and a wineglass of mushroom ketchup. Boil it up, skim off the fat, and strain it through a sieve. Pour it over the meat, and lay the vegetables round it. Beef Olives. Time to stew, one hour and a half. 212. A pound and a half of rumpsteak ; three yolks of eggs ; a little beaten mace ; pepper and salt; a teacupful of bread- crumbs ; two ounces of marrow or suet; a sprig of parsley ; the rind of half a lemon ; one pint of brown gravy ; a tablespoonful of ketchup ; one of browning; a teaspoonful of lemon vinegar ; a piece of butter rolled in flour ; eight forcemeat balls. Cut the steak into slices of about half an inch thick and six or seven inches long, rub them over with the yolk of a beaten egg, and strew thickly over them some bread- crumbs, the marrow or suet chopped fine, then the parsley minced, the grated rind of half a large lemon, a little beaten mace, and some pepper and salt, all mixed well together. Roll each olive round, fasten it with a small skewer, and brow'n them lightly before the fire in a Dutch oven. Then put them into a stewpan with the gravy, ketchup, browning, and lemon vinegar, thicken it with a piece of butter rolled in flour, and serve the olives in the gravy. Garnish with force- meat balls. Fillets de Boeuf. Time, to fry, eight minutes. 213. The wider-cut of a large sirloin of beef; two ounces of butter; a teacupful of rich gravy ; one tablespoonful of Espag- nole sauce ; pepper and salt; one squeeze of lemon juice to taste. Take every morsel of skin and sinews from a large piece of under-cut of sirloin of beef, cut it into small slices of about a F66 Ox-chcck and Ox-Tongue. quarter of an inch thick each, flatten them and give them a round form. Melt some butter in a sautd-pan, lay the fillets in it, and season them with pepper and salt. Just before you send them to table, put the pan over a good fire and dress them quickly. Turn them the moment you see a little gravy bubble up, on their surface. They are done when, on pressing them, you find they resist the fork. Place them in a small pile on a dish, or round a little heap of mashed potatoes. Pour a little gravy into the saute-pan to detach the glaze formed at the bottom of it, add a table- spoonful of Espagnole or any other sauce, reduce this gravy a little over the fire, and serve with a squeeze of lemon juice. Or instead of lemon juice, add to the sauce a few fried mushrooms. Or beat into the Espagnole sauce and gravy a piece of anchovy butter about the size of a walnut. Or the centre may be filled with tomato sauce. We must beg our lady readers who are obliged to keep house economically, not to be frightened at the idea of having fillets de bceuf (which are seldom seen in middle- class houses), at their table. A little ordi- nary care, attention, and practice will enable a tolerable cook to do them well, and they are especially nice dishes. Moreover, they give two fresh dishes from one joint. Use the under-cut of the sirloin, we will say, for example, on the Saturday for fillets de boeuf, and you have your sirloin still ready for the spit on Sunday. It is true that for them you must have a tolerably large joint, but in a large family a good-sized joint is economical, because it wastes less by drying up in cooking. For small families a small dish of fillets de boeuf may be made from a joint weighing ten pounds or even less. Ox.cheek Stewed. Time, seven hours altogether. 214. Half an ox-head ; a bunch of sweet herbs ; one head of celery ; some pepper and salt; one small onion ; one glass of port wine ; four cloves ; three pints and a half of water. Well wash part of an ox-head, and let it soak in cold water for several hours ; then put it into a stewpan with a bunch of sweet herbs, a little pepper and salt, one small onion, a head of celery cut into slices, and four cloves ; pour in about three pints and a half of water—or rather more, and set it over a gentle fire to simmer slowly. When tender, take out the head, and cut the meat from it in rather small pieces ; strain the gravy and put about the third part of it into a stewpan with a glass of port wine, some forcemeat balls, and the pieces of head. Make all very hot and serve it up quickly. To Dress a Bullock’s Heart. Time, two hours. 215. One heart; veal stuffing ; half a pint of rich gravy. Soak a bullock s heart for three hours in warm water ; remove the lobes, and stuff the inside with veal forcemeat ; sew it securely in ; fasten some white paper over the heart, and roast it for two hours before a strong fire, keeping it basted frequently. Just before serving, remove the paper, baste and froth it up, and serve with a rich gravy poured round it, and currant jelly sepa- rately. Ox-Tongue. Time, one hour to warm ; two hours and a half, if large, to simmer. 216. Choose a plump tongue with a smooth skin, which denotes the youth of the animal. If it has been salted and dried, soak it before you boil it for twenty hours in plenty of water. If it is a green one fresh from the pickle, soak it only three or four hours. Put it into cold water, let it gradually -warm for one hour ; then let it slowly simmer for two hours and a half. Plunge it into cold water in order to remove the furred skin. Bend it into a nice shape with a strong fork ; then trim and glaze it if it is to be served as a cold tongue, and ornament the root with a frill of cut paper or vegetable flowers ; when hot garnish with aspic jelly. If it is to be served hot, as an entree, it must be wrapped in a greased paper and warmed again in hot water, after removing the coating ; serve, when thus garnished, with macaroni or tomato sauce. Ox-Cheek Cheese—A homely American Receipt. Time, four hours. 217. Half an ox-head ; one teaspoonful of fine salt; half a teaspoonful of pepper ; one tablespoonful of powdered thyme ; enough water to cover the head. Split an ox-head in two, take out the eyes, crack the side bones, and lay it in water for one whole night. Then put it in a saucepan with sufficient water to cover it. Let it boil very gently, skimming it care- fully. When the meat loosens from the bones take it from the water with a skimmer, and put it into a bowl. Take out every particle of bone, chop the meat very fine, and season it with a teaspoonful of salt, and half a teaspoonful of pepper ; add a table- spoonful of powdered thyme. Tie it in a67 Spiced Beef—Broiled and Stewed Steak. s cloth and press it with a weight. When cold, it may be cut in slices for dinner or supper. The gravy remaining will make a rich broth if a few vegetables be stewed in it. Spiced Beef. Time, according to weight. 218. The thin part of the ribs of beef; half an ounce of cloves ; half an ounce of mace ; half an ounce of black pepper ; half an ounce of Jamaica pepper ; and some chopped parsley. Take the thin part of a piece of beef, after the rib piece (called the flap) has been cut off, if any of the ends of the bones are left take them out. Rub it well with salt, and let it lay in pickle two days ; then take the above quantities of spice and a little chopped parsley, and spread the whole equally over the beef; roll it up neatly and tie it very tight. Set it in a stewpan over a moderate fire, and let it stew slowly till quite tender. Then press it well, and when cold it will be fit to serve. The spices are to be laid on whole. Beef Liver for Gravy. Time, twenty-four hours. 219. The liver must be first hung up to drain; after that salt it well and leave it twenty-four hours in a dish. Then hang it up to drain, and when it has ceased drip- ping hang it in a dry place for use. It is excellent for gravy to cutlets and all made dishes. Broiled Steak. Time, eight to ten minutes. 220. Rumpstcak ; one ounce of butter ; one tablespoonful of musjiroom ketchup ; pepper and salt. Rumpsteak is best for broiling and frying ; beefsteak for stewing. Take care that the butcher cuts the steak the right thicknpess—i.e., about three- quarters or half an inch. Divide it in halves. Place the gridiron over a clear fire, and rub the. bars with suet to prevent the meat from adhering to them. Place the two steaks on it and broil them, 'turning them freqently with the steak-tongs, or if with a fork, carefully pricking it through the fat. If the steak itself is pricked, the gravy will run out, and it will harden. Have ready a hot dish on which you have placed a lump of butter the size of a large walnut, a tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup, and a little salt and pepper. Lay the steaks (rubbing them lightly over with butter) on the dish, and serve as quickly as possible. Rumpsteak Fried. Time, twenty minutes. 221. Broiling is the best mode of cooking steaks and chops ; if, however, you prefer a steak fried, do not cut it quite as thick as for broiling, and leave a little fat on it. Put some clarified dripping in the pan and let it boil ; then lay the steak in the boiling fat and fry it, moving the pan about to prevent it from burning ; when one side is well done, turn it on the other with your meat tongs—if you do not possess a pair, turn it with a fork, but take care not to stick the fork into the juicy part of the steak ; put it in the fat or in the edge of the meat. When the steak is done, lay it on a hot dish, with a little made gravy, ora lump of butter and a tablespoonful of ketchup. Season with pepper and salt. Tomato sauce is sometimes eaten with beefsteak. Steak Stewed in a Plain Way. Time, forty minutes altogether. 222. Half a pint of water ; one onion ; a spoonful of walnut ketchup ; a little caper liquor ; a piece of butter rolled in flour, and some pepper and salt. Fry the steaks in butter a good brown, then put in a stewpan half a pint of water, one onion sliced, a tablespoonful of walnut ketchup, a little caper liquor, pepper and salt. Cover the pan close, and let them stew slowly. Thicken the gravy with a piece of butter rolled in flour, and serve them on a hot dish. Beefsteak and Oysters Stewed. Time, one hour and twenty minutes. 223. A pound and a half of beefsteak ; two ounces of butter ; half a pint of water . a dozen and a half of oysters ; five dessert- spoonfuls of port wine ; pepper and salt. Put into a stewpan a pound and a half of beefsteak, with two ounces of butter and a little water; when the meat is a nice brown, pour in half a pint of water, a little pepper and salt, and the liquor strained from the oysters. Set the pan over a mode- rate fire, and let the meat stew gently ; then add five dessertspoonfuls of port wine, a piece of butter rolled in flour, and the oysters. Stew it all together till the oysters are done, and serve it up very hot. Bubble and Squeak. Time, twenty minutes. 224. About one pound of slices of cold boiled beef ; one pound of chopped potato; one pound of chopped-up cabbage—both previously boiled ; pepper, salt, and a little butter.6 8 To Fry Beef Kidncy— Strived Beef Kidney— Tripe. Chop up and fry the cold potatoes and cabbage with a little pepper, salt, and a good large piece of butter. Set it aside to keep hot. Lightly fry some slices of cold boiled beef ; put them in a hot dish, with alternate layers of vegetable, piling it higher in the middle. To Fry Beef Kidney. Time, ten or twelve minutes. 225. One kidney; three ounces of butter ; half a pint of gravy; one tablespoonful of Harvey sauce ; one lump of sugar. Take a beef kidney, cut it into slices not too thick, and let them soak in warm water for two hours and a half, changing the water twice to thoroughly cleanse the kid- ney. Dredge a very little flour over these slices, and fry them a nice brown, in about three ounces of butter, seasoning them pre- viously with pepper and salt. Arrange them in a circle, slightly leaning over each Other round the dish. Stir a tablespoonful of Harvey sauce into half a pint (or rather Jess) of good gravy, with one lump of sugar in it, and pour it into the centre of the dish. Stewed Beef Kidney. Time, half an hour. 226. A beef kidney; pepper and salt. Cut the kidney into slices, and season it highly with pepper and salt, and fry it a light brown ; then pour a little warm water into the pan, dredge in some flour, put in the slices of kidney, and let it stew very gently. Minced Beef. Time, twenty minutes. 227. One pound and a half of beef; six ounces of bacon ; two small onions ; a little pepper and nutmeg ; one ounce and a half of butter rolled in flour ; a spoonful of browning ; a few poached or hard-boiled eggs. Mince about a pound and a half of beef with the bacon and onions, seasoning it highly with pepper and nutmeg. Take a sufficient quantity of stock made from bones, and any trimmings, a piece of butter rolled in flour, and a little browning ; make it hot and strain it over the mince ; put the whole into a stewpan, let it simmer for a few minutes, and serve it on a hot dish with sippets of toasted bread, and a poached or hard-boiled egg divided and placed on each sippet arranged round the edge of the dish. It is also served surrounded by a wall of mashed potatoes, with two poached eggs lying on the top of it. Hashed Beef—Plain. Time, twenty-five minutes. 228. Some slices of cold roast beef; two tablespoonfuls of Worcestershire sauce ; one of mushroom ketchup ; and the gravy from the meat or from the bones boiled down ; pepper and salt. Put the gravy saved from the meat (with a little water if not sufficient), or the bones of the cold joint boiled down to a gravy, into a stewpan with two tablespoonfuls of Wor- cestershire sauce, one of mushroom ketchup, some pepper, salt, and a little butter rolled in flour to thicken it ; let it simmer gently for about a quarter of an hour ; take it from the fire, and when cold remove the fat. Cut the meat into slices, dredge them with flour, and lay them in the stewpan with the gravy, let it simmer slowly for ten minutes until hot, taking care jt does not boil, or the meat will be hard. Garnish with sippets of toasted bread. Tripe. Time, half an hour. 229. Two pounds of tripe; equal parts of milk and water ; four large onions. Take two pounds of fresh tripe, cleaned and dressed by the tripe-dresser, cut away the coarsest fat, and boil it from twenty minutes to half an hour in equal parts of milk and water. Boil in the same water which boils the tripe four large onions ; the onions should be put on the fire at least half an hour before the tripe is put into the stewpan, and then made into a rich onion sauce, to serve with the tripe. Tripe may also be cleaned, dried, cut into pieces, fried in batter, and served with melted butter. Tripe Roasted. Time, ten minutes. 230. Some pieces of tripe ; some force- meat; a little flour; some butter. Cut the tripe into good-sized pieces, and spread some forcemeat over them-, roll them up securely, and tie them upon a small spit, or roast them in a cradle spit ; flour and baste them with butter, and serve them up garnished with lemon in slices, and melted butter. MUTTON. Roast Haunch of Mutton. Time, a quarter of an hour to each pound of meat. 231. Take a fine haunch of Southdown, Welsh, or Devonshire mutton, hang it up69 To Roast Mutton. for ten days or a fortnight, trim off the skin which covers the fat, remove the shank bone, and cover it with two or three sheets of buttered paper, place it on a spit, or in a cradle spit; set it at about fifteen inches from the fire, and roast it for two hours very slowly to warm it through, basting it with dripping every five minutes. Draw it gra- dually nearer and nearer to the fire to brown, but take care it does not burn. Sprinkle it with a little fine salt, dredge it over with flour and baste with a little butter, which will give it a fine frothy appearance. Pour good brown gravy over it. Serve it with red currant jelly sauce. Saddle of Mutton. Time, a quarter of an hour to a pound. 232. Take off the skin, cover the fat with a sheet of well greased paper, and roast it as directed for a haunch ; just before it is finished cooking remove the paper, sprinkle the joint with salt, dredge it well over with flour, and drop warmed butter over it. Serve it with good gravy, or empty the con- tents of the dripping-pan into a basin, from which remove the fat, add a little warm water, and use this natural gravy. Red currant jelly as sauce. Leg of Mutton Roasted. Time, half an hour to the pound, slow method ; a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, ordinary time. 233. A leg of mutton intended for roast- ing can be kept much longerthan for boiling, but it must be wiped very dry, and dusted with flour and pepper. Cut oft the knuckle, remove the thick skin, and trim off the piece of flank. Put a little salt and water into the dripping-pan, and baste the joint for a short time with it, then use the gravy from the meat itself, basting it every ten minutes. Serve it with gravy poured round it, and currant jelly, separately. The wether leg of mutton is the best for roasting. A leg of mutton, if too large, can be divided, and the knuckle boiled ; or by placing a paste of flour and water over the part cut to keep in the gravy, it can be roasted, by which means two roast dinners can be had from the one joint. Boned Leg of Mutton. Time, a quarter of an hour to the pound. 234. A small leg of mutton, weighing about seven pounds ; some veal stuffing ; and some good gravy. Procure a nice small leg of mutton, and remove the bone carefully ; make a good veal forcemeat (to which about three ounces of ham or bacon must be added), and fill up the hole from whence the bone has been taken with it ; cover the skin over, and sew it neatly up to secure the forcemeat. Tie it round, and roast it for about three hours before a bright, clear fire. When it is done, remove the string, place it on a hot dish, and place round it some good brown gravy. Roast Shoulder of Mutton. Time, a quarter of an hour to each pound. 235. A shoulder of mutton should not be basted in roasting, but simply rubbed with a little butter. Put the spit in close to the shank bone, and run it along the blade bone. Roast this joint at a sharp, brisk fire. It should be well hung ; and served with onion sauce. Roast Loin of Mutton. Time, a quarter of an hour to the pound. 236. This joint is not economical on ac- count of the weight of fat attached to it ; but it is very useful in small families, as it is a joint that can be cut so as not to leave too much cold meat. London butchers gene- rally remove the fat, ready for dressing. Roast it at a bright fire, and baste carefully about every quarter of an hour. Brown and froth it as before directed, for leg, &c. To Roll a Loin of Mutton. Time, a quarter of an hour to each pound. 237. A loin of mutton ; veal forcemeat; and a tablespoonful of ketchup. Hang a loin of mutton till tender, take out the bone, and lay over the meat a stuffing made as for veal; roll it up tightly, fasten it with small skewers to keep it in shape, and tie it round with a string. Roast it before a brisk fire, allowing a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes, for each pound of meat. Make a gravy of the bones, adding to it a tablespoonful of ketchup, and a little salt. When the meat is done, pour the gravy made from the bones, mixed with the gravy from the meat, over it, and serve with currant jelly, separately. A Mode of Dressing Fillet of Mutton. Time, two hours. 238. Take off the chump end of a loin of mutton, and cover it with two sheets of buttered paper as for venison ; roast it for two hours, but do not allow it to become the least brown. Have ready some French beans, boiled tender, and well drained from the water on a sieve ; while the mutton is being glazed, warm them up in the gravy, put them on a dish, and serve the meat on them.7o To Boil and Stew Mutton. To Roast a Neck of Mutton. Time, one hour. 239. Take four pounds of the middle or the best end of a neck of mutton, trim off part of the fat, cut the bones short, and see that it is thoroughly jointed. Place it at some distance from a nice brisk fire, dredge it with flour, and baste it frequently. Just before it is done, set it nearer to the fire, and dust a little salt over it. Pour off the drip- ping, and put a little boiling water into the pan. Dish up the joint, and strain the gravy over it. Sen e it with currant jelly, separately. Mutton Kebobbed. Time, according to the weight. 240. Loin of mutton ; a small nutmeg, pepper, and salt; some bread-crumbs ; a bunch of sweet herbs ; yolks of three eggs ; half a pint of gravy ; two spoonfuls of ketchup ; a teaspoonful of flour ; two ounces of butter. Take all the fat out of a loin of mutton, and off the outside also if too fat, and re- move the skin. Joint it at every bone. Mix half a small nutmeg grated with a little pepper and salt, bread-crumbs, and minced herbs. Dip the steaks into the yolks of1 three eggs, and sprinkle the above mixture all over them. Then place the steaks to- gether as they were before they were cut asunder, tie them, and fasten them on a small spit. Roast them at a quick fire, set a dish utider, and baste them with a good piece of butter and the liquor that comes from the meat; and throw some more of the seasoning over. When done enough, take it up, and lay it in a dish ; have half a pint of good gravy ready besides that in the djsh, and put into it two spoonfuls of ketchup, and rub down a teaspoonful of flour with it. Let this boil, and pour it over the mutton, but first skim off the fat well. Mind to keep the meat hot till the gravy is quite ready. Boiled Leg of Mutton. Time, a quarter of an hour to the pound. 241. Cut off the shank bone, trim the knuckle, and wash and wipe it very clean. Then put it into a saucepan with enough cold water for it to swim in, set it over a good fire. As the scum rises, skim it off care- fully. Boil the joint for two hours and a half, or according to its weight. When the joint is taken up, put a frill of cut paper round the shank bone. Mash some turnips with a little piece of butter and cream, and form them into the shape of eggs, and gar- nish the edge of the dish alternately with the turnip balls and with carrots cut into circular forms. Serve caper sauce in a tureen. To Stew a Neck of Mutton. Time, two and a half to three hours. 242. Four or five pounds of neck of mut- ton ; rather more than a pint of water ; a little Cayenne ; pepper and salt; two sprigs of parsley. Trim the fat from a neck of mutton, and put the latter into a stewpan with a little pepper and salt, and rather more than a pint of water ; let it simmer very gently. About twenty minutes before it is served, take nearly all the broth from the meat, and when it is cold skim off the fat, add a little Cay- enne pepper, and two sprigs of chopped parsley to the broth, let it boil for twenty minutes, thicken the gravy with a little but- ter rolled in flour, and pour it over the meat when sent to table. The exact quantities of water and season- ing must be regulated by the size of the joint, as some necks of mutton weigh six or seven pounds, in which case an extra half hour must be allowed for it to simmer. Breast of Mutton and Green Peas. Time, two hours and a half. 243. A breast of mutton ; one quart of green peas ; a bunch of sweet herbs ; pep- per and salt to taste ; one shallot or onion. Select a breast of mutton not too fat, and cut it into small square pieces , dredge it with flour, and fry it a fine brown in butter ; then add the herbs and shallot or onion cut into thin slices ; just cover the whole with water, and set it over a slow fire to stew until the meat is perfectly tender. Take out the meat, skim off all the fat from the gravy, and strain it over the meat into the stewpan, and make the whole very hot. Just before serving add a quart of young green peas, previously boiled, or add them with the strained gravy, and let the whole boil gently until the peas are done. Mutton Cutlets with Tomato Sauce. Time, twelve minutes. 244. Some cutlets from the neck of mut- ton ; two ounces of butter ; a little pepper and salt. Trim the neck of mutton before you cut off the cutlets (*.«., cut off from the joint the scrag and three inches of the rib bone); then take off the cutlets, shape them by chopping off the thick part of the chine- bone, beat them flat to about a quarter of an inch in thickness with a chopper, cut off an inch of fat from the top of the rib bone. Season them with pepper and salt. BeatMutton Cutlets—Haricot of Mutton. up the yolk of an egg, dip a brush in it and pass it lightly over the cutlet, and then dip it in bread-crumbs. Melt two ounces of butter in an omelet-pan and put the cutlets in it; set it over a gentle clear fire for five minutes, turn them, do them for five minutes longer, lay them on a clean cloth, then put them in a dish in a circle, one lean- ing over the other, with some good tomato sauce in the centre. Mutton Cutlets. Time, to stew, seven minutes ; to broil, ten minutes. 245. One pound and a half of chops from the loin ; a sprig of thyme and parsley ; yolk of one or two eggs ; bread-crumbs ; salt and Cayenne pepper to taste ; two ounces of butter ; juice of a small lemon. Cut about a pound and a half of cutlets from a loin of mutton, take off about an inch from the top of each bone, and from the thickest end ; melt two ounces t>f butter in a stewpan, season the cutlets, put them in, and let them stew for a short time without allowing them to gain any colour. Mince a little thyme and parsley fine, and bind it with the yolk of one or two eggs. When the cutlets are nearly cold spread the minced herbs over them, and sprinkle each cutlet thickly with grated bread, and a very little Cayenne pepper. Put them carefully on a gridiron over a clear brisk fire, and broil them a fine brown. Serve them on a hot dish, and squeeze over them the juice of a small lemon. Mutton Cutlets a la Maintenon. Time, fifteen minutes. 246. Some cutlets from the neck or loin ; a bunch of thyme and parsley ; some bread- crumbs ; pepper and salt. Cut about a pound and a half of the neck or loin of mutton into delicate cutlets, and chop each bone short ; trim them neatly, and put them into a stewpan with a piece of butter, and a little, thyme and parsley chopped fine ; season with pepper and salt; fry them lightly and then take them out to cool, after which take some fresh chopped parsley and some bread-crumbs ; spread them evenly over the cutlets with a knife, wrap them in buttered papers, and broil them over a clear fire. Serve them up in the papers with gravy in a tureen. These cutlets are said to have been invented by Madame de Maintenon in order to tempt the waning appetite of Louis XIV. The fat of the dressed meat is absorbed in the papillotes. They may also be served with- out gravy. 71 Mutton Chops Broiled. Time, ten minutes. 247. Cut some chops from the best end of the loin or neck, but the loin is preferable, trim them neatly, removing the skin and fat, leaving only enough of the latter to make them palatable ; let the fire be very clear before placing the chops on the gridiron, turn them frequently, taking care that the fork is not pul into the lean part of the chops ; season them with pepper and salt. When just finished cooking, put a piece of fresh butter over each chop, and send them to table on a hot dish, or serve with any sauce you like over them ; but in that case the chops become an cntrte.

Set them at the side of the fire to stew slowly for three- quarters of an hour, or rather more. Par- boil two carrots, two turnips, and half a head of celery, cut the former into shapes and the celery into slices, and add them to the meat about twenty minutes before serving. Pour in a glass of port wine, two spoonfuls of ketchup, and, after boiling it once up, serve it hot. Irish Stew. Time, about two hours. 249. Two pounds and a half of chops; eight potatoes ; four small onions ; nearly a quart of water. Take about two pounds and a half of chops from a loin of mutton, place them in a stewpan with alternate layers of sliced potatoes and layers of chops, and four small onions, and pour in nearly a quart of cold water ; cover the stewpan closely, and let it stew gently until the potatoes are ready to mash, and the greater part of the gravy is absorbed ; then place it in a dish, and serve it up very hot. Hashed Mutton. Time, one hour and twenty minutes. 250.

Put the bones into a stewpan with half a head of celery cut into slices, a bunch of savoury herbs, a few pepper corns, four allspice, and a pint and a half of water ; set it over the fire, and let it simmer gently for about an hour. Cut the onion into rings, fry them a nice brown, and put them into the stewpan with the bones and herbs. Let all simmer together for ten or twelve minutes, then strain it through a hair sieve, and when cold take off the fat. Put the slices of meat dredged with flour into the stewpan, add the gravy with a spoonful of browning, and two of walnut ketchup ; make it very hot, but do not let it boil. Serve it with sippets of toasted bread round the dish. Haggis. Time, two hours. 251. The heart, tongue, and part of the liver of a sheep ; rather more than half the weight in bacon ; one French roll; rind of a lemon ; two eggs ; a glass of wine ; two anchovies ; pepper and salt.

Time, for ten pounds, two hours and a half. 254. Cut off the scrag from the shoulder, saw off the shank bone, and also the chine bone along the fillet of the leg, and joint it thoroughly ; partially saw the rib bones, and break the bone of the shoulder, twist it round, and fasten it with a skewer from be- neath the breast. Cover the lamb with but- tered paper, and spit it evenly ; roast it before a quick fire according to the weight. Just before removing it from the spit, dredge it with flour and a little salt, and baste it with butter to make it froth up. Twist a cut paper round the shank bone, place it on a hot dish, and pour round it a little gravy made in the dripping-pan. Serve it with mint sauce in a tureen. A cut lemon, some Cayenne, and a piece of fresh butter should always be ready for use when the shoulder is separated from the ribs, to be laid be- tween it and them. Boned Quarter of Lamb. Time, a quarter of an hour to each pound. 255. One pound of forcemeat; melted butter. Bone a quarter of lamb, fill it with force- meat, roll it round, and tie it with a piece of string, cover it with a buttered paper, and roast it. Serve it with melted butter. Roast Target of Lamb. Time, one hour and a-quarter, or according to weight. 256. A little butter, flour, and salt. A target is only the breast and neck joints not separated. The flap bones must be taken from the neck, the chine bone sawed off, and the ribs well chopped. Cover it with buttered paper, place it in an even73 Roast and Boiled Lamb. position on the spit, and roast it before a bright fire for an hour and a quarter. Just before it is taken up, dredge it with a little salt and flour, and baste it well with butter to make it lookbrown.and froth it up. Then dish it up, and place the gravy made in the dripping-pan round it. Serve it with mint sauce in a tureen. Roast Leg of Lamb. Time, one hour and three-quarters for six pounds. 257. Procure a fine fresh leg of lamb, and place it some distance from the fire, basting it frequently ; a short time before it is done, move it nearer to the fire, dredge it with flour and a little salt, and baste it with dissolved butter, to give it a nice frothy appearance. Then empty the dripping-pan of its contents, pour in a cupful of hot water, stir it well round, and pour the gravy over the meat, through a fine sieve. Serve with mint sauce and a salad. Roast Shoulder of Lamb. Time, one hour and a quarter. 258. Place the joint at a moderate distance from a nice clear fire, and keep it constantly basted, to prevent the skin from becoming burnt. When done, dish it up ; and serve it with gravy made in the dripping-pan and poured round it. Send up mint sauce in a tureen. Roast Loin of Lamb. Time, a quarter of an hour to each pound. 259. The loin is seldom roasted on ac- count of its small weight, but for families of two ladies or a single person it will be found very delicate. Care must be taken that it does not burn in roasting. It is best to cover it with a buttered paper, which should be removed a few minutes before serving, to baste and froth it. Mint sauce. Saddle of Lamb. Time, a quarter of an hour to the pound ; one hour and a half to two hours. 260. Cover the joint with buttered paper to prevent the fat catching, and roast it at a brisk fire ; constantly basting it at first with a very little butter, then with its own drip- ping. Mint sauce. Boiled Leg of Lamb. Time, one hour and a quarter after the water simmers. 261. Select a fine fresh leg of lamb, weigh- ing about five pounds ; soak it in warm water for rather more than two hours, then wrap it in a cloth and boil it slowly for an hour and a quarter. When done, dish it up and garnish with a border of carrots, turnips, o r cauliflower around it. Wind a cut paper round the shank bone, and serve it with plain parsley and butter sauce poured over it. To Prepare the Brains of a Lamb’s Head for Serving under it. Time, ten minutes. 262. One cupful of vinegar; half a pint of water, one tablespoonful of chopped parsley ; salt; and half a lemon. Boil the brains for ten minutes in a little vinegar and water, with a little salt, cut them into mince, add to them the yolk of an egg, mix them with a little milk, two dessertspoonfuls of chopped parsley, and the juice of half a lemon. The liver may be blanched and minced up in the same manner if it is liked. Pluck may be prepared by first scalding it, then letting it get cold, and stewing it in gravy seasoned with an onion, sweet herbs, pepper, salt, and a little nutmeg. Lamb’s Head and Pluck. Time, one hour and a quarter to boil. 263. A lamb’s head ; egg ; bread-crumbs ; a bunch of sweet herbs ; a little stock ; a piece of lemon peel; pepper, salt, and nutmeg. Soak the head in water for two hours, then boil it until nearly done, take it out, and brush it over with the yolk of a well- beaten egg, cover it thickly with bread- crumbs ; again add the egg, and repeat the bread-crumbs, season it with pepper and salt, and put it into a moderate oven till sufficiently brown. In the meantime, after scalding the pluck and setting it to cool, mince it up fine, mix in the brains and season them with pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg ; put them into a stewpan with a piece of lemon peel cut thin, a bunch of sweet herbs minced up, and a little stock. When done, add the yolk of an egg beaten up with a tablespoonful of cream, put the mince into the dish, and serve the lamb’s head on it. Lamb’s Fry. Time, altogether twenty minutes. 264. One pound of lamb’s fry; one egg ; one ounce of bread-crumbs ; a sprig of parsley ; pepper and salt. Take a pound of lamb’s fry, and boil it for about a quarter of an hour ; then drain it dry.

Fry it till it is a nice colour—i.e., for about five minutes—andLamb Cutlets a)id Chops— Veal. 74 serve it on a folded napkin with fried parsley. Cold lamb is so excellent that it is often preferred to hot-dressed joints. It is quite a mistake to prepare it by any of the modes of dressing up cold meat. It should be eaten cold with mint sauce and a nicely- made salad. Lamb Cutlets and Green Peas. Time, eight or ten minutes. 265. Two, or two and a half pounds of the best end of a neck of lamb ; bread- crumbs ; two eggs ; pepper and salt; two ounces of butter ; half a peck of green peas. Take the cutlets from the best end of the neck ; chop off. the thick part of the chine bone, and trim the cutlets neatly by taking off the skin and the greater part of the fat, scraping the upper part of the bones per- fectly clean. Brush each cutlet over with well-beaten yolk of egg, and then sprinkle them with fine bread-crumbs, seasoned with pepper and salt. After this dip them separately into a little clarified butter. Sprinkle more crumbs over them and fry them, turning them occasionally. Have ready half a peck of green peas, nicely boiled, and arranged in a pyramid or raised form in the centre of a hot dish. Lay the cutlets before the fire to drain, and then place them round the green peas. Lamb Chops. Time, eight to ten minutes. 266. Chops from the loin ; pepper and salt; a mould of mashed potatoes. Cut the chops from a loin of lamb ; let them be about three-quarters of an inch thick. Broil them over a clear fire. When they are done, season them with pepper and salt. Have ready a mould of nicely mashed potatoes in a hot dish ; place the chops leaning against them, and serve very hot. Or they may be served garnished only with fried parsley. VEAL. To Roast a Fillet of Veal. Time, four hours for twelve pounds. 267. Veal ; half a pint of melted butter ; a lemon ; half a pound of forcemeat. Take out the bone of the joint, and with a sharp knife make a deep incision between the fillet and the udder. Fill it with the forcemeat or veal stuffing. Bind the veal up in a round form, and fasten it securely with skewers and twine. Run the spit as nearly through the middle as you can; cover the veal with buttered paper, and put it at some distance from the fire at first, advancing it as it becomes dressed. Baste it well, and just before it is done, take off the paper, dredge a little flour over it, and baste it well with butter to give it a fine frothy appearance. Remove the skewers, and replace them with a silver one ; pour over the fillet some melted butter, with the juice of half a lemon and a little of the brown gravy from the meat. Garnish with slices of cut lemon, and serve with either boiled ham, bacon, or pickled pork. Or garnish with croquettes of potato in the form of pears with parsley stems, as in engraving. Fricandeau of Veal. Time, two hours and a half or three hours. 268. Three or four pounds of the fillet of veal ; a few slices of bacon ; a bunch of savoury herbs ; two blades of mace ; two bay-leaves; five allspice ; one head of celery ; one carrot ; one turnip ; lardoons ; pepper to taste ; one pint of gravy or stock. Cut a thick handsome slice from a fillet of veal, trim it neatly round, and lard it thickly with fat bacon, as shown in the en- graving. Cut the carrot, turnip, and celery into slices, and put them into a stew- pan with a bunch of savoury herbs, two blades of mace, five allspice, and two bay- leaves, with some slices of bacon at the top. Lay the fricandeau over the bacon with the larded side uppermost, dust a little salt over it, and pour round it a pint of good gravy or broth. Place it over the fire, and let it boil, then let it simmer very gently for two hours and a half or three hours over a slow fire, basting it frequently with the gravy. Take out the fricandeau when done ; skim off the fat, strain the gravy, and boil it quickly to a strong glaze, cover the fricandeau with it, and serve it up very hot, upon a puree of green peas. Be careful that the gravy does not touch the fricandeau, but that it only covers the bacon and other ingredients at the bottom of the dish. CALF’S HEAD. A calfs head may be bought ready for cooking from the butcher's, but as it is as well to give directions for the cook under all pos- sible circumstances, we will say here that if she has a calf 's head to prepare with the hair on it, she must have ready a pan of scalding water to remove it. She will find the hair easier to get off if she powders it with resin after letting it soak a little while in warm water. She must then plunge it into the scalding water, holding it by the ear, and75 Calf's Hcad- carefully scrape off all the hair. Many cooks use scalding water only, but M. Soyer (whose name is a perfect authority) recommends the resin, and it certainly facilitates the operation, though it is not indispensable. Then take out the eyes, saw the head in halves lengthways through the skull. Take the brain and tongue out. Half a calfs head is generally enough to serve at one time, but a whole head is a very handsome dish. Break the jawbone, re- move the gums containing the teeth, and then lay the head in a large panful of warm water to disgorge. Calf’s Head Boiled. Time, to soak, one hour and a half; to simmer, one hour and a half. 269. Half a calf's head ; half a pint of melted butter with parsley ; one lemon ; a pinch of pepper and salt. Soak the half calf's head in cold water for an hour and a half, then for ten minutes in hot water before it is dressed. Put it into a saucepan with plenty of cold water (enough for the head to swim), and let it boil gently. When the scum rises skim it very carefully. After the head boils, let it simmer gently an hour and a half. Serve it with melted butter and parsley over it, and garnish with slices of lemon and tiny heaps of fried parsley (see engrav- ing). Ham should be served with calf’s head, or slices of bacon. Calf’s Brains and Tongue. Time, to boil ten or fifteen minutes. 270. A little parsley and thyme; one bay-leaf; a little pepper and salt; two tablespoonfuls of melted butter or cream ; juice of a quarter of a lemon; a pinch of Cayenne. Separate the two lobes of the brain with a knife, soak them in cold water with a little salt in it for an hour ; then pour away the cold water and cover them with hot water; clean and skin them. Boil them then very gently in half a pint of water, take off the scum carefully as it rises. Take them up, drain and chop them, and put them to warm in a stewpan with the herbs chopped, the melted butter or cream, arid the seasoning. Squeeze a little lemon juice over them ; stir them well together. Boil the tongue ; skin it ; take off the roots ; lay it in the middle of the dish, and serve the brains round it. Hashed Calf’s Head. Time, one hour and a half. 271. Cold calf’s head; a bunch of savoury herbs ; two blades of mace ; a little ■Roast Veal. Cayenne; pepper and salt ; one lemon ; a gill and a half of sherry, or any white wine ; two dessertspoonfuls of mushroom ketchup ; one onion ; one carrot; one quart of broth, or the liquor in which it was boiled. Cut the meat from the remains of a boiled calf's head, into small round pieces of about two inches across. Put a quart of broth or the liquor in which the head was boiled into a stewpan with a carrot, one small onion, two blades of mace, and a bunch of savoury herbs, and boil it until reduced to nearly half the quantity ; then strain it through a hair sieve, and add a glass and a half of white wine, the juice of a lemon, two des- sertspoonfuls of mushroom ketchup, and a piece of butter rolled in flour. Lay in the slices of head, and when gradually well heated, let it just boil up. Then serve it on a hot dish, with rolled bacon and forcemeat balls as a garnish. Roast Loin of Veal—Plain. Time, three hours. 272. Take about seven pounds of the kidney end of a loin of veal, fasten the flap over the kidney with a small skewer, run the spit through the thick end lengthways, cover the veal with buttered paper, and place it before a good fire to roast. Just before serving, remove the paper, and froth it up by dredging it with a little flour, and basting it with butter. Pour melted butter over it when placed on the dish, and serve. The kidney and fat may be sent to table separately on a toast if preferred, but it is not very usual to do so. To Roast a Breast of Veal. Time, one hour and a quarter. 273. Take off the tendons from a breast of veal, skewer the sweetbread to the joint, and cover it with buttered paper, place it to roast for an hour and a quarter, or accord- ing to its weight. Serve it with melted butter and gravy, and sliced lemon. It can be roasted without the sweetbread, which as well as the tendons will serve for an entree. Roast Shoulder of Veal. Time, twenty minutes for each pound. 274. A shoulder of veal; some oyster or mushroom sauce. Remove the knuckle from a shoulder of veal for boiling, and roast what remains as the fillet, either stuffed or not with veal stuffing. If not stuffed, serve it with oyster or mushroom sauce, and garnish with sliced lemon.76 Stewed and Boiled Veal—Calf's Liver and Bacon. Stewed Knuckle of Veal and Rice. Time, three hours. 275. Six pounds of knuckle of veal ; two blades of mace; half a pound of rice; a little salt ; one onion. Take off some cutlets or collops before you dress the meat, so as to have the knuckle small ; break the shank bone, wash it well, and put it into a stewpan with suffi- cient water to cover it, bring it gradually to a boil, put in a little salt, and skim it well ; let it simmer gently for nearly three-quarters of an hour, then add half a pound of rice, the onion, and the blades of mace, and stew all together for more than two hours. Take up the meat, and pour over it the rice, &c. Serve it with parsley and butter sauce, and boiled bacon in a separate dish. Garnish with vegetables. Knuckle of Veal Boiled. Time, twenty minutes to each pound. 276. A knuckle of veal ; a dessertspoonful of salt; parsley and butter. Put a knuckle of veal into a stewpan, and pour over it sufficient water to cover it ; let it simmer slowly, and when it reaches the boiling point throw in a dessertspoonful of salt ; keep it well skimmed, and let it boil until tender, then serve it with parsley and butter, and a salted pig's cheek. Three-quarters of a pound of rice may also be boiled with it. Serve with green peas or stewed cucumber. Veal Stewed with Vegetables. Time, nearly one hour. 277. Three pounds of veal; one dessert- spoonful of salt; one teaspoonful of pepper ; two small carrots ; two sprigs of parsley ; one leek ; six small potatoes ; a quarter of a pound of butter ; a tablespoonful of flour. Wash three pounds of veal in cold water, then cut it up rather small, and put it into a stewpan with just sufficient water to cover it; add a dessertspoonful of salt, and a tea- spoonful of pepper; cover the pan close, and let it simmer for twenty-five minutes, then skim it clean. Whilst the meat is stewing, scrape two small carrots, cut them into slices a quarter of an inch thick, stamp the edges with a cutter, and boil them until they are tender. Dip two sprigs of parsley into boiling water, and mince it fine ; cut a leek into small slices; pare and cut six small potatoes in halves or quarters ; take the carrots from the water with a skimmer ; put a quarter of a pound of fresh butter to the meat ; dredge over it a tablespoonful of browned flour and add the vegetables. Cover the pan, and let it stew gently for half an hour ; then take out the meat on a dish, put the vegetables round the edge, and pour the gravy over it. Veal Cutlets. Time, twelve to fifteen minutes. 278. A veal cutlet; one bunch of sweet herbs ; bread-crumbs; nutmeg ; peel of half a lemon; yolks of two eggs; one ounce of butter ; a little flour and water. Let the cutlet be about half an inch thick, and cut it into pieces the size and shape of a crown piece. Chop the herbs very fine ; mix them well with the bread- crumbs. Brush the cutlets over with yolk of egg, then cover them with the bread- crumbs and chopped herbs ; fry them lightly in butter, turning them when required. Take them out when done. Mix about an ounce of fresh butter with the grated peel of half a lemon, a little nut- meg, and flour ; pour a little water into the frying-pan, and stir the butter, flour, and grated lemon peel into it; then put the cutlets into this gravy to heat. Serve them piled in the centre of the dish with thin rolls of bacon as a garnish. Calf’s Liver and Bacon. Time, quarter of an hour. 279. Two pounds and a half of calf's liver; one pound of bacon ; juice of one lemon ; two ounces of butter ; a little flour ; pepper and salt. Soak the liver in cold water for half an hour, then dry it in a cloth, and cut it into thin naiTow slices ; take about a pound of bacon, or as much as you may require, and cut an equal number of thin slices as you have of liver; fry the bacon lightly, take it out and keep it hot ; then fry the liver in the same pan, seasoning it with pepper and salt, and dredging over it a little flour. When it is a nice brown, arrange it round the dish with a roll of bacon between each slice. Pour off the fat from the pan, put in about two ounces of butter well rubbed in flour to thicken the gravy; squeeze in the juice of a lemon, and add a cupful of hot water ; boil it, and pour it into the centre of the dish. Serve it garnished with forcemeat balls or slices of lemon. PORK. Sucking Pig—to Scald it. 280. A sucking pig should be dressed the day after it is killed, if possible, and should not be more than three weeks or a month old. The pig is generally sent from theTo Roast, Bake, and Boil Pork. 77 butcher's prepared for the spit ; but in case our readers should ever have occasion to scald and clean it for themselves, we will give a few directions Make ready a large pan of scalding water. While the water is boiling, put the pig into cold water for ten minutes; plunge it into the boiling water (holding it by the head), and shake it about till the hairs begin to loosen in the water. Take it out, dry it, and with a coarse cloth rub the hairs backwards till they are all removed. When it is clean, cut it open ; * take out the entrails, and wash it thoroughly in a large pan of cold water. Dry it in a cloth ; remove the feet at the first joint, leaving a little skin to pull over the bone. Fold it in a very wet cloth until you are ready to put it on the spit To Eoast the Pig. Time, one hour and a half to two hours. 281. Half a pint of melted butter ; two ounces of fresh butter ; three-quarters of a pint or one pint of sage and onion force- meat. When the pig is well cleaned, make a forcemeat according to previous directions, or a veal stuffing forcemeat if preferred. Sew it up with a strong thread; truss it as a hare is trussed, with its fore-legs skewered back and its hind-legs forward. Dry it well and rub it with a little flour. Set it before a clear brisk fire, arrange under it a dripping- pan and basins to catch the gravy. Baste it with a little pure olive oil, or with its own gravy, rubbing it occasionally (when you do not use oil) with butter. When it is done, cut off the head, split it in halves, divide the pig with a very sharp knife down the centre, lay the backs together, put the ears on each side, and the halves of head at each end of the dish. Pour a very little thin melted butter and a squeeze of lemon juice over it. Send some of the same gravy and melted butter (seasoned with a little Cayenne) to table in a sauce tureen. Sauces to be eaten with it—bread sauce, or tomato sauce, or apple sauce, as preferred. To Bake a Pig. Time, two hours. 282. Wash the pig very nicely, rub it with butter, and flour it all over. Well butter the dish in which you intend to bake it, and put it into the oven. When sufficiently done, take it out, rub it well over with a buttered cloth, and put it in again to dr)'. When it is finished, cut off the head and split it open ; divide the pig down the back in halves. Lay it in the dish back to back, with one half of the head at each end, and one of the ears on each side. Take off the fat from the dish it was baked in, and you will find some good gravy remaining at the bottom ; add to this a little veal gravy, with a piece of butter rolled in flour, and boil it up. Send it up in a tureen. A stuffing of bread-crumbs, chopped sage leaves, pepper and salt, should be put into the inside before it is baked, as is done for roast pig. Chine Eoasted. Time, twenty minutes to the pound. 283. Half a pint of pork stuffing ; half a pint of apple sauce. Score the skin deeply, stuff the chine with pork stuffing, and roast it gently by a clear fire. To Boil a Chine. Time, a quarter of an hour to the pound, and twenty minutes over. 284. Lay it in brine for nine or ten days, turning it every day. When it is ready, put it into a saucepan, and more than cover it with water. Let it boil slowly, skimming it well. Send it to table when done, garnished with small well-trimmed cauliflowers or greens. To Eoast a Leg of Pork. Time, twenty minutes to one pound. 285. The leg to be roasted should not weigh more than six or seven pounds. Score the rind or skin with a sharp knife all round the joint, place it at some distance from the fire, turn it constantly and baste it well. It will yield sufficient dripping to baste itself without butter. If the crackling and fat are not kept on, the joint will not require so long a time to roast it. Sauce : brown gravy, or tomato. To Eoast a Leg of Pork the Old Fashioned Way with Stuffing. Time, twenty minutes for each pound. 286. Sage and onion stuffing ; a piece of butter. Select a fine small leg of pork, keep the skin on, and score it in regular stripes of a quarter of an inch wide with the point of a sharp knife ; cut a slit in the knuckle, raise the skin, put under it some nice sage and onion stuffing, and fasten it in with a small skewer; put it at some distance from the fire, and baste it frequently. Just before it is done, moisten the skin all over with a little butter, dredge it with flour, and place it near the fire to brown and crisp. When done, put it on a hot dish, pour a little gravy mad’e in the dripping-pan round it, and serve with apple sauce-78 To Roast Pork—To Steam, Boil, and Bake Ham. To Roast a Loin of Pork. Time, two hours and a half. 287. Take a loin of pork of about five pounds, and score it with a very sharp knife at equal distances, place it at a good distance from the fire, to prevent the skin from becoming hard, and baste it very frequently all the time. When done, make a little gravy in the dripping-pan, pour it round the meat, and serve with apple sauce in a tureen. A loin of pork may be stuffed with sage and onion, or the stuffing baked and served separately, if the flavour be not objected to by the family. To Roast a Sparerib of Pork. Time, one hour and three-quarters for six pounds. 288. Score the skin, put the joint down to a bright fire to roast, rub a little flour over it. If the rind is kept on, roast it without a buttered paper over it but if the skin and fat are removed, cover it with a buttered paper. Keep it frequently basted. About ten minutes before taking it up, strew over it some powdered sage ; froth it with a little butter, and serve with gravy strained over it, and apple sauce in a tureen. Pork Griskin. Time, a quarter of an hour to each pound. 289. A griskin is usually very hard. It is well before you roast it to put it into as much cold water as will cover it, and let it just boil, take it off the moment it boils ; rub a piece of butter over it and flour it, then set it in a Dutch oven before the fire to roast a nice brown. To Steam a Ham. Time, twenty minutes to each pound. 290. If the ham has been hung for some time, put it into cold water, and let it soak all night, or let it lie on a damp stone sprinkled with water for two days to mellow. Wash it well, put it into a steamer—there are proper ones made for the purpose— over a pot of boiling water. Steam it for as long a time as the weight requires, the pro- portion of time given above. This is by far the best way of cooking a ham. It prevents waste and retains the flavour. When it is done, skin it and strew bread-raspings over it as usual. If you preserve the skin 'as whole as possible and cover the ham when cold with it, it will prevent its becoming dry. To Boil a Ham. Time, four or five hours. 291. A blade of mace; a few cloves ; a sprig of thyme ; and two bay leaves. Well soak the ham in a large quantity of water for twenty-four hours, then trim and scrape it very clean, put it into a large stew- pan with more than sufficient water to covet it ; put in a blade of mace, a few cloves, a sprig of thyme, and two bay leaves. Boil it for four or five hours, according to its weight ; and when done, let it become cold in the liquor in which it was boiled. Then remove the rind carefully without injuring the fat, press a cloth over it to absorb as much of the grease as possible, and shake some bread-raspings over the fat, or brush it thickly over with glaze. Serve it cold, garnished with parsley, or aspic jelly in the dish. Ornament the knuckle with a paper frill and vegetable flowers. Or to Serve Hot. Time, four hours for ten pounds. 292. Before placing your ham in soak, • run a small sharp knife into it close to the bone, and if when withdrawn it has a plea- sant smell, the ham is good. Lay it in cold water to soak for twenty-four hours if it has hung long, changing the water twice ; but twelve hours is the usual time for a York- shire ham. Before boiling, wash it thoroughly, and trim it neatly, removing any rusty parts. Cover it well with water, bring it gradually to a boil, taking care that it continues to do so (but not too fast), and as the scum rises skim the pot carefully, or it will fall and spoil the appearance of the ham. When it is done draw off the skin, and sift bread- raspings over the ham. Place a frill of paper round the knuckle, and serve. To Bake a Ham. Time, four hours. 293. Take a medium-sized ham, and place it to soak for ten or tw'elve hours. Then cut away the rusty part from underneath, wipe it dry, and cover it rather thickly over with a paste of flour and water. Put it into an earthen dish, and set it in a moderately- heated oven for four hours. When done, take off the crust carefully and peel off the skin, put a frill of cut paper round the knuckle, and raspings of bread over the fat of the ham, or serve it glazed, and garnished with cut vegetables. Some persons infinitely prefer a baked ham to a boiled one, but we think it better boiled or steamed. To Boil a Leg of Fork. Time, a quarter of an hour for each pound, and half an hour over. 294. Procure a nice small compact leg of pork, rub it well with salt, and let it remainTo Melt Lard—To Pickle Pork. 79 for a week in pickle, turning and rubbing the pickle into it once each day. Let it lie for half an hour in cold water before it is dressed to improve the colour ; then put it into a large pot, or stewpan, and well cover it with water. Let it boil gradually, and skim frequently as the scum rises. On no account let it boil fast, or the meat will be hardened, and the knuckle end will be done before the thick part. When done, serve it on a hot dish with a garnish of turnips, or parsnips. A peas-pudding must be served with boiled leg of pork, and greens as vege- tables. It may be boiled in a cloth dredged over with flour, which gives it a very deli- cate appearance, but in that case the water in which it was boiled cannot be used as a stock for pea-soup, and is thus wasted. To Boil Bacon. Time, one hour and a half for two or three pounds. 295. If very salt, soak it in soft water two hours before cooking. Put it into a saucepan with plenty of water and let it boil gently. If a fine piece of the gammon of bacon, it may, when done, have the skin, as in hams, stripped off, and have finely-pow-. dered bread-raspings strewed over it. To Steam Bacon. Time, twenty minutes to the pound. 296. It is a mistake to boil bacon. It should be steamed. No waste then takes place as to quantity, and the flavour is quite preserved, while the bacon is much more tender, as it cannot well be spoiled by too quick boiling. Scrape the outer rind or skin well, wash the bacon, put it in a steamer over a pot of boiling water, and steam it for as long as required by the weight. Serve it with veal or fowls, or (in the kitchen) by itself with greens. To Melt Lard. 297. Strip off all the skin from the inner part of a pig, put it into a jar, and place it in a large saucepan of boiling water. Let it simmer gently over a bright fire, and as it melts, take it gently from the sediment. Put it into nicely cleaned bladders for use ; keep them in a cool place. The smaller the bladders are, the better the lard keeps. If the air reaches it, it becomes rank. This is most useful for frying fish (it is used instead of oil). Mixed with butter it makes fine pie crust. Pickled Pork. Time, three-quarters of an hour to four pounds. 298. The belly part is considered delicate. It should be nicely streaked. Boil it gently. Serve it with greens as a garnish round it. A Hand of Pork. Time, one hour. 299. If the pork should be very salt, it will require to be soaked for nearly two hours before boiling. Boil it and serve with greens and peas-pudding in a separate dish. Bladebone of Pork. Time, ten minutes. 300. One teaspoonful of pepper and a little salt; a piece of butter the size of a walnut ; one teaspoonful of mustard. A bladebone of pork is taken from the bacon hog. The less meat left on it in moderation the better. It must be boiled, and when just done, season it with pepper and salt. Lay a piece of butter on it and a teaspoonful of made mustard. Serve it quickly as hot as possible. The fore-quarter of a young pig of four or five months old, cut for roasting as you do lamb with the shank trussed close, should be roasted as lamb, and will eat something like it. Pigs’ Tongues. 301. Partially boil the tongue in order to remove the skin. Pickle them as you would pickle a ham : lay them one on the top of each other under a heavy weight. Cover the pan in which you place them, and let them remain for a week, then dry them, and put them into sausage skins. Fasten them up at the ends, and smoke them. Pigs’ Pettitoes. Time, forty minutes. 302. Feet, heart, and liver of a pig; a small piece of butter (size of a walnut); half a teaspoonful. of pepper ; a little salt; one round of toasted bread. Put them in just sufficient water to cover them, add the heart and liver, boil them ten minutes, then take out the liver and heart, and mince them small, return them to the feet, and stew until quite tender; thicken with flour and butter, season with pepper and salt, and serve up with sippets of plain or toasted bread ; make a pyramid of the minced heart and liver, and lay the feet round them. When pettitoes are fried they should be first boiled, then dipped in butter, and fried a light brown. To Boast a Pig's Head. Time, to roast, half an hour. 303. Half an ounce of sage ; one table- spoonful of salt ; one dessertspoonful of pepper.8o Sausages—Saveloys—Black Puddings. Boil it till tender enougli to take the bones out. Then chop some sage fine, mix it with the pepper and salt, and rub it over the head. Hang it on the spit, and roast it at a good fire. Baste, it well. Make a good gravy and pour over it. Apple sauce is eaten with it. Pig’s Head Boiled. Time, one hour and a half. 304. This is the more profitable dish, though not so pleasant to the palate ; it should first be salted, which is usually, done by the pork butcher; it should be boiled gently ; serve with vegetables. Pig’s Cheek. Time, three-quarters of an hour. 305. Pig’s cheek ; one ounce of bread- crumbs. Boil and trim in the shape of ham, and, if very fat, carve it as a cockle-shell; glaze it well, or put over it bread-crumbs and brown them. Oxford Sausages. 306. One pound of lean veal; one pound of young pork ; one pound of beef suet ; half a pound of grated bread ; peel of half a lemon ; one nutmeg grated ; six sage leaves ; one teaspoonful of pepper; two of salt; a sprig of thyme, savory, and mar- joram. Take a pound of lean veal, and the same quantity of young pork, fat and lean to- gether, free from skin and gristle, and a pound of beef suet; chop all separately as fine as possible, and then mix together ; add the grated bread, the peel of half a lemon shred fine, a nutmeg grated, a teaspocmful of pepper, two of salt, and the sage leaves, thyme, savory, and marjoram, all chopped as fine as you can ; mix all thoroughly to- gether, and press it down into a prepared skin. When you use them, fry them in fresh butter a fine brown. Serve as hot as possible. The Cambridge Sausage. Time, nearly one hour. 307. Quarter of a pound of beef; quarter of a pound of veal; half a pound of pork ; half a pound of bacon ; half a pound of suet ; pepper and salt; a few sage leaves ; sweet herbs. Chop the meat into small pieces, and the suet as fine as possible ; season it highly with pepper and salt, a few minced sage leaves and sweet herbs. Take a delicately- clean skin, fill it with the sausage meat, and tie the ends securely. Prick it lightly in several parts, and put it in boiling water to boil for nearly an hour when required. Bologna Sausages. 308. Three pounds of lean beef; three pounds of lean pork ; two pounds of fat bacon ; one pound and a half of beef suet ; pepper ; salt; a sprig of thyme ; and ground mace. Take three pounds of lean beef, the same of lean pork, two pounds of fat bacon, and a pound and a half of beef suet; put the lean meat into a stewpan of hot water, and set it over the fire for half an hour, then cut it small, each sort by itself, shred the suet, and bacon or ham, each by itself. Season with pepper, thyme chopped fine, and ground mace ; fill ox skins with it, tie them in lengths, and put them in a beef brine for ten days ; then smoke them the same as ham or tongue. Rub ground ginger or pepper over the outside after they are smoked, and keep them in a cool, dry place. Saveloys. Time, half an hour to bake. 309. Six pounds of pork ; one pound of common salt; one ounce of saltpetre ; three teaspoonfuls of pepper ; twelve sage leaves; one pound of bread-crumbs. Remove the skin and bone from six pounds of young pork, and salt it with the saltpetre and common salt ; let it stand in the pickle for three days, then mince it up very fine, and season it with pepper, and twelve sage leaves chopped as small as pos- sible ; add to it the grated bread, and mix it all well together, fill the skins, and bake them in a slow oven for half an hour. They' may be eaten hot or cold. Black Puddings. Time, to soak, one night ; to boil, half an hour. 310. Rather more than one quart of blood ; one quart of whole groats ; crumb of a quartern loaf; two quarts of new milk; a small bunch of winter savory and thyme, about half a teaspoonful of each ; two teaspoonfuls of salt ; one teaspoonful of pepper ; six cloves ; half a teaspoonful of allspice ; half a nutmeg ; a little grated ginger ; three pounds of beef suet; six eggs ; three ounces of pork fat. Stir the hot blood with salt till it is quite cold, put a quart of it or rather more to a quart of whole groats, to soak one night. Soak the crumb of a quartern loaf in rather more than two quarts of new milk made hot. Chop fine a little winter savory and thyme ; beat up and strain six eggs ; chop three pounds of beef suet; mix the suet, the herbs, and the seasoning of pepper, salt, allspice, cloves, ginger and nutmeg1 1.

When well mixed, have ready some skin-bags, as for sausages, but much larger (we suppose, of course, that they have been well cleaned and soaked), put the mixture into these bags ; but as you do so, add at regular distances pork fat cut into large dice. Tie the skins in links only half-filled, and boil the puddings in a large kettle, pricking them as they swell, or they will burst. When boiled, dry them in clean cloths, and hang them up. To cook them for eating, scald them for a few minutes in water, and cook them in a Dutch oven. VENISON. Haunch of Venison. Time, three to four hours. 311. Haunch from twenty to twenty-five pounds. This joint is trimmed by cutting off part of the knuckle and sawing off the chine bone, then the flap is folded over, and it is covered with a paste made of flour and water. This paste should be about an inch thick. Tie it up in strong and very thick paper, and place it in a cradle spit very close to the fire till the paste is well hardened or crusted, pouring a few ladlefuls of hot drip- ping over it occasionally to prevent the paper from catching fire. Then move it further from the fire, take care that your fire is a very good one, clear and strong. When the venison has roasted for about four hours take it up, remove the paper and paste, and run a thin skewer in to see if it is done enough. If the skewer goes in easily it is dressed, if not put it down again, as it depends greatly on the strength of the fire for so large a joint. When it is dressed, glaze the top and salamander it. Put a frill round the knuckle, and serve very hot with strong gravy. Red currant jelly in a glass dish or a tureen. Vegetables: French beans. Neck of Venison. Time, a quarter of an hour for a pound. 3x2. Cover it with paste and paper as for the haunch, fix it on a spit and roast. To Hash Venison. Time, one hour and a half. 313. Some cold roast venison ; three ta- blespoonfuls of port wine ; a little mutton broth ; half of a shallot; a pinch of Cay- enne ; one ounce and a half of butter ; a spoonful of flour ; and salt to taste. Cut some cold roast venison into nice slices, and season them lightly with salt ; put the bones, trimmings, any cold gravy from the venison, and as much broth as you may require into a stewpan, and let it simmer slowly for quite an hour, then strain it off; stir the butter and flour over the fire until sufficiently brown to colour the gravy, taking care it does not burn. Pour the gravy from the bones, add the port wine, and let it simmer until it boils. Then draw the stewpan to the side of the fire, put in the slices of venison, and when thoroughly hot serve it up, with red currant jelly in a glass dish. Garnish with forcemeat balls about the size of a marble. POULTRY. Roast Turkey. In season from December to February. Time, according to size, from one hour and fifteen minutes to two hours, or two hours and a half. 314. Half a pint of forcemeat for veal, or sausage meat ; a little butter. To truss the bird : pick the bird carefully, and singe off the down with a piece of lighted white paper ; break the leg bones close to the feet; hang it on a hook, and draw out the strings from the thigh ; cut the neck off close to the back, but leave the crop skin long enough to turn over the back; remove the crop, and with the middle finger loosen the liver and the gut at the throat end. Cut off the vent, remove the gut, take a crooked wire and pull out the gizzard, and the liver will easily follow. But be very careful not to break the gall bladder ; if you do it will spoil the flavour of the bird entirely, by giving it a bitter taste, which no after efforts of wash- ing, &c., can remove. Do not break the gut joining the gizzard either, lest the inside should become gritty. Wipe the inside perfectly clean with a wet cloth, then cut the breast-bone through on each side close to the back, and draw the legs close to the crop. Put a clo'h on the breast and beat the breast-bone down with a rolling-pin till it lies flat. Scald the feet, peel off the outer skin, and cut away the claws ; leave the legs on. Fill the inside with veal stuffing or sausage meat (see Forcemeats), and either sew the skin of the neck over the back with a trussing needle, or fasten it with a very small skewer. Then run a long skewer into the pinion and thigh through the body, G82 Boiled and Hashed Turkey—To Truss a Goose. passing it through the opposite pinion and thigh. On the other side put a skewer in the small part of the leg, close on the out- side of the sidesman, and push it through. Clean the liver and gizzard, and tuck them between the pinions, and turn the point of the pinions on the back. Pass a string over the points of the skewers, and tie it securely at the back to keep the bird neat and firmly trussed. Cover the breast with a sheet of nicely buttered white paper. Place the bird on the spit or roasting jack, and set it at some distance from the fire, which should be a very good and bright one. Keep the heat well to the breast. Put a quarter of a pound of butter in the dripping-pan, and baste it frequently to prevent it from drying too much. Just before it is finished dressing, remove the paper, dredge it lightly with flour, and baste it with the butter, so as to brown and froth it. Serve it with good brown gravy poured over it, and garnish with small fried sausages or forcemeat balls. Sauce : bread sauce. Boiled Turkey. Hen turkeys are best for boiling ; they should hang quite four days before they are dressed. Time, large turkey, one hour and three- quarters ; smaller, one hour and a half. 315. To truss a boiled turkey. Cut the first joint of the legs off, pass the middle finger into the inside, raise the skin of the legs, and put them under the apron of the bird. Put a skewer into the joint of the wing and the middle joint of the leg, and run it through the body and the other leg and wing. The liver and gizzard must be put in the pinions. Then turn the small end of the pinion on the back, and tie a pack- thread over the ends of the legs to keep Ihem in their places. Having trussed the turkey for boiling, put it, wrapped in a clean cloth, into sufficient hot water to more than cover it. Bring it gradually to a boil, and carefully remove the scum as it rises, or it will spoil the appearance of the bird. Let it simmer very gently for an hour and a half, or for a longer time if of a large size. When done, serve it on a hot dish with a little celery sauce, oyster sauce, or with parsley and butter ; put a small quan- tity of either over it, and send the other up in a tureen separately. Turkey Hashed. Time, one hour for the gravy. 316. Cold roast turkey; pepper ; salt ; half a pint of gravy; a piece of butter the size of a walnut; a little flour ; a spoonful of ketchup ; peel of half a lemon. Cut the breast of a cold turkey, or any of the white meat, into thin slices. Cut off the legs, score them, dredge them with pepper and salt, and broil them over a clear fire a nice brown. Put half a pint of gravy into a stewpan with a little piece of butter rolled in flour, a spoonful of ketchup, some pepper and salt, and the peel of half a lemon shred very fine. Put in the white meat, and shake it over a clear fire till it is tho- roughly hot, place it in a dish with the broiled legs on the top, and sippets of fried bread round it. To Broil the Legs of a Turkey. Time, a quarter of qn hour. 317. The legs of a turkey; a little pepper; salt ; Cayenne ; and a squeeze of a lemon. Take the legs from a cold rpast turkey, make some incisions across them with a sharp knife, and season them with a little pepper, salt, and a pinch of Cayenne. Squeeze over them a little lemon juice, and place them on a gridiron well buttered, over a clear fire. When done a nice brown, put them on a hot dish with a piece of butter on the top of each, and serve them up very hot. To Truss a Goose for Boasting. 318. Pick and stub it clean. Cut the feet off at the joint, and the pinion off at the first joint. Cut off the neck close to the back, leaving the skin of the neck long enough to turn over the back. Pull out the throat and tie a knot at the end. Loosen the liver, &c., at the breast end with the middle finger, and cut it open between the vent and rump. Draw out all the entrails except the soal or soul, wipe out the inside with a clean cloth. Beat the breastbone flat with a rolling-pin, put a skewer into the wing, and draw the legs up close, put a skewer through the middle of the legs and through the body, do the same on the other side. Put another skewer in the small of the leg, tuck it close down to the sidesman, run it through, and do the same on the other side. Cut off the end of the vent, and make a hole large enough for the passage of the rump, as by that means you will better secure the seasoning in its place. To Boast a Goose. Time, a large goose, two hours ; a smaller one, one hour and a half. 319. Sage and onion stuffing ; some good gravy. After the goose is prepared for roasting,Roast Duck and Fozvl. S3 fill it with sage and onion stuffing, and fasten it in securely at both ends by passing the rump through a slit made in the skin, and tying the skin of the neck into the back of the bird. Roast it before a nice brisk fire for an hour and a half if small; one hour and three-quarters or two hours if large. Keep it frequently basted, and when done remove the skewers, place it on a hot dish, and pour a little good gravy round it. Send up some in a tureen. Serve with apple sauce To Stew Giblets. Time, one hour and a half. 320. One set of giblets ; a bunch of par- sley and thyme ; a few sage leaves ; pepper and salt; one onion ; a quart of gravy; a wineglass of white wine. Thoroughly clean and wash the giblets, cut them into pieces, and stew them for an hour and a half in a quart of gravy, adding a bunch of thyme and parsley, an onion, a few sage leaves, and a seasoning of pepper and salt. When done, put them into water, and trim them ready for serving. Strain the gravy through a fine hair sieve, add a glass of white wine, and a piece of butter the size of a walnut rolled in flour. Boil the giblets up in the gravy, and serve them quickly. To Truss and Roast a Duck. 321. Ducks are trussed in the same manner as geese, except that the feet must be left on and turned close to the legs. To Roast a Duck. Time, three-quarters of an hour to one hour. 322. A couple of ducks ; sage and onion stuffing. Ducks should always hang for one day, and even longer if the weather be sufficiently cold to allow it. Stuff one with sage and onion stuffing, season the inside of the other with pepper and salt. Put them to roast at a clear bright fire, and keep them con- stantly basted until done. A short time before serving, dredge over them a little flour, and baste them with butter to make them froth and brown. Serve them very hot, and pour round (not over them) a little good brown gravy. Serve a little of the same separately in a tureen. Green peas should always be sent up with roast ducks, if in season. Stewed Duck. Time, two hours and a half. 323- A couple of ducks or one duck ; fpreemeat; three sage leaves ; two onions ; one lemon ; a glass of port wine. Take a duck, pick, draw, and stuff It with forcemeat, adding three sage leaves chopped fine. Clean and wash the giblets, and put them into sufficient water to cover them. Make from them a gravy for the duck, add two onions chopped very fine, and a season- ing of pepper and salt. Let the gravy simmer until it is strong enough, then put the duck into a stewpan, pour the gravy and onions over it, and stew it slowly for about two hours, adding a glass of port wine just before it is done. Dish it up and squeeze the juice of a lemon over it; pour the gravy round, and serve it with fried bread. To Truss a Roast Fowl. 324. The fowl must be picked and singed ; the neck cut off close to the back. Take out the crop, and with the middle finger loosen the liver and other parts at the breast end ; cut off the vent; draw the fowl clean ; wash out and wipe the inside quite dry; beat the breastbone flat with a rolling-pin. Put a skewer in the first joint of the pinion and bring the middle of the leg close to it. Put the skewer through the middle of the leg and through the body, and do the same on the other side. Put another skewer in the small of the leg, and through the sidesman. Do the same on the other side, and then put another through the skin of the feet, which should have the nails cut off. Clean out and wash the gizzard, remove the gall bag from the liver, and put both liver and gizzard in the pinions. To Roast a Fowl or Chicken. Time, one hour for a large one ; three- quarters of an hour for a small one ; twenty-five minutes for a chicken. 325. One large fowl or two small ones ; some brown gravy ; butter, and flour. When the fowls are trussed for roasting, singe them carefully, and wipe them clean ; put a piece of buttered paper over the breasts, and roast them at a clear fire, keeping them frequently basted. Just before they are done remove the paper, dredge them with flour, and baste them with butter warmed in the basting-ladle until they are nicely browned and have a frothy appearance. Then place them on a hot dish, pour a little brown gravy over them, and serve the remainder in a tureen with another of bread sauce. To Roast a Fowl—Family Receipt. Time, one hour. 326. A large fowl ; two or three table- spoonfuls of bread-crumbs ; half a pound of butter ; pepper and salt.8-t Boiled and Stewed Fowls. Draw and truss a fowl for roasting;, put into the inside two or three tablespoonfuls of fine bread-crumbs, seasoned with pepper and salt, and a piece of butter the size of a large walnut. Put the fowl down before a clear fire to roast, basting it well with butter ; and just before it • is done dredge over it a little flour, and baste it with butter to give it a frothy appearance. When done, add a little warm water to the butter in the dripping-pan, or add a little very thin melted butter, and strain it over the fowl. Serve with bread sauce in a tureen, or a little made gravy if preferred. To Truss Boiled Fowls, 327. For boiling, choose fowls that are not black legged. Pick and singe the fowl; cut off the neck close to the back ; take out the crop, and with the middle finger loosen the liver and other parts ; cut off the vent, draw it clean, and beat the breastbone flat with a rolling- pin. Cut off the nails of the feet and tuck them down close to the legs. Put your finger into the inside and raise the skin of the fowl, then cut a hole in the top of the skin, and put the legs under. Put a skewer in the first joint of the pinion and bring the middle of the leg close to it; put the skewer through the middle of the leg and through the body; do the same on the other side ; open the gizzard, remove the contents, and wash well, remove the gall bladder from the liver. Put the gizzard and liver in the pinions, turn the points of the pinions on the back, and tie a string over the tops of the legs to keep them in their proper places. To Boil Fowls or Chickens. Time, one hour for a large fowl ; three- quarters of an hour for a medium size ; half an hour for a chicken. 328. After the fowls or chickens are trussed for boiling, fold them in a nice white floured cloth and put them into a stewpan ; cover them well with hot water, bring it gradually to a boil, and skim it very carefully as the scum rises ; then let them simmer as slowly as possible, which will improve their appearance more than fast boiling, causing them to be whiter and plumper. When done, put them on a hot dish, remove the skewers, and pour over them a little parsley and butter, oyster, lemon, celery, or white sauce, serving the sauce also separately in a tureen. Boiled tongue, ham, or bacon is usually served to cat with them. To Stew a Fowl with Rice, Time, one hour and a half. 329. A fowl; about a quart of mutlort broth ; pepper ; salt ; mace ; a large cupful of rice. Truss the fowl foi* boiling, and stew it in about a quart of mutton broth, seasoned with a little pepper, salt, and half a blade of mace, for an hour and a half, skimming it often. About half an hour before the fowl is ready to serve, add a large cupful of rice, and when tender, strain the broth from if, and place the rice on a sieve to dry and swell before the fire, keeping the fowl hot ; then place it in the centre of a hot dish with the rice arranged in rather a high border round it.

We believe that it is utterly impossible to teach verbally how to make good paste or pie-crust; a lesson from a good cook would be worth whole volumes on this subject. Some general directions, however, may be given on this important art. First, the cook should have smooth cold hands—very clean —for making paste or crust. She should wash them well, and plunge them in cold water for a minute or two in hot weather, drying them well afterwards before beginning her paste. Tlie pastiy slab, if possible, should be made of marble ; if it is a wooden paste- board it should be kept scrupulously clean. The crust used for homely pies need not be as delicate as that used for company ; it may be made of clarified beef dripping or lard instead of butter. Be very careful about the proper heat of the oven for baking pies, as if it be too cold the paste will be heavy, and have a dull look ; if too hot, the crust will burn before the pie is done. Try if the oven is hot enough by holding your hand inside it for a few seconds; if you can do so without snatching it out again quickly, it is too cold ; it is best, however, to try it by baking a little piece of the crust in it first. Always make a small hole with a knife at the top of the pie to allow the gases gene- rated in it by the cooking to escape. This aperture is also useful for pouring gravy into the pie when it is done, if more is required. The hand of a pastrycook should be light, and the paste should not be worked more than is absolutely required for mixing it. We give first three plain receipts for pie crust, such as people of small means can use, and will find good, and also instruc- tions for clarifying dripping, so as to render it fit for making pie-crusts. To Clarify Beef Dripping. 399. Put the dripping into a basin, pour over it some boiling water, and stir it round with a silver spoon ; set it to cool, and then remove the dripping from the sediment, and put it into basins or jars for use in a cool place. Clarified dripping may be used for frying and basting everything except game or poultry, as well as for pies, &c. To Make a Short Crust with Dripping. 400. One pound of flour; three-quarters of a pound of clarified beef dripping ; oneHow to Make Crust for Pies and Puddings. 95 wineglassful of very cold water ; a pinch of salt. Take care that the water you use is cold, especially in summer. Put the flour, well dried, into a large basin (which should be kept for the purpose) with a pinch of salt; break up the clarified beef dripping into pieces, and mix them well with the flour, rubbing both together till you have a fine powder. Then make a hole in the middle of the flour, and pour in water enough to make a smooth and flexible paste. Sprinkle the pasteboard with flour, and your hands also, take out the lump of paste, roll it out, fold it together again, and roll it out ; fold it again, and roll it out—i.e., roll it three times ; the last time it should be of the thickness required for your crust, that is, about a quarter of an inch, or even thinner. It is then ready for use. Or, a still Plainer Crust for Children. 401. One pound of flour; five or six ounces of clarified beef dripping ; and a cupful of water. Put the flour into a bowl, and work it into a smooth paste with about a cupful of water. Divide the clarified dripping into three parts, roll out the paste, and put over it, in rows, one portion of the dripping broken into pieces the size of a bean ; flour it, fold over the edges, and again roll it ; repeat this folding, spreading, and rolling three times, dredging a very little flour over the paste and rolling-pin each time. It will be fit for any common purpose, or for children. Common Puff Paste. 402. One pound of sifted flour ; a quarter of a pound of lard ; half a teaspoonful of salt; half a pound of butter. Put one pound of sifted flour on the slab, or in an earthen basin, make a hollow in the centre, work into it a quarter of a pound of lard and half a teaspoonful of salt. When it is mixed through the flour, add as much cold water as will bind it together, then strew a little flour over the pasteboard or table ; flour the rolling-pin, and roll out the paste to half an inch in thickness ; divide half a pound of butter in three parts ; spread one evenly over the paste, fold it up, dredge a little flour over it and the paste- slab or table; roll it out again, spread another portion of the butter over, and fold and roll again; so continue until all the butter is used ; roll it out to a quarter of an inch in thickness for use. Suet Crust for Puddings. 403. One pound of flour ; six ounces of beef suet; a cupful of cold water. Strip the skin from the suet, chop it as fine as possible, rub it well into the flour, mix it with a knife, work it to a very smooth paste with a cupful of water, and roll it out for use. Conger-Eel Pie. Time, to bake, rather more than one hour. 404. A piece of conger-eel; a quart of water ; a quarter of an onion ; a bunch of sweet herbs; pepper, salt, and spice; a sprig of parsley ; four sage-leaves ; fifteen oysters ; half a pound of puff paste.

Season the pieces of conger with pepper and salt, and roll them in parsley and sage minced fine. Arrange them in a pie-dish, pour in the gravy (which should be strong enough to jelly when cold), put the oysters on the top, and pour in their liquor, cover the pie with a good puff paste, and bake it in a moderate oven. Potato Pasty. Time, nearly two hours. 405. One pound and a half of rumpsteak ; a large cupful of stock or gravy ; a piece of butter the size of an egg ; pepper and salt to taste ; a few spoonfuls of milk ; some mashed potatoes.

Mash some fine mealy potatoes with a few spoonfuls of milk, and fill up the whole space to the top of the tube of the pan, press the potato down, and mark it with a knife in any form you please. Bake it in a moderate oven a delicate colour. Send it to table with a folded napkin round it, and when served lift up the plate of potatoes. Plain Beefsteak Pie. Time, one hour and a half. 406.

Cut the paste even with the edge of the pie-dish allround, ornament it with leaves of paste, and brush it over with the beaten yolk of an egg. Make a hole with a knife in the top, and bake it in a hot oven. Mutton Pie. Time, to bake, one hour and a half or two hours. 407. Two pounds of a loin of mutton ; pepper and salt; a little forcemeat ; three muttonj kidneys ; and gravy made from the bones ; paste. Strip off the meat from the bones of a loin of mutton without dividing it, and cut it into nice thin slices, and season them with pepper and salt; put a pie-crust round the edge of a pie-dish, place in it a layer of mutton, then one of forcemeat, and again the slices of mutton with three or four halves of kidneys at equal distances; then pour in a gravy made from the bones seasoned and well cleared from fat.

Rooks must be skinned and stewed in milk and water before being put into the pie-dish ;. they may then be treated as pigeons. Epicures assert that only the breast must be used, but if when the rook is drawn and skinned it is laid on its breast and an incision made on each side of the spine of about a finger width, and that piece removed, the whole of the bird is wholesome food, that being the really bitter part. 415.

The greatest care is requisite in the choice of mushrooms, as the death of many persons has been occasioned by carelessly using the poisonous kinds of fungi. The eatable ones first appear very smallTo Stew Vegetables—Salads. and of a round form, on a little stalk. They grow very fast, and the upper part and stalk are white. As the size increases, the under part gradually opens, and shows a fringy fur of a very fine salmon-colour, which continues more or less till the mush- room has gained some size, and then turns to a dark brown. These marks should be attended to, and likewise whether the skin can be easily parted from the edges and middle. Those that have white or yellow fur should be carefully avoided, though many of them have the same smell (but not so strong) as the right sort. Stewed Mushrooms. Time, twenty-one minutes. 464. Button mushrooms ; salt to taste ; a little butter rolled in flour; two table- spoonfuls of cream, or the yolk of one egg. Choose buttons of uniform size. Wipe them clean and white with a wet flannel, put them in a stewpan with a little water, and let them stew very gently for a quarter of an hour. Add salt to taste, work in a little flour and butter, to make the liquor about as thick as cream, and let it boil for five minutes. When you are ready to dish it up, stir in two tablespoonfuls of cream, or the yolk of an egg, stir it over the fire for a minute, but do not let it boil, and serve. Stewed button mushrooms are very nice, cither in fish stews or ragofits, or served apart to eat with fish. Another way of doing them is to stew them in milk and water (after they are rubbed white), add to them a little veal gravy, mace, and salt, and thicken the gravy with cream or the yolks of eggs. Mushrooms Grilled. Time, about twelve minutes, to broil. 465. Six large mushrooms ; quarter of a pound of butter ; pepper and salt ; juice of a lemon.

Drain and serve it up on a slice of toast, with a tureen ol melted butter. Salsify, or Vegetable Oyster. Time, to boil, thirty to forty minutes. 467. Six ounces of butter ; two dessert- spoonfuls of white sauce ; a little pepper and salt; some vinegar or lemon juice. After you have washed and scraped the salsify very white, throw it into very weak vinegar and water, or lemon juice and water, for a few minutes ; then put it into a pan of boiling water with two ounces of butter, a little salt, and a tablespoonful of vinegar or lemon. When it is quite tender, put it to drain on a sieve ; then cut it into short pieces, and again put it into a stewpan with the white sauce, the remainder of the butter, and a little lemon juice. Shake it over the fire for a few minutes until it is well mixed and very hot, and serve it piled high in the centre of a dish, garnished with crofitons arranged round it. Horseradish. 468. Wash the horseradish very clean, and lay it in cold water for nearly an hour ; then scrape it into very fine shreds with a sharp knife. Place some of it in a glass dish, and arrange the remainder as a gar- nish for roast beef, or many kinds of boiled fish. Salad. 469. Yolk of one or two raw eggs ; one or two young onions, or leeks ; three table- spoonfuls of salad oil; one of vinegar; some lettuce ; and slices of beetroot; salt, and mustard. Take the yolk of one or two raw eggs, according to the size of the salad you require, beat them up well, add a little salt and mustard, and chop up one or two young onions, or leeks, about the size of grass, then add the salad oil and the vinegar, and beat the whole up into a thick sauce. Cut in the salad, and put thin slices of beetroot at the top. Sprinkle a little salt over it, and do not stir it up till the moment you use it. For a small salad three dessert- spoonfuls of oil, and one of vinegar, will do. Summer Salad. 470. Three lettuces ; a good quantity of mustard and cress ; some young radishes ; boiled beetroot; hard-boiled eggs. Wash and carefully remove the decayed leaves from the lettuces and mustard and cress, drain them well from the water, and cut them and the radishes into small pieces ; arrange them on a dish lightly with the mustard and cress mixed with them, andio6 Curing Bacon, Hams, &c. any of the salad mixtures you prefer poured under, not over them. Garnish with boiled beetroot, cucumbers, and hard-boiled eggs cut into slices, and some vegetable flowers. Slices of cold poultry, or flaked fish, may be added to a summer salad, and are ex- tremely good. Lobster Salad. 471. One hen lobster; lettuces ; endive ; mustard and cress ; radishes ; beetroot; cucumber ; some hard-boiled eggs. Pour the salad mixture into the bowl, wash and dry the lettuces and endive, and cut them fine ; add them to the dressing, with the pickings from the body of the lobster, and part of the meat from the shell cut into small pieces. Rub the yolks of two or three hard-boiled eggs through a sieve, and afterwards the coral of the lobster, then place the salad very lightly in the bowl, and garnish it with the coral, yolks of the hard-boiled eggs, sliced beet- root, cucumber, radishes, and the pieces of lobster. Place as a border hard-boiled eggs cut across, with the delicate leaves of the celery and endive between them. CUEING BACON, HAMS, &C.-POTTING, COLLARING, &c. The important art of pickling or salting meat culls for the housekeeper’s best atten- tion. There are many modes of doing it, both in England and America. In England, North and South make bacon in a different manner. In Hampshire, Wiltshire, and Berk- shire, they singe the hog. In Yorkshire, Lin- colnshire, &c., they scald the hog. Great care must be taken in preparing the meat for salt- ing. It must be carefully examined to see that it is fresh and good, then wiped, sprinkled with salt, and afterwards left to drain a few hours before it is rubbed with the salt. The meat will thus be thoroughly cleansed from the blood ; which will prevent it from turn- ing and tasting strong. It should then be placed in the pickling pan and turned every morning, also it should be rubbed with the pickle. The cover of the pickling-pan should fit very closely and have a weight on it to keep it down. If a large quantity of salt meat is frequently required, the pickle may be boiled up, skimmed well, and when cold poured over any meat that has been sprinkled and well drained as above directed. To Cure Bacon. Time, three weeks. 472. One pound of saltpetre ; one pound of bay salt; one gallon of coarse salt; one pound of salprunella ; one pound of moist sugar. Pound the salprunella and bay salt very ' fine, mix the coarse salt and the sugar well together, and rub it into your bacon, hams, and cheeks, puttfng all in the same brine. Turn and rub the bacon for a week every day ; afterwards every other day. Let it remain in the brine three weeks, and then send it to be smoked or dried. Large sides of bacon take a month to dry, small ones three weeks. To Cure Hams. 473. For two large hams one pound of common salt; three ounces of bay salt ; two ounces of saltpetre; one pound of coarse brown sugar; one quart of stale strong beer or ale. Boil all the above ingredients in the quart of beer or ale, and when cold pour it on the hams and turn them every day for a fortnight; then smoke them well. To Pot Beef. Time, three hours and a half. 474. Two pounds and a half of lean beef ; five ounces of butter ; pepper ; salt; mace. Take a piece of lean beef and free it from the skin and gristle, put it into a coveied stone jar with three dessertspoonfuls*of hot water, and stand it in a deep stewpan of boiling water to boil slowly for nearly four hours, taking care that the water does not reach to the top of the jar. When done, take it out, mince it fine, and pound it in a mortar with a seasoning of pepper, salt, and pounded mace. When smooth and like a thick paste, mix in some clarified butter and a very little of the gravy from the jar, press it into pots, pour butter over the tops, and tie down for use. To Pickle Pork. 475. One-third of saltpetre ; two-thirds of white salt. Some people prefer pork pickled with salt alone (legs especially), others in the following manner:—Put a layer of salt at the bottoin of a tub ; then mix the salt and saltpetre beaten ; cut the pork in pieces, rub it well with the salt, and lay it close in the tub, with a layer of salt between every layer of pork till the tub is full. Have a cover, just large enough to fit the inside of the tub, put it on, and lay a great weight107 Potting. at the top, and as the salt melts it will keep it close. When you want to use it take a piece out, cover the tub over again, and it will keep good a long time. To Cure Neats’ Tongues. Time, ten to fourteen days. 476. Three tongues; one ounce and a half of salprunella ; one ounce and a half of saltpetre; one pound and a half of common salt. Take three neats’ tongues, cut off the roots without removing the fat that is under the tongue, wash them very clean, and dry them in a cloth ; then rub them well over with the saltpetre and salprunella, and repeat this for three or four days. Cover them with a pound and a half of common salt, and let them remain for three weeks, turning them every morning. Wipe them dry, rub some dry bran over them, and hang them to smoke for a fortnight, or dress them out of the pickle. Potted Ox-tongue. 477. One pound and a half of boiled tongue; six ounces of butter; a little Cayenne ; a small spoonful of pounded mace ; nutmeg and cloves. Cut about a pound and a half from an unsmoked boiled tongue, remove the rind. Pound it in a mortar as fine as possible with the butter, and the spices beaten fine. When perfectly pounded, and the spice well blended with the meat, press it into small potting-pans, and pour clarified butter over the top. A little roast veal added to the potted tongue is an improvement. Hams, Tongues, and Beef, Yorkshire Fashion. 478. One pound and a half of ham sugar ; two ounces of saltpetre ; one pound of common salt; half a pound of bay salt ; two ounces of pepper. The meat should be well rubbed over night with common salt, and well rubbed in the morning with the above ingredients. If hams, they should be rubbed before the fire every day and turned. Potted Fowl and Ham. 479. Some cold roast fowl; a quarter of a pound of lean ham ; six ounces of butter ; pepper; salt; nutmeg, and a pinch of Cayenne. Cut all the meat from a cold fowl, and remove the bones, skin, &c., then cut it into shreds, with a quarter of a pound of lean ham and six ounces of butter, the pepper, salt, nutmeg, and Cayenne, and pound it all in a mortar until reduced to a smooth paste. Then mix it thoroughly together, fill the potting-pots, pour over them a thick layer of clarified butter, and tie them down with a bladder. Set them in a dry place, and it will keep good for sometime. A little grated lemon peel is an improvement to the fowl. Potted Head. Time, five or six hours. 480. Half an ox head ; two cowheels , pepper, salt, and mace. Take half a head, and soak in salt and water. When well cleansed from the blood, put it with two cow-heels into a large stew- pan, and cover them with cold water. Set it over the fire, and let it boil till tender. Strain the meat from the liquor, and when cold, cut the meat and gristle into very small pieces. Take all the fat from the cold liquor in which the meat, &c., was first boiled, put the mince with it, and boil the whole slowly till perfectly tender and thick enough to jelly ; give it a quick boil, and put it in shapes. Before boiling the second time, add pepper and salt to your taste, and a little pounded mace if ap- proved. Potted Herrings. Time, two hours. 481. Herrings; white wine vinegar; a few bay-leaves. Cut off the heads and tails of the fish, clean, wash, and dry them well, sprinkle them with pepper and salt within and without, lay them in an earthen pan, and cover them with white wine vinegar. Set them in an oven not too hot (the roes at the top, but they are not to be eaten), till the bones are quite soft, which will be in about two hours. Some cut the fish down by the bone so as to open them, and then roll them up from the tail to the head. The bay-leaves are an improvement, and a little water may be added to the vinegar if pre- ferred. Cover them with paper. To Pot Lobsters. Time, three-quarters of an hour to one hour to boil the lobster. 482. One lobster ; two ounces of butter ; Cayenne pepper ; mace and white pepper ; clarified butter. Take from a hen lobster the spawn, coral, flesh, and pickings of the head and claws, pound well and season with Cay- enne, white pepper, and mace, according to taste. Mix it to a firm paste with good melted butter. Pound and season the flesh, from the tail and put it into a pot, and then fill with the other paste. Cover the top of each pot with clarified butter, and keep it in a cool place.io8 To Make Pastes and Pastry. Potted Shrimps. 483. Shrimps ; pepper ; salt, and cloves. Shell the shrimps, season them with pepper, salt, and just a taste of pounded cloves, and put them down tight in pots, the closer the better, as it is not well for the butter to run in between them too much ; put a little butter over them, set them for a few minutes into a moderate oven, and when cold just cover them over with clarified butter. To Collar Beef. Time, six hours and a half. 484. Eight pounds of beef; a bunch of savoury herbs ; a large sprig of parsley ; pepper ; salt ; allspice, and nutmeg. For the ■pickle.—One ounce of saltpetre; two ounces of brown sugar ; seven ounces of salt. Take about eight pounds from a thin flank of beef, and rub it well with the above proportions of salt, saltpetre, and coarse sugar; turn and rub it every morning for ten or twelve days. Then take out the bones and gristle, chop very fine a large sprig of parsley, and a bunch of savoury herbs, pound a dozen allspice, and add it to the herbs with pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg. Mix it all well together, and lay it over the beef. Roll the meat up as tightly as you can in a round form. Cover it with a cloth, bind it with a wide tape, and boil it in a large quantity of water for six hours and a quarter. When done, put it between two boards, under a weight, and let it remain until cold. Then remove the tape and cloth, put a silver skewer through it, and it will be fit to serve for luncheon, or breakfast. Sprats Preserved like Anchovies. 485. To half a peck of sprats allow one pound of common salt; two ounces of bay salt; two ounces of saltpetre, one ounce of salprunella ; a pinch of cochineal. For half a peck of sprats, prepare the above seasoning pounded together in a mor- tar. If possible, the sprats should be fresh from the sea, not even wiped, unless brought from market. Arrange them in a pan, with seasoning between each layer of fish, press them tightly down, and cover them close, and in about four or six months they will be fit for use. For anchovy toast, or to make anchovy paste, fry them in butter, turning them carefully, not to break them.

A pudding-cloth must be kept very clean, and in a dry place. Bread-puddings should be at once answers best, and when the lard would froth too much add a little fresh before putting in any more. When all are done, save the lard in a basin, as it will answer, by adding a little more fresh, to use again. MINCE MEAT. Apple Mince Meat. 506.

LED PUDDING-S. tied very loosely, as they swell very much in boiling. The water must be boiling when the pudding is put in, and continue to boil until it is done. If a pudding is boiled in a cloth it must be moved frequently whilst boiling, otherwise it will stick to the saucepan. There must always be enough water to cover the pudding if it is boiled in a cloth ;Fruit Puddings. 112 but if boiled in a tin mould, do not let the water quite reach the top. To boil a pudding in a basin, dip a cloth in hot water, dredge it with flour, and tie it closely over the basin. When the pudding is done, take it from the water, plunge whatever it is boiling in, whether cloth or basin, suddenly into cold water, then turn it out immediately; this will prevent its sticking. If there is any delay in serving the pudding, cover it with a napkin, or the cloth in which it was boiled ; but it is better to serve it as soon as removed from the cloth, basin, or mould. Always leave a little space in the pudding basin for the pudding to swell; or tie the pudding cloth loosely for the same reason. Baked Puddings. Bread or rice puddings require a mode- rate heat for baking; batter or custard require a quick oven. The time needed for baking each particular pudding is given with the receipt. Eggs for puddings are beaten enough when a spoonful can be taken up clear from strings. Souffles require a quick oven. These should be made so as to be done the moment for serving, otherwise they will fall in and flatten. Apple, Gooseberry, Currant, or other Fruit Puddings. Time, one hour and a half. 509. One pound of flour ; six ounces of suet; water ; fruit. Make a paste as for beefsteak pudding, roll it out thin, and line a well-buttered basin with part of it, fill it with the apples pared and cored, a slice or two of lemon peel cut very thin, or a few cloves. Moisten the edges of the paste, cut out a piece and put it over the top, press it well together, and cut it neatly round that it may be of an equal thickness. Put the mould or basin into a floured cloth and tie it closely over. Then put it into a saucepan of boiling water and boil it. When done, turn it carefully from the basin on a hot dish. If boiled in a cloth, without a basin, the cloth must be dipped into hot water, dredged with flour, and laid into an empty basin, that the crust may be formed in it. All fruit puddings are made in the same manner, whether of gooseberries, currants, damson, greengages, &c. Baked Apple Pudding. 510.

Gather the edges up, and pinch them together over the apple. When all the dumplings are made, drop them into a saucepan of boiling water, and let them boil gently for nearly or quite an hour, then take each one care- fully out with a skimmer, place them all on a dish, and serve them quickly with butter, sugar, and nutmeg. To be eaten cut open, and the butter and sugar put into them. Baked Apple Dumplings. Time, three-quarters of an hour. 512. Some baking apples ; white of eggs ; some pounded sugar ; puff paste.

Twelve eggs ; two ounces of pow- dered sugar ; one dessertspoonful of orange- flower water ; one ounce of fresh butter. Separate the whites from the yolks of twelve eggs. Put the whites into a basin and beat them extremely fast till they form a very thick snow. Then beat six yolks separately, with two ounces of sugar, and a dessertspoonful of orange-flower water, or just enough to flavour it to your taste. Before beating the eggs have ready a round tin, well greased all over the inside with fresh butter. When you have finished beating the six yolks, mix them very quickly with the whites, lest the snow should turn—that is, melt into water. Put it then into the buttered tin, and place it in the oven. It will be so thick, if it is well and skilfully mixed, that there will be no fear of its running over. Watch it well; glancing at it from time to time through a little opening of the oven door, to see how it is going on ; as soon as it has risen very high, and is of a golden colour, take it out of the oven. Do not suffer the omelet souffld to remain long in the oven. If it is not watched it will fall in and become a mere galctlc. Let the oven be of a very gentle heat, or the bottom of the omelet will be burnt before the top is done. Before putting the tin in the oven, you may powder the snow with fine sugar; it crystallizes and produces a very pretty effect. As soon as the omelet is done it must be sent to table. If it waits for longer than ten minutes it falls in. The eggs should be beaten with a fork or a little whisk. If this souffle is liked a little more solid, add to the yolks of the eggs when beaten two dessertspoonfuls of rice boiled in milk, and flavoured with vanilla. In this case do not put in the orange-flower flavouring. The rice must be very well cooked, and well sweetened before it is added to the eggs. Friar’s Omelet. 616.

Let it boil one minute ; then put it into a jug that has a spout. When it is nearly cold, but not quite set, squeeze into it the juice of the lemon (or rather, squeeze the lemon in a cup and add it to the cream, lest a pip should fall into the jug). Pour it into the dish (from a jug with a spout) over the sweetmeat, and let it stand all night. Place on the top a few ratafias.

Fill it with a whipped straw- berry cream which has been drained on a sieve the preceding day, and put into the whip ripe strawberries. JELLIES AND SWEET DISHES. The Foundation of all Jelly. 6^4. One shilling packet of Nelson's gelatine ; half a pint of cold water; one pint of hot water ; the peel of five lemons ; one small stick of cinnamon ; six cloves ; juice of six lemons ; half a pint of sherry ; a quarter of a pound of loaf sugar ; whites of five eggs. Take a packet of gelatine, dissolve it in half a pint of cold water, and then add a pint of hot water, the peel of five lemons without the pith, a small stick of cinnamon, the cloves, the juice of the lemons, the sherry, and the loaf sugar. When done, clarify it with the shells and whites of five eggs. If you wish to make any other kind of jelly omit the sherry, and add for instance orange juice for orange jelly, or the juice of strawberries, cherries, pineapple, or any other fruit. The jelly takes its name from its flavouring. No jelly of several colours should be set warm, as the different colours run and weaken it extremely. Calf’s Feet Jelly. Time, to boil the feet, until reduced to one quart ; to reboil the jelly, a quarter of an hour. 625. Two calf's feet ; two quarts of water; half a pound of loaf sugar ; one pint of white wine ; a wineglass of brandy ; four lemons ; whites of four eggs. Cut two feet in small pieces after they have been well cleaned and the hair taken off. Stew them very gently in two quarts of water till it is reduced to one quart. When cold, take off the fat and remove the jelly from the sediment. Put it into a saucepan with half a pound of loaf sugar, a pint of white wine, a wineglass of brandy in it, four lemons with the peel rubbed on the sugar, tire whites of four eggs well beaten and their shells broken. Put the saucepan on the fire, but do not stir the jelly after it begins to warm. Let it boil a quarter of an hour after it rises to a head ; then cover it close, and let it stand about half an hour; after which, pour it through a jelly-bag, first dipping the bag in hot water to prevent waste, and squeezing it quite dry. Pour the jelly through and through until clear, then put it into the mould. Jelly from Co-wheels. Time, to boil the cowheels, seven hours, or until reduced to three pints; boil five minutes after the wine is added. 626.

When cold, skim off the cake of fat, and take the jelly carefully from the sediment at the bottom ; put the jelly into a stewpan with the white wine, loaf sugar, and the juice of the lemons. Beat up the whites of six eggs ; throw them into the jelly ; stir it all together, and let it boil five minutes. Then pour it into a jelly-bag, and let it run on the peels of four lemons placed in the basin the jelly runs into, as the peel will give a fine flavour and colour. If not perfectly clear, run it through again. Pour it into a mould, and turn it out the next day. Orange Jelly. Time, until it almost candies. 627. Peel of two Seville, two China oranges, and two lemons ; juice of three of each ; a quarter of a pound of loaf sugar ; a quarter of a pint of water ; two ounces of isinglass. Grate the rinds of the Seville and China oranges, and lemons ; squeeze the juice of three of each ; strain it, and add the juice to the sugar and the water, and boil it until it almost candies. Have ready a quart of isinglass jelly made with two ounces of isinglass ; put to it the syrup, and boil it once up. Strain off the jelly, and let it stand to settle before it is put into the mould. Clear Apple Jelly. Time, one hour and a half to boil the apples ; a quarter of an hour the jelly. 628. Two dozen and a half of pippins; one quart of spring water to every pint of129 SiOeet Dishes. juice ; three-quarters of a pound of loaf sugar ; ten ounces of isinglass ; the peel of one small lemon: Pare, core, and boil two dozen and a half of pippins in a pint and a half of water with the peel of a small lemon. When they are tender, pour the juice from the pippins, and strain it through a jelly bag; then put to the strained juice the sugar pounded, and the isinglass, boiled till dissolved in half a pint of water. Boil the whole in a very clean stewpan for about fifteen minutes, and then pour it into moulds. Riband Jelly—or Jelly of Two Colours. Time, three-quarters of an hour to make the jelly. 629. One quart of calf’s feet jelly ; a few drops of prepared cochineal. Have ready a quart of calf's feet jelly, flavoured in any way that may be preferred, leaving one pint of a pale colour, and adding a few drops of prepared cochineal to colour the remainder a bright red. Pour a small quantity of the red into a mould previously soaked in cold water. Let this set; then pour in a small quantity of the pale jelly, and repeat this until the mould is full, taking care that each layer is perfectly firm before pouring it on the other. .Put it in a cold place, and the next day turn it out; or the mould may be partly filled with the yellow jelly, and when thoroughly set, filled up with the pink. Riband jelly and jelly of two colours can be made in any pretty fancy mould ; there are many to be had for the purpose. Of course one colour must be always firm before the other is put in. In order to hasten the operation it is best to ice the jelly each time, by placing the mould in an ice-pail. Oranges Filled with Jelly. 630. Some large China oranges, and some jelly of two colours. With the point of a small knife cut out from the top of each orange a round about the size of a shilling ; then, with the small end of a teaspoon, empty the pulp from them, taking care not to break the rinds. Throw them into cold water. Make jelly of the juice pressed from the pulp, and strained quite clear. Colour one half a bright rose colour with prepared cochineal, leaving the other very pale. When the jelly is nearly cold, drain and wipe the oranges, and fill them with alternate stripes of the different coloured jelly. Each colour being allowed to get quite cold before the other is poured in. When they are perfectly cold, cut them into quarters with a very sharp knife, and arrange them tastefully on a dish, with sprigs of myrtle between them. Gateau de Pommes.

BAKING BISCUITS AND CAKES. An oven to bake well should have a re- gular heat throughout, but particularly at the bottom, without which bread or cakes will not rise, or bake well. An earthen basin is best for beating eggs, or cake mixture. Cake should be beaten with a wooden spoon, or spatula ; butter may be beaten with the same. Eggs should be beaten with rods, or a broad fork ; a silver fork, or one made of iron wire, is best, as it is broadest ; eggs should be clear and fresh for a cake. It is well, as a general rule in cake mak- ing, to beat the butter and sugar (which must be made fine) to a light cream ; indeed, in the making of pound cake, the lightness of the cake depends as much upon this as upon the eggs being well beaten ; then beat the eggs and put them to the butter, and gradually add the flour and other ingre- dients, beating it all the time. In common cakes, where only a few eggs are used, beat them until you can take a spoonful up clear from strings, In receipts in which milk is used as one ingredient, either sweet or sour may be used, but not a mixture of both. Sour milk makes a spongy light cake ; sweet milk makes a cake which cuts like pound cake. To blanch almonds, pour boiling water on them, and let them remain in it until the skins may be taken off; then throw the almonds into cold water to whiten them, drain them from the water, but do not wipe them ; the moisture will prevent their oiling. In making cakes, if you wish them to be pleasing to the palate, use double-refined sugar, although light brown sugar makes a very good cake. For icing cakes, the sugar must be rolled and sifted, or pounded in a mortar. To ascertain whether a cake is baked enough, if a small one, take a very fine splint of wood and run it through the thickest part; if not done enough, some of the dough, or unbaked cake will be found sticking to it; if done, it will come out clean.J33 Cakes. If the cake is large, pass a small knife-blade through it instead of the splint. Cakes to be kept fresh should be placed in a tin-box tightly covered, in a cool dark place. Icing for Cakes. 652. Whites of three eggs ; one pound of sugar ; flavouring of vanilla or lemon. Beat the whites of the eggs to a high froth, then add to them a quarter of a pound of white sugar pounded and sifted, flavour it with vanilla or lemon, and beat it until it is light and very white, but not quite so stiff as meringue mixture. The longer it is beaten the more firm it will become. Beat it until it may be spread smoothly on the cake. Spongecake. Time, three-quarters of an hour to one hour. 653. Five eggs ; half a pound of sifted loaf sugar ; the weight of two eggs and a half (in their shells) of flour ; one lemon.

To one pound of gooseberries allow one pound and a half of double-refined sugar, and one pint and a half of water. Pick off the black eye, but not the stalk, from the largest green gooseberries you can procure, and set them over the fire to scald, taking care they do not boil. When they are tender, take them out, and put them into cold water. Then clarify a pound and a half of sugar in a pint and a half of water, and when the syrup is cold, put the goose- berries singly into your preserving-pan, add the syrup, and set them over a gentle fire. Let them boil slowly, but not quick enough to break them. When you perceive the sugar has entered them, take them off, cover them with white paper, and let them stand all night. The next day take out the fruit and boil the syrup until it begins to be ropy. Skim it well, add it to the goose- berries, and set them over a slow fire to simmer till the syrup is thick.

To every pound of raspberries use the same weight of sugar, but always boil the fruit well before you add the sugar to it, as that will make it a better colour. Put the fruit in a preserving-pan, mashing it well with a long wooden spoon. After boiling it a few minutes, add the same quantity of sugar as fruit, boiling it half an hour, keep- ing it well stirred. When done, and suffi- ciently reduced, fill the jars, and when cold, cover them over with white paper moistened with white of eggs. To Preserve Greengages. Time, three-quarters of an hour. 684. To three pounds of greengages allow three pounds of sugar. Prick the plums with a fine needle, to prevent their breaking, put them into a preserving-pan with only sufficient water to cover them, and set them over a gentle fire until the water simmers ; then take them out and set them on a sieve to drain ; add to the water in which the plums were boiled the above quantity of pounded sugar, boil it quickly, skimming it as the scum rises, until the syrup sticks to the spoon. Then put in the greengages, and let them boil until the sugar bubbles, then pour the whole into a basin, and let it stand until the next day. Drain the syrup from the fruit, boil it up quickly, and pour it over the plums—repeat this for four days, then boil the fruit in it for five or six minutes, put them into jars, pour the syrup over them, and cover them over with brandy papers. The kernels must be blanched and boiled with the fruit. Rhubarb Marmalade. Time, three-quarters of an hour, if young rhubarb ; an hour and a half if old. 683.

Set it over a clear fire and boil it for twenty-five minutes, then pour it into a deep dish to remain all night. The next day repeat the boiling for half an hour ; do this for five or six days, and then drain them free from moisture on a sieve reversed. Make a rich syrup with sugar, water, and three ounces of whole ginger, just bruised, put the lettuces again into a preserving-pan, pour the syrup over them, and boil them several times until the stalks become clear, taking care the syrup is sufficiently strong of the ginger. Blackberry Jam. Time, three-quarters of an hour. 688. To every quart of blackberries, allow a pound of loaf sugar and a wineglass of brandy. Crush a quart of fully ripe blackberries with a pound of the best loaf sugar pounded very fine, put it into a preserving-pan, and set it over a gentle fire until thick, add a glass of brandy, and stir it again over the fire for about a quarter of an hour ; then put it into pots, and when cold tie them over. Barberry Jam. Time, three-quarters of an hour the first day. 689. Three pounds of sugar to three pounds of barberries. Pick the fruit from the stalks, and put them into a jar with their weight of pounded loaf sugar, set the jar in a deep saucepan of boiling water until the sugar is dissolved and the barberries quite soft; then let them stand all night. The next day put them into a preserving-pan and boil them for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes ; then put them into pots, tie them over, and set them in a dry place. Black Currant Jam. Time, three-quarters of an hour to an hour. 690. To every pound of currants allow three-quarters of a pound of sugar. Gather the currants when they are thoroughly ripe and dry, and pick them from the stalks. Bruise them lightly in a large bowl, and to every pound of fruit put three-quarters of a pound of finely-beaten loaf sugar ; put sugar and fruit into a pre- serving-pan, and boil them from three- quarters to one hour, skimming as the scum rises, and stirring constantly ; then put the jam into pots, cover them with brandy paper, and tie them closely over. Black Currant Jelly. Time, two hours. 691. To every five quarts of currants allow rather more than half a pint of water ; to every pint of juice one pound of loaf sugar. Gather the currants when ripe on a dry day, strip them from the stalks, and put them into an earthen pan, or jar, and to every five quarts allow the above proportion of water ; tie the pan over, and set it in the oven for an hour and a quarter; then squeeze out the juice through a coarse cloth, and to every pint of juice put a pound of loaf sugar, broken into pieces, boil it for three-quarters of an hour, skimming it well; then pour it into small pots, and when cold, put brandy papers over them, and tie them closely over. Bed Currant Jelly. Time, forty minutes. 692. To one quart of currant juice one pound of powdered lump sugar. Pick the currants from the stalks into a broad earthenware pan. To about one gallon of the picked currants put half a pound of sifted lump sugar. Put the sugar over the picked currants the day before you make the jelly. Set the currants over a slow fire to simmer gently for about twenty minutes ; the slower they simmer the greater quantity of juice they will discharge. There should be an equal quantity of red and white currants. When all the juice is discharged, strain it through a hair sieve, and then through a jelly bag while quite hot. Now to each quart of juice put one pound of powdered loaf sugar. Put it into a pre- serving pan, and set it over a quick stove to boil for twenty minutes. If any scum rises, skim it off. When done, put it into small white pots or little glasses, and cover it with brandied paper. Tie down. Orange Marmalade. Time, two hours and ten minutes. 693.

Put all the peels on the fire in aPreserving and Pickling. 139 preserving-pan, with a large quantity of water, and boil them for two hours, then cut them in very thin slices. While they are boiling press the inside of the oranges through a splinter sieve, narrow enough to prevent the seeds and skin from going through. When this is done, and the peels cut into the thinnest shreds, put the whole on the fire in a copper or brass pan, with eight pounds of loaf sugar broken small. Boil it all together for ten minutes, it may then be taken off the fire and put into preserving jars. To Preserve Cherries. 694. One pound of sugar to every pound of cherries ; and three tablespoonfuls of red currant juice. Lay some pounded sugar at the bottom of the preserving-pan, and place some cherries on it, then another layer of sugar, then of cherries, repeating this until all are in, leaving out a little of the sugar to strew in as they boil; add three spoonfuls of currant juice to each pound of fruit, and set it over a clear fire. B«il them quickly, shaking them round frequently to prevent their burning, but do not stir them. Takeoff the scum as it rises, and when the syrup is thick and they look clear, put them into pots, and when cold, cover them over. To Bottle Cherries. 695. Cherries ; three ounces of sugar to each bottle. Have ready some wide-mouthed bottles quite clean and dry ; cut each cherry from the stalk into the bottle, be sure not to pull them off. To every bottle of cherries put three ounces of powdered sugar, then tie them tightly over with bladder. After drawing the bread leave the oven door open. About nine o'clock at night put in the bottles and close the oven door. Take them out the first thing in the morning, and put them in a dry place for use. Apple Marmalade. Time, half an hour and ten minutes. 696. One peck of apples; one gallon of water to every quart of pulp; one pound of loaf sugar. Take a peck of apples full grown but not the least ripe, of all or any sort ; quarter them and take out the cores, but do not pare them ; put them into a preserving-pan with one gallon of water, and let them boil moderately until you think the pulp will run, or suffer itself to be squeezed through a cheese cloth, only leaving the peels behind. Then to each quart of pulp add one pound, good weight, of loaf sugar, either broken in small pieces or pounded, and boil it all together for half an hour and ten minutes, keeping it stirred ; then put it into pots, the larger the better, as it keeps longer in a large body. Rules to he observed in Pickling. 697. Procure always the best white wine vinegar. Orleans vinegar, although the dearest, is the best. The success of your pickles depends on the goodness of your vinegar. Use glass bottles for your pickles ; if earthen jars they must be unglazed, as the * vinegar acting upon the glaze produces a mineial poison. Use saucepans lined with earthenware, or stone pipkins to boil your vinegar in. If you are compelled to use tin, do not let your vinegar remain in it one moment longer than actually necessary. Employ also wooden knives and forks in the preparation of your pickles. Fill the jars three-parts full with the articles to be pickled, and then fill the bottle, or jar with vinegar. When greening, keep the pickles covered down, as the evaporation of the steam will injure the colour. A little nut of alum may be added to crisp pickles, but it should be very small in proportion to the quantity, or it will give a disagreeable flavour.

Put the peg in again immediately, and having prepared another three gallons of water just as you did before, pour it on the malt and set it by the fire as before, covered close, for two hours. As soon as you have emptied he second three gallons of water out of the boiler put into it the first run from the malt, and boil it a quarter of an hour with the hops. Strain it through a sieve into a shallow vessel to cool as quickly as possible. Run off the second three gallons, and boil them with the same hops for half an hour ; then strain and cool as for the first run. Mix both runs from the malt together ; add a small teacupful of yeast, and let it ferment for two or three days, during which time it must be frequently skimmed. Three pints of nice yeast will thus be obtained. When the fermentation is over, put the beer in a small cask, where it will probably ferment a little, after which stop it down close. R THE SICK. it all the time. A few lumps of sugar and the wine or brandy can be mixed with it before pouring the boiling water on it, using the wine or brandy to mix the arrowroot with instead of the water. Bread Jelly. 716.

Put the jelly into a stew- pan with the sugar, the juice of the lemons, and the peel of two ; add the gin. When the flavour is thoroughly drawn from the lemon peel, put in the whites of the eggs well beaten, and their shells broken up, place the stewpan over the fire, and let it boil for twenty minutes ; but do not stir it after the egg has been added. Dip a jelly bag into hot water and squeeze it dry ; run the jelly through it several times until quite clear, and then pour it into the mould. If calfs feet cannot be obtained, two ounces of gelatine and one ounce of isinglass will do as well. Barley Gruel. Time, twenty minutes. 729. Two ounces of pearl barley ; half a pint of water ; then three pints and a half of boiling water. Boil two ounces of pearl barley in half a pint of water to extract the colouring matter, throw this away, and put the barley into three pints and a half of boiling water, and let it boil till it is one half the quantity, then strain it for use.

Time, ten minutes. 738. Equal* quantities of soft soap and pearl-ash. Put the soap and pearl-ash on the chim- . ney piece with a soft flannel, let it lay on the marble for a few minutes. Wash it off with warm water not too hot; wash it over a second time with cold spring water. For Bright Polished Grates. ■ 739. Oil the bright part of the grate with good salad oil, dust over it some nnslacked lime from a muslin bag. Let it remain one month, then mb it off with a fine rag. Polish it with a leather and a very little putty powder. If the grate is not in use put on the oil again. To Take Stains out of Marble. 740. Mix unslacked lime in finest powder with the stronger soap-lye pretty thick, and irtStantly with a painter's brush lay it on the whole of the marble. In two months' time wash it off perfectly clean. Then have ready a fine thick lather of soft soap, boiled in soft water, dip a brush in it, and scour the marble with powder not as com- mon cleaning. This will, by very good rubbing, give a beautiful polish. Clear off the soap, and finish with a smooth hard brush till the end be effected. To Take Rust out of Steel. 741. Cover the steel with sweet oil well rubbed in, and in forty-eight hours use un- slacked lime finely powdered, and mb until all the mst disappears. To Cement Broken China. 742. Beat lime to a very fine almost in- visible dust, sift it through Ijpok muslin. Then tie it up in a piece o£ thin muslin as powdered starch is sometimes used. Brush some white of egg over the edges of the china, dust the lime rapidly over them, put the edges together, and 'tie a string round the cup, &c., till it is firm. Isinglass dissolved in spirits ofjdne, in the proportion of one ounce to' two wine- glassfuls-of the spirit, is also a good cemgpt. For Removing Paint from Wood. 743. Ong pound of washing soda ; two pounds of unslacked liipe. Mix one pound of washing soda with two pounds of unslacked lime, and if the paint is very strong on the wood add half a pound of potash. Mix these ingredients together, and dilqte with water until the mixture be-* comes rather, thicker than whitewash, and then rub it on the, painrwith a piece of wood fSlded up in rag. The person who uses this preparation must’be careful not to touch it with the hands. To Clean Paper-hangings. 744. Fir^t blow the dust off with the bel- lows. Dmde a white loaf of eight days old into eight parts. Take the crmjt into your hagd and, beginning at the top^f the paper; wipe it downwards in the lightest maimer with the crumb. Do not cross or go upwards. The dirt of the paper and the crumbs will fall together. Observe— you must not wipe above half a yard at a stroke, and after doing all the upper part “.go round again, beginning a little above where you left off. If you do not clean it very lightly you will make the dirt adhere to the paper. To Clean Glazed Chintz Furniture when taken down for the Summer. 745. Shake off the loose dust, then lightly brush with a small long-haired furniture bmsh ; after which wipe it closely with clean flannels, and rub it with dry bread. If properly done, the curtains will look nearly as well as at first, and if the colour be not light they will not require washing* for years. Fold in large parcels and put carefully by. While the furniture remains up it should be preserved from the sun and air as much as possible, which injure delicate colours ;146 Useful Receipts. and the dust may be blown off by bellows. By the above method, curtains may be kept sufficiently clean to make up again with new linings. To Remove Paint Stains from Glass Windows. 746. It frequently happens that painters splash the plate or other glass windows when they are painting the sills. When this is the case, melt some soda in very hot water and wash them with it, using a soft flannel. It will entirely remove the paint. Table Polish. 747. Half a pint of spirits of wine ; an ounce and a half of gum shellac; half an ounce of gum benzoin ; half an ounce of gum sandrac. Put the whole in a bottle for a day or two, and shake it a few times. When the gums are dissolved it is fit for use. When the polish is laid on thick enough, take a clean wad and cloth ; put a little clean spirits of wine on the wad, the same as you did with the polish, rub it the same way, but very lightly, and until quite dry. You must then put a little oil on the cloth, and rub as in laying on the polish. To Wash Coloured Prints and Washing Silks. 748. Put a little bran into lukewarm water, wash quickly through ; rinse in cold water also, quickly. Hang to dry in a room without fire or sunshine. Iron on wrong side \yith a coolish iron. No soap to be used.* To Clean an Old Silk Dress. 749. Unpick the dress, and brush it with a velvet brush. Then grate two large potatoes into a quart of water ; let it stand to settle; strain it off quite clear, and sponge the dress with it. Iron it on the wrong side, as the ironed side will be shiny. Wash for the Hair. 750. Half an ounce of glycerine ; half an ounce of spirit of rosemary ; five ounces of water. To be well mixed together and shaken, and used night and morning Castor Oil Pomade for the Hair. 751. Four ounces of castor oil; two ounces of prepared lard ; two drachms of white wax ; essence of jessamine, or otto of rose. Melt the fat together, and when well mixed, and becoming cool, add whatever scent you prefer, and stir it constantly until cold; then put it into pots or bottles for use. ' Cold Cream. 752. Half a pint of rosewater; four ounces of oil of almonds ; three drachms of white wax ; three drachms of spermaceti. Melt the white wax and spermaceti together with the oil of almonds. Then beat them all up, adding the rosewater slowly until it is cold. Put it in a pot, and pour some rosewater on the top. A Winter Soap for Chapped or Rough Hands. 753. Three pounds of common yellow soap ; one ounce of camphor dissolved in one ounce of rose and one ounce of lavender water. Beat three pounds of common yellow soap, and one ounce of camphor dissolved in one ounce of rose and one ounce of lavender water in a mortar until it becomes a paste. Make it into balls to dry, and set it in a cool place for the winter. The best time to make it is in the spring. Tooth Powder. 754. A quarter of an ounce of bole armoniac ; a quarter of an ounce of bark ; a quarter of an ounce of powdered cam- phor ; a quarter of an ounce of powdered myrrh. Mix the ingredients very thoroughly together. Tooth powders should be kept closely covered in wooden boxes. The prescription is for equal quantities of the above ingredients, but one ounce of the whole mixed is enough at a time, unless a chemist is not of easy access. Lavender Water. 755. Half a pint of spirits of wine ; a quarter of an ounce of oil of lavender ; one drachm and a half of essence of bergamot; one drachm of essence of ambergris. All to be well mixed together. Odor Delectabilis—For the Toilet. 736. Two ounces of rosewater; two ounces of orange-flower ; half a drachm of oil of lavender; half a drachm of oil of cloves ; one grain of musk ; one drachm of bergamot; half a drachm of essence of musk ; half a pint of rectified spirits of wine. Mix all together, excepting the essence of musk, which must be added after the mixture has stood for one week closely stopped.147 Mode of Folding Table-napkins. To Fold the Mitre.—The napkin must be folded in three, thus :—Fold one third over, turn it backwards, and thus make the three folds. Fold both ends to meet in the middle. Take the left-hand corner, a, and fold it across in a right angle. Take the opposite corner, b, on the left hand at the top, and fold it in the same manner ; you will thus form figure'i. Turn over and fold in halves lengthwise; open the points, and you will have figure 2. Bend the point, a, towards the right, and tuck it in the groove, c ; turn the point, b, backwards towards the right hand, and tuck it in as at a ; you will then have figure 3—The Mitre. The Water Lily.—Have a square napkin and fold it like a half handkerchief. Then take the two opposite points and make them meet on the centre one, which forms a square. Take the bottom corner, opposite the points, and roll it up as at figure 4. Turn the napkin over, and roll point a to about the centre. Take point b, and tuck it in the groove ; raise it, and you have figure 5—the Water Lily. Turn the corners over, and tuck them in at c and d. Turn back the second fold at the top—fig. 6. Napkin Folded for small '1 arts at the side and a Cake in the middle.—Have a perfectly square napkin ; turn the corners over so that they meet at the centre. Turn the four corners back to the edge, and you will have figure 7 ; carefully turn the napkin without unfolding it ; turn it over from two opposite sides into the centre at figure 8 ; turn it over again and make the other two ends meet in the middle you have then figure 9.ANALYTICAL INDEX, **■* The Roman figures refer to the number of the Page—the old-fashioned figures to the n umber of the Paragraph.

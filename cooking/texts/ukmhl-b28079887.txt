WELLCOME INSTITUTE LIBRARY Coll. welMOmec Call No. Q 1PREFACE. The Compiler has prepared this Work in consequence of several Persons having spoken to him of the great want of a Cookery Book, which could be placed in the hands of native cooks in foreign employ. It has been his endeavour to arrange the contents in such a systematic form as to ensure facility in use. It has not been without difficulty that the phraseology as well as the terminology employed in foreign cookery has been rendered into the equivalents in Chinese. Flowing sonorous periods and a high classical style have not been the objects aimed at, but the rendering of the Recipes in such a clear and simple style as to be readily understood by the average Chinese cook, who, though able, as a rule, to read and write, is not generally a highly educated individual. The foreign resident can thus order any Dish, by showing to his Cook the Chinese translation, of the English Recipe, and get what he wants, provided the Cook closely follows the instructions given. The Compiler, as this is a new departure, will be pleased to receive any suggestions, which those who may use the Book may think would render it more useful. The manuscript has been ready for publication for the last eighteen months, but circumstances have prevented it being printed sooner. HongkongNovember 1890. J. DYER BALL.«CONTENTS. -O' SOUP.

GENERAL DIRECTION'S. -f+ SOUP should never be made of meat that has been kept. All meat and hones for Soup should be boiled a long time, and set aside, and the fat removed, then add the vegetables or rice, and boil it an hour to an hour and a half. The water in which fresh meat is boiled should be used for Soup, and the bones of roast beef make excellent Soup. # # 2 & «o n& z ft « » m # + yAo m jw & m * m + «^<aa5.± — » -?0 # an ;£ wl & ® Mh ffl ft,A RICH SOUP. mHE richest soups are made by using several kinds of meat together; as I beef, mutton and veal. A shank of each of these with very little meat upon it, should be boiled several hours, and vegetables with various kinds of spice added. Nice soups should be strained ; and they are good with macaroni, added afterwards, and boiled half or three-quarters of an hour. If you have the water in which chickens have been boiled, the soup will be much better if the beef, and mutton, are boiled in this, instead of pure water. ft. 'Ko ^ m ^ m m ft. ft m - ¥ 1m flfi.

Wash four leeks and shred them up finely. As these vegetables are prepared, they should be thrown into cold water to keep them fresh. Take two onions, peel them and stick two cloves into one onion. Skim the soup well, and then put in the vegetables. Add a blade of mace, and a teaspoonful of pepper corns. Move the saucepan to the side of the fire and let it gently simmer for two hours-and-a-half. Raise the lid slightly to let out the steam. {Continued on ‘page 7).

It is better to boil the macaroni separately. To prepare the macaroni, put a saucepan on with water to boil. When quite boiling, put in a quarter of a pound of macaroni and sprinkle about half a saltspoonful of salt over it. Put on the fire and boil till the macaroni is quite tender. It will take about half an hour. When sufficiently boiled, strain off the water. Pour some cold water on it and wash it, put it on a board and cut into small pieces about a quarter of an inch in length. Put the macaroni into a soup tureen and strain the hot soup over it.

Pour in five pints of water, and put in one teaspoonful of salt. This will assist the scum to rise. Put the pot on the fire with the lid on, and let it come to the boil quickly. Remove all the scum with a spoon. Draw the pot rather to the side of the fire and let it simmer gently for five hours. Take two young carrots, scrape clean with a knife, and cut into slices. Take one young turnip, peel it, and cut it in slices. Take half a head of celery and one leek, wash them well in cold water, and cut them in squares. Take one cauliflower, wash in cold water, and put in a basin of cold water with a dessertspoonful of salt for two or three minutes, then take it out, and squeeze it dry in a cloth. Next cut off all the green leaves and the stalk, and pull the flower into sprigs. Skim the soup occasionally, and add a little cold w'ater to make the scum rise. Add the vegetables an hour before serving. First put in the sliced carrots, and the cut up celery and leek, as these take the longest to boil. In half an hour add the sliced turnips, and fifteen minutes after that the cut up flower of the cauliflower. Put a saucepan full of hot water on the fire to boil. When the water is quite boiling, put in one gill of shelled peas, a teaspoonful of salt, and a quarter of a saltspoonful of Carbonate of soda, and let it boil from fifteen to twenty minutes, according to the age of the peas. Then feel them, and if quite soft, take them out and drain them in a colander. Put the boiled peas into a hot tureen and ladle the soup and other vegetables over them into the tureen. kmm a 2 # ffl fi.ffl ® II if It $1 A A 7J Pi 7J ©35 m ❖ & a m <ft »tr m m it- m U ft mM H Jit H lit Sfc BE * SI fe, ffl «,jlt ft E ft # ft K m.ffi ft. m + m a m m »si $ s t & a 2 m MM & a a ftije rs si %— 13 — fl T ft ;1 X c gj - D$, S S’ I Z ft M 3k — U, m z * 5p r w. « «. f Hti St M Z w 0 lit !» St & It # ab *S 5ft M Sc ^ lit — g 10 IflT £ X. £. at.it x « ft1 H sft 10 — X, 54 %, 1$ 15c X ft 4s- it T JHft To £? - |.| $c St X. t m x X It m 2: £r ffl t; j» T jr «. ft Hi. x ig. m hh m m m m: m x t® ft M Xo W T0 ‘ft T H T.

BOILED FISH. WASH the fish thoroughly clean in cold water. When the water is warm, put the fish on a strainer or plate (there should be sufficient water just to cover the fish). Put in enough of salt to make the water taste salt. Put the lid on the saucepan, and move it to the side of the fire to simmer gently for twenty minutes to three-quarters of an hour (according to the size of the fish). Skim it occasionally. When the skin of the fish is cracking it is sufficiently boiled. Take the fish carefully out of the saucepan and place it on a hot dish and pour the sauce into a sauce- boat or round the fish. The melted butter sauce is made as follows :— Put one ounce of butter into a stewpan and put it on the fire. When melted, stir in half an ounce of flour. Mix smoothly with a wooden spoon. Pour in a gill (quarter of a pint) and a half of cold water, and stir the sauce smoothly until it boils and thickens. ft IS £ yft $ 2l PPi.fi ftj.iij ft tL0^0ft #. ffi it 4=- ii- -far,W M M ffl 1 »,s m m m pt m m m * * m th** m & w * r & is& w 41 1?.® $8 ® i§ H ft fs,H & & * it, * z. * a,m -t & #,z m i® 7 H.if % ® s m ‘X & tfl,# ffl w,*.

Have ready enough melted lard to entirely cover the fish. Place the frying pan over a clear fire. Let the lard reach boiling point, and then immerse the fish in it. You may try whether the fat is hot enough by letting a drop of cold water fall into it. If the hot fat spits, it is ready for use. Then fry, turning the fish (when one side is browned) to the other. When it is done lay it on a cloth, or on white blotting paper, to drain off all the fat; or put it on a reversed sieve for a little while.

WASH the sole well, and lay it on a board. With a sharp knife cut off all the outside fins, the head, and the tail. Take the skin off. Slide the knife along carefully between the flesh and the bones, holding the flesh in one hand and drawing it away as the knife cuts it from the bone. Do both sides of the fish alike, and it will make four fillets. Put each fillet separately on a plate, and rub it over with flour. Take a wire sieve, and stand it over a piece of paper. Take some crumbs of bread and rub it through the sieve. Beat one egg on a plate with a knife. Lay the fillets in the egg, and egg them well all over with a brush. Put them in the bread crumbs, and cover them well. Be careful to finger them as little as possible. Take a saucepan, and put in it one pound and a half of lard. Put the saucepan on the fire to heat the fat. Test the heat of it by throwing in a piece of bread, and if it makes a fizzing noise it is ready. Place the fillets in a frying basket. They should be folded over. When the fat is quite hot, put in the frying basket with the fillets for three minutes. Put a piece of paper on a plate. When the fillets are done they should be a pale brown. Turn them out on to the paper on the plate, to drain off the grease. Serve them in a hot dish on a napkin, garnished with a little fried parsley. The fried parsley is prepared in this manner:—Take a few sprigs of parsley, wash them, dry them in a cloth, and put them into the frying basket. Toss the basket with the parsley into the boiling fat for a second. The anchovy sauce is prepared as follows:—Take a stewpan and put into it one ounce of butter and half an ounce of flour. Mix them well with a wooden spoon. Add a gill and a half of cold water. Put the stewpan on the fire, and stir well with a— 19 FRIED FILLETS OF SOLE—continued. wooden spoon until the mixture is quite smooth and boils. Take the stewpan off the fire. A quarter of an ounce of butter stirred into the sauce at the last very much improves it. Add one tablespoonful of anchovy sauce and stir it well into the butter sauce. For serving, put it in a sauce boat. m m «m m m tt m « m WoM. — HUt ffi.vft 4 k nt m m - $ m ± a m # k n m m ft - «>£),#, m 5 2 # f M ^ fc.tH.Jfc M in m fft M ft * 7) ffl fid T - * — m mni&T item® m *t> -k m fS>«! « 3kM M F $ « lx. $e a m m & # is* j§ « ® is«e$ is. «.±v 515 £>J » tt.7? « ®fc » ft*.— # X ffl B§ rn s. lit IS We F ft & £» w «. ft W ttl Si * m m »is ft ®>k mm $4 « ^ e.ai * £ » & % ft vftoft - s & * « * # «#.2 = isi s m m w»« pj ® m n4 m a # m ®t ^ ft.gfe a ?#,£ 4. * a ^JoBt.s ®m±.zMmmm ±,m m m. m w m m % m m # m. a m to m we a 4 is, ft ^1. -ii & - # w :& *f $ ^ $ m tfc ft ^ SI if i£ m im — » f« % 4 $ m 4 n n w t is #. n ^ vft *8 H Jfc *t fe, a *■ Hi ft Jg 15) ft tHF *f.- ** « * ft $: #c IK, ft $ ft i$: M ft ft0)i0*ft 4 ft m vis 4 ^ ffl mm si ^ »,b.*0± s m m it #. ii. ei m ^ =0jg in is ^ E.fft - f? jsl m # 7J— no — CUTLETS OF SOLE.

TO roast in a cooking stove, it is necessary to attend carefully to the fire, lest the meat should burn. Lay it into the pan with three or four gills of water -in it. Turn the pan round often, that all the parts may roast equally. When it is about half done, (having already floured it well before putting it into the oven) flour it again, turn it over that the lower side may become brown. If the water wastes so that the pan becomes nearly dry, add a little hot water. It is necessary to have everything hot on the table. It is often the case, that a well cooked dinner loses much of its excellence, by a want of care in this particular. All the meat and vegetable dishes should be heated, and the plates should also be warmed. * m Z g. « m ■fr Z ' i^i itt m T B$,Z m R z Mom _ _ m f mm m ® % n$,pj m m m # sz a itz^sm So# m ^ a i to ^ it,i .if ® o s* “■ Wc A: it ft P yff M H U lit f? ft.

ALL kinds of meat are best put over the fire in cold water, in the proportion of a quart to every pound of meat. The fire should be moderate, and the water should heat gradually. If it boils in thirty or forty minutes it is soon enough. All kinds of meat, poultry, and fish should boil very slowly. Fast boiling makes meat tough. Allow twenty minutes to a— 31 ON BOILING MEAT—continued. pound of fresh meat; but a little more time is required to cook a hind than a fore-quarter. Salt meat should boil longer than fresh ; allow forty minutes for every pound. A tongue that has been cured with saltpetre and smoked, should soak over night, and be boiled at least four hours. A ham, if very salt, should also be soaked over night, and should be boiled from three to five hours according to the size, unless you prefer to cook it the last half of the time in the oven. The two things most important in boiling meat, are, to boil it gently, and to skim it till no more froth rises. To do this have a spoon and dish, and the moment the froth begins to rise skim it off. Put in a pint of cold water, which will cause it to rise more freely, and continue to skim it every minute or two, till all is taken off. If the water boils fast before you begin to take off the froth, it will all return into the water, and will adhere to the meat, and make it look badly. m M.jg m ii tK.A m S rn.

TO have gravy free from fat is the most important thing. In case yon are roasting beef or mutton, pour off entirely, into a dish, half an hour before the dinner hour, all the contents of the dripping pan, and set it away in a cold place. Remove all the fat from the top, and put the liquid that remains at the bottom into the pan. Wet some browned flour smooth, and when you take out the meat, set the pan on the top of the stove. The gravy will immediately boil, and the wet flour must then be stirred in. It will boil away fast, therefore see that it does not stand too long. Gravy for poultry is made by boiling the giblets (necks, gizzards, hearts, and livers) by themselves in five or sis gills of water. Skim them carefully. After an hour, or hour and a half, take them out, and pour the water into the dripping pan. Mash, or chop the liver fine, and when you make the gravy, add this, and a bit of butter, some pepper, and the wet flour. The fat that roasts out of a turkey should be dipped off with a spoon before these ingredients are added. In making gravy for a goose, pour off all the drippings as in roasting beef, and put in some of the meat liquor. To brown flour put it into the frying pan and set it in the oven or on the top of the stove; stir it often lest it should bum. When it is a light brown, put it into a jar, or wide-mouthed bottle. nMn £ Hi ML it ISJ M ft © ft « m z m m #e # m *6 * R.ne a n- PI S J§ if? is^M * R it,& m itt m ttofli s p be f ^ zm mm- o33 — jfi,$ $.9f ® ii[ SI# &0M © m jS ft2 hr j« it Ja A *o& ±.» 9> $t nt„* M M *,#■ **.M ft. 2 rn 1m tt* M £1 ft it $1 SR & O fe® n#.^ #,siSo# # * Jfc i+ O Jffi n?f,z B#,,i zzmufis * JR * A # ± 0r I* W p A>n#.S.3E Mf.

FOR turkeys, chickens, partridges, and pigeons, take bread enough to make three gills of fine crumbs. Cut off the crust and lay by itself in just enough boiling water to soften it. Rub the soft part into crumbs; put in a teaspoonful of salt, a little pepper, and a piece of butter half as large as an egg. Add the softened crusts, and mix the whole together very thoroughly. If it is not moist enough, add a spoonful or two of milk. If there is not seasoning enough, add more. To put into a fowl neatly, and without waste, use a teaspoon. Stuffing for ducks is usually made with a little finely chopped onion in it. For a goose, sage should be used.— 34 — m » s # * ift - m n a ^ fig ic #, il £ * Jm 7J ss ft-’K A A #0*n pf o e* & as <1.9 is - 81. w , O g0« 81 H 5tB - 09.13] IS R fl- - - 8I>&0 ■&tA a A 81 A\ M ?;rt #■ it.ffl A,j£ El ffl 4M!Utt ® to A»$§ til -® s$ JS SI, st?i«o^s^-st*ic j» t*. a *.e *£ gg uh m m z * m m st si. ®slASii-I &M ;£>£ f® FB m ■£ =#,* PS S x i!M§ PS IS «i M M Fli MU ^5 §g0® 5$ 4" ❖ IS #,|B #. ffl a a ^.g m s &.# ROAST BEEF.

Put the saucepan on the fire and let the potatoes just boil; be careful they do not burn. Take any scraps of cold meat, cut them in small pieces, and put them in a pie dish in layers. There should be some fat with the meat. Take one small onion, peel it, and chop it up as finely as possible. Sprinkle each layer of meat with pepper and salt, and a little of the chopped onion. Fill the dish half full of cold water. If there is any cold gravy it would be better than water. The pie dish should be quite full of meat, and rather heaped in the centre. Take the mashed potato and put it over the top of the meat, smoothing it over neatly with a knife. Take a fork, and mark all over the top of the potato.

When the lard is quite hot and smoking, take the slices of meat, dip them in the batter so that they are quite covered, and then drop them into the hot fat. Too many slices must not be put in at once, as they should not touch each other. Turn them over, so that they are fried a nice brown on both sides. As the fritters are fried, take them carefully out of the fat with a perforated spoon and put them on paper to drain off the grease. Be careful to skim the fat from time to time, or the little loose pieces of batter will burn and spoil the fat.

Having washed the heart, liver, &c., boil them an hour and a half in a saucepan in a pint of water, skim them when the water first boils up; if it boils away add more. To make the gravy, take out the heart and gizzard, mash the liver, and put it back into the water in which it was boiled, and pour the gravy also out of the roasting pan into it; set it on the coals, add browned flour, wet smooth, and a little butter and pepper, and boil it a minute or two, and then serve it. The liver should never be put under the wing, or laid upon the dish, but always be used in the gravy, as the latter is greatly improved by it. tk # £ H l3j A, % m ftolt ®T f§ fill 'go ± o 3. fi/r II W W m m it» 'f g pf it tk M A iffo m ft, A pf m tk an |E| % il n m ^ Mo m iioO ®\ X fa 4\ ^ m m $ it. * o m m m m Hi it, to. ^ ik M a m ft.ffi, * w ® <s IK m tk m ^ lej fF - ‘Km - iflo A M Isl b$, #s a ® ^ w 4 m it, m m m n m m £ &\m z m A, n ‘X BE m m w n w.a m m # m m Z «Hj,±o4o:S' b$, Hi o m ±> m & is. % $ t Sistlffll !tf if to 4- Hi 8E f H i BE K & W.

The potatoes can be passed through the sieve much quicker while they are hot. Put one ounce of butter, and a tablespoonful of milk into a stewpan, and put it on the fire. When the milk and butter are hot, stir in smoothly the sifted potato. Take the stewpan off the fire, and stand it aside. Break two eggs, put the whites in a cup (as they are not required for present use), and stir the yokes, one at a time into the potato in the stewpan. Take two or three sprigs of parsley, wash them in cold water, dry them in a cloth, and chop them up finely on a board (there should be about a teaspoonful). Sprinkle the parsley into the stewpan, and season the potato with pepper and salt. Turn the potato mixture on to a plate, and stand it aside till cold. Put one pound of lard into a deep stewpan, and put it on the fire to heat. ■ Be careful it does not burn. Take some crumbs of bread, and rub it through a wire sieve on to a piece of paper. When the potato mixture is cold, form it into croquettes or balls, according to taste. Break an egg on to a plate, and beat it up slightly. Dip the croquettes into the egg, and brush them well over with it. Then roll them in the bread-crumb3, being careful to cover them smoothly, and not too thickly. Take a frying basket, and arrange the croquettes in it. Finger them as little as possible, and do not allow them to touch each other. When the fat on the lire is quite hot and smoking (test the heat bv throwing in a piece of bread, which should fry brown directly), put in the frying basket for two minutes, or so, to fry the croquettes a pale yellow. Put a piece of paper on a plate, and as the croquettes are fried turn them on to the paper to drain off the grease. Put three or four small sprigs of parsley (washed and dried) into the frying basket, and just toss the basket into the boiling fat for a second or so. For serving, arrange the croquettes on a hot dish, with the fried parsley in the centre. mm k- i ti mu#og i s I ft, A k ffl III rn IIS m W 4 o ff.SAl § Ifc £,#.4- a m 4 » m m iumts m & m & § w m 4 H 4 h — tf 4 ft„1H ±.« Si 5$ mzmM m>M siiiis 4 £ 4 4,4 t* 1? if 4 hi,If tt ff ^ Jt>. &>— 63 ft £ W- ® IS Si *t ‘X If M $ M> in m z tr.ift « !$ =ffj $Si f- gt.'/ft ft A S — M n »&.% j£ m ®>wm «,es ^ ^ 3 S1 ss !£,-# m m m * f- ^»*r t«ssi| $ ^ 0 §! h# pf S ill li <1- H "i1!

THE flour should be sifted. The best looking pastry is made with lard, but it is not so healthy, or good as that which is made with half or two thirds butter. Whichever is used, rub a third of it into the flour, but do not try to rub out every lump; the less the hands are used, the better. Add cold water; in summer, ice water. If the crust is shortened wholly with lard, add a teaspoonful of salt to a pound of flour, and a small teaspoonful of soda to every three pounds. Sprinkle the salt into the flour, and dissolve the soda in the water. If butter only, or chiefly is used, omit the soda. When the water has been put in, stir it quickly, rather stiff with a knife. Do not mould it; it will make it tough, but when it is barely stirred together, put it on the board, roll it out, lay thin shavings of butter on every part, sprinkle a little flour over it, and roll it out again, then lay on butter as before. To avoid much handling of the crust, roll it so thin, that ah the butter will be taken up by two or three times rolling in. When it is all rolled in, fold up the crust in a long roll, and double it, laying the ends together; then lay it aside, and cut from it for each pie. In rolling out for the plates, press the pin equally, so as to make all parts of the same thickness, and as nearly circular as possible. Have the plates ready buttered, or greased with lard, lay in the crust, and see that •all parts touch the plate. Take the dish upon the palm of the left hand, and with the right trim the edges, holding the knife under, and aslant, and so cut the crust that the edge of the dish will be perfectly covered. With regard to the proper thickness of pie crust—A pie in which the fruit forms one third of the thickness, and the two crusts the other two thirds, although it may look nicer, is neither so healthful, or good as one made with thinner crust and plenty of fruit. Some fruit requiies thicker crust than others; for apple, peach, &c. it should be thin as a plate, for juicy fruits, such as berries, cherries, plums, and for mince, it should be a little thicker. Lay some of the trimmings round the rim of the plate to make the edge of the pie look well, and put the rest by themselves, and when there are enough, roll them out for an under-crust. In making cherries, currants, &c. into pies, use deep dishes, and be careful not to fill them even full, as the syrup will boil over, and thus much of the richness of the pie be lost. There is one way to prevent the loss of syrup. After laying in the fruit, or mince, and rolling out the upper-crust, wet the rim- 80 PASTRY—continued. of the under-crust all round with cold water, not omitting a single spot, (if you do the syrup will escape at that spot), and sprinkle a very little flour upon it, lay the trimming upon the rim, wet and flour that in the same manner, then lay the upper-crust immediately over, and press it down gently upon the rim. The flour and water act as a paste to fasten the crusts together. Trim the edge as before, and prick the top eight or ten times with a fork. This is necessary for the escape of steam, and without it, the closing of the edge wall not avail to keep in the syrup. It is a good way to invert a teacup in the centre of a juicy fruit-pie. A clammy lower crust is neither good nor digestible. Therefore never fill pies made of moist materials until just before putting them into the oven. Pie crust becomes yellow from standing long before being baked; therefore delay rolling out the upper crust for any kind of pies until the oven is nearly ready. Pastry should be baked in a quick oven to be light, and be slightly browned to be healthy. It is difficult to make flaky crust in warm weather. But cooling the butter and water with ice, and making up the pastry in a cool place will insure tolerable success. ffl m it m m m m m z m.-g,n, m * 4 * z m m M ® ffl m vft.vft m ** & m m z n m m m m m HR a $ m a * st» & if '>\- o m.# a, - hsls i i i » a m » s t» m m n tr m & % js,® a a, itt m 7i je <&•,»,» » g,B & M»{ _ mm b.b m a ^ m « z. it a ^ n m & m m & - nf 41 ® ^ A 46 ^ f*,HS ® fflJifcSI^Bd1**: it.® » ^ ®,*i <f # ffl m.ffi DR B # X O S.S ft $ H,- ffl » fi = B ft ft SI ft mo& » ft in B * IB m ft, ft K ^ 'R 'P ffl ft.ft SfflSAZ SHE ^ * fr IS ».« ¥ » 5tt *— 81 * m * K « in.'/o n 1 f f i ^ S & « m pi # m § t v®.w - f m » f it lit ® ± ± ✓j,- ® pf -tkoK I? iffi $RM StIOS |e OAiiOtf f 7J.V® £ fi gf gf p — li. ;£ if hK fffi J£ SB •P If jg.a £ it m m'n ffl & = & % »•£ 2 x * ;l aJps'».* S o°* « IS ft* * 5 g f |»IA tti«— ffl #*ft T' ^ $ *®»® ff *& & 15 ril % PJ *it W lit SI US K ¥ # f4 = ^ ^ 11 f f t # * m * JR J^i$n ffi ZV% 1it J?

THE eggs for all sorts of puddings should be well beaten. If hot milk is used, the eggs should be added after all the other ingredients. When suet is used in puddings, it should be chopped as fine as possible. For a pudding cloth, the seam should be stitched close with a coarse thread on one side, and then turned and stitched again on the other, m order to secure the pudding from the water. When used, let the seam be outside. A strong twine, a yard long, should be sewed on about three inches from the top of the bag or cloth. When it is to be used, wring it in cold water, and sprinkle the inside thick with flour. It may be spread with butter, and then floured. After which lay it in a dish; pour in the batter, and tie up the bag or cloth quickly, drawing the string as tightly as possible. Allow a little room for the pudding to swell. Lay it immediately into the boiling pot, and after ten minutes, turn it over to prevent the flour from settling on one side. If there is fruit in the pudding, it should be turned three or four times during the first half hour. Keep it covered by adding boiling water if necessary, and be careful that it boils steadily. If it does not, the pudding will be watery. When you take it up, plunge it for a moment in a pan of cold water, then pour off the water, untie the twine, and gently lay back the top of the bag. Have a dish ready, and turn the pudding out upon it. % «.o * i ft 0.g f % m Hi q- m is M si.fl 2 2 2 &• § y, -e H — ^ S ® ^ tfe % M ® ffl IS Jn 4- § ^ IS M wBo-S tt 31* - m m ^i.*t & m»» f o gg— 88 — m & m * m & *r & ® e * p»i <s »,& ja mi & M m tf Mom m ®t.#n m el m » ^ ® s m ^Bio* a,&„# s « m ^ mm & m,m ifc.0 SB. £■„* tr m - w - *o®.ra ■?.« ioi^ 5^.* %t % (i m m vt.z p z z %,m 7km^-z®!zm m Bf,® is * z n a.^,jfc im « m z m m m b$,® & % %£ si s ^ s ■*»« ffl ^ 2 # s ® i ^ PUDDING SAUCE. rnO four large spoonfuls of fine white sugar, put two of butter, one of I flour, and stir them together to a cream in an earthen dish.

WHEN making pies and cakes, the first thing to be done is to build the fire and get the oven just right. Then sift the flour and measure it; count and break the eggs; measure everything that is to be put into the cake; lard the pans, and line them with paper. If butter is put into the cake, the order in which the different ingredients should be put in is as follows, viz.—Beat the butter to a cream, and then add the sugar gradually, then spice and any kind of liquor which you use, then the milk, then the eggs well beaten, then the flour, in which always mix thoroughly while dry, the soda and cream of tartar; and, if fruit, let that always be the last thing to be added. 6 m 3k » §& I# & Hi. # m i6 #*. tr » a w m» a 4 * t s is a i wm ® « Em » & tk m m m f? trJJti fottoifc m. & ® * ii in ft w > # o #r 44 IE 4 « tr ffi 4 ’/ft. * H K ^ o SfiTiKtf - | W.zPLAIN FROSTING. PLACE the whites of one, two, or more eggs in a bowl. Throw into them a tablespoonful of pulverised white sugar. Beat with a wooden -spoon, adding sugar by the spoonful, and beating well between the -additions. It is impossible to state the exact amount of sugar, as the size and freshness of eggs vary so much; but use about one cupful of sugar for one white of an egg. If, when drawing the end of a knife-blade through the frosting on the back of a spoon, it leaves a clean-cut line, consider the frosting sufficiently beaten. It is best to frost cake while it is warm. Spread over the cake a thin coating of the frosting, with a long thin knife. This fills the pores, and the heat of the cake melts the sugar, causing the frosting to cling very securely. Next put on with a spoon s ifficient to cover the cake, spreading evenly over the whole surface. After smoothing, set in a cool place to harden. Lemon juice is the nicest flavouring.120 — fi If # In, A — f# 1? ® |$5 'fikiW, ft »«r«U8M»fcK»^:»IS3^lf*AS- 5* if 2$ K tt.M # * £ & 3*. a itk * z m m.m m #.s m st it ® »,m ■tiioH if u#, pTo# ® # w a — a m m mwmA,*.#*, az a. i#,7J J? 3.Q OS®M, MARGARET CAKE.

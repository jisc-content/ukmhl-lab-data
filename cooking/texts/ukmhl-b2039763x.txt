Third Street.PREFACE. The following receipts, the result of many years experience, have been placed before the public, in the hope that they may prove useful to all who may consult them, and under the conviction that they will be found truly practical. The author has endeavored to draw them up in the most concise and simple manner ; and has in all cases sacrificed style to minute detail; not even avoiding repetition w^here it might render the di-- rections more explicit. A great defect in many v;orks of a similar cha* racteris, that the cook is forced to wade through a formidable amount of reading before she can learn the process of making a pudding, or discover the different articles necessary to the concocting of a dish. Whilst some are so diffuse, others on the oppo- site extreme, are so brief in their explanations as to fall far short of beino- understood, and conse- quently are ever liable to misconception. As no utensils are requisite except those in com-mon use in every family, the difficulty of pieparihg the various dishes will be greatly lessened. Great attention has been paid to that department of cookery exclusively adapted to the sick or con- valescent, most of the dishes having been prepared according to the directions of eminent physicians of Philadelphia. Nearly all the receipts in this book are purely American; the author therefore entertains a hope that they may meet the wants of the community, and the approbation of all those who may honor them with a trial.

All soups are better to be made with fresh un- cooked meat, as that which has been cooked once has lost much of its flavor and nearly all its juices. It is therefore better economy to hash or spice your cold meatj and buy fresh for soup. Soup should not boil very hard, as that has a tendency to toughen the meat. Fat meat is not so proper nor healthy for soup as the leaner parts of the finest meat. The fat does not impart much flavor, and is not palatable. Soup may be kept till the next day; before it is heated over again, skim ofl* the cake of fat which congeals on the top. It is often preferred one day old to the day it is cooked. BEEP SOUP. 1. Crack the bone of a shin of beef, and put it on to boil in one quart of water to every pound of meat, and a large tea spoonful of salt to each quart of water. Let it boil two hours, and skim it well. Then add four turnips pp.red and cut in quarters,16 THE NATIONAL COOK mOTia four onions pared and sliced, two carrots scraped and cut in slices^, one root of celery cut in small pieces, and one bunch of sweet herbs; which should be washed and tied with a thread, as they are to be taken out when the soup is served. When the vegetables are tender, take out the meat, strain off the soup and return it to the pot again, thicken it with a little flour mixed with water ; then add some parsley finely chopped, with more salt and pepper to the taste,, and some dumplings, made of a tea spoonful of butter to two of flour, moistened with a little w^ater or milk. Drop these dumplings inta the boihng soup ; let thero boil five minutes and serve them with the soup in the tureen. Noodles may be substituted for the dumplings. For direc- tions for making them see No 11. VSAL SOUP, 2. Take a knuckle of veal, put it in a pot wdth four quarts of water, and add a tea gpoonfol of salt to each quart. Pare and slice three onions, four turnips, two carrots, a bunch of sweet herbs^ and a small portion of celery. Let the veal boil one hour^ then add the above vegetables. When they are tender, strain the soup. Put it in the pot it was boiled in, thicken the soup with some flour mixed smoothly with a little Vv'ater, and add a little pars- ley finely chopped. Make some dumplings of a tea spoonful of butter to two of flour, and milk orTHE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 17 water enough to make a very soft dough. Drop them mto the boiling soup. They shoukl be about as large as a hickory-nut, when they are put in. If noodles are prefer red j they may be put in and boiled ten minutes. For directions for making them see No. 11. Dish the meat with the vegetables around it. Drawn butter may be served with it, or any other meat sauce. PEPFBR-POT. 3. Cut in small pieces four pounds of tripe, put it on to boil in as much water as will cover it, allowing a tea spoonful of salt to every quart of water. Let it boil three hours, then have ready four calves feet, which have been dressed with the skin on. Put them into the pot with the tripe and add as much water as w^ill cover them; also four onions sliced, and a small bunch of sweet herbs chopped finely. Half an hour before the pepper-pot is done add four potatoes cut in pieces; when these are tender add two ounces of butter rolled in flour, and season the soup highly with cayenne pepper. Make some dumplings of flour and butter and a little water—drop them into the soup; when the vegetables are sufficiently soft, serve it. The calves feet may be served with or without drawn butter. Any kind of spice may be added. It allspice or cloves are used, the grains should be put in w^hole* 2^18 THE .NATIONAL COOK BOOK. CHICKEN SOUP. 4. Wash a fine large chicken, put it in a pot and coyer it with water with a little salt. Pick and wash two table spoonsful of rice, a bunch of sweet herbs, washed, and tied with a thread, two onions, and a little celery cut fine. Add these to the chick- en as soon as it begins to boil. When the chicken is tender add a small bunch of parsley finely minced; let it boil a few minutes and then serve it. Season with pepper and salt to the taste. Serve the chick- en with drawn butter. Some like allspice in this soup. If you should like it add a tea spoonful of the whole grains. Noodles or dumplings may be substituted in place of the rice To make noodles see No. 11. The dumplings are made with a tea spoonful of butter, two of flour, and water enough to form a soft dough. Take a tea spoonful of the dough and drop into the boiling soup. Let them boil a few minutes. Pearl barley may be used instead of rice. LAMB SOUP. 5. Take a neck and breast of lamb, wash it, and to each pound of meat add a quart of water, and a tea spoonful of salt. Pare and slice two onions, two carrots, four turnips, two or three potatoes and a bunch of sweet herbs. Add all these to the meat after it has boiled one hour. If in the proper season add three or four tomatoes or half a dozen ochras.19 THE NATIONAL COOK'BOOK. When the vegetables are done, take out the meat^ and add some flour mixed to a smooth paste with a little water. Noodles or dumplings may be added, as for beef soup. Some thicken lamb soup with a little rice put in the pot with the lamb. OYSTER SOUP. 6. Take one hundred oysters out of the liquor. To half of the liquor add an equal quantity of water. Boil it with one tea spoonful of crushed allspice, a little mace, some cayenne pepper and salt. Let it boil twenty minutes, then strain it, put it back in the stew pan and add the oysters. As soon as it be- gins to boil, add a tea cupful of cream, and a little grated cracker rubbed in one ounce of butter. As soon as the oysters are plump, serve them. CLAM SOUP. 7. Wash the shells of the clams and put them in a pot without any water. Cover the pot close- ly to keep in the steam ; as soon as the clams are opened which will be in a few minutes, take them out of the shells and proceed as directed for oyster soup. GREEN CORN BOUP. 8. Put on a knuckle of veal to boil in three quarts of water, and three tea spoonsful of salt. Cut the corn off of one dozen ears, and put it20 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. on to boil with tlie veal. When the veal is tender the soup is done. Then roll an ounce of butter in flour and add to it before it is served. If the fire has been very hot and the water has boiled av^ay too much, a little more may be added. PBA SOUP, 9. This is made in the same manner as the green corn soup, only the peas must not be put in till about half an hour before the meat is done. A quart of peas will be requisite to make a dish of soup. SUCCOTASH. , 10. One quart of green corn cut off the cob, one quart of lima beans, and two pounds of pickled pork. If the pork should be very salt, soak it an hour before it is put on to boil. Put the pork on to boil and let it be about half cooked before the vegetables are put in. Then put in the corn (which must be cut off the cob) and the beans; let them boil till they are tender. Take all up, put the meat on a dish and the vegetables in a tureen. It should be a very thick soup when done. TO MAKE NOODLES FOR SOUP. 11. Beat up an egg and to it add as much flour as will make a very stiff dough. Roll it out in a thin sheet, flour it, and roll it up closely, as youTHE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 21 would do a sheet of paper. Then with a sharp knife I'.ut it in shavings about iilie cabbage for slaw; flour these cuttings to prevent them from adhering to each other, and add them to your soup whilst it is boiling. Let them boil ten minutes. FISH. Fish should always be perfectly fresh when cooked. To select fresh ones observe the eyes; if they have a bright life-like appearance the fish is fresh; if, on the contrary, the eyes are sunken and dark colored5 and have lost their brilliancy, they are certainly stale. Some judge by the redness of the gills, but they are sometimes colored to deceive customers. Crabs should be of a dark green color, and w^hen fresh from the water are always very lively, the same remarks hold good with regard to lobsters* If the tail of the lobster will return to its former position when pulled out, the lobster is fresh. Never buy a clam or oyster if the shells are parted. If the valves are tightly closed the oyster is fresh* BOILED ROCK, 12. Scale a rock, take out the eyes and gills, draw it and wash it well. Flour a cloth, wrap the fish in it, and boil it in plenty of water strongly salted, A common sized fish requires about half22 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. a large tea cupful of salt. Place your fish kettle over a strong firej and Avhen the water boils put in the fish. Let it boil hard twenty minutes. Take it out of the cloth carefullyj place it on your fish dish and send it to the table. Have egg sauce in a sauce boat. Mashed potatoes are an accompani- ment to boiled fish. Garnish the dish with green parsley. If any of the boiled fish should be left from din- ner it may be spiced as shad, and makes an excel- lent relish for breakfast or tea, PRIED ROCK. 13. Clean and score your fish ; wash and wipe them dry; season w^ell with cayenne pepper and gait. Let them stand at least one hour before they are cooked, that the seasoning may have time to penetrate them. Have ready a pan of hot lard, dredge flour over your fish, put them in the pan and fry them slowly, that they may be done through. They should be of a handsome brown on both sides. All pan fish are fried in the same way. BOILED COD. 14. Soak a dried cod for three hours in cold water; scrape and wash it very clean; then put it on to boil in as much cold water as wall cover it. Let it boil half an hour. Drain it on your fish dish,THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 23 and serve it with mashed potatoes, drawn butter, or egg sauce, and eggs boiled hard. The castor should contain cayenne pepper, mus- tard, sw^eet oil, pepper, vinegar, and catsup. COD FISH CAKBS, 15. Boil a piece of salt cod; take out all the bones, and mash with it equal quantities of mashed potatoes. Season it with pepper and salt to your taste; then add as much beaten egg as will form it into a paste. Make it out into thin cakes, flour them and fry them of a light brown. SPICED SHAD. 16. One large shad. Two table spoonsful of salt. Three tea spoonsful of cayenne pepper. Two table spoonsful of whole allspice. As much vinegar as will cover it. Split the shad open, rub over it two table spoons- ful of salt, and let it stand several hours. Have ready a pot with boiling w^ater in it sufficient to cover the shad, allowing a tea spoonful of salt to every quart of water. Boil it twenty minutes. Take it out of the water, drain it, bruise your all- spice just so as to crack the grains. Sprinkle over your shad the allspice and pepper, and cover it wnth cold vinegar.THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 24 BOILED SHAD. 17. Clean your shad, wash it and wipe it, flour it well, wrap it in a cloth, and put it into a large vessel of boiling water with a great deal of salt. It will require about twenty minutes to cook it. Serve it with egg sauce, or rich drawn butter. FRIED SHAD. 18. Cut your shad in half, wash it and wipe it dry, score it and season with cayenne pepper and salt, dredge flour over it, and fry it in hot lard. When done, put the two halves together, that it may assume the appearance of a whole fish. BROILED SHAD. 19. Split your shad down the back, wash it and season it well w^ith salt. Have your gridiron heated, grease the bars, put on the shad and broil it slowly till quite done. It should be of a fine brown on both sides. If designed for the dinner table, after having basted it well with butter on both sides, fold it over, that it may assume its ori- ginal form, and serve it. BAKED SHA.D. 20. Open your shad by cutting it dowm the back, wash it well and wipe it dry, score it and season it with cayenne pepper and salt; put it in a pan with two ounces of butter cut in small pieces,ME J^^ATIONAL COOK BOOK. 25 put a few pieces of butter in the bottom of the pan and the remainder on the shad, add two table spoonsful of water. Place it in a very moderate oven and let it stand three or four hours, SHAD ROASTED ON A BOARD. 2.1. Take a piece of clean oak board about three inches thickj and two feet square, stand it before the fire till the board is very hot, indeed al- most charred. Have your shad split down the back, cleaned, washed, wiped dry, and seasoned with salt; fasten it to the hot board with a few small nails; the skin side should be next the board, place the board before the fire with the head part down; as soon as the juices begin to run, turn it with the tail down; it should be turned frequently in order to retain the juices. When done butter it and serve it hot. Send it to the table on the board. This is the receipt for baking shad at the Phila- delphia fish house»^' POTTED SHAD, No. 1. 22; Cut a shad in six or eight pieces, wash and wipe it dry. Mix one dessert spoonful of ground allspice, half a table spoonful of black pepper, and half a table spoonful of salt—sprinkle a portion of this seasoning ov^er each piece of shad. Put them into a stone jar with enough good cider vinegar to cover them; cover the jar with a clean cloth, and26 THE NATIONAL COOK tiOOK, over this tie closely several thicknesses of browi'^ paper to keep in the steam; set it in a moderate oven and let it remain twelve hours. This is very good, but the fish is dark colored. When potted according to No. 2, it retains its whiteness. POTTED SHAD; Ko. 2. 23. Cut a shad in about half a dozen pieces, wash it and wipe it dry. Mix together two table spoonsful of whole allspice and one table spoonful of w^hole black pepper; put one table spoonful and a half of salt over the shad the evening before it is to be potted, the next morning sprinkle over it a half a tea spoonful of cayenne pepper. Place the shad in a stone jar, and over each layer throw a portion of the grains of pepper and allspice, cover it with vinegar and set it in a moderate oven for twelve hours, HAIilBUT. 24. Cut it in slices about a quarter of an inch thick ; wash and dry them, season with cayenne pep- per and salt; have ready a pan of hot lard and fry your fish in it till of a delicate brown on both sides. Some dip the cutlets in beaten egg and then in bread crumbs and fry it. When done in this man- ner it should be cut rather thinner than according to the first method.27 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. Or, heat your gridiron, grease the bars, season your fish with cayenne pepper and salt, and broil it till of a fine brown color. Lay it on a dish and butter it. CAT PISH. 25. Cut each fish in two parts, down the back and stomach; take out the upper part of the back bone next the head; wash and wipe them dry, sea- son with cayenne pepper and salt, and dredge flour over them; fry them in hot lard of a nice light brown. Some dress them like oysters; they are then dip- ped in beaten egg and bread crumbs and fried in hot lard. They are very nice dipped in beaten egg, without the crumbs, and fried. POTTED HERRING. 26. Clean your herring, wash them well and w^lpe them dry; then rub each one with salt and cayenne pepper; place in your jar a layer of her- ring, then some grains of allspice, half a dozen cloves, and two or three blades of mace; then put in another layer of herring, and so on till all are in ; cover the herring with cold vinegar, tie up the jar closely with several thicknesses of paper, and set it in the oven after the bread has been draw^n out; let it remain there all night. As soon as they become cold they will be fit for use.THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 28 SHELL FISH. PICKLED OTBTERS. 27. Take one hundred oysters out of their liquor, and add to them as much water as there was liquor. Put them over the fire, with salt to the taste, skim them, and as soon as they boil take them off. Have ready in a pan one gill of vinegar, one table spoonful of allspice, one table spoonful of pepper grains, a little cayenne pepper and mace, half a gill of pepper vinegar and half a gill of com- mon vinegar. They should be pickled the day before they are to be eaten. After standing a few hours, if a scum should have risen on them, take out the oysters and strain the liquor. About six hours before they are to be served, slice a lemon and add to them FHIED OYBTSRB. 28. Select the largest oysters for frying. Take them out of their liquor with a fork, and endeavor in doing so, to rinse off all the particles of shell w^hich may adhere to them. Dry them betw^een napkins ; have ready some grated cracker, seasoned with cayenne pepper and salt. Beat the yelks only of some eggs, and to each egg add half a table spoonful of thick cream. Dip the oysters, one at a time, first in the egg then in the cracker crumbs, and fry them in plenty of hot butter, o?29 IHE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. butter and lard mixed, till they are of a light brown on both sides. Serve them hot. BTEWED OYSTERS, No. 1. 29. Take one hundred large oysters, add to them a quarter of a pound of butter, with salt, black and red pepper to the taste. Stew as fast as pos- sible for three minutes. Serve them hot. STEWBD ©"YSTERS, ¥!o, 2. 30. Rinse one hundred oysters, and put them in a stew^ pan with the water which adheres to them ; season them with salt and cayenne pepper, and a very little mace. As soon as they begin to boil pour in half a pint of cream, and stir in half an ounce of butter rolled in a little grated cracker. Let them boil once and serve them hot. SCALLOPED OTBTSRS. 31. Drain your oysters, and season them w^ith salt and cayenne pepper; crumb some stale bread, and season it with salt and pepper. To each gill of the bread crumbs add one hard boiled egg, finely chopped ; butter a deep dish, strew in a layer of egg and crumbs, then a layer of the oysters, with some lumps of butter on them, then more crumbs, and so on till all are in. Put a cover of crumbs on the top. Bake this in a tolerably quick oven and serve it hot. 3,.30 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. OTBTER FRITTERS. 32. Drain the oysters and wipe them dry; sea- son them with salt, if they are not salt enough; make a batter in the proportion of a pint of milk to three eggs, and flour to thicken it; beat the yelks till they are very thick, stir in the milk and as much flour as will make a batter, but not a very thick one ; add a pinch of salt, beat the whole very hard, whisk the whites to a stiff dry froth and stir them in gently at the last. Put a small spoonful of the batter in a pan of boiling lard, then lay an oyster on the top, and over this put a little more batter; when they are brown on both sides, put them on a dish and send them to the table hot. OTSTER PIE. 83. Take one hundred oysters out of their li- quor, one at a time, so as to free them from any portions of the shell which might adhere to them. Drain and place them between clean napkins in order to dry them perfectly ; pour off half the liquor into a stew-pan, salt it to your taste, stir in one gill of cream, one ounce and a half of butter rolled in grated cracker, and a little cayenne pepper; boil two eggs hard, chop them up, and mix them with as many bread crumbs as will cover the top of your pie; season the bread and egg with cayenne pep- per and salt, make a rich paste, line the sides ofTHE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 31 your pie ilish, put in the oysters, pour the hot li- quor over them, strew the bread crumbs on the top, cover the whole with a lid of paste, cut an opening in the centre of the top crust, and ornament it with flowers or leaves made of the paste, bake it and serve it hot. As soon as the crust is done take the pie out of the oven. ROABTBD O^STBRS. 34. Wash the shells perfectly clean, put them in pans and set them in the oven, or place them in rows on the top of your kitchen range. Those who live in the country, and have large wood fires, may roast them nicely on their hot hearth stone. Take them up as soon as the shells begin to open, before the liquor is lost; have ready a hot vegeta- ble dish, take out the oysters and serve imme- diately. Or, the upper shell may be taken off, and the oysters placed on broad dishes in the other shell. The dishes must be well heated as the oys- ters should be eaten hot. Each person dresses his oysters on his plate, O^STBR OMELETTE. 85. Eight oysters chopped fine, Six eggs, A wine glassful of flour, A little milk. Pepper and salt to the taste.THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 32 Beat the eggs very light, add the oysters and the flour, which must be mixed to a paste with a little milk; pepper and salt to the taste. Fry it in hot butter, but do not turn it; as soon as it is done slip it on a dish and serve it hot. The above is the usual mode of preparing oyster omelette; bat the better way is to put your oysters in a stew pan, set them over the fire, and the mo- ment they begin to boil take them out, drain them and dry them in a napkin. They are not so wa- tery when prepared in this manner, and conse- quently will not dilute the beaten egg as much as the former mode. When they are cold mmce them and proceed as above. STEWED CLAMS. 36. Wash the clams, put them in a pot and cover them closely; set them near the fire, and as soon as they begin to open take them out of the shell; drain them, and to a pint of clams add half a pint of water, one ounce of butter rolled in flour, cayenne pepper and salt to the taste ; let them stew ten minutes. Just before they are to be dished add one gill of cream. CLAM FRITTERB, 37.

Take out the hard part and cut the remainder in half, and season them with pepper and salt; beat the yelks of four eggs very light, add to them a pint of milk, a little salt, and flour enough to form a batter; whisk the whites very dry and add them at the last. Have ready a pan of hot lard, put in a spoonful of the batter, lay on the top two or three pieces of the clams, then cover them with a little more of the batter. Fry them on both sides and serve them hot. The small sand clams are the best kind. FRIED GLAM3. 38. Wash your clams before they are opened; place them in a vessel without any water. Cover the vessel closely and as soon as they open their mouths take them out of the shell. Dry them in a napkin, season them with cayenne pepper and salt if necessary, and fry them in butter. Or, they may be fried in egg and bread crumbs as oysters. TERRAPINS. 39. Put the terrapins on in boiling w^ater and let them boil ten minutes, take them out and with a coarse cloth rub all the skin off the head, neck, and claws, also the thin shell that may come loose. Then boil them in clean water, with a little salt in it, until the claws- are perfectly soft. The time of boiling depends very m.uch on the age of the terra-34 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. pin ; some take three hoars. When they are soft, open them carefully, take out the sand bag, the spongy part, and the gall, which you must not break. Cut all the remainder of the terrapin in small pieces, put them in a stew pan, and to each large terrapin take a quarter of a pound of butter, one wine glass of Sherry or Madeira wine, salt, black and red pepper, and mustard, to suit the taste, also to each terrapin, the yelks of two hard boiled eggs, mashed to a paste, with a little butter. Mix the whole together, and stew fifteen minutes. Send them to the table hot. BOILED CRABS. 40. Have a large pot of water strongly salted, let it boil hard, put in your crabs and boil them for twenty minutes. If the w^ater should cease boiling the crabs will be watery. Take them out, break off the claws, wipe the shells very clean, also the large claws When cold, place them on a dish with the large claws around it. The claws should be cracked be- fore they are sent to the table. The small ones are not generally eaten. SOFT CRABS. 41. Prepare your crabs by removing the spongy part, and sand bag. Wipe them very clean and fry them in some hot lard and butter mixed. WhenTHE NATIONAL COOK BOOIf. 35 tliey are a fine yellow brown on both sides, place them on a dish and send them to the table hot. BOILED LOBSTER. 42. Lobsters, as well as crabs, should be boiled in strong salt and water. Have your pot of w^ater boiling hard, put in your lobsters and boil them for half an hour, or if they are very large, a little lon- ger. Take them out of the pot and when they have drained, open them, extract the meat care- fully, and send it to the table cold. Lobster is usually dressed at the table with mus- tard, hard boiled eggs, cayenne pepper, salt, vine- gar and oil. LOBSTER SALAX). 43. One large lobster. Three table spoonsful of French mustard, or^ Two dessert spoonsful of common mixed mus- tard. One gill and a half of vinegar. One gill and a half of sweet oil. The yelks of five hard boiled eggs.

Mix this dressing tho- roughly with the lobster and lettuce, and serve it before the salad becomes wilted. OY-BTER OMBLETTB. 44. Beat four eggs very light. Cut the hard part out of eight or a dozen oysters^ according to their size^ wipe them dry, and cut them up in small pieces, stir them into the beaten egg and fry them in hot butter. When the under side is brown^ sprinkle a little salt and pepper over the top, and fold one half over the other. Never turn an omelette^ as it makes it heavy* MEATS. The finest grained beef is the best, the flesh iS of a fine red, and the fat a light cream color^ but not yellow^; the fat, too, is solid and firm. The lean of mutton should be of a red color, and the fat white. The lean of veal should be of a light color and the fat white. The skin of pork should be of a light color, and if young it is tender. The fat should appear firm. A tender goose is known by taking hold of the wing and raising it; if the skin tears easily, the goose is tender, or if you can readily insert the head of a pin into the fleshy it is37 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK* young. The same remarks will bold good wilh regard to ducks. Young chickens may be known by pressing the lower end of the breast bone; if it yields readily to the pressure they are not old, for in all animals the bones are cartilaginous when young. The breast should be broad and plump in all kinds of poultry, the feet pliable^ and the toe,s easily broken when bent back, ROAST BEEP. 45. The nicest piece for roasting is the rib. Two ribs of fine beef is a piece large enough for a family of eight or ten. The lean of beef should always appear of a bright red before it is cooked^ and the fat of a very light cream color. Season the beef with salt, and place it in a roaster before a clear bright fire. Do not set it too close at first. As to the time of roasting, that must be left to the judgment of the cook and the taste of those who are to eat it. If it is preferred quite rare an hour and a half or two hours will cook two large ribs sufficiently, but if it is to be better done, it must be cooked a proportionably longer tim.e. Whilst the beef is roasting, baste it frequently wilh its own gravy. When nearly done, dredge flour lightly over it so as to brown it. When the meat is taken out, skim off the fat on the top of the gravy, and pour the remainder in a pan, add a little flour, with salt to the taste, and some water, giveTHE NATIONAL COOK SOOk* 38 it one boilj and serve it in a small tureen or gravy boat. In cold weather the plates should be warmed just before the dinner is served. Or^ a small chafing dish placed under each plate* BEEF A-LA-MODB. 46. A round of beef is the best for this purpose* With a sharp knife cut incisions in the meat about an inch apart, and within one inch of the opposite side, season it with pepper and salt according to the size of the piece of meat. Make a dressing of butter, onion, and bread crumbs, in the proportion of a pint of crumbs, one small onion finely chopped, and an ounce of butter^ with pepper and salt to the taste, fill the incisions w^ith the dressing, put the meat in a pot, with about a pint of water, and cover it tightly. Let it sim- mer six or eight hours. Some stick in a few cloves, and those who are fond of spice add allspice. When the meat is done, dish it up and thicken the gravy with a little flour. Let it boil once, and serve it. This is excellent when cold. BEEF STEAKS. 47. Scrape some fine sirloin steaks, wipe them with a clean cloth, heat the bars of vour gridiron, grease them^ and put your steaks over clear coals39 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. Turn them frequently by placing a dish over them, and then quickly turn them, holding the dish in one hand and the gridiron in the other. In this man- ner you will preserve the gravy. When done, sea- son them with pepper and salt; baste them well with butter, and add two table spoonsful of water, with a little salt. Send them to the table hot. FRIED BEEP STEAK, 48. Season your steaks with salt and pepper, and fry them in hot lard. When done, dish them, add a little flour to the fat they were fried in, pour in a little water, and season with pepper and salt to the taste; give the gravy one boil and pour it over. SMOTHERED STEAK. 49. Take one dozen large onions, boil them in very little water until they are tender. Pound and w^ash a beef steak, season it with pepper and salt, put it in a pan with some hot beef dripping, and fry it till it is done. Take it out, put it on a dish, \vhere it will keep hot. Then, when the onions are soft, drain and mash them in the pan with the steak gravy, and add pepper and salt to the taste. Put it on the fire and as soon as it is hot, pour it over the steak and serve it. BAKBD BEEF, AMD yORKSHIRB PUDBI^-G. 50. Rub salt on a nice piece of beef, put it on bars, which should fit your dripping pan, set it inTHE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 40 the oven, with a gill of water in the pan, and when it is half done, make the pudding in the following manner: Beat four eggs very light; the yelks in a pan, the whites in a broad dish. When the yelks are thick stir in a pint of milk, and as much flour as wuU make a batter, but not a thick one. Then stir in the whites which must be whisked very dry ; do not beat the batter after the white is in ; lastly stir in a tea spoonful of dissolved carbonate of ammo- nia. Take out the meat, skim all the fat off the gravy, pour in the batter and replace the meat; put all into the oven again, and cook it till the pudding is done. You should make batter enough to cover your dripping pan about half an inch deep. When the meat is dished, cut the pudding in squares, and place it round the dish, the brown side up. FRENCH STEW, ISTo. 1* 51. Cut up two pounds of beef, and add to it a pint of sliced tomatoes. The tomatoes must be peeled. Put the meat in a stew-pan and season it w^ell with pepper and salt, then add your tomatoes and an ounce of butter rolled in flour. Cover it closely, and let it simmer till the beef is tender. It does not require any water as the tomatoes are suf- ficiently juicy. If the gravy should not be thick enough, add a little flour mixed with cold water.THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 41 FRENCH STEW, No. 2. 52. Cut up one pound of beef in small pieces about an inch square, pare and slice six onions; put a layer of the meat and a layer of onions in a stew-pan, with salt and pepper and a little flour alternately till all is in, and add half a tea cupful of water; cover it closely and set it on a slow fire to stew; when about half done, if the gravy seems too thin, add one ounce of butter rolled in flour; but if it should be thick enough, add the butter without the flour. When tomatoes are in season two tomatoes may be cut in small pieces and stewed with the meat Cold beef may be cooked in the same manner. BEEF BTBWED WITH ONIONS. 53. Cut some tender beef in small pieces, and sea- son it with pepper and salt, slice some onions and add to it, with water enough in the stew-pan to make a gravy ; let it stew slowly till the beef is thorough- ly done, then add some pieces of butter rolled in flour to make a rich gravy. Cold beef may be done in the same way, only the onions must be stewed first and the meat added. If the water should stew away too much put in a little more. STEWED BEEF'S KIDNEY". 54. Clear the kidney of all the fat, cut it in two, 4^42 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. and with a sharp knife cut out the fibre which runs through the middle of it. Lay it in a sauce-pan with a very little water and a little salt, cover it close and let it stew till it is perfectly tender, then take it up and cut it in small pieces, season it with pepper, and more salt if requisite, and return it to the stew-pan; let it stew till there are about two spoonsful of gravy remaining in the stew-pan, then add a piece of butter and a little flour. Let it boil once and serve it. FRIED BEEF'S KIDNEY. 55. Clean all the fat off the kidney, cut it open and take out the fibre which runs through it; put it in a stew-pan w^ith a very little water and some salt, and cook it till it is tender; then season it with pepper and more salt if required, flour it and fry it in hot lard, add a little flour and water to make the gravy. Or, you may broil instead of frying it, after it has been parboiled. CORNED BEEF. 56. One hundred pounds of beef, Six pounds of coarse salt. Two ounces and a half of saltpetre, One pound and a half of sugar. Four gallons of water.43 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. Mix the above ingredients together and pour over the meat. Cover the tub closely. JEWISH METHOD OP PREPARING BEEP FOR SALTING-. 57. Take out all the veins. Sprinkle with salt and let it lay for half an hour; wash off all the salt and soak it half an hour in cold water, drain it and then put it in the pickle as directed above. BOILED CORNED BEEP, 58. Put on the meat in cold water; allow one quart of water to every pound of meat. The slower it boils the better it will be. For every pound of meat let it boil fifteen minutes; thus, a piece of beef weighing twelve pounds should boil three hours. If the beef is to be eaten cold—as soon as it is taken out of the pot immerse it in cold water for a short time, in order to retain the juices. Tongues are boiled in the same manner. BOILED TONGUE. 59. See boiled corned beef, Article 58. TRIPE. 60. Scrape and wash it very clean—put it in aTHE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 44 pot with a tea spoonful of salt to every quart of water, and let it boil till the top of each piece be- gins to look clear—it requires a great deal of boil- ing and must be exceedingly soft. When, cold cut it in pieces, season and fry it in egg and bread crumbs like oysters. Or, it may be fried without the egg and crumbs, and the gravy thickened with a little flour, and flavored with catsup or vinegar. Serve it hot. ROAST VEAL, 61. Season a breast of veal with pepper and salt; skewer the sweet-bread firmly in its place, flour the meat and roast it slowly before a moderate fire for about four hours—it should be of a fine brown but not dry ; baste it with butter. When done put the gravy in a stew-pan, add a piece of butter rolled in browned flour, and if there should not be quite enough gravy add a little more water, with pepper and salt to the taste. The gravy should be brown. PLAII^ VEAL PIE. 62. Take the best end of a neck of veal, cut it in pieces, season it with pepper and salt, and stew it in just enough w^ater to cover it. When it is nearly done make a rich gravy with some butter rolled in flour, added to the water it was stew^ed in.THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 45 Line the sides of a deep pie dish with paste, put in the meat and pour in the gravy, roll out a sheet of paste and cover the top; cut an opening in the centre of the top, about three inches long, and another to cross it at right angles; turn back the four corners and ornament with bars of paste twisted and laid over. Set it in the oven, and when the crust is done send it to the table in the dish it was baked in. VEAL POT PIE. 63. Cut up some veal, the best part of the neck is preferable to any other, wash and season it with pepper and salt; line the sides of your pot with paste, put in the veal with some pieces of paste rolled out and cut in squares, cut up some pieces of butter rolled in flour and add to it, pour in as much w^ater as w^ill cover it, and lay a sheet of paste on the top, leaving an opening in the centre; put the lid on the pot and put it over a moderate fire, let it cook slowly till the meat is done; place the soft crust on a dish, then put the meat over it, and on the top lay the hard crust, with the brown side up. Serve the gravy in a boat. To have the crust of a pot pie brown, set th(^ pot on a few coals before the fire, and turn it fre- quently.THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 46 FILLET OF VEAL A-Lil-MOJ3B. 64. Cut deep incisions in the meat about an inch apartj and season it Vv^ith pepper and salt. Make your dressing with a four cent baker's loaf, two small onions finely chopped, and an ounce of butter, with pepper and salt to the taste; fill the incisions with this dressing, put the veal in a pot with three gills of water and cover it tightly. Let it cook slowly two hours at least. Some prefer a little sweet marjoram or thyme, finely powdered, added to the dressing.

If it should not be suf- ficiently seasoned, add a little more pepper or salt, as it may require. Apple sauce is always served with roast pork. ROAST PIG. 86. Prepare the pig by cutting off the feet, scraping and cleansing the head and ears, cutting out the tongue and eyes, and cleaning the throat. Wash it perfectly clean and w^ipe it dry. Make a dressing of bread crumbs, some onions finely chop- ped, with salt, pepper, and sweet marjoram to the taste, also butter enough to make the crumbs ad- here together. Any spice may be added, and the grating of a lemon, but many prefer the dressing without spice. Rub the pig thoroughly inside with salt, cayenne pepper, and powdered sage, then fill it with the dressing and sew it up. Rub the outside with salt, cayenne pepper and sage, put it on the spit and place it before a clear, but not too hot a fire. Have a piece of clean sponge tied on a stick, dip it in melted butter, and as the skin dries moisten it. A common sized pig takes from three to four hours to roast. An excellent filling may be made of po- tatoes boiled and mashed instead of the bread. If potatoes are used the dressing will require more butter. Roast pig is always served with haslet sauce.THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 55 For directions for making it see under the head of Sauces. Apple sau^^e is also thought to be an in- dispensable accompaniment to roast pig. STUFFED LEG OF POBK. 87. Make deep incisions in the meat parallel to the bone; trim it so as to leave the skin longer than the flesh; then boil some potatoes, when they are done mash them with a piece of butter, cayenne pepper, salt, and an onion finely chopped and a lit- tle rubbed sage. With this dressing fill the incisions, draw the skin down and skewer it over to keep the dressing from falling .out; season the outside of the meat w^ith salt, cayenne pepper, and rubbed sage ; roast it slowly; w^hen it is done pour the gravy in a pan, skim off the fat, and add a little flour mixed with water ; let it boil once. Serve it with apple or cranberry sauce. Some prefer a dressing made of bread crumbs instead of potatoes. PORK STEAKS. 88.

After they have been well scalded and cleaned, wash them, and put them on to boil in a sufficiency of water to cover them, with two tea spoonsful of salt to a quart of water. Let them boil till the bones are all loose and the flesh nearly ready to fall to pieces. Take them out and lay them on a dish to get cold, and save the liquor they were boiled in ; mix equal portions of the liquor and good sharp vinegar, with whole allspice, a few cloves, pepper and salt to the taste. Heat the vinegar and spice, and pour it over them. They mayTHE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 57 be sent to the table cold, or they may be heated with a portion of the vinegar. The feet may be boiled as for the souse, and when cold, cut in half, dredged with flour, and fried brown. SCRAPPLE. 92. This is generally made of the head, feet, and any pieces which may be left after having made sausage meat. Scrape and w^ash well all the pieces designed for the scrapple, put them in a pot with just as much water as will cover them. Add a little salt, and let them boil slowdy till the flesh is perfectly soft, and the bones loose. Take all the meat out of the pot, pick out the bones, cut it up fine, and return it to the liquor in the pot. Season it with pepper, salt, and rubbed sage, to the taste. Set the pot over the fire, and just before it begins to boil, stir in gradually as much Indian meal as will make it as thick as thick mush. Let it boil a few minutes, take it off, and pour it in pans. When cold, cut it in slices, flour it, and fry it in hot lard, or sausage fat. Some prefer buckwheat meal; this is added in the same manner as the Indian. Indian meal is pre- ferable, as it is not so solid as buckwheat. Sweet marjoram may be added with the sage^ if preferred.58 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. HOGS-HEAD CHEESE. 93. Clean a pig's head nicely, wash it well, and boil it in very little water, with some salt. Let it boil until the bones fall from the flesh. Then take it up, pick out all the bones, and with a wooden spoon mash it up well, and return it to the water it was boiled in. Add red and black pepper, rub- bed sage and sweet marjoram to the taste. Boil the whole down till it is quite thick and nearly dry ; then pour it in pans or forms, smooth it over the ■op with the back of a spoon, and stand it away to get cold. Cut it in slices and send it to the table. Some prefer spice in hogs-head cheese; in that case, add a small quantity of ground cloves and mace. BOILED HAM. 94. Wash and scrape your ham; if it is not very salt it need not be soaked; if old and dry, let it soak twelve hours in lukewarm water, which should be changed several times. Put it in a large vessel filled with cold water. Let it simmer, but be careful not to let it boil, as it hardens and toughens the meat. Allow twenty minutes to cook each pound of meat. When it is done, take it out of the w^ater, strip off the skin, and serve it. Twist scalloped letter paper round the shank, or ornament it w^ith sprigs of green parsley neatly twisted round it.

Put your venison on a spit before a clear^ steady fire, cover it with some thick paper to keep it from burning, and place it at a sufficient distance from the fire, that it may not brown too soon. The paper may be fastened on by sticking through it two or three large darning needles. Turn the spit frequently, and baste the meat with butter. Yeni- son is very unpalatable if too much cooked ; about60 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK* two hours ^^ill be sufficient. It should never be roasted unless it is fat. A gravy may be made of the trimmings of the haunch stewed in very little water, to which add the drippings from the meat, season with pepper and salt, and thicken with butter rolled in flour. Some baste with melted butter and wine mixed together. Serve with currant jelly. VENISON BTEAKB. 98. Cut your venison in slices, pound it, and having heated your gridiron, grease the bars and place the meat on it. Broil the venison very quickly over clear coals, and as soon as it is done put it on a dish, season with pepper and salt and plenty of butter. Send it to the table immediately. Serve it with currant jelly. The plates should be warm BEST "WAY OF COOKING VENISON. 99. Cut your venison in rather thin slices, pound them, lay them on a dish, and send them to the table.

Each person at the table adds pepper to suit the taste. Some prefer venison cooked without currant jelly. ROASTED RABBIT. 100. Cut off the head, open and wash it clean, and fill it with a dressing made of bread crumbs, some onions finely chopped, pepper, salt, a little powdered mace, and as much butter as will cause the crumbs to adhere together ; sew the rabbit up after the dressing is in, put It on a spit before the fire, and baste it with butter, whilst it is roasting. Or it may be put in a pan with a little water, and baked. Make a gravy of a gill of water, an ounce of butter, an onion finely chopped, pepper, salt and mace to the taste. Wine may be added, if preferred. BAKED RABBIT PIE, 101. Cut a rabbit in pieces, wash it, and season it with salt and pepper. Nearly cover it with cold water, and stew it till it is tender, then add three ounces of butter rolled in flour. If it should not be seasoned sufiTiciently, add more pepper, as rab- bits require more seasoning than many other kinds of meat. 6THJi JfATlOJJAL COOK BOOk* 62 Make a paste^ butter your pie dish, and line tlitJ sides. Place the pieces of rabbit in the dish, and add just enough of the gravy to keep it from burn- ing, then cover it with a lid of paste, leave an opening on the top, which may be ornamented witli strips of paste, and bake it. It should be served in the dish it is baked in. Keep the remainder of the gravy hot, but do not let it boil or simmer, serve it in a gravy boat, or fill the pie with the gravy just before it is gent to the table. RABBIT POT Pffi. 102. Cut a rabbit in small pieces, season it highly with salt and pepper. Make a paste, line the sides of a pot with the crust, then put in the rab- bit, with three ounces of butter cut up and rolled in flour. Roll out some of the dough, cut it in pieces about three inches square, and lay it in with the pieces of rabbit; pour in as much water as will cover it, roll out a sheet of paste and place on the top, leaving an opening in the centre. Cover the pot with the lid, and let it cook slowly till the rab- bit is done. If when your pie is nearly done, the gravy should not be thick enough, add a few more pieces of but* ter rolled in flour. When the pie is done put the top or soft crust ?^ the bottom of the dish, lay the rabbit on it, thenTHE NxiTlONAL COOK BOOK. 63 pla^^e the brown crust on the top with the brown side tip.

When about half done add a quarter of a pound of butter, cut in pieces, and rolled in flour, and half a pint of claret wine. If the meat should not be sea- soned enougb, add more salt, pepper or spice. Rabbit requires a great deal of seasoning, especially pepper. Serve it hot. This dish is much esteemed by many Americans. FRIGASEED RABBIT. 104. Cut your rabbit in pieces, wash it and put it in a stew-pan with three gills of w^ater, season it w^ith salt, and very highly with pepper, a little ma 36, and powdered cloves ; let it stew very slowly, and when nearly done add three ounces of butter rolled in flour.

SMOTHERED RABBIT. 105. Clean a rabbit, cut off the head, wash it well, and skewer it as if for roasting. Put it in a slevv7-pan with half a pint of water, some pepper, salt, mace, and cloves, and let it simmer very slowly ; keep the stew^-pan covered in order to re- tain the steam. When half done add a quarter of a pound of butter rolled in flour. If the water should stew away too much a little more may be added. Peel some onions and boil them till they are tender, drain and chop them fine, season with salt, pepper and butter to the taste. When the rabbit is done place it upon the dish it is to be served in, then put the onions into the gravy and give them one boil, pour them over the rabbit and serve hot. ROASTBD PIGEONS. 106. Pick the pigeons, draw and wash them; dry them on a clean napkin, rub them inside and out- side with pepper and salt; fill them with a dressing of bread crumbs, pepper, salt, butter, and a little onion finely minced ; skewer them, or if you choose, tie them round with tape; put them on the spit and baste them frequently with butter.

Put them in a stew-pan, and for each pair of pigeons roll an ounce of butter in a little flour, add some pepper and salt, and water enough just to cover them; stew them till they are tender. If the gravy should not be thick enough add a little more flour. Pigeons are prepared in the same way for pies. BROILED SQUAB. 108. Young pigeons or squabs are the nicest for broiling. Cut them down the back, clean them nicely, wash them and dry them on a clean napkin. Have ready a bed of clear coals, heat your grid- iron, grease the bars to prevent the pigeons from sticking, and place them over the fire; turn them frequently, and be careful not to let the legs and wings burn.

Pour over them just enough water to keep them from burning, cover the stew-pan and let the birds cook slowly. When they are done take them up, and if the gravy is not thick enough, add a little butter rolled in flour, let it boil once and pour it over the birds.67 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. ROASTED REED BIRDS. 112. Pick your birds, and with a pair of scis- sors cut and draw them as chickens. Wash them clean and wipe them dry ; make a dressing of bread crumbs, pepper, salt and butter enough to make the crumbs adhere together; chopped onion may be added, with a small quantity of any kind of sweet herb, finely powdered.

They may be dressed as above, and fried in the hot lard and butter, without the egg and crumbs. ROAST TURKEY. 115. Draw your turkey and prepare it for roast- ing in the same manner as chickens. Make a dressing of bread crumbs, some onions finely minced, pepper, salt, and a little sweet marjoram, with enough butter to make the crumbs adhere to- gether ; rub the inside of the turkey with pepper and salt, fill it with this dressing, season the out- side with salt and pepper, truss it firmly, put it on the spit, dredge some flour over it, and place it be- fore the fire; baste it w^ith butter while it is cook- ing. Clean the giblets, boil them in very little water, with some salt. When the turkey is done take it up, pour the liquor the giblets w^ere boiled in, into the gravy w^hich fell from it, chop up the liver and put it in with some butter rolled in flour to thicken the gravy, and more pepper and salt.

Let it boil for about two hours, which wall cook it sufficiently, unless it be a very large one. Take it out of the napkin, place it on a large dish, garnish the edges of the dish wdth double parsley, and serve with a rich oyster sauce in a tureen. ROASTED DUCK, Ho. 1. 117. Clean your ducks nicely, w^ash them and wipe them dry. Rub them inside with pepper and salt, and fill them with a dressing made of crumbs of bread, two or three onions finely minced, some pepper, salt, and butter enough to make the crumbs adhere. Some use beaten egg in the dressing, but it makes it tough and heavy. After having filled the ducks truss them and put them on the spit; baste them with butter w^hilst they are roasting.70 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. Wash the livers, first cut out the gall; with a sharp knife open the gizzards by cutting an in- cision round them, but not so deep as to cut the inner skin ; then with your fingers tear them open. Pour boiling water on the feet and skin them ; cut off the toes, and crack the leg in half, wash all these- and stew them in very little water, w^ith pepper and salt. When the ducks are done, add the liquor the giblets were boiled in to the gravy, which has dropped from them, and thicken it with a little butter rolled in flour.

Cut your chickens in pieces, wash them and dry them in a clean napkin; season with salt and pepper. Line the sides of the pot with paste, put in the pieces of chicken, and between every layer of chicken put a piece of batter rolled in flour, with squares of the paste if you choose; pour in enough cold water to cover it, and put on a lid of the paste ; leave an opening in the centre of the top crust; cover the pot, place it in front of the fire with a few coals under it. Turn the pot frequently that the crust may be evenly browned all around. When it is done, if the gravy should not be thick enough^ add a little more flour mixed with butter. Dish it by putting the top crust on the sides of the dish, lay the chicken in the centre, and place the brown crust on the top. Serve the gravy in a sauce boat. BROILED GHICKEHS. 124.

PICKLES. Pickles should always be done in the very best cider or wine vinegar, as the chemical preparations known by the name of vinegar soften the pickles, besides being very injurious to the stomach. Stone or glass jars are the best for keeping pickles, which should be always completely covered with vinegar. When they are first put into the jars they require attention for a day or two, to keep them filled up, as the vinegar sinks in the jar, or is imbibed by the pickles, PICKLED PEPPEHB. 220. If you would prefer your peppers less pungent, cut an opening in the top of the pepper, and take out half the seeds. Lay them for two weeks in salt and water which will bear an egg. Be careful to keep them covered with the brine. Pat a board over them to keep them under the salt and water, and take off the scam as it rises. If they are not yellow at the end of two weeks, let them remain in the brine a little longer. When yellow take them out. wash them, and put 10110 ME NATIONAL dOOK BOOI^. them in a kettle with cold water—cover the top w^ith leaves—place them near the fire, let them get hot, but do not permit them to simmer. When they are greened in this manner, take them out^ drain them, place them in your jars^ and pour cold spiced vinegar over them. If you wash to stuff them, chop some cabbage very fine, season it highly with mace, cinnamon, cloves, and mustard seed—stuff the peppers with this preparation, and tie a thread round each one to keep the stuffing in. PICKLED MUSHROOMS, No. 1. 221* Choose button mushrooms; wipe them well with a clean cloth. Sprinkle a little salt over them, and put them in a stew-pan, with some pieces of mace and whole pepper corns. Simmer them slowly till all the juice is out of them. Shake them frequently. Let them simmer very gradually till all the liquor is dried up, but be careful not to let the mushrooms get dry. When the juice has all evaporated, pour over them as much cold vine- gar as will cover them, let them get hot, and put them in jars. When cold, cover them closely. PICKLED MUSHROOMS, Ho. 2. 222. Select the hutton mushrooms, that is, those which are not fully blown. Cut oflf the ends ofTHE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. Ill the stems, scrape them, peel the tops, and wipe them on a clean cloth. Put them into a stew-pan, with just enough v/ater to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Shake them occasionally, to prevent them from burning. As soon as they are tender, pour over them som.e boiling vinegar, seasoned with mace, cloves, w^hole grains of pepper, and salt. When cool, bottle them, and seal the corks. PICKLED ONIONS. 223. Choose small white onions, peel them, and throw a few at a time in a pan of boiling salt and water; as soon as they look clear take them out carefully, and place them on a sieve to dry; then put in more, and so on, till all are cooked. When they are cold, put them in jars, and pour spiced vinegar over them. To each quart of the vinegar, put one table spoonful of whole allspice, half a table spoonful of pepper grains, three or four small pieces of mace, half a dozen cloves, and a table spoonful of mus- tard seed. Boil all these spices in the vinegar, and pour it, boiling hot, over the pickles. PICKLED EGGS. 224. Boil some eggs hard ; take off the shells,THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 112 put them into a jar, and cover them with cold vinegar. CHOW CHOW. 225. Three cabbages. Twenty-five peppers. Half a pint of mustard seed, Three sticks of horse-radish, chipped. Cut the cabbages as for slaw ; chop the peppers very fine. Put in a jar a layer of cabbage, a very little salt, then a layer of peppers, sprinkle over this some horse-radish and mustard seed, and so on, till all is in, then fill up the jars with cold vinegar, in every quart of which dissolve two ounces of sugar. This is very good with hot or cold meat. PICKLED WALNUTS. 226. Rub your walnuts well with a coarse towel, and lay them for two w^eeks in salt and water strong enough to float an egg. Drain them, and put them in your kettle, with fresh water enough to cover them, and let them stand twelve hours, where they will keep hot, but not boil. To one hundred walnuts take one gallon of the best vinegar, one ounce of pepper, one ounce of cloves, half an ounce of mace, half an ounce of113 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. nutmeg, four ounces of ginger. Break the ginger and nutmegs in pieces, bruise the pepper a little, and put the spices into the vinegar just before it boils. Let it boil five minutes; pour it out, cover it closely, and stand it away to get cold. Place the walnuts in your jars, and strew over them about four ounces of mustard seed, pounded and sifted, then pour the spiced vinegar over and cover them closely. PICKLED PEACHES. 227. Select ripe cling-stone peaches. To one gallon of good vinegar add four pounds of brown sugar; boil this for a few minutes, and take off any scum which may rise. Rub the peaches with a flannel cloth, to remove the down, and stick a clove in each; put them in glass or stone jars, and pour the liquor upon them boiling hot. When cold, cover the jars and let them stand in a cool place for a week or ten days, then pour off the liquor and boil it as before, after which return it, boiling, to the peaches, which should be carefully covered and stored away for future use. If your peaches are very hard, boil them in water till tender, before you pickle them, and they will be fit for use almost immediately. PICKLED BEANS. 228. String-beans, or French beans, are the 10*THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 114 kind used for pickling. Take off the strings but do not break the beans; put them in strong salt and water for three or four days; cover them with a board and weight so as to keep them under the water. Then take them out, wash them, and put them in a preserving kettle with hot water enough to cover them, and put leaves or a cloth over them to keep in the steam. When they are green take them out, drain them and put them in jars; pour hot vinegar over them, w^ith any kind of spice you may like best, and a small piece of alum in each jar. Radish pods are pickled in the same way. PICKLBD MANGOES. 229. Cut your mangoes in half, take out all the seeds, tie them together with coarse thread, and lay them in strong salt and water for three or four days. Then wash and drain them, put them into a kettle with vine or cabbage leaves over the top, or they may be covered with a clean coarse cloth; pour in hot water enough to cover them, and let them stand near the fire to keep hot. When they are green take them out, untie them, turn the cut side down and drain them. Cut some horse-radish in fine slips, and mix with it some mace, cloves, pepper, allspice and mustard seed ; fill your man- goes with this, and if you like it add a clove of garlic to each one, place the two sides together and tie them again. Put them in jars and cover them115 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. with vinegar. Cut off the threads before they are sent to the table. PICKLED CUCUMBERS. 230. Select the small sized cucumbers for pick- ling. They should be free from bruises and of a fine green color, for if they are old and yellow when picked from the vines they will never be green when they are pickled. Wash your cucumbers in cold water to remove all the sand and grit, put them in your pickling tub, make a brine of salt and water strong enough to float an egg. Pour enough of this brine over the cucumbers to cover them; spread over the top a coarse cloth and over this put the lid of the tub, which should be just large enough to fit inside and slip down so as to press on the cucumbers, put a weight on the lid to keep it in its place. Let them stand in the salt and w^ater till they are perfectly yellow, which will be in about nine days. When they are quite yellow take them out, wash them in cold water and ex- amine each one separately; if you should find any soft or bruised reject them, as they would be likely to spoil the others. Put them into a preserving kettle, cover them with hot water and vine or cab- bage leaves, or if you have no leaves a clean coarse towel will answer as well. Put a plate over the top and stand them w^here they will keep hot, but not simmer, as that would ruin them. When they116 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. are perfectly green take them out of the water, drain them^ and put in your jars first a layer of cucumbers, then a tea spoonful of whole allspice, half a dozen cloves, some strips of horse-radish, and half a tea spoonful of mustard seed, then more cu- cumbers, and so on till the jar is full. Pour in as much good vinegar as will cover them, with a tea spoonful of pulverized alum to each jar. In a day or two examine them, and fill up the jars with vinegar if the pickles have absorbed it so as to leave the top ones uncovered. If you do not wish to pickle all your cucumbers at once, (and they are much better when they are freshly pickled,) take them out of the salt and water, wash and drain them. Put the brine over the fire, boil and skim it; let it stand to get cold ; wash the pickle tub, wipe it dry, put the cucum- bers into it; examine each one that no specked ones may be put in the tub, pour the cold brine over them, wash the cloth and lid of the tub and replace them as before. Cucumbers will keep in this way all winter. They may be pickled a few at a time whenever they are wanted. They must be soaked twenty-four hours in cold water before they are pickled ; if they are so long in salt and water they imbibe too much salt to green them without soaking. Gherkins are done in the same way.THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 117 PICKLED BBBTS. 231. Boil your beets till tender, but not quite soft. To four large beets boil three eggs hard, re- move the shells; when the beets are done take off the skin by laying them for a few minutes in cold water and then stripping it off; slice them a quar- ter of an inch thick, put the eggs at the bottom, and then put in the beets with a little salt. Pour on cold vinegar enough to cover them. The eggs imbibe the color of the beets, and look beautiful on the table. PICKLED CHERRIES. 232. Pick over your cherries, remove all the specked ones. Put them into a jar, and pour over them as much hot vinegar and sugar as will cover them; to each gallon of vinegar allow four pounds of sugar. Boil and skim it and pour it hot over the fruit. Let it stand a week, then pour off the vinegar and boil it as before, pour it hot over the cherries the second time. As soon as they are cold tie them closely. TOMATO CATSUP, No. 1. 233. Boil half a bushel of tomatoes until they are soft, squeeze them through a fine wire sieve and add— One quart of vinegar^THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 118 Half a pint of salt, One ounce of cloves. Two ounces of whole allspice, Two ounces of ground cayenne pepper, A dessert spoonful of ground black pepper. Two heads of garlic skinned and separated. Mix the whole together and boil three hours; bottle without straining it. On the top of each bottle pour a table spoonful of sweet oil, cork them closely and seal them. The sweet oil by excluding the air tends to preserve the catsup. TOMATO CATSUP, No. 2. 234. Slice the tomatoes, put a layer in a deep vessel, and sprinkle over some salt; then another layer of tomatoes and salt till all are in. Stand them in the sun for two or three days, w^hen they are soft pass them through a sieve, and put the pulp, thus drained out, over the fire to boil. Add cayenne pepper, whole black pepper, mace, cloves, allspice, and a little race ginger if you like ; let it boil till it is thick, add a clove of garlic ; by tasting it you can judge if it is seasoned to your taste. When cold, bottle it off; put a table spoonful of sweet oil on the top of each bottle, and seal the corks.119 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. MUSHROOM CATSUP. 235. Procure fresh mushrooms, pick them care- fully, wipe them clean, and put a layer in the bot- tom of a pan, sprinkle over some salt, then another layer of mushrooms and more salt until all are in; cover the pan and let them stand two days, mash them well and strain them through a hair sieve. To each quart of the pulp add one ounce and a half of whole black pepper, half an ounce of whole allspice, and a few blades of mace. Boil it till re- duced to two-thirds the original quantity. When done pour it in a pan and stand it away till the next day, then pass it through a hair sieve and bot- tle it for use. Put it in small bottles, on the top of each pour a table spoonful of sweet oil to exclude the air. Cork them closely and rosin the corks. WALNUT CATSUP. 236. When your pickled walnuts are soft, mash them through the vinegar which covers them, strain it and boil it to a proper thickness. Bottle it, put a table spoonful of sweet oil on the top of each bot- tle, and cork them tightly; seal the corks and it will keep for several years. This catsup is excellent. PICKLED NASTURTIUMS. 237. Cut the green seeds of the nasturtiums120 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. with a piece of the stem to each. Put them in a jar of cold vinegar. PICKLED TOMATOES. 238. Take one peck of ripe tomatoes, prick them with a large needle, and lay them in strong salt and water eight days. Then take them out of the brine and lay them in vinegar and water for twenty-four hours. Scald a dozen small onions in vinegar and stand the whole away to get cold. Drain the tomatoes and add them to the cold onions and vinegar, with two wine-glasses of mus- tard-seed and an ounce of cloves. PASTRY. The flour for pastry should be of the whitest and finest quality. It should be mixed with a broad knife, as the moisture and warmth of the hand makes it heavy. The butter should be of the best quality, as if it is a little rancid it will taste. To make puff paste it should have all the salt washed out of it. Iron, or block tin plates are the best for baking pastry. Always use cold water (in summer iced water) to mix pastry, and if it cannot be baked immediate- ly, set it away in a cool place.ME KATIONAL COOK BOOK. 121 PUFF-PASTR 239. One pound of butter, One pound of flour. Wash your butter in cold water to extract al. the salt; work it well with a broad wooden spoon in order to get out all the water. Lay it between clean napkins, put it in a tin pan or plate, set it on the ice to get hard, but do not let it freeze. Sift your flour in a pan, cut the butter in four equal parts, cut one-fourth in very small pieces in the flour, but do not touch it, as the warmth of your hands will make the paste heavy. Add to the flour as much cold water as will make it a stiff* dough. Turn it out on your pie-board, roll it gently into sheets, cut one-third of the remainder of the butter into small pieces, and lay over it, sprinkle on a very little flour, fold it over, roll it out again, cut one- half of the butter which is left in small pieces and lay on, put on a little flour, and fold it as before, roll it out again, and put on the remainder of the butter. It vshould now be set on the ice, but should not come in contact with it. When it is perfectly cold, roll it out in a sheet thinner in the centre than at the edges of your pie, cut it with a very sharp knife the size you wish it. Fill with what- ever you choose, and bake in a tolerably quick oven. 11122 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK!. PLAIN PASTE. 240. One pound of floury Three-quarters of butter.

Stir in the salaeratus, and lastly the whites—but do not beat it after the whites have been added, as that will make it tough. Butter tea cups, or an earthen mould, pour in the batter, and bake it in a moderate oven.THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 159 Serve with butter and sugar, or any kind of sauce which may be preferred. They require from half an hour to three-quarters to bake. SNOW CUSTARD. 314. One quart of milk. Eight eggs. One vanilla bean, or a little grated lemo-n peel.

The whites of the eggs should only be broken, but not beaten till dry, or they will not adhere to the fruit.162 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK« GLASBD STRAWBERRIES 822. Choose large ripe strawberries, pick them off the vines so as the stems may all adhere to the fruit. Dip them one at a time in a vessel of cold water and place them on a sieve to dry. Beat the whites of two or three eggs, according to the quan- tity of fruit. The egg should be beaten very little or it will not adhere to the fruit, dip the berries in the egg one at a time, place them on a sieve so as not to touch each other, and sift powdered white sugar over them. They are very ornamental to a dessert table. Bunches of grapes, oranges peeled and quartered, or any small fruit may be done in the same manner. BTEWBD RIPB PEACHES. 323.

In the manufacture of cakes it is of very great importance that the materials be of a good quality* It is better to make a plain cake of good materials than a richer one of those of an mferior quality. Eggs should be beaten in a broad pan until they are thick^ the yelks when whisked alone will be as thick as batter. The whites when beaten by them- selves, should be dry and frothy, and appear full of small white grains. For most cakes the fine white pulverized sugar is best. The flour should always be sifted, as it renders the cakes lighter. Never warm butter in the pan it is to be beaten in, as it will be likely to make your cake heavy. If the weather is cold let the butter stand in the warm kitchen some time and it will be soft enough, the action of beating the butter and sugar, and the friction produced, softens the butter sufBciently. Never beat cakes with your hand, the warmth183 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. of the hand will make them streaked. Always use a wooden ladle for butter and sugar, or batter, and rods or switches for eggs.

Sift the flour, prepare the spice, wash, pick and dry the currants, and seed the raisins. With a wooden ladle beat the butter and sugar together in a deep pan. When it is smooth and light, beat the eggs. They should be whisked till they are thick, as the lightness of the cake depends in a great measure upon its being well beaten. Stir in a portion of the egg and flour into the butter and sugar, then a little more, till all is in and thorough- ly incorporated. Add the liquor and spice gradu- ally, and lastly the fruit, which must be well184 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. floured. Beat the whole fifteen minutes.

Fruit for preserving should be carefully selected, it should never be bruised, and always be of the largest kind and fairest quality. No sugar will make handsome preserves but the purest w^hite. It may be pulverized or in the loaf. Besides, it is a mistaken idea that low priced sugars are cheaper for preserves, for they must be boiled much longer in order to collect the great amountTHE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 221 of scum which arises on the syrup, consequently the evaporation reduces the quantity. Very little white of egg or isinglass is sufficient to clarify an ordinary sized kettle of syrup. If too much of either is used it froths on the surface and is of no utility. Preserves should always be boiled smartly ; many persons would be more successful with their pre- serving if they would let their fruit boil fast. When permitted to simmer it breaks in pieces. All jellies and preserves should be put in the jars while lukewarm, as the jelly or syrup, if it be thick, breaks after it has become cold ; the jars should be left open till the next day. Glass jars of a small size, or large tumblers, are better for preserves than china, for should they not keep well it can be detected imm.ediately. Each jar should have a piece of white paper cut the size of the top, dip the paper in brandy or spirits of wine and lay it on the preserves; then cut another piece about a quarter of an inch larger than the mouth of the jar; cut the edge of it in slits nearly a quarter of an inch long; cover this edge with paste, place the paper over the jar and lap the edge over on the side of the jar, which may easily be done, as the strips will lap one over the other. Each jar should have the name of the contents written on the cover. Preserves should be Icept in a cool dry place. 19^222 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK, CALF'S FOOT JELLY. 421, To one set of feet pour three quarts of water.

Cut up the jelly and put it in your preserving kettle, but be careful not to take the sediment which settles at the bottom. To each pint of this jelly add half a pound of the very best white sugar, and a quarter of an ounce of Russian isinglass dissolved in warm water^ one tea cupful of Madeira wine, and the juice and rind of two lemons. When the sugar is dissolved set the kettle over the fire and boil it for twenty minutes. Then pour it into your jelly bag and let it drip but do not squeeze the bag. As soon as it has all dripped through turn the bag, scrape it well but do not wash it, and strain your jelly again. Repeat this till it is perfectly clear. Pour it in the moulds while it is warm and let them stand open till the jelly is cold. When you wish to turn it out of the moulds wring a napkin out of hot water and wrap it round the moulds for a minute or two, then turn the moulds upside down, and the jelly will turn out. FOX GRAPE JELLY. 422. Take green fox grapes, wash them andTHE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 223 pui them in a preserving kettle with just water enough to pulp them. When they are tender mash and strain them through a sieve, to free them from the seeds and skin. To each pint of the pulp add a pound of the best white sugar, and a piece of isinglass about an inch square, dissolved in warm water. When the sugar has dissolved stir it well, and place the kettle over the fire. Let it boil fif- teen or twenty minutes, then try it by dropping a little in a glass of cold water, if it falls to the bot- tom without mixing with the w^ater the jelly is done. Pass it through a jelly bag, pour it into your glasses while warm, and let it stand till the next day be- fore the glasses are pasted. CRANBERRY JELLY", No. 1. 423. Pick and wash your cranberries, which should be very ripe, and put them over the fire with half a pint of water to each quart of cranber- ries. Stew them till they are soft, then mash them and strain the juice through a jelly bag; to each pint of juice add one pound of loaf or pulverized white sugar, with some isinglass, in the proportion of half an ounce to two quarts of juice. Dissolve the isinglass in as much warm water as will cover it; when perfectly dissolved, which will require a couple of hours, pour it in with the sugar and juice. When the sugar is dissolved set the kettle over the224 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. fire, and boil and skim it till a jelly is formed, which you can tell by dropping a little in a glass of cold water. If it falls to the bottom without min- gling with the water the jelly is done. When it is lukewarm pour it in glasses and let them stand till the following day, then cover them with brandy paper and paste them closely. CRANBERRY JELLY", No. 2. 424. Dissolve one ounce of Russian isino;]ass in three half-pints of warm water. Strain it through your flannel jelly-bag. Add to this three pints of cranberry juice with four pounds of sugar ; boil and skim it. As soon as the scum has ceased to rise strain it and put it in moulds. The sugar should be of the best quality. ORANGE JELLY. 425. Squeeze the juice from the oranges, and to every pint of the juice add a pound of sugar and a quarter of an ounce of dissolved isinglass. The Russian isinglass is the kind to use for this pur- pose. Boil and skim it till a jelly is formed, which you may tell by letting a drop fall in a glass of cold water, and if it falls to the bottom in a mass the jelly is done. Or, take a little out in a spoon and expose it to the cool air for a few minutes.THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 225 STRAWBERRY JELLY. 426. Stem the strawberries, put them in a pan, and with a w^ooden spoon or potato masher rub them fine. Put a sieve over a pan, and inside of the sieve spread a piece of thin muslin; strain the juice through this, and to a pint add one pound of sugar, with a quarter of an ounce of isinglass dis- solved in water to every five pounds of sugar. When the sugar is dissolved set the kettle over the fire and boil it till it is to a jelly. Pour it into glasses while it is warm, and paste them when cold. CURRANT JELLY. 427. Mash your fruit with a wooden spoon, and squeeze the juice through your jelly bag. To every pint of juice allow a pound of w^hite sugar. When the sugar is dissolved, add a piece of isin- glass dissolved in w^arm water to clarify the jelly. A quarter of an ounce of isinglass to five pints of juice will be sufficient. Boil and skim it till a jelly is formed ; then take it off the fire and put it in glasses while warm. The next day put brandy paper over them and paste them. Black currant jelly is made in the same w^ay, only it requires but three-quarters of a pound of sugar to a pint of juice.226 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. QUINCE JBLLir. 428. Pare and core your quinces, and as you pare them throw them into cold water. Put them into a preserving kettle with w^ater enough to cover them, and let them boil till the fruit is tender. Then put a sieve over a pan, pour the fruit and water into it and let it drain, but do not mash the fruit; strain the juice through the jelly bag. To each pint of juice thus obtained add one pound of loaf or pulverized white sugar; and to every five pounds of sugar add a quarter of an ounce of isin- glass dissolved in hot water. When the sugar is dissolved put it over the fire and boil and skim it till a jelly is formed, which you can discover by dropping a little in a glass of cold water; if it sinks to the bottom without mingling wdth the water the jelly is done. Pour it in your glasses when it is lukew^arm, and let them stand open till it is entire- ly cold. Cover with brandy paper, and paste paper over the top. If you wish to have light colored jelly, never put in the parings, as they always make it dark. A jelly may be made of the parings and cores for family use. Apple jelly may be made in the same manner as the quince. The pulp of the apple, which is left after the jelly is made, may be sweetened for pies. The pulp of the quince may be made into marma- lade according to the following receipt:227 %im NATIONAL COOK BOOK. QUINCB MARMALADE. 429. To each pound of the pulp obtained ac- cording to the above receipt for jelly, add one pound of white sugar; boil the whole until it is perfectly smooth. It must be stirred all the time it is boiling. If you do not make jelly of your quinces cut them up in small pieces, add a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit, and as much water as will dissolve the sugar; then boil it till it is a per- fectly smooth paste; stir it all the time. PBACH. MARMALADE. 430. Pare and cut up the peaches in small pieces, and to a pound of fruit add a pound of sugar.

Pare and core the fruit, cut them in quar- ters, and boil them in water untill tender. Weigli the fruit and add a pound of sugar to each pound of fruit. Put the sugar in a preserving-kettle with two wine-glasses of water to each pound of sugar, and a quarter of an ounce of isinglass dissolved in warm water to every six pounds of fruit. When the sugar is dissolved set it over the fire, boil and skim it till no more scum rises. Then pour the syrup in another vessel, wash the kettle so as to free it from any scum which may adhere to it, pour the jelly back in the kettle and put in the fruit. Set it over a brisk fire and let it boil for about an hour and a half, or until the fruit looks clear when held towards the light. It should always boil hard or the preserves will be dark colored. When it appears translucent take it off the fire; take the fruit out a piece at a time, and lay it on broad dishes. Strain the syrup, and when it is lukewarm put the fruit in your jars and pour the syrup over. When cold cover with brandy paper and paste them closely. PK^SERVSD PINE-APPLE. 433.

Wring out the stones by placing one hand on each half of the peach and suddenly giv(^ each a turn in opposite directions; the fruit w^ill break in half, leaving the stone attached to one side. With a pointed knife it may easily be ex- tracted. After the peaches have all been prepared in this m^anner pare and w^eigh them. Then weigh a pound of sugar for each pound of fruit. Put the sugar into a preserving kettle, and allow a gill of water to each pound of sugar. Let the sugar stand until it is perfectly dissolved before it is put on the fire; to ten pounds of sugar add the half of the white of an egg, w-ell beaten, or a piece of Russian isinglass, about an inch square, dissolved in two table spoonsful of w^ater. Set the kettle over the fire, and as soon as the syrup begins to boil skim it. When the scum has ceased to rise, take the syrup off the fire, pour it into a pan, and w^ash the kettle in order to prevent the scum which adheres to the sides from boiling into the fruit.

Cut off the hard rind of the melon (which should be the preserving citron^ not the green can* telope) and cut it in pieces of any size and shape you choose: the slices should be from a quarter to half an inch thick. Weigh your fruit, and to every pound add one of sugar. Put the sugar in a pre- serving kettle w^ith a gill of water to each pound of sugar and some isinglass dissolved in warm water; it will require a quarter of an ounce of isinglass to every five pounds of fruit. When the sugar is dissolved, put it over the fire and boil and231 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. skim it. Then pour the syrup out of the kettle, wash it and return the syrup to it. Now put in the fruit, and set it over a brisk fire, where it will boil rapidly. When the fruit appears translucent when held up towards the light it is done. It wdli take from an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half to cook it. Then take it out a piece at a time, spread it on dishes, and strain the syrup in a pan. When the syrup is lukewarm, put your fruit in the jars and pour it over. Let them stand till next day, put brandy paper over and paste them. This fruit may be flavored wdth lemons sliced and preserved with it. Do not peel the lemons, cut them in thin slices, and cook them with the fruit. To three pounds of fruit add one lemon. As the citron makes a beautiful but tasteless preserve, it is necessary to flavor it with lemon, orange, or some other fruit. If, w^hen it is a little cool, it should not taste sufficiently of the lemon, a few drops of the essence of lemon may be added. PRESERVED GREEN GAGES. 437. Prepare the fruit by pricking each one with a needle to prevent them from bursting. Leave a portion of the stem on each, as it gives small fruits a handsome appearance on the table. Make a syrup of a pound of sugar to each pound of fruit; and a gill of water to a pound of sugar.232 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. Add a quarter of an ounce of isinglass^ dissolved in warm water, to every six pounds of sugar. When the sugar is dissolved put it with the dissolved isinglass over the fire, boil and skim it. Then pour it out of the kettle, wash the kettle, put the syrup back again, put in the fruit, and boil it till by holding one towards the light it looks clear. Take the gages out one at a time, strain the syrup; put the fruit in jars, and pour the syrup over warm. Paste them up the next day. PRESERVED PLUMS. 438. These are preserved in the same manner as gages, only they are skinned by pouring hot water over them ; the skins will peel off nicely and leave the stems attached to the fruit. BTRAWBERRT JAM. 439. Put together equal ^veights of fruit and sugar, mash all well, put it into a preserving kettle, and boil it about tvrenty minutes. While it is warm put it in jars, and paste it when cold.

To a pound of ft^uit weigh a pound of sugar; mash the fruit in a pan w^ith a wooden spoon ; put the sugar to it, and boil it hard for fif- teen or twenty minutes. To four pounds of raspberries you may add one pound of ripe currants; they give the jam a fine flavor and a pretty color. Blackberry jam is made in the same manner; only leave out the currants. GREBIT GAGE JAM. 442. Wash the fruit, and stew it with enough water to keep them from scorching. Mash them, and strain the pulp through a colander. To a pint of pulp add a pound of sugar. When the sugar is dissolved, boil it till it is a smooth mass. Plum jam is made in the same way. PINE app:.b jam. 443.

Take them out and throw them in a vessel of cold water, when all are done in this manner, rub off the skins with a cloth, and throw them in another vessel of cold water. Make a syrup of half a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. Prepare it in the same man- ner as for preserves; put in your peaches, and let them boil until they are sufficiently tender to be easily pierced with a straw. Take them out, and add to each pint of syrup a quart cf the very best white brandy, when the fruit is cool put it in your jars, but leave plenty of room to fill them with the syrup, as if packed too closely they lose their shape.

Drain it and add to it three gills of good milk; put it over the fire and let it simmer until the sago is entirely incorporated with the milk. Sweeten it with white sugar. It may be flavored with va- nilla, lemon, or nutmeg, if allowed of by the phy- sician. ORGEAT. 447. Blanch one ounce of bitter, and two of sweet almonds. Pound them in a mortar w4th a little milk until they are to a paste. Rub gradu- ally into the pounded almond one tea cupful of milk. Sweeten it to the taste and strain it. It may be flavored with lemon. STEWED PRUNES. 448. Pour enough boiling water over your prunes to cover them, and stand them where they will keep hot but not boil. They require six or eight hours to cook. When they are perfectly done add sugar to the taste of the patient. COCOA. 449. Put three table spoonsful of cocoa to a pint of water.

Pick and wash a table spoonful of tapioca, pour over it a pint of warm milk, and stand it near the fire for about one hour, but do not let it sim- mer. Then boil it until it forms a semi-transparent mucilage. Stand it aside to cool. Beat two eggs, stir them into the mucilage with as much sugar as will sweeten it, pour the mixture in a pan and bake it slowly. It may be eaten with sweet sauce. Arrow-root and sago can be made in the same manner, only the sago requires more soaking and boiling than the tapioca. ARROW-ROOT PUDDING FOR INVALIDS. 453. See tapioca pudding. No. 452. PUDDING FOR THE CONVALESCENT. 454. One pint of milk, Two table spoonsful of flour,THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 237 Three eggs, Sugar to the taste. Beat the eggs, add the sugar, then the milk and flour by turns.

Have ready half a pint of new milk sweetened with white sugar, stir the egg into the milk, and serve it with a piece of sponge-cake or slice of toast. It is considered very light, nour- ishing food for an invalid. Some prefer the yelk and w^hite of the egg beaten separately. The yelk should be beaten till it is very light and thick, then pour it into the sweet- ened milk; afterwards beat the white till it willTHE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 238 staml alone, and add gradually half a tea spoonful of white sugar; pile the white on the top of the milk and serve as before. SUGARED ORANGE. 457. Select the lightest colored oranges for this purpose, as they are more acid than the dark. Peel off the rind and slice them, latitudinally or cross- wise, about the eighth of an inch in thickness. Strew over them some powdered white sugar, in the proportion of a tea spoonful of sugar to each slice. Let them stand fifteen minutes. They are very palatable in fevers, as they serve to cleanse the mouth and keep it cool. SUGARED LEMONS, No. 1. 458. These may be prepared in the same man- ner as the sugared oranges (see above,) only they should have a tea spoonful and a half of sugar to each slice; as they are more firm than oranges, they require to stand longer to become perfectly impregnated with the sugar. They are better to stand about an hour before they are to be eaten. The w^hite skin should be carefully peeled off, as it imparts an unpleasant bitter flavor when permitted to remain long in the sugar. These are very grateful to the sick and feverish.THE NATIONAL COOK SOOK. §39 SUGARED LEMONS, No. 2. 459. Select fine large lemons. Peel off the Outer skin and as much as possible of the white skin. Cut them in slices latitudinally or round the lemon, about the eight of an inch thick. Sprinkle them with white powdered sugar, a tea spoonful of sugar to each slice. Let them stand three hours, then strain off as much of the juice as possible from the lemons, put it in a sauce-pan over a slow fire, and as soon as the juice begins to simmer throw in the slices of lemon. Let them cook five minutes, take them out and pour the syrup over them. Should the lemons not prove sufficiently juicy to melt the sugar entirely, a little water may be added* MULLED WINE. 460.

Let them boil slowly until they are tender, butTHE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 244 not broken to pieces, then dish thern, and if not quite salt enough, a little may be sprinkled over them. Care should be taken to season the meat for an invalid with very little salt, as it is frequent- ly very unpalatable during convalescence. After the sweet-breads have been cooked as* above described, they may be taken from the water and drained ; then heat the gridiron, grease the bars, to prevent the sweet-breads from sticking, and broil them quickly over some hot coals. They should be of a very delicate brow^n when done. PANADA, No. 1. 473. Mix two tea spoonsful of grated cracker, with a little cold w^ater, and stir it into half a pint of boiling water.

Cover the vessel, and stand it in a warm place until a mucilage is formed. Be careful to keep it closely covered, as it soon becomes stringy if exposed to the air. When sweetened and flavored with lemon- juice it is a very palatable drink. The lemon-juice should be scalded. VEAL TEA. 490. Cut one pound of a knuckle of veal in thin slices, pour over it a quart of cold water. Cove^^ it, and let it simmer for an hour and a'half. When boiled to a jelly it will keep for three or four days, and may be used at any time by pouring over it a little boiling water and letting it stand near the fire. Add salt to the taste. BEEF TEA. 491. One pound of beef, One quart of cold water. Cut the beef in thin slices, and pour on the wa- ter. Cover it and set it in a warm place for three- quarters of an hour, then put it over a slow fire where it will simmer for half an hour. Strain it,THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 251 and serve it hot or cold as recommended by the physician. Salt it to the taste. ESSENCE BEEP. 492. Select some lean, tender beefj cut it in small pieces, put them in a bottle and cork it. Set the bottle in a pot of cold water, let the water boil six hours. The heat of the water will extract all the juice from the beef in the bottle* MUTTON- TEA. 490. Slice one pound of mutton, remove all the fat, and add one quart of cold water. Cover it, place it near the fire for an hour, then simmer it for two hours, strain it, and serve it warm. Add salt to the taste. CHICKEN TEA. 494. Cut a quarter of a chicken in small pieces^ take off the skin, and remove all the fat, add to it a pint of cold water; cover it, and let it simmer till reduced to one-half.

Wash and pick one ounce of pearl barley 5 pour over it one tea cupful of water^ and let it boil for ten minutes. Drain it, and pour over it three tea cupsful of boiling water; set it over the fire, and boil it down one half. Strain it through a hair sieve or piece of muslin. Gum arable is sometimes dissolved in it; the liquid sweetened to the taste, forms a very agreea-* ble drink. TOAST WAT'ER. 501. Toast two or three slices of bread of a dark brown all the way through, but do not burn it. Put the toast in a deep bowlj and pour over it one quart of water, let it stand for two or three hours. Then pour the w^ater from the bread. Some flavor it by soaking a piece of lemon-peel with the bread. ALMOND Water. 502. One ounce of sweet almonds (blanched,) Half an ounce of white powdered sugar^ Three half pints of water. 22TU^ NATIONAL COOK BOOK:* 254 Pour boiling water on the almondsj and in a few minutes the brown skin will come off oy taking each kernel between the thumb and finger and gently pressing it. After having blanched them in this manner^ put them in a stone or wedgewooil mortar with the sugar and a little water. Add the water gradually until the almond is perfectly smooth. Strain it through a fine hair sieve or cloth* More or less sugar may be added according to the taste* MISCELLANEOUS. LEMON STRUP, No. 1. 503. Eight pounds of sugar^ Three quarts of waterj One quart of lemon-juice.

One pound of green ginger root, Ten pounds of sugar. Two gallons of water. Cut up the root in pieces and add to it two gallons of w^ater; boil it till reduced to one gallon, strain it, and pour it over ten pounds of white su- gar. When the sugar has dissolved boil and skira it till no more scum rises * take it off, and when cold bottle it for use. BRANDY CHERRIES. 506. Stem your cherries, put them into a jar, and to a pound of fruit put a pound of white sugar. Cover them with French brandy and tie them closely. Monongahela whisky will do as w^ell as the brandy and is much cheaper. TO PRESERVE EGGS DURING THE WmTEF. 507. In the fall as you collect your eggs, pack them in a keg with a layer of salt at the bottom, then a layer of eggs, set in with the small end dow^nwards, then a layer of salt, and so on till all are in; then put a layer of salt on the top.256 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. BLACKBERRY- CORDIAL. 50S. Gather the ripest fruit, mash it in a pan with a large wooden spoon, strain out all the juice, and allow a quarter of a pound of sugar to a pint of the juice. Mix the juice and sugar together, and boil and skim it; then strain it again, and when cool to each pint of juice add a tea cupful of brandy. Bottle it and it will be fit for use. This is highly esteemed by some in cases of dysentery. RASPBERRY BRANDY. 509. Pick the fruit when dry, put it into a glass jar, and place the jar in a kettle of cold w^ater. Set the kettle over the fire and let the water get hot; let the fruit remain thus until the juice will run ; strain it, and to every pint of juice add half a pound of sugar. Boil and skim it. When cold mix with it an equal quantity of brandy. Bottle it tightly. CURRANT SHRUB. 510. Mix a pound of sugar w^ith every pint of currant-juice. When the sugar is dissolved boil it a few minutes and skim it. When almost cold add a gill of brandy to every quart of syrup. Bottle it, cork it well, and keep it in a cool place.THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 257 RASPBERRY SHRUB. 511. This is made in the same manner as the currant shrub. CHERRY BOUNCE. 512. To fifteen pounds of morella cherries add one gallon of the best French brandy or good Mo- nongahela whisky. Let them stand for three or four months, then pour off the liquor and add to the cherries two quarts of w^ater, which should re- main on them for three weeks; pour off the water and add it to the liquor; to all of which add four pounds of sugar made into a syrup. MIXTURE FOR SALTING BUTTER. 513. Half a pound of fine salt, A quarter of a pound of pulverized loaf sugar. Mix them well together, and add one ounce of the mixture to every pound of butter. This is to keep butter sweet for winter use. EGG-NOG. 514. Six eggs. One pint of milk, Half a pound of loaf sugar, Half a pint of brandy. 22*THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. Beat the eggs very light and thick, add the milk sugar and brandy. MINCED MEAT. 515. Five pounds of beef or tongue. Two pounds of suet. Seven pounds of sugar. Seven pounds of apples, Three pounds of raisins. Three pounds of currants, Three nutmegs, Two ounces of cinnamon, A dessert spoonful of ground allspice. One small tea spoonful of ground mace, The juice of two lemons and the grated rind of one. Moisten it with equal portions of wine and cider, Brandy to the taste. Boil the meat in water which has been salted in the proportion of one tea spoonful of salt to every quart of water. When it is tender stand it away to get perfectly cold before it is chopped. Wash, pick and dry your currants, prepare the spices, and seed the raisins. Pare and core the apples, chop them fine, chop the meat very fine, add the fruit, sugar and spice, lemon-juice, and grated lemon rind, (also the brandy and wine.) Mix the wholeTHE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 259 thoroughly ; it will be fit for use on the following day. If you wish to keep your minced meat for several weeks, chop the meat and add the currants, raisins, sugar and spice, but leave out the apples, lemon, wine and cider; mix the other ingredients and merely moisten it with brandy ; pack the mix- ture tightly in a stone jar and cover it close. When you wish to make it into pies, take out some of the meat, chop your apples, and mix with it in the proportions given above. Moisten with cider, and add wine and brandy to your taste. SANDWICHES. 516. These are generally made of cold boiled ham or tongue. Slice your ham or tongue as thin as possible. Then butter your bread on the loaf, and with a very sharp knife cut it in very thin slices. Roll in each slice of bread a slice of the ham or tongue. A cold fried oyster is very nice in each sandwich. WINE SANGAREE. 517. Mix equal portions of wine and water, sweeten it to your taste, and grate nutmeg over the top. Ale or porter sangaree is made in the same manner.260 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. POACHED SGGJ-S. 51S. Have a broad shallow vessel of boiling water. Break your eggs in a plate, and be care- ful not to break the yelks. Take the water from the fire, slide the eggs carefully into it one at a time, and then put them over the fire again. Whilst they are boiling thro\v the water over the yelks with a spoon, and as soon as the whites are thick take them out with an egg slice. Trim them neatly and send them to the table hot. PLAIN OMELETTE. 519. Beat four eggs very light. Have ready a pan of hot butter, pour the beaten eggs into it, and fry it till it is of a fine brown on the under side, then lap one half over the other, and serve it hot. Just before you lap it, sprinkle a little salt and pepper over the top. Chopped parsley or onion may be mixed with the egg before it is fried. HAM OMELETTE. 520. Whisk four eggs very light, and add to it as much grated ham as will flavor it. Fry it in hot butter till it is brown on the lower side. Sprin- kle salt and pepper over it, and fold one half over the other. The salt should not be put in the egg, as it thins it. Garnish the dish with green parsley.THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 261 BREAD OMELBTTS 521. One gill of bread crumbs, Eight eggs, A gill and a half of cream. Pepper and salt to the taste. Warm the cream and pour it over a gill of ba- ker's bread crumbs; when the bread is perfectly soft mash it well with the cream, and add pepper and salt to the taste. Beat the eggs and stir them into the bread and cream. Have a pan of hot but- ter, pour the mixture in and fry it. Do not turn it as that will make it heavy. The top may be browned with a salamander, or the pan of the shovel heated very hot and held near it will brown it. It may be folded one half over the other; in that case it need not be browned with a sala- mander. TOMATO OMELETTE. 522. Six eggs, A wine-glass of flour, Four ripe tomatoes. Pepper and salt to the taste, Milk sufficient to mix the flour smoothly. Beat the eggs very light, stir in the mixed milk and flour, peel and chop the tomatoes and add with the pepper and salt. Have a pan with someTHE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 262 hot butter, pour in the mixture and fry it. When done it may be lapped half over or not, according to the fancy. Do not turn it. BROV/ITBD FLOUR. 523. This is very useful to thicken gravy and give it a brown color. Put your flour into a pan, and set it over a mode- rate fire, stir it all the time till it is brown, but do not let it scorch, as it will communicate an unplea- sant taste to your gravy. When it is cool put it in a jar for future use. DRI3D CHBRRIBB, FOR PIES. 524. Pick your cherries, and w-ash them tho- roughly through several waters to remove all the grit. Put them into a stone jar with half a pound of sugar to a pound of cherries, and w^arm water enough to cover them. Place your jar in a vessel of water and set it where it will keep hot. Let them stand for twelve hours. If the w^ater should soak into the cherries and leave them too dry, add a little more. When they are fully swollen and perfectly soft they are fit for use. If they are not sweet enough add more sugar. Dried fruits are more tender and juicy cooked in this manner than when they are boiled or stewed.263 THE NATlOKAL COOK BOOK. DRIED APPLES, FOR PIES. 525. Pick and wash them well. Then pour over boiling Water enough to cover them. Let them stand all night to soak. In the morning put the apples with the Water they were soaked in into your stew-pauj if they have absorbed all the water and are nearly dry, add a little more, smjmer them slowly^ but do not let them boil. When perfectly soft, pass them through a sieve, and prepare them for pies according to the directions given for apples which have not been dried. DRIED PEACHES, FOR PlEB. 526. These are cooked in the same manner as dried apples (see above,) only they are flavored with a piece of lemon or orange-peel stewed with them* When they are done, take out the peel and mash them, add sugar to the taste. They require no butter. DRIED PUMPKIISr, FOR PIES 527. Cut a pumpkin in half lengthwise, take out the seeds, pare off the rind, and cut it in slices about an inch thick. String it on fine twine and hang it in a dry place. In the winter stew and use it as green pumpkin. The cheese-shaped pumpkin is the best kind for drying.264 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK* TO PREPARE S-AL-^RATUS. 528. Put the salseratus in a vesselj add enough cold water to dissolve it, then pour off the liquid into a bottle and cork it. Be careful to pour it off gently as a great deal of sediment settles at the bottom of the vessel in which it is dissolved* Carbonate of ammonia is much nicer than salse* ratus ; it is prepared'in the same manner; be care- ful to keep the bottle corked, and keep it in a cool place. It may be used in all the receipts where salsera- tus is directed ; but only half the quantity is neces- sary—thus: if one table spoonful of the salseratus is required, half a table spoonful of ammonia will be sufficient. LEMONADE.. 529. One quart of lemon-juiccj Nine quarts of water, Eight pounds of white sugar. Mix the lemon-juice and sugar, and stand it away. Just before the lemonade is served, add the water which should be iced. PUNCH. 530. Four pounds of sugar, One pint of lemon-juice, One pint of Jamaica spirits,THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 265 Half a pint of peach brandy, Half a pint of French brandy. Five quarts of water. The quantity of liquor may be regulated accord ^ ing to the taste. MACARONI. 531. A quarter of a pound of macaroni. One tea spoonful of butter. One gill of milk or cream. One table spoonful of grated checsCo Boil the macaroni in water that has been salted in the proportion of a tea spoonful of salt to a quart of water. When it is tender take it out of the water and place it on a sieve, or in a colander, to drain. Boil a gill of milk or cream, and add to it a tea spoonful of butter rolled in flour, let it boil half a minute. Put your macaroni, after it is w^ell drained, into a stew-pan, pour this boiled cream over it, and add to it the grated cheese. Let it get very hot, but do not let it boil, and serve it. mDIAN MUBH, 532. Two quarts of water. Two tea spoonsful of salt. As much Indian meal as will make a thick batter. 23THE NATIONAL COOK BOOi^* 266 Have a pot with two quarts of boiling water^ add the salt as above, and stir in very gradually as much Indian meal as will form a thick batter. Let it boil half an hour, and beat it hard all the time it is cooking, which will make it light when done. This is generally eaten with new milk, or some- times with molasses and butter. FHIED MUSH. 533. The mush is prepared as in the above re- ceipt. Let it get cold, cut it in slices, flour them on both sides, and fry them of a light brown* WELSH RABBIT. 534. Cut some old rich cheese in very thin pieces, add to it a spoonful of cream. Put it over a slow fire and let it stand until the cheese is en- tirely dissolved. Serve it with toast. Some like pepper and mus- tard. MINT JULBF. 535. Take young mint, pick off the leaves, wash them, and to one tumbler of leaves add one tumbler of brandy and Jamaica spirits mixed. Pour the liquor on the mint to extract the flavor, then strain it off* on a tumbler of sugar; when the sugarTHE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 267 is dissolved, add a tumbler of ice finely pounded. Stir all well together. MILK PUNCH 536. Sweeten a half pint of rich milk to the taste. Add to this half a table spoonful of fourth proof brandy. COTTAGE CHEESE. 537. Put some sour milk in a warm place until the whey begins to separate from the curd, but by no means let it get hard. Pour the curd into a three cornered bag in the shape of* a pudding bag, hang it up and let it drain until no more water will drip from it. Then turn it out into a pan, mash the curd very fine and smooth wdth a wooden spoon; add as much good rich cream, as w^ill make it about as thick as batter. Salt it to your taster Sprinkle pepper over the top if you choose. TO PREPARE BENNBT. 538. Get a dried rennet in market, wash it in lukewarm w^ater, but do not scrape it. Cut it up in small pieces, put them in a bottle, and pour over them a quart of Lisbon wine. After this has stood for a w^eek a table spoonful of the wine w^ill turn a quart of milk. Or if the use of wine is objectiona- ble, the rennet may be preserved by hanging it in aTHE NATIONAL COOK BOOK, 268 cool dry place. And then every time you wish to use it, cut off a piece, wash it, and soak it in warm water; the water it is soaked in will torn the milk. TO CURE HAMS. 539. The following is the Newbold receipt for curing hams. Seven pounds of coarse salt. Five pounds of brown sugar^ Half an ounce of pearl-ash, two ounces of saltpetre, Four gallons of water. Boil the above ingredients together, and skina the pickle when cold. Pour it over your haras, and let them remain in it eight weeks. The above proportions are for one hundred pounds of meat. TO PREP ARB APPLES FOR PIES. 540. Pare and core j^our apples, cut them in slices, and throw them into cold water. Then take them out of the water, put them into a stew-pan; if the apples are tender, the water which adheres to them will be sufficient to cook them ; if not, a little more may be added. Cover the stew-pan, and place them near the fire. Let them stew^ till they are soft and burst; then mash them, and add half an ounce of butter to each pint of the stewed ap-THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 269 pie. When they get nearly cold, add sugar, rose- water, and nutmeg to the taste. TO CURE DRIED BEEP. 541. For one hundred pounds of beef: Seven pounds of coarse salt, Five pounds of brown sugar, Half an ounce of pearl-ash, two ounces of saltpetre. Four gallons of water Boil the sugar, salt, pearl-ash, saltpetre and water together, skim it and pour it over the meat when it is cold. At the end of three weeks take out your beef. This is the celebrated Newbokl receipt. TO CURE BEEP AND HAMS. 542. Half a bushel of fine salt. Half a pound of saltpetre. Half a gallon of molasses. Mix the salt, saltpetre, and molasses together well with your hands, until the mixture resembles brown sugar. Rub the meat well with this mixture, then place it in your tubs, with the fleshy side up; it should have a coating of the salt, &c., at least half an inch thick. At the end of ten days, or two weeks 23*270 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK, at farthest^ take out your beef^ and hang it in a dry place. Hams should remain in the salt from five to six weeks. Never smoke beef. Hams would be better if not smoked. TO CURB BHAD. 543. Clean the shad nicely, place them in lay- ers with back down, and laid open so as the inside of the fish may be up. Sprinkle each fish plenti- fully with ground salt, and let them stand twenty- four hours. This draws out all the blood. Wipe them all dry with clean napkins. Place them in layers in a clean tub, with the backs down as before. For one-hundred shad take half a pound of saltpetre, and two pounds of brown sugar. Strew plenty of rock salt over them with the saltpetre and sugar, there is no danger of putting on too much salt as they will only absorb a certain quantity. TO HO AST COFFEE. 544. Pick the black or imperfect grains from the coffee. Put it in a pan, and stir it all the time it is roasting; when done it should be the color of the hull of a ripe chestnut. It should be brown all through, but not black. About ten minutes before it is done add to two pounds of coffee halfTHE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 271 an ounce of butter. Whilst hot put it in a box and cover it closely. COFFEE. 545. Beat an egg; and to one tea cupful of ground coffee add one-third of the beaten egg, and as much cold water as will just moisten the coffee; do not put in much cold water, stir all well to- gether, put the mixture in your coffee pot, and pour over it six tea cupsful of boiling water. Let it boil hard for ten or fifteen minutes. When it . begins to boil stir it frequently, and never leave it until the grounds sink, which they will do in a few minutes after it has been on the fire. Be careful and do not let your coffee boil over, as by that means you lose a great deal of the grounds and consequently the coffee v/ill be weakened. Rinse your pot, if it be silver or britania metal, with boiling water, pour the coffee into it, and serve it hot. Coffee and tea lose much of their flavor if served cold. CHOCOLATE. 546. Shave down three ounces of chocolate, over this pour enough hot water to dissolve it; mix it to a smooth paste, put it in a pipkin, and add one quart of boiling water. Place it on the fire, stir it occasionall}/, and let it boil fifteen272 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. minutes, then add one tea cupful of rich milk or cream. Let it boil a minute or two longer, pour it off, and send it to the table. Chocolate retains its heat longer than either tea or coffee. Never boil chocolate in your coffee pot as it would be likely to impart to the coffee an unplea- sant flavor. TEA. 547. Scald your tea pot with boiling water, and allow a tea spoonful of tea for each person and one over. Pour enough boiling water on the tea leaves to rather more than wet them. Let it stand fifteen minutes ; pour on as much boiling water as will serve one cup to each one of the company. As soon as the first cups are poured out, add half a tea spoonful for each person, and pour on some boiling water. The most convenient article for hot water is an urn w^ith an iron heater inside which keeps it boiling on the table. But water may be kept sufficiently hot in an ordinary tea pot. Some who are particular about their tea, stop the spout of the tea pot with a cork, while the tea is drawing, to retain the aroma. Tea and coffee pots should always be set away with the lids off. TO MAKE YEAST. 54S. Boil a tea cupful of hops in one quart of273 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. water till reduced to one half. Strain it throuoh a sieve, and add one wine glassful of salt. Return the hot water into the vessel it was boiled in. Mix some flour with cold w^-iter, and stir in so as to make it about the consistency of thick molasses. Let it boil a few minutes, then take it off the fire, and set it away to cool; when lukewarm, add some yeast, and when it rises put it into a stone jar; which should not be filled, cover it, and the fol- lowing day it will be fit for use. As the yeast is so well salted there is no neces- sity to put salt in the bread. You should always have a vessel on purpose to boil hops. POTATO Y-BAST. 549. Boil some potatoes, mash them, and to six potatoes add one gill of flour. Stir in as much water as will make the whole into a thick batter; add some yeast and a wine glassful of salt. When it is light, put it in your jar and cover it. BREAD. 550. Set a sponge at night of a pound of flour, a little salt, if your yeast should not be salt enough, a gill of yeast, and water enough to make a thick batter. In the morning stir in as much flour as will form a dough, knead it well, and if the wea- ther is cold set it in a warm place to rise. WhenTHE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 274 it is light grease your pans, mould out the dough in loaves, put them in the pans, and as soon as they rise again bake them. If the weather is cold, set your sponge with lukewarm water, place it near the fire to rise. But in summer it should be set with cold water, and not be placed near the fire. It is better in warm weather to put the dough in your pans as soon as the flour is added to the sponge and the dough well kneaded, as if permitted to stand it might turn sour. Bread is much nicer baked in small loaves. POTATO BHEAD. 551. Boil some potatoes, mash them fine, and add as much warm water as will make a mixture about as thick as cream. Pass it through a sieve in order to extract all the lumps. When cool add a little salt, some yeast, and as much flour as will make a very thick batter. The next morning stir in enough flour to make a dough. Knead it w^ell, let it rise, when light grease your pans, mould it out gently into loaves, put them in the pans, let them stand till they rise again, then bake them. This bread may be made with milk instead of water, but it is best when eaten fresh, as it soon becomes dry.THE NATIONAL COOk BOOK. 275 MUSH BREAD. 552. Make some thin Indian mush, (see No. 532,) when cool acid a little salt and flour enough to make a thick batter, stir in some yeast. Let it stand all night to rise, in the morning add flour enough to form a dough. Knead it well, set it to rise; when light mould it out in loaves, grease your pans, and when it gets light again bake it. RTB BREAD. 553. This is made in the same manner as wheat, (No. 550,) only it must have more rye flour to make a stiffer dough, and requires more kneading. It takes rather longer to bake than wheat bread. DTSFEPTIO BREAD. 554. This bread is made of unbolted flour in- stead of that in general use. It is made in the same manner as bread, (No. 550,) knead it very well and be careful to have it thoroughly baked. Toast made of this bread is very good. FRIED BREAD. 555. Slice some bread, stale is better than fresh ; pour over it enough rich milk or cream, if you have it, to moisten it. Eeat an egg, dip eachTiEiie j^ational cook Booit. slice of the bread in the eggj and fry them brown on both sides. Season the bread with pepper and salt to your taste. COMMON MUSTARD. 556. One table spoonful of ground mustard. One tea spoonful of sugarj One salt spoonful of salt. Mix the salt, sugar, and mustard together, and then pour on some boiling w^ater gradually, stir it wath a horn spoon or knife till it is quite smooth. Some like it quite thick^ others prefer it so thin as to run on the plate, lOma FOR CAKES. 657. Beat the whites of two eggs till they are very dry, then add gradually ten ounces of pulve- rized white sugar. Dredge flour over the top of the cake and wipe it off, to make the icing adhere. Put it over with a broad bladed knife; it should be put on quite thick. When this coating is dry, di- lute the remainder of the icing on your dish with a little rose-water, and put another coating over the top, which wi\] have a glossy appearance. TO DR^ HBRBS. 558. They should be picked just before the277 plant blossoms, wash them to free them from the dust, place them on a sieve to drain. Then put them in the oven after the bread has been drawn out, and let them remain in it till they are perfectly dry. Rub them from the stalks, put them in glass jars and cover them closely* RASPBERRY* VIHEGAR. 559. Take ripe raspberries, put them in a pan^ and mash them with a large wooden spoon or masher. Strain the juice through a jelly bag, and to each pint of juice add one pound of loaf sugar and one quart of vinegar. When the sugar has dissolved place the whole over the fire in a pre- serving kettle, and let it boil a minute or two and skim it. When cold bottle it, cork it well, and it will be fit for use. CBLERY VINBG-AR. 560. Put half a pint of celery seed into a quart of vinegar; bottle it, and in a month it will be fit for use. It must be strained before it is put in the castor bottle. PS3PPEH VINBGAR. 561. Put the coral peppers in a bottle, and pour over vinegar enough to cover them.2^8 fll^ KAtlOKAL COOK soon. MOLASSES CANDT. 562* One quart of West India molasses, Half a pound of brown sugar^ The juice of one lemoti. Put the molasses in a kettle with the sugarj boil it over a slowj steady fire till it is done, which you can easily tell by dropping a little in cold water, if done it will be crisp, if not, it will be stringy* A good way to judge if it is boiled enough is to let it boil till it stops bubbling. Stir it very frequently, and just before it is taken off the fire add the lemon* juice. Butter a shallow tin pan, and pour it in to get cold. Molasses candy may be flavored with any thing you choose. Some flavor with lemon, and ad:'^ roasted ground-nuts, or almonds blanched.

Stem the currants and wash them; then pour enough boiling water over them to cover them, and let them stand while you prepare the paste. Line the bottom of your pie- r^ates with paste, drain your fruit through the co- lander and fill your plates, adding half a pound of sugar to a pint of currants, or in that proportion. Dredge a little flour over the fruit, and put on the top crust; leave an opening in the centre to permit the steam to escape. The pie requires no water, as a sufficient quantity will adhere to the fruit. APPLE BUTTER. 566. Boil one barrel of cicler till reduced to one half the original quantity.

When the cakes are cool place one on a plate, cover the top of it with any kind of thick jelly, put another cake on the top of this, cover it with a layer of jelly, and so on.

They require to be turned over whilst they are boiling in the lard, in order to have them b'^own on both sides. These cakes are very much liked and are very easily made. Sift sugar over before they are sent to the table. TO MAKE BVTTBn. 577. Strain your milk and stand it in a springs house or cellar, which should be about 54^ of Fa- renheit. The spring-house should be well venti- lated. Let the milk stand about three days, then skim off the cream with a skimmer made for the purpose, and take care to get as little of the sour milk with it as possible. Then churn it; and after churning, wash your butter thoroughly in clear fresh water, which should be as cold as you can get it. Then salt it and vrork it well, to get out all the remaining buttermilk. It should be dryTttii NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 288 and solid when you have finished working it this time. After your butter has been salted and worked thorougly, let it stand about five or six hours, or until every particle of salt is entirely dissolved ; then work it again in order to mix the salt more completely through the whole mass, but do not touch it with your hands as it will make it greasy, and spoil both its appearance and taste. Make it into pounds or small prints, and it will be ready for use. When more than one churning is done at a time, each churning should be worked separately, or it will be apt to be streaked ; as, if the temperature of the cream is higher in one churning than in the other, the butter will not mix without appearing clouded. The above receipt was obtained from one of the best butter-makers in Montgomery county, Penn- sylvania, and may be confidently relied on for its accuracy. QUEEN CAKE, 678. One pound of butter. One pound of sugar, Fourteen ounces of flour. Ten eggs. One tea spoonful of cinnamon, One tea spoonful of nutmeg,T^HE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 289 One large table spoonful of brandy, One table spoonful of rose water.

Beat the mixture for several minutes, butter some small round tin pans, fill them about three parts full and bake them. Queen cakes are very nice with a few dried cur- rants in them. To the above quantity one pound and a half of dried currants would be sufficient. THE END. 2§291 INDEX. I A.lmond cake, 191. pudding, 127, water, 253. Apple cream, 163. Apees, 217.

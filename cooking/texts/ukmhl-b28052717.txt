K>« The great and unexpected success that has at- tended the publication of “ Breakfast Dishes ” and “ Savouries and Sweets,” induces me to offer to the public the present collection of receipts for that favourite meal known as “ Five-o’clock Tea.” Now that the marriage hours have been ex- tended to the afternoon, the old heavy “ wedding- breakfast ” will shortly be a thing of the past, and its place usurped by refreshments of a lighter and less expensive character, in view of which I have supplemented my English and Foreign cake receipts, with several for “ Savoury Sandwiches,” “ Cups,” “ Cooling Drinks,” etc., suitable for the purpose, and such as have been of late extensively used at afternoon teas in large establishments where the dinner hour is protracted beyond eight o’clock.CONTENTS.

Fill a kettle three-quarters full of fresh soft water and put it on to the fire to boil. 2. Heat the teapot before putting in the tea; but on no account pour hot water into it, as it should be thoroughly dry when the tea is intro- duced. 3. Put in the tea, a teaspoonful for each person, and one over. 4. Be sure that the water boils before pouring it, over the tea, into the teapot. 5.

Place a thick, pointed calico bag in the per- colator, put the ground coffee into it, and pour very slowly a quart of fast-boiling water. It must on no account be urged to run through quicker than it naturally would, as the brightness and clearness of the coffee depend on this. 4. After the water has all run through the per- colator it should be allowed to simmer a few minutes, but on no account boil. N.B.—The milk served with coffee must be boiling, and the cups filled two-tliirds with it before the coffee is added.3 FIVE-O’CLOCK TEA. No. 3.—COCOA. (Van Houten’s.) Bought in tins, 3J. 9d, a lb.

A little salt sprinkled over the dripping is a great improvement.FIVE-O’CLOCK tea. s No. 5.—BREAD and BUTTER or BREAD and DEVONSHIRE CREAM. Ingredients.

All culinary authorities are agreed on this. Prime beef stock always ready, pure and fresh, Lemco enables dainty little dishes to be readily prepared, which, without it, would be impossible or troublesome. No added flavour to Lemco, it is just pure concentrated beef essence which cannot be told from fresh beef stock in savoury, curry, or ragout. The original and only genuine Liebig Company’s Extract of Meat.PREFACE. —— This Manual is designed to show the culinary })ossil)ilities of a chafing disli, which is looked u])on by many as one of those delightful and practical toys which make cooking a real pleasure. In a like manner it shows the handy use to which earthenware casseroles and marmites can be adopted in cookery. The former is intended chiefly for things that are quickly prepared, whilst the latter, “ casserole cookery,” is more especially adapted for so-called long or slow cooking processes. Cooking by the help of a chafing dish affords great pleasure, and at times amusement, though it has a solid basis of usefulness, for there are some decided advantages to be gained in being able to prepare dainty dishes quickly for either breakfast, luncheon or supper. Many house- wives take a real delight in chafing-dish cookery for ordinary purposes, whilst for sick-room cookery a chafing dish will prove a most valuable - friend, for there are many dishes suitable for invalids which can be prepared with its aid. The number of dishes which can be cooked in a chafing dish or in a casserole is almost endless. The collection of recipes contained in this book have been specially compiled for sucli dishes which are most readily prepared in the chafing dish or in stoneware cooking pans. It is hoped that these meet the long-felt want so often ex- pressed by many of my colleagues and friends, for whose benefit this volume has been pulfiished. C. Herman Senn.There is one best in everything in Corn Flour it is Brown 81 Poison’s “Patent” Remember this when next you buy. Remember also that there is no more delicious dinner sweet than stewed fruit and blancmange made with BROWN & POLSON’S “Patent” CORN FLOUR Brown & Poison’s “PATENT” Is British made by British labour The Cake-making of to-day is easily mastered when you have got into the way of using “Paisley Flour ’ {Trade Mark.) — the sure raising powder—and it is easy getting ii\to the way. Mix one part ‘ Paisley Flour’ with eight parts ordinary flour and proceed as usual. ‘Paisley Flour’ mixes more evenly than baking powders, and is an excellent raiser, therefore the result is an evenly raised light cake; and besides that ‘ Paisley Flour ’ gives an added fineness of texture and flavour. ‘ PAISLEY FLOUR’ is made by BKOWN & POLSON, and sold in Id.. 3id. and 7d. packets, with many interesting recipes.5 CONTENTS AND INDEX PAGE Advantages of a Casserole, Some . . . . . . 43 Almonds, Devilled . . . . . . . . . . 39 ,, Salted . . . . . . . . . . 39 American Creamed Lobster . . . . . . . . 21 ,, Golden Buck . . . . . . . . 32 ,, Rabbit . . . . . . . . . . 31 Anchovy Eggs .. . . . . .. . . 36 Apple Amber .. .. .. ,. . . . . 82 ,, Fritters, French . . . . . . . . 38 Asparagus au Gratin . . . . . . . . . . 68 Baked Custard . . . . . . . . . . 82 ,, Fish, Gratin style . . . . . . . . 45 ,, Curried Tomatoes . . . . . . . . 78 ,, Stuffed Tomatoes . . . . . . . . 77 ,, Oysters au Gratin . . . . . . . . 51 Banana Canapes . . . . . . . . . . 39 „ Trifle 39 Bechamel Sauce . . . . . . . , . . 80 Beef, Curried . . . . . . , . . . . . 60 ,, Fillets a la Minute . . . . . . . . 24 ,, Steak en Casserole . . . . . . . . 56 ,, Stewed, with Macaroni . . . . . . . .

Oh, I mu a festive chafing dish, I fomn, and froth, and bubble, I sing the song of meat and fish, And save a deal of trouble. In Jtitchen realm and dining hall The housewife notv is able, JVheu I respond unto her call, To cooli dinner on the table. CHAFING-DISH cookery is by no means a new invention, for it was practised in olden times for so-called rechauffes of game and poultry in rich and highly-flavoured wine sauces. The use of this convenient cooking apparatus has been revived in America, probably on account of the great dilTiculty experienced there among private families to get qualified cooks. The increasing knowledge of good cookery among all classes in this country as well as in the United States may also be responsible for the increasing popularity of the use of the chafing dish as the most handy and convenient cookery utensil for the preparation of tasty and quickly-cooked dishes. Some few years ago chafing-dish suppers became fashionable in London, and from that time the use of the chafing dish has become more and more popular. It is only right to say that if ever there was an article whose use was abused, whose object was misunderstood, and whose ability, or shall we say possibility, was undervalued.12 it was this very article, commonly known as the chafing dish. Chafing-dish cookery is restricted to certain dishes, and cannot be adapted for all cooking processes, but so long as those dishes are practical one could not wish for a more handy or more convenient cooking apparatus. You may boil, stew, broil, and fry in a chafing dish, provided the right kind of materials are used, but other cooking processes are practically impossible in a chafing dish. Whatever may be said for or against chafing-dish cookery, there is a great deal of fascination for professional as well as amateur cooks. The chafing dish has become quite fashionable among the upper classes, who, for the sake of convenience or enjoyment, like to show their skill in matters culinary. By its means one can make the most tempting and quickly-prepared dishes that are so conveniently adapted to it. Although the chafing dish is mostly used for a late supper, it may also be utilised at luncheon, breakfast, or the time for making any kind of dish which must be served h la minute,” that is, immediately after it is cooked. The mere mention of chafing dish brings up the much-discussed and, I may say, disputed question of late suppers. A chafing dish generally consists of four parts : the framework in which the lamp is set, the lamp, the hot- water pan with side handles which rest on the framework, and the blazer in which the food is cooked. A flagon is a dainty adjunct for filling the lamp without removing it from the table ; but in its absence a jug can be used. The flagon is re- commended because when corked it prevents the alcohol from escaping. Cheap alcohol should not be used in the lamp ; the best quality is less likely to smoke. A polished wooden or bone spoon and a chafing-dish fork are necessary, the former for stirring the food, the FLAGON.latter for serving it out. These articles have long handles with broad bowls. It is best to place the chafing dish on a tray so as to prevent any danger of a flaring flame igniting an unpro- _tected table cloth. The tray, flagon, hot plates, fork, and spoon should be put on the side of the tray. The hot-water pan must be always used where slow cooking is required for creams, sauces, and rarebits. For frying, broiling, remove the hot-water pan and place the pan near to the flame, which is done by raising the lamp on a standard supplied for this purpose. CHAFING DISH FORK AND SPOON. Have the lamp filled with good alcohol, and closely covered until ready to light. Fill the pan one-fourth full of hot water, if handy, otherwise with cold, covering closely until hot. Let the prepared foods be served from the chafing dish on to the hot plates, and never attempt anything in the line of elaborate garnishing. Neither should an elaborate meal be attempted, especially if only one chafing dish is used. It requires at least two chafing dishes, and sometimes three, to carry out a whole meal successfully. Near at hand should be a small table containing the materials for preparing the meal. The flour, salt, pepper, and sugar should be accurately measured. Place small pats of butter or butter-balls on a dish. When whipped cream is used, prepare it beforehand, place it in a deep dish or bowl, and keep in a cool place until wanted. By having the meats seasoned and ready to form into whatever cooked dish is wanted, the cheese grated, eggs wiped clean, and placed near at hand, the work of cooking is simplified.Parsley and cress should be washed, and dried ready for use. For dishes where toast is needed, prepare the bread over the coal or gas fire, as toasting cannot be properly done over the lamp. The toast must, of course, be kept hot until ready for use. The most suitable pre- parations for the chafing dish are light ragouts, eggs, and omelettes, so- called creamed dishes, light stev/ dishes, fish savouries, curries, etc. Needless to say that any of the following recipes can be prepared equally well in an ordinary saucepan on the stove ; but these recipes for selected dishes have been specially compiled, so that they can be conveniently prepared in a chafing dish. A CHAFING DISH AND ITS OUTFIT. The above illustration shows the complete equipment of a chafing dish v/ith its accessories. Besides the chafing dish and the lamp which provides the “ fuel ” and is the all-important adjunct for cooking, the following accessories and utensils are necessary: — Two or three spoons, one wooden and one silver-plated, used for stirring and mixing.15 A fork used for similar purposes. A flagon or tin bottle to hold the fluid fuel, methylated spirit. A skimmer, used for skimming purposes. An egg poacher, most handy to poach eggs in a dainty style. An omelet pan and a blazer, used for frying and broiling purposes. The Blazer. The blazer of a chafing dish is used the same way and for the same purpose as an ordinary saute pan or frying pan, or as the upper part of a double boiler. To decide how to use the blazer, it is necessary to consider how the article would be cooked if an ordinary cooking stove were used, and use the blazer accordingly. For example, a roux can be made by melting it, and then adding a liquid to make it into a sauce. This would be cooking in saute pan or blazer directly over the fire, the same as frying ; but if milk has to be scalded, and flour and butter creamed together, or flour mixed with liquid, which is to be stirred into the hot milk, then the cooking should be done over hot water. After a sauce has been made, and meat or fish is to be re heated or cooked in it, or beaten eggs are to be added to it, the cooking, in such cases, is also best performed over hot water. Cutlets or thin chops, fillets of steak, or a small bird, are broiled over a quick heat, no matter whether the utensil in which they are cooked be a saute or frying pan or a chafing-dish blazer. butter and frying or blending flour in BLAZER.i6 Oysters a la Marguerite Take eighteen large oysters, half a stick of celery (white part only), one and a half'oz. of butter, one glass of white wine, one dessert-spoonful cornflour, twenty-four large picked shrimps, a little stock, lemon juice, seasoning, and chopped parsley. Beard the oysters, cut them in halves, and blanch them in their own liquor ; preserve the latter. Wash and trim the celery, using only the white portions ; chop up rather finely, and drain well on a cloth. Melt an ounce of butter in the chafing dish, add the celery, and fry for about ten minutes. Now add the wine and the oysters, and the liquor, season with salt and pepper, mix the cornflour with a little stock (cold), and incorporate this along with the oysters, etc. Stir till it boils, adding a little more stock to moisten ; flavour with a few drops of lemon juice, and lastly add the shrimps. Put in the remainder of butter, and cook very gently for five minutes. Sprinkle with chopped parsley, and serve from the chafing dish. Scrambled Eggs with Oysters. (CEufs brouilles aux Huitres.) Mix an ounce of fresh butter with a teaspoonful of anchovy paste. Beat up five or six eggs, season with salt, pepper, and a dash of paprika or Krona pepper seasoning. Melt the anchovy butter in the chafing dish, when hot pour in the eggs, stir lightly until the mixture begins to thicken, then add quickly a dozen oysters, previously bearded and cut into halves or dice. Serve from the chafing dish, with fingers of toasted bread, buttered and lightly spread with anchovy paste. Shrivelled Oysters. (Kuitres Etouffes.) Put the liquor of a dozen oysters in the chafing dish over the fire, allow it to boil, and remove the scum from the surface. Add half an ounce of fresh butter, and put in17 a dozen oysters, previously bearded. Season with salt and pepper, a few drops of lemon juice, and a little chopped chives or parsley. Cook for five minutes, and serve plain or on toast. Fricasseed Oysters. This is an excellent dish for invalids or convalescents. Blanch twelve large oysters, drain and beard them. Melt half an ounce of butter in a chafing dish, to this add half an ounce of flour, stir for a few minutes, and moisten with a gill of milk and the strained oyster liquor. Bring to the boil, let it simmer for ten minutes. Cut the oysters in halves. Add them to the sauce, let them get very hot together without boiling, then add the beaten yolk of an egg and a little cream. Season to taste, and serve. Oyster Patties. (Bouchees aux Huitres.) Blanch in their own liquor and beard twelve large oysters, drain them and cut them into quarters, or smaller if liked. Prepare a sauce as directed in the foregoing recipe, and add a yolk of egg and a few drops of lemon juice. Heat up the oysters in this, and fill up a number of puff paste patty or bouchee cases with the prepared mixture. Curried Oysters. (Huitres a I’lndienne.) Prepare a curry sauce as directed for “Curried Eggs,” add a teaspoonful of lemon juice, and drop in one dozen large fat oysters, previously bearded and fried in butter, also half the oyster liquor. Cook them very gently for a few minutes, and serve with plain boiled rice. Oyster Fritters. (Beignets d’Huitres.) Make a light batter with one ounce of flour, one yolk of egg, one dessert-spoonful of olive oil, a pinch of salt, and half a gill of milk. Beat it well, let it stand for an hour, Ri8 then carefully stir in the whisked white of an egg. Beard one dozen large oysters, sprinkle over with a little lemon juice, and season with salt and pepper. Dip each oyster into the batter so as to completely cover them, then drop them one at a time into very hot butter contained in the chafing dish. Fry to a rich brown, take up, drain, and serve hot. Oyster Omelet. (Omelette aux Huitres.) Cook six large oysters in their own liquor without actually boiling. Drain them well, remove the beards, and cut the oysters into small pieces. Beat up the yolks of four eggs, add a pinch of salt and pepper, then add the oysters, and lastly the whites of the eggs whisked to a stiff froth. Melt an ounce of butter in a chafing dish blazer, when hot pour in the egg mixture, and stir with a fork over a bright fire till the eggs commence to set, then shape and fold over, let cook for a minute or two longer, and turn the omelet on to a hot dish. NOTE.—Half the liquor of the oysters can be added to the eggs ; this will make the omelet moister and lighter. Broiled Oysters. (Huitres frites.) Remove the beards from a dozen large oysters, and proceed to treat them the same as directed in the recipe for “ Fried Scallops.” Fry them in hot butter, and serve with quarters of lemon. Oysters on Toast. (Huitres sur Croutes.) Remove the beards from a dozen large oysters, and put them in a dish containing enough milk to cover the oysters. Have ready some toasted and buttered bread, cut into oblong pieces about in. wide—six pieces will be required. Place two oysters on each piece of toast, season with a little cayenne or paprika pepper, and pour over enoughwhite sauce to just cover the oysters. Sprinkle with a few breadcrumbs and a few drops of lemon juice. Fry them in a chafing-dish blazer for ten minutes. Dish up, and garnish with sprigs of fresh parsley, and serve hot. Another and more simple way is to slightly broil the oysters with a little fresh butter, then season and put them on neatly cut slices of hot buttered toast. Dish up, garnish with lemon quarters and parsley, and serve. Oyster Sauce. (Sauce aux Huitres.) From six large sauce oysters remove the beards, and put them with their liquor in a chafing dish, with an ounce of butter. Cover with a lid and cook for four minutes (they must not be allowed actually to boil). Put the oysters on a sieve, cut them in halves or quarters, allow the liquor to reduce to half its original quantity, strain, return to the chafing dish, adding at the same time half a pint of white sauce ; when quite hot add the yolk of one egg, and stir till the thickening is perfect, then add a few drops of lemon juice, also a pinch of salt and pepper if found necessary. Keep the sauce hot, but not boiling, till wanted for table, then pour into a hot sauce-boat. Kedgeree of Fish.

The remains of cold roast beef or mutton can with very little skill and trouble be turned into appetising dishes by the help of the chafing dish. The meat, say about half a pound, should be cut into thin slices, freed from super- fluous fat and gristle, or it may be cut into fine shreds or julienne strips. It is best if first fried or tossed in a little butter in the blazer over a full flame, after which a little good brown sauce or gravy is added, also a teaspoonful of red currant jelly, half a glass of sherry or Madeira wine, and a teaspoonful of Holbrook’s Worcestershire sauce; season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of cayenne or paprika. Allow the meat to simmer gently for about twenty minutes, then serve. Sweetbreads. Calves’ sweetbreads or lambs’ breads, being quickly cooked and tender, adapt themselves well for cooking in a chafing dish. They should be well washed, blanched, and trimmed, then cut into slices and fried in butter in the chafing dish. Slices of fried bacon make a nice accom- paniment with sweetbreads. Another way is to egg and4 24 crumb the slices, and fry them in clarified butter, or to stew the slices in a richly seasoned white sauce. Quails on Toast. (Cailles sur Croutes.) Cut three small fat trussed quails in halves, flatten each, season with salt and pepper, and dredge them with a little flour.

Yorkshire Rarebit. Prepare a Welsh rabbit mixture, spread it on portions of buttered toast cut into squares, upon each piece of toast place a small rasher of fried bacon, with a poached egg laid on top. American Golden Buck. This is made the same as Welsh rabbit (see page 30), with the addition of a small poached egg, neatly trimmed, on top of each portion. Some prefer to use only the yolks of eggs for poaching purposes, as this makes a neater- looking portion. Put a tiny pinch of Nepaul or cayenne pepper in the centre of each egg just before serving. Welsh Rabbit or Rarebit. Cat up eight ounces of good Cheshire or Cheddar cheese, put it into a chafing dish with a of oiilk or ale, |-(easpDonful of mustard, and pepper to taste.

Heat up four ounces of clarified butter in the chafing dish ; when very hot but not burning, drop in the apples, a few at a time, and fry the slices on both sides to a golden colour. Take them up, drain, and dredge with castor sugar mixed with a little ground cinnamon. BLAZER.39 Banana Canapes. Slice three peeled bananas lengthways, and cut each in halves ; fry these in butter in a chafing-dish blazer ; season with salt, pepper, and cayenne, and dress on toasted Triscuits or ordinary toasted bread ; these must be well buttered. NOTE.—In place of Triscuits toasted bread or small rusks can be used. Banana Trifle. Mix an ounce of Brown and Poison’s cornfiour with a little cold milk, boil up half a pint of milk, and pour over the mixed cornflour. Return this to the chafing dish, add one ounce castor sugar, and stir till it boils, then let cook slowly for ten minutes ; stir in two yolks of eggs, a little grated lemon rind, and the juice of half a lemon ; heat up without boiling. Peel and slice three ripe bananas, place the slices in a glass dish, and sprinkle over a little castor sugar, and half glass of brandy. Pour over the prepared custard as it begins to get cold, and let it set; decorate the surface of the dish with ratafias, shreds of almonds, and glace cherries. Salted Almonds. (Amandes Salees.) Blanch and peel half a pound of Jordan almonds, dry them well after peeling. Melt rather more than half- ounce of fresh butter or an equal quantity of sweet olive oil in the chafing dish. When hot, put in the almonds, and fry them to a golden brown. Pour off all the fat (butter or oil), so that the almonds are perfectly dry, then sprinkle over freely with fine table salt, “ Csrebos ” salt for prefer- ence. Continue to stir them in the dish for a few minutes longer, and serve when cold as after-dinner tit-bit. Devilled Almonds. (Amandes a la Diable.) Proceed the same as directed in the foregoing recipe. When the almonds are freed from butter or oil after being40 fried, sprinkle them over with fine salt mixed with cayenne and curry powder, using only a small quantity of each, especially of cayenne. A Simple White Sauce. Melt two table-spoonfuls of butter in the chafing dish ; when hot stir in a heaped-up table-spoonful of Brown and Poison’s cornflour, fry a little without browning the corn- flour, stirring all the v/hile ; then pour in gradually half a pint or a small breakfast-cupful of hot milk, bring to the boil whilst stirring, and cook for ten minutes ; season with salt and pepper, and use as required. Custard Sauce. Mix one level table-spoonful of Brown and Poison’s cornflour with half-pint milk, and boil up whilst stirring in the chafing dish. Cook for about ten minutes, then add a few drops of vanilla essence and two yolks of eggs ; sweeten to taste, and re-heat the sauce without boiling ; strain and serve hot or cold. THE PERFECT DINNER.

This branch of cookery is frequently called casserole cookery, but “cooking in stone or earthenware” would be more correct. Although very ancient, this class of cookery is becoming exceedingly popular at the present time. Kitchen pottery fills an important mission in the present-day cuisine, for cooking performed in an earthen- ware fireproof pot has many advantages over that performed in a metal pot. A kitchen fully equipped with fireproof stoneware casseroles for the various kinds of its capable service may be truly described as having an odour of purity and a fascination with a sense of cleanliness. Earthenware or stoneware pots were unquestionably the first used for cooking purposes, and notwithstanding the introduction of such substitutes as copper, brass, iron, steel, nickel, tin, aluminium, and even silver, t’leir pDpularity increases year by year. The homeliest form, or shall I call it the most wholesome form, of cooking very many articles of food is that done in the earthen jar, pot or baking dish. The cause of this is not far to seek. Besides being unsurpassable for many purposes, earthenware or stoneware casseroles are light and clean to use, they impart no disagreeable flavour to the most delicate of viands, they are handy to use, the actual cooking is effected slowly and evenly, con- sequently little fuel is used in cooking. They are not42 liable to burn food in cooking. They do not tarnish, rust or stain, and do not, therefore, affect the contents cooked in them. Besides being handy and ever ready for use, earthenware fireproof casseroles, baking or braising pans, and dishes, are inexpensive to buy, and if proper care is bestowed they may last as long as metal pans. Food cooked in earthenware or stoneware casseroles is usually served up in the pots or pans in which it is cooked ; this is convenient as well as economical. All that is needed is to place the cooking pot or pan on a dish and send it to the dining-room, thus ensuring it being served hot—which is another point in favour of casserole cookery. This ware is also ornamental, and being used in the very best establishments it has become decidedly fashionable as a means of cooking and serving food. There are various kinds of these fireproof casseroles, etc., in use. Those made in brown earthenware are considered the best, others are white or yellow inside and brown or green outside ; the white china gratin dishes, souffle cases, and ramakins come under the same heading. This style of cooking is known as “ en casserole,” which in reality is the French name for stew-pan, and means that the dish is served in the vessel in which it has been cooked. Fish, meat, poultry, and game can be cooked in this way ; soups, especially those of the pot-au- feu kind, are cooked and served in marmites, which are another type of fireproof cooking-pots. Fruit, which needs to be carefully stev/ed, is excellent if cooked in this ware. For braising and stewing this kind of cookery has really no equal, and there are many other dishes cooked “ en casserole ” which have proved to be so superior in taste and flavour, that one had better abandon them altogether than attempt to serve them without the aid of this useful kind of cooking utensil. Anyone who has adopted the use of these casseroles, marmites, braising or baking dishes, will readily admit that the merits claimed for them are in no way exaggerated, for the cook will find them a most valuable assistant to ensure genuine, wholesome cookery. It is, however, well to remember that anything cooked in an earthenware pan must be heated gradually, and should not be cooked by fierce heat.43 Some Advantages of a Casserole. Less heat is, as a rule, required to cook in a casserole. Food in a casserole may be cooked either on the stove or in the oven. Occasional basting is desirable. When the contents of the pan or pot is cooked gently, it is not only more economical, but tough meat will be more tender, and may thus be used with excellent results. A braise or stew cooked in an earthenware stewpan can be served in the casserole, thereby securing its being “piping hot.” A clean serviette is sometimes folded neatly round it, and the dish, called “ en casserole,” is always appreciated. Any dish which requires slow, gentle cooking (simmer- ing, stewing or braising) can be prepared in this way ; thus, a ragout, braise ; as well as rechauffes such as Miriton, mince, and hash, are decidedly better in flavour when re-cooked in earthenware than in metal stewpans. Petite Marmite. This dish, which forms the standard dinner item of the average French household, is best prepared in an earthen- ware marmite stock-pot, for it is an acknowledged fact that a petite marmite cooked in stoneware is far more palatable, and for this reason this mode of cooking is especially recommended. Petite marmite is so typically French that no other equivalent has as yet been found. It is a kind of soup usually served in little earthenware pots, which just hold enough for one person, but in some places it is sent to table in the actual pot in which it is cooked. Recipe.—The following ingredients will make a dish sufficient for eight to ten persons: 2 lbs. of rump or round of beef, 1 small piece of marrow-bone, half an ox-tail, 3 quarts of water, 2 carrots, 1 turnip, 1 leek, half-stick celery, half small cabbage, 1 bay-leaf, 2 cloves, 12 pepper- corns,^and salt. PETITE MARMITE.44 Mode of preparation.—Wipe the meat, cut the ox-tail into small joints, put these in a stoneware marmite with the water, let come slowly to the boil, and remove the scum as it rises to the surface. Have the vegetables trimmed, cleansed, and pared, cut the carrots and turnips into convenient shapes, add these with the bay- leaf and pepper-corns to the soup, and let the whole simmer gently for about 2| hours. Add salt to taste during the process of cooking. To serve, cut the meat into equal portions, and place it in the small pots together with the vegetables equally divided. Toasted bread cut into small slices and spread with marrow- fat should be served separately with this dish. NOTE.—Some cooks add a fowl to the soup at the begin- ning, and use the fillet (breast portion) as a garnish. This improves the flavour of the soup, but adds, of course, to the cost. Pot-au-Feu Soup. This dish is as common to the French as roast beef is to the English. The pot-au-feu forms the favourite dish in many households in France, rich and poor alike, and its excellence and value as a sustaining food have been famed for several centuries past. This dish is usually prepared in an earthenware pot or “marmite.” Procure a piece of shoulder of beef, weighing about 3 lbs., also 1 lb. of bones, an onion stuck with a clove, 1 leek, 2 carrots, 2 turnips, a small bunch of parsley, and a small cabbage. Break up the bones, tie up the meat with string, and put both into a soup pot or marmite ; fill up with about four quarts of cold water, and add a little salt, then put it on the fire, and heat up slowly. Prepare the vegetables—scrape the carrots and cut in two-inch lengths, peel the turnips and cut in quarters ; wash and trim the cabbage, cut in four, or in two if very small, and tie up each piece with string ; wash and trim the leek and cut in three. Remove all the scum from the stock as it rises and comes to the boil. When all the scum is removed, add the vegetables by degrees, including the bunch of parsley.45 previously washed and tied up. Skim again when the liquor is almost on the boiling point. Now add ten pepper- corns, and six whole spice and a small blade of mace. Remove the pot to the side, put on the lid, and let it simmer—not boil—for about three hours. Cut some pieces of stale bread into thin slices, put them in the oven to dry, and place them in a soup tureen. Remove the fat, care- fully season to taste, and serve the broth. The meat can be served separately on a dish, with the vegetables round it, or, if preferred, the vegetables can be cut into small slices and added to the soup. STONEWARE SOUP-POT, MARMITE. OR Bouillon, or Beef Broth. This is simply broth strained from the pot-au-feu ; it may be made richer by allowing it to simmer longer, but great care must be taken, so that it does not become cloudy. Bouillon is often served with an egg beaten up. This is put in a soup pan, and the boiling bouillon stirred on to it; a little grated nutmeg and chopped parsley is sprinkled on top and then served hot. Baked Fish (Gratin style). (Poisson au Gratin.) Flake rather finely one pound, more or less, offcold fish—cod, haddock, turbot or salmon. See that it is free46 from bones and skin. Have ready a quarter of a pint of nicely seasoned white sauce. Butter one or more, accord- ing to the quantity of fish avail- able, fish- shaped fire- proof china dishes. Mix the fish with the sauce and season with salt and pep- per, then fill the dish or dishes with it, smooth over the surface with a wetted knife, and cover with a thin layer of white sauce. Sprinkle the top with a mixture of Panurette or breadcrumbs and grated cheese, and place a few tiny bits of butter here and there on the surface. Bake in a fairly hot oven from 20 to 25 minutes, so as to get it thoroughly heated and the surface nicely browned. Dish up, and serve hot. Whiting Fillets au Gratin. Remove the fillets from four small whiting and skin them carefully, season with salt and pepper, and fold over each. Range them neatly in a buttered fireproof china gratin dish, sprinkle a few drops of lemon juice over the fish and put a mush- room (champignon) head on each fillet. Heat up one gill of brown sauce with a small glass of sherry or Chablis, sauce over the fish with this. Sprinkle over some fine breadcrumbs, placing a few tiny bits of butter here and there. Bake in a fairly sharp oven for about fifteen minutes, by which time the fish should47 be cooked and the surface of the dish be evenly browned. Place the gratin dish on to a flat dish, covered with a folded napkin, and serve hot. Sole au Gratin. Skin and trim two soles, fillet them if preferred, or place them whole in a buttered gratin dish, and proceed as directed in the foregoing recipe. Terrtne of Whiting. Bone two large whiting and pound the meat in a mortar till fine ; to this add the yolks of three eggs, half a gill of bechamel sauce, and the need- ful seasoning, salt and pepper. Mix well and rub through a fine sieve. Whisk the whites of one and a half eggs, and incorporate with the above. Butter a fireproof terrine or souffle dish, and line the inside thickly with the prepared farce. Put three table-spoon- fuls of chopped lobster meat in the centre, and fill up with more fish farce. Place the dish in a saute-pan three-parts filled with boiling water, cover it with the lid, and cook in the oven for about 35 minutes, and serve. Rolled Fillets of Sole a la Cardinal. Skin and fillet two large or three small soles, flatten each fillet, trim, and season with salt and pepper. Spread one side of each ii.e,, the smooth side) v/ith a light fish forcemeat as above directed ; sprinkle over some chopped truffle and roll each fillet up neatly. Place them, folded side downwards, in a buttered earthen- ware casserole, moisten with a glass of Chablis wine and half a gill of fish stock ; sprinkle over with half a teaspoonful of Krona seasoning, cover with2_the lid or buttered paper.48 and cook in a hot oven for about fifteen minutes. Pour off some of the liquor and put it with a gill of anchovy sauce, highly coloured with lobster spawn, and reduce a little ; strain this over the fillets, place a slice of truffle on each fillet of sole ; re-heat, and send to table in the casserole. Casserole of Fish. Peel 6 to 8 small button onions and fry them in a casserole with an ounce of butter, to a golden brown. To this add a fresh haddock, trimmed, wiped, and cut into short pieces ; dredge with a heaped- up table-spoonful of flour and season with salt and pepper ; stir the whole gently over the fire for a few minutes, and moisten gradually with half a pint of brown or white stock; add a blade of mace and half a bay-leaf. Bring it to the boil whilst stirring, and remove the scum; then cover and cook gently on the side of the stove or in the oven for about half an hour. Remove mace and bay-leaf, skim off any fat from the sauce, and send to table. NOTE.—If liked, the fish can be filleted and rolled up. Soles, plaice or brill may be prepared in this way. Red Mullet en Terrine. (Rougets en Terrine.) Take 6 to 8 small red mullet, oil, vinegar, and chopped parsley for marinade, ^ ounce butter, 2 small chopped shallots, 1 gill Espagnole or other good brown sauce, 10 to 12 preserved mush- rooms, 1 teaspoonful Lemco, 1 dessert-spoonful anchovy essence, 1 small glass claret, half a lemon, seasoning. Wipe and trim the fish, place^them in a deep dish, and cover with oil.49 vinegar, and chopped parsley (to marinade). Let them stand for half an hour or less. Melt the butter in a large fireproof earthenware *‘terrine” dish, and fry in it the shallot to a pale brown, drain the mullets and place them in the dish. Cook for a few minutes in the oven, then add the sauce, previously blended with the claret, anchovy essence, and Lemco. Season to taste with salt and pepper, place the mushrooms cut in slices on top, cover the dish, and put it in the oven to cook from 29 minutes to half an hour. Just before serving skim and add a few drops of lemon juice, and some chopped parsley. The dish is then ready for table. Matelote of Eel. (Anguille en Matelote.) Skin and bone a large eel, cut it into 2-inch pieces, dip each piece in seasoned flour, and fry a little in two ounces of butter previously heated in a fireproof casserole. Add 8 to 10 small peeled button onions, and fry them also. Now moisten with a smalt glass of claret and half a pint of good stock ; bring to the boil whilst stirring, skim well, and add two rashers of bacon, cut into inch pieces. Cover, and let simmer for about 30 minutes, or till the eel is tender ; skim off any fat that may float on top, and serve in the pan in which the fish is cooked. Curried Shrimps. Skin or pick about a pint of shrimps ; fry in a small casse- role two small peeled and chopped shallots in an ounce of butter, stir in half an ounce of flour, and one dessert-spoon- ful of Madras or Laxami curry powder. Blend both well and add gradually half a pint of milk and stock, and let it boil whilst stirring for ten minutes. Next add the picked p50 shrimps and a dessert-spoonful of lemon juice. Cook gently for another ten minutes ; serve hot, with well boiled rice. Scalloped Salmon. (Coquilles de Saumon.) Not only salmon, but any other kind of boiled cold fish is very nice scalloped. Remove the skin and bone from the fish and flake it. Have ready the required number of scallop shells, butter them well, put in a layer of white sauce (bechamel or melted butter), upon this put the flaked fish, and add alternate layers till each shell is filled. Season each layer with salt and pepper ; smooth over the surface with sauce ; sprinkle with fresh breadcrumbs or Panurette mixed with grated cheese, and put a few tiny bits of butter here and there on top of each shell. Bake in a fairly sharp oven for about twenty minutes ; dish up and serve. Oysters (Seaman’s style). (Huitres a la Mariniere.) Take 18 sauce oysters, | glass Chablis wine, 1 table- spoonful chopped parsley, 1 table-spoonful chopped shallots, } oz. fresh breadcrumbs, 1 oz. butter, } lemon, salt and pepper. Beard the oysters, and put them with their liquor in a pie-dish, pour over the white wine, and let stand for about an hour. Mix the parsley, chop- ped shallots, and breadcrumbs, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Range the oysters in a buttered fireproof baking dish, pour over a little of the liquor and wine, and cover with the mixture of breadcrumbs, etc. ; divide the remainder of the butter into little bits, and place them on top. Bake in a fairly hot oven for about fifteen minutes ; squeeze a little lemon juice on top, and send to table in the baking dish.51 Baked Oysters (Gratin style). (Huitres au Gratin.) Procure the required number of large oysters, open them, blanch them in their own liquor, then drain and remove the beards. Butter as many oyster-shell shapes as there are oysters, put an oyster in each, also a teaspoonful of cream, season with salt, pepper, and a tiny pinch of cayenne ; sprinkle over a little chopped parsley, and a few drops of lemon juice; spread over a little white sauce, and besprinkle this with breadcrumbs and oiled butter. Bake for five minutes, dish up, and serve. \ * Fricasseed Scallops. Cook H dozen large scallops in"^a casserole with just sufficient slightly salted water to cover, add the juice of ^ lemon, a small sliced onion, and a smalljblade of mace; cover the casserole, and allow to simmer for ^ hour, then take out the mace and onion. Mix oz. butter with a table-spoonful of flour, stir in | gill of cream and ^ gill of stock or milk ; add this to the scallops, and cook them for another 15 or 20 minutes ; season with salt and pepper, and serve hot. Roast'Ham en Casserole. (Jambon en Casserole.) Skin a small ham or gammon of bacon, cut off the knuckle part, and rub in a mixture composed of moist or brown sugar, half teaspoonful ground mace, one teaspoon- ful ground ginger, and half teaspoonful of Paprika pepper.52 Place the ham in an earthenware double pipkin or roasting pan, lined with fat bacon or ham rind, and a few prunes. Pour over sufficient lard or butter to baste, put on the lid, and bake in a slow oven from two to tv/o and half hours, according to size ; baste it frequently and freely. When done take up the ham, remove the fat and the ham rind from the pan, return the ham to the pan and add half a pint of rich gravy or brown sauce and a glass of sherry or Madeira. Continue to cook over the fire for another ten minutes ; it is then ready for serving. Neck of Mutton en Casserole. (Carre de Mouton en Casserole.) Bone a neck of mutton weighing from 3 to 4 lbs., remove the superfluous fat, stuff the boned side with a mixture of breadcrumbs, beaten egg, chopped ham or tongue, and chopped parsley. Tie up the meat into neat shape, and place it in a deep earthenware fireproof pan, which must be previously lined with slices of fat bacon, sliced carrot, turnip, and a small onion ; put the pan on the fire and fry its con- tents'^'over a brisk fire till the meat has acquired a light brown colour. Then moisten with a pint of good and well seasoned stock (the bones from the neck should be utilised for this). Place the cover on the pan, and put it in a fairly hot oven for about one or one and a quarter hours. Baste the meat occasionally with its liquor during the process of cooking ; and lastly, remove the fat which has accumulated on top of the liquor. About ten minutes before serving, take up the meat and place it on a dish and keep hot; add half a pint of brown sauce to the liquor remaining in the pan, boil it up, strain off the vegetables, skim the sauce well, and season to taste ; now return the meat into the pan, cook for another ten minutes, and send to table in the pan in which it was cooked.53 Haricot Mutton en Casserole. Procure 2 lbs. of neck or scrag of mutton, 2 oz. of butter or dripping, 1 oz. of flour, a bouquet of savoury herbs, 2 carrots, 2 small onions, 1 turnip, 6 small potatoes, and 1 gill of haricot beans. Trim off some of the fat from the meat, and cut it into cutlets or neat pieces about two inches square. Melt the butter or dripping in a casse- role, fry the meat to a nice colour, sprinkle over the flour, and season with salt and pepper. Stir for some minutes over the fire, then moisten with a pint of stock or water, add the onion stuck with a clove and the bouquet of savoury herbs ; allow the meat to simmer gently for a few minutes ; take off the scum and fat. Have the potatoes, carrots, onions peeled, and turnip pared, and cut in halves or quarters; fry them in fat and a little sugar to give colour ; add these to the stew with the haricot beans. Let the whole cook gently for about an hour or longer ; take out the herbs, and serve hot. Irish Stew en Casserole. Procure 2 lbs. of neck or loin of mutton, lbs. of potatoes, and 2 onions. Trim the meat, pare off some of the fat; if scrag end is used, cut it into square pieces ; if best neck or loin is used cut the meat into cutlets or chops. Wash and peel the potatoes, cut them into thick slices ; peel the onions, and slice them. Put the potatoes and onions and meat in alternate layers into a casserole ; season with salt and pepper ; add about 1} pints of water, and let all simmer gently for about two hours. Keep the lid of the casserole closely shut, and shake the pan occasionally to prevent contents-from burning; when done, sprinkle over somo chopped parsley, and serve.54 Spiced Shoulder of Mutton. (Epaule de Mouton epicee.) Bone a small shoulder of mutton, lay out the meat flat on a board, skin downwards, and rub in a mixture of salt, coarse brown sugar, pepper, ground mace, ground ginger, and ground cloves ; use only very little of the latter three ingredients. Roll up the meat, and keep in the larder till next day. Repeat this operation for three or four days, then roll up the meat and tie it with string. Place it in a casserole with enough seasoned stock to cover, and let it simmer slowly for about 21- hours, more or less, according to size. Remove the string, and serve hot or cold ; if served cold it should be brushed over with meat glaze after the meat is cold. Braised Loin of Mutton a la Soubise. (Longe de Mouton braise a la Soubise.) Bone a moderate sized loin of mutton, and remove most of the fat, leaving only a thin layer on top. Place the trimmed fillet in a braising pan on a mirepoix, /.e., a bed of sliced carrot, onion, bacon, and a small bunch of herbs ; put it in a hot oven, and par-roast for about twenty minutes. Then pour off the fat, »dd one pint of thin brown sauce and season with salt and pepper, and return to the oven for about an hour ; baste the meat frequently during the process of cooking. Prepare a soubise puree, as directed below ; take up the cooked loin of mutton, cut it into slices (fillets), and dress them neatly in a casserole. Re-heat the brown sauce, strain it, remove the fat or skim carefully, and pour over the slices of meat.55 Put the soubise or onion puree in the centre of the dish, or on each side of the fillets, whatever style of dressing is adopted ; sprinkle a little liquified meat glaze over the onion puree, and serve. Soubise Puree This is a well-reduced white onion sauce or puree. Peel and slice thinly two Spanish onions, blanch them for a few minutes in salted water ; drain off the water, and chop the onions as finely as possible. Put the minced onion in a small stew-pan with a gill of white stock and milk (equal proportions), and let them cook slowly for half an hour, then add about a gill of white sauce (prefer- ably bechamel) ; season to taste with salt and white pepper, and rub the puree through a fine sieve ; return it to the stew-pan, add about half a gill of cream, and re-heat ; it is then ready for use. A pinch of castor sugar added to this puree is often found an improvement. Hashed Meat. Procure 1 lb. of cold meat (beef or mutton), 1 oz. of butter, 1 oz. of flour, \ pint of gravy or stock, 1 good-sized tomato, and 1 small onion. Cut the meat into thin slices, peel, slice, and chop the onion, and fry in the butter in a casserole. Next add the flour, fry a little and moisten with stock or gravy, add the tomato, peeled and cut up small ; season to taste, and simmer fifteen minutes ; strain, return it to the casserole, and add the sliced meat ; simmer gently for fifteen minutes. Dish Kp, and send to the table hot. Minced Beef with Poached Eggs. Procure ^ lb. of underdone beef, } pint of gravy, 1 oz. of butter, } oz. of flour, 1 teaspoonful of vinegar, 4 eggs. Cut up the meat into small dice, and sprinkle over the flour. Heat up the butter in a casserole, and fry the meat in' it for about five minutes, also the onion minced ; add the gravy, and cook gently for ten minutes ; add the vinegar. Poach carefully the eggs, and place on the top of the mince ; season to taste ; then serve.Mutton Cutlets en Casserole. Procure the best end of a neck of mutton, 2 oz. butter, 10 small button onions, a pint of brown sauce, 6 to 8 thin slices of raw ham or bacon, 12 large Brus- sels sprouts, salt and pepper. Cut the meat into neat cutlets, and trim off the fat. Melt the butter in the casserole, and fry the cutlets and the peeled onions a light brown. Cut the slices of ham or bacon about two inches square ; wash and trim the sprouts, and roll each up in a square of ham or bacon ; pour off the butter in the casserole, put the meat, ham, sprouts, and onions in the casserole ; add the brown sauce ; cover the casserole, and cook the contents slowly in the oven for about an hour. Skim off all fat before serving, and send to table in the casserole. Mutton Chops en Casserole. Take a loin of mutton, and cut it into neatly trimmed chops ; then proceed to cook them in the same manner as directed in the foregoing recipe. Pork chops or pork cutlets are treated in the same way. By way of a change small ripe tomatoes may be used in place of sprouts. Beefsteak en Casserole. Cut a large piece of rump steak into small fillets, and season them with salt and pepper ; fry them slightly on each side in a little butter over a quick fire, and set them aside. Peel and chop finely a small onion, fry it in a small stew-pan, with half an ounce of butter, to a golden colour ; moisten with a glass of Marsala or57 Madeira wine and two large table-spoonfuls of brown sauce. Boil up and add a table-spoonful of piccalilli or mixed pickles cut up small, two ounces of fried bacon cut into dice ; eight to ten small champignons, one small carrot cooked and cut into cubes, two potatoes cooked and cut into dice ; heat all up in a fireproof earthenware casserole ; place the meat on top, sprinkle over a little dissolved meat glaze, cover and cook in the oven for another ten minutes ; serve hot in the casserole. Smothered Beef with Tomatoes. (Bceuf poele aux Tomates.) Cut about n or 2 lbs. of rump or buttock steak into small slices or thick strips, season to taste with salt and pepper. Melt one ounce of butter in a casserole or pip- kin, add a sliced onion and fry a little ; then put in the beef, sprinkle over a heaped- up table-spoonful of flour, and stir over the fire till all is nicely browned. Next add a pint of stock or water, and a table-spoonful of Holbrook’s Worcester sauce ; stir till it boils, remove the scum, and put in four peeled and sliced tomatoes; sprinkle over also a handful of shredded celery, then cover closely, and let it cook slowly over a charcoal fire or in the oven for about an hour. Scotch Collops. Mince or chop not too finely one pound of lean mutton or beef; heat up one ounce of butter in a fireproof casserole, add to it the half of a small finely chopped onion, fry to a light brown, add half ounce of flour, mix well together, moisten with one gill of good stock, and boil for ten minutes; add the meat, and cook slowly for half an hour. Season with salt and58 pepper, add also a little finely chopped parsley, and place on top, just before serving, a few nicely fried bread croutons. Serve hot. Sea Pie. Chop finely 2 oz. of beef suet and mix with it 4 oz. of flour and a pinch of salt, add enough cold water and work into a fairly firm dough or paste. Cut into slices three-quarters of a pound of gravy beef, put it on a plate, season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle over with vinegar. Melt an ounce of butter or dripping in a brown stewing pan or baking dish, fry in it an onion, peeled and chopped. When of a nice light brown stir in half-ounce of flour, and let it fry till brown. Pour in gently three-quarters of a pint of stock or water, and bring to the boil whilst stirring. Now add the seasoned meat and a dessert- spoonful of chopped parsley. Skim the stew as it simmers. Roll out the suet paste to a round shape a little smaller than the lid of the stewing-pan ; place this carefully on top of the stew, cover the pan with the lid, and let the whole simmer on top of the stove or in the oven for about i-y hours. Braised Calf’s Liver. (Foie de Veau braise.) Take a small calf’s liver, soak it in cold water for about twenty minutes, and then drain and wipe it with a cloth. Insert small thin strips of larding bacon on the surface of the liver. Prepare a mirepoix of vegetables — viz., onion, carrot, bacon, bay-leaf, and herbs. Put these in an earthenware casserole, containing about l;l ounces of butter. Fry the vegetables a golden colour ; put in the59 liver and let it brown gently, pour off the fat, add about half a pint of rich brown sauce and a gill of good stock. Season with pepper and salt, and let simmer gently for about an hour. Then add a glass of sherry or port wine, the juice of half a lemon, and a small quantity of finely- chopped parsley.

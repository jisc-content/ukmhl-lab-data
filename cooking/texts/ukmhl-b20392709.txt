In the hope of helping^ those housewives whose difficult duty it is to provide good " daily fare " out of small weekly housekeeping allowances, this little work is put before the public. Providing for the daily needs, an easy matter where the re- sources are ample, is an extremely difficult task when there is only just sufficient to buy food for the household. The necessity of providing for those who work with their brain rather than with their hands, makes housekeeping on a limited scale more difficult for the lower middle class than for the wives of artisans. A man tired bodily with work that has rendered him hungry, can be more easily satisfied with simple plain food than another who has gone through some mental strain ; and for the wives of the latter we think and beHeve these menus will be useful. Another section, namely the very small household of perhaps but two persons, are often puzzled how to provide some variety in everyday meals, without the waste so often occurring when only a small quantity of food is needed. For these we have compiled as many menus as space would allow. In all we give thirty-two menus for town and country, for the four seasons of the year, each to be provided at an expenditure ranging from 4s. to 7s. per head ; and we offer these to perplexed housewives in the sincere hope that the information we give may lighten their labours in providing their " Daily Fare."BILL OF FARE FOR ONE WEEK IN TOWN. {Spring Season^ For Family consisting of 4 Children and 2 Adults (2 Young Children to be reckoned as one Adult).

In these we have endeavoured to account for and show the reason why prices slightly vary in the different bills of fare.GENERAL NOTES ON MENUS. The preceding menus have been compiled with a view of helping those housekeepers who, with but limited incomes, find it difficult to provide the " daily fare." With a liberal allowance at our disposal, it is not at all a difficult thing to arrange a varied and good weekly menu, but when only just enough is to be had for spending upon food, it is no easy matter to make out the bill of fare. One has to think of so many " musts" before one may indulge in the " maybe's," and out of a small weekly sum, when the cost of such necessaries as bread, butter, milk, &c., are reckoned, there seems so very little left for meat, tea, and the like. In the first two menus for each season it will be seen that we only allow £\ per week for five persons, reckoning two young children as one adult, which is just at the rate of 4s. per head, not quite 7d. per day. These have been most difficult bills of fare to plan out, but for that reason they have been of all the most care- fully tested. Many people may cavil at quantities allowed, deeming them inadequate to the number in family, but we must cut our coat according to our cloth," and it is a fact that there are a very large number of housekeepers, neither labourers' nor artisans' wives, who have no more than £\ per week for their allowance for food, and without exceeding it, they must do their best week after week to provide for the wants of their families. It must be seen that the cheaper foods only can occur in a menu of this kind ; and by cheaper we do not mean inferior meat or other comestibles, but those which give the maximum of nourishment with the minimum of cost. Not only must the food be cheap, but its preparation must be that which entails the least loss. Say, for example, we have at our disposal a couple of pounds of best end of the neck or loin of mutton, and we boil that and serve with caper sauce, &c.—what do we get ? At most a dinner for four or five, with, in nine cases out of ten, a good deal of fat wasted. On the other hand, do we remove superfluous fat, to be tried74 GENERAL NOTES ON MENUS. down for pastry or chopped as suet for puddings, and make the rest, neatly cut up small, into a good Irish stew with plenty of potatoes and onions, there will be enough for about eight persons. Again, do we have a couple of pounds of steak to deal with, and put that in a pan and fry it, we shall find it about half the value of the same quantity stewed with vegetables, with the gravy thickened and plenty of it. It depends almost as much upon the mode of cooking as the choice of meat, whether the various parts prove economical or the reverse. It will be noticed in the £i a week menus, that there is but little allowed for what is called, as a rule, a relish for breakfast ; but this is unavoidable. With few exceptions, there is something allow^ed in the way of bacon, eggs, &c., for the working member of the family, presumably the father, but on such limited means it would be absolutely impossible to provide for all in the same manner. In many cases, too, there will be found some scraps that can be utilised, that we cannot reckon upon in our written bill of fare, so that it is scarcely likely that any breakfast table in the menus would be reduced to quite plain bread and butter. If that were the case, it should be rather on a Sunday than any other day, as there is then generally a hot mid-day dinner. Children do not need meat at breakfast, and are quite as well if it does not occur for their dinner once or twice a week ; but adults find it hard to breakfast without something like fish or bacon, particularly if they are going out to work or business. Butter is a very expensive item in housekeeping if it is used at the morning and evening meals, so we note several substitutes equally suitable to the taste of children. Porridge is an excellent food, and a pennyworth is enough for breakfast, and hominy, white oats, farola, &c., young folks enjoy, all these costing less than tea or coffee and bread and butter. When we make but a very small allowance for butter in the list of expenses at the end of the week, it will be seen that porridge, treacle, jam, &c., have been put down to form the breakfasts. In our reckoning of tea and supper as one meal, we think there will be found almost invariably some little dish that would serve for supper, were that to follow an ordinary plain tea and so make two separate meals ; but it would be tedious to repeat day afterGENERAL NOTES ON MENUS. 75 day tea and bread and butter, cake or jam, therefore we have blended the two meals as they are so often in actual fact, as saving of both time and space. We make no mention of any beer or wine in our menus, for the principal reason that where there was but little to spend upon necessaries, there would be none for luxuries such as stimulants. We do not purpose to discuss the question as to whether one is better with or without them, but we may say that for children they are more injurious than beneficial; also that where the expenditure must be so very limited, any extra shilling or two might well be added to the allowance for food. It will be noted in our menus, or rather recipes, that dishes involving, as a rule, very little time or trouble are chosen, for we surmise that in households conducted on principles of the strictest economy there would be no time to spare for very elaborate cookery. Where there was no servant (and but few would keep one if so little could be spared for five persons at or los. a week) the mistress would have all the cooking to do in addition to her other many duties, and would have but little time to spare if the cookery were not of a simple, quickly done kind. Were some of the menus we have now and again submitted to our opinion carried out by one pair of hands, these hands would have scant time for needlework, and their owner very little rest or recreation. Perpetual cooking is not necessary, but the week's menu well planned out, it is very easy to get through a good deal of kitchen work in one day and save firing on others. Say, for example, bread is made at home, a good fire will be needed in the range or stove, and this should serve to cook cakes and pastry for half the week. When cooking is started, say with the household bread, it is easier to go on for a morning at it and feel comparatively free for a day or so than to have to attend to it a little every day. As much as possible shculd be done on Saturdays, for Sunday should not be a hard-working day, and Monday, even without its wash, is generally a busy time, and any- thing we can do to reduce its work may well be got through before the rest of Sunday. We have spoken of the menus of ;£i a week as very difficult to arrange, and we may say here that they are not more troublesome than those for two persons at 6s. per head.76 GENERAL NOTES ON MENUS, Only those who have had to plan them out know how far from easy it is to arrange a bill of fare for two, when only a small sum is at our disposal. The perpetual chop or steak soon palls upon one, and the lack of variety in our diet, particularly dinner, in such cases is truly a misfortune. We have tried, in the four menus carried out on this small scale, to show that the said chops and steaks are not inevitable, and that we can live fairly well even on I2S. per week for two. We have in no menu allowed for extra persons as guests, thinking that were any hospitality given, it would also be shown ; therefore a dinner to one or two friends, or a tea to some children, would mean the same returned to us, so that there would be no extra expense. All the menus are planned out for people of ordinary appetites, and we beheve enough and to spare is allowed for them. Bread is allowed in the same quantities to all, and though in many cases, particularly in the country, it would be made at home and cost less, there would most likely be some little items in the expenditure that would be heavier than we have stated, although we have endeavoured throughout the work to hit upon average prices in town and country. In our experience the sum total of our expenditure in food per week is much the same whether we live in London or in a quiet country village ; for though in the latter we may grow our own vegetables with little or no expense, and make our own bread at a cost much below what we should have to pay for it at a baker's, meat is almost always dearer than in town, and fish invariably so. We have often tried the experiment of having chickens and other country produce sent to us in town, but did not find it cheaper than we can buy at our first-rate London markets. We speak of marketing a little later on, of prices and how to shop ; here we need only say that we have, as far as possible, made the cost accurate. The difference notable in the cost of meat in some of the,menus is caused by the fact that those who have but a sovereign a week to spend on food must find out where they can get that, as well as other things, cheaply, and cannot afford to give orders at the door to a butcher. It is a known fact that if we go ourselves to a butcher, or other vendor of fresh provisions, we may generally77 GENERAL NOTES ON MENUS. find some perishable things going at a cheaper rate than usual, because there happens to be a run on others. In our recipes we have not confined ourselves exclusively to dishes mentioned in the menus, as we thought it well to give our readers more than we could include in the daily fare. ON MEALS IN GENERAL. About *' What to eat, when to eat, and where to eat," much has been written. We have here to deal with only the " what" and " when," as our menus are all for home use. The former query is, we take it, what viands we should choose for the various meals ; the latter, a much more disputed question, namely, when those meals should occur, and of how many they should consist per diem. " What" shall we provide for breakfast, for example for that is a meal that must occur, yet one not fairly treated. There are some people who can always eat the same breakfast, or perhaps hai'e to eat it, not having a choice in the matter. We heard but lately of a young housekeeper whose allowance for housekeeping expenses was a very limited one, who always provides bacon for breakfast, and with it at its present high price we wonder what must be sacrificed at other meals to provide this unvaried luxury. It seems strange that any one can partake of the same thing day after day, not to say foolish not to contrive some of the little dishes that have an almost nominal cost, being made from odds and ends, to make a change, and an economical one. We would advise all young housekeepers to try and make this meal a pleasant and varied one, it being, particularly for a man going to business daily, a most important one. We give recipes for a great many breakfast and supper dishes that can be made with very little expense and trouble, and trust our readers may try them for themselves. Besides the savoury, let there if possible be something in the way of fruit, vegetable, or sweets. Fresh fruit of any kind in summer is delicious at breakfast, and more wholesome then than at any other time. In winter some baked apples, stewed prunes, or figs might take the place of fresh fruit; then a lettuce or some watercress is good for breakfast, and a few hot cakes will be sure to find favour. Give a little time to the arrangement and preparation of breakfast, make78 GENERAL NOTES ON MENUS, the table look nice and have everything to hand—for with business men there is seldom time for waiting at this meal—and do not let it be the hurried, slovenly one it so often is. We come to the consideration of dinner next, for this book does not appeal to that class who take that meal late and therefore require luncheon. And here we may well appeal to our menus to show our readers how on a very small food allowance we manage to make the diet varied. The proverbial cold mutton does not appear day after day till one would be glad to make a change with bread and cheese. It is impossible with small means to have many courses, and sometimes only one need be given, but it is possible to introduce a little fish or soup in place of meat. Tea is a meal about which opinions differ considerably. With children it is more or less bread and butter all the year round, while with adults it may mean literally only a cup of tea with a supper in perspective, but when this supper is only a snack of bread and cheese, a good old-fashioned tea is a very pleasant meal, with a nicely-laid table, cut bread and butter, toast, cake, jam, &c. Supper to the worker in the house is often the pleasantest meal in the day, and only delaying it too long makes it an unwholesome one. Here again we want a little variety, not perpetual cold meat and bread and cheese. In winter, when fires must be kept going during the evening, something hot, such as soup, a mince, or a macaroni cheese, all dishes that cost little, and that can be prepared before- hand, come in well; while in hot weather a nicely-made fish salad or raised pie, neither of which are extravagant, will be found, as a rule, acceptable. Now for the times for meals—and we need but briefly touch upon this subject, as in every household they must be arranged to suit the convenience of the majority or the master of the house. One word of advice we may give with regard to breakfast, and that is, let the hour fixed for it be early enough to enable those to whom it is served to partake of it without the hurry-skurry that is apt to be associated with that meal. Dinner comes in best, as a rule, for children and workers quite in the middle of the day, say one o'clock, for after a tolerably early breakfast people are ready for it by that time.GENERAL NOTES ON MENUS. 79 If tea and supper are blended in what is generally denominated a high tea, to which the father of the family can return, from 6 to 6.30 gives a fair interval between meals. ON MARKETING. French housewives set us a good example in many ways, parti- cularly in that they do their own marketing. We most strongly advocate the principle of going oneself to the shops and buying and paying for things on the spot, and we venture to assert, how- ever honest the tradesfolk may be, that a mistress who as often as need be goes to the various shops and chooses her own goods will save some pounds during the year by not depending solely upon the orders she may give at her door. Specially is this the case with regard to butcher's meat. You may order a small joint, and a large one be sent which is more than you need and more than you can afford, and time will not allow for its being changed ; or, again, the butcher has not the part you order, and sends you something most unsuitable instead. On the other hand, going to the shop yourself, you can pick out exactly what you require, and if you are a regular customer, can have it trimmed of superfluous fat and cut exactly to your order. Fish one should always choose, because it is one of the things that is more to be avoided when not quite fresh than any other; also the prices of it so vary day by day, that unless you see it for yourself it may be found too costly for your purse. To poultry also the latter argument applies. Vegetables and fruit should also be seen before being bought, as they vary in price and very much in quality if not fresh. The two exceptions, as far as tradesfolk are concerned, might be the baker and the milkman, though by buying the former your- self you get full weight ; but we strongly advise our readers to bake their own bread, and they will find a very great saving of money, while the dough comes in so usefully for plain cakes, yeast dumplings, or currant loaves, besides the ordinary bread. Those who can store well should make themselves acquainted with the cheapest markets, and the proper times when stores of those articles that can be preserved, and which are dear at other seasons, should be bought.GENERAL NOTES ON MENUS, 8o Jams and pickles are nicer made at home, but good they can now be bought so cheaply that unless one grows one's own fruit and vegetables, and can be sure that they are picked dry, they are scarcely worth making. If supplies can only be bought by the week, it is well to get all the unperishable things at one marketing; but with a very limited purse it is absolutely necessary to make a sort of list or plan of what will carry us through the week, as far as fresh provisions are concerned, as there will be a risk that the money will not hold out. Fortunately for the housekeeper of the present day, provisions are far cheaper than they were a generation or so ago. Necessary groceries, such as tea and sugar, are not more than half the price they were, while tinned articles form in themselves a cheap living. Perhaps, however, in meat we realise the great difference in price most, it having been such a costly item in our daily food; and we cannot be too thankful that the foreign meat has not only put good animal food within the reach of all, but has lowered the price of the home-grown. With a few observations upon the choosing of provisions, we may close our short notes on " Marketing.^' To choose Fish, See thatat is stiff; the longer it has been kept, the more flabby it becomes. Thoroughly fresh fish will be covered with scales, the eyes will be bright, and the gills red. Do not buy fish out of season ; it is then never good, and may be very unwholesome. To choose Meat. See that it is not sticky, that blood does not run from it freely, and that the lean be a bright red, and the fat smooth and not skinny. Good meat is firm and elastic to the touch, and on looking at the lean closely, it can be seen that it has a marbled appearance from the small veins of fat among the muscles. To choose Poiiliry. See that the beak and claws of a fowl are soft, not stiff and horny ; the bones of all young birds are soft and easily broken.RECIPES FOR SOUPS. 1.

LENTIL SOUP. Note.—Recipes for this soup may be found in almost every cookery book, but as there are so many different modes of making it we give two here that have been tried and found good, cheap, and not troublesome to make. LENTIL SOUP (BROWN) WITHOUT STOCK. \ lb. lentils^ i oz. dripping, 2 quarts water, 3 onions, i carrot, 4 cloves, a bunch of herbs ^ seasonifig of pepper and salt. Time, 3 hours. Usual cost, 3d. Wash the lentils and soak them for a day and night in 2 quarts water. ^ In reckoning the cost of the broth the price of the head is charged, but it niust be remembered that only the hquor from it is used, therefore the cost of the broth is a mere nothing.83 RECIPES FOR SOUPS. Fry the onions and carrots pared and sliced in the dripping, and put them with the lentils and the water into a saucepan and sim- mer for 3 hours. When the soup commences to simmer put the herbs and cloves in, tying them in a piece of muslin, and the sea- soning. Next pass the soup through a wire sieve, and return it to the fire to get hot before serving. 7. LENTIL SOUP MADE WITH LIQUOR IN WHICH PORK HAS BEEN BOILED. The liquor in which a pig's head or some other part of pork has been boiled^ \ lb. German lentils^ 2 onions.^ some vegetable mar- row or cold potatoes^ seasonijtg. Time, 4 hours. Usual cost, 2d. to 3d. Soak the lentils in cold water over-night. Put the stock, skimmed free of fat, in a saucepan, add to it the lentils, the onions sliced, and enough marrow or potato cut in small pieces to thicken the soup ; boil 4 hours, adding seasoning to taste. 8. MUTTON SOUP. Knuckle of mutton^ lb. pearl barley^ 2 onions^ i turnips i carrot., pepper., salt, water., a little chopped parsley, Time, 4 hours.

Put all the ingredients into a pan with 3 pints of cold water, the vegetables prepared in the usual way, and the knuckle bone cracked, and let all simmer for 4 hours. Take out the knuckle, which should be served with a little of the broth and some chopped parsley, or onion sauce, and put in the minced parsley and more seasoning if required. A little browning (Sutton's), just a very few drops, improves the appearance of this soup. 9. OX HEAD SOUP. Half an ox head6 onions., 2 carrots^ i turnip., a few cloves., water enough to cover the head, thickening of cornflour, pepper, salt. Time, ij hours. Usual cost, is. 6d. Wash the head well in salt and water, boil it for 10 minutes, and drain the water away.RECIPES FOR SOUPS. 84 Fry the onions in a little dripping, and put them in a saucepan with the carrots, turnip, and cloves, and cover with water.

Stir in the mint just before serving, and send fried croutons to table with this soup. 12. PLAIN SOUP. With various vegetable and other flavourings all kinds of good family soups can be made from stock from bones, either those from joints cooked in the house, or uncooked bones from the butcher's, which can be bought for -Jd. lb. The bones from a leg of mutton should yield enough stock for ^ome quarts of soup, and 2d. worth from the butcher's will make excellent jellied stock it used as follows :—RECIPES FOR SOUPS, 85 Crack the bones well and put on to stew with sufficient water for 12 hours, then set aside to cool. When cold remove the fat, which makes excellent pastry, and put on the bones again with any that may have come to hand since, or with the vegetables or flavouring.

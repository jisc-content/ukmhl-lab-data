In these days of reciprocal feelings of benevolence; when distance is abolished, and civilised nations adopt, as it were almost imperceptibly, the same habits and tastes; a cookery-book, simple and precise, comprising a select and varied choice of popular and national dishes, borrowed from all countries, may perhaps possess the merit of interesting, in an equal degree, both gastronomes and men of the profession. If the universal language be a dream, albeit glorious, not yet attain- able ; the same cannot be said of a universal system of cookery : nations, frpm progress to progress, are incessantly advancing towards perfection! It is therefore unquestionable, that from their intimate relations a complete assimilation may at last arise, and as a natural consequence, a unanimous adherence to the fundamental formulas of cookery. However this may be, these new conditions demand henceforward from practitioners an encrease both of aptitude and application : whoever is, or would be, worthy of the profession that he practises, will exert himself to the utmost to enlarge the sphere of his action. Formerly indeed, a laborious cook, even with a limited repertoire, might attain a certain reputation ; now-a-days, it is not sufficient for him to be a good practitioner ; he must possess the genius, or to speak more modestly, the instinct, of inexhaustible resources, as varied as the different tastes of those, who are adepts in gastronomy, and know how to eat. It is to facilitate this task for my studious colleagues, that I have setCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. II my investigations, coupled with existing resources, will not be without influence on the profession in future times. Whatever the lot of this book may be, so intimately connected witli the general health and comfort ; there is one point in it, that becomes clearly manifest on one examination, namely, that I have not neglected any pains to be exact and clear : exactitude and clearness constitute indeed, in all the sciences, and especially in that of cookery, the only real bases of instruction. I have, as far as my own faculties permitted, redoubled my activity and zeal, in order to justify the title of this book ; to render the result however more successful and complete, I have not hesitated to lay under contri- bution the knowledge and experience of all the intelligent men of my acquaintance. This was, in my opinion, the safest way of arriving at a practical, sincere, and honest elaboration of culinary processes, that are so variously applied. I acknowledge with profound gratitude, that I have met with willing assistance from all sides. And now that the task is achieved ; all 1 have to do is, to await the sentence of the public, the absolute judge of an author’s work. U. D. 1808.PREFACE TO THE SECOND FRENCH EDITION. The rapidity, with which the first edition of this book has been ex- hausted, lias confirmed the hopes, that I had founded on the sympathy of the public. Botli the French, and foreign Press, have deigned to direct their atten- tion to the ‘Cosmopolitan Cookery’; and practitioners of high reputation have been kindly lavish in their praises of it. To all those enlightened minds who, at the same time that they are serving the cause of progress, place their influence and authority so gene- rously at the service of a humble fellow-laborer, I beg to express my warmest acknowledgments and thanks. I • shall reply to the sympathetic encouragement of my colleagues, by renewed efforts for the advancement of the culinary art, to which 1 devote the entire activity of an experience, jealous to justify the esteem, with which it has hitherto been honored. The ‘Cosmopolitan Cookery’, although not a book of the first order, will occupy a large place in culinary instruction, not only on account of the variety of the elements, and the new ideas it contains, but for the practical method of the different schools that it represents. Its numerous drawings, its theoretical demonstrations and definitions, form an exceptional collection, which I deem worthy to be consulted and studied, not only by cooks, but by all persons desirous of treating their guests according to the classic traditions of the table in all civilised countries. •COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. IV U. D. 1869. I particularly call the attention both of epicures and of practitioners, to the collection of Bills'of fare of authentic origin, composed and executed by intelligent men; for these Bills of fare cannot fail to be of general, nay universal interest, independently of the useful information they may furnish on the subject of alimentary productions from all the points of our gastronomic geography. With these various claims I hope the ‘Cosmopo- litan Cookery’ will soon become popular throughout civilised Europe. Its happy début makes one feel confident of the success of the second edition, which I now offer to the public, and which is undoubtedly superior to the first essay.PREFACE TO THE ENGLISH EDITION. This book, although translated from the French, is, notwithstanding, more complete, ajid even more extensive, than the original Edition: encouraged by the favorable greeting, which has welcomed my first Work, in England; it has been my earnest wish to justify this confidence, by persevering efforts for the advancement of that Culinary Art, whereunto all my anxious care is dedicated. I have, therefore, enlarged its plan, by the insertion of various instructive details. Being of opinion, that the most effectual demonstrations will be those addressed at once to the sight, and to the understanding, I have considerably augmented the number of drawings : the degree of truthfulness characterising these models will not fail to be observed by every one. Neither obstacle, nor pretext, will be found, henceforward, hindering the improvement of Cookery; when so easy an amount of study will suffice practitioners, both to complete their know- ledge of their art, and to furnish them with new resources. This book has been written with enthusiasm, but above all conscien- tiously, with a sincere desire to render it both useful and instructive. The formulas, which it contains, are the result of laborious research ; there is not one, impracticable; for the most part I have described them, while in course of actual execution : looking through them may suffice to persuade any one of the precision of their details, and of the practical common sense contained in them. Among the foreign dishes here set forth, some few may be found eccentric, and difficult of execution, whether on account of the ingredientsCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. VI used in their composition, or by reason of their peculiar process of appli- cation. But, were it only from the student’s point of view, the title of my work imposed on me the duty of bringing to light all known theories, however singular they might appear : culinary science being- without limits, practitioners mrust do their best to search it out even in its most obscure recesses. Side by side, however, with original productions, men of study will find inexhaustible resources, the more useful, that they are clear, and easy, both to comprehend and execute. ‘Cosmopolitan Cookery’ is now the Second Book that I am-publishing- in England; one more yet remains, for me to execute, of great importance and extent, in order to complete the comprehensive series, which I have planned; but I confess I feel constrained, at present, to postpone such further publication. Not that I have by any means renounced my recently announced project: far from that, my object is, to give it a more full and wide extension. Ever animated by the desire of diffusing culinary learning, I have no mind to shrink from any effort, any sacrifice; but, being only a working artist, living by his labor and the practice of his art, it may easily be understood, that my funds are not inexhaustible. Those versed in the details of publication, must be well aware, that many years are often requisite to re-imburse the cost involved in publishing attractive, but luxurious, illustrated works, like mine, addressing, by their speciality of character, only a narrow circle, not the generality of readers. Never- theless, I have good grounds for thinking, this interruption will be of no long duration : I willingly indulge the hope, that the sympathy of the public in my books, will soon permit me to resume my interrupted task, and carry it to full completion. .July, 1870. U. 1).THE ART OF EATING AT TABLE. No doubt it would require a long* study, to write ‘on the Art of Eating’, as exercised by the variety of civilised nations. The investigations requisite for that purpose, if judiciously conducted and co-ordinated, might be not uninteresting even for the learned ; but a work of that nature, and impor- tance, would by far exceed the bounds proposed for this book; I shall therefore confine myself to pointing out those general rules, which com- prehend, in brief, the sum of all my observations. I will not here enter into an examination of the manner of eating of the different modern societies, according to their rank and degree of civili- sation ; as ungracious parallels, or distasteful comparisons, might be the result. But without entering on critical appreciations, I cannot abstain from stating at the outset, that the art of eating at table, according to the principles admitted in well-bred circles, is much less advanced than it ought to be, in the actual condition of national intercourse. All those who have travelled over Europe, and have been present at dinners, whether great or little; all those who have seen many persons at- table, know perfectly well, that this assertion is by no means exaggerated. Would it then be displaying too much presumption to endeavor, on the one hand, to set aside superannuated customs, which at bottom are défective; and on the other hand, to propagate a method, more in harmony with good taste, and the best traditions of gastronomy ? I do not think so. Had 1 entertained the least suspicion, that my thought might be liable to such an interpretation, I would immediately have abandoned the ideaCOSMOPOLITAN COOKEliY. VIII of adding this ‘hors-d’œuvre’ to my cookery - hook ; but, on the con- trary, every thing strengthens me in the conviction, that my initiative comes most opportunely, to fill up a gap, and supply a deficiency, until some better qualified writer may furnish us with a complete treatise on this subject. Now-a-days, when communication between the inhabitants of the most distant countries is so easy and so frequent, when even culinary art is tending to become a universal science, and when all wish to participate in its progress ; we cannot and ought not to show ourselves indifferent to any thing, that may contribute, directly or indirectly, to strengthen the most natural tie, that binds nations to one another. Hence it would be desirable to come to an understanding, as to the adoption of a uniform and generally accepted method, on the art of eating, founded on the most rational rules. Taking one’s repasts in society, whether at home or at the tables of others, is an act of no less real import and significance, than all the other manifestations of decorum and urbanity. If alone, one is always at liberty to take one’s meals, as one may think proper; every whim or fancy, every caprice may be indulged and gratified; but in the presence of observant and experienced company, it would be inexcusable to make one’s self conspicuous by one’s ignorance, or by the contempt of customs established in the best society. Be it remarked, that we are not alluding here to the refinements of etiquette, but solely to a method, of which the rational application might regulate the motions of the person eating, and at the same time contribute to his ease and comfort at table. These brief remarks relieve me of the task of urging any more explicit or detailed considerations. Suffice it here to say, that the English method, if not the most disseminated, is at least the one most observed and practised in the higher circles of society; and that, in all probability, it will one of these days (at no very distant epoch) take the lead of all the others. Indeed, the English enjoy, in this respect, a European reputation; they both eat at their ease themselves, and do not inconvenience their neigh- bours at table: these are two points, which, in my opinion, give to theirIX THE ART OF EATING AT TABLE. method an incontestable superiority. And yet, this method is equally simple botli in practice and in theory, as easy to be comprehended, as to lie demonstrated. This is so true, that if I did not fear to be misunderstood, I should say — that, what appears difficult, inconvenient, and impossible, is — not to eat according to the rules of this method. In order to eat at one’s ease, and without automatic stiffness, one must first be seated commodiously, and perpendicularly, neither too high, nor too low ; the chest upright, at an equal distance from the back of the chair and from the table. On the left of the plate there should be a solid fork, rather heavy than light; on the right the spoon and knife, the latter having a broad blade rounded at the extremity. When the hands are not occupied with carving or conveying the food to the mouth, they may be reposing on the edge of the table, but only as far as the wrist. When about to eat (with the exception of soup, which is always absorbed by holding the spoon with the right hand) or to cut the food that is on the plate, the fork ought to be used with the left hand, the points or prongs turned downwards, and pressed on with the extended fore-finger, to maintain it in an almost horizontal, and not a perpendicular position. The knife is then taken with the right hand, and with the aid of its rounded blade, the piece cut is covered, either with the sauce, or with the garnishes that are served with the meat, to raise it to the mouth, but solely with the help of the fork, and consequently with the left hand : the knife * ought never to be raised to the mouth. When one ceases to cut or eat, whether it be to join in the conver- sation , or while waiting for another dish ; the knife and fork ought to be laid 011 the plate, the handle of the one turned to the right, and the handle of the other turned to the left, in other words the two extremities pointing inwards, so as to be able to remove them at once, when required to be used again. * I cannot refrain from introducing at this place a remark of great interest and importance to delicate epicures, viz. that the English, when attable, never touch fish with a knife For this reason many persons hold the fork with the right hand when eating fish, as the knife has no office to fulfil, no • duty to discharge.X COSMOPOLITAN COOKEKY. It will be perceived, that the method 1 commend, is based, one may say, altogether on the principle of the fork remaining invariably at the service of the left hand, in regard to food that requires to be cut up on the plate, while the knife and spoon belong to the right hand; in any case they should not be displaced by passing them from left to right, or from right to left. This displacement is sometimes the result of a pre-occupation of mind, that cannot be too carefully avoided; for as soon as the instru- ments are diverted from the office naturally assigned to them, confusion arises, and embarrassment betrays itself. Awkwardness, real or apparent, therefore simply depends on the observance, more or less attentive, of a few rules, that might be thought unimportant, but from which an ex- perienced guest never departs. Thus, to accustom one’s self to hold the fork with the left hand, in order to convey the food to the mouth, soup excepted; to hold the knife or the spoon with the right hand, without any transposition ; is nearly all, that constitutes the basis and the principle of the method. The remainder is but a secondary and accessory question, belonging to a code of cere- monial rules, which I have neither the desire, nor the right to draw up. My only object here is, to be the promoter of a reform, on the continent; which, in my opinion, the exigencies of improvement require in the order of gastronomy.BILLS OF FARE. To every person, not sufficiently initiated in the practical forms of culinary art, the bill of fare (menu) will have only a trivial signification; it is not every body, that is aware of its utility or importance ; but practi- tioners, as well as ‘gourmets’, know perfectly well how to appreciate its high purpose and significance. In the eyes of the amphitryon, the bill of fare is the eloquent expression of the dinner he is expecting. For the practitioner, it is a matter of still greater interest ; as it is the representative of all his exertions, his abilities, his vigils, and unceasing labors;there slumber hidden in its folds, as well the secret hope of triumph, as the apprehensions of failure: a reflection of his science, it may be considered the ‘rock a-head’, or the symbol of his future. If, moreover, it is considered, that a badly composed bill of fare cannot but be the precursor of a poor dinner ; it will be easily believed, how many deceptions and disappointments there may be, reflected on those glazed little squares of paper. These consequences, too, depend in all appearance on such petty details; that young men cannot too carefully make themselves acquainted with the experiences of competent men for meditating and seriously studying the composition of bills of fare ; above all they never must forget, that a bill of fare, well composed and ingeniously executed, has more than once altered the destiny of a cook. Questioning the absolute necessity of the bill of fare, or the importance of the part it plays, therefore, is considered by me as the greatest culinary heresy : it being as much as to wrong one of the branches of the art, which, as regards its labors and material principles, may well exact a little prestige.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. XII Besides this, its necessity is obvious : the first thought of an amphitryon, intending to give an entertainment, always is, the composition or requesting of a bill of fare: as well as the first desire of a ‘gourmet’ sitting down to his dinner is, consulting his bill of fare. On the other hand, it is next to impossible for the practitioner to set to work, without having a bill of fare before him. Nothing more needs to be said, to justify its existence. But there is another occasion, when a bill of fare acquires the highest importance : I mean in the first relations between an amphitryon and his cook. The first bill of fare, in the eyes of an intelligent ‘gourmet’, is a very touch-stone, revealing to him the knowledge of his new steward of the kitchen ; and gives him ample opportunity of measuring the degree of con- fidence, safely to be placed in the success of his dinner. The first impression once being a satisfactory one, the amphitryon sets his mind at ease; were it not so, he will remain anxious': there being no denying the existence of a sort of solidarity, between him who orders a dinner, and him who is to execute it ; as the success, as well as the failure of the latter, in some mea- sure must be shared or borne by him presiding at the meal. Therefore, if a cook neglects composing his bills of fare in the best practical conditions, he in a certain degree risks his situation, even previous to having endeavoured or attempted to secure it. The bill of fare, consequently, is both the program of the house’s eti- quette, and the guide of the steward of the kitchen, previous to becoming that of the guests. Until the moment of the dinner’s appearance on the table, the bill of fare maintains the greatest interest, and in the eyes of the ‘gourmets’ pre- serves a high importance : if sagaciously composed, if its composition be faultless, it awakens dreams of exquisite enjoyments, and creates charming illusions. If, on the contrary, it were founded on false principles ; anxiety and doubt take possession of the guests. This is the very thing to be at any cost avoided; because it proves more than difficult, advantageously to struggle against prejudices, that may once have taken root. Hence it follows, that the matter of composing a bill of fare is a serious thing, never to be undertaken by a cook, but with great reserve, and after mature reflection.BILLS OF FARE. XIII In course of practice, a well composed and well understood bill of fare, must above all be clear, precise, and correct. It must be easy of com- prehension, but above all scrupulously accurate. Tlie materials, brought to the composition of the dinner, must lie various and distinct, but especially distributed skilfully, and in such a manner as to prevent their being- confounded. The series of dishes must be classed in order, and be con- formable to those corresponding with them ; every dish must be of a par- ticular character, distinguishing it clearly, both by shape and foundation, from the one preceding or following it. As to the sauces, they must be of various nature, flavor, and color, 'flic least error traced here, gives token of inexperience, and may endanger the ultimate success of the total. But it may happen, that the best composed bill of fare, and even a dinner artistically prepared, by some unforeseen emergency, are subjected to ulterior modifications; the want, or deficiency, of a material depended on ; a chance accident ; are obstacles, the cook often has to battle with ; but a bill of fare cannot be denounced as a falsehood, a dinner cannot be said to have failed, if one dish is replaced by another; the great point being, that it is replaced suitably, that is, that the nature of the newly introduced dish, ought not to clash with the rest of the dinner. Well, this does not give an insurmountable obstacle for an intelligent cook : the instinct of danger, the cool sense and that assurance inspired by the consciousness of an impor- tant task, will always triumph over such momentary embarrassments. From all that is here said, it must be gathered, that the studying of bills of fare may on no account be slightly regarded by cooks: on the con- trary they should bestow on them all the care and attention, of which they are capable. And they will learn best, how to compose them according to the rules of practice, by means of calm consideration, and by way of comparison. In order to popularise this branch of study, I have reproduced here a series of authenticated bills of fare, coming from the remotest countries, but composed by men, whose experience proves the best guarantee. These bills of fare are not all of them established according to the same principle; a matter easily to be explained by the different methods applied to the service of theXIV COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. table in the various countries of Europe. In re-producing them, just as they have been communicated to me, my intention was, to afford cooks an opportunity of studying the distinctions constituting the main difference. These bills of fare, as well as the book in itself, are of European origin : let me presume, that by this claim alone, they may be so much the more acceptable, and useful as a model.AUTHENTIC BILLS OP FARE, XV Ph o PM O Kl H o O O O PH O ffl « o O »c5 s=u «93 2 2 o CO G o Ü o a, a c5 95 rG 93 H3 a cd 2 c3 93 PG .2 ^ 3 -5 .§ <« Ü5 o' 93 2 O G fl G G CQ • i—D .S' ® Ph § CD G > d 0 G d 2 ® 3 so 2 g G O GQ 1-2 2 ^ 1 s O «3 2 05 *> ^ a> 'ro .o C0 ^ '03 0 -*J Jx G ^ s .a ” £ 03 d "3 G O -G PP O G g o Ph G G Ph <33 d GQ bfl bn d G r3 GQ o *h m bO Z G ^ pq i 23 03 G u G o ,cô fcO _G v0 •** G C/3 » ?. c3 O 033 o 03 3 s S G o5 œ «o &C _-+f 3 '? s ° 2s P- g 'G o 93 O •93 co 93 e3 o ® 3 “ P o •ü a ^ G G cr< - G Eh 03 03 •2 § 03 g « # 25 'G G ° bc o 'g * 2 2 " ,03 G . .

MODERN SAFE (GARDE-MANGER). The design, here presented to the reader, is that of a garde-manger or safe, in the form of a press or closet (armoire), hitherto hut little known, yet destined, I believe, to be accepted, and extensively adopted in all countries ; in town, as well as country, its utility, in a kitchen, is alike indisputable; especially in parts, where ice, not being abundant, is even on that account expensive. Considered with reference to the object of economising the raw, ice, it is incomparably preferable to the ice-cases or chests (timbres), used up to this time in kitchens : seeing the very small quantity of ice, that would be quite sufficient to maintain its interior in a temperature of perfect cool- ness. Considered on the other hand, with reference to the preservation of theXL VI COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. eatables, this kind of safe, or ‘armoire’, is far superior also to the ‘timbres’; because these eatables are thus exposed to an equally intense coolness on all their surfaces, without however being in direct contact with the ice itself: this difference is the more appreciable, because, by resting in immediate contact on the ice, all kinds of food, whatever be their, nature, must contact a very prejudicial alteration. This ‘armoire’ is on the outer side constructed in wood; in the interior it is lined with zinc. The walls, or sides of the central part, where the iron-gratings are arranged, have a double bottom, that is to say, that an empty space or passage is contrived, all round and at the base of this compartment, so as to facilitate the circulation of the concentrated cold. The raw ice is placed in three cavities having a parallel arrangement on the upper surface piert position of the ‘armoire’; the two lateral cavities descend as far down as to the deq^tli of the lowermost grating {grille) of the central compartment ; the central cavity reaches however only to the depth of the first compartment of the closet; these cavities are first of all closed, each one separately, with a cover shutting in hermetically fast, and then with the top of the ‘armoire, forming a second cover; by these arrangements, the communication of the air with the ice will be found completely intercepted. Tlie central compartment is furnished with several open and movable gratings in zinc; of which the number therefore can be diminished or augmented as occasion requires. This compartment is closed effectively by means of double doors, of which the inner ones are hollow double case; the outer son simply lined with zinc. For very large closets, these doors are generally cut in two, so as to form four openings: this is in order to avoid, as entirely as possible, the indroduction of the warm air into the interior of the ‘armoire’. The third division of the ‘armoire’ is formed into a drawer; this drawer, like- wise lined with zinc, is the natural receptacle, into which descends the water trickling down from the melting of the ice; this water consequently retains a degree of coolness quite sufficient to keep cool any bottles of wine, or decanters (caraffes) of water. These closets, or cupboards, are utilised, not only for preserving the coolnes of comestibles ; their peculiarly convenient arrangement enables one to utilise them also in important culinary operations, more especially in summer, keeping on the gratings in the cool, iced entremets and other cold-pieces, previously dished; it is always a great advantage for cooks, not to feel or find themselves under the necessity of dishing entremets or cold-pieces, at the lass moment before serving them. It is by consideration of all these practical advantages that I have come to the decision of presenting a drawing of this ‘garde-manger’, in the hope of thus contri- buting to their more general use.XLVII AUTHENTIC BILLS OF FARE. 1MODERN ENGLISH ROASTING-GRATE, WITH SCREEN.AUTHENTIC BILLS OF FARE, XL1X ANCIENT FRENCH ROASTINC-GKRATE.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY, L GERMAN COOKING-STOVE, MIXT SYSTEM.ERRATA AND CORRIGENDA. page, line. for read page, line. for read 2, 3. h Ot ll Ot 10. 29. skim (/’< of ) oft' its 9, 17, 20. c é (tes c è pes 12, 39. mur e Is, i Is. 11, nit. 0 x e Ji re 20. note varnished. glazed. 32, note. ogur cs i, ts —, 29: 21. 6, 14 salt, salt ed. 38,31:70, 38. half a liait' 25, 32. throw i u, in to, 39, 6. papri h a, a a 90, 13 -shape fashion, -like fashion, 57. 17. v) i tk to i th 6. 30 : and] [or dome-shape. 91, 4.

Soups are served among all the Nations familiarised with gastronomy. The English, the French, the Germans, the Russians, and generally all the populations of the North of Europe, are fond of soups. In Russia, the soup often forms the most luxurious dish of a dinner, and alone costs more than all the rest of the dishes. If, in some countries, soups are served in different conditions ; it is not the less true, that they have a great importance everywhere.* In the North of Europe, and in England, the soups are preferably garnished witli meat, poultry, game, or fish. In France1 light garnishes are usually preferred. Purees, creams, and thickened soups, may be served without any; whilst liquid soups, consommes, and clear broths, always require garnish of some sort or other. The garnishes for soups may be more or less abundant and varied, according as they are destined for plain, or choice dinners. There are circumstances, when the soup has come to be regarded as one of the most important dishes of the repast ; in such a case every license is allowed, so long as it is served with those requirements, which its nature admits. Rut in a regular dinner, where dishes are select and distinguished, where the soup is only a relative accessory, it should make itself conspicuous only for its delicate richness at once and simplicity. But whatever be the * Soup is not in England, as in France, a dish, even at the daily dinner-table indispensable; but though it may be true, that soup is, for the most part, less generally used, at any rate in small and simple households; yet is it, however, undeniable, that as in every other gastronomic land in Europe, so in England, no dinner of distinction will be served, without including soup. Nor can soup be reckoned only as a customary dish; it is no less wholesome, and beneficial ; nay to exhausted appetites, and powers of digestion, even indispensable.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 9 nature of the soups, and of the place where they are served ; it is a rule, not to be infringed or overlooked, for it applies ecpially to all, to serve them hot. The soup and' the coffee, the one served at the beginning of the dinner, the other at the end, have this point however of similarity, in the opinion of true epicures, that they must be brought to table, so as to admit of being taken, as near as may be, in a boiling state. It is only in such a condition, that one is able to appreciate their beneficial and agreeable flavor. The varied and very extensive collection of soups, that I produce in this chapter, deserves to be studied with the most serious care ; these soups belonging to all countries, to all schools. For the most part they have each some special ground of preference; and, if wanting other merit, all boast that of novelty. 1. White broth. — White broth (bouillon blanc) is used for the preparation of light soups, which are to remain white; such as, creams of chicken, barley, rice, asparagus,, etc. Put into a stockpot two knuckles of veal, some bones or trimmings of veal, the giblets of one or two chickens ; and moisten, with four or five quarts of water: add a little salt, and set the stockpot on the tire, to start the liquid to ebullition, skimming carefully ; at the first bubbling remove it off again, three-parts cover it, and arrange the fire in such a manner, that the broth boil only on one side. Half an hour after, add to it a large carrot, a small piece of turnip, a little celery, a bunch composed of two leeks and a pinch of parsley. Continue boiling gently, until the meat of the knuckles of veal be done. Then pass the broth through a damp napkin, and let it settle previous to use. 2. Refreshing broth. — Singe and draw an old lien; divide it into four parts, which put into a small earthen stockpot with a small knuckle of veal cut in pieces; pour over the whole four quarts of cold water, add a little salt, and set the stockpot on a moderate fire, so as to boil the liquid, skimming carefully. At the first bubbling, remove it back, add to it a handful of pearl-barley, a caiTot, two leeks, and part of a large turnip. About one hour afterwards, add three cabbage- lettuces, fresh-gathered, well-washed, and whole; as well as two small onions colored in the oven : one hour later, a pinch of chervil should be added too, and half anSOUPS. hour after, skim the fat off (dégraisser) the broth, and pass it gently through a napkin, previously moistened and well wrung out. 3. Nutritive broth. — Take six pounds of lean meat, cut off a shoulder of beef, remove the bones, divide it into square pieces of about six ounces each ; lay them in a suitable stockpot, and moisten with eight or ten quarts of cold water ; set the stockpot on the fire, and attend to this broth as for the common ‘pot-au-feu', that is, salt, skim, garnish it with vegetables, and let the liquid boil gently on one side only. Two hours later, add to it a bone of roast-beef, or of a roasted leg of mutton; when the meat is done, pass the broth through a napkin, skim its fat. At this time the broth should be succulent, of a nice color, and of a clearness equal to that of a ‘consommé’. 4. Broth ‘à la minute’. — In a moment of urgency, good broth may be obtained by the following process: take four pounds of meat from a leg of beef; it should be lean ; and all fat, skin, and sinews, being carefully removed, next cut the meat into small dice, so as thoroughly to chop or pound it; put it into a stewpan, and dilute with cold water (nearly two quarts to a pound of meat); after which, add to it a few minced vegetables, such as, carrots, celery-roots, leeks, and onions; a pinch of chervil, a few peppercorns, cloves, and if handy a few backs or trimmings of fowl, cither raw or cooked. Set the stewpan on a moderate fire, stirring from time to time; and when it begins to boil, remove the stewpan back, so as only to simmer the liquid gently. Twenty minutes after, pass the broth through a moistened napkin, and clear it of its fat. 5. French‘pot-au-feu’soup.— If a good pot-au-feu soup is wanted, a few pounds of meat more or less must not matter; for the juiciness and perfection of the broth depend on the quantity of meat used : this is a matter of fact needing no further demonstration. If the soup is wanted for seven or eight persons, choose a rump of beef weighing about six pounds. Having washed it in cold water, bone, truss, and put it into an earthen stockpot, with giblets of poultry, and a little knuckle of veal, certainly not very expensive materials ; let these meats be steeped in six or eight quarts of cold water, observing that the stockpot should be about full : add a small handful of salt, and set the stockpot on a moderate fire, gradually bringing the liquid to ebullition. Skim the fat oft’ the liquid, as it rises to the surface ; and at the first bubbling, throw in a glassful of cold water ; then remove the pot back to the side of the stove-fire, so as to give it heat but on one side : this being the only means of getting a clear broth. Let the ebullition be very moderate, and steadily continued, for five hours at the least : the vessel must be only partially covered.4 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. Two hours after the liquid begins to boil, add to it the half of a blanched crisped colewort, a large onion colored in the oven, four new carrots, three leeks, a large turnip cut up, a celery-root, and a parsnip. The meat being nearly done, add to it a'bunch of chervil, a few cloves, half a bay-leaf : let it boil continually. Twenty minutes previous to serving, place some broiled slices of bread in the tureen, sprinkle over a pinch of fine pepper; skim the broth slightly of its fat; then pass it through a fine sieve, yet without troubling it; this done, pour it into the tureen, either all at once or in parts; add to it half of the cut vegetables, the remainder of which keep by, in order to surround the beef. G. ‘Cucido’, Portuguese fashion. — Put into an earthen stockpot two pounds of beef, a piece of raw ham, the knuckle-bone of a leg of mutton, a hen, and two or three handfuls of softened ‘garbanços’ ; pour over the whole five or six quarts of water, skim the liquid, and when beginning to boil, remove the stockpot back. Two hours after, add a small blanched and trussed savoy-cabbage, two leeks, a tomata cut in two, one carrot, and a few cloves. One hour after, plunge into the broth a ‘choriso’, or a smoked sausage; and when the meats are done, _pass the broth through a sieve into a stewpan, and keep it hot. Chop one onion, fry it of a nice color with a little lard, mix with it four or five handfuls of good rice ; moisten with the prepared broth (three times its height), cover it, and let it boil slowly; when dry, and well done, add a tablespoonful of sweet pimento, and a spoonful of tomata-sauce. With the remainder of the broth, free of its fat, prepare a tapioca soup; which, as soon as ready, pour into the tureen. Take the beef, the hen, the ham, and the ‘choriso’, out.of the stockpot, and set'all these meats on a large oval dish, surrounding them with the ‘garbanços’, and the cut up cabbages. Serve the rice on a separate dish. 7. ‘Puchero \ as in Spain. — Like the French ‘pot-au-feu’ in France, the ‘puchero’ is a dish daily served in Spanish families ; but it must be eaten in the country itself to be thoroughly appreciated. Put two pounds of brisket of beef into an earthen stockpot, with the giblets of a chicken, a pig’s ear, half a pound of salted pork or blanched ham, and three handfuls of softened ‘garbanços’. Moisten the meats with five or six quarts of water; set the stockpot on the fire, skim the liquid, and when it begins to boil, remove it back. Two hours after, add to it two leeks tied together, then a bunch of chervil, and a pinch of wild mint (‘hierba buena’), a slice of good pumpkin (courge), withoutSOUPS. 5 peel or seed, one head of cabbage-lettuce, one large carrot, and the half of a blanched savoy-cabbage. One hour after, add to the above a ‘choriso’, and continue a moderate ebullition. When about to serve, take the stockpot off the lire, pour the soup gently, passing it through a sieve, into a stewpan, and then into the tureen itself; add to it the leeks and the lettuce cut-up, as well as some slices of fried toast. Place the beef on a dish, surrounded Avith the ham, the ‘choriso’, and the vegetables. The meats accompany the soup. 8. Consommé with quenelles. — Take the meat of a raAV chicken, \ trim it, and prepare with it some ‘quenelle’ force-meat. Chop line a quarter of a pound of lean beef meat, and the same of veal, put them all into a steAvpan, mix in tAvo whole eggs Avell beaten, dilute the hash Avith three quarts of good cold broth, free of its fat. Cut into small pieces the whole of a cooked foAvl : add them to the broth, as Avell as the wings, legs, giblets, and back, of the raw foAvl ; also one carrot, one leek, and a small piece of celery, all these vegetables Avell minced: set the stewpan on a moderate lire, to bring the liquid to gentle ebullition, and at the first bubbling remove the stewpan back, so as to let it boil on one side only. By the aid of tAvo teaspoons mould the force-meat into three dozen small ‘que- nelles’: poach these in the boiling water, drain them on a sieve, and put them into the soup-tureen, skim the ‘consommé’ carefully of its fat, and pour it over the ‘quenelles’, passing it through a wet cloth well Avrung-out. 9. Consommé, with pheasant-custard. — Take about a pound of cooked pheasant’s meat, remove the skin, cut the meat up, and keep it covered. Mince one onion, one leek, and half a root of celery ; fry them with butter, add the bones and backs of pheasant, broken in pieces, as well as the raw or cooked trimmings that may be at disposal: add to these a few trimmings of ham, a bunch of aromatics (aromates), moisten the whole Avith three or four quarts of broth ; set the steAvpan on the fire, skim the liquid carefully, and when it begins to boil, remove the stewpan back. One hour and a half after, strain the broth through a napkin, and skim off its fat. Meanwhile, pound the cooked pheasant-meat, add four tablespoonfuls of sauce, eight raw yolks of egg ; pass the preparation through a sieve, or a tammy (étamine), season Avith a little nutmeg, and pour it into a plain round buttered mould, the bottom of which is covered by a piece of paper. Set this mould in a steAvpan, to poach the preparation in the ‘bain-marie’ ; as soon as it is of a nice consistency,6 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. take it off the fire, let it cool, turn it out, and divide it in middle-sized squares ; which put into the soup-tureen ; then pour the game-‘consommé’ on the custard. 10. Olio consommé. — At the court of Vienna this ‘consommé’ is usually served for ball-suppers. Yet from the nature of its composition, as well as the name it bears, it seems of Spanish origin. Prepare some stock (fonds) with a piece of round of beef, two calves’ feet, and two knuckles of veal ; the last of which must be previously blanched. Add a few large vegetables, and a little salt ; moisten the meat with ten quarts of broth, and boil it as carefully as a ‘pot-au-feu’. As soon as the meat is done, drain it, pass the liquid through a sieve, skim its fat, and let it set. Mince, but not too small, some onions, leeks, carrots, celery-and parsley-roots; put the vegetables into a stewpan with butter, let them fry on a very gentle lire. When of a nice color, add to them a piece of pork, a shoulder of mutton, two partridges, two fowls, the two hindlegs of a hare, and a few bones of pheasant and poultry; all of which meat must be only half-roasted, and then divided in pieces. Add also a piece of raw ham, previously blanched, as well as some raw poultry-giblets, a bunch of aromatics, and whole spice. Let these meats fry for a few minutes, then moisten them plentifully with the previously prepared stock. Skim the liquid, remove it to the side of the lire. The meat being done, pass the ‘consommé’ into a stewpan, carefully skim it’s fat, dilute it with a bottle of Madeira or Malaga wine, let it clarify on the side of the lire for an hour, skimming it carefully. This ‘consommé’ is served, either plain, or mixed with rice; in any case it may be considered as restorative, tonic, and stomachic. 11. Consommé, with ravioles of game. — Prepare two or three quarts of ‘consommé’ of game, as in No. 9. Take out the two lillets of a raw partridge, remove the skin and sinews, cut the meat into pieces, which pound in a mortar, together with half their volume of cooked calves’ brains, the same of raw beef-marrow, and of parmesan. This force-meat being ready, add to it two yolks of egg, take it out of the mortar, prepare with it, five or six dozens of small ‘ravioles’ (see ‘Farinages’). Five minutes previous to serving, plunge the ‘ravioles’ into boiling salted water, let the liquid bubble several times, then remove the stewpan off the lire; and three minutes after, drain the ‘ravioles’ on a sieve; place them in the soup-tureen, and pour the ‘consommé’ over the garnishes. 12. Consommé, ‘à la bonne femme’. — Prepare a quart and a half of good ‘consommé’, proceeding as in No. 8 ; when strained, keep it hot on the side of the lire ; cut up some thin slices of brown bread, rather long, without removing the crust; range seven or eight of them, in circular order ‘« cheval’, in each of the7 SOUPS. soup-plates. Butter slightly the centre of these plates left free, then break a very fresh egg in the cavity formed by the bread, season it with salt and pepper, pour on the bottom of the plates a little ‘consommé’, and push them into a moderate oven, so as gently to poach the egg. On taking the plate out of the oven, pour some ‘consommé’ over the slices of bread, and send up the plates, at the same time with a tureen of‘consommé’, mixed up at the time with a ‘pluche’ of chervil, or a garnish of small vegetables. 13. Consommé of fish with quenelles. — Mince a large onion, two leeks, and one carrot ; fry them in a stewpan with butter, add to them four pounds of common bony fish, such as gurnet, perch, and tench; add also a head of turbot, or a slice of conger ; moisten the fish to its height with white wine, and hot water, half and half; add a bunch of parsley and aromatics (aromates), salt, cloves and peppercorns ; cover the stewpan, and boil the fish over a brisk fire for twenty minutes; strain the broth through a sieve, skim off its fat, and let it settle. Chop a pound of flesh of whiting or of pike, mix in three whole eggs, dilute it with a glass of white wine, then with the fish-broth; add a few minced vegetables, such as, celery-roots, carrots, and leeks; set the stewpan on a moderate fire, stirring the liquid till it begins to boil, at which moment remove it to the side, and when clear, strain it through the napkin. Mould, in small teaspoons, two dozen ‘quenelles’ of whitings, which poach, drain, and range in the soup-tureen; skim the fat off the ‘consommé’, which pour over the ‘quenelles’. 14. Consommé with biscottes, Vienna fashion. — Nearly melt eight ounces of butter, pour this into a kitchen-basin, to be worked with a spoon. When of a pretty good consistence, add, one by one, three or four yolks of egg. As soon as the preparation becomes frothy, introduce into it eight ounces of flour with, at the same time, the four whites whipped, but without letting the preparation curve (corder); season it with a little salt and nutmeg, spread it over a buttered and floured baking-sheet, in a layer the third of an inch thick, and bake it in a slow oven. On taking it out, divide it into lozenges, which dish on a plate, and serve with a soup-tureen of good ‘consommé’ of game, poultry, or fish. 15. Epicures’ consommé. — Take three round dinner rolls : cut from the centre of each, three thin slices; which toast on one side only, on which mask them with a thick layer of good fresh grated parmesan; sprinkle a little pepper over the cheese, range the slices of bread on a gridiron, which put into the oven, and keep there till the cheese become dissolved, and slightly glazed ; when they are taken out, and ranged on a warm dish, so as to keep them hot.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 8 Pour a quart of good ‘consommé’ into a stewpan, bring it to ebullition, add to it live or six tablespoonfuls of Madeira, and poach therein eight or ten very fresh eggs, keeping them quite round; at the first bubbling, remove the stewpan to the side of the fire, cover and keep it thus for five minutes; then lift the eggs out with a slice, and set one of them on each piece of toasted bread. Then pass the ‘consommé’ through a sieve into the tureen, and with it serve the eggs and toast separately. 1(>. Jacobins’ consommé. — Chop six ounces of lean cooked ham, pound it, mix therewith two tablespoonfuls of reduced ‘béchamelsauce, four tablespoonfuls of red tomata-purée, a pinch of cayenne, six yolks of egg, and two eggs whole ; pass the preparation through a tammy, put it into a kitchen-basin, add to it two tablespoonfuls of Madeira, and six spoonfuls of good ‘consommé’. Fill with this preparation some buttered ‘dariole’-moulds, and poach it in the ‘bain-marie’. Meanwhile, prepare two quarts of ‘consommé’, such as described in No. 8. When ready to serve, take the small custards off the moulds, divide each of them into four parts, place them in the soup-tureen with two gills of fresh green-peas, boiled at the time in salted water; pour the ‘consommé’ over. 17. Consommé with noques, Geneva fashion. — Have two quarts of good ‘consommé’ on the corner of the stove. Chop half a pound (250 gr.) of small slices of raw veal, pound them, add five ounces (150 gr.) of butter; pass them through a sieve; put this force-meat into the mortar, season with salt and spices, introduce into it three parts its volume of common ‘chou’-paste, finished Avith eggs, and a handful of grated parmesan. Pound the preparation well ; when the mixture is completed, take it, by small portions, with a teaspoon; and let the paste drop into hot broth. Let the liquid boil for a few seconds, cover the stewpan, and remove it back. Three minutes after, drain the ‘noques’, place them in a soup-tureen, and pour over them the ‘consommé’. 18. Julienne soup, ‘à la Faubonne’. — ‘Julienne’ is a national soup of France. The most favorable time for its preparation is spring and summer, for then the vegetables forming its foundation are fresh and tender. In winter, this soup loses its purpose, as well as its true qualities; as at that season vegetables are sour, hard, and dry, and have lost a great deal of their fragrant properties. A great variety of young roots and tender vegetables well befits this soup ; nevertheless one must be careful, not to take too great a quantity: as a ‘Julienne’ overloaded with vegetables becomes defective. Trim two good-sized carrots, one turnip, a small root of celery, two new onions, one leek, the half of a savoy cabbage, one fine head of lettuce, one handful ofsours. 9 sorrel, and a few tender green-peas. Cut separately, into thin slices, the carrots, turnips, and roots of celery, and carve the slices into small pieces (filets) of about an inch long, but very fine : of the carrots only the red parts are used. Slice and mince the leeks, and onions ; put them into a stewpan with butter, and fry them for a few minutes on a slow fire ; then add the fillets of carrot, turnip, and celery ; fry them all for a few minutes ; sprinkle over them a little salt, and a pinch of sugar ; moisten them with two gills of broth, free of fat ; cover the stewpan, and let it boil until the liquid gets somewhat of a glaze ; then moisten with two quarts of fresh boiling broth, and remove the stewpan back. Five and twenty minutes after, add to these the lettuces, the cabbage blanched and trimmed, and lastly the green-peas raw; which vegetables boil for three quarters of an hour: when about to serve, skim the fat off the soup, add to it the shred and blanched sorrel ; as well as the value of two gills of puree of peas, fresh or dried. Pour the soup into the tureen, and serve. 19. RUSS Julienne-SOUp. — Shred into ‘julienne’ one carrot, one mid- dling-sized turnip, a piece of celery-root, a radish cabbage (chon-rave), two onions, and one leek; shred also some yribouis, that is to say, some fresh ‘cèpes’, equal in quantity to the vegetables. Fry in butter the onions and the leek, without allowing them to take color; add to them the other minced roots, as well as the ‘cèpes’, reduce their moisture, then cover these vegetables with a little broth, which likewise reduce to a glaze; moisten a second time with three or four quarts of fresh boiling broth, and remove the stewpan to the side of the fire. One hour and a half later, skim the fat off the soup, mix with it a pinch of chopped fennel, thicken it with a few spoonfuls of sour cream (■smitane), strained through a sieve, and pour it into the soup-tureen. In Russia it is the custom to serve, with this soup, a plate of small patties, ‘croquettes’, or ‘rissoles’. 20. Polish Julienne-SOUp. — Put into a stewpan four handfuls of preser- ved peas, two handfuls of dry mushrooms, one carrot, and a piece of celery-root: moisten these vegetables with four or five quarts of cold water, let the liquid boil, remove the stewpan to the side, and finish cooking the vegetables gently. Meanwhile, cut in ‘julienne’ one leek, one onion, one root of celery, and one of parsley, and a piece of raw beet-root ; fry in butter the onion and the leek, add after- wards the other vegetables, and ten minutes later, moisten them with some of the prepared broth, strained through a fine sieve ; let the soup boil, then remove it back, and after three quarters of an hour, add to it half of a winter cabbage, blanched and shred in ‘julienne’, as well as a small part of the mushrooms boiled in the broth, and also shred.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 10 Half an hour later, thicken the soup with four or live tablespoonfuls of sour cream, add thereto a pinch of chopped green fennel, and pour it into the soup- tureen. Serve separately a plate of small fried ‘rissoles’, garnished with a ‘sal- picon’ of mushrooms. 21. Calves’-tail soup, India fashion. — Cut six calves’ tails, each of them in two, blanch and refresh them in water, drain them well, and sponge them on a cloth. Mince one onion and one leek, fry them in butter with nearly half a pound of raw ham cut in dice; add to this the calves’ tails, leave them on the tire for a while, sprinkle over them two tablespoonfuls of flour, the same of curry-powder; fry them a few seconds more, and moisten, by degrees, with two or three quarts of broth ; add to the above one carrot, a piece of celery, and a bunch of parsley and aromatics. Bring the liquid to boil, stirring with a spoon ; then remove the stewpan back, to let the soup simmer gently until the tails be done. Now drain, trim, and range them in the soup-tui’een ; then pour the liquid in, after passing it through a tine colander. 22. Hoche-pot soup. — Cut an ox-tail in pieces, which steep for a few hours in cold water. Blanch, drain, refresh, and put them back into the same stewpan; add a minced onion, a little dripping, a raw ham-bone, a knuckle of veal, a few giblets of fowl, and a few sprigs of aromatics (aromates). Set the stewpan on a moderate fire, fry these meats gently to a nice color; moisten with four quarts of light broth, let the liquid boil, skimming well; remove it back, introduce into it a piece of blanched streaky bacon (petit-lard), two large carrots, one good-sized turnip, a root of celery, and two leeks. An hour and a half afterwards, add to the broth three or four blanched and trussed lettuces, as well as the heart of a small cabbage, also blanched and trussed; so as to remove them easily, as soon as done. Continue boiling gently, until the meats be completely done; then take them out carefully, and place them on a dish, Avith the bacon, and the vegetables, cut in dice; then pass the broth through a napkin, skim it of its fat, and pour it into a soup-tureen, containing the lettuces cut in pieces, and some slices of bread toasted. Let the soup accompany the meats dressed on a dish. 23. ‘Croûte-au-pot’ soup, Paris fashion. — Bone a piece of leg of beef, weighing about four pounds; truss it, and put it into an earthen stockpot, Avith six quarts of water, a little salt, and a feAV slices of blanched streaky bacon; set the stockpot on the fire, skim the liquid carefully ; and remove it back, to simmer gently. An hour and a half later, add a knuckle of veal, and a hen ; tAVO leeks, tied up Avith a pinch of chervil, tAvo carrots, one turnip, a head of celery, one onion coloredSOUPS. 11 in the oven, cloves and peppercorns; a small savoy-cabbage and four lettuces, blan- ched and tied up separately. One hour after, put into the broth a bone of roasted leg of mutton, or of roast- beef, or else two backs of roasted fowl; continue boiling for three hours. Take out the vegetables, divide them in pieces, and put them into the soup-tureen, with some crusts of bread of about an inch long, previously buttered and toasted. Pass the broth through a napkin, skim off half its fat, and pour the broth into the soup-tureen. 24. ‘Cuscus’ of the Arabs. — The ‘cuscus’ (or cooscoogoo) is a sort of semolina, or paste of wheat, prepared thus by the Arabs. Take some good wheat (grain) ; cleanse it well, and wash it in several waters, until the epidermis be somewhat tender; then gather it into a heap on a smooth table, cover it with a damp cloth, and expose it for several hours to a burning sun, that is, until the grain swells; then remove the cloth, spread the corn in a thin layer, so as to dry quickly, and shrivel in the heat of the sun. In such a state grind it between two millstones, according to the usual process ; but notice that the stones be distant enough to bruise the wheat, without pulverising. Winnow it afterwards, to extract the bran and flour which may remain. To prepare this soup, one should have at one’s disposal a colander without a handle, fitting closely to the mouth of an earthen stockpot, which is kept hanging by aid of three hooks, so as not, however, to prevent the stockpot from being closed hermetically. Cut the half of a leg of mutton, off the knuckle-end; put it into the stock- pot, with a good hen, a little salt, and four or five quarts of water ; observing, that the water only reach to three quarters of the height of the vessel ; place it on the fire, to bring the liquid to ebullition; skim it well, and at the first bubbling, remove It back. Three quarters of an hour later, add one onion, two leeks, a few carrots, and a pinch of pimento powder. One hour afterwards, wash a pound of ‘cuscus’, put it into the colander, and hang this over the stockpot, which must shut closely, thus cooking the ‘cuscus’ by the steam. For this purpose, the colander should stand a little above the liquid. Continue boiling, until the meat and hen are done ; then pass the broth, through the napkin, into the soup-tureen. Serve the ‘cuscus’ in a deep dish, and the meats at the same time on another dish, surrounding them with the vegetables. As a variety, the ‘cuscus’ may be seasoned to a ‘risoto’, with butter, gravy, and grated par- mesan. The ‘cuscus’ is eaten, partly with the soup, and partly with the meats. 25. Solferino soup. — Prepare four quarts of clear broth, such as described for a ‘croûte-au-pot’ ; and keep it in ebullition on the corner of the fixe ; ten mi-12 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. mîtes afterwards, add four or five dozen small balls of potato, cut with the aid of a round vegetable-spoon; then the same of carrots cut with a channeled vegetable- spoon of an oval shape. These vegetables must be previously blanched. Add as well two handfuls of 'flageolets haricots’ likewise blanched; two handfuls of frencli- beans cut in lozenges, and the same of fresh green-peas. As soon as these vegetables are done, mix into the soup a pinch of sugar, seven or eight tablespoonfuls of toinata-'purée’, of a nice red color, and slightly thickened. Skim the fat off the soup, pour it into the tureen, on the bottom of which are placed previously two dozen very small onions glazed with broth; add a 'pluche’ composed of leaves of parsley and chervil, and chiseled tender leaves of celery. Send up separately a plate of fried bread-'croûtons’. 26. Andalusian soup. — Keep in ebullition, on the corner of the fire, three or four quarts of stock for thick soup, prepared with clarified fish-broth. Put into a kitchen-basin four or five tablespoonfuls of Soubise-purée, which dilute with the yolk of four raw eggs. Put into another basin six ounces of whiting or pike ‘quenelle’ force-meat; which work with a spoon, introducing into it five or six tablespoonfuls of bright red tomata- purée, as well as a pinch of mild Spanish pepper. With this force-meat mould little 'quenelles’, let them poach, drain them, and put them into the soup-tureen; skim the fat off the soup, which then thicken with the 'Soubise’ preparation; pour it into the tureen, passing it through a sieve. Serve separately ten poached eggs. 27. Elder-berry soup. — Put into a stewpan about a quart of elder-berries, with two glasses of water, and two glasses of red wine ; boil it on a moderate fire, and pass it through a sieve. Melt, in a stewpan, six ounces of butter, mix with it two tablespoonfuls of flour, so as to form a light paste, which fry for a few minutes, without allowing to take color; then dilute it with the purée of elder-berry; stir the liquid till boiling, and then remove it back. Now add a glass of red wine, a little sugar, a little lemon-peel, and cinnamon. A quarter of an hour after, pass the soup through a tammy {étamine), and serve it with a plate of bread-'eroûtons’ fried in butter. 28. Holstein SOUp. — Melt five ounces of butter in a stewpan; when quite hot, mix in three handfuls of fine pearl-barley, and fry it a few minutes, stirring it; afterwards moisten it, by degrees, with a quart and a half of warm water; add salt, and stir the soup till boiling ; two seconds after, cover the stewpan, and remove it back, to let the soup simmer gently. Put in two handfuls of fresh morels, and keep it thus, for an hour, adding from time to time, a little light veal broth ; season with a little salt, and a piece of sugar. When the barley is done, work it for a fewSOUPS. 13 minutes with a spoon, to bruise it, then moisten with two quarts of good white broth; bring the soup to ebullition, and thicken it with a liaison of four yolks of egg, mixed with a little cream ; pour it into a soup-tureen, containing a small garnish of spruce asparagus, blanched cauliflowers, and the body-shell of some crayfish, stuffed with bread-crumb mixed with butter, eggs, and parsley. Pour the soup over the garnishes. 29. Cold plum-soup, German fashion. — Plunge a few dozen black plums (‘quetschen’) in boiling water, peel, and lay them successively in a stewpan; moisten with a little water, as well as with a little white wine ; add two table- spoonfuls of sugar, and a bit of lemon-zest; boil till they become a puree; pass them, as well as the liquid, through a sieve. Pour this preparation into the tureen ; when it is nearly cooled, keep it on the ice, add three or four dozen fine black plums cut in two, peeled, slightly boiled in a light syrup, and mixed with a little white wine. The soup having well cooled, serve it together with a plate of ‘zwieback’, or simply with a plate of slices of bread fried. 30. Cherry-soup, German fashion. — This soup, without being of great distinction, yet enjoys a great popularity in Germany. Pick and stone three quarters of a pound of acid, freshly gathered cherries ; put two thirds of them into an earthen pot, or else into an untinned stewpan, as tin would injure the color of the fruit; moisten with a quart of hot water, add a small stick of cinnamon, and a little lemon-zest; set the stewpan on a brisk fire, and let the cherries boil for ten minutes: then thicken the liquid with two tablespoonfuls of potato-flour, diluted with a little cold water; ten minutes after, pass the liquid, as well as the cherries, through a sieve; pour the soup back into the same stewpan; now mix in the cherries formerly put aside, as well as a little sugar ; let the soup boil up, then remove it back to the side of the fire. On the other hand, pound two handfuls of cherry-stones (noyaux)-, put them into a sugar-pan, together with two or three glasses of .claret; let the liquid boil up a while, then take it off the fire. A few minutes after, pass it through a napkin, and add it to the soup; which pour into the tureen. Serve separately a plate of finger-biscuits, cut in small dice. 31. Beer-soup, Berlin fashion. — Melt a quarter of a pound of butter in a stewpan; mix a quarter of a pound of flour, so as to form a light ‘roux’; fry this for a few minutes, stirring it, yet without allowing it to take color. This done, dilute with three quarts of light white or brown beer; stir the liquid on the fire, until boiling ; then remove it back to the side of the fire, and let it clarify for twenty-five minutes. Pour into a little stewpan, half a glassful of rum, with the same of white wine;COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 14 add to it a piece of ginger sliced, a small stick of cinnamon, three ounces of sugar, and the zest of a lemon ; cover up, and keep the stewpan in the ‘bain-marie’. The soup being well skimmed from its fat, thicken with a liaison of fifteen yolks of eggs, diluted; stir it over the fire, without allowing it to boil up, or even get too hot ; pass it through a sieve into another stewpan, mix in a quarter of a pound of butter divided in little bits, add then the infusion of rum, pass it through a sieve, and pour it into the soup-tureen. Serve separately some slices of bread fried. 32. Pacha Soup. —- Prepare a small ‘pot-au-feu’, with half a leg of mutton, a knuckle of veal, and a hen (without its fillets); when these meats are done, strain the broth, skim off its fat, and pour two quarts of it into a stewpan; let it boil, and thicken it with four or five tablespoonfuls of diluted rice-flour. At the first bubbling, draw the stewpan on the side of the fire. Meanwhile, chop the same quantity of lean mutton meat; add thereto the same volume of chopped bacon, and raw ham, half of each; season the hash, and mix in a pinch of parsley, and five ounces of blanched rice; divide the preparation into small parts, each of which is wrapped up in a small tender, blanched cabbage-leaf, thus forming small dolmas. Truss, and range them in a flat stewpan, moisten to height with fat broth, and braise them on a moderate fire, with hot ashes on the lid. When ready to serve, skim the soup, finish with a piece of butter, kneaded with curry-powder; pour it into the soup-tureen, and plunge in the ‘dolmas’, well drained, and untied. 33. Brunoise soup, with quenelles. — This soup, like the ‘julienne’, is a spring or early summer soup, and should be served only when the vegetables are tender and savory. Cut into small dice the red part of a few tender carrots, a middling-sized turnip, a piece of celery, two or three new onions, and a leek. Put the onions and leek into a stewpan with butter, to fry without coloring them; add the other vegetables, a little salt, and a pinch of sugar; after a few minutes, moisten with a little broth, cover the stewpan, and reduce the moisture to a glaze; then pour over the vegetables two or three quarts of good broth, free of fat, and strained through a napkin. After twenty minutes of ebullition, the vegetables must be done; then add two handfuls of green-peas, boiled in water. Two minutes afterwards, pour the soup into a tureen, introduce into it two dozen small ‘quenelles’ of fowl, moulded with a spoon, and poached at the time in salted water. 34. Barley-soup, with celery. — Melt six ounces of butter ill a stew- pan, and mix with it half a pound of German* pearl-barley; fry it a few minutes, and '* The German barley is unquestionably the best that can be found; its seeds are small, white, and without the least flavor of dust.15 SOUPS. moisten with two or three quarts of white broth, or hot water; stir the soup until boiling, salt it sufficiently, boil it quite gently for two hours; then introduce into it seven or eight tablespoonfuls of celery-roots, cut into small dice, and blanched. Half an hour after, thicken the soup with the yolk of four eggs, diluted with half a glass of good raw cream; cook the preparation, without allowing it to boil ; in- troduce four ounces of butter in small bits ; and pour it at once into the soup-tureen. 35. Cockileeky, or Scottish leek-soup. — Wash a knuckle of veal, put it into an earthen stockpot, with a ham-bone in pieces, and a hen with its giblets well cleansed;*moisten these meats with four or five quarts of water, set the stockpot on the fire, skim the liquid, and at the first bubbling remove it back; add to it one onion, a piece of celery-root, one carrot, one turnip, and a few cloves. When the meats are done, pass the broth into a stewpan, skim off its fat, put the liquid once more on the fire, throw into it the white part of seven or eight leeks, split in two, and cut transversally in pieces half an inch long ; and boil them gently. If the leeks are not tender, they should be previously blanched for a few minutes. When about to serve, cut the breast of the hen in scollops, mix them with the soup, which pour into the tureen. Serve separately some thin slices of toasted bread. 36. Cabbage-SOup, Savoy fashion. — Prepare two quarts of potato- purée soup ; keep it boiling at the corner of the stove-fire. Mince one or two savoy cabbages, fry in butter a small chopped onion, to which add the minced cabbage ; fry them together on a moderate fire, until done ; season them, thicken with two tablespoonfuls of good ‘béchamel’-sauce ; the preparation having cooled, add two handfuls of grated parmesan. With some nouille-paste rolled out very thin, and with the savoy-preparation, now make some ‘ravioles’ of a round shape. A few minutes previous to serving, plunge these havioles’ in boiling salted water; three minutes after, drain them, and place them in the soup-tureen. Skim the fat off the soup, and then thicken with a liaison of four or five yolks of eggs, mixed with a little nutmeg, a handful of parmesan, and four ounces of fresh butter; pass the soup through a fine colander into the soup-tureen. 37. Onion-soup. — Slice five or six large white and mild onions, put them into a stewpan with butter, a little salt, and a pinch of sugar ; set the stewpan on a very gentle fire, and let them take while turning a nice color; shake over them a little flour, and moisten with a quart and a half of boiling water ; add to it a few sprigs of parsley, with a bay-leaf, and some salt ; boil the liquid quickly for ten minutes. Lay meanwhile in the soup-tureen some toasted slices of white bread, and dredge over a little fine pepper. When about to serve, thicken the soup with a liaison of16 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. six yolks of eggs ; cook the whole together, without allowing the soup to boil ; finish with a piece of butter in small bits, and pour it into the tureen, after having removed the aromatics. 38. Onion-soup, Paris fashion. — Mince four Portugal onions, being white and mild; fry them in a stewpan with butter, on a moderate fire, turning them; add a pinch of sugar, fry them, giving them a nice gold color; moisten with about two quarts of warm ‘consommé’ ; add to it a little bunch of parsley, garnished with a bay-leaf ; let the liquid boil for eight minutes. Cut some thin slices of white bread, broil them, put them into the soup- tureen, ranging them in layers, over each of which sprinkle a pinch of fine pepper; pour the soup on the bread, and serve it up. This soup gives an excellent result ; but the ‘consommé’ of course may be replaced by plain broth, or even by boiling water. If operating with water, it will be well to sprinkle over the fried onions a little pinch of salt ; this must be-donc previous to moistening them. If this be the case, the soup may be thickened, at the last moment, with yolks of egg, diluted with a little good raw cream. 39. Pumpion-soup ‘au gratin’. — Slice a dozen long pumpions (cour- gerons), put them into a flat stewpan with butter ; season, and fry until their moisture be reduced. Cover the bottom of a deep dish with a dozen slices of bread, which soak with toppings of broth ; sprinkle over some grated parmesan, and on the top range the pumpions in layers, alternately with grated parmesan; cover the top-layer with a row of slices of bread, which baste likewise with toppings, and cover with grated parmesan. Now keep the dish in the oven, for a quarter of an hour, to graduate the preparation, basting it at times with toppings. When ready to serve, pour into the soup-tureen a good ‘pot-au-feu broth, and send -up separately the graduated pumpions. 40. Rice-soup, with milk of almonds. — Scald, and blanch, two hand- fuls of almonds; pound them in a mortar: take them out, and plunge them into a quart of boiling milk; cover the stewpan, and put this infusion by. Cleanse and wash, in several waters, ten ounces of rice ; which put into a stewpan, with two quarts of cold water, and a little salt; set the stewpan on the fire, stirring the rice frequently, till boiling; then remove it back. When the rice is about done, dilute it with a quart of boiling milk ; continue boiling it for a quarter of an hour more ; season the soup well, and add to it the infusion of milk of almonds (pre- viously passed through a sieve) ; thicken with a liaison of four yolks of egg, diluted with a gill of cream ; finish the soup with four ounces of butter divided in small bits, and. a pinch of powder-sugar ; and pour it into the soup-tureen.17 SOUPS. 41. Rice-and-cabbage soup, Milan fashion. — Slice the heart of a savoy-cabbage, put it into a stewpan, moisten with two quarts of broth, and place it on a sharp fire; ten minutes after, introduce into it ten ounces of Piémont-rice, continue boiling it for a quarter of an hour, then mix with the soup a handful of grated parmesan, as well as six ounces of fresh fat bacon, chopped with a little sage. Boil the soup for five or six minutes more ; pour it into the tureen. This soup, although so simple, is nevertheless good, and in great favor among the Italians. It should be of a nice consistence, and the rice not over-done. 42. Farmer’s soup. — Peel two onions, one leek, the half of a winter- cabbage, two carrots, a middling-sized turnip, a root of celery, two lettuces, one handful of french-beans, fresh haricots or ‘flageolets’-beans', and four potatoes. Mince the onion and leek, to be fried with chopped and melted bacon ; when of a light brown color, add the other vegetables (also minced) leaving only the potatoes ; boil them until their moisture be reduced ; add a pound of raw ham blanched, and moisten them with broth. After twenty-five minutes’ boiling, introduce the minced potatoes ; when these vegetables are nearly done, add to the soup a handful of shred sorrel, and two lettuces, also shred. At last, finish the soup with a pinch of chopped chervil ; take out the ham, and pour the soup into a tureen, containing some slices of toasted bread. 43. Gratinated cabbage-soup. — Prepare first a small ‘pot-au-feu’ broth, according to the usual method. When the meat is half-done, divide two small green cabbages, each of them into four parts, wash and plunge them into boiling salted water, to blanch foi‘ a quarter of an hour ; drain, refresh them in cold water, and then press all the water out. Mask the bottom of a flat stewpan with trimmings of fat bacon, a slice of raw ham, and some sliced carrot and onions ; range the quartered cabbages on those vegetables, salt them slightly, and moisten, so as just to cover them with fat broth, in order to braise. When done, drain them on a sieve to extract their fat, without pressing them ; carefully remove the stalks, cut each quarter in two or three pieces; which put gradually into a kitchen-basin, to be mixed gently with a spoon, and sprinkled with grated parmesan. Now spread a layer of slices of bread on the bottom of a deep dish, that will bear to be pushed into the oven ; and on this bread, place a layer of cabbage ; continue thus, with alternated layers of bread and cabbage, taking care to baste each layer with fat broth. Shake over the whole a handful of grated parmesan, and keep the dish, for twenty minutes, in a slow oven. Serve the broth separately in the soup-tureen, and the gratinated cabbages on the dish.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 18 44. Menestrone, Milan fashion. — Chop six or eight ounces of bacon, put it into a stewpan with a piece of raw ham, a savoy-cabbage shred large, and two or three handfuls of fresh haricot-beans, either white or green ; moisten all these vegetables with three quarts of broth, and place the stewpan on a brisk fire. After ten minutes of ebullition, add to the liquid four tablespoonfuls of tender celery-roots, cut into small dice, the same of cltou-rave, and again the same of fresh haricot-beans cut in pieces (tronçons). Eight or ten minutes after, add two handfuls of fresh broad-beans, the same of green-peas and asparagus-heads, a chopped tomata, twelve or fourteen ounces of Piémont-rice (not washed), as well as two or three smoked Milan sausages. Continue boiling, until the rice be done. Twelve or fourteen minutes will do.

Young-carrot soup. — Choose three or four dozen small, young carrots of an equal size ; scrape them slightly, and blanch for five or six minutes ; after which drain, and place them in a stewpan with a piece of butter, a little salt, and a pinch of sugar ; moisten with a sufficient quantity of broth to cover, and set it to boil ; when the broth is reduced to a glaze, the carrots should be done; plunge them at once into three quarts of clear, good ‘pot-au-feu’ broth, introduce into the liquid a small leaf of chervil, and pour the soup into the tureen. 46. Lettuce-soup.— Prepare four quarts of broth, following the process prescribed for the ‘croûte-au-pot’ : when it is passed through a sieve, and its fat is skimmed, keep it warm in a stewpan. Blanch a dozen good cabbage-lettuces, refresh them in cold water ; press them between the hands (one by one) to extract all the water ; place them in a sauté-pan, garnished at the bottom, with thin slices of bacon and slices of ham ; moisten with a sufficient quantity of broth to cover them, and braise in the usual way. Drain them afterwards, cut them transversally, each into three parts, and place them in a soup-tureen with toasted slices of bread ; pour the broth over them. 47. Water-cress soup. — Prepare a light brown Toux’ with four ounces of butter and the same of flour ; dilute it with good broth, so as to obtain a stock not too thick ; stir it on the fire, until boiling ; then remove it back ; and allow for clarifying (dépouiller) twenty-five minutes, skimming carefully. Pick two handfuls of water-cress, from the spring, blanch them in salted water ; drain, and press out the moisture; put them into a mortar, with a piece of butter, and pound them ; add to this three yolks of eggs, and pass it through a sieve.SOUPS. 19 When ready to serve, introduce this purée into the liquid, cook the liaison, without letting it boil ; and pour the soup into a tureen* 48. Grand-Duke soup. — Put into a stewpan four ounces of butter ; when melted, add two tablespoonfuls of flour ; which fry for a few minutes, without allowing it to take color ; then dilute it with three quarts of broth, add some trimmings of raw ham, and a bunch of parsley; stir the liquid until boiling, after which remove the stewpan back. Cut, of an equal length, the heads of a few handfuls of middling-sized white asparagus, and set them on one side; break off the tender parts of the stalks, cut them in small pieces, and plunge them into the boiling soup with two handfuls of washed rice; continue the ebullition. Three quarters of an hour later, pass the soup through a sieve into a stewpan, but without passing the rice, or the asparagus. Boil the soup, skim off its fat; thicken it with three yolks of eggs, mijced with a good handful of grated parmesan, and diluted with a little cream; pour it into the soup-tureen, and introduce into it the heads of asparagus boiled in salted water, and eight or ten eggs poached in broth. 49. Health soup. — Trim, wash, and shred, four lettuces, half that quantity of beet-leaves, two handfuls of sorrel leaves, one of chervil, and as much of tender leaves of celery. Slice two leeks, and one onion, put them into a stewpan, and fry with butter ; two minutes after, add the leaves of lettuce, beet, and celery ; which fry for ten minutes; and, at last, add the sorrel and chervil: moisten the whole with two quarts of broth, prepared in the conditions prescribed in No. 5. After ten minutes’ boiling, remove the stewpan off the fire, skim the fat, introduce into the soup thin slices of bread, and pour it into the soup-tureen. 50. Cheese-SOUp. — Chop a large white onion, put it into a stewpan with some butter, fry it quite gently, until of a nice color ; then moisten with two quarts of broth, add a bunch of parsley mixed with a little chervil, and a bay-leaf. Let the broth boil for ten minutes, mix in a few tablespoonfuls of good gravy, in order to give it a nice color, and remove it on to the side of the fire. Cut up some thin slices of white bread, which toast slightly, arrange in a soup- tureen, by layers, sprinkling with pepper, grated parmesan, and also with fresh gruvere cheese, cut up in thin squares or small dice; pour the soup into the tureen. 51. Mille-fanti soup. — This soup is highly esteemed and often served in all the states of Italy. Put into à kitchen-basin three handfuls of grated fresh bread-crumb, to which add three parts of its volume of parmesan, likewise fresh and grated ; dilute the preparation with four whole eggs, season with a little nutmeg, pour it into two 2*20 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. quarts of good clarified broth, kept boiling ; whisk the broth for two minutes : at the first bubbling remove it back. A quarter of an hour after, stir the soup with the whisk, and pour it into the tureen. 52. Macaroni-soup, with cream. — Put into a small stockpot a hen and a knuckle of veal, a little salt, about four or five quarts of water ; set the stockpot on the fire, skim the liquid, and when beginning to boil, remove it back ; add to it one carrot, one onion, one leek, arid a root of celery; four hours after, pass the broth through a napkin, and skim its fat. Melt six ounces of butter into a stewpan, mix into it two tablespoonfuls of flour, to form a light 'roux’ ; fry it on the fire for a few minutes, then dilute with the broth; stir the liquid with a spoon till boiling, then remove it back ; twenty-five minutes later, pass the soup through a sieve. Boil in salted water half a pound of large macaroni ; when done, drain, and cut it into pieces one inch long, which plunge into the soup. Place five yolks of eggs in a kitchen-basin ;* add a good handful of grated parmesan, and dilute them with a gill of cream ; mix this preparation in the soup, with a piece of butter; cook the mixture, without letting the soup boil, and serve it up in the tureen. 53. Ravioles-soup, Genoa fashion. — With seven or eight eggs prepare a nouille-paste for Yavioles’, divide it into four equal parts; which roll out, one by one, in very thin square flats ; slightly moisten the surface of one of these flats ; then, with some Yaviole’ force-meat, put into a bag, squeeze it through, in form of little balls, in straight lines an inch distant from one another : as soon as this flat is thus masked, cover it, as well as the force-meat, with a flat of paste like the first one, then press it on, in the free space, first with the hand, then with the back of a little round paste-cutter, in this manner marking the 'ravioles’ ; which now cut with the paste-cutter, of about an inch and a half diameter ; immediately place them, one by one, on a floured cloth. This done, roll out the two remaining parts of the paste, and repeat the same operation. Cover the Yavioles’ with a cloth.

Serve separately a plate of grated parmesan. 55. Andalusia vermicelli-soup. — Get ready three quarts of fish-stock for thick soup, start it to ebullition, then remove it to the corner of the tire, and thus let it clarify for half an hour. This done, skim off its fat, mix in the liquid five or six gills of fresh tomata-purée, a bunch of parsley with aromatics. Twenty minutes afterwards, pass it through a tammy. Mix in the soup half a pound of vermicelli boiled in salt water, let the liquid boil, skim its fat, and pour it into the soup- tureen. 56. Macaroni, Calabrian fashion. — Remove the skin and seeds of eight fine tomatas from the South, cut them in pieces, and let them drain on a cloth. Chop up an onion ; which fry, to a nice gold color, in a stewpan ; add to it six ounces of lean raw ham, cut in dice; a bunch of parsley garnished with aromatics, and peppercorns ; two minutes afterwards, add the tomatas. As soon as these tomatas have reduced all their moisture, pour over a little good glaze, melted, and a little reduced good brown-sauce ; boil them for a few minutes, and pass them through a sieve. Boil eighteen or twenty ounces of Naples macaroni in salted water ; as soon as it is done, drain it, pour it into a sauté-pan, and mix it up with six ounces of butter, divided in small bits ; introduce the butter, rolling the stewpan over on itself, off the fire ; finish the macaroni with a pinch of pepper, dress it then in a large silver-stewpan or deep dish, by layers, sprinkling over each layer a handful of grated parmesan ; but take care to pour over each of the layers a little of the sauce previously prepared. Sprinkle over the top of the macaroni, some parmesan, and baste with brown clarified butter ; serve separately a tureen of consommé. 57. Cappelletti-soup, Bologna fashion.— Prepare a pot-au-feu broth with two pounds of beef, a pound of fresh pork, a bone of raw ham, a fowl, some pot-herbs, salt and water. In this broth boil a calf’s udder (tetine). Prepare a ‘nouille’-paste with twelve ounces of Hour, a pinch of salt, butter the size of a walnut, five or six whole eggs, a few tablespoonfuls of warm water, and a pinch of saffron. As soon as the paste is made, wrap it up in a cloth, and keep it from the air, under a basin turned over.22 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. The fowl being done and cooled, take out the meat from the breast; pound it with half its volume of calf’s udder cold, a piece of beef-marrow, and the quarter of a boiled calf’s brain ; when the force-meat is of a due consistence, add to it a handful of scraped parmesan, and two yolks of eggs ; then remove it back, put it into a soup- tureen, and mix in it some chopped parsley, and a little nutmeg. Now divide the paste into two equal parts; and, with the aid of a rolling-pin, roll out the one half into a very thin flat ; which divide again into squares, two inches in diameter, of rather oblong form, that is, into lozenges ; one must have at hand a small paste-brush, dipped in a glass of water, and a cornet of strong paper tilled with a part of the force-meat. Put on the centre of each lozenge a small ball of force-meat, squeezed through the cornet ; moisten the paste slightly, on one side only, and turn it up, over the edges of its longer side, so as to form a sort of triangle. Press the paste with the hands, just sufficiently to solder it; and now let the two extremities of the triangle join, by bending them round with the fingers. Solder together these two tips of the triangle, and turn them over, so as to give the piece the shape of a Tittle hat’ (cappdletto). This is an operation, the success of which is certain after only one trial. Then do the same with the other half. Place the ‘cappelletti’ on a sheet of paper, cover them with a cloth. Twelve or fifteen minutes previous to serving, let the broth boil up, and plunge into it the ‘cappelletti’, which boil for live or six minutes ; remove the stewpan back, and keep it covered for a few moments, before pouring the soup into the tureen ; serve up separately a plate of grated parmesan. 58.

Meanwhile, boil separately half a quart of green haricot-beans (flageolets), or it not handy, some white haricot beans. Blanch and braise ten or twelve cabbage-lettuces. A quarter of an hour previous to serving, prepare some slices of bread, place them in the soup-tureen. Take the vegetables out of the stockpot, take the half ot every kind, and cut in pieces, which place over the toast with a third of the ‘flageolets'. Pass the broth through a sieve, skim off its fat, and pour it, in parts, or all at a time, into the tureen. Drain the meats of the stockpot: beef, mutton, pork, fowl, duck, bacon, and ham; range them on to an oblong dish, surround them with the vegetables kept by, as well as with the beans, and lettuces.

Hodge-podge; i. e. Scottish ‘hoche-pot’. — This soup is of Scottish origin and composition ; even if the name be French. It is but rarely served in England ; but with the Scots it bears the character of a national dish. This soup is only to be prepared in summer, that is, beginning from the month of June, this being the time, when fresh vegetables make their appearance in Scotland. Put into a stockpot two to three pounds of boned beef, and half a boned* shoulder of mutton. Moisten with live quarts of cold water, add a pinch of salt, set the stockpot on the Are, skim the liquid ; at the first bubbling, remove it back. After one hour and a half, take of all the fresh vegetables that the season offers; such as cabbage, lettuce, celery, onion, leek, carrot, turnip, and green - peas ; the last three being particularly requisite. In countries producing spruce-asparagus, these may be added ; but in Scotland there are none. Cut up in small dice, the cabbage, lettuce, leek, celery, onion, carrot, and turnip; which vegetables add to the broth, beginning by those taking more time, and adding last the most tender ones: the heads of asparagus, and peas, are put in last of all. When ready to serve, drain the meats of the stockpot, pour the soup into a tureen, without mixing with it, either the cooked meat, or the chopped parsley, or the barley. In Scotland the cooks sometimes thicken the broth with a pinch of arrowroot diluted, but this method is not generally adopted. 124.

Let the broth boil quickly for twelve or fifteen minutes, but so that, the fish done, the liquid be reduced to a quarter of its previous volume; then pour it into the soup-tureen, take out the pieces of fish, and lobster, with a skimmer; choose the best of them, divide them, to remove their bones, and add them to the broth. Take out the sweet herbs, and slices of lemon ; add the leeks to the soup, and send up separately a plate of thin slices of bread toasted. 140. Eel-pout soup. — The eel-pouts are of a very good quality in Poland and Russia ; but what renders them still more estimable, is, their remarkably fine livers, unknown to our Western markets. Select two fine eel-pouts, the belly of which is swollen by the bigness of their liver; which take out, cleanse carefully, and steep in water, then blanch for five minutes in acidulated boiling water. Cut transversally the body of the eel-pouts, sprinkle the pieces with a handful of salt, and let them macerate in a kitchen-basin for one hour.

Place the broth again on the fire, and whisk it until boiling; then remove it back ; two minutes after, pass it through a napkin, and keep it hot. Shred into ‘julienne’ a bit of celery-root, two parsley-roots, and one leek; put them into a stewpan with a piece of butter ; fry, without letting them take color ; when the vegetables have reduced their own humidity, moisten them with a little broth, and reduce this to glaze ; repeat the same operation, till the vegetables are done ; then mix them with the soup.51 SOUPS. A quarter of an hour before serving, wash the eel-pout pieces, wipe them dry in a cloth, plunge them into the soup ; let this boil, and then remove it back to simmer for ten or twelve minutes: drain the eel-pout livers, wipe them, cut them in thin slices, lay them in the tureen, and pour the soup over. Send up separately a plate of lemons cut in halves. 141.

Thicken the broth with six yolks of eggs, diluted with some cold broth ; add a pinch of cayenne, four ounces of butter in little bits, and pour the soup into the tureen containing the vegetables, pieces of eel, and some thin slices of toasted bread. 142. ‘Vongoli’ soup. — This soup originates from Naples: “vongoli’ soup and “pizza’ being at Naples the dishes preferred for suppers taken at the sea-side. Put into a stewpan ftmr dozen “vongoli’, that is, small sea-“clovisses’, which bear a great resemblance to those eaten at Marseille; moisten with three quarters of a bottle of white wine, and toss them up on the fire until opened ; drain them in a colander, preserving their liquor ; and remove half the shells. Chop a small onion, and a piece of white of leek ; put them into a stewpan with a little good oil; fry them, moisten with the liquor of the ‘clovisses’, and a quart of fish-hroth ; add a tomata, peeled and chopped, a bunch of marjoram (cornabuse), and a few shred green celery-leaves ; boil the whole briskly for ten minutes ; then take out the aromatics, add the “clovisses’ to the soup ; which pour into the tureen. Send up separately some small “croûtons’ of crumb of bread, fried in oil or in butter. 143. Turbot-SOUp, with curry. — Choose a small and very fresh turbot; after having removed the head, cut the body in square pieces, putting by the finest. Place in a stewpan the head and inferior parts, with some small bony fish, or a piece ofCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERT. 52 conger-eel. Moisten with two quarts of water and a bottle of white wine ; add a few sprigs of parsley, and set the stewpan on a sharp tire, to boil the whole briskly for twenty-five minutes ; pass then the broth through a sieve. Further, slice a large onion and a leek, fry them in butter, add to them the square pieces of turhot well drained ; salt slightly and fry them for a few minutes, sprinkle them with two tablespoonfuls of flour, and the same of curry-powder, toss them up for a while, and moisten gradually with the prepared broth. Stir the liquid until boiling, then remove the stewpan back on a moderate fire ; fifteen minutes later, take the fish out with a skimmer, remove the bones and black skin, lessening the thickness of the pieces ; place them in the soup-tureen. Thicken the soup with four yolks of eggs, diluted with cream ; pass it through a sieve, finish with a piece of butter, and pour it into the soup-tureen. 144. Uka ( K)xa)-S0up. — The ‘uka’ (ioukha) is the national soup of the Russ ‘gourmets’ ; it is prepared with live little sterlets, killed and immediately cooked. This fish does not exist in England, nor in the other countries of western Europe ; therefore it is impossible to serve this soup in the same conditions as in Russia. But if no sterlet is to be had, the ‘uka’ may be prepared with good trout of a middling size, living in clear and abundant waters. An indispensable condition is, that the fish be killed at the moment when wanted. Prepare two quarts of good fish-broth, according to the method prescribed in the preceding article, with perch and tench. Cut in ‘julienne’ the roots of parsley and celery, let them blanch slightly, drain them well, let them fry with butter for ten minutes on a very mild fire ; drain the butter off them, and reduce to glaze with a little ‘consommé’. Prepare two dozen little whiting ‘quenelles’ with crayfish-butter. Take the fish-broth, drained of its fat, and passed through a sieve : it must be nearly cooled. Chop a pound of raw whiting or pike flesh, add to it a handful of whitebait, or any other very fresh little fish; moreover add a whole egg, a glassful of good white wine, and two tablespoonfuls of madeira. Mix this preparation up with the broth, in order to clarify it, proceeding just as for a ‘consommé’: this operation must be done, but a little while previous to serving-time. On the other hand, take two or three middling-sized trout alive, very fat, and of fine red flesh. Kill the fish, remove their heads, as well as the thin parts of the tails ; then divide the body in thick pieces ; carefully cleanse these pieces of fish, spunge them well on a cloth. The fish-‘consommé’ passed through a sieve, put part of it into a flat stewpan, add a gill of champagne, let it boil, then plunge the pieces of trout into the liquid. At53 SOUPS. the first bubbling take the stewpan off the fire, covering it. Five or six minutes after, drain the pieces of fish, split them in two, in order to remove the bone ; nicely pare the pieces, place them on a deep dish, cover them with part of the cooking-stock, well drained of fat, and passed through a sieve. Mix the root-'julienne’ up with the 'consommé’, add the little ‘quenelles’ poached at the same moment, pour it into the tureen. Serve separately the pieces of trout, which are only mixed into the soup on the plates themselves, when presented to the guests. 145. Uka soup, German fashion. — Cut in thick pieces two small tench, two perch, and two small eels ; with the heads and bones of these fish, water, wine, vegetables, and spice, prepare two quarts of good broth. Blanch, in white wine, three or four dozen oysters, drain and trim them, to be kept on one side, preserving their liquor. Mince, fry in butter a carrot, an onion, and a piece of celery-root ; moisten these vegetables with the previously prepared broth, and a little wine; season, add the pieces of fish, and let them boil on a moderate fire ; this done, pass the broth through a fine sieve, and skim its fat, preserving the pieces of fish. With three ounces of butter and two tablespoonfuls of flour, prepare a light ‘roux’ without allowing it to take color ; dilute it with the previously prepared fish- broth. Stir the liquid over the fire until boiling, then remove the stewpan to the side of the fire. Twenty-five minutes afterwards, carefully skim the fat off the soup, pass it through a sieve into another stewpan ; add to it a ‘julienne’ of raw mushrooms, as well as the oysters’ liquor; ten minutes afterwards, thicken the soup with four yolks of eggs, diluted with a little raw cream ; take it off the fire ; mix in the oysters, as well as the pieces of tench, perch, and eel, carefully pared, without skin and bone. Finish the soup with a pinch of cayenne, and another pinch of chopped parsley. . 146. White-bait-soup, Nizza fashion. — Shred in ‘julienne’ one onion, the white of a young leek, the red of two tender carrots, a piece of celery-root, and a few mushrooms. Fry in butter the onion and leek, but without allowing them to take color ; add the other vegetables, salt slightly, and keep on the fire until all their moisture be reduced ; then moisten with two or three quarts of good broth, let the liquid boil up, and remove it back. Twenty-five or thirty minutes later, skim the fat off the soup, and add a pound and a half of small white fish, known in Nizza (where they are very common) by the name of poutin, or ianclietti. The fish must be washed and drained, then plunged into the boiling soup ; cover the stewpan, and at once remove it back. Let the fish poach, for five or six minutes, and pour the soup into the tureen.54 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. This soup has become a favorite among the foreigners visiting Nizza. Particu- larly the Russian ‘gourmets’ make much of it; as it bears some analogy to a dish, so capitally served in their native country, to the ‘icrshis’. 147. Hamburg eel-soup. — It is particularly ill summer time, that this soup is appreciated by the people of Hamburg: the excellent small eels caught at that season at the mouth of the Elbe, also the new vegetables and fruits, evidently con- tribute mainly to its great perfection. . This soup may really be called the national soup of Hamburg. Remove the skin and jowls of a few small live eels ; divide them in slices ; which place in a stewpan with a few heads and bones offish, a bunch of parsley and aro- matics, salt, cloves, and peppercorns ; moisten plentifully with wine and water. The fish being done, pass the broth through a sieve into another stewpan ; let it boil, and introduce into it a garnish of new vegetables, of as varied a composition as pos- sible ; taking care to put them into the broth by turns, those taking longest cooking, first, and then successively the more tender ones. These vegetables are partly cut in dice ; the green peas, broad or white beans, remaining whole. These vegetables being about done, thicken the liquid slightly with a little ‘roux’, or merely with kneaded-butter ; then add to the soup a few dozen small whole pears, previously peeled and blanched, and a few small new apples cut in halves or quarters, also peeled and blanched. The vegetables and fruits being done, add to the soup the slices of eel, a pinch of sugar, a little vinegar, and a small handful of fine-herbs freshly chopped : such as parsley, taragon, burnet, chives, chervil, and marjoram. Put into the soup a garnish of small dumplings (Idocssen), made with flour or bread, and pour it into the tureen. If the pears and apples are large, cut them into little balls. ? 148. German tench-SOUp. — Mince one onion, one leek, one carrot, and a parsley-root ; fry them gently, in a stewpan, with butter ; moisten with a bottle of white wine, and three quarts of water ; add to it a few sprigs of parsley and savory, a few peppercorns and cloves ; let the liquid boil, and put in two well cleansed tench cut in pieces (tronçons). When the fish is done, drain it, and pass the broth through a sieve. Melt eight ounces of butter in a stewpan, add three tablespoonfuls of flour; fry this preparation a few minutes, without allowing it to take color, and dilute it gra- dually with the tench-broth ; stir the soup until boiling, then remove the stewpan back. Cut some raw potatoes, with a vegetable-spoon, into the shape of balls the size of a large green pea ; throw them into boiling water, giving two minutes for ebul- lition, drain them afterwards on a sieve, then add them to the soup, and finish cooking, gently.SOUPS. 55 the head off, and let the blood drain for ten or twelve hours on a inclining table. Then make an incision all round the inner or belly-shell (plastron), slipping in the blade of a sharp knife, without cutting off the fins. When the belly-shell or breastplate is off, remove all the intestines, and the green fat ot the belly, and put them by; fig. 2. When ready to serve, add to the soup four tablespoonfuls of pearl-barley, boiled separately ; add the pieces of tench, boned, skinned, and divided into small fillets ; thicken with three yolks of eggs diluted with cream ; finish it with a piece of butter, and a pinch of chopped savory. This soup deserves the attention of amateurs. 149. Turtle-soup (D. 1 and 2). — Of all the soups served in England and America, that prepared with sea-turtles is the most precious and most esteemed : now-a-days, turtle-soup is served in every part of Europe, and every where in great request with ama- teurs. The turtles, destined for cook- ing, must be chosen alive, or as near as possible newly caught. I have been enabled to remark, that the flesh of turtles, after having- lived long out of their natural ele- ment, the sea, contracts a savor of ris- *• stale or spoiled fish. If reduced to the necessity of killing a turtle this would be the way to proceed : Turn the turtle on its back, slip a running-knot round its neck, bleed it, or even cut56 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. afterwards cut off the tins, both the fore-tins or wings (ailerons), and the hind, or swimming-tins (nageoires) ; and at the same time the flesh and bones adhering to it. These pieces of flesh bear the name of ‘noix’, because they have some analogy with the ‘noix’ of veal : separate them from the bones, whether to serve them afterwards, as a remove, or an entree ; or to add them to the bones, and let them co-operate in the preparation of the turtle-soup. Then divide the upper and under shells in squares, scald them, to remove the horny substance which covers them; steep and boil them in plenty of water, but only for a few seconds. Scald also the four fins and the neck, in order to scrape them, and steep in water for one hour. When the fleshy parts on the shells are tender to the touch (which takes several hours), and when the flesh falls off easily from the bone ; drain them, to remove the bony parts ; put the whole into a kitchen-basin, and cover it with some of its broth passed through a sieve. Put into a stockpot the bones from the basin ; without cutting them, add the fleshy parts and the fins of the turtle, and a knuckle of beef; moisten largely with the broth in which the shells have been cooked, some common broth, and a few bottles of white wine; let the liquid boil, skim, and then remove the stockpot back to be garnished. Proceed exactly, as for a ‘pot-au-feu’. When all the fins are done, drain, bone, place them in a kitchen-basin, and cover with broth, skim the fat from the turtle stockpot ; which pass through a sieve, and allow to settle. To prepare the turtle-soup, one should proceed as follows: for eight or ten persons, set to ebullition two or three quarts of turtle-broth, which keep hot. Cut up into joints two middling-sized chickens; put them into a stewpan with their backs, pinions, leg-bones, and gizzards ; and with ten or twelve ounces of raw ham in large dice ; fry these meats with butter, on a good fire, until highly colored, then sprinkle over two tablespoonfuls of arrowroot. Two minutes after, moisten with the turtle- broth, and a glass of white wine; stir the liquid until boiling, then remove it back, and add to it a few sprigs of sweet herbs (aromates), and two onions. When the chickens are done, skim the fat from the cooking-stock, pass it into another stewpan, add to it a few pieces of the glutinous meat of the shells, and as much of the fins, both alike previously cut up in small squares. Let the soup boil, and pour in a glass of sherry ; if it be too thick, dilute it with some turtle - broth. It should be of a slight consistence. Twenty-five minutes after, skim off its fat again, throw in a little pinch of cayenne, and add to it some pieces of the green fat, blanched, and cut up in small pieces. When about to serve, add to the soup an infusion prepared with two gills of sherry, a pinch of marjoram, one of basil, one of savory, one of thyme, a sprig of sage, and a sprig of chives ; not one of these flavors should predominate, and the wine57 SOUPS. must be reduced to a third: if the herbs are fresh, pound them, when cooked, and mix them with the soup; if dry, simply pass the infusion through a cloth into the soup, but at the last moment. With this soup must he served milk-punch in glasses. 150. Tench-soup, Polish fashion. — Put about a pound of pearl-barley into a small stewpan, with a piece of butter, and a quart of water ; place the stewpan on a moderate fire, and let the liquid boil gently for one hour, adding from time to time a little boiling water. Mince one onion and one leek, fry them slightly in butter, add two or three middling-sized tench cut up ; fry them a few minutes, and moisten with three quarts of boiling water ; add a few sliced parsley-and celery-roots, and a bunch of parsley ; boil the fish for twenty-five minutes ; then strain the broth ; take out the pieces of tench, which divide in small fillets, having first boned them ; keep them warm and covered. When the barley is done, draw it off the fire, and work with a spoon until forming a very white and soft paste; dilute it, by degrees, with the fish - broth ; boil the soup, thicken it with yolks of eggs diluted with cream, and pour it into a tureen containing the fillets of tench. 151. Sturgeon roçolnic soup. — Cut a piece of fresh sturgeon; season, blanch, and put it into a basin, to macerate a few hours, with white wine and sliced vegetables; tie it up, afterwards truss; place it in a stewpan, masked with bacon, ham, and vegetables; braise it, and let it cool in its stock, which pass afterwards through a sieve, and skim off its fat. Now fry in butter one chopped onion; when nicely colored, add to it two tablespoonfuls of flour, which fry a few minutes, and dilute with three quarts of broth, and the stock of the fish ; stir the liquid on the fire until boiling, then remove it back. One hour later, skim the fat from the soup, which pass through a sieve into another stewpan. Meanwhile, cut some parsley-roots in small fillets about half an inch long, making at both ends a small incision crosswise, and boil them in salted water. Peel some salted cucumbers (ogursis), cut in two to remove the centre, pare them into lozenges, of the same length as the parsley-roots; blanch them in a sugar-pan with Mater, and mix them with the parsley-roots. When ready to serve, add to the soup the parsley-roots, ‘ogursis’, and a glass of ‘ogursi’-juice ; boil the liquid for five minutes, add the sturgeon, neatly cut in small scollops, and thicken the soup with a gill of sour-cream ; finish it with a pinch of chopped parsley, or green fennel, and serve.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 58 152. Clam-cllOUder soup. — The ‘clam-chouder’ is an American shell - fish. Open four or five dozen clams, chop their flesh, put it into a deep and thickly buttered stewpan, add six onions blanched and minced, a dozen raw potatoes, peeled and cut in dice, a bunch of aromatics, a little salt, pepper, nutmeg, cayenne, and mace; moisten the whole with a sufficient quantity of wine and fish-broth, to cover. Set the stewpan on a brisk fire, let the liquid boil for twenty-five or thirty minutes, then remove it back, and add to the soup a bottle of Rhine-wine. Add a handful of bruised crackers, or else thicken with a piece of kneaded-butter, and finish the soup, introducing into it six ounces of good butter, after having removed the aromatics.COOKING-STOCK (FONDS DE CUISSON). Cooking-stock (fonds de cuissonJ is more or less complicated and rich, according as the service of a house is more or less considerable : but even when the work is conducted on restricted and limited conditions, the most vigilant care should be taken in the preparation of cooking-stock ; which forms the basis of all culinary operations, and the deficiency of which extends itself naturally to every thing derived therefrom. In a book of second order, such as the present one, I have confined myself to describing the principles of simple, quick, and easily prepared cooking-stocks ; I have therefore compressed them within the narrowest limits. I have written no special chapter on small sauces ; thinking it simpler to adapt them to receipts, to which they are especially applied. Besides, the series of sauces is necessarily abbreviated ; for in most parts of the articles, the sauce is prepared with the cooking-stock of the substances which it is to accompany. This method, being on the whole a very rational one, has been suggested to me by the wish to simplify the work, by rendering it more easy and less expensive. 153. Common stockpot. — In a kitchen, even of second order, if only the work be continuous, it is indispensable to put on every day a small stockpot, the produce of which is to serve for the alimentation of stews, sauces, and gravies. In a plain kitchen it is possible to avoid making expensive and abundant cooking-stocks, but one cannot omit preparing a small stockpot. Besides, with provident care, this preparation may cost but little ; since the meat, with which it is made, may always find some use. The stockpot is established, at its beginning, simply with a fewCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 60 pounds of meat, and vegetables, moistened with plenty of water; for, in the course of the work, there will always be found something to add to it; trimmings of large removes, raw or cooked bones, giblets of poultry, and many other trimmings ; which by themselves are of no value, no substance; but when collected, give a certain produce. Cooks should pay the greatest attention to constituting this stockpot suitably ; not only because it is sufficient for necessary cooking - stocks ; but because, with intelligent care, it may be used for making glaze, the co-operation of which is so much needed in small kitchens: to this end, when the broth is strained, put trim- mings and bones back into the stockpot ; add thereto all the trimmings of the other stocks handy, as from braises, sauces, and gravies ; moisten with hot water, in proportion to their quantity; add an assortment of fresh vegetables, and trimmings of raw meat, handy ; let the liquid boil, skimming, and treating it as the broth. Five or six hours later, strain the liquid, skim off it the fat, and reduce it by quick ebullition. 154. Gravy. — Gravy is of indispensable utility in the work of the kitchen. The process here described is simple, and gives a good result. Cut up in pieces four pounds of a leg of beef, and four pounds of veal from the shoulder or scrag of the neck ; put them into a stewpan with good clarified toppings, fry them on a moderate fire, stirring often with a spoon. When the meats are set, moisten with two gills of white wine, and reduce the liquid to a glaze ; then moisten with seven or eight quarts of hot broth, and skim carefully ; at the first bubbling, draw the pan on the side of the slow fire ; add to the gravy a few bones of roast meat, some vegetables, and a bunch* of parsley garnished with chervil, and aromatics ; add also a few whole spice. ** As soon as the most tender meats are done, take them out with a skimmer, remove the fat from the gravy, which pass through a sieve. This gravy may be clarified as a 'consommé’. 155. Meat-glaze. — In large, as well as in small kitchens, meat-glaze plays a great part, as well in regard to any work of urgency, as to one not finished, when time is wanting, and one must go on straight to the end. Cooks, who will not be taken in, should secure against accidents, by having some good glaze in reserve, thus securing some resources for difficult moments. I have already said, that the second broth of the stockpot could produce common glaze : the following is the method for obtaining some, more succulent and oleaginous. * The bunches of parsley, garnished with aromatics, ought always to be prepared beforehand. ** Whole spice is composed of peppercorns, cloves, coriander, and cinnamon; the two last named are not generally used for kitchen-preparations.61 COOKING-STOCK. Cut up in pieces six pounds of a leg of beef, put them into a large stockpot with six pounds of veal (the scrag of the neck), and a knuckle or two of veal ; also cut up in pieces, one or two hens (except the fillets), and the giblets (except the liver) of a few fowls ; cover the meats largely with second broth or water, set the stockpot on the fire, skim the liquid carefully, and at the first bubbling remove it back. One hour after, add to it a few good carrots, two or three leeks, a few sprigs of chervil, parsley and aromatics, cloves and peppercorns; continue a gentle ebullition. As soon as the meats are done, take them out. Afterwards, pass the broth through a sieve, skim off the fat, let it settle, decant it into two stewpans, reduce it on a brisk fire, until slightly thickened ; mix then together the two parts in a stewpan, high in form and narrow; let the glaze clarify on the side, skimming it until it be of the consistence of a light sauce, then pour it into one or several vessels, and keep it for use. 15G. Thickened gravy. — Thickened gravy (jus lié) is a diminutive of the classic 'Espagnole’-sauce ; the simplicity of its preparation will be found convenient in small kitchens, where abundance and time are often wanting. Cut up in squares a shoulder of veal (four or six pounds) ; put them into a stewpan with bacon, fry them moderately, stirring them frequently with a spoon ; a quarter of an hour after, add to the meat a large carrot, and two cut onions ; continue frying the meats for twelve or fifteen minutes ; moisten with half a quart of broth, cover the stewpan, and reduce the broth to a glaze, without burning; then moisten with six or eight quarts of hot broth, and half a bottle of white wine ; skim the stock, at the first bubbling, draw it on the side of the fire ; add a ham-bone, a fowl colored in the oven, and a few giblets of poultry ; such as necks, gizzards, and pinions ; cloves, peppercorns, and a bunch of parsley with aromatics. The pieces of meat being three-parts done, skim the fat from the stock, and thicken it with flour diluted cold (two tablespoonfuls to each quart of stock) ; continue boiling, skimming the sauce ; half an hour after, pass it through a sieve into a stewpan, let it boil up, then remove it back, and let it clarify for twenty-five minutes, adding from time to time a few spoonfuls of good broth ; skim it, pass it into a kitchen-basin, and let the sauce cool, stirring from time to time. 157. Brown meat-sauce.* — 111 great cookery this sauce also goes by the name of ‘Espagnole’ ; with it are prepared the greatest part of worked sauces. It is applied specially to the thickening of cooking-stock. ‘Roux’. — Melt six ounces of butter in a stewpan, add to it eight ounces of flour ; * lu a forthcoming work it is my intention to treat at length of the composition of sauces, rich and simple, in all their variety of development, according to the principles of the highest culinary art.62 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. stir the preparation, to thicken it ; draw it on a very slow fire, to fry, until of a light brown color ; then dilute it with four or five quarts of clear gravy, free of the fat ; stir the sauce until boiling, then place it on the corner of the stove-fire, so as to boil only on one side of the pan. Three quarters of an hour after, carefully skim off the fat, and pass it into a kitchen-basin. If this sauce is not to be used as soon as finished, let it cool in the kitchen- basin, stirring from time to time, lest a skin should form itself on its surface. 158. Brown fish-sauce. — Cut up in pieces a tench, a perch, a pike, and one gurnet. Mince two leeks, two onions, two carrots, and a piece of celery-root ; fry the vegetables on a moderate fire with butter. When of a fine color, add to it the fish ; three minutes after, moisten the whole with a sufficient quantity, of water and white wine, to cover; add the necessary salt, a few small fish, a bunch of parsley with aromatics, and two handfuls of trimmings of fresh mushrooms ;*skim the liquid, let it boil quickly for two minutes, and place it on the side of the stove-fire. As soon as the fish is done, pass the broth through a sieve, let it cool and settle. Skim from it carefully the fat, decant it into a stewpan, then clarify with ten ounces of pike’s flesh, two or three whole eggs, and a glass of white wine, proceeding as for fish 'consommé’. With six ounces of butter, and eight ounces of flour, prepare a brown 'roux’ ; moisten, by degrees, with four or five quarts offish-broth, stir the sauce on the fire until boiling, then remove it back, and let it boil gently, for three quarters of an hour ; skim off the fat, pass it through a tammy into a kitchen-basin, and stir it from time to time until cold. 159. White meat-sauce (velouté). — This sauce, in great cookery, goes'by the name of 'velouté' ; if thickened with eggs, it is called 'Allemande’. For kitchens where great sauces are not prepared, I give here a method to obtain some, requiring no great expense. Cut up in squares a shoulder or simply a breast of veal, put the squares into a stewpan with good clarified fat ; fry this over a brisk fire for a few minutes, allowing it to take a little color ; season, and sprinkle over a handful of flour, which fry for a few seconds, stirring the meat; then moisten with broth, thus obtaining a sauce not thick, but abundant ; stir the liquid until boiling, remove the sauce back, add to it a few vegetables, a bunch of parsley garnished with cloves and pepper- corns : add also a few trimmings of mushrooms. The pieces of meat being done, skim the fat from the sauce, which pass through a sieve into a kitchen-basin, and stir it from time to time.63 COOKING STOCK. 160. White fish-sauce (velouté). — With six ounces of butter, and eight ounces of flour, prepare a light yellow Toux’ ; that is to say, fry the flour without allowing it to take color. Dilute the Toux’ with four quarts of clarified fish-broth, stir the sauce on the fire until boiling, remove it back, and boil it for three quarters of an hour; then skim off the fat, pour it into a kitchen-basin, and stir with the spoon. 161. The ‘bain-marie’ (D. 3). — The bain -marie of the kitchen is com- posed of a deep baking-sheet, or square case in copper ; or else simply of a Fig. 3. flat stewpan with boiling-water in it In this vessel are kept warm those sauces and garnishes, which once finished must boil no longer. If the sauces of a dinner should be of great number, it is convenient to label the stewpans when shutting them in, so as to avoid any mistake at serving-time. The water of the ‘bain-marie’ must always be kept in a state of simmering, but not developed ebullition. The word ‘bain-marie’ is also applied to those creams, puddings, and ‘pains’ of poultry or game, which must be poached or cooked in a shut stewpan, the bottom of which is filled with a little boiling water. 162. Béchamel-sauce. — Put eight ounces of flour into a kitchen-basin, dilute it with three gills of cold milk, and fill the liquid in a stewpan, stir it on the fire; as soon as beginning to get consistent, remove it back, and work it well to smooth it; then moisten the sauce with a pint of boiled milk, add to it two small onions, a bunch of parsley, salt, peppercorns, and five ounces of raw ham in small dice. Let it boil, then put it back on a very slow fire, boil it twenty minutes, stirring from time to time ; and then pass it through a sieve, or a tammy. 163. ‘Mirepoix’. — The ‘mirepoix’ plays a great part in cookery, it is an auxiliary to many cookings; it is more or less rich, and carefully treated, according to wants and occasions.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 64 Mince a large onion, a large carrot, and a piece of celery-root; put them into a stewpan with a few trimmings of raw fat, and some melted fat ; fry them on a moderate fire, until the onions he of a nice color; then moisten with a quart of fat white broth, and half a bottle of white wine; let the liquid boil, draw it on the side of the fire, add to it a bunch of parsley and aromatics, cloves, peppercorns, a few fresh trimmings of mushrooms, and the pulp of two lemons, free of peel and pips. Twenty-five minutes after, pass the liquid through a sieve, without skimming off the fat. 164. ‘Court-bouillon’. — The common ‘court-bouillon’ is prepared, either with vinegar, or with light wines. It is an auxiliary most commonly used for the cooking of fish. Slice a large onion, one carrot, and a piece of celery-root ; fry them in a stewpan with butter, oil, or fat ; moisten afterwards either with water and vinegar, or with white or red wine, mixed up with some hot water. Start the liquid to ebullition, remove it back, add to it salt, cloves, peppercorns, and a bunch of parsley and aromatics. Twenty minutes after, pass it through a sieve. 165. Kneaded-Butter (beurre-manié). — By kneaded-butter is meant simply, butter mixed up with flour, so as to constitute a flexible, smooth paste. This butter serves commonly for thickening cooking-stock, and gravy.GARNISHED ‘HATELET’-SKEWERS. ‘Hatelet’-Skewers are made use of, either as an ornament, or as a garnish. They are applied alike to removes and entrees, if they be cold or warm, meat or fish. Yet it will not prove useless to observe, that ‘hatelet’- skewers, as a garnish, ought only to be applied in eases of great solemnity ; by making too frequent use of them, their value is considerably diminished. Besides, garnished ‘hatelet’-skewers are only then of relief, if playing a part agreeing to their natural luxury ; from the moment they cease to be surrounded by the brilliant cortège, which constitutes the sumptuous part of a well served dinner, they produce no effect. The six ‘hâtelets’-skewers, represented in the drawing, are all of a different character. No. 4. simply consists of a fine truffle, crowned by a double cocks-comb. This cocks-comb must be boiled very white, and kept rather firm. The truffle is cooked with its peel on. This ‘hatelet’ is destined to go on a remove, but may also be applied indifferently to cold or warm entrees : if a warm one, the truffle is left ‘au naturel’; if a cold one, it is either glazed with a paste-brush, or masked with aspic- jelly ; even so the cocks-comb. No. 5. shows a ‘hatelet’ with vegetables. It is composed of a crescent piece j crowned by an oval one ; its basis is formed by a bobèche (socket) of carrot channeled and turned up ; it is supported underneath by a small mushroom. The crescent and the oval piece are both of turnip ; being hollowed out on both sides, and then masked, I the crescent with a layer of spinach, passed through a sieve, and mixed up with a little of aspic-jelly, thus giving the purée a nice consistence : the oval piece is masked with a slice of very red carrot, cut out in the dimensions of the hollow. The i ‘hatelet’ is crowned by a small white or red emblem. No. 6. represents a ‘hatelet’ to be applied to the fish removes, and may be 1 indifferently cold or warm. It is composed of a cooked truffle, forming the support of a crayfish and two channeled button-mushrooms. 5GO COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. No. 8. is intended specially for cold pieces. It may indifferently be applied to meat or fish removes. It is composed of a small piece of transparent aspic, enshrined Fig.-4. Fig. 5. Fig. li. in a ‘hâtelet’-case. This ‘aspic’ is supported at its base by a small ball of truffle or pickled ox-tongue. The garnish may be composed of graduated rounds either ofHATELETS. 67 truffle and poultry-fillets, or of fish and lobster. The small ‘aspic’ is surmounted by a cooked truffle, either peeled or ‘au naturel’. No. 7. and 9. are also vegetable ‘hâtelets’ ; they are to be formed of turnip or carrot, carved with a knife into the shape of a vase, but taken in several pieces. The vases are then garnished with little flowers, imitated in vegetables. A man of skill and taste will be able to execute very nice imitated ‘bouquets’ of flowers, with the vegetables commonly in use in every kitchen ; such as fresh bay-leaves, nutmegs, peppercorns, etc. Certainly such flowers cannot boast the strictest likeness with natural flowers, yet they are of a very nice and original effect. I have often seen such ‘bouquets’ executed in great perfection by mere apprentices.FIS H. Considered in a point of view as regards the human race, the fish holds a large place among the boons bestowed on us by nature. It is a providence, a kind of celestial manna, reproducing and renewing itself incessantly, without any culture, without maintenance, without expensive endeavours, and without any work of our hands, or head. In a commercial point of view, the importance of fish is primary and universal: either fresh or salted, dried or pickled, it is the source of a vast number of employments, the products of which find their way all over the world. One thing really remarkable, is; that fish is generally good in all countries. In the most opposed latitudes, in the hottest pr coldest climates; where the soil is barren, the earth sterile ; fish is not only abundant, but often of the best kind. In all the countries of the world, every sea, every river, every lake, furnishes its peculiar species ; and besides the indifferent, there are always to be found some of the best. In gastronomy, the sea-fisli, as well as the fresh-water-fish, is of incom- parable usefulness and resource, whether estimated in connection with industrial work, or considered as a modification of our daily food. Fish, by the infinite variety of the species, by the precious qualities of its flesh, is admirably adapted to the most distinguished and most esteemed culinary combinations ; cookery drawing from it the greatest profit. The advantage of fish, (over butcher’s meat, poultry, and game), is, that it may serve as well for the composition of a lean or fasting dinner, as for that of a fat or festive one. Fish being generally so highly esteemed, that it must find its place in a dinner, be it never so little refined. Hardly, save in the plainest, most homely dinners, can it be omitted. The great variety existing, between the flesh of different sorts of fish, offers to cookery immense resources. A clever practitioner may with theseCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 70 diverse elements, prepare some very complete lean (maigres) dinners, distinguished as well as succulent. With fish are prepared soups, ‘hors-d’oeuvre’, removes, hot and cold entrees, and even roasts. A primary rule, to be applied to the majority of fish, is, to cook them very fresh. Some of them, even, only give satisfactory results, if killed a moment previous to cooking. The English, generally greatly esteeming fish, have adopted a par- ticular sauce to each of its species, with which they invariably serve it. I consider it of some interest to make them known to the European public. With turbot, lobster-sauce, or prawn or shrimp-sauce, is generally taken : with boiled salmon, parsley-sauce ; often accompanied by cucumber- salad: to cod, oyster - sauce : whiting with mackerel requires egg-sauce, cooked parsley-sauce, or some gooseberry-sauce. Fried fish ; as whiting, sole, trout, smelts ; must have anchovy-sauce, that is to say, a sauce finished with anchovy-butter, or essence of anchovies. 166. Kadgiori of turbot. — This dish is of Indian origin, but is likewise often served in England. Take out the fillets of a small raw turbot, cut them into large dice, and fry them with butter on a sharp fire for two minutes only ; season, and remove the stewpan back. Chop one onion, fry it with butter, without allowing it to take color, mix in a pound of rice, previously washed, and drained on a sieve for one hour ; a few seconds after' moisten it three times its height with fish-broth ; then boil it on a sharp fire for ten or twelve minutes, and keep the stewpan at the mouth of the oven, until the rice be about dry. Now add to the above the turbot, and a little cayenne pepper, a few tablespoonfuls of white-sauce, as well as three chopped hard-boiled eggs. Dish the whole, and baste it with a little brown clarified butter. 1(17. Turbot, English way (D. 10). — Select a very fresh and white turbot, draw it, trim away the fins all round, and score it, on the black side, along the back-bone ; then let it lie steeped in cold water for one hour; drain it, truss its head, and place the fish on the drainer of a turbot-kettle, with its black side downwards. Add thereto two handfuls of salt, cover it with cold water, and set itFISH. 71 on a brisk fire. When the liquid is beginning to boil, remove it back, and keep the fish thus for forty-five or fifty minutes, according to the thickness of the flesh, and preserving the liquid always at the same degree, without allowing it to boil. Meanwhile, boil a middle-sized lobster in salt water, then pick its tail, taking the meat in one piece, without breaking the shell. Cut the meat in slices, which place in a small stewpan. Cut up the trimmings, and the meat of the claws, in small dice, and keep them covered. Fig. 10. Prepare a very smooth butter-sauce -, which finished, add the ‘salpicon’ of lobster, and keep it at the ‘bain-marie’. When about to be served, drain the turbot, take the string off the head, and slip it on to a large dish, the bottom of which is covered with an oval-shaped flat full of holes, and covered with a napkin ; it is hardlv necessary to mention, that the white side of the fish must be placed upwards. The cooked lobster is set on the centre of the turbot, on the shell of the lobster is arranged the flesh of its tail, cut up in slices, and the shell itself run through with a fliatclet’-skewer, garnished with a crayfish. The turbot is surrounded with fresh parsley, and the lobster-sauce is sent up separately. 168. Hot turbot-pie (‘paté-chaud’), Danish fashion. — Take a small raw turbot, or the half of a large one, remove its flesh, cut it across in fillets one inch wide, which put into a kitchen-basin, and season with salt and spices. Boil hard five or six eggs, cut them up in quarters, season them with salt and spices, sprinkle over some parsley, and keep them covered in a basin. Sift a pound of large semolina, so as not to leave in it a particle of flour ; then mix with it, one after the other, two yolks of eggs, rubbing it between the hands; spread it on a baking-sheet, and dry it in a hot closet ; rub it again, breaking all lumps, and boil it with a little butter in salted water, keeping it compact and dry.72 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. Chop separately two white onions, a good handful of parsley, and some fresh mushrooms. Fry the onions in a stewpan with butter, without giving them color; add the mushrooms, which fry likewise, reducing their moisture ; then sprinkle the fine-herbs with a tablespoonful of flour, and moisten with half a glass of white wine. Add to the above a bay-leaf ; keep stirring the sauce until boiling, and cook it for a few minutes ; then throw in the chopped parsley, and the fillets of turbot; cover the stewpan, boil the sauce a few minutes more, and remove the pan back ; keep it thus for five minutes, and allow the fish and the sauce to cool together. Prepare some puff-paste, with a pound of flour, and twelve ounces of butter; give it six turns, allow it to rest, then put a quarter of it by, and roll the remainder to an oblong-square flat, twelve inches wide and the double in length. Now roll it round the rolling-pin, to be rolled out on a slab ; wet the paste all round, and spread on its centre a layer of cooked and cooled semolina, giving it the same form as the paste-flat, but much narrower ; set on it the fillets of turbot, mixing with them the fine-herbs, the hard-boiled eggs, and two dozen raw oysters ; then cover the Avholc, on the sides, and on the top, with the remainder of the semolina, shaping the pie into a convex and regular form ; raise immediately the paste of the sides over the top, so as to cover it; raise likewise the paste of the ends, and fold them back over the pie, making them fast leaning against it. Gild over its surface with beaten eggs, make a hole or chimney (cheminée) over the centre, to give vent to the steam ; and witli the point of a small knife trace a little drawing, on the sur- face of the flat. The pie being ready, push it into a moderate oven, and a few minutes afterwards, cover it with paper, which secure on the sides of the pie with string, in order to sustain the paste ; bake it for one hour and a quarter. Meanwhile, blanch two dozen oysters with a glass of white wine. With the head and bones of the turbot, with wine and vegetables, prepare a quart of broth ; with the broth and the liquor of the oysters, prepare a small stewpan of white sauce, thicken with three yolks of eggs, finish with a piece of butter, chopped parsley, and lemon-juice; add the oysters, and serve separately in a sauce- boat with the hot pie. 169. Turbot salad (D. 11). — Take a piece of boiled and cooled turbot, remove its skin and bones, cut the flesh into small slices, which place in a kitchen-basin, moistening with oil and vinegar, and sprinkling over salt and chopped parsley. Put into another basin a plain border-mould, which surround, and fill its cylinder with pounded ice. The interior sides are decorated with a circle of fine fresh boiled prawns, fixing them to the sides by dipping them into half-set jelly ; fill the mould, and by degrees, with liquid jelly.FISH. 73 When the jelly is firm, dip the mould quickly into hot water; wipe, and turn the border out on to a cold dish. Mask the bottom of the cylinder with a layer ot chopped aspic-jelly, and a little vegetable salad with mayonnaise. In this salad the Fig. 11. slices of turbot are dished in layers and pyramids, each layer alternated with a little mayonnaise. The pyramid, at the last moment, is masked with a smooth layer of mayonnaise, a sauceboatful of which is served separately. 170. Half-turbot, prawn-sauce with cream (D. 12). — In dinners ‘a la Russe’, where dishes are handed round to the guests, it would be difficult Fig. 12. for a servant, to go all round the table with a whole turbot. In this case it is better to cut the fish. If there arc but ten or twelve persons to serve, one half will do. If the dinner is served double (or two of every dish), each half may be served up separately. Cut up the flesh of a large well-cleansed turbot ; open it up the back, then saw off the head, and the back-bone in two. Take the thickest part of the turbot, being that opposite the belly, slightly disengage the flesh adhering to the bone, which cut off at both its ends with the point of a large knife; steep the fish, and boil it for three quarters of an hour (see No. 167). When i*eady to serve, drain the fish, remove the74 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. bone entirely, wipe it with a cloth, slip it on to a hot dish, and mask it with the following sauce: Prawn-sauce, with cream. — Put into a stewpan about a pint and a half of ‘béchamel’-sauce, just passed through a sieve; reduce it, introducing into it a few spoonfuls of raw cream, and a little mushroom - liquor ; when quite creamy, draw it off the fire, introduce into it four ounces of fresh butter, and at last two ounces of prawn-butter. Mask the turbot with a part of the sauce, mix into the remainder a few table- spoonfuls of picked prawns’ tails, and pour it into a sauce-boat. Garnish the fish with parsley. 171. Turbot with cream, ‘au gratin’. — Boil in salted water the half of a turbot (the belly-side) ; drain, remove the black skin, and all the bones ; divide the flesh into middling-sized pieces, and place them in layers, on a deep dish. Sprinkle each layer with a pinch of cooked and chopped mushrooms. Mask them with a few spoonfuls of good, reduced and well seasoned, ‘bechamel’-sauce. Dish the preparation in a dome-like fashion, and mask it likewise with the sauce. Sprinkle over some bread-crumb, baste it with a little melted butter, and set it to take color, in a hot oven, for ten or twelve minutes. On taking it out, the dish is placed on another dish, and sent up. 172. Turbot, Indian fashion. — Having cleansed a small turbot, or the half of a middling-sized one, cut it into square pieces, which steep for twenty minutes in a kitchen-basin, containing a little salt and water. With the head and bones of the turbot, prepare a broth in the manner pre- scribed in No. 164. Cut into dice two middling-sized onions, fry them in a stewpan with butter, till of a fine color ; then add the pieces of turbot, previously washed and drained. Fry them a few minutes, giving them a jerk from time to time; season, and sprinkle over them two tablespoonfuls of curry-powder, and the same of flour. Two minutes afterwards, moisten gradually with the prepared broth, until covered ; add a bunch of parsley, and let it boil for twenty minutes. Now remove the pieces of turbot, one by one, trim them neatly, and place them on a hot dish ; reduce the sauce quickly, and thicken it with three yolks of eggs, diluted with cream; pass it through a sieve, over the fish; and send up separately, a dish of rice cooked Indian way (.see Chicken, Indian fashion). 173. Crayfish, Bordeaux fashion. — Let a few dozen fine crayfish soak in water for two hours ; the water must be mixed with a little milk ; drain them afterwards on a sieve.75 FISH. Prepare a good ‘mirepoix’ of vegetable, with white Bordeaux-wine ; add to it some spoonfuls of madeira, a small glass of cognac, a little salt, a bunch ot parsley, and a slice of raw ham; cover the stewpan, give the liquid five or six minutes’ ebullition, and add to it the crayfish. Ten minutes afterwards, drain the liquor, passing it through a sieve ; reduce it to half, introducing gradually four gills of‘velouté’-sauce : the sauce being reduced to the degree requisite, pass it through a tammy into another stewpan ; finish it by introducing into it four ounces of fresh butter, a little piece of crayfish-butter, and a spoonful of chopped parsley. Bemove the small claws of the crayfish, and dish in a group on a napkin, surrounding them with green leaves of parsley ; serve the sauce separately. 174. ‘Petits-pains’ (rolls) of crayfish, with jelly (D. 13). — Cut up into small dice the tails and large claws, of three dozen boiled crayfish ; add thereto Fig. 13. the fillets of four anchovies, also cut in dice, two tablespoonfuls of whole capers, and thicken the ‘salpicon’ with some ‘mayonnaise’-sauce with eggs, finished with a little aspic-jelly. Set on a baking-sheet ten or twelve ‘dariole’-moulds, surround them with pounded ice, decorate the bottom with a round of gerkin, dipping them into half- set aspic ; coat (chemiser) the interior surfaces of the moulds with a layer of mayonnaise with aspic, fill them afterwards with the prepared ‘salpicon’, which mask on the top with a layer of mayonnaise, and let it cool for an hour. When ready to serve, turn out the ‘petits-pains’, dish them up on a little stand, masked with paper. The stand may be omitted. 175. Crayfish, Lorraine fashion. — Cleanse two dozen large crayfish, boil them in white wine, drain them on a sieve, preserving their liquor. Cut into small dice a pound of raw ham, warm it in a stewpan with a little butter, mix therewith two tablespoonfuls of flour ; which fry a few minutes, stirring with a spoon, and diluting with a little good boiled milk, and the liquor of the crayfish. Work the s^uce until boiling, and reduce it till frothy and succulent,COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 76 Remove it back, and introduce into it a piece of good butter, and a pinch of chopped parsley. Pour this sauce over the crayfish, previously freed of their small claws, and dish up. 176. Crayfish ‘à la marinière’. — Boil a few dozen ci’ayfish with white wine, forthwith drain the liquor, to let it set ; then clear it, by passing it through a linen cloth. The small claws of the crayfish must be omitted. Chop one onion, fry it in butter, avoiding its taking color ; moisten it with the crayfish liquor, add a little wine, boil the liquid a few minutes; then thicken it with a piece of butter, kneaded with bread-crumbs and chopped parsley, in order to obtain a thick sauce; finish it with a little cayenne, and the juice of a lemon. Dish up the crayfish, and pour the sauce over them. 177. ‘Cromeskis’ of crayfish, German fashion. — Cut into small dice a few dozen cooked crayfish-tails ; put them into.a stewpan with a third of their volume of cooked mushrooms, also cut into dice; thicken the ‘salpicon’ with reduced ‘bechamel-sauce, proceeding according to the direction given for the ‘cro- quettes’ preparation ; spread the preparation, in a thin layer, on a small baking-sheet to cool. Prepare about fifteen pancakes without sugar ; when cold, pare them into oblong squares; mask them each with a small part of the crayfish preparation, egg over their edges, which fold and solder ; afterwards dip the ‘cromeskis’ into beaten eggs, bread-crumb, fry, drain, and dish them on a folded napkin. 178. ‘Rissoles’ of crayfish, with mushrooms. — Boil a few dozen middling-sized crayfish, pick the claws and tails, cut their flesh into small dice, which put into a kitchen-basin, with the same volume of cooked fish force-meat, also cut into dice. Cut likewise into small dice the same volume of raw mushrooms, as of cray- fish tails ; put them into a stewpan with a few spoonfuls of ‘béchamel’-sauce, reduce the sauce over a sharp fire, stirring and gradually introducing into it the liquor of the crayfish. When the sauce is of a nice consistence, mix with it the ‘salpicon’ of crayfish and force-meat, give it a boiling, remove the stewpan back, and thicken the preparation with two yolks of eggs, and a piece of crayfish-butter. Season with a little nutmeg, and allow it to cool in a kitchen-basin. Take about a pound of puff-paste, divide it in two parts, which roll, one after the other, into square and thin flats ; now put on the first flat, at about one inch from the edge, and one inch and half distant one from the other, small balls of the pre- paration about the size of a small walnut. Moisten the paste, and fold it in a straight line, so as to cover them ; fasten the paste between each ball with the finger, in order to solder it all round ; then with a plain or fluted cutter^two inches in diameter)FISH. 77 cut out the ‘rissoles’ in the shape of a crescent ; as soon as the first row of ‘rissoles’ is ready, cut the flat straight with the knife, and begin another row of‘rissoles’, pro- ceeding in the same manner, until all the preparation is used up. Dip these ‘rissoles’ afterwards into beaten eggs; bread-crumb them, equalise them with the hand, and when ready, range them on a baking-sheet, masked with paper. A few minutes previous to serving, plunge the ‘rissoles’ into hot hog’s lard, and fry them on a moderate fire, for six or eight minutes. When of a nice color, drain, and dish them on a folded napkin. 179. ‘Crayfish-tails’ salad (D. 14). — Surround a plain border-mould with ice, ornament its sides with gx-cen gerkins, previously dipped in half-set aspic ; Fig. 14. then coat [napper) the mould, at the bottom, and all l’ound, with a layer of ‘mayonnaise’ with jelly ; which having set, fill the cavity with a salad of vegetables cut into small dice, thickened with mayonnaise-sauce ; cover the top with a layer of jelly, thus entirely hiding the salad. The jelly having set, dip the mould into hot watci', wipe, and turn the boi’der out on a cold dish. Then stick in the centre of it a small wooden stem masked with paper, surround it with some vegetable salad, shaping it in a dome-like form ; mask this dome with some large crayfish-tails, arranged in rows, placed over each other. Set on the top of the dome a small subject in fat ; surround the base with chopped aspic, and serve separately a sauce-boat of mayonnaise-sauce with eggs. 180. Crayfish, Provence fashion. — Boil two dozen fine crayfish in a ‘mirepoix’ with white wine, aromatics, and a slice of ham ; drain, and pass their liquoj’ through a sieve, mix therewith a little good gravy, reduce it to half-glaze, then inti’oduce into it five or six tablespoonfuls of tomata-sauce, not thickeixed. Remove the same back, let it simmer a few minutes longer, then season with a point of78 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. cayenne, and thicken it, off the fire, with six ounces of butter in small pieces. Dish up the crayfish, and send the sauce up separately in a sauce-boat. 181. Muscles à la marinière. — Take the muscles, one by one, to remove the stringy parts adhering thereto, taking care to throw away those which are broken, or already opened ; steep them in acidulated water, wash them several times, and drain them on a sieve, or in a colander. Put four or five dozen muscles into a stewpan with a glassful of white wine, a bunch of parsley, garnished with aromatics and a clove of garlic not peeled ; set the stewpan on the fire ; cover it, and give the muscles from time to time a jerk until they open ; then remove the pan back, drain the liquor into a kitchen-basin, and let it settle. Now chop a large onion, fry it in a stewpan with butter, without allowing it to take color ; moisten with the liquor of the muscles, previously decanted ; add a little wine or broth, a pinch of pepper, and a piece of kneaded-butter, so as to thicken the sauce slightly ; then pour the muscles in, after having removed the most part of the shell. Add to the above a piece of butter; jerk the whole, off the fire, until the butter be dissolved ; finish with a pinch of chopped parsley, and send up in a deep dish. 182. Muscles, Bordeaux fashion. — Wash several times a few dozen good muscles, trim away the stringy part corresponding to the inside; put them into a stewpan, and toss them on the fire a few minutes, to open them. Shred into julienne’ one carrot, one onion, and a piece of celery-root ; place these vegetables in a stewpan with a piece of butter, fry them gently, and moisten with a little broth, which reduce to a glaze. Then moisten with a glass of white wine, let the liquid boil a while, thicken it with a piece of kneaded-butter, add a point of cayenne, a little of the ‘muscles’ liquor, and the muscles, after having removed the half of the shells. Warm the sauce for two minutes, without letting it boil, and send up on a dish. 183. ‘Pain’ of whiting, Paris way (D. 15). — Cut up in pieces a pound of whiting’s flesh, without skin or bones; pound, and pass them through a sieve ; take three parts of its volume of panada, prepared with rice-flour, a little salt, and a piece of butter ; put it into a mortar, to pound it well ; add by degrees the whiting’s flesh, and at the same time ten ounces of good butter, and four raw yolks of eggs. Then season the force-meat, put it into a kitchen-basin, work it for a few minutes, and try a small part of it in boiling water, to rectify it, as required. With this force-meat fill a buttered border-mould, and poach it in the ‘bain-marie’. With the remainder of the force-meat mould some small ‘quenelles’, and poach them in salted water. With the bones and heads of the fish, two hand-FISH. 79 fuis of trimmings of mushrooms, and two glasses of white wine, prepare a little extract ; drain it, skim off its fat, and gradually introduce into it a pint of ‘velouté’- sauce. The sauce being reduced, drain, and keep it hot. Fig. 15. Meanwhile, place in a stewpan a garnish, composed of picked crayfish-tails, button-mushrooms, soft-roes of carp, ‘quenelles’, and a few whole truffles. When ready to serve, finish the sauce by introducing into it a piece of crayfish-butter, and \ another of good simple butter ; pour it over the garnish, which dish up into the border of force-meat turned out on a hot dish, masking the border with the sauce. 184. Salmon, crayfish-sauce. (D. 16.) — Choose a salmon of from [ eight to ten pounds ; draw it by a small opening made in the belly, carefully wash, Fig. 16. dry it with a cloth, and make, at a little distance all along the back, small incisions, penetrating to the principal bone. Place the salmon on the drainer of a fish-kettle, resting it on its belly, sprinkle over two or three handfuls of salt, and moisten it with a sufficient quantity of white wine and water, to cover it ; add a bunch of parsley, two sliced onions, and a piece of celery ; set the fish-kettle on the fire, bring the liquid to ebullition, and at the first bubbling remove the fish-kettle, thus keeping the fish simmering for an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half, according to its thickness. Drain it afterwards, then place it on a large oblong dish, covered with a napkin ; surround it with parsley, and cooked crayfish ; serve separately the following sauce :COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 80 Crayfisli-sauce. — Prepare a butter-sauce with four ounces of butter and four ounces of flour; moistening with water and a little liquor of the salmon, previously divested of its fat, and passed through the sieve. When the sauce is thickened, intro- duce into it three ounces of fresh butter, a piece of crayfish-butter, as well as four or five spoonfuls of crayfish tails and claws, either cut up into small dice or left whole. 185. Broiled bream, shalot sauce. — Get a live bream, scale, draw it; trim off the fins, and the tip of the tail ; wipe it well, score it slightly, season, and baste it with oil. Place the fish on a gridiron, to broil it on both sides, on a moderate fire, basting it with oil ; when done, dish it up, and pour over the folloAving sauce: Shalot-sauce. — Warm in a stewpan eight ounces of butter, take it off the fire, and add a little salt, chopped parsley, four chopped yolks of hard-boiled eggs, two spoonfuls of chopped cooked shalot, and the juice of a lemon. 186. Muscles ‘à la poulette’. — Wash, and make open, over the fire, five or six dozen fine fresh muscles (see No. 181). Pick off the shells, wipe the meat on a cloth, put it into a stewpan, and let the liquor settle, to clarify. Chop one onion, fry it with butter, without allowing it to take color, add two tablespoonfuls of flour ; which fry for a few seconds, stirring and moistening it by degrees with the muscles’ liquor, and a little white wine and broth. Stir the sauce, to thicken it ; cook it for a few minutes, and pass it through a sieve on to the muscles. Boil the sauce, add to it a pinch of cayenne, and thicken it with a liaison of two diluted yolks of eggs ; cook the preparation, without letting it boil ; add a pinch of chopped parsley, and the juice of a lemon. 187. ‘Buisson à la marinière’. — This piece is represented in a copper- plate engraving, out of text, which is found at the end of the chapter on Butcher’s meat. It is mounted on a large wooden flat, standing on four knobs, edged at the base, with leaves in white fat. The body of the piece is composed of two wooden drums forming steps ; these drums are hollow, and constructed of thin wood. On the centre of the second step, rises a pyramid, made of cardboard, and masked with a layer of fat. On the top of this pyramid, is fixed a subject in fat representing a sailor, leaning on an anchor, and holding a hat in his hand: this subject is modeled on a round wooden flat, adorned at its base with leaves in fat. The garnish of this piece is composed, first of small ‘aspics’ of lobster with mayonnaise, placed on the top of the first step, then of a circle of nice crayfish, and lastly, of three rows of garnished ‘hâtelet’-skewers. The crayfish are chosen of an equal size, and grouped in a circle at the base of the pyramid, fastened by their tails, and reclining on a bed of fresh parsley. Above the crayfish are inserted the81 FISH. transparent ‘hâtelets’, garnished inwardly with slices of lobster and truffle; they are supported, at their base, by a round peeled cooked truffle. The ‘hâtelets’ of the second row are also transparent, formed in oval moulds, with jelly and truffles; the body of the ‘hatelct’ is sustained, at its base, with a cooked peeled truffle. The ‘hâtelets’ of the third row are formed with prawns of graduated size, thus forming a pyramid. The four ‘hâtelet’-skewers inserted at the sides of the piece, at its base and top, are made with jelly. Those of the bottom are adorned with a crayfish and a truffle, those at the top with a truffle and prawns. All these ‘hâtelets’, being eatable, should be done in the best condition possible. The top of the lowest flat is garnished with fine ‘croûtons’ of aspic-jelly. This piece is intended to be ser- ved on a ball-'buffet’, or as a centre-piece at a dinner. 188. Venice whiting-quenelles. — Prepare a pound and a quarter of whiting force-meat ; when finished, try it ; then with the aid of a spoon, mould a dozen ‘quenelles’, which let slip on the bottom of a buttered ‘sauté’-pan. A few minutes previous to serving, poach the ‘quenelles’ in boiling salted water, drain them, and dish them in a circular order : fill the cavity with scollops of lobster- tail, masking the garnish with a little ‘velouté’-sauce. 189. Tail of whiting, Cherbourg fashion. — Take the tail-end of a large whiting, that is, half of the fish ; scale it, trim away the fins, wash, dry it on a cloth, and divide it in thick slices. Butter thickly the bottom of a flat stewpan, sprinkle it with two or three hand- fuls of trimming of mushrooms and little chopped onions, on which place the slices of whiting, side by side. Salt them slightly, add a bunch of parsley, garnished with a bay-leaf, and moisten them to their height with white wine, the juice of two lemons, and the liquor of three dozen large oysters : cover the stewpan, set it on a brisk fire, boil the fish for eight or ten minutes ; when done, the liquid should be reduced to half ; then dish up the slices of whiting, remove the parsley, reduce the liquid ; if too thin, thicken it with a piece of kneaded-butter ; boil the sauce, pass it through a tammy, and finish by introducing a quarter of a pound of fresh butter divided in little bits; add the oysters of the sauce, and with them mask the fish. 190. ‘Bouillabaisse’, Paris way. — To prepare a good ‘bouillabaisse’, one ought to have at one’s disposal very fresh live fish. It is only in such con- ditions that a satisfactory result may be obtained.

With the heads, and some other small G82 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. fish, with vegetables, wine, and water, prepare about two quarts of broth, without salt ; drain it, skim off its fat, and let it settle. Mince a leek, and a large white onion ; put them into a stewpan, with two gills of good oil, and a clove of garlic ; fry them to a light brown color, add the pieces of fish, which moisten to their height, with the prepared broth and a little white wine. Add to the above a small, raw, cut lobster ; a bunch of parsley, a bay-leaf, the pulp of a lemon without its peel and pips, a little salt, and a little saffron. Set the stewpan on a brisk fire, and keep it briskly boiling, until the fish be done. Now remove the stewpan back, take out the parsley, and pour the liquid over some broad slices of bread, the fifth of an inch thick. Place the slices of fish on a dish, and serve them at the same time with the broth and bread. 191. Slices of salmon, Frankfort fashion. — Cut three slices out of a very fresh salmon; cleanse, wipe, and salt them. Shred in ‘julienne’ two middling-sized onions, put them into a stewpan with four tablespoonfuls of parsley-root, and two spoonfuls of celery-root, also shred in ‘julienne’. If these vegetables be not quite young, they should be previously blanched in water. Fry the onion, and the roots, on a moderate fire; moisten them with two glassfuls of white wine, and the same of water; add a few peppercorns, and a bunch of parsley; boil the whole a few minutes, and plunge in the slices of salmon, which must be moistened to their height. Cover the stewpan; at the first, bubbling up, remove it back. Ten minutes afterwards, drain the salmon’s liquor, thicken it with a tablespoonful of potato Hour, let the sauce boil, and add to the above two or three spoonfuls of good vinegar, and a little aspic-jelly; five or six minutes after, take out the slices of salmon with a skimmer, remove their skin, and place them on a deep dish; reduce the sauce for a few minutes, remove the parsley, and pour it into a kitchen-basin; let it nearly cool, stirring it on the ice. When quite cold, pour it over the slices of salmon, glazing them with it. Keep this dish on the ice until serving-time. 192. Salted salmon, Norway fashion. — In the north of Europe, salmon is salted, like beef and pork. Previous to cooking the salted salmon, steep it in cold water for forty-eight hours, more or less according to the size of the piece ; place it in a stewpan, moisten with plenty of cold water, and bring it to ebullition. Remove it then back, keeping it covered; after ten minutes, drain the salmon, place it on some boiled, but not chopped spinach, pour over some melted butter, and serve it : the spinach and melted butter can be served separately.83 FISH. 193. Fried slices of salmon. — Cut three or four thin slices of salmon; when cleansed and dried, season, flour, dip them into beaten eggs and bread-crumbs, and plunge them into hot hog’s lard. Fry them for ten or twelve minutes; and when of a nice color, drain them, and sprinkle them with salt; dish them on a folded nap- kin, and surround them with halves of lemon. 194. Slices of salmon, ‘gourmets’-sauce. (D.17.)—Take four slices of salmon, one inch thick, from the centre of the fish ; wash, dry them on a cloth, and Fig. 17. plunge them into a boiling ‘court-bouillon’ with wine. At the first bubbling, remove the stewpan back; cover it, and keep the liquid at the same degree without boiling. Ten or twelve minutes after, drain the slices of salmon, dry them on a cloth, and i arrange them ‘à cheval’ on a folded napkin; surround them with green parsley, put on each side a group of potatoes, boiled in salted water, and send up separately the following: sauce : ‘Gourmets’-sauce. — Boil in a stewpan about three parts of a glass of meat- glaze, with four tablespoonfuls of purée of tomatas; remove the sauce back from the fire, and gradually introduce into it, working with a spoon, six ounces of crayfish- ! butter in small bits. The sauce having thickened, mix with it a tablespoonful of good vinegar, and finish with a pinch of chopped taragon, and the same of slialot, chopped fine, and blanched. 195. Mayonnaise of salmon, with jelly. — Cut up in slices about two pounds of raw salmon without bones; sprinkle these slices with a little salt, place them, one beside the other, on the drainer of a small fish-kettle, and plunge them into a boiling ‘court-bouillon.’ Give the liquid two bubblings, and remove the pan back. Ten minutes after, take out the fish, and let it cool. When ready to serve, turn out a border of jelly on a dish, mask the bottom of the cavity with a layer of mayon- naise, on which place alternately slices of salmon with mayonnaise. The top is like- wise covered with mayonnaise. u*COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 84 196. Hot salmon-pie (‘pâté chaud’). Short-paste. — Spread a pound of flour, in a circle, on a slab ; place in its centre ten ounces of butter, one yolk of egg, a pinch of salt, and half a glass of water. Dilute the butter with the liquid, introducing into it gradually the flour, in order to obtain a firm paste ; break (briser) it thrice with the palm of both hands, gather it up, and let it rest for half an hour. Butter a round pie-mould, and put it on a baking-sheet, covered with paper. With ten or twelve ounces of the flesh of pike, prepare a ‘quenelle’ force- meat. Procure a piece of fresh salmon, about a pound and a half, in weight ; remove the skin and bones ; divide the flesh in squares. Chop one onion, fry it in a stewpan with oil or butter, mix in a few spoonfuls of fresh chopped mushrooms, and as soon as their moisture is reduced, add two or three raw chopped truffles, and the squares of salmon; fry them a few minutes over a sharp fire ; season with salt and spices, and moisten with half a glass of madeira. Boil the whole for a few minutes, with the stewpan covered, and remove it back. Take two-thirds of the prepared paste, mould (mouler) it to a ball, and roll it in a thin round flat; raise the sides of this paste, pressing the paste between the fingers, thus forming a kind of bag. Then lift the paste carefully, to put it on the mould, covering it well at the bottom, and along its sides; cut the paste half an inch above the rim of the mould, mask it at the bottom, and on the sides, with a layer of force-meat. On this layer is placed, half of the slices of salmon, with a part of the fine-herbs (‘fincs-herbcs’) ; now mask again with force-meat, and pile up the remain- der of the fish in a dome-like fashion, rising above the rim of the mould. Cover the fish with another layer of force-meat, and this with the remainder of the paste, rolled very thin. Solder the two flats of paste on the edges, thus forming the pie-crust, pressing the paste in order to render it thinner ; cut it regularly, in order to he pinched all round with pastry-pincers. With the trimmings of the paste prepare a few imitation-leaves, which arrange as a ‘rosace’ on the dome, on the top of which form a little cavity ; cover it with three small rounds of paste of different sizes, placed one above another like a pyramid. Egg the pie, and push it into a moderate oven; seven or eight minutes later, cover it with paper, and bake it for one hour and a half. On taking it out, having put it on a dish; remove the mould, and cut the dome all round its centre; by which aperture, pour into the pie a little white-sauce, reduced with extract prepared with wine, and the trimmings and bones of the pike and salmon. Cover the pie, and serve.85 FISH. 197. Slice (‘darne’*) of salmon, with Montpellier-butter. (D. 18.) - MontpelUcr-butter. Put into a mortar the fillets of eight or ten salted anchovies; add a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, one of taragon-leaves, one of burnet, and four of capers, also chopped up; pound the whole; add to the above five ounces of fresh butter, and pass it through a sieve. Place eight ounces of fresh butter in a warm kitchen-basin, work it with the spoon to render it frothy ; then introduce into it the preparation, passed through a sieve ; add a little green spinach-extract. Season, and make use of it immediately. Fig. 18. Cut, off a large salmon, one slice three or four inches thick ; cleanse, and place it in a stewpan, cover it with ‘court-bouillon’ half-cooled. Set the stewpan on the fire, bring the liquid to ebullition; then remove it back, cover the pan, and let the fish cool in its liquor. Then drain it carefully, dry it on a cloth, skin it, set it on a ‘pain-vert’, and mask it entirely with the ‘Montpellier’-butter, finished at the same time. Smooth its surface, equalising the more angular parts, place a small cooked lobster in the hollow of the ‘darne’; decorate it by the aid of a cornet, filled with white butter, with cut-up gerkins, poached white of egg, fillets of anchovy, and whole capers : the decoration is according to fancy. Surround the ‘darne’ at its base with a string of chopped aspic-jelly, and the ‘pain-vert’ with fine ‘croûtons’ of the same. Send up separately a boatful of mayonnaise-sauce. 198. Salmon cutlets, shalôt-sauce of Béarn. — Remove the skin of a large fillet of salmon, divide it transversally and slantwise into slices; which beat slightly, and pare of an oval form. Salt, and dip them in oil; bread-crumb, and place them on a gridiron, previously warmed, and rubbed with oiled paper ; broil the cutlets on both sides, for twelve or fifteen minutes, basting them with oil. Dish them up afterwards, and pour over the following sauce : By ‘darne’ is understood, a very thick slice cut transversally off the body of the fish.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 86 Beam shalot-sauce. — Put into a small stewpan two tablespoonfuls of chopped shalots, and four of good vinegar; set it on the fire, and boil the shalots, until the vinegar be reduced to half; then remove the stewpan back; and when the prepara- tion is about cold, add four yolks of eggs, which beat with a spoon ; add four table- spoonfuls more of good oil. Set the stewpan again on a slow fire, and thicken the sauce, stirring it; remove it back, and introduce into it, by small quantities, half a glass of oil, alternated with the juice of half a lemon; finish with a little chopped taragon and parsley. 199. Yatel salmon. — This piece is represented in an engraving out of text. Cut two nice slices off the thickest part of a salmon; cleanse, and boil them in a ‘court-bouillon’ with white wine; in which let them cool, then drain, and wipe them on a cloth. Prepare a ‘pain-vert’ of an oval form, fix on its centre a bread-stem masked with fat, likewise of an oval form, and cut up slantwise at each extremity; set the two slices of salmon leaning against them ; glaze them with reddened aspic-jelly, support them on the top by inserting a ‘hâtelet’- skewer, garnished with a large crayfish. Surround with chopped jelly, squeezed through a cornet ; and garnish the intervals, on both sides, with green parsley-leaves, and a small group of crayfish. Set the ‘pain-vert’ on a stand in fat, constructed as shown in the engraving; surround the base of the ‘pain-vert’ with large ‘croûtons’ of jelly ; and fix on the cen- tre of the piece, above the stem, a subject, modelled in fat, representing the death of Vatel. This stand, of light shape, is mounted on an iron triangle. The stand is partly cast, and partly carved with the knife. The children, supporting the cup, may he cast in ‘gelatine’.* 200. Slice (darne) of salmon, tmtter-sauce. — Cut off a ‘dame’ of salmon of about three inches wide; scale, draw, and wipe it carefully; then salt along all its surface. Slice two large onions, fry them with oil, and when of a nice color, moisten them with two bottles of white wine. Add to the above a bunch of parsley, and a few cloves; let the liquid boil for ten or twelve minutes. Three quarters of an hour previous to serving, plunge the ‘darne’ of salmon into this stock ; boil, and remove the stewpan back, keeping the liquid at the same * The size of this book did not allow me to enter into minute descriptions referring to the construc- tion of stands: those who take an interest in informing themselves on this point, may consult the ‘Artistic Cookery’ ; where the ornamentation of cold dishes and pastry is extensively treated.FISH. 87 degree without boiling. Half an hour after, drain the fish, dish it up, and mask with the following sauce: Butter-sauce. — Melt four ounces of butter in a stewpan, mix into it four oun- ces of flour, working it with a spoon to form a smooth paste. Dilute it with about a pint of the salmon-liquor, drained, and nearly cold; stir the sauce on the fire, and at its first bubbling take it off. Thicken with two diluted yolks of eggs, and gradually introducing into it five ounces of butter, continue stirring it; finish with the juice of a lemon, and a pinch of chopped parsley. 201. Cold salmon, ravigote-sauce. (D. 19.) — Choose a salmon weighing about eight or ten pounds; scale, and draw it by the gills; fill the hollow of the belly with a common force-meat of fish. Truss the head, place it on the drainer of a fitting i fish-kettle, laying it on its belly; moisten with a sufficient quantity of 'court-bouillon’ with wine, to cover it; let the liquid boil, then remove it back, keeping it simmering for an hour and a quarter. Then take the fish - kettle off the fire, to let the salmon cool in its liquor; lift it out, and let it drain for two hours. Spunge the salmon with a cloth, dish it on an oval decorated 'pain-vert’, placed on an oval dish; prop up the fish, and mask its central part with a layer of frothy butter, mixed up with crayfish- butter, but of a light hue. Smooth the butter nicely, adorn it with truffles, cray- fish-tails, fillets of anchovy, green taragon-leaves, whole capers, gerkins, and chop- ped aspic, squeezed through a cornet. Surround the salmon, at its base, with chopped aspic; garnish the top of the 'pain-vert’ with a circle of halves of hard-boiled eggs, the yolks of which are decorated with a round of truffle. Surround the base with large ‘croûtons’ of aspic, insert with a skewer on the top of the fish a 'hâtelet’, composed of three crayfish of graduated size and a small truffle. Send up separately two boatfuls of'ravigote’-sauce. This preparation is well fitted for salmon brought out of shape by cooking.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 88 202. Salmon on the banks of the Rhine. — Cook three pounds of good sourcrout according to the usual rules. Take a good piece of a fresh Rhine-salmon, which cut into slices (about thirty of which will be required); beat them slightly, and pare them into scollops. Season, and place half of them on a plate. Put the other half into a buttered sauté-pan. Boil, in white wine, about forty middling-sized crayfish; put by six of the finest, removing the tails and shells of the smallest ones to prepare some crayfish-butter. At the same time, blanch five dozen oysters. Prepare half a pound of ‘quenelle’ force-meat of pike; which finish with a piece of crayfish-butter ; and scooping it off with the spoon, mould four dozen middling-sized ‘quenelles’. Prepare a little light brown ‘roux’; dilute it, by degrees, with the oyster and crayfish liquor, as well as with a little fish-broth, mixed with the trimmings and bones of the pike and salmon. Thicken the sauce, stirring it, until boiling; remove it back, and let it simmer for half an hour. Skim off its fat, pass it through a tammy, reduce it, thicken with a liaison of two yolks of eggs, and keep it in the ‘bain-marie.’ A quarter of an hour before serving, bread-crumb the pickled scollops, and color them on both sides with clarified butter. Fry the remainder on a sharp fire, drain them of the butter, add the ‘quenelles’ and poached oysters, as well as the crayfish- tails. Mask these garnishes with the prepared sauce, and keep the ‘ragout’ hot. When ready to serve, drain all the moisture off the sour-crout, thicken with two spoonfuls of sauce ; pile it up on a dish, leaving a hole in the centre ; which fill with the ‘ragout’ offish, on the top of which set the six crayfish put by, whole, but with their tails picked. Surround the sourcrout, at its base, with the fried scollops, and serve it immediately. 203. Broiled slices of salmon, with hot mayonnaise-sauce. — Cut three or four slices of salmon; season, and baste them with oil; place them side by side on a gridiron, previously wanned, and well rubbed with an oiled paper. Broil the slices on a moderate fire, baste with oil (by the aid of a paste-brush); after- wards turn them, and finish cooking them. Dish them up, pour over a little oil, and serve separately the following sauce : Hot mayonnaise - sauce. — Prepare a mayonnaise with three raw yolks of eggs, proceeding according to the usual method. When finished, pour it into a small stew- pan, to warm it on a slow fire, stirring it with a spoon. As soon as it begins to curdle, remove it back, work it quickly, adding by degrees a little cold water. Con- tinue working, till it becomes smooth again; then warm it anew, always stirring, but without letting it boil. Finish it, off the fire, by mixing into it a tablespoonful of mustard, a little vinegar, and a pinch of chopped parsley.FISH. 80 204. Head (‘hûre’) of salmon, anchovy-sauce (D. 20). — Take half a middling-sized salmon (the head-end) ; scale, draw, and wash it inwardly, then dry it with a cloth; fasten the head to the body with string, and set it on a fish-drainer of requisite size, laying it on the belly. Shake over two good handfuls of salt, and moisten, till covered, with white wine and water; set the fish-kettle on the fire; cover it, and at the first bubbling of the liquid, remove the kettle back, letting the fish sim- mer gently. Fig. 20. T1 iree quarters of an hour after, drain the fish, and dish it on a folded napkin; garnish it round with green parsley, and a few groups of boiled potatoes. Serve separately the following sauce*; Sauce of anchovy-extract. — Prepare a butter-sauce according to the receipt No. 200; when well buttered, finish with the addition of two or three tablespoonfuls of English anchovy-extract. If this be not handy, introduce into the above a little piece of anchovy-butter. 205. Salmon-salad, with jelly. — Take about two pounds of boiled cold salmon, trim the skin and bones away, divide the flesh into squares, which place in a dish ; season, and baste them with oil and vinegar. Have a plain border-mould embedded in pounded ice; adorn the bottom and sides with gerkins, whites of eggs, fillets of anchovy, and capers, always dipping the details into half set-aspic. Fill the mould, by degrees, with cold jelly. Twenty minutes previous to serving, turn the border out on to a cold dish, fill half the centre with chopped aspic-jelly, on which place the squares of salmon in layers, alternated with egg-mayonnaise-sauce. Send up separately a boatful of mayonnaise - sauce. 206. Cold salmon-pie, with truffles. — Cut two pounds of raw sal- mon into middling-sized squares, lard them with fillets of truffles and anchovies, season with salt and spices; fry them a few minutes with butter in a stewpan. Then90 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. pour over half a glass of sherry, which must be reduced; remove the stewpan back, add to the fish a pound of peeled raw truffles, cut in quarters and seasoned; cover the stewpan, and let all the ingredients cool together. Chop very fine ten ounces of lean pork, or veal, with the same quantity of raw pike, or eel. Add to this mince a pound of fresh fat bacon, pound the whole together, and pass it through a sieve. Season well the force-meat with salt, and spices; and add to the above the trimmings of truffles, pounded with a little bacon, and passed through a sieve. Prepare a short-paste in the conditions prescribed in No. 196. Butter a cold- pie mould of either round or oval shape, which set on a baking-sheet covered with paper, line it with two thirds of the paste, and mask the bottom and sides with a thin layer of force-meat ; fill the hollow with the squares of fish, with the truffles and force-meat mixed, range the preparation in a dome-shape fashion, rising above the rim of the mould, mask it with little slices of bacon, then with a thin round flat, made with the remainder of the paste. Cover the pie, pinch, decorate, and give it a nice color; push it into a moderate oven. Seven or eight minutes afterwards, cover it entirely with paper: bake it for two hours; then remove it from the oven; and half an hour after having been taken out, pour into the hollow on the top, two glass- fuls of aspic-jelly, mixed with a little madeira. A quarter of an hour after, take out the mould; and let the pic cool for twenty- four hours, previous to being served. 207. Head (‘Imre’) of salmon, Dieppe fashion. — Get the head-piece of a very fresh salmon; cleanse it thoroughly, salt it slightly, and wrap it in thin layers of fat bacon; which fasten with string. Place the fish in an oval stewpan, moisten it with half a glass of sherry, to which add the peel of six fresh truffles, a bunch of aromatics, thyme, laurel, basil, and parsley. Cover the stewpan, fasten the lid with paste, then set it in a moderate oven, and stew the head for two or three hours, according to its size. When ready to serve, take the stewpan out, pass the liquid through a sieve, skim off' its fat ; reduce, and thicken it with a little sauce; add the six raw truffles cut in quarters. The truffles being cooked, finish the sauce with the juice of two lemons, and a little chopped parsley. 208. Gudgeons, ‘au gratin’. — Get some large gudgeons ; scale, and take the heads off ; wash, and wipe them on a cloth. Butter a ‘gratin’-dish, spread the bot- tom with a layer of cooked fine-herbs (onions and fresh mushrooms) ; on which range the gudgeons symmetrically in two rows, one beside the other, placing them on the belly, their tails turning to the centre. Salt and sprinkle them with cooked fine-herbs and chopped parsley. On the first layer of fish place a second one, sprinkle it with91 FISH. fine-herbs and crumb of bread, pour on the bottom of the dish half a glass of white wine, baste the top with butter, and bake the gudgeons in a hot oven for ten minutes ; serve them immediately. 209. Salad of (iershis) gudgeon-perch (D. 20). — The gudgeon- perch are found often enough in the markets of Germany, and even of Paris ; but at St. Petersburg they are most plentiful and most highly esteemed. They may be purchased alive, and are therefore naturally of more value and better quality. In its form the gudgeon-perch is exactly like the perch, only being much smaller: its flesh is white and dainty. With the gudgeon-perch an excellent soup is prepared in Russia. Take out the fillets of a few dozen ‘iershis’; trim, season, and range them on the bottom of a flat stewpan or baking-sheet, thickly spread with butter. Baste with a little white wine, poach them on a sharp fire, and cool them in their liquor. Drain them on a cloth, season, baste again with a little oil, and sprinkle over some chopped parsley. Dish them up afterwards, in a dome-like fashion, on the centre of an aspic-border, and mask with à layer of mayonnaise-sauce. Surround the dome at its base with a circle of halves of hard-boiled eggs, decorated with a round of truffles. Set on the top a half-egg, garnished with vegetables. Serve separately a boatful of mavonnaise-sauce. 210. Perch, with mayonnaise-sauce. — Take out the fillets of three or four middle-sized perch; season, and place them on the buttered bottom of a flat stewpan; baste with a little white wine, and boil them, keeping them a little firm; after which let them cool. Divide them afterwards in two parts; season, and baste them with oil and vinegar, keep them thus for an hour ; then range them into an aspic border in alternate layers, masking each layer with mayonnaise - sauce ; mount them in a dome-like fashion, and cover the top also with mayonnaise-sauce.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 92 211. Perch, Silesian-sauce. —Draw two or tliree fine perch, without scaling, and wash them carefully. Pour some hot water into a stewpan ; add a bunch of parsley, a pinch of salt, a little vinegar, and boil it. Twelve minutes previous to serving, plunge the perch into the boiling liquid, boil it a while, cover the stewpan, remove it back, and keep it thus for a quarter of an hour. Then take out the perch (with the skimmer), carefully remove the scales, dip them one by one in their own liquor, wipe them on a cloth, and dish them up, % masking them with the following sauce: Silesian-sauce. — Pour into a stewpan the third of a glass of good vinegar ; add a few sprigs of parsley, a little taragon, two chopped shalots, a bay-leaf, and peppercorns ; reduce the liquid to half, pass, and let it cool ; mix with it four table- spoonfuls of melted glaze, six raw yolks of eggs, four ounces of butter, and a little salt ; stir the sauce on a very slow fire, to thicken it, without letting it boil. Place the sauce in the ‘bain-marie’, and whisk it, introducing a piece of butter, the size of an egg, in little bits. When frothy, mix four tablespoonfuls of brown-sauce, and two spoonfuls of grated and chopped horse-radish. Now remove the stewpan back, pass the sauce, and finish, by adding a few capers, and a little chopped parsley. 212. Perch, with wine. — Take and cleanse a few middling-sized perch, arrange them, one beside the other, in a flat stewpan thickly buttered ; season, and moisten, to their height, with white wine; sprinkle over them some chopped parsley; boil them, covered, on a brisk fire, so that, the perch being done, the liquid is reduced to half; then thicken with a piece of knead ed-b utter ; afterwards range the perch on a dish, and baste them with the sauce. 213. Boiled perch, Dutch fashion. — Boil some water with a little salt, vinegar, some sprigs of parsley, and two bay-leaves; add to the liquid two perch, cleansed but not scaled ; which boil, then cover the stewpan, and remove it back. Twelve or fifteen minutes later, drain the fish, removing the skin and the scales together; wash them in their own liquor, and dish them up, surrounded with parsley, and lemons cut in quarters. Serve separately a boatful of plain melted butter, mixed with a little salt, the juice of a lemon, and chopped parsley. 214. Dutch. Salted herrings. — The first salted herrings landed in Holland are often sold at a very high rate, for the Dutch make a point of eating the first arrivals ; their price then rises beyond all proportion to their scarcity. Some amateurs at the Hague have paid prices for herrings, which would appear fabulous to any one but a Dutchman. Salted herrings are in some countries much neglected, which isFISII. 93 quite wrong ; for they constitute a wholesome and aperitive food. Herrings moreover possess the advantage of needing but simple preparation, and withal are very cheap. Wash the herrings, wipe them; dry, and remove the skin ; then cut them in pieces, and put them back in form on a dish ; season them with oil and vinegar, and garnish them with new onions, gerkins, capers, sliced salted cucumbers, and pickles. The herrings, when old, should be steeped for a few hours in cold milk, before seasoning them. 215. Russian ‘coulibiac’ (D. 22). — Take out the fillets of seven or eight small trouts, and of two dozen small perch; season these fillets, mix with them a few dozen crayfisli-tails, and keep them on ice. Fig. 22. With a pound of‘soudac’, pike, or whiting flesh, prepare some ‘quenelle’ force- meat; when passed through a sieve, mix with it four tablespoonfuls of cooked fine-herbs. Boil, in plenty of water, ten ounces of rice, keeping the grains whole and firm; drain it on a sieve, put it into a stewpan, and add five ounces of butter ; season, and close the stewpan hermetically, keeping it at the entrance of the oven for ten minutes ; then remove the rice back, and let it cool. ‘Coulibiac’-paste. — Dilute about an ounce of good yeast with a glass of warm milk; pass the liquid, through a sieve, into a kitchen-basin; and prepare a leaven, introducing as much flour as it can absorb, keeping the paste soft. Cover, and put it into a warm place, to rise. When ready, introduce gradually twelve ounces of flour, eight ounces of butter scarcely melted, a little milk, and six whole eggs. Work the paste, to give it a little consistence, gather it up, cover it, and let it rise again previous to using it. Spread, on a floured napkin, a flat of‘coulibiac’-paste more long than wide; mask the centre of this flat with a layer of the prepared force-meat, on which place a layer of cold rice. On this rice put the fillets of fish in layers, intermixing each layer with fine-herbs, cooked, and thickened with a little cold sauce. Mask the fish with the remainder of the force-meat, then raise the paste over the preparation, solder it carefully, and turn the pie out on a baking-sheet. Let the paste rise in a warm temperature for twenty minutes. Moisten with a paste-brush dipped in butter,COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 94 then sprinkle over a handful of bread-crumbs, and bake the pie in a moderate oven for one hour ; send up separately a boatful of brown-sauce, reduced with white wine. 1 am firmly persuaded that this kind of paste would be well received in Eng- land ; and I earnestly recommend my 'confreres’ to make trial of it. These pasties may be prepared with salmon, perch, or turbot. 21G. Cold pie Of eel-pout livers. — Livers of eel-pouts are fat, and white, like those of the Strasburg geese or the Toulouse ducks ; but in these conditions they are unknown in England, or in France. It is in Poland, and Russia, that they most abound : they are neither so fine, nor so numerous, in Germany. Blanch four or five livers, in acidulated water, without boiling them; let them cool in the water, then cut them in squares, which put into a kitchen-basin ; add ten or twelve ounces of raw truffles, cut in quarters; season with salt, and spices, and baste them with a few spoonfuls of sherry. Pound the trimmings of the livers, with two or three truifles, and a few anchovy-fillets. Chop a pound of bacon, and as much of the flesh of pike ; which mix into the trimmings of liver, pound them together; season the force-meat, and pass it through a sieve. Butter a cold pie-mould, which set on a baking-sheet, covered with thick paper, and line it with short-paste. Spread, on the bottom, and sides of the mould, a layer of force-meat, fill the hollow with the eel-pout livers, intermixed with truffles alternated with force-meat ; mount the pie in a dome-like shape ; cover, and finish it according to the usual way, baking it for two hours. Half an hour after being taken out of the oven, pour in at the top, all round the pie, about two gills of aspic-jelly mixed up with a little sherry. Serve the pie only when completely cold. 217. Herring-salad, German fashion. — Take out the fillets of four or five salted herrings, remove the bones carefully, and cut them in dice ; do the same with a few boiled, cooled, and peeled potatoes, a raw apple, a piece of cold roasted veal, a piece of pickled beet-root, a few gerkins and salted cucumbers. Previously put into a deep dish the boiled potatoes, raw apples, and meat; season with salt, oil, vinegar, mustard, and a pinch of chopped chives. Mix well all these ingredients, by tossing them together in the dish. Add to the above the flesh of the herrings, with the gerkins, cucumber, beet-root, and a handful of capers. This done, thicken the salad with a few spoonfuls of mayonnaise-sauce with eggs, dish it in a dome-shape, smooth the surface with a knife, and mask it with a layer of mayonnaise. Adorn with anchovy-fillets, gerkins, capers, maise, and cherries in vinegar ; as well as with a few hearts of lettuce placed on the centre. Surround the salad with 'croûtons’ of aspic-jelly.FISH. 95 218. Brill, Paris fashion (D. 23). — A thick and fresh brill is a fish, which, well prepared and richly garnished, may form an exquisite dish, and acceptable even in a choice dinner. Cleanse the brill, wash it well, and wipe it on a cloth; score it on the black side all along the spine-bone ; place it on a large gratin-dish, thickly spread with butter; salt, and moisten it, to its height, with white wine ; add a minced onion, and a few trimmings of mushrooms. Let it boil, and at the first bubbling remove it back. Fig. 23. Prepare a garnish composed of about twenty fresh button-mushrooms, boiled at the time with butter and lemon-juice, three dozen large oysters poached in white wine, a few peeled truffles, boiled in wine and cut up in large slices ; and a few flat oval fish ‘quenelles’, rolled on a floured table and poached at the time. Boil in a ‘court-bouillon’ about twenty live crayfish. With four ounces of butter, the same of flour, and the liquor of the brill, passed through a sieve, prepare a white-sauce somewhat thick. When the sauce is passed, pour it into a flat stewpan, mix with it half the liquor of the mushrooms and the oysters ; reduce it on a sharp fire, introducing by degrees the remainder of the oyster- and mushroom - liquor. When sufficiently reduced, thicken with two diluted yolks of eggs, passed through a sieve, cook this preparation without boiling, then remove the sauce back, and introduce into it four ounces of butter (of the best quality), and at last a small piece of red butter, prepared with crayfish- shells : all of this is added gradually, continuing to stir the sauce, and not letting it boil. When ready to serve, drain the fish, place it on an oval dish, and surround it at both extremities, on one side with a group of white button-mushrooms, on the other, with a group of trimmed oysters. Mask the brill, and garnishes, with half of the sauce ;COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 90 place on the centre of the fish a few crayfish-tails, alternated with button-mushrooms and truffles, disposing them in the order of the drawing. Set on each side of the brill a few Hat ‘quenelles’, alternated with slices of black truffle ; sauce the ‘quenelles’ slightly, put two crayfish on each side of the dish, between the ‘quenelles’ and groups ; pour the remainder of the sauce into a sauce-boat. A large sole, or even several together, may be dished in the same way. 219. Farced, herrings. — Select a dozen very fresh herrings; remove their heads, as well as the thin parts of the tails ; open the herrings all up the back, in order to remove the bone ; keep the soft-roes ; fill the hollow of the herrings with some fish ‘quenelle’ force-meat, mixed up with cooked fine-herbs, add the soft-roes; bring the fish back into form, wrap each of them in a strip of buttered paper, put them on a buttered baking-sheet, and let them bake in a moderate oven for twelve or fifteen minutes. As soon as done, unwrap them, dish, mask with some chopped sauce, or else some ‘maître-d’hôtel’-sauce. 220. Cnrry of fresh herrings. — Cleanse ten herrings, draw them, wash their soft-roes, and blanch them in acidulous water. Slice one onion, fry it with butter in a flat stewpan, sprinkle over two table- spoonfuls of curry-powder ; two minutes after, dilute this paste with two glasses of white wine, and a little fish-broth. Add a pinch of parsley-leaves, a bay-leaf, and a little salt; boil the sauce, and put the herrings, side by side, in the stewpan, the liquid exactly covering them. Boil it a few seconds, cover the stewpan, and remove it back. Ten minutes afterwards, take out the herrings with a skimmer, and dish them with the soft-roes. Thicken the sauce with a liaison of yolks of eggs, and pour it over the herrings, passing it through a fine colander. 221. Soft-roes (laitances) of herrings ‘au gratin’. — Get about fifteen fine soft-roes ; wash them in cold water ; plunge them into boiling water, to get firm ; drain, and dry them on a cloth. Chop one onion, fry it in butter without coloring it; add a few spoonfuls of fresh chopped mushrooms. Their moisture having evaporated, add the soft-roes, season them with salt, nutmeg, and a point of cayenne ; warm them until well set, and place them by layers on a gratin-dish, sprinkling over each layer a little chopped parsley and bread-crumb. Baste with a spoonful of melted glaze, mixed up with a little sherry. Remove the ‘ragout’ back, sprinkle the top also with bread- crumb and chopped parsley ; pour some butter over, and push the dish into a moderate oven, to gratinate the roes for twelve minutes. Serve them on the same dish.FISH. 97 222. Red-herrings (harengs-saurs), with fine-herbs (‘fines- herbes’). — Take away the heads of a dozen good red-herrings, open them up the back, separate the fillets, and remove the roes ; pick the bones from the meat ; which, as well as the roes, steep in milk for a couple of hours. Fry a few spoonfuls of fine-herbs with mushrooms ; their moisture having eva- porated, mix therewith a good handful of rasped bread-crumb, and a spoonful of chopped parsley. Drain the herrings fillets and roes, dry them well on a cloth, trim away the skin off the fillets ; range them on a gratin-dish, sprinkled previously with fine-herbs, intermingling them with the roes. Shake over the first layer some fine- herbs, and pour on them some melted butter : continue thus, alternating the fillets and fine-herbs, not neglecting to baste them with butter. Bread-crumb the top, and push the dish into a moderate oven ; in which keep it for ten or twelve minutes. It suffices to warm the fillets ; the dish being taken out of the oven, baste the herrings with the juice of two lemons ; and serve it. 223. Fillets of mackerel, ‘au gratin’. — Take out the fillets of three mackerel ; trim away the belly-parts, remove the skin, and salt them. Butter an oval gratin-dish, sprinkle it over with a pinch of chopped onion, a little parsley, and a few spoonfuls of chopped mushrooms. Pour over these fine- herbs four tablespoonfuls of brown-sauce, and as much of white wine. Then put on it the fillets of mackerel ; which sprinkle likewise with mingled fine-herbs and a little bread-crumb. Baste them with melted butter, and push the dish into a moderate oven. Bake the fish a quarter of an hour, basting it from time to time ; and serve it on the same dish. 224. Soft-roes of mackerel, in small cases. — Boil two quarts of water in a stewpan, with salt, a little vinegar, and a bunch of parsley ; plunge the soft-roes (about fifteen of which are required) into the liquid ; boil them, and remove the stewpan back ; two minutes after, drain the roes with a skimmer, and dry them on a cloth. Chop a small onion, fry it in butter, mix with it a handful of chopped mushrooms ; stir them on the fire, until their moisture has evaporated, and thicken them with four tablespoonfuls of ‘béchamel’-sauce, reduced with a little glaze. Boil the sauce for two minutes ; remove it back , and finish with a small piece of anchovy-butter. Oil two small square paper-cases, the bottom of which mask with a thin layer of fine-herbs, on which place two or three cut roes, seasoned, and sprinkled with a little chopped parsley ; mask them slightly with some fine-herbs ; then range the cases on a dish, warm them for two minutes in the oven, and serve them immediately. 798 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 225. Boiled mackerel, parsley-sauce. — Open, up the back, two fresh and cleansed mackerel ; put them into a stewpan, cover them with cold water ; add salt, a little vinegar, a bay-leaf, and a sprig of parsley ; set the stewpan on the fire, to bring the liquid to ebullition, giving it two babblings ; cover the stewpan, keeping it for twelve minutes removed back. Drain the fish, dish it up, and pour oven the following sauce : Parsley-sauce. — Put into a stewpan four ounces of butter, with the same of flour ; work them together to form a paste ; which moisten with some fish-broth, or with water simply boiled with a bunch of fresh parsley, then cooled. Add to the above a few peppercorns, some grated nutmeg, and the juice of a lemon; stir the sauce on a moderate fire, keeping it a little consistent. At the first bubbling, remove it back, and introduce into it, by degrees, four ounces of butter; work, until all the butter be absorbed ; then strain it, mix therewith a pinch of chopped parsley, and serve. 22G. Fillets of mackerel, with anchovy-cream. — Trim the fillets of three mackerel, without removing their skin ; season them. Melt a quarter of a pound of butter, which pour into a sauté-pan (sautoir)] heat it to a high degree. Then arrange the fillets of mackerel, side by side, on the bottom of the stewpan ; fry them on both sides, turning them, without breaking them. Arrange them on a dish, surround with two dozen blanched and trimmed oysters, then mask with the following sauce : Anchovy - cream - sauce. — Pour into a flat stewpan about a glass and a half of ‘béchamel’- sauce, reduced on the fire, stirring, and gradually introducing the oyster-liquor. When the sauce is quite frothy, remove it back, and finish with a tablespoonful of anchovy-extract, mixed with a piece of butter. 227. Eel broiled. — Previous to cooking, eels should be skinned : for which operation, first hang them up by the head, make a slight incision all round the neck, thus loosening the skin, then with the aid of a dry cloth, draw it; cut off the head and fins, remove the gut; wash, wipe, and roll it up in a spiral way, sup- porting it thus with two iron skewers placed crosswise. Put it on a gridiron, and singe it on both sides for a few seconds, thus setting the flesh. Mince two onions, put them into a flat stewpan with oil, fry them to a nice color ; moisten them with half a bottle of vinegar, and the same of water ; add some salt, peppercorns, cloves, a handful of parsley, thyme, and bay-leaf ; boil the liquid for seven or eight minutes, and plunge in the eel ; the liquid should cover it. At the first bubbling remove the stewpan on to a moderate fire, cover it. Boil the fish gently for forty or fifty minutes ; remove the stewpan back. One hour after, carefully take out the eel without breaking it. Drain it on a sieve', and leave it to99 FISH. get quite cool. Afterwards^ rub it all over with oil, by the aid of a paste-brush ; season it with salt, pepper, and chopped parsley; roll it in bread-crumbs place on a gridiron, and warm it on both sides, on a moderate fire, for three quarters of an hour. Dish it up, and serve separately a boatful of warm mayonnaise or tartar-sauce. 228. Eel with Montpellier-butter (D. 24). — Take an eel well cleansed, remove its head and thin end;' open it up the whole length, in order to remove the spine-bone, and to diminish the thickness of the meat; season, and Fig. 24. fill it with a force-meat, of fish, if required to be lean; or if not, with a good ‘galantine’ force-meat, prepared with the flesh of pike and fat bacon, in equal parts, pounded with a little panada. The force-meat being passed through a sieve, add a ‘salpicon’, composed of truffles, fat liver, and pistachios. Sew the ‘galantine’, tie it up in a fine cloth, truss it, and boil it in a ‘court-bouillon’ for two hours. Drain it after- wards, take it out of the cloth, wrap it up again; score, and roll it in a spiral way, forming it like a pyramid, in a stewpan, and round a dome-shaped mould. Let it cool entirely, take it out of the cloth, divest it of the thread, and put it on a decorated ‘pain-vert’, having on its centre a support in form of a dome. Adjust the head again (boiled separately) to the ‘galantine’, mask it with a thin coating of Montpellier-butter (see No. 85), ornament it with anchovy - butter, squeezed through a cornet ; surround its base with a thick string of jelly, and afterwards with a circle of hard-boiled eggs in quarters. Place round the ‘pain- vert’ some bold ‘croûtons’ of aspic-jelly, and serve separately a sauceboatful of mayonnaise. 229. Eel on the spit. — Skin a good large eel ; cut it transversally into pieces, two inches long; which place in a kitchen-basin, season them with salt, pepper, oil, minced onion, parsley, and lemon-juice ; steep them in this seasoning100 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. for two or three hours. Afterwards, run an iron skewer (transversally) through them, alternating each piece with a slice of bacon and a bay-leaf ; fix the piece hy hotli ends to the spit, thus roasting the eel. Pour some oil into the dripping-pan, add two tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley, and the juice of two lemons. Baste the eel with this oil ; when three-parts done, bread-crumb it. Take it otf the spit, and dish it up, without separating the single pieces, but after having removed the skewer. Send up separately a boatful of hot tartar-sauce. 230. Smoked eels, Swedish fashon. — Get some middling-sized eels, skin them, let them lie to macerate in salt for some hours ; wipe, and hang them up on some hooks by their heads, placed at a distance from each other, at the bottom inside of an overturned tun, open on the one side. Put this tun on three bricks disposed round a half-dying fire, which keep up with small pieces of bark of resinous wood, thus concentrating in the tun a thick warm smoke. Five or six hours afterwards, the eels will be smoked and cooked at the same time. Divide them into pieces, which freed of the skin, place in a kitchen-basin; season, and baste them with oil and vinegar. Prepare a salad of mixed vegetables composed of ’boiled potatoes, beet-root, celery, boiled carrots, gerkins, salted cucumber (‘ogursis’), pickled ‘cèpes’, and capers: all these vegetables (except the capers), cut up in small pieces, seasoned, basted with oil and vinegar, and thus left for two hours. When ready to serve, put these vegetables into a border-mould, pressing them slightly. Turn the border out . on a dish, place the pieces of eel in its centre, and baste them with their seasoning. 231. Small eels of the Tiber, with green-peas. — Take five or six small eels of the thickness of a finger; kill them, remove their head and skin, dividing their body into pieces. Chop one onion, fry it with a little butter or oil ; add the pieces of eel ; season, and toss them over a brisk fire, reducing their moisture. Then mix therewith a pint of fresh green-peas, add a bunch of parsley, a little salt and pepper; cover the stewpan, and stew the whole removed back from the fire, covering the lid with embers. When the peas are done, thicken the stew with kneaded-butter ; remove the bunch, and dish the fish. This is a dish highly esteemed in Rome, where eels are very good ; it can be prepared, however, any where: only remember that the eels absolutely must he young, slender, and alive. 232. ‘Clovisses’ and ‘praires’ (shell-fish) for ‘hors-d’œuvre’. — The ‘clovisses’ of Marseille, and the ‘praires’ of Toulon, enjoy a great repute in theFISH. 101 South of France ; but Genoa and Naples also produce some very excellent ones. These shell-fish are only served alive ; as in losing their life, they also lose their quality. They are simply served on a deep dish with a little fresh water. 233. ‘Galantine’ of eel, with jelly (D. 25). — Prepare a ‘galantine’ of eel, proceeding as said in No. 288. When cold, cut it transversally in slices, not too thin ; which adorn with taragon or chervil-leaves, cover with a thin coating of aspic, pare, and keep them on ice. Fig. 25. Boil a few dozen small crayfish ; when cold remove their tails, which pick, pare, and keep them in a cool place. Let a plain border-mould be embedded in pounded ice ; adorn its sides with details of gerkins, cut in triangular forms, taking cai’e to dip them in half-set aspic; afterwards, fill the mould with jelly, and keep it on ice for one hour. When about to serve, dip the mould in hot water, in order to turn the border out on to a dish ; immediately fill the cavity of this border with a salad of vegetables, thickened with mayonnaise, dishing it up in pyramids, and placing the crayfish- tails all round, in circles, having dipped them in half-set jelly, to fix them. Place on the border a circle of slices of decorated ‘galantines’, glazed with aspic-jelly. Send up separately a sauceboatful of mayonnaise. 234. Hot eel-pie. — Kill a middling-sized river - eel ; skin it, cleanse it well, trim away its head, and divide the body into pieces, two inches long ; bone and season the flesh inwardly, and tie them up. Fry in butter three tablespoonfuls of chopped onion ; when of a nice color, add the pieces of eel, give them a jerk from time to time on the fire ; on which keep them for ten minutes, sprinkle over five or six spoonfuls of chopped mushrooms, and moisten with the quarter of a glass of madeira. Add to the above a bunch of parsley, garnished with aromatics; boil the pieces till their moisture be reduced, then pour over four tablespoonfuls of good glaze ; let it cool in the stewpan, and skim off it the string.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 102 At the same time, prepare a 'quenelle’ force-meat with about a pound and a half of the flesh of pike. Line a hot pie-mould with short-paste. Cover the bottom and sides with a layer of force-meat ; place the pieces of eel in the cavity, alternated with the fine-herbs; cover them, on the top, with a flat of paste regularly in the form of a crest ; and pinch it with the pastry - pincers. Adorn the dome with leaves, imitated in paste; egg the pie, and put it into the oven, to bake for one hour and a half. When done, dish it up, and make a circular opening on the top. Pour into a stewpan two gills of brown-sauce, a dozen raw button-mushrooms, and a few spoonfuls of madeira ; reduce the sauce on a brisk fire for six or seven minutes. Pour sauce and mushrooms into the pie ; cover it, and send it up. 235. Russian dartois (sausselis). — Cut a 'salpicon’ composed of cooked tails and claws of crayfish, oysters, blanched eel-pout livers, and cooked mushrooms ; thicken this 'salpicon’ with raw pike force-meat. Divide in two parts a pound of puff-paste (made at eight turns), and flatten each part into a thin oblong square. Put one of them on a thin baking-sheet, spreading the preparation over its surface, in equal layers, not too thick, and distant about half an inch from the edges ; wet these with a paste-brush. Cover the preparation and paste completely with the second flat ; fasten the paste on the sides with the thumb, cut its four sides straight, and egg the top-surface ; stripe it, as well as the 'dartois’, with the point of a knife, and push the baking-sheet into a moderate oven. As soon as the top is colored, cover it with paper ; when the 'dartois’ are quite done, take them out of the oven, divide the flat into oblong squares, about two inches and a half by one ; and dish them on a folded napkin. 236. Fricassée of pike, German fashion. — Get two middling-sized pike ; cleanse them, trim away the fins, and divide them in pieces ; which wipe on a cloth. Mince one onion, put it into a stewpan with butter, fry it for two minutes, add the pieces of pike, toss them on a good fire, season them with salt and pepper- corns. When the flesh is firm, sprinkle over two tablespoonfuls of flour, moisten gradually, till they are covered, with white wine and water; add a bunch of parsley, garnished with aromatics, a few peppercorns and cloves, and a handful of fresh trimmings of mushrooms. Boil the pike quickly, reducing the sauce one third. Take out the pieces of pike with a fork, wipe them on a cloth, and dish them up. Pass the sauce through a sieve, mix in a few morils cooked at the time, as well as their liquor freed of its fat; boil the sauce, and thicken with two or three yolks of eggs; finish with a little chopped parsley, pour it over the fish; surround the fricassée with a few crayfish body-shells, farced, and with the morils; sprinkle it with a few capers ; and place all round some fillets of anchovies, rolled up in a circular shape.FISH. 103 237. Pike, ‘soya’-sauce (D. 26). — Choose a gold-coated pike, weighing six or eight pounds; scale it, cleanse it, truss the head, and make small incisions on the back, the knife penetrating as deep as the spine-bone. Then place it, on its belly, on the drainer of a fish-kettle ; salt, and moisten till covered, with white wine and water, half and half. Add a few minced vegetables, a bunch of parsley, and some peppercorns. Set the tish-kettle on the fire, at the first bubbling remove it back, and Fig. 26. cook the fish, without ebullition, for one hour. Drain it, and slip it on to a dish covered with a napkin ; surround it with fresh parsley, and serve separately the following sauce : Soya-saucc. — With a pint of the fish-stock strained and cooled, prepare a butter- sauce (sec No. 2U1), keeping it a little thick; when of a little consistence, add two tablespoonfuls of good soya, and finish by introducing five ounces of good butter in small parts. 238. White-bait omelet, Neapolitan fashion. — Take two handfuls of white-bait (ianchetti) ; drain them on a cloth, and keep them on ice, until cooking- time. Break into a kitchen-basin seven or eight eggs ; which season with salt, pepper, and chopped parsley ; beat them with a whisk, and mix in the fish previously seasoned. Warm about a gill of oil or melted butter in a frying-pan ; pour in the beaten eggs with the fish, and thicken the omelet, stirring it slightly with a fork; turn them out with the aid of a plate, baste the bottom of the frying-pan with a little oil or butter, put the omelet again into it, to finish; and then without folding it, slip it on to a circular dish. 230. Pike, Polish fashion. — Select a fine river-pike, remove its skin, draw the fish, and divide it in thick pieces tronçons’). Mince a ‘julienne’ composed of carrot, celery, and parsley-roots ; slightly blanch these vegetables in salted water. Mince an onion, put it into a stewpan with butter, and fry till of a nice gold- color; add to the above the pieces of fish, season them, fry them for ten minutes, moisten to their height with white wine ; let the liquid boil, add to it the minced vegetables. Boil the fish, letting the liquid reduce to half; then thicken it with aCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 104 piece of kneaded-butter, and add to it two handfuls of 'nouilles’, minced like the vegetables, but boiled in salted water. Five minutes after, take the pieces of fish out, with the aid of a skimmer; remove the head, and dish the remainder. Mix into the sauce a piece of butter, and a little chopped parsley, and pour it on the fish. # 240. Broiled sole, Colbert-sauce. — Remove the black skin from a large sole ; cut otf, in a slanting direction, the bony part of the head ; draw the sole, wash it, spunge well, split on both sides in the middle ; season, roll in melted butter, bread-crumb, let broil on a moderate fire, turning it. Colbert-sauce is served, either round the fish, or else in a sauceboat. 241. Pike-boudins. -—- Take one pound of 'quenelle’ force-meat of pike, add four spoonfuls of fine-herbs, divide the force-meat into small parts, and roll these, on a floured table, into pieces three times the thickness of macaroni ; twist both the ends of each of these strings in a spiral fashion, and in the opposite direction, in a manner imitating a Capital S ; thrust a little wooden-skewer through each S, and arrange them side by side in a buttered sauté-pan ; put them in boiling salted- water to poach, drain them on a cloth, let them cool ; dip them into beaten eggs, bread-crumb, and fry them to a light color ; drain, and dish on a folded napkin. 242. Pike-cutlets, tomata-sauce. — Take a pound of raw pike-flesh, freed of skin and bones ; chop, and pound it with eight ounces of butter, season the force-meat, mix with it three tablespoonfuls of thick 'béchamel’, and two raw yolks of eggs ; divide the preparation into small parts ; which drop on a floured table, and roll with the hand into the shape of cutlets. Dip them in beaten eggs, bread-crumb, and color them on both sides, in a flat stewpan with clarified butter. Place them on a dish, the bottom of which is masked with tomata-sauce. 243. Pike-CUtletS, ‘à la Soubise’. — Prepare a 'quenelle’ force-meat with pike-flesh (No. 244), but with only a quarter of a pound of butter to a pound of flesh. Mince two or three onions, fry them in a stewpan with butter, until of a nice color ; season them with salt, nutmeg, and a bit of sugar ; sprinkle them with a pinch of flour, and dilute them with a little milk, thus obtaining a thickish sauce. Cook this on a moderate fire, until the onions are done ; then set the stewpan on a good fire, continually reducing the sauce, until rich, and of a nice consistence. Pass it through a sieve, let it cool, and mix it with the force-meat. Take out this force-meat with a spoon, divide it into pieces the size of an egg, which place on a floured table, roll them with the hand into the shape of a pear ; flatten the force-meat with theFISH. 105 blade of a knife, to half an inch thick ; then bending the pointed end of the force- meat will suffice to form the cutlets. Lift them with the blade of a knife, and arrange them side by side, on the bottom of a buttered sauté-pan. Poach them in boiling salted water, drain them, as soon as the force-meat is firm; let them cool, dip them in beaten eggs, bread-crumb, and fry them, with clarified butter, in a fiat stewpan; dish them up in a close circle, surrounding them with cut lemons, or pile up a garnish in the centre. 244. ‘Pain’ of pike, with truffles (D. 27). — With a pound and a quarter of the fiesh of pike, fourteen ounces of rice-flour panada, the same of butter, and four or five yolks of eggs ; prepare a ‘quenelle’ force-meat, proceeding as indicated for the ‘‘pain’ of whiting. Spread thickly with butter a cylindric mould ; against the sides of which set some slices of peeled and cooked truffles ; fill the mould, by degrees, with the force-meat, and poach it in the ‘bain-marie’ for forty minutes. On taking the mould out of the water, turn the ‘pain’ out on a dish, bearing on its centre a small support of fried bread ; into which insert a ‘bâtelet’- skewer garnished with shrimps. Mask the bottom of the dish with a good fish-sauce, reduced with the trimmings of the truffles, send up separately a sauce-boat of the same. 245. Pike, Potsdam fashion. — Choose a nice river-pike ; divide it into pieces, which put into a flat stewpan, and moisten, till covered, with white wine; season them, add a bunch of parsley, garnished with aromatics, and boil them on a good fire. Drain and pare them, placing the best pieces in a stewpan, and pass the stock through a sieve. Chop two onions, fry them in butter, sprinkle over them two tablespoonfuls of flour, moisten with the fish-stock, and stir the sauce on the fire until thickish ; remove it back, skim off its fat, pour it over the fish ; let this simmer for ten minutes, then addCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 10G two tablespoonfuls of whole capers, the same of gerkins and ‘ogursis’ cut in dice, a pinch of grated horse-radish, a pinch of chopped parsley, and the inside of two peeled lemons, cut up in slices. Finish the sauce, introducing a piece of butter, mixed with two tablespoonfuls of anchovy-extract. 246. Quenelles of pike, with mushrooms. — Cleanse a very fresh middling-sized pike, slip off the two fillets from the back-bone, trim away the skin, and cut the fish in pieces. To a pound of pike, take ten ounces of white bread- crumb, put it into a kitchen-basin, soak it in tepid water, and press it well out with the hands ; put it into a small stewpan with a few spoonfuls of milk ; let it boil, work- ing it with the spoon, till forming a compact paste ; then pound it, until cold and smooth. Take it out, to pound the pike-flesh ; which being made into a paste, add the panada, and a few minutes after , half a pound of fresh butter. Pound again the force-meat for five or six minutes longer, season it, and two minutes after, add three yolks of eggs, one after the other, without ceasing to pound. Then pass it through a sieve, put it into a kitchen-basin; smooth it, by working it with a spoon, and try a small part of it in boiling water. Then mould the ‘quenelles’ by aid of two table- spoons, proceeding as indicated for the ‘quenelles’ of chicken, placing them side by side in a flat stewpan, or on a bordered baking-sheet, previously buttered, and poach them in boiling salted water. Meanwhile, turn about fifteen fine button-mushrooms, and boil them with lemon- juice and butter. With the bones and head of the pike, with vegetables, trimmings of mushrooms, and wine; prepare a good fish-extract ; drain it, skim off its fat, and introduce it, by degrees, into three gills of reduced white-sauce ; add likewise the liquor of the mushrooms ; thicken the sauce with two or three yolks of eggs, and pass it through a tammy. At the last moment, finish it by introducing four ounces of good butter. Dish the ‘quenelles’ in a circular order, on a thin foundation of force-meat, poached on a dish ; fill the centre with the mushrooms ; which, as well as the ‘quenelles’, mask with the sauce. 247. ‘Pain’ Of pike, with crayfish. — Take out the fillets of a middling- sized pike, trim away the skin and the bones, pound the flesh (a pound) with half its volume of butter, a part of which is reddened with crayfish-butter ; season the force- meat; when smooth, pass it through a sieve, lay it in a kitchen-basin, to be worked for a few minutes ; introduce carefully one white of egg whipped, and double this quan- tity of whipped cream. Pour the force-meat into a mould, and poach it, in the ‘bain-marie.’ Afterwards turn the ‘pain’ out on a dish, mask it, with some reduced ‘bechamel-sauce, finished with crayfish-butter, and mixed with a few cut cray- fish-tails.107 FISH. 248. Seibling, Bavarian-sauce (D. 28). — This fish is a variety of the trout, though its shape is more like that of the grayling. The belly-skin of the seibling is red, and its coat is spotted with red dots surrounded bv a white circle, it is the prettiest eatable fish, I know of. When boiled very fresh, the back turns to a delicate blue, the belly, and the spots of its coat, remaining of a beautiful red. Fig. 28. Draw the fish by the gills, without scaling it, or even shortening the fins; truss the head, and place it, resting on its belly, on the drainer of a fish-kettle. Moisten to its height with half water and half white wine; add salt and a bunch of parsley ; let the liquid boil, and remove it back. Thirty or thirty-five minutes later, drain the fish, remove the string, and place it on an oval dish, on the centre of which is a fish- drainer covered with a folded napkin. Surround the seibling with fresh parsley, and send up separately a boatful of Bavarian-sauce. 249. Pike, Gypsey-fashion. — Chop one onion, fry it in oil, moisten it with light tomata-sauce, add a bunch of mint, and boil the liquid. Cut up a pike into rounds, flour, and fry them in oil ; drain, and place them side by side, in the stewpan containing the sauce ; let them simmer gently for twenty minutes. Take the bunch out, when serving the fish. 250. Pike, Russ fashion. — Cleanse a pike, weighing from four to six pounds, divide it transversally in pieces, which place in a stewpan, one beside the other ; salt, and add a few peppercorns, a bunch of parsley garnished with aromatics, and a few small whole onions ; baste them with clarified butter, fry them for ten minutes ; turn them, and baste with a pint and a half of sour cream ; as soon as the liquid boils, remove the pan back, and put some hot embers on its lid. An hour afterwards, take out the pieces offish with a skimmer, and put them on a dish. Pass the sauce into a stewpan, let it boil, thicken it with a piece of knead- ed-hutter, mix in a handful of capers, and pour it over the fish. 251. Pike, with sour-sweet sauce. — Cut up in lengths a pike weighing from four to six pounds, place them in a basin with a good handful of salt, and a little water, keeping them thus for one hour. Wash the pieces of pike, wipe108 COSM( )POLITAN COOKERY. them un a cloth ; flour, and arrange them, one beside the other, in a stewpan, spread on the bottom with butter; moisten, to three-parts their height, with vinegar; add a bunch of parsley with aromatics, a pinch of pepper, two tablespoonfuls of red-cur- rant jelly, two handfuls of raisins, and a few peeled shred almonds. Let the prepa- ration boil, close the stewpan hermetically, and put it on a very slow tire, with hot ashes on the lid, stewing the tish thus for one hour. When ready to serve, color the sauce with a few drops of caramel, and dish it up ; at each end of the dish, place a group of horse-radish forming stripes. 252. Curried tench. — Choose two or three good tench, plunge them into hot water ; as soon as boiling, remove them to be scaled ; then drain them, remove the fins, and divide them into pieces ; which steep for one hour in plenty of fresh water; drain, and dry them on a cloth. !Slice an onion, fry it in a stewpan with butter, add the pieces of tench, toss them over the fire for a few minutes, in order to get the fish dry and firm ; season, and sprinkle over them two tablespoonfuls of curry-powder, mixed with a little flour. Tavo minutes after, moisten the fish (till covered) with a glass of Avhite wine, and hot water; add a bunch of parsley, a bay-leaf, a little salt, peppercorns and cloves; cover the stewpan, and boil the tench for ten minutes ; remove the stewpan back. Ten minutes after, take out the pieces of tench with a fork, and dish them. Reduce the sauce quickly, and thicken it with two or three yolks of eggs, diluted with a little raw cream; cook the ‘liaison’ without letting it boil, finish it with the juice of a lemon, passing it through a sieve o\Ter the tench. 253. Stewed tench. — Cleanse two or three tench, leave them to macerate for a quarter of an hour Avith a handful of salt, then spunge, or Avipe them dry. Chop up a large onion, a carrot, and a piece of celery ; which vegetables fry in an oblong stewpan with oil or butter; add a bunch of parsley Avitli aromatics, a clove of garlic not peeled, pepper, cloves, and trimmings of fresh mushrooms; put in the tench, Avhich moisten to three parts of its height with white Avine ; boil the liquid, and five minutes afterwards, remove the stewpan back, putting hot embers on its lid. Thus steAv the tench for tAventy-five minutes ; take them out Avith a skimmer, and range them on a dish. Thicken the stock with a piece of kneaded-butter, boil it a Avhile, and pass it through a sieve. Finish the sauce Avith a pinch of cayenne, a pinch of chopped parsley, and the juice of a lemon ; pour it over the tench. 254. Tench, Silesian fashion. — Cleanse two tench, cut them up in pieces ; which arrange in a fiat stewpan with a small ‘julienne’, composed of celery and par- sley roots, carrots and onions ; these vegetables should be previously blanched. AddFISH. 109 a bay-leaf, cloves, peppercorns, ancl a bunch of parsley ; moisten the fish to its height with white wine, and boil it on a sharp fire for eight or ten minutes. Thicken the stock of the fish with a piece of kneaded-butter, keeping the stewpan on a moderate fire. When the fish is done, drain it with a skimmer, set it on a dish, re- move the hunch, and r.educe the sauce ; thicken it with a few yolks of eggs, finish it with the juice of a lemon, and a pinch of chopped parsley ; pour it over the tench. 255. Tench ‘au gratin’. — Sprinkle a gratin-dish with a pinch of chop- ped onions and shalots, a few spoonfuls of raw mushrooms, and a little parsley; all of them chopped up. Place on these fine-herbs two or three cleansed tench, side by side ; salt them, and sprinkle fine-herbs over them also ; haste them with oil or plain melted butter. Pour on the bottom of the dish half a glass of white wine, set it on the fire to boil the liquid, and push it into a moderate oven ; a quarter of an hour after, turn the tench out, mask them with the fine-herbs from the stewpan, and sprinkle over them a little bread-crumb. Pour on the bottom of the dish about a gill of brown-sauce, and ten minutes after, take it out of the oven ; set it on another dish, and send it up. 250. Quenelles of fogosh, Hungarian-sauce. — With about a pound of very fresh fogosh-flesh, divested of skin and bones, prepare a ‘quenelle’ force- meat, as said in No. 244: with this force-meat mould about fifteen ‘quenelles’ by the aid of two tablespoons, place them smoothly in a flat buttered stewpan, poach them in salted boiling water; drain them, as soon as firm, and range them in a circular order, on a foundation of foi’ce-meat, set on a dish. Pour over the following sauce: Hungarian-sauce. — Pour into a stewpan the third of a glass of plain cooked tomata-purée, well drained, and not thickened ; mix in the sauce, an equal quantity of good melted glaze, and a pinch of paprica. Boil the liquid, stirring it, and two minutes after, remove it back, gradually introducing into the sauce six ounces of butter divided in small pieces, but without ceasing to stir it. 257. White-bait (poisson blanc), English fashion. — White-bait' is that very nice white fish, called in Italy ‘ianchetti’, in Nice ‘poutin’, in Bor- deaux ‘blanchaille’. In order to get a treat of this fish, English epicures go to Green- wich. Even if it is not exactly to be called a popular dish ; it is undoubtedly in great request, and highly esteemed by ‘gourmets.’ The English fishmongers sell the white-bait in vessels containing some, of the same water, in which the fish were caught ; it will be sufficient, therefore, when the fish are to be fried, to drain them, a few at a time, in order to put them with some flour, into a colander ; then at once to roll them, in order to remove the superfluousCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 110 flour, to place them in a frying-grate, and thus to plunge them into hot hog’s lard, minding that none of the liquid escape from the pan : one minute will suffice to fry them. The fish being dry, and of a nice color, take them out with the grate; sprinkle them with salt, as well as with a pinch of cayenne ; dish them in a group on a folded napkin, and serve immediately. 258. Sturgeon, with piquant-sauce. — Cut a piece of sturgeon, off the side of the fish ; trim away the skin and bony parts ; interlard the flesh with fillets of bacon and anchovies, season it with salt, oil, and vinegar ; leave it to pickle for a few hours. Truss it neatly, and place it in a stewpan, garnished at the bottom, with trimmings of bacon and sliced vegetables ; moisten it (till covered) with half vinegar and half broth ; and set the stewpan on the fire, to boil the liquid ; skim it, cover the stewpan, and draw it over a moderate fire with live embers on the lid; then finish cooking the fish gently ; when done, pass the stock through a sieve, skim off its fat, let it boil, and thicken it with a little Toux’, in order to obtain a light sauce ; and keep it boiling on the side of the fire for a quarter of an hour. Skim its fat, and pass it through a tammy, adding to the above two tablespoonfuls of pickled gerkins cut into small dice ; take away the string from the sturgeon ; which put on a dish, and mask with the sauce. 259. Fricandeau of sturgeon, with olives. — Remove the skin of a fillet of sturgeon, beat the meat slightly with a cleaver, and lard it with bacon, like a 'fricandeau’ of veal ; blanch it, without boiling it ; drain, season, and put it into a flat stewpan, garnished with vegetables, and trimmings of ham ; moisten to its height with broth, and let the liquid boil until reduced to half; add a little white wine, cover the 'fricandeau’ with paper, and set the stewpan in a moderate oven, to bake the fish gently ; basting it often. When done, drain it on a dish, pour into the stock a little madeira ; boil, and pass it through a tammy ; carefully skim off its fat, and thicken with a piece of knfeaded-butter. Add five or six dozen Provence olives, freed of stones, and blanched.in water, without boiling. Then dish the 'fricandeau’ with the garnish. 260. Small Russ patties, with vesiga (D. 29, 30). — Divide six ounces of 'vesiga’ into small pieces; which put into a stewpan, with two quarts of water, and a little salt; boil it on a moderate fire, until it becomes tender, so that it may be easily bitten ; drain it on a sieve, chop it quickly, and keep it hot. Chop up an onion, fry it in butter, and mix with it two tablespoonfuls of celery and parsley roots, cut into small dice, blanched, and as much of raw 'gribouis’, like- wise cut in dice. Reduce the moisture of these vegetables ; season, sprinkle them with a pinch of flour, and moisten with a little broth, keeping the sauce very con-Ill FISH. sistent. Boil the liquid, stirring it ; add the chopped Vesiga’ ; two minutes after, remove the preparation off the tire, mix in four or live hard-boiled eggs, and a little chopped parsley. Flatten about a pound of short-paste very thin, divide it into small rounds with a tin-cutter two inches in diameter ; wet the edges of these rounds with a paste- brush, and put on the centre of each, a small part of the preparation, disposing it in Fig. 29. Fig. 30. the shape of an oval ‘quenelle’. This done, raise the paste on both sides, and solder it on the top of the preparation, forming a crust, which pinch with the fingers. Place the small patties on a baking-sheet, egg them over, bake them in a hot oven for twenty minutes. Take them off, and dish them on a napkin. The two drawings, accompanying this article, represent the patties, both in front, and in profile. 2G1. Sander boiled, Bavarian-sauce (D. 31). — Choose a silver- coated sander, weighing six or eight pounds; scale, and draw it; shorten its fins Fig. 31. score it transversally and slantwise on both sides, place it in a fish-kettle, sprinkle it with two or three handfuls of salt, and keep it thus for one hour. Wash it, and truss the head ; place the fish on its belly on the drainer of the fish-kettle ; and moisten with a sufficient quantity of cold water, and white wine, to cover it. Add the salt requisite, and a bunch of parsley ; put the kettle on the fire, to let the liquid boil ; remove it back, and keep it simmering for three quarters of an hour. When ready to serve,, drain the fish, remove the string, place it on an oval dish, covered with a napkin; surround it with parsley, rub the surfaces with butter, and send up separately the following sauce : Bavarian-sauce. — Put into a stewpan four tablespoonfuls of vinegar, reduce it to half, and remove it back from the fire. Mix into it four yolks of eggs, a piece of : good butter, the size of an egg, and a small piece of horse-radish. Beat the pre-COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 112 paration, add a little salt and nutmeg, stir it on a moderate fire, until thickish ; pass it, through a fine sieve, into another stewpan ; and add three ounces of good butter in little bits; set the stewpan over a slow fire; heat the preparation, in order to render it light and frothy, without allowing it to boil ; and finish with three ounces of crayfish-butter. 262. Sander, Dantzig fashion. — Blanch three dozen Holstein-oysters with a glass of white wine, pass the liquor through a sieve, let it settle to clarify. Wash the oysters, pare, and drain them on a cloth. Take two middling-sized live sanders ; kill them, scale, and cut off their fins ; draw them by the gills, and divide them into pieces ; which place, as well as the heads, in a flat stewpan ; add a hunch of parsley. Moisten the fish, about to its height, with white wine and the oysters’ liquor; add a handful of trimmings of raw mushrooms, and a piece of kneaded- butter in little bits. Close the stewpan hermetically, set it on a brisk fire, and boil the fish (without salt) for ten minutes, so that the stock may be reduced to half, about the time the fish is done. Take out the pieces of sander with a fork, and dish them ; reduce the sauce, and pass it, through a sieve, into another stewpan; boil, and thicken it with two diluted yolks of eggs ; cook the ‘liaison’, without boiling the sauce ; add the oysters, finish with a piece of butter, and the juice of a lemon ; pour it over the fish, and serve. 263. Soudac of the gourmets. — Get two middling-sized live ‘soudacs’, kill them, scale them, remove their gills, and cut them in pieces; draw, wash, and drain them on a cloth. Butter the bottom of a stewpan, which mask with thickly sliced fresh mushrooms ; salt them slightly, and place on them the pieces of fish ; which salt, moisten, to three parts of their height, with a glass of white wine, the juice of a lemon, and the liquor of two dozen blanched oysters. Add a bunch of parsley, a little piece of kneaded - butter (the size of a walnut), and a teaspoonful of curry-powder; cover the stewpan, set it on a brisk fire, and boil the fish for twelve minutes. Take out the pieces of soudac, without breaking them, one by one ; and place them on a hot dish. Remove the parsley, thicken the sauce with three yolks of eggs ; cook the liaison without boiling ; mix the oysters in the sauce, which pour over the pieces of fish. 264. Oyster-curry. — open five or six dozen large oysters, put them into a stewpan, with a glass of white wine; give them two boilings, and immediately throw them on to a sieve (preserving their liquor) ; wash, and dry them on a cloth; remove their beards, and tendons ; place them in a stewpan, and pour over them four tablespoonfuls of ‘veloute’-sauce with curry-powder ; bring the sauce to ebullition,FISH. 113 and thicken it with a few yolks of eggs, diluted with a little cream: cook the liaison without boiling, and turn out the oysters into the centre of a border of rice, previously arranged on a dish. 2G5. Oyster-patties (D. 32.) — Bake fifteen small puff-paste patties (bouchées)’ which empty on coming out of the oven, and set on a baking-sheet: they should be served as soon as possible, after being baked. Meanwhile, blanch two or three dozen oysters ; wash, pare, and divide each of them in two or three pieces. Pour about half a pint of good ‘bechamel-sauce’ into a stewpan ; add four tablespoonfuls of trimmings of fresh mushrooms, and a bunch of parsley ; reduce the sauce, stirring it, and gradually introducing the oyster-liquor, as well as a few spoonfuls of good raw cream ; when the sauce is become consistent and creamy, pass it, through a tammy, over the cut oysters. With this preparation fill the patties previously made hot ; dish them, in a group, on a folded napkin. 2GG. Soudac, Moscow fashion. — Scale the tail-end of a large ‘soudac’, and cut it in slices one inch thick; which place on the drainer of a fish-kettle, and plunge them into boiling salted water. Add a bunch of parsley, start the liquid to ebullition ; remove the kettle back, cover it, and keep it thus for ten minutes. Meanwhile, chop an onion, fry it in a Hat stewpan with butter, and when nicely colored, add two red pimentoes, and about a pound of picked and washed rice; fry this for two minutes only, and moisten it, three times its height, with fish-broth. Cover the stewpan, boil the liquid for ten minutes on a sharp fire ; remove it back, boiling the rice gently. A quarter of an hoiir after, the rice should be done, with its grains left whole, without being quite dry. Pour into it five or six spoonfuls of tomata-sauce, and keep it off the fire for five minutes ; finish if with a piece of butter, three dozen crayfish tails, and as many olives, stuffed with anchovies and pickled in oil. Pile them up on a hot dish. Carefully drain the pieces of soudac, dish them on the rice, bringing the tail back into shape ; moisten the fish with melted butter. sCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 114 267. Oysters, plain. — The Cancale and Ostend oysters are those generally consumed in Paris ; in London they eat oysters, which though called English or ‘native’ oysters, are of the same kind as those of Ostend. In the South of France, the cuiller or green oysters are famed; in Italy, those called ‘del fusaro’ have a great renown ; and in the North of Germany, the ‘Holstein’ oysters are generally preferred. All these species are good, nevertheless those of Ostend are generally most in request by ‘gourmets’. In order to serve oysters in the best condition, they should be opened, and immediately served, to be eaten alive ; therefore in opening oysters they are never removed from their shell, because an oyster may live on while opened, but not when entirely separated from its shell ; for it will die as soon as taken off. Not only are dead oysters a bad relish for ‘gourmets, but they may even prove injurious to health. Oysters are opened with a short-bladed knife, introducing it into the joint of the two shells taking care not to spill their liquid, and holding the oyster with a folded cloth for.more safety. When the two shells are separated, remove any fragments likely to stick to the oysters, and set them on a dish, covered with a folded napkin;* serve them with some ‘mignonette’, fresh butter, or buttered slices of bread, as well as with lemons cut in quarters. 268. Oyster ‘cromeskis.’ — Choose large oysters, open them, put their meat into a stewpan, add a little white wine, let them poach in this liquid: one minutes’ cooking will do. Drain them, let them cool ; beard them, remove the hard parts, cut them into middling-sized dice, put into a kitchen-basin. Reduce some large spoonfuls of good ‘béchamel-sauce’, stirring it, mix in to it gradually a part of the oysters’ liquor; when succulent, and well thickened, take it off the fire, and with it thicken the ‘salpicon’ of oysters ; leaving the preparation still thick ; finish it with a little nutmeg, let it cool, then divide it in pieces the size of an egg; flatten them, put each of them between two strips of pancake, prepared without sugar, or else between two strips of wafer-paste (hostie). Ten minutes previous to serving, dip the ‘cromeskis’ into some light frying paste (see No. 275), plunge them, one by one, into hot fat, giving them a fine color; drain them, dish them in a group on a folded napkin, and serve. 269. Crusts with oysters. — Cut some slices, off a loaf of household bread, nearly half an inch thick ; out of these slices, cut some crusts of an oval shape ; * In Germany oysters are sometimes served on a ‘faience’ revolving-stand. This method is not without its merits.FISH. 115 scoop round their surface, and fry them with butter, empty them on the scooped side, and keep warm. Take a few dozen large oysters ; blanch, trim, carefully spunge on a cloth ; which whereon divide the meat into small dice; put these into a little stewpan, season with a pinch of cayenne, thickening them with some ‘béchamel’-sauce, reduced at the same moment with a little good cream, and finished with a piece of fine butter. Take this preparation up with a spoon, and with it fill the warm crusts ; dish immediately on a folded napkin. 270. Angels on horseback. — Select a few dozen large oysters ; which open, removing their beards, as well as the callous parts ; put the flesh into a plate, and season it with salt and pepper. Blanch a piece of bacon ; when cold, cut it in thin strips, out of which again cut squares of the diameter of the oysters. Take the oysters one, by one ‘rile’ them on little silver-skewers, alternating each of the oysters, by a little square of bacon: give six oysters to each of the skewers. Sprinkle over the oysters a little bread-crumb, mixed with chopped parsley ; broil the oysters at a brisk fire, but, observe, for three minutes only ; dish the skewers, placing them on little ‘croûtons’ of bread, fried with butter, and kept very hot. 271. Oysters broiled, American fashion. — The American oysters ; or at least those eaten at New-York, and highly appreciated by ‘gourmets’ ; are very large, with very thick shells, and of an oblong shape. They weigh (in the shell) from a pound to pound and a quarter: the flesh inside is the size of a middling-sized muscle. I lately received some from New-York through the obliging kindness of a friend. I prepai’ed them, according to the receipt given by this friend himself; they were found to be very good, even after so long a voyage, which had naturally somewhat impaired their quality. Open the oysters, roll their flesh in bread-crumbs, and place them in a double iron-wire gridiron, in such a manner, that in closing it, the oysters are pressed close together. Baste slightly with clarified butter, broil them on both sides, and dish them on slices of toasted bread. Pour over them a hot melted ‘maitre-d’hôtel’ butter, lemon-juice, and chopped parsley. 272. Croquettes of American oysters. — Blanch slightly some large oysters, drain, pare, and season them with a little cayenne; wrap them up in a layer of lobster-‘croquette’ preparation, giving the ‘croquettes’ the shape of an egg. Bread-crumb the croquettes according the rule ; fry, and dish them on a folded napkin. 273. American oysters, with ‘béchameP-sauce. — Blanch slightly two dozen large oysters until they boil up ; drain and pare them. Clarify their liquor. 8*116 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. With this liquor and some milk, prepare a little 'béchamel’-sauce ; which reduce, introducing into it a good piece of butter, finishing with a few spoonfuls of cooked truffles ; add the oysters, and dish up. 274. Aspic of oysters. — Put four dozen oysters into a stewpan with a little white wine, let them poach ; drain, beard, and put them into a kitchen-basin, to be seasoned with salt and lemon-juice. Surround with pounded ice a plain or an ornamented, cylindric mould ; mask the bottom with a layer of aspic, which having set, place on it a part of the oysters, cover them, by degrees, with aspic, and finish filling the mould, alternately with oysters and aspic. An hour afterwards, dip the mould quickly into warm water, turn the 'aspic’ out on to a cold dish, surround it with chopped aspic-jelly, or some 'croûtons’. Serve separately a sauceboatful of mayonnaise. 275. Fried oysters, Provence fashion. — Blanch slightly four or five dozen oysters with a little white wine ; drain, wash, and wipe them on a cloth ; pare, and put them on a plate ; sprinkle them with pepper, and chopped parsley, and baste them with a little oil ; take them up two at a time, dip them in a light frying-paste, and plunge them into hot hog’s lard. When the paste is dried and colored, drain the oysters, salt, and dish them in a group on a folded napkin, surrounding them with fried parsley, and lemon cut in quarters. Frying-paste. — Put about two gills of flour into a kitchen-basin, add a little salt, and two tablespoonfuls of oil ; dilute it with beer, wine, or water, but by degrees, without letting the paste get thick or stringy ; it should be smooth and thin. If the paste is diluted with beer, keep it in a warm place for one hour. In any case, introduce into the paste two whipped whites of eggs, but only a little time previous to using it. 276. Hamburg fried oysters. — Get some large Holstein or Caneale oysters ; take them out of the shells ; beard, and roll them in some grated parmesan cheese; dip them into beaten eggs, roll them in pounded 'zwieback’*, or pounded biscottes (not sweetened), of the kind made at Brussels ; plunge them into hot hog’s lard ; and when done, drain, and dish them up with fried parsley round. 277. American fried oyesters. — Take the oysters, dip them into beaten eggs with a little of their liquor, roll them into pounded crackers, and arrange them in a frying-pan with butter, to fry on both sides, on a brisk fire. Dish them with fried parsley and lemons in quarters. * ‘Zwieback’ are rolls (prepared with milk) cut in two or more slices, dried in a very moderate oven, to give them a nice golden color. ‘Zwieback’ are to be purchased at any baker’s in Germany.117 FISH. 278. Trout with jelly (D. 33). — Choose a nice live trout, cut the tins, draw it by the gills, till the hollow of the belly with some common fish-force- meat, truss the head of the trout, and boil it in a ‘court-bouillon’, proceeding as for salmon. When cold, and well drained', wipe, and dish it on a ‘pain-vert’ of an oval Fig. 33. form ; masked on the top with white paper. Prop it up on both sides with butter, to keep it upright ; glaze it with half-set aspic-jelly, surround it with a thick string of chopped jelly, and edge the top of the ‘pain-vert’ with large ‘croûtons’ of jelly. Sur- round the base of the ‘pain’ with halves of hard-boiled eggs, alternated with half a heart of lettuce, and send up separately one or two boatfuls of mayonnaise-sauce. 279. Oysters, Tartar fashion. — Blanch live or six dozen oysters; drain, wash, and wipe them on a cloth; pare, and put them on a dish; season them with pepper, oil, and lemon-juice. Prepare some mayonnaise with eggs, in which mix a pinch of chopped shalot, and two tablespoonfuls of raw tine-herbs, composed of chives, taragon, chervil, marjoram ; add a few chopped capers and gei’kins ; finish the sauce with a spoonful of good mustard. When ready to serve, mix half of this sauce with the oysters. With this preparation garnish ten silver shells ; which mask with a thin layer of mayonnaise, and surround with a circle of chopped aspic-jelly. 280. Small trout ‘au court-bouillon’. — Select five or six small live trout ; kill, and draw them by their gills, without scaling them, but taking care to leave their ooze (or slime, limon) on the skin. Fry in a stewpan a large sliced onion, a carrot, some parsley and celery-root. When these vegetables are colored, moisten them with a bottle of red wine, and half a quart of fish-broth ; add some salt, a bunch of parsley garnished with aromatics ; a clove of garlic, some peppercorns and cloves ; boil the liquid for twelve or fifteen minutes, reducing it one third ; pass it, through a sieve, into another stewpan ; set it on the fire, and when boiling, plunge in the trout; let them boil, and remove theCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 118 stewpan back, covering it; five minutes afterwards, drain the trout with a skim- mer, and dish them on a folded napkin ; surround them with parsley, and serve separately a sauceboatful of plain melted butter. 281. Broiled trout, Provence fashion. — Get two middling-sized trout; draw, scale, wipe, and score them on both sides ; place them on a dish, season, and baste them with oil. Twenty minutes previous to serving, set them on a gridiron, broil them on both sides on a moderate fire, turning, and basting them with oil ; place them on a hot dish. At the same time, pour into a small stewpan, half a glass of oil ; put the stewpan in the Tain-marie’, and whisk the oil, until frothy ; add salt, chopped parsley, tiic juice of two or three lemons ; pour it over the trout, and serve. 282. Trout, Geneva fashion. — It was at the hotel kies Bergues’ in Geneva, that I learned this preparation, worthy of the attention of epicures. Cleanse four middling-sized fresh trout ; butter well a flat stewpan, on the bottom of which place the trout one beside the other. Pour over them a glass of white wine, salt them slightly, and boil them briskly, with live embers on the lid. As soon as done, take off the trout, range them on a dish, glaze with a paste-brush, and keep them at the entrance of the oven. Put a little glaze into the stock of the trout; bring the liquid to ebullition, and remove it back, introducing a good piece of maître-d’hôtel’-butter in small bits; finish it with the juice of a lemon, and pour it beside the trout. Pile up, on each end of the dish, a group of small round potatoes, fried in butter ; garnish the sides with slices of lemon, and serve. 283. Salmon-trout, with truffles. — Choose a trout, of firm flesh, weighing about two pounds ; scale, and draw it by the gills ; wash, and wipe it inwardly. Chop four fresh peeled truffles, which pound in a mortar ; add to this the third of their volume of softened bread-crumbs, and the same of butter ; season the preparation with salt, pepper, chopped parsley, and fill with it the inside of the trout ; which set on a buttered gratin-dish. Salt, baste it with butter, and push it into a moderate oven, to bake; basting often with butter. Twelve minutes after, pour into the dish a small glass of white wine, and a few spoonfuls of melted glaze ; boil the liquid, and push the dish again into the oven. A quarter of an hour later, the trout should be done ; place it on another dish ; dilute the fish-stock with a little white wine, let it boil and thicken with a piece of kneaded - butter ; add to it two chopped raw truffles, continue boiling it for two minutes longer; draw it back, and finish it with a piece of fresh butter, the juice of a lemon, and some chopped parsley : pour it over the trout, and serve.119 FISH. 284. Slices (tronçons) of trout, with mayonnaise-sauce (D. 34).— Get six very fresh small trout; cut off their heads, and thin ends; wipe them inwardly with a cloth, but without removing the ooze off the skin ; plunge them into a boiling ‘court-bouillon’ with claret; draw the stewpan back, cover, and allow the trout to cool in their stock ; drain, wipe, and keep them on ice, for half an hour, and glaze them with half-set aspic-jelly. Meanwhile, prepare a border-mould with clear aspic-jelly. When ready to serve, turn this border out on a dish, mask the bottom of the cavity with a layer of Fig. 34. chopped jelly, on which dish the pieces of trout in a group. Send up separately the following sauce : Mayonnaise-sauce. — Put three yolks of eggs into a bowl ; add to it a pinch of salt, and a pinch of powdered mustard ; pound them with a wooden spoon, and while stirring, introduce, by degress, three gills of oil, to give consistence to the pre- paration, mixing in from time to time a little lemon-juice. The oil being absorbed, the sauce should be nicely thickened, smooth and compact ; season, finish it with a little vinegar, and pour it into a sauce-boat. 285. Trout ‘au gratin’. — Draw, scale, and wipe, three or four middling- sized trout; split them, on the belly-side, from head to tail ; cut off the spine-bone at each end, to remove it ; season inwardly, and till the fish with a little ‘quenelle’ force-meat, mixed with a few spoonfuls of fine-herbs. Bring the trout back into proper shape; salt, and place them one against another on a buttered gratin-dish, sprinkle them with a pinch of shalots, a few spoonfuls of raw chopped mushrooms, and a little parsley. Press them close together, salt, and sprinkle them likewise with fine-herbs, baste them with butter; then pour on to the bottom of the dish a few spoonfuls of brown-sauce, thinned with a little white wine. Set the dish in a hot oven, baking the trout for ten or twelve minutes ; on taking them out, place the dish on another, serving as a tray. 286. Matelote, Russ fashion. — Mince an onion, and a carrot; put them into a stewpan, with butter, some sprigs of parsley and aromatics, and a cloveCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 120 of garlic ; fry these vegetables, moisten them with a bottle of white wine and a little broth ; add some salt, cloves, and peppercorns ; boil the liquid ; to which add a small clean ‘sterlet’ cut in pieces, as well as a few small trout of ‘gashina’, also cut in pieces; cover the stewpan, and boil the fish on a brisk fire, for twelve or fourteén minutes ; remove the stewpan off the fire, pour the stock into a flat stewpan, passing it through a tammy. Skim the fat off the liquid, mix it up with a dozen raw button- mushrooms, as well as a few spoonfuls of melted glaze, and reduce it one third ; thicken with kneaded-butter, to obtain a light sauce ; to which add the pieces of fish, and two dozen small blanched and well glazed onions; let it boil, then remove it on to a slow fire, and let the fish simmer for seven or eight minutes ; pile them up on a dish, surround them with fried bread ‘croutons’, and two dozen small ‘que- nelles’of fish poached at the moment, dished in groups, alternated with the onions and mushrooms. Finish the sauce by introducing a small piece of crayfish-butter, and five ounces of good butter in small bits ; baste the fish with this sauce, and send it up. 287. Trout ‘à l’épicurienne’. — Take a trout weighing about two pounds ; scale, draw, and wipe it well ; set it on a narrow and deep gratin-disb, buttered at the bottom. Salt the fish slightly, surround it with a few trimmings of truffles, and a bunch of parsley ; moisten with two glasses of madeira, and cover it with a buttered sheet of paper. Boil the liquid, cover the dish, and boil the fish, until its liquid be reduced to half; pour the stock of the trout into a small stewpan, add to it a few spoonfuls of meat-glaze, and thicken with a piece of kneaded-butter, in order to obtain a light sauce ; boil it then a while, and pass, it through a sieve, over the fish ; which surround with two or three raw chopped truffles. Ten minutes after, take the trout carefully out, and slip it on to a warm, oval dish, group the truffles round ; finish the sauce by introducing (off the fire) a little piece of anchovy-butter, some parsley, and the juice of a lemon ; pour it over the trout, and serve. 288. Skate, piquant sauce. — The skate is a fish, very popular in France; and though neither siicculent nor delicate, it may be owned, that many amateurs prefer it to some other kinds of higher renown. In England skate abounds likewise, and is sold by the fishmongers, cut up in stripes (crimped), and of extra- ordinary whiteness ; yet they are never served at an aristocratic table. Skate ‘bouclées’ are the most-esteemed sort, they are called‘bouclées’, on account of the kind of buckles with which their skin is covered. Skate should not be partaken of too fresh, that is, when just caught ; as it would prove rather tough. Therefore it is allowed to soak for a length of time, more or less, according to the season. Pour five or six quarts of water into a flat stewpan, add to the liquid two minced onions and a celery-root, a bunch of parsley, garnished with many aromatics,121 FISH. a few cloves, and half a bottle of vinegar. Let the liquid boil for five or six minutes, cover the stewpan, keeping it on the side of the fire. Cut off first the wings, or side-parts of the skate adjoining to the trunk or body ; which open to cleanse, and divide into two or three parts. The liver, generally much esteemed, must lie steeped, and blanched separately. Lay the wing-pieces and the large pieces in a kitchen-basin, sprinkle over them a handful of salt, moisten with a glass of vinegar, let them macerate for one hour ; wash them in cold water, place them in a stewpan, cover them with cold water, adding a handful of salt, and a little vinegar. Set the stewpan on a brisk fire, let the liquid boil; remove it back, lift out the pieces offish with a skimmer, and slip them on to a baking-sheet. Remove the skin adhering to the pieces, which place in a stewpan, kept on the side of the fire ; let the liquid boil, cover the stewpan, leaving it on the side of the fire for a quarter of an hour. Then drain the fish, dish it up, surround it with fried parsley, and send up separately the following sauce : Piquant sauce. — Chop an onion, fry it with butter in a stewpan without allow- ing it to take color, moisten with half a glass of vinegar, add to it a bunch of parsley garnished with two bay-leaves, a little thyme, cloves and peppercorns. Reduce the liquid to half, mix it up with two gills of broth or gravy, and as much of sauce. Boil the liquid, and remove the stewpan back. A quarter of an hour after, drain the fat from the sauce, which pass through a tammy, add to it two tablespoonfuls of whole capers, and the sauce of gerkins cut up in pieces. 289. Croustades of skate’s liver, Nantes fashion. — The liver of skate is very delicate ; and prepared in small bread-‘croustades’, it constitutes an excellent luncheon-dish. Steep two or three livers of skate for a couple of hours, put them into a stewpan with water and vinegar, a minced onion, a sprig of parsley, and salt. Bring the liquid to ebullition, draw the stewpan off the fire, and let the livers cool in their liquor. Drain, and wipe them on a cloth, and cut them in pieces. Put into a stewpan two tablespoonfuls of chopped onions and shalôts, fry them with butter, moisten with a little Velouté’-sauce, and a few spoonfuls of white wine; reduce the sauce, to give it a little consistence ; mix it up with two tablespoonfuls of capers, a little chopped parsley, and taragon ; finish with a small piece of anchovy- butter, and a pinch of cayenne ; add the pieces of liver, and keep the stewpan in the ‘bain-marie’. Meanwhile, cut from a kitchen-loaf some slices half an inch thick, divide them in oblong squares, two inches and half by two, pare them to an oval form, score them with the point of a knife (on one side) making an incision all round, at a little distance from their edges. Fry them nicely in butter or oil, drain, and open themCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 122 on the scored side ; empty, and garnish them with the prepared ‘salpicon in a dome- like fashion. Smooth them with the blade of a knife, sprinkle over some bread- crumbs, or grated parmesan; baste them with butter, and salamander the top. Dish up the ‘croustades’ immediately on a folded napkin. 290. Ferra, with Geneva-sauce. — The ferra is a fish of the lake Leman; it is not large, but, on account of the delicacy of its flesh, is much appreciated by amateurs. Cleanse a few ferras, put them into a stewpan with white wine and vegetables, start the liquid to ebullition, and then remove the stewpan back, keeping it covered for seven or eight minutes. Dish the fish on a napkin, and serve separately the following sauce: Geneva-sauce. — The Geneva-sauce, prepared in Geneva, differs essentially from that made in England and in France ; but the one described here has the merit of being a national sauce, and as such I value it. Pass through a sieve about three gills of fish-stock with wine. Put five ounces of butter into a stewpan, introduce two small tablespoonfuls of flour, and work the paste until smooth. Add to it four yolks of eggs, and when well mixed up, dilute the whole with the fish-stock nearly cooled. Stir the sauce on a moderate fire, and at the first bubbling remove it back. Strain, and finish it with a piece of butter, and the juice of a lemon. 291. ‘Bouillabaisse’, Russ fashion. — Kill a small sterlet ; cleanse, and divide it in pieces. Mince two onions, put them into a stewpan, with good olive-oil, and a clove of garlic ; fry them to a light brown color, add to them the pieces of sterlet, a dozen of ‘iershis’, one small eel, and six large crayfish cut in two lengthwise. Add likewise a bunch of parsley, and two red pimentoes, a pinch of salt, the pulp of a lemon, cut in slices, freed of peel and pips, and lastly, three tablespoonfuls of tomata-purce. Moisten the fish, to its height, with two thirds of white wine and one third offish- broth ; set the stewpan on a brisk fire, boil the fish for twelve or fourteen minutes ; remove the pan back, and pass the stock through a sieve. Pour it into a deep dish, spread with thin slices of bread, dish the fish on another dish, which serve at the same time as the broth and bread. 292. Sterlet, with Chablis wine (D. 35). — The sterlet is the fish most appreciated in Russia, it is caught in the Volga, yet at St. Petersburg this fish is found alive, at all seasons of the year, even during the most rigorous cold. The sterlet is pre-eminently the most aristocratic of fish. A true epicure does not partake of it, unless quite sure of its being killed just previous to cooking. For this reasonFISH. 123 its price rises to an exorbitant rate in winter-time. It is with sterlet, that the 'uka’ is prepared, that celebrated soup, so worthy of the preference given it by 'gourmets’. Procure a middling-sized sterlet, remove the sharp scales from the sides and back of the fish; then scrape, draw, and wash it; make a small incision under the belly, in order to get hold of the sinewy gut, which runs along the spine-bone, being the size of a macaroni ; when it is laid bare, take hold of it with a cloth, and puli it out quite whole, but slowly. Fig. 35. Divide the sterlet in seven or eight pieces, cut a little slantwise ; put them into a stewpan, the bottom of which is buttered, and garnished with a few sliced parsley- roots ; add to it a bay-leaf, and a clove of garlic (not peeled) ; salt the fish, and moisten, to three parts its height, with 'Chablis’ wine, and the juice of two or three lemons; cover the stewpan, boil the liquid on a sharp fire, so that, the sterlet being done, the stock may be reduced to half; skim off its fat, and mix it up with a few spoonfuls of melted glaze. Let it boil, then thicken with a few tablespoonfuls of brown-sauce; add the juice of a lemon, and range the pieces of sterlet on an oval dish, putting the fish back into its original shape. Surround the fish on both sides with groups of truffles, olives, 'quenelles’, and mushrooms. Mask it with a pait of the sauce, the remainder of which is sent up in a sauceboat. 203. Cold sterlet-pie. — If anybody, living in St. Petersburg, were to undertake the preparation of cold sterlet-pies in good conditions ; this dish no doubt would soon be appreciated and accepted by the epicures of all countries : I had several times occasion to prepare some, and found that the qualities of this fish are admirably suited to tins purpose. Cleanse a sterlet in the usual way, divide it into pieces ; which place in a stepwan with a little butter, a glass of white wine, two handfuls of trimmings of fresh truffles, and a bunch of parsley with aromatics ; boil it for seven or eight minutes ; cover the stewpan, and remove it back. Ten minutes after, pass the sterlet-stock into a kitchen-basin, lift out the pieces, and each of these cut in two lengthwise, so as carefully to remove all bones and hard parts. Place the fish in a deep dish, add to it about two pounds of raw peeled truffles,COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 124 cut in quarters ; season with salt, spices, chopped parsley, and a few spoonfuls of sherry; cover the dish, and macerate the fish, with the truffles and wine, for one hour. Cut in pieces ten ounces of the flesh of eel, and the same of pike; mix and pound them together: pound likewise one pound of fresh fat bacon, and put it by: lastly pound two raw truffles with panada the size of an egg, and the fillets of six anchovies. This mixture prepared, add to it the bacon, and the fish previously pounded ; season it highly with salt and spices, pound it once more, and five minutes previous to taking it out of the mortar, introduce into the force-meat the cooking-stock of the sterlet. Line a pie-mould with short-paste, the bottom and sides of which mask with a layer of force-meat, and fill the hollow with the pieces of sterlet and truffles, with alternate layers of force-meat. Finish, and bake the pie, according to the usual way. Half an hour after its being taken out of the oven, pour into it at the top, a few spoonfuls of good aspic-jelly, with an infusion of aromatics, and half its quantity of sherry. Allow the pie to cool, before serving it. 294. Lamprey, Piémont fashion. — The lamprey is an excellent fish, with delicate and light flesh, if it be taken alive, and killed at the moment of cooking; this fish is really delicate, however, only previous to the period of spawning, after- wards its flesh becomes dry, and loses its qualities. When the lamprey is bled, cut off its head, and divide the body in pieces, which put into a stewpan, with cold water, and a little vinegar. Set the stewpan on the fire, stir the fish with a skimmer, and warm it until the skin can be taken off ; then drain the pieces, and put them on a cloth; sprinkle over some salt, and rub them with the cloth, removing the skin. Wash them afterwards, place them in a stewpan, and cover them with white wine. ■ Add a little salt, a piece of cinnamon, and a bunch of parsley with aromatics ; boil the liquid for ten minutes, and draw the stewpan off the fire. Pianontese-sance. — Melt six ounces of butter in a stewpan, mix it with the same quantity of flour, and fry this paste on a moderate fire, stirring till of a brown color ; moisten with the fish-stock and a little good gravy, in order to obtain a light sauce. Stir it until boiling, and remove it back, to let it simmer for twenty minutes. Then drain it of its fat ; pass it through a sieve, into another stewpan ; add a gill of Marsala or madeira wine, and boil it quickly, to reduce and render it succulent. Then add to it the pieces of lamprey, two tablespoonfuls of red currant-jelly, and a piece of lemon-peel. Put the stewpan on a moderate fire ; and, a quarter of an hour after- wards, thicken the sauce with the blood of the lamprey, mixed with a little vinegar; place the fish in a deep dish, the bottom of which is masked with ‘croûtons’ of toasted bread.FISH. 125 295. ‘Tourte (tart) à la marinière’ (D. 36). — Spread on a round baking-sheet a flat of short-paste ; seven or eight inches in diameter; trim it neatly, and wet its edges with a paste-brush. Cut a stripe of puff-paste (made at six turns) of half an inch thick, an inch and a half wide, and long enough to stretch all round the flat; place this stripe, round the moistened part of the flat, on a level with its edges ; lap both ends over, after being- moistened ; then score the stripe on its outside with the hack of a knife, and egg the top surface. Mask the bottom-flat, inside the border, with a round of buttered paper, on which set a ‘eharlotte’-mould ; push the 'tourte’ into a hot oven (180 degrees), and bake it until nicely colored, and the paste dried: it will take twenty-five minutes. When taken out of the oven, remove mould and paper, slip the ‘tourte’ on to a dish, and keep it hot. With about a pound and a half of raw pike-flesh, prepare a ‘quenelle’ force-meat, proceeding as said in No. 244. With this force-meat, mould, on a buttered paper, four large ‘quenelles’ of an oval shape; adorn them with truffles, and poach them in salted water. With the remainder of the force-meat, prepare some small oblong ‘quenelles’, rolling them on a floured table ; poach them also in water, drain them when set, and put them into a flat stewpan, with three dozen crayfish-tails, two dozen blanched and pared oysters, and a few boiled button - mushrooms cut crosswise. Moisten these garnishes with a pint of fish ‘velouté’-sauce, worked with some mush- room and oyster liquor, and thickened afterwards with a few yolks of eggs. Warm the ‘ragout’ without letting it boil, and fill the ‘tourte’ with it, set the four large ‘quenelles’ on the top, scrollwise, alternated with a'nice crayfish, and place on the centre a whole truffle. 290. ‘Noix’ of turtle, English fashion. — Get one of the fleshy parts {noix) of the turtle ; pare it into a regular form, and lard it with fillets of anchovies ; season and put it into a kitchen-basin with sliced vegetables and aromatics. Pour into a small stewpan two gills of vinegar, add to it a few peppercorns and cloves, set the stewpan on the fire, and reduce the liquid one fourth ; let it cool, and pour it onCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 126 the ‘noix’ of turtle, which leave to pickle for two days. Place it afterwards, in a flat stewpan, with the vegetables underneath ; cover it with buttered paper, baste with its ‘marinade’, and braise it on a moderate fire. Two hours afterwards, drain the meat, and dish it up. Mask with a ‘poivrade’- sauee, and sprinkle over a pinch of chopped gerkins. 297. Lamprey, Bordeaux fashion. — Choose a fine live lamprey; bleed it, by making an incision at the end of its tail, and put by the blood ; scald it, to remove the skin by scraping ; cut off the tip of the tail, make an incision all round underneath the gills, separate the cut parts in order to get hold of the nerve by the aid of a napkin, and to pull it out. This done, divide the fish into middling-sized pieces; which place in a stewpan with vegetables and aromatic herbs, cover them with good claret ; set the stewpan on a brisk fire, boil the fish for ten minutes ; then drain the stock into a kitchen-basin, passing it through a sieve. Melt two table- spoonfuls of lard in a stewpan, mix with it two tablespoonfuls of flour, in order to form a light paste; which fry, stirring it with a spoon, on a moderate fire, until of a light brown color; dilute it with the stock of the lamprey; start the liquid to ebullition, and remove the stewpan back, to boil the sauce for twenty minutes more. Then skim off its fat, and strain it. At the same time, color the white part of twelve to fifteen leeks, cut two inches long, in a flat stewpan ; when of a nice color, salt and mix with them a few spoonfuls of raw ham, cut in dice; and two minutes after, moisten with the sauce, in which cook them, till reduced to half. Then add to it the pieces of lamprey, and finish cooking them together on a moderate fire ; when the fish is done, take the pieces out carefully with a fork, and dish them, surrounding it with the leeks ; mix a little gravy in the sauce, skim off the fat, boil, thicken it with the blood of the lamprey, and pass it, through a sieve, over the fish. 298. Small fried lampreys, Piémont fashion. — Young lampreys, of the thickness of a pencil, abound in the TV ; they are very much cared for by the Piemontese ‘gourmets’ ; in Turin they are in great request. Choose some live lampreys, remove the heads, and thin ends of the tails ; sprinkle over them some salt, and a few minutes after, wash them quickly, wipe and Hour them; plunge them into hot fat, to fry on a good fire; drain, and dish them on a folded napkin, with fried parsley, and lemon cut in quarters, all round. 299. Carp ‘à la marinière’ (D. 37). — Draw a nice carp, weighing from six to eight pounds; scale it, shorten the fins, and fill the belly with force-meat. Remove a little of the skin at each end, thus laying bare the flesh, and lard it with127 FISH. cut bacon. Truss the head of the carp, place it on the drainer of a fish-kettle ; season it, and moisten to half its height with ‘court-bouillon’ with wine nearly cold. Set the fish-kettle on the fire, to let the liquid boil ; five minutes after, cover the carp with a thickly buttered paper, and push it into a moderate oven, to hake for an hour and a half, hasting it often. Then take it out of the oven ; drain it, to pass its stock through a sieve ; put it back into the fish-kettle, and keep it hot. With the cooking- stock prepare a little brown sauce ; when clarified and strained, pour it into a fiat Fig. 37. stewpan, add a handful of trimmings of mushrooms ; reduce it, introducing into it a glass of white wine, pass it through a sieve, and finish with four ounces of good butter. Dish up the carp; surround it, on both sides, with a hunch of mushrooms, one of‘quenelles’ of whitings, and one of blanched olives ; glaze the larding with a paste- brush, masks lightly the other parts of the fish, and the bottom of the dish, with a little sauce ; and send up separately the remainder of the sauce, after having added to it the soft-roes. • BOO. Lamprey, Burgundy fashion. — Kill a nice lamprey ; cleanse, and remove its skin, as for an eel ; divide it into pieces, which sprinkle with salt. Prepare a little ‘roux’, with four ounces of butter, and the same of flour ; when of a nice color, dilute it with white wine, stir the sauce, till it begins to boil ; it should then he smooth, and a little thiekish. Season, add the pieces offish, well wiped, and a hunch of parsley with aromatics. Then boil the fish till three-parts done; now add a dozen raw mushrooms: twenty minutes after, strain the sauce, skim off its fat, and reduce it on a brisk fire. Meanwhile, range the fish on slices of bread toasted, disposed at the bottom of a dish ; surround it with the mushrooms, and a garnish of small glazed onions. The sauce being ready, mix it up with a little pepper, a piece of butter, the juice of a lemon, and pour it over the fish.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 128 301. Christmas-carp, in Poland.— The Poles, like the ‘Provençale’ and Italians, celebrate Christmas-eve by a solemn supper, at which nothing "but lean dishes are served. The carp, prepared in the conditions here to be described, is the traditional dish of these feasts. Take a live carp, run the head through with a knife, letting it bleed, and preserv- ing the blood; scale, and cleanse it carefully, putting the soft-roe in water and vinegar to blanch. Divide the fish into proportionate pieces, and place them in a stewpan, the bottom of which is sprinkled over with sliced onions and parsley-roots. Salt the fish slightly, add a sprig of parsley, thyme, bay-leaf, peppercorns, and cloves; and moisten, about to its height, half with hydromel, and half with white wine. Set the stewpan on a brisk fire, boiling the liquid for ten minutes, then remove it on a moderate fire, or push it into the oven. When the carp is done, strain its stock into another stewpan, skim off its fat, let it boil, and thicken with a piece of kneaded-butter. Boil the sauce for a quarter of an hour, and pass it through a tammy ; add to it the pulp of two lemons, cut into thin slices; a handful of chopped sweet almonds, dried in the oven; the same quantity of currants, washed in tepid water, and boiled a minute in white wine. Give the sauce two bubblings, thicken it with the preserved blood, mixed with a little vinegar. Dish the carp, pour over the sauce, surround it with the soft-rocs, and serve. 302. Bouchées of carp soft-roes. — Prepare fifteen ‘bouchée’ (mouthful- cases of puff-paste with butter; bake, and empty them. Remove the gut of a dozen of the soft-roes of carp ; steep them, blanch, and divide them into middling- sized pieces. Pour, at the bottom of each ‘bouchée’-case, a little sauce finished with aqchovy-creain, or with crayfish-butter; place-a piece of soft-roe in each of them, mask them with sauce, cover, and send them up. 303. Carp, Narbonne fashion. — Cleanse a middling-sized carp, split it in two, cut each half in transversal pieces of an equal size, and remove the bones. Take a few dozen morils freshly gathered, pick them carefully, wash them several times, dry them on a cloth ; put them into a flat stewpan, with butter and the juice of two lemons. Boil them covered, on a moderate fire, until their moisture be evaporated, and add to them the pieces of carp, with the head cut in two. Season the fish with salt and pepper, add to it a bunch of parsley ; moisten the fish with white wine, and boil it over a brisk fire for eight or ten minutes, then draw the stewpan off the fire, to thicken the cooking-stock with a piece of kneaded-butter When the sauce is ready, introduce into it a small piece of anchovy-butter, and the juice of a lemon. Place the fish on a warm dish, masked with fried slices of bread.129 FISH. 304. ‘Matelote’ of carp (D. No. 38). — Cleanse two or three mid- dling-sized carp ; divide them in pieces, cut the heads in two ; remove the gall-stone, and blanch the roes separately. Slice an onion, and a carrot; fry them in a stewpan, with butter, for eight or ten minutes; then add the pieces of carp, season them, and two minutes after, moisten (till covered) half with white wine and half with red ; add two spoonfuls of brandy, a bunch of parsley, with aromatics, peppercorns, cloves, and about fifteen fresh raw mushrooms. Set the stewpan on a brisk fire, boil the liquid, for ten or twelve minutes. Then remove the stewpan back, and thicken the stock with a piece of kneaded - butter in small bits. Toss the stewpan, till the butter is dissolved. At the same time bake ‘à blanc’ a hot-pie crust; when ready, fix it on a dish, place on its interior centre a support of fried bread, which surround at its base with force- meat ; dry it in a warm stove. When about to serve, garnish the crust, to its height, with the lower rounds of the fish, as well as with small poached ‘quenelles’ ; on this first layer, place the heads of the carp, surrounding them, on one side with mushrooms, on the other with small glazed onions ; on the latter, range ‘en rosace’ four nice slices of carp, on the centre of which (entering into the bread) run a ‘hatelet’-skewer garnished with shrimps or crayfish. Mask the fish and mushrooms with a little sauce ; the remainder of which is sent up in a sauceboat ; add the blanched soft-roes, cut up in pieces. 305. Carp, Russ fashion. — Cleanse a middling-sized carp. Butter an oval gratin-dish, sprinkle the bottom with sliced vegetables, onions, carrots, and celery-roots, on which place the carp ; salt it slightly, and pour over it half a bottle of white wine. Cover the fish with a sheet of buttered paper, and set it in a moderate oven ; a quarter of an hour after, turn it out, and finish cooking it carefully bastingCOSMOPOLITAN COOPERY. 130 it with its stock; take it out with a skimmer, and place it on an oblong dish, which keep at the entrance of the oven ; now mix a little broth with the liquid, boil it a few minutes, pass it through a sieve, and skim off its fat. Add to it a gill of madeira, boil, and thicken it with cold diluted potato-flour. Add to it a tablespoonful of scraped horse-radish ; pass the sauce, through a sieve, over the fish, and garnish each side with well drained and cooked sour-crout. 306. Carp with beer. — This dish, of German origin, is very much esteemed on that side of the Rhine. Choose a middling-sized live carp ; scale it, split it in two, divide each half transversally, removing as much of the bones as possible. If the carp has a soft roe, this should be blanched separately. Butter the bottom of a flat stewpan, cover it with a layer of sliced onions, ou which place, side by side, the pieces of carp, having removed the gall-stone, and cut the head in two. Salt the fish, add to it a piece of chopped celery, a bunch of parsley, thyme, bay-leaf, peppercorns, cloves, and a piece of gingerbread the size of the hand, previously cut in small dice. This done, moisten the fish with beer*, set the stewpan on a sharp fire, boil the liquid for seven or eight minutes ; then draw the stewpan on a moderate fire, to finish cooking the fish. The sauce should be a little thiekish, of a nice color, and good relish. Range the pieces of carp on a hot dish, with the soft-roes blanched, skim the fat of the sauce, and pass it, through a sieve, over the fish. 307. Fisherman’s carp. — Cleanse two middling-sized carp, divide them transversally in pieces ; which place in a large bowl of greater width than height, add a sprig of thyme, two bay-leaves, peppercorns, cloves, and a piece of dry bitter orange-peel. Moisten the fish, till covered, with red wine, and boil it on a brisk fire, in such a manner, that when done, the stock is reduced to half. Meanwhile, slice three or four large onions, fry them with oil in a frying-pan until of a nice color, sprinkle over them a pinch of flour ; moisten them, by degrees, with the stock of the carp ; boil it gently. When the onions are done, add the pieces of carp, neatly pared ; let them simmer for ten minutes, and finish the sauce with a little vinegar. 308. Slice of tunny fried, Provence fashion. — Cut a slice of tunny, not too thick, salt, and flour it slightly. Heat some oil in a frying-pan, in which put the slice, and fry it on a moderate fire, turning it; then drain it, remove the skin, and dish up; remove the oil from the pan, wipe it, and pour into it a * Any kind of beer being light, will do for this purpose : in Germany the (Weiss-bier) white beer is employed.FISH. 131 gill of good oil. Heat it, add to the liquid two bay-leaves, and a little salt; take it off the fire, and mix with it four or five tablespoonfuls of good vinegar. Pour the liquid over the fish, and serve. 309. ‘Brandade’ of salted cod, Montpellier fashion (D. 39). — Take the half of a thick salted stock-fish (about one pound and a half) sufficiently soaked, divide it into squares ; boil, proceeding as told in No. 317. A quarter of an hour after, drain the fish on a sieve, remove immediately all its bones ; place the meat, and the skin, in a kitchen-basin. Fig. 39. Fry in oil two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion, and a little shalot. The onion being of a nice color, add the cod, which warm up, turn it into a mortar, and pound it; when converted into a paste, put it into the stewpan again, working it well with a spoon ; then gradually introduce into it half a bottle of good salad-oil ; and when absorbed, work the preparation a few minutes longer, squeezing into it the juice of two lemons, and adding about two gills of oil more, but by degrees. The preparation ought to be now quite thick and creamy ; should it be too light, two spoonfuls of stiff ‘béchamel’-sauce must be added ; if not, a few spoonfuls of good raw cream will do. Season it with a little pepper and nutmeg, salt if requisite, and a pinch of chopped parsley ; work the preparation two minutes more; after which, finish it with the juice of a lemon ; it should now be of a good consistence, but delicate, smooth, and relishing. Warm it slightly, without ceasing to work, and range it up in a dome-like fashion on the centre of a dish, between two bread ‘croustades’, cut to the three parts of a circle, stuck at both ends of the dish. Sprinkle over the ‘brandade’ a few slices of truffles, place on the top an whole truffle ; fill the ‘croustades’ with crayfish-tails, and surround them, at their base, with scollops of fish and truffles alternately. Garnish the hollow, between the two ‘croustades’, with a group of small oyster-patties ; and serve. 9*COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 132 In Provence tlie ‘brandade’ is usually completed by tlie introduction of a clove of garlic; crushed with the blade of a knife ; but this addition is manifestly optional. This dish may be served as a first remove at a dinner-table. 310. Codfish, à la Maitre d’Hôtel. — Take a piece of good codfish (about a pound) dissalted to the degree requisite, white and thick ; divide it in squares, place them in a stewpan with cold water ; set the stewpan on the fire, so as to bring the liquid to ebullition ; then immediately take it off the fire, cover, and keep it thus for ten minutes. Now drain the cod on a sieve, remove the bone, and divide the meat in pieces ; which place immediately in a flat stewpan ; add to it a hit of nutmeg, a quarter of a pound of good butter, divided in little pieces, and two tablespoonfuls of butter-sauce ; add then a pinch of chopped parsley, and the juice of two lemons. Dish the cod, surrounding it with ‘croutons’ of bread or puff-paste. 311. Broiled slice Of tunny. — Cut a slice of tunny, of about an inch thick ; salt, and baste it with oil ; set it on a clean gridiron, and broil it, on both sides, over a moderate fire, turning and basting it often with oil ; when done, remove the adhering skin, and place it on a hot dish. Pour over a little oil, and serve separately with it some hot ‘mayonnaise’ or some cold ‘rémoulade’-sauce. 312. Tunny with green peas. — Cut a slice of tunny rather thick ; inter- lard it the flesh with fillets of bacon, or fillets of anchovy ; put it into a stewpan with water, to blanch ; drain, and wipe it on a cloth ; then put it into a flat stewpan, garnished at the bottom, with trimmings of bacon and sliced vegetables. Salt the fish slightly, and moisten, to its height, Avith broth and white wine; set the stewpan on a sharp fire, in order to reduce the liquid to half, and remove it on to a moderate fire; with some hot embers on the lid, finish cooking the fish; when done, the stock should be reduced to a glaze; drain the fish, and remove the skin surrounding its thickness. Meanwhile, prepare a pint of green peas, French fashion, with little liquid; place them on a dish, and lay the fish on the top. Pour into the fish-stock a little broth, pass it through a sieve, skim off its fat, then boil it for a few minutes, and serve it separately. • 313. Poutarg with Oil. — The ‘poutarg’ is a sort of dry and pressed caviar, prepared with mullet or tunny roes : it is in great request in Italy and the east. Cut the poutarg in thin slices, which season with oil, pepper, and lemon-juice; serve it as a ‘hors d’oeuvre’.133 FISH. 314. Turban of sole-fillets, Paris fashion (D. 40). — Remove the black skin from five small soles ; take out their fillets, pare them neatly, season, and decorate half of them with pieces of truffle, cut in crescents ; which insert into small incisions, made at an equal distance, in the fillets. With the trimmings of soles, and an equal quantity of pike-flesh, prepare some ‘quenelle’ force-meat (see No. 244). With the three parts of this force-meat fill a buttered border-mould, and poach it in the ‘bain-marie’. When firm, turn the border out on a flat of short-paste, half-baked, and cut exactly of the diameter of an entrée- Fig. 40. dish ; mask it with a thin layer of force-meat, applying the remainder of it on the top, in a thick string, thus augmenting the height of the border. This done, place the fillets of soles ‘à cheval’ against the exterior sides of the border, thrusting the thin ends into the hollow of the border, and taking care to alternate the fillets, one being decorated, and one plain. Fill the centre of the turban with a bread-support, masked with buttered paper, or with bacon ; also wrap the fillets up with buttered paper and bacon; fasten it with string, and push the turban into a moderately heated oven, to bake for thirty-five minutes; when done, take off the paper, remove the bread-support, drain the fat off, and slip it on to a round dish. Edge the dish with a border of ‘nouille’-paste, and stick on the centre of the turban a support of fried bread of the same height, on which fix a small pewter-cup, masked with nouille-paste. Garnish it with small round truffles, and mask the fish with some ‘veloute’-sauce, reduced, and very slightly thickened. Send up separately a boatful of oyster-sauce. 315. ‘Aiguillettes’ Of tunny, fried. — Cut a slice of tunny, a little more than half an inch thick, remove the skin, and divide the slice in two, removing the bone, and cutting the flesh off the thickness of the slice, in very thin strips, forming134 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. the ‘aiguillettes’. Salt them, dip them in oil, flour, and plunge them in hot fat, to fry them. As soon as the flesh is firm, take them out with a skimmer, drain, and salt them ; dish them up with a little fried parsley. 310. Pickled tunny. — In all countries pickled tunny is to be purchased; but to appreciate the quality of this fish, it should be had freshly pickled and eaten fresh ; which, however, is rather a difficult thing, where it is not native. In this condition it is white, tender, and of exquisite taste. Drain the tunny, wipe it, cut it in slices, which range symmetrically on a dish; surround it with parsley, capers, gerkins, and chopped hard-boiled eggs ; baste it, as well as the garnishes, with good olive-oil ; and serve. 317. Salt-COd boiled, Dutch fashion. —Divide in large squares half of a salt-cod, soak it for two or three days in fresh water, taking care to change the water several times. When the fish is supple to the touch, scale, and put it into a stewpan ; moisten with plenty of cold water, cover the stewpan, and set it on a good fire. Let the liquid boil, and at the first bubbling draw the stewpan on the side, thus keeping the liquid simmering for twelve or fifteen minutes ; then lift out the pieces of salt-cod with a skimmer; drain them on a cloth, remove the large bones, and place them on a dish. Baste the fish with clarified butter, mixed up with the juice of a lemon, add a pinch of parsley and nutmeg ; surround them with boiled potatoes, and serve. 318. Salt-COd, Genoa fashion. — Put into a stewpan two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion, a clove of garlic, a bay-leaf, and some oil ; fry the onion to a nice color, take the garlic out, and moisten with two gills of thin tomata-sauce. Meanwhile, take half of a salt-cod well dried; divide it in middling-sized squares ; which flour, and fry in oil. Then drain, and put them with the sauce, into the stewpan, in which let them simmer for a quarter of an hour, and serve. 319. Salt-COd, with spinach. — Procure the half of a thick and white salt-cod, sufficiently soaked ; divide it in squares, which boil in water, proceeding, as told in No. 317 ; drain them, as soon as done, remove carefully all the bones and skin, and cut them into small pieces. Meanwhile pick, wash, and chop, four good handfuls of spinach; which put into a frying-pan with a little oil. Add to it a spoonful of parsley chopped. When it has reduced its moisture, mix into it a handful of bread-crumb ; moisten the pre- paration with some milk, keeping it of a pretty good consistence. Boil it for ten minutes, add the pieces of salt-cod, and set the whole on a gratin-dish in layers, alternated with oil. Smooth the top with the blade of a knife, sprinkle over someFISH. 135 bread-crumbs, baste with oil, and push the dish into a moderate oven; in which leave it for half an hour ; then send it up. 320. Fillets of soles, with mushrooms (D. 41). — Take out the fillets of two or three well cleansed soles ; free them of their black skin, season, and beat them slightly with the handle of a knife ; pare, and mask them, on one side, with a thin layer of raw force-meat ; then fold them in two, on the masked side ; place them in a flat stewpan with melted butter, add the juice of two lemons, and Fig. 41. fry them on both sides. Then drain, and pare them neatly, prick into each of them a crayfish-claw (not peeled) in imitation of a ruffle or cuff ; dish them on a border of fish force-meat, decorated, poached ; fill its cavity with a garnish of white mushroom-buttons ; mask the fillets and the garnish, with some good ‘velouté’-sauce, reduced with extract of fish, and mushroom-trimmings ; send up the remainder in a sauce-boat. 321. Venetian sole-fillets. — Trim nicely fifteen fillets of soles, double them, lay them in a ‘sauté’-pan, cook them with butter and white wine ; drain them, and range them in a circular order on a layer of force-meat, poached on the I dish. Mask them entirely with Velouté’-sauce, finished with a pinch of cayenne, i and a piece of red butter. Place between each fillet a large slice of truffle of nice i black color; fill the hollow within’the circle, with a group of large prawn or crayfish-tail ; send up separately a sauceboatful. 322. Soles, wit'll white wine. — Take two nice, clean, and very fresh soles ; cut off the heads, and black skin ; score them on one side, and in the middle ; wipe.them with a cloth, and put them into a flat stewpan, side by side ; salt them slightly, pour over some white wine ; add a handful of trimmings of mushrooms. Set the stewpan on the fire, and at the first bubbling remove it back ; cover it. Ten minutes after, drain the soles, and dish them.136 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. Pass the stock through a sieve, put it hack into the stewpan, to reduce it one third ; thicken it with a piece of kneaded-butter, giving the sauce a little consistence. Set it again on the fire, and at the first bubbling, remove it back, thicken it with two yolks of eggs, and finish by adding eight ounces of butter in small bits, the juice of one lemon, and a pinch of chopped parsley. Mask the soles with this sauce, and serve. 323. Soles, Hamburg fashion. — Blanch two dozen large oysters, drain them, preserving their liquor ; trim, and put them by. Cut a ‘julienne’ composed of celery- and parsley- roots, tender carrots, and raw mushrooms ; blanch these vegetables (excepting the mushrooms) in salted water, and drain them on a sieve. Cut in pieces transversally, three micldling-sized soles, but clean, and very fresh. Butter a flat stewpan, sprinkle over the bottom the vegetables, on which place the fillets of soles. Salt them slightly, moisten with half a bottle of white wine and the oysters’-liquor ; then boil the soles on a sharp tire; drain, and place them on a dish, with the oysters; thicken their stock with a j^iece of kneaded-butter, and remove the stewpan off the fire. Finish the sauce with the juice of a lemon, with a piece of butter, and a little chopped parsley ; after which pour the sauce and the vegetables over the soles, and serve. 324. Soles ‘au gratin’. —- Chop first one onion and one shalôt; then seven or eight mushrooms, and a pinch of fresh parsley. Butter an oval gratin-dish, sprinkle over it a part of the fine-herbs ; baste them with cold brown-sauce, or some thickened gravy, and with a few spoonfuls of white wine. Place on this two nicely cleansed soles, freed of their black skin, sprinkle over the remainder of the fine-herbs, a little salt, and bread-crumb ; pour over them a little plain melted butter, and set the dish in a moderate oven, to bake the soles for eighteen or twenty minutes, basting them with their stock ; then remove them back, and serve them in the dish, in which they have been baked, placing it on another dish. 325. Fillets of soles, Flemish fashion. — Take out the fillets of two soles, beat them slightly; trim, season, and mask them with a layer of red-herring roes, thickened with a little raw force-meat. Roll the fillets out in the shape of‘pau- piettes’, truss, and braise them, short of moisture, with butter and white wine ; let them cool in their stock, and cut them transversally in slices, which season, and set round a salad of vegetables, previously placed on the centre of a cold dish.FISH. 137 326. Salad of fillets of sole (D. No. 42). — Tal tc four well cleansed, pared soles ; split them slightly on one side, and boil them with salted water and white wine. Let them cool in their liquor, drain them in order to remove the fillets ; which pare to an equal shape and length ; put them on a dish, season, and baste them with oil and lemon-juice. Meanwhile, prepare a salad of vegetables cut in small dice (see No. 230) ; season, and thicken it with ‘mayonnaise’ prepared with aspic, and pour it into a cornet of strong paper ; which set upright in the cylinder of a mould. Keep it on the ice, to get the salad firm ; then dip the cornet in hot water, and turn the salad out on a ‘pain-vert’ placed on a dish. Cut off the pointed end of the pyramid, mask the surface with a layer of mayonnaise, also prepared with aspic ; against which place the fillets of soles, slightly overlapped ; glaze them with half-set aspic, put on the top a small artichoke-bottom, filled with small round vegetables, seasoned and glazed with aspic ; surround the base of the ‘pain-vert’ with a circle of halves of eggs, likewise garnished with various vegetables, and glazed. Send up separately a boatful of ‘mayonnaise’- sauce. 327. Fillets of sole, with Villeroi-sauce. — Take out the fillets of two cleansed soles, freed of their black skin; cut them in two transversally, pare, and season them. Chop up an onion, fry it with butter in a flat stewpan ; add to it a handful of chopped fresh mushrooms. Boil the fine-herbs for two minutes, and range the fillets of soles in the stewpan (side by side), to boil them on both sides ; and then let them cool in their stock. Take them out afterwards, one by one, the fine-herbs adhering to them, and dip them into a ‘Villeroi’-sauce, finished at the time. Lay them flat on a baking-sheet, letting the sauce cool ; roll them in some bread- crumb, dip them into beaten eggs, and bread-crumb once more. When ready to serve, plunge the fillets into hot fat, and as soon as of a nice color, drain, and dish them in a circular order on a folded napkin, with a bunch of fried parsley in its centre.138 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. Lean ‘Villeroi’-sauce. — Take four gills offish-broth, pass it through a cloth, let it set ; then drain, and keep it warm. With a quarter of a pound of butter, and eight ounces of flour, prepare a yellow Toux’, which fry on a moderate fire ; remove it back, and dilute, by degrees, with the fish-broth. Put the liquid on a sharp fire, stirring, till it begins to boil; add a handful of trimmings of mushrooms, as well as a bunch of parsley. Should the sauce prove too stiff, lighten it with a few tablespoonfuls of broth ; remove it back, and boil it for twelve or fifteen minutes ; then pass it, through a tammy, into a flat stewpan. Reduce the sauce, till of a pretty good consistence ; season, add a ‘liaison’ of four yolks of eggs ; cook the liaison without ebullition, and remove the sauce off the fire for use. Proceed in the same manner for a ‘fat’ sauce, prepared with strong meat-broth. 328. Soles, Rochelle fashion. — Blanch two dozen oysters. Remove the black skin of two fresh and clean soles ; split them in the centre, range them in a buttered gratin-dish ; season, and moisten them with a glass of white wine, and two tablespoonfuls of the oyster-liquor ; cover, and bake them in the oven. As soon as done, drain their liquor into a stewpan ; add thereto a minced onion, and a bunch of aromatics ; cover the stewpan, reduce the liquid to half, and strain it into another flat stewpan; add to it an equal quantity of brown-sauce, and a dozen raw button-mushrooms, cut in two transversally. Continue the reduction of the sauce, till of requisite consistence ; take it off the fire, introduce into it four ounces of butter in small bits ; finish it with chopped parsley, and the juice of a lemon. Range the soles on a dish, surrounding them with the mushrooms and oysters; masking them with the sauce. ■ 329. Soles, Trouville fashion. — Remove the black skin of two fresh and clean thick soles ; divide each of them into two or three parts. Butter a gratin-dish, sprinkle over the bottom two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion, on which place the pieces of sole ; season, and moisten to their height with cider, and set the dish on a brisk fire, let it boil a few minutes, putting it afterwards into the oven. Ten inimités later remove the soles, range them on the dish. Reduce the fish- stock quickly, take it off the fire, and thicken with five ounces of good Isigny* butter, or if not handy, a little piece of kneaded-butter : sprinkle over a pinch of chopped parsley, and pour the sauce over the soles. * The butter of ‘IAgny’ possesses qualities of incalcudable value for the kitchen. A sauce finished at the moment, by adding a little bit of this butter, becomes creamy, and succulent. Those practitioners fire fortunate, who have it in their power to make use of so exquisite an auxiliary.139 FISH. 330. Fillets of sole, Rouen fashion (D. No. 43 ). — Take out the fillets of five or six small soles ; beat them slightly, season them, trim away the thin parts, and lay them in a large flat stewpan, with butter, and two gills of white wine. Boil them gently ; drain, and pare them square ; put them into a stewpan, and baste with their own stock, previously strained and freed of its fat. With the trimmings of soles, and the same quantity of raw whiting flesh, prepare a 'quenelle’ force-meat, with which mould some 'quenelles’ by aid of a small spoon ; Fig. 43. poach them, drain, and put them into a flat stewpan, with three or four dozen blanched oysters, a few button-mushrooms, whole truffles, and crayfish-tails. Drain the liquor of the oysters, mushrooms, and truffles ; mix it with the cooking of the soles, and reduce the liquid to half-glaze; add an equal quantity of brown- sauce, the peel of the truffles and mushrooms; reduce the sauce for a few minutes, and pass it, through a tammy, into another stewpan, to finish it with four ounces of good butter. When ready to serve, dish up the fillets in pyramids; mask them with half of the sauce, glazing them nicely; surround them, on each side, with a group of 'quenelles’, and oysters ; then place on one end the truffles, and on the other the mushrooms. Arrange the crayfish-tails on the top, and send up the remainder of the sauce in a sauce-boat. 331. Fillets of soles ‘au gratin’, Marseille fashion. — Take out the fillets of three fresh soles, cleansed, and freed of their black skin ; beat them slightly; cut them to an equal length, and season. Prepare a 'quenelle’ force-meat, with a pound and a quarter of raw whiting flesh, eight ounces of panada, the same of butter, and three yolks of eggs (see No. 244). Roll out, over a floured table, eight ounces of short-paste; cut this flat round, and a little wider than the bottom of an 'entrée’-dish ; spread it on a baking-sheet, and mask it with a layer of raw force-meat, half an inch thick. Take half of the remaining force-meat, mix it tip with three tablespoonfuls of cooked fine-herbs, onion, and chopped mushroom ; with this force-meat mask the fillets (on one side only), and fold them in two, bringing the two ends on to the centre ; range them in a circularCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 140 order on the edges of the spread with force-meat ; surround this circle with a stripe of thickly buttered paper, which fasten with string; place in the hollow a bread-support, covered with bacon or buttered paper, thus filling it completely. Cover also the fillets with layers of bacon, and push the baking-sheet into the oven. Bake the gratin for twenty-live to thirty minutes. When done, remove the paper and bread-support, dry off the fat, and slip the fish on to a dish. Fill the cavity with a garnish of small ‘quenelles’, prepared with the remainder of the force-meat, poached; mask slightly the fillets, and the bottom of the dish, with some muscle- sauce ; the remainder of which is sent up in a sauce-boat. 332. Fillets of sole, Provence-sauce. — Take out the fillets of two soles, cut them in two parts ; season, flour, and plunge them into very hot oil. When done, drain, and dish them up with fried parsley all round. Serve separately the following sauce: Provence-sauce. — With the fish-bones, some vegetables, aromatics, and white wine, prepare a little extract of fish, skim off its fat, and pass it through a sieve into a stewpan, to reduce it to half-glaze. Then pour into the liquid a tablespoonful of tomata-purce, and a spoonful of brown-sauce :*reduce the whole a few minutes, take it oft’ the fire, and introduce into it eight ounces of butter, divided in small bits. All must be introduced gradually, without ceasing to stir the sauce. When of a suitable consistence, finish it with the juice of a lemon, a little cayenne, and serve. This is a most excellent sauce. 333. ‘Tourte’ of fillets of sole (D. No. 44). — Take out the fillets of three good soles, and cut them transversally in two or three pieces. Chop one small onion, put it into a flat stewpan with butter, to fry; add two handfuls of chopped mushrooms, which boil until their moisture be reduced, stirring with a spoon. Then add the fillets of soles to the fine-herbs, season with salt and nutmeg, cook them for two minutes, and sprinkle over them chopped parsley; remove them back, allowing them to cool in the stewpan. Meanwhile, prepare a quenelle force-meat with a pound of pike-flesh. With the fish heads and bones, a little wine and vegeables, prepare a fish-broth, which is to serve as a foundation for the sauce. Spread half a pound of short-paste (see No. 197) in a round flat, a little larger than a plate ; set it on a baking-sheet, wet the edges of the paste, and spread over its centre a layer of force-meat, extending to within two inches of the sides. On this place the fillets of sole in a dome-like fashion, alternated Avith force-meat, and masking the top with the remainder of it. Spread another flat of puff-paste (five turns and half) of about half an inch thick.141 fish. Cut off from this flat a stripe, an inch and a half wide, and long enough to surround the dome; else it would be necessary to cut two of them, and to solder them. When the stripe is cut, mould the remainder of the paste, flatten it to a round shape and very thin ; cover the dome with it, laying the paste on the first flat, so as to fasten them one to the other. Cut the paste neatly all round, with the point of a knife, leaving the space requisite, for placing the stripe, that is, about two inches ; moisten the space with a paste-brush, and fix the stripe, fastening the two ends one on to the other. Fig. 44. This done, gather together the remainder of the paste, flatten it, cut out of it seven or eight lozenges ; which carve in imitation of leaves, moisten, and place them, in scrolls, on the top of the dome ; on which make a small hole, placing over it a small round of paste. Egg the Tourte’ and stripe, push it into a slow oven, bake it for an hour and a half, covering it carefully with paper, as soon the paste has taken colop. Meanwhile, reduce the fish-stock to half-glaze, introducing into it about half a pint of reduced brown-sauce ; when this sauce is done, draw it off the fire, and mix with it a small garnish composed of some good soft-roes, blanched and divided into pieces, some small poached 'quenelles’, and some mushrooms cut in two transversally ; these mushrooms may be cooked in the sauce, while it is reducing. On taking the Tourte’ out of the oven, take off the covering, slip it on a dish ; cut the paste of the dome all round, then raising this lid, garnish the interior of the Tourte’, pour a little sauce in through the opening, cover the Tourte’ again, pour the remainder of the sauce into a sauce-boat, and serve. 334. Farced muscles, Turkish fashion. — Select three dozen large muscles, well cleansed ; put them into a stewpan, in order to make them open ; when done, drain them, but without separating the two shells; wash them, and drain again on a sieve. Wash half a pound of rice, and let it drain on a sieve for half an hour. Chop an onion, fry it with oil ; this done, add to it the rice, fry this for a few moments;COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 142 moisten it moderately with a part of the liquor of the muscles, let the liquid boil up, till it be entirely absorbed by the rice, which should be not much cooked, nay not even split. Take it now off the fire, add to it a handful of currants, another handful of chopped ‘pignoli’, a little pepper, and a pinch of fennel, also chopped. With this preparation till the double shells, and place them in a flat stewpan, pressing them close together ; moisten them, to half their height, with good fish- broth ; boil them for twenty-five minutes, on a moderate fire, keeping them covered. Range the muscles on a dish, pour over a little of their own liquor. 335. Perch, German fashion. — Select two middling-sized perch, still alive ; first kill, then draw, scale, and place them one beside the other in a stewpan. Mince into ‘julienne’, kept not too thin, the red part of a few carrots, some roots of parsley and celery : if the roots be tough, have them blanched*; then drain, and place them all round the fish; add a bunch of parsley, a little salt, and an onion. Moisten the perch, to cover, with white wine; let them boil, on a moderate fire, for twenty minutes ; drain, and range them on a dish. Remove the bunch of parsley, as well as the onions, out of the stewpan ; add to the vegetables some raw mushrooms, also minced into ‘julienne’, and let them boil for five minutes ; thicken the liquid with a small piece of kneaded-butter ; take the stewpan off' the fire, and again mix into the vegetables another piece of butter (not kneaded) divided in small bits : finish the ‘ragout’ with the juice of two lemons; then pour it over the fish, and serve. 336. Codfish (cabillaud) with cream. — Take the tail-end of a very fresh codfish, cleanse, score, and boil it simply, in salted water, with a sprig of parsley {see No. 338); when done, drain, and wipe it on a cloth; split it in two, remove the bones, break the meat in pieces; which range by layers on a ‘grathfi- dish, alternated with ‘béchamel’-sauce reduced with cream, but pretty thick, and finished at the time with a piece of fresh butter, and a little grated nutmeg ; sprinkle on the top a few bread-crumbs, or some grated parmesan ; and let it take color in a hot oven, or salamander it. 337. Broiled shad. — Select a good fine shad, scale, and cleanse it well, cut off the bony fins, wdpe it with a cloth ; score it on both sides, and put it on a dish to baste with oil. Sprinkle over salt, chopped shalôt, and parsley; set it on a gridiron, slightly warmed, and previously rubbed with oiled paper. Broil the fish on a moderate fire, turning and basting it. The time of cooking depends on its size: large shads will take three quarters of an hour. * By blanching (blanchir) vegetables is meant, letting them boil for a few minutes in the water, without fully cooking themFISH 143 Serve the fish with a hot sauce, either ‘maître-d’hôtel’, ‘persillade’, or mayonnaise. 338. Middle-piece (tronçon) of codfish, Flemish-sauce (D. 45). — Cut out of the centre of a large cod (cabillaud), a ‘tronçon’ about seven or eight inches thick; scale, and wash it carefully; score it on both sides, then put it into a kitchen- basin, with two handfuls of salt, and a glass of cold water, to macerate for twenty-five minutes. Wash it, then fill up the hollow of Itlie belly with a large carrot, and tie Fig. 45. the fish up, but not too tightly, with a string; set it on the drainer of a fish-kettle, laying it on the belly ; and moisten it with a sufficient quantity of cold water to cover it. Add a good handful of salt, and one of parsley ; place the fish-kettle on the fire; at the fii’st bubbling cover, and remove it back, keeping it thus for twenty- five minutes, drain the ‘tronçon’ afterwards on a cloth, dish it up, garnish with parsley ; serve separately some boiled potatoes, and the following sauce : Flemish Sauce. — Melt ten or twelve ounces of good butter in a stewpan; when hot, clarify, and dilute by adding to it, by degrees, three or four tablespoonfuls of good mustard, the juice of a lemon, a little vinegar, salt, nutmeg, and a pinch of chopped parsley. 339. Shad in ‘court-bouillon’. — Cut a shad in pieces (‘tronçons') trausversally, and let these macerate for ten minutes with a handful of salt. Boil two quarts of water with a few minced vegetables, salt, and a glass of vinegar. Seven or eight minutes after, plunge the fish into the liquid, cover the stewpan, draw it on the side, and keep it there for seven or eight minutes. Now drain the pieces of fish, dish them up, and pour over some caper-sauce or anchovy-butter. 340. Boiled lobster, with red-sauce. — Fill a stewpan with water and 1 salt, sliced vegetables, a few sprigs of parsley, and some vinegar ; and boil them.144 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. Select a large spawning (laite) lobster, heavy, and with large claws ; which tie up with string, and plunge the lobster into the boiling liquid. Boil it, if very large, for twenty-live minutes : a small one will take but fifteen. Let the lobster cool in the water ; then remove the string from the claws, and drain it on a sieve. Remove the spawn out of the shells, and the claws from the body ; split the lobster lengthwise, empty the two halves of the body-shell with a small spoon, putting their creamy substance by. Lift from the shell, the two halves of the tail, the insides of which garnish with parsley-leaves. Cut the tails of the lobster in slices, and put them back into the shell, but in reversed order, the red side of the meat being turned upwards ; open the shells of the claws, and range them on the sides at one end, resting on a bunch of parsley. Garnish also with parsley the hollow left between the two shells, and serve separately the following sauce : Red-sauce. — Put into a mortar four tablespoonfuls of lobster-spawn, with the creamy substance of the body-shell, and six raw yolks of eggs; pound the whole, reducing it into paste, then put it into a kitchen-basin, introduce into it a table- spoonful of mustard, dilute gradually with three gills of oil, and three or four table- spoonfuls of vinegar, in order to obtain a smooth and firm sauce. Season it with salt and cayenne, add to it a pinch of raw chopped shalot, and the same of parsley and taragon, also chopped. When the sauce is finished, pour it into a cold sauce- boat, and serve with the lobster. 341. Lobster-curry, Indian fashion. — Cut in pieces the tails of two middling-sized raw lobsters, and the thick part of the large claws. Shred into ‘julienne’ a Portugal onion, try it in a stewpan with butter, and when of a nice color, add the pieces and claws of lobster, which fry for a few minutes; season, and sprinkle over two tablespoonfuls of curry-powder; two seconds after, moisten, to half their height, with broth. Cover the stewpan, and reduce the liquid to half. Add a few tablespoonfuls of cocoa-nut, shred into ‘julienne’, and also some of the cocoa-nut juice. A few minutes after, thicken the sauce with a ‘liaison’ of three yolks of eggs, diluted with good double cream ; cook the ‘liaison’ without boiling, and add to it the juice of two or three lemons. Dish the lobster, and pour over the sauce. Serve separately a dish of rice, boiled the Indian way. 342. Shells of lobster, with cream. — Cut the flesh of a sea-crayfish into small dice, and put them into a kitclien-basin, with a third of their volume of cooked mushrooms, also cut in dice. Reduce in a stewpan a few spoonfuls of ‘béchamel’-sauce, gradually introducing a few tablespoonfuls of good extract of fish, and some oysters’ liquor ; the sauce being ready, remove it back, add to it the ‘salpicon’, and a little cayenne; fill the silver table-shells, sprinkle over them some bread-crumbs, baste them with hotFISH. 145 butter, and either push them into the oven to gratin ate, or salamander them. Disli them up, and place on each a fried oyster. 343. Lobster-tails, with jelly (D. 46 and 47). — To arrange this entree in the conditions, in which it is shown in the drawing (47), it is requisite to have two dishes of lobster to prepare; then half the tails, turning to the right, are placed on one dish, and those turning to the left on another; thus they maybe dished up together. Else the order of the arrangement must be altered, and the six half-tails be ranged in three groups. A Fig. 46. Fig. 47. Boil in salted water three or six small lobsters, and let them cool with their tails stretched out. When cold, remove their tails and claws ; which latter are opened, so as to lay bare the flesh; which is taken out, coated with aspic-jelly, and then put back again into the shells. Divide each tail lengthwise in two parts ; pick them, and slice their flesh. Cleanse the tail-shells carefully ; wipe them, and mask them, on the bottom, with a layer of chopped jelly, on which place the flesh of the tails applied on the cut side, the red part turned upwards. Meanwhile, fasten on to a dish a decorated ‘pain-vert’, having a small wooden column fixed on its centre; surround the column with butter or parsley-leaves, in order thus to form a base for the tails ; then take the six halves of tails bending- in the same direction, and dish them on the ‘pain-vert’* with the pointed end downwards, applying them against the column, and supported at their base by chopped jelly. * As in the course of my descriptions the ‘pain-vert’ is often mentioned , I wanted to give a model. | This (D. 4G) is in wood, spread all round with a layer of fat, and on the top with a round of white paper. It j bears on its centre a stem or small column ; either in fat or, in wood masked with fat, butter, or paper, j The centre of the column is hollow. 10146 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. Mask tlieir top with parsley, and on this, dish the finest of the claws, supported with chopped aspic and parsley. Run through the top of the column a small ‘hâtelet’-skewer, garnished with prawns ; surround the hase of the ‘pain-vert’ with ‘croutons’ of aspic ; and serve separately a boatful of mayonnaise-sauce. 344. Lobsters, Hamburg fashion. — Boil four small live lobsters, proceeding as prescribed in the foregoing (No. 340); as soon as done, remove the claws from the body, which split in two lengthwise; pick the tails, trim their meat quickly, and range them in a circular order on a hot dish, placing the claws in the centre. Meanwhile, mix in a small stewpan about a gill of melted meat-glaze, with half its quantity of madeira ; boil the liquid, and remove it back. Work up together, in a kitchen-basin, three tablespoonfuls of fine bread-crumb with six ounces of butter, a little cayenne, and a pinch of chopped parsley. Divide this'paste afterwards into small parts, thus adding it to the liquid without ceasing to stir, so as to obtain a good thick sauce, but without letting it boil ; finish the sauce by introducing into it the creamy substance of the body-shell, pounded and passed through a sieve, and also two tablespoonfuls of good vinegar. The sauce should be rather stiff, than loose ; pour it over the lobsters, which serve immediately. 345. Lobster ‘au gratin’. —— Boil a lobster in plain ‘court-bouillon’, and when drained, divide it lengthwise into two halves ; take the meat of the tail and claws, cut it into small dice; put it into a stewpan,* mixing an equal quantity of cooked mushrooms, also cut in dice. Pound the coral of the lobster with a little butter, and pass it through a sieve. Reduce a few spoonfuls of good ‘béchamel’-sauce, introducing into it a little cream and melted glaze ; when ready, add it to the ‘salpicon’ of lobster, keeping the preparation rather stiff, than loose ; season with a little cayenne, and add to it the pounded coral of the lobster. With this preparation fill the two half-shells of the lobster, previously cleansed ; smooth it on the top with the blade of a knife, bread-crumb it, baste with melted butter, and salamander it. When ready, dish the halves of lobster directly on a folded napkin. 34G. Lobster-salad, with jelly (D. 48). — Remove the tails of three middling-sized boiled and cooled lobsters, pick, and divide their meat in slices; which place in a kitchen-basin ; salt, and baste them with a little oil and vinegar. Pick also the claws, trim the meat without dividing, and put it likewise into the basin.FISH. 147 Keep on ice a plain border-mould, coat (chemiser) the bottom with a layer of aspic-jelly, and place all round the inside some halves of hard-boiled eggs, alternated with little groups of vegetables of different shades ; fill the mould gradually with the aspic. Fig. 48. An hour afterwards, turn the border out on a cold dish, and now fill the cavity of the border with a salad of mixed vegetables (see No. 217), thickened with mayonnaise ; but take care to dish it up in pyramids, against which apply the slices of lobster in circles, one above the other ; place the meat of the claws on the top, coat them, as well as the slices, with half-set aspic ; and serve separately a boatful of mayonnaise-sauce with eggs. 347. Lobster (cold) in shells (D. 49). — Cut up, in small dice, the Fig. 49. boiled meat of one or two lobsters ; put them into a kitchen-basin ; mix in a few spoonfuls of pickled mushrooms, or gerkins, cut like the lobster ; season, and let them pickle in oil and vinegar. Meanwhile, prepare a small stand in fat, decorated at the base, and forming a ‘gradin’ ; fix it on the centre-dish. When ready to serve, drain the ‘salpicon’ on a sieve, put it back into the basin, sprinkle over a pinch of chopped taragon, and thicken it, with a few spoonfuls of mayonnaise with eggs. 10*COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 148 With this preparation fill a dozen silver table-shells ; mask it with a layer oi' mayonnaise, and surround it with chopped jelly, squeezed through a cornet. Dish the shells on the stand. 348. Lobster-aspic. — Take the boiled meat of the claws, as well as that of the tails, of a lobster; cut the meat of the tails to scollops, which put into a kitchen-basin, together with the meat of the claws ; season them with salt, oil, and vinegar : a quarter of an hour afterwards drain them. A plain cylinder-mould being embedded in ice, decorate the bottom with details of gerkins and poached white of eggs ; coat {chemiser)* the mould ; on the bottom of which then pour a thick layer of jelly, which let set; on this jelly, range in a circle the finest slices of the lobster, again covering them with jelly. As soon as this jelly has set, pour into the mould a layer of limed mayonnaise, mixed up with whole capers, gerkins, and anchovies, cut in dice ; cover these garnishes with jelly, which let set; finish filling the mould, with jelly and the remainder of the lobster; keep it on ice for full an hour. When ready to serve, quickly dip the mould in warm water, turn the ‘aspic’ out on a cold dish ; arrange the elawrs of the lobster in the cylinder of the mould, surround the bottom of the dish with small halves of decorated eggs boiled hard. Serve separately a boatful of mayonnaise-sauce. 349. Lobster ‘à la Marinière’. — Chop up an onion, a carrot, and a piece of celery-root ; fry them with a little chopped bacon and ham, add thereto a dove of garlic, a bunch of parsley with aromatics, pepper, and cloves; then moisten with two glasses of white wine, boil the liquid for a few minutes, and add to it two middling-sized raw lobsters, cut in pieces transversally, and the large part of the claws; cover the stewpan, boil the lobsters for twelve minutes, then take them out, and range them on a dish. Strain the liquid into a small stewpan, thicken it with kneaded-butter, season the sauce with a little cayenne, and finish with a little meat- glaze, the juice of two lemons, chopped parsley, and lastly with a piece of lobster or crayfish-butter, which introduce into it off the fire. Pour the sauce over the lobsters, and serve. 350. Indian croquettes (D. 50). — Cut up in small dice, the meat of a boiled lobster ; put these into a kitchen-basin with a quarter their volume of cooked mushrooms, also in dice; mix with the ‘salpicon’ two tablespoonfuls of raw fish force-meat. * By ‘chemiser’ is meant, coating tlie inside of the mould with a thin layer of jelly, which ought to remain, of an equal thickness, adhering to the sides and bottom.FISH. 149 Pour a few spoonfuls of‘velouté’-sauee into a flat stewpan ; reduce it, stirring, and gradually introducing into it a few spoonfuls of good raw cream. When of a nice consistence, remove it back, and thicken with two diluted yolks of eggs. Roll out thin, on a floured table, about a pound of short-paste ; and divide it in rounds, by the aid of the largest channeled or plain cutter handy. On the centre Fig. 50. of each round set a small part of the preparation ; moisten the paste, and lay it over, on the top of the preparation, so as to acquire somewhat the shape of a standing purse. Place them upright on a baking-sheet, dip them in beaten eggs, bread- crumb, and fry them ; drain, and dish them up on a layer of fried parsley. Fill also the interstices between the ‘croquettes’ with fried parsley. 351. Russian salad, with caviar (D 51.). — Get a mould of conical Fig. 51. shape, place this mould in a kitchen-basin, surround it with pounded ice. Adorn the insides of the mould with cut gerkins, anchovy-fillets, poached white of eggs, and preserved french-beans : the decoration may be according to fancy, but be careful to dip the details of the decoration into half-set jelly, previous to applying them against the sides of the mould. Coat the inside of the mould with a thin layer of jelly. Prepare a salad with vegetables cut in small dice, operating as indicated in No. 230; | add to the vegetables some anchovies or salt herrings, Cray fish-tails, and a piece of i sturgeon, or of any cooked fish, cooled and cut in dice. Thicken this salad Avith a150 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. few tablespoonfuls of limed mayonnaise ; stir it then on the ice; until it be nicely thickened, then pour it into the mould. An hour afterwards, turn the salad out on a cold dish, surround it with little rolls of a round shape, scooped hollow, and tilled with caviar. 352. Lobsters, Paris fashion. — Chop up together a large onion, and a carrot ; fry them with butter in a stcwpan, moisten with a bottle of white wine, and a little broth ; add to it a bunch of parsley, garnished with aromatics, as well as cloves, and peppercorns ; let the liquid boil ; and, three minutes after, plunge into it two live lobsters. Boil them for twelve minutes ; let them cool in their liquor, drain them, pick the tails and claws, cut their flesh in slices ; which place, in a flat stew- pan, thickly buttered. With the liquor of the lobsters, prepare a good sauce ; reduce it, adding a few tablespoonfuls ofmadeira; finish with a pinch of cayenne, and two tablespoonfuls of tomata-sauce, butter, and the juice of a lemon : heat the slices and claws of lobster on a brisk fire, turning them ; range them on a dish, mask them with the sauce, and send them up. It must be remarked that the meat of boiled lobster is made tender by being warmed up in butter. 353. Lobster, Maryland fashion. — Boil two or three small lobsters in slightly acidulated salt water. Drain, and pick them ; divide the meat of the tails in two, while that of the claws must be kept whole. Place them in a small stew- pan, with a little of their liquor, in order to keep them warm. Pound the creamy parts of the bodies, mix them with six tablespoonfuls of brown-sauce, the same of tomata-sauce; season with salt and cayenne pepper; pass it through a sieve, and keep the sauce in the ‘bain-marie’. Infuse five or six pimentoes in a little ‘consommé’, which mix with the sauce, passing it through a sieve. Split .six or seven fine tomatas in the middle, remove their seeds, put the tomatas into a little pan with butter or oil ; season, fry them on both sides at a brisk fire ; range them in a circular ordeV on a dish, placing the lobsters’ tails and claws in the middle ; pour on the sauce. Accompany this dish by a plate of rice, boiled in fish-broth, seasoned with salt and nutmeg, finished, at the last moment, with a pinch of sugar, and a few drops of mint-extract. 354. Sea-crayfish, Norman sauce. — Boil four small sea-crayfish in ‘court-bouillon’, proceeding according to the method prescribed for lobsters ; drain them, then disengage the body-shells from the tails, the meat of which remove, keeping it whole, breaking only the inner side of the shell. Spunge the meat, as well as the shells ; spread the shells in all their length, dish them on a large groupFISH. 151 of parsley placed on the centre of the dish. Slice the meat of the tails, and range it ‘à cheval’ all along the length of the shells ; garnish the free space left between with fouFgroups of prawns ; serve separately a boatful of buttered ‘normande’-sauce, finished with a pinch of cayenne, as well as with the creamy parts of the shells of the sea-crayfish. 355. Group (buisson) of sea-crayfish and prawns (D. 52). — Cut in slices the tails of two large boiled and cooled sea-crayfish, select the finest of the slices ; which put into a kitchen-basin, season, and pour over them a little oil and vinegar. Select a few dozens of very fresh and fine prawns, removing the beard. Fix a ^pain-vert’ on a dish, having a wooden support fixed on its centre; surround this support with a thick layer of butter forming pyramids, and apply against it, laid one above the other, four circles of prawns. Set on the top of the support an anchor in fat, modelled. Glaze the prawns with half-set aspic-jelly, fill the hollow of the topmost circle with aspic, and dish the slices of crayfish, at the base of the pyramid, in a circle, on the ‘pain-vert’ ; garnish the ‘pain-vert’ with square ‘croûtons’ of aspic-jelly; and serve separately a boatful of mayonnaise- sauce. This entree may, at option, be dished on a layer of set aspic-jelly. 350. Lampreys, with small onions. — Get two middling-sized live lampreys, kill, and scald them in order to remove their skin; remove the heads, divide the body in pieces (tronçons). Chop an onion, fry it in butter; add to it the ‘tronçons’ of lamprey ; season, let them fry for seven or eight minutes, turning them ; sprinkle over two tablespoonfuls Fig. 52.152 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. of flour, and moisten to height with red wine ; stir the liquid until ebullition, add to it a bunch of parsley, garnished with aromatics, and some mushroom-trimmings : cover the stewpan, remove it back on a very gentle lire. On the other hand, pluck two dozen small tender onions, put them into a flat stewpan with butter and a pinch of sugar ; let them fry on a moderate tire, stirring them until they be of a nice color $ season them, moisten with a little broth; the liquid reduced, add some other, in order to cook the onions, glazing them. The fish being done, skim the fat off the sauce, take the ‘tronçons’ out with a fork, dish them ; pass the sauce through a sieve over the fish, range the small onions all round. 357. Crayfish, as in Poland. — If crayfish are not sufficiently soaked, they are clipped by pulling off the soft scale adhering to the middle of the extremities of the tails ; yet it is advisable to avoid such an operation. Wash three dozen fine live crayfish, which then let drain on a sieve. Mince a large carrot, two onions, a parsley-and a celery-root ; let these vegetables fry in a stewpan with butter, moisten them with a bottle of white wine ; start the liquid to ebullition, and add to it the crayfish, as well as some peppercorns and cummin, a little salt, a bunch of fresh parsley and fennel in equal parts. Cover the stewpan, boil quickly six to eight minutes ; drain them on a sieve, remove their small claws without letting them cool. Warm half a pound of butter in a stewpan, till it be of a light brown (à la noisette); add to it two large handfuls of bread-crumb, now adding the crayfish; moisten them with half a quart of good sour-cream ; toss them a little, so as to mix them better with the sauce; sprinkle over a pinch of chopped fresh fennel, as well as a pinch of pepper ; add a large piece of butter, divided in little bits ; and range them on a dish, pouring over the sauce. 358. Sea-crayfish (‘langoustes’) Bordeaux fashion. — Chop one onion and a few shalôts ; fry them in oil, without allowing them to take color ; add the tails of two live crayfish, cut in pieces with their shells on ; toss them over a brisk fire, season slightly with salt, and cayenne ; add a bunch of parsley, garnished with thyme. Two or three minutes after, moisten with two or three glasses of white wine ; cover the stewpan, and boil them for a quarter of an hour. Drain the crayfish; wipe the shells clean, dish them up, and sprinkle over them chopped parsley. Thicken the liquor with a few tablespoonfuls of tomata-sauce, and a small piece of kneaded-butter; let the sauce boil a while, and pass it through a tammy over the crayfish.FISH. 153 359. Sea-crayfish, ravigote-sauce (D. 53). — Boil two fine crayfish, proceeding as for lobsters, let them get quite cool, pick the tails without breaking the shells. Cut up the meat in slices, season, and coat them with half-set aspic. Place the two shells of crayfish on an oval dish, resting the heads on a support of bread, masked with butter, and fixed on the centre of the dish. Surround them with leaves of nice double parsley, set the finest slices on each side of the dish, Fig. 35. the smallest ones on the body-shell of the crayfish. Send up separately the following sauce : Ravigote-sauce. — Pound the fillets of four anchovies, place them in a kitchen- basin, dilute with a tablespoonful of good mustard, and then with two gills of mayonnaise-sauce with egg. Add to the sauce three tablespoonfuls of raw fine-herbs, composed of leaves of taragon, burnet, and chives ; then a tablespoonful of capers, and the same of chopped gerkins. 360. Sea-crayfish salad, ‘à la Bagration’. — Take the tails of two boiled crayfish, pick them without injuring the meat; cut, out of the thickest part of each tail, six or seven nice slices; adorn them with parsley-leaves, and crayfish- spawn; glaze with half-set aspic, and keep these slices on the ice. Cut up, in small dice, the trimmings of the tails, and the meat of the claws ; put them into a kitchen- basin, add to it a small ‘salpicon’ of cooked vegetables, french-beans, potatoes, carrots, some gerkins, and capers. Season the whole with salt, oil, and vinegar. Keep a dome-shaped mould on pounded ice, decorate it all round with green-peas, french-beans, capers, and gerkins; carefully dipping them in half-set aspic, and coat (chemiser) the mould with mayonnaise-sauce; with which fill also the cavity of the mould. One hour after, dip the mould into hot water, turn the salad out on a layer of jelly, spread it on a dish; range the slices of crayfish all round, and send up separately a boatful of mayonnaise-sauce.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 154 301. Red-mullets (rougets), Leghorn fashion. —Scale seven or eight fine red-mullets, range them in an oiled ‘gratin’-dish ; season, and pour over them a few spoonfuls of tomata-sauce. Sprinkle over a little bread-crumb, mixed with chopped parsley, and a pinch of pounded fennel-seeds ; baste them with oil, and push them into a moderate oven to finish cooking, basting with their own stock. When done, take them out, set the ‘gratin’-dish on another dish, and serve. 362. Genoese salad (D. 54). — This is a national dish of Genoa, where it is served at nearly all festive boards ; it is excellent indeed, for stomachs dreading neither oil nor garlic. Its composition is complicated, rather than difficult. Boil a small klentice’ or sea-swallow; the fish being cold, remove its fillets, divide them in little parts, put these into a kitchen-basin, together with a boiled sea-crayfish-tail divided in slices ; season, pour over oil and vinegar. Blanch or cook separately, according as required, the following vegetables, in proportional quantities : whole french-beans, heads of asparagus, artichoke-bottoms, beet-root, salsifies, green-peas, carrots, cauliflowers, and potatoes ; divide these vegetables, either with the knife, or with the tin-cutter, according to the species ; season them, each on a separate plate, with salt, oil, and vinegar. Cut in small dice some pickled mushrooms, and some gerkins; place them in a little basin with capers and stoned olives, anchovy-fillets, and ‘poutarg’ cut in thin slices. Cut two large slices of bread* an inch thick, let them dry in the hot-closet, having removed their crust; rub them on both sides with a clove of garlic; soak them in water mixed with vinegar, and place them on a round dish, in such a manner that all the bottom be masked. Drain, one by one, the vegetables, the gerkins, and the fish; taking them out of their marinade, which put by. Dish the vegetables symmetrically in layers on the bread, intermingling fresh and preserved ones with the fillets of fish, the slices of sea-crayfish, the anchovies and ‘poutarg’, so as to form, out of the whole, a dome of as varied shades, and as regular, as possible. In order to give this dish a still more regular physiognomy, it is convenient to raise the vegetables all round a dome-shaped mould, dipping them one by one into half-set jelly. The sides of the mould being garnished, fill the hollow with the remainder of the vegetables and fish, placing the bread on the top. When serving, dip the mould into warm water, turn the salad out on a cold dish, surround at its base with sea-crayfish-slices, or fish-scollops, and stick into the top three fliatelet’- skewers garnished with prawns. On the other hand, fry in oil a handful of ‘pignoli’, drain them as soon as of a nice color, put them into a mortar, and pound them together with a few swelled pistachios, Instead of bread, small sea-biscuts split in the middle arc sometimes used.155 FISH. and the grated crust of two slices of bread ; add to them the fillets of four anchovies, the cooked trimmings of the fish-fillets ; a pinch of cayenne, a pinch of mint, a little chopped parsley, and at last a few leaves of blite (blette) blanched and chopped. Fig. 54. With all this form a paste, pass it through a sieve, put it into a kitchen-basin; gradually introduce into it two gills of oil, in order to get a kind of mayonnaise- sauce. Introduce now the marinade kept by for this purpose ; mask the dome with part of this sauce, the remainder of which serve in a sauceboat. 363. Russian salad, with jelly (D. No. 55). — Take two middling- Fig. 55. sized boiled sea-crayfish or lobsters, pick their claws and tails, cut up the meat of the tails into slices ; which put into a kitchen-basin ; season them with oil and vinegar. Cut up the meat of the claws in small dice, and mix them with the salad of various vegetables, also in dice, and thickened with mayonnaise set with aspic. Set in a kitchen-basin a cylindric timbale-mould, surround it with pounded ice ; adorn its sides with regular lozenges of white of egg, raw gerkins, or boiled beet-156 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. root, disposing them in the way shown in the drawing, taking care to dip each detail neatly into half-set aspic. Then till the mould with the salad thickened on ice. One hour after, dip the mould in hot water, and turn out the salad on to a ‘pain-vert’ placed on a dish. Coat the slices of sea-craytish with aspic-jelly, dish them in a circular order on the top of the salad, garnish the hollow with chopped aspic, surround the base with nice ‘croûtons’ of jelly, and send up separately a boatful of mayonnaise-sauce with eggs. 364. Red-mullets, Bordeaux fashion. — Draw the gills of eight line red-mullets (rotnjcts dr roche), season, flour, and place them in a stewpan, thicklv spread with butter, or masked with oil, and sprinkled over with chopped shalot. Moisten with a little white wine, boil the liquid: then cover the stewpan, put live embers on the lid, and finish cooking the fish on a moderate fire; after which set them on a dish. Pour into the stewpan four tablespoonfuls of melted glaze ; let the liquid boil, and pass it through a sieve into another stewpan ; then add to it four or five table- spoonfuls of tomata-purée. Let the sauce boil, then remove it back, and introduce into it three ounces of butter in small bits; finish with the juice of a lemon, and a pinch of chopped parsley ; pour it over the mullets. 365. Red-mullets broiled, Nantes fashion. — Get a few nice and very fresh red-mullets ; scale, salt, and baste them with oil ; then broil them on both sides. Meanwhile, put two tablespoonfuls of chopped shalot into a small stewpan with butter; try them for a few minutes, and add half a gill of melted glaze. Boil, then remove the stewpan off the tire, and introduce into the sauce a piece of ‘maitrc- d’hôtel’-butter ; stir, until all the butter is melted, and finish with the juice of a lemon. Dish the mullets, and pour the sauce over. 366. Red-mullets, in cornet. — Fry in oil two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion and shalot ; urhen of a nice color, add to it four tablespoonfuls of chopped raw mushrooms ; reduce their moisture, mix with them a few spoonfuls of capers, a few anchovy-fillets, and a few sprigs of parsley, chopped up together ; then remove the fine-herbs back. Get five or six middling-sized red-mullets, cleanse, season, and baste them with oil. Cut seven or eight sheets of paper in a triangular form, oil them on one side, and shape them into cornets, proportionate to the size of the mullets. Mask both sides of the mullets with a small part of the fine-herbs; introduce them, one by one, into the cornets; which fold and smooth. Set them on a gridiron covered157 FISH. with a thick oiled paper; heat them on both sides, over a very slow fire, and dish them up. 3G7. Anchovy-tourte (tart). — This 'tourte’ is a production of the Southern school, a very excellent dish for an amateur’s breakfast ; but it should be especially prepared with good Provence anchovies, and salad(oZvee)-oil of first-rate quality. Put into a mortar the fillets of about thirty good salted anchovies, cleansed and freed of bones; pound, and pass them through a sieve; place this 'purée’ in a kitchen-basin ; work it, introducing into it, by degrees, a gill of oil, thus obtaining a smooth and mellow paste, not too thin. Take a pound and a half of puff-paste of six turns, divide it in two halves ; one of which roll out in a thi^ round flat, ten inches in diameter; spread it on a round baking-sheet, pare it neatly, and mask its surface with the 'purée’ of anchovies, at a little distance from the edges. Moisten with a paste-brush the paste not masked. Roll out the second half of the paste, keeping the flat a little larger than the first one, pare it regularly, and with the aid of a plain-cutter remove off its centre a round three inches wide ; then cut the flat scrollwise, into eight equal parts, which take one by one and arrange on the first flat, covering at the same time the paste and the anchovy-preparation, and slightly overlapping each part of the paste, leaving a hollow on the centre of the 'tourte’. Fasten the paste to the sides, channel the 'tourte’ regu- larly all round, egg its top, and with the point of a small knife, sketch a small deco- ration on each part of the paste, forming the top of the 'tourte’ ; then push it into a hot oven, to bake for thirty-five minutes. When done, slip the 'tourte' on to a large dish, and pour in, by the central hollow, a few tablespoonfuls of good oil. 368. Anchovy-toast, hot. — Wash a dozen good salted anchovies; open them, to remove the bones ; chop or crush them with the blade of a knife, put this ‘purée’ into a small stewpan, dilute it with six tablespoonfuls of Provence oil, warm it slightly, and put it by. Cut up twelve slices of bread, half an inch thick, of an oblong square shape, place them on a gridiron, heat them on both sides, baste them with a paste-brush dipped in oil, mask (on one side) with a part of the anchovy-'purée’, sprinkle over this layer, a little chopped parsley, and push the gridiron into the oven, to heat the toasted slices (canapés), for four or five minutes ; then dish them up. 369. Anchovy-salad. — Wash ill cold water some salted anchovies, steep them in vinegar, drain them on a cloth, and take out their fillets; which shred lengthwise, place them symmetrically on a small plate or a 'hors-d’oeuvre’-dish,158 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. garnished with groups of hard-boiled eggs, chopped parsley, and onion, separately also with whole small capers. Pour a little oil over the whole, and serve. 370. Anchovy-fritters. — Cleanse two dozen good salted anchovies, steep them in vinegar, wipe them afterwards with a cloth ; take out their fillets, which put on a plate, baste them with good oil, and sprinkle over some chopped parsley. Five minutes previous to serving, roll the anchovy-fillets over themselves, dip them in a frying-paste, and plunge them into hot hog’s lard. When the paste is dry, and of a nice color ; drain the fritters ; and range them on a napkin with fried parsley round. 371. Broiled royans, Bordeaux fashion. — Royans are fish of the family of the sardines ; their form is about the same, but they are smaller, and their flesh is more delicate, and less oily ; they ought to be very fresh. Wipe the royans with a cloth, squeeze firmly the tip of the tail ; salt, and place them on a gridiron, to broil on a brisk fire. As soon as the side next the fire begins to whiten, turn them, and two minutes after, dish them up. Serve separately some fresh butter. 372. Mullet, with caper-sauce.— Get two very fresh middling-sized mullets ; scale and cleanse them, trim off the fins, wash them inwardly, dry them well, score them slightly, and place them in a stewpan ; moisten with a ‘court-bouillon', with white wine, nearly cold ; set the stewpan on the fire, boil the liquid, and then remove it back. Ten minutes afterwards, drain the mullets, and dish them up ; mask them with a caper-sauce, prepared with a part of their own liquor. ■ 373. Mullet, ‘à la matelote’. — Cleanse the fish, divide it in pieces; which put into a stewpan, with a bunch of parsley garnished with aromatics ; add salt, and peppercorns ; moisten it with a sufficient quantity of red wine, to cover it ; add a few small pieces of kneaded-butter, and boil the liquid quickly for five or six minutes. Then add to it about fifteen small onions, glazed separately ; finish cooking the fisli gently. Then pile up the ‘matelote’ on a hot dish, the bottom of which is covered with ‘croûtons’ of fried bread. 374. Smoked ségui, Russian-sauce. — Procure a large smoked ‘ségui’, take out the fillets, removing their skin: cut them into slices, and dish them up, putting them into their former shape. Mask the bottom of the dish with a sauce thus prepared : Piussian-sauce. — Put two tablespoonfuls of good mustard into a kitchen-basin; work it with a wooden spoon, and gradually introduce into it a gill of olive-oil, alter-FISH. 159 nated with two spoonfuls of Orleans vinegar ; finish the sauce with a little salt, and a pinch of sugar. 375. Boiled smelts. — Boil, in a flat stewpan, a quart of water, mixed with two glasses of white wine ; add a handful of salt, the same of parsley-leaves, and a chopped onion. Cleanse two dozen large smelts, wash, and drain them on a sieve. Take a fish- drainer (grille) the size of the stewpan, on which arrange the smelts symmetrically in two rows, their heads turned to the outside, their bellies resting on the drainer; which, containing the smelts, is plunged into the ‘court-bouillon’. Cover the stewpan, and at the first bubbling remove it back. Seven or eight minutes after, take out the drainer with the fish ; drain them well, slip them on to a hot dish, and pour over some plain melted butter, slightly salted, mixed with the juice of a lemon, and a tablespoonful of chopped parsley. 370. Weaver (sea-dragon) ‘au gratin’.— First of all cut the sharp tins (the prick of which is dangerous) off the back and belly of a few very fresh ‘sea- dragon’ fish ; scale them, cleanse, and dry them. Butter a ‘gratin’- dish, sprinkle over the bottom a pinch of chopped onion, four spoonfuls of fresh muslirooms, and a little parsley also chopped; place the ‘weavers’ on the fine-herbs, side by side; salt, and sprinkle, over them also, some fine-herbs, and a pinch of bread-crumb ; baste them with butter, moisten the bottom of the dish with a few spoonfuls of white wine, and push them into a moderate oven, to bake for a quarter of an hour. Serve them in the dish, in which they have been cooked. 377. Roast scoter, with anchovy-stuffing, as in Provence. — The scoter (macreuse) is a species of water-fowl common to the south of France; its flesh is not very delicate, nevertheless, when duly seasoned, it is appreciated by amateurs. Pluck and singe two scoters, remove the crop without cutting the neck, and draw them on the side. Chop two large onions, fry them in oil, or butter of a light brown color, add two good handfuls of bread-crumb, previously dipped in water, and well strained; 1 add also the liver of the scoter, chopped, the fillets of seven or eight salted ancho- vies, a few chopped capers, and a pinch of parsley. Mix together all these ingre- dients, season with a little pepper, and thicken with a few yolks of eggs. With this preparation stuff the scoters, stop the opening with a thin slice of bread, and sew the skins together; truss the scoters, crossing the legs, as for thrushes, hooking the heads to the legs. Run them through with a skewer, which fix on a roasting-spit, and roast the scoters, basting them with oil mixed up (in the dripping-pan) with a few spoonfuls of ‘purée’ of anchovies.160 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. When the birds are done, take them off the tire, remove the skewer, and dish them up, pouring over the gravy from the dripping-pan. Serve separately a chopped- sauce (sauce-hâchée). 378. Sea-hedgehog (oursins) for ‘hors d’oeuvre’. — This shell-fish (coquillage) is common on all coasts of the Mediterranean ; but the finest is caught at Marseille. They are also highly appreciated by ‘gourmets’. Summer is the season, in which they are of best relish. Open the hedgehog, by introducing the point of a large chisel into a small aperture found on the middle of their bristling shell ; which cut all round, so as to lift the half of it off ; drain the water , remove the dark parts between the rays of coral forming a star. This red and soft meat being the only part eaten. Dish the hedge-hogs in a group on a folded napkin. 379. Fricassée of terrapines, Maryland fashion. — ‘Terrapines’ are small amphibious turtle common to America; the same species is also found in Germany, and in Poland. The Americans value them much. Choose two or three live ‘terrapines’, of the kind called ‘diamant-bocks’; plunge them into boiling water, take them out immediately, to remove the horny substance covering them ; boil them in salted water for half an hour. Drain them, open them, and divide their meat in pieces, after having removed head and fins. Put them into a stewpan, with butter and a bunch of parsley, garnished with aromatics; fry them; season them highly, sprinkle over a tablespoonful of flour, and moisten gradually, about to their height , with cream. Let the preparation boil, stirring it : four minutes after- wards, pour in a glass of good sherry; after eight or ten minutes more, remove the stewpan off the fire, and thicken the sauce with a liaison of four diluted yolks of 'eggs. Then introduce into it five ounces of butter in small bits, remove the aromatics, then dish the ‘ragout’, and sprinkle over some chopped parsley. 380. Caviar. — ‘Caviar’ is a product of eastern Russia: that of Astrakan is the most renowned ; but it is from Russia, that it is exported into the different countries of Europe. ‘Caviar’ is an excellent luncheon-dish, as aperitive as wholesome. In Russia ‘caviar’ is eaten by the aid of wooden or mother-of-pearl forks; as it ought not to be touched with metal. ‘Caviar’ is served with toasted bread, seasoned generally with pepper, and lemon-juice ; but some robust epicures add to the ‘caviar’ some chopped chive or onions, which addition gives it a higher flavor. To preserve it in good condition, it should be kept in stone-ware, and left covered on ice. In a high temperature fresh ‘caviar’ loses its qualities.FISH. 161 In the East, and even in the south of France, either pressed ‘caviar’, or ‘poutarg’ is generally eaten ; both are equally esteemed, but they cannot boast the same qualities, as the ‘caviar’ freshly salted. When the ‘caviar’ has.become very salt, it must, previous to serving, be washed in cold milk, and well drained on a sieve. 381. Caviar rolls (petits pains) with oysters. — Take twelve ounces of flour passed through a sieve ; with a third part of this flour, a gill of tepid milk, and half an ounce of german yeast, prepare a light dough. Put the remainder of the flour into a kitchen-basin ; form a cavity in its centre, add a little salt, three yolks of eggs, three ounces of melted butter, and a little tepid milk ; mix the flour with the liquid, so as to get a paste, rather stiff, than light ; work this paste vigorously with the hand, for seven or eight minutes. The dough having augmented to double its volume, add it to the paste, which work five minutes more ; cover, and let it rise for two hours, in a mild temperature. Put down the risen paste on the floured table; let it cool, then divide it into four parts ; roll these parts out to a long shape, cut them transversally, so as to get pieces of the size of a nut; roll these to a round shape, place at little distances on a baking-sheet. Half an hour afterwards, egg the rolls ; bake them in a moderate oven. When cold, open them on the top, slightly empty them, fill the hollow with ‘caviar’, and place a raw oyster on the centre of the caviar. These rolls are frequently served in Germany, and are also highly estimated. 382. Russian Zakouski. — What is in Russia called ‘zakouski’, is nothing but those cold ‘hors d’œuvre’, which the Russians are accustomed to take, be- fore sitting down to their dinner. These dishes are generally composed of sandwiches (canapés) prepared with herrings, smoked salmon, anchovies, ‘caviar’, eggs boiled- hard and chopped. But besides these ‘canapes’, commonly some soused or pickled fish is served, or crayfish-tails, little tartlets, pickles, ogursis, smoked breast of goose cut in thin slices. All these dainties are dished on a little table, where also several kinds of liqueurs and little glasses are kept ready ; the liqueurs generally being Danzig brandy, arrac, kiimmel, cognac. The ‘zakouskis’ are partaken of but a few minutes previous to taking dinner, but without sitting down. In the Petersburg hotels the ‘zakouski’-table is a fixture. liBUTCHER’S MEAT. By butcher’s meat is meant beef, veal, mutton, lamb, kid, and pork. Butcher’s meat, in its various extent, is, so to say, the nerve and soul of the kitchen. There is no fat dinner (diner gras), no festival, where it does not make a conspicuous figure. By the distinguished taste, or by the richness of its substance, the varieties of butcher’s meat are alike indispensable on the table, as in the kitchen. Indeed a classical dinner is not to be thought of, without large joints of meat; and, as for the kitchen, it needs their co-operation for the preparation of the broths, and succulent gravies, as well as for preparing most part of the sauces. Butcher’s meat is served, either as remove (relevé) or else as entree, but rarely as a roast joint; yet roasted or broiled meat is frequently served as an entree, as well as a remove. The darker sorts of butcher’s meat, by which is meant beef and mutton, if served roast or broiled, are to be kept juicy ; as, contrary to the boiled or braised ones, the longer they cook, the more tough they get; moreover by losing their tenderness, they not only lose their flavor, and nutritive juice, but are also harder of digestion. The whiter sorts of meat, such as veal, lamb, and pork, on the contrary, require absolutely to be well done, and not juicy, in order to be palatable, and easy of digestion. The darker sorts of butcher’s meat, served at a dinner, if roasted, gain exceedingly by being carved on the table, and then handed round to the guests; all roast-meat, carved previously, by this proceeding loses most of its nutritive juice. Never forget this, amphitryons. All dishes prepared in the kitchen, at least those not expressly destined to be eaten cold, must be served on well warmed plates or dishes; but u*164 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. above all must this rule be carefully regarded, respecting any butcher’s meat. A roast joint served on a cold plate or dish, loses considerably in its tine qualities. It is to avoid this danger, that intelligent ‘gourmets’ have set the warm entrees and removes on hot-water dishes. All butcher’s meat, served as a remove, and destined to be carved at the table, must be left ungarnislied; it being then preferable, to dish the garnish separately ; but if the removes are intended simply to figure on the table, and then to be carved on the side-board of the dining-room, no reason can oppose their being garnished abundantly, nay even coquettishly, but above all with good taste and intelligence. Ha vino- omitted to o-ive a separate article regarding the carving of C) D I O © o meat on the table, I have, with each one of the articles, given precise directions how to proceed. • 383. English sirloin of beef (D. 56). — Roast-beef is a dish top well known, too frequently prepared in the English kitchens, to require a minute description ; I will therefore content myself with some general remarks. If one wishes to eat good roast-beef, one must not only choose a loin {aloyau) coming from a young animal, but give this meat moreover time to improve, to ripen ; as the meat of beef, destined for roasts, never can be tender, if cooked too fresh. In the kitchen of an ordinary household a whole sirloin is not frequently pre- pared, as these luxurious abundant pieces are reserved for dinners, where there is a great number of guests. Moreover it is not every where possible to get a sirloin roasted to perfection. Let it be assumed, that the piece of roasting beef weighs twelve or fifteen pounds. This piece must be cut off from the centre of the sirloin ; but notice, that neither the smaller (mignon) fillet, nor the fat attaching to it, must be disengaged from the under side. The piece must be slightly trimmed, then bound with thread, and wrapped up in a piece of buttered paper: this being the means of having it roasted well, without giving the outside too high a color. The piece should be brought on the spit with as little piercing through as possible. The meat must be basted frequently, while cooking ; but notice, not with water, but only with good fat. The time requisite for the roasting of a sirloin of fifteen pounds, depends on the thickness of the meat, as well as on the degree of its tenderness ; generally about three hours may be fixed on ; the ‘more’ or ‘less’ is left to the appreciation of himBUTCHER S MEAT. — BEEF. 165 who is operating, and who must be best able to judge, if the beef was quite young or not. The roasting beef must not be unwrapped, till within half an hour previous to its being taken off the spit: it must not be dredged with salt, sooner than at the last moment. Roast-beef, without doubt, must be served as hot as possible; yet I have had occasion to observe, that the meat takes higher qualities, that is, it acquires more Fig. 56. tenderness, when kept in the hot-closet {étuve) for twenty minutes: this observation is especially applicable to meat coming from a large animal. The spit is evidently the best method for the preparation of a joint of roast-beef; yet, when sufficient care is taken, it is possible to arrive at a fine result, even by cooking it in the oven. When the piece of roasting beef is to be cooked in the oven, there must be at disposal a baking-sheet with upstanding rim, to which is adapted a gridiron resting on four feet: on this gridiron the roasting beef is placed, wrapped up in a greased paper. The bottom of the baking-sheet is covered with a coating of fat into which a little warm water is mixed from time to time, so as to avoid its blazing up. But in no case must the fat of the baking-sheet reach to the height of the meat. The roasting beef must be baked in a moderate oven, and be basted and turned repeatedly. When no spit was handy, excellent results have been often gained by operating according to this method. Joints of roast-beef, whether large or small, whenever they are served hot, must be accompanied (separately) by good gravy, by potatoes boiled in water, and by one dish of fresh vegetables, likewise boiled in water ; besides these garnishes, it is convenient to serve scraped horse-radish, or else some horse-radish-sauce, either cold or hot. In England as well as abroad, in English houses, Yorkshire-pudding is generally served with hot roast-beef. L166 COSMOPOLITAN COOKELY. Yorkshir e-pudding — is prepared with half a pound of flour, four whole eggs, half a pint of milk, a little salt, and a few tablespoonfuls of melted fat. Yorkshire- pudding is cooked, either in the drippings of the roast-beef, or in the oven, on a baking-sheet with upturned rim, the bottom of which is covered with a thin layer of good pure fat. 384. Fillet of beef, à la Vernon. — For the creation of this dish, nowa- days so well known, we are indebted to Lord Vernon. His Lordship had resided a long time in Italy, and was, no doubt, a critical amateur of the cookery of that country. Pare a fillet of beef, lard, season, and place it in a kitchen-basin, long in form ; moisten to half its height, with a cooked and tepid 'marinade’, let it macerate therein for six or eight hours ; place it afterwards in a stewpan garnished with vegetables, bacon, and ham ; moisten the fillet to half its height, partly with the marinade, and partly with some gravy prepared with its trimmings. Let the liquid boil quickly for ten minutes, and withdraw the stewpan on to a moderate tire, with hot ashes on the lid, basting the fillet often ; when done, strain the stock, skim off its fat, pour in a little broth and madeira, reduce it to half-glaze; thicken the stock with a little brown- sauce, and three tablespoonfuls of cocoa (chocolate without sugar) dissolved, and diluted with a little broth. Add to the sauce two or three tablespoonfuls of red- currant jelly, two handfuls of dried currants softened in water, and a handful of roasted (torréfiés) 'pignoli’ (kernels of pine-apple). When ready to serve, dish the fillet, glaze it, pour the sauce on the dish, and send up separately some 'croquettes’ of macaroni. 385. Fillet of beef, with truffles. — Trim a fillet of beef, interlard it with raw truffles, season, lay it in a kitchen-basin long in form; pour over a 'mirepoix’ of vegetables, cooked with a glass of madeira, adding to it the trimmings of raw truffles ; and let it macerate for twelve hours ; drain it afterwards, mask it with the vegetables and the trimmings, of truffles, wrap it up in thin layers of fat bacon, and place it in a roasting-pan spread with chopped fat and vegetables, basting it with the 'marinade’. Then push it into the oven, and bake it short of moisture ; when three-parts done, remove the bacon and vegetables, finish cooking it, basting often ; then drain, and keep it hot. Dilute the cooking-stock with a little broth ; let it boil, strain it, then skim off its fat, and reduce it to half-glaze. Add then to it a little sauce, and four raw truffles, cut into dice; reduce it again, till succulent. When ready to serve, dish up the fillet, and pour the sauce over it. 386. Fillet of beef, ‘à la Richelieu’ (D. 57). — Pare a good fillet of beef, lard its centre with bacon, and mask the fillet on both its ends with thin layers167 BUTCHER’S MEAT. — BEEF. of bacon. Set it into a roasting-pan, or a ‘plafond’ spread with trimmings of fat ; baste it with good toppings, and roast it in the oven for fifty or sixty minutes, basting only with the fat of the ‘plafond’. A quarter of an hour previous to serving, remove the layers of bacon, glaze the fillet with a paste-brush, and thus finish cooking. Drain it afterwards, pare, range it Fifr. 57. on a dish, surrounding on one side with farced tomatas, and a group of glazed lettuces; on the other, with six large mushrooms also farced, and a group of small braised cabbages. Send up separately some madeira-sauce. This fillet is to go on the table, and should be carved in the dining-room. 387. Fillet of beef, Polish fashion. — Pare a fillet of beef, which let soak in a cooked marinade for two days ; drain it, lard it with thin bacon, put it on the spit, let it roast at a good fire one hour only previous to serving ; pour then into the dripping-pan half a glassful of the marinade, and the same of sour cream. Baste the fillet with this mixture ; when it is done, take it off the spit, dish then, and surround it with a fine garnish of farced mushrooms ; pass the stock of the dripping-pan, through a sieve, into a ‘sauté’-pan ; skim its fat, and mix it together with a few spoonfuls of melted glaze. Reduce the liquid, until it be thickened to the degree of a sauce ; finish it with the juice of a lemon, pass it through a tammy, and serve it in a sauceboat, accompanying the fillet of beef. 388. Kulash, Hungarian fashion. — This national dish (kulash or gulash) is a stew frequently served, and very highly esteemed, in Germany. I myself ate of it, when in Vienna, prepared by a Hungarian cook, and found it excellent. Cut up into middling-sized squares, the head and the thin end of a fillet of beef, about two pounds. Chop up an onion, which fry in a stewpan with butter, without allowing it to take color, and add to it the meat in squares ; fry them for ten or twelve minutes; season with salt, and a pinch of ‘paprica’; then remove the stewpan back on a moderate fire, with hot ashes on its lid. Three quarters of an hour later, that is, when the meat has evaporated its moisture, pour over a little gravy, and continue cooking it for an hour and a half: sprinkle over the stew another pinch of ‘paprica’COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 168 (or cayenne pepper), baste it with two tablespoonfuls of brown-sauce, and cook it for ten minutes longer. Then add to it a garnish of potatoes in small dice, blanched previously in water; roll them in the sauce, and five minutes later dish up. 389. Fillet of beef, Hussar fashion. — Braise a half ox-fillet, taken off the thicker side. Chop four or five large onions, which fry in a stewpan with butter ; as soon as of a nice color, moisten them with two gills of good broth, which let reduce to glace ; taking care to-do this on a moderate fire, so that the onions may cook during the reduction of the liquid. Moisten them with three gills of consistent brown-sauce, give the sauce a few boils up, and take the stewpan off the fire ; let the preparation lose its greatest heat, then mix it together with a dessertplateful of rasped and chopped horse-radish ; at last sprinkle over a few handfuls of bread-crumb. Twenty-five minutes before serving-time, drain the fillet, trim, and cut it in thin slices ; then bring it back into shape, on a (silver-)dish, alternating each of the slices with a small part of the horse-radish preparation ; then mask it on the top with a layer of this same preparation, over which sprinkle some bread-crumb. Moisten the bottom of the dish with a few spoonfuls of light brown-sauce, then push it into a moderate oven, from time to time basting the fillet with the sauce. The surface being slightly gratinated, take the dish out of the oven, surround the fillet with a garnish of ‘croquettes’, and serve separately a light ‘espagnole’- sauce. 390. Fillet of beef, purée of celery. — Get a good fillet of beef, pare it carefully, proceeding-as directed in No. 386. Interlard it with seasoned fillets of bacon and ham, twist it into a ring-like form, securing it on both ends with string ; salt it, sprinkle over it sliced onion, a bay-leaf, and a few aromatics; wrap it up into thin layers of bacon, which fasten with string. Mask the bottom of a stewpan as for a braise, place the fillet thereon; moisten, to half its height, with white wine and gravy, half and half ; let the stock boil for seven or eight minutes, and remove the pan on to a moderate fire, with hot ashes on its lid, thus cooking the fillet for an hour and a quarter, basting frequently ; when done, take it out, remove the string and bacon; strain the cooking-stock through a sieve; skim the fat, thicken with a little brown-sauce, and reduce one third. When ready to serve, pour a purée of celery on a dish ; dish the fillet thereon, baste it with some of the sauce, and pour the remainder into a sauce-boat. Purée of celery. — Slice a few tender celery-roots (about a pound), blanch them in salted water for a few minutes ; drain, and put them into a stewpan ; season, moisten with a little broth, boil them on a moderate fire with little liquid ; when done, pound them. Pour into a flat stewpan, four tablespoonfuls of‘béchamel’-sauce, which169 BCTCHEKS MEAT. — BEEF. reduce, stirring ; add to it four tablespoonfuls of melted glaze. After a few minutes, / add the cooked celery, and reduce the preparation till thickish ; pass it through a sieve, and warm it without allowing it to boil. 391. Fillet of beef, roasted, poor-man’s-sauce. — Take a good fillet of beef, cut away a part of its fat, remove the sinewy skin, and lard the upper surface ; place it in a kitchen-basin, long in form ; season with salt and pepper, baste with oil, and add the pulp of two lemons (freed of peel and pips) cut up in thin slices ; a large onion also sliced, a handful of parsley, thyme, and bay leaf ; allow it to macerate for twenty-four hours. Then take it out of the marinade, and put it on the spit, securing it with a small iron-skewer. Set the fillet on to a good fire, moisten it with a little oil, and pour the marinade into the dripping-pan; roast the fillet for thirty-five or forfy minutes, basting often. When about to serve, remove the fillet from the fire, dish it up, and pour over the following sauce: Poor-man’s-saucc for the fillet. — A few minutes previous to taking the fillet from the fire, pour into the dripping about half a pint of hot broth; let the liquid boil, strain it through a sieve into a stewpan, and skim the fat. Chop one onion, and one shalot ; fry them with a little oil or butter, without allowing them to take color, sprinkle over a tablespoonful of flour, which fry for a few seconds; dilute it with the strained gravy from the dripping-pan ; then mix the sauce with four tablespoonfuls of good vinegar, and keep it boiling, stirring it for five or six minutes; remove it back, introduce into it a small handful of chopped capers, with three fillets of anchovies ; finish it, with a pinch of pepper and chopped parsley. 392. Fillet of beef, madeira sauce. — Choose a fillet of beef suffi- ciently tender, the fresh fillets being always tough ; trim it, taking out the sinewy skin, and a part of the fat of its side ; and lard it with bacon. Cut up in small pieces the fat taken off, with which mask the bottom of the roasting-pan, or a ‘plafond’; place on it a feAV sliced carrots, onions, and celery, thereon set the fillet, which salt and cover with buttered paper. Pour on the bottom of the pan half a pint of warm water, push it into a moderately heated oven, to roast the fillet, basting often, and taking care not to let the cooking-stock burn. Three quarters of an hour after, the fillet should be done ; the precise point of the cooking of a fillet of beef may be known, when by pressing the meat with the finger, it is found to be elastic ; this is learnt by practice. When done, drain it on a baking-sheet, keeping it hot ; pour into the roasting-pan a pint of good gravy, prepared with the trimmings of the fillet ; let the liquid boil, and settle ; skim off its fat, work it to half-glaze, and thicken it with a few spoonfuls of brown-sauce. Start the sauce to ebullition, then remove it back, to clarify for a quarter of an hour, graduallyCOSMOPOLITAN COOKEKY. 170 indroducing into it three quarters of a glass of madeira; when of a tine taste, and sufficiently thickened, skim off carefully its fat; then strain, and keep it in the ‘bain-marie’. When ready to serve, dish up the fillet, glaze it with a paste-brush, surround it with a garnish of small ‘croquettes’, and send up a boatful of the sauce. 393. Beefsteaks, Naples fashion. — Cut off five or six steaks from a fillet of beef, previously trimmed ; which beat slightly, season, and'put into a kitchen- basin ; pour over a cooked marinade, let them remain therein for two hours ; drain them, then wipe, spungc, and place them in a sauté-pan with melted butter, and fry them on both sides. Un the other hand, put into a small stewpan a handful of dried currants, well cleansed and blanched, in boiling water, for one minute ; mix in it three tablespoonfuls of roasted ‘pignoli’, or the same quantity of dry almonds in shreds. The beefsteaks being done, take them out ; drain off the fat out of the sauté-pan ; pour in a part of the marinade-stock of the beefsteaks, let it boil, thicken it with a little brown-sauce, and a tablespoonful of red-currant jelly ; two minutes later, pour the sauce over the currants, passing it through the tammy, let it boil up, dish the beefsteaks, and pour the s<\uce over. 394. Beefsteaks, Chateaubriand’s way. — The method here de- scribed, is not exactly that, adopted by most people ; but, if not the best, it has the merit of being the one preferred by a great author, and named after him by his cook. Cut off a few beefsteaks from the centre of a good fillet of beef, giving them about one inch thickness; pare, beat slightly, split them in the middle horizontally in two, without separating the parts, thus forming a sort of pocket, a little opened, but going to the extreme limits of the sides. Meanwhile, steep and blanch eight ounces of beef-marrow in one piece ; when cold, wipe it on a cloth, cut it up in slices, which season with salt and cayenne, glaze with a paste-brush, and sprinkle over a little chopped shalot, slightly fried with butter. Introduce these slices into the opening of the beefsteaks, press the meat together, season on both sides, moisten with oil, and broil the beefsteaks on a brisk fire for twelve or fourteen minutes; observing, to slightly raise the gridiron on the side of the opening of the beefsteaks, thus avoiding the running out of the marrow. When done, dish them up, and baste them with four tablespoonfuls of melted glaze, mixed up with the juice of a lemon, a pinch of chopped taragon, and two tablespoonfuls of boiled marrow in dice. 395. Rump (culotte) of boiled beef, with cabbage (D. 58). — Boiled beef cannot appear on the table with the pretensions of being a luxurious171 BUTCHER’S MEAT. — BEEF. remove ; but it may be asserted, that boiled beef makes a very good common dish, if the piece be well selected, if the meat be of a superior quality, and lastly, if pre- pared with taste. A rump of boiled beef, uniting these qualities, may, in spite of the simplicity of its nature, be of high value for all 'gourmets’. Take, off the rump of beef, a large square piece (weighing from six to ten pounds) beginning at the tail and going up to the loins ; this being the piece called pointe de calotte, and best adapted for boiling. Bone the meat, truss (see the Drawing), Fig. 58. wash, and put it into a stockpot ; moisten plentifully with cold water, put the vessel on the fire, add the salt requisite, skim the liquid carefully; at the first bubbling, remove the vessel back, thus simmering the liquid gently. Two hours afterwards, add two large carrots, two large turnips, and one large onion with cloves. Continue boiling it for six hours, keeping the vessel covered, and on a moderate fire ; then take the vessel off the fire. When about to serve, drain the meat, untruss it, trim on both ends, cut it straight underneath, then round its sides, and place it on a dish, either in one piece, or cut in slices and brought back into shape. Surround with a garnish of braised cabbages, and send up separately a boatful of gravy or brown-sauce. 396. Beefsteak-pudding, with oysters. — Pudding-paste. — Spread over the table, a pound of flour in a circle, in the centre of which put half a pound of chopped beef-suet, a little salt, and a gill of cold water ; mix the whole well together, gather up the paste without working it much, and allow it to rest for ten minutes. Roll it out afterwards in a round thin flat, and line with it a large bowl, or a dome-shaped mould wider than it is high. Cut up ten beefsteaks, half the usual size ; pare, and season them with salt and pepper. Chop one onion, fry it slightly with butter, in a flat stewpan ; add to it the beefsteaks; which warm quickly on both sides, thus to set the meat; and immediately place them on a dish. Sprinkle half a spoonful of flour into the stewpan, wherein the beefsteaks have been fried, fry this flour for a few seconds,272 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. stirring it; then moisten with a little gravy and wine, in order to obtain a sauce, a little thickish ; which pour over the beefsteaks. Eight or ten minutes later, till with them the hollow of the lined bowl or mould, alternating with two or three dozen raw oysters well wiped, and masking each layer with a little sauce. The mould being full to its height, fold the paste over on the centre, and cover it, with a round flat of the same paste, thus enclosing the mould completely. Butter and flour the centre of a damp napkin, then put it over the pudding, and secure it slightly below the mould with string. Plunge the pudding into boiling water, and boil it for one hour and a half, minding to keep the pan covered. After- wards drain the mould, dip it into cold watér, remove the napkin, and turn the pudding out on a dish. 397. Beefsteaks, German way. — Take the head and thin end of a fillet of beef (about one pound) ; trim away the sinewy skin. Cut up the meat in pieces, in order to chop it very tine, and add to it a fourth part of its volume of beef-kidney-suet, cleansed and also chopped. Season with salt and pepper ; divide the whole into equal parts, the size of an egg, and form these into balls, which flatten to the thickness of a common beefsteak. A quarter of an hour previous to serving, melt in a frying-pan a piece of butter, put in the beefsteaks, fry them gently on both sides ; for they are soon done ; and dish them up. Sprinkle over each of them, a minced onion, fried in butter; pour over some melted glaze. 398. Beefsteaks, Nelson’s way. — This is a luncheon-dish; to prepare it, one should have at one’s disposal, a small copper -'timbale’- pan, of low form, tinned both inside and out, and provided with a lid closing hermetically. Take two beefsteaks, season them with salt and pepper. Sprinkle the bottom of the Timbale’ thickly with butter, put on it two sliced onions, and on these a layer of raw sliced potatoes ; season again with salt and pepper, then set the beefsteaks on the potatoes, placing them one beside the other’; cover the Timbale’, put it on a brisk tire ; five minutes later, remove it back on a moderate oven, cooking the beefsteaks for twenty minutes ; after which, send them up in the Timbale’ itself. 399. Rump of beef, au ‘gratin’. — Take a cold .piece of boiled or braised rump of beef, trim the meat square, cut it up in thin slices, which place in a narrow stewpan ; pour over a little good gravy and white wine ; warm them on a very slow tire. On the other hand, put into a stewpan live or six tablespoonfuls of chopped onion ; which fry in butter, without allowing them to take color ; mix into it twice its volume of fresh chopped mushrooms, of which reduce the moisture. Thicken the fine-herbs with three handfuls of grated bread-crumbs, baste with a little gravy,173 BUTCHER’S MEAT. — BEEF. bring the preparation to ebullition, and then remove it back ; season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and tliroAv in two tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley. Twenty minutes previous to serving, drain the slices of beef, and range them on an oblong dish, bringing the piece of beef back to its original form, and alternating each slice with a little of the preparation of fine-herbs. The meat being in shape again, pour over the remainder of the fine-herbs, sprinkle with bread-crumbs, pour on the bottom of the dish, the stock in which the beef has been warmed, and push it into a slow oven. A quarter of an hour later, baste the beef with its stock. When ready to serve, drain the fat off the dish, and pour on the bottom a little good gravy, reduced with white wine. 400. Beef à la mode, Marseille fashion. — The beef ‘k la Mode’ here to be described is, without doubt, the most national dish of Provence. Served with a nice roasted turkey, it is quite indispensable for a Christmas dinner, the solemn banquet of the whole family, and which no member of it misses, unless kept elsewhere by matters of urgency. Even besides the place given to this dish by tradition, it is an excellent and profitable piece, being of great resource, for it keeps a long time in winter. It will do quite well to be warmed up, or eaten cold, and still then is "very good. Cut from a ‘noix’ of beef a piece weighing four or six pounds, divide it into square pieces of five or six ounces each, which interlard with fillets of bacon and ham ; season with a little salt, pepper, and a little oil. Chop up a pound of bacon, put it into an earthen stockpot with lard, melt it on a moderate fire, add to it the squares of meat, and fry them gently for ten or twelve minutes, then moisten with half a bottle of red-wine ; which let boil on a brisk fire until about reduced, giving the pieces of meat from time to time a jerk, thus keeping them from adhering to the bottom. The wine being reduced, draw the earthen stockpot on hot ashes, and surround it with such to half its height. Put into it a piece of dry orange-peel, a few whole cloves of garlic, a bunch of parsley tied up with two bay-leaves, and lastly a pig’s foot, boned, singed, and blanched ; or if this be not handy, a handful of blan- ched rinds of pork. Then cover the earthen stockpot, first with a round piece of paper, and then with a soup-plate half-filled with water. After which let the beef boil for eight hours, and mind to keep round the ashes a few live embers, in order to have them always hot ; thus the stock may boil without interruption, but always very gently. Turn the meat but twice ; when the beef is done, it should be highly flavored, and succulent. When ready to serve, place the meat in a deep dish, surround it with squares of tripe, boiled separately, skim the fat off the stock, remove all the ingredients, and pour it over the beef.274 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 401. Piece of beef, ‘â la cuiller’. — Take a small and cold braised rump (culotte) of beef, scoop it out above with a knife, forming a sort of case, which means, leaving a bottom-piece to it ; and set it on a ‘gratin’-dish. Trim away the fat of the meat, take out and cut this into thin and narrow slices of a square form. Slice about fifteen fresh mushrooms, put them into a shallow stewpan with butter, fry them on a brisk fire, and moisten with a little sauce, reduced with a few spoon- fuls of madeira, and mixed up with a little tomata-sauce. Boil the Tagout’ for a few minutes, and add to it the slices of beef, which warm on a slow fire ; pour them into the cavity made on the piece of beef; mask the top with a layer of sliced mush- rooms, and sprinkle over the whole some bread-crumbs, basting it with melted butter. Pour on the bottom of the dish a part of the gravy of the braised meat, mixed up with a little wine, and push it into the oven (at a slow heat), to warm, gently basting from time to time with its stock. An hour later, send it up on the same dish, with the remainder of the stock in a sauce-boat. 402. Piece of beef, German fashion. — Boil in a stockpot, a small boned rump of beef ; when three-parts done, drain, and trim it square, then place it in 'a stewpan, garnished with bacon and sliced vegetables; moisten, to half its height, with broth, gravy, and white wine ; let the stock boil, and then remove the pan back to the side of the stove-fire, putting hot embers on the lid; thus finish cooking the meat, and glazing it nicely. When ready to serve, drain the piece of beef, trim, dish, and surround it, on one side, with Brussels sprouts, and on the other with glazed chestnuts ; pour over the meat some of the cooking-stock, diluted with a little white wine, strained, and freed of fat; send up separately a dish of mashed potatoes, and some ‘velouté’-sauce, finished with extract of anchovies. 403. Small puff-paste patties, with beef-suet (D. 59). — The little patty described here is very popular in France, it is one of the oldest dishes, and no doubt one of those, to which fashion will remain faithful. In ‘Paris’ as in the provinces, wherever there lives a little ‘restaurateur’ or a pastry-cook, these patties are to be had ; where there are no pastry-cooks at all, they are to be had at the confectioner’s. But they are far better prepared at home, and then baked hut a few minutes before eating them. The puff-paste, as made in the large kitchens, even by those, who well understand how to work it, is not always an easy task ; because above all, one must possess the raw materials of a good quality. But good butter, the most active element of puff-paste, is often wanting in small towns, in the country, or in foreign lands; it is to avoid this inconvenience, that175 BUTCHER’S MEAT. — BEEF. 1 am going to describe a receipt, which may be of good service, especially in warm climates. Puff-paste with suet. — Weigh twelve ounces of good flour*, sift it on the table, form a hollow in its centre; therein place a pinch of salt, and pour a pint of cold water, introducing into it by degrees the flour with the water, by the aid of one hand, thus forming quickly a smooth paste, rather soft, and not adhering to the table or the hand. Knead it, wrap it up in a floured cloth, and let it remain so for a Fig. 59. i quarter of an hour. Then weigh twelve ounces of fresh beef-kidney-suet, well cleansed ; chop, and pound it until very smooth ; take it then out of the mortar, and work it in a damp cloth, thus softening it. Set the prepared paste on a floured table, and spread it with the hand into a square shape. Work the suet in the cloth, to bring it to the same degree of softness as the paste, shaping it also into a square, smaller than that of the paste ; place the suet on the paste, and fold its edges over the suet, thus enclosing it completely. Then roll the paste out into an oblong strip, three times longer than its width, sprinkle it slightly with flour, and fold it three times on its length, thus forming a square. Then turn the paste, roll it again, the other way, to an oblong square, three times longer than the width, fold it in three, as before, and let it remain so for ten minutes. Begin the same operation again, giving two turns; let the paste rest for ten minutes more, and give two more turns ; the puff-paste having now six turns. Let it rest again for ten minutes, roll it afterwards to a large thin flat ; and two minutes later, stamp out of it, with a plain cutter, twenty-four round flats, destined to form the top of the patties : as soon as these rounds are cut, gather up the trimmings, roll the paste out thinner than before, and let it rest for live minutes; then stamp on its surface (always with the same cutter), twenty-four flats, which are to serve as bottoms for the patties. Moisten a baking-sheet, place on * The flour should be white, fine, and not too fresh. The oven should be well heated and dry. In default of an oven of the requisite conditions, the patties may be baked in a dutch-oven or in a baker’s oven.176 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. it the thinner rounds, at a half-inch distance from each other, set on each round a small ball 'godiveau’ with chives, the size of a nut; moisten the surface of these flats (round the 'godiveau’), with a paste-brush, and then immediately place on them the rounds of paste cut first, pressing it with the thumb, and after- wards with the back of a cutter of a smaller size. Egg and push the patties into a hot oven, baking them for eighteen or twenty minutes. As soon as done, take them off the baking-sheet, dish them up in pyramids on a folded napkin, and send them up. 404. ‘Mironton’ of beef. — Cut up in thick slices a piece of boiled or braised rump of beef. Slice three or four onions and a few shalôts, put them into a flat stewpan ; fry them with butter to a nice color, add a bay-leaf, then sprinkle over a pinch of flour; a few seconds after, moisten gradually with gravy, and a little vinegar or white wine, thus getting the sauce a little thickish, coloring it with a few drops of caramel, if it appear too pale. Then add to it some chopped or sliced mush- rooms, and a pinch of pepper ; let the sauce boil for a while, and add to it the slices of beef; the sauce exactly covering the meat. Put the lid on the stewpan, and let the beef simmer for half an hour, on a very slow fire, with hot ashes on its lid; skim the fat away, sprinkle over a pinch of chopped parsley, then dish up the slices of beef in a circular order, take out the bay-leaf, and pour the sauce and onions over the meat. 405bis. Pilaw of beef, Barcelona fashion. — Take some meat off the head of a fillet of beef (about two pounds), cut it up into squares of one inch by half; which put into a stewpan, with half a pound of streaky bacon in large dice, one chopped onion, a bunch of parsley, garnished with aromatics, and a piece of butter, or lard. Set the stewpan on a good fire, to fry the meats ; salt slightly, and when their moisture is reduced, moisten with half a pint of broth ; cover the stewpan, and gently reduce the liquid to a glaze : by this time, the meats should be about done. Add to it a pound of rice, picked, washed, and dried on a sieve ; two seconds after, moisten rice and meats, to double their height, with light broth ; boil the whole for five or six minutes, and season with a little saffron, a pinch of Spanish pepper, a little of cayenne, and four tablespoonfuls of tomata-sauce. Cover the stewpan with its lid, on which place hot embers; remove it back. Twenty minutes later, dish up the pilaw. 407. Rump (culotte) braised, Paris fashion (D. 60). — Take a whole rump of beef, trim it on the broad side, thus giving it an oblong form ; truss it. Spread a braising-pan, or an oblong stewpan, with trimmings of fat, sliced carrotBUTCHER’S MEAT. BEEF. 177 and onion; place the beef thereon ; salt it slightly, moisten with a pint and a half of broth, and set the pan on the tire, reducing the broth to a glaze. Then moisten the meat again to its height with broth, start it to ebullition, and immediately remove the pan back on a moderate tire, continuing to braise gently for seven hours : towards the end of the cooking, when the stock begins to thicken, a little broth should be added from time to time. Fig. CO. When the meat is nearly done, drain it on a baking-sheet, mix into the cooking- stock about a glass of white wine ; boil, strain, and skim off the fat. Pare the meat, and put it again into the braising-pan, basting it with the strained stock, to finish cooking it, and glazing it all over. When ready to serve, pare the rump, and cut it transversally into slices. To dish up this piece advantageously, it must be placed on a basis of cooked meat, which may be prepared with trimmings of the piece. Surround it on both i sides with a garnish composed of 'croquettes’ of potatoes, either of an oblong or t round shape, artichokes’ bottoms, filled with small vegetables, and with small ! ‘timbales’ of cabbages. Insert in each end of the beef a garnished ‘hâtelet’-skewer. Glaze and send up separately the cooking-stock, freed of fat, then reduced to half- glaze, and thickened with a few spoonfuls of tomata-sauce. 408. Piece Of beef, Paris fashion. This dish is highly appreciated in Paris, as well in private families, as at restaurants. Take a piece of rump of beef, weighing five or six pounds ; bone, and interlard, | following the grain of the meat, with fillets of bacon and raw ham, previously ! seasoned. Place it then in a kitchen-basin, season, pour over half a bottle of white wine, and let it macerate for five or six hours ; after which, drain, roll, and truss it. Take a fitting stewpan, spread it with thin layers of bacon, set the meat thereon, add two blanched calf’s feet; baste the meat with its marinade, and finish moistening to its height with broth ; cover it with layers of bacon, add to it a bunch of aroma- 12178 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. tics, and a clove of garlic ; start the stock to ebullition, and remove the pan on to a very slow fire, with live embers on its lid, occasionally turning the meat; when three-parts done, pass the stock through a sieve, put it again into the stewpan, add to this a garnish of carrots, turnips, and small onions, slightly blanched ; continue gently boiling. When ready to serve, drain the meat, dish it up, removing the strings, and surround it with the vegetables ; skim the fat off the cooking-stock (which then, should be half-glaze), pass it through a sieve, and pour it over the beef. 409. Piece of beef, Pruss fashion. — This dish is very popular in Prussia; it belongs to the old school, but when well prepared, is not without its merit ; I have seen amateurs of good cookery accept it favorably. H. M. the King of Prussia goes every year to hold a review at the New-Palace of ‘Sans-souci’; on this day, the court entertains the officers and soldiers of the garrison, and in return, the soldiers entertain the King with a dish of ‘sclunorbraten’, prepared in their military kitchens, which is added at the royal dinner. The King, the royal family, and the guests, always do honor to this entertainment. Take a piece of ‘noix’ of beef, about six pounds without bones, interlard it, in a line with the fibre of the meat, with fillets of bacon and raw ham; salt it, and put it into a kitchen-basin; add to it, parsley and celery-roots, carrot, onion; all of which sliced, then thyme, basil, bay-leaves, cloves and peppercorns; moisten with a sufficient quantity of white-beer (weiss-bier)* to cover it ; put a cloth over, and let the meat remain therein for three days (in winter) ; and keep it in a cool place, turning it several times. Garnish a stewpan with trimmings of bacon and the vege- tables of the marinade, set the meat thereon, moisten with its marinade, and add some beer to cover it ; add also a few rinds of pork, let the stock boil, and then skim it carefully. At the first bubbling, place a thick buttered paper over the meat, put the lid on the stewpan, and push it into a very slow oven, or on hot embers, placing some on the lid ; thus the liquid does not cease to simmer gently. Three hours later, turn the meat, and continue boiling it for three hours longer; it ought then to he sufficiently done. Take the stewpan off the fire, pass the stock through a sieve, skim the fat away carefully, and pour the toppings over the beef ; then cover the stewpan, and keep the meat hot. Let the cooking-stock settle for half an hour, decant it into another stewpan ; let it boil, and thicken it with five or six tablespoonfuls of ginger-bread (pain d’épices) soaked in water and pounded ; as soon as the sauce boils, place it on the side to clarify, add to it a piece of orange-zest, the pulp of a lemon without peel or * This beer is sparkling and rather acid, but light. It may be replaced by some oat-beer mixed with a little vinegar.179 BUTCHER’S MEAT — BEEF. pips, and a bunch of parsley, thyme, and bay-leaf. Twenty minutes after, skim off the fat, and strain it into another stewpan; then mix in two tablespoonfuls of red-currant jelly, and after boiling it for a few minutes, take it off the fire. Place the beef on a large dish and pour the sauce over, surround it with a few thin slices of lemon, and send up separately a small dish of salted cucumbers (ogursis), peeled, cut up in pieces, and put back again into shape. 410. Brisket of beef, with purée of peas. — Take a piece of brisket of beef, weighing about eight or ten pounds ; bone, and rub it with salt mixed up witli saltpetre ; place it in a fitting earthen or wooden vessel, sprinkling over salt and saltpetre, add to it peppercorns, aromatics (thyme, bay-leaf and coriander), a handful of brown sugar; put it under weight, and let it pickle thus in a cool place, for a fortnight, turning it several times. When the meat is wanted for use, soak it for a few hours, and boil it in water, proceeding the same as for hams. When ready to serve, drain it, pare it neatly, then dish it up, and pour over a little good gravy, sending up separately a purée of peas, made either with fresh or split peas. 411. Hamburg smoked-beef, with spinach. — The beef of Ham- burg is salted and smoked ; it boasts a great renown in Germany, and is indeed excellent, when recently smoked. The rump, the loin, the ribs, or the brisket, are j salted ; the first of these pieces being usually boned beforehand, then rolled up and trussed. On the contrary, the brisket is smoked with its bones. Take a piece of smoked beef, soak it in cold water for five or six hours, and boil it, proceeding as for hams. When ready to serve, dish it up, pour over a little 1 thickened gravy, and send up separately a garnish of spinach. 412. Entre-côtes (steaks), German fashion. — Cut up a piece of libs of beef, about four or five inches wide, take away the back-bone, shorten the rib-bones, and braise the meat on a moderate fire, with very little stock, ; hasting from time to time, and occasionally turning it; when done, the stock should be reduced to half-glaze ; then take the pan off the fire, and let the meat remain in its stock, until half cold. Drain it on a baking-sheet, let it cool under press. When the meat is cold, pare, and divide it transversally, forming two or three thin steaks; roll these in melted butter, bread-crumb, and broil them on a slow and clear fire, basting them often with butter; when well heated, dish them up. On the other hand, chop one onion, which fry without allowing it to take color, then add to it two tablespoonfuls of good vinegar, and the stock of the piece of beef, 12*180 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. freed of its fat, and diluted with a little gravy. Let it boil a while, thicken with brown-sauce, and throw in a pinch of pepper, a few capers, chopped gerkins, and chopped parsley. Pour the sauce on the bottom of the dish, but without masking the steaks. 413. ‘Entre-cotes’ (steaks) of the Gourmets. — Cut off four steaks from some ribs of beef, pare, and lightly beat them ; season, and roll them in melted butter; set them on a gridiron, one beside the other, and broil them on a clear tire ; five minutes after, turn them ; and put into the hollow, formed in the centre of the steak, a small tablespoonful of beef-marrow, pounded, and passed through a sieve. Meanwhile, place in a stewpan two tablespoonfuls of chopped shalots, fry them with butter, without allowing them to take color, moisten with a few spoonfuls of melted glaze; let it boil, and then remove the pan back, introducing into the sauce five ounces of fresh butter in small pieces, not ceasing to stir, until the butter he entirely melted. Then add to it a spoonful of good vinegar, a pinch of chopped parsley, a little cayenne, and a piece of beef-marrow, blanched whole, then wiped and cut into dice. As soon as the steaks are done, put them on a very hot dish, and pour the sauce on bottom of it. V 414. ‘Agnolotti’ of Turin. — Prepare a nouille-paste, with a pound of flour, the yolk of one egg, a small piece of butter, and the water required: trim a piece of cold braised beef, cut it up in small pieces, and chop it. Fry in a stewpan, with butter, two spoonfuls of chopped onions, without allowing them to take color; moisten with a few spoonfuls of broth, which reduce to a glaze ; then remove the pan back, and add the chopped meat to the onions ; intro- duce into it a handful of grated parmesan; season, and let the preparation cool. Divide the nouille-paste in two parts, which roll out very thin. Take the preparation up with a spoon, and set small balls of it at distances on the surface of a Hat. Moisten the paste, cover the first flat with the second, and press it down with the thumb between each of the small balls. Then cut the flats with a pastry ‘roulette’, in order to obtain some square ‘ravioles’ ; which place on a floured napkin, spread over a baking-sheet. A few minutes previous to serving, plunge the ‘agnolotti’ into boiling salted water, boil them a few seconds, draw the pan on the side of the fire, and seven or eight minutes later drain them. Clarify about ten or twelve ounces of butter (à la noisette), add to it half a pint of good braise gravy; at the first bubbling remove it to the side of the fire, and throw in the ‘agnolotti’: sprinkle them with a handful of grated parmesan; dish up, and sprinkle some parmesan also over them.BUTCHER’S MEAT. — BEEP. 181 415. Tripe (gras-double), Toulouse fashion. — Take a piece of raw beef-tripe (about six or eight pounds), put it into a stock-pot with water, and bring it to ebullition ; then drain, scrape, and wash it in several waters ; divide it into squares of two inches. Chop ten or twelve ounces of bacon, melt it in an earthen stockpot, stirring with a skimmer; and then add to it the tripe, a glass of white wine, a few spoonfuls of cognac, and a sufficient quantity of broth to cover the whole ; add also a piece of raw ham, a clove of garlic, one carrot, one onion, cloves, peppercorns, and a bunch of parsley with aromatics ; set the stockpot on the fire, to boil the liquid ; close it hermetically with a plate, on which put a weight; then remove it on to hot ashes, surrounding to half its height, and being careful to keep round the ashes a sufficient fire, thus letting the liquid boil gently for seven or eight hours without interruption. The tripe is generally set on the fire in the evening, in order to have it cooked in the morning. When the tripe is done, drain it with a skimmer into a colander, strain the cooking-stock, and carefully skim off the fat. Melt some lard in a stewpan, mix in a spoonful of flour, which fry on a moderate fire, without allowing it to take color; dilute it afterwards, by degrees, with the stock of the tripe, to obtain a light sauce. At the first bubbling draw the stewpan on to the side of the fire, and add to the sauce eight ounces of raw ham in dice. Ten minutes later, put into it the tripe, let it simmer in the sauce for half an hour, then skim the fat away from the sauce, and finish the tripe with a pinch of parsley, and two tablespoonfuls of chopped gerkins : dish them up. 416. Tripe, Bordeaux fashion. — Scrape a piece of boiled tripe (about a pound and a half), wash it carefully, and divide it into oblong squares, an inch and a half by one. Peel and blanch slightly three dozen small new onions, put them into a shal- low stewpan with lard ; fry them, season with a little salt and a pinch of sugar ; moisten so as to cover with gravy. A quarter of an hour afterwards, add three dozen small heads of ‘cepes’ previously fried in lard ; add then the squares of tripe, and a clove of garlic. Cover the stewpan, let the stock boil gently for half an hour, skim off its fat, and thicken with a small piece of kneaded-butter. Mix in the stew a pinch of chopped parsley, and dish it up. 417. Tripe, Dijon fashion. — Get a piece of boiled tripe, about ten inches square. Fry with lard, in a stewpan, four or five tablespoonfuls of chopped onion, mixed with a few shalôts; let it take color, then add a dozen fresh chopped mushrooms; which fry on a brisk fire until their moisture be extracted, season the fine-herbs with salt and pepper, add three tablespoonfuls of chopped capers ; allow( COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 182 them to cool, and introduce a handful of grated bread-crumbs, a little parsley, and at last a good piece of butter, thus forming a firm paste. Spread on a cloth the square of tripe, on the centre of which set the prepared paste, fold the tripe over the top, and then sew its edges together with thick thread ; season the exterior surface of the tripe with salt and pepper, dip it into beaten eggs and melted butter ; bread-crumb, and place it on a gridiron to warm gently for twenty-five minutes. Dish it up, remove the thread, and send it up with a little gravy round. 418. Broiled tripe, ‘tartare’-sauce. — Cut up in large squares, two pounds of boiled tripe, place them in a kitchen-basin; season with salt and a little cayenne, sprinkle over two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion, and a pinch of parsley, baste with oil, and let them pickle for one hour. Then take the squares, in turn, roll them in oil, and bread-crumb them ; set them on a gridiron, to broil on a moderate fire, for twenty minutes ; send then up on a hot dish, with tartare-sauce in a sauceboat. 419. Tripe (gras-double), Lyon fashion. — Take about a pound and a half of cooked tripe, cut this into fillets, rather thick, and an inch and a half long; season, flour these by small quantities, and plunge them into very hot hog’s lard ; five or six minutes later, drain them with a skimmer on a sieve. Meanwhile, slice two or three white onions; put them into a frying-pan, with oil, and butter, and a clove of garlic ; fry them on a moderate fire, until nicely colored ; then add the fried fillets of tripe ; season with a point of cayenne, and toss them over the fire until the onion is done ; then take out the clove of garlic, throw into the stew a little chopped parsley, and draw it off the fire ; add to it the juice of two lemons, and serve it on a very hot dish. 420. Toast, with beef-marrow. — Steep in water (for two hours)two or three whole pieces of marrow about two inches long ; drain them, put them into a small stewpan, cover them with a sufficient quantity of strained broth. Start the broth to ebullition, and draw the pan off the fire; a quarter of an hour after, drain the pieces of marrow on a cloth, cut them transversally in pieces, which season with a little salt and cayenne, then place them on some slices of toasted bread. Sprinkle over some chopped chives, dish them up on a napkin, and serve immediately. 421. Ox-tongues, à la Financière (D. 61). — Get two fine ox-tongues, either fresh or pickled : if fresh, blanch them, and then braise ; if the tongues are salted, they must be simply boiled, in plenty of water, on a mild fire.BUTCHER'S MEAT. — BEEF. 183 At serving-time, drain both the tongues, round them neatly on their thickest part, and from this part cut off one piece, which then carve into regular slices. Dish the two tongues, in the order represented hy the drawing, but applying them against a support of fried bread fixed on the dish, then masked with some raw force-meat, which is poached in the oven. Bring back into its place the piece cut off, entirely glaze the tongues, surround them on their basis with a Tagout’ h la financière’ Fig. (Jl. surround the Tagout’ with a garnish of 'quenelles’ formed with the spoon, and other 'quenelles’ studded with truffles; send up separately a boatful of good brown-sauce, reduced with a little madeira-wine. , 422. Galizian-srazzi. — Choose a pound of beef-fillet from off the side next the head, trim the meat, chop fine, then mix with about a quarter of a pound of beef-suet, also chopped ; now season this preparation with a little salt and pepper, then divide in two parts, in order to get two thin strips of seven or eight centimeters (about three inches) of width. On these strips spread a layer of cooked fine-herbs, composed of chopped onions and mushrooms, thickened with a handful of grated r bread-crumb, and finished with chopped parsley. This done, cut the strips transversally of equal length and width, then roll them on themselves in the shape of 'paupiettes’, shutting the preparation in between the folds of the meat. Solder the line of juncture, and range these 'srazzi’ one by one into a buttered flat stewpan. Set the stewpan over the fire, fry the 'srazzi’, turning them carefully. As soon as the meat has set, pour on a little good gravy, cover the stewpan ; finish cooking the 'srazzi’ on a moderate fire. At serving-time, drain the 'srazzi’, pare their ends, range them on a dish ; slightly thicken the cooking-stock with a little sauce, then let it boil up, and pour it over the 'srazzi’. 423. Srazzi, Polish fashion. — Boil three ounces of buckwheat-groats ([kascha), with broth, salt, and butter ; but short of moisture, so as to get it consistent . As soon as it is ready, take it off the fire, season it, and finish with a few tablespoon- fuls of cooked fine-herbs.184 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. Pare a pound of meat of beef-fillet, taken from tlie side near the head. Chop this meat, season, divide it in two; then flatten the mince, with the blade of the knife, into a thin strip of three inches’ width. On this strip, now spread a layer of the previously prepared ‘kascha’, then transversally divide the strip in pieces two inches long ; roll these pieces up about themselves, in such a manner that the strip of meat enclose the ‘kascha’. Bind the ‘srazzi’ with thread, range them one beside the other into a flat stewpan, which is buttered, and sprinkled with a pinch of onion chopped fine. Set the stewpan on the fire, let the ‘srazzi’ fry slightly, then cover the stewpan, and finish cooking the ‘srazzi’ on a very mild fire, with hot embers on the lid of the stewpan. At serving-time, dish the ‘srazzi’, mix into their cooking-stock a little white wine and a little sauce ; let the sauce reduce, till it be succulent ; pass it through a sieve, finish with a little of chopped parsley, and pour it over the Srazzi’. 424. ‘Tournedos’, with madeira. - Take off the head of a pared fillet of beef, previously trimmed ; cut eight or ten slices, of the thickness of a half- crown-piece, and about the size of a fillet of chicken, but of an oblong shape; beat them slightly with the handle of a knife; pare, and season with salt and pepper. Warm some clarified butter in a sauté-pan, sprinkle over a pinch of chopped onion, and on that place the ‘tournedos’-slices one beside the other ; fry them on both sides, and when set, moisten with a gill of gravy, which reduce to glaze; turn them, and moisten anew, reducing the stock once more on a moderate fire, thus cooking the meat gently, and glazing it. When the ‘tournedos’ are done, dish them in a circular order, dilute the cooking-stock with a glass of madeira ; let it boil, and two minutes later, thicken with four tablespoonfuls of reduced brown-sauce ; then pour it immediately over the ‘tournedos’, alternating each of them with fried brcad-‘croûtons’, cut .the shape of a cock’s-comb, and glazed with a paste-brush. 425. ‘Paupiettes’ of ox-palates, Italian way. — Take five or six fillets of ox-palates, cooked ; trim them straight, divide them, each in two parts; mask them on one surface with a layer of cooked fine-herbs, finished with truffles, and thickened with a little force-meat. Roll then the ox-palates round themselves, so as to shape them into ‘polpetti’ ; keep them in shape, by means of two small wooden-skewers ; dip into beaten eggs, bread-crumb, and plunge them into plenty of hot fat. When the ‘paupiettes’ are drained, draw out the skewers, and range the ‘paupiettes’, pyramidwise, on a folded napkin. 426. Paupiettes (‘polpetti’) of ox-palates, with truffles (D.62).— Take ten cooked fillets of ox-palates, pare them, diminish their length a little; mask them on one side with a layer of raw force-meat, mixed with a quarter its volume ofBUTCHER’S MEAT. BEEF. 185 chopped fat-liver. Roll the fillets up, so as to form the ‘polpetti’ ; let them be rather thick, tie them together, wrap them up in strips of bacon, and range them, one beside the other, in a flat stew-pan ; beat them on a mild fire, with a little good stock, mixed with wine. Fig. 62. At serving-time, uncover the ‘polpetti’, pare, and carefully glaze them ; dish them, in an upright position, on a layer of force-meat poached on a dish, and forming a circle. Place in the middle a mince of truffles, Italian fashion: serve separately a boatful of good brown-sauce, reduced with the truffle-trimmings. 427. Ox-tongue ‘à l’écarlate’, raisin-sauce. — Get an ox-tongue, which has been soaked twelve or fourteen days in brine ; soak it in cold water for two or three hours; afterwards drain it, and place it in a stew pan ; pour over a sufficient quantity of water to cover it, start it to ebullition, and at the first bubbling, draw the pan on the side of the fire, keeping the water simmering for three hours. Then take the stewpan off the fire. Half an hour later, drain the tongue, remove the skin, pare, dish, and mask it with the following sauce: I Raisin-sauce. — Pour into a stewpan a glass of vinegar, add a bunch of parsley, thyme, bay-leaf, cloves, and peppercorns; reduce the liquid to half; mix with it a pint of gravy, let it boil, and thicken with a tablespoonful of potato-flour, diluted with cold water ; five minutes later, pass the sauce, through a sieve, into another stewpan; then add two tablespoonfuls of red-currant jelly, and two handfuls of currants and sultanas, picked out, and washed in warm water ; let it boil, for five or six minutes, on a moderate fire ; then pour it over the tongue. 428. Ox-tongue, with sour-crout. — Boil a pickled ox-tongue (sec No. 430). Pour into a small stewpan a pint of gravy, and a glass of madeira ; add to it a bunch of parsley and aromatics, a few peppercorns, and a handful of trimmings of mushrooms ; reduce the liquid to half, thicken with brown-sauce, and draw the stewpan on the side of the fire. When the tongue is done, drain it, and remove the skin; place it in a stewpan, and pour the sauce over; start it to ebullition, and put the stewpan over hot ashes, letting the tongue simmer in the sauce for half an hour.186 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. Afterwards dish it up on a layer of good sour-crout, pour over a little sauce, and send up the remainder in a sauceboat. 429. Ox-tongue ‘à l’écarlate’, chestnut-purée. — Soak and hoil in water a pickled ox-tongue, for two hours; drain it, in order to remove the skin; place it in a stewpan, garnished with sliced vegetables and aromatics; moisten, to half its height, with broth and white wine; and covering it with a round of paper, finish cooking it gently, occasionally turning it. When nicely glazed, dish it up on a purée of chestnuts, being a little thiekish ; pour a little broth into the cooking- stock, let it boil, skim off its fat, strain, and reduce it to a half-glaze; pour it over the tongue. 430. Ox-tongue, With sorrel. — Having first removed its root, wash a fresh ox-tongue, and put it into a stewpan of tepid water ; set the pan on the fire, and bring it to ebullition ; then drain, and boil it for two hours, simply in water, with vegetables and a bunch of aromatics. Take it out, remove the skin, and place it in a stewpan garnished with vegetables; moisten, to half its height, with gravy and white wine. Cover the stewpan, set it on the fire, reduce the liquid to half, and finish cooking the tongue gently, reducing the moisture to a glaze; being careful to turn it, thus glazing it on both sides. When ready to serve, pour over the dish a puree of sorrel, on which place the tongue, and baste it with the cooking-stock, diluted with gravy, freed of its fat, strained, and reduced into half-glaze. 431. Ox-tongue, Italian-sauce. —Boil ill salted water a fresh ox-tongue; after an hour and a half of ebullition, drain it, remove the skin, interlard it inwardly with fillets of bacon and raw ham. Spread the bottom of a stewpan with a layer of the trimmings of bacon and sliced vegetables, over which put a few trimmings of veal, and then the ox-tongue. Moisten with a little broth, cover the stewpan, place it on the fire, and reduce the moisture to a glaze; moisten the tongue once more, to half its height, with broth and white wine ; cover it with a buttered paper, and finish cooking it on a moderate fire, turning it. When done, drain it, glaze it in the oven, and dish it up with the following sauce : Italian Sauce. — Dilute the cooking-stock of the tongue with a little broth; let it boil, and then pass it through a sieve. Chop up one onion with a few shalôts, put it into a stewpan with a whole clove of garlic; fry it, without allowing it to take color, and add to it a few handfuls of fresh chopped mushrooms in small diep. The moisture of these being evaporated, moisten with the cooking-stock, and thicken with a little brown-sauce. Let the sauce boil on the side of the stove-fire, to clarify ; skim off’ its fat, and reduce it. Add to it five ounces of lean ham, cooked and cut into dice, a few raw truffles, peeled and also cut in dice ; then a quarter of an hour later, place the tongue on a dish, and mask it with the sauce.BUTCHER’S MEAT. — BEEF. 187 432. Timbale of ‘amourettes’, Roman fashion (D. 63.) — Take two pounds of spinal marrow of beef, commonly called amourettes*; remove the sinewy skin wrapping it up, let soak for a few hours ; drain it, place it in a stewpan, cover with tepid water; add to the above a little salt, a drop of vinegar, a minced onion, a hunch of parsley. Let the liquid boil for three minutes, take the marrow off the fire, which let cool in their own liquor. Transvcrsally cut the marrow in pieces two inches long, place these pieces in a stewpan, season them, pour over a little good yellow sauce, sprinkle over half a pound of cooked lean ham, cut in small dice, the same of black truffles, cooked, cut like the ham. Take two pounds of veal or poultry force-meat, finished with a little sauce. Butter a dome-shaped mould, adorn the bottom, and round the sides, with truffles ; then mask the inside of the mould with a layer of the ready- made force-meat, applying it half an inch thick. T1 iree quarters of an hour previous to serving, place the cold ‘ragout’ in the hollow of the mould, mask it on the top with a layer of the same force-meat, and cover this with a round of buttered paper ; set the mould on a hollow support, placed on the bottom of a stewpan higher than the mould ; pour boiling water into the stewpan, up to half the height of the mould ; let the water boil, cover the stewpan, place it on a very moderate fire, so as to maintain the water simmering, without allowing it to boil. When time to serve, turn the mould over on a cloth, in order to spungc its interior moisture, then turn the ‘timbale’ out on a dish ; surround it with heads of mushrooms; mask the bottom of this dish with a little good ‘velouté’-sauce, and serve a boatful separately. 433. Ox-tongue-mince, Toulouse fashion. — Trim a piece of cold braised ox-tongue, divide it into oblong squares, which cut transversally into slices ; * In Italy and Germany, this marrow is always removed from oxen and. calves by the butchers, in order to be sold separately.188 COSMOPOLITAN cookery. place them in a stewpan, add to it a few sliced raw truffles, and keep the whole covered. Slice one onio , as well as three small tender artichokes ; cut each in four parts ; put them it into a frying-pan with oil, season with salt and pepper; fry them on a moderate fire, tossing them often. When done, add a tablespoonful of chopped parsley ; a few seconds after, add the slices of tongue, and the truffles ; toss them on the fire for three minutes, and remove the pan back ; adding then to the mince the juice of two lemons. Dish it up, surrounding it with fried bread-'eroûtons.’ 434. Ouson-Kebàb, Turkish roast. — Cut up a piece of fillet of beef into large square slices, season with salt and pepper, then run them through with a small skewer, alternating them, each slice with a slice of sheep’s tail fat,* and a few bay-leaves, squeezing all the pieces one against the other. Roast them afterwards at a roasting-fire ; and when the meat is done, salt it, take it off the fire, and dish it up. 435. Muzzle (mufle) of beef, with curry. — Take a boiled muzzle of beef, divide it into middling-sized squares. Chop one onion, fry it in a stewpan with butter, without allowing it to take color; add to it the pieces of meat ; fry them also, tossing them ; season, and sprinkle over two tablespoonfuls of Hour, and as much of curry-powder. Two minutes later, moisten (off the fire, and by degrees), with broth and a little white wine; add a bunch of parsley garnished with aromatics, stir the stock on the fire till ebullition, and then remove the stewpan back. Twenty- five minutes after, skim the f'at off the sauce, and thicken with two or three yolks of eggs, diluted with cream; finish with the juice of two lemons; dish up in a border of rice. 433. Ox-palates, gratinated. — Scald four or five palates, until the skin comes off by scraping them with a knife; when cleansed, refresh them, put them into a stewpan with a little white wine, salt, cloves, and peppercorns, one onion, one carrot, and a bunch of aromatics: cover them with water, and boil them, like a stock-pot, for four or five hours. On the other hand, slice four dozen fresh and clean mushrooms. Chop one onion, fry it in a stewpan with butter, stirring, and not allowing it to take color; add the mushrooms; when these have evaporated their moisture, add to the fine-herbs a bunch of parsley, garnished with a clove of garlic and aromatics; season with salt, and a pinch of cayenne. Thicken the mince with a few spoonfuls of ‘béchamel’-sauce let them boil, and remove the pan back. * The sheeps’ tail takes in Turkey the place of bacon, which is forbidden by the laws of the Prophet. I have seen in Constantinople, sheeps’ tails, which without any exaggeration, weighed twenty pounds: this being the reason, why the tails of the live sheep are supported by a sort of small cart, on which it rests The Turks are very fond of the fat of these sheeps’ tails.189 BUTCHER'S MEAT. BEEF. Drain the ox-palates when done, wipe them on a cloth, pare them into small oblong squares; season, and mix them with the fine-herbs, adding also a little chopped parsley. Range the palates and fine-herbs into a deep dish ; sprinkle over some bread-crumbs, baste with melted butter, and allow them to gratinate for twenty minutes on a moderate oven. 437. ‘Bouchées’ Of ox-palates. — The method for making the‘bouchées’ is described No. 403. Cut up in small dice two or three boiled cold ox-palates, and place them in a stewpan with one-third their volume of cooked mushrooms, also cut in dice. Pour into a stewpan a few spoonfuls of ‘béchamel’-sauce, finished at the time and passed through a sieve ; reduce it, stirring, and gradually introducing into it about half a gill of melted glaze ; thicken the ‘salpicon’ with it, and keep the stewpan in the ‘bain-marie’. When ready to serve, heat the ‘bouchées’, garnish them with the preparation, cover, and dish them up on a napkin. 438. ‘Attereaux’ of ox-palates. — Cut up a few boiled ox-palates into squares of half an inch, place them in a kitchen-basin; season, and mix in three tablespoonfuls of cooked fine-herbs ; add half their volume of truffles and mushrooms, cut likewise. Run small skewers, through the squares of meat, truffles, and mushrooms, and dip them into some ‘villeroy’-sauce, prepared at the time, and warm; set them on a baking-sheet, at small distances, and let the sauce cool. After- wards, take the ‘attereaux’ off the baking-sheet, roll them in bread-crumbs, dip them into beaten eggs, and bread-crumb them once more. When ready to serve, plunge the ‘attereaux’ into hot hog’s lard ; as soon as of a nice color, drain, and dish them up on a folded napkin, with fried parsley round. 439. Croquettes of ox-palates. — Scald five or six ox-palates, scrape, refresh, and place them in a stewpan, strewn with chopped fat and vegetables; moisten with a sufficient quantity of broth and white wine to cover them ; add a bunch of aromatics, and boil them on a slow fire for three or four hours ; let them cool in their stock ; drain them, cut them into small dice, which put into a kitchen- basin, with half their volume of cooked mushrooms, and as much of ox-tongue, both in dice. Pour a few spoonfuls of‘béchamel -sauce into a stewpan, reduce it on the fire, stirring; and introduce into it a few spoonfuls of raw cream, and a little melted glaze. When the sauce is become succulent, and well thickened, add to it the ‘sal- picon’, and remove the pan back. Season with salt and nutmeg, pour the preparation on a dish to cool, and then proceed to make the ‘croquettes’ in the shape of stopples or pears; bread-crumb them, egg, fry, and dish them up, in pyramids, on a folded napkin, with parsley round.190 COSMOPC)LITAN COOKERY. 440. Ox-tail broiled, Alsace fashion. — Divide an ox-tail, into pieces three inches long ; which scald, and boil in little liquid without glazing ; let them cool in their own stock, and drain them. When cold, roll them in melted butter, bread- crumb, and broil them on a slow fire for twenty-five minutes ; dish them up on a garnish of sour-crout. 441. Ox-tail, with chestnut-purée. — Get a fresh ox-tail, cut the thickest part into pieces three or four inches long ; which soak for two hours ; after- wards scald them. Garnish an oblong stewpan with trimmings of fat bacon and sliced vegetables, add a few sprigs of aromatics, on which place the pieces of ox-tail; salt slightly, moisten to their height with broth and white wine, covering them with pork-rinds. Start the stock to ebullition, then draw the pan back, put a few live embers on its lid, and braise the ox-tail for five or six hours, adding some more stock from time to time. When done, drain the pieces, range them on a dish, surround them with four groups of chestnut-purée, two of them at the ends, and two on the sides. Dilute the cooking-stock with a little gravy, let it boil, strain, and skim off its faj ; then reduce, and pour it on the bottom of the dish. 442. ‘Tourte’ of ox-palate. — This is a very old entrée, seldom served now-a-days in Paris ; still it is in country use, and may be given sometimes ; being- good, simple, and cheap. Take an ox’-palate, with the muzzle (mufle) adhering to it ; scald, scrape it with a knife to remove the white skin ; singe, and boil it, proceeding as for the calf’s head ; it requires at least five hours’ boiling; when done, drain, refresh, and wipe it well, then divide it into middling-sized squares. Melt in a stewpan, half a pound of chopped fat-bacon, add to it a small chopped onion, fry it without allowing it to take color, and add to it seven or eight mushrooms also chopped. When these have reduced their moisture, add the squares of meat, fry them, season highly, and a few minutes after, sprinkle over a pinch of chopped chives and parsley. Place the meats on a dish, and let them cool. Prepare two pounds of common ‘godiveau’ force-meat, finish it with a pinch of chives ; take half of it, and divide it, on a floured table, forming some small round ‘quenelles’; which poach in salted water, draining them immediately. Spread over a round baking-sheet, a flat of short-paste, moisten its edges, and put on its centre a layer of ‘godiveau’, forming a cavity, and reaching to one inch and a half within the edge. On this ‘godiveau’, place the prepared ‘ragout’ intermingled with the ‘quenelles’, giving it a dome-like shape ; mask the top of it with a thick layer ot bacon, and cover it with a flat, made with the trimmings of puff-paste. Finish the ‘tourte’ as directed in No. 333 ; egg, and push it into the oven. As soon as the paste is colored, cover it with paper. An hour after, slip the ‘tourte’ on to a dish, make191 BUTCHER’S MEAT. — VEAL. a circular incision on the top of it, with the point of a knife, and through this opening remove the bacon ; pour a light sauce into the hollow, then cover the ‘tourte’ again, and send it up immediately. 443. ‘Noix’, or cushion, of veal; ‘à la Duchesse’ (D. 64). — The ‘noix’ or cushion is that part of the leg of veal, adhering to the thigh-bone, and partly covered by the udder (tétine). Fig. 64. Choose a nice, large, and white ‘noix’ of veal, pare and stud (clouter) it with square fillets of raw truffles, pointed on one end ; salt slightly, cover the studded part with thin layers of bacon ; truss, and set it in a*Stewpan, strewn with trimmings or thin slices of fat bacon ; pour over a little clarified butter, and braise it in a moderate oven, for two hours, basting with the fat in the stewpan. Afterwards take away the bacon and string, dish the meat, surround with ‘Duchesse’-potatoes in an oblong square shape; glaze, and send up separately a boatful of brown-sauce, reduced with some of the cooking-stock, the trimmings of the truffles, and a little wine. 444. ‘Noix’ of veal, ‘à la Soubise’. — Slip the ‘noix’ from the leg, remove the skin surrounding the udder, without touching this, and interlard the meat with fillets of bacon. Garnish the bottom of a stewpan with trimmings of lard, raw ham, and sliced vegetables; set the ‘noix’ on these, salt slightly, moisten, about to its height, with broth and white wine; add a bunch of parsley with aromatics, cloves, peppercorns, and the pulp of a lemon freed of peel and pips. Cover the meat, with a buttered paper, start the liquid to ebullition, draw the stewpan on the side of the tire, with warm ashes on its lid, and braise the ‘noix’ gently for two or three hours, according to its size, basting frequently. ,192 COSM<)POLITAN COOKERY. Whdn tlie meat is done, the stock should be reduced to halt-glaze; drain the meat on a baking-sheet, and set it on a layer of ‘Soubise’-purée, placed on the centre of a dish; dilute the stock with a little broth, reduce it to half-glaze, skim off'its fat, and pass it through a sieve, on the bottom of the dish. 445. ‘Noix’ of veal, ‘à la cuiller’. — Get a good ‘noix’ of veal, lard it inwardly with fillets of bacon, place it in a kitchen-basin, baste with a glass of madeira, and add a few trimmings of mushrooms, a few sprigs of aromatics, cloves, and peppercorns ; cover it then with paper, and let it remain thus on a cool place for ten or twelve hours. Strew a fitting stewpan with trimmings of bacon, and thick slices of onion and carrot ; place the meat on it, baste it with its ‘marinade’, add a few fresh pork-rinds, and cover it with buttered paper ; set the stewpan on the fire ; after a few minutes of ebullition, draw it on hot ashes with fire on its lid, keeping the fire always at the same degree, thus braising the ‘noix’ for three or four hours. When ready to serve, take the ‘noix’ out of the stewpan, drain, and place it on a dish ; skim the fat from the stock, add a little gravy, boil, and pass it through a sieve over the meat, sending up separately a purée of chestnuts, or of celery. This ‘noix’ should be sufficiently done and tender, to be carved with a spoon. 44G. ‘Noix’ of veal, with green-pease. — Interlard a ‘noix’ of veal (not trimmed) with fillets of bacon and of raw ham. Chop eight ounces of bacon, melt it in a stewpan, fry the ‘noix’ therein on a moderate tire, frequently turning it; when of a nice color, moisten, to a quarter its height, with half a pint of broth, and add to it a sliced carrot, and one onion studded with cloves. Continue braising the meat for two hours, always on a moderate fire, with hot ashes on the lid. When the ‘noix’ is about three-parts done, remove the onion and the carrot, surround it with a pint and a half of tender green-pease, and eight ounces of streaky bacon in mid- dling-sized squares; add a bunch of parsley, garnished with aromatics; cover the stewpan, and finish cooking meat and pease on a slow fire; drain afterwards the noix’, remove the bunch, thicken the pease with a piece of kneaded-butter, season with a point of nutmeg, range them on a dish, and put on it the ‘noix’. 447. ‘Noix’ of veal, Bordeaux fashion. — In those countries, where the calf’s meat is lean and dry, cooks must apply themselves to supply its deficiencies by some ingenious preparations. In small kitchens, one should try to make the most of every thing, the essential point being to give to those preparations a good appearance. Take a cooked ‘noix’ of veal (braised is preferable); divide it in slices, not too thick, and keep them covered in a dish. Wash two dozen heads of Bordeaux- ‘eèpes’ ; drain, and slice them. Chop one onion, put it into a frying-pan with butter,193 BUTCHER'S MEAT. — VEAL. and fry, without allowing it to take color; then add to it the sliced ‘cèpes’, to be fried quickly, reducing their moisture; season with salt and pepper, sprinkle over a little flour, and moisten with a few spoonfuls of gravy ; boil the sauce for ten minutes, reducing it, in order to have it short and thickish : then finish the ‘ragout’ with a pinch of chopped parsley or fennel. Thirty-five minutes previous to serving, spread a layer of the ‘ragout’ on a dish, and thereon set the meat cut up, alternating each slice with a part of the ‘ragout’, and masking the top with the remainder of it ; sprinkle over some bread-crumbs, baste with clarified butter, and keep the dish in a liot oven for twenty minutes, basting the meat frequently with its own stock. When done, drain the fat off' the dish, wipe it, and pour on the bottom a little good gravy. 448. Noix of veal, Pontoise fashion. — Pare a nice ‘noix’ of veal, without removing the udder (tétine), stud it over and underneath, with square fillets of raw lean ham, and of bacon previously seasoned. Butter the bottom of a stewpan, mask it with squares of streaky bacon, set the “noix’ thereon, fry it on a moderate fire, on all its surfaces; season with salt and pepper, and moisten with a glass of white wine, gently braising it for one hour, with hot ashes on the lid. Add then to the meat, a garnish of tender vegetables, composed of raw carrots and chives, season the vegetables slightly, and continue gently cook- ing. When the vegetables and the meat are done, dish up the ‘noix’, surround it with the vegetables, pass the stock through a sieve, skim off its fat, and pour it on the bottom of the dish. 449. Noix of veal, roasted on the spit. — Pare a ‘noix’ of veal, removing the udder (‘tétine’) ; lard it inwardly with square fillets of raw ham, of bacon, and of truffles ; season with salt and spices, sprinkle over a few trimmings of truffles, a few sprigs of thyme and bay-leaves, and wrap it up completely in some pig’s caul (crépine), which fasten with string. Fix the ‘noix’ on the spit, by the aid of an iron-skewer, and roast it at a good fire, for one hour. Then unwrap it, roast it for ten or twelve minutes longer, basting ; take it off, dish, and pour over some good tomata-sauce. 450. ‘Noix’ of veal, Polish fashion. — Pare a ‘noix’ of veal, lard with bacon, let it braise, then half-cool in its own cooking-stock. Pare it again, cut it transversally into slices; bring it back into form on a dish, alternating each of the slices with a mince of ‘cèpes’, thickened with a little sauce. Mask it likewise with a layer of mince, over which layer sprinkle some bread-crumb ; baste with a little butter, push the ‘noix’ into a moderate oven, and thus let it ‘gratinate’, basting it repeatedly. Half an hour after, slip it on a dish, but without bringing it out of shape ; . 13194 COSMOPOLITAN COOKEKL. puur into the bottom of the dish a little brown-sauce, reduced with the cooking- stock of the ‘noix’. 451. Noix of veal, béchamel-sauce. — When only calf’s meat of a secondary quality is at one’s disposal, this is a very good method of concealing its mediocrity. Pare a ‘noix’ of veal, without letting the udder adhere ; lard it inwardly, season, and place it in a stewpan, previously garnished with trimmings of ham, of bacon, and sliced vegetables ; braise it with little liquid, glazing it all over. Slice two dozen fresh mushrooms, fry them in a flat stewpan, with butter, until they have evaporated their moisture; season, add about a pint of good reduced ‘béchamel’-sauce ; let it boil a few minutes, and remove it back. When the ‘noix’ is done, drain, and cut it in thin slices. Spread the bottom of a dish with a layer of the preparation of mushrooms and ‘béchamel’; on this, dish the slices of meat, putting the‘noix’in shape, and being careful to alternate each slice with a small part of the preparation. Mask the top likewise with a layer of the preparation, and push the dish into a hot oven, to give the upper surface of the meat a nice color. When taken out of the oven, surround it with a garnish of ‘croquettes’ of potatoes, and send it up. 452. Noix of veal, ‘au gratin’. — Take a cooked and cold ‘noix’ of veal, pare it round, make a circular incision on the top, and empty it with the aid of a knife, only leaving a bottom to it ; set it then on a dish that can bear going into the oven. Cut the meat taken out, in small dice, put it into a stewpan, and mix with a third of its volume of truffles and mushrooms, both cooked and cut in dice. Thicken this ‘salpicon’, with a few spoonfuls of reduced and thickened brown-sauce, season with a pinch of pepper, and pour it into the cavity formed in the ‘noix’; mask the top with some thick sauce, sprinkle over this, as well as the meat, bread- crumbs, and baste it with hot butter. Pour a little gravy into the dish, push it into a slow oven, and warm the meat for three quarters of an hour, basting with its own stock. When ready to serve, surround the ‘noix’ with a garnish of potato-‘croquettes', and send up separately some half-glaze in a sauceboat. 453. Cromeskis of veal, ‘à la bouchère’ (D. 65). — Fry in melted fat bacon a few thick slices of minion-fillet of veal, keeping them underdone ; season with salt and pepper, let them cool ; and then cut them into small dice, put them into a kitchen-basin. Add a sweetbread, the half of a calf’s brain, and a piece of ox-tongue, all cooked and cut in dice. Prepare a mince, with four or five large white onions, proceeding as prescribed, for the kidneys ‘à la Bretonne’; when of a nice consistence, and succulent, add195 BUTCHER’S MEAT. -, VEAL. to it the ‘salpicon’; remove the stewpan back, and season with a little cayenne and nutmeg; of course, the quantity of meat must be proportionate to that of the sauce. Having thus formed a preparation, which when cooled, should not be too soft; spread it in a square shape, and half an inch thick, on a baking-sheet, and then allow it to cool. Fig. 65. Get a few slices of raw ham, cut them'very thin, and divide them in oblong- squares, two inches by one ; about thirty such will be required. When the prepa- ration is cold, divide it with a knife to the same shape and size, as the squares of ham, enclosing each piece in two pieces of ham, press slightly to fix them together, then dip these ‘cromeskis’ into a frying-paste, and plunge them into hot hog’s lard. When of a nice color, drain, and dish them in pyramids on a folded napkin, sur- rounding them with fried parsley. 454. Loin of veal, ‘à la Jardinière’ (D. 66). — Trim a loin of veal, Fig. 66. truss, and place it in a flat-pan, spread with trimmings of fat ; pour some butter over it, salt, and cover it with paper, then push it into a moderate oven to be roasted, basting it often with the fat. When done, drain it, remove the string, and range it on an oblong dish ; surround on either side with a group of green-pease, and one of trench-beans ; at one end place a garnish of glazed young carrots, and at the other a group of ‘Duchesse’-potatoes. Glaze it with the paste-brush, and send up separately a boatful of tomata-sauce. This dish is to go on the table. 13*196 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 455. Noix of veal, Geneva fashion. — Slice two onions, fry them in a stewpan with chopped hacon and five ounces of raw ham, add hereto a few trim- mings of mushrooms and truffles, a few sprigs of parsley, aromatics, and pepper- corns ; moisten with a little white wine, which reduce to a glaze. Pare a raw ‘noix' of veal, interlard it with fillets of bacon and ham; season, and mask it with the preparation, before described; wrap it up at the same time in pig's caul, place it in a stewpan, garnished on the bottom, with trimmings of bacon and vegetable ; moisten with a glass of white wine, and braise on a slow tire with hot ashes on the lid. Two hours after, surround the ‘noix’ of veal with a garnish of raw potatoes, cut round (with the aid of a vegetable-spoon), and blanched in salted water for a few minutes only; season, and continue braising gently ; the potatoes and meat should be done at the same time. When ready to serve, drain the ‘noix’, then unpack, and place it on a hot dish, to be surrounded with the potatoes. Pour a little broth into the stewpan, skim off its fat, and send it up in a sauceboat. 456. Noix of veal, Provence fashion. — Pare a raw ‘noix’ of veal, without removing the udder, interlard it with fillets of bacon and ham, place it in an earthen stewpan, with melted bacon ; fry it on a moderate fire, frequently turning; season, when of a nice color, add a garnish of small carrots and raw chives, slightly salt these vegetables ; add cloves, peppercorns, a bunch of parsley and aromatics, as well as a clove of garlic ; remove the stewpan on to a very slow fire, with hot ashes on the lid, and thus continue braising, occasionally turning the meat. One hour after, mix with the stew four or five* good tomatas, freed of seed, and cut up in large squares ; finish cooking the meat gently. When about to serve, take out the ‘noix’ with a fork, dish, surround it with the vegetables, and pour over, its, stock, freed of fat and passed through a sieve. 457. Loin of veal, roasted on the spit. — Get a loin of veal, remove some of the fat off the kidney, shorten the skirt, which roll underneath ; truss the loin, and wrap it up in white buttered paper ; then place it on the spit, and roast it for an hour and a half, frequently basting with the drippings. A quarter of an hour previous to taking it from the fire, remove the paper, allow the meat to take color, salt it afterwards ; take it off, and dish it up, sending separately a sauceboat of good gravy. When the loin is to be carved at table, one should not neglect, letting a slice of kidney accompany every slice of meat. 458. Loin of veal, with cream. — Take a braised loin of veal, remove the meat off the bone, keeping it as whole as possible, and cut it in thin slices:197 BUTCHER'S MEAT. — VEAL. which place in a sauté-pan , pour over a little good gravy, and warm them without ebullition. w Prepare a pint of ‘bechamel’-sauce, add to it a handful of trimmings of fresh mushrooms, and work it over the tire, for a quarter of an hour ; pass it then through a sieve; reduce it, stirring, and gradually introducing into it the gravy, in which the meat has been warmed ; when the sauce is of a nice consistence, take it off the fire. Mask the bottom of a gratin-dish with a layer of the prepared sauce, on which range symmetrically the slices of meat, one by one, alternating each of them with a little sauce, and masking their top likewise with the same sauce ; sprinkle over some bread-crumbs, and push the dish into a hot oven, thus giving a nice color to its surface. When the dish is taken out of the oven, drain the fat away, and pour on the bottom a little1 good gravy. 459. Saddle of veal, roasted, German fashion. — Procure a small saddle of veal, trim the skirts neatly, remove the kidneys and tin' skin off the loins, and lard them with bacon in the usual way. Spread a flat-pan with the fat from the kidneys, set the saddle on it, cover it with a buttered paper, pour a glass of water into the pan, which push into a moderate oven. Baste the saddle front time to time, let it roast for one hour, or an hour and a quarter, according to its size ; salt it. and allow its top to take color, then dish it up. the two kidneys (cooked separately) set on each end ; drain the fat off the flat-pan. mix a little broth and white wine into the cooking-stock, which let boil, then skim off the fat. and thicken it with a little diluted potato-flour. Two minutes after, pour the sauce into a tureen, and send up separately a garnish of cauliflowers, basted with a bread-crumb-sauce. 460. ‘Fricandeau’ of veal, with sorrel. — The ‘fricandeau' is one of the national dishes of France, prepared as well in the provinces, as in the capital: as well in private families , as at ‘restaurants'. If the meat is of good quality , and the ‘fricandeau’ is eaten as soon as done, it is a dish not without merit. Take a piece of false ‘noix' of veal ; pare away the sinewy skins surrounding it, wet it slightly, and beat it with a cutlet-bat, to flatten it, and bruise the fibres of the meat ; stud it then closely. Spread the bottom of a flat stewpan with sliced vege- tables, set the ‘fricandeau’ thereon, with the larded part uppermost; salt it slightly, moisten, up to the larding, with broth and a little wine; cover it with a buttered paper, and set the stewpan on the fire, starting the stock to ebullition, and reducing it to half. Then remove the pan on a moderate fire, put some hot ashes on its lid, and braise the ‘fricandeau’ for an hour and a half, basting frequently with its own stock. When done, glaze it nicely, and drain it ; dilute the cooking-stock with a little broth or gravy, let it boil, strain it, skim off its fat. and reduce it to half-glaze.198 COSMOPOLITAN COOKEKY. On the other hand, prepare a purée of sorrel, and finish it with a part of the reduced stock. Dish up the ‘fricandeau’, haste it with the remainder of the stock, and send up separately the sorrel on another dish, this method being preferable to serving it on one dish with the ‘fricandeau’. 461. Schwalbach ‘paupiettes’. — Put into a kitchen-basin six table- spoonfuls of flour, dilute with six whole eggs, and three gills of milk; add to it a little salt, a pinch of pounded mace; then pass the preparation through a sieve. With this preparation, and some clarified butter, prepare a few omelets in a large frying-pan, keeping them as thin and broad as possible; immediately when done, turn them out on a baking-sheet, cut them square, and allow them to cool. On the other hand, pound the meat of a cooked minion-fillet of veal, add to it half a pound of ham, and five or six chickens’ livers, fried in butter; season, then introduce into the preparation a -whole egg, and one yolk; pass it through a sieve, spread a layer of it on the omelets, which divide into strips, four inches by one, roll them up in the shape of ‘paupiettes’, which arrange in a buttered sauté-pan, one beside the other. Baste with butter, sprinkle over bread-crumb, and bake them in a moderate oven for a quarter of an hour. Afterwards take them out, and dish them up. 462. Veal scollops, Italian way. — Cut a piece of ‘noix’ of veal, into slices the third of an inch thick, pare them round to the size of a half-crown-piece, beat them with the handle of a knife, to enlarge them. Diminish their thickness; season with salt and pepper, flour slightly, range them in a flat stewpan with butter; set the stewpan on a brisk fire, and fry the scollops on both sides. When done, moisten with a few spoonfuls of madeira, which reduce ; take up the scollops with a fork, and dish them up in a border of rice. Pour into the stewpan a gill and a half of tomata-sauce, let it boil, stirring it with a spoon, and pour it over the scollops. 463. Small timbales (D. 67). — Fine short-paste. — Sift a pound of flour on the table, form a hollow in its centre, into which put a little salt and a yolk of egg; add three parts of a glass of cold water, and ten ounces of butter, previously pressed in a cloth, and in small bits; at the same time introduce into it the liquid, the butter and flour, thus making a smooth and firm paste; work it two or three times with the palm of the hands, to render it smooth ; form (mouler) it to a ball, and let it rest for ten minutes, before using it. Line a dozen ‘dariole’-moulds with the short-paste. Cut up into squares, a raw minion-fillet of veal, pound it, and add to it five or six good chickens’ livers, fried with four ounces of rasped fat-bacon ; season with good spices, add to the pre- paration three tablespoonfuls of reduced sauce, pass it through a sieve, and intro-199 BUTCHER’S MEAT. — VEAL. duce into it five ounces of cooked ham in small dice. With this preparation, fill the small ‘timbales’, to bake them in a moderate oven for twenty-five minutes. When taken out of the oven, cut the preparation to the level of the moulds, remove the Fig. 67. ‘timbales’ from these, pour in a little reduced sauce, cover them with a lid of puff- paste, formed of two channeled rounds of paste, the one being smaller than the other, dish them on a folded napkin, and serve them.- 464. Calf’s head, ‘à la Financière’ (D. 68). — Blanch a nice boned calf’s head ; when refreshed and singed, cut its ears round, and divide the remainder Fig. 68. of the head into pieces of equal size ; place the ears upright in a stewpan, with the pieces of the head surrounding them, moisten with a sufficient quantity of very fat and white broth, and some wine; cover with a buttered paper, and boil them on a slow fire. Boil separately two nice calves’ brains. On the other hand, cut a fluted bread-‘croustade’ of an oval form, make a circular incision on its top, and fry it to a nice color ; empty it afterwards, and mask it on the top, with a layer of raw force-meat ; fix it, (by the aid of small skewers) on a stand of fried bread, stuck on the centre of an oblong dish, and keep it at the entrance of the oven. When time to serve, drain the ears, and other pieces of calfs200 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. head; pare away the fat, only preserving the skinny parts, which cut with a plain round cutter. Pare the ears, hollow them with a cutter, score the auricle, then place them upright at each end of the dish, on a layer of poached force-meat. Drain the brains, dish them on each side of the ‘croustade’ occupying the centre of the dish; garnish the hollow, between the ears and brains, on one side with a group of small ‘quenelles’, moulded with the spoon, and on the other with a group of button-mushrooms. Fill the cavity of the ‘croustade’ with ‘quenelles’ and mushrooms ; range round the pieces of head in a close circle, and garnish the centre with truffles and cocks’- combs. Mask slightly the garnishes, and the bottom of the dish, with a little madeira-sauce ; the remainder of which pour into a sauceboat. Insert on the top of the ‘croustade’, on each side, a ‘hâtelet’-skewer, garnished with truffles of different sizes. 465. ‘Schnitzel’, Vienna fashion. — Take two good minion-fillets of veal ; trim away the sinewy skin, and cut them up slantwise, into slices the third of an inch thick ; which beat with the handle of the knife. Beat them afterwards slightly with the back of a knife ; round them, season with salt and pepper, flour, dip them into beaten eggs, and bread-crumbs; fry them in a frying-pan, with clarified butter, and dish them up in a circular order. Pour into the frying-pan a little good gravy, which reduce for a few minutes ; add to it, the juice of one lemon, and pour it over the ‘schnitzel’, passing the same through a sieve. 466. Steak (tranche) of veal, ‘à la Bourgeoise’. — Cut a good, thick slice off the thick end of a leg of veal, remove the centre-bone, season it on both sides, and truss it. Melt in a stewpan five ounces of lard or butter ; add to it a piece of streaky bacon in dice, and the veal ; fry these meats on a moderate fire, often turning them ; add three dozen raw chives, and half a pound of ham in oblong squares ; cover the stewpan, and remove it back. At the last moment, lay the slice of veal on a dish, surround it with the ham and onions ; pour a gill of broth into the stewpan, let it boil up, then pass it, through a sieve, over the slice of veal. 467. ‘Paupiettes’ of veal, glazed (D. 69). — Get six minion-fillets of veal, cut them of an equal length, trim away the sinewy skin ; divide each of the fillets lengthwise into two strips, half an inch thick ; which moisten slightly, beat them with a cutlet-bat, diminishing their thickness, and giving two inches width ; pare, square, and season them. Chop the trimmings, pound, and mix them up with a third of their volume of panada, a piece of butter, and a yolk of egg; season this preparation, and when smooth, pass it through a sieve; place it then in a kitchen-basin, and introduce into201 BUTCHER S MEAT. — VEAL. it a few tablespoonfuls of chopped truffles. Then spread, over each strip of meat, a layer of the preparation, roll them together, truss them with strong thread, and arrange the ‘paupiettes’ one beside the other, on the bottom of a flat stewpan, strewn with bacon and sliced vegetables. Moisten, tip to their height, with good broth, and a little wine ; then add a bunch of parsley and aromatics. Set then the stewpan on a moderate fire, with hot ashes on its lid, and turn the ‘paupiettes’ from time to time, Fig. (!!). Fig. 70. and divide it into round pieces, leaving the ears whole, the inside of which till with a carrot, wrap them up in bacon, tie, and boil them, as well as the other parts, in a white stock (fonds blanc). On the other hand, strew an oblong dish with fried bread- ‘croûtons’, turn out on its centre a little stand of force-meat, poached in an oblong mould, or simply a stand of cooked rice. When ready to serve, drain the two ears basting frequently. When done, drain them, remove the thread, pare them neatly, and dish them in pyramids. Dilute the cooking-stock with a little broth, and madeira ; let it boil, strain, and thicken it with a little brown-sauce, adding a few raw truffles ; reduce the sauce for five or six minutes longer; glaze the ‘paupiettes’ with the paste-brush, and pour on the bottom of the dish some of the sauce, sending up the remainder in a sauce-boat. 468. Calf s head, ‘à la Royale’ (D. 70). — Bone a calf’s head ; blanch,202 ce )SMOPO LIT AN COQ K E R Y. score them, and put into their hollow a large button-mushroom ; place them, one beside the other, on the stand of force-meat. Set the round pieces of the head, all round in a circle and ‘à cheval’ ; mask them with a Velouté’-sauce, reduced with liquor of mushrooms ; and surround them with a garnish, composed of cocks’-combs, mushrooms and truffles.. Send up separately a boatful of the same sauce. This dish may be served as a remove, and placed on the table. After having figured on the table, it is convenient to divide the pieces, lest they be too bulky. 469. Calf’s head, with vinaigrette. — Take half of a calf’s head, bone, scald, singe, and divide it in proportionate pieces, which put into a stewpan. Dilute a tablespoonful of flour with a sufficient quantity of water to cover the head with ; pour it on the head, add salt, cloves, peppercorns, aromatics, and the pulp of a lemon without peel or pips. Let the water boil up, then boil the meat gently on the side of the stove-fire. When ready to serve, drain the pieces, score the exterior of the ears, dish the pieces, surrounding them with parsley-leaves and hard-boiled eggs cut in halves. Send up separately a sauce-boat of Vinaigrette’, and some raw chopped fine-herbs, placed by groups on a small dish, or in scollop-shells; these fine-herbs being com- posed of chopped parsley, onion, gerkin, and whole capers. 470. Calf’s head, with mince-sauce. — Bone the half of a calf’s head ; scald, drain, refresh, and divide it in pieces, leaving the ears whole; then boil it as directed in No. 469. When ready to serve, drain the pieces with a skimmer, dry them on a cloth, score the auricle, dish and mask them with the following sauce : Mince-sauce. — Mince a large onion and a few shalbts, put them into a stewpan with butter; fry them slightly; add six ounces of raw ham, cut up in very small dice, and double that quantity of fresh mushrooms, also minced. When these have evaporated their moisture, moisten with half a gill of vinegar, which reduce to half ; moisten anew with a pint and a half of brown-sauce ; at the first bubbling, take it on the side of the fire. Ten minutes after, skim the fat off the sauce, add to it a little cayenne, two tablespoonfuls of chopped capers, and as much of chopped gerkins ; finish it with a pinch of chopped parsley. 471. RUSS Punshki. — Chop and fry one onion, add to it the meat of a sliced minion-fillet of veal, fry, season, take it off the fire to cool ; then chop it, and add two or three chopped hard-boiled eggs, and a pinch of parsley ; thicken the pre- paration with a little reduced sauce. Roll out thin a pound and a quarter of ‘coulibiac’-paste, cut out of the flat thirty- six rounds with a plain cutter (an inch and a half in diameter); moisten them slightly,BUTCHER’S MEAT. VEAL 203 and garnish half of them with a small part of the preparation ; and with the remainder of the paste cover the garnished flats. Press the patties all round, and cut them anew with the same cutter, placing them even on a floured napkin, thus letting the paste rise by the temperature of the kitchen. A few minutes previous to serving them, plunge them into hot hog’s lard, to fry them to a nice color ; drain, and dish them up, on a folded napkin. 472. Paupiettes (brasciolé), Milan-fashion. — Chop six ounces of lean veal-meat, with a piece of beef-kidney-suet, and a piece of ham, or of streaky bacon : the whole being chopped fine, add to it a point of garlic, a few sprigs of aromatics; a sprig of mint or sage, salt, pepper, and nutmeg ; the mixture made, thicken the preparation with a whole egg. Cut up a dozen scollops off a loin or white ‘noix’ of veal, pare away the sinew, beat them to the size of a half-crown-piece ; spread them on the table, season, and set on each, a small part of the preparation. Then immediately fold over the edges of the ‘brasciolé’; which roll around them, into a long shape, then run them through (broadwise) with a small skewer, alternated by a very thin slice of ham. Flour them slightly, and roast them in a flat stewpan with clarified butter ; when done, and of a nice gold color, dish them up with the butter, in which they have been roasted, surrounding them with lemons in quarters. 473. ‘Terrine’ of veal. — Choose a nice white‘noix’of veal; trim, lard it with fillets of ham and raw truffles ; season with salt and spices. Prepare a force-meat with trimmings of veal and lean fresh pork ; these meats being well mixed up, add an equal quantity of chopped fresh bacon and the trimmings of truffles; put this into the mortar, season, pound, pass it through a sieve, place the whole in a kitchen-basin, and introduce into it a few tablespoonfuls of madeira or cognac. Line a pie-‘terrine’ with thin layers of bacon, mask the bottom of it with a layer of the prepared force-meat, on which layer set the ‘noix’ ; also surround, and cover it with force-meat, which on the top, shape in a dome-like fashion. Place the ‘terrine’ in a flatpan (plafond), and push it into a moderate oven, basting often. One hour after, pour a little warm water in the flatpan, and bake the pie, an hour and a half longer; take it then out of the oven, and half an hour later, set a light weight on it, thus letting it cool under press. When the ‘terrine’ is to be sent up, remove the fat off the top, take the meat out, cut it in slices, and put it back into the ‘terrine’, which set on a dish : surround it with aspic-jelly. 474. Neck of veal, roasted on the spit. — Choose a good neck of veal, shorten the rib-bones, and pare them square; take away the skin of the meat,204 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. which lard with bacon lengthwise. Afterwards put it on the spit, by the aid of two iron-skewers ; baste with clarified butter, and roast it at a good lire, for three quarters of an hour; salt it. take it out on a dish, pouring under it the stock in the dripping-pan, strained, skimmed of fat, and mixed up with a little gravy. 475. Leg of veal, German fashion. — Pare a leg of veal, put it into a roasting-pan, pour over some clarified butter; salt, cover it with paper, and let it roast in a moderate oven for an hour and a half, turning it ; when three-parts done, baste it with two or three gills of good sour-cream, and continue roasting, basting often. Dish it afterwards, add a little good gravy to the cooking-stock, which let boil, and pass, through a sieve, over the leg of veal. 476. Leg of veal, roasted in the oven. — Spread the bottom of a roasting-pan with trimmings of bacon and lard, or merely with butter ; place there- on a trimmed leg of veal ; grease, and cover it with paper ; pour about a half-pint of warm water into the pan, which push into a moderate oven, and roast the leg for two hours, frequently basting and turning; salt it towards the end of its cooking, and when of a nice color, dish it, pouring over it. its stock, freed of fat. 477. Veal, dressed like thunny. — This dish is derived from the old school, and once enjoyed great favor, now-a-days however. it seems neglected; hut yet it is sometimes served in Italy. It was at Venice, that I ate of it for the first time. Pare a piece of veal, ‘noix’ or under ‘noix’, interlard it throughout with fillets of anchovies, and steep it for two hours in plenty of water; change the water, set the stewpan on the fire, to bring the liquid to ebullition; drain the meat, wipe it on a cloth, and place it in a kitchen-basin ; season with salt and pepper, baste with oil and lemon-juice, add a bay-leaf and a few sprigs of rosemary, and let it remain thus, for two or three days in winter, but in summer only for twenty-four hours. Broil it afterwards, basting and turning it; when done, put it back into the earthen-pan, baste with a little oil and lemon-juice, and twelve hours later, cut up the meat in thick slices; dish, surround it with hard-boiled eggs, gerkins, capers, chopped parsley and onion, then pour its marinade over, and serve. 478. Timbale, snail-like-fashion (D. 71). — Butter the inside of a dome- mould. Take a pound and a quarter of fine short paste, divide it into several parts, which roll into strings, the size of a macaroni ; place them against the sides of the mould, beginning at the centre, then spread over the paste a thin layer of fresh pork mince, mixed up with a chopped truffle. Cut into scollops, two or three scalded sweet- breads, cooled under weight. Fry, in melted fat-bacon, a few spoonfuls of fine- herbs ; onions, shalot, mushrooms; when their moisture is evaporated, add six ounces20Ô BUTCHER’S MEAT. — VEAL. of raw ham, iu small dice, and the scollops of sweetbreads, toss them over a brisk fire for a few minutes, and season. When the sweetbreads are well set, pour over three tablespoonfuls of madeira ; after a few seconds, take them off the fire, and sprinkle over some chopped parsley. The 'ragout’ being about cold, arrange it by layers in the ‘timbale’, alternated with some calf’s brains, blanched, and cut up like the sweetbreads. Cover the ‘tim- Fig. 71. bale’ with a flat of paste, which solder carefully ; place the mould on a layer of ashes, put it on a baking-sheet and bake it in a moderate oven for one hour. When done, take it from the tire, make a small hole in the cover, through which pour into the ‘timbale’ a few spoonfuls of brown-sauce, reduced, but not too thick ; turn it out on its dish, and set a button-mushroom on the top. 479. Roast leg (quartier) of veal, English fashion (D. 72). — Fig. 72. The English spit, the drawing of which is given here, is so practical and ingenious a contrivance, that one is astonished not to find it handy in every kitchen. The possibility of roasting a large piece of meat on the spit, without being obliged to pierce it with a spit, is an advantage so conspicuous, that no one can fail to appre- ciate it. In regard to facility and safety, the English spit is superior to any other : let a piece of butcher’s meat be as large as it may, it can always be held in right balance, be roasted and colored to an equal shade. The drawing has been introduced,206 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. in order most clearly to show its utility and perfection: it is to be hoped, that this example may persuade, as well amphitryons, as practitioners. Choose a leg (quartier) of fine white veal ; pare it, saw off the bone below the joint of the leg, shorten the bone of the jump-loin (quasi), wrap the leg up in paper, place it in just balance on the lower supports of the spit, and draw on the screw on both sides, in order to keep it firm. Wrap it up in buttered paper, let it turn before a good fire ; an hour afterwards, unwrap it, finish roasting, basting it repeatedly with the drippings. When done, dish it, pare the bone, and put a ruffle to it. Serve separately a sauceboatful of good grayy, and a dish of fresh vegetables, boiled in salted water, or in steam. 480. Calves’ ears, ‘à la marinade’. — Boil three or four, calves’ ears (sec. No. 496); let them nearly cool in their liquor ; drain, and dry them on a cloth, divide each of them into four parts; which put into a kitchen-basin, season with salt, pepper, chopped parsley, and moisten with the juice of one lemon. When cold, dip them, one by one, into a frying-paste; drain, and plunge them into plenty of hot hog’s lard, frying them gently; when of a fine color, drain, salt, dish them on a folded napkin, surrounding them with fried parsley. 481. Calves’ ears, Bordeaux fashion. —-Take four boiled calves''ears, (see No. 496) : let them cool in their liquor, drain, and wipe them on a cloth. Chop four or five firm ‘cèpes’, put them into a stewpan with a piece of butter or some oil ; fry them, tossing them a while over the fire; when their moisture is evapo- rated, season, and draw them off the fire : then add a handful of rasped bread-crumbs, a few tablespoonfuls of raw, chopped ham, two tablespoonfuls of chopped shalot, and a pinch of parsley. Season highly the fine-herbs, thicken them with an egg; and stuff with them the hollow of the ears, the rim of which score, and set them upright in a fiat stewpan, with two dozen small heads of‘cèpes’, previously fried. Moisten the ears, to half their height, with thickened gravy, mixed up with tomata-sauce, and finished with a little cayenne. Let the sauce boil up, keep the stewpan at the entrance of the oven for twenty minutes, basting the ears frequently, then dish them up, surround them with the ‘cèpes’, and pour the sauce over. 482. Calves’ ears, Villeroy-sauce. — Boil four calves’ ears, proceeding as directed for the calf’s head, see No. 496 ; let them nearly cool in their stock, drain them afterwards, wipe them, divide them in two lengthwise ; season, and add two or three spoonfuls of cooked fine-herbs. The pieces being cold, dip them, one by one, into some Villeroy-sauce, and set them evenly on a dish, at a little distance from one another; let the sauce cool, then detach them with the blade of a knife, roll them in bread-crumbs, dip them into beaten eggs, and bread-crumb them a second time.BUTCHER’S MEAT. — VEAL. 207 When time to serve, plunge them into hot hog’s lard, by small quantities at a time, fry them nicely; then drain, and dish them on a folded napkin, with fried parsley round. 483. Fried calves’ ears, tomata-sauce. — Take four calves’ ears, half i cooled in their stock ; drain, wipe, and divide each of them in four parts ; which place in a kitchen-basin, season with salt, pepper, and chopped parsley ; Hour the pieces ! one by one, dip them into beaten eggs, and bread-crumb. Ten minutes previous to serving, plunge them into plenty of hot hog’s lard, in i small quantities at a time; when of a nice color, drain, and dish them in pyramids; pour on the bottom of the dish a little well-seasoned tomata-sauce. 484. Calves’ brains, With sorrel. — Get three calves’brains, very fresh; as nothing is more disagreeable and unwholesome, than a brain deficient in this respect. Trim away the outer skin, cover them, and steep them in water for two hours, changing the water several times. Boil two quarts of water with a handful of salt, a bunch of parsley garnished with thyme and bay-leaf, half a glass of white vinegar, a sliced onion, a piece of celery-root, peppercorns, and cloves Five minutes after, put the brains in, and boil them for twelve minutes. When ready to serve, drain them carefully with a skimmer, butter them slightly all over with a paste-brush, and dish them, in a triangular way, on a garnish of sorrel, taking care to place the roots towards the centre of the dish. 485. Calves’ brains, ‘à la matelote’. — Trim three very fresh calves’ brains, put them into boiling water, take them out two minutes after; wipe them on a cloth, and divide each into two parts. Mince one carrot and two onions, add ten ounces of blanched streaky bacon in small squares, a few sprigs of aromatics, two pimentoes, a few cloves, and a handful of trimmings of mushrooms; moisten the whole, with two glasses of red wine, cover the stewpan, and reduce the liquid one fourth ; then add thereto the brains ; boil them for seven or eight minutes ; pass the liquid, through a sieve, into another stewpan ; skim off the fat, reduce it to half-glaze, and thicken it with a little brown- sauce. Add to the sauce a dozen raw middling-sized mushrooms, boil it covered for a few minutes, mix with it the brains, the bacon, two dozen small glazed onions, and the same of blanched olives ; simmer the Tagout’ for a few minutes. Dish the brains on fried bread-Troûtons’, and surround with the garnishes. 486. Calves’ brains, with hot ravigote-sauce. — Boil three calves’ brains, proceeding, as in No. 484 ; drain them on a cloth, dish them, and mask them with the following sauce :208 COSM<H'OLITAN CC)( )KER Y. Hot ravigote-sauce. — Pour into a stewpan a gill of white vinegar, add toit a sprig of taragon, a few shalôts, cloves, and peppercorns; reduce the liquid to half, then add a few spoonfuls of ‘velouté’-sauce, rather thick; boil it for a few minutes ; strain, and keep it hot. Chop tine a pinch of parsley-leaves, one of taragon, one of burnet (pimprendle), and one of chervil ; tie them up in tire corner of a cloth, and dip them in boiling water; then press the moisture out of the fine-herbs, mix them in the sauce, and add (off the fire) three or four tablespoonfuls of good Provence oil. 487. Calves’brains, in shells. — Put into a kitchen-basin two boiled calves’ brains, cut in dice, and season them well. Pour into a stewpan a few spoon- fuls of ‘béchamel’- sauce, which reduce gradually, introducing into it a few spoonfuls of melted glaze ; when succulent and creamy , add to it four tablespoonfuls of cooked fine-herbs. Two minutes after, add the ‘salpieon’ of brains, and remove the stewpan from the fire. With this preparation fill seven or eight scollop-shells, sprinkle over them grated parmesan, glaze with a red-hot salamander, and serve them. 488. Cromeskis of calves’ brains. — Pour into a stewpan about half a pint of strained brown-sauce, reduce it for a few minutes, gradually introducing into it four tablespoonfuls of melted glaze and a little madeira ; when reduced and rather thick, remove it back, to be mixed with two cooked calves’ brains, cut in small dice ; add half their volume of cooked mushrooms, and the same of red tongue, like- wise in dice ; season the preparation with a little nutmeg, and pour it into a kitchen- basin. When cold, divide it into equal parts, which roll into a corlc-shape; flatten them a little, and wrap one after another into a strip of wafer, softened between two damp cloths. Then take the cromeskis one by one, to dip them into a frying- paste ; put them into hot hog’s lard, taking buta small quantity at a time; when the paste is dried, and nicely colored ; drain, and dish them, on a folded napkin, with fried parsley on the top. 489. Calves’ brains, with nut-brown butter. — Boil three brains, proceeding as in No. 484 ; drain them, spunge them on a cloth, and dish them up in a triangular form ; baste with the following butter : Broivn butter (beurre-noir). — Melt half a pound of butter in a stewpan, decant it into a frying-pan, add to it a bay-leaf, and boil it, until it begins to blacken ; then take it off the fire, and mix with it a few spoonfuls of good vinegar ; set it on the fire again, season with salt and pepper, let it boil for two or three minutes, remove it back ; throw in a pinch of chopped parsley, and a handful of whole capers; pour the sauce over the brains.BUTCHER’S MEAT. - VEAL. 209 490. ‘Brochettes’ of calves’ brains. — Boil two or three calves’ brains ; when cold, cut them in two, divide each of these pieces in flat squares, the third of an inch thick ; which place evenly in a kitchen-basin ; season with salt and spices. Sprinkle over a pinch of cooked fine-herbs and chopped parsley, roll them in this seasoning. This done, run the squares through with small metal skewers (brochettes), alternating each piece with ja thin square of boiled udder, or fat-bacon of, the same size ; dip the skewers into melted butter, sprinkle over some rasped bread-crumbs, and broil them on both sides on a moderate fire, for about twelve minutes ; dish them up afterwards in pyramids. 491. Subric, Italian fashion. — Take the loose skin off two calves’brains, and steep them in water for half an hour ; dry them well, and afterwards cut them in small dice; season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg; sprinkle over a little grated parmesan, and add a beaten egg; the preparation ought to be but little thickened. Pour some clarified butter into a flat stewpan : when hot, take the preparation up with a tablespoon in small portions, which drop into the butter from time to time. 1 Fry the ‘subrics’, turning them with a fork; afterwards dish them up, and surround i with cut lemons. 492. Shoulder of veal, in galantine. — Bone a shoulder of veal, cleaving it from the blade {palette) to the knuckle {manche) ; cut off the inside meat, diminishing the flesh on all the inner surface, and leaving it thin on the skin ; season the meat with salt and spices. Break up the bones, put them into a stock-pot with two calves’ feet, partly boned, and previously blanched ; moisten with water, and boil the stock on a moderate fire; as soon as the feet are done, drain them, finish carefully, boning them completely ; chop, and put them into a kitchen-basin, season them with salt and spices. Remove the sinews off the shoulder-meat, chop it fine, add to it the chopped calves’ feet, and a few minutes after, add to the mince, the same quantity of fresh fat- bacon, previously chopped, chopping the whole together, until the mixture be entirely done. Season the force-meat highly with salt and spices, then add to it a third its volume of cooked ham and bacon, cut in large dice. Stuff the shoulder with this, truss it to an oblong form, wrap up the ‘galantine’ in a napkin ; which fasten with string, and place it in a braising-pan ; moisten to its height, with the broth from the calves’ feet, and toppings of broth; set the braising-pan on the fire, and at the first bubbling, remove it back, boiling the ‘galantine’ for two hours and a half. When taken out of the stock, unpack it once more, to pack it still tighter up into the same napkin ; secure it as before with string, and place it under press. Then clarify the stock, proceeding as for aspic-jelly. itCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 210 When ready to serve, glaze the ‘galantine’, dish it up, and surround it with the aspic-jelly, either cut in ‘croûtons’ or chopped. 493. Stewed shoulder of veal, with vegetables. — Cut up a shoulder of veal in middling-sized squares, removing the bones as much as possible. Put into a stewpan four tablespoonfuls of good clarified broth-toppings, or some lard ; warm it, add the meat, and try it on a good fire, until nicely colored ; then sprinkle over a handful of flour, and two minutes after, drain the fat off the stewpan. Moisten the meat, by degrees, with the hot broth, stir the ‘ragout’ on the fire until boiling, then remove the pan back, and put in a little salt, a pinch of pepper, and a bunch of parsley, and aromatics. If the sauce be too pale, color it with a few drops of ‘caramel’ ; it should be, however, of but little thickness : cover the stewpan. Three quarters of an hour after, add to the meat a garnish of small raw or blanched carrots, according to their tenderness, a few raw .mushrooms, and three dozen small onions, previously fried in some fat ; season the vegetables, cover the stewpan, and continue boiling, until the vegetables and meat be done ; then dish up the ‘ragout’, carefully removing the aromatics. 494. Coulibiac, Moldavian fashion. — Slice a veal-kidney, put it into a kitchen-basin ; season, and mix with it four tablespoonfuls of cooked fine-herbs. Boil two calves’ brains, divide them in two ; which pieces cut into slices, and season them with salt and pepper, sprinkling them likewise with fine-herbs. Roll out, on a floured napkin, a flat of‘coulibiac’-paste in an oblong shape; on its centre set a layer of rice, boiled in the conditions prescribed in No. 215: mask this rice with a layer of chopped hard-boiled eggs, mixed up with parsley ; cover the eggs with the brains and kidney, and these with rice; then fold the edges of the paste over the preparation, thus enclosing this entirely, and turn the pie out on a baking-sheet, by the aid of the napkin : keep it for twenty minutes at the tempera- ture of the kitchen ; moisten the paste with melted butter, sprinkle it with bread- crumbs, and bake the pie in a moderate oven for one hour. Dish it up afterwards, and send in separately some madeira-sauce. 495. Aspic, Normandy fashion (D. 73). — With half a white calf’s liver, get ready a preparation for ‘pain’ of poultry-liver; poach it in a‘charlotte’- mould, let it cool ; then trim, and cut it in slices; which stamp with a plain round cutter. Mask these rounds with a brown ‘chaufroix’-sauce, set them evenly on a baking-sheet, letting the sauce cool ; and cut an equal quantity (of the same form) of rounds of ox-tongue. Take two or three scalded and cooled sweetbreads, divide them in slices, whichBUTCHER’S MEAT. — VEAL. 211 fry very white ; let them cool under press, to stamp them round, as the ‘pain’ of liver, then mask them with a white ‘chaufroix’- sauce, and range them on a baking-sheet, to let the sauce cool. Choose some nice button-mushrooms, cut them transversally in slices, which mask with the white ‘chaufroix’-sauce, and range beside the sweetbreads. Fig. 73. Place a cylindric mould in an earthen vessel, surround it with pounded ice, and settle at the bottom a thin layer of aspic-jelly ; over which form a circle with alter- nated rounds of tongue and of liver. Cover it, by degrees, with aspic ; and this being firm, place over it a circle of rounds of sweetbread ; pour over it some aspic, and begin again another circle, of ox-tongue and ‘pain’ of liver alternated. Then fill the mould with aspic. Half an hour after, dip it into warm water, wipe it, and turn the aspic out on a cold dish. Garnish the top with a circle of rounds of mushrooms, and fill the hollow with a salad of vegetables, thickened with mayonnaise-sauce. I 490. Hot-pie (‘pâté-chaud’) à la financière (D. 74 and 75). Fig. 74. Fig. 75. Line a pie-mould previously buttered, with short-paste; mask the bottom with a layer of raw chicken force-meat with fine-herbs. Fill the cavity with cold scollops 14*212 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. of calves’ or lambs’ sweetbreads, fried with fine-herbs; mask the meats with another thin layer of raw force-meat, and cover the pie with a flat of paste. Pinch the crest round ; egg, land bake the pie in a moderate oven, for an hour and a quarter, Avith a sheet of paper on its top. On the other hand, mould with the spoon fifteen veal-‘quenelles’, and poach them in salted water. Lard a large lamb’s sweetbread; braise, and glaze it. Prepare a ‘ragout’ composed of pullets’ livers, cocks’-combs, button-mushrooms, and truffles. When ready to serve, take the hot-pie out of the oven, remove its cover, and the force-meat off the top, carefully wipe the fat away, and slip it on a dish. Pour over the meats a little good brown-sauce reduced with madeira, then dish the ‘quenelles’ in a circular order on the rim, range the Tagout’ on the centre, placing the sweet- bread on the top ; send up separately a boatful of madeira-sauce. 497. Calves’tongues, like turtle. — Boil for an hour, in salted water, four or five calves’ tongues; drain them, scrape their skin off, trim, and round them at their thick end ; place them flat in a stewpan, spread with sliced vegetables, and nice slices of blanched streaky bacon, half an inch thick ; salt slightly, moisten up to half their height, with broth and white wine; then add cloves, peppercorns, and a bunch of parsley, and aromatics. Cover the stewpan, set it on a brisk fire, in order to reduce the stock to about a glaze; moisten the tongues again, to their height, with good broth, and finish cooking them on a moderate fire. On the other hand, cut up, in middling-sized squares, a cooked calf’s brain; put these into a stewpan, with two dozen cooked mushrooms, the same of small ‘quenelles’, moulded with a spoon, and poached; and keep these garnishes in the ‘bain-marie’. The tongues being done, take them up, as well as the bacon; glaze with a paste-brush, and keep them hot. Dilute the cooking-stock with a little broth and madeira; let it boil, strain, skim off the fat, and add to it half its volume of thickened tomata-sauce ; keep this sauce boiling for a few minutes, reducing it to the required thickness ; then add to it a pinch of cayenne, and the tongues cut lengthwise in two ; let them simmer for a quarter of an hour, and dish them in a circular order ; fill the centre with the garnishes, and the bacon cut up in squares ; add a few sliced gerkins, and pour the sauce over. 498. Sweet-breads, Paris fashion (D. 76). — Choose four nice sweet- breads ; scald, drain, and refresh them in cold water ; then trim, and dry them on a cloth. Lard two of them with bacon, stud the other two writh fillets of raw truffles, pointed on one end, place them in a stewpan garnished with bacon and vegetable; salt slightly, and moisten to three-quarters their height with good broth ; then cover them with a buttered paper, reduce their stock one third, and finish cooking withBUTCHER’S MEAT. — VEAL. 213 : hot ashes on the lid. Besides this, adorn a Hat border-mould with truffles, fill it with veal force-meat, which poach in the ‘bain-marie’. When ready to serve, turn the border out on a dish, on the centre of which lay a support of fried bread, masked with force-meat, fill the hollow with truffles and sliced mushrooms ; range the sweetbreads on the border, applying them against the Fig. 7(i. support ; the four sweetbreads being nicely glazed, garnish the hollow, between each of them, Avith button-mushrooms and truffles, insert on the top of the support a ‘hâtelet’-skewer, garnished with a cock’s-comb and a truffle ; mask slightly the bot- tom of the dish Avith some brown-sauce, reduced with a little Avine, the trimmings of truffles, and of fresh mushrooms ; send up separately a boatful of this sauce. 499. Veal-cutlets braised, Perigueux fashion (D. 77). — Cut up Fig. 77. some veal-cutlets, double the usual thickness; trim them, keeping the bones short, then lard them through with square fillets of raw truffles. Spread a flat stewpan Avith sliced vegetables, place the cutlets thereon, one heside the other; moisten up to the half with broth; add a bunch of parsley withCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 214 aromatics, and set the stewpan on the fire, reducing the stock to half ; then cover the cutlets with buttered paper, draw them on the side of the fire, and finish cooking them short of moisture, adding from time to time a little broth. As soon as the cutlets are done, drain, and dish them on a ring of force-meat, poached on a dish ; on the centre of which fix a small bread-‘croustade’ nicely fried, and fill it with small truffles. Pour on the bottom of the dish, some of the cooking-stock of the cutlets, strained, freed of fat, reduced with the trimmings of truffles, and thickened with a little brown-sauce ; send up the remainder in a sauceboat. 50.0. Calves’ tongues, cold, ‘à la macédoine’. — Boil in water five or six small pickled calves’ tongues ; when taken out of their liquor, let them cool between two dishes, remove the skin, and round them on the thick end, cut them straight on each side, and split them in two lengthwise ; then glaze them completely with a paste-brush, and lay on a thin layer of half-set aspic-jelly, to give a relief. On the other hand, prepare a ‘macédoine’ of vegetables, composed of Brusscls- sprouts, cauliflowers in flowrets, carrots and potatoes in balls; french-beans in lozenges, spruce-asparagus, and green-pease; all these vegetables must be blanched separately, seasoned as a salad, and dished symmetrically in pyramids. Then set all round the halves of tongue upright, their pointed end uppermost; surround with aspic-jelly, and send up separately some cold ‘ravigote’ or tartar-sauce. 501. Knuckles (jarrets) of veal, in ‘hochepot’. — Saw two large knuckles of veal above the knuckle-joint, strew a stewpan with trimmings of fat and sliced onions, place the knuckles thereon, surround them with a pound of streaky bacon, cut in two, and blanched ; add two large carrots, cut in two transversally ; a large turnip, also in two, and a few sprigs of aromatics, cloves, peppercorns, and salt. Moisten the meats and the vegetables with a half-pint of broth, which reduce to a half-glaze ; moisten again to three parts their height, let the liquid boil for a few minutes, then remove the stewpan on to a moderate fire, so that, by the time when the meats and vegetables appear to be done, the moisture may be reduced to half-glaze. On the other hand, blanch and braise, as usual, and separately, a cabbage cut in quarters, a dozen lettuces ; blanch and glaze two or three dozen small onions. When the knuckles of veal are ready to be served, range them, one beside the other, on an oblong dish ; set on each side half the bacon, and surround it with the carrots, turnips, lettuces, cabbages, and onions ; dilute the cooking-stock with gravy, boil it, skim off the fat, and strain it on to the dish. 502. Sweetbreads, ‘à la financière’. — Steep and blanch four nice sweetbreads, refresh, and place them under press ; when cold, pare, season, and215 BUTCHER’S MEAT. — VEAL. range them in a sauté-pan, spread with butter ; place the saute-pan on the tire, to set the sweetbreads on both sides; then moisten with a gill of good, clear broth, which reduce to a glaze. Turn the sweetbreads, moisten anew, and reduce the stock once more to a glaze. When the sweetbreads are done, and well glazed ; dish them, and surround them with the following garnish : Garnish ‘à la finançière’. — Pour a glass of white wine into the stewpan, wherein the sweetbreads have been prepared; let the stock boil up, pass it through a sieve, skim away the fat carefully, and reduce it to half; add to it an equal volume of brown-sauce and three or four raw truffles, peeled and cut in quarters. Five minutes after, add a few button-mushrooms, and season the Tagout’ with a little cayenne. At the first bubbling, add a score of small ‘quenelles’, moulded with a spoon, and poached. 503. Sweetbreads, in ‘papillotes’. — Cut up in slices two or three scalded sweetbreads, season with pepper and salt. Chop one onion with a few shalots, fry them with a little melted fat bacon, without allowing them to take color; add twice its volume of chopped, fresh mushrooms; let their moisture evaporate, season, and add to these fine-herbs, five ounces of raw ham cut in small dice ; which heat, then remove the stewpan back, and throw into the preparation a pinch of chop- ped parsley. Cut some squares of foolscap paper seven inches by four, fold them lengthwise, cut them with the scissors to a round shape, without separating their two parts ; oil, and mask the paper with a small layer of rasped bacon ; then apply on each side of the slices of sweetbreads a layer of fine-herbs, and put them into the paper, which fold all over. Place these ‘papillotes’ on a gridiron, warm them either in a slow oven, or on hot ashes, without blackening the paper ; dish them up. 504. Sweetbreads fried, Italian way. — Blanch three or four mid- dling-sized sweetbreads, refresh them, let them cool, and cut each of them broadwise ■into three slices; which season, and flour. Pour into a kitchen-basin three or four tablespoonfuls of cooked fine-herbs, add two raw eggs, beat the preparation well up with a fork, dip the slices of sweetbread therein; roll them in bread-crumbs, and plunge them into hot hog’s lard ; when of a nice color, drain, and dish them up on a napkin. 505. ‘Rissoles’ of sweetbreads. — Scald two sweetbreads, refresh them, let them cool ; cut them in slices', and afterwards in small dice. Chop one onion, fry it with butter in a stewpan, add to it five ounces of ham, and the same of raw mushrooms cut in dice : reduce the moisture of these, and add the sweetbreads. Season the preparation; a few seconds after, moisten with two spoonfuls of stiffCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 216 ‘béchamel’-sauce, thus forming a firm preparation ; take it off the fire, and let it cool. Roll out about a pound of trimmings of puff-paste into a thin square flat; set on the paste, at a little distance from the edges, some walnut-sized parts of the sweet- bread-preparation, two inches distant one from the other; wet the paste, and fold its edges over, applying it with the thumb, and stamp afterwards the ‘rissoles’ with a plain cutter in a half-moon-shape. Place these ‘rissoles’ evenly on a baking-sheet, egg, and push them into the oven ; when baked, take them out, and dish them on a folded napkin, in pyramids. 506. ‘Tourte’ of sweetbreads. — First of all prepare a ‘quenelle’ force- meat of veal, in the same proportions, as for chickens ; when passed through a sieve, add to it a few spoonfuls of cooked fine-herbs. Cut up, in rather thick slices, three or four sweetbreads, blanched, and cooled under press ; place them in a sauté-pan with melted butter, season, and fry them on both sides ; the flesh having set, moisten with four tablespoonfuls of madeira ; and when reduced, add to it a few spoonfuls of fine-herbs. When well mixed up, remove the stewpan back. Spread over a round baking-sheet a flat of short paste, the centre of which cover with a layer of veal force-meat; range thereon the sweetbreads and fine-herbs in a dome-shape, alternated with a few pieces of raw ham. Mask this dome with a thin layer of force-meat, and finish the ‘tourte’, proceed- ing as in No. 336 : egg, and bake it in a moderate oven. When done, slip it on a dish, make a circular opening on its top, into which introduce a small garnish of mushrooms. Cover the ‘tourte’ again, and serve it. 507. Sweetbreads, with Perigueux-sauce. — Divide two blanched and cold sweetbreads in slices ; season, and fry them on both sides with clarified butter, in a flat stewpan; moisten with a little wine, and add half a pound of raw truffles in small dice. Cover the stewpan, reduce the moisture to a glaze. Baste the ‘ragout’ with a little brown-sauce, take it off the fire, and keep it in the ‘bain- marie’. On the other hand, prepare some veal ‘quenelle’ force-meat (see No. 527) ; fill with it a buttered border-mould, shaking the mould on to a cloth, and poach it in the ‘bain-marie’ ; when firm, turn it out on a hot dish, on the centre of which, serve up the ‘ragout’. 508. Sweetbreads, ‘à la Chartreuse’ (D. 78). — Lard three nice blan- ched sweetbreads with bacon, place them in a stewpan garnished with bacon and vegetables, moisten to their height with good broth, and braise them, proceeding as directed in No. 502. At the last moment glaze them to a nice color.217 BUTCHER’S MEAT. VEAL. Meanwhile, butter a plain border-mould. Cut up, with a thin cutter, small round pieces of turnip and carrot, about an inch long; boil them separately in salted water, keeping them a little firm. When cold, dry them on a cloth, then cut them slantwise at both extremities, and range them against the sides of the border-mould, in the way shown in the drawing; then fill the hollow of the border with mashed potatoes, Fig. 78. finished with yolks of eggs and butter, as for ‘croquettes’; cover the top with a round of buttered paper, and poach the border in the ‘bain-marie’ for half an hour. Afterwards turn it out on a hot dish, fill the centre with a garnish of cooked mush- rooms, whereon dish the sweetbreads in a triangular form, set on the top a large ‘quenelle’ decorated with truffles, poached, and a large button-mushroom, run through by a small iron-skewer. Send up in a sauce-boat, the cooking-stock of the sweet- breads, strained, freed of the fat, and thickened with a little tomata-sauce. 509. Veal cutlets, broiled, with Colbert-sauce (D. 79). — Cut up ten veal-cutlets, beat them slightly, pare them neatly ; season, dip them in melted butter, and bread-crumb; place them on a gridiron to broil, on both sides, on a moderate fire, for a quarter of an hour; dish them afterwards in a circular order, the ceptre of which fill with french-beans : mask the cutlets with the following sauce :218 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. Colbert-sauce. — In the simplicity of its preparation, and the delicacy of its taste, this sauce is one of the finest productions of the modern school; indeed it is to be regretted, that this invention does not bear the name of the practitioner, who conceived it. It is a happy inspiration, which once propagated, will become popular. The nature of this sauce is such, that one can employ it for meats, as well as for fish, and even with several sorts of vegetables : it may be served with roasted, broiled, and fried dishes; no sauce, either ancient or modern, can be compared with it in this respect; and we must remark by-thc-bye, that its preparation docs not require much knowledge, nor give much trouble. Let me recommend it, as a very useful study. Work six ounces of good butter with a tablespoonful of chopped parsley ; add a - point of nutmeg. Pour into a small stewpan a gill and a half of melted meat-glaze; let it boil up, then remove it immediately back, and introduce into it by degrees, stirring quickly with a spoon, the prepared butter, in small bits, alternating with the juice of three or four lemons, and avoiding ebullition. When the sauce is of a nice consistence, add a tablespoonful of cold water, and take it off the fire. 510. ‘Croquettes’ of sweetbreads. — Cut up in dice three or four cooked sweetbreads, put them in a kitchen-basin, with half their quantity of lean ham, and the same of mushrooms, likewise in dice. Pour into a flat stewpan about three gills of strained ‘béchamel’-saucc; reduce it over a sharp tire, stirring, and introducing into it, by degrees, a few spoonfuls of good raw cream ; at last add to it a little melted glaze, and work it, until succulent and well thickened. Now add the previously prepared ‘salpicon’, mix it up with the sauce, and remove the stewpan back ; season the preparation with a little nutmeg; pour it on a dish, cover it with paper, and let it cool. A few hours after, take the preparation with a spoon, in equal portions ; which drop on a table sprinkled with bread-crumbs, and roll them into a cork-shape, three inches long ; dip these pieces into beaten eggs, drain, and bread-crumb them ; arrange them, taking six or eight together, on several stewpan-lids, thus being enabled to plunge them all at once into hot dripping. Allow them to take color, then drain them, dish up on a napkin, and surround them with fried parsley. 511. Sweetbreads, in shells. — Cut up in dice, three cooked sweetbreads; put them into a stewpan, and mix them with a third of their volume of cooked ox-tongue in dice. Pour into a stewpan half a pint of good white-sauce, reduce it on the fire, intro- ducing into it a few spoonfuls of good gravy, or some melted glaze : when of a nice thickness, introduce again a few spoonfuls of cooked fine-herbs. After two seconds, add to it the previously prepared ‘salpicon’, and immediately remove flicBUTCHER’S MEAT. VEAL. 219 pan back ; season with a little nutmeg, and fill with the preparation seven or eight either natural or silver shells; sprinkle them with bread-crumbs, haste with a little melted butter; heat the shells, for two minutes, at the entrance of the oven, and then salamander them. 512. Veal-cutlets, ‘à la bouchère’. — Choose a good neck of veal, pare the rib-hones square, so as to cut therefrom six or seven cutlets, each with a bone to it. Cut the meat from the hones, only to the third of an inch off the hones-end, in order to disengage only a small part of this. Slightly heat the cutlets with the handle of a knife, and without paring them any more, season with salt and pepper, moisten slightly with melted butter or oil, and broil them on both sides, on a good fire; when done, dish them in a circular order, glaze them with a paste-brush, setting between each cutlet a small piece of hnaitre-d’hôtel’- butter ; surround the cutlets with lemons in quarters. 513. Veal-CUtletS, Lyon fashion. — Pare seven or eight good veal- cutlets ; season with suit and pepper, range them one beside the other, in a stewpan, with melted lard ; frying them on a brisk fire on both sides ; when done, drain the fat off, and pour into the stewpan a few spoonfuls of good broth; let it reduce to a glaze, turn the cutlets, moisten again with the same quantity of broth ; and when this is again reduced, dish up the cutlets. Pour into the stewpan about two gills of brown-sauce, and four tablespoonfuls of madeira; let it boil, and finish it with a piece of butter, chopped parsley, and four or five tablespoonfuls of gerkins in dice. Pour the sauce over the cutlets. 514. Veal-cutlets, Berlin fashion. — Trim seven or eight veal cutlets, chop the meat slightly oil both sides, with the back of the knife; season with salt and pepper, round them, dip them into beaten eggs, and bread-crumb them. Melt six ounces of butter in a flat stewpan ; when it is hot, range the cutlets on the bottom of the pan, fry them on both sides ; drain them, and dish them; garnish on both sides with white asparagus, boiled in salted water, and dried on a cloth. Melt six ounces of butter in a stewpan, warm it, mix it with four or five tablespoonfuls of bread-crumbs; as soon as these are slightly fried, pour the sauce over the asparagus. 515. Veal-cutlets, Provence fashion. — Slice five or six large white onions, fry them in a stewpan with butter, on a moderate fire, until of a nice color; j season with salt and pepper, sprinkle over a little flour, and moisten with wine and [ gravy ; boil the mince on a very slow fire, for ten or twelve minutes. On the other hand, fry in butter on both sides, in a 'sauté’-pan, seven or eight veal-cutlets, seasoned, and floured ; as soon as set, drain the fat off the stewpan, andCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 220 moisten the cutlets, up to halt' their height, with broth ; start it to ebullition, draw the stewpan on a moderate tire ; cover it, keep it thus, until the cutlets be done, and the stock reduced to half-glaze. Then, mix in the onions, add a point of cayenne, and a little chopped parsley. Two minutes after, dish up the cutlets in a circular order, and pour the ‘mince’ into its centre. 516. Sweetbreads, Piémont fashion. — Scald (blanchir) two or three sweetbreads5 when cold, cut them up in slices, broadwise; season, and arrange these in a sauté-pan, with clarified butter, to fry both sides ; drain off the butter, moisten the sweetbread with a little wine; which reduce, and thicken the ‘ragout’ with a little light sauce. A few minutes after, add to it twelve ounces of raw white truffles, sliced very thin ; remove the pan back, and keep it covered. On the other hand, boil twelve ounces of rice ‘à la Piémontaise’ (seeRisot); when ready, pour it into a buttered border-mould, keep it in a hot-closet for seven or eight minutes, to let it set; then turn the border out on a hot dish, and place the ‘ragout’ on its centre. 417. Roasted sweetbreads. — Blanch four sweetbreads, refresh, trim, and lard them with bacon, on their smoothest surface. Place them in a kitchen-basin, salt, and baste them with a little oil; add a sliced onion, a few sprigs of parsley, thyme, and bay-leaf; cover, and let them macerate for one hour in this seasoning. Afterwards run them through with an iron-skewer, which fix on the spit. Surround them with buttered paper, roast them on a good fire for half an hour, then uncover them, baste with the drippings, and let them take a nice color, glazing frequently with a paste-brush. On the other hand, plunge into salted boiling water, a pint and a half of very fresh and tender green-pease ; as soon as done, drain them in a colander, pour them into a stewpan, season with a point of nutmeg, and a pinch of sugar; mix with a large piece of butter ; which melt, tossing the pease off the fire, and pouring over them two tablespoonfuls of ‘béchamel-sauce, dish them, with the sweetbreads laid on the top of them. '* 518. ‘Vol-au-vent’, Paris fashion (D. 80). — The ‘vol-au-vent’, is a piece of pastry, the execution of which offers difficulties, if no very good oven is at disposal. Here is the proper way to make the crust of the ‘vol-au-vent’ ; prepare some puff- paste with a pound of flour, and the same of butter (see No. 4( 3) ; give it five turns and a half, moisten slightly the surface of the paste ; fold it in two, and let it rest for five or six minutes ; then place it on a floured sheet of paper, and cut it to the size required (five or six inches in diameter). The paste should be cut on a model, (that221 BUTCHER’S MEAT. — VEAL. is, for instance, the cover of a stewpan), keeping the point of the knife to the out side. When it is cut, turn it out on a baking-sheet with the aid of the paper ; slightly flute the sides, and make a circular incision on the top, half an inch from the sides. Score the paste (in scrolls) on its centre; egg it, and push the baking- sheet into a hot oven, baking the ‘vol-au-vent’ for thirty or thirty-five minutes. When of a nice color, take it out, open, and empty it; slip it on a hot dish, and fill it with a Tagout’ composed of lambs’ or calves’ sweetbreads cut up in slices; scollops Fig. 80. of fat liver, sliced truffles, mushrooms, cocks’-combs, and ‘quenelles’. Dish the ‘ragout’ by layers, basting with brown-sauce, reduced with the trimmings of truffles, and half a glass of madeira. Put by for the top, a nice larded lamb’s sweetbread, glazed separately, and a dozen chicken-‘quenelles', moulded with a tablespoon, and poached. Glaze the larded sweetbread, and send up separately some of the brown- sauce in a sauceboat. 519. ‘Bouchées* of sweetbreads. — Steep in water two sweetbreads, blanch them in hot water, simply to set their exterior surface; refresh, and let them cool. Cut them afterwards in slices ; which season, fry them with butter on both sides, and let cool, to be cut in small dice. Place this ‘salpicon’ in a small stewpan, mix in half its volume of cooked mushrooms, and a fourth part of ox-tongue. Thicken it with ‘ bechamel’-sauce, reduced with liquor of mushrooms, and finished with a little good gravy or melted glaze, then keep the stewpan in the ‘bain-marie’. Prepare a puff-paste with a pound of flour, and the same of butter ; give it five turns and half, proceeding as directed in No. 403 ; let it rest for a few minutes, and roll it out in a thin square flat ; two minutes after, cut from its surface thirty round flats, with a plain tin-cutter, two inches in diameter. Range half of these rounds on a moistened baking-sheet, placing them half an inch distant, and moisten their surface with a paste-brush; bring the other rounds, by cutting out the centre,222 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. into the form of rings; take them one by one, and set them up on those first placed on the baking-sheet, covering them exactly ; egg the top of the paste, prick slightly the bottom-flats, and bake these ‘bouchées’ in a hot oven for eighteen minutes. When of a nice gold color, and the paste is done, take them off the oven, immediately detaching them from the baking-sheet, and tilling them with the prepared ‘salpicon’. Dish them on a folded napkin, and send them up immediately. 520. Mince (hâchis) of raw veal and bacon. — Remove carefully the sinews of about a pound of raw veal, minion-fillets, or meat from the ‘noix’ ; cut it up in pieces, add to it.the same quantity of fresh bacon, also cut up ; season highly with salt and spices, and put the whole into a chopping-machine, to convert it into paste. Take it out afterwards into a kitchen-basin, and keep it for use in a cool place. 521. Cooked veal-force-meat. — Pare a pound of minion-fillet of veal, cut it up in small dice, mix the meat with half a pound of fresh bacon, also in small dice. Fry, in a stewpan, two or three spoonfuls of chopped onion; when of a nice color, mix in it the meat, season with salt and good spices*, and fry it until about done ; then add five or six chopped mushrooms,' which cook until their moisture be extracted. Take the stewpan off the fire, let the meat cool, and pound it with a quarter of its volume of panada ; then add three or four yolks of eggs ; pass them through a sieve, place the force-meat in a kitchen-basin, work it with a spoon, and add to it a pinch of chopped parsley. 522. Timbale of minion-fillets of veal. — Pare two minion-fillets of veal ; trim away the skin and the sinew, cut them transversally into slices, the third of an inch thick, and season with salt and spices. Fry in butter two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion ; add to it the minion-fillets, which fry until set; add half a pound of raw ham, cut up in thin squares, and four or five raw truffles, peeled and cut in slices ; fry all together for a few minutes, and moisten the ‘ragout’ with the quarter of a glass of madeira ; reduce it to a glaze, and remove the stewpan back. Chop the trimmings of the raw truffles with half a pound of lean veal, the same quantity of fresh fat-bacon, and five ounces of raw ham ; season the preparation * Good spices, prepared with suitable care and skill, add greatly to the pleasant odor of the dishes, and at the same time do not irritate, but invigorate the stomach. Spices, however, with such conditions of excellence, are very rarely to be purchased. But there is in Paris, and no doubt also to be had in London, a new article of commerce, duly put together by a man of business ; the spices in which include, in my opinion, all the qualities to be desired : they are known by the name of‘cooking-spices’ (épices des cuisiniers) ; and are the only ones in use now, in well-provided kitchens.BUTCHER’S MEAT. — VEAL. 223 with spices, and very little salt ; chop it a little more, until the mixture be completely worked. Line a ‘timbale’-mould, or simply a stewpan, with short-paste (see No. 447). Spread the bottom and sides with a layer of the prepared force-meat, and fill the hollow with the ‘ragout’. Mask also the top with a layer of force-meat, fold over the edges of the paste, and cover the ‘timbale’ with a round of thin paste ; which solder to that of the sides, then set the ‘timbale’ on a small baking-sheet, and' push it into a moderate oven. A quarter of an hour after, cover the top with paper, and bake it thus, for one hour. When ready to serve, turn the ‘timbale’ out on a dish, make a round opening on the top, through which pour into the interior, half a pint of brown-sauce, reduced with a little madeira, and mixed with a few ‘quenelles’. Cover it again, and serve. 523. English ‘Rissoles’. — Cut up, in thin slices, half a pound of good calf’s liver ; fry them, with chopped bacon, on both sides ; when done, add six ounces of sliced cooked truffles; season, pour over four tablespoonfuls of madeira, which reduce quickly, and remove the stewpan back. Meat and truifles being cold, pound, and pass them through a sieve ; place then the preparation in a kitchen-basin, and introduce into it a few spoonfuls of melted glaze, or some reduced sauce. With this preparation, and some trimmings of puff-paste, proceed to make some ‘rissoles’ (see No. 505), cutting them with a fluted cutter (coupe-pâte) ; dip them into beaten eggs, bread-crumb, and fry them of a nice color; afterwards drain, and then dish them up, in two circles, over a folded napkin, placing on the top some fried parsley. 524. ‘Grenadins’of veal, ‘à la jardinière’. — Cut from a‘noix’or minion-fillet of veal, eight or ten scollops, the third of an inch thick ; wet, beat them ; slightly, and pare them to an oblong form, corresponding to the size of a mutton- cutlet. When pared, lard them (on their centre only) with bacon ; place them one beside the other, in a flat stewpan, spread with trimmings of lard and sliced onion ; i moisten with a sufficient quantity of broth, to cover them ; set the stewpan on a brisk fire, to reduce the moisture quickly one third. Then salt the ‘grenadins’, cover them with a buttered paper, draw the stewpan off to a slow fire, place the lid on, and put i some hot ashes on it ; or else set the stewpan in a slow oven, baking the ‘grenadins’ for three quarters of an hour, basting from time to time. When done, glaze them with their stock, reduced to half-glaze : dish them in a circular order, and fill the cavity with a garnish ‘à la jardinière’ : Jardiniere of vegetables. — Take a few tablespoonfuls of carrots, and the same of turnips in balls, some cucumbers scooped with a vegetable-spoon, french-beans in224 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. lozenges, beans and flageolets-beans ; all of these vegetables must be blanched, or cooked, separately, according to their qualities. At the last moment, put them together into a flat stewpan with butter, heat them quickly, tossing them ; season with salt, nutmeg, and a pinch of sugar, and thicken afterwards with a little good ‘béchamel’-sauce. 525. Veal-kidneys, Breton fashion.— Mince five or six onions; put them into a thin stewpan with butter and a bay-leaf, fry them on a moderate tire, stirring until they become a nice color; season with salt, pepper, and a point of sugar ; sprinkle over a tablespoonful of flour, and moisten with two gills of gravy, then finish cooking them gently ; by this time the sauce will be about reduced. On the other hand, slice a raw veal-kidney, put it into a frying-pan with butter; season, and fry it on a brisk fire ; as soon as well set, take it off the fire, baste with a few spoonfuls of glaze and a little lemon-juice, finish with a little chopped parsley, tossing it, until all the slices be well soaked with glaze. Place the Tagout’ of onions on a hot dish, leaving a hollow in the centre, into which pour the kidneys, and sur- round them with fried bread-'croûtons’, glazed with a paste-brush. 52G. Veal-kidney, with wine. — Divide a nice veal-kidney into several . parts ; remove the sinewy parts, and cut it in slices, not too thin. Melt four ounces of butter in a frying-pan ; when hot, add the slices of kidney ; season, toss them over a brisk fire to set; as soon as their moisture is evaporated, take them out with a skimmer into a basin. Put into a stewpan two tablespoonfuls of chopped shalôt and onion, fry them without allowing them to take color ; add about fifteen raw mushrooms in quarters, a clove of garlic, and a bunch of parsley; moisten with half a glass of white wine, and the liquor of the kidney passed through a sieve; reduce the liquid to half, thicken it with a little brown-sauce, and two tablespoonfuls of melted glaze ; three minutes after, throw into it the slices of kidney, heat them without boiling, take out the bunch and garlic, sprinkle over some chopped parsley, and add the juice of one lemon. Then dish the kidney up, and surround it with bread-Troûtons’, fried and glazed. 527. Quenelles of veal, Toulouse fashion (D. 81). — Cut up fourteen ounces of meat, or pared minion-fillet, of veal ; pound it, and add three quarters of its volume of panada, prepared with rice-flour ; five minutes later, add to the force-meat the same quantity of butter, as of panada ; when well mixed, add two or three yolks of eggs, salt, and nutmeg ; and pass the whole through a sieve ; put it then into a kitchen-basin, introduce into it two tablespoonfuls of raw cream, and try its consistence. Take then two tablespoons, — iron ones are best, — put one of them into hot water, and fill the other with force-meat, smooth it on the surface with a small225 BUTCHER’S MEAT. — VEAL. knife into a dome-shape, and then scoop it out with the other spoon, removing the ‘quenelle’ at one jerk, drop it on the bottom of a buttered sauté-pan; and continue thus, arranging the ‘quenelles’ one beside the other. When nearly time to serve, pour into the sauté-pan a sufficient quantity of boiling salted water to cover the ‘quenelles’; let the liquid boil, then remove the pan back, put the lid on, and four or five minutes later, drain the ‘quenelles’ with a skimmer, and dry them on a cloth. Fig. 81. Pile on the centre of a dish, a garnish composed of truffles, cocks’-combs and button-mushrooms, dish the ‘quenelles’ all round, upright, place to the top a few cocks’-combs and truffles ; mask garnish and ‘quenelles’ with some ‘velouté’-sauce, reduced with trimmings of mushrooms. This entrée is represented, set on a hot-water dish; a method, which I re- commend. 528. Veal-kidneys, Polish fashion. — Trim the fat off a large veal- kidney, or two small ones ; cut it into large slices, which season with salt and pepper; flour slightly, dip them into beaten eggs, bread-crumb, and fry them on both sides in a stewpan with butter. When ready to serve, place on a dish a mince of‘cèpes’, dish the slices of kidney all round, and mask them with a few spoonfuls of Colbert- sauce (see. No. 218). 529. Veal-kidney pudding. — Pare away the sinewy fat adhering to a veal-kidney, cut it up into rather thick slices, which season with salt, and cayenne pepper ; sprinkle over a tablespoonful of chopped shalot, and the same of chopped parsley. With a suet pudding-paste (see No. 390) line a dome-mould ; or a large bowl ; spread the bottom with thin slices of fillet of beef, and a few pieces of raw ham; arrange thereon the slices of kidney, by layers, alternated with small pieces 15COSMOPOLITAN COOKEKY. 226 of kneaded-butter, pour over a little melted glaze, and cover it up with a Hat of paste. Wrap the mould in a napkin, plunge it into boiling water, and boil the pudding for an hour and a quarter. Drain the mould, turn the pudding out on its dish, and glaze it with a paste-brush. 530. Hot pie (‘pâté-chaud’), with chives. — This is a good plain entrée, often served in Paris. With a pound of lean veal, trimmed and chopped, two pounds of veal-kidney- suet well cleaned, a whole egg, salt, and nutmeg, prepare a ‘godiveau’ force-meat, proceeding as in No. 541. With twelve ounces of butter, and two pounds of Hour, prepare some short- paste ; let it rest, and line with it a buttered ‘paté-chaud’ mould, set on a baking- sheet. Add to the force-meat two tablespoonfuls of chopped chives, and till with it the hollow of the mould, mounting it in a dome-fashion; cover it with a flat of paste, pinch the crest all round, egg the pie, and bake it in a moderate oven, for forty-five minutes ; when done, slip it on a dish, after having removed the mould. Make an opening on the top, and with the aid of a small knife, remove in one piece the two- thirds of the force-meat, leaving thus a hollow in the centre. Fill it with a ‘ragout’ of sliced lamb-sweetbreads, mixed up with a few sliced mushrooms, and a good brown-sauce, well reduced, but little thickened. Cover the pie, and serve. 531. Calves’ feet, farced. — Blanch and boil three or four calves’ feet, proceeding as directed in No. 536 ; drain them, bone each half carefully, and cut each transversally in two ; season, arid let them nearly cool. On the other hand, prepare a few spoonfuls of cooked tine-herbs with onion, shalbt, fresh mushroom, truffle, and parsley; when cold, add half their volume of cooked ham in small dice, and thicken the preparation with the quarter of its quantity of ‘quenelle’ force-meat ; spread it then with a spoon on the bands of calves’ feet on one side, and roll these in the form of ‘paupiettes’. Sprinkle over bread- crumb, dip them into beaten eggs, bread-crumb again, run them through with a small wooden skewer, and plunge them into hot dripping. When of a nice color, drain, and dish them, sending up separately a boatful of tomata-sauce. 532. Calves’ feet, Hungarian fashion. — Blanch and boil calves’ feet, three (see No. 536) keeping them a little firm ; drain, bone them carefully, and cut them up in oblong squares. Slice a large onion, fry it with butter or lard, without allowing it to take color, and add the calves’ feet ; which season with a little salt, and a pinch of ‘paprica’, moisten with a sufficient quantity of brown-sauce to cover them, and finish cooking them slowly.227 BUTCHER’S MEAT. — VEAL. On the other hand, pound the fillets of two or three salted anchovies, add a pinch of chopped parsley, the same of taragon, chervil, burnet, chive, shalot, capers, and gerkins, also chopped; pound the fine-herbs well, till the whole is converted into paste, add a piece of butter of the same volume; two minutes after, pass it through a sieve; divide it into small parts, which gradually introduce into the stew, tossing it off the fire ; finish it with a tablespoonful of good mustard, and serve. 533. ‘Crépinettes’ of calves’ feet. — Bone, and cut up in small dice, two cooked calves’ feet ; when about cold, place this ‘salpicon’ in a basin, season with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and cayenne, then add a quarter its volume of raw truifles, also pa dice, baste with half a glass of madeira, and let it macerate for two hours. Take an equal volume of raw pork-mince, season well, and mix the ‘salpicon’ with it. Divide the preparation into equal parts, the size of an egg, flatten them into oblong squai’es, place them on a squai’e piece of pig’s caul, and wrap them up, leaving- no opening, and keeping them of an elongated form ; then moisten with melted butter; set them on a gridiron, and broil them for a quarter of an hour on a moderate fire. Then serve them on a vei’y hot dish. 534. Calves’feet, Antwerp fashion. — Blanch and boil four or five calves’ feet, proceeding as in No. 536; drain, and bone them carefully, cut them into fillets, or oblong squares ; put them into a kitchen-basin, season with salt, cayenne pepper, and nutmeg ; sprinkle over capers, gerkins, parsley, taragon, and mushrooms, all of which chopped up. Add also a little good mustard, then place them in a mould, or on a square baking-sheet, put over a piece of greased paper, and leave them under pi*ess. Twelve hours later, take the ‘pain’ out of the mould, cut it up in slices, half an inch thick; flour, dip them into beaten eggs, and plunge them into plenty of hot dripping, giving them a nice color ; then drain, salt, and dish them up, with fried parsley round. 535. Calves’ feet, American fashion. — Blanch and boil three or four calves’ feet (see No. 536); drain, bone, cut them round with a tin-cutter, and place them in a stewpan with two dozeia mushrooms, cooked at the moment. Moisten them (covered) with a little ‘velouté’-sauce, finished with two tablespoonfuls of eurry- powder ; let them simmer for a quarter of an lioui', and thicken the sauce with a ‘liaison’ of two yolks of eggs. On the other hand, blanch half a pound of rice, then boil it in broth, keeping it firm, and not over-done ; when dried, thicken it with a piece of butter, and a pinch of grated parmesan ; season, and pour it into a buttered border-mould, pi-essing it slightly; keep it thus for ten or twelve minutes, then turn the border out on a dish, 15*COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 228 take off the mould, and fill the centre with the stew, finished with the juice of two lemons. 53C). Calves’ feet, broiled. — Split four calves’ feet in two ; bone, singe them carefully, tie them up, two and two, and scald them for ten minutes ; drain, and put them into a stoekpot with salt, vegetables, and water. Boil them over a moderate fire, for an hour and a half only, then steep them in cold water. On the other hand, mask a stewpan with an onion and a piece of celery-root, both sliced, a few trim- mings of raw ham, a bunch of parsley with aromatics, peppercorns, cloves, and a little lard : fry all these ingredients, on a moderate fire, for seven or eight minutes ; then moisten with half a bottle of white wine, and broth ; add a little salt, and after- wards the calves’ feet ; let the stock boil up, cover the stewpan, and remove it on to a moderate fire. When the feet are quite done, drain them anew, remove all the bones, season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg; let them cool between two dishes, and pare them ; sprinkle over a pinch of parsley chopped with two shalots ; roll them in bread- crumbs, and place them on a gridiron, to broil on a moderate fire, for a quarter of an hour, basting from time to time : dish them up, and send in separately a boatful of hot or cold ‘ravigote’-sauce. 537. Calves’ feet, Geneva fashion. — Take a few boiled calves’ feet; bone, season, and let them cool under press; then shred, and put them into a kitchen- basin ; season with salt and pepper, pour over a little vinegar, and let them macerate for twenty minutes ; drain them on a sieve. Put into another basin four boiled yolks of eggs, passed through a sieve, three whole raw eggs, and a tablespoonful of good mustard ; dilute the preparation, like mayonnaise ; season, add a little vinegar, and at last, a pinch of chive, parsley, and taragon, all of which chopped ; then add the calves’ feet to the sauce, and dish. 538. ‘Croustade’ of minion-fillets of veal (D. 82). — Prepare a batter of ‘polenta’ (see Vegetables) ; when sufficiently consistent, pour it into a large buttered stewpan, and let it cool for several hours ; turn it afterwards out on a round of paper, set on an overturned baking-sheet. Then carve the ‘croustade’, in the style shown by the drawing ; immediately butter it with a paste-brush, and push it into a hot oven, simply to set: then glaze it all over, take it out, and slip it on a dish. Scoop slightly the upper surface, and keep it hot. Pare three minion-fillets of veal, wrap them up in thin layers of bacon, place them in a small ‘sauté’-pan ; baste with melted butter, and roast them in a moderate oven, keeping them underdone.220 BUTCHER'S MEAT. — VEAL. Divide them into equal-sized slices of an oblong form, arrange them evenly in a flat stewpan, and pour over some ‘veloutc’-sauce, reduced with extract of mushrooms. Cut from a pickled ox-tongue, boiled at the time, some slices, the same size as those of veal; place them in another stewpan, and glaze them with a paste- brush. When ready to serve, All the centre of the ‘croustade’ with a garnish of mushrooms, around which dish a circle of slices of veal, alternated with slices of Fig. 82. tongue; and on the top, place scrollwise a dozen middling-sized ‘quenelles’, pre- pared with the trimmings of the minion-fillets. Fix on the top of all some nice truffles, and mask the ‘quenelles’ with a little ‘velouté’-sauce. 539. Veal, ‘à la Marengo’. — Cut up in squares, about a pound and a half of lean veal, taken from the side of the knuckle ; put it into a stewpan with oil, to fry until it has reduced its moisture; season with salt and spices, add a bunch of parsley and aromatics, half a pound of streaky bacon, blanched and cut in squares, and two dozen small onions, also blanched. Draw the stewpan on a moderate fire, with hot ashes on its lid, and finish cooking the meat ; it should be kept a little firm. When ready to serve, drain a part of the fat off the stew, and pour over a few spoonfuls of tomata-sauce ; it requires but little sauce. Let the sauce boil up, then dish the stew, removing the aromatics. 540. Small patties ‘au Jus’, Provence fashion. — Butter a dozen channeled or fluted tartlet-moulds, and line them with short-paste; fill them with some ‘godiveau’ finished with a little chopped chive, cover this with a round piece of paper, and bake the patties in a moderate oven. Spread out half a pound of puff-paste very thin, and cut on it twelve channeled round flats of the size of the230 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. tartlet-moulds : range them on a baking-sheet, to bake them to a nice color. When tire small patties are done, take them out of the oven, and from the moulds ; scoop them on the centre, remove a part of the ‘godiveau’, and garnish them at once with a ‘salpicon’ of sweetbread, ox-palate, calf’s brain, ham, and mushrooms; the whole in large dice, and mixed up with some good thickened gravy. Then cover the patties with the round puff-paste flats, and dish them, in pyramids, on a folded napkin. 541. Hot pie (pâté-chaud) of godiveau, Metz fashion. — Weigh half a pound of minion-fillet of veal, with as much of chicken meat ; divide both in pieces, and chop them fine; pound, add a whole egg thereto ; pound two pounds of veal-kidney suet, previously picked and chopped ; five minutes afterwards, mix the meat and fat until converted to a pulp. Season the preparation, introduce into it two tablespoonfuls of ‘choux’-paste (without sugar), and later a whole egg; when smooth and compact, take it out of the mortar, and keep it on ice for one hour. With three parts of the force-meat mould some ‘quenelles’, on a flourcd-tahle ; poach them in salted boiling water, and drain them on a cloth. Line a ‘paté-chaud’-mould with short-paste, spread thinly the bottom, and the sides of the paste, with the force-meat, and keep; arrange the‘quenelles’in the hollow of the ‘pâté-chaud’ in two superposed garlands, alternating each of them with a slice of raw peeled truffle ; fill the hollow of the garlands with scollops of sweet- breads, slightly fried in butter, and intermingled with slices of truffles, mounting the garnish in a dome-like form ; mask it then with thin layers of bacon, and after- wards with a flat of short-paste ; which solder to the paste of the sides ; pinch it round, adorn the top with a few imitated leaves of paste; leave a hole in the top, thus facilitating the escape of the steam ; egg the dome, and push the hot pie into a slow oven, to bake for one hour. When done, take it out, slip it on a dish, remove the cover, pick out the bacon, and pour in a little thin madeira wine. Cover again, and then send it up. 542. ‘Croquettes’ of veal, Provence fashion. — Pare a piece of good, cooked, and cold veal, fa pound and a quarter) ; divide it in slices, and cut these into small dice ; place this ‘salpieon’ in a kitchen-basin, and add to it a third of its volume of cooked lean ham, also in dice. Slice four or five white onions, fry them over a slow fire, so as to cook and color them nicely ; season with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and a little sugar ; skim the fat off, and sprinkle over a handful of flour ; then gradually moisten the onions with milk, forming a rather thickisli sauce; which reduce on a brisk fire, stirring, and introducing into it a few tablespoonfuls of cream, and at last a little glaze; thus231 BUTCHER'S MEAT. — VEAL. giving the sauce some succulence ; when of a nice thickness, add the prepared ‘salpicon’. The ‘salpicon’ ought to be proportionate to the sauce, which if too plentiful, would render the preparation too soft. As soon as the ‘salpicon’ is mixed up with the onion, take the preparation off the fire, and pour it over a large dish, spread about the third of an inch thick ; cover it with buttered paper, and let it cool. Then take it with a spoon by equal portions (the size of a small egg), and let them drop on a table sprinkled with bread-crumbs; then roll them, in a cork-shape; dip them into beaten eggs; bread-crumb, fry them to a nice color, and dish them up, on a folded napkin, with fried parsley round. 543. ‘Timbale’ of veal, French fashion. — Prepare a pound and a half, or two pounds, of ‘quenelle’ force-meat in the conditions prescribed in No. 527 ; when passed through a sieve, place it in a kitchen-basin; work it with a spoon, to smooth it, and try a small part of it, rectifying if necessary. Butter a ‘timbale’- mould, and let the butter cool. Scald three sweetbreads, let them cool between two dishes, and then divide them into rather thick slices. Fry in a stewpan two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion with a little melted lard ; when of a light brown color, add to it half a pound of raw ham, cut in thin squares, and about fifteen button-mushrooms, split in two transversally ; a few minutes after, add the slices of sweetbread, season with good spices, and a little salt ; as soon as the moisture is reduced, moisten with a quarter of a glass of madeira ; cover the stewpan, and reduce the liquid to half; thicken then the stew with three table- spoonfuls of brown-sauce, reduced with a little good stock, but kept of a nice con- sistence ; and let the meat cool. On the other hand, line the sides of the buttered mould, with a layer of force- meat, the third of an inch thick, smooth it with the back of a tablespoon, dipped in tepid water; and fill the hollow of the ‘timbale’ with the prepared stew, cover the top with a layer of the force-meat, kept purposely; mask this force-meat with a buttered paper. Set the ‘timbale’ in a stewpan with boiling water to half its height, poach it on a very slow fire, with ashes on the lid, for three quarters of an hour at least. Ten minutes previous to serving, take out the mould, wipe it, turn it over on a dish, drain off the fat, remove the mould, and mask the ‘timbale’ with a little sauce reduced with madeira. 544. ‘Fricassée’ of veal, German fashion. — Take the half of a good breast of veal, divide it into regular pieces, not too large ; steep them in water, scald, dry, and put them into a stewpan with butter, two small onions, and one carrot; fry them a few minutes, sprinkle over a handful of flour, moisten with broth, stir the232 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. sauce until it boils, then remove it on to a moderate tire, adding a bunch of parsley, with aromatics. When the meat is done, strain the sauce, to thicken with a few diluted yolks of eg'gs, range the meats on a dish, garnishing with small groups of cauliflowers, heads of white asparagus, and with craytish-body-shells, stuffed with a force-meat, made of bread, butter, and chopped parsley. Mask the meats with the sauce, sprinkle over, with the aid of a paste-brush, a few drops of melted crayfish-butter, and some whole capers. 545. ‘Montglas’ of veal, Russ fashion. — Cut up apiece of roasted veal, about half a pound, into small fillets one inch long; which place in a kitchen- basin; add half their volume of calves’feet, previously boiled, cooled, and cut in fillets ; add also an equal quantity of pickled ox-tongue, the same quantity of cooked mushrooms, and of gerkins or ‘ogursis’ (salted cucumbers), the whole in fillets; season with salt, pepper, and oil, vinegar and mustard; mix the seasoning together, tossing them; let them macerate for half an hour, then drain the liquid, and thicken the preparation with a few spoonfuls of mayonnaise-sauce; sprinkle over a little chopped parsley, and some chives; dish it, and surround it with ‘croûtons’ of aspic-jelly. 546. Roasted calf’s liver. — Interlard a calf’s liver with bacon and fillets of truffles, both seasoned ; lard also the upper surface with fine cut bacon, leaving both ends without larding. Then place it in a kitchen-basin, season, baste with oil, add a few sprigs of parsley, aromatics, and a handful of trimmings of raw truffles; let it macerate therein for two or three hours : then wrap it up in oiled paper, first placing round it the whole ingredients of the marinade-stock ; fasten the paper on with string, and run an iron-skewer through the liver: fix it on the spit, and roast the liver for an hour and a half, basting it often. Ten minutes previous to serving, remove the paper, and glaze the liver with a paste-brush. On the other hand, peel five or six raw black truffles; which cut up into small dice, and put into a stewpan. Place the trimmings in another stewpan, pour over a glass of madeira, then reduce the liquid one third, and strain it over the truffles in dice; thicken the stock with a little good sauce, boil the truffles for seven or eight minutes. Then take the liver off the fire, dish it up, and surround it with the garnish of truffles. 547. ‘Pain’ of calves’ liver, in jelly (D. 83). — Prepare some calves’ liver force-meat proceeding as in No. 548, but without panada; when passed through a sieve, put it into a kitchen-basin, dilute with about the same volume of good and233 BUTCHER’S MEAT. — VEAL. strong, tepid aspic-jelly, and a few spoonfuls of melted glaze. Pour the preparation into a stewpan, stirring it on ice to thicken it ; as soon as it is ready, take it out, add to it four or live spoonfuls of cooked truffles, cut in dice, and the same volume of cooked pickled tongue, also in dice ; pour immediately the preparation into a plain cylindrical mould embedded in pounded ice. Fig. 83. One hour after, dip the mould quickly into hot water; wipe it, arid turn the 'pain’ out on a cold dish, the sides of which glaze with half-set aspic-jelly ; decorate with some rounds or crescents of truffles, and spread the bottom of the dish with aspic-jelly. « 548. ‘Pain’ of calf’s liver, German fashion. — Take a piece (about a pound and a quarter) of a good calf’s liver; scrape it with a knife, removing the sinewy parts; pass it through a sieve, season with salt and pepper; add a small pinch of very fine chopped onion, as well as a little parsley. Put ten ounces of butter into a warm kitchen-basin; work it with a spoon like cream, and add to it, one by one, seven or eight yolks of eggs. The preparation being light and frothy, add to it a pinch of flour, three handfuls of fresh rasped bread-crumbs, and at last the liver ; season, and try a small part of it in a tartlet-mould, which poach in the oven. Butter a large plain cylindric mould ; bread-crumb, and till it with the prepa- ration ; set the mould on a small battered sheet with a little water, cover its top with buttered paper, and push it into a moderate oven, baking it for three quarters of an hour. Take the mould out of the oven, drain the fat, turn the ‘pain’ out on a hot dish, and mask it with some piquant-sauce. 549. Calf’s liver, Milan fashion. — Cut up a good calf’s liver into a dozen thin slices, which beat slightly, trim, season with salt and spices; flour, and dip them into beaten eggs, drain, and then plunge them into hot hog’s lard. When done and nicely colored, drain them, salt slightly, and dish them up, with lemons in quarters.234 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 550. Soufflé of calf’s liver. — Slice the third of a calf’s liver, fry it quickly with melted fat-bacon ; season, then add a few trimmings of truffles, and sprinkle over a pinch of pounded aromatics ; when well set, take it off the tire, allow it to cool, pound, and then remove it. Pound also a little panada (the fifth of the calf’s liver in quantity), with the same of cooked calf’s udder (‘tétine’), or if not at hand, with a piece of butter; these two ingredients being well mixed, introduce into it the pounded liver. Season the force-meat, pass it through a sieve, put it into a kitchen-basin ; add to it four or five spoonfuls of madeira-sauce, reduced with a little meat-glaze, six yolks of eggs, one by one, and at last four whipped whites of eggs. Pour the preparation into a buttered ‘souffle’- pan, which set on a sheet, and bake the ‘soufflé’ in a moderate oven, for twenty-five or thirty minutes. Serve, as soon as done. 551. Calf’s liver, English way. — Cut seven or eight nice slices off a calf’s liver ; season, flour, and dip them into beaten eggs. Cut the same number of slices of streaky bacon, of the same size, put them into a frying-pan, with a little butter, to heat them on both sides ; then take them out of the pan, and replace them immediately by the slices of liver, which fry on both sides. Afterwards dish them up in a circular order, alternating each slice of liver with one of bacon ; fill the centre with mashed potatoes, and pour a little sauce over. A very excellent dish for lunch. 552. ‘Quenelles’ of calves’ liver, German fashion. — Put into a mortar ten ounces of calves’ liver, previously grated with a knife; pound it, pass it through a sieve, put it into a kitchen-basin, season, and add to it two tablespoonfuls of cooked fine-herbs. Work with a spoon, in a kitchen-basin, five ounces of softened butter, intro- duce into it, one by one, two whole eggs and one yolk ; when the preparation is frothy, add to it, two small handfuls of bread-crumbs, a tablespoonful of flour, and then the liver. Season the preparation, try a small part of it in boiling water, rectifying it if necessary; and then take it out with a tablespoon, in small parts, which drop into a stewpan of salted boiling water : at the first bubbling, remove the pan back. When the ‘quenelles’ are set, drain them, dish them up, and pour over some bread-crumbs, slightly fried in butter. 553. Calf’s liver, Bordeaux fashion. — Get a middling-sized very white calf’s liver, interlard it inwardly with fillets of fat bacon, and with a clove of garlic also in slices ; season with salt and pepper, sprinkle over a handful of chopped ‘cèpes’, wrap it up in some pig’s caul, and tie it last ; this done, run it through with anBUTCHER’S MEAT. — VEAL. 235 iron-skewer; which fix on the spit, and roast the liver at a good fire, for three quarters of an hour, basting with the drippings, mixed up with a few* spoonfuls of vinegar. When the liver is done, take it off the spit, remove the string, and dish it up, without removing the pig’s caul. Then mix a little good gravy in the drippings, which let boil up, and then skim off its fat. Put into a small stewpan, two table- I spoonfuls of chopped shalôt, fry it with lard, then add two or three tablespoonfuls of J chopped ‘cèpes’, and three minutes after, moisten with about a half-pint of brown- sauce ; which boil for a few minutes : put in a pinch of pepper, a pinch of chopped | parsley, and the juice of one lemon : pour the sauce over the liver. 554. Calf’s liver, Paris fashion. — Choose- a very white calf’s liver, remove the upper skin, as well as the spleen, and the gall : interlard it inwardly with seasoned fillets of ham and fat bacon, but operating from underneath, so that the fillets do not cross the top-surface. When larded, place it in a kitchen-basin, season with salt and spices, add to it a few sprigs of parsley, bay-leaf, thyme, and a few trimmings of truffles ; then let it macerate for two hours ; wrap it up in a large piece of pig’s caul, surrounding it with the ingredients of the marinade, and fasten the pig’s caul with string. Chop eight ounces of lard, melt it in a stewpan, add to it the liver ; fry it for a quarter of an hour, and cover the stewpan; which remove back, with hot ashes on its lid, braising the liver for one hour, occasionally turning it ; then add two dozen small carrots, and the same of small onions, slightly blanched ; placing the onions on one side of the liver, and the carrots on the other ; slightly salt these vegetables, | cover the stewpan, and continue cooking on a slow fire. One hour afterwards, the liver and vegetables must be done. Then drain the liver, dish it, with the vegetables all round; skim the fat off the stock, add to it a glass 1 of white wine, and a little gravy, reduce the liquid to half, and thicken it with brown- sauce. A few minutes after, add to it a pinch of pepper, and strain the sauce over the liver. 555. ‘Terrine’ of calf’s liver, Provence fashion. — Get a good calf’s liver, cut it in slices, which put into a frying-pan with melted fat-bacon, a tew sprigs of aromatics, a little chopped onion, and a few trimmings of truffles and mushrooms ; fry the liver quickly, season with salt and spices ; when about done, moisten with four tablespoonfuls of madeira ; which reduce, remove the pan back, allowing the preparation to cool. On the other hand, chop the same quantity (as liver) of fresh fat-bacon ; pound, add by degrees the bacon, season the preparation, adding to it a point of garlic, and iCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 236 pass it through a sieve; then put it into a kitchen-basin, add the fourth part of its volume of blanched fat-bacon cut in small squares, four tablespoonfuls of cooked fine-herbs, and the same of ham in small dice. Choose an earthen pan (terrine), that can stand the heat of the oven, and large enough to hold the quantity of preparation ; till it up, mask the top with thin layers of fat bacon, cover the ‘terrine’ with its lid, and set it in a sauté-pan with a little water, baking it in a moderate oven for two hours. A quarter of an hour after its being out of the oven, cover the preparation with a piece of wood of the interior diainetei* of the ‘terrine’, and set a weight upon it, thus allowing it to cool ; when completely cold, cut it up, then place the ‘terrine’ on its dish, and surround it with aspic-jelly. 556. ‘Pain’ of calf’s liver, French way. — Chop a small onion, fry it with five ounces of melted fat-bacon ; add a bay-leaf, a little thyme, five ounces of fresh bacon in small dice, and at last about a pound and a quarter of sliced calf’s liver. Season with salt, pepper, and spices ; and give the liver a jerk, while over the fire ; when about done, sprinkle over a handful of fresh chopped mushrooms, and ;i few trimmings of truffles, moisten with half a glass of madeira ; which reduce quickly, and take the preparation off the fire to cool. Put into the mortar a piece of panada, about a quarter of the volume of the liver-preparation ; pound it a few seconds, add gradually to the preparation, two whole, and four yolks of eggs; a few seconds after, pass the force-meat through :i sieve ; put it into a kitchen-basin, season, and work it for a few minutes with a spoon. Butter a plain cylindric mould, till it with the preparation, and poach in the ‘bain- marie’ for forty minutes. When ready to serve, turn the ‘pain’ out on a hot dish, and pour over some madeira-sauce. 557. ‘Pain’ of calf’s liver, glazed. — Melt in a frying-pan five ounces of rasped fat-bacon, mix with it a small chopped onion; fry this, without allowing it to take color ; then add a pound and a quarter of sliced calf’s liver, ten ounces of fresh fat-bacon in small dice, a bay-leaf and a little thyme; set the frying-pan on a brisk fire, season, and fry the liver until well done; moisten it afterwards with a quarter of a glass of madeira ; which reduce quickly, then take the preparation off the fire. When cold, pound it with a quarter of its volume of panada, finish it with three yolks of eggs, and pass it through a sieve ; put it then into a kitchen-basin, and add to it a ‘salpicon’ of truffles, tongue, and calf’s udder, boiled, or simply some cooked fat-bacon, the whole cut into middling-sized dice ; the ‘salpicon’ should be about a third the volume of the prepared force-meat. Mask inwardly (at the bottom and on the sides), a large ‘charlotte’-mould with237 BUTCHER'S MEAT. — MUTTON. layers of bacon ; pour into it the preparation of calf’s liver, and place it in a small sauté-pan, with a pint of hot water, push it into the oven (at a slow heat), and poach the ‘pain’ for three quarters of an hour. If no oven be at hand, poach it in a stewpan with tire on its lid. When the ‘pain’ is done, take the mould out of the water, and allow it to cool for five or six hours. Dip the mould afterwards into boiling water, introduce the blade of a knife between the ‘pain’ and its sides, and turn it out on the back of a plate, removing carefully the layers of bacon ; smooth the surface with the blade of a knife, dipped in hot water : then glaze it with a paste-brush ; the glaze having cooled, set the ‘pain’ on a cold dish, taking it off the flat with a stewpan-lid ; sur- round it then with aspic-jelly, either chopped or in ‘croutons’, and serve. 558. Roast leg of mutton, with haricot-beans (D. 84). — It is not sufficient for a leg of mutton to be plump and fat, that the animal be of a good breed, it requires also to be kept long enough to be quite tender; without this indispensable condition, mutton is always tough. Neither the exact point that should be reached, nor the time requisite for its attainment, can be well described or precisely stated ; for this happy medium, for hanging after killing, must be subordinate to the variable influence of season and of climate. In some countries twenty-four hours may suffice to render a leg of mutton fit for cooking ; while in others eight or ten days will not be too much. It is a matter of appreciation, taught by experience; but in all ’cases, one should avoid the danger, of over-passing the extreme limit, beyond which, from an exaggerated period of hanging, the meat will become spoiled and quite unwholesome. The task of the physician is to restore the health, Fig. 84.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 238 when weakened, or impaired ; that of the cook, to provide for, and secure its pre- servation. Get a nice plump and fat leg of mutton ; heat it with the flat of a cutlet-hat, in order to hruise the fibres of the meat; round the top part, break up the sinew of the the knuckle, by folding the leg ; cut off the thin-end bone. Place the leg in a roasting-pan, put over it some lard or butter; sprinkle with salt, cover with a thick greased paper, baste while cooking; and, if the fat seem becoming too hot, add to it a few spoonfuls of hot water : for a leg of mutton weighing four to six pounds, forty-five to sixty minutes are required. When the leg is done, the souris, that is, the meat adhering to the thin-end, should be soft, to the touch: the less tender the leg is, the more should it be kept underdone. When done, drain, dish it up; mix half a pint of gravy with its cooking- stock, boil, strain, and skim off the fat. On the other hand, boil in salted water, half a quart of white dry haricot-beans ; keep them in their stock to the last moment, and drain them on a sieve. Chop two onions, fry them to a light brown color, in a stewpan with butter ; moisten with the stock of the leg of mutton, add a bunch of parsley, round a bay-leaf, give two bubblings to the liquid, and thicken with a piece of kneaded-butter. Keep the sauce light; boil it a while, and add to it the haricot-beans; season with salt, and pepper. A few minutes after, introduce into it a piece of butter, and a pinch of chopped parsley; take out the aromatics, and pour the beans on a small round dish ; place the leg on a hot oblong dish, put a ruffle to the bone, and send up the two dishes. Carving. — To be eaten in good condition, a leg of mutton should be carved in the dining-room, and handed round on warm plates to the guests. To carve the leg, it should never be left on the dish, where the garnish and sauce are, but be placed on an empty dish ; taking care that small accidents, often very disagreeable ones, be avoided. The lines, marked on the Ytoix’ of the leg, shown in the drawing, indicate the way in which it should be carved. 559. Leg of Mutton, Polish way. — Choose a good leg, hung till tender; pare the thin-end bone, and lay it in an earthen pan, just deep and large enough to hold it. Mince two or three onions, the same of carrots and celery-roots ; fry with clarified fat, moisten with three glassfuls of vinegar and the same of water ; let the liquid boil, add to it some sprigs of aromatics, thyme, bay-leaf, basil, two cloves of garlic, parsley, cloves, and peppercorns; continue boiling for twenty minutes. Take then the stewpan off the fire, let the marinade-stock nearly cool, pour it over the leg of mutton; which macerate therein for twenty-four hours, turning several times.BUTCHER’S MEAT. — MUTTON. 239 Drain the leg, wipe it on a cloth, put into a roasting-pan with a good piece of butter, and push it into an oven not too hot ; half an hour after, baste with two gills of the marinade-stock, and a pint of sour cream (smitane) ; finish cooking the leg, basting frequently; then place it on a dish; strain the cooking-stock, reduce it on the fire, until nicely thickened ; then pour it over the leg, and put a ruffle to the bone. 560. Leg of mutton, Milan fashion. — The Italians eat but little mutton, especially in Rome, and in Naples, where this meat has always a woolly taste ; but the Milanese, who possess some very good breeds, naturally set a far higher value on this meat. Cut off the knuckle-end of a leg of mutton ; bone it, on the opposite side, up to the inner joint; fill the hollow with raw mince (hâchis) composed of bacon, ham, mushrooms, a clove of garlic, a little piece of bread-crumb, soaked in broth and pressed, a whole egg, and a little pepper ; sew them together, put the leg into an earthen stewpan, with fat bacon, chopped and melted : let it fry till it take color, over a moderate fire, turning it over; season, add a few sliced vegetables, moisten with a glass of white wine, and as much of broth ; cover it with a round of paper, braise it gently four or five hours with fire on the lid, being careful to add a little broth at times. When the leg is done, drain, and set it on a hot dish ; mix a little broth or gravy in the cooking-stock; make it boil, strain, skim off the fat, reduce it to half- i glaze, and thicken with a few spoonfuls of tomato-sauce, so as that the sauce remain light ; surround the leg with a good ‘risot’ finished at the time ; baste it with a little sauce, and send the remainder in a sauceboat. 561. Boiled leg of mutton, English fashion. — Although a boiled | leg of mutton is but a very simple dish, yet it is not the less excellent, and appreciated by many a ‘gourmet’. This dish is of English origin, but is served | now a-days in nearly all parts of Europe; particularly in France, Germany, and Russia. In order to boil a leg of mutton, the meat must be of good quality, but not be too long kept, or too much settled (rassis). Cut the knuckle-end of the leg, round neatly the parts of the opposite end ; i weigh it, plunge into a braising-pan, three-parts filled with water in ebullition; as soon as the liquid again begins boiling, add to it a handful of salt, and some large turnips well cleansed. Shut the braising-pan, remove it back to the side of the fire, but in such a manner as to keep up a regular ebullition. Boil the leg, for as many quarters of anCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 240 hour, ns its weight is of pounds ; that is, a leg of six pounds must boil for an hour and a half, but the main point, not to be neglected, is, that the leg be quite done, just at the moment of serving. Drain the leg, as well as the turnips ; place them on a dish, and keep it warm ; mash the turnips, season them, mix in a little cream and butter; serve in a small deep dish. Put a ruffle to the knuckle of the leg, surround it with a garnish of various vegetables, boiled either in salted water or steam, mask the leg, very slightly, with a little butter-sauce ; send up in a sauceboat the remainder of the sauce, mixed with a pinch of small capers preserved in vinegar. 502. Leg of mutton, in ‘pot-pourri’. — Bone completely a leg of mut- ton, without opening it ; lard it inwardly with fillets of bacon, and of raw ham ; sew it to a round form, put it into a kitchen-basin, season, add to it some aromatics, cloves, and peppercorns ; pour over a bottle of good burgundy wine, cover the basin with a cloth, and keep it in a cool place for four hours. Six hours previous to serving, spread the bottom and sides of an earthen stock- pot with layers of bacon, put the leg of mutton thereon, and surround it with a few middling-sized onions, four large carrots in pieces, a pound of blanched pork- rinds divided into squares. Pour over the leg, the liquid and the ingredients of the marinade; cover the stockpot with a round of paper, and a deep plate, half full of water, set it on the fire, let the liquid boil ; then set the pan on hot ashes, sur- rounding half its height. The liquid should boil very gently, and be kept at the same degree during the whole time of cooking. This being completed, drain, and dish it up with the garnishes round,‘skim the fat off the cooking-stock, which strain over the leg. 5G3. Leg of Ardennes-mutton, Flemish fashion. — The genuine mutton of the Ardennes is small, its flesh being very black, delicate, and of an excellent aroma. Pare a leg of Ardennes-mutton, break up the sinew by folding it, and set it afterwards in a deep oval dish. Baste it with a pint of cooked marinade about cold, pour it over the leg, and let it macerate for six hours, turning from time to time ; drain it afterwards, wipe it on a cloth, put it into a roasting-pan with lard, which push into an oven, giving a nice color to all its surface ; then moisten with the marinade-stock, freed of fat, and strained ; cover it with paper, and finish cooking, basting frequently. When done, strain the cooking-stock into a stewpan, skim off the fat, reduce it to half-glaze, and thicken with a little brown-sauce ; a few minutes after, mix with the sauce a tablespoonful of red-currant jelly ; and, as soon as this is dissolved, take it off the fire. Drain the leg, put a ruffle on it, dish up, and pour the sauce over.BUTCHER’S MEAT. — MUTTON. 241 504. Haunch of mutton, braised * (D. 85). — Choose a haunch of mutton cut to the height of the first ribs, bone the loin, and the leg to the first joint; salt the meat inwardly, truss it to a pretty elongated form, and place it in an oblong stewpan, spread with trimmings of lard and vegetables ; salt slightly, and moisten with about a pint and a half of broth. Set the stewpan on the fire, reduce the broth to a glaze, moisten then the mutton to its height with broth ; let the liquid boil up, Fig. 85. then remove the pan on to a very slow lire, with live embers on its lid, keeping it thus for five hours at least, and longer if the haunch does not come from a young animal. In all cases, it is prudent to put it in cooking an hour sooner, thus avoiding all risk of serving the meat tough. When the mutton is properly done, take it up on a baking-sheet ; dilute its i stock with a glass of white wine, boil, skim off its fat, and strain it; reduce it to half-glaze, and thicken slightly with brown-sauce, or tomata-sauce. Remove the string from the mutton, cut it in slices in the way shown in the drawing ; dish up, put a ruffle on the bone, and surround it with a garnish of small glazed onions in groups ; glaze with a paste-brush, pour a part of the sauce on the bottom of the dish, and send the remainder in a sauceboat. 565. Mutton-steak, broiled, with Spanish tomata-sauce. Cut off a good large transversal slice, or steak, from the greatest breadth of a leg of mutton, about an inch and a half thick, sawing off the bone of the centre. Beat * What in the kitchen-vocabulary is called braising, is the mode of cooking meat in a succulent i gravy, and with but little liquid : braised meat, of whatever species, must always be thoroughly done. See No. 578. If.242 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. it slightly, season with salt and pepper, baste with oil, cover with parsley-leaves, and let it macerate for several hours, more or less, according to the season, so as to make the meat quite tender, which is indispensable ; set the meat after- wards on a gridiron, broil it on a moderate fire for twenty-five minutes, turn- ing and basting ; place it on a hot dish, on the bottom of which pour the follow- ing-sauce : Spanish tomata-sauce. — Cut up six tomatas, each in two parts, press out the seed, and divide them into large pieces. Put into a stewpan a sliced onion, one carrot, a clove of garlic, thyme, pepper- corns ; add two tablespoonfuls of lard, fry the ingredients, add to them the tomatas, and moisten with broth enough to cover, which reduce on a brisk fire, without touching with the spoon ; then pour the whole over a sieve, and pass the tomatas through. Put this purée into a stewpan, let it boil ; thicken with a little diluted flour, and remove it back. Cut five ounces of raw ham into small dice, heat them well with butter or lard, add four tablespoonfuls of good vinegar, and mix it up with the tomata-sauce. 566. Shoulder of mutton, stuffed. — Have a shoulder cut, as large as possible; bone it entirely, remove a part of the meat adhering to the skin, without however thinning it too much ; trim away the sinewy parts, off this meat taken out, chop it with half its weight of bacon, and half a pound of raw ham ; season the hash with salt and spices, add to it four tablespoonfuls of fine chopped onion, twice that quantity of mushrooms likewise chopped, two tablespoonfuls of parsley, and five ounces of bread-crumb, soaked in broth and well pressed ; the mince being fine, introduce into it two whole eggs, spread it on the boned shoulder; which roll into an oblong shape; sew, and place it in a stewpan, spread with sliced vegetables ; moisten to its height with wine and broth, start the liquid to ebullition, then remove the stewpan back, braising the shoulder gently for two hours and a half. When ready to serve, drain the stock of the meat, strain it into a stewpan, skim off the fat, reduce it quickly to half-glaze, and pour it over the cooked shoulder ; glaze this nicely at the entrance of the oven. Remove the string from the shoulder, which dish, and surround with a garnish of small glazed onions; add a little white wine and gravy to the cooking-stock; which reduce, and thicken with a few tablespoonfuls of tomata-sauce ; two minutes after, strain it over the shoulder. 5G7. Shoulder of mutton, with turnips. — Bone a shoulder of mutton, down to its thin end ; lard it inwardly with raw bacon, season with salt and pepper, sew the shoulder into an elongated form, and place it in a stewpan garnished with243 BUTCHER’S MEAT. - MUTTON. sliced vegetables. Break up the bones, put them all round the shoulder, moisten the meat to its height with broth; add toit a hunch of aromatics, cloves, and peppercorns ; gently braise the shoulder, turning ; when about done, reduce the moisture to half-glaze, and glaze the shoulder nicely at the entrance of the oven. Now, take the string off the shoulder, put a ruffle on the bone, and dish up with a garnish of turnips round. The shoulder is carved in transversal slices. The mutton should be served on hot plates. 5G8. Ravioles, Greek fashion. — Take some meat off a braised loin of mutton (a pound); pare away the tough parts, chop, and pound it together with a cooked sheep’s brain ; season this mince, add to it three or four tablespoonfuls of cooked fine-herbs, and two or three yolks of eggs. Roll-out, on a floured table, a pound and a quarter of biouille’-paste in a thin square flat ; moisten the paste with a paste-brush, and set on half of its surface, the prepared mince, divided into small balls, these being placed in straight rows at half an inch distance. With the remainder of the paste, cover the other part, apply it in the intervals, and then stamp out the ‘ravioles’, of a round form, with a plain round cutter. Ten minutes before serving, plunge them into salted boiling water, boil them for tln'ee or four minutes, and drain them on a sieve ; place them afterwards on a dish, by layers, each sprinkled with grated parmesan ; pour over a few spoonfuls of good gravy , thickened with tomata-sauce. 5G9. Navarin stew. — This is a dish frequently served under different names at various restaurants ; in Paris and elsewhere. Bone entirely a small leg of good mutton, cut the meat in middling-sized squares, skim the fat away, and place it in a kitchen-basin ; season with salt and spices, add to it a bunch of aromatics, pour over half a glass of madeira, and let it macerate for seven or eight hours. Drain the meat afterwards, and wipe it on a cloth. Melt six ounces of fat bacon in a stewpan ; stir it, add to it the squares of meat, and half a pound of streaky bacon, blanched and cut up in squares ; fry them over a good fire, drain then the fat off, and pour into the stewpan the madeira, in which the meats are macerated. Two minutes after, moisten to height with light brown-sauce. Cover the stewpan, cooking the stew on a moderate fire, with hot ashes on the lid. The meats being about done, skim the fat off the sauce, dilute it with a glass of white wine, and mix with a garnish of good turnips, cut in balls with a vegetable-spoon, previously colored in a frying-pan, over a sharp fire, and seasoned. Continue boiling gently: meats and turnips must be done at the same time.244 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. When ready to serve, dish the stew, the meats taking the centre, and the turnips placed all round. 570. Saddle of Ardennes-mutton, chestnut-purée. — Trim and lard both the fillets of a saddle of Welsh or Ardennes mutton, put the saddle on the spit, and let it roast, at a moderate fire, for three quarters of an hour, basting it repeatedly ; when done, take it off the spit, salt it, remove both the fillets, carving them in slices, in rather a slanting direction, letting adhere to them a small part of the fat. Cut off the sides of the saddle (les bavettes), place them on a remove-dish, forming with them a kind of support, on which dish the two carved fillets of the saddle. Serve up separately a good chestnut-purée, as well as a sauceboatful of half-glaze. 571. Mutton stew, Egyptian way. — Bone a leg of mutton; cut up the meat in large squares, which put into a kitchen-basin, season with salt, pepper, and aromatics ; pour over a glass of vinegar, and let it macerate thus for a few hours. Five hours previous to serving, drain the meats. Chop ten ounces of fat bacon, melt it in an earthen-stoekpot, add to it the meat, fry it for twenty minutes, moisten with the marinade-stock, adding a few cloves of garlic, and two bay-leaves; five minutes after, draw the stockpot on to warm ashes ; cover it with a round of paper, and a close-fitting plate ; stew the mutton gently, like beef ‘k-la-mode’. When time to serve, take up the meat carefully, dish it up, skim the fat away from the cooking-stock, to which add a few tablespoonfuls of tomata-sauce ; let it boil, and strain it over the meat. Send up separately a dish of rice la Turque’. The Turks, faithful to the law of the Prophet, replace the bacon by some sheep’s-tail fat, which in the East is used instead of butter, or lard. 572. Saddle of mutton roasted, English way (D. 86). — The saddle of mutton, strictly speaking, is that portion of the animal between the legs and the cutlets; but, in order to make it larger and more attractive, they cut the legs so short, as to make the saddle reach down to the tail, and up to the breast. If the animal be only pretty fairly grown, it will be easy to give the saddle very consider- able proportions. The English set great store by this piece ; which, when possessing all the incontestable good qualities of English mutton, becomes one of the most distinguished of removes. Choose a nice saddle, let it remain hanging for a few days ; remove the kidney, and bone the end of the ribs, folding the skirts underneath, giving the whole a neat appearance: truss the saddle up into shape; fix it solidly on the spit, and mask it with greased paper.245 BUTCHER’S MEAT. — MUTTON. Two hours previous to dinner-time, roast the saddle, at a good tire, basting with the fat of the dripping-pan. Twenty minutes before taking it off the fire, remove the paper, and let it take a nice color; draw it off the spit, dish it up, surround it with a garnish of round potatocroquettes’, small glazed carrots, and french-beans in lozenges, each of which garnishes in small groups. Send up separately a sauce- boatful of good reduced gravy, and a dish of mashed potatoes. Fig. 86. Carving. — Contrary to the general rule, in England the slices off the saddle are cut lengthwise, as indicated by the black lines in the drawing ; not too thin, and served in very hot plates, with a little of the gravy flowing from the meat. 573. Mutton stew, Persian way. — Cut up the meat of a leg of mutton in squares of an equal size, season highly, sprinkle over a sliced onion, add the juice of a few lemons, and let all macerate for two hours. Drain, and put the meat into a stewpan with fat, which fry on a brisk fire, to set; moisten with broth to three-parts its height, and boil it on a slow fire, with live embers on the lid. When the meat is about done, skim the fat off the cooking-stock, add to the stew a handful of shred almonds, dried in the oven, and a few dozen dried prunes, pre- viously boiled, and well drained. The meat being done, dish it up, and surround with the prunes and almonds ; thicken the stock with a little syrup of raisins, finish with the juice of a few lemons, and pour it over the stew. This is a dish, which assuredly will not be appreciated by every body; but it may, to a certain point, give a notion of oriental cookery. 574. Stew (ragout) of mutton, with potatoes. — Mutton-stew is a popular dish of France, and in spite of its simpleness, is really good, when carefully prepared. For its preparation, the breast and shoulder-pieces only are used, some- times both pieces together. Choose the meat rather fresh, trim the skin away, and some of the fat, if there be too much ; divide it in middling-sized squares, without boning it ; put them into a stewpan with good toppings, and not bed.ter ; set the stewpan on a brisk fire, fry the246 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. squares of meat, turning them ; season with salt, and a pinch of sugar*, add thereto a few small raw onions, and when of a nice color, drain the fat off ; sprinkle over a handful of flour, and two minutes after, moisten with a sufficient quantity of broth, to cover them ; stir the sauce until boiling, and a few minutes after, draw the stewpan on the side of the fire : the sauce should then be plentiful, and not much thickened ; add then to the stew a bunch of parsley, with aromatics. One hour after, that is, when the mutton is about three-parts done, set a sieve on a stewpan, and pour the stew thereon ; take the pieces one by one with a fork, remove the surplus of bones, place them in the stewpan with the sauce, add also the small onions ; let the stew boil, and mix with a garnish of raw potatoes, either round or long ; baste them with the sauce, season, and draw the stewpan on a moderate tire, with warm ashes on the lid : potatoes and meat should be done at the same time. When time to serve, place the meat on the centre of a dish, and set the potatoes all round. 575. Mutton-stew, Turkish fashion. — Take three pounds of mutton- fillets, which cut in middling-sized squares ; put the meat into an earthen stewpan with a lid to it, and of the shape of a vegetable-pan ; add to the meat a little clarified butter, season it, fry it for ten or twelve minutes. Now take the meat out of the stewpan, into which throw a garnish of fresh and tender vegetables, such as new carrots, small onions, french-beans, kidney-beans, green-pease, a slice of good pumpkin cut in squares ; season these vegetables, and also fry them for ten minutes. Now take the stewpan off the fire, remove the vegetables from the centre, and put the meat into the cavity formed ; close the stewpan hermetically, and thus push it into a moderate oven, cooking the meat and vegetables for an hour and a half. The stewpan taken out of the oven, drain the fat of the stew, place the stewpan on' a dish, and serve. 57f>. Crusts with calf’s kidney (D. 87). — Cut ten or twelve ‘crou- tons’ of household bread-crumb, cut them to the shape of long squares, nearly half an inch thick ; cut them round, let them fry, open them, partly empty them, and thus keep them warm. On the other hand, take a fine good calf’s kidney, remove only part of the fat surrounding it, let it roast in a stewpan, salt it, let it cool ; take off all the fat, cut the meat in small dice, which mix with an equal volume of cooked mushrooms, cut of the same shape. Reduce a little good ‘béchamel’-sauce, introducing into it the mushrooms’ cook- ing-stock, a little raw ham, and a little melted meat-glaze. The sauce being suc- * The sugar serves to soften the meat, as well as to facilitate its taking colorBUTCHER’S MEAT. — MUTTON. 247 oulent, and reduced to the degree requisite ; add to it the kidney and mushrooms, and immediately take it off the tire ; season the preparation with a little nutmeg, then till with it the hollow of the ‘croûtons’, smooth the top, sprinkle over a little ■Pig. 87. grated fresh bread-crumb ; pour over a little melted butter, glaze it by aid of the salamander. Dish the crusts on a folded napkin, and serve them immediately. 577. Saddle of mutton, German way (D. 88). — Procure a nice saddle without ribs, remove the skin and fat, re-covering the two fillets ; pare the skirt square, fold it under the saddle, and lard the two loins lengthwise, or trans- versally; salt slightly, then roast it on the spit, or in the oven, basting frequently, and keeping the meat juicy. Fig. 88. When ready to serve, drain the saddle, dish it up ; and place on each end, and on the centre, a group of round potato-‘croquettes’. Send up separately a sauce- boat of good gravy. The saddle, here represented, belongs to a sheep of English breed (South down), introduced lately to the North of Germany, where it produces specimens of a remark- able beauty. 578. Braised saddle of mutton, with soubise-purée. — Cut a saddle of mutton, like the preceding one; cut the flap (panouflc) straight on both ends; remove the kidney, as well as most part of the fat; break the back-bone atCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 248 different places, then roll the flap underneath ; bind the flesh in the manner represented by the drawing (No. 88) : see also No. 5b 1, p. 241, note. Mask the bottom of the braising-pan with minced trimmings of bacon, and vegetables ; set the saddle in the bottom, season it, moisten to nearly its height with broth ; boil the liquid on a good fire until three-parts done ; then add half a bottle of white wine, remove the braising-pan back on a moderate fire, or to the entrance of the oven, in order to braise the meat, basting it repeatedly, but adding the stock in proportion to its evaporating ; skim the fat from time to time. By this proceeding the stock will prove succulent, when the meat is done; three hours, and sometimes even more, arc required to braise a saddle of mutton ; this depends on its size, and the degree of its tenderness : the meat of braised mutton must be well done. A moment previous to serving, drain the saddle on a baking-sheet, untruss it, glaze with the paste-brush, keep it at the entrance of the oven; pass the stock through a sieve, add to it a few tablespoonfuls of madeira-wine, and a little brown- sauce, in order to thicken it; boil the sauce, skim its fat again. Remove the two fillets of the saddle, cut them transversally in slices not too thin, put the fillets back into place. Dish the saddle, garnish on both sides with good soubise-purde, glaze it, and serve the sauce up separately. 579. Sheep’s kidneys, ‘à la Vieville’. — This dish is little known, and yet is very good ; it bears the name of an emeritus epicure. Pare away the skin, and the sinewy parts, from seven or eight sheep’s kidneys, divide each of them in two, place these pieces in a frying-pan, with clarified butter, and a pinch of chopped shalôt ; and fry them quickly. When they set, season witli salt, and a little cayenne; as soon as they have reduced their moisture, drain them with a skimmer, and put them into a small kitchen-basin ; pour half a glass of ma’deira into the frying-pan, reduce the liquid to half, add an equal quantity of melted glaze, which let boil, and then thicken it with a small piece of kneaded-butter At the first bubbling, add the kidneys to the sauce, and at the same time two tahle- spoonfuls of cooked ham, cut up in small dice, and a pinch of chopped taragon; take the stew off the fire, pour it into a dish, and surround it with fried bread- ‘croûtons’, which glaze with a paste-brush. 580. Sheep’s kidneys, Oriental fashion. — Remove the skin of a dozen tine mutton-kidneys, which then mince. Let boil half a glassful of thickened gravy, or else of sauce brown or white ; thicken it with a piece of butter, kneaded with a little curry-powder ; the sauce now should be tolerably thick. Mince two or three onions in rings, fry them on a moderate fire in a pan, giving them a little color ; salt, and drain them.BUTCHER’S MEAT. — MUTTON. 249 When ready to serve, put the kidneys into a pan with butter, fry them on a brisk tire, season ; as soon as they are ready, drain them on a colander, dish them, mask with the sauce, on which spread the fried rings of onion. 581. Brochettes (skewers) of sheep’s kidneys. — Remove the skin, and sinewy fat, of a few sheep’s kidneys; split them in two, and divide each half in two pieces ; which place in a plate, season, and baste with a little oil. Cut up some thin layers of bacon, divide them into squares the size of the pieces of kidney, and run them through with small metal skewers, alternating each square with a piece of kidney; roll the skewers in some bread-crumbs, broil the ‘brochettes’ (skewers) over a brisk tire for ten minutes, turning over, and over ; send them up on a hot dish. 582. Sheep’s kidneys, Flemish way. — Put into a stewpan two table- spoonfuls of chopped onion, and shalôt, as well as a whole clove of garlic ; which fry without allowing it to take color, and add a dozen fresh middling-sized mushrooms, also chopped ; reduce their moisture quickly, season with salt, and cayenne pepper ; moisten with the third of a glass of madeira, and the same of melted glaze ; let the sauce boil, and thicken it with a small piece of kneaded-butter. On the other hand, remove the skin off eight sheep’s kidneys ; split them in two lengthwise, dividing them, and put them into a frying-pan with butter, tossing them on a brisk fire; season, and fry them until done, and free of moisture; then take them up with a skimmer, dish them, and mask them with the sauce finished at the moment. 583. Sheep’s kidneys, Colbert-sauce. — Remove the skin off eight or ten sheep’s kidneys, split them on the centre without separating the two parts, which run through, each with a small skewer, to keep them apart ; season on both sides with salt, and pepper, moisten with clarified butter by the aid of a paste-brush, and broil them on a good fire, turning. When done, remove the skewers, set them on a hot dish, mask them with ‘Colbert’-sauce, and surround with fried bread- ‘croûtons’. 584. Sheep’s kidneys, with mushrooms. — This is a household- dish, very simple, and easy to prepare ; it wants but a little care to be perfect. Get seven or eight fresh sheep’s kidneys; trim away the skin, and sinewy fat, slice them transversally. Melt five ounces of butter in a frying-pan, mix the kidneys with it ; salt, and fry them on a brisk fire, continually tossing them ; as soon as well set, gather them on one side of the pan ; which hold inclined, thus placing only the liquor of the kidneys over the fire, and allowing it to evaporate by the ebullition. When about reduced, pour it, as well as the kidneys, into a kitchen-basin: wipe the frying-250 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. pan, put into it a piece of butter, and two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion ; which fry without allowing to take color ; add to it a few fresh mushrooms, cut up in quarters; fry them quickly for a few minutes, salt slightly, and pour over half a glass of white wine, and the same of gravy ; let the mushrooms cook quickly for live or six minutes, draw the frying-pan on the side of the fire, thicken the stock with a small piece of kneaded-butter, thus obtaining a little sauce not too thick ; when of a nice relish, add to it the drained kidneys, which warm without allowing to boil ; then remove the pan back, toss the stew, and finish it by adding a pinch of parsley, a little pepper, and the juice of one lemon. Dish the kidneys, surrounding with fried bread -‘croutons’ glazed with a paste-brush. 585. Brewers’ mutton-chops. — Cut up four or five rather thick slices off the end of a saddle of mutton, but the whole breadth of it ; beat them slightly with a cutlet-bat, season with salt, and cayenne pepper, rub them with a paste-brush, dipped in melted lard ; and broil them on a moderate fire, turning ; afterwards, dish them, and mask each with a piece of butter, seasoned and mixed up with chopped shalôt, parsley, and lemon-juice. 586. Mutton-cutlets, Breton fashion. Parc ten or twelve mutton- cutlets (see No. 589), season, dip them into beaten eggs, bread-crumb, and range them, one beside the other, in a ‘sauté-pan with clarified butter, frying them on both sides for twelve minutes. On the other hand, slice seven or eight large onions, blanch them for two minutes, and fry them in a stewpan with butter; season with salt, nutmeg, and a pinch of sugar; sprinkle over a little flour, and moisten with good gravy: finish cooking them slowly, and thicken with two yolks of eggs diluted with a little cream. When the cutlets are of a nice color, dish them in a circular, and pour on the centre the garnish of onions. 587. Mutton-cutlets, with taragon. — Cut, and pare seven or eight mutton-cutlets ; season, moisten with oil, and broil them nicely. On the other hand, pour into a small stewpan two gills of good clear gravy, add to it a small bunch of taragon ; cover the stewpan, set it on the fire, and reduce the gravy to half-glaze; take off the bunch, add to the gravy a pinch of chopped taragon-leaves, dish up the cutlets, and pour the gravy over. « 588. Sheep’s ears, in croustade (D. 89). — Scald a dozen sheep’s ears; singe, and boil them, proceeding as directed in No. 699; when drained, and cooled, fill them inwardly with a layer of raw force-meat, thus supporting them in an upright position ; dip them into beaten eggs, bread-crumb, and fry them.251 BUTCHER’S MEAT. — MUTTON. On the other hand, prepare a pound and a quarter of potatoes-purée ; as soon as passed through a sieve, season ; introduce into it a piece of butter, a handful of grated parmesan, and ten yolks of eggs; pour it on a floured table, and work with the hand, gradually introducing flour enough to render firm ; place it then on a round of paper, cut-up of the size of a round dish. With this composition, prepare a Fig. 89. ‘croustade’ of a low form, making the flutings with a piece of carrot cut slantwise, and leaving a hollow in the centre of the cut. When done, egg, and push it into a hot oven, to take color. Then take it up, slip it on a dish, till the hollow with minced mushrooms, and thereon place the ears upright. Glaze them, and send apart a brown- sauce , reduced with trimmings of mushrooms. 580. Mutton-cutlets, broiled, with mashed potatoes (D. 90). — Fig. 90. Take two necks of mutton, not too fresh, pare the ribs straight, remove the back- bone, thus disengaging the meat entirely; then cut the cutlets slanting, and trans- versally, taking four or five off each of the necks, all of the same thickness; flatten them with a cutlet-bat about half an inch thick ; trim away the sinewy skin adhering252 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. to the rib-bones; disengage the top of the bones, cut them trim and neat, season, moisten with clarified butter, and broil them on a good fire, seven or eight minutes, turning them. Dish them in a circular order, fill the centre with mashed potatoes, and baste the cutlets with melted butter ‘a la maitre-d’hôtel’. These cutlets thus dished up, and garnished, may be seiwed as a remove. 590. Mutton-cutlets, with reform-sauce. — The preparation of these cutlets is, I believe, a creation of Alexis Soyer, artist, writer, and a distinguished practitioner ; whose memory will live for ever in England. Pare twelve mutton-cutlets, season, dip them into beaten eggs, and roll them into very fine chopped ox-tongue ; range them flatly in a ‘sauté’- pan with clarified butter ; fry them on both sides, dish them in a circular order, and garnish the centre with the following-sauce : Reform-sauce. — Prepare a ‘montglas’ composed in equal parts of truffles, mushrooms, lean parts of cooked ham, poached whites of eggs, and gerkins. Pour into a stewpan six tablespoonfuls of good vinegar, add a few sprigs of aro- matics, reduce the liquid one third; pour in a half-pint of brown-sauce, and five or six spoonfuls of melted glaze. Reduce the sauce a few minutes, and when sufficiently thickened, add to it two tablespoonfuls of red-currant jelly ; as soon as this is dissolved, take the sauce off the fire, introduce into it the ‘montglas’ ; which warm without allowing to boil. 591. Mutton-cutlets, Provence way. — Pare ten fine mutton-cutlets, keep the ‘noix’ rather thinner than usual ; season the cutlets, pour over them a little melted butter. Mince one or two Portugal onions, put them into a stewpan, with butter and a little salt; which let fry on a very mild fire, stirring them frequently; as soon as they are of a fine color, moisten them with a little broth, and let this broth reduce to glaze : at this time the onions ought to be done ; thicken them with four table- spoonfuls of ‘béchamel-sauce ; reduce the preparation, stirring it till it be of a good consistence ; add to it a pinch of pepper, take it off the fire, and let it cool. A quarter of an hour before serving, place the mutton-cutlets on a gridiron, let them broil, but not too much, on one side only ; turn them over, and place on the cooked surface of the ‘noix’ a small portion of the onion-preparation ; sprinkle over a little bread-crumb, moisten with a little melted butter, and place the cutlets again on the gridiron ; let them broil on the uncooked side. When they have set to the degree requisite, take them off the fire, and glaze their upper surface with the aid of a red- hot shovel or salamander. Dish the cutlets, with the bone underneath. Serve separately a boatful of good gi’avy, or else of sauce.253 BUTCHER’S MEAT. — MUTTON. 592. Braised mutton-cutlets, artichoke-purée. — Cut eight double mutton-cutlets, taken off on the centre of the necks (carrés), they must he all of equal length, and with the end-bone cut short. Transversally stud the meat, of the fiioix’ of each cutlet, with thin fillets of bacon and truffles, both of which are seasoned ; season likewise the cutlets, place them, side hy side, on the bottom of a flat stewpan, which is masked with trimming of bacon ; add to the above two small onions, and a bunch of parsley, garnished with aromatics. Mask the cutlets with bacon, moisten them to cover with plain broth, passed through a sieve, freed of its fat; let the liquid boil, cover the stewpan, remove it back on a moderate fire, cooking the cutlets carefully. Let the cutlets half cool in their own cooking-stock, take them out, range them flat on a baking-sheet, placing them side by side, and let them cool with a light weight on. Pare the cutlets to a nice shape, rounding the side of the fiioix’, place them in a little good gravy, cover them with buttered paper, and heat them at the entrance of the oven, basting them from time to time. At serving-time, dish the cutlets in a circular order, but notice with the bone underneath ; rill the hollow of the circle with artichoke-purée, pour over this purée a little glaze, serve separately a boatful of ‘espagnole’-sauce. 593. Persian Pilaw. — Cut in dice the meat of a mutton-fillet (one pound), the sinews of which have been removed. Chop an onion, put it into a stewpan, with either butter or fat, let it fry slightly; then add to it the mutton-meat, which season ; let it fry on a moderate fire, stirring it with a spoon ; season again. The meat having set well, add to it two pounds of good rice, washed and dried in the air ; moisten meat and rice, to double their height, with some good mutton-broth ; add a bunch of parsley garnished with aromatics, hoil the rice, kept covered, for twenty minutes ; then add to it a few tablespoonfuls of tomata-sauce ; keep the stewpan now on embers for ten minutes, then serve the pilaw’. (This dish is variously spelt in Europe, pilau, pilaf, pilav, and pilàff.) 594. Mutton pilaw, Tartar fashion. — Choose a square piece of mutton, with the end of the saddle adhering to it. Remove the fillet entirely off the bones, remove too its fat, as well as its sinewy parts; then cut it transversally in slices, which season with salt, pepper, spices, and a little chopped mint. Prepare a little broth with the bones and trimmings of the mutton. Wash a pound of good rice, which drain on a sieve ; then leave it to dry for full an hour. Chop an onion, fry it in butter, add to it the rice, and allow this to fry for a few moments; then moisten to three times its height with broth, the fat of which is not removed ; boil it, kept covered ; as soon as dry, remove it back on hot ashes.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 254 On the other hand, file the pieces of mutton on to little skewers, alternating every piece with a slice of bacon or ham ; this done, roll them in hot hog’s lard, and broil them on a brisk fire for eight minutes. Dish the pilaw, placing the skewers on the rice. 595. King’s Pilaw. — Take a loin of mutton, bone it, trim away the sinewy parts, and cut up the meat in middling-sized squares. Break up the bones, put them into a stockpot, with a knuckle of veal ; moisten with a sufficient quantity of broth to cover, and let the liquid boil, skimming it; draw it then on the side of the fire, add a few sliced vegetables, and a bunch of aromatics, let the meat boil gently for an hour, and strain the broth. Meanwhile, put the pieces of loin into a stewpan, with butter, five ounces of raw ham in middling-sized dice, and a bunch of aromatics ; fry the meats on a brisk fire, to give them a nice color; season, and moisten with half a pint of broth ; cover the pan, set it over a moderate fire, and reduce the moisture to a glaze ; moisten, and reduce once more ; continuing thus, until the mutton be quite done, and the stock succulent : season with a little cayenne. Twenty-five minutes previous to serving, chop a small onion, fry it in a stewpan with butter, allowing it to take color ; add then to it half a pound of rice, washed in several waters, and dried on a sieve in the air ; heat it a few minutes, stirring with a spoon ; and moisten, to three times its height, with the prepared mutton-broth. A few minutes after, cover the stewpan, which remove on to a moderate fire, to finish cooking the rice gently, without touching it. When dry, it should be tender, and the grains left whole. Take it off the fire, mix in a piece of butter in small bits; and, this being melted, add a handful of grated parmesan; turn out two thirds of the rice into a vegetable dish, make a hollow in the centre, wherein pour the stew; cover it with the remainder of the rice, smooth the top with the blade of a knife, sprinkle over a handful of grated parmesan, pour over a little melted butter, and baste it slightly with melted glaze. 590. English mutton-pie (D. 91). — Cut up in slices, not too thick, nor too large, the thickest fleshy part of a leg of mutton, or a loin (about a pound and half) ; trim away the bones, and sinewy skin, slightly beat the slices, and season with salt and pepper. Arrange, on the bottom of a pie-dish, a layer of these slices, and thereon put a layer of raw potatoes, cut and seasoned with salt and pepper; continue filling the dish, alternating the meat and the potatoes; pour over it a gill of good cold gravy, moisten the rim of the dish all round, and apply to it a thin strip of half puff- paste of the same size ; moisten this likewise, and cover meat and dish, to the rim,255 BUTCHER’S MEAT. — MUTTON. with a flat of the same paste; apply it without drawing, and cut out the surplus, holding the knife a little to the outside ; then channel it all round with the back of the knife, pressing the paste with the thumb : adorn the top with a scroll of imitated leaves in paste, make a hole on the centre of it; egg the pie, and bake it in a moderate oven for an hour and a quarter, being careful to cover the paste with Fig. 91. paper, as soon as it takes color. When done, place the pie on a dish covered with a napkin. 597. Sheep’s tails, with olives. — Pare away the thin part of eight or ten sheep’s tails, previously blanched; put them into a stewpan, with good butter or lard, two small onions, and a piece of carrot; set the pan on the fire, fry them, con- tinually tossing; season, and, when of a nice color, sprinkle over two spoonfuls of flour. Moisten to cover, with a little hot broth, gravy, and white wine ; start the liquid to ebullition ; and, two minutes after, remove the pan back. If the sauce appear too pale, color it with a few drops of ‘caramel’. When the tails are done, strain the sauce into another stewpan, skim off the fat, and add to it a quarter of a glass of white wine, working it until sufficiently thickened ; then pare the tails neatly, and add them to the sauce. Two minutes after, take the stewpan off the fire, throw into the ‘ragout’ a garnish of large olives, and serve up on a hot dish. 598. Sheep’s ears ‘au blanc’. — Boil fifteen sheep’s ears (see No. G'JO) ; drain them round the auricle, place them in a stewpan, and keep them covered. On the other hand, put into a stewpan, a piece of butter and two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion; which fry, without allowing to take color; add to it two table- spoonfuls of flour, fry it for two minutes, and moisten, by degrees, with a pint and a half of broth ; stir the liquid until boiling, add a bunch of parsley, and a handful of trimmings of mushrooms, draw the stewpan on one side, to boil the sauce for a quarter of an hour ; skim off the fat, and pass it through a sieve. Then mix it with two dozen mushrooms in quarters, and reduce it on a brisk fire. Eight or ten minutes25Ü COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. after, put the ears in, place the stewpan on a moderate fire ; let the stew boil for a few minutes, thicken with three diluted yolks of eggs, cook the liaison without letting it boil ; and finish the sauce with a little chopped parsley, and the juice of one lemon. (199. Sheep’s ears, ‘à la bouchère’. — Soak fifteen sheep’s ears; scald them until boiling; drain, run them through, with a skewer to singe them ; refresh, and wipe them on a cloth, being particularly careful to remove the hairs inside; place the ears in a stewpan with one onion, one carrot, a few sprigs of aromatics, salt, cloves, and peppercorns ; sprinkle over a pinch of flour, moisten with a suffi- cient quantity of water to cover, let the liquid boil, and finish cooking the ears on the side of the fire; let them cool in their own stock, drain, wipe, and pick out the inner membranes by the aid of a tin-cutter. Prepare a ‘salpicon’ composed of sheep’s brains, mushrooms, and pickled ox- tongue; thicken it with two tablespoonfuls of raw force-meat, and a small quantity of reduced white- or brown-sauce ; with this preparation, stuff the ears; flour, dip them into beaten eggs, and bread-crumb. When ready to serve, plunge them into hot dripping-fat, to fry to a nice color; drain, and dish them up on a napkin. COO. Cassolet of Castelnaudary. — The ‘cassolet’ is a popular dish of Languedoc in France ; the tower of Castelnaudary, the name of which it bears, is cer- tainly not now the place, where it is best appreciated ; but in general it is well pre- pared in all parts of the country. Steep for a few hours, a pound of good dry haricot-beans; put them into a stewpan with water, set the pan on the fire ; at the first bubbling, remove it entirely off the fire ; cover, and keep the beans thus for one hour. Change the water, put the stewpan back over the fire, salt the beans, let the water boil again gently, boiling the beans until three-parts done; then drain them on a sieve : let me recommend this method of boiling the beans, as the most practical one, and as giving the best result. Put into an iron or enameled stewpan, of a wide and low form, a preserved (confite) leg and wing of goose; add six ounces of its fat; fry them on a moderate fire, turning ; when well done, add the beans, and a small saveloy. On the other hand, slice one or two large onions, put them into a stewpan with two cloves of garlic, and some chopped bacon, to fry ; sprinkle over a pinch of flour, and dilute with a quart of hot broth ; stir the sauce till boiling, add two sprigs of aromatics, and a few spoonfuls of tomata-sauce, or simply a chopped tomata : reduce the sauce quickly for a few minutes, and pour it over the beans ; then push them into a slow oven, simmering the stew until meats and beans be about done.257 BUTCHER’S MEAT. — MUTTON. At this point, sprinkle over the ‘cassolet’ a pinch of bread-crumbs and chopped parsley, keep the pan at the entrance of the oven, till the surface be nicely colored, and slightly gratinated: serve the ‘cassolet’ in the dish, wherein it has been cooked. C01. Sheep’s tongues, ‘à la macédoine’ (D. 92). — Get a dozen sheep’s tongues; scald, and trim their skin away, and place them regularly in a stewpan, spread with bacon and sliced vegetables; braise, short of moisture, and Fig. 92. when done, put them in press between two baking-sheets : afterwards trim them neatly, and heat them at the entrance of the oven, glazing with their own liquor. On the other hand, prepare some potato-purée, as for a ‘croustade’, arrange it on a dish in form of a border; let it dry in the oven, and dish the tongues all round, upright, the pointed end downwards ; glaze them with a paste-brush, and keep the dish at the entrance of the oven, allowing the potatoes to set. When ready to serve, garnish the centre with a ‘macédoine’ of vegetables thickened with ‘béchamel’-sauce, baste with melted glaze, and pour on the bottom of the dish a little brown-sauce, reduced with wine. G02. Small patties, Nîmes fashion. — Take the meat off a loin of mutton (a pound); pare, cut it in scollops, which fry on a brisk fire, with a few chickens’ livers : season the meats, let them cool, chop, and pound them in a mortar, with half their volume of fat bacon, likewise chopped; pass the prepai’ation, through a sieve, put it into a kitchen-basin, add to it two tablespoonfuls of cooked fine- herbs, and two tablespoonfuls of raw chopped truffles. Take a pound and a quarter of puff-paste of six turns (see No. 403) ; roll it out thin, and stamp out of it two dozen small round flats, two inches in diameter. Gather up the trimmings, roll them out in a flat a little thinner than the former one, and stamp two dozen rounds with the same cutter. Set these rounds on a moistened thin baking-sheet, place on the centre of each a small part of the preparation ; moisten the edges of the paste, and cover with the first rounds ; applying them with 17258 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. the fingers, then with the back of a cutter of smaller size. Egg the top, and hake them in a hot oven, for a quarter of an hour ; when done, dish them up on a folded napkin, and serve quite hot immediately. 603. Sheep’s tongues, Breton fashion. — Boil in salted water, or in broth, four or five fresh sheep’s tongues ; let them cool under press ; remove the skin, and cut them into middling-sized dice; mix these in a stewpan, with two cooked sheep’s brains, in dice, and keep the pan covered. Slice two dozen large fresh mushrooms, put them into a stewpan with butter, which salt, and fry; when they have evaporated their moisture, sprinkle a little flour over, and moisten with gravy, keeping the sauce a little consistent, season with salt and pepper; add a pinch of chopped parsley. When the mushrooms are done, add the tongues and brains, pour the stew on a dish, smoothing its surface with the blade of a knife, sprinkle over bread-crumbs, and let it be nicely colored in the oven, or with a red hot salamander. 604. Sheep’s tongues, with oranges. — Boil in water ten small pickled sheep’s tongues ; trim the skin away, and glaze them with a little gravy ; dilute the cooking-stock with a little broth ; let it boil, and pass it through a sieve. Pour a gill of vinegar into a stewpan, reduce it to half, and mix it with the cooking-stock of the tongues, start it to ebullition, and thicken with potato-flour; a few minutes after, add to it two tablespoonfuls of red-currant jelly ; remove the sauce back, to clarify. Meanwhile, peel thoroughly four sour oranges, which cut into small quarters, carefully removing peel and pips. When the sauce is freed of fat, take it off the fire, and throw in the oranges ; then dish the tongues, with the oranges round, pour the sauce over. 605. Sheep’s brains, with hot ‘rémoulade’. — Put four or five sheep’s brains into a basin of cold water ; remove the skin covering them, and steep them in cold water, for one hour, changing the water. Boil some water in a stewpan, with salt, sliced vegetables, a bunch of parsley, and a quarter of a glass of vinegar, or white wine; a few minutes after add the brains, which boil for ten minutes, drain, dish them up, and mask them with the following sauce : Hot ‘rémoulade’- sauce. — Put into a stewpan two or three tablespoonfuls of chopped shalôt, a clove of garlic, and a quarter of a glass of vinegar ; reduce the liquid to half. Put into a mortar six boiled yolks of eggs, and the fillets of four or five ancho- vies, well cleansed ; pound them together, dilute the preparation with a gill of stiff and hot ‘velouté’-sauce, then with a gill of oil, stirring ; add to it a tablespoonful of taragon-leaves, the same of chive, burnet, parsley, and chervil, all of which choppedMUTTON. 259 BUTCHER’S MEAT. and pounded ; season with a little salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Remove the sauce off’ the fire, as soon as hot, and add to it two tablespoonfuls of good mustard, previously diluted with a little sauce. GOG. Sheep’s tongues, with purée of lentils. — Get ten fresh sheep’s tongues, steep them in cold water, put them into a stewpan with cold water, and blanch until boiling; trim them, removing the root, place them one beside the other, in a flat stewpan, with sliced vegetables; salt slightly, and moisten to height with gravy. Let the liquid boil, and reduce it one fourth ; cover the stewpan, remove it hack, cooking the tongues for two hours, turning; drain them afterwards, remove the skin covering them, put them again into the stewpan, with their cooking-stock strained, and reduced to half-glaze ; glaze them nicely at the entrance of the oven ; dish them up, reclining against a purée of lentils, arranged in pyramids, on the centre of a hot dish. Add to the cooking-stock four tablespoonfuls of white wine, let it boil for two minutes, and pour it over the tongues. C07. Sheep’s ‘animelles’ fried. — The ‘animelles’ are only found in male sheep, that have not undergone castration, accordingly in rams; little known in France, and England, the ‘animelles’ are very plentiful on the markets of Italy, at Naples, and in Rome. Choose seven or eight fresh ‘animelles’, remove the skin that covers them; cut each of them in four parts lengthwise; put them into a kitchen-basin, sprinkle over salt, and let them macerate for ten minutes ; when they have delivered up their moisture, flour them, taking small quantities at one time, and plunge them into very hot drippings ; as soon as set inwardly, and hard to the touch, drain them on a cloth over some salt, and dish them up, on a folded napkin, with fried parsley. G08. Sausage ‘à la Persane’. — Pare the meat of a loin of mutton, chop it with an equal quantity of sheep’s-tail fat, or bacon ; when the farce is fine, season, and divide it into parts, the size of an egg ; roll them round a small iron-skewer, shaping the sausages in a round elongated form : the skewer should be exactly on the centre of each, these being run through one after the other. Roast these sausages Neapolitan fashion, that is, with coal on both sides ; turning the skewer with the > hand. When done, dish them up carefully, without breaking them, and surround with slices of celery. G09. Persian Kebâb. — Cut up, in squares, the meat of a loin of mutton ; place them in an earthen pan, mixing an equal number of thick slices of sheep’s-tail- [ fat; season with salt and pepper, sprinkle over some sliced onion, and add the juice of a few lemons ; after which allow them to macerate for a few hours. Then run the 17*260 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. squares of mutton through with a skewer, alternating each with a square of fat, and fresh mint, basil, and bay-leaves. Roast the meats Naples-fashion. When done, take them out on a hot dish, and surround with slices of celery. 610. Roast mutton (shaslii-kebassi), Turkish fashion. — ‘Shashi- kebassi’ means, roast of the street. Cut up, in large squares, the meat of a leg or loin of mutton ; season with salt and pepper, baste with juice of onion, run the squares through, with long skewers, and broil them on a slow fire. Remove the skewers, place the meat on a dish, and pour over some yaour (sour cream). Gil. Minion-fillets of mutton, ‘au chasseur’. — In kitchens, where many saddles of mutton are used, the largest of the minion-fillets should be put by, as they will always prove useful. Pare twelve minion-fillets, trimming away the skin ; beat them with a cutlet-bat, as for cutlets ; cut them in a ‘demi-cœur’-shape, and let them steep for twenty-four hours in a cooked marinade ; drain and lard the fillets with rows of fine cut bacon ; range them one beside the other, in a flat stew- pan ; moisten to their height with broth, and a little marinade, and start the liquid quickly to ebullition, reducing it half ; draw the stewpan then on a moderate fire, and finish cooking the fillets, with hot ashes on the lid; when ready to serve, dish them up in a circle, dilute their stock with a little broth, reduce it one third, thicken with a little brown-sauce, and strain it over the fillets. 612. English mutton-pudding. — Divide in slices, of the thickness of a mutton-cutlet, three or four breasts of mutton ; take the bones away, separate the meat from the fat, and season writh salt and pepper. Put into a stewpan two or three tablespoonfuls of shalôt and onion (chopped), fry them slightly with butter, add the slices of mutton, which toss quickly during several minutes, then as quickly with- draw them with a fork, and place them in a dish, leaving the fat in the stewpan. Mix in this a small handful of flour, fry it a while, stirring; dilute with two gills of gravy, thus obtaining a light sauce; let it boil, and take it off the fire ; introduce into it a spoonful of ‘Harvey-sauce’, a little pepper, and pour it over the slices of mutton. Line a pudding-mould with suet-paste (see No. 396); arrange the meat in the hollow, basting with the sauce, cover the top with a round of paste, over which fold the paste of the rim to the height of the mould. Moisten the centre of a napkin, butter, and flour it ; cover the mould with it, applying the floured part on the paste, tie the napkin fast underneath the mould with string, and plunge the mould into boiling water, cooking the pudding for two hours. Unpack it afterwards, turn it out on a dish, and glaze it with a paste-brush.BUTCHER’S MEAT. — MUTTON. 261 613. Carbonnades* of mutton, glazed (D. 93). — Get four ‘carbon- nades’ of mutton, cut each of them in two, removing the bone between the lesser fillet and the larger one, but without taking the minion-fillet out, trim away the fat, re-covering the loins ; which lard with bacon, fold the skirt under, secure it with string, and place the ‘carbonnades’ in a stewpan strewn with sliced vegetables, Fig. 93. cloves, peppercorns, and aromatics. Salt slightly, moisten with a glass of broth ; set the stewpan on a brisk fire, and reduce the moisture to a glaze ; moisten the meat again to its height with broth and white wine, let the stock boil quickly five or six minutes, then put the pan over a moderate fire ; cover it, and braise the ‘carbonnades’, basting often with their own stock. At last, glaze them nicely, remove the string, dish up, and baste them with their own stock, mixed-up with a little tomata-sauce. 614. Mutton-cutlets,‘à la macédoine’(D. 94). — Mutton-cutlets, if Fig. 94. nicely pared, of equal size, broiled to a nicety, constitute an entrée, which, in spite of its simplicity, may appear at any dinner ; but on the condition, that the meat be tender, delicate, and succulent. Pare fourteen mutton-cutlets all of equal length ; season them ; dip into melted buttci’, broil them at a moderate fire, turning them. As soon as taken off the fire, put ruffles to the bones, range the cutlets in a circle on a round dish. Place in the middle a ‘macédoine’ of tender vegetables of vai’ious shades and sorts, thickened * The name of ‘carbonnades’ is given to the end of the nock of mutton, from the point, where the cutlets end, and where the loin begins.262 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. with a little good ‘béchamel’-sauce, reduced with a little glaze. Serve separately a sauceboatful of half-glaze. 615. Carbonnades of mutton, with cream. — Procure three loins (carbonnades) of mutton, saw off the spine-bone, trim away the skin, and the fat lying on the minion-fillet ; fold the skirt under, secure them well in shape with wooden skewers, and place them on the bottom of a stewpan, spread with sliced vegetables, cloves, peppercorns, and aromatics; moisten with a sufficient quantity of broth to cover; let the stock boil quickly, for seven or eight minutes; then remove the stewpan on a moderate fire ; cover the meat with paper, and finish cooking it gently, with warm ashes on the lid, basting and turning from time to time. Drain them after- wards, take out the bone placed between the minion-fillet and the loin ; let the ‘car- bonnades’ cool, between two dishes, and divide each of them in two. Take them then one by one, trim them square, pare away all the fat adhering to the larger fillet ; then roll the ‘carbonnades’ in a good ‘béchamel’-sauce, reduced with the cook- ing of the meat, masking them all over. Range them flatly on a baking-sheet, allowing the sauce to cool. Half an hour after, dip the ‘carbonnades’ into a mixture of clarified butter and beaten eggs, roll them in fresh bread crumbs, set them in a buttered ‘sauté-pan, baste them with a paste-brush dipped in clarified butter, give them color in a moderate oven. When quite hot, dish them up, round a purée of turnips. 616. Sheep’s feet ‘à la vinaigrette’. — Though sheep’s feet, or trotters, as they are called, are eaten in France and in England, yet they are no where duly estimated, but in France ; this is a great mistake; for many products are eaten else- where, not possessing half their gastronomic value. This cheap and wholesome disli is indeed very good, Avhen prepared with care. In France sheep’s feet are generally sold quite ready for cooking ; but if one is obliged to cleanse them oneself, it will suffice to scald, and scrape them with a knife, removing the bristles. The sole of the hoof is removed, by knocking it with the back of a knife: the feet must be soaked for several hours, previous to cooking them. Get two dozen sheep’s feet, split their hoof in two, in order to remove a woolly tuft to be found there ; trim away the extremities. Tie the feet together four by four, scald them till ebullition, then drain, steep in cold water, and place them in a stewpan ; cover them with cold water, add salt, cloves, peppercorns, a bunch of parsley and aromatics, a few whole vegetables, and at last, a tablespoonful of flour, diluted with cold water. Let the liquid boil, covered, over a slow fire, for five hours at least. When ready to serve, drain the feet, remove the string, take away the shank- bone, without tearing the surrounding meat; trim, put them into a dish, and season263 BUTCHER'S MEAT. — LAMB. with salt, pepper, and chopped parsley. One hour after, dip them into melted butter, mixed up with a few yolks of eggs; roll them in fresh bread-crumbs, set on a gridiron, and broil them on a moderate tire, for a quarter of an hour, turning and basting with butter ; then dish them, and send up separately some Tartar-sauce. 617. Sheep’s feet, ‘à la poulette’. — Boil two dozen sheep’s feet (see No. 616), drain them on a sieve, take off the shank-bone ; place them in a stew- pan, and keep covered. Ery in butter two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion ; when of a nice color, sprinkle over two tablespoonfuls of flour ; which fry, stirring with a spoon. Dilute the paste with about a quart of hot broth, stir it on the lire until boiling, and add to the sauce a bunch of parsley, and a few trimmings of raw mushrooms ; then remove it back, and boil for a quarter of an hour, letting it boil but partly ; skim off the fat, and pass it, through a sieve, over the sheep’s feet in the stewpan. Add to the stew three dozen small mushrooms, and a pinch of pepper ; let them simmer on a slow fire for twelve or fifteen minutes, and thicken with a ‘liaison’ of three diluted yolks of eggs; finish with five ounces of good butter in small bits, a pinch of chopped parsley, and the juice of one lemon. In Provence a point of garlic is added to the sauce before thickening it : this addition giving it a higher relish. 618. Lamb-cutlets ‘sautées’, with mushroom-purée (D. 95). — Get three necks of lamb, trim the superficial skin, re-covering them, and cut from Fig. 95. each, slantwise, five nice cutlets. Cut off the piece of back-bone, trim away the sinew from end and sides; beat the cutlets slightly with a cutlet-bat, trim them neatly, salt, and range them one beside the other, in a flat stewpan, with hot clarified butter. Set the stewpan on a brisk fire, fry the cutlets for twelve minutes,COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 264 baste with two or three tablespoonfuls of melted glaze, reduce the moisture to glaze, and glaze the cutlets ; put a ruffle on each bone, and dish them up in a circle, on a border of potatoes, poached, and turned out on a dish. Fill the centre with a mushroom-purée, surround the base with a chain of little musrhooms. 619. Lamb-cutlets, ‘à la bouchère’. — Pare fifteen lamb-cutlets (see No. 418), season, roll them in clarified butter, and bread-crumb. Ten minutes previous to serving, set two cutlets on a gridiron, and broil them on both sides on a good fire. When done, glaze them with a paste-brush, and put a ruffle on each bone. On the other hand, cut four or five large gerkins in ‘montglas’, I mean as a large ‘julienne’; place them in a stewpan, add double their volume of cooked mushrooms, the same of ox-tongue, and lamb’s liver, all of which in ‘montglas’. Thicken these garnishes with four tablespoonfuls of brown-sauce, worked with a little glaze, and finished with a little cayenne. Warm the ‘montglas’ without allowing it to boil. When ready to serve, dish up the cutlets in a circular order, pour the ‘mont- glas’ in the centre. 620. Lamb-cutlets, with pease. — Pare twelve cutlets ; season, dip them into beaten eggs, to bread-crumb; place them in a stewpan with clarified butter, and fry them nicely on both sides ; then dish them up in a circle. Boil quickly half a quart of green-pease in salted water ; drain, put them into a stewpan with five ounces of good butter, season with a point of nutmeg, and a little sugar; toss them (off the fire) until the butter be quite melted, and fill with it the centre of the cutlets. 621. ‘Crepinettes’ of lamb-cutlets. — Pare a dozen lamb-cutlets, keeping the rib-bone short; beat, season, and range them in aflat stewpan with clarified butter, to fry over a brisk fire, turning. When three-parts done, add to them four tablespoonfuls of cooked fine-herbs, and the same of raw truffles in dice; then moisten with a few spoonfuls of madeira, which reduce to a glaze ; remove the stewpan back, take up the cutlets on a dish, and then add to the fine-herbs half their volume of cooked force-meat (see No. 521). On the other hand, steep a piece of pig’s caul {crépine), spread it on a cloth, and divide it into squares, in which wrap up the cutlets, masking them on both sides with a part of the fine-herbs preparation ; fold the pig’s caul over the cutlets, enclosing them entirely; this done, butter, bread-crumb, and broil them on both sides, on a moderate fire ; dish them up, and pour on the bottom of the dish a little ‘Perigueux’- sauce.BUTCHER'S MEAT. — LAMB. 265 622. Breasts of lamb, broiled. — Get two good breasts of lamb, remove the skin and sinew ; boil them in the stockpot, or in some fat broth ; when done, drain them, take away the rib-bones, and let them cool under a light weight; pare them afterwards on both sides, season with salt and pepper, moisten with melted butter; bread-crumb, and broil them on both sides for fifteen minutes. Dish them up, and accompany by a boatful of hot ‘ravigote’- sauce (see No. 486). 623. Shoulders of lamb, in duck-like form (D. 96). — Get three Fig. 96. shoulders of lamb, leaving a part of the leg adhering ; bone them without removing the thin-end bone, and season inwardly. Prepare some ‘quenelle’ force-meat with some lamb or veal meat, in the same proportions as for veal ‘quenelle’; when passed through a sieve, add half its volume of ‘salpicon’ composed of cooked ham, lamb-sweetbreads, and mushrooms. With this preparation stuff the shoulders, sew them to an oblong form, truss with the thin-end bone upright, shaping them to the shape of a duck : the shoulder of lamb lending itself by nature to this imitation. Place them afterwards in a stewpan, in the same way they are to be served; moisten to cover with tepid water, warm until the skin be set; then drain the shoulders, steep them in cold water, wipe, and lard, on both sides, the part standing for the body of the duck. The meats being larded, surround the neck, or rather the thin-end bone of the shoulders, with layers of bacon, put them into the bottom of a stewpan, prepared as for braise, support them with large vegetables, and moisten to height with good broth. Let them boil quickly for ten minutes, then remove the pan back; cover them with buttered paper, and finish braising them with hot ashes on the lid, basting frequently. At last, glaze them to a nice color ; drain them, remove the string, and cut them slightly underneath, thus giving them the required ‘aplomb’. Pare the top of the bone, imitate the eyes with a round of tongue, or of ham ; dish up, and surround with a garnish of mushrooms and olive. Dilute their stock with a little wine ; let it boil,266 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. strain, skim off the fat, add to it the liquor of the mushrooms, and reduce to half; thicken it then with a little brown-sauce. With this sauce, mask the bottom of the dish, and send the surplus in a sauceboat. 624. Shoulders of lamb, Italian way. — Bone two nice shoulders of lamb, without removing the thin-end bone; which saw below the juncture of the leg; spread the shoulders on the table, and season inwardly. Chop ten ounces of streaky bacon, mix with it two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion, four tablespoonfuls of mushrooms, and a little parsley, likewise chopped ; then two handfuls of bread-crumb, soaked and well pressed; season the preparation highly, and when well mixed up, introduce into it two whole eggs; divide the raw mince into two parts, with which stuff the shoulders ; sew them up, place them in a ‘saute’-pan, spread with sliced vegetables ; moisten half their height with broth ; let the liquid boil, and push the ‘sauté’-pan to the entrance of the oven. Braise the shoulders, basting frequently. When done, their stock should be reduced to half- glaze. Remove the string, and dish them up ; pour on the bottom of the dish a little tomata-sauce, finished with the cooking-stock. 625. Lamb ‘sauté’, with tomatas. — Take a saddle of lamb, divide it into middling-sized squares, remove part of the bones, and put the meat into a flat stewpan, with butter, one onion, and a clove of garlic not peeled; season, and fry them, continuing to toss, until they are about done. On the other hand, cut four tomatas through the centre, prick the seed out, divide them into large pieces ; which fry over a brisk fire, in a frying-pan with oil ; season, and toss them, until they have reduced their moisture ; then add them to the lamb, and ten minutes after, dish up, after having removed the garlic and the onion. 626. ‘Croquettes’ of lamb, with artichokes. — Take a piece of cooked and cold leg of lamb, pare away the sinewy skin, and cut it up in small dice; to which add half their volume of cooked artichokes’ bottoms, also in dice. Pour a few spoonfuls of good ‘bechamel’-sauce into a stewpan ; reduce it on the fire, and introduce into it a few spoonfuls of good cream, and afterwards a few spoonfuls of melted glaze : when of a nice consistence, and succulent, take it off the fire, and mix it with the prepared ‘salpicon’. Season the preparation with a little salt and nutmeg; spread it on a baking-sheet in a layer half an inch thick, and let it thoroughly cool. Shape the ‘croquettes’ afterwards in a cork-like form, roll them in bread-crumb, which dip into beaten eggs, bread-crumb, and fry them to a nice color ; drain, and dish them on a folded napkin. 627. Pilau of iamb, Greek fashion. — Bone a leg of lamb, and cut up the meat into pieces of a square form. With the bones prepare a little broth.BUTCHER’S MEAT. — LAMB. 267 Meanwhile put into a stewpan two tablospoonfuls of chopped onion, and half a pound of streaky bacon in squares ; fry them for a few minutes, and add the pieces of lamb ; salt them slightly, fry them over a brisk tire for eight or ten minutes, moisten a little above their height, with the previously prepared lamb-broth, passed through a sieve; add to it two pimentoes, and two thoroughly ripe tomatas (these without skin or seed, and chopped), a bunch of parsley with aromatics, and a point of saffron ; let the liquid boil quickly for three or four minutes, and throw in a pound of good rice (to four pounds of meat) washed and well drained ; then cover the stewpan, and live minutes after, draw it on warm ashes, with live embers on its lid ; or else set it at the entrance of the oven. Eighteen or twenty minutes later, the rice should be quite done, and its grains left whole ; then dish up the pilau. 628. ‘Blanquette’ (white fricassée) of lamb. — Cut up two shoul- ders of lamb in middling-sized squares ; let them soak in water for one hour, place them in a stewpan, and moisten to height with water, or broth, and half a glass of white wine ; let the liquid boil ; two minutes after, drain the squares of meat in a colander, preserving their broth; refresh them, pare the bones away, as much as possible, and dry them on a cloth ; let the broth settle. Fry with butter, in a stewpan, two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion ; when of a light brown color, mix the meat with it, and fry them together, for a few minutes; season slightly, sprinkle over a handful of flour, and moisten (to height, and by degrees), with the broth kept; add a bunch of parsley, a bay-leaf, a handful of trim- mings of mushrooms, cloves and peppercorns. Let the ‘blanquette’ boil quickly for ten minutes, thus reducing the sauce one fourth ; remove the stewpan on a moderate fire, to finish cooking the meat ; skim the fat off the sauce, thicken with three diluted yolks of eggs, and cook the liaison without ebullition ; add a point of nutmeg, take up the meat with a fork on a dish, sprinkle over a little chopped parsley, and strain the sauce over the meats. 629. English hot lamb-pie. —- Take both sides of the loin of lamb, and bone them entirely ; cut up the meat in slices, which pare and season. Mask the bottom of a pie-dish with slices of raw ham, or of streaky bacon ; sprinkle over a pinch of cayenne, and place thereon the slices of lamb ; arrange on the top of these, some halves of hard-boiled eggs, and moisten the meat, half its height, with good cold gravy ; finish the pie, by covering meat and dish to the rim, with short-paste or trimmings of puff-paste, proceeding as said in No. 596 ; set the dish on a small baking-sheet, and push it into the oven ; ten minutes after, cover the pie with paper, and one hour later, take it out of the oven, and sei’vc on a dish.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 268 630. Cold lamb-pie. — Prepare some short-paste (see No. 196), with a pound and a quarter of flour, half a pound of butter, a grain of salt, two yolks of eggs, and sufficient water ; and allow the paste to rest for one hour. Bone two necks of lamb, trim away the sinewy parts of the meat, and divide it into oblong squares, an inch thick ; which place in a kitchen-basin, add a quarter of their volume of blanched bacon in squares, and the same of cooked ham, cut like- wise ; season the meats with salt and good spices, baste with a few tablespoonfuls of madeira, let the meats macerate for one hour. Meanwhile, take the meat from two shoulders of lamb, pare and chop it. Chop an equal quantity of fresh bacon, add it to the shoulders’ meat, and chop all together, until very fine; season the force-meat with salt and good spices, pound it for five minutes, and put it into a kitchen-basin. Take three parts of the prepared paste, roll it out in an oblong-square flat, and set it on a baking-sheet ; mask the centre with a thick layer of force-meat, and thereon place lengthwise a layer of fillets of lamb, bacon, and ham, well mixed up ; cover the meats with another thin layer of force-meat, and continue thus garnishing the pie in a dome-like fashion. Cover with the remainder of the force-meat, fold over it the four edges of the flat ; moisten the paste, and put over it a flat of puff-paste; egg it, score it with the point of a small knife, and push the pie into the oven; ten minutes after, cover it with paper, and bake it for an hour and a half. A quarter of an hour after its being removed from the oven, introduce into the pie, through the opening left on the top, two glassfuls of cold, liquid aspic-jelly. 631. Lambs’ tongues, Breton fashion. — Steep, and scald, about fifteen lambs’ tongues; trim, refresh, and boil them with broth, or in the stock-pot, for half an hour; then drain them, remove the white skin surrounding them, place them, one beside the other, in a stewpan, spread with sliced vegetables; moisten, to three parts their height, with a little madeira and broth ; let the liquid boil up, and finish cooking, glazing them nicely. While cooking, mince seven or eight white onions, fry them with butter or lard, stirring often; when of a nice color, season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar; sprinkle over a tablespoonful of flour, and moisten with half a pint of hot milk; let them boil, stirring; add a bunch of parsley, and boil them till of a nice consistence. Then remove the bunch, season with a little nutmeg, and thicken tlie sauce with two yolks of eggs, diluted with cream. When ready to serve, dish up the tongues in a circular order, and pour the onions in the centre. 632. Lamb-sweetbreads, in scollop-shells. — Cut in dice fifteen lamb-sweetbreads, not over-done, but cold; mix with them a third their volume ofBUTCHER’S MEAT. — LAMB 2(1!) cooked mushrooms, and keep the ‘salpicon’ covered. Pour into a stewpan a few spoonfuls of good ‘béchamel’- sauce ; reduce it, introducing into it, by degrees, the stock of the sweetbreads, a little reduced, so obtaining a brown-sauce ; which, when of a nice thickness and succulent, add to the ‘salpicon’. Take now the preparation off the fire, and proceed, filling some large table-scollopshells ; smooth their top, sprinkle over bread-crumbs, pour over a little melted butter, and let them be grati- nated in a hot oven, or with the red-hot salamander. Dish, and send them up. 633. ‘Timbale’ of lamb-sweetbreads, in shells (D. 97). — Butter a ‘timbale’-mould ; line it, shell-fashion, that is, with rounds of short-paste set up ‘à cheval’ ; mask the bottom, and the sides, with a thin layer of veal ‘godiveau’ with chives (see No. 541) ; mix with some of the same force-meat a third of its volume of cooked fine-herbs, and a few spoonfuls of lean cooked ham in fine dice. Get twenty lamb-sweetbreads ; trim them, scald slightly, fry them quickly with melted fat-bacon, season, and two minutes after, take them off the fire to cool. Arrange them afterwards in the ‘timbale’, by layers ; which alternate with the pre- pared force-meat; cover the top, first with force-meat, and then with a round of paste, which solder to the side. Set the ‘timbale’ on a baking-sheet, push it into a moderate oven; one hour after, take it out, and turn it out on a hot dish; make a round opening on the top of the ‘timbale’, and range in the hollow, a small ‘ragout’ composed of cocks’- combs and truffles. Baste the ‘ragout’ with a little brown-sauce, reduced with a few spoonfuls of madeira ; serve immediately. 034. Lamb-sweetbreads, with green-pease-purée. — Get a dozen of nice lamb-sweetbreads, scald them, settling the flesh ; steep them in cold water, wipe, and put them in press between two dishes ; trim them, lard them closely with fine bacon on their smoothest side, then range them in a stewpan, spread with sliced vegetables ; moisten to height with good broth, salt slightly, cover them with buttered paper, and set the stewpan over a brisk fire, inducing the moisture to half-glaze;270 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. remove the pan immediately over a moderate fire, take the paper off, put live embers on its lid, and glaze the sweetbreads nicely, hasting frequently with their own stock; drain them afterwards, and arrange them round a green-pease-purée, kept a little firm, and placed on the centre of a dish. Pour over the sweetbreads’ stock, strained and skimmed of fat. 635. Stew of lamb, with green-pease. — Cut up two shoulders of lamb into middling-sized squares ; which put into a stewpan with butter, two or three small onions, one carrot, and a bunch of parsley ; set the stewpan on the fire, to fry and color the meat ; season, and let it half-cook ; add to it three parts of a quart of green-pease, and half a pound of bacon in squares; place some live embers on the lid of the stewpan, and finish cooking the stew gently: meat and pease should he done at the same time. When ready to serve, thicken the stew with a little piece of kneaded-butter, and dish it, after having removed the bunch. 636. Stew of Lamb, Spanish fashion. — Cut up a shoulder and a breast of lamb in square pieces ; which put into a shallow stewpan with lard, fry them quickly ; then, when of a nice color, add a few tender artichokes, pared and cut up in quarters, about fifteen small onions, and as many small carrots; fry them a few minutes, season with salt and pepper, moisten with a little broth, which reduce to a glaze ; then add two tomatas in pieces, free of seed, and a small sprig of mint; when the moisture of the tomatas is evaporated, the lamb should be done ; pour into the stew a few spoonfuls of brown-sauce, and two minutes after, dish it up. 637. Stew of Lamb, Valencia fashion. — Cut into middling-sized squares a shoulder and a breast of lamb, put them into a shallow stewpan with lard or butter, fry them on a brisk fire until of a nice color ; then add a small chopped onion, a few spoonfuls of raw ham in dice, a little salt, a teaspoonful of red pepper, and a clove of garlic ; fry the meat a few minutes longer, and moisten to height with broth, boil the liquid for three minutes, then remove the stewpan on a moderate fire. When the lamb is about done, add some rice (one glass of rice to two of liquid) cook the stew for a quarter of an hour longer, with the lid on ; then set the pan on hot ashes, or at the entrance of the oven, so as that the rice, when done, may preserve its grains whole, as in a ‘risot’; afterwards dish it up. 638. Hind-quarters of lamb, roasted. — Get a double quarter of lamb, that is, the two hind-quarters (or both legs with saddle) ; bend the legs to the joint, break the thigh-bone, saw the shank-bones, fold the skirts of the saddleLAMB. 271 BUTCHER'S MEAT. underneath, fastening them with string, or with skewers; set the piece on the spit lengthwise ; run through the two legs a wooden skewer, to hold them firm ; wrap them up, as well as the saddle, with greased paper. Roast the piece for an hour and a quarter, basting with the drippings. Ten minutes before taking the roast off the fire, remove its paper, and salt the meat; dish it, and send up separately a sauceboat of good gravy, and one of mint-sauce. 639. Cases of lamb-sweetbreads (D. 98). — Set, in warm water, about fifteen lambs’ sweetbreads ; steep them in cold water, and dry them on a cloth. Fig. 98. Melt in a frying-pan two tablespoonfuls of fat bacon, scraped with the knife; mix it with two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion ; which fry, without allowing to take color ; add four or five fresh mushrooms, also chopped. When their moisture is reduced, moisten the fine-herbs with a quarter of a glass of madeira ; two minutes after, mix in the sweetbreads ; fry them for a few minutes, season, baste with a little melted glaze, and take them off the fire. Oil eight or ten small, round folded paper-cases ; mask them at the bottom, and all round, with a small layer of cooked veal force-meat (see No. 527) ; fill the hollow with the lambs’ sweetbreads, mask the garnish with a thin layer of cooked force- meat, with fine-herbs ; arrange the cases in order, on a small baking-sheet, spread with paper ; keep them for ten or twelve minutes in a slow oven ; glaze them with a paste-brush, and dish them up. 640. Haunch (quartier) of lamb, roasted. — What is called a haunch of lamb, is a leg to which the loin, up to the first ribs, is adhering. The lamb’s meat does not stand hanging to make tender, and must be well done. Trim the shank-bone, fold the skirt of the loin underneath, securing it with skewers, and set it on the spit ; then wrap it up with buttered paper, and roast it at272 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. a good fire,’ Lasting with butter or lard. Three quarters of an hour later, remove the paper; sprinkle it with bread-crumbs, allow it to take color, salt, take it up on a dish, and put a ruffle on the bone. Send some good gravy separately. In England haunch of lamb is generally served with a sweet and sour sauce, composed of fresh mint, and sometimes with minced shalots (also to be diluted with a little cold water, and vinegar), seasoned with salt, and sugar. 041. Leg of lamb, roasted, Bordeaux fashion. — The lamb in Bordeaux is usually small, but of a superior quality; it is fat, and remarkably white. Set a leg of lamb on the spit, moisten with butter or lard, roast it on a brisk fire, basting frequently with drippings ; when done, salt, and sprinkle it with bread- crumb, mixed with chopped parsley ; roast it for four or five minutes longer ; then take it off the fire, and dish it up. Send up separately a sauceboat of gravy, into which throw a little shred fresh mint. G42. ‘Fraissure’ Of lamb. — Boil a lamb’s pluck, four feet and ears, pro- ceeding as prescribed in No. 409 ; whilst cooking, put into a stewpan two table- spoonfuls of chopped shalot, and a piece of butter or lard ; fry it, without allowing to take color ; sprinkle over two tablespoonfuls of flour ; which fry for two minutes, stirring; moisten by degrees, with some cooking-stock, and a little broth; stir the sauce over the fire till ebullition ; then draw it at once on the side of the fire, to A quarter of an hour after, skim off the fat, and pass it, through a sieve, into a stewpan ; add to it fifteen raw mushrooms, pared and cleansed ; reduce the sauce for ten minutes, and thicken with two yolks of eggs. When ready to serve, drain the pluck, feet, and ears, on a cloth ; wipe them, remove the bone off the feet ; place the pluck on the centre of a dish,'with feet and ears round ; mask the whole with the sauce, surrounding with the mushrooms. 643. ‘Tourte’ of lamb’s pluck (fraissure). — Parboil in water, for eight or ten minutes, a lamb’s lungs; drain, and cut them up in middling-sized squares; also cut up, in the same way, the liver, and heart. Melt in a stewpan a piece of chopped fat-bacon, add the meats to it, fry them for a few minutes on a brisk fire ; season, and sprinkle over a few spoonfuls of raw fine-herbs : onion, shalbt, mushrooms ; four or five minutes afterwards, draw the stewpan off the fire. Spread out, on a round baking-sheet, a flat of short-paste ; mask its surface, to an inch and a half of the edges, with a layer of ‘godiveau’ force-meat (see No. 541) ; arrange the meats thereon, in a dome-way; mask them with another layer of‘godi- veau’, and cover them with a flat of paste ; finish the ‘tourte’, proceeding according to the method prescribed in No. 333 ; egg, push it into the oven ; ten minutes after,BUTCHER’S MEAT. — LAMB. 273 cover it with paper, and bake it for one hour. When done, slip it on a dish, mark a round opening on the top, through which pour in a little reduced gravy, mixed up with a few cooked mushrooms, each of them split in two ; cover again, and serve the ‘tourte’. G44. Small chartreuses of lamb-sweetbreads (D. 99). — Butter twelve large ‘dariole’-moulds, and adorn them at the bottom with a round of Fig. 99. truffle. Peel three large white turnips, and scoop from them, with a small cutter, some small sticks half the height of the moulds. Peel three large carrots, and with the same cutter, scoop from the red part of them, some small sticks; scoop also a few small balls by the aid of a vegetable-spoon. Boil the vegetables separately in salted water, keeping them rather firm. When cold, pare the ends of the turnips slantwise, to set them up leaning against the sides of the moulds ; range then over these turnips a chain of small red balls ; and above these begin a second row of turnips, turning in the opposite direction. Eight of these little ‘chartreuses’ ought to be decorated in the same fashion ; the four others are decorated, at the bottom, and on the top, with a circle of rounds of truffle ; and on the centre, with a few alternated Sticks of carrot, and turnip. As soon as the sides of the mould are garnished, support the vegetables with a layer of veal ‘quenelle’ force-meat (raw), leaving a hole on the centre. Prepare a ‘salpicon’ of cooked lamb-sweetbreads, mix it with half its volume of cooked mushrooms, cut likewise ; thicken with a few spoonfuls of good ‘béchamel’- sauce, reduced with a little glaze ; let the preparation cool, and fill with it, the cavity of the small ‘chartreuses’; mask them on the top with a thin layer of force-meat, and cover it with a small round of buttered paper ; arrange the moulds in a flat stewpan, with hot water half their height, and poach the ‘chartreuses’ in the ‘bain-marie’ for twenty-five minutes. When ready to serve, take up the moulds, turn them over, to dry the moisture of the ‘chartreuses’ ; remove the moulds, and dish the ‘chartreuses" in a pyramid ; 18274 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. eight at the bottom, and four on the top; send up separately a boatful of good ‘bechamel’-sauce, reduced with liquor of mushrooms. 045. Lambs’feet, with curry. — Boil eighteen lambs’ feet(seeNo.469), keeping them of a nice white color; drain them, spunge them on a cloth, remove the leg-bone ; pare the feet, place them in a flat stewpan ; season them, sprinkle over a pinch of curry-powder, moisten with a little melted glaze, and keep them warm. On the other hand, prepare a Velouté’-sauce ; skim its fat, pass it through a sieve ; then let it reduce further on a brisk Are, without ceasing to stir it, and gradually introducing into it a few tablespoonfuls of raw cream ; when it is reduced to the degree requisite, thicken it with two yolks of eggs, mixed with a little curry- powder and cream ; pass the sauce through a sieve on the lambs’ feet, which warm without ebullition. 646. Lambs’ feet, tartar-sauce. — Let eighteen lambs’-feet boil, keep- ing them carefully whole; drain them, remove the leg-bone without bringing them out of shape ; put the feet on a dish, season them with salt, and a pinch of cayenne pepper ; let them cool. Beat three whole eggs, add to them a pinch of cooked tine-herbs, a little salt and chopped parsley. Dip the lambs’ feet into the eggs, and immediately bread- crumb them ; dip them into melted butter, and place them side by side on a gridiron : let them broil at a very gentle fire. Prepare a mayonnaise-sauce, finish it with a tablespoonful of good mustard, and raw fine-herbs; such as, taragon, chives, shalot, pimpernel, chervil, and parsley. Dish the lambs’ feet, serve the sauce separately. , 647. Lambs’ plucks (fraises) with curry. — Get two very white and clean lambs’ plucks (or ruffles). Spread an earthen-stockpot with thin layers of bacon, place the ruffles thereon, add a large onion studded with cloves, a bunch of parsley and aromatics, a little salt and pepper ; moisten the meat, to three parts of its height, with white wine, and cover with thin layers of bacon ; set the stockpot on the fire ; at the first bubbling, draw it off on warm ashes, cover it with a soup-plate, and stew the ruffles gently ; four hours after, drain them on a sieve, and dish them up ; skim the fat carefully away from their stock, mix therewith a little good gravy ; let it boil, and thicken with a piece of kneaded-butter, and curry-powder ; at the first bubbling, pour it over the ruffles. 648. Lambs’ pluck, with hot ravigote-sauce. — The plucks, or ruffles, of lamb are in Bordeaux remarkably fine, and when cooked with.care, constitute an excellent dish.275 BUTCHER S MEAT. - LAMB.

Lambs Gars, Villeroy-saiice. — Poil fifteen lambs’ears, proceeding | as directed for those of veal (sec No. 409) ; let them remain in their stock till nearly cold , drain them on a cloth, empty them with a tin-cutter, and fill the cavity with a little cooked fine-herbs, mixed up with a third of their volume of rasped bread- I crumbs, thickened with a few yolks of eggs. When the ears are stuffed, dip them into a hot 'Villcroy-sauce, to mask them j slightly ; set them in order on a dish, and let the sauce cool. Take up afterwards the ears, roll them in bread-crumbs, dip them into beaten eggs, and bread-crumb once more. When ready to serve, fry them in hot hog’s | lard ; drain them, when of a nice color, and dish them up on a folded napkin. 050. Lambs’ feet, farced. — Boil about fifteen lambs’ feet in a white- ! (fonds-blanc), without breaking them ; drain, and split them down their length, 1 without dividing ; bone entirely, season, and fill the hollow with a little veal 'quenelle' force-meat, finished with a few tablespoonfuls of fine-herbs ; put the two parts back together, flour, dip them into beaten eggs, and bread-crumb. When ready to serve, plunge the lamb’s feet into hot hog’s lard, which fry nicely ; drain, and dish them on a folded napkin. 651. Lamb ‘sauté’, with tomatas. - Take a saddle of lamb, divide it into middling-sized squares, remove part of the bones, and put the meat into a flat stewpan, with butter, one onion, and a clove of garlic not peeled ; season, and fry them, continuing to toss, until they are about done. On the other hand, cut four tomatas through the centre, pick the seed out, divide them in large pieces ; which fry, over a brisk fire, in a frying-pan with oil ; season and toss them, until they have reduced their moisture; then add them to the lamb, and ten minutes after, dish up, after having removed the garlic and the onion. 652. Lamb’s liver, broiled, Provence-way. — Slice two lambs’livers, put them into a kitchen-basin, season them with salt and pepper; pour some oil 18*COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 276 over, and sprinkle with a pinch of parsley. Apply the slices, one by one, on some bread-crumbs, and broil them for seven or eight minutes over a brisk tire, basting and turning them over ; then dish up. 653. Lambs’ kidneys, glazed. — Take away the skin, and fat, from fifteen lambs’ kidneys, and divide each of them in two. Put into a frying-pan a piece of butter, and a tablespoonful of chopped shalot ; fry it -, as soon as of a light- brown color, add to it the kidneys, season with salt and pepper, and toss them over a brisk tire ; when set, pour over a few spoonfuls of melted glaze, roll them in it, (off the lire), sprinkle them with chopped parsley, add the juice of two lemons, and place the kidneys on a hot dish, surrounding with fried bread-'croûtons’, glazed with the paste-brush. 654. Smoked ham, Alsace way. — Salted and smoked hams are usually bought ready prepared ; their preparation being a thing more successfully to be executed, in large quantities ; the essential point is, to have them freshly smoked, and coming from a young animal of good breed. Almost all nations possess some districts renowned for their excellent hams, this preference is rather a matter of taste ; the hams of England, America, Hamburg, and Bayonne, seem to bear the palm over all the rest, as hams for boiling : those of Maintz and Westfalia are better, when eaten raw. Epicures, and cooks, have found out many ways of cooking hams; but in a family-kitchen, it is necessary to proceed in the shortest and simplest way. The method hereafter described, may be practised in all countries, without much expense or trouble. Cut out the thin end-bone of the ham, trim away the surface of the meat affected by the smoke, and soak it, for two or three hours, in cold water ; place it afterwards in a large stewpan, moisten with a sufficient quantity of water to cover, set it on the fire, and bring it gradually to ebullition ; then drain off the water, replacing it by tepid water ; add to the ham a few vegetables, cloves, peppercorns, and aromatics, but no bay-leaf ; set the stewpan again on the fire ; at the first bubbling, remove it back, letting the stock but gently simmer, for three hours and a half ; after which take the pan off the fire, and let the ham remain, for three quarters of an hour longer, in its liquor. When ready to serve, drain it, remove the thigh-bone and the rind, pare the meat at its thin end, smooth while paring the fat of the upper surface, and cut it with a knife so even underneath, as to secure it upright; glaze with a paste-brush, and dish up; surround it on both sides with good sour-crout, and on both ends with boiled potatoes. Send up separately a boatful of madeira-sauce.277 BUTCHER’S MEAT. — PORK. Carving. — A ham served hot, gains much by being carved at table. For this purpose, it must be supported with the carving-fork in the left-hand, then the fine 'noix’, or piece of meat which is found beside the bend of the knuckle-bone, must be first carved in slices, cut across the grain or fibre of the 'noix’, that is, from the top right downwards; when this thicker part has all been served, cut from the top in slanting slices, thus obtaining them with fat adhering. Hams that are served cold, may be carved before-hand. In this case, if it is wanted to be kept in form, the upper part must be slipped off whole, at one stroke, to the depth of the bone, beginning at the joint, and going to the extreme end ; this is then divided into two pieces, which are sliced transversally. 655. Ham, English fashion (D. 100). — Choose a Yorkshire-ham of good quality, and freshly smoked; soak it for a few hours, scrape it, and boil in Fig. 100. water, proceeding as prescribed in No. 654. When ready to serve, drain it on a baking-sheet, trim away two thirds of the rind, forming some flutings with the point of the knife on the part left at the thin end ; smooth the upper surface of the fat, round it all nicely ; then remove a large piece of the centre of the ham, which cut up in slices, and put back into its place. Then set the ham on an oblong dish ; surround it on both sides with a garnish of 'rissoles’ with truffles ; arrange, at one end, a group of boiled french-beans, and on the other, one of glazed carrots. Put a ruffle on the end-bone, glaze it, and send up separately some madeira-sauce, reduced with trim- mings of truffles. 656. Epicures’ ham. — Get a fresh and small Tonkin-ham, coming from a young animal ; salt it for a fortnight, in sousing-brine, mixed up with a little salt- petre ; smoke it for two days, then wash it, trim away the rind, and so much of the surface of the meat, as had been discolored by the smoke ; bone it entirely ; place it in a kitchen-basin, add to it two sliced shalôts, and two onions also sliced, a pinch of thyme, a little basil, and marjoram ; pour over two bottles of red burgundy wine,278 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. and a glass of madeira ; let it macerate, covered, twenty-four hours ; drain it, till up the hollow, left by the bones, with a piece of set meat-glaze, and three or four raw truffles ; sew up the openings, and truss the ham into its natural form. Soften, in water, a fresh pork’s bladder, not inflated ; wipe it with a cloth, blow into and inflate it, so as to widen the opening sufficiently, by which to introduce the ham. Pass the marinade-stock through a sieve, and pour a tablespoonful of it into the bladder with the ham ; then close the opening of the bladder tightly, wrap it up in another bladder, tie this likewise, wrap the ham up in a cloth, tying this fast on the side of the bladder’s opening, and plunge the ham into hot water, to boil gently for four hours, without interruption. When the ham is done, take it off the tire ; one hour after, drain it, unpack it from both cloth and bladder; pour the liquid contained in the bladder into a stewpan, and thicken it with a piece of kneaded-butter. Remove the string from the ham, dish it up, and pour the sauce over. (157. Tonkin-ham, roasted, à la Vernon. — Get a good Tonkin-ham, from a young animal, and lately smoked; soak it for one hour, pare the surface, and put it into a stewpan with cold water ; bring the liquid to ebullition, boil the ham on the side of the tire for three quarters of an hour ; then drain it, remove the rind and the thigh-bone. Put it into a narrow earthen-pan, moisten to its height, with a cooked marinade-stock ; let it macerate for twenty-four hours, with the pan covered ; drain it, mask it with the vegetables ‘mirepoix’, resting on two or three buttered sheets of strong foolscap; place it in a cradle-spit, and roast it at a moderate tire, basting with fat; fifty minutes later, mix some of the marinade-stock in the drip pings, with which baste the ham. One hour after, remove the paper, and let the ham roast half an hour longer, or in all about two hours and a half. Then take it off the spit, dish it up, strain the stock from the dripping-pan, skim off its fat, reduce a part of it to half-glaze, add to it a few spoonfuls of brown-sauce, and five minutes after, pour it over the ham. Send up separately a dish of vegetable ‘croquettes’. 658. Boiled leg of salted pork. — Rub with salt a leg of young tender pork ; place it in a vessel with a weight over it ; repeat the operation for four or five days consecutively ; then let the meat macerate, in its own brine, for ten or twelve days more. Wash the leg, put it into a stewpan, large enough to cover it with cold water; boil and skim well ; at the first bubbling remove thy pan back. Add to the meat some sprigs of'parsley and aromatics, the half of a cabbage, cut in two, six large carrots in pieces, and two large turnips, likewise in pieces. Two hours after, theBUTCHER S MEAT. — PORK. 279 • j meat and vegetables must be done ; then drain tbe pork, place it on a dish, and sur- J round it with the vegetables. Send up separately a sauceboat of good gravy, or some caper-sauce ; and send at the same time a pease-pudding, boiled, in a cloth, a- | long with the meat. 659. Ham, with aspic-jelly (D. 101). — Get a ham freshly smoked, scrape it, saw off the end of the knuckle-bone, and leave it to soak for a few hours ; after which boil it according to the instructions given in No. 654. When taken out Fig. 101. of its cooking-stock, after slipping off the thigh-bone, wrap the ham up tightly in a cloth, shaping it into a nice form to cool. Unpack it afterwards, trim the rind away, pare it neatly, glaze the surface with a paste-brush; put a ruffle to the bone, set it on a ‘pain-vert’ masked with white paper, or with fat ; surround the ham at the base, with chopped aspic-jelly ; place on the top some ‘croûtons’ of aspic, in a scroll fashion, and insert on the thin end one or two ‘hâtelet’-skewers, garnished with jelly and truffles. The ham may be carved before dishing up. 660. Salt leg of pork, English fashion. — Wash a leg of pork, salted for a fortnight ; place it in a braising-pan, cover it largely with water ; place the braising-pan on a brisk fire, in order to let the liquid boil ; then forthwith remove it back to the side of the fire. Add some large vegetables, as well as half a quart of dry yellow pease, wrapped up in a cloth, which is tied fast with thread. Cover the braising-pan, and continue a regular ebullition, for three hours, if the leg weighs seven or eight pounds. When the meat of the knuckle-end of the leg is tender, to the touch of the finger, drain the leg, pare, dish it up, and keep it warm. Drain the pease, untie, take them out ; pound them, and pass them through a sieve ; put the purée into a stcwpan, add to it a piece of butter, season it, warm, and place it in a small deep dish. ,280 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. Surround the leg of pork with a garnish of various vegetables ; such as young carrots, Brussels-sprouts, turnips boiled or glazed separately. Accompany the leg by a sauceboatful of good gravy, slightly thickened. 661. Cold ham-pie. — Take, from a ham freshly smoked, the cushion- piece or 'noix’, and the piece underneath it ; trim away the firm parts, and divide them in squares of not quite two inches each. If the ham he over-salted, it will he requisite to soak it for a few hours in milk and water, before cutting : stud after- wards each of the squares with a piece of raw truffle. Melt five ounces of lard in a stewpan ; when hot, add to it the squares of ham ; which fry but for a few minutes. Prepare a raw mince with lean pork and veal, half and half, and the same quantity of fresh fat-bacon. Chop the trimmings of the truffles, pound and mix them with the mince; to which then add a fifth its volume, of lean cooked ham chopped very fine, and the same of cooked fat-bacon in small dice. Season the preparation highly, but putting only a little salt. Line a cold pie-mould with short-paste (see No. 196), cover the bottom, and allround inside the paste, with a layer of the previously prepared mince, and fill the hollow in the centre with the squares of ham, alternated with force-meat ; dish the preparation in a dome-like fashion ; cover with layers of fat bacon, and then with paste, finishing the pie according to the directions given in No. 206. Egg, and bake it, then, for two hours, in a moderate oven, remembering to cover it with a piece of thick paper, as soon as it begins to take color. One hour after the pie is taken out of the oven, fill it (through the chimney at the top) with two glasses of tepid aspic-jelly ; and one hour later, remove it from the mould, and leave it thoroughly to cool. 662. Ham of Asturias, with spun-eggs. — The hams from the Asturias are the most renowned in Spain; and, served with spun eggs (œufs filés), they constitute one of the best dishes of the Spanish cookery. Get a ham from a young animal; scrape, soak, and boil it in the conditions prescribed in No. 654. Drain it, when done, remove the rind, pare the upper surface neatly, dry the fat with a cloth, and sprinkle over a layer of pounded sugar, glazing it a fine color with a salamander; then put a ruffle on the ham-bone, and set it on a dish. In the meanwhile, break fifteen fresh eggs, put the yolks into a kitchen-basin, bruise them slightly, and pass them through a sieve ; poach them afterwards in the form of vermicelli, dropping them into a light syrup, kept boiling in a sugar-pan. To succeed in this, a wide-mouthed colander must be had, but with a flat bottom, pierced by only five or six small tin-pipes (of the diameter of vermicelli) solderedBUTCHER'S MEAT. — PORK. 281 outside in relief. To poach the eggs, it suffices to pour them into such a colander, placed over the boiling syrup. As soon as firm, drain them with a skimmer, and spread them carefully over a sieve, moistening them with cold water, so as to hinder their adhering one to the other. Then dish them round the ham. 663. Cold-pie, to be carved (D. 102 and 103). — The mould, repre- sented by the drawing, is of tin ; it is about two feet long, and two inches and a half wide, at the mouth, or aperture; it rests on two straight supports, placed at its extremities. These pies are convenient for lunch, and supper. Fig. 102. Fig. 103. Butter the mould, line it then with short-paste, which keep thin. Prepare a fine raw mince, composed of lean veal, and fat bacon, in equal parts; take about a third part of the volume of this mince, of poultry-livers fried with bacon and aromatics, then cooled ; pound them in a mortar, gradually adding to them the raw mince. Season the preparation with salt, and good spices, put it into a kitchen-basin, add to it a few spoonfuls of blanched bacon cut in small dice, and the same of raw truffles, likewise cut in dice. With this preparation till the mould, cover the pie, carefully soldering the paste on to the sides. Contrive three holes in the top of the pie, one of which in the middle, the two others on the sides; egg the paste, push the pie into a moderate oven ; ten minutes after, cover with paper, and bake it for an hour. On taking the pie out of the oven, leave it still in the mould ; two hours after, filter into it, by means of the three apertures, some good tepid aspic-jelly. Keep the pie cool. , The second drawing of this article represents the pie, cut on one side. 664. American-ham. — Hams from America are now-a-days common on the continent, and in England sought by amateurs ; they arc generally very large, weighing sometimes as much as thirty pounds; still it is preferable to choose those of middling-size (eighteen or twenty pounds), as they are generally more tender. The people selling these hams pretend to receive them from certain regions of the United States, where the hogs roam pretty nearly wild over the vast forests; where to be caught, they must be shot. I have never been enabled to verify the truth of this assertion, but if the truth be so, it cannot but improve the qualities of the meat of those animals.282 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. Let the ham he partly boned, without going to the first joint of the thin end; saw the shank-bone, pare the surface of the meat, and soak the ham in cold water for several hours; tie it up afterwards, and boil it, proceeding as prescribed in No. 054; drain, and pare it ; remove the rind away, and place it in a narrow braising-pan ; moisten with a bottle of madcira ; cover, and let the wine boil until about reduced, being careful to baste the ham frequently ; then drain it, and dish up. Mix a little brown-sauce with the cooking-stock, reducing it ; finish the sauce, adding to it one or two spoonfuls of red-currant jelly, and strain it, through a sieve, over the ham; send up separately a dish of mixed vegetables, such as spinach, green-pease, french-beans. 065. Slices of Bayonne-ham, ‘à la Zingara’. — Cut some slices (not too thin) from the ‘noix’ of a raw ham, and as nearly as possible of the same thick- ness; soak them, in milk', for one hour ; then dry, and put them into a frying-pan with melted lard, frying them slightly on both sides. As soon as set, take them out with a fork, and dish up; add to the fat in the pan, two handfuls of rasped bread- crumb; which fry for a few seconds, stirring, moisten with a glass of vinegar, and a little gravy; let the sauce boil a few minutes, add to it a pinch of pepper and chopped parsley, and pour it over the slices of ham. 666. Roast loin of fresh pork, Bordeaux fashion. — Take the half of a saddle or chine (échine) of pork, trimmed of the most part of the fat; remove the spine-bone, score slightly the fat meat above the fillet ; prick it then with two cloves of garlic, one at each end; truss the loin securely, place it in a roasting- pan with about two glasses of water, seasoning the meat, and adding to it a few sprigs of sage ; cover it with greased paper, and roast it, in a moderate oven, for an hour and a half, basting often. When three-parts done, surround it with small, fresh ‘cepes’, which baste with fat ; when the loin is done, set it on an oval dish, and place the ‘cèpes’ all round. Take the fat out of the roasting-pan, into which pour a few spoonfuls of good gravy ; let it boil, strain, and send it up with the meat. 667. Roast loin of Tonkin-pork, English fashion. — Get a fine loin of Tonkin-pork, without removing the rind or swarth (couenne), slightly score this in strips, by incisions with the blade of a sharp knife ; disengage the minion- fillet of the loin, remove the skin, as well as the sinewy parts ; chop the meat and fat, add to them nearly the same quantity of bread-crumb ; add to the above a small onion chopped, a little parsley, and a little sage, both likewise chopped; add moreover salt and pepper, then two or three yolks of eggs. With this mince fill the hollow left by the minion-fillet, mask it with a piece of caul of pork, then fill the flap (bavette), and tie the loin with thread, roasting itPORK. BUTCHER’S MEAT. 283 thus for nearly an hour. The meat done, salt it, set it on a dish, serve with a little good gravy, or else with some simple piquant-sauce. _ Serve at the same time some pickles. This dish is the more appreciable, being served no where but in England. 668. Omelet, with. ham. — "Fake half a pound of raw ham, soak it for two hours in water and milk, half and half; drain, wipe it on a cloth, pare away the surplus of fat, and sinewy parts; divide it into middling-sized dice; which put into a frying-pan, with four ounces of melted butter. Beat eight or ten fresh eggs in a kitchen-basin, season with a little salt, a pinch of pepper and chopped parsley : beat them well. Set the frying-pan over a brisk and clear tire, warm the ham, without frying; pour the eggs in, and stir them gently with a wooden spoon, bringing the edges to the centre, thus thickening the omelet, and keeping it as smooth as possible. As soon as it contains no more liquid preparation, take the spoon out, toss the pan slightly, so as to disengage the whole ; at this point, withdraw the frying-pan from the lire, to toss it more easily, and to bring the omelet on one side ; then fold it into an oblong shape with pointed ends; moisten the bottom of the pan with two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, and turn out the omelet on a small oblong dish. A well made omelet, should be smooth on the surface, of a nice gold color, and soft and foamy (baveuse) inwardly ; it requires also to be neatly shaped. 6(19. Pig’s head stuffed, German fashion. — Let macerate, for live days, in a saltpetred brine, a pig’s ears, muzzle, tongue, and feet: the muzzle should be previously boned, and the skin of the feet pricked with a trussing-needle: boil the meats in water, with vegetables ; drain them, remove carefully all the bones, and cut them in fillets, about two inches long; mix them in a kitchen-basin, season, and till with them a large ox-gut-bladder, well cleansed, tying the ends, and taking- care not to let in any air. Boil this ‘galantine’, in a broth prepared with the bones of the head, until it rises to the surface of the stock ; then drain it, let it cool under weight, and serve it with aspic-jelly. 670. Head of fresh pork, with poivrade-sauce. — Bone the half of a fresh head of pork ; cover it with salt, place it in a kitchen-basin with aromatics, cloves, and peppercorns; pour over two or three glasses of vinegar, and let it mace- rate for twenty-four hours ; then drain it, wipe, singe, and divide it in pieces ; which put into a stewpan, moisten with the marinade, and a little water; add a few vege- tables, let the liquid boil up, and at the first bubbling, take the pan on the side of the tire, boiling the head thus for three or four hours.284 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. When ready to serve, drain it, wipe the pieces on a cloth, trim the outer sides of the tube (tuyau) of the ear, which place on the centime of the dish, with the other pieces round, and mask them with the following sauce : Poivrude-sauce. — Slice a large onion, and four shalots ; put them into a stewpan, with a few trimmings of raw ham, a little lard, a clove of garlic, not peeled, a few sprigs of parsley, thyme, bay-leaf, cloves, and peppercorns. Fry the ingredients for seven or eight minutes, moisten with a glass of good vinegar, which reduce to half, moisten again with two glasses of brown-sauce ; let the sauce boil, withdraw it, so as to continue the ebullition on one side only, and a quarter of an hour after, skim the fat off, finish it with a pinch of fine pepper, or a point of cayenne ; pass it through a sieve. 671. Hungarian Percoëll. — This dish, called ‘percoëir, is a national stew of Hungary. Its preparation is one of the simplest. Cut up in squares a pound of veal-meat taken from the side of the knuckle, and add to this meat an equal quantity of loin of pork. Cut an onion into dice, put it into a flat stewpan with lard, add half a bay-leaf; sprinkle over ‘paprica’, and fry it a little, then add the meats ; season, fry the meat for seven or eight minutes, cover the stewpan, draw it over a moderate lire, and stew the meats with warm ashes on the lid, stirring from time to time. When done, baste them simply with two table- spoonfuls of brown-sauce, or some glaze ; dish them up in a border of rice prepared the Italian way. 672. Sucking-pig, roasted. — England, Russia, Poland, arc the only countries, I know of, where this dish is esteemed, and frequently served. In Germany and Italy it is seldom served, in France still less. In countries, where this dish is common, sucking-pigs are generally bought ready prepared for cooking. Get a small, very white, sucking-pig; singe it all over, where any hair is left; cleanse it well, and stuff it with a raw mince of pork mixed with its liver, and a little panada, fine-herbs, and sage ; or else, with English stuffing, composed of bread-crumbs, beef-suet, whole eggs, onion, parsley, and sage, all of which chopped. When the pig is tilled, remove the thigh-bones, and truss the hind-quarters underneath the belly; stretching its fore-legs under the head, and supporting all its members with small skewers and twine. Then pierce the pig through lengthwise with the spit, and fasten it on its sides with iron-skewers ; baste it slightly with a paste-brush dipped in melted lard, and roast it for an hour and a half at a moderate fire, frequently basting. At last, when the skin is nicely colored, dried and crisp, salt the pig, take it off the fire, and dish it up. Send up separately a sauceboat of gravy with taragon, or a ‘piquant’-sauce highly seasoned.BUTCHER’S MEAT. PORK. 285 673. Cold sucking-pig, Russ fashion. — Take half a sucking-pig, divide it in pieces, which boil in a ‘mirepoix’ with white wine ; let them cool, and bone. Add to the cooking-stock some calf’s-foot-jelly, and clarify it, proceeding as for aspic-jelly. Encrust in pounded ice a large oblong ‘timbale’-mould, adorn it, at the bottom, and all round, with poached white of eggs, gerkin, and beet-root; dipping each detail of the decoration in half-set jelly, previous to applying it. Pour a thick layer of jelly on the bottom of the dish ; let it set, and there arrange the pieces of meat in layers,' alternated with minced gerkins and whole capers, being careful to leave a hollow all round the mould ; fill this hollow with cold liquid jelly, and let it well set. When ready to serve, dip the mould in warm water, turn the ‘pain’ out on a dish, and send up at the same time a sauceboat with horce-radish-sauce. 674. Salted pig’s ears, with purée of lentils. — Singe carefully three or four salted pig’s ears; scald them, drain, and plunge them into a stewpan with water; add some vegetables, a few sprigs of aromatics, cloves, and peppercorns; boil the ears for three or four hours, then drain them, wipe them on a cloth, and dish them upright on a purée of lentils. Pour over a little gravy, reduced with four table- spoonfuls of good vinegar, slightly thickened. 675. Pork-cutlets, Catalan-sauce. — Cut up six pork-cutlets; pare, beat, season, and broil them, over a good fire, fourteen or fifteen minutes ; dish up, and mask them with the following sauce, thus prepared : Catalan-sauce. — Chop one onion, put it into a stewpan with a dozen blanched cloves of garlic, and some oil ; color them gently, and moisten with a little broth, which reduce to a glaze. The garlic should now be done ; moisten anew with a little thickened gravy ; let the sauce boil, add to it a pinch of chopped parsley, a little cayenne, a little shred mint, the pulp of a lemon and two bitter oranges, peeled, in quarters. When ready to serve the sauce, add a tablespoonful of good mustard diluted with madeira. 676. Carapulca, Spanish fashion. — Cut up two fillets of pork in mid- dling-sized squares ; put them into a stewpan with lard, some large dice of raw ham, and two dozen small onions; set the stewpan on the fire, fry the meats, season, and moisten to height with broth ; let the liquid boil for a few minutes, draw the pan on a moderate fire, to finish cooking the meat. Then pour the stew into an earthen-pan, standing the fire, spread on the top four or five sausages, fried and cut up in pieces, and four or five hard-boiled eggs in quarters. Season them with salt and pepper, sprinkle meats and eggs with shred almonds, fried in oil, and bruised with a rolling-COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 28G pin ; let the sauce boil up, and push it into a moderately heated oven, to gratinate for half an hour: send it up in the same earthen-pan. 677. French black-pudding. — Black-puddings are prepared with pig’s blood ; the chief point is to preserve this blood liquid, until the time of using it. This aim is attained by mixing it with a little vinegar ; but care must be" taken to stir it until cold, so as to prevent it from coagulating. Remove the sinewy skin, or sward, of two pounds of pork-fat, which cut to dice of half an inch square. Chop very fine six ounces of the same fat, let it melt in a stewpan, removing the cracklings ; mix it with seven or eight blanched onions, drained well and chopped ; let it boil for a few minutes, then take it off the fire, and let it half-cool. Pass through a sieve two quarts of blood, mix them with this fat; add to this preparation, half a pint of raw double-cream, season it with salt, pepper, and spices; stir it with a spoon on a moderate fire, until beginning to thicken like a cream ; pour it im- mediately into a basin, and with it till, without cracking them, the pig’s bowels; being- well cleansed, dissalted, and tied fast at one end. A large tin-funnel, with a large aperture, is generally employed for this operation. When the bowels are full, fasten also the other end, and plunge them into a stewpan with warm water; keep at the same degree, until the black-puddings are poached; drain them on a cloth, rub the surfaces with a piece of sward, let them cool, kept covered. Black-puddings arc generally broiled ; they must be well done. 678. German black-pudding (boudins noirs). — Blanch a few hand- fuls of fresh rinds of pork, which scrape, wash, and boil in water; when drained, chop them fine, and mix them with a third of their volume of bacon in small dice: put the preparation into a kitchen-basin ; season with salt, pepper, pulverised mar- joram, and thyme ; introduce into it a third of its volume of liquid pig’s blood, and till with it some guts, tied-up at one end; then boil the pudding (boudin) in water, on a very slow fire, for half an hour. These puddings may be smoked. 679. White - pudding (boudins blancs), German fashion. — Chop and pound half a pound of lean pork, add to it half a pound of pig’s fat (suet), equally chopped ; pound again, and add half a pound of panada, prepared with bread-crumb and milk ; pound the force-meat again, add to it four tablespoonfuls of cooked minced onion, thickened with a little ‘béchamel’-sauce. Season the force- meat with salt, pepper, and mace ; pass it through a sieve, put it into a kitchen- basin, then work it. with a wooden-spoon, introducing into it, first two whites of eggs, then two gills of good raw cream ; last of all, add to the above three ounces of swelled pistachios cut in dice.287 BUTCHER’S MEAT. — PORK. Introduce the force-meat into salted sheep’s gut, soaked in water, and carefully cleansed. Tie these bowels up at distances of four or tive inches, thus marking the length of the puddings ; which place in a large stewpan ; cover with water and milk, half and half. Warm the liquid, without allowing it to boil ; let the puddings half-cool in the liquid, then drain, and hang them up in the air. Twelve hours afterwards, prick the surface of the puddings with a needle, broil them on a moderate fire, turning them. 680. Zampino, with french-beans (D. 104). — In Italy and Vienna they think a great deal of a ‘zampino’ (‘hand’, 7. (’. foot and leg, of young pork,) from Modena, and they are quite right. For my own part, I do not know any product of this nature, more cleverly contrived, or more successfully achieved, than this ‘zampino’. The only thing to regret, is, that the ‘zampino’ is not sufficiently and better known to epicures. Choose a ‘zampino’ freshly salted, having soaked it for two hours, drain, and wrap it up in a fine cloth ; tie, and place it in an oval stewpan, moistening plentifully with cold water; make the liquid boil, draw the pan on the side of the tire, keeping the stock simmering for two hours, after which, take the pan quite off the fire, leaving the ‘zampino’ in, and twenty minutes after, unpack, and dish it on a garnish of french-beans or sour-crout. 681. Cervelas of Strasburg. — Trim away the fat and sinew of twelve pounds of beef; chop it fine with a handful of salt, and half a spoonful of salt- petre. Chop six pounds of pork, and two pounds of fresh bacon; add them to the beef, season the mince with four tablespoonfuls of pepper, two of pimento, and two of coriander ; (all of which pulverised ;) chop it a little longer, moistening with a glass of cold water. When the mixture is complete, fill some middling-sized guts, tie them up, so as to mark the length of the ‘cervelas’; smoke them for two days, and boil carefully; take them out of their stock, as soon as ever the water is to be seen, between the guts and the farce ; wrap them in a cloth, and leave them to cool. 682. Pig’s feet, as at St. Menehould. — The pork-butchers of St. Menehould, in Lorraine, have very long enjoyed the renown of preparing pig’s feet,COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 288 the bones of which after being broiled are so tender, that they may be crushed by mere pressure between the fingers. Some people say, they may be eaten ; but I rather doubt, that a bone of pig’s feet, never so well cooked, could ever be a delight for epicures. So far, however, is a matter of fact, verified by myself not long ago. But this is nothing very extraordinary: every one may henceforth operate this wonder, if like me, he be not afraid to brave the thunderbolt of Saint Menehould. To explain my meaning, I ought to say, that the pork-butchers of St. Menehould make a secret of their science. Procure five or six clean scalded pig’s feet; steep them, put them into a stewpan with water, and parboil them for three quarters of an hour; then drain, refresh, and singe them. Wrap them up separately in a small cloth, or tie them simply with broad tape {ruban dr fil') ; place them in a stockpot, garnished with vegetables ; cover with plenty of water, and half a bottle of white wine ; add salt and aromatics, and let the liquid boil up, skimming ; then remove the pan on a very slow fire, surround- ing with warm ashes; or place it in the oven,* thus to be kept simmering. Close the stockpot-lid with lutings, and boil the feet twenty-four hours ; let them cool in their stock, drain, unpack, and divide each of them in two; season highly, and bread-crumb with eggs ; broil them over a fire; when hot, dish them up, and serve immediately. This long cooking has the effect of softening the bones of the feet, but at the same time causes them to be highly over-done. m 083. Nancy chitterlings (andouilles). — Take three pounds of calf's pluck, and the same of pig’s paunch ; steep them in water, wash carefully, and cook them in water for two hours. Drain, refresh, wipe, and cut them up in pieces; which put into a kitchen-basin, season highly with salt and spices, baste with a little white wine, and sprinkle over some cooked fine-herbs. With this preparation proceed to fill some fat pig’s guts, previously soaked and washed, tie up the chitterlings (art- douilles), six or eight inches long, prick them with a trussing-needle, and plunge them into a stockpot of boiling water. As soon as the ebullition begins, draw the stockpot on the side of the fire, letting the liquid simmer gently; add to it salt, vege- tables, and aromatics, and give two hours of boiling. Take the stockpot then off the fire, and leave the chitterlings in their liquor, till about cold ; drain them afterwards, place between two dishes, or wrap them up in a cloth to cool. Broil them twenty-five * Tliis operation I have tried successfully on a small gas-fire: and this mode appears to me superior to all the rest, for slow, and lengthened cooking, in this sense, that it is easier to regulate the degree of heat. Gas is very little used, as yet, in French kitchens ; and it is a great mistake : in England its utility is better understoodBUTCHER’S MEAT. — PORK. 289 | minutes, on a good fire, turning. They must he well done throughout, and sent up very hot on a hot dish. ■ 084. Pig’s feet, with truffles ; Nancy fashion. — Prepare a little fine raw mince with lean pork, and fresh bacon, half and half; add to it a few table- j spoonfuls of cooked fine-herbs, and some trimmings of raw truffles, pounded with I a little raw mince ; season with salt, spices, and a point of cayenne. Boil four pig’s feet, in salted water, with vegetables and aromatics ; drain them on a dish, unpack them, split them in two, bone completely, and trim away the ; sinewy parts, which add to the mince. The feet being quite cold, season with salt and spices, spread them on a table, and mask inwardly with the prepared mince ; which mask also with seasoned slices of raw truffles. Now wrap up each half-foot in a square of pig’s caul ; moisten the caul with melted lard, bread-crumb, and broil the feet over a moderate fire for twenty minutes, turning. Send them up with gravy under them. 685. Fresh pork-pie, English fashion. — Cut up some slices of fresh pork off the loin, or leg ; after paring away the hard parts, beat them slightly with the handle of the knife, and season with salt and pepper. Spread the bottom of a pie-dish with slices of raw ham ; season with a pinch of ! pepper, and sprinkle over two tablespoonfuls of chopped shalot and onion, where- on place a layer of raw potatoes in slices, place over it the slices of pork in layers, intermingled with a few sage-leaves. Pour into the dish half a pint of good cold gravy, line the border of the pie-dish with a strip of short-paste, or of trimmings of puff-paste, moisten the strip, cover the pie with a flat of the same paste, which solder to that of the borders; channel, and adorn the pie, proceeding as directed in No. 596 ; egg it, set it on a baking-tin, and push it into a moderate oven. A quarter of an hour after, cover it with paper, and bake it for another hour ; when done, set it on a dish. 686. Raw mince Of fresh pork. — The raw mince of fresh pork is the fundamental auxiliary of ‘galantines’, cold pies, ‘crépinettes’, sausages, etc. Take all the meat of a pig’s neck, or that of the shoulder ; separate the fat parts from the lean ones ; pare the latter clear of all sinewy skin, trim also the fat of the meat, and mix it with fresh fat-bacon, thus getting an equal quantity of fat and lean parts. Chop separately the meat and bacon ; both being fine, mix them together, chop a little more, and season with salt and spices. 687. Fresh boiled sausages, with truffle. — Take eight ounces of fresh truffles; having first removed the earth covering them, picking out with the 19COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 290 point of a knife, the parts which the brush has not reached, then peel them ; chop up the trimmings of the truffles, cut their substance into small dice. Prepare a raw mince, with half a pound of lean pork-meat, and the sqme quan- tity of fat bacon, add the raw truffle-trimmings, and chop the whole together a few minutes longer ; season highly, put them into a kitchen-basin, and mix them with the truffles in dice. Meanwhile, steep in tepid salted water, some fresh sheep’s guts ; wipe them on a cloth, fill them by the aid of a small funnel, with the mince of pork ; tie them at equal distances, with thread, thus marking the length of each sausage ; and hang them in an airy place, keeping them thus for twelve hours. Then cut the sausages, range them on a gridiron, and broil them for twelve or fourteen minutes, turning. The sausages must always be well done. 688. Sausages, smoked with cumin. — Chop fine ten pounds of beef, with a handful of salt, and a pinch of saltpetre. Chop also four pounds of pork-meat, and two pounds of fat bacon ; mix the two minced meats together ; season with four ounces of pepper, two ounces of pimento, and eight ounces of cumin : all these spices must be pulverised. Add to this a few cloves of garlic, peeled and chopped ; mince the preparation a few minutes longer, gradually introducing into it a quart of water; then fill the guts, as for the sausages to broil, smoke them a few hours gently, boil them in water for five minutes, and let them cool. 689. Maintz sausages, for broiling. — Cut up in small dice eight pounds of pork, mixed up with a handful of pepper, and a pinch of saltpetre; chop the meat, moistening by degrees, with three glasses of cold water. When the mince is firm, without being too fine, fill some small guts ; tie them up, so as to form short sausages ; which let dry in a chimney for twenty-four hours ; broil them afterwards foi; ten or twelve minutes, and send them up on a hot dish. 690. Saveloy of liver, with truffles. — Peel ten ounces of fresh truffles, cut them up in small dice, boil them for two minutes, with a quarter of a glass of madeira ; then put them into a basin with an equal quantity of fat-liver in dice, and season with salt and spices. Scrape two pounds of pig’s liver, chop, and pass it through a sieve. Cut up in dice two pounds of fresh fat-bacon, and mix it up with the liver. Cut up two pounds of pork, from the neck, in small pieces; put it into a stewpan with lard, and fry it on a moderate fire, until done ; let it cool ; chop, and pass it through a sieve; then add to the liver the bacon, fat-liver, and truffles. Season the preparation highly, add a pinch of saltpetre, and one of cayenne ; stuff the guts, and finish the operation, proceeding as prescribed in No. 691. 691. Saveloy of liver. — Scrape with a knife two pounds of pig’s liver, then chop it fine.BUTCHER’S MEAT. — PORK. 291 ‘ On the other hand, have chopped two pounds of lean cooked pork, and two pounds of fresh fat-bacon; add liver and meat to the bacon; season with salt, a pinch of saltpetre, spices, and a little cayenne pepper, or some pounded pimento ; baste the mince with two or three tablespoonfuls of ‘kirsch’, and add six ounces of chopped onion, previously fried in lard. Chop the preparation for ten minutes more, and stuff with it some pig’s guts, soaked and well washed, tilling them as full as pos- sible ; tie them up, at four or five inches’ distance, and let the saveloys dry in the air ; then plunge them into boiling water, and boil them on a slow fire (the water should do nothing but simmer) for one hour ; take the pan then off the tire ; one hour later, drain the saveloys carefully, wrap them up in small cloths, tie them at both ends, and let them cool completely, before serving. 092. Saveloys, smoked, Swiss fashion. Take six pounds of pig’s ears, rinds, and meat from the leg, in equal portions ; soak them in cold water for half an hour ; drain, wipe, and put them into a wooden, or an earthen vessel ; sprinkle over salt, and saltpetre, and let them macerate for six days in the brine. Boil the meats, as well as the rinds and ears, in water; bone them, cut them up in long shreds, and deposit them in a kitchen-basin. . Chop separately four pounds of pig’s meat, and a pound and a half of fat bacon ; mix them together, season the mince with a handful of salt and a teaspoonful of saltpetre, a handful of pepper and half a handful of pulverised pimento, a table- spoonful of nutmeg, one of cinnamon, the same of pounded cloves, and at last, four ounces of chopped shalot. Chop the minced farce anew, mix it with the meats in the basin, and fill with it some very clean middling-sized guts; tie up the saveloys ; smoke them for two days, and boil them in water for ten minutes ; drain, wrap them up tight in a cloth, and thus let them cool. These saveloys are served cold, and cut up in thin slices. 093. Saveloy of liver, Frankfort fashion. — Chop very fine eight pounds of raw pig’s liver. Chop also four pounds of fat pork; when fine, add gradually the liver, without ceasing to chop. The mixture made, season the pre- paration with salt, pepper, and pounded cloves; then fill some middling-sized guts, tie them up, and boil the saveloys in water, for one hour, on a very slow fire. Drain, and let them cool, wrapped up in a cloth. 094. ‘Beni’ of the Russians. — The ‘beni’ is not a dish ; it is a repast, a sacramental feast with which the Russ, Poles, and Greeks, celebrate the Christian Pasc, or Easter-day. In this repast the dishes are all cold, and the guests dare not sit round the table, but like the Jewish paschal feast must partake of it standing. The table is not cleared all day long. The dishes are replaced, as soon as emptied. 19*292 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY'. The meal is composed specially of cold meats: poultry, game, hams, sausages, veal, (no fish) ; with these meats are served some baba-cakes cooked in moulds, others in thin baking-sheets ; these last are of square form, and sprinkled with almonds. The number of dishes, and the species, vary according to the countries, and arc evidently optionally variable. But what is rigorously required, is: the cooked salt, the cheese decorated with currants, the colored hard-boiled eggs, a sucking-pig, stuffed and roasted, a lamb modeled in butter, placed on an imitated book, and holding between its fore-paws a Greek cross. The cheese, served at this repast, is simply some fresh white cheese ; pressed in a cloth, then pounded with a piece of butter, slightly sugared, and mixed up with a few spoonfuls of raw cream. It is afterwards passed through a sieve, and kept a few hours in a wooden mould, in the shape of a square pyramid ; this mould is without bottom, it is composed of four movable pieces, mounted by the aid of grooves, and bearing, on at least two faces, a cross encrusted. Before moulding the cheese, the interior surfaces of the mould are spread with a fine cloth. When the cheese is taken out of the mould, its angles are decorated with currants. For cooking the salt, it has to be first pounded, then diluted with a white of egg, thus forming a firm paste; then wrapt up in a cloth secured with string, and set in the fire (not too hot) to cook for three or four hours. When the cloth is consumed by the fire, the salt forms a white calcined lump. It is then pounded, and placed in the salt-cellars. Before cooking the eggs, have a Greek cross drawn on the shells, with the aid of a fat substance (soap), and then plunge them into water, colored with cochineal or saffron, to boil and color them red or yellow. The Russians eat the eggs with the purified salt. All the dishes, composing this solemn repast, ought to be blessed by the priest (called ‘pope’) before they can be offered to the family or the guests. This is on the whole what constitutes the ‘béni’. The Russians never omit or fail to celebrate it, not only at home, but wherever they are sojourning at Easter-tide : this is the reason, why I have thought it useful, to give a succinct, but sufficient description of it.

Poultry is divided into several distinct categories : fowls (poules), chickens (poulets), pullets (poulardes), and capons; turkeys, peacocks, and guinea-fowl (pintades) ; geese, and ducks ; and lastly, pigeons. Poultry properly so called, i e. chickens and pullets, are in cookery of the greatest use, not only by the particular properties of their succulent and delicate flesh, but also in a still greater measure, by their natural product : the egg. Eggs indeed being, in a manner, of absolute necessity in regard to culinary operations. Poultry, as far as I know, is to be found all over the world, but under very different conditions. The breeds not being the same, the products of course are far from possessing the same qualities. England and France are the countries, the best provided in this respect. By the extreme, and intelligent care taken for their reproduction, chickens, pullets, capons, and turkeys, are there brought to an unquestion- able, unsurpassed perfection. The introduction of foreign breeds, and the crossing of these breeds with those of our own countries, have had their natural result, the production of the most valuable sorts, varieties, and specimens, as well in regard to their fecundity, as for the superior quality of their flesh. This is however no exclusive privilege, but freely to be shared by all nations ; for wherever poultry is produced, it may be fattened, and the breed improved, and brought continually nearer to perfection. Bari poultry is only met with, where no trouble is taken for its amelioration, or where the methods applicable are unknown. The chickens of Brussels in Bel gium, and of Sagan in Prussia, the pullets of Brest in France, those of Slovenka in Russia, the geese of Silesia and Wurtemberg, the ducks of Toulouse, the capons of Kyèv, Florence, and Styria ; give unquestionableCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 294 proof, that poultry may become superior on the most opposite quarters of our continent. The art of fattening- poultry, and of improving its breeds, is a matter purely of science, and of care, well understood; not, as might be imagined, a question of climate. In cookery the use of poultry is of the highest importance (whether applied as material for a cooking-stock, or whether coming into the plan- ning of a dinner); by the same title, and in quite as high a rank, as fish, butcher’s meat, and game. Good poultry, under whatever conditions, will be always well received at every table; for its meat is at once nutritive, and easy of digestion. Game also is common to all countries of Europe; but its species are numerous, and varied ; each country producing its own with more or less perfection. Game is divided into two main categories ; bipeds, and quadrupeds; but the individual species, that compose them, are innumerable. Game is of great importance in cookery, as well for its real value, as for a variety in the work. 695. Paupiettes of turkey, Roman fashion (D. 108). — Take out the two fillets of a raw turkey ; cut off the skin, and the bone of the pinions ; divide the flesh into slices, taking five on each side; beat slightly, pare them square; season, and lard them with fine cut bacon, only on one side .and one end ; then mask the other side with a thin layer of raw force-meat with fine-herbs ; roll these strips into the shape of‘paupiettes’, leaving the larding outside; tie them with strong thread, and place them, one beside the other, in a stewpan spread with bacon. Add vegetables and aromatics; moisten to half their height with good clarified broth, cover them with bacon ; reduce the liquid to half, and draw the stewpan on a moderate fire, with warm ashes on the lid. A quarter of an hour after, remove the bacon, baste the ‘paupiettes’ with their own stock, and glaze them nicely, by encreasing the fire on the lid, or by pushing them into a hot oven; drain them afterwards, trim both ends, and place them in a stewpan. Dilute their stock with a little Avhite wine ; let it boil, strain, skim of! the fat, and introduce into it three gills of reduced ‘velouté’-sauce ; add a few trim- mings of truffles ; and when reduced sufficiently, pass it through a tammy.295 POULTRY. — TURKEY. On the other hand, prepare a little force-meat, with the trimmings of the fillets, and with this, mould some ‘quenelles’ with a spoon ; arrange them evenly on the bottom of a buttered flat stewpan, and poach them in salted water. Prepare a nice ‘pâté-chaud’ crust ; when done, fix it on a dish, and keep it hot. When ready to serve, till the pie-crust to height with a good ‘risot’, finished with Fig. 108. a ‘julienne’ of raw truffles ; smooth the top, whereon dish the ‘paupiettes’ in a circle, and in an upright position. Fill also with rice the hollow formed by the paupiettes ; and place on it upright the ‘quenelles’. Now put a large truffle on the top, and a small one on each of the ‘paupiettes’; mask the quenelles lightly with a little sauce, the remainder of which send in a sauceboat. 696. Cold turkey, with jelly (D. 109). — Fill a nice turkey with Fig. 109. bread-stuffing ; wrap it up in paper, and roast it to a nice color ; then take it off the fire, and let it cool. Cut off the tip of the legs at the joint, and put a ruffle to the drum-stick-bones. Slip afterwards the two fillets off the breast ; cut them up in slices, and put them back into place ; glaze the turkey with a paste-brush, dish it on a layer of chopped aspic-jelly, surround it on both sides with nice-shaped ‘croûtons’ of jelly, and place on each end a bunch of water-cresses.296 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. If the legs must also be carved, they should previously be slipped off, and divided into three parts ; then put back into form, and into place, supporting them with small silver-skewers. This method answers very well. 697. Pinions of turkey, turtle-sauce. — Take about twenty pinions of turkey, cut above the. second joint; singe, and bone to the second joint; press the flesh into the hollow left by the bones. Blanch the pinions until boiling ; steep them in cold water, wipe them on a cloth, and pluck them. Melt two tablespoonfuls of lard in a stewpan ; add to it the pinions, eight ounces of streaky bacon, blanched and cut up in squares, and two or three small onions; fry the meats and onions on a good fire ; season, and toss. When the pinions are of a nice color, drain, off the fat, sprinkle over a handful of flour, and moisten to height with white wine and gravy ; add a bunch of parsley with aromatics, and a handful of trimmings of fresh mushrooms; keep the stew boiling for a few minutes, and then draw it over a moderate fire. On the other hand, divide a cooked calf’s brain in two pieces, each of which divide into middling-sized squares; which put into a stewpan with two dozen cooked button-mushrooms, and the same of small poached ‘quenelles’ of fowl or veal. When the pinions are done, drain them with a fork, and add them to the garnish. Skim the fat off the sauce, strain it into a flat stewpan ; reduce it, stirring, and mixing in, by degrees, a quarter of a glass of madeira ; finish it with a pinch of cayenne, and pour it over the garnishes. Simmer the stew, without letting it boil ; dish it up, and sprinkle over cut-up gerkins. 698. Fillets of turkey, ‘à l’écarlate’ (D. 110). — Take out the fillets of a raw turkey, remove the skin away, pare them of the superficial epidermis, heat them slightly with the blade of a knife; salt, wrap them up in thin layers of bacon, and arrange them in a flat stewpan with lard, to fry them without moisture, keeping them underdone. Let them cool, then divide them into regular fillets, cut from their whole length; pare these fillets to an equal form; season, mask with a white ‘chaufroix’-sauce, and set them evenly on a baking-sheet, one beside the other, allowing the sauce to cool. On the other hand, off the length of a cooked ox-tongue, cut some fillets, of the same size as those of turkey ; make some flutings on the curved side, and place them, one beside the other, on a baking-sheet ; glaze them with a thin coating of aspic- jelly, slightly reddened with cochineal, and keep them on the ice. Meanwhile, fix a pain-vert* on a dish, mask its top with paper, fix on its centre a small support in wood or in fat, and surround it with salad of vegetables, thickened * A ‘paiu-vert’ is a foundation made of bread, rice, or wood ; and masked with green butter or fat.POULTRY. — TURKEY. 207 with mayonnaise. Dish up the fillets of turkey, and of tongue, on the ‘pain-vert’, alternated and in upright position, one white and one red; set on the top of the support a small vase, cast in fat; surround the ‘pain-vert’ with ‘croûtons’ of aspic- jelly, and send up separately a sauceboatful of mayonnaise. T>99. Young turkey roasted, with water-cresses (D. 111). — A young turkey, by the daintiness of its flesh, may be ranked among the most Fig. 111. distinguished roasts, the spit being the only preparation worthy of it. A young turkey, or turkey-poult, is good to eat as soon as two months old. Draw a young turkey; singe, pluck and truss it; lard or cover it with bacon: m both cases roast it, basting only with butter ; roast it on an ecpial fire for thirty or forty minutes, keeping it underdone. At the last moment, salt, take it off the spit, remove the string, and dish it up; send up the stock of the dripping-pan, strained,298 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. and a plate of salted water-cresses, seasoned with salt and vinegar. A young turkey is carved as any other turkey. 700. Legs of turkey-hen, Italian fashion. -— Cut four large legs of turkey, keeping the skin as long as possible; bone them, letting adhere to each of them a little bit of bone, forming a sort of handle (manche) ; fill them with some firm poultry-force-meat, mixed with cooked truffles and ham, cut in dice ; sew them round in the shape of ‘ballotines’, wrap them up in bacon, and let them boil in white stock. When done, let them half-cool with a light weight on, then untruss them, and carve them ‘en entaille’; warm them quite gently, basting them with a part of the reduced cooking-stock; drain them on a baking-sheet, sprinkle over bread.crumb, baste with a little melted butter, let them glaze in a hot oven, and put a ruffle on the ends of bone ; dish these ‘ballotines’ on a garnish of ‘risot’, ranged in a pyramid on a dish ; serve separately a little brown-sauce, reduced, but thickened only a little. 701. Roasted turkey, with black olives. — This method of stuffing turkeys belongs to the south of France, and to Italy, where olives are plentiful and very good ; the black pickled olives are usually preferred to all others. A turkey thus stuffed is a roast little known in the north, yet it is well worthy to be offered to epicures. The process of stuffing turkeys with olives, consists in simply drawing these, and introducing them into the turkey without stoning. Sew the openings up, and roast the turkey on the spit, or in the oven, the breast covered with bacon, or merely wrapped up in paper. 702. Turkey skewers, Turkish fashion. — Take the raw flesh of the breast of a turkey; remove from it skin and sinews, divide the flesh in little squares, put them into a kitchen-basin ; season with salt and pepper, then moisten with butter or oil, and the juice of some lemons. An hour afterwards, file the squares on to little skewers, wrap the meat up with a lamb’s caul. Broil these skewers at a moderate fire, bringing the meat back into form, then serve them on a hot dish. / 703. Fillets of turkey, Milan fashion. — Take out the two breast- fillets of a small raw turkey ; trim the sinewy skin away, cut them up slanting lengthwise, thus obtaining some slices, as long as a fillet of chicken ; beat, pare, season them; dip them into beaten eggs, and roll them in fresh bread-crumbs. Pour six ounces of clarified butter into a flat pan, arrange the fillets on the bottom, set the pan over a brisk fire, and fry the fillets quickly on both sides ; dish them in a circle, baste with the butter wherein they have been cooked, and fill the centre with a garnish of rice ‘à la Milanaise’.299 POULTRY. — TURKEY. 704. Turkey larded, with purée of chestnuts. — Singe and draw a nice small turkey; break up the breast-bone, cut up the legs to the junction with the thighs ; disengage the bone of these, to shorten it half an inch. Shorten the legs, after being singed, and introduce them into the thighs by the opening of the drum- sticks. Fill now the crop of the turkey with beef-suet chopped with bread-crumbs ; truss with strong string ; singe anew, to set the skin of the breast and legs ; and lard with bacon cut up in middling-sized fillets. Place the turkey in a braising-pan, spread with trimmings of bacon and vege- tables ; moisten to height with broth, and cover with a buttered paper. Two hours previous to serving, let the broth boil, and twenty minutes after, draw the braising- pan on a moderate fire, with warm ashes on the lid, and boil the turkey, basting often. At last, glaze the turkey on the breast by the aid of a paste-brush ; keep it at the entrance of the oven, letting it take a nice color; drain it, remove the string, dish it up, and surround it with a purée of chestnuts. Mix a little wine with the cooking-stock, skim off the fat, strain, work it to half-glaze, and pour it into a sauce-boat. If the turkey is to be carved on the dinner-table, dish the purée separately. 705. Christmas-turkey, Provence fashion. — In England, in the south of France, and in Italy, the turkey is the indispensable roast of a Christmas- dinner. In the North of Europe it is replaced by the goose. The preparation of this roast varies according to the local resources. It may indifferently be stuffed with truffles, bread-crumbs, rice, olives, chestnuts, sausages, and even ‘cepes’. The most distinguished of these garnishes is naturally that composed of fresh truffles ; but black olives and chestnuts, if more popular, are not less esteemed. Get a nice tender turkey, kept hanging, but not too long ; draw it care- fully, wipe it inwardly with a cloth, and stuff it with small fresh sausages, and some large chestnuts, roasted but not fully, and peeled so as to leave possible no hollow in the body. Fill also the crop with sausages, after having cut off the neck, leaving the skin as long as possible ; sew this on to the back ; sew up likewise the inferior aper- ture, and lastly truss the turkey; singe it on the breast, to set the skin and flesh; lard it with bacon, and roast it. If a roasting spit be handy, able to support its weight, and turn the turkey; it does not need telling, that this is the mode of cooking preferable to all others. If, on the contrary, there is none, the tui’key may be roasted in a large roasting-pan ; but in any case, it must be plentifully basted with good fat or butter.* A quarter of an * Whatever may he the roasts cooked on the spit, before an open tire, they must be basted, during the whole process of their cooking, with butter or clarified fat.300 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. hour before taking it off the tire, remove the paper, in which it must be wrapped up, and allow it to take color; as soon as done, salt it ; take it off, and serve it on a large dish. The length of time for cooking a large turkey varies, from one hour and a quarter, to an hour and a half ; the main difficulty consists in getting all the parts of it equally colored, a result not the least desirable to succeed in ; as the nice appear- ance of a roast of poultry is a quality indispensable to it. The most delicate piece, if overdone, black or burned, even superficially, makes but a poor appearance on a table. With the roasted turkey, send up the drippings, strained, skimmed of the fat, mixed up with a little glaze, and reduced. In Provence a salad of fresh white tender celery is sent up with this roast. Carving of the turkey. — A roasted turkey, even when middling-sized, if to be carved on the table, must be sent with gravy on the dish. If the turkey is large, the legs of it should only be carved, when absolutely necessary; for it is better pre- viously to send round the best part of it, the breast. The two pinions are first slipped off to render the carving easier, then the breast is cut up in thin slices, which are placed evenly on a dish, and afterwards surrounded with the garnish, if there be any. If the legs are required, they should be previously slipped off the carcass, by passing the knife into the joint, then the thickest part of them is divided into three parts. 706. Turkey with ‘nouilles’. — Turkeys, only when too old to serve for roast, are boiled in broth or gravy. Draw a turkey, truss it with the legs turned in, cover the breast with a layer of fat bacon, and place it in a stewpan with melted bacon or lard ; set the stewpan on a moderate fire, fry the turkey, turning it all over ; when of a nice color, moisten to three-parts its height with broth ; add three onions, a piece of celery-root, a few sprigs of aromatics, cloves and peppercorns; let the liquid boil, and ten minutes after remove it back, placing warm ashes on its lid, so as to finish cooking the turkey gently. When done, the cooking-stock should be reduced to half-glaze; strain it into another stewpan, skim off part of the fat, and thicken with a few spoonfuls of good tomata-sauce ; which let simmer on the side of the fire. When ready to serve, remove the string, place the turkey on a garnish of ‘nouille’, finished with butter and parmesan ; baste it with a few spoonfuls of sauce, and send up the remainder in a sauce-boat. Carving. — If the turkey is to be carved at the dinner-table, it must be placed on a dish, without gravy or garnish; slip off then, first of all, the two legs, take away the drum-stick, and divide the thickest part of the legs, each into three parts; then bring the breast nearer, cut off the pinions at the joint, and carve the breastPOULTRY. — TURKEY. 301 in tliin slices; which, as well as the pieces of the leg, arrange on the garnished dish containing the ‘nouilles’. 707. Turkey, boiled, à l’écarlate (D. 112). — Singe a turkey, draw, till it with a stuffing of bread-crumbs and beef-suet (chopped), so as to get it quite round ; truss the turkey, as for boiling, and place it in an oblong stewpan with aromatics, peppercorns, cloves, and a few sprigs of fresh celery-leaves. Two hours previous to serving, moisten the turkey, to its height, with hot broth and toppings; set the stewpan on the fire; let the liquid boil up, cover the turkey Fig. 112. with a buttered paper, and boil it for two hours, covered, and on a moderate fire, that the cooking-stock may not be reduced too much. On the other hand, boil two pickled ox-tongues, being careful to put them on the tire soon enough to be done at the same time with the turkey, and keep them in their stock till ready to serve. When the turkey is done, strain the cooking-stock, and skim off the fat, which pour over the turkey. With a pint of turkey cooking-stock prepare a little white-sauce (see No. 159); stir the sauce on the fire, to thicken ; as soon as boiling, take it off, thicken with three yolks of eggs, boil without allowing it to boil up, and pass it through a sieve. When ready to serve, drain turkey and tongues, remove the string from the turkey, and set it on an oblong dish ; make a decoration on the breast with taragon- leaves, and surround it, at its base, with slices of tongue cut off the thickest parts ; pour on the bottom of the dish a little good gravy, and pour the sauce into a sauceboat. The dish itself is placed on a hot-water-dish.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 302 708. Turkey giblets, à la chipolata. — By giblets are understood the neck, pinions, legs, gizzard, and liver, of turkeys or other poultry. The pinions and legs are singed, the hard skin of the inside of the gizzards is taken out, after their being cleansed ; and the gall is removed from the liver. Take two or three turkey-giblets, (minus the livers) previously cleansed ; scald them in boiling water, drain, wipe, and put them into a stewpan, with butter, and eight ounces of streaky bacon in pieces ; set the stewpan on a brisk fire ; season the giblets, and fry them till of a nice color; then drain the fat off, shake over two tablespoonfuls of flour; and two minutes after moisten to height with broth, stirring until boiling ; and then draw the pan on a moderate tire. One hour after, add to the giblets two dozen small onions, the same of small carrots and turnips, blanched and cut up in balls or quarters, a bunch of parsley, and aromatics, cloves, pepper- corns, and lastly, three tablespoonfuls of cognac. Boil then meat and vegetables, on a moderate lire, with warm ashes on the lid. Ten or twelve minutes previous to taking the stew off the tire, add to it fifteen small ‘cipollata’ sausages, and the turkey- livers blanched, and cut up in pieces : continue boiling, and at the last moment send up the stew in a deep dish. 709. ‘Pain’ of poultry, with jelly (D. 113). — Take ten minion- fillets of chickens, pare, beat them slightly; ornament the half of them with slices of truffles, which insert in some incisions made transversally, at an equal distance, on the smoothest side of the fillets ; salt, arrange them in a flat stewpan, with clarified butter; and put in the fillets, which are to remain plain. Poach these fillets over a brisk fire, preserving them straight; drain immediately, and let them cool, applied against the interior sides of a dome-mould, thus giving them a curved shape. When the fillets are cold, pare them carefully, wipe the mould, and embed it in pounded ice. Ornament the six white fillets with a ‘Montpellier’-butter, squeezed through a cornet of paper; dip them evenly into half-set jelly, and apply them against the sides of the mould, alternating those decorated with butter, and those with truffles. Fill the intervals between the fillets likewise with half-set jelly, then fill the hollow of the mould with a preparation of ‘pain’ of poultry with taragon. Coat (chemiser) with jelly, ten or twelve small ‘dariole’- moulds, the bottom of which is decorated by a round of truffle ; fill the hollow with the same preparation of ‘pain’ of poultry, and keep them on ice for half an hour. When ready to serve, dip quickly the dome-mould in warm water, wipe, and turn it out on a ‘pain-vert’, proportionate to the size of the mould, not being too wide.303 POULTRY. - TURKEY. Dish round it the small ‘aspics’, and insert on the top of the dome a ‘hâtelet’- skewer, garnished with a minion-fillet and a round truffle.

Turkey with truffles, Toulouse fashion (D. 114). - The tat turkeys of Toulouse are those most in renown in the south of France. This roast, as Fig. 114. served in Toulouse, and such as it is represented in the drawing, is one of the most distinguished ones to be offered to ‘gourmets’. Peel about fifteen raw truffles, and put them into a stewpan. Pound half a pound of fresh bacon with the truffles-trimmings, and pass it through a sieve. Draw a good turkey, not over fat, but fleshy ; stuff it with the bacon, sew up the openings ; truss it, wrap it up in buttered paper, and roast it on the spit, basting with butter.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 304 When the turkey is about done, remove the paper to let the turkey take color ; then salt, and take it off the lire. Place the turkey on a dish, resting on thick slices of toasted bread ; surround it on the sides with a dozen ortolans roasted at the mo- ment, and group the truffles on both ends, seasoned and likewise cooked at the mo- ment with madeira wine. Send up separately a sauceboat of good gravy. 711. Galantine of turkey, with jelly. — Get a middling-sized turkey, not too fat, nor too fine ; that is, one of those, which cannot be served roasted. Singe it, cut off the tip of the legs and pinions, split the skin all along the neck, up to the head, cutting it underneath the head ; and bone the turkey entirely. Remove part of thé meat from the legs and fillets, cut this meat in large dice ; which place in a kitchen-basin, season, mix with them double their volume of blanched bacon, and a third of raw ham in dice ; baste the whole with half a glass of madeira. Cut up in pieces the back-bones of the turkey, put them into a large stewpan with all the bones, trimmings, and fragments of meat, (but in no case of mutton), two boned and scalded calf’s feet; add vegetables, aromatics, and spices; cover the whole with light broth, let it boil up, skim and remove it back. On the other hand, have prepared a raw mince of veal, composed of half lean meat and half fresh bacon ; add the meat of the turkey-legs, season with salt and spices ; when well chopped, pound it, put it into a kitchen-basin, and add to it the meat cut up in dice, and the bacon ; then fill with it the turkey, truss it to an oblong form, and wrap it up closely in a small napkin. Tie both ends firmly at the level of the ‘galantine’, and tie this also on the centre with two or three turns of string. One hour after the cooking-stock is in ebullition, plunge the ‘galantine’ into the liquid, to boil gently for two hours and a half; drain it afterwards on a dish, unpack it and pack it up again in tire same cloth, being refreshed in water; tie, and let it cool with a light weight over it. Take it out of the napkin, pare, glaze it with a paste-brush, and serve whole or cut up, surrounded with aspic-jelly, either chopped or in ‘croutons’. Poultry aspic-jelly. — As soon as the ‘galantine’ is taken out of its stock, strain this through a sieve, carefully skim off the fat, and try a small part of it on ice, to ascertain its consistency; if it seem too weak, mix with it a few leaves of isinglass dissolved in water. When the stock is about cold, drain it off into a stewpan. Chop a pound of lean beef (to four quarts of liquid), add to it two whole eggs, a glass of white wine, and half a glass of madeira ; mix this preparation with the cooking-stock of the ‘galantine’, adding also a handful of chervil, and some sprigs of aromatics. Whip the stock over the fire, until very hot ; then remove the stewpan on the side of the fire, and keep it covered until beginning to boil. Then take the stewpan back, letting the liquid only simmer gently. Twenty minutes after, strain it through a305 POULTRY. — FOWLS. napkin again, skim the fat, and let it cool. Whisk three whites of eggs in a stewpan, until a little frothy ; dilute them with the jelly ; which pour in gently ; add to the liquid two tablespoonfuls of madeira, and a few cloves ; and whisk over the fire until boiling ; at the first bubbling draw the stewpan on warm ashes, cover it, put some live embers on the lid, and keep it thus for a quarter of an hour; the jelly should then be very clear. Strain it through a napkin, or a bag, until very limpid ; pour it into a well-tinned mould, and let it cool on ice, to be cut afterwards. 712. Montglas of poulard (pullet) with croustade (D. 115). Take the meat off the breast of a cooked pullet; pare, divide it into slices, an eighth Fig. 115. of an inch thick ; which slices trim into squares, giving them the length of an inch ; divide these squares again into fillets of equal length and thickness ; place them in a stewpan ; add a third their volume of pickled tonguq and mushrooms, all of which cooked and cut up. Pour into a flat stewpan three or four gills of ‘bechamel-sauce, add to it a few pieces of raw ham, let the sauce reduce, stirring, and introducing gradually half a glassful of good double cream; when it is succulent, and of nice consistence, take out the ham, and mix it (off the fire) with the previously prepared ‘montglas’. Warm the ‘ragout’ without allowing it to boil, season, and keep it in the ‘bain-marie’. On the drawing this ‘montglas’ is represented, dished in a ‘croustade’ of bread ; composed of three pieces : the cup, the foot, and the basis. These pieces are fried one by one to an equal color, then fastened together perpendicularly, and supported by small skewers applied from within. The cup of the ‘croustade’ can only be emptied, after having been fried. Then the hollow is masked with a raw ‘quenelle’-force- meat ; the ‘croustade’ is fixed to the dish with ‘repère’ ; which, as well as the force- meat, is allowed to dry at the mouth of a moderate oven ; then dish the ‘montglas’ in the hollow formed by the cup.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 30(3 713. Poulard (pullet) in galantine. — Take a middling-sized pullet ; singe it; cut off the leg-bones and the pinions at the joint ; split the skin up the back, from one end to the other ; remove the pouch, and cut the skin of the crop under the head, to get it as long as possible ; slip off the legs and wings from the body, disen- gage the flesh of the breast, detaching it completely from the back-bones ; then bone the legs ; cut the thickest of the flesh off, as well as that of the breast ; divide it in middling-sized squares, which put into a kitchen-basin, with an equal quantity of tongue and fat bacon; both being cooked and cut up as the pullet’s flesh. Add thereto five or six raw truffles, peeled, and cut in square fillets ; and at last a hand- ful of peeled pistachios ; season the whole with salt and good spices, and baste with a little sherry. Chop fine the meat of the legs, with some lean meat of veal ; add to it an equal quantity of fat bacon, likewise chopped fine ; season the force-meat with salt and good spices, put it into a mortar to pound it, and pass it through a sieve ; then place this force-meat in the basin with the squares of pullet, truffles, and tongue ; with the preparation fill the boned pullet, sewing it up completely to an elongated form. Wrap it in a small napkin, tie it up, and boil, for an hour and a half, in a stock pre- pared with the back, proceeding as directed for a‘galantine’of turkey. When the ‘galantine’ is done, take it out of the stock ; unpack it, and pack it up again slightly in the same napkin, previously refreshed; then let it cool under a slight weight ; remove the napkin afterwards, glaze, and dish the ‘galantine’ up, either whole or in slices ; surround with ‘croûtons’ of aspic, or simply with aspic-jelly, being prepared with the ‘galantine’-stock (see No. 711). If the ‘galantine is cut in slices, it should be glazed, after being put back into form, so that the glaze may support it. 714. Stewed turkey, Nancy fashion. — Get the giblets of two tur- keys; cleanse, and scald them until boiling; then drain them, and keep their livers aside. Place the remainder of the giblets ; necks, pinions, and gizzards ; in a stewpau with chopped bacon, and a sliced onion ; season, and fry them on a moderate fire; when they set, moisten to height with broth, and a glass of white wine; add to it a few sprigs of aromatics, and cook them on a moderate fire, till three-parts done; then drain them, pare, put them back into a stewpan, and moisten with their own liquor, strained ; add to the stew half a pound of washed rice, well-drained on a sieve, eight ounces of raw ham in small dice, and five or six spoonfuls of tomata- sauce ; set the stewpan on the fire, cover it, let the liquid boil, and draw the pan on the side of the fire, with warm ashes on its lid : twenty-five minutes after, dish up. 715. ‘Pain’ of poultry, ‘à la Duchesse’ (D. 116). — Let me recom- mend to all cooks this simple preparation, giving so excellent results.307 POULTRY. — FOWLS.

With this preparation stuff two fat pullets, and truss with the legs in, as for an entree; cover with bacon, and put into a stewpan, garnished with trim- mings of bacon, vegetables, and aromatics ; moisten, to three parts their height, with clarified broth; set the stewpan on a brisk fire, boiling the broth for five minutes; and then remove it on a moderate fire. When the pullets are about done, drain them, and remove the bacon. Pass the cooking-stock through a sieve, skim off the fat, reduce it to half-glaze, and pour it again into a stewpan with the pullets ; which finish cooking, basting often, to give them a nice light-brown color. On the other hand, boil the truffles on a brisk fire, for seven or eight minutes, with two glasses of madeira, and a bunch of parsley with aromatics. As soon as done, drain the stock, mix it with double its volume of the pullet-stock ; add to it a few trimmings of truffles, reduce to half-glaze, and thicken it with a little brown- sauce; strain it into a stewpan, keeping it hot. When the pullets are done, drain them, remove the strings, and set them on an oblong dish, edged with ‘nouille’-paste or English-paste ; applying them almost upright, against a ‘support’ of fried bread, fixed on the centre, and masked with poached force-meat; resting the upper part of the breast on a layer of force-meat, poached on the dish, the back against the support. Between the pullets set a large ‘quenelle’ studded with truffles, place on each side of it three lai’ge truffles ; garnish the hollow between the pullets with a few cocks’-combs and button-mushrooms. Insert two garnished ‘hfitelet’-skewers on each side of the ‘croustade’, exactly above the large ‘quenelle’ ; insert two more on the top, slanting opposite ways ; and adorn the top of the support with a large mushroom. Mask lightly the breast of the pullets with a little sauce, the remainder of which send up in a sauceboat. • This dish is arranged, so as to go on the table. The pullets should be carved on the side-board, to be handed round to the guests. Dish-borders are only adapted for dishes not intended to be handed to the guests. 717. ‘Croquettes, à la Gastronome’ (D. 118). — Peel four fresh truffles, cut them up in small dice, which put into a small stewpan, and keep covered ; keep also the trimmings by. Pare the cooked meat of a pullet, trimming away the skin and hard parts ; cut it up in small dice, like the truffles ; the quantity of meat shoidd be double that of the truffles. Put the bones and trimmings of the pullet into a small stewpan, with the trim- mings of truffles , and three gills of gravy ; add aromatics, cover the stewpan, set it on a brisk tire, and reduce the liquid to half; after which pass it through a sieve. Pour into a flat stewpan three gills of good ‘béchamel’-sauce, add to the sauce a few pieces of raw ham, set the pan on the tire, and reduce the sauce with a spoon ; a few309 POULTRY. — FOWLS. minutes after, gradually introduce into it the extract of chicken and truffles ; then continue the reduction, until the sauce be succulent, and of a nice consistence ; now take the ham out, add the truffles to the sauce, and two minutes after, draw it off the fire, to mix with it the ‘salpicon’ of pullet. The preparation should be compact ; season it with a little nutmeg, pour it on a baking-sheet, spread in a square form, half an inch thick. Fig. 118. The preparation being firm, cut it up in long squares, warm the bottom of the baking-sheet, to detach the parts cut; roll them, on a table sprinkled with bread- crumbs , to a cork-like shape ; dip them in well beaten eggs, and bread-crumb again afterwards, plunging them (but a few at a time) into hot hog’s lard. As soon as the ‘croquettes’ are of a nice color, drain them on a cloth, dish them up on a folded napkin, and surround with two groups of fried parsley. 718. ‘Poulards’, English fashion (D. 119). — Truss two pullets, as Fig. 119. for entrée, with the feet turned under the skin ; cover the breast with bacon, place them in a stewpan, strewn with trimmings of bacon and vegetables ; moisten to height with white broth ; cover with buttered paper, and cook them in a moderate oven.310 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. Meanwhile, boil in water two small ox-tongues, to be done at the same time with the pullets; when ready to serve, drain them and remove the skin. Drain also the poulards, to remove the strings and bacon. Fix on the centre of an oblong dish a square support of fried bread, but longer than wide ; mask each end of the dish next the support with a layer of raw force-meat, poach it at the mouth of the oven, then dish the poulards, turning their breast towards the force-meat, and resting their back against the support of bread. Dish the tongues upright on the sides, garnish the intervals, on the right with french- beans in lozenges, boiled in water; on the left, with small glazed carrots. Garnish each end with a ‘bouquet’ of cauliflowers in flowrets, boiled in salted water; and insert on the top of the support a ‘hâtelet’-skewer, simply garnished with a large but- ton mushroom. Glaze the tongues with a paste-brush, mask slightly the breast of the poulards with a little white-sauce, prepared with their stock, pouring the remainder into a sauceboat. This dish is arranged to figure on the table, the poulards should lie carved on the sideboard. 719. Poulard, with oysters. — Draw, and truss a poulard, as for boiling; rub the breast with lemon, cover it with thin slices of fat bacon, and put it into a stewpan, the bottom of which is masked with trimmings of bacon, and sliced vegetables; moisten to height with good broth and toppings, and a glass of light white wine ; add a few peppercorns, cover with a round of buttered paper, and boil on a moderate fire. On the other hand, put three dozen large oysters in a stewpan on the fire, and at the first bubbling take it off ; two minutes after, drain the oysters with a skimmer, pass their liquor through a sieve, and let it settle. When the poulard is done, pass the cooking-stock through a sieve, and skim off the fat. Melt five ounces of butter in a stewpan, introduce into it the same quantity of flour, thus forming a light paste»; when smooth, add to it three yolks of eggs, and dilute it gradually, with half a quart of the stock, and some of the oysters’ liquor: set the stewpan on a moderate tire, stirring carefully, to dilute the paste. When the sauce is well thickened, and near to ebullition ; take it off the tire, and pass it through a tine sieve, or a tammy, into another stewpan ; add to it the juice of one lemon, with a piece of butter in small parts, and at last the oysters, previously washed and bearded ; remove the string from the poulard, place it on a dish, mask it with a little sauce, and pour the garnish round. 720. ‘Pain’ of poulard, ‘à la Conti’ (D. 120). — Get a dozen mi- nion-fillets of poulard, pare them as usual, beat slightly, score the smooth side, trans- versally slipping into each incision a truffle cut to a crescent ; apply the fillets311 POULTRY. — FOWLS. (inwardly) against the buttered sides of a dome-mould, with a cylinder ; applying the decorated part of the fillets against the sides, and the pointed end on the base of the cylinder. Fill the hollow with a good raw chicken ‘quenelle’ force-meat ; cover the top with a round of buttered paper, and poach the ‘pain’ in the ‘bain-marie’ for forty minutes. Fig. 120. When ready to serve, turn the ‘pain’ out on a dish, garnish the hollow of the cylinder with sliced truffles and white cocks’-combs, forming on the top a small circle, and setting in the centre a round truffle; mask the ‘pain’ with a little white- sauce, reduced with the trimmings of truffles, and pour the remainder into a sauce- boat. This entree is dished up to go on the table, and it is placed on a round hot-water dish. 721. Poulards (pullets) of ‘la Bresse’, roasted (D. 121). Fig. 121. England and France are the first countries in the world for the production of good poultry : those of the old province of ‘la Bresse’ (like the Norfolk turkeys) leave nothing to desire.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 312 Pullets of six to nine months are those to be preferred, when fat enough. The cooking of poultry at the roasting tire, is an operation not to be treated carelessly; as the roast is one of the most essential dishes in a dinner, one of which every body willingly partakes ; therefore the highest attention of the cook should be bestowed on this preparation, under penalty of compromising the dinner in the judgment of the guests, and giving them a poor opinion of his science. Unless covered with slices of fat bacon, a roast of poultry should always be wrapped up in buttered paper, aiding it to support the first action of the fire; while cooking, it must be frequently basted with butter or lard. Truss two pullets, and cover them with thin slices of bacon ; pierce them with the spit through their length ; and tic them up by the legs ; wrap them in buttered paper, and roast them for one hour, basting often ; when about done, take off the paper and bacon, allowing the meat of the breast to take color. Salt the pullets, take them off the spit, remove the string, and carve each of them in five parts : if more than usually large, the centre-piece of the breast should be cut in two. Pare the backs, divide, and range them on the centre of an oblong dish ; cut up the legs at the joint without separating the parts, and dish them round the backs, two on each side; on these lay the wings, and on the centre the breast-pieces. Surround the roast with water-cresses, and serve separately a sauceboat of good gravy, and another of bread-sauce. 722. Skewers of ‘poulards’ livers. — Remove the gall of a dozen good pullets’ livers; divide each of them into four parts, place them in a kitchen- basin, and season with salt and spices ; add to it an equal volume of squares of fat bacon, not too thick, and cut of the size of the livers ; sprinkle over these meats two tablespoonfuls of cooked fine-herbs, then run them through with small metal or wooden skewers, pointed on one end, alternating the liver with bacon. When the skewers are completely garnished, roll them in clarified butter, then in bread-crumb, and broil them for a quarter of an hour at a moderate fire, turning them on all sides ; then dish them up. 723. Poulard (pullet) roasted, Toulouse-sauce. — Draw and singe a fine fat pullet (poularde), truss, and roast it, basting frequently with lard; when done, salt, take it off the fire, dish up, and send up separately the following sauce : Toulousc-sauce. — This sauce is a genuine local speciality, very agreeable and appetising, for those who have no repugnance to garlic. Boil in salted water two dozen peeled cloves of garlic ; drain, put them into a stewpan, with tho fat of the roast pullet, to give them a nice color; then moistenFOWLS. POULTRY. 313 them with about a pint of good broth ; which reduce gently to half, cooking at the same time the garlic. Now thicken the liquid with a handful of dry, and pounded bread-crumb, add to it the pulp of two bitter or Seville oranges, cut in slices, but free | of peel or pips ; simmer the sauce for a few minutes, add a little gravy of the roast, skim off the fat, and pass it through a sieve ; then send up the sauce with the pullet. 724. Pullets’ livers in cases. — Get eight fat livers of pullet, remove the gall, plunge them into boiling water, to poach without ebullition ; drain them on i a cloth, pare them slightly, and divide each of them in two. Take a few chickens’ livers; fry them with lard, together with the trimmings of the pullets’ livers; let ; them cool, and pound them with an equal quantity of fat bacon chopped tine. Season the preparation, and pass it through a sieve; then add to it two tablespoonfuls of ‘quenelle’-force-meat, and four of cooked line-herbs, onions, mushrooms, and truffles; introduce into it a few spoonfuls of melted meat-glaze, and with half of the pre- paration mask the bottom and sides of eight small (either square or round) paper- cases, previously oiled. Twenty-five minutes previous to serving, fry quickly the pullet-livers in a frying-pan, with a little butter, and two tablespoonfuls of white wine ; the wine being reduced, remove the livers, set them on a plate, and baste them with a paste-brush dipped in glaze. Divide then each half-liver in two, and place two of these pieces in each of the cases, mask them at once with another layer of force-meat, and lay , the cases on a small baking-sheet ; cover them with a piece of oiled paper, and warm them at the entrance of a moderate oven, for eighteen or twenty minutes ; then take them out, pour over a little reduced brown-sauce, and dish them up. 725. Terrine of pullets’ livers. — Peel four or five raw truffles, cut them in large dice, and lay them in a kitchen-basin, with six ounces of cooked fat- bacon, likewise cut in squares ; add to it ten or twelve good fat pullets’ livers ; season the meats with salt, spices, and fine-herbs pulverised ; baste them with a tablespoonful of madeira. .Slice half a calf’s liver, put it into a frying-pan, with two or three table- spoonfuls of rasped and melted bacon, a tablespoonful of shalots, and the trimmings of truffles ; season with salt and pepper, and fry them on a brisk tire, till well set. Moisten it then with four tablespoonfuls of madeira ; and two minutes after wards, take it off the fire, letting it cool ; then pound, and put it in a basin. Take the same quantity of fat bacon ; chop, pound, and mix it with the pounded liver ; season the preparation highly, and pass it through a sieve. Mask with thin slices of bacon the bottom, and all round the sides, of an earthen pie-dish (terrine à pâté)] which spread with some of the liver force-meat, then fill with the pullets’ livers, the bacon and truffles, arranging them in layers alternated with force-meat ; mask similarly the top with bacon, lay on it a bay-leaf, and cover theCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 314 pie-dish with its lid ; set it on a small baking-sheet, push it into a moderate oven, baste the preparation with the fat running out, and bake it for two hours ; then take the Terrine’ out, and let it cool, the lid being removed, with a small weight over it. Cleanse carefully the ‘terrine’, and iix it on a dish ; after having cut up the prepa- ration, surround it with chopped aspic-jelly, or some aspic ‘croutons’. 726. Poulard Of gourmets. — Get a good small poulard, fat and tender; which draw, wipe inwardly with a cloth, and singe it. Pound a piece of meat-glaze, of the size of an egg, with double its volume of good butter ; add to the preparation a pinch of taragon-leaves, and now introduce it into the poulard ; which truss, as for boiling, carefully stopping all the openings. Take a fresh pig’s bladder ; wash, wipe it with a cloth, and introduce into it the pullet ; tie up the opening, wrap the bladder up in a napkin ; which secure with string, and plunge into boiling water. Boil the pullet for two hours without interruption, drain it afterwards, unpack it, and place it on a hot dish, with a little of its own stock. Send up separately a boatful of ‘velouté’-sauce, mixed with taragon-leaves. 727. Capon of Caux, roasted ‘à la casserole’.— When the capons are young and tender, they had much better certainly be roasted ; but if the least doubt be entertained as to their being otherwise, they should be braised or roasted in a stewpan. Capons, like turkeys, may be stuffed with truffles, chestnuts, sausages, olives, or with a stuffing ‘à l’Anglaise’. Draw and truss a capon, put it into a stewpan, masked with eight ounces of fat bacon, cut in small pieces, and with a tablcspoonful of butter ; cover the stewpan, and set it on a brisk fire, giving the capon a nice color all over its surface ; then remove it on a moderate fire, with live embers on the lid, roasting the capon for one hour; drain it afterwards, salt it, and dish it up. Drain off the fat from the stewpan, pour in a little good gravy, reduce it to half-glaze, and strain it over the capon. 728. Mazarine of poultry (D. 122). — With about two gills of good milk, dilute four tablcspoonfuls of flour ; add to this a little salt, a little nutmeg, and a small piece of butter ; stir the liquid on the fire, in order to thicken it, so as to get a smooth and consistent ‘bouillie’. Then add to it a few fresh mushrooms washed and chopped, work the ‘bouillie’ briskly on the fire, till it be of a nice consistence ; pass it through a sieve, and place it in a small kitchen-basin. Pare the raw fillets of three chickens, cut them in pieces ; pound, and pass them through a sieve. Put the meat then back into the mortar, pound it again; now add to it a little piece of butter, and the same volume of the previously prepared ‘bouillie’, which last is introduced by degrees. Season the force-meat thoroughly, poach aPOULTRY. — FOWLS. 315 small part of it in boiling- water, in order to judge of its consistence : if it be too tirm, add a little ‘bouillie’ more. Butter a ‘charlotte’-mould shallow in shape, adorn the mould on the bottom, and on the top all round the sides, with a chain of rounds of truffle of a tine black color ; the rounds must not be too thin, but cut of an equal diameter. Fill the hollow of the mould with the force-meat already made, cover it on the top with a round of buttered paper, let it poach in the ‘bain-marie’ for forty minutes. Fig. 122. At serving-time, drain all the moisture of the mould, and turn the ‘mazarine’ out on a dish, in order to empty it from the top down to half its depth, leaving a sufficient thickness on the sides. Fill then the hollow with a ‘montglas’-garnish, composed of pickled tongue, truffles, and cooked poultry-breasts cut in fillets. Mask the garnish with a little good ‘velouté’-sauce, reduced with mushroom-essence ; pour on the bottom of the dish a little sauce, the remainder of which serve in a sauceboat. 729. Capon of Le-Mans, Paris fashion (D. 123). — The capons of Fig. 123. Styria, Ivyèv, and in France, those of Le-Mans, Lyon, and Toulouse, are the most renowned. Choose a fine fat capon ; draw it, without removing the fat of the rump. Get two pounds of good truffles, not too large, peel them, and keep them covered, to boil them, when wanted, with a little madeira. Pound the trimmings of316 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. these truffles with a piece of panada; add to this the half of a raw fat-liver, a few tablespoonfuls of scraped fat-bacon, and two whites of eggs ; season, and rub the preparation through a sieve. Stuff with it the capon, in a convex form, truss it with the legs stuck under the skin ; rub it with lemon, and cover with bacon. Place it in a stewpan, spread with trimmings of bacon and vegetables ; moisten to cover with white broth, place over it a buttered paper, and boil it gently. When ready to serve, drain the capon, remove the string; set it on a layer of poached force-meat on an oblong dish, and surround on both sides with a garnish of nice, white, cooked cocks’-combs. Pile the truffles up on each end of the dish, and send up separately a boatful of Velouté’- sauce prepared with the stock of the capon. This dish is to be placed on the dinner-table, and may be ornamented with garnished ‘hâtelet’- skewers. 730. Capon with rice, Provence fashion. — Truss a capon, as for boiling ; cover it with thin layers of fat bacon ; place it in a stewpan with broth and toppings from the ‘pot-au-feu’, hot, passed through a sieve, and of sufficient quantity to cover ; add a few peppercorns and cloves, put the lid on the stewpan, and boil the capon for an hour and a quarter on a moderate fire. Twenty minutes previous to serving, fry in a stewpan two tablespoonfuls of chopped onions ; peel a large tomata, take away the seed, chop, and mix it with the onion; then moisten it, three times its height, with the stock and toppings of the capon, passed through a sieve ; add a point of saffron, and a bunch of parsley ; cover the stewpan, and boil the rice for forty minutes ; it must be well cooked, but remain firm ; then season it with a little nutmeg, and dish it up. Drain the capon, place it on the rice, and serve. 731. Minion-fillets of poulard, Paris fashion (D. 124). — This entrée is easy, and less expensive, if, when one of fillets of pullet or chickens has been served the day before, the minion-fillets have been kept for use. Pick out the inner sinew of the minion-fillets, and remove the superficial epi- dermis ; beat them slightly with the handle of a knife dipped in water ; make in them small transversal incisions, into which insert some crescent-shaped truffles, sliced slantwise. The fillets being thus decorated, arrange them in a circle, in a buttered sauté-pan ; salt slightly, moisten with a paste-brush dipped in melted butter, and put them by. Prepare a little ‘quenelle’ force-meat, with poultry-meat, and the trimmings of the fillets (see No. 715). Butter the interior of a pyramid-mould, mask the bottom and sides with a layer of the previously prepared force-meat, about a third of an inch thick ; fill the hollow of the mould with a ‘ragout’ of poultry-livers, mixed with a few sliced truffles, and thickened with a few spoonfuls of brown-sauce, reduced with ma-317 POULTRY. — FOWLS. deira : the Tagout’ should be cold; cover it with a layer of force-meat, and poach the ‘pain’ in the ‘bain-marie’ for three quarters of an hour. When ready to serve, fry the minion-fillets on a brisk lire, only for a few se- conds, thus setting them ; drain immediately dry, and dish them up in a circular order, round the poached ‘pain’ of force-meat, meanwhile turned out on the centre Fig. 124. of a dish ; which mask slightly, as well as the bottom of it, with a little good wlnte- sauce ; and insert on the top a ‘hâtelet’-skewer, garnished with a nice cock’s comb and a truffle. This dish is placed on a hot-water dish. 732. Capons of Lully. — Draw two capons, singe them, cut up the leg- bones at the joint, disengage partly the meat of the leg-bone, and cut it half the length; then introduce the legs into the hollow. Fill the crop of the capons with a little raw ‘quenelle’ force-meat; truss them neatly with their legs straight, rub them with lemon, and cover them completely with bacon ; then place them in a stewpan, moisten to height with a ‘mirepoix’ with white wine ; boil them at a moderate tire, with the lid on ; and when done, drain, wrap them up in a damp cloth, and let them cool. On the other hand, prepare a garnish composed of round truffles, button-mush- rooms, and nice cocks’-combs ; mask the mushrooms with a white ‘chaufroix’-sauce, glaze the truffles with a paste-brush dipped into half-set jelly, and leave the cocks’- combs in their natural condition. Fix on an oblong dish a ‘pain-vert’ of an oval form, not too thick, and bearing on its centre a support of wood, masked with fat. The318 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. capons being cold, remove the string, and dish them up on the ‘pain-vert’, inclining them slightly, and resting them against the support. Arrange the truffles on both sides of the support, surrounded with the cocks’- eombs. Edge the centre of the dish with fancy-shaped ‘croûtons’ of aspic-jelly, and surround the breast of the capons with the button-mushrooms. Place, on the centre of the support, a subject representing the celebrated Lully, as a cook, playing the violin. The dish is placed on a stand ; the stand is in fat, of an oval form, and mounted on a wooden mandrel; the foot, cup, and friese, are carved with the knife ; the little children in caps, making music, may be partly cast and partly modelled with the hand. The ‘chimeras’, forming the handles, are modelled in fat, over an iron-wire, fixed to the frame of the stand. This piece is represented on the engraved plate, out of text. Page No. 292. 7 33. Capon ‘au gros sel’. — The capon ‘au gros sel’, which is a dish handed down to us from the old school, must be simply boiled in salted water; only by wrongly interpreting its denomination, the capon is sometimes served with a lump of rock-salt on its breast: indeed, when musing on this strange seasoning, it is easily suggested to be nothing but a misconception, out of all culinary and gastronomic rules; and that the ‘big salt’ is of no definite purpose what- ever, that could prove its usefulness. The salt figures here without any pretext, serving neither as an auxiliary, nor as a seasoning, and certainly not as a decoration of the capon. It is then good for nothing but to be a nuisance ; as neither butcher’s meat nor poultry are ever, to my knowledge, eaten with big-salt. Only imagine anybody chewing a grain of salt together with any piece of meat ; and the in- convenience will be immediately perceived of big salt figuring in any dish. Therefore it is time to renounce a preparation which seems founded on pre- judice, rather than on reason, and of which the efficacy must appear so questionable. Get a capon, fat and tender, not too large ; singe, draw, and truss it with a piece of butter inside ; then rub it all over with lemon. Boil in a stewpan a sufficient quantity of water, to completely cover the capon ; add to it a handful of big salt (gros sel) and a bunch of parsley; when the ebullition is well accomplished, plunge the capon into the water, cover the stewpan, place a weight on its lid, and draw it on the side of the fire, continuing to boil the capon vigorously for an hour and a quarter; dish it up afterwards, with halves of lemon, and a ‘bouquet’ of parsley- leaves ; serve separately a purée of celery-roots, or one of turnips ; and at the same time a sauceboat of good gravy. Carving of the capon. — As legs of boiled capon are so highly esteemed by ‘gourmets’, it is best to carve them first of all, to be divided in two ; then take off each side of the breast a minion-fillet, letting the pinion-bone adhere; now cut offPOULTRY. — FOWLS. 319 nice slices from the whole length of the breast. Remove the breast from the back by aid of a pair of carving-scissors, and divide it, either transversally or lengthwise. Now nothing is left but the back, which, having been freed from all small bits of meat, may be cut transversally into three pieces. If it be true that the back is highly relished by all amateurs ; nevertheless do not present it to any one, unless particularly asked for. 734. Poultry cutlets, Polish fashion (D. 125). — Take the white meat of a boiled chicken cut this in dice, and put this ‘salpicon’ into a stewpan, Fig. 125. adding to it half its volume of raw truffles, the same of pickled tongue, and a few tablespoonfuls of mushrooms, also cut in dice. Thicken this preparation with four tablespoonfuls of raw ‘quenelle’-force-meat, as well as with two tablespoonfuls of reduced Velouté’; now divide it into sixteen or eighteen parts, which roll on the floured slab, giving each part the shape of a cutlet; dip them, one by one, into beaten eggs, roll them in white bread-crumb, equalise them with the blade of a knife. Ten minutes previous to serving, fry these cutlets in clarified butter, thus letting them take color; drain them on a cloth, stick a small ruffle on each of them, and dish them in a circular order. Fill the cavity with a purée. 735. Capon of Toulouse, ‘à la chipolata’. — Drain and singe a good capon, truss it as for boiling, cover it with a few slices of lemon without peel, which support with thin slices of fat bacon, tie them up, and place the capon in a stewpan spread with vegetables and trimmings of fat ; fry it a few minutes, then add to it ten ounces of pickled pork, moisten to half its height with broth and white wine ; let the liquid boil up, then draw the stewpan on a moderate fire, to boil the capon gently, turning several times ; one hour and a quarter will do. Twenty minutes before taking the capon out, put into the stewpan a score of small ‘chipolata’ sausages (that is, made with poultry-meat, bacon, and panada), or one large common sausage, only not too thick. When the capon is done, drain the cooking-stock, and pass it through a sieve; skim off the fat, reduce it to half-glaze,COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 320 and add to it a few spoonfuls of good brown-sauce, and two or three dozen fresh mushrooms. When the sauce is sufficiently reduced, put in the pickled pork cut in squares, the sausages, two dozen chestnuts, and the same of small glazed onions. When ready to serve, dish up the capon, and surround it with the garnishes. 730. Hunters’ pie. -— This is a very useful and very agreeable dish, when out hunting, or while travelling. Take a round houshold loaf, make a circular incision four inches in diameter on the top, and through this opening take the crumb out. On the other hand have prepared a ‘fricassée’ of chicken, thickened with yolks of eggs, according to the usual method ; let it cool, and place it in the loaf with its sauce, then close the opening with the round crust of bread, kept for this purpose. 737. Mince of chicken, with poached eggs. — Cut into small dice the meat of a cooked chicken, add to this ‘salpicon’ a third its volume of cooked ox- tongue, and the same of mushrooms, likewise in dice ; keep the ‘salpicon’ covered. Butter an open flawn-eircle about six inches in diameter ; set it on a baking- sheet spread with paper, line it with short-paste, cut up the paste on a level with the edges, and pinch it with the pastry-pincers. Mask the interior, bottom and sides, with a buttered paper, which apply on the paste, thus fixing it ; fill the hollow with common flour, and bake the paste in a moderate oven for twenty minutes. Remove the circle, dish the crust up, and keep it hot. Pour into a flat stewpan a few spoonfuls of good‘béchamel’-sauce, reduce it on a brisk fire, stirring, and introducing into it a little good cream ; at last add four tablespoonfuls of melted glaze : when succulent, take it off the fire, and add to it the ‘salpicon’ ; season with a little of nutmeg, warm the mince without letting it boil, pour it into the crust, and set on the top of the ‘salpicon’, scrollwise, seven or eight poached eggs. 738. Chicken ‘chaufroix’ (D. 126). —Roast three middling-sized tender chickens, keeping them under-done ; when taken off the spit, let them cool, then divide each of them into five parts : two fillets, two legs, one breast-piece. Pare these pieces to a nice shape, removing all the skin, and as much as possible the bones. Pour into a stewpan three gills of warm good yellow-sauce, add to it half its volume of aspic-jelly, also warm. Set the stewpan on the ice, stir the liquid with a wooden spoon, in order to thicken it a little. This done, immediately remove the stewpan. Now take the pieces of poultry, one by one, dip them into the sauce, in such a manner as to mask them entirely with a light layer ; place them, one beside the other, on a baking-sheet. Set a plain border-mould into a basin, surround it with ice. Adorn the circuit of the mould, in the middle, with a circle of slices of truffle, previously dipped into321 POULTRY. — CHICKEN. half-set jelly. The mould adorned, gradually fill it with aspic-jelly, which allow to get firm for an hour at least ; then turn it out on a cold dish : fill the hollow of the border with a wooden support, of the same size as the mould’s cylinder, and nearly i the same height. This support must previously be masked with white paper. Fig. 12 G. Pare the poultry-pieces from the superfluity of sauce, mask them with a layer of jelly, then dish them in a pyramid against the border, that is, on the support, placing the legs on the bottom, the fillets above these, and the breast-pieces upper- most. Be careful to place the pieces solidly, yet avoid touching them too much, lest the brilliancy of the sauce should be tarnished. 739. Chickens roasted, Naples fashion (D. 127). — In Naples, Fig. 127. kitchen-jacks are pretty nearly unknown; still all the roasts, without exception, are done on the spit, before an open fire. The method in use is of the simplest, and, let me add, it answers wonderfully well. However, by describing this method, I do not intend to make a rule of it ; but it is an expedient, which, in certain cases, may findCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 322 its application. So I have thought it useful to bring it forward. A cook should know every thing connected with his profession. Truss two chickens, cover them (harder) with bacon,* set them on the spit, securing them, by the legs, with a string. Spread a few shovels of charcoal along the wall of the hearth or stove, and another row in front of this one, leaving a void space between the two rows; place some live embers on the charcoal, and let it be well kindled; prick then the pointed end of the spit against the wall, to the height required, resting it, at the opposite end, on a tire-dog with hooks. Butter the chickens with a paste-brush, fastened to the end of a rod ; let them roast gradually, turning the spit from time to time. When done, salt, take them off the tire, and dish them up with gravy under. 740. Quenelles of chicken, with mushrooms (D. 128). — Take the flesh from the breasts of two good fowls, or chickens ; pare it, cut it in pieces, and pound ; mix it with a third of its volume of panada, and the same of butter, the latter gradually. When the force-meat is smooth, and well mixed up, season it with salt and nutmeg, and introduce into it two or three yolks of eggs ; live minutes after, pass it through a sieve, put it into a kitchen-basin, and add to it two or three table- spoonfuls of double-cream. Take a spoonful of this force-meat, and poach it in boiling water, to try its consistency : it should be smooth. With this force-meat mould fifteen 'quenelles’, by the aid of two tablespoons; slip them on the buttered bottom of a 'saute’-pan, one beside the other. On the other hand, cut in pieces the back-bones of the chickens, steep them for a few minutes in tepid water, together with the legs, necks, and pinions ; then drain them on a cloth. Slice one onion, put it into a stewpan with butter, to fry it slightly ; add to it the pieces of chicken, toss them on a good fire, not allowing them to take color ; sprinkle over a little flour, and moisten with a quart of white broth, freed of fat, and strained. Add moreover a bunch of parsley, garnished with a bay-leaf, a few peppercorns, a handful of fresh mushrooms> and a glass of white wine ; let the sauce boil on the side of the fire for twenty-five minutes ; skim off the fat, pass it afterwards, through a tammy, into another stewpan, and reduce it on a brisk fire, until succulent, and ol sufficient consistence; introducing into it, by degrees, a few tablespoonfuls of mushrooms-liquor, strained. * The chickens may do quite well, even without being covered with bacon; by showing them thus, I wished to give a model of the application of layei-s of bacon, which is often spoken of in my descriptions.POULTRY. — CHICKEN. 323 Poach the ‘quenelles’* in salted boiling water, and drain them with a skimmer as soon as lirm ; place them on a cloth to dry, and dish them up in a circular order, on a border of poached force-meat, turned over on a dish ; garnish the interior of Fig. 128. the circle, with a few white button-mushrooms, and cocks’-combs, which baste with the sauce. 741. Carved chicken and tongue, with jelly (D. 129). — Roast two large chickens, basting them with butter, and not allowing them to take much color ; salt them, let them cool, then remove the strings, and cut up each of them in four parts,- without making a breast-piece ; pare the two wings, disengage the meat from the pinion-bones, and cut it in slices. Cut the legs at the joint, without separating the parts. Fig. 129 Cut in slices, not too thick, the centre-piece of two pickled cooked tongues, cooled under press ; pare the slices to an equal shape and size, as near as may be. Fix on an oblong dish a low ‘pain-vert’, the top of which is masked with white paper. Set the two backs on the centre of the ‘pain-vert’, place two of the legs on each side, and on the legs place the two wings, supporting them with aspic-jelly ; , mask also the backs with chopped aspic, and put on them the slices of tongue, in the * ‘Quenelles’ must-be plunged into boiling water, but they must be poached without the liquid boiling. 21*COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 324 way shown by the drawing; slightly glaze the chickens, and surround the ‘pain- vert’ with big ‘croûtons’ of jelly, alternating a round with a square one. 742. Chicken-pie. — Cover the bottom of a pie-dish with slices of raw ham or veal ; season with salt and pepper ; over this place two young raw chickens, cut each into four parts ; season likewise with pepper and salt, add six yolks of eggs, boiled hard, and moisten with a gill of gravy; cover the pie with a Hat of puff-paste (see No. 596), adorn it with a few stamped leaves of the same paste ; egg, and bake the pie in a moderate oven for one hour and a half, being careful to cover it with a sheet of paper, as soon as it has taken color. If the pie should be eaten cold, one can mix in the gravy two leaves of dissolved ‘gélatine’. 743. Chickens sautés, farmhouse fashion. — Singe two middling- sized chickens ; draw them, cut off the legs and pinions, detaching the thighs of both, and make three pieces of the breast : two fillets, and the remaining breast-piece. Cut the backs transversally. Melt a piece of butter or some lard in a flat stewpan, in which place the legs, backs, and pinions; add to it ten ounces of pickled pork, a clove of garlic, a bunch of parsley, salt, and pepper ; set the stewpan on a brisk fire, to fry the pieces of chicken on both sides ; when the legs are half-done, add to them the wings and breasts, which fry also ; when the chickens are three-parts cooked, add two or three large white sliced onions, place live embers on the lid of the pan, and continue cooking gently : onions and chickens should be done at the same time ; then pom- over a few tablespoonfuls of tomata-sauce, let it boil for a few seconds, ■ and dish up the chickens in pyramidal form ; add a few cooked button-mushrooms tu the sauce, and pour it over the chickens. 744. Timbale of chickens, with truffles. — Cut up two middling- sized chickens, each in five parts, put them into a stewpan with chopped fat-bacon, fry them on a good tire, season with salt and pepper, and when of a nice color, add to them six ounces of ham, or of streaky bacon, cut in dice; a few minutes after, add five or six raw truffles, peeled and cut up in thick slices, and the scalded liver of the chickens, also the trimmings of the truffles. The chickens being half-done, moisten them with a glass of white wine, which reduce quickly to a glaze, and pour the stew into a kitchen-basin. On the other hand, butter a ‘timbale’-mould, or a stewpan, line it with short-paste (No. 196); cover the bottom and the sides with a layer of raw pork-mince, well chopped, pounded, and finished with a few tablespoonfuls of cooked fine-herbs ; place then the chickens and truffles in the ‘timbale’, leaving as little cavity as possible; cover it likewise with a thin layer of force-meat, and then with a flat of paste ; which solder to the rims of the ‘timbale’, push the mould into a moderate oven, for one hour ; after which take it out, and turn the ‘timbale’ out on a hot dish. Make a small '325 POULTRY. — CHICKEN. round opening on the top, and through it, pour into the 'timbale’ a little good, thickened gravy, prepared with the backs of chicken, reduced with a little wine, and the trimmings of the truffles ; put back into place the round taken off, baste the bottom of the dish with a little sauce, and serve immèdiately. 745. French timbale of chickens. — Singe two middling-sized chickens, cut off the pinions and leg-bones; divide each into five parts, without the backs, and break up the bone of the thighs, which take out ; divide also the backs in two. Put all these pieces into a stewpan with the wings, three tablespoonfuls of melted fat-bacon, half a pound of soaked ham, cut into large dice, and a bunch of parsley and aromatics ; set the stewpan on a brisk fire, fry the chickens to a nice color, season, and take up, with a skimmer, ham and chicken; keep them hot in an other stewpan. Mix into the fat in the stewpan two tablespoonfuls of chopped shalôt and onion ; fry them, and add about fifteen mushrooms cut up in quartets. When these have reduced their moisture, add six scalded chickens’ livers cut in two, four tablespoonfuls of madeira, and the same of melted glaze ; put back the chickens into the stewpan, toss them in the sauce (off the fire), sprinkle over a pinch of chopped parsley, and put them by. Line a 'timbale’-mould with short-paste (No. 196); spread the sides and bottom of the paste with a layer of raw mince of veal or pork, finished with four tablespoonfuls I of fine-herbs ; arrange the pieces of chicken in the 'timbale’, intermingling them with I # the mushrooms, livers, and ham; cover also the top with the same mince, fold the ; paste over, and place on the top a flat of paste ; then set the 'timbale’ on a small baking-sheet, and push it into a moderate oven, to bake for one hour. When done, turn it out on its dish, make an opening on the top, and pour in half a pint of i good thickened gravy, reduced with a little wine ; cover the 'timbale’, and serve immediately. 746. Cocks’-combs, Bordeaux fashion. — Cut out the projecting points, and the base, of a few dozens of fine cocks’-combs; take them with a skimmer, in small quantities at a time, plunge them into warm water, and leave them | so, until the epidermis peels off, by pressing them between the fingers ; then take them out, rub them quickly with a cloth, and plunge them into cold water ; drain, and place them in a kitchen-basin, moisten with plenty of tepid water, and set the basin in a place warm enough to keep the liquid always at the same degree, until the j cocks-’-combs be very white. Then drain them, put them into a stewpan; moisten i with water, white wine, and the juice of two lemons ; add a little salt, cover with a j slice of bacon, and boil the cocks’-combs over a moderate fire, keeping them firm. With two ounces of butter and a tablespoonful of flour, prepare a white 'roux’ ; dilute it then with the stock of the cocks’-combs, and some white chicken-or veal-COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 326 broth ; stir the sauce on the fire till ebullition, and then draw it on the side of the fire, letting it do nothing but simmer for twenty-five minutes ; carefully skim off the fat, and pass it, through a tammy, into a flat stewpan ; reduce it until succulent, and of a nice consistence. Then introduce into it a few tablespoonfuls of cream, strain it in a small stewpan, add to it the cocks’-combs, and keep the pan in the ‘bain-marie’. Meanwhile, cut up eight or ten bx-ead ‘croûtons’ of an oval form, rather thick; make a circular incision on one side with the point of a knife, fry them in butter, drain, and empty them. Get a few nice heads of ‘cèpes’, trim away their black skin, slice them, put them into a frying-pan with buttei’, and toss them over a brisk fire, to reduce their moisture; then thicken them with a few tablcspoonfuls of melted glaze, finish them with chopped parsley, and the juice of one lemon ; with the mince fill the bread-‘croutons’, place the cocks’-combs on the centre of a dish, and suiTound them with these ‘croûtons’. 747. Chickens with ‘paprica’, as in Hungary. — Singe two chickens, cut each of them iix five parts, divide the back-bones in two, and sprinkle over all the pieces ‘paprica’; then place them in a stewpan with the pinions, a minced white onion, and five ounces of raw ham in squares; season, and fry them on a moderate fire ; when their moisture is reduced, moisten with a few tablespoonfuls of gravy, put some warm ashes on the lid, and continue boiling gently, so as to braise the chickens short of moisture. When they are three-parts done, thicken the stock with half a pint of good sour-cream ; ten or twelve minutes after, dish up the chickens ; reduce the sauce quickly, stirring with a spoon ; when thickened like any common sauce, finish it with a pinch of ‘paprica’, the juice of one lemon, and a piece of butter ; then pass it, through a sieve, over the chickens. 748. Chicken-fricassée, with rice (D. 130). — Singe two middling sized chickens, divide them, each into five parts; which steep in cold water, for ten minutes, with the necks, pinions, and backs, trimmed and cut up, each in two parts; drain them afterwards, put them into a stewpan, moisten to cover with tepid water, and a glass of white wine ; add a little salt, and a few trimmings of fresh mushrooms; set the stewpan on the fire, to boil the liquid, x’emoving the scum rising to the surface. Take out the breasts and wings, as soon as set ; leave the legs and other pieces in the stock, until half-done ; drain them in a colandei1, pi’eserving the liquid ; refresh, and trim them neatly ; wipe, and put them into a stewpan (minus the wings and breasts) with a piece of butter, two small onions, and eight ounces of ham cut in large dice ; fry them for a few minutes, sprinkle over a handful of flour, and moisten with the preserved liquor; add a bunch of parsley and aromatics, peppei-corns,POULTRY. — CHICKEN. 327 cloves, and at last half a glass of white wine; set the stewpan on the fire, cover it, boil the sauce until reduced one third, while the chicken-meat is cooking. When the legs are three-parts done, add to them the wings and breasts, and a dozen fresh button-mushrooms : continue the boiling for ten or twelve minutes, take away the fat from the sauce, and thicken it with three yolks of eggs ; cook the liaison without Fig. 130. allowing it to boil ; and finish the ‘fricassee’ with the juice of one lemon, a piece of butter, a point of nutmeg, and a pinch of chopped parsley ; now dish it into a border of rice, or of‘risot’ ; which surround with a part of the mushrooms, each of them alter- nated with a cock’s-comb ; slightly mask the entrée with a little sauce ; the remainder of which send up in a sauceboat. 749. Chickens sautés, with madeira (D. 131). — Cut up two Fig. 131. ■ chickens, each of them in five parts, place the legs in a flat stewpan with clarified butter; season, and fry them with live embers on the lid, turning. When half-done, add to them the fillets and breasts, a bunch of parsley, and a handful of trimmings of fresh truffles. When all the pieces are about done, drain the fat off the pan, and moisten with half a glass of madeira ; reduce it quickly, baste the chickens with five328 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. or six tablespoonfuls of melted glaze, let the sauce boil ; and remove the pan back, keeping it covered. Fix solidly a support of fried bread on the centre of an entrée-dish ; mask it, as well as the bottom of the dish, with a layer of raw force-meat, and poach it at the entrance of the oven. When the dish is taken out of the oven, adorn it with a border of English-paste. When ready to serve, drain the chickens, place the legs upright on the bottom of the dish, applied against the support, supporting them at the base with a few small cooked truffles. Fill the hollow with a few mushrooms, then set the fillets and breast-pieces on the legs, likewise resting against the support. Fix on the top, by the aid of a small skewer, a large button-mushroom. Pour into a flat stewpan two gills of brown-sauce, and four tablespoonfuls of madeira ; let the sauce boil up, add to it two or tlu’ee sliced truffles, cook them in the sauce ; and, as soon as this is slightly thickened, baste the chickens with it ; and send up the remainder of the sauce in a sauceboat. This entrée is arranged to go on the table. 750. Chicken, ‘à la printanière’. — Truss a good chicken, for entrée; put it into a stewpan, with eight ounces of chopped bacon, and fry ; as soon as the meat is set, add to it a garnish composed of small carrots and new onions; salt slightly; add to it eight ounces of streaky bacon, previously scalded, and cut up in squares; then draw the stewpan on a moderate fire, place some warm ashes on the lid, and thus fry the chicken gently, adding a few tablespoonfuls of broth. Twenty minutes after, add to the vegetables two handfuls of fresh green-pease ; as soon as these are done, drain the chicken, divest it of the string, dish up, and surround it with the vegetables. Skim the fat off the cooking-stock, add to it-a little light sauce, let it boil a while, and pass -it, through a sieve, over the chicken. 571. Small chickens, ‘entrée de broche’ (D. 132). — Slice two onions, and a carrot ; put them into a stewpan with butter, and trimmings of bacon ; fry them on a moderate fire, giving them a nice color; add then a pinch of aromatics, a few sprigs of parsley, and a handful of truffles-peel ; moisten the whole with a quarter of a glass of madeira , reduce it on a brisk fire, and remove the pan back. Singe three nice chickens, draw, truss them as for boiling; cover the breast with the preparation above described, and lay over it some thin layers of bacon to support it. Secure the bacon with string, run the chickens through with a small iron- skewer, and set them on the spit. Three quarters of an hour previous to serving, roast the chickens at a good tire, basting them with butter, and the drippings. When done, take them off the fire, un-329 POULTRY. — CHICKEN. pack them, and remove the string. Turn out on a dish a border of force-meat, decorated and poached ; fix in its centre a support of fried bread, masked with force- meat; dish up the chickens in a triangular way on this border, applying them against the support ; range between them some small groups of round peeled truffles, form a small circle of them on the top, between the chickens and support; on the top of which then insert a fliâtelet’-skewer. Glaze the chickens, pour on the bottom of the dish a little madeira-sauce, reduced with the trimmings of truffle. Send up separately a boatful of this sauce. 752. Salad of chickens, ‘à l’ancienne’ (D. 133). — Take the meat of two cooked chickens, remove away skin and bones, divide it into small pieces, place it in a kitchen-basin, season, baste with a little oil and vinegar, and sprinkle over a pinch of chopped taragon-leaves. With four yolks of eggs and three gills of oil, prepare some mayonnaise-sauce : when finished, introduce into it a few tablespoonfuls of cold, but liquid aspic-jelly. Fig. 133.330 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. Place a pyramid mould in an earthen-basin ; surround it with pounded ice, and fill it, in layers, with the pieces of chicken ; alternating each layer with some of the mayonnaise, a pinch of capers or of gerkins, and a few pickled olives without kernels. One hour after, dip the mould quickly into warm water ; wipe it, and turn the preparation out on a cold dish ; mask it then with a coating of the same mayon- naise, smooth the surfaces with the blade of a knife > adorn them with fillets of an- chovies, chopped capers, and gerkins ; place on the top a heart of lettuce, and arrange all round a circle of olives without kernels. Surround the base of the pyramid with a circle of hard-boiled eggs in quarters, dipping them in half-set jelly, to fix them on. Between the eggs and the salad, range a circle of lettuce-hearts, divided into quarters. 753. Chieken-fricassée, German fashion. — In Germany chicken ‘fricassee’ is a genuine national dish, and generally very well prepared by the cooks. Singe, draw, and truss, two good fowls; which put into a stewpan, with some vegetables, large spices, and a garnished bunch of aromatics ; moisten largely with good broth, and let them boil on a moderate fire. When the fowls are done, pass this broth through a napkin, carve each of the fowls into eight parts, which then place in a stewpan; adding two handfuls of cooked morils, two cooked and sliced sweetbreads, four dozen plucked crayfish-tails, as well as the blanched and cooked livers and crops of the fowls ; place the stewpan in the ‘bain-marie’. With the fowl’s cooking-stock prepare a simple wliite-sauce (sec No. 159) ; stir it over the fire till boiling, withdraw it to the side of the fire, adding to it a bunch of parsley, and some mushroom-trimmings. Half an hour afterwards, skim the fat off the sauce, pass it through a sieve, let it reduce to the degree requisite, thicken with a liaison of two yolks of eggs, diluted with a little cream ; then pass the sauce, through a sieve, over the carved poultry ; warm it for a few minutes, without any ebullition ; sprinkle over a little chopped parsley, finish it with the juice of a lemon, and dish up ; garnish the centre with puff-paste ‘croûtons’, as well as with crayfish- shells (coffres), filleul with bread-farce*; baste the chickens with the aid of a paste- brush, dipped in a little melted crayfish-butter. 754. ‘Petites timbales’ with ‘montglas’ (D. 134). — Butter ten or twelve ‘dariole’-moulds, place on the bottom of each of them a round of cooked truffle ; fill the hollow of the moulds with some good poultry force-meat (sec No. 740) * Here is the process of preparing this farce. Put into a kitchen-basin two handfuls of white and fine bread-crumb ; into which introduce, with aid of the spoon, two ounces and a half of common butter, and a little crayfish-butter; then four or five yolks of eggs, a little chopped parsley, salt and pepper: the preparation must remain firm.331 POULTRY. — CHICKEN. finished with a little sauce. Cover the force-meat with a round of buttered paper, let the ‘timbales’ poach in the ‘bain-marie’. The force-meat having become firm, take the moulds out, range the ‘timbales’ in a circle on the bottom of a dish. Lay now into the hollow of the circle a ‘montglas’- Fig. 134. garnish (see No. 712), composed of fillets of poultry, pickled tongue, truffles, and mushrooms ; this garnish must be thickened with a little good sauce well reduced, and not too abundant. Serve separately some ‘velouté’- sauce, reduced with mush- room-extract. 755. Poultry ‘pain’, with taragon (D. 135). — Encrust a plain cy- linder-mould on pounded ice, coat (chemiser) the bottom and sides with a layer of clear jelly. Fig. 135. Put into a small copper-basin three gills of poultry-purée, passed through a tammy; set the basin on the ice, add to it half a glassful of good oil, the same of yellow-sauce, and two gills of aspic-jelly. Whip the preparation; as soon as it begins to thicken, introduce into it gradually a gill of good taragon-vinegar ; immediately take it off the ice, add to it a ‘salpicon’ of preserved gerkins of a nice green color. Pour the preparation into the mould, and let it set for an hour. At serving time, dip the mould into warm water, wipe well, and turn the ‘pain’ out on a little wooden or bread stand, masked all round with fat, and on the top with white paper.

Chicken pilaw. — Take the fillets of two chickens, cut them into middling-sized squares, put them into a stewpan with butter, let them slightly fry ; season, mix them with two pounds of good rice, washed and dried; moisten, to double its height, with chicken-broth. Boil the rice for fifteen minutes, moisten it with twelve ounces of clarified brown-butter (à la noisette), close the stewpan her- metically, remove it back on embers ; a quarter of an hour afterwards, dish up the pilaw. 757. ‘Fritot’ of chickens, Vienna fashion. — Twenty minutes pre- vious to serving, take and bleed five or six little young chickens, dip them quickly into nearly boiling water, in order to remove the feathers all at once. Wipe the chickens carefully, singe them, and cut each of them in two. Split the chickens’ legs transversally, in order to introduce the end of the pinion-bones beneath the skin. Salt them slightly, flour, dip them into beaten eggs ; bread-crumb, and plunge them into hot hog’s-lard, in order to give them a fine color; drain them on a napkin, salt, then dish them in a group on a napkin, and surround them with fried parsley. Serve separately a little tomata-sauce. 758. Chicken-salad, Bordeaux fashion. — Pare a dozen chicken- fillets, of equal shape, removing the pinion-bones ; beat, salt, and let them poach in butter ; proceeding according to the common method. Let them cool with a light weight on ; when cold, pare them, mask with ‘ravigote’-sauce with jelly, immediately ranging them one by one, but each in the same direction, on a baking-sheet. The sauce being cold, coat (napper) the fillets with jelly, dish them in a circular order on a layer of jelly, having set on the dish. Place, in the hollow of the circle, a salad composed of heads of green asparagus, and cooked truffles cut in big ‘julienne’. 759. Chicken, Taragon-sauce. — Get a good-sized chicken, singe, draw and stuff it with a piece of butter, mixed up with a small handful of taragon-leaves ; truss it with the legs in, cover it with bacon, and place it in a stewpan with the neck and gizzard, and a few trimmings of veal ; moisten to its height with half a glass of white wine, some broth from the stockpot, and toppings ; let the liquid boil up, then remove the stewpan on a moderate fire, thus cooking the chicken for forty or fifty minutes. When done, strain the stock, skim off the fat, which pour over the chicken, and keep hot. With four ounces of butter, and a tablespoonful of flour, prepare a little ‘roux’, without allowing it to take color, dilute it then with the stock of the chicken, stir the sauce until boiling, then remove it on the side of the fire; add to it a small bunchPOULTRY. — CHICKEN. 333 of taragon, and boil it for fifteen or eighteen minutes ; skim afterwards the fat away, strain it through a sieve into a flat stewpan ; then reduce, and thicken it with two diluted yolks of eggs. Cook the ‘liaison’ without allowing to boil ; finish the sauce with a small piece of butter, and a tablespoonful of blanched green taragon-leaves. Remove the string from the chicken, dish it up, and mask with the sauce. 7C0. Chickens, Hamburg fashion. — Take out the breast of three small chickens, trim the pinions away ; season, dip them in beaten eggs and butter ; bread-crumb, and place them in a buttered sauté-pan. Rone six legs, stuff them with raw ‘quenelle’ force-meat, and braise them with little liquid. Twenty minutes previous to serving, baste the breasts with a little clarified butter, and bake them in the oven. When done, dish them up, glaze the legs, place them between the breasts, and mask the bottom of the dish with a little good tomata-sauce. 701. Chicken curry, Indian fashion.— The method here to be de- scribed, is that practiced in India ; it differs in many points from the one adopted on the continent, this being a reason the more, for producing it here. Cut up a large fowl in eight parts, divide the back in two, season all the pieces, and sprinkle over a tablespoonful of curry-powder. Shred a large Portugal onion, put it into a stewpan with clarified butter, and fry it, until of a nice color ; add to it the pieces of chicken, also the back and pinions; fry them nicely, and moisten, to half height, with broth ; cover the stewpan, reduce the liquid on a moderate fire, and moisten the meat with broth, which reduce to a glaze, continuing to moisten and reduce the liquid, until the chicken is about done ; then add a few spoonfuls of chopped cocoa-nut in ‘julienne’, and a few spoonfuls of cocoa-nut liquor. From this moment keep the curry gently simmering. When the chicken is done, thicken the sauce with a little double-cream, and finish it by the addition of the juice of two or three lemons ; then dish the chicken, pour the sauce over, and serve separately a dish of rice, cooked thus : It ice, India fashion. — Plunge ten ounces of rice into boiling water ; at the first bubbling pour into the stewpan a glass of cold water, to stop the ebullition ; as soon as the rice begins boiling again, close the stewpan hermetically, and draw it on the side of the fire : the liquid should only simmer. Twenty minutes after, pour the rice out on a large sieve, spread it, and stir it with a spoon, in order to drain more quickly, then put it immediately in a vegetable-dish, cover, and serve. 702. Fine-ragout, Milan fashion. — This dish is very much in request by the Italian ‘gourmets’; it is very much in use, and almost indispensable, in choice lunches.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 334 Get a dozen pinions of good fat pullets; singe them, half-bone them, and press the meat into the hollow ; put them after this into a stewpan, with a small chopped onion, and some butter ; fry them to a nice color ; sprinkle over a pinch of Hour, moisten with a little withe wine, and some gravy little colored, or some broth: boil them over a moderate tire. When about doue, add to them a dozen small scalded and trimmed lambs’ sweetbreads, a few ‘amourettes’ of veal, blanched and cut up in pieces, eighteen white cocks’-combs, cooked separately, and a few handfuls of green-pease : continue cooking gently. At the last moment, add to the ‘ragout’ about twenty blanched cocks’-kernels ; then dish it up, and surround with small ‘croûtons’ of puff-paste. 0 7G3. Chicken ‘capillotade’ (hash). — Take a cooked and cooled chicken, which divide in pieces, removing the skin and most part of the bones : place the pieces in a stewpan, moisten them with a little melted glaze, keep them warm without ebullition. Mince two or three white onions, put them into a thin stewpan with butter ; salt, let them take color on a very slow fire ; moisten with half a glassful of vinegar, let them reduce to glaze : the onions now should prove nearly done. Sprinkle over a pinch of Hour, and moisten them with gravy or broth ; add a pinch of pepper: seven or eight minutes after, pour the onions over the chickens; warm the hash well, without allowing it to boil ; sprinkle over four tablespoonfuls of chopped gerkins, and dish up. 764. ‘Bordure à la Toulouse’. — Pare three fillets of chickens, salt, and fry them with butter on both sides, keeping them under-done ; drain them, cut them up in scollops, and put them into a stewpan. With the legs of the chickens, and a few trimmings of poultry, prepare a ‘quenelle’ force-meat,' with which mould some ‘quenelles’ with a spoon ; poach, and mix them with the scollops, as well as a dozen cooked button-mushrooms, cut in two transversally ; two scolloped cooked truffles, a dozen cocks’-combs. Moisten these garnishes with ‘velouté’-sauce, reduced with a handful of trimmings of mushrooms, and keep the stewpan in the ‘bain-marie’. Prepare some force-meat with half a pound of raw fat-liver, and a few cooked chickens’ livers, five ounces of panada, a piece of butter, and six yolks of eggs ; when ready, put it into a buttered border-mould, and poach it in the ‘bain-marie’. When ready to serve, turn the border out on a dish ; fill the cavity with the garnish, mask with the sauce, and send up. 7G5.

Over the force-meat place the legs, mask them above with fried parsley, and place the fillets over ; cover them with fried parsley, and dish on the top a breast of chicken, so as to form a regular and solid pyramid. Send up separately a little tomata-sauce. 706. Aspic of cocks’-combs, with truffles (D. 137). — Set fast, a Fig. 137. plain cylindric mould in an earthen-basin with pounded ice ; put also some ice into the cylinder, and cover the mould.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 336 Get two dozen fine white cooked cocks’-combs. Cut up a few dozen rounds of cooked truffles ; take up these rounds, one by one, with the point of a larding- needle; dip them in half-set jelly, and apply them against the interior sides of the mould, so as to form a circle all round. Take afterwards the cocks’-combs, always with the larding-needle, and apply them likewise against the sides, forming a second circle. Continue thus, alternating truffles and cocks’-combs; and fill the hollow of the mould gradually with cold, but liquid aspic-jelly. One hour after, dip the mould quickly into hot water, wipe, and turn it out on a dish, bearing on its centre a small column masked with paper or fat, on the top of which set a small subject in fat, representing a cock. Adorn the base with triangular 'croutons’ of aspic-jelly, set flat on the dish. 767. Rissoles of cocks’-combs, with ham.— Divide three dozen cooked and cold cocks’-combs into small dice, put them into a stewpan, and add to them a third their volume of cooked ham, also in dice. Pour into a flat stewpan a pint of 'béchamel’-sauce, tolerably thick; set the pan on the fire, reduce the sauce, and when of sufficient consistence, gradually introduce into it four or five table- spoonfuls of melted glaze; remove it back, and mix it with the prepared 'salpicon’; which should imbibe the sauce, yet remaining of a thickish consistence ; pour then the preparation into a small basin, and let it cool. Then, with this and some half puff-paste, prepare some 'rissoles’. Pry, and dish them up on a folded napkin. 768. Chickens (broiled), ‘à la crapaudine’. — Cut up the pinions, and leg-bones, of two young, drawn and singed, chickens; split them up the back, bone them, only leaving the stump-bone adhering to the wings. Take out the meat of the legs, without injuring the skin ; trim the sinew away, chop them, add half their volume of fresh bacon, and the same of raw ham, both chopped; season the mince with salt and spices ; add a pinch of bread-crumbs, as well as the half of an egg. Spread.the chickens open on the table; season, divide the mince in two, and apply it on the skin, in the place of the legs, thus equalising the whole surface. Dip the chickens in turn, into clarified butter, mixed up with four yolks of eggs ; lay them on fresh bread-crumbs, set them on a gridiron, and broil for twenty minutes, basting with butter. Dish them up afterwards with good reduced gravy, with taragon on the bottom of the dish. 769. Small chickens, broiled, with taragon. — Truss two small chickens with the legs in, plunge them into the stockpot to set their flesh ; five or six minutes will do. Drain them, let them cool, and divide each of them in two length- wise ; remove the backbone of each piece, season, roll them in clarified butter, bread-POULTRY. — CHICKEN. 337 crumb, and broil them on a moderate tire for twenty minutes, turning them ; dish them up, and pour on the bottom of the dish some succulent good gravy with taragon. 770. Chicken-fillets, English way (D. 138). — Pare ten fillets of chicken, trimming away the sinewy skin : beat them slightly, with the handle of a knife dipped in water, round them on the largest side, and pare them to a point on the opposite side ; salt slightly, and keep them covered. in salted water a nice pickled ox-tongue, managing to have it just done at serving- time. With the thighs of the chickens prepare some 'quenelle’ force-meat, fill with it a plain border-mould, and poach it in the 'bain-marie’. Get fifteen small raw truffles, peel, and keep them covered. With the bones of chicken, vegetables, aromatics, a little white wine and broth, prepare some stock, little of it, but good. When strained, add to it the trim- mings of truffles, reduce it to half-glaze, and mix it with an equal quantity of brown- sauce. Let this sauce boil for three minutes ; strain it then, through a tammy, into a small stewpan ; add to it the raw truffles, and a few spoonfuls of sherry ; boil the truffles on a very slow fire for eight or ten minutes. When ready to serve, pour the clarified butter into a flat stewpan, in which place the fillets one beside the other, and set the pan on a good fire, to poach the fillets on both sides. Two minutes will do. Take them up at once, and drain them. Drain the pickled tongue, remove the skin, and cut up, slanting, and across the thickness, a dozen good slices, not too thin ; and pare them to the size and shape of the fillets.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 338 Turn the border out on a dish, on the top set the fillets and slices of tongue, in a circular order, and alternated ; take up the truffles with a small skimmer, and place them in the centre of the border, which baste with a part of the sauce ; pour the remainder into a sauceboat, and glaze the slices of tongue with a paste-brush. This entrée is dished to go on the table ; it is placed on a hot-water dish. The entree of fillets of chicken is one of those, which cooks are most eager to insert into the plan of a luxurious dinner. Its rich simpleness constitutes it one of those dishes, possessing the particular privilege of pleasing every one ; nobody will question their importance, and distinction. But the result of this preference is, that these fillets of chicken must appear in all choice dinners; a fact, which gives to the bills of fare a sort of similarity, which at length becomes remarkable enough to strike every one ; this being however, I confess, the only inconvenience I found in their too often repeated exhibition ; as for their qualities, they are unquestionable, espe- cially, when the fillets are cooked with that care, which distinguishes the practical man, even in his simplest operations. 771. Chicken-fillets, Béarn fashion. — Trim fourteen fillets of chicken, split in two along the thick part, without separating the pieces. Fill the hollow with a small part of some cooked fine-herbs, close the aperture by luting it with a little raw force-meat. Season the fillets, dip them into whipped eggs, bread-crumb them, dip them into melted butter, and fry them on a very moderate fire, turning them. When done, dish them in a circular order ; fill the hollow of this circle with a garnish of small moulded ‘quenelles’; which mask, as well as the bottom of the dish, with brown ‘Béarn’-sauce, that is, finished with a piece of good glaze; send the remainder of this sauce up separately. 772. Galantine of chicken, with jelly (D. 139). — Bone a middling- sized tender chicken ; take the meat from the legs, take also the fillets ; which pare and divide, the latter in large dice ; put them into a kitchen-basin. Chop the meat from the legs ; add half a pound of minion-fillets of veal, and the same of fresh bacon, both chopped; pound them in the mortar, season with salt and spices, and pass them through a sieve. Add to the force-meat the fillets of chicken, three raw truffles, and five ounces of parboiled bacon, all of them cut up in large dice. Season the chicken, fill it with the prepared force-meat and roll the ‘galantines’; which keep rather long, but not too wide; wrap it up in a small cloth, tie it up, and boil it for one hour and a half, proceeding as in No. 714. When done, take it up, unpack it ; then pack it up again, and let it cool in a nice round shape. Pare it afterwards, divide it into slices of equal form and size; glaze the slices with the paste-brush, and ornament them with small squares olPOULTRY. - CHICKEN. 339 truffles, symmetrically disposed ; cover them with a thin coating of half-set jelly, let them cool, and dish np the slices, in a circular order, on a ‘pain-vert’, bearing on its centre a small support; on this support fix a small cup cast in fat, garnish it with Fig. 139. chopped aspic-jelly ; surround the base of the ‘pain-vert’ with square ‘croûtons’ of jelly, alternated by small groups of chopped aspic. 773. Turban of chicken-fillets (D. 140). — Take ten or twelve fillets of chicken, pare, beat them slightly, and lard {piquer) them with bacon on one side. With the meat from the legs, prepare a ‘quenelle’ force-meat, a little firm ; when passed through a sieve, mix in a third of its volume with as much purée of mush- Fig. 140. rooms. With the two thirds fill a buttered cylindrical dome-shaped mould ; poach the ‘pain’ in the ‘bain-marie’, and turn it out on a cooked flat of paste, cut to the size of an entrée-dish. The ‘pain’ of force-meat being cooled, mask it with a layer of raw force-meat, and apply against it the fillets on their unlarded side ; wrap up the parts not larded, with thin layers of bacon, push the turban into a moderate oven, and let it be tor twelve or fifteen minutes. When taken out of the oven, moisten slightly the 22*COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 340 larded parts of the fillets, and salamander them ; now immediately remove the layer of bacon, carefully wipe the fat off the cylinder, and slip the turban on to a round dish; which warm underneath, then adorn it (by the aid of ‘repère’), with a border of English-paste or ‘nouille’ paste ; and keep it in the warm-closet for a few minutes. Fill the cylinder of the turban with a garnish composed of cocks’-combs and truffles; which mask with a little brown-sauce, reduced with madeira, and send up separately the remainder of the sauce. This entrée is dished up, to go on the table. ,774. Chicken-fillets, Java fashion. — Let soften in cold water five or six swallows’ nests {salant)anas), which cleanse properly, and let them poach in poultry-broth. Take chicken-fillets, pare them according to the common rules, salt and sprinkle over both sides curry-powder; place them in a ‘sauté’-pan with clarified butter, and let them poach on a brisk fire, turning them; drain, and pare them again; put them back into the ‘sauté’-pan, roll them (off the fire) in a little succulent ‘veloute’- sauce, finished with a pinch of cayenne, and dish them in circular order on a bottom of force-meat poached on the dish. Drain the swallow-nests from out of the ^consommé’, season, place them in a ‘sauté’-pan, thicken them with a few tablespoon- fuls of sauce, and range them in the hollow of the entrée. Slightly mask the fillets with a little ‘velouté’, the remainder of which sauce send up separately. 775. Chickens sautés, Spanish fashion. — Take two chickens, cut in pieces, sprinkle over salt and Spanish red pepper. Melt four ounces of lard in a frying-pan, put in the legs of chicken, and half-fry them, while turning over; then add to it the wings and breasts, two chopped onions, a clove of garlic, and a hunch of parsley with aromatics ; seven or eight minutes after, add ten ounces of raw ham cut into thin squares. The chickens being done, take them out, and put into the frying-pan four nice tomatas, without seed, and cut in squares ; season them slightly, reduce their moisture over a brisk fire ; add the chickens, and baste them with a few tablespoonfuls of melted glaze ; warm them without ebullition, and dish them up with the tomatas all round. 776. Ragout of ‘sot-l’y-laisse’. — The ‘sot-l’y-laisse’ (there-fools- leave-it) is that tender part of the meat lying on either side of the backs of all sorts of poultry, directly under the flat bone binding the back to the breast. This piece of meat is very large in turkeys, poulards, and capons. It is a delicate and good dish, but of which the preparation is only possible on occasions, when numerous roasts of poultry are served. Slip off the ‘sot l’y laisse’ from the backs of seven or eight cooked pullets ; pare, place them in a small stewpan, and mix them with a few button-mushrooms split in341 POULTRY. — CHICKEN. two. Ten minutes previous to serving, moisten the Tagout’ with a few spoonfuls of ‘velouté’-sauce, reduced with extract of mushrooms ; keep it for ten minutes in the ‘bain-marie’. When ready to serve, dish it up in a border of rice. ' 777. Chickens of the Sahara. — Singe two middling-sized chickens, pluck them carefully, chop their livers and gizzards with a pound of lean mutton; add a chopped onion, salt, pepper, pimento, pounded ginger, a handful of bread- crumbs, and a whole egg ; mix this (mince well together, divide it into small parts, the size of a walnut; which roll, on a floured table. Cut up the chickens in joints ; put them into a stewpan, with the backs divided in two; add three or four whole small onions, a hunch of parsley, and two table- I spoonfuls of lard; then fry the chickens, tossing them, till of a nice color. Season i them, sprinkle over two tablespoonfuls of flour, and moisten to height with broth ; add a point of cayenne, and a teaspoonful of red Spanish pepper ; let the sauce boil, stirring, and at the first bubbling remove it on a moderate tire, and put warm ashes on the lid. When the chickens are done, add to them the small balls of mince, cover the stewpan, continue boiling gently for a few minutes; then dish them with the balls, and strain the sauce over. 778. Chickens with fine-herbs. — Divide three small, young, and tender chickens, each of them in four parts. Butter thickly the bottom of a stewpan, place on it a layer of fine-herbs; onion, shalot, fresh mushrooms, all of which chopped, and a bunch of parsley. On the fine-herbs place the legs of the chickens, season, and sprinkle them over also with fine-herbs ; close the stewpan hermetically, set it on a good fire with warm ashes on its lid ; and cook the chickens for eighteen or twenty minutes ; dish them up, baste the fine-herbs with a little melted glaze, and pour them over the chickens. 779. Chickens, Nizza fashion. — Singe a good chicken, draw it, and break up its breast-bone with the point of a large knife. Fry in a stewpan two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion with melted bacon fat; add to it six ounces of good rice, well washed, and drained on a sieve; heat it stirring, moisten then to height with gravy, and boil it for ten or twelve minutes at the most; it should be barely caught. Then take it off the fire, add a pinch of pounded pimento, and a little ‘salpicon’ of raw ham. With this preparation stuff the chicken, truss it as for boiling, cover the breast with bacon, and place it in a stewpan, with three tablespoonfuls of lard. Set the stewpan on a moderate fire, place live embers on the lid, and let the chicken take color all over. Half an hour after, moisten with a glass of white wine, add a small piece of glaze, and finish cooking gently.342 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. Twenty minutes previous to serving, melt a piece of lard or butter in a frying- pan, add to it six ounces of ham in squares, and four or five good tomatas, freed of seed, and each of them divided in four pieces; which season with pepper, nutmeg, and a little salt ; add a bunch of parsley, with a clove of garlic; and toss them over the fire, until their moisture be evaporated. Now drain the fat off the frying-pan, and pour ham and tomatas into the stewpan, round the chicken ; seven or eight minutes after, drain the chicken, remove the string, and dish it up. Sprinkle over the tomatas a little chopped parsley, take out the aromatics, and place them round the chicken. 780. Chickens, Valencia fashion. — Truss two middling-sized chickens, as for boiling ; put them into a stewpan with lard, fry them for a few minutes ; season, and add two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion, four tablespoonfuls of raw ham in dice, and a clove of garlic ; fry the meats a few minutes longer ; add two small ‘chorisos’, a bay-leaf, a point of saffron, and a teaspoonful of mild red Spanish pepper; then moisten the chickens with a sufficient quantity of broth to cover, lay over a round of buttered paper, and boil them over a moderate fire, not to reduce the moisture too much ; when about done, plunge into the stewpan some rice (one glass of rice to two of stock) ; cover the stewpan, keep the stock boiling for a quarter of an hour, then place it at the entrance of the oven, or on warm ashes, and thus keep it for seven or eight minutes ; the rice should be then sufficiently cooked, dish it up ; place the chickens on the top, and the ‘chorisos’ all round. 781. Chicken-croquettes. — Cut some white breast-meat of cooked chickens in small dice, put it into a kitchen-basin with a few cooked chickens’ livers, a third of its volume of mushrooms, and the same of pickled tongue or ham ; the whole being cut in dice. Add to this ‘salpicon’ a quarter its volume of chicken or veal ‘quenelle’ force-meat, a few tablespoonfuls of good sauce, or incited glaze, cold, and also a little nutmeg. Divide the preparation with a spoon into equal parts, the size of a small egg, roll them on a table sprinkled with bread-crumb, thus shaping them in a cylindric form ; dip them into beaten eggs, and bread-crumb again; plunge them afterwards in hot hog’s-lard, to let them take color ; drain, and dish them up, in pyramids, on a folded napkin, with fried parsley on both sides. 782. Fillets of chickens, larded; with purée of mushrooms (D. 141). — Take out ten chicken-fillets, all from one side of the breast; pare them, leaving the stump-bone adhering; lard, and place them in a flat stewpan, masked with bacon and raw fat; salt slightly, moisten to height with good broth; which reduce quickly to half, and draw the stewpan on a moderate fire, with warm ashes on its lid ; or set it at the entrance of the oven, to cool the fillets, glazing them.343 POULTRY. — CHICKEN. On the other hand, prepare a ‘quenelle’ force-meat with the meat of the legs, and poach it in a plain border-mould.

Mask Fig. 141. the bottom of the dish with a little brown-sauce, reduced with the stock of the fillets, a little white wine, and the trimmings of the mushrooms. Pour the remainder into a sauceboat. 783. Fat chicken larded, with risot (D. 142). — Break up the breast- bone of a good fat chicken, previously drawn and singed, put in the inside a piece of chopped beef-marrow, truss it, as for boiling; singe the breast anew, to set the flesh, then lard it with fine-cut bacon. Put the chicken then into a proportionate Fig. 142. I stewpan, spread with trimmings of bacon and sliced vegetables, moisten with three gills of broth; cover the stewpan, set it on a brisk fire, and reduce the liquid to a glaze; moisten the chicken anew, to a third its height, with broth and white wine; let the stock boil up, and remove the pan on a moderate fire, cooking the chicken for three quarters of an hour with warm ashes on the lid, glazing it to a nice color. Risot. — Twenty-five minutes previous to serving, chop an onion, put it into a stewpan, fry with melted beef-marrow, and add to it fourteen ounces of rice, washed and well drained ; warm it, stirring with a spoon ; when set, moisten to double its344 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. height with broth, and cook it, until all the moisture is absorbed; then strain its stock from the chicken, which must now be done ; skim off the fat, and add it to the rice; cover the stewpan ; when the rice is done, gradually introduce into it four ounces of grated parmesan, two tablespoonfuls of tomata-sauce, and live ounces of butter; then dish it up, and place the chicken on it, being freed from the string, and glazed. 784. Croquettes of chicken, à la Soubise. — Prepare a ‘salpicon’ of chicken, add to it some pickled ox-tongue and mushrooms, and keep it covered in a small stewpan. Cut up four large onions in quarters, plunge them into boiling water, and boil them for a quarter of an hour ; drain them, put them into a smaller stewpan w#ith a piece of butter, season with salt and pepper, and stew them on a moderate fire, covered, until their moisture be evaporated. Bruise them with a spoon, sprinkle over two tablespoonfuls of flour ; and moisten, by degrees, with a little good milk, in order to obtain a sauce of the consistency of a firm ‘bechamel’-sauce; reduce it on the fire, stirring, until the onion be quite done. Then add to it a few tablespoonfuls of melted glaze; two seconds after, pass it through a sieve; and gradually mix with it the ‘salpicon’, so as to keep its consistency ; spread it on a baking-sheet, to cool; then shape it into ‘croquettes’, bread-crumb, fry, drain, and dish them up on a folded napkin. 785. Small chickens, with cream. — Singe three small young chickens; draw, and truss them as for boiling ; cover them with bacon, and place in a pro- portionate stewpan, spread with sliced vegetables, a few trimmings of raw ham, and trimmings of fresh mushrooms ; add a bunch of parsley, moisten the chickens to height with good broth, start the liquid to ebullition, and draw the stewpan over a moderate fire, with warm ashes on the lid ; boil the chickens for thirty-five or forty minutes, strain their stock, and skim off the fat. While the chickens are doing, boil with butter and lemon-juice two dozen fresh button-mushrooms. Pour into a stewpan the third of a quart of good ‘béchamel -sauce, a little consistent ; reduce it, stirring ; add to it, by degrees, the liquor of the chickens, which should be reduced to half-glaze, and a few tablespoonfuls of mushroom- liquor, freed of fat ; when the sauce is ready, draw it off the fire, and introduce into it a piece of good butter ; take the string off the chickens, which place in a triangular form on a dish, with the legs to the centre; arrange on each of them eight button- mushrooms, and mask chickens and garnish with the cream-sauce passed through a tammy. 786. Fontange patties (D. 143 and 144). — Place in a kitchen-basin four ounces of flour, add to it two or three yolks of eggs, a little salt, four table-345 POULTRY. — CHICKEN. spoonfuls of olive-oil, all of which dilute with a gill and a half of tepid water and beer; cover the basin, keep it in the temperature of the kitchen for two hours, then pour the paste into a little stewpan. Have warmed in the fat an iron-mould for 4bntange beignets’, of the shape of little ‘timbales’, such as the drawing represents. As soon as warm, dip it into the paste nearly, but not quite, to the rim ; imme- diately take it out again, plunge it once more into the hot fat, and leave it therein, Fig. 143. Fig. 144. till the paste is done, and can be disengaged from the iron ; now remove the patty, and repeat the operation. When ready to serve, garnish the patties with a ‘salpicon’ composed of poultry - meat, brains, pickled tongue, and mushrooms, thickened with a little good sauce. 787. Chickens sautés, à la Cumberland. — Cut up two chickens, each in five parts. Butter thickly a flat stewpan, strew it with sliced onion, on which place the pieces of chicken with their backs and pinions; season them, add a bunch of parsley, and fry them on a slow fire, with warm ashes on the lid of the stewpan, but without allowing either chickens, or onions, to take color. As soon as the pieces are done, take them out, and pare them ; add then to the onions a few spoonfuls of good reduced ‘bechamel’-sauce, not too thick ; let it boil, remove the parsley, and thicken the sauce with a small pat of cayenne butter ; put the chickens back into the sauce, to warm them without ebullition ; dish them up, mask them with the sauce, and surround with fried and glazed bread-‘croûtons’. 788. Pigeon-‘tourte’.— With a pound of flour, and the same of butter, prepare some puff-paste (No. 403), observing to fold it simply on its length after the fifth turn given ; roll it out then half an inch thick, let it rest for ten minutes, then cut out from its flat a strip two feet long by one inch wide. Gather up the trimmings, divide them in two parts, roll them out round ; one in a flat, ten inches in diameter, to form the bottom of the ‘tourte’ ; and the other a little larger, to form its top ; spread the smaller one on a round baking-sheet. On the other hand, prepare a pound and a quarter of veal ‘quenelle’ force-meat (No. 527) ; with the third of it prepare some small round or oval ‘quenelles’, rolling346 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. them on a floured table ; mix with the remainder a few spoonfuls of fine-herbs, and put them by. Cut up three pigeons, each of them in four parts; put them into a stewpan, with five ounces of chopped bacon-fat, and half a pound of streaky bacon in pieces; set the stewpan on the fire, fry the pigeons until half-done, season, moisten with a gill of white wine ; which reduce, and add to the pigeons a few spoonfuls of cooked fine- herbs , and the pigeon-livers; after two minutes, take the whole off the fire, and let them cool. Spread the flat on the baking-sheet, with half of the remaining force-meat, in a layer coming within an inch and a half of the edges ; thereon set the pigeons in a dome-like way, stop the interstices with the bacon and fine-herbs, cover the dome with the remainder of the force-meat ; which again cover with thin layers of bacon, then apply the second flat of paste, finish and bake the ‘tourte’, proceeding as directed in No. 333, and leave it in the oven for an hour and a quarter. When done, slip it on a dish, make a round incision on the dome, opening it, and through this opening remove the bacon, and fill the hollow with the poached ‘quenelles’ ; over which pour a little good thickened gravy, wherein a few little fresh mushrooms have been cooked ; cover the ‘tourte’, and send up separately the remainder of the sauce, mixed up with mushrooms and ‘quenelles’. 789. Pigeons roasted, German fashion. — Draw three pigeons, break up the breast-bone, and take it out. Soak half a pound of white bread-crumb, press it to extract its moisture, put it into a stewpan, bruise it with a spoon, and add a piece of butter, salt and pepper, three raw yolks of eggs, and a handful of small currants, well cleansed. With this preparation stuff the pigeons, thus giving them a plump appearance; truss them, place them in a roasting-pan, pour over some butter, season, and roast them in a moderate oven, turning. When ready to serve, remove the string, dish up, and pour over their cooking-stock. 790. Fillets of pigeons, ‘a la Chartreuse’ (D. 145). — Take out the fillets of seven pigeons, trim away the sinewy skin, beat slightly, season, and arrange them on the bottom of a flat stewpan, with clarified butter. Scoop with a vegetable-spoon some small balls of carrots and turnips ; boil them in salted water, keeping them a little firm, wipe them on a cloth, and when cold, apply them all round the sides of a plain buttered border-mould in circles, alternating them. Fill the hollow of the border with force-meat, or witli a pre- paration of potatoes, as for ‘croquettes’; and keep the border in the ‘bain-marie for one hour.PIGEON. POULTRY. 347 When ready to serve, fry the fillets of pigeons on a brisk fire, turning; drain I off the butter, baste them with a few tablespoonfuls of glaze, and keep them at the entrance of the oven, for a few seconds only. Turn the border out on a dish, fill its centre with a macedoine garnish of young’vegetables, slightly thickened with Fig. 145. béchamel-sauce; set the fillets on the top of the border, overlapped, and almost upright. Send up separately a boatful of brown-sauce, prepared with the legs and bones of the pigeons. 791. Chartreuse Of pigeons (D. 146). — With a small tin-cutter cut up some small sticks of carrots and turnips, half an inch long. Those stamped in carrot should be cut off the red parts only, and those in turnip should be kept a Fig. 146. tenth longer, in order to be able to place, on one white stick disposed transversally, four red ones. Boil the vegetables in salted water, but only till three-parts done; drain, wipe them on a cloth, and when cold, apply them against the sides (spread with buttered paper), of an oval ‘timbale’-mould, in the order shown by the drawing. Support the vegetables, by applying inwardly a thin layer of force-meat : the bottom of the mould must also be spread with force-meat. Blanch a cabbage, braise it with a pound of streaky bacon, previously blanched, and a small raw sausage.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 348 Truss four good pigeons with the legs inside; braise them, divide them after- wards in four parts, trim away the skin and bones ; arrange them in a stewpan, and pour over a few spoonfuls of brown-sauce. When the cabbage is done, press it, to drain off the moisture and fat; remove the stalk, and bruise it. Cut up the bacon and sausage, one in squares, the other in slices; then place in the hollow of the Timbale', in alternate layers, the cabbage, bacon, sausage, and pigeons. Cover the top with a layer of force-meat, and poach the ‘chartreuse’ in the ‘bain-marie’ for three quarters of an hour. Whilst the ‘chartreuse’ is preparing, braise some cabbage-lettuces. Boil, in salted water, some green-pease, green asparagus, white asparagus, and cucumbers. A few minutes previous to serving, turn the ‘timbale’ out on a baking-sheet, without taking off the mould, in order to drain the moisture; slip it afterwards on an oval dish, and surround the base with small ‘bouquets’ or groups of asparagus alternated with the green-pease, asparagus-heads, and cucumbers, the last glazed. Leave the lettuces scrolhvise on the top, with a small heap of green-pease on the centre; send up separately in a sauceboat, the cooking-stock of the pigeons, thickened with a little sauce. 792. Pigeons stuffed, Italian fashion. — Singe three young pigeons, draw, and bone the breast. Chop ten ounces of fresh fat-bacon with six raw sheep’s kidneys, and a few blanched chickens’ livers, add to them the same volume of bread- crumb, soaked in broth and pressed, three yolks of eggs, salt, pepper, and a little chopped parsley. Stuff the pigeons with this farce, sew the breast-skin underneath, truss them with the legs inside, and place them in a narrow stewpan, previously spread with minced vegetables and a little ham ; moisten to half-height with broth, cover them with a round of buttered paper, and let the stock boil up ; seven or eight minutes after, draw the stewpan on a moderate fire, to finish cooking the pigeons, basting, and turning them frequently ; when done, drain them on a dish. Dilute the cooking-stock with a little gravy, and half a glass of white wine ; let it boil, pass it through a sieve, skim off the fat, reduce it to half-glaze, and thicken it with a few spoonfuls of brown-sauce; then add to it two handfuls of turned olives, slightly blanched, and keep the sauce in the ‘bain marie’. On the other hand, boil in salted water eight ounces of shred fresh-made ‘nouilles’; drain them, season, finish with butter, grated parmesan, and a little tomata-sauce ; dish them up ; divest the pigeons of the string, and place them on the ‘nouilles’. Pour the sauce with olives into a sauceboat, and send it up separately. 793. Pigeons with cray-fish, German fashion. — Odd as this dish may appear at first, we nevertheless arrive at the conclusion, that there is nothing349 POULTRY. — PIGEON. in it incompatible with our own taste, or with the principles of good cookery. It is no more extraordinary, to eat pigeons with cray-fish, than eating beefsteaks with oyster-sauce, or anchovy-butter. This line of argument is, to my thinking, strictly i logical. Take out the breast-bone of two or three young pigeons ; soak in broth, or milk, a large piece of bread-crumb (eight ounces) ; press it to extract its moisture, and bruise it, with a spoon, in a stewpan ; add to it a piece of butter, a few yolks of eggs, and the cooked livers of the pigeons, and cut up in small dice; season with salt, I pepper, and nutmeg. With this farce stuff the pigeons, sew, truss, and put them into a stewpan, with a piece of butter, a few trimmings of ham, their giblets, four small onions, and a garnished bunch. Set the stewpan on a good fire, fry the pigeons, tossing them ; and as soon of a light color, sprinkle over a pinch of flour, and moisten to height with broth and white wine, half of each ; let the stock boil, add to it a few trimmings of ham; five or six minutes after, cover the stewpan, draw it on a moderate fire, and thus finish cooking the pigeons. When ready to serve, drain them, remove the string, pass the sauce through a sieve into another stewpan, reduce it for two minutes, thicken with three yolks of eggs, then finish it with a piece of crayfish butter, and add four dozen cooked crayfish-tails, pickled and trimmed. Dish the pigeons up then on a hot dish, mask them with the sauce, and surround with the garnish. 794. Pigeons, with fresh green-pease — Singe three or four pigeons, draw them, truss them with the legs inside, and put them into a stewpan, with melted bacon, and two small onions ; salt slightly, and fry them ; when of a nice color, add to them half a pound of streaky bacon in large dice, moisten to half their height with good broth, and continue the ebullition over a moderate fire, until they be half-done. Then introduce into it half a quart of fresh pease, and a stet of parsley ; cover the stew-pan, and keep it on a moderate fire, with hot ashes on the lid, giving the stew from time to time a jerk. When the pigeons are done, drain, and remove the string ; take out the fagot and onions, thicken the green-pease with a piece of kneaded- butter, and dish the pigeons up on the pease. 795. Pigeons, Valencia fashion. — Soak for one hour, in water, a pound of raw ham ; wipe, and cut it up in small squares. Cut up three pigeons, each of them in four parts, put them into an earthen-pan, that can go on the fire ; season, and fry them on a moderate fire, with lard ; when of a nice color, add to them the squares of ham, and five minutes after, take them out with the ham, leaving the fat in the pan ; add to the fat a chopped onion, fry it to a light-brown color, add to it ten ounces of rice, previously washed and drained on a sieve for one hour, fry it for aCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 350 few seconds, and moisten with broth three times its height. Let the liquid boil, add to it the pigeons and ham, a garnished fagot, and a pinch of red Spanish pepper. After five minutes’ ebullition, cover the pan, and remove it on the side of the fire, placing some hot ashes on its lid. When the rice is done, serve the stew in the same pan it has been cooked in. 79G. Pigeon-pie, English fashion. — Take three or four small young pigeons, draw, and singe them ; cut off the claws, and the pinions ; divide each pigeon into two or four parts. Mask the bottom of a pie-dish with a few thin slices of beef-fillet, season the meat with salt and pepper, place the pigeons on the meat, add then six or eight cooked yolks of eggs ; season the pigeons also with salt and pepper, moisten them nearly to height with good gravy, cool. Moisten the rim of the dish Avitli water, mask it with a thin strip of puff-paste; then cover the pigeons, and dish, with a flat of the same paste; finish the pie, pro- ceeding as said in No. f)9G; egg it, place it on a baking-sheet, bake it for an hour and a quarter, in a moderate oven, taking care to co\Ter the paste with paper, as soon as it begins to take color. The pies can be served either hot or cold ; if they are intended to be eaten cold, it will be well to mix a little aspic-jelly with the gravy. 797. Pigeons, Périgueux fashion. — Draw and singe three good, young, and fat pigeons; break up the breast-bone, and stuff them with ‘quenelle’ force-meat, mixed up with a quarter its volume of raw ham in dice; truss the pi- geons, as for an entrée ; co\Ter them both over and underneath, with bacon ; set them on the spit, all round, wrapped up in buttered paper, and roast them at a good fire for twenty-five minutes ; take them off the fire, divest them of the bacon, and string; dish up, and mask them with ‘Pcrigueux’-sauce. 798. Pigeon-pie in ‘terrine’, Provence fashion. — Prepare a raw mince of pork in the conditions prescribed in No. 685 ; bone two or three young pigeons, season, and stuff them with a part of the prepared mince, previously mixed up with a ‘salpicon’ of raw ham, and a few spoonfuls of cooked fine-herbs. Sew the pigeons, and set them in melted fat-bacon. Line a pie-‘terrine’, Strasburg or Toulouse fashion, Avitli a layer of mince at the bottom, and all round ; divest the pigeons of the string, place them on the mince, surround them with a few raw mushrooms, cover them with a layer of mince, and then with thin layers of bacon ; set the terrine on a baking-sheet, push it into a moderate oven, and bake it for tAvo hours and a quarter, basting often with the fat running out. Ten minutes after removing the ‘terrine’ from the oven, set a light Aveight oA'er it, and thus let it cool. When ready to serve, cut it up in slices, and dish up.POULTRY. — PIGEON. 351 799. Timbale of pigeons with olives (D. 147). — Turn (and stone) six dozen fine salted olives, plunge them into cold water, drain, and stuff them, by the aid of a cornet, with raw ‘quenelle’ force-meat ; put them carefully back into shape, then plunge them into hot water, to blanch, until the force-meat be firm set; then drain them, wipe them on a cloth, and set them up, in rows, on the bottom and against the sides (spread with buttered paper) of a ‘timbale’-mould, carefully support- ing them straight with a layer of force-meat ; keep the mould on ice. Fig. 147. On the other hand, take three nice pigeons, cut up each of them in four parts, put them into a stewpan with butter ; fry, season, and add to them eight ounces of streaky bacon in squares. When of a nice color, moisten with a gill of white wine ; which reduce, then moisten with a few spoonfuls of brown-sauce ; finish braising them on a very slow fire, and add a few blanched chickens’ livers, cut up in quarters ; remove the whole off the fire, and let them cool. Three quarters of an hour previous to serving, fill the cavity of the ‘timbale’ with the prepared stew of pigeons, mask i the top with a layer of force-meat, on which lay a round of buttered paper ; poach the ‘timbale’ in the ‘bain-marie’, turn it out upside down on its dish, on the bottom of which pour a little brown-sauce. 800. French pigeon-pie. — Truss three pigeons with the legs inside, put them into a stewpan, with four small onions and some butter; season, fry them to a nice color on a moderate fire, then add ten ounces of streaky bacon, sprinkle over a tablespoonful of flour ; two minutes after, moisten about to height with broth and white wine. Boil the stew for a quarter of an hour, add to it a few boiled salsifies in pieces, a few raw mushrooms, and a little cayenne ; when the pigeons are half-done, take the stew off the fire. Spread the bottom and sides of a pie-dish, with short-paste, or trimmings of puff- paste; arrange the stew in the dish, and mask it with a flat of t’*3 same paste, which apply to the sides, cut it level with the edges of the dish, and channel all352 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. round (see No. 596). Ornament the top with a few leaves in paste, egg the pie, set the dish on a baking-sheet, and push the pie into a moderate oven, to bake for three quarters of an hour, being careful to cover the paste, when beginning to take color. When done, take the pie out, and place it on another dish, covered with a folded napkin. 801. Young pigeons in a case. — Singe four young pigeons, draw them, bone the breast, and till them with ‘quenelle’ force-meat, mixed up with a ‘salpicon’ of raw ham, and a few spoonfuls of cooked fine-herbs ; truss them neatly, with the legs inside, and cover them with thin layers of bacon. Spread the bottom of a stewpan with bacon in dice, a sliced onion, a few trim- mings of mushrooms, cloves, peppercorns, and a garnished fagot ; place the pigeons in the stewpan, moisten with three gills of white wine, let the liquid boil; five minutes after, cover the stewpan, and set it at the entrance of the oven, or on a very slow fire with warm ashes on the lid ; take out the pigeons, as soon as done. On the other hand, fry in butter five or six chickens’ livers ; season, pound, and pass them through a sieve ; mix with this force-meat the same volume of scraped fat- bacon, and as much of raw peeled and chopped truffles ; and season well. Oil an entree paper-case, spread the bottom with a layer of the prepared force- meat; divest the pigeons of the string, and place them thereon, glaze them with a paste-brush, set the case on a baking-sheet covered with thick paper, cover it also with paper, and place the baking-sheet on a trivet at the entrance of the oven, thus warming the pigeons gently for a quarter of an hour. Meanwhile, remove the fat from the pigeons’ stock, mix in a little brown- sauce, and a little madeira, as well as the trimmings of truffles ; reduce the sauce one third, pass it through a sieve, and add to it a small garnish of chickens’ livers. When ready to serve, take the case out of the oven, dish up, pour over a little sauce; the remainder of which send up separately in a sauceboat. 802. ‘Epigrammes’ of pigeons. — Take out the fillets of three pigeons, proceeding as for those of chickens. Remove away the sinewy skin, and the minion- fillets, pare, beat them lightly with the blade of a knife, and apply them on the larger fillets; which season, place one beside the other, in a flat stewpan, with clari- fied butter, and cover them with buttered paper. With the trimmings of the fillets, the meat of the legs, and an equal volume of poultry flesh', prepare some ‘quenelle’ force-meat (see No. 740) ; when ready, take up six tablespoonfuls of it, put them on a floured table, and roll each spoonful into the shape of a pear ; flatten them with the blade of a knife, to give them the form of a fillet of pigeon, place them evenly in a small buttered sauté-pan, and poachPOULTRY. — GOOSE. 353 them in boiling water; drain, and let them cool ; dip them into beaten eggs, mixed up with cooked fine-herbs; then roll them in bread-crumbs, and smooth them with the blade of a knife.

Fry at the same time the fillets of pigeons on both sides ; as soon as set, drain the butter off, pour over them three tablespoon- fuls of glaze, mixed up with a little madeira ; let it boil, and draw the stewpan off the fire ; then dish the fillets up, in a circular order, alternated with the fillets of force-meat ; fill the centre with a purée of chestnuts, and pour on the bottom of the dish, and over the purée, a little good reduced gravy, prepared with the bones i of the pigeons. 803. Scollops of fat-liver, Alsace fashion. — Cut up a small fat- liver in transversal slices ; which season, flour, and arrange in a flat stewpan with clarified blitter ; fry them on both sides; as soon as done, take them out on a dish by the aid of a fork. Put into a stewpan, wherein the scollops have been fried, two table- spoonfuls of chopped onion and shalbt, fry them, and add to them five or six mush- rooms, also chopped; when their moisture is reduced, season, and moisten with a quarter of a wineglassful of madeira, and double this volume of brown-sauce; let it boil for a few minutes, put the scollops back into the stewpan, warm them without ebullition, dish them up in a circle, and mask them with the sauce. 804. ‘Attereaux’ of fat-liver. — Take the half of a cold cooked fat- liver; divide it into squares, half an inch by the fifth of an inch; put them into a kitchen-basin, add the same volume of squares of cooked pickled ox-tongue, of the same size ; season, sprinkle over a handful of chopped truffles, and pour over a few spoonfuls of ‘Villeroi’-sauce, finished at the moment ; roll them in this sauce, masking them with a coating, and let them cool.

On the other hand, blanch half a cabbage, and divide it in small parts ; which braise. Ten minutes previous to serving the stew, mix in it the blanched livers, divided in pieces ; then dish the meats up on the centre of a dish, and surround with the vegetables and small groups of cabbage. 800. Shells of fat-liver, with mushrooms. — Cut up in dice half or three parts of a fat-liver ; put this ‘salpicon’ into a stewpan, with half its volume of cooked mushrooms, also in dice ; season, and keep it covered. Pour into a flat stewpan about three gills of ‘béchamel’-sauce {see No. 1G2), re- duce it on the fire, stirring with the spoon, and add to it, by degrees, a few table- spoonfuls of melted glaze ; when the sauce is succulent enough, without being too thick, mix with it the ‘salpicon’. Warm the preparation, without letting it boil, and fill with it ten table-shells ; smooth the top, sprinkle over bread-crumbs, and sala- mander. Then dish up the shells on a folded napkin. 807. Goose’s fat-liver, Périgueux-sauce. — Get a good fat-liver, not steeped in water, divide it into scollops, as regular as possible ; which season with salt and pepper; flour, dip into beaten eggs, and bread-crumb them.

Take Fig. 148. it up afterwards, with a spoon, in parts of the size of a walnut; roll them into the shape of small pears, and wrap them up in a layer of rice, cooked ‘a l’Italienne’, and kept firm ; then bread-crumb the 'croquettes’, fry, and dish them on a folded napkin. 809. Fat-liver with truffles (D. 149). — The fat-liver shown by the drawing, weighed a little more than two pounds ; such livers being not scarce at Tou- Fig. 149. louse or Strasburg. In such condition one fat-liver alone may suffice for an entree ; but if smaller, two or three will be required. In all cases, one should try to get good livers, which do not deteriorate by the cooking. Take away the gall of the fat-liver; make on each side, of the smooth sur- face, transversal incisions; into which slip some thick slices of raw truffles, cut up slantwise off the centre.356 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. Fry with melted bacon , a little ‘mirepoix’ of vegetables and aromatics ; let it cool, spread it on the liver, mask it with thin layers of bacon, and wrap up the liver with a flat of common paste ; place it on a baking-sheet, and bake it in the oven for one hour. On the other hand, get fifteen nice, black, raw truffles; pick them (without peeling) with the greatest care, and cook them with madeira for seven or eight minutes. Take their liquor, and gradually introduce it into three gills of boiling brown-sauce : when ready reduced, pass it through a tammy. * Ten minutes previous to serving, unpack the liver, place it directly on a dish, or on a bread-support, fried, and masked with force-meat ; dish the truffles round ; mask the liver and truffles with the sauce. This entrée, of a simple and easy execution, is a real amateur’s dish, and may be served in the choicest dinners. The truffles surrounding the liver may be peeled. 810. Goose, roasted, Mecklenburg fashion. — Draw a fat goose, wash it inwardly, and wipe it with a cloth. Cut up seven or eight good apples in quarters; peel them, remove the core, and put them into a kitchen-basin. Pick fourteen ounces of sultanas and currants, wash them in tepid water, wipe, and mix them with the apples ; season the preparation with a little pounded cinnamon ; add to it three handfuls of rasped bread-crumb, and two eggs. With this preparation stuff the goose; sew up the openings, truss, and place it in a roasting-dish with a glass of water ; spread it with butter, cover it with a strong paper, and bake it in a moderate oven for two hours, frequently basting with its own fat. Whilst the goose is roasting, chop up a large red cabbage, put it into an earthen stewpan, with salt and a little broth, cook it gently: it should be kept a little firm. When three-parts done, add to it six long sausages, slightly fried with some goose-fat. When the cab- bage is about done, pour in a few tablespoonfuls of vinegar. When the goose is quite done, unpack, and place it on an oblong dish, surround it with the red cabbage and sausages ; add a little broth to the cooking-stock, let it boil for two minutes ; pass it, skim off the fat, and pour it into a sauceboat. 811. Terrine of fat liver, Strasburg fashion (D. 150). — In all countries, ‘terrines’, ‘timbales’, pies, and even boxes, of Strasburg fat-livers, are sold; therefore, unless when living in places where fat-livers are plentiful and good, it will be better to buy the ‘terrines’ ready made, than to prepare them. The question is, to get them from a good house. A few hours before serving the ‘terrine’, have it embedded in ice, thus letting the inside get firm, take away the layer of fat covering the preparation ; then cut it byPOULTRY. — GOOSE. 357 the aid of a tablespoon, either of iron, or else of steel made for this purpose, which dip every time in hot water ; the pieces scooped out should be of the same shape and length as the spoon.

Goose braised, Strasburg fashion (D. 151). — Get a fat goose with a smooth breast, and the squares (marked on the skin) fine and small, Fig. 151. those being the signs of the tenderness of a goose. Draw, singe it well, and fill it with a raw mince of pork, slightly seasoned, mixed up with a handful of bread-crumbs, and a little chopped parsley. Sew up the skin on the back, cut off the pinions and leg-bones at the joint, then truss the goose ; place it in a stewpan, the bottom of which is spread with its fat, and sliced vegetables ; moisten it with half a quart of358 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. broth, salt very slightly, and reduce the liquid on a brisk fire; again moisten the goose to height with half a bottle of wine, and some broth; add to it a bunch of aromatics, cloves, and peppercorns; let the stock boil, and remove the stewpan on a moderate fire ; cover the goose with buttered paper, braise it gently for three hours, with hot ashes on the lid, basting frequently. A quarter of an hour previous to serving, pass the cooking-stock, skim off the fat, which put back to the goose, keeping it hot ; reduce the stock to half-glaze, thicken with a little brown-sauce; reduce the sauce, stirring, and introducing into it a gill of white wine : when ready, keep it in the ‘bain-marie’. At the last moment, remove the string from the goose, and dish it up ; surround it with groups of small cooked sausages, and groups of chestnuts, braised short of moisture with broth, and glazed. Pour a little of the prepared sauce over the goose, sending the remainder in a sauceboat, and put a ruffle on each leg. Of the goose the breast is cut up, according to the method applied to ducks. It is only in quite a family-dinner, that the legs can be handed round. 813. Goose’s fat-liver, Strasburg fashion. — Get a good large fat- liver, not kept in water; remove the gall, and its surrounding parts, if they were green; lard it inwardly, and underneath, with fillets of fresh truffles, season with salt and spices, put it into a kitchen-basin, and baste it with two tablespoonfuls of madeira-wine.

Butter a small hot pie-mould, set it on a baking-sheet spread with paper, and line it with short-paste (see No. 196) ; mask the bottom and sides with some of the mince, then with a round flat of paste ; ornament it, and leave a small hole on the centre ; egg the pie, push it into a moderate oven, and bake it for an hour and a half; but remember to cover it with paper, as soon as the paste begins to take color. When done, take the top off, wipe the fat away as well as possible, and dish up the pic; mask it with a little good brown-sauce, reduced with madeira and a few trim- mings of truffles ; put back the top into place, and serve immediately. 816.

Then salt it, remove the string, and dish it up ; skim the fat from the stock in the roasting-pan, mix it with a little good gravy, let it boil, pass, and pour it into a sauceboat. 818. Wild-goose, with sour-crout. — Let a wild goose hang for several days, then pluck it, draw, wash it inwardly, put inside the body a bunch of aromatics; truss it, place it in a fitting braising-pan, previously spread with vege- tables, and trimmings of fat-bacon ; moisten, half its height, with broth and wine; salt slightly, add to it aromatics, cloves, and peppercorns ; cover the goose with a buttered paper ; start the stock to ebullition, draw the pan on a moderate tire ; place some hot ashes on its lid, and braise the goose gently for several hours, being careful to turn, and to probe it. When done, drain it ; divest it of the string, and dish it up on a garnish of sour-crout ; pass the cooking-stock through a sieve, skim the fat off reduce it to half-glaze, and pour it into a sauceboat. 819.

Rissoles of fat-liver (D. 152). — Prepare a ‘salpicon’ of cooked fat- liver (about ten ounces), and put it into a small covered stewpan. Cut up in small dice a third its volume of raw peeled truffles, and put them by also. Put into a flat stewpan six tablespoonfuls of ‘bechamel’- sauce, and the same of brown-sauce ; reduce them together ; when the sauce is of a good consistence, add to it four tablespoonfuls of madeira, and the ‘salpicon’ of raw truffles ; reduce it stirring, and gradually introducing into it a few tablespoonfuls of melted glaze ; when it is ready, take it off the fire, and mix it with the ‘salpicon’ of fat-liver : there should be sauce enough to thicken the ‘salpicon’ with; if it were too liquid, or too abundant, it would run out of the ‘rissoles’ while cooking. Let the preparation cool completely.POULTRY. — DUCK. 361 Roll out, on a floured table, a pound and a quarter of fine short-paste, or some half puff-paste, in a square flat; then arrange on one side, in a straight row, and at equal distances, small balls of the preparation ; wet the paste, fold it over the prepa- ration, and cut out the ‘rissoles’ in a crescent shape. Dip them into beaten eggs, and Fig. 152. bread-crumb them. When ready to serve, plunge them into plenty of hot fat, fry them on a moderate fire, drain, and dish them forming two circles, on a folded napkin, fill the hollow of the top-circle with fried parsley. 821. Ducklings roasted (D. 153). — The ducklings of Rouen are the most esteemed in France. Indeed, they are generally of a superior quality and remarkable beauty. Fig. 153. Get two fat ducklings, draw, wash them inwardly, and put inside a small bunch of aromatics ; singe them carefully, twist the legs over the drum-stick, and truss them, fixing this bone in upright position. Set them on the spit, and roast them by a good fire for twenty-five minutes, basting with a paste-brush dipped in clarified butter. A few seconds previous to taking the ducklings off the fire, salt them ; divest them of the string, and place them on an oblong dish, the breast towards the end of the dish. Put on the centre some water-cresses, and send up separately a sauceboat of good gravy.362 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY.

Fillets of cercelles, orange-sauce. — Draw and truss four cer- celles, run them through with an iron skewer, and roast them at a good tire for twelve or fourteen minutes, basting with a paste-brush dipped in oil ; when done, salt, and take them off the tire ; slip the fillets out, and put them into a flat stewpan, with a little glaze at the bottom -, heat them for one minute over a brisk tire, to dry up the moisture of the fillets, then dish them up in a circle, and mask with the following sauce : Orange-sauce. — Cut the zest of a large, yet green orange, cut in tine shreds, which boil in water, and drain on a sieve ; then put them into a small stewpan, and add half a pint of reduced brown-sauce. When ready to serve, stir the sauce, intro- ducing into it, off the fire, the juice of the orange, and that of a lemon. 823. ‘Terrine’ of fat-liver of duck (D. 154). — Choose two good duck-livers, remove their gall, as well as the parts surrounding it, as they are gener- ally bitter. Divide each of the livers into three parts, pare them, keep the parings for after-use; season the livers with salt, and good spices, pour over half a glassful of madeira. Carefully pluck, and peel, a pound of fresh truffles; divide the small ones in two pieces, the larger ones in quarters ; season with salt and spices, mix them up with the livers. Pound the trimmings of the truffles and livers with half a pound of fresh bacon, previously chopped; pass it through a sieve. Chop fine half a pound of lean veal or pork, as well as five ounces of raw ham ; put this meat into a mortar, pound it; add to it the bacon, pounded with the truffles, and then two tablespoonfuls of cooked fine-herbs. Season the preparation with salt and good spices; the mixture effected, put it into a kitchen-basin, and add to it two chopped raw truffles, as well as the madeira in which the livers and truffles macerated. Choose a ‘terrine’ of yellow earth, Toulouse-shape ; mask the bottom, as well as sides, with a layer of raw mince previously prepared, kept a little thicker, on the bottom, than on the sides. Place the livers and truffles in the centre, arranging them by layers, and alternating each of these layers with a little mince; raise it in a dome, and cover with fresh bacon; set the ‘terrine’ in a deep baking- sheet, cover it with paper, push it into a moderate oven, frequently baste with the fat of the baking-sheet. Two hours after, cover the vessel with its lid, pour a glass of water into the baking-sheet ; an hour and a half later, take the ‘terrine’ outPOULTRY. — DUCK. 363 of the oven, let it half-cool, put a wooden round on its top, so as to let it cool with a weight on. Twenty-four hours after, dip the Terrine’ into warm water, in order to turn the preparation out; pare now the rough parts, cut it in slices, which divide in the Pig. 154. shape of a long square ; wipe the Terrine’ well, fix it on a dish, arrange the slices in the vessel, in superposed circles, and in a pyramid; till the hollow with chopped jelly, surround the Terrine’ with jelly ‘croûtons’. 824. Timbale of fat-liver (D. 155). — Butter a large dome-mould, the Fig. 155. inside of which adorn with three strips of ‘nouille’-paste, and line the mould with white short-paste. Get a middling-sized firm fat-liver, cut it up in large squares, which put into a stewpan, add half their volume of raw truffles in quarters, season slightly with salt and spices, add a bunch of aromatics, and baste them with four tablespoonfuls ofCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 364 madeira; set the stewpan on a brisk tire to reduce the liquid, then remove the pan off the tire, and let the meat cool. Prepare a mince, with eight ounces of raw chicken-meat, and the same of fresh fat-bacon ; add it to the raw trimmings of truffles, those of liver, and also a few good fat pullets’ livers. Pound, season highly, and pass them through a sieve. With a part of this force-meat, mask the bottom and the sides of the lined mould, with a layer, the fifth of an inch thick ; within the cavity place in layers the fat-liver and truffles, alternating them with force-meat. Cover also the top with force-meat, and then with a flat of paste. Leave a small hole on the centre of the flat, and set the ‘timbale’ on a baking-sheet, spread with ashes, so as to keep it upright; bake it in a moderate oven, for an hour and a half, covered with paper. A quarter of an hour after, being taken out of the oven, pour into the ‘timbale’ two gills of madeira-sauce, mixed up with aspic-jelly. Ten or twelve hours after, turn the ‘timbale’ out on a ‘pain-vert’ ; surround the base with a circle of chopped a spic, and the ‘pain-vert’ with ‘croutons’ of aspic-jelly. Insert in the top a ‘hâtelef-, skewer garnished with a truffle, and a nice white cock’s comb. 825. Canneloni Of Marseille. — This dish is a new creation of the southern school ; it is not without merit, and certainly will please all ‘gourmets’. Plunge into boiling salted water a dozen large ‘canneloni’*; let the water boil for five minutes, then draw the stewpan on the side of the fire, thus cooking the paste gently. Then drain the ‘canneloni’, split them in two lengthwise, and spread them on a cloth. On the other hand, pound the breast of a cooked chicken with a quarter its volume of pullets’ livers or of fat-liver, four tablespoonfuls of chopped cooked ham, and half a cooked calf’s brain ; add a piece of panada, the size of an egg, and three yolks of eggs; pass the preparation through a sieve, spread a small part of it on each of the ‘canneloni’, and roll them up like ‘paupiettes’, thus enclosing the preparation completely; arrange them in a buttered ‘gratin’-dish, baste them with a little rich gravy, mixed up with the same volume of thick tomata-sauce; sprinkle over grated parmesan, pour a little melted butter over, and keep them in a very slow oven for a quarter of an hour, without allowing them to gratinatc; and serve them as soon as taken out of the oven. 826. Ducklings with sour-crout (D. 156). — Braise three ducklings short of moisture, glaze them, cut each of them into five pieces, which then place in a stewpan, moisten with a little brown-sauce ; keep them warm. * The ‘canneloni’ are sold at Marseille, and in Paris. They are pipes of thin paste, about the third of an inch in diameter. They may be prepared with ‘nouille’-paste, rolled out and cut up in oblong squares, three inches by two ; but this paste is less delicate than the genuine ‘canneloni’.365 POULTRY. — DUCK. Meanwhile, cook two pounds of good sour-crout together with two little meat- saveloys for cooking. Half an hour previous to serving, drain the sour-crout on a sieve, pressing them ; spread it in a thick layer on the bottom of a dish, having a sup- port of bread on its centre. Arrange the pieces of duckling on the sour-crout, placing the legs at the bottom, the fillets and breast-pieces above. Insert a ‘hâtelet’-skewer Fig. 156. into the fried bread, surround the sour-crout with the saveloys cut in slices. Serve separately a boatful of sauce. 827. Duck in haricot. — Draw and singe a good fat duck, carve it into six pieces ; cut up also the back, add the neck and pinions. Put the meat into a stewpan with butter, fry it at a moderate fire ; ten minutes afterwards, add a quarter of a pound of fat-bacon, blanched, and divided into squares ; season the meat, sprinkle over a spoonful of flour. Two minutes after, moisten it with a quart of hot broth, stir the stew till ebullition ; cover the stewpan, remove it back on a very gentle fire. Half an hour afterwards, add to the stew a garnish of vegetables, composed of carrots, turnips, celery-roots, cut in balls. If these vegetables were not tender, they i must be blanched. Half an hour afterwards, add to the above a few potatoes, also cut in balls; season the vegetables : they should be done at the same time with the duck. On the other hand, put a dozen raw small onions into a stewpan with a little butter, let them fry to a fine color, season them, moisten with a little broth, boil, and glaze them. Ten minutes previous to serving, add the onions to the stew, skim off the fat, and dish it up. 828. Duck, Bordeaux fashion. — Get a good duck, singe, draw, wash it inwardly, and wipe it with a cloth. Cleanse carefully two or three dozen ‘cèpes’, remove their tails, which pare and chop ; put them into an earthen pan, add a quarter their volume of chopped bacon and ham, the liver of the duck, six fillets of anchovies, a tablespoonful of shalot, and a pinch of parsley, all of which chopped ; season the preparation, and stuff the duck with it ; sew up the openings, truss, and put it into a36G COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. stewpan with chopped bacon, and two whole onions ; fry it on a moderate fire, until of a nice color ; then add to it the heads of ‘cepes’, cut each of them up in two ; sea- son with salt and pepper ; add also a bunch of parsley, containing a clove of garlic. Ten minutes after, moisten with a glass of white wine, let the liquid boil, then draw the stewpan on a moderate fire, with warm ashes on its lid. When the duck is done, drain it, remove the string, and dish it up ; skim the fat of the cooking-stock, thicken it with a little tomata-sauce, give it a few bubblings, pour the garnishes round the duck. 829. Duck’s liver, Toulouse fashion. — Get one or two fat-livers of duck very firm and white, above all, not having been put in water; cut them into slices down their length, and season these with salt and spices. Butter the bottom of a ‘gratin’-dish, or a silver dish ; sprinkle over a pinch of chopped shalot, a handful of fresh mushrooms also chopped, and place on these the slices of liver, intermingled with slices of lemon, freed of peel and pips ; sprinkle them with a little parsley, chopped with a point of garlic, and mixed up with a handful of bread-crumbs; baste them with a paste-brush dipped in clarified butter, and push the dish into a moderate oven. Bake the livers for twenty or twenty-five minutes, basting them with their own stock ; when done, take the dish out of the oven, drain the fat away, and pour over the livers a little melted glaze, mixed up with the juice of one lemon. Set the ‘gratin’-dish on another dish, and send it up. 830. Duck with green-pease. — After having singed and drawn a good fat duck, wash it in warm water, and place inside a piece of butter, or of lard, mixed up with a pinch of chopped parsley ; truss it with the legs inside, and put it into a stewpan with melted bacon. Let it take color on a moderate fire, turning ; season it, and when of a nice color and three-parts done, add to it a pint of fresh green-pease, one onion, a bunch of parsley, and eight ounces of streaky bacon in small squares ; put some hot ashes on the lid of the stewpan, and finish cooking the duck ; remove the string, and dish it up. Take out the onion and parsley from the pease, add to them a few tablespoonfuls of broth, and thicken it with a piece of kneaded-butter ; season with a little pepper, nutmeg, and a point of sugar ; dish the pease round the duck. 831. Quenelles of pheasant, with truffles (D. 157). — Trim a pound of pheasant-meat ; pound, and pass it through a sieve. Put into a mortar ten ounces of panada, prepared with broth and rice-flour, work it well ; when cold, add it to the pheasant-meat ; pound this force-meat for seven or eight minutes ; add367 GAME. — PHEASANT. to it ten ounces of fine butter ; when all is well mixed up, introduce into it. three yolks of eggs, and season with salt and spices ; three minutes after, pass it through a sieve, put it into a kitchen-basin, work it for a few minutes with the spoon, to I smooth it; then try a small part of it. Now mould, with this force-meat, sixteen or eighteen ‘quenelles’ by the aid of two tablespoons (see No. 527) ; as soon as they are moulded, lay them on the buttered bottom of aflat stewpan, which cover. Spread the I Fig. 157. remainder of the force-meat on an entrée-dish, shaping it in a border-like form with its top kept concave ; cover it with a buttered paper, and poach it at the entrance of the oven, or in the hot-closet. When ready to serve, poach the ‘quenelles’ in the strained broth, freed of fat. Take them up with a skimmer, drain them in a cloth, wipe, and dish them up, in a circular oi’der, on the border of force-meat ; mask them with good brown-sauce, reduced with extract of pheasant, and the trimmings of the truffles ; fill the cavity with small round truffles, and pour the sauce into a sauceboat. 832. Pheasant larded and roasted (D. 158). — Get a nice cock- pheasant, hung the proper tÿne ; pluck it, putting the neck by, with the skin and feathers on : put also by the feathers of the tail. When drawn and singed, fill the inside with eight ounces of bacon, pounded with its own, and a few chickens’ livers, cooked and passed through a sieve ; truss it to a pretty form, and lard the breast368 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. and legs with bacon. Set it on the spit, resting the legs on a layer of paper, to prevent their breaking off while cooking ; roast it at a good fire for forty or fifty minutes, with large slices of bread underneath on the dripping-pan, basting often with a paste-brush dipped in butter. In the meanwhile pierce the neck of the phea- sant with a strong iron-wire, which insert on a croûton of fried bread, fixed on the end of a dish, in such a manner as to keep the head upright. When the pheasant is done, salt it, take it off the fire, skim off the fat, and stand it on the slices of bread, taken out of the dripping-pan, and set on the centre of the dish ; surround with lemons in quarters, and a group of water-cresses on each side ; stick the feathers of the tail between the slices of bread and the dish ; send up separately7 some rich gravy in a sauceboat. 833. Pheasant sauté, with truffles. — Singe and draw a pheasant, cut off the legs and wings, and make two pieces of the breast. Lay the legs in a stewpan with butter, and half-fry them; add to them the wings and breast, a small onion, and a bunch of parsley with aromatics; season the pieces, fry them on both sides, and finish cooking them slowly, with hot ashes on the lid, or by keeping the stewpan at the entrance of the oven. Meanwhile, peel five or six raw truffles, cut them in slices, and keep them covered. Cut the back of the pheasant in pieces, put it into a stewpan with the neck, leg-bones, and pinions, as well as a small piece of raw ham, a few trimmings of chicken or veal, and a few sliced vegetables ; fry the meats on a good fire, sprinkle over a pinch of flour, and moisten with broth and a little wine. Stir the sauce until boiling, and remove it back, cooking it for three quarters of an hour; then skim the fat carefully, pass the sauce, through a sieve, into a flat stewpan ; add to it the peel of the truffles, and reduce it over a brisk fire ; gradually introducing into it a glass of’ sherry ; when the sauce is ready, strain, and keep it hot. When the pheasant is about done, remove the bunch and onion ; add to it the sliced truffles, and four table- spoonfuls of sherry ; finish cooking it covered. At serving time, cut each wing and leg in two, and dish them up ; drain the fat from the stewpan, and pour the sauce over the truffles; let it boil up, and then im- mediately pour it over the pheasant. 834. Soufflé of pheasant (D. 159). — Take the meat from off the breast of a cooked pheasant, cut it up in pieces, which pound ; add half their volume of rice boiled dry, and the liver of the pheasant tried ; pound anew the preparation ; when the mixture is done, introduce into it three tablespoonfuls of brown-sauce, well reduced with a little gravy, prepared with the pheasant-trimmings, and a lew trimmings of truffles. Season nicely, and pass the whole, through a fine sieve. Twenty-five minutes previous to serving, warm the preparation, introduce into it,369 GAME. — PHEASANT. off the fire, six or seven raw yolks of eggs, and three ounces of butter in small bits; work it quickly for three minutes, and then introduce into it four or five whipped whites of eggs. Butter a ‘soufflé’-pan, half - fill it with a part of the preparation ; then apply, against the interior sides of the case, a strip cut out of paper two inches wide, half Fig. 159. of it only coming above the rim of the pan ; fill the pan, supporting the paper against the sides, set it on a baking-tin (spread with a layer of ashes), and push it into a slow oven : twenty-five minutes will do to bake the ‘souffle’. When done, take it out of the oven, wipe, and place it on a hot dish : these ‘soufflés’ not bearing the action of air, they should be eaten, as soon as ready. 835. Roast pheasant, carved (D. 160). — Draw and truss a good Fig. 160. pheasant, singe, pluck it carefully, cover with bacon, and set it on the spit, to roast at a good fire for forty or fifty minutes, according to its size, and especially according to the length of time it has been (faisandé) kept hanging. When done, salt, and take it off the fire ; remove the string, cut it up in five pieces ; divide the back in two trans- versally, place these two pieces on the centre of a dish, set the legs on either side, then the two fillets, and the breast on the top. Surround the pheasant with water-COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 370 cresses, glaze the pieces with a paste-brush, and send up separately a sauceboat of good gravy. If the pheasant is served without water-cresses, the gravy may be poured on the bottom of the dish. This roast is dished to be handed round to the guests, but if every body is to find a piece to his taste and not too large, the fillets may, without inconvenience, be divided each in two, and put back into form; the same with the legs. As for the breast-piece, it may indifferently be divided transversally or lengthwise. 836. Sauté of pheasants, Hungary way. — Divide in pieces two young pheasants, place them in a buttered ‘sauté’-pan, add a bunch of parsley gar- nished with aromatics, season them, let them fry on a moderate fire, turning them. As soon as the breasts (hauts de poitrine) and the fillets are cooked, drain and pare them ; finish cooking the legs ; when done, drain the butter out of the ‘sauté’-pan, into which now put back the fillets and breasts. Then pour over a little melted glaze, in which roll them; dish them in a group, on a dish; mask them with good brown- sauce, reduced with pheasant-Yuinet’ ; send up separately a purée of sour apples, seasoned with a little salt, and a pinch of sugar. 837. Pheasant ‘à la diplomate’. — Get a good young pheasant, kept long enough ; pluck and singe it, split the skin of the neck all down its length, remove the haunch, slightly split the back-bone, so as to widen the opening of the stomach, and draw it through this, without making another opening. Bone a fine large, hung, quite tender, woodcock ; remove all its skin, cut the meat off the breast in squares, which put into a kitchen-basin with three or four raw truffles, cut up likewise; salt slightly, sprinkle over a pinch of good spices, then baste with two spoonfuls of madeira, and let them macerate for two hours. Put into a stewpan the trails (jintestins) of the woodcock, with its liver, and that of two fowls, a little shalot, half of the truffles’ trimmings, and lastly, a piece of butter; fry them, season, let them cool, pound, and pass them through a sieve; then add to this preparation two tablespoonfuls of melted glaze, and a point of cayenne ; mask with it six bread -‘croûtons’, cut in an oval form, and fried in butter. Chop five ounces of bacon, pound, and mix it with the squares of truffles, and of woodcock ; stuff with it the pheasant, the skin of which sew underneath, truss it, salt slightly, wrap it up in a square of pig s caul, which secure with string, and run it through with an iron skewer, to fix it on the spit. Fifty minutes before serving, start the pheasant to roast at a good fire ; spread, on the dripping-pan underneath the pheasant, the six ‘croûtons’ masked with the preparation of the inwards, and continue basting the bird with a paste-brush dipped in butter. As soon as done, take it up on a dish with the ‘croûtons’. Send upGAME. — PHEASANT. 371 separately a sauceboat of good gravy, reduced together with the trimmings of the truffles. 838. Young pheasants, Piémont fashion. — Singe and cut up two small pheasants, each of them in five or six parts. With the necks, gizzards, leg-bones, and hacks, prepare a little extract; when ready, strain it, skim off the fat; 'reduce, and thicken it with a little sauce. Put the legs of the pheasants into a flat stewpan with butter to fry them ; when half-done, add to them the wings and breasts, two small sliced onions, six ounces of ham cut in dice, and a bunch of parsley with aromatics : finish cooking the pheasants gently, turning now and then, with fire on the lid of the pan, or at the entrance of the oven. When done, remove the pieces on to a plate, trim them, and remove the drum-stick from the legs ; then drain the butter off the stewpan, and pour into it the extract of pheasant ; a few minutes after, take out the onions and aromatics, remove the stewpan off the fire, and put the pieces of pheasant into the sauce, to heat them without ebullition. On the other hand, prepare a small ‘risot’ with ten ounces of rice (see No. 783); when finished with parmesan and butter, heap it up into a border-mould, keep it a few minutes in a warm-closet, and turn the border out of the mould on a dish ; fill the cavity with white ‘Piémont’ truffles, sliced raw, then dish over these the legs of pheasant, the wings and breasts, on the top ; pour a little sauce over the entrée, and send up the remainder in a sauceboat. 839. Pheasant, Silesia fashion. — The pheasants of Silesia are re- nowned all over Germany, though far from rivaling in excellence those of Bohemia. Here follows the receipt of a national dish of this rich province, very much relished and admired by epicures. Wash two pounds of good sour-crout, and place it in a stewpan with ten ounces of goose-fat, and twelve ounces of salt pork, previously washed and blanched in water; moisten the sour-crout with half a pint of broth, let the liquid boil, close the stewpan hermetically, and draw it on to a moderate fire, with live embers on the lid, ! or bake it in a slack oven. Get a good pheasant of the season, fat and kept-hung till tender, but without excess ; pluck, draw, truss, and put it into a stewpan with a little goose-fat, to fry it on a brisk fire, and color it. On the other hand, blanch six dozens of Ostend or Holstein oysters, with a glass of white wine ; at the first bubbling drain them, preserving their liquor, refresh them, beard, and keep them covered in a small stewpan. With the liquor of the oysters, and a little good broth, prepare some white-sauce, slightly thickened.372 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. After the sour-crout lias been two hours and a half in the oven, mix with it a glass of champagne; and half an hour later, add the colored pheasant, being careful to surround it with the sour-crout; after one hour’s cooking, the pheasant and sour- crout must be quite done; then drain the pheasant, reduce on a good fire the moisture of the sour-crout, take it off the fire, and thicken it with the requisite quantity of the previously prepared sauce ; add the oysters, and range all on the centre of a dish, leaving a hollow in the middle, which fill with the salt pork, cut in slices, on which place the pheasant, previously cut into six or eight pieces ; glaze it with a paste-brush dipped in melted glaze, and serve. 840. Russian tourte. — Prepare a little cooked mince (hachis), made with equal parts of veal, calf’s liver, and bacon. Boil ten ounces of rice in plenty of water, drain it, add a piece of butter, and leave it stewing for ten minutes. Spread on a round baking-sheet (tourtière) a flat of fine short-paste; cut it round, and mask it with a layer of the prepared mince ; there- on place a layer of rice, then on this spread a layer of fillets of pheasant, or of partridge, previously cooked and minced; mask this meat with another layer of mince, and cover the whole with a flat of puff-paste, adorned with imitated leaves. Cut the 'tourte’ all round, channeling its edges, as for a pie; egg its top, score it slightly with the point of a knife, and bake it in a hot oven for forty-five minutes. When done, slip it on a dish, and send up separately a boatful of brown-sauce, reduced with 'fumet’ of game. 841. Partridges, Italian fashion. — Truss three young partridges, fry them with lard, placed in the stewpan so as to form a triangle, that is, leaving a hollow in their centre ; which hollow fill with a few small onions, a few blanched carrots, eight ounces of raw ham in large dice, two cloves of garlic, and a bunch of aromatics ; moisten to height with a glass of dry marsala, and some broth ; set the stewpan over a brisk fire to boil the liquid, and five minutes after, remove it back with hot ashes on the lid, to finish braising the partridges. When ready to serve, drain the stock through a sieve, skim off the fat, thicken it with a little good tomata- sauce, let boil, and pour it again over the partridges; which let simmer for a few minutes ; then drain, and dish them up. 842. ‘Petits aspics’ of pheasant (D. 161). — Adorn the sides of four- teen large 'dariole’-moulds with small rounds of truffles, dipping them in half-set aspic-jelly; ornament the bottom with a round of red ox-tongue. Arrange the moulds in a flat stewpan with pounded ice, and coat (chemiser) them with a thin layer of jelly. Get ready a preparation of 'pain’ of pheasant, proceeding as prescribed in No. 854. When done, add to it a 'salpicon’ of cooked truffles, with which fill the cavity of the moulds.GAME. — PHEASANT. 373 On the other hand, fix on the bottom of a dish a small support in fat, with two steps; the under one being the height of the moulds, and four inches in diameter; the upper one, a little wider than the moulds, but not higher. A quarter of an hour previous to serving, dip the moulds quickly in hot water to take out the ‘pains’ ; place seven or eight of them on the bottom of the dish, round the support ; five or six, on the second step ; and the last in the centre, on the top of all. 843. Cold pheasant-pie, Strasburg fashion (D. 162 and 163). — With two pounds and a half of flour, half a pound of butter, some water, and a pinch of salt ; prepare a short-paste ; roll it into a ball, and let it rest for two hours. Fig. 162. Fig. 163. Prepare a pound and a half of mince (liâcliis), with lean pork and game (phea- sant, black-cock, or hare ;) half and half ; mix with it an equal quantity ot salted bacon, add a few fried chickens’ livers, and pound the whole in a mortar. Season nicely, and pass it through a sieve ; then introduce into the farce a few tablespoonfuls of very fine chopped truffles. Cut up a pheasant in joints, which bone, divide the meat in pieces, put them into a kitchen-basin, with an equal volume of fat-liver , a pound of blanched bacon374 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. in dice, and a few raw peeled truffles in quarters ; season the preparation with salt and spices, baste it with a few tablespoonfuls of madeira, and let it macerate for two hours. With the aid of a small flannel-bag- containing some flour, sprinkle the sides of a Strasburg cold-pie mould, plain with hinges (see D. 162); set it on a baking- sheet covered with paper. Roll out the two-thirds of the paste into a round flat, one inch thick ; with this flat, form a round case by pressing the sides between the fingers, and raising them to three inches’ height ; put this case into the mould, close it, and make the paste rise against the sides, by pressing it with the hands, keeping its whole surface of equal thickness ; this being a main point. When the paste comes above the rim of the mould, or half an inch higher ; spread the sides, and the bottom of the case, with a layer of the prepared force-meat; then fill the cavity, alternating the pieces of pheasant and of force-meat, raise the preparation in a dome-like way; mask it first with a thin layer of force-meat, then with a flat of paste, which solder care- fully with that of the rim of the pie, equalise it, and pinch it all round the top. Orna- ment the dome with rounds of paste, leaving a hole on the centre ; then take the mould out, by opening the hinges, and pinch it regularly all round, in the way shown by the drawing ; egg the top of the pie, surround its sides with sheets of strong paper, (if not handy, of half paste-board) slightly buttered ; tie them tightly, to prevent the pie from coming out of shape while cooking; cover it now with common paper, and push it into a moderate oven, to bake for three hours. Half an hour after, being taken out of the oven, pour in at the top two gills of good aspic-jelly, mixed up with two tablcspoonfuls of glaze, and of madeira. Let the pie cool completely before serving. .844. ‘Pain’ of pheasant, ‘à la montglas’. — Prepare a ‘quenelle’ force-meat of pheasant in the conditions prescribed in No. 831 ; work it for a few minutes in a kitchen-basin with a spoon, introducing into it gradually a few table- spoonfuls of melted glaze ; with this force-meat fill a plain or fluted border-mould, previously well buttered; shake (tasser) the mould over a cloth, to equalise the force-meat, set it in a stewpan with hot water, reaching to half its height, to poach the force-meat at the ‘bain-marie’, allowing the water to boil : forty minutes will do. On the other hand, peel three or four black truffles, boil them with a little sherry or madeii’a. Cut them as for a‘montglas’ (see No. 712); and add the same volume of cooked mushrooms, and of pickled tongue, cut like the truffles. Place this ‘montglas’ in a stewpan, and keep it hot. With the back-bones of the pheasant, a little white wine and gravy, prepare a simple bi’own-sauce, not too thick ; skim- ming off the fat, pass it into a stewpan, add the trimmings, and the liquor of the375 GAME. — PARTRIDGE. truffles, reduce it, stirring it ; when succulent, pass it through a sieve, and pour half of it over the previously prepared ‘montglas’. When the ‘pain’ is poached, turn it out on a dish, spunge the butter carefully, and pour the ‘montglas’ in the centre ; mask the ‘pain’ with the remainder of the sauce, and send it up. 845. Partridge-celestines (D. 164). — Cut in small dice the breasts of two cooked and cooled partridges ; put the meat into a kitchen-basin ; add to it the same volume of cooked truffles, cut like the meat. Fig. 164. With the meat of the legs of the partridges, and with a few cooked poultry- livers, prepare a little purée. Pour this purée into a small stewpan, dilute it with the same volume of tepid good game-‘ehaufroix’- sauce ; stir the preparation on the ! ice, so as to thicken ; add to it the ‘salpicon’, and remove it from the ice : this preparation needs but little sauce. Cut a dozen oval slices of cooked fat-livers to the shape of a large sandwich ; trim the slices neatly, and mask them with a thick layer of preparation, previously made ready ; let the preparation get quite firm again on the ice. Then dip the ‘celestines’ one by one, into the ‘ehaufroix’-sauce, in order to mask them entirely, with a layer not too thick, but quite smooth ; immediately set on the centre of each ‘celestines’, a slice of cooked black truffle cut of an oval shape. Coat the ‘celestines’ with jelly; dish them in a circular order on a layer of aspic-jelly set on a dish, j garnishing the middle with truffles, and the base with jelly-‘croûtons’. 846. ‘Terrine’ Of red partridges. — Bone two red partridges, divide them in two lengthwise ; season, and fry them a few minutes with melted rasped bacon; take them out, as soon as the surface of the flesh is set. Slice the half of a small calfs liver, fry it over a brisk fire with fat bacon, a pinch of chopped onion, aromatics, and a few trimmings of raw ham ; when the liver is done, let cool, pound, and pass it through a sieve. Take half its volume of lean fresh pork, and the same of raw bacon, pound them in the mortar, add to it the purée of liver, and season the force-meat highly with good spices.376 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. With layers of fresh fat bacon, line a cold-pie-dish (terrine) of a sufficient size ; divide the halves of partridges, mix them with the force-meat, adding a few spoonfuls of cooked fine-herbs, and a little madeira or cognac ; with this preparation fill the ‘terrine’, cover its top with force-meat, then with a flat of paste, set it on a baking-sheet, and bake it for two hours in a moderate oven, basting from time to time. .When removed from the oven, take off the paste, and let the preparation cool, with a light weight over. When the ‘terrine’ is to be served, take the fat off, cut up the preparation, and fix the vessel on a dish, after having wiped it carefully. Sur- round it with aspic-jelly, and send it up. 847. Partridges ‘à la sybarite’. — Draw two partridges through the body, and bone two snipes. Peel two raw truffles; pound the peel with the livers of the snipes and partridges, previously fried, and with a piece of beef-marrow ; season the preparation, pass it through a sieve ; add to it the raw truffles, cut up in small dice. Season the snipes inwardly, place a little of the preparation on the centre of each of them, roll them up, and introduce one of them into each of the partridges, the crop of which fill with the remainder of the preparation. Truss as usual, salt, and wrap each of them up in a square of pig’s caul. Twenty-four hours after, run the partridges through with a thin iron-skewer, set them on the spit, wrap them up in buttered paper, and roast them at a good fire twenty minutes; take them out, remove flic string, and send them up with a little rich gravy reduced to half-glaze. 848. Timbale of partridges, Alsace fashion. — First of all prepare some raw mince (hachis), with eight ounces of fresh pork, the same of bacon and raw ham ; season highly, pound it in a mortar, add a few tablespoonfuls of fine-herbs, a little panada, and a whole egg ; after which pass it through a sieve. Meanwhile, boil a large cabbage for fifteen minutes; refresh it, .slip off the largest leaves, pare away the hard stalks, and spread them on a cloth. Singe and truss two or three partridges ; put them into a stewpan with a little butter, twelve ounces of raw ham and streaky bacon, cut up in oblong squares ; add a bunch of parsley garnished with aromatics, and fry them quickly ; when of a nice color, sprinkle over a pinch of flour, and moisten to height, with white wine and broth ; braise them on a moderate fire. Afterwards cut the partridges, each of them in five parts, as much as possible removing their bones ; place them in a stewpan, with the bacon and ham ; pass the sauce through a sieve, into a another stewpan ; add to it four or five peeled ti’uffles, in quarters, which cook for a few minutes on the side of the slow fire, and pour sauce and truffles over the partridges. Get a large ‘timbale’-mould, mask the bottom and sides with thin layers of bacon, on which apply some cabbage-leaves (two or three of them, one above theGAME. — PAETEIDGE. 377 other), thus forming sufficient support ; mask the cabbage all over with a layer of pork-mince, which also mask with cabbage-leaves, and place in the cavity of the mould the pieces of partridge, intermingled with the truffles, bacon, ham, and sauce. Close the opening of the ‘timbale’ with a layer of mince, then with cabbage- ; leaves, and set the ‘timbale’ in a ‘sauté’-pan with water; push it into a moderate oven, ! and bake it for two hours. When ready to serve, turn the ‘timbale’ out on a dish, | remove the bacon and fat ; mask it with the remainder of the sauce. 849. ‘Chaufroix’ of partridges, with truffles (D. 165). — Take oiit the cooked breasts of five or six roasted cold partridges ; make three pieces of each, Fig. 165. two fillets and a breast-piece ; remove away the skin and pinion-bone ; pare, and dip them in a ‘chaufroix’- sauce, composed two thirds of brown-sauce and one third of aspic-jelly; range them on a baking-sheet, allowing the sauce to cool. On the other hand, prepare a wooden stand with steps, masked with fat, cut out with the knife, and fix it on a dish. Fix on the top a small cast subject in fat, or in stearine. A few minutes previous to serving, take up the fillets and pieces of breast from the baking-sheet, touching them as little as possible, set the fillets on the lower step, upright and overlapped; surround them with a string of chopped aspic, and place the breast-pieces on the upper step. Surround the base with a circle of small folded paper-cases, each filled with a small glazed truffle. 850. Croquettes of partridges. — Prepare some ‘quenelle’ force-meat with the raw flesh of two partridges ; when passed through a sieve, keep it on the ice; half an hour after, take it with a spoon in small parts, which drop over aCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 378 floured table, roll them into a cork-shape, make a hollow in the centre, with a wooden spoon dipped in warm water ; then fill the cavity with chopped raw truffles ; stop the opening with some force-meat, dip the 'croquettes’ into some beaten eggs, and bread-crumb them. A lew minutes previous to serving, plunge them into hot hog’s lard, and when of a nice color, dish them in a pyramidal form on a folded napkin. 851. Purée of partridge, with croûtons. — Take the meat of two small cooked partridges, cut, and pound it with a piece of butter, and a few table- spoonfuls of a cold sauce, prepared with their back and other bones ; season the pre- paration with salt and nutmeg, pass it through a sieve, and put it into a basin. Pound the partridges’ livers with two or three chickens’ livers, pass them likewise through a sieve, add to the purée a few tablespoonfuls of melted glaze, and mask with it (on one side only) seven or eight bread 'croutons’, shaping the purée in a dome-like way ; range these 'croûtons’ on the lid of a stewpan, moisten them with a paste-brush, dipped in a little sauce, and keep them at the entrance of the oven to glaze. Heat the purée of partridges, at serving-time, without letting it boil, stirring it, and mixing two or three tablespoonfuls of sauce ; it should, nevertheless, remain of good consistence ; dish it in a dome-shape, baste it with a little sauce or glaze, and surround with the garnished 'croûtons’. 852. ‘Escabecia’ of partridges, Spanish fashion. — Those who have travelled in Spain are certainly aware, that the inns of that country do not enjoy a great culinary renown ; but at the least, the traveller is always sure to find there the popular 'escabecia’, and some of that excellent smoked ham, so well prepared in all provinces of Spain. With these two dishes, some requisite bread white as snow, and water, which nearly equals the wine; if one does not eat in a luxurious manner, one may at the least, appease one’s hunger agreeably. Singe, and cut up two or three partridges, each of them in five parts, which put into a sauté-pan with plenty of oil and aromatics, two cloves of garlic not peeled, peppercorns and cloves; fry them nicely, then moisten with broth and a little vin- egar, cooking them gently, long enough to have them very tender ; by this time, the moisture must be very short, add then a few tablespoonfuls of aspic-jellv, or simply some calf’s-feet stock ; let it boil for three minutes, and draw the stewpan off the fire, range the partridges in a kitchen-basin, baste them with the stock, passed through a sieve, allowing partridges and stock, to cool completely, previous to serving the 'escabecia’. 853. Croustades à la Reine (D 166). — These 'croustades’ are in bread, and cut with the knife. The bread employed for this end is that called pain anglais, and employed for kitchen-use ; it goes also by the name of pain de mie.379 GAME. — PARTRIDGE. The shape of the ‘croustades’ depends on one’s taste, all forms being convenient, if they be correct and regular. Cut eight little ‘croustades’; immediately, when cut, shelter them from the contact of the air ; (earner) scoop them on the top. A few minutes previous to serving, plunge them into fresh hog’s lard, let them take a nice color, drain, and empty them ; then garnish them with a partridge-purée (No. 851), Fig. 166. let it bulk out slightly, smooth each with the blade of a knife, and range on the top a little rosette of cooked truffles, glazed with the paste-brush. Dish the ‘croustades’ on a folded napkin, placing seven at the bottom, and one at the top applied against the one placed in the middle, which must be less garnished than the others. 854. ‘Pain’ of partridge, with truffles (D. 167). — Take off the Fig. 167. bones, the meat from a cooked partridge, put it into a mortar with a few cooked poul- try-livers ; when the whole is converted into paste, add a gill of brown-sauce, reduced with the trimmings of a few raw truffles, and rub it through a tammy. Put the purée into a kitchen-basin, work it with the spoon, and introduce into it four tablespoonfuls of good aspic-jellv, then six ounces of good butter, in small380 COSMOPOLITAN OOOKEKY. bits ; when the butter is all in, pcrar the preparation into a cylindric six-faced mould. Keep it on the ice for one hour, dip it afterwards in hot water, and turn the ‘pain’ out on a small stand, previously stuck on a dish, and having a column on its centre. Glaze the ‘pain’ with a paste-brush, ornament the faces with a scroll, formed with a round of white of egg, and lozenges of cooked truffles. Place on the top of the column a small cup cast in fat, garnished with truffles, glazed with aspic-jelly. Sur- round the base with a chain of truffles in small paper-cases, and the stand with nice ‘croutons’ of jelly. 855. ‘Epigrammes’ of partridge. — Take out the larger fillets of two raw partridges, leaving the minion-fillets adhering to the breast-bone ; pare them as usual, and place them in a flat stewpan with clarified butter. Slip off the minion- fillets, which beat slightly, fixing them together, two and two, with a little force- meat, shaping them as the larger fillets; season, and place them in the stewpan along with the others. With the flesh of a raw partridge, and a few trimmings of poultry or game, pre- pare a little ‘quenelle’ force-meat, break up the backs and other bones in pieces, fry them with a few vegetables, trimmings of ham, and a pinch of aromatics ; moisten with wine and gravy, and twenty-five minutes after, pass the stock through a napkin; skim off the fat, and prepare with it a little brown-sauce. Divide the force-meat into six parts, which place on a floured table, and roll them into a pear-shape; then flatten with the blade of a knife, thus giving them the shape and size of the fillets of partridges ; arrange them evenly in a buttered stewpan, and poach them in salted water; drain, and let them cool ; bread-crumb them afterwards with eggs, put them into a flat stewpan with clarified butter, and let them take color on both sides ; when done, drain them, and insert a small bone at their pointed end. At the same time, slightly salt the fillets ; fry them on a brisk fire, turning, and keeping them underdone ; drain the butter off the stewpan, pour over the fillets three tablespoonfuls of sauce, afterwards dish them up in a circular order, with one of the ‘boudins’ of the force-meat between each of them ; fill the centre with a garnish of minced mushrooms, or of ‘cèpes’, thickened with the remainder of the sauce. 856. ‘Petites timbales’ of ‘nouilles’, with purée of partridges (D. 168). — Prepare a ‘nouille’-paste, with about a pound of flour ; eggs, salt, and water. Let it rest, divide it into five or six parts ; which roll out very thin, and allow to dry for a few minutes; then cut them up in shreds, parboil them in salted water, drain them without refreshing, and put them back again into the stewpan, seasoning, and introducing five ounces of butter, and four of grated par- mesan ; then pour them into a buttered sauté-pan, in a regular layer two inches381 GAME. — PARTRIDGE. thick. Let them cool under a light weight, and afterwards stamp out the ‘timbales’ with a thin plain cutter ; dip them in beaten eggs to be bread-crumbed, make a small [incision on the top to mark the cover, and plunge them into hot hog’s lard, frying them of a nice color; empty them at once, and re-fill them with a warm purée of Fig. 168. partridges (see No. 851) ; glaze the purée all over, and cover it. Dish up the ‘timbales’ on a folded napkin. 857. Cold partridge-pie (D. 169). — Prepare two pounds of short- paste (No. 196); butter an oblong pie-mould, set it on a baking-sheet covèred with paper, and line it with the paste. Singe four or five partridges, slip off the legs, and bone them; remove the skin from the meat, and cut it in pieces to be pounded. Take Fig. 169. out the meat off the breast, divide it in squares ; put it into a kitchen-basin, and add truffles, also in dice ; season the whole with salt and good spices, baste it with a few tablespoonfuls of madeira, and let it macerate for two hours. Chop a pound and a half of lean pork, pound it with the meat from the legs of partridge ; add a pound and a half of salted bacon, not smoked ; season the force- meat; five minutes afterwards, put it into a basin, and add to it two choppedCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 382 truffles. With a part of this force-meat, mask the bottom and sides of the mould with a layer, the third of an inch thick; then fill the pie with the fillets of partridge and the garnish, by layers alternated with force-meat ; set the preparation up, in a dome-like way, above the rim of the mould ; cover the dome with thin layers of bacon, and then with a round flat of paste, which solder to the paste of the rim, finishing the pie, as directed for that of pheasant ; egg, and bake it in a moderate oven, for two hours and a half; when taken out of the oven, fill it by the top with a little good gravy, reduced with the trimmings of truffles, a little madeira, and some aspic-jelly ; allow it to cool for twenty-four hours previous to serving, then set it on its dish. It may be surrounded also with croûtons of aspic-jelly. 858. ‘Crépinettes’ of partridge-fillets. — Take out the fillets of four young partridges, remove the bones and skin away, split them on their thick part, and stuff them with some raw mince (hachis), composed of fresh fat-bacon, raw ham, raw truffles, a little shalôt, salt, and pepper; season the fillets, and a,pply on each side of them two or three slices of raw truffles, then wrap each of them round with a square of pig’s caul, roll them in melted lard, bread-crumb, and broil them, on a moderate fire, for twelve or fom-teen minutes (when done on one side, turning them on the other) ; dish them up with a little half-glaze underneath. With the eight minion-fillets, two ‘crépinettes’ may be made. 859. Partridges, with Polish hunter’s sauce. — Choose the par tridges very young and fat, pluck, draw, singe, and cut them up in two, lengthwise; then season each half, moisten them with oil, bread-crumb, and broil them on a good clear fire, turning and basting them ; dish them up afterwards, and serve with them the following sauce : _Polish hunter's sauce. — Chop one shalot and one onion, put them into a stewpan, with a few tablespoonfuls of streaky bacon cut in dice, and a few sprigs of aromatics ; fry them for a few minutes, and add to them a few spoonfuls of chopped mushrooms, the moisture of which reduce, moisten with two gills of gravy, add the livers of the partridges, previously chopped ; let the sauce boil for ten minutes; thicken it with two ounces of butter, kneaded with fresh rasped bread-crumb. When ready to serve, add to the sauce a little glaze, stirring the sauce until the butter be quite dissolved ; then take it oft' the fire ; add the juice of two lemons, and a pinch of chopped parsley. 860. ‘Cannelons’ with purée of partridges (D. 170). — Roll out thin about a pound of puff-paste (eight turns), and divide this flat in strips, halt an inch wide. Butter ten ‘cannelon’-sticks, fold the strips of paste over these in a spiral383 GAME. — PARTRIDGE. way, giving the ‘cannelons’ a length of three inches ; place them evenly on a baking- sheet ; egg, and bake them in a good oven ; when of a nice color, take them out, and a few minutes after, remove the sticks; then garnish the ‘cannelons’ inwardly, by the aid of a bag, with a purée of partridges, warmed up with a little melted glaze, Fig. 170. mixed with a ‘salpicon’ of truffles. Stop the opening of each with a round piece of truffle, and dish the ‘cannelons’ up, in pyramids, on a folded napkin. 861. Galantine of partridges, with jelly (D. 171, and 172). — Bone three partridges. With the flesh from the legs, some game-flesh, and as much of fresh bacon, prepare a farce (hachis) for ‘galantine’ ; season highly, and add to it four or Fig. 171. Fig. 172. live peeled truffles in dice. Season the partridges, stuff them with the farce, without making them too large ; sew them up in a round form, and wrap each of them up in a small cloth, secure them with string, and boil them for an hour and a quarter, in a good stock, as for a ‘galantine’ of poultry. When the ‘galantines’ are done, and drained, take them off the cloth, and pack them up again, letting them cool in a round shape ; then remove them out of the napkins, trim and cut them in small slices, without separating them ; glaze them with a paste-brush.384 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. Arrange in an earthen pan three ‘galantine’-moulds, surround them with pounded ice, and pour at the bottom a layer of clear aspic-jelly. When it is firm, set on it a ‘galantine’, and finish filling the moulds also gradually with aspic-jelly, keeping the ‘galantines’, however, on the centre. One hour after, dip the moulds by turn into hot water ; wipe, and turn the ‘galantines’ out, round a small subject in fat, fix it on the centre of a ‘pain-vert’ ; which surround with small paper cases, each filled with a small cooked truffle, glazed with the paste-brush. This entrée of a pretty effect, is to go on the table. 862. Partridges, Catalan fashion. — Truss three partridges as for boiling, put them into a stewpan with chopped bacon and a hunch of aromatics, season, and fry them on a moderate fire, turning ; when of a nice color, moisten with a little wine, and braise gently, with hot ashes on the lid. As soon as they are about done, add to them eight ounces of raw ham cut in dice, and four or five dozen large cloves of garlic, previously boiled in plenty of water ; sprinkle over a pinch of red Spanish pepper, and continue boiling. A quarter of an hour after, drain the partridges, remove the strings, dish them up, and surround with the garnish; remove the aromatics, skim out the fat off the cooking-stock, which thicken with a little brown-sauce, and pour over the partridges. 863. Fillets of partridges, with purée. — Take out the larger and smaller fillets of two partridges, pare them as usual, and place at the bottom of a buttered‘sauté’-pan; fry the legs in another stewpan, season, let cool, and bone; trimming away the hard parts of the meat; which pound with three tablespoonfuls of well cooked and dry rice ; add to it a piece of butter, season, and pass the prepara- tion through a sieve ; then put the purée into a stewpan, reduce it on a moderate fire, introducing into it a little sauce or some melted glaze, but without letting it boil. When ready to serve, fry the fillets over a brisk fire ; as soon as set, drain the butter out carefully, pour over two or three tablespoonfuls of a brown-sauce, pre- pared with the hacks of partridges ; roll the fillets in it, and dish them up in a cir- cular order, with the purée in the centre ; haste purée and fillets with the remainder of the sauce. 864. Red partridges (perdreaux*) roasted with truffles. — Pluck two tender red partridges ; singe and draw them. Peel five or six fresh black truffles ; cut them in quarters, and season. Chop the peel, pound it with a little fresh * As long as the feather placed at the tip of the pinion (maître-penne) remains pointed, and adorned with a white spot, the partridge (perdreau) is young and tender ; as soon as it becomes round at the end, the partridge (perdrix) is old and tough.GAME. — PARTRIDGE. 385 fat-bacon, adcl to it the livers of the partridges, cooked with two or three of chickens ; season the preparation, and pass it through a sieve. Melt six ounces of rasped fat-bacon, add to it the cut truffles, which heat for two minutes, tossing them ; mix them afterwards with the force-meat, and proceed to stuff with it the partridges ; truss them, sewing up all the openings, and set them on the spit, to roast at a moderate fire for fourteen or fifteen minutes, according to their I size; basting them with butter. When done, salt, take them off the fire, and dish them up, with cut lemons round. Mix a little gravy in the stock of the dripping-pan, let it boil up, skim off the fat, reduce it to half-glaze, pass through it a sieve, and ' serve it separately. Carving. — The partridge is, of all game, the easiest to carve. First of all slip off the legs, and divide the breast into three parts; two fillets and breast-piece. The breast is the most delicate part of the bird. When the partridges are quite young, they are simply cut up in two ; when of a middling-size, in three pieces ; that is, the fillet of each side is cut off with a leg and wing, and a part of the back adhering. 805. Partridges, ‘à la chasseur’. — Take three young partridges, draw, divide each of them in two, lengthwise, cut off the tip of the legs, split the skin of the drum-stick, so as to thrust the leg underneath, and slightly beat each half; | season, roll them in oil, bread-crumb, and broil them for fourteen or fifteen minutes, turning them; set them on a dish, on the bottom of which pour a little madeira-sauce. 80G. ‘Pain’ of partridge, ‘à la Perigueux’. — Peel four or five fresh truffles, and cut them up in small dice. Slip off the legs of two small partridges, which fry, at the same time with the liver of the partridges, in butter ; and let them cool. Slip off then the raw fillets from the breast ; trim, and pound them with the peel of the truffles, the cooked livers and legs, previously trimmed of the hard parts ; add to them panada, the size of a walnut, and eight ounces of butter ; when well mixed up, season the force-meat, and introduce into it four or five yolks of eggs, one by one ; pass it then through a sieve, put it into a kitchen-basin, work it with a spoon, and add four or five tablcspoonfuls of melted glaze, or of cold reduced ‘espagnole’-sauce ; try then a small part of it in boiling water, to ascertain its consistency. Butter a plain cylindric form, fill it with the force-meat, shaking it on a cloth ; I cover the top with a round of buttered paper, and set the mould in a stewpan, to : poach the preparation in the ‘bain-marie’ for half an hour. Pour half a glass of ma- deira on the truffles in dice, cover the stewpan, and reduce the moisture quickly to J half ; moisten then with two gills of brown-sauce, or some thickened gravy, prepared with the backs of partridges; let it boil for two seconds, and draw the pan off the 2bCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 386 fire. When ready to serve, turn the ‘pain’ out on a dish, wipe the butter, and mask the entree with the truffles-sauce. 867. Partridge-cutlets, Russ fashion. — Pare one or two whole 'ga- lantines’ of partridges, giving them the shape of a cutlet ; divide these 'galantines’ transversally in thin slices ; mask them with a layer of fat-liver preparation (sec No. 854) ; let this layer be the fifth part of an inch thick. As soon as the preparation has cooled, mask the cutlets with brown-'chaufroix’-sauce ; place them one beside the other on a baking-sheet, and glaze them with jelly. As soon as this jelly has set, trim them of the superfluous sauce, put ruffles on, dish them in a circular order. Fill the centre with a garnish of small glazed truffles. Place round the cutlets a chain of small jelly-'croûtons’. 868. Grey partridges roasted, Polish fashion. — Singe, draw, and truss, two grey partridges, lard their breast and legs, salt them slightly, put them into a stewpan with butter, and let them take color, with live embers on the lid. When they are half-done, moisten with about a gill of sour-cream, and finish cook- ing them, basting often; drain them afterwards, remove the strings, and dish them up. Pour a little good gravy into the stewpan, thicken the stock with a little kneaded-butter, reduce for a few seconds, and pass the sauce, through a sieve, over the partridges. If no sour-cream be handy, good double-cream may be used ; and the sauce, after being reduced, should be finished with a little vinegar or lemon-juice. This way of cooking partridges is very good, and deserves to be adopted every where. 869. Rissoles of partridges, Russ fashion. — Take out the fillets of two raw partridges, pare, and chop them fine ; chop also five ounces of raw beef- marrow, and the same of blanched bacon ; mix all well together, season the mince with salt and nutmeg, add to it two raw chopped truffles, and thicken it with the yolk of one egg. With this mixture, prepare some 'rissoles’, fry, drain, and dish them up on a folded napkin. 870. Partridges, as in the Sierra Morena. — This dish is of Spanish origin, and bears the stamp of it. Truss two partridges with the legs inside, singe, and put them into a stewpan with oil, four onions, a carrot, a piece of celery, eight ounces of ham in large dice, a few cloves of garlic, thyme, bay-leaf, peppercorns, and cloves ; set the stewpan on a brisk fire, fry the ingredients for eight or ten minutes, moisten with two gills of broth, which reduce quickly to glaze ; then moisten the par- tridges, to three-parts their height, with a gill of vinegar and some broth ; cover the partridges with a round of oiled paper, and the stewpan with its lid ; set the pan onGAME. — PARTRIDGE. 387 hot ashes, with fire on its lid, or place it at the entrance of the oven, till the com- plete cooking of the partridges. Meanwhile fry in oil three handfuls of rasped bread-crumbs ; as soon as of nice color, and dried, draw the pan off the lire, and drain the oil out ; when the partridges are done, pass their stock through a sieve, skim off the fat, and dilute, on the fire, and by degrees, the fried bread-crumb, thus obtaining a light sauce ; at the first bubbling, remove the pan on the side, and boil the sauce for twenty-five minutes: it should be then sufficiently thickened, and of a nice taste; pour it over the par- tridges, previously freed of string, and placed on a hot dish. 871. Partridges, Piémont way. — Truss two partridges as for entrée, singe them, cover the breast with slices of lemon, freed of peel, and support them with thin layers of fat bacon. Spread the bottom of a flat stewpan with trimmings of ham and bacon, sliced vegetables, and a bunch of aromatics ; place on this the partridges, moisten with a glass of white wine, let the liquid boil up, and braise the partridges at the entrance of the oven, occasionally turning them; when done, remove the strings, cut each of them in five parts, which place in a small stewpan, and keep in the ‘bain-marie’. Drain the fat of the stewpan, add the backs of the partridges to the cooking-stock, and pour in about a pint of good gravy, and half a glass of sherry ; let the liquid boil, pass it through a sieve, take away the fat, reduce -it to half, and thicken it slightly with a little tomata-sauce. Pour the sauce over the pieces of partridge, I keeping-them hot, without allowing them to boil. Meanwhile prepare a little ‘polenta’ (see Vegetables) ; finish it with butter and parmesan, then pour it into a border-mould, previously buttered; leave it to set for eight or ten minutes ; then turn the border out on a dish, place the pieces of par- tridge in its centre, the legs at the bottom, the fillets and breasts uppermost ; baste them with the sauce, and serve. 872. ‘Mancelle’ of partridge. — With the meat of two cooked par- tridges, prepare a purée, as described in No. 851. With the flesh of a raw par- tridge, half its volume of panada, the same of butter, and two yolks of eggs, prepare some ‘quenelle’ force-meat ; when finished, place it in a biscuit-bag (poche à douille), and with it squeeze symmetrically, round the bottom of a dish (la cuvette), some small round balls, in shape of half ‘meringue’ shells, on each of which put a round truffle, cooked for two minutes in wine and melted glaze ; cover the dish with buttered paper, push it into a hot oven, and poach the force-meat for ten minutes. When ready to serve, warm the purée, stirring, and without letting it boil ; take the dish out of the oven, and fill the hollow, formed by the ring (mancelle) of balls, with the purée; glaze the truffles, and baste the purée with a little melted glaze.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 388 873. Quenelles of partridge, with ‘fumet’. — Take the fillets of two fresh partridges, trim, cut them up in pieces, and pound them; add a third their volume of good panada, and the same of butter ; when the mixture is operated, and the force-meat smooth ; introduce into it two or three yolks of eggs, season with salt and nutmeg, pass it through a sieve, and put it into a kitchen-basin, to work it a few minutes with a spoon, mixing therewith, by degrees, a few spoonfids of melted glaze. Poach then a small part of it, to try its consistency. With the force-meat, proceed to mould, according to the way described in No. 740, fifteen or eighteen‘quenelles’, with tablespoons of an ordinary size; immediately, when moulded, slip them on the buttered bottom of a flat stewpan, one beside the other. During these proceedings, put the legs and backs of partridge in a stewpan with trimmings of bacon and ham, minced vegetables, parsley-leaves, aromatics, and a few peppercorns ; let the whole take color on a good fire, moisten with white wine and broth, by halves ; skim' the stock well, and draw the stewpan on the side of the fire, keeping it with the lid on. Thirty-five minutes after, pass the cooking-stock, through a sieve, into a kitchen-basin, carefully skim off the fat; let it cool, and clarify it, with five ounces of lean veal, half a glass of madeira, and one egg, proceeding as prescribed for a ‘consommé’. When clear, put it into a small stewpan, let it boil, and thicken it very slightly with a little diluted arrow-root ; boil it for a few minutes longer, and keep it hot. When about to serve, plunge the quenelles into salted boiling water, drain them on a cloth, dish them up in a pyramid, and mask them with the ‘fumet’. 874. Young partridges (perdreaux), Lithuania way. — Put into a basin six ounces of good butter, with the aid of a wooden spoon, continually working it ; add to it grated fresh bread-crumb, in a sufficient quantity to get a stiff paste ; add salt, pepper, and chopped parsley. Roast on the spit, or in the stewpan, two good tender partridges, remove them while under-done (verts-cuits), that is, not having yet attained perfect cooking; untruss them, salt, and let them half-cool : divide them lengthwise, cutting each of them into three pieces. Divide the paste into four parts, give them a long shape, and place one of them on each side of the breast ; immediately bring the partridge back into form ; begin operating the same for the second partridge : put them both, placing one beside the other, into a narrow stewpan, in order to keep them well in shape. Cover the stewpan, keep it at the entrance of the oven for a quarter of an hour, basting the partridges from time to time ; then dish them ; add a little meat- glaze, and the juice of three lemons, to the butter in the stewpan, and pour this over the partridges.GAME. — PARTRIDGE. 389 875. Partridge-‘pain’, with olives (D. 173).— Prepare a good ‘quenelle’ force-meat with the meat of two partridges ; when passed through a sieve, put it into a kitchen-basin, add to it a few spoonfuls of good brown-sauce, reduced with a little meat-glaze and wine. Butter a plain cylinder-mould, sprinkle the bottom, and sides, with a handful of hlack truffles, cut in small dice. Keep it on the ice for ten minutes, till the hollow with the force-meat ; set the mould then in a stewpan, which till with warm water, reaching Fig. 173. to half the height of the mould. Poach the ‘pain’ in the ‘bain-marie’. At serving- time, take the mould out, drain the fat well, turn the ‘pain’ out on a dish, garnish the hollow of the centre with a garnish of stoned and blanched olives. Pour on the ‘pain’ a little good brown-sauce, reduced with some partridge-‘fumet’, and a little madeira-wine. 876. Partridges, with sour-crout. — Wash two pounds of sour-crout, drain it well, put it into a stewpan, with good goose-fat, or the toppings of a braise- stock, a bunch of parsley and aromatics, one onion, one carrot, and half a pound of streaky bacon, previously steeped in tepid water; moisten it with about a pint of broth, place on the top a piece of bacon-rind, or that of ham ; let the liquid boil for ten minutes, then cover the stewpan hermetically, and draw it on a slow fire, with hot ashes on the lid, or set it at the entrance of the oven, cooking the sour-crout for four hours. Meanwhile, singe and truss two large partridges ; lard, fry them in a stewpan with butter, and when half-done, take them off the fire. When the sour-crout is about cooked, baste it with a glass of good dry white wine ; cover the stewpan again, and reduce the stock over a good fire; then take out the rind, the bacon, and the vegetables, thicken the sour-crout with a few tablespoonfuls of sauce, and add the partridges. Place the lid on the stewpan, set it on a very slow fire ; and a quarter of an hour after, dish up the sour-crout, putting the partridges on the top, andCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 390 surrounding them with the bacon, pared and cut up ; glaze them with a paste-brush, and serve. 877. Partridges, with red cabbages. — For this purpose it is not requisite that the partridges be quite young. Shred two small red cabbages, put them into an earthen or an enamelled iron stewpan, with one onion and melted lard or bacon fat ; fry them on a moderate fire, until their moisture is reduced ; then add a piece of streaky bacon (about half a pound), and a glass of white wine; let the liquid boil up, and ten minutes after, remove the stewpan on the side of the fire, with hot ashes on the lid, cooking the cabbages slowly. Truss two partridges, fry them in a stewpan to let them take color, and add them to the cabbages, „whcn these are three-parts done, to finish cooking them together : the cabbages should be a little firm, and of a nice color. As soon as the partridges are done, drain them, take out the bacon, which trim, and cut in slices ; then thicken the cabbages with a piece of kneaded-butter, and finish them with a little vinegar. Place them afterwards on a dish with the partridges over, and the slices of bacon round them. In Germany, a pinch of caraway-seed is often added to the cabbages, when these arc half-done ; but this flavoring is not a relish to every body. 878. Partridges, with cabbage. — Truss two partridges, as for an entree, and cover with bacon. Cut up two middling-sized savoy-cabbages, each of them in four parts ; which plunge into boiling salted water, and after twenty minutes’ ebullition, drain them in a colander; divide them in small quarters, removing the hard stalks, and squeezing them between the hands, to press out all the moisture, and to round them. Spread a stewpan with trimmings of fat bacon and sliced vegetables, place the partridges on the centre, and range the quarters of cabbage all round ; add thereto a piece of blanched streaky bacon (ten or twelve ounces), a bunch of aromatics, cloves and peppercorns ; then moisten the cabbages and partridges to height with broth and toppings, cover with large pieces of pork-rind, previously blanched; let the liquid boil ; remove the stewpan on a very slow fire, with hot ashes on the lid. Braise the cabbages for three or four hours, but carefully taking out the partridges, as soon as done. When ready to serve, drain the cabbages in a colander, to drain the fat, and dish them ; cut up the bacon in squares, which put into the centre of the cabbages, on which range the partridges, each of them carved in five pieces ; mask them with a little, rather thickish sauce.GAME. — PARTRIDGE. 391 879. Salmis of partridges, with truffles (D. 174). — Truss two or three partridges, put them into a stewpan with butter, and a few trimmings of fat bacon; add the necks and gizzards, and fry them on a brisk fire for five or six minutes; withdraw them on a moderate fire, cooking them with live embers on the lid ; let them half-cool, and cut each of them up in five pieces ; trim the skin away, and place them in a stewpan. Fry in butter the livers of the partridges with two chickens’ livers, pound, and pass them through a sieve. With the backs and trimmings of the Fig. 174. partridges, prepare a little gravy, skim off the fat, reduce it to half-glaze, and add to it three gills of brown-sauce ; let the sauce boil up, and remove it back to clarify; skim again, and pass it through a fine sieve. With this sauce dilute gradually the purée of liver, pour it over the pieces of partridge; which warm, without allowing to boil, and dish up. On the other hand, cut some bread-‘croûtons’ of round shape and half-an-inch thick, make a circular incision on one side, fry them in butter, empty them of the crumb, and fill the void with the ‘salpicon’ of truffles, cooked, with a little madeira and a little melted glaze. Mask the partridges with the sauce, and dish the ‘croûtons’ all round. 880. Partridges ‘sautés’, à la diplomate. — Detach the legs of two partridges, take off the meat, pare, and mix it with an equal quantity of chicken, game, or veal meat ; pound the whole in a mortar, preparing with it a ‘quenelle’ force- meat (see No. 740); then fill with it a border-mould. Cut up the breasts of the partridges, each of them in three or four parts, which put into a flat stewpan with butter, a small onion, aromatics, and pepper. Break in pieces the back and other bones of the partridges, place them in a stewpan with sliced bacon, trimmings of ham, a bunch of aromatics, and a few peppercorns ; color them at a good fire, moisten them with white wine and gravy, boil them for twenty minutes, and then pass the stock through a sieve.392 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. Peel five or six good fresh truffles, cut them in small dice, and keep them bv. Put the trimmings into a stewpan, with about a gill of good ‘béchamel’-sauce ; which reduce gradually, introducing into it the stock of the bones, then strain the sauce through a tammy, and keep it hot. Fry the breasts and the fillets of the partridges over a good fire, turning them; when about done, add to them the truffles cut in dice, and four tablespoonfuls of madeira; finish cooking them gently, with the truffles, on a moderate fire, with ashes on the lid. When ready to serve, turn the border (previously poached) out on a dish, set the fillets, and the breasts of partridges in the centre; remove the onion, and aromatics, from the stewpan, drain off the fat, and pour the sauce in ; add to it a few tablespoonfuls of lean cooked ham in dice, let it boil, and pour it over the partridges. 881. Partridges, with purée of lentils. — Singe and draw two par- tridges, truss them with the legs in, cover with bacon, and place them in a narrow stewpan, the bottom of which is masked with sliced vegetables, trimmings of ham, a little fat, a bunch of aromatics, and peppercorns ; fry them' for half an hour over a moderate fire, occasionally turning them ; moisten half their height with wine and broth, let the liquid boil, then remove the stewpan to the entrance of the oven, or over a very slow fire, with hot ashes on the lid. When the partridges are done, pass the cooking-stock, skim off the fat, and thicken slightly with diluted potato-flour, or a piece of kneaded-butter. On the other hand, prepare a purée of lentils, keeping it a little firm. When ready to serve, heat it, introducing into it a few tablespoonfuls of saiice, pour it on a dish, remove the strings from the partridges, and dish them on the puree, one beside the other; pour over the remainder of the sauce. 882. Wild-ducks roasted, Polish way. — Singe two wild-ducks, wash them inwardly, truss, put them into a kitchen-basin, pour over a little cooked mari- nade, and let them macerate for five or six hours ; place them afterwards in a roasting-pan, with the marinade; cover them with buttered paper, and cook them, basting often ; when half-done, add to their cooking-stock two gills of good thick sour-cream, and finish cooking them gently, basting from time to time. When about to serve, drain, divest them of the string, and dish them up ; mix a little gravy with their cooking-stock ; reduce the liquid,’ stirring till thickened like a sauce ; then pass it over the ducks. 883. ‘Pain’ of wood-hen (gélinotte), with truffles (D. 175.) — Prepare some ‘quenelle’ force-meat with a pound and a quarter of the meat of wood- hen fillets, twelve ounces of rice-panada, twelve ounces of butter, and four yolks of393 GAME. — WOOD-, MOOR-, AND WATER-FOWL. eggs ; when seasoned, and passed through a sieve, put it into a kitchen-basin, and introduce into it four table-spoonfuls of double-cream. Butter a plain cylindric mould, which till with the force-meat, put it into a stew- pan with hot water, and poach the ‘pain’ for thirty-live minutes. Meanwhile, lix on the centre of a dish, a small column, masked with English-paste, glazed with a paste- brush, being of the same height as the mould, and hollowed on its centre. When | ready to serve, wipe the mould, turn it out on a dish, running the column into the cylinder ; remove the mould, and insert on the top of the column a small pewter cup, masked also with paste, and having a pointed end by way of foot, which can be introduced into the hollow of the column. Garnish the cup with a few small round truffles, and surround the ‘pain’ at its base, with a circle of cocks’-combs alternated with slices of truffles. Send up separately a boatful of ‘velouté’-sauce, reduced with the trimmings of the truffles, or their cooking-stock. 884. ‘Pain’ of wood-hens, Swedish way. — Take out the meat from the breast of three wood-hens (gelinottes), pare, pound it in a mortar, and when con- verted into paste, add, by degrees, half its volume of good butter, and five or six yolks of eggs ; season the preparation, pass it through a sieve, put it into a kitchen- basin, work it with a wooden spoon for a few minutes, then introduce into it the glair of an egg whipped up, and about the same quantity of whipped cream. When well mixed up, pour the preparation into a ‘timbale’-mould, and poach at the ‘bain-marie’ for twenty-live minutes. When about to serve, turn it out on a dish, and mask with a little ‘béchamel’-sauce, reduced with a few tablespoonfuls of meat-glaze. 885. Broiled wood-hens (gélinottes). — Take three or four fresh wood-hens, draw, truss them with their legs tucked into the body ; singe them to set394 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. their flesh, then divide each of them in two, lengthwise; beat slightly each of the pieces, season, and dip them in clarified butter, bread-crumb, and broil them on both sides orua moderate lire ; dish them up, and serve separately a cold tartar-sauce. 886. Wood-hen cutlets, à la Pojarski. — Pojarski is the name of a landlord {restaurateur), living between Saint Petersburg and Moscow, who acquired great renown by selling chopped cutlets, which at last took the landlord’s name. Take the breast-meat of three raw ‘gélinoties’, remove their skin and sinews, chop them, mix them with a quarter theîr volume of good butter, season them with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Divide this preparation in small parts, roll them on the floured table, giving them the shape of a small cutlet. Dip these cutlets into beaten eggs, so as to bread-crumb them ; stick to the most pointed end of each of them, a little cooked bpnc well cleansed. Fry these cutlets in a stewpan with butter, turning them ; dish them in a circular order, pour over the butter of their own cooking-stock. By the same method, cutlets of young partridges (perdreaux) may be prepared. 887. Wood-hens, Russ fashion. — Truss three or four wood-hens (gelinottes), put them into a stewpan with butter, season and fry them all over ; when about done, baste them with a few tablespoonfuls of sour-cream, and finish cooking them, basting frequently ; drain them afterwards, cut each of them into three parts, and dish them up. Mix a little ‘béchamel’ into the sauce, which reduce until of a good consistence, then pour it over the wood-hens; masking them with a thick coating; sprinkle over bread-crumbs, let them ‘gratinate’ in the oven, till the sauce is slightly colored. 888. Cold snipe-pie (D. 176). — Choose a channeled pie-mould of low shape ; butter its interior, set it on a round baking-sheet, covered with buttered paper. Prepare two pounds of common short-paste ; let it rest for two hours. Bone seven or eight wood-snipes, or three woodcocks, remove the skin from the meat, put them into a kitchen-basin, add to them a pound of raw truffles, cut in dice, moisten with four tablespoonfuls of madeira. Take the snipes’ livers and trails (intestins), add to them a few raw .poultry-livers; fry them together, with melted bacon, on a brisk fire; season highly, let them cool, pound, and pass them through a sieve. Take the meat of four hares’ legs, remove the tough parts, cut the meat in pieces, which immediately fry with bacon ; season them, pound, and pass them through a sieve ; which mix then into the previously strained purée. On the other hand, prepare some raw mince (hâchis), with lean veal or fresh pork (taking about two pounds) half and half, mixed with the same of fresh bacon. Season the mince, pound, pass it through a sieve ; put it into a basin, then add to it the purée of cooked meat.395 GAME. — WOOD-, MOOR-, AND WATER-FOWL. Line the mould with paste, then mask this paste with a thick layer of the pre- pared force-meat. Place in the centre the pieces of snipe and truffle, with alternate layers of the same force-meat. Raise the preparation in a dome. Cover the pie with paste, adorn it tastefully ; egg it on the top, bake it in a moderate oven for two hours, carefully covering it with paper. Half jan hour after, taking it out of the oven, Fig. 170. infilter into it, through the top, a few tablespoonfuls of aspic-jelly, mixed with a little madeira. The pie represented by the drawing, is dished on a napkin, the top is not open; as on the centre of the dome, on the summit of which during cooking-time an aper- ture is left for the evaporation of the steam, is placed the head of a snipe with the plumage on. For the sake of solidity the neck must be cut off, and the hollow filled with a piece of carrot, traversed by a bit of iron-wire. 889. Snipes roasted (D. 177). — Singe four snipes, and, without draw- ing. 177. ing, pick out their gizzard. Twist their legs over the thighs, run their bills through above the thighs, cover them with fat-bacon, and pierce them through with an iron- skewer, one beside the other; then set them on the spit, to roast them at a brisk fire, with pieces of toast underneath : they will take ten or twelve minutes. When done, salt them, take them oft'the fire, and dish them up on the toasts, with water-cresses round ; send up separately a sauceboat of good gravy.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 396 In Russia ‘double snipes’ are often served ; but I do not think the species are known, either in England, or in France. 890. Cold-pie of wood-hen (gélinottes). — Take out the fillets of four wood-hens, remove their skin and bones, divide each of the fillets in two; which pieces put into a kitchen-basin ; season, add to them about a pound of raw ham (washed from its salt) cut in big dice ; and baste with a few tablespoonfuls of cognac. Cut off the meat from the thighs of the hens, pare, and chop it with the fillets of two fowls ; put these meats into the mortar, with an equal quantity of lean veal, and double of fresh bacon, both previously chopped; pound the force-meat, season, put it into another basin ; add to it a few tablespoonfuls of chopped mush- rooms, cooked with a pinch of chopped onion. Butter a cold-pie-mould, set it on a thick baking-sheet covered with paper, and line it (see No. 857) with short-paste, mask the bottom and sides with some of the force-meat, and fill the hollow with the ham and the fillets, alternating them by layers of force-meat, previously mixed up with the marinade of the fillets. Cover the pie, proceeding according to the usual method (see No. 857); adorn it; egg, and bake it in a moderate oven for two hours, taking care to put a piece of paper over it, as soon as it takes color. Half an hour after, the pie being taken out of the oven, fill it at the top with two gills of aspic-jelly, mixed up with a little wine, and a little good gravy or meat- glaze. The backs and other bones of water-hens should be used very sparingly, even for the flavoring of sauce, as they are of a decidedly bitter taste. 891. Purée of woodcocks, with plovers’ or lapwings’ eggs. — Take the meat of two cooked woodcocks, remove the skin, cut it in dice ; which put into a mortar. Break the back and bones up, put them into a stewpan with trimmings of ham, sliced vegetables, a few sprigs of aromatics, half a glass of white wine, and a little thickened gravy ; boil the liquid for a quarter of an hour on the side of the tire, strain it through a sieve, and reduce to half-glaze. Pound the meat, as well as the trails (or inwards) of the woodcocks with a piece of butter, and four tablespoonfuls of rice, boiled in broth, but well dried ; pass the preparation through a sieve, put the purée into a stewpan, season, heat it, without allowing it to boil, stirring it with a spoon, and gradually adding to it three parts of the extract of woodcocks, pre- viously reduced. Dish up the purée, surround it with lapwings’ or plovers’ eggs, boiled in water for eight minutes, then picked. Baste the purée with the remainder of the half-glaze.GAME. — WOOD-, MOOR-, AND WATER-FOWL. 397 892. Black-cock, German fashion. — Keep a black-cock, till quite tender, hanging in the air; pluck, draw, and truss it, remove the skin from the breast, to lard it, put it into a baking-sheet with butter; salt slightly, and roast it in the oven, basting ; when half-done, moisten it with half a pint of sour-cream, and finish cooking it. Dish it up afterwards, add a little gravy to the sauce ; which reduce, stirring, till well thickened ; and pass it, through a sieve, over the bird. 893. Grouse-pie. — Cut up a brace of grouse, each of them in five parts, which season with salt and pepper. Mask the bottom of a pie-dish with a layer of game force-meat, on which place the pieces of grouse, sprinkle over a little'cooked fine-herbs; fill the cavities, between the pieces, with a few yolks of hard-boiled eggs, and place on the top of the grouse, a few slices of raw ham ; moisten them half their height with good gravy; cover the pie with paste, proceeding as directed in No. 596 ; egg, and push it into a moderate oven, for one hour and a half : when done, set it on another dish. 894. Roast grouse, with bread-crumbs. — Pluck, draw, singe, and truss, a brace of grouse ; run them through on their length with an iron-skewer, which fix on the spit; set the birds to the fire, basting with butter, while cooking; when about done, sprinkle over a little flour, and put them to the fire again, to dry their surface ; take them off the fire, and dish them up with gravy under. Meanwhile toast in the oven a few crusts of white bread ; when slightly colored, pound, and pass them through a fine colander ; keep the crumb hot in a sauceboat, and send it up with the roast. This bread-crumb is also served with thrushes, wood- cocks, snipes, and plovers. 895. Grouse-cutlets. Victoria-sauce. — Get three or four young grouse; singe, draw, and cut them in two lengthwise. Split the drum-stick, and thrust it inside the tip of the leg ; beat each half slightly, pare, season with salt and pepper, l roll in clarified butter, bread-crumb, and fry them on a moderate oven for twelve minutes ; when done on one side, turning them over to the other ; dish them up, and serve with the following sauce : Victoria-sauce. — Put into a small stewpan a tablespoonful of chopped shalot, a small bunch of aromatics, and the juice of two lemons ; cover the stewpan, boil the liquid for two minutes, add to it three or four tablespoonfuls of raw mushrooms cut in large dice, which cook until their moisture be reduced; moisten them afterwards with a gill of melted meat-glaze, let the liquid boil, and remove the stewpan back, i introducing into the sauce five ounces of butter ; stir it on the corner of the stove, until the butter be melted, but without letting it boil ; when it is creamy, and wellCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 398 thickened, add to it a little vinegar, a tablespoonful of soy, two spoonfuls of gerkins cut in small dice, and a pinch of tai’agon-leaves cut in lozenges. 896. Snipes, Rouen fashion. — Draw eight snipes, take out the back- bone. Prepare a little force-meat, with fresh pork mixed up with the same quantity of raw chopped mushrooms, a pinch of shalot, one of parsley and pepper; till them with it ; sew them up with thread, truss, and run them through with an iron-skewer, which fix on a spit ; set them to a brisk fire to roast, basting with butter, keeping seven or eight crusts of bread on the dripping-pan, underneath them. Meanwhile, slice two large onions, put them into a stewpan with butter, fry them to a nice color, season, sprinkle oyer a small pinch of flour, moisten with a little gravy, and finish cooking them slowly. Fry'the trails, together with two or three chickens’ livers; season, pound, and pass them through a sieve ; dilute the purée with a few tablespoonfuls of good wine; and when the onions are done, take them off the fire, and add them to the purée, without allowing this to boil ; when done, remove the snipes from the fire, glaze, and dish them up, placing each of them on one of the ‘croûtons’; baste them with the sauce, and serve. I 897. ‘Chaufroix’ of snipes (D. 178). — Bone ten or twelve snipes, season inwardly, and put them by, as well as the heads. Slice half a pound of calf’s liver, fry it with lard, add to it the trails of the snipes, a pinch of chopped onion, a few sprigs of aromatics, and some trimmings of truffles, seasoning the whole well ; the liver and trails being done, take them off the fire, allow them to cool, and pound with half their volume of chopped fresh bacon; then add two or three truffles in small dice ; with which stuff the snipes. Sew the snipes in an oval form, surround each of them with a strip of buttered paper, and place them in a stewpan, spread with trimmings of bacon ; this done, moisten to half with gravy (made with the back and bones), and white wine ; cover them with paper, braise for twenty minutes, on a slow fire, with hot ashes on the lid, and allow them to cool ; then removing the paper and strings, pare them neatly. Pass the cooking-stock through a sieve, skim off the fat, reduce to half-glaze, and mix with it half a pint of brown-sauce; set the stewpan again on the fire, to clarify the sauce, for a quarter of an hour, skimming it carefully ; strain, and reduce it again, stirring, and introducing into it half its volume of aspic-jelly. The sauce being suc- culent, and of smooth appearance, pass it into another stewpan, and allow it to halt- cool ; then set the stewpan on some pounded ice, and stir the sauce until slightly thickened ; then take it out, and dip therein the snipes, thus masking them with a smooth and glossy coating, placing them evenly on a baking-sheet, to allow the sauce to set.GAME. — WOOD-, MOOR-, AND WATER-FOWL. 399 On the other hand, cook the snipes’ heads, pare them neatly, and glaze with a paste-brush. When ready to serve, take the ‘galantines’ off the baking-sheet, trim away the surplus of sauce, holding them as little as possible, so as not to tarnish their brightness, using a fork ; dish them up in a pyramidal form on a small stand, place between each of the pieces one of the heads, which support with chopped aspic-jelly. Fig. 178. To dish up these ‘galantines’ correctly, they should be set up, leaning against a small pyramidal support, masked with paper and chopped aspic. The stand is cast in several pieces, either in fat or stearine. In both cases, they should inwardly he supported by an iron rod, or a wooden support, fixed on a flat, forming the basis of the stand. 898. Hot-pie (pâté-chaud) of snipes. — Pluck a dozen snipes, singe them, bone the backs only, and season them. Fry the snipes’ trails with a little rasped fat-bacon ; season, pound, and pass them through a sieve ; then add to the purée the same volume of ‘godiveau’, or of raw ‘quenelle’ force-meat, as well as four tablespoonfuls of cooked fine-herbs. ' With this preparation, fill the snipes, sew them with strong thread, trussing their legs, set them in a stewpan with melted fat-bacon, and half a pound of streaky bacon, cut in small squares ; toss them over a brisk fire until well set, add about fifteen raw mushrooms, cover the stewpan, and five minutes after, take it off the fire ; then let the snipes cool a little, and remove the thread.400 COSMOPOLITAN COOKEKY. Butter a hot-pie-mould of a shallow form, set it on a baking-sheet covered with paper, line it with short-paste ; mask the bottom and sides with a layer of 'godiveau', place in it the snipes with the bacon and mushrooms, alternating them with the force-meat; set up the preparation in the mould in a dome-like fashion, mask it with slices of fat bacon, and cover it with a flat of paste; finish the pie, proceeding as directed in No. 857 ; egg, and bake it in a moderate oven, for an hour and a quarter; when taken out, make a circular incision on the cover, lift it out, remove the bacon, and pour into the pie some good sauce, reduced with 'fumet’ of game, drawn from the back and bones of snipes ; cover the pie, dish it up, and serve. 899. ‘Soufflés’ of woodcock, in small cases. — Pound the cooked meat of two woodcocks with a piece of butter, their trails, and a third their volume of cold dry cooked rice ; season, and pass the preparation through a fine sieve. Twenty minutes previous to serving, warm the purée very slightly, «without allowing it to boil, take it off the fire, and introduce into it six yolks of eggs well beaten up, then four or five whipped whites of eggs ; with this preparation fill eight or ten plaited paper-cases of high form, previously buttered. Arrange these cases on a baking-sheet, slightly spread with butter, and bake the 'souffles’ in a slow oven for eighteen minutes. When taken out of the oven, dish up the cases on a folded napkin. 900. Woodcocks, stuffed (D. 179). — Bone three good woodcocks, cut off the greatest part of the breast-meat, and divide it in dice ; put it into a kitchen- basin, mix it up with an equal quantity of raw truffles, and the same of fat-liver; season, and pour on the whole two tablespoonfuls of madeira. Pound the meat of the legs, together with that of three raw pigeons, add to them a third their volume of panada, and four yolks of eggs ; season the force-meat, and pass it through a sieve. Melt four tablespoonfuls of rasped fat-bacon in a stewpan, fry with it the trails of woodcocks, and five or six good poulets’ livers, season the preparation highly, and allow it to cool ; pound it afterwards, pass it through a sieve, and mix with it the force-meat of the legs, adding the truffles and meat kept in the basin. With this preparation, stuff the woodcocks in a 'galantine’-shape ; surround them with bacon, tie them separately into small napkins, securing them in form with twine ; boil them in a good stock, on a moderate fire, for one hour; allow them to half-cool in the stock ; drain them, unpack, and pack them up again tighter, and let them cool under a light weight. Half an hour previous to serving, take the 'galantines’ out of the napkins, cut up the breast in the way shown by the drawing, place them in a proportionate stewpan, with some of their stock reduced to half-glaze, and heat them at the entrance of the oven, basting often. Dish them afterwards in a triangular form, and upright401 GAME. — WOOD-, MOOR-, AND WATER-FOWL. position, on a foundation of poached force-meat, bearing on its centre a support of fried bread, masked with force-meat. Set, in the angles, the three heads, slightly cooked, and glazed with a paste-brush ; insert, on the top of the support, three ‘liâtelet’- skewers, garnished with truffles, and pour over the woodcocks and force-meat, some brown-sauce, prepared with the stock of the game, and the trimmings of truffles. Fig. 179. This entree is of a rather complicated preparation, but I thought it not out of place to initiate beginners to these sorts of dishes ; which are so seldom served, and yet on many occasions may find their place, and produce a very good effect. 901. Woodcocks, roasted with crusts (D. 180). — Draw two fine woodcocks, hung till quite tender; twist their neck, which introduce into the crop; truss them with string, then run through their thighs an iron-skewer, and set them Fig. 180. on the spit. Fry their trails in butter; pound, and pass them through a sieve; then add four tablespoonfuls of raw 'quenelle' force-meat, and the same of melted glaze, (hit up some bread-crust of an oval shape, make an incision on the upper surface of each ; fry them in butter, and after being emptied, garnish them with the prepared force-meat. Roast the woodcocks at a good fire for fourteen or fifteen minutes, placing underneath several pieces of toast, intended to imbibe the drippings from the birds.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 402 When done, salt them, take them off the fire, and remove the strings. Place the toasts on an oblong dish, put the woodcocks on them, the legs towards the centre, glaze them with a paste-brush, and surround them with the fried crust, garnishing the centre with water-cresses. Send up separately some good gravy, reduced to half-glaze. 902. ‘Terrine’ Of woodcocks. — Bone two woodcocks, divide each of them in two, which pieces put into a pie-dish {terrine), with five or six peeled truffles cut in quarters, the same volume of cooked ham-fat, or fat-bacon in large dice; season the meats and truffles highly, and baste with the third part of a glass of madeira. Take off the flesh from a leg of hare ; cut it in pieces, fry it in a stewpan, with double its volume of liver of poultry or game ; when well set, add the trails of the woodcocks, then let the whole cool, to be chopped afterwards, with a third its volume of lean pork. Season the force-meat, put it into a mortar, pound, and add to it the same quantity of fresh fat-bacon, previously chopped, and pounded with the trim- mings of truffles. Season the force-meat with a pinch of pounded aromatics ; five minutes after, remove it into a kitchen-basin, and mix with it the madeira the woodcocks have been soaking in. Mask the bottom and sides of a pie-dish (terrine à cuire) with some of the prepared force-meat ; arrange the pieces of woodcocks, the truffles, and the ham, in the centre, alternating with force-meat : the pie-dish must then be completely full ; smooth the top with the blade of a knife, and mask it with slices of bacon ; cover the preparation, and set the pie-dish in a ‘sauté’-pan with a glass of hot water, and push it into a moderate oven, to bake for an hour and a half; when done, take it out ; and when half-cold, put a light weight on the top of the preparation. When completely cold, take it off the pie, cut it in oblong squares ; which dish, in a circular order, into the ‘terrine’. * 903. Salmis of woodcocks. — Truss two woodcocks, without drawing them, cover with fat bacon, roast them on the spit ; and as soon as done, cut each ot them into five parts : which place in a flat stewpan with the heads, and baste with a few tablespoonfuls of melted glaze; put the lid on the stewpan, and keep it off the tire. Now put the trails into a mortar, with a few cooked chickens’ livers, the backs and trimmings of the woodcocks ; pound, to convert them into paste ; which dilute with a glass of good white wine, and pass the preparation through a sieve. Slice a small onion, fry it in a stewpan with a piece of butter, a few tablespoon- fuls of raw ham, and a sprig of parsley and aromatics ; a few minutes after, sprinkle over these ingredients a pinch of flour, moisten them with a little white wine, broth, or gravy, and the stock of the dripping-pan, skimmed from the fat; stir the sauceGAME. — WOOD-, MOOR-, AND WATER-FOWL. 403 till boiling, remove it back, boil it for twelve minutes more, and skim the fat off; it should be of a nice taste, and slightly thickened ; pass it then through a sieve, and add it to the preparation in reserve ; pour the whole over the pieces of woodcock ; which warm without allowing to boil, and place them on a hot dish, masked with ‘croûtons’ of fried bread. Mask the woodcocks with the sauce. 904. Bécasseaux, in small croustades (D. 181). — ‘Bécasseaux’ are somewhat smaller than snipes (bécassines), but belonging to the same species, they may be prepared in the same way. Fig. 181.' Singe and bone ten ‘bécasseaux’, and season inwardly ; cut up the backs and the bones in pieces ; fry them quickly, moisten with a little wine and broth, to obtain a good gravy; which reduce afterwards to half-glaze, and thicken this with a little sauce. Put the trails of the ‘bécasseaux’ into a frying-pan, fry them quickly with a few chickens’ livers, and some rasped fat-bacon ; season, let them cool, and pound them, with half their volume of chopped fat-bacon, and the same of panada ; put this force- meat then into a kitchen-basin, and mix with it a third its volume of raw truffles in small dice. With this preparation stuff the birds to an oval shape (all but one, which should be round) ; securing them with stout thread ; place them after in a stewpan, the bottom of which is garnished with bacon and vegetables ; salt them, moisten to half height with wine and gravy, and braise. On the other hand, cut up ten small bread-‘croustades’, one round, the rest oval, only pointed like a heart ; make an incision on the upper surface with the point of the knife ; fry, and then empty them ; mask them inwardly, all over, with a thin layer of game ‘quenelle’ force-meat; keep them at the entrance of the oven, till the force- meat is poached; then insert into each of the ‘croustades’ a‘galantine’ of‘bécasseaux’; mask these with what remains of the sauce, mixed up with a little glaze ; and put them again at the entrance of the oven, for a few minutes ; after which dish up the ‘croustades’ on a folded napkin scroll-wise, placing one on the top of all the others. 905. Terrine of lapwings (vanneaux). — The common lapwing differs from the plover by having four claws to each foot ; the plover having but 2C*COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 404 three. The lapwings eaten in Italy and in the south of France, are of a delicacy not to be found in those living in the north of Europe, or even in England. Take out the fillets of seven or eight lapwings, put them into a kitchen-basin : season with salt and spices, and baste with a few table-spoonfuls of madeira. Detach the flesh of the legs, cut it in pieces, and put them aside. Pick out the trails and livers of the birds, fry them with a few chickens’ livers, some fat-bacon and fine- herbs ; let them cool, then pound, and pass them through a sieve. Trim, and cut in pieces, the flesh of two legs of hare ; put the pieces into a stewpan, with the flesh of the legs of the lapwings, and some rasped fat-bacon ; fry the whole together over a brisk fire : season, let it cool, and then pound it with an equal quantity of fresh fat-bacon. Now add to the force-meat the preparation of trails and livers passed through a sieve. Mask the bottom and sides of the pie-dish (terrine) with thin slices of fat- bacon, fill the centre alternately, with the prepared force-meat, and the fillets of lapwings ; cover the preparation with bacon, set the lid on the ‘terrine’, which place on a baking-sheet, and bake in a moderate oven for an hour and a half; then take the ‘terrine’ out, and let the preparation cool completely, before serving. 906. ‘Gratin’ of plovers. — Bone four or five plovers, leaving the hone of the thighs; season inwardly, fill with a cooked force-meat (see No. 897), and truss them. Spread the bottom of a ‘gratin’- dish with a thick layer of ‘quenelle’ force-meat, mixed up with the remainder of the cooked force-meat, keeping it a little higher on the centre. On this range the plovers, in a close circle, half-sunk within the force- meat, with the legs towards the centre, and the breasts to the outside ; then surround them, as well as the force-meat, with a double strip of buttered paper, to support them ; stiffen this with yolks of eggs, and then secure with string. Mask the plovers with slices of fat-bacon, and with paper ; set the dish on a baking-sheet reversed, so as not to expose the bottom to too severe a heat, and push it into a moderate oven, in which leave it for one hour. When the plovers are done, take the dish out, remove the paper and the bacon, spunge the fat off, unfasten, and cut each plover in two ; put them hack into place; mask them with a brown-sauce, reduced with a good ‘fumet’ prepared with the plovers’ back-bones ; surround, and garnish above, with cooked mushrooms. 907. ‘Chaufroix’ Of plovers. — Roast on the spit, or in the oven, four plovers ; when done, let them cool, and divide each of them into four parts ; remove the skin, and the bones as much as possible ; pound their trails, and pass them through a sieve.405 GAME. — BUSTARD, QUAILS. With the plovers’ bones and trimmings, prepare a little extract of game ; pass it, skim off the fat, reduce it to half-glaze ; thicken afterwards with about two gills of brown-sauce, reduce it for a few minutes, and take it off the fire. With this sauce, dilute, by degrees, the previously prepared purée, introduce into it a third its volume of very limed, but liquid aspic-jelly; let the sauce cool a little, then stir it on the ice to thicken it slightly; dip afterwards the pieces of plover in this sauce, masking them entirely with a smooth coating ; place them evenly on a baking-sheet, allowing the sauce to set. When ready to serve, pare the pieces of plover of the surplus of sauce, without handling them too much ; and dish them in pyramids in the centre of an aspic border, turning the legs to the bottom, and the wings to the top. 908. Quails, with purée of green-pease (D. 82). — Truss eight or ten quails with the legs bent back outwards ; cover them with fat-bacon, lay Fig. 182. them in a flat stewpan, the bottom of which is garnished with trimmings of bacon and vegetables ; and moisten, to three-parts their height, with gravy, or some broth with toppings ; reduce the liquid to half, and withdraw the stewpan on to a moderate fire, placing live embers on the lid, and cooking the birds gently.; drain them, and remove the string. When ready to serve, turn out on a dish a border of force-meat poached, fill the hollow in the centre of this border with a purée of green-pease, and dish the quails round the purée, one beside the other, the breast downwards, the legs uppermost. Reduce the stock to half-glaze, skim the fat away carefully, thicken it with a little white sauce, with which baste the quails. 909. Bustard stewed. — Let the bustard hang up in the air for several clays; pluck, and draw it; cut away the neck, and the tip of the wings; remove the thighs from the back, and the back from the breast, both breast and thighs being hu-ded with bacon ; season, and place the meats in an earthen pan, moisten with two glasses of vinegar, wherein let them macerate for twenty-four hours.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 406 Garnish an earthen stock-pot, on the bottom and sides, with thin layers of fat- bacon , spread over the bottom a few small onions, a bunch of aromatics, two calfs feet, boned and blanched, cloves and peppercorns; whereon place the back-hones and legs ; add the breast of the bustard, previously drained of the marinade ; moisten to half their height with white wine, cover the meat with bacon, and reduce the stock for a few minutes ; cover the stock-pot hermetically with paper, and a common dish, half-full of water ; surround it with hot ashes and tire, to half its height ; and thus stew the meat for six or seven hours, according to its tenderness. Afterwards take it carefully out, and dish it, with the calf’s feet and vegetables ; skim the fat from the cooking-stock, and pass it over the meat. 910. Quails with bay-leaves, Provence fashion. — Draw six fat quails ; chop their livers with a little fat-bacon, add to this force-meat a hunch of parsley, a little pepper, a table-spoonful of chopped shalôt, a handful of bread- crumbs, and the half of a beaten egg ; stuff the quails with this preparation, run them through with an iron-skewer, alternating each of them with a bay-leaf ; baste them with lard, and roast them at a brisk fire, for ten or twelve minutes. Meanwhile, melt in a stewpan some of the quails’ fat from the dripping-pan; mix it with a handful of fresh rasped bread-crumbs, and half a pound of steeped raw ham cut in dice ; fry them together for a few seconds, and moisten, by degrees, with a glass of white wine, and a little gravy, or some melted glaze ; give the sauce a few bubblings, take it off the fire, add to it the juice of two lemons, and pour it over the quails, dished up with the bay-leaves. 911. Quails with green-pease. — Draw six quails, singe and truss them, as for an entree ; put them into a stewpan with a piece of butter ; fry them, and when of a nice color, add them to half a pound of streaky bacon, blanched, cut in squares, and a pint and a half of green-pease; add a little broth, a bunch of parsley, one onion, and a little salt; cover the stewpan, and five minutes after, place it on a moderate fire, with live embers on the lid; a quarter of an hour later, the quails and pease should be done; then drain the quails, and remove the string; thicken the pease with a small piece of kneaded-butter, remove the parsley, and dish them, setting the quails round, on the pease, with the breasts towards the sides of the dish ; glaze, and serve. 912. Quails of the ‘Frères Provençaux’. — Bone six quails, season, and put them by. Prepare a little force-meat, with equal parts of raw chicken’s meat and cooked chickens’livers, mixed up with half their volume of fat-bacon ; when seasoned, and passed through a sieve, introduce into it a few tablespoonfuls of raw truffles in small dice, and stuff the quails therewith ; then fold the skin underneath,GAME. — LARKS. 407 giving a round form to the 'galantines’; butter them very slightly with a paste-brush, set each of them, on the breast-side, on a small square flat of short-paste, fold the edges of the paste over the 'galantines’, carefully soldering them above ; then place the quails on a baking-sheet, resting them on the soldering; surround the paste with a small strip of buttered paper, butter slightly the top of the paste, and push the baking-sheet into a moderate oven. Ten minutes afterwards, cover the paste with paper ; and three quarters of an hour later, take the baking-sheet out of the oven, remove the strips of paper, and serve up the quails. This dish was for some time much called for at the great 'restaurants’ of Paris. 913. Larks (mauviettes) for epicures (D. 183). — Get twelve large black truffles, as round as possible; brush them, pick out, with the point of a small Fig. 183. knife, all the adhering particles of earth ; then put them into a stewpan ; pour over a glass of madeira, salt slightly, and boil them covered, for six or seven minutes; drain them immediately, set them upright on their smoothest surface, make on the top a circular incision, and empty, by scooping out the interior. Glaze the interior with a paste-brush, and keep them covered. Take the interior of the truffles ; chop and pound them, with an equal volume of cooked fat-liver. Season the preparation with a pinch of spices, add to it two tablespoonfuls of brown-sauce, reduced with the stock of the truffles ; pass it through a sieve, and garnish with it the interior of the truffles. On the other hand, remove the pouch and gizzards from twelve fat white field- larks (mauviettes), cut off their leg-bones, and stuff them with the rest of the pre- paration of fat-liver; place them in a flat stewpan, baste with plenty of clarified butter; salt, and fry them for six or seven minutes on a brisk fire, with hot ashes on the lid ; as soon as done:, drain the fat off, pom- over the birds a little melted glaze ; drain, and place one of them in each of the truffles. Dip the bottom of each truffle into melted glaze, and set seven (fixing them solidly) on the bottom on the dish, four over them, and one on the top of all. Send up separately the remainder of the brown-sauce in a sauceboat.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 408 914. Quails in cases. — Draw seven or eight quails, and take out half of the back-bone. Put their livers into a frying-pan, with some rasped fat-bacon ; as well as seven or eight raw chickens’ livers; season, and fry them over a brisk tire; when done, let them cool, and pound them with an equal quantity of fresh fat-bacon, previously chopped ; add to this force-meat a chopped truffle, season it, and stuff the quails with half of it; sew the quails up, truss, and put them into a stewpan with a little butter, frying them till half-done. Add to the remainder of the force-meat two or three tablespoonfuls of cooked fine-herbs, spread a layer of it on the bottom of seven or eight oval paper-cases, previously oiled ; put a quail into each case, which set on a baking-sheet, lined with a double paper ; surround them also with a strip of paper, and keep them in a slack oven for eighteen or twenty minutes; when taken out, dish the cases up, mask them with a little good sauce, reduced with madeira; and serve. 915. Quails, Turkish fashion. — Take eight or ten trussed quails, place them in a stewpan with butter, fry till half-cooked, season them ; if there be too much fat, drain off part of it. Then add to the quails a pound of good rice, washed and dried, as well as a bunch of parsley garnished with aromatics. Let the rice fry for two minutes, moisten it then with broth, to double its height; add a few table- spoonfuls of clear tomata-purée. Boil the rice for fifteen or twenty minutes ; dish, placing the quails all round. 916. Quails with rice. -— Draw, and truss seven or eight quails, as for an entrée; put them into a stewpan Avith a piece of butter, let them take color on a moderate fire; add to them half a pound of lean bacon, blanched and cut in squares ; two minutes after, drain the quails and bacon Avith a skimmer ; add to the butter two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion, fry it to a nice color, and add ten ounces of rice,' picked, Avashed, and drained for one hour, on a sieve; heat it for a feAv seconds, stirring ; then moisten it three times its height Avith broth ; boil the liquid, and five minutes after, put in a bunch of parsley, the quails, and the bacon ; cover the stewpan, and keep it at the entrance of the oven, or on a moderate fire, with hot ashes on the lid. Twenty minutes after, the quails and rice ought to be done. Dish the rice, on which arrange the quails all round. 917. Quails in bladders. — Bone the breasts of a few quails, pre- viously plucked and singed ; draw them on this side, fill the hollow Avith a small raAv truffle, and a little butter. Remove the skin of the breast back underneath, sew it in order to close the aperture. Wrap each quail up in a double piece of pork-bladder, bind it carefully with thread ; plunge the quails into boiling water, let them boil for forty minutes. Unwrap, and dish them up with their gra\7y. Serve separately a little 'perigueux’-sauce.409 GAME. — QUAILS, LAKES. 918. Cold-patties (D. 184). — With some short-paste spread a few small cold-patty moulds ; till them with a common preparation of raw liver-spain’. Cover them with a thin flat of paste, bake them in a slack oven. When the pies are taken out of the oven, let them cool ; cut open the lid, and remove part of the game Spain’ preparation ; then fill the hollow with the contents of Fig. 184. a little ‘terrine’ of fat-liver, cut them with a warm little tea-spoon ; raise the preparation in a dome above the edges of the paste. Place on the top of the preparation a little jelly-‘croûton’. Range the patties, in a pyramid, on a cold dish. 919. Small cold-patties Of larks (D. 185). — Bone seven larks, re- serving their heads; season, stuff them with a preparation, in the conditions prescribed in No. 897 ; shape them round, surround them with a strip of buttered paper, and Fig. 185. braise them short of moisture; let them cool, then pare, glaze them with a paste- brush, and mask them with a thin coating of aspic-jelly. On the other hand, bake twelve small channeled pie-crusts; when cold, mask them at the bottom, and all round, with a preparation of purée of cooked livers, diluted with a little ‘chaufroix’-sauce ; half-fill the crusts with chopped aspic, and set the ‘galantines’ thereon. Insert on the top of each a lark’s head, previously cooked, and glazed with a paste-brush. Dish the small patties then on a folded napkin.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 410 920. Quails with truffles. — Singe seven or eight quails, and only half-remove their back-bone. Pick and peel live or six black truffles, cut them in small dice, and keep them covered in a small stewpan. Fry the livers of the quails with those of three or four chickens, and some rasped fat-bacon ; pound them with half the truffle-peelings, and add to it an equal quantity of chopped fat-bacon : season the preparation, pass it through a sieve, and stuff with it the quails, which sew up, truss, and place them in a ‘sauté’-pan, the bottom of which is spread with trimmings of bacon and of ham; add the remainder of the truffle-trimmings; moisten them to half with white wine, salt slightly, and cover them with a buttered paper, letting the liquid boil up, then removing the stewpan on a moderate fire, with hot ashes on the lid. As soon as the quails are done, remove the thread, and dish them up; pass their cooking-stock through a sieve, skim off the fat, add a little brown-sauce, and reduce it, stirring. Pour over the truffles, cut in dice, a quarter of a glass of madeira or sherry; boil them for two minutes, add them to the sauce, which pour over the quails. • 921. Quails, Bohemian fashion. — Singe seven or eight quails, bone their sides to half only. Pluck five or six black truffles, in order to peel them ; cut them in small dice, which keep covered in a little stewpan. Let the livers of the quails fry with three or four poultry-livers, and some bacon ; pound them with half the peel of the truffles, and add to them an equal quantity of chopped bacon ; season the preparation, pass it through a sieve, with it fill the quails ; sew them up, truss, and place them in a stewpan, spread with trim- mings of bacon and ham ; add to the above the remainder of the peel of the truffles ; moisten, to half their height, with white wine; very slightly salt them, and then cover with a buttered paper. Let the liquid boil, remove the stewpan back on to a moderate fire, with embers on the lid. As soon as the quails are done, untruss and dish them up ; pass the stock through a sieve, drain its fat, mix in a little brown-sauce, which let reduce, stirring it. Moisten the truffles with a quarter of a glassful of madeira, boil them for two minutes, add them to the saüce, and pour this on the quails. 922. Tourte of larks. — Pluck and draw two dozen larks ; cut away their legs and necks, put them into a stewpan, with a little lard, some chopped fat-bacon, and six ounces of streaky bacon cut in pieces ; fry them for a few minutes on a brisk fire, season with salt and nutmeg, add a bay-leaf, then draw them off the fire, and let them cool. Prepare about a pound of veal ‘quenelle’ force-meat, mixing it up with a little cooked game-flesh or chickens’ livers. When the force-meat is passed through a sieve, mix it with a few tablespoonfuls of chopped and cooked mush- rooms.411 GAME. - QUAILS, LARKS, THRUSHES. y Now spread eight ounces of short-paste in a round flat, rather thick ; set it on a round baking-sheet (tourtière), wet the edges of the paste, and garnish its centre with a layer of force-meat; on which arrange the larks in a dome-like fashion, Ailing the cavities with force-meat; then cover the dome with thin slices of fat-bacon, Anishing the operation, proceeding as in No. 897 ; bake the ‘tourte’ in a moderate oven for one hour; when done, slip it on a dish, make a circular incision on the centre, removing the top, and through this opening, take out the bacon ; baste the inside of the ‘tourte’ with a few tablespoonfuls of good brown-sauce, or some thickened gravy, reduced with a little wine ; cover it again, and send it up. 923. Small cases of thrushes with truffles (D. 186). — Prepare a dozen ‘galantines’ of thrushes, shaping one end pointed, and the other round. Pare, Fig. 186. glaze them with a paste-brush, and mask them with a thin coating of‘chaufroix’- sauce. Get twelve plaited paper-cases, pointed on one end ; garnish them with a little chopped aspic, and place a ‘galantine’ in each of them. Prepare a small cold entrée-stand of the shape of a channeled cup, and adorned on the top with a hanging channeled border. This stand may be in three pieces, and the base in massive wood, masked with fat. The hanging border is modeled with the hand. When the stand is Axed on a dish, take a few cooked and cold peeled truffles, dip them in melted meat-glaze, and dish them up on the centre of the cup of the stand. Surround the base with a thick string of chopped aspic, squeezed through a cornet ; then place the small cases all round, applying the pointed end against the truffles. My object here has been, to represent the prettiest method of serving this entrée, really simple, and yet very distinguished. But one should not forget, that the stand is here nothing but an accessory, to be omitted at pleasure.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 412 924. Larks with rice. — Pluck, draw, and singe, fifteen larks; cut away their legs, put them into a stewpan with half a pound of raw ham, previously steeped in water, and cut in dice ; and fry them with butter. As soon as set, take them out, as well as the ham, with a skimmer, and place them on a dish ; add then to the butter in the stewpan two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion, which fry without allowing to take color, and add twelve ounces of rice, previously picked, washed, and drained on a sieve for an hour ; fry it a few seconds, stirring ; then moisten it three times its height with broth, add a bunch of parsley and a little cayenne pepper, cover the stewpan, and boil the rice for ten minutes ; put back into it the larks, and draw the stewpan on a moderate tire, with hot ashes on the lid : when the rice is done, it should be dry. Now remove the aromatics, add a little tomata-sauce ; turn out the rice into a deep dish, arrange the larks on the top, in a circular order ; glaze them with a paste-brush, and serve. 925. Larks, in shape Of pears. — Singe and bone about fifteen larks, leaving only one leg whole, of which the tip is to be run underneath the skin ; season the larks inwardly, fill them with a little force-meat (No. 897) : sew them up lengthwise into the shape of a pear, the leg standing for the stem ; wrap each of them in a thin slice of bacon, and secure them in shape with thread; braise them, short of moisture, with good stock, and a little white wine ; allow them to cool in their own stock; then unpack them, to trim; dip them in a frying-paste (No. 275), and plunge them into hot hog’s lard ; fry them to a nice color, drain, and dish them up, in a conical form, on a napkin. 926. Larks in cases. — Bone completely a dozen fresh larks ; put the trails into the frying-pan with rasped fat-bacon, a few chickens’ livers, and trim- mings of fat-liver; toss them on a brisk fire, season, add to them a few trimmings of mushrooms, and let the preparation cool ; then pound it, and add half its volume of fresh fat-bacon, previously chopped and pounded. Put then a part of this force-meat into each of the larks, fold them into the shape of a ball, arrange them on the bottom of a stewpan, baste with a paste-brush dipped in glaze, and a little madeira ; boil them quickly for a few minutes, to set them, after which take them off the fire. Oil some small plaited paper-cases, mask the bottom with some of the force- meat kept by, lay a lark in each of the cases, which place on a small baking-sheet, and push them into a slow oven. Ten minutes after, baste the larks with a little melted glaze, and five minutes later dish them up, glazing them with a paste-brush dipped in a good reduced sauce. 927. Larks of Leipzig. — It is in the month of October, when the misty mornings fall in, that these fine larks appear all of a sudden, in the vast plains ol413 GAME. — LARKS, ORTOLANS. Leipzig. They are the delight of epicures, being as fat and tender as ortolans. The shooting of these birds lasts only for a few weeks ; but then such a large quantity can be taken every day, that it is sufficient to purvey all the great cities of Ger- many. They are bought ready plucked, excepting the head and wings. Cut the wings and the legs at the first joint, pluck the head, pick out the giz- zard; singe them quickly, run them through with small wooden skewers, four to each ; put them into a flat stewpan with butter, salt, and fry them all over on a brisk fire. Two minutes after, sprinkle over bread-crumbs, and push them into the oven, or on a slow fire, with hot embers on the lid, to finish cooking them. Drain them afterwards, dish them up in two rows, removing the skewers, pour the bread-crumbs and butter over ; and serve. 928. ‘Gratin’ of larks. — Draw about fifteen good larks, cut the legs at the joint, split the flesh of the drum-stick, to put in the bone of the thigh, which must not be seen. Fry, over a brisk fire, a few chickens’ livers, with an equal quantity of lean veal ; allow them to cool, and pound them with a little piece of panada, and some chopped fat-bacon. Season the force-meat, pass it through a sieve, and add to it a few table- spoonfuls of chopped mushrooms, and a little onion ; then put a part of it into each lark, and with the remainder mask the bottom of a ‘gratin’-dish, on which dish the larks in a conical form ; pour over a preparation, composed of chopped mushrooms, onion, parsley, and bread-crumbs ; baste the larks with a paste-brush dipped in clari- fied butter, and push them into a hot oven, to bake for a quarter of an hour. When done, take them out, baste them with a little good gravy', slightly thickened, and finished with the juice of a lemon. 929. ‘Timbale’ of larks (alouettes), Florence fashion. — With twelve ounces of‘polenta’ prepare a thick batter, proceeding according to the meth- od prescribed in the chapter on vegetables ; finish with butter and parmesan, pour it into a ‘timbale’-mould, and allow it to cool completely; then take it out, empty it, leaving it about half an inch thick at the bottom and sides; wipe the mould, butter it again, sprinkle over bread-crumbs, and put the prepared ‘timbale’-crust in. In the mean time, pluck and draw twenty-four larks, cut away the legs and neck, fill the body with a small portion of raw pork-mince, finished with a few tablespoonfuls of chopped truffles; fry the larks in a stewpan, with rasped bacon, and six ounces of ham cut in middling-sized squares, then moisten them with white wine, which reduce gently to a glaze. On the other hand, fry the backs and bones with lard and a few trimmings of ham ; sprinkle over a little flour, moisten with a pint and a half of broth, and a glassCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 414 of white wine, stir the liquid until boiling, then remove the stewpan back. Twenty minutes after, take away the fat from the sauce, pass it, through a sieve, into a flat stewpan; add to it a dozen fresh and cut mushrooms, reduce this sauce, thicken it properly, and then pour it into the stewpan with the stew. Add to it two dozen small ‘quenelles’, rolled in flour and poached ; pour it into the ‘timbale’, close the opening with a round piece of‘polenta’, solder it with a little force-meat, cover the ‘timbale’ with paper, and bake it until the sides be nicely colored ; then turn it out on a dish, and serve. 930. Ortolans, Portugal fashion. — Draw two dozen ortolans, singe them, place them in a ‘sauté’-pan, with melted bacon and two bay-leaves. Season them, let them fry on a brisk fire, turning them; as soon as done, carefully drain all their fat, moisten them with a few tablespoonfuls of good vinegar, and a little melted glaze. Set the ‘sauté’-pan back now on the fire quickly, let the liquid reduce, remove the bay-leaves, and add to the ortolans a ‘salpicon’ of lean smoked ham, previously steeped in water. Pour over a little ‘espagnole’-sauce, reduced with madeira, but very little thickened. Heat the ham, but without allowing the sauce to boil ; dish the ortolans, in a group, and pour over them the sauce. Surround the ortolans with a circle of small ‘quenelles’ moulded with a spoon. 931. Ortolans, Toulouse fashion. — Ortolans abound in the south of France ; and at Toulouse especially, they have the repute of knowing how to fatten them. When wanted for cooking, they are killed by plunging the head into strong vinegar : this death by suffocation apparently improving their flesh. Pluck twelve ortolans ; draw them on the side, singe them a little, and rub them with lemon; run them through with a small iron-skewer, wrap them up with a coating, of kneaded-butter, mixed with lemon-juice ; sprinkle bread-crumb all over, and roast them at a good fire for seven or eight minutes, basting with the butter running in the dripping-pan. At the last moment, salt, take them off the fire, dish them up, basting simply with the drippings, and immediately send them up with lemons cut in halves. 932. ‘Timbale’ of ortolans, with truffles. — Remove the pouch from eighteen ortolans, cut off their wings, necks, and legs ; singe them, and pick out the gizzard, by widening slightly the lower aperture ; fill the hollow of the stomach with a little ‘salpicon’ of truffles, mixed up with fresh rasped fat-bacon, and a pinch of chopped parsley. Line a ‘timbale’-mould with fine-short paste (No. 463), which mask all over with a thick coating of raw pork-mince chopped previously very fine, and pounded with a quarter of its volume of raw truffles. This done, put the ortolans into a stewpan with a little melted fat-bacon, toss them over a brisk fire for two minutes only, just415 GAME. — FIG-PECKERS, THRUSHES. time enough to set them ; then season, and take them out. Baste with a little good glaze, and range them in the hollow of the Timbale’, covering them at once with a layer of force-meat, then with a flat of paste ; and push the Timbale’ into a hot oven to bake for one hour, but watching not to let it take too much color. On the other hand, pour into a stewpan three parts of a glass of madeira, with a handful of trimmings of raw truffles, and a bunch of aromatics ; reduce the liquid to half, with the lid on the stewpan, pass it through a sieve, and add an equal quantity of melted glaze. When done, take the Timbale’ out of the oven, make a small opening on the top, and through this pour in the extract; close the opening, and turn the Timbale’ out on a hot dish. 9153. Fig-peckers (becfigues), Provence way. — Pluck twenty-four plump fig-peckers, ortolans, or red-breasts; take out the pouch, cut away the neck and legs, singe them slightly. Get two dozen good, fresh, round and firm roussillons or mushrooms; remove their tails, wipe them well, but avoid washing them if possible; range them on a gridiron, and dry them in a moderate oven ; season afterwards with salt and pepper. On the other hand, pick, wash, and chop the best of the mushroom-tails; chop likewise an onion, put this into a stewpan, fry it with oil, add the chopped tails, and a little point of bruised garlic : when the fine-herbs have evaporated their moisture, sprinkle over a handful of fresh bread-crumbs, take them off the fire, and introduce an equal quantity of raw ham cut in small dice, and a pinch of chopped parsley ; take the preparation up with a teaspoon, and fill the hollow side of each mushroom, on which place a small bird ; moisten these with a paste-brush dipped in oil, and sprinkle over chopped parsley. Place the mushrooms thus garnished on a baking- sheet, previously basted with oil and the juice of two lemons ; push the sheet then into a hot oven, in which leave it for twelve or fifteen minutes; when taken out, baste the fig-peckers and mushrooms with a paste-brush dipped in glaze ; dish them up, and serve. • 934. Thrushes, German fashion. — Pluck twelve thrushes, take out the pouch and gizzard, thrust the head into the body, and cross the legs. Put the thrushes into a stewpan, with butter and a few pieces of streaky bacon cut in small dice ; salt a little, and fry them on a brisk fire, occasionally turning them ; when they are about done, sprinkle over a good handful of bread-crumbs, mixed up with a few juniper-berries ; push the stewpan into the oven, and leave it there, until the thrushes be quite done ; dish them up with the bacon, fat, and bread, pour two tablespoonfuls of gravy into the stewpan, let the liquid bubble up, add to it a little glaze, and pour it on the bottom of the dish.416 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 935. ‘Gratin’ of thrushes. — Bone and farce seven or eight fine thrushes (see No. 928); give them an elongated shape, wrapping the force-meat up with the skin ; surround them separately with a strip of buttered paper, place them, one by one, and side by side, in a fiat stewpan ; moisten them with a little gravy, not freed of its fat ; then cover them with paper, braise them on a moderate fire for ten or twelve minutes. Let them cool in their cooking-stock, cut them in two lengthwise, and dish each half, in a circular order, on a thick layer of cooked force-meat (see No. 764), spread thereon a flat of paste, cut to the diameter of the dish; support the circle interiorly with some force-meat, and set into the hollow a frame of bread, masked with strips of bacon ; support the circle of the thrushes exteriorly with a strip of paper, bind this paper on with thread, cover the thrushes with bacon, push the ‘gratin’ into the oven, and bake it for twenty-five minutes. When taken out of the oven, unwrap it, remove the frame, spunge the fat, and slip the ‘gratin’ on a dish; fill the hollow with a garnish of mushrooms, mask the thrushes with a little brown-sauce. 93C. ‘Crépinettes’ of thrushes (grives). — Take out the fillets of eight or ten thrushes, remove the skin, divide each fillet in two, put these pieces into a kitchen-basin, adding an equal quantity of blanched fat-bacon, cut in small fillets, and the same of raw truffles, cut likewise; season the meats highly, and baste them with a few tablespoonfuls of madeira or cognac. Put the trails of the thrushes, their livers, and a few chickens’ livers, into a frying-pan, with rasped bacon, a pinch of chopped onion, and the trimmings of truffles; boil the whole quickly, and when the livers are thoroughly done, draw the frying-pan off the fire; let the preparation cool, and pound it; put into the mortar about a pound of minced fresh pork, pound it fine, add to it the livei’s, remove it into a basin, and introduce into it the madeii-a of the marinade. Cut some squares of fresh pig’s caul, previously beaten with the handle of a knife on the thickest parts ; place a layer of foi'ce-meat on each of the squai’es, and on this distribute the fillets of thrushes, the bacon and truffles ; cover them with another layer of force-meat, shaping the ‘crépinettes’ in a flat oblong square ; sur- round the pi'epai-ation with the pig’s caul, leaving no opening ; b*oil the ‘ci-epinettes’ over a slow fire for fifteen or eighteen zninutes, dish theizi up aftei’wai'ds, pouring round theizz at the base some good gi’avy, pi’epai’ed with the bones of thrushes, and reduced to half-glaze with a paid of the trimmings of truffles. 937. Macaroni-timbale, with thrushes (grives) (D. 187). — Boil five ounces of lai’ge macaroni in salted water, keeping them whole ; drain them immediately on a cloth, keeping the cookizig-water for aftei’-use ; cut them trans-417 GAME — THRUSHES. versally into pieces, a quarter of an inch long ; then fill the hollow of the macaroni with a fillet of truffle, cut to the diameter of the hollow. With these cut pieces mask the bottom and sides of a buttered dome-mould,, placing them flat; then mask the macaroni interiorly with a layer of ‘quenelle’ force-meat. Take up the fillets of twelve thrushes ; pare them, slightly beat, let them fry with butter on a brisk fire, turning them ; add to them half a pound of raw truffles ; season them with salt and spices, toss all together for a few seconds; take the Fig. 187. stewpan off the fire ; moisten the thrushes with a few tablespoonfuls of brown-sauce, reduced with the trimmings of the truffles, and a little wine. The stew having cooled, pour it into the hollow of the ‘timbale’, the aperture of which close with raw force- meat, and let it poach in the ‘bain-marie’ for three quarters of an hour. When time to serve, wipe the mould, turn the ‘timbale’ out on a warm dish, surround it with a circle of mushroom-heads, stick on the top a ‘hatelet’-skewer, garnished with a large truffle ; serve separately a boatful of the reduced sauce. 938. Salmis of thrushes, Provence fashion. — Roast eight or ten thrushes ((/rives) without drawing them, but putting crusts of bread under them; when they are done, take them off the fire, cut away the heads and legs, divide each ' of them in two lengthwise, pare each of the pieces, which arrange in a stewpan, and keep this on the ‘bain-marie’. Pound the trimmings of the thrushes with a few of the crusts dried up in the dripping-pan, so as to convert them into paste ; which i dilute with a little thickened gravy, and some good red wine ; heat it without allow- ing it to boil, stirring ; then pass it through a sieve, and pour it over the thrushes. Pound the trails and livers of the thrushes; add a little sauce, and pass them through a sieve. When ready to serve, dish the halves of thrushes in a conical form on the remaining crusts of bread, previously pared, and set on a dish; introduce into the sauce the purée, prepared with the trails; heat it without allowing to boil, and j pour it over the thrushes. 27418 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 939. Hare with cream. — This preparation is common to Germany, Holland, Russia, Poland, and even to the north of France; but it is greatly to be regretted, it is not more generallyused. Get a good hare, skin and draw it ; slip off the shoulders, and cut off the fore-part of the hare to the beginning of the loins, trim the skin away from the fillets and thighs, to lard them with bacon; bone the thick part of the thighs, so as to bring them close together, securing with string, and running them through with a wooden skewer; place the hare in a roasting-pan, salt slightly, pour over five or six ounces of butter, push it into a hot oven, and roast it for twenty minutes, basting often with its fat; moisten then with a pint of good sour-cream, and finish cooking it, basting, always with its own liquid. When done, place the hare on a dish, pour into the roasting-pan a gill of gravy, let the stock boil, stirring with a spoon, until reduced enough to thicken, as a light sauce, but of a good taste ; pass it then over the hare. The sour-cream may be replaced by good double-cream ; if so, as soon as the hare is cooked, thicken the sauce with a little kneaded-butter, add a few tablespoon- fuls of meat-glaze, and reduce, introducing into the sauce a little good vinegar. In Germany, the hare thus prepared, is accompanied by a ‘compote’ of bilberries (preiselbeeren). 940. ‘Terrine’ of hare, with truffles. — Peel carefully seven or eight good raw truffles, cut them up in quarters, and keep them covered. Take out the meat from the shoulders and legs of a hare, trim away the sinewy parts, cut it up in pieces, which put in a frying-pan with melted rasped bacon, the liver and lungs of the hare, a pinch of chopped onion, and the peel of the truffles ; fry the meats on a brisk fire, to set them ; let them cool in the frying-pan, chop them afterwards, and put them into a mortar, with the same volume of fresh fat-bacon, and a quarter that of lean pork, both previously chopped ; pound the meats until converted into paste, season, and place them in a kitchen-basin. On the other hand, having taken out the fillets of hare, pare away the skin, cut them in middling-sized squares ; add the truffles, and season ; pour over four table- spoonfuls of cognac, and the same of madeira; let them macerate for two hours. Take a pie-dish (terrine) proportionate to the quantity of preparation, mix meats and force-meat well up, and with them fill the ‘terrine’; cover the top with bacon, then with a flat of common paste; set the ‘terrine’ on a baking-sheet, and push it into a moderate oven, to bake for an hour and a half; after which, take it out of the oven, and let it cool. When about to serve, remove the paste, wipe the ‘terrine’ well, remove the fat, covering the preparation, which cut in slices ; set the ‘terrine’ on a dish, and surround it with aspic-jelly.GAME. — HARE. 419 941. ‘Pain’ of hare, with jelly (D. 188). — Put into a mortar the fillets of a cooked hare, add to them half their volume of chickens’ livers, also cooked, and cooled; pound, and pass them through a sieve; put the purée into a stewpan, add to it a third its volume of tepid brown-‘chaufroix’-sauce, then five ounces of butter in small hits, and work it quickly, until the butter be quite melted. Fig. 188. Now pour the preparation into a cylindric dome-shaped mould, pressing it ; and set it on the ice. One hour after, dip the mould into hot water, and turn the ‘pain’ out on to a ‘pain-vert’, fixed on a dish; glaze it, cut it open on the top, fill the hollow of the cylinder with chopped aspic, and set on the top a small mould of aspic, deco- rated with truffles. Surround the ‘pain-vert’ with ‘croûtons’ of aspic-jelly.- 942. Hare, Provence fashion (D. 189). — Skin a good young and Fig. 189. fresh hare, leaving the ears adhering to the head, scald them ; draw the hare carefully, and put by the blood, liver, and heart. Cut off the four legs at the first joint, and bone the thighs. Prepare a pound of raw mince of pork; season, add to it the liver and heart, both chopped, a pinch of onion, one of parsley, and one of thyme, all of which chopped. With this preparation stuff the paunch of the hare; sew it up, then truss 27*420 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. the hare, bringing the hind-legs on each side of the paunch, and securing them with string ; thrust the fore-legs into the breast of the hare, securing them likewise with a twist of string, supporting also the head between the shoulders. Singe the meat of the fillets, and that of the hind-legs, to lard them with bacon. Run the hare through lengthwise with a thin spit, roast it for three quarters of an hour, basting with lard or butter, placing underneath it, on the dripping-pan, a few large slices of bread. When done, salt, and take it off the fire, remove the string, and place it on the slices of bread, spread out on the centre of an oblong dish. Sur- round the hare with a dozen thrushes, covered with bacon, and roasted; send up separately some chopped-sauce (sauce-hâchéè), thickened with the blood of the hare. 943. Hare-pie, Saxon way. — With a pound of flour, half a pound of butter, salt, and water, prepare some short-paste, and let it rest for one hour. Skin a tender hare, draw it ; slip off the shoulders and legs from the body, and bone them. Pare the meat, and cut it up in squares, chop it with its weight of fat fresh bacon, and six ounces of raw ham ; when the whole is well chopped, pound, season, and add to it a few tablespoonfuls of cooked fine-herbs : mushrooms, parsley, and onion. Lard the loins, cut them up in pieces, put them into a stewpan with melted bacon, and half-cook them : remove the meat from the bones, and put them by. With all the bones, and the neck of the hare, a few trimmings of ham, vegetables, aromatics, and a little wine, prepare some good gravy ; when it is passed, and skim- ' med of fat, reduce it to half-glaze with a few tablespoonfuls of madeira, and thicken it with a little sauce ; then keep it in the ‘bain-marie’. Mask the bottom of a large pie-dish, with a layer of the prepared raw mince, whereon place a layer of good sour-crout, cooked with six ounces of streaky bacon, and cooled; cut up the bacon in squares, which mix with the pieces of hare, and a few raw black truffles, cut up in slices; place the meat in a dome-like shape on the sour-crout, mask them with the remainder of the mince ; now moisten the rim of the dish, lay on it a strip of paste, moisten the paste, and cover the pie with a large thin flat of short-paste, soldering it to the strip ; trim the paste neatly all round the dish, and flute it with a knife (.see No. 596) ; ornament the top with leaves imitated in paste, leave a hole on the centre, allowing the steam to escape ; egg the pie, and bake it for an hour and a quarter in a moderate oven ; covering it with paper, as soon as the paste is of a nice color. When the pie is taken out of the oven, pour in, through the hole left on the top, the prepared sauce, and dish up. This pie is excellent, if eaten quite hot. 944. Hare-cutlets with truffles (D. 190). — Prepare some ‘pain’ of hare as prescribed in No. 491, spread it on a baking-sheet, in a smooth layer half an421 GAME. HARE. inch thick; when cold, divide it (with the aid of a model) into parts, the size and shape of a nice cutlet ; glaze them with the paste-brush, adorn them on their thick part with truffles, and cover them entirely with a thin layer of aspic-jelly. On the other hand, fix on a dish, a small entrée-stand in fat, and cast in two pieces ; adorn the friese with vine-leaves and imitated grapes of white fat. Dish up. on the centre of the stand, a group of small round truffles, dipped in half-set jelly. Fig. 190. thus fastening them together. Put a small hone and ruffle on each cutlet, and dish them up in a circle round the truffles. The stand is here nothing but an accessory ; it may be suppressed, and cutlets and truffles served directly on the dish. 945. ‘Pain’ of hare, with truffles. — Take out the meat from the legs and shoulders of a cooked hare ; pare, divide it in pieces, which fry with bacon on a brisk fire, and let cool ; pound them afterwards, add to them the same volume of raw chopped fat-bacon, and a few trimmings of raw truffles; season the force-meat highly, pass it through a sieve, and add to it a quarter its volume of cooked bacon, and the same of raw truffles, both cut up in large dice. Butter thickly a ‘timbale’-mould, fill it with the force-meat, pressing it in; cover the top with bacon, and set the mould in a ‘sauté’-pan, with water to a third its height'; push it into a moderate oven, to bake for three quarters of an hour, and let the ‘pain’ cool in the mould. One hour previous to serving, heat the mould in boiling water, and turn the 'pain’ out on the lid of a stewpan ; smooth its surfaces with the blade of a knife, glaze it with a paste-brush, slip it on a dish, coat it (le napper) with half-set jelly, and surround at its base with ‘croûtons’ and chopped aspic.422 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 946. Leveret ‘sauté’, Provence fashion. — Divide a leveret into pieces of an equal size ; which put into a flat stewpan with melted bacon, three small onions, a few sprigs of parsley, garnished with aromatics, and a clove of garlic. Set the pan on a brisk fire, fry the meat for seven or eight minutes, then remove the pan on to a moderate fire, placing hot ashes on the lid. When the pieces of meat arc nearly done, baste them with a gill of white wine, and a little glaze; let the liquid boil till about reduced, then take the pieces up with a fork. Put into the stewpan four peeled and chopped tomatas, freed of seed, and ten ounces of soaked raw ham in dice : when the tomatas have evaporated their moisture, baste them with a few tablespoonfuls of brown-sauce; take out the onions and aromatics, add a pinch of pounded pimento, and mask the pieces of hare with this sauce. 947. Hare, Bavarian fashion. — Skin a good hare, slip the fillets off the back, bone the hind-and fore-legs, cut up the meat in large squares, which lard with fillets of raw truffles, and season with salt and spices. Chop eight ounces of fresh fat-bacon, melt it in a stewpan, strain it into a small earthen-stockpot ; then arrange therein the squares of meat in layers, alternating them with a handful of streaky bacon in small dice. Sprinkle over each layer of hare and bacon a handful of rasped bread-crumb, and continue thus. Add some aroma- tics, moisten the whole to height with good Rhine-wine, close the stockpot, and solder its lid with paste ; set it on the fire ; as soon as boiling, remove the stock pot on to hot ashes, stewing the hare gently for four hours. Afterwards dish up the meats; carefully skim the fat away from the stock, and strain it over the meats. This simple preparation is not without its merit. 948. ‘Civet’ of hare. — The ‘civet’ (or stew) of hare is a national dish of France, it is generally well prepared all through the country ; but I must own having found it best in Provence ; perhaps because the hares, feeding on the aromatic plants of the mountains of this rich country, possess more flavor. This dish, in its homely simplicity, is nevertheless excellent, when prepared with care. For a ‘civet’ it is not quite necessary, that the hare be very young, it is sufficient, if it be in full flesh. Skin and draw a hare, putting carefully by the liver, lungs, and heart; gather the blood into a kitchen-basin, mix with it the juice of one lemon, or a little vinegar, thus keeping it liquid ; divide the hare in middling-sized pieces, which season with salt and pepper. Chop half a pound of fresh bacon, melt it in a stewpan ; when hot, add to it the pieces of hare, and a large onion studded with cloves, a few pepper- corns, and a few sprigs of aromatics composed of thyme, bay-leaf, and wild thyme.GAME. — HARE. 423 Fry the meat over a brisk tire; when its moisture is reduced, add to it about a pound of streaky bacon, previously blanched, and cut up in large squares; then, a few minutes after, moisten the whole with a bottle of red Avine ; cover the stewpan, and reduce the liquid to three fourths. Sprinkle over the meats three tablespoonfuls of flour, moisten to height with hot broth, add a handful of trimmings of fresh mush- rooms; and stir the sauce until boiling: the sauce should be then plentiful, and not very thick. Cover the stewpan, and live minutes after, draw it over a moderate tire, with hot ashes on the lid. Boil the stew thus for two or three hours, according to the degree of tenderness of the hare, being careful to probe the meat from time to time. When the hare is done, skim the fat away from the sauce, take up the pieces one by one with the aid of a fork, and arrange them evenly in another stewpan ; take up also the bacon with a skimmer, and place it with the pieces of meat. Add to the sauce a little white wine, or some gravy ; pass it through a sieve, and reduce it over a brisk tire, thus giving it proper consistence ; thicken it then with the blood, let it boil up, and pour it over the meats ; let the ‘civet’ simmer for a few minutes (without ebullition), dish it up, and garnish it Avith three or four dozen small glazed onions. 949. Hunters’ civet. -— Cut up in pieces the back, loins, and liind-legs, of a hare, proceeding as in the former article ; let it marinate for two or three hours. With six ounces of butter, and six of flour, prepare a light brown ‘roux’ ; then add to it the pieces of hare, previously drained and wiped ; fry them over a brisk lire, turning; when of a nice color, moisten to height Avith red and Avhite Avine, half of each ; add to it the liquid of the marinade, the aromatics and onion ; let the sauce boil for rive or six minutes, and draw the steAvpan over a very slow tire, Avith hot ashes on its lid. On the other hand, chop two large onions, put them into a frying-pan with rive ounces of lard, fry them on a moderate fire, allowing them to take a little color ; then add to it the liver, lungs, and heart, previously minced ; season with salt and a point of cayenne pepper ; toss them on the fire, until well done. Moisten with a few spoon- fuls of madeira, reduce the Avine on a slow tire, thus cooking the onions at the same time ; afterwards thicken the preparation with two tablespoonfuls of sauce, and pour it into a mortar to pound it, after which pass it through a sieve ; let it cool, and rill Avith it a dozen round bread-’croûtons’, fried and emptied. Glaze the preparation with a paste-brush, and keep the ‘croûtons’ hot. A quarter of an hour previous to serving, that is, the ‘civet’ nearly done ; skim off the fat, then take up each piece of hare with a fork, and arrange them evenly in a steAvpan ; slightly dilute the sauce, and pass it through a sieve, over the pieces of424 COSMOPOI AT AN C OOKERY. hare; to which add two dozen fresh and clean mushrooms; cover the stewpan, set it on a moderate tire, and finish cooking the stew, till time to serve. Then dish it up: the sauce should not be too thin, or plentiful. Arrange the farced ‘croutons’ round the stew, over which pour a few tablespoonfuls of good rum, warmed in a sugar-pan, and set on fire. This operation should be done in the dining-room, so that the dish may come to table in a flame. 950. ‘Pain’ of hare, poivrade-sauce. — Take out the meat from the shoulder and legs of a hare, trim away the sinew and the hard parts, cut the meat into small squares, and mix them with half their volume of fat-bacon, also in squares. Chop an onion, put it into a frying-pan with a little rasped fat-bacon, a bay- leaf, a few sprigs of aromatics, and at last, the meats in squares; season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, toss the whole on a brisk fire, until the meats be well set ; add to it half a hare’s liver in slices, which fry a few .minutes, and pour into the frying-pan a quarter of a glass of white wine ; reduce the liquid quickly to glaze, and draw the pan off the fire ; remove the bay-leaf and aromatics, let the preparation cool, then pound it ; when it is converted into paste, take it out, put it into a kitchen- basin ; pound a third its volume of panada, and add it gradually to the pounded meats. When well mixed up, add to the preparation four or five yolks of eggs, one after the other; pass it through a sieve, put it into a basin, and work it for two minutes with a spoon, to smooth it ; then try a small part of it in a mould in the oven, to rectify, if necessary. Butter a plain cylindric mould, fill it with the preparation, mask the top with bacon, and set the mould in a stewpan, with boiling water to half its height ; poach the force-meat in the ‘bain-marie’ for three quarters of an hour. Then take the mould out, wipe it, turn the ‘pain’ out on its dish, and mask it with good ‘poivrade’- sauce, prepared with the bones and trimmings of the hare. 951. Sicilian hare-fillets. — Pare a dozen hare-fillets of the shape of a large chicken-fillet; season them, let them marinate in a kitchen-basin, witli a little vinegar, for several hours. A few minutes previous to serving, drain the fillets on a cloth, place them in a ‘sauté’-pan with clarified butter, and thus let them fry on a brisk fire, being careful not to let them dry. Drain the butter, then pour over the fillets a little dissolved meat-glaze ; dish them in a circular order, alternating each of the fillets with a ‘croûton’ of bread, fried in butter ; mask them with the following-sauce : Sicilian-sauce. — Put into a small saucepan two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar ; melt this sugar, stirring it with a wooden spoon ; when it is of a light-brownHAKE, LEVERET, &c. 425 GAME. color, moisten it with the value of half a glass of good vinegar ; reduce the vinegar till the sugar is dissolved, and the liquid diminished one half; then mix with it double its volume of brown-sauce; make it boil for several minutes, then mix with it a handful of dried Smyrna raisins, or else currants, softened in warm water, as well as a small handful of ‘pignoli’ slightly roasted : these ‘pignoli’ may be replaced by chopped and dried almonds. 952. Fillets of hare, ‘sautés’, German fashion. Take out the two fillets of a hare; pare, season, and place them, one beside the other, in a flat stewpan with clarified butter. With the bones and trimmings of the hare, prepare a little gravy ; which, when passed, and freed of fat, pour into a stewpan, with four table- spoonfuls of vinegar, and a bunch of aromatics; reduce the liquid to half-glaze, thus obtaining a light sauce; add two tablespoonfuls of red-currant jelly, and apiece of lemon-zest ; five minutes after, add to it a handful of currants, soaked in warm water ; boil it a few minutes longer, and draw the pan oft’ the tire. When ready to serve, poach the fillets, by placing the Hat stewpan on a moderate oven for a few minutes ; drain, divide them slantwise in thick slices; which dish up in a circular order, and mask them with the sauce. 953. ‘Timbale’ Of leveret. — Cut up a young leveret (levraut) in mid- dling-sized pieces, which put into a stewpan with melted bacon, two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion, and eight ounces of streaky bacon, blanched and cut up in squares; fry the meats on a good fire, season with salt and spices ; when set, add to them about fifteen large fresh mushrooms, each of them divided into four parts; moisten with a glass of white wine; cover the stewpan, reduce the moisture quickly, and let the preparation cool. Meanwhile, butter a plain ‘timbale’-mould, sprinkle over the bottom, and all round, a handful of ‘nouilles’ freshly shred. Line then the mould with short-paste, which keep thin ; mask afterwards the inside all over with a thin layer of raw mince, prepared with an equal quantity of lean pork and fresh fat-bacon {see No. 686); fill the cavity with the leveret meats, which mask with a layer of raw mince, and cover it with a round of paste ; which solder to that of the sides. Set the ‘timbale’ on a small baking-sheet, and push it into a moderate oven, to bake for one hour. When done, turn it out on its dish, open it on the top, and pour in a little brown-sauce, reduced with the trimmings of mushrooms, and mixed-up with a few poached ‘quenelles’ of veal. 954. Polish ‘bigos’. — Cook two pounds of good sour-erout (see No. 686); drain, and dish it by layers in an earthen-stewpan, intermingling each layer with426 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. cooked meats in pieces ; such as, roebuck, mutton, chicken, duck, ham, sausages, and bacon ; baste the meats with a little good gravy, cover the stewpan, and keep it in the oven for half an hour. This is a favorite dish of the Poles and Russ, when going hunting, or travelling. 955. Russian rissoles. — Cut np in small dice a piece of roasted fillet of roebuck, and two truffles; put this 'salpicon into a stewpan, and thicken it slightly with thick reduced brown-sauce. Take up double the volume of the 'sal- picon’ of good cooked sour-crout well pressed; chop it, mix the 'salpicon’ with it, and let the preparation cool. Spread on a floured table a large flat of 'culibiac’ paste, a little firm; with which, and the preparation of sour-crout, prepare some rissoles (see No. 820), a little larger than usual ; place them evenly on a baking-sheet at little distances, and let the paste rise at the temperature of the kitchen. Egg the 'rissoles’, and bake them in a hot oven ; when done, dish them up on a napkin. 956. Rabbits broiled, English fashion. — Take the back and loins of three small field - rabbits ; season, put them into a flat stewpan with butter, and fry them simply to set the meat; then drain immediately, roll them in beaten eggs, bread-crumb, and dip them in clarified butter, to broil them on both sides; dish them up with good gravy on the bottom of the diish. 957. Timbale Milanese (D. 191). — This dish is now-a-days much in vogue in Paris ; and if well prepared, is both excellent and distinguished. Butter a 'timbale’-mould, adorn it at the bottom, and all round, with 'nouille- paste slightly sugared ; line it with short-paste, prepared in the proportions of half a pound of butter to a pound of flour. The decoration is optional, and depends on taste. Chop very fine eight ounces of raw and trimmed hare or partridge meat ; add half its volume of fat-liver or pullet’s livers, simply fried on a brisk fire; the same amount of raw truffles, and panada the size of a walnut; season the force-meat, thicken it with the yolk of an egg ; wrap it up in a piece of pig’s caul, or in buttered paper, giving it the thickness of a sausage ; place it in a small buttered 'sauté’- pan, thus cooking it in a moderate oven, turning; leave it till nearly cool, and cut it in slices not too thin. On the other hand, peel two or three large truffles, cut them up in thickish slices, baste them with a little madeira ; which let boil, merely to heat the truffles. With the bones and trimmings of game, prepare some good gravy ; when passed, thicken it slightly, and add to it a quarter its volume of tomata-sauce ; then add moreover the trimmings and stock of the truffles; aromatics, and a piece of427 GAME. — RABBITS. raw ham. Clarify it on the side of the fire for half an hour, then pass it through a sieve. Boil in salted water a pound and a quarter of good large macaroni ; drain, and cut them in pieces two inches long ; which put into a stewpan, and pour over a part of the sauce, in which let them simmer for a quarter of an hour, thus reducing all the moisture: then take it off the fire, introduce into it five ounces of butter in small bits, and a handful of grated parmesan: season, and let it nearly cool; arrange Fig. 191. them by layers, in the cavity of the Timbale’, alternated with the slices of truffles, and the prepared force-meat. Close the Timbale’ with a round of paste, and bake it in a good oven, for three quarters of an hour ; when done, turn it out on a dish, open it on the top, and pour in the remainder of the sauce. To render this dish more luxurious, the force-meat of game may be replaced by slices of cooked fat-liver. 958. ‘Gibelotte’ of field-rabbits. — The ‘gibelotte’ (a sort of fricassée) is a popular dish of France, and specially of Paris, where it is generally very well prepared. Skin and draw two field-rabbits, cut them up into middling-sized pieces, which put into a kitchen-basin, with aromatics and two small onions; baste them with two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, and let them macerate for two hours ; drain them after- wards on a cloth, wipe, and place them in a stewpan with melted fat-bacon, or with lard ; fry them quickly, season them with salt and pepper ; when their moisture is evaporated, and they are of a nice color, sprinkle over a small handful of flour; moisten to height with white wine, stir the stew till boiling (the sauce should be a little thick) ; let it boil quickly for seven or eight minutes ; add six ounces of streaky bacon in squares, and a bunch of aromatics ; remove the stewpan on to the side of the fire, cover it, and continue cooking the meats : when they are nearly done, add to them about fifteen raw mushrooms.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 428 Ten minutes afterwards, add two dozen small glazed onions, sprinkle over the vegetables a little pepper, and dish the ‘gibelotte’, after having removed the aromatics. 959. Young rabbits (lapereaux), fried. — Divide into middling-sized pieces the hind-legs, and the back, of two young rabbits; put them into a kitchen- basin, season with salt and a pinch of cayenne, add a minced onion, some parsley- leaves, and the juice of one lemon; let the meat macerate for two hours; drain them afterwards on a cloth, flour, dip them in beaten eggs and bread-crumbs. When about to serve, plunge them into hot hog’s lard, taking care to fry separately the pieces of the back, and those of the legs, as the latter require longer cooking ; drain them, as soon as done, dish them up on a folded napkin, and send at the same time a boatful of piquant-sauce. 960. Young rabbit (lapereaux) cutlets, bread-crumbed. — Bone eight hind-legs of young rabbits, without opening them, but preserving the thin end-bone; season inwardly, stuff them with a little raw mince, prepared with lean veal, bacon, ham, and tine-herbs ; sew them with stout thread to the shape of a small ham; season, and arrange them in a flat stewpan with butter, braising them gently on both sides ; let them cool under press, pare them after into the shapes of cutlets; dip them in beaten eggs, bread-crumb, and set them in a flat stewpan, allowing them to take color on both sides; dish them up afterwards in a circular order, put a ruffle on each cutlet, and mask them either with ‘Colbert’ or ‘piquant- sauce. 961. Young rabbits (lapereaux) ‘sautés’, with tomatas. — Skin and draw two young rabbits, and cut them up in pieces. Melt in a frving-pan six ounces of chopped bacon, add to it the pieces of rabbits, fry them over a brisk tire for a few minutes, season with salt and pepper, and mix with them six ounces of lean bacon in large dice, and à chopped onion; toss them on thé tire for ten minutes longer, and pour them into a flat stewpan ; add to them four or tive fleshy tomatas, freed of pips, and cut up in pieces; a bunch of parsley, and a clove of garlic; cover the stewpan, set it on a moderate tire, with hot ashes on the lid; and finish cooking the rabbits gently. At the last moment, baste them with a little melted meat-glaze, sprinkle over a pinch of chopped parsley, remove the aro- matics, and dish up. 962. ‘Boudins’ of rabbits, with green-pease (D. 192). — With a pound of fillets of rabbits, prepare some ‘quenelle’ force-meat, in the same proportions as that of pheasant, No. 831. When passed through a sieve, introduce into it tour429 ROEBUCK. GAME. tablespoonfuls of cooked fine-herbs ; then wrap it up in a sheet of buttered paper, shaping the piece of force-meat to an oblong form ; fasten the paper, and plunge it into boiling water. Two seconds after, remove the stewpan back, thus poaching the force-meat for ten or twelve minutes, without allowing it to boil. This method of poaching the force-meat for ‘boudins’ is a very practical one. Fig. 192. When the force-meat is cold, take it out of the paper, and divide it transversally in slices; dip them in beaten eggs, bread-crumb, and color them, on both sides, with clarified butter. Dish up in a circle, fill the centre with a garnish of green-pease boiled in salted water, and thicken with a little white-sauce and a piece of fine butter. 9G3. Haunch of roebuck, glazed (D. 193). — Pare a haunch of young- roebuck (chevreuil), removing the outer skin; season, put it into a kitchen-basin, baste it with two glasses of madeira; add a few aromatics, and let it macerate for five Fig. 193. or six hours ; then drain it, lard it on the top with bacon, place it in a stewpan, pre- pared for a braise ; moisten with the wine, in which it has macerated, and double of broth; braise it, short of moisture, on a moderate fire, with hot ashes on the lid, basting often. On tbe other hand, prepare, with meat from a shoulder of roebuck, some ‘que- nelle’ force-meat ; of the force-meat mould, with a spoon, some middling-sized ‘que- nelles’, and poach them in salted water. When ready to serve, place the haunch on an oblong disli, put a ruffle to it, and dish the ‘quenelles’ all round, overlapped, leavingC OSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 430 on the centre of both sides, an empty space, in which dish up a group of turned and blanched olives. Glaze the roebuck with a paste-brush, pour over the garnishes a little brown-sauce, reduced with the stock of the roebuck; send up separately a boatful of the same sauce. 9G4. Field-rabbit with curry. — Cut up in pieces the hind-legs, and the back and loins, of two or three rabbits ; put them into a stewpan, with butter and six ounces of streaky bacon in large dice ; fry them on a moderate fire, without allowing them to take much color; salt, sprinkle them over with flour, and as much of curry- powder ; fry them for a few seconds longer, moisten with broth (off the fire), put the stewpan back on the fire, and stir the liquid until boiling. Five minutes after, remove the stewpan on a moderate fire, to finish cooking the rabbits. Ten minutes before serving, place the pieces of rabbit in another stewpan, and pass the sauce over ; add then to the stew two large onions in dice, seasoned and colored with butter in a frying-pan. When ready to serve, thicken the sauce with two yolks of eggs diluted with cream ; cook the liaison without letting the sauce boil, then dish the meat up, and send up separately some rice, boiled Indian way. 965. Hunter’s ‘timbale’ of rabbit. — Cut up two rabbits in pieces, which place in a kitchen-basin, season well with salt, pepper, and pounded aromatics. Chop very fine ten ounces of fat-bacon. Chop two onions, fry them with lard, add a few handfuls of chopped mushrooms; when their moisture is reduced, add a pinch of chopped parsley, and five ounces of raw ham in small dice, now add the fine- herbs to the chopped bacon, and introduce into the preparation a few tablespoonfuls of cognac or madeira. Line a ‘timbale’-mould with short-paste, spread the bottom and sides with a coating of the preparation, and arrange the pieces of rabbit in the cavity, alternating with the raw mince, previously prepared. Close the ‘timbale’ with a round of paste, bake it in a moderate oven, for one hour and a quarter ; when taken out of the oven, make a small opening on the top, and pour into the ‘timbale’ a few tablespoonfuls of gravy, mixed up with a little glaze and madeira. Turn the ‘timbale’ out on a dish. 966. ‘Crépinettes’ Of roebuck. — Trim carefully five or six minion- fillets of roebuck (about a pound and a quarter) ; divide the meat into middling-sized squares , which put into a kitchen-basin, with half their volume of raw truffles in small dice ; season with salt and spices, baste them with a little madeira, and let them macerate for one hour. Prepare a raw mince of fresh pork, with half of lean and half of fat ; add to it a few cooked and pounded poultry-livers, and two chopped raw truffles; season highly, add to it the meat in the basin ; divide the preparation into equal parts, the size of an egg, shaping them in a flat oblong form ; wrap each of them up in a piece of431 GAME. — BUCK, VENISON. fresh pig’s caul, flatten it slightly. Butter the ‘crépinettes’ with a paste-brush, bread- crumb, and broil them on a moderate fire for a quarter of an hour, turning them: then dish up, and pour on the bottom of the dish a little good reduced gravy. 9G7. Saddle (‘cimier’) of buck, Polish fashion (D. 194). — Pare the saddle, or haunch, of a buck not fattened, put it into fitting vessel, and pour over one or two quarts of cooked marinade - stock. * Leave it therein for four hours, turning from time to time; drain it, lard the fillets with bacon, lay it in an oblong Fig. 194. stewpan spread for braise, moisten half its height with broth, and a part of its mari- nade. Braise it on a moderate fire, with hot ashes on the lid, frequently basting. When ready to serve, dish up the saddle; surround it on both sides, with a group of round truffles, and two groups of stuffed mushrooms ; place at each end a garnish of sour-crout. Glaze the saddle with a paste-brush dipped in a little brown-sauce, prepared with the stock, and send up the remander in a sauceboat. 9G8. ‘Epigramme’ of roebuck, with truffles. — Pare six roebuck- cutlets,, put them into a raw marinade, then place them in a stewpan with oil, and keep one side covered. With their trimmings, and a few pieces of lean veal, prepare some ‘quenelle’ force-meat ; add to it two or three tablespoonfuls of raw trulfles in small dice: take up of the same six tablespoonfuls, and put them on a floured table; roll then with the hand, forming six ‘boudins’, of the same shape and size as the cutlets; poach them in boiling water ; as soon as set, drain, let them cool, dip them in beaten eggs, and bread-crumb them. Peel five or six middling-sized truffles, cut them up in slices, and put them into a stewpan, with a little madeira-wine. With the bones and trimmings of game, a little wine, broth, aromatics, cloves and peppercorns, prepare a little extract (fumet) of game, and make a little sauce with it. . * To prepare a cooked marinade, first of all, some chopped roots and vegetables must be fried with butter : these are moistened with common vinegar, in quantity sufficient nearly to cover the meats intended to be marinated. When the vegetables are well saturated, mix with the liquid a little salt, cloves, peppercorns, and other spices. The marinade should continue cooking at least twenty-five minutes. Some- times a little water is mixed with the vinegar, in order to mitigate its pungency I432 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. When ready to serve, fry the cutlets. Meanwhile, color with claritied butter, in a flat stewpan, the six bread-crumbed ‘boudins’. When the cutlets are done, drain them. Put the peel of the truffles into the stewpan, with two gills of sauce and a little madeira ; let it boil up, and reduce the sauce till of pretty good substance; reduce quickly the moisture of the trulfles on a brisk fire; and pass the sauce, through a sieve, over them, allowing it to boil for a few seconds. Dish up the cutlets in a circular order, alternating with a ‘bondin’ of force-meat (the pointed end uppermost), put a ruffle on each bone of the cutlets, and one on the pointed end of each ‘boudin’; fill the centre with the garnish of the truffles. 969. Saddle (‘cimier’) of buck, with sour-cream. — Pare a saddle of buck, cut the rib-bones short, and if the loins are not covered with fat, remove the skin off; in the contrary case, put the saddle simply into a fitting vessel; salt, and pour over about three pints of cooked marinade (No. 968) ; cover it with a cloth, keep it in a cool place, and let it macerate for twenty-four hours, turning it. Four hours previously to serving, drain the saddle, wipe it on a cloth, place it in a roasting-pan with butter, salt slightly, cover it with buttered paper, and push it into a moderate oven, thus to roast for an hour and a half, basting often ; then pour into the roasting-pan two gills of marinade, and the same of sour-cream, baste the saddle often with this stock ; when it is done, dish it up ; pour a little gravy into the roasting-pan containing the cooking-stock, let it boil up, then pass, reduce it till of the consistency of a light sauce, and pour it over the saddle. 970. Haunch Of venison, English fashion.— Venison requires keep- ing longer than any other meat, before it is fit for cooking. Let it hang up in the air tp dry for several days, not neglecting to sprinkle a little pepper over the cut parts. At the time of cooking, let the haunch be slightly washed, wipe it on a cloth, salt, cover it entirely with buttered paper, and wrap it round with a large flat of water- paste, about half an inch thick; solder carefully the junctures, and support the paste, surrounding it also with buttered paper; which secure with string; place then the quarter in a cradle-spit, roast it for three hours ; if very large, it will take a quarter of an hour longer ; baste frequently. When done, take it off the fire, remove the paste and paper, salt, and set it on a hot-water dish. Prick the haunch towards the end with the point of the knife, thus letting the juice of the meat run out; let the venison be accompanied by a boatful of red-currant jelly, and a dish of white beans, drained at the moment, and mixed up with a little butter. 971. Minion-fillets of deer, Portuguese-sauce. — Pare two fresh minion-fillets of deer, remove the sinewy skin away, and let them macerate for five or six hours, in a little cooked marinade (see. No. 968). Drain them afterwards, lard433 GAME. — DEER. with bacon, arrange them one beside the other in a small buttered baking-sheet, sprinkle over salt, cover with a piece of buttered paper, and bake them in a moderate oven, for half an hour. When done (without being dry), take them out, cut them in slices, a little slanting, dish up on a small oblong dish, and mask them with the following sauce : PortiKjuese-sauce. — Pour a glass of wine into a stewpan ; reduce it to half, add to it the same volume of good gravy, four tablespoonfuls of lemon-zest, and of seville- oranges, minced to ‘julienne’, and boiled in water; let the liquid boil, and thicken it slightly with diluted potato-flour; reduce the sauce for a few minutes, add to it a handful of currants, washed in tepid water, and two tablespoonfuls of almonds, previously shred in fillets, and dried in the oven ; add also a pinch of red Spanish pepper, and a little pomegranate-zest; take the sauce off the fire, and finish it with the juice of two seville-oi’anges. 972. ‘Fricandeau’ of deer. — Pare a ‘noix’ (cushion-piece) of a leg of deer; split it horizontally on the centre, without, however, dividing the two parts ; moisten the meat on the side cut up, and beat slightly with a cutlet-bat, thus making it thinner; lard the ‘fricandeau’ entirely with bacon, put it into a kitchen-basin, pour over about half a pint of cold cooked marinade (see No. 9G7) ; let it macerate for a few hours, then drain, and place it in a stewpan spread with trimmings of bacon, ham, minced vegetables, aromatics, cloves and peppercorns; moisten to height with broth and white wine ; let it boil for a few minutes, and remove the stewpan | on a moderate fire, with hot ashes on the lid, to finish cooking the meat gently; pouring at times a little more broth in, and basting frequently. When the ‘fricandeau’ is about done, add to it four cooked and divided sausages, then about fifteen chestnuts slightly broiled, and peeled ; cover the stewpan, continue cooking. Twenty minutes after, dish up the ‘fricandeau’ with two dozen carrots, and ias many small onions, glazed separately. Dilute the cooking-stock with a little gravy, and half a glass of madeira ; let it boil, pass it through a sieve, skim off the fat, reduce to half-glaze, and thicken it with a little brown-sauce ; the sauce must be flight. Reduce it, for a few minutes more, over,a brisk fire, and pour it over the gar- nishes and meat. 973. Saddle of deer, German fashion. — Trim square the saddle (cimier) of a young deer, shorten the rib-bones, remove the skin of the loins, sprinkle a little salt over the meat, and put it into a kitchen-basin ; pour over a quart of cooked marinade (see No. 9G7), half-cold; let it macerate for twenty-four hours, then drain it, and lard the two fillets all over xvith bacon. Spread a braising-pan with trimmings of fat and vegetables, set the saddle thereon, moisten with its marinade, and half a bottle of red wine, place the braising-pan on a brisk fire, starting the liquid quicklyCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 434 to ebullition ; ten minutes after, remove the pan back, place hot ashes on its lid, baste the saddle from time to time, and braise it for two hours. As soon as done, take it off the fire, and let it half-cool, then drain, in order to slip off the fillets ; which cut in slices, put them back into place, egg the top of them with a layer of crumbs of black-bread (pumpernickel') half an inch thick, or with plain brown bread-crumbs, seasoned with a little sugar and cinnamon, moistened with red wine. This layer should be kept firm : sprinkle over dry bread-crumbs, and baste with butter, lay the saddle on a baking-sheet with a little stock-remains ; push it into a moderate oven, to warm the meats for half an hour , basting the layer from time to time with butter ; then dish the saddle up, and send up separately some cherry-sauce (No. 9<31). 974. Head (hûre) of young wild-boar, Berlin-sauce (D. 195). — Young wild-boars may be considered as ‘grice’ (marcassins), till the age of eighteen months ; but it is at the age of from ten to fifteen months, that the flesh of this animal is best fitted for eating, being then fat and tender. Cut the head, leaving the neck rather long (to the height of the shoulders), the muscular parts of the neck being precisely those most esteemed by amateurs : besides these parts, there is little else but the cheeks, generally not large, yet •very delicate. When the head is cut, scald it as pigs are scalded, to remove the hairs; or else singe it on a coal-fire, having sprinkled it with pounded resin. In Germany the blacksmiths are generally charged with this operation. When the head is singed, soak it for one hour, then drain it, split the skin of the skull up to the top of the forehead as far as the eyes, and right in the centre, to prevent the cracking of the skin. Disengage the meat of the snout, saw part of the bone off it transversally to a length of two inches, then wrap the head in a cloth ; securing with string, but being careful to tie the ears in an upright position ; or else they may be cut off, and cooked separately. Spread the bottom of an oblong stew- pan with carrots, onion, and celery-root, chopped, but not too small ; set the head thereon, moisten to height with half water and half vinegar; add to it salt, cloves, peppercorns, thyme, bay-leaf, marjoram, coriander, and juniper ; let the liquid boil on a moderate fire for three hours, if the animal is quite young: in any case, ob- serve, the head must be well done, as in cooling the muscular meat has a tendency to harden. As soon as the head is sufficiently tender, let it cool, off the fire, in its stock; after that unpack it, pare the neck square, glaze the skin all over with lard, colored with very dark caramel ; cover the cut parts of the skin on the skull with a piece ot butter, which ornament with truffle, cooked white of egg, and jelly ; set in each side of the snout, a tusk made in butter. Place the head then on an oval ‘pain-vert’,435 GAME. - WILD-BOAR, BEAR. masked with white fat ; surround it, at its base, with a wreath of oak- or orange- leaves; garnish the bottom of the ‘pain-vert’ with ‘croûtons’ of aspic-jelly. This piece is dished up, to figure on the table. To serve, the head must be cut up, the neck in thin slices; let it be garnished with jelly, and handed round to the guests with the following sauce : Fig. 195. Berlin-sauce. — With three yolks of eggs, and a pint of salad-oil, prepare some I mayonnaise-sauce, proceeding as directed in No. 284 ; finish it with two or three tablespoonfuls of English mustard, and good vinegar ; then introduce into it a little more than its volume of very firm red-currant jelly in small dice ; mix the jelly without crushing it, and pour the sauce into a sauce-boat. This sauce it not over fine to look at, but certain to be much valued by ‘gourmets’. 975. Young boar (marcassin) cutlets, Roman fashion. — Cut slantwise twelve small young boar-cutlets, remove the sinewy skin, disengage the end of the ribs, let them macerate for twenty-four hours in a cooked marinade. Now drain them, spunge, and put them into a ‘sauté’-pan, with butter and oil; fry them quickly, turning them ; as soon as set, drain their fat, pour over them a little meat- glaze, reduce their moisture, drain them, and dish them in a circular order. Pour into the cavity some sweet-sauce (No. 951), a sauceboatful of which send up separately. 976. Bears’ paws, Russ fashion. — In Russia bears’ paws are sold \ ready skinned, as commonly, perhaps, as pigs’ feet elsewhere. Although this is a dish little known in central Europe, yet it may be appetising for the people of the West. Wash the bears’ paws, wipe, salt, and put them into a kitchen-basin; cover them with cooked marinade, and thus let them macerate for two or three days. 28*COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 436 Spread a stewpan with trimmings of bacon and ham, and sliced vegetables ; place the paws thereon, moisten (covered) with (half and half) their marinade and broth ; cover them with thin layers of bacon, and boil them for seven or eight hours on a slow tire, adding more broth, as the stock reduces. The paws being tender, leave them in their stock till nearly cold; drain, wipe, and divide each of them in four pieces lengthwise; sprinkle over cayenne-pepper, roll them in melted lard, bread-crumb, and broil them for half an hour on a very slow fire; then dish up. Pour on the bottom of the dish, some ‘piquant’-sauce finished with two tablespoonfuls of red-currant jelly. \ 977. Boar ‘galantine’, bigarrade-sauce. — Take a little head (hurt) of boar, singe, and bone it; put the meat into a stewpan, moisten it to height with vinegar and water; add a little salt, some aromatics, peppercorns, and coriander. Let the liquid boil, then remove it on to the side of the fire, so as to continue a moderate ebullition. The head done, drain it, divide it into parts, spread these parts on a baking- sheet, and season them with salt and spices. Cut the tongue and ears into fillets, spread them on both halves of the head, and then wrap these halves up separately in two cloths, like poultry ‘galantines’; bind the cloths with thread; let the half-heads cool with a light weight on. The ‘galantines’ having well cooled, unwrap them, remove from them the swarths ; divide them in slices, not too thick ; dish them in a circular order, surround with jelly. Serve separately the following sauce : Cold higarrade - sauct. — Put into a kitchen-basin six tablespoonfuls of currant- jelly, dilute with two tablespoonfuls of red wine, add to it the juice of two ‘bigar- rades’ (bitter oranges), as well as part of their zest, previously minced, and boiled in water. 978. Wild-boar’s head, Russ fashion. — Get a head of wild-boar cut with the neck as long as possible; when cleansed, bone it, splitting it underneath; leave it in salt for four days, together with a piece of breast, and a piece of shoulder of wild-boar; after which drain the meats, steep them in cold water; put them into a marinade, with vegetables, aromatics, and red wine, to soak for three days. * Drain the head, and the other pieces, which bone, and cut up in fillets, as .well as the interior meat of the head ; add half their volume of fresh bacon, also in fillets; season, with pounded aromatics and cooked fine-herbs, and stuff the head with it; sew it up, close the opening of the neck with a large piece of fresh pork-rind, apply against it a round of wood of the same size, thus keeping the meat within the head from falling out ; then tie the head with string, to give it the right form, and wrap it up tightly with a cloth, keeping the ears upright; surround it with three thin boards,ROEBUCK. GAME. 437 one underneath and two on the sides; tie these boards, so as to keep the head quite straight while cooking; place it in a braising-pan, moisten largely with vinegar and water, add vegetables and aromatics, let it boil for live hours ; probe it previous to taking out, drain it on a dish, take it out of the cloth, in which wrap it up again to cool, placing it well upright ; when cool unpack it, pare, glaze, and dish it up ; sur- round it with aspic-jelly, prepared with a part of its stock and calf’s foot-jelly, or with ‘gelatine’. Send up separately a sauceboatful of red-currant jelly, mixed up with English mustard, a little vinegar, and a tablespoonful of chopped and blanched shalôts. 979. Roebuck-cutlets, with chestnut-purée (D. 196). — Cut up a dozen line roebuck-cutlets, beat them with a cutlet-bat, pare them neatly, and lard Fig. 1U6. them, all on the same side, with line-cut bacon ; season, and put them, one beside the other, into a flat stewpan, spread with trimmings of bacon and minced vegetables; moisten to height with broth and toppings, let the liquid boil up, reduce it to half, and remove the pan on a moderate lire, with hot ashes on the lid. When the cutlets are done, glaze them with a paste-brush. On the other hand, prepare a ‘croustade’ of rice, cut out cold, in a low form, and in the order shown by the drawing. Keep it covered till serving-time, then fix it on the centre of a dish, and dish the cutlets on the top, in a circular order, the bone downwards. Fill the centre with a good purée of chestnuts, baste it with a little melted glaze, and send up separately a boatful ol madeira-sauce. This entrée is certainly very elegant, by which I do not mean, that it should always be served in this grand style. The cutlets may be served very well directly on the dish.438 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 980. Wild-boar, with sour-sweet sauce, Roman fashion. — This is a dish partaken of all over Italy, but especially at Rome ; where it is prepared excellently by the cooks of that country. Choose a piece of young wild-boar, cut off from the saddle, or the haunch; remove from it the swartli, put the meat into a kitchen-basin, moisten it nearly to height with cooked marinade (see No. 9G7), highly spiced and seasoned; leave it thus to macerate for two days. Drain the meat, spunge it well, place it in a stewpan with hog’s lard, let it fry on a moderate lire, giving a nice color to all its surfaces ; then sprinkle over two table- spoonfuls of powder-sugar ; two minutes after, moisten the meat with the marinade kept by, and passed through a sieve; let the liquid boil on a moderate tire, till the meat is three-parts cooked; at this moment drain the piece of wild-boar, place it in another stewpan, and keep it warm. Immediately pass the cooking-stock through a sieve, in order to skim its fat carefully.

Boil this sauce on the side of the tire for ten minutes, pour it into the stewpan containing the wild-boar, passing it through a sieve ; add to it a handful of roasted ‘pignoli’; finish cooking the boar in this sauce on a very moderate tire, repeatedly basting it with the sauce. Ten minutes previous to serving it, mix in the sauce a handful of currants, the same of Smyrna raisins, well plucked and washed in tepid water. Keep up a mode- rate ebullition till the moment of serving ; then dish the piece of wild-boar, surround- irig it with the sauce and garnishes. 981.

In plain dinners, ‘entremets’ of vegetables are not always served, especially when the removes and entrees are garnished ; but in choice din- ners they are obligatory. Paste-‘entremets’ (farinages) possess the double advantage, that, ac- companying a garnish, they may, in plain dinners, take the place of entrees. 982. ‘Surtout’ of polenta, Milan fashion. — Boil three pints of water, with a little salt in ; remove it back to the side of the fire, introduce into it ; fourteen or fifteen ounces of fresh odoriferous yellow corn semolina (semoule de mais), which let drop like rain into the liquid ; boil the liquid until thickened, then i introduce into it a piece of butter, whereon pour it into a buttered ‘timbale’-mould. ! Cover the preparation on the top with a buttered paper, and let it cool for four or five hours. The preparation having got firm, dip the mould into hot water, to remove the loaf of polenta ; wipe it inwardly, butter it anew, and bread-crumb it; put the ‘polenta’ carefully in again, then scoop out the loaf, by the aid of a knife and spoon, leaving at the bottom and sides, no more than half an inch thick of ‘polenta’, and taking care to remove the top whole, and keep it aside.C0SM0P0L1TAN COOKERY. 442 On the other hand, cut in slices two blanched sweetbreads; season, place them in a flat stewpan, with melted butter, and fry them over a brisk fire ; the meat being well set, moisten it.with a gill of white wine ; add a dozen fresh mushrooms, cut into four pieces, and half a pound of lean bacon in squares. Cover the stewpan, quickly reducing the moisture to a glaze ; then thicken the stew with a little brown ‘espagnole’-sauce, mixed with a few tablespoonfuls of tomata-sauce, letting it boil, and adding two dozen small veal ‘quenelles’, rolled in flour and poached. Now pour the garnish into the cavity of the ‘polenta’, stop the opening with the cover kept for this purpose, soldering the junctures with liquid ‘polenta’, or force- meat ; butter the top, and push the mould into a moderate oven, Three quarters of an hour after, slip the blade of the knife in, between the mould and the preparation, disengaging this, and turn the ‘surtout’ out on a hot dish. 983. ‘Tagliarini’, Italian fashion. — Except in Naples, where macaroni is preferred to all other pastes, the ‘tagliarini’ are common to all states of Italy. Even in Rome there are special manufacturers, fabricating different products from the 'same paste; such as ‘lasagne, fctuccle, cappellctti’, etc. The paste itself is generally very well prepared. ‘Tagliarini’-paste. — Place on the table ten ounces of sifted flour, spread it with the hand, forming a hollow in its centre, in which put a little salt, a few tablespoon- fuls of tepid water, and break in five or six whole eggs ; bruise the eggs with the hand, and gradually mix them with the flour, thus obtaining a smooth and firm paste: the paste being well worked, no vestige of flour or paste should be left on the table. Cover the paste with a kitchen-basin, and let it rest for five or six minutes ; then divide it in two pieces, which roll out very thin on a floured table ; then set the flats on a cloth, and let them dry for a quarter of an hour. Afterwards divide them in strips about two inches wide, sift over a little flour; place the flats one over the other, and shred them transversally. As soon as the ‘tagliarini’ are cut, spread them out on several sheets of paper, thus letting them dry, but without letting them stick together. One hour after, plunge them into salted boiling water, boil them for two minutes, draw the stewpan off the fire; two minutes later, pour the ‘tagliarini’ on a sieve, and drain them ; put them back into the stewpan, with half a pound of butter in little bits ; which mix well, by the aid of a large fork, at the same time sprinkling over grated parmesan ; season with pepper and nutmeg, and place them in layers on a dish, baste with a few tablespoonfuls of tomata-sauce, reduced with a little good gravy, or melted meat-glaze. 984. ‘Surtout’ of rice, Italian fashion (D. 197). — Buttera timbale’-mould, sprinkle it inwardly with bread-crumb, and roll in two whole eggs,ENTREMETS. — PASTE. 443 previously well beaten together, then turn the mould out on a baking-sheet, to drain the eggs, and bread-crumb again.

This oven must be first heated inside oxer the fire, then garnished | on the top with braise. The dish containing it is set on a trivet standing on the centre of a baking-sheet with raised edges, the bottom of which is masked with a layer of hot embers. If these hand-ovens are heated with care, they may be used for cooking tarts, and even biscuits.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 444 live embers on the lid of the mould, and all round. When ready to serve, slip in the blade of a knife, between the mould and the ‘surtout’, to disengage it, and turn it out on a dish. 985. ‘Gnocchi’, Florence fashion. — Boil three pints or a quart of milk, introduce into the liquid eight ounces of semolina, keeping the preparation light; add to it a grain of salt, and a pinch of sugar; work it on the tire till it be of a nice consistence, and the semolina cooked ; now add to it three or four whipped eggs, mixed with a gill of water, and without ceasing to stir the preparation. The eggs being introduced, pour the preparation on a damp baking-sheet, let it cool, and divide it in rounds, or lozenges ; which arrange in a circle on the bottom of a buttered dish; sprinkle over some grated parmesan-cheeso, baste with butter, and set them in the oven to gratinate. 986. Parisian gnocchi (gnoquis). — Mix in a kitchen-basin half a pound of chicken force-meat (see No. 740) with the same weight of ‘choux’-paste without sugar; work the preparation with a spoon, introduce into it a handful of grated par- mesan ; then take it up, by small quantities, with a tablespoon, and drop it on a floured table, rolling it in the form of‘quenelles’; which plunge in salted boiling water, drain as soon as poached, and arrange them, by layers, into a vegetable dish, sprinkling over some grated parmesan, and basting with melted butter and good gravy. Sprinkle over the top also, and set them to gratinate in an oven (at a moderate heat) for fifteen minutes. 987. Nouilles (nudeln), German fashion. — Boil in salted water about a pound of shred ‘nouilles’ (see No. 983); drain them, introduce live ounces of butter, and the same of grated parmesan, season with a little pepper and nutmeg, thicken with four tablcspoonfuls of‘béchamcl’-sauce, and pour them on a dish; smooth the surface, and mask it with the following sauce : Bread and butter sauce. — Warm five ounces of butter in a stewpan, add to it two handfuls of bread-crumbs, which fry for three or four minutes, stirring, and pour the sauce over the ‘nouilles’. 988. Macaroni, Leghorn fashion. — Boil a pound of good macaroni in salted Avater ; drain, as soon as sufficiently soft; which pour into a stewpan, and thicken them with a few tablespoonfuls of ‘bcchamel’-sauce ; season with a little white pepper, and a point of nutmeg, introduce into it (off the fire, and with the aid ot a fork) six ounces of good butter in little bits, and rive ounces of grated parmesan; when well thickened and creamy, arrange the macaroni, by layers, into a deep dish, basting each layer with a ‘purée’ of tomatas slightly thickened.ENTREMETS. — PASTE 445 989. ‘Nouilles au gratin’ (D. 198). — Boil a pound, or a pound and a quarter, of shred ‘nouilles’ (see No. 983); put them into a stewpan, season ; introduce into them, off the tire, six ounces of good butter in little bits, four ounces of grated parmesan, and four tablespoonfuls of ‘bechamel’-sauce. Range the ‘nouilles’, in layers, on a ‘gratin’ dish, sprinkling them over with parmesan, and basting with melted butter ; then push the dish to the entrance of the oven ; ten minutes after, ti'laze the surface of the ‘nouilles’ with a salamander, to make them take a tine color. O 1 Fig. 198. The salamander is composed of a thick plate of iron, fixed to a handle likewise of iron. In order that the salamander may be able to color the surfaces of any food pre- paring for the table ; the iron-plate must first of all be made red-hot in the fire : in this condition is kept held within short distance of the surfaces, till these are, one by one, well glazed. Two Drawings are here given of this article of kitchen-furniture, so highly useful, where not well supplied with ovens. 990. Macaroni, Pruss fashion. — Take two blanched, cold sweet- breads, put them into a small stewpan, with butter, and five ounces of raw ham cut into large dice ; fry them for a few minutes, and moisten, to three-parts their height, with gravy and madeira ; add the trimmings of three fresh truffles, reduce the liquid to half. Finish cooking the sweetbreads in this stock, turning them; drain, cut them in slices, which mix with a few pieces of salted tongue. Add to the cooking-stock a few tablespoonfuls of brown-sauce ; let it boil up, pass it through a sieve ; then add to it three raw truffles cut in large dice ; boil it for five minutes, and pour it over the sweetbreads. Twenty-five minutes previous to serving, break about a pound of macaroni into pieces two inches long ; which plunge into salted boiling water ; boil them with the stewpan covered, until well done, drain them on a colander; then put them back into the stewpan, moisten with a few tablespoonfuls of melted glaze, and part ot the sauceCOSMOPOLITAN ( 'OOKERY. 44G of the stew; add a piece of butter. Set the stewpan on a moderate fire, simmer the macaroni for ten minutes, thus giving them a nice brown color ; then introduce into it three or four handfuls of grated parmesan, and pour it on a vegetable dish, leaving a hollow in the centre, which fill with the garnish. 991. ‘Pizza’, Naples fashion. — The ‘pizza’ is a favorite dish of the Nea- politans, who eat it especially for supper. To be well appreciated, it must be eaten immediately, when taken out of the oven; this being the reason why the real ama- teurs in order to go, eat them, to the fabricators (jrizza'ioli) themselves ; where they not only enjoy the pleasure of eating them warm, but also seeing them prepared, a process not without its interest. Take about a pound and a half of bread-paste, a little slighter than usual, hut well risen ; set it on a floured table, and flatten it round, beating it with the hands; slightly raise the edges of the paste, baste its surface with a little oil, and garnish it, whether with small fresh anchovies, half-tomatas, fillets of salted anchovies, or some ‘mozzarella’ (tender sheep’s cheese) : the Neapolitans often mix these different sub- stances. Sprinkle over the ‘pizza’ a little salt, pepper, and fine chopped garlic, mixed up with parsley and dry savory, basting with oil. Take the ‘pizza’ then with a shovel, and push it into the plain oven, heated as for bread, and kept very clean. ‘Pizzaïoli’ bake with the oven open, keeping at its entrance small lighted pieces of wood: a middling-sized ‘pizza’ will take twenty minutes. When coming out of the oven, slip it on a large dish. 992. ‘Risot’ of the epicure. — First of all, prepare a garnish composed of cocks’-combs and kidneys of poultry, lambs’-sweetbreads and kernels ; all of which must be blanched, or cooked, according to their tenderness ; then mix them well up, and put them into a stewpan. Peel three or four black raw truffles, put their trimmings into a stewpan, with half a glassful of‘espagnole’-sauce, with half this volume of madeira or Marsala wine; add a bunch of parsley and ‘aromates’, set the stewpan on the fire, reduce the sauce, while stirring it; when cooked, add to it two tablespoonfuls of tomata-sauce, the same of melted meat-glaze, a little cayenne ; let the sauce boil, and draw it off into another stewpan. Now add to it the truffles cut in quarters, which boil in the sauce on the side of the fire for four or five minutes. Pour the sauce and truffles over the previously prepared garnish, which keep in the ‘bain-marie’ until the rice be cooked. Twenty-five minutes previous to serving, put into a stewpan a tablespoonful of chopped onion, and a few tablespoonfuls of melted beef-marrow ; fry, which without allowing to take color; add now half a pound of Piémont rice, not washed ; warm it for a few moments, moisten to three-parts with broth, add three sausages, boil the rice on a good fire, until nearly dry.

When time to serve, pour the ‘risot’ on a deep dish or a vegetable-pan, form a hollow in its centre, and dish into this hollow the previously prepared garnish. Sur- round the ‘risot’ with the sausages cut in pieces. 993. Risot, Naples fashion. — Chop one onion, fry it with oil in a ' stewpan ; as soon as it is slightly colored, add to it a pound of Piémont rice, not washed ; which fry for a few seconds, and moisten three times its height with fish- broth ; add to it a chopped tomata, freed of pips, boil it for twenty minutes, then take it off the fire ; introduce into it, by small quantities, four or five handfuls of grated parmesan, and a small ragout of crayfish-tails, oysters, and mushrooms ; all of which previously cooked and cut in dice. Cover the stewpan, and two minutes after, dish the ‘risot’. 994. ‘Fidelini’ with butter. — 111 Italy they have some very fine sorts | of Vermicelli’, but dried straight, and of the length of the ‘spaghetti’ : it is a very ! delicate sort of paste, highly estimated by amateurs. Plunge a pound of ‘fidelini’ into salted boiling water, cover the stewpan, and ! boil them quickly for three minutes ; then drain them on a sieve, put them back into the same stewpan, having been well wiped, add six ounces of grated parmesan, work the mixture well, with the aid of a fork; and when the preparation is well thickened, dish them. 995. ‘Spaghetti’, Naples fashion. — What in Naples is called spa- ghetti (threads) is nothing else but a variety of macaroni, the thickness of which is the medium between that of the ‘fidelini’ and the macaroni ; it is the paste commonly ! eaten in Naples, where however all sorts of paste are perfect. Portici, Salerne, ! Grignano, furnish products of an incomparable quality. The Neapolitans not only enjoy the advantage of having at their disposal superiorly prepared pastes, but they i realise the still greater one of partaking of them quite fresh, a matter certainly ! doubling their value. Macaroni is eaten in Naples in all its perfection ; and those who have not tasted it in the country, will never be able to form an adequate con- j ception of its good qualities. The Neapolitans commonly prepare the ‘spaghetti’, and the macaroni, in a very simple way. Boil it just to the point, that is, until it ceases to crackle between the : teeth ; drain it quickly, introduce into it, off the fire, a little butter and grated par- mesan (six ounces of butter, and four of cheese, will do for a pound of paste) ; baste it with a few tablespoonfuls of tomata-paste, diluted and boiled with about a pint of I good veal- or beef-gravy. Such is the usual preparation of the paste; but, to getCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 448 ‘spaghetti’ of a more luxurious and succulent kind, the gi'avy may be replaced by some good melted meat glaze. Macaroni, as well as ‘risot’, requires to be eaten immediately when ready. After eating macaroni, the Neapolitans make it a rule to drink nothing hut a glass of pure water, in order to facilitate the digestion; this explains how, after emptying one or two plates of macaroni, they can do justice, without inconvenience, to the rest of their dinner. Any, who drink wine, after macaroni, will find it more difficult. 99G. ‘Strohl’-cheese, English fashion. —- Spread on a slab six ounces of flour, in the centre of which place six ounces of butter, six ounces of grated par mesan, three yolks of eggs, a little cayenne, and a tablespoonful of raw cream. Mix the butter with the cheese, then with the flour, so as to obtain a paste, not too firm ; roll it out thin, and divide it into thin strips, four or five inches long ; which set on a baking-sheet, and push into a hot oven. When done, take them off and dish them on a folded napkin. 997. ‘Crissins’ with cheese. Take half a pound of flour, with which prepare a water-paste, as for puff-paste ; let it rest for a quarter of an hour, then butter it with half a pound of butter, well dried off and firm ; give to it four turns, proceeding as for puff-paste, but sprinkling, over the paste, parmesan instead of flour. When the paste has four turns, divide it into fillets, five inches long, and of the thick- ness of a pen-holder; roll them on the table, then arrange them on a baking-sheet, at a little distance one from the other, egg them slightly, sprinkle over some parmesan, and bake them in a hot oven, dishing them up as soon as done. 998. Indian-corn-cakes, American fashion. — Mix in a kitchen- basin, a pound of Indian-corn flour with a handful of wheat flour. Form a hollow in its centre, into which break four whole eggs; add four ounces of melted butter, a pinch of soda, a pinch of cream of tartar, a pinch of salt, and four ounces of pounded sugar ; introduce into the liquid two gills of milk, as well as the flour, thus forming a smooth paste, with which fill some buttered tartlet-moulds, and bake the cakes for twenty minutes. These cakes are served for breakfast or luncheon, and should be eaten very hot. 999. Buckwheat - cakes. — Put into a kitchen-basin a pound of buck- wheat flour, and spread it with the back of the hand, forming a hollow in its centre. Dilute one ounce of German yeast with two gills of tepid water ; strain it, and with it dilute the flour, thus forming a paste, of the consistency of a frying-paste; add a little salt, cover the basin, and let it rise at a gentle temperature for seven or eight hours. The paste is usually made the evening before using it.ENTREMETS. — PASTE. 449 One hour before baking the cakes, work the paste with the hand, introduce into it a handful of yellow Indian-corn, and a few tablespoonfuls of molasses. Grease a cast-iron baking-sheet, and warm ; take up the paste with a tablespoon, and drop it on the hot baking-sheet : when spread, the cakes should be two or three inches in diameter; bake them on a good oven, turning them ; when ready, dish them, and send up at once. The Americans think as much of these cakes, as the Russians do of their ‘blinis’. 1000. Cheese soufflé, in small cases (D. 199). - Warm eight ounces of butter in a stewpan. Break ten yolks of eggs into a kitchen-basin, mix them with the butter ; stir on the fire for a few seconds, thickening the preparation ; then take it off the fire, and gradually introduce into it fourteen ounces of grated cheese (swiss and parmesan, each half). Season with a pinch of pepper and one of sugar, warm the preparation very gently, without ceasing to stir. When smooth, take it off the fire, and introduce into it two Avhipped whites of eggs. Twenty-five minutes previous to serving, add to the preparation six more whip- ped whites of eggs; now fill about ten middling-sized square paper-cases, which place on a baking-sheet, spread with paper, and push them into a slow oven. When done, dish up, and serve. This preparation of ‘soufflé’ does not rise much, but also does not crumble down, and is excellent to eat : being the best I know. 1001. Munster-tartines. —- Cut some slices of brown Westfalian bread, (pumpernickel), about the fifth part of an inch thick, and of a rectangular form, three inches wide; cut also some slices of fresh household-bread, of the same shape and thickness. Mask the brown bread with a thin layer of good butter, on which apply a slice of white bread, which equally mask with butter, and cover with a slice of brown I bread ; press the bread slightly, then divide it into oblong squares. These ‘tartines’ are served with tea.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 450 This ‘pumpernickel’-bread could easily be had in England and France, quite as well as many other products of foreign countries ; as it keeps fresh and good for a considerable time. 1002. Dijon-‘ramequins’. — Put into a stewpan half■ a glass of water, a little salt, a pinch of pepper, a teaspoonful of sugar, and six ounces of butter. Set the stewpan on the tire ; at the first bubbling take it off, and introduce into it eight ounces of flour ; stir with the spoon, thus obtaining a smooth and thick paste ; work it a few minutes on the fire, pour into another stewpan, add to it four or five whole eggs, and then five ounces of chopped Swiss cheese. Now take the paste up with a tablespoon, and let it drop on a baking-sheet, in the shape of round balls, the size of a small egg. Egg the ‘ramequins’, set on each of them a small slice of cheese, and bake them in a hot oven. 1003. Dumplings (kloesse), with flour. —'Place half a pound of flour in a kitchen-basin with a little salt, a piece of melted butter, and three or four whole eggs; dilute the preparation with milk, thus obtaining a smooth and firm paste ; then add to it two handfuls of bread-‘croûtons’, cut in dice, and fried in butter. Now the preparation should be of the consistence of a panada ; if it be too soft, a handful of rasped bread-crumb may be introduced into it. Take it then up, with a spoon, in parts the size of a walnut; which drop on a floured table, and roll to a round form; plunge them into salted boiling water, boil them for seven or eight minutes (with the stewpan covered), remove the pan back, and ten minutes after, drain the dumplings, with a skimmer, on a cloth. Dish them up, and pour over some nut-brown clarified butter. 1004. Dumplings, Vienna fashion. — Cut up, in small dice, about a pound of crumb from a loaf of kitchen-bread, and fry them to a nice color with blitter. Then moisten with two gills of boiling milk, cover the stewpan, and keep on the side. When the bread has absorbed all the moisture, add to it four or five table- spoonfuls of cooked fine-herbs, mixed up with half their volume of raw ham, in dice; sprinkle the preparation with a pinch of flour, pour over a few well whipped eggs, and season : it should be consistent enough to be moulded in small round pieces, which plunge into boiling salted water ; at the first bubbling, remove the pan off the fire, poaching the dumplings for ten minutes. On the other hand, pour into a stewpan six ounces of melted butter ; when hot, add to it two handfuls of bread-crumb, which fry for two minutes. The dumplings being done, put them into the stewpan.with the butter; keep thus for a few minutes, and dish them up.4M ENTREMETS. — TASTE. 1005.

Give a few babblings to the liquid, and when the paste is firm, drain the ‘gnocchi’ in a colander, and put them into a stewpan, adding to them some grated parmesan, and swiss cheese, mixed. Baste them with three or four tablespoonfuls of reduced ‘béchamel’-sauce, a little butter and glaze; pour them into a 'timbale’-mould, previously decorated with ‘office’-paste, and lined thinly with a flat of paste, soldering it quickly to that of the sides; and push the ‘timbale’ into a moderate oven, baking it for three quarters of an hour; then turn it out on a dish, and serve. 100G.

Set the stewpan of Tontina’ on a very slow fire, and stir with a spoon till quite dissolved, and no longer fibrous; then mix with it the diluted yolks of eggs, and stir the preparation, till thick as cream, | without allowing it to boil ; add thereto a pinch of pepper, draw it off the fire, and introduce into it, stirring, a piece of good butter. Three minutes after, it will get a little consistence ; and now throw in a small handful of sliced white truffles. Pour I the Tondue’ into a deep dish, placing in its centre another handful of sliced truffles. If no truffles be handy, surround the Tondue’ with fried bread -‘croutons’. 1010. Plovers’ eggs, in a nest of butter (D. 201). — To ascertain Fig. 201. the freshness of plovers’ and lapwings’ eggs, plunge them, one by one, info a vessel of cold water. Those which rise to the surface of the liquid, are no longer good, or at least, have lost that freshness, which is their best quality. Place gently, on the bottom of a stewpan, eighteen raw plovers’ eggs ; cover them, by degrees, with cold water, start the liquid to ebullition, then draw the pan back. Seven or eight minutes after, take up the eggs with a skimmer, and plunge them into cold water. These eggs are often, however, served hot. On the other hand, with fresh butter, prepare a small border on the bottom of a dish. Take eight ounces of the butter, handling it in a cloth, thus softening it; and introduce it into a bag (poche à douille), garnished at its thin end; then press it together irregularly on the border, in imitation of a bird’s nest : the butter may be simply squeezed through a colander or cornet. Mask the bottom of the dish with a layer of cress, and on this, dish eggs in pyramids, after having slightly broken the shell at one end. 1011. Russ Vatrovskis. — Press closely in a cloth fourteen ounces of white cheese, thus extracting its moisture ; put it into a mortar, with a piece of hutter, and pound it; when the paste is smooth, season with salt and nutmeg, placeCOSMOPOLITAN CO( )KERY. 454 it in an earthen pan, and intoduce into it three or four yolks of eggs, working it with a spoon. Take a pound of 'culibiac’-paste, work it on a floured table for a few minutes, beating with the hand dipped in flour ; when firm and cold, roll it out in a thin flat, stamp out some rounds with a tin-cutter, wet the edges of the paste, and set on its centre a small part of the preparation; fold the flat in a crescent-shape, press its edges down with the thumb, trimming it regularly with the cutter. Range the 'vatrovskis’ on a baking-sheet, and at a distance one from the other. Keep them for twenty minutes at the temperature of the kitchen ; egg them afterwards, and bake them in a moderate oven ; when done, dish them on a folded napkin. 1012. Italian fritters, with cheese. — Prepare a ‘salpicon’, composed of six ounces of meat of cooked lean ham ; place it in a stewpan. Pound then three ounces of fresh parmesan-cheese, to which add the half of a cooked and cooled calfs brain; mix this preparation up with the 'salpicon’, and with this form little balls, of the size of a nut; slightly flour these balls, dip them into frying-paste, then plunge into a great pan of hot hog’s lard ; the paste being dry, and of a nice color, drain the fritters, and serve. 1013. Omelet Of the desert. Full and fresh ostrich-eggs arc nowa- days no scarcity in Europe; as the ostriches, in the gardens of acclimatisation, lay their eggs there, just as well as in the desert. I have recently bought some of these eggs in Florence, at the rate of eight or nine pence a piece ; which is relatively very cheap, considering that one ostrich-egg is equal to ten or twelve hen’s eggs. It pos- sesses the same qualities, as that of the duck. In Egypt I ate the omelet hereafter described, made by Arabs, who are very fond of it, and prepare it very well. Slice a new onion, put it into a frying-pan with oil ; fry it, without allowing to take color ; and add to it the flesh of two large mild 'poivrons’, after having broiled them for a few minutes, to remove the skin ; add also two good tomatas, peeled, freed of pips, and cut in small dice. Season the preparation with salt, and a little cayenne ; reduce the moisture of the tomatas. Then drawing the frying-pan oil' the fire, add to the vegetables the fillets of four anchovies cut in dice. On the other hand, rub the bottom of a kitchen-basin with a clove of garlic, pierce an ostrich-egg on both ends, in order to take out the yolk and white, which let fall into the kitchen-basin ; season, and beat well up together with a whisk. Pour a quarter of a glass of oil into an omelet-pan, when hot, pour the egg in; thicken the omelet slightly, and add to the preparation; when set, turn it in the pan, leaving it flat ; baste it again with a little oil, and a few seconds after, slip it on a round dish.455 ENTREMETS. — EGGS. 1014. Farced eggs (D. 202). — Boil hard eight or ten eggs ; when cold, remove their shell, cut them in two lengthwise, separate the glaires from the yolks, and put these latter into a mortar, pounding them with a piece of soaked bread- | crumb, well pressed, the fillets of ten anchovies, and a piece of butter. Thicken the preparation with three or four raw yolks of eggs ; season, take it off the mortar, and place it in a kitchen-basin. Fry in a stewpan two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion ; when of a nice color, ! add to them two or three handfuls of chopped mushrooms ; season, and quickly Fig. 202. ' | reduce the moisture of the tine-herbs. Take them off the tire, sprinkle over a pinch of bread-crumbs and parsley ; let them cool, and then add them to the preparation in the basin. With this preparation fill the half-eggs, shaping it in a dome-like fashion, and smoothing it on the top with the blade of a knife. Butter a ‘saute’-pan, at the bottom of which place the eggs, their garnished side uppermost ; sprinkle over some bread-crumbs, and baste with melted butter. Let the eggs gratinate, for twenty minutes, in a moderate oven ; then dish them up in pyramids. 1015. ‘Brouillés’ eggs, with crayfish-tails. — Take four tablespoon- fuls of picked crayfish-tails ; if they were very large, divide each of them in two, leaving whole the smaller ones. With the shells prepare a little red butter (beurre- d’écrevisses). Butter largely the bottom of a stewpan, more broad than high. Break eight fresh eggs into a kitchen-basin, beat them, season with salt and pepper; pour the eggs into the previously buttered stewpan, which set on a moderate fire, and stir with a wooden spoon, so as to get the preparation as smooth as possible. As soon as it begins to thicken, take it off the fire, without ceasing to stir. Add to it two tablespoonfuls of good raw-cream, and then the red butter divided in little pieces. Two minutes after, add the crayfish-tails, and dish the preparation, surround it with fried bread-‘croûtons’, glazed with the paste-brush.456 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 1016. German omelet. — Put into a kitchen-basin four tablespoonfuls of flour, dilute it with three whole and three yolks of eggs, and with a glass of good milk or cream : add a little salt, a pinch of pepper, nutmeg, or cinnamon ; pass the preparation, through a sieve, then throw in a pinch of chopped chives. Put into an omelet-pan four ounces of butter, warm it, and add to it half the preparation, spreading it all over the pan, and keeping it thin ; prick the omelet with a fork, in order to dry it quickly ; turn it, as soon as possible, to disengage it from the pan, whether by tossing it over with a brisk jerk, or by turning it out on a dish, and again slipping it into the pan, after having poured into this two tablespoon- fuls of melted butter. When the omelet is done, and of a nice gold color; lay it on a sheet of white paper, and roll it round itself. ■ With the remainder of the prepara- tion make another omelet, proceeding in the same way ; then place the two omelets, side by side, on a small oblong dish. In Germany, these omelets are also often served as a garnish for vegetables ; in which case, they are divided transversally in small parts. 1017. French-beans, with fresh salted herrings, German fashion. — This simple dish, when prepared with early french-beans and fresh herrings (meaning freshly salted), is much esteemed, and much called for by the Germans : it is served on the most distinguished tables. Pick a few handfuls of tender french-beans, slice them lengthwise, put them into a stewpan, and moisten half-height with broth. Let the liquid boil, then remove the pan on to a moderate tire, cooking the beans gently ; when done, the liquid should be about reduced ; season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of savory, pounded if dry, chopped if fresh ; thicken them with a piece of kneaded-butter, and dish them up. On the other hand, wash two or three salted herrings, trim away the head and skin, cut them up in slices, a little slanting, place them on a small dish spread with vine- leaves, putting them back into form ; let them accompany the french-beans. 1018. Red haricot-beans, with wine. — Boil the beans in water, with a piece of smoked bacon, previously blanched. On the other hand, blanch two dozen small onions, fry them in butter, and moisten with broth, which reduce to a glaze. The beans being done, drain, put them into a stewpan, moisten with a bottle of white wine, reduced one third, simmer them for a quarter of an hour, then thicken with a piece of kneaded-butter. Cut the bacon in slices, dish the beans up, and surround them with the bacon and small glazed onions. 1019. French-beans, garnished with artichoke-bottoms (D. 203). — Artichokes, tit for the preparation of artichoke-bottoms, are not to be found every where ; but every where preserved artichoke-bottoms are to be purchased.457 ENTREMETS. — VEGETABLES. Take ten or twelve blanched or preserved artichoke-bottoms half-done, and of an equal size; pare them, arrange them in a flat stewpan, moisten with a sufficient quantity of white broth very fat, the juice of a few lemons, or a little white wine, to cover; lay over a buttered paper, and finish cooking them gently. Take a pint of fresh french-beans; if fine, leave whole, otherwise mince; plunge them into boiling water, add a handful of salt, and boil them over a brisk fire. Drain them on a sieve, put into a stewpan with five ounces of butter; season, and Fig. 203. warm them on a brisk fire; keep tossing till the butter be melted, then add the juice of two lemons. Serve them up on a hot dish, in pyramids, and surround with the artichoke-bottoms, overlapping and almost upright. 1020. White haricot-beans, ‘à la Robert’. — In the chapter on Butcher’s meat (No. 600), 1 have described the method of cooking white haricot- beans: let me recommend it, as giving excellent results. Boil half a quart of white dry haricot-beans. Cut up two or three large onions in large dice, fry them in butter to a nice color, moisten with a few tablespoonfuls of broth, and reduce the liquid to glaze ; moisten with gravy, boil them for ten minutes ; thicken with a piece of kneaded-butter, season, and finish, introducing into it, off the fire, a tablespoonful of good mustard, and a piece of butter. 1021. ‘Garbanços’ boiled. The vegetable, called gctrbanços in Spain, ceci in Italy, pois chiches in Provence, is called ‘chick-peas’ in England. The best and most reputed ones are those of Castilla in Spain, where they are generally larger, and possess the double advantage of cooking well, and comparatively in a ; short time. Plunge the pease in tepid water with a handful of pounded salt, placing the basin ; in such a manner, that the water may remain at the same degree of warmth for ■ about fifteen hours, stirring the pease from time to time; when tender, drain, wash them in several waters, and plunge them into salted boiling water ; boil them gently.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 458 until tender, which will take three or four hours. When one meets with bad cooking pease, a bit of ammoniac (the size of a lentil) may be thrown into the water; this acid, no way injurious to the health, will help sensibly the softening of the pease; the question is, not to use it to excess. 1022. Endive (‘chicorée’). — Chicoi •y, or endive, is divided into several sorts: garden-endive, endive-proper, ‘escarole’, and wild-endive or succory : crisped endive being the best. Get twelve heads of white and fresh endive, remove the green leaves, keeping only the tenderest parts; which cut up, wash in several waters, and plunge into salted boiling water. The endive being done, drain it in a colander ; when cold, press it out between the hands to extract all its moisture, chop it, put into a stewpan with butter, and fry for a few minutes, stirring; then sprinkle over two tablespoon- fuls of flour, season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg; moisten, by degrees, with broth, gravy, or cream ; and cook for a quarter of an hour, stirring often, so that it may not stick to the bottom of the pan. The endive, thus cooked, may be served, either as garnish, or ‘entremet’; in the latter case, surround it with ‘croutons’ of fried bread, or of puff-paste, as well as with eggs boiled soft or poached. 1023. Cauliflower fried. — Divide a cauliflower in small flowrets, pare off their stalks, boil them in salted water, keeping them a little firm. Put them into a kitchen-basin; season with salt, pepper, chopped parsley, oil, and lemon-juice; half an hour after, drain, flour, dip them in beaten eggs, and plunge them into hot fat ; when of a nice color, drain, and serve them up on a dish. 1024. Fried artichokes, Italian fashion. — Get very tender arti- chokes, trim the bottom, leaving only the tender green leaves. Split each of the arti- chokes in two, lengthwise ; mince these parts, and put them into a kitchen-basin ; season with salt and pepper, and thus let macerate for three quarters of an hour; drain, flour, and dip them into beaten eggs ; plunge into plenty of hot fat, so as to give them a fine color ; dish them on a folded napkin. 1025. Omelet, with artichokes. — This dish is excellent, when pre- pared with fresh, tender artichokes, free of fibrous parts. Trim away the green leaves, cut off the others to half their height, and divide the artichokes, each in two parts ; cut each half into thin long slices, which put into a frying-pan with butter, season with salt and pepper, fry them on a moderate fire, turning them ; when done, take them off the fire, and drain the butter. Break up eight or ten fresh eggs into a basin, season with salt and pepper, beat them quickly for a few seconds ; add a pinch of chopped parsley, and the cooked459 ENTREMETS. VEGETABLES. artichokes. Warm, in an omelet-pan, three ounces of butter; pour the eggs in, thicken the omelet, roll it into a form of porte-manteau, and turn it out on an oblong dish. 1020. Artichokes boiled (D. 204). Large artichokes are best for boiling, the smaller ones not suiting so well. Pull off’ the outer leaves of a few artichokes, cut the tip of the leaves square, pare neatly the bottoms; which rub with a lemon, and plunge them into salted, acidu- lous, boiling-water; boil, until the inside may be easily taken out; then drain them with a skimmer, pick out the fibrous parts of the centre, and put them back into the water, to finish cooking. Drain them afterwards, cut each of the artichokes in two, without separating the parts, and dish them up the bottom uppermost. These artichokes may be served with butter, or Dutch-sauce, or with a ‘vinaigrette’. 1027. Cauliflowers, with crayfish. — Cook twenty-five small cray- fish, and at the same time about ten of larger size. Pick the tails and claAvs of the small ones, and keep them covered. Pick also the tails and claws of the large ones, to be kept hot. On the other hand, boil a nice cauliflower in salted water; with a part of its own and the crayfish-liquor, prepare some butter-sauce ; thicken it Avith a few yolks of eggs, and add to it the tails and claws of the smaller crayfish. Drain the cauli floAver, dish it up, mask it with the previously prepared sauce, and place the larger crayfish-tails and claws all round. 1028. Farced cucumbers, Turkish fashion. — Cut the cucumbers in fieces (tronçons), blanch very slightly, empty them ; fill the hollow with a raAv mince of nmtton-fillets, mixed up with a little suet, a pinch of chopped onion, a little parsley, and at last some tablespoonfuls of blanched rice : the preparation must be seasoned well. Cook the cucumbers, short of moisture, with a little broth and tomata-liquor ; then dish the cucumbers ; mix a little gravy into their cooking-stock, let it once boil ip, and, passing, pour it over the cucumbers.460 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 1029. Asparagus, Spanish fashion. — Scrape some white or green asparagus, cut them up of an equal length, tie them into bundles, and boil them in salted water ; when about done, remove the pan back. Pour a part of their cooking- stock into a small round copper-pan, or into a stewpan ; which set on the lire, add a few tablespoonfuls of vinegar, and when boiling, poach in it a dozen new-laid eggs; the eggs being drained, and trimmed, dish up the asparagus on a napkin, surround it with the poached eggs, and send up separately a sauceboat of Vinaigrette’, that is ; oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper, mixed up together. 1030. Green-pease, with lettuces. First of all, blanch and braise a dozen lettuces. Chop one onion, put it into a stewpan with a piece of butter, and eight ounces of streaky bacon in dice ; which fry on a moderate lire, and add lo it a pint of fresh green-pease, four tablespoonfuls of broth, a bunch of parsley, and a little salt; cover the stewpan, and cook the pease. At the last moment, thicken with a piece of kneaded-butter ; then dish them up, surrounding them with the glazed lettuce, placing between each a fried bread-‘croûton’ shaped like a cock’s comb, and glazed with the paste-brush. 1031. Omelet, with sprue-asparagus. — Get some tender green spruce of asparagus, scrape them slightly, cut the tip of the head, break the stems at the part ceasing to be tender, cut them transversally in pieces half an inch long ; which put into a frying-pan, with butter or oil. Season them with salt and pepper, toss on a good tire till done, observing to keep them a little firm, and to avoid blackening or drying them ; then drain them on a sieve. Break ten eggs into a kitchen-basin, season with salt, pepper, and some chopped parsley ; beat the eggs up together; warm in an omelet-pan some good butter or oil, pour the eggs in, adding thereto the sprue-asparagus. Stir the omelet, thickening it, toss it gently on the tire, fold it in an oval form, and turn it out on a dish. 1032. Pumpion-flowers farced. - The flowers of pumpions (courges), farced, are the ‘dolmas’ of Provence. Get about fifteen well opened pumpion-flowers, whole, and of an equal size; wipe, and trim away the pistils. Prepare a very fine force-meat, with two thirds ot lean mutton, a third of beef-kidney-suet, and a few handfuls of parboiled rice ; season with salt, pepper, a little chopped parsley, and thicken with two or three whole eggs. With this force-meat fill the pumpion-flowers, close them carefully, and arrange them in a flat stewpan, spread with bacon, ham, and minced vegetables ; cover them also with thin layers of bacon, moisten with a little broth, and a few tablespoon- fuls of tomata-liquor (eau de tomates); let the liquid reduce to half, then draw the stewpan over a moderate fire, and finish cooking the vegetables gently. DishENTREMETS. - VEGETABLES. 401 up ; pour a little gravy into the stewpan, let the liquid boil, pass it, skim off the fat, and pour it over the vegetables. 1033. Celery, with half-glaze (D. 205). — rJ ['rim the green stalks off’ eight or ten heads of celery, cut them up in pieces four or five inches long, and point their heads; wash them in several waters, plunge them into boiling salted water, parboil them for ten or twelve minutes ; then drain, refresh, and put them into a flat Fig. 205. stewpan, spread with trimmings of bacon. Moisten to height with gravy, add to them cloves and peppercorns, cover with a buttered paper, and boil them gently. When ready to serve, drain, trim them regularly, and pile them up, in pyramids, on a dish. Strain and skim the fat off the gravy, reduce it to half-glaze, thicken it with a small piece of kneaded-butter, and pour it over the celery. 1034. ‘Cucuzzelle’ (coucoucelles, or petites courges) Roman fashion. — Get two dozen small round gourds (cucuzzelle) ; empty them with a vegetable-spoon, making a very small opening; slightly blanch, and wipe them well. Chop the flesh, taken out of the ‘cucuzzelle’; fry it in butter on a brisk fire, until its moisture be evaporated, then pass it through a sieve. Put the purée into a stew- pan, add to it its volume of biscuit-powder, a handful of bread-crumb, a little salt, and nutmeg; introduce into it five or six yolks of eggs. With this preparation, fill the ‘cucuzzelle’; set them one beside the other, in a buttered flat stewpan, baste • with a little butter, and push them into the oven, allowing them to take color. After- wards dish them up, basting with the butter in which they have been cooked. 1035. ‘Zucchette’ (courgerons) fried, Genoa fashion. — Get some long ‘zucchette’, not too large, trim both ends away, and divide them into long square fillets, the size of a large fillet of larding-bacon ; put them into a deep dish, sprinkle ! over salt, and let them macerate for ten minutes, frequently giving them a jerk. Afterwards drain them, wipe in a cloth, flour quickly, by small parts at a time, and plunge them into hot drippings; when dry, drain, salt, and dish them in a group on a napkin.462 COSMOPOLITAN COOK KEY 1036. Asparagus-salad, German fashion. — Take some small white or viulet asparagus ; scrape, and cut up the tender parts, to an equal length (about an inch), boil them in salted water, and let them cool. A few minutes previous to serving, put them into a kitchen-basin, with a third their volume of Cray fish-tails, and season with salt and pepper. Pass the yolk of six hard-boiled eggs, through a sieve, dilute with oil and vinegar ; pour this sauce over the asparagus and crayfish-tails, then dish them symmetrically on a salad-bowl, and pour the seasoning over. 1037. Asparagus, Geneva sauce. — Scrape and dish the asparagus in salted water, drain, dish them up, and send up separately the following sauce : Geneva-sauce. — Pass through a sieve four yolks of cooked eggs, put them into a basin, add three raw yolks of eggs, and a good tablespoonful of mustard. Work the preparation with a spoon, introducing into it gradually some oil, thus obtaining a kind of light ‘mayonnaise’ ; finish the sauce with a little vinegar; season, and serve it in a sauceboat. 1038. Parisian salad. - Cut up, in thin slices, a baked beet-root; cut likewise an equal quantity of celery-roots, boiled in water, and the same of potatoes, boiled with the peel on ; place these vegetables in a kitchen-basin, add a handful of rampion with their tufts ; season, and pour over oil and vinegar. Pass through a sieve five or six yolks of hard-boiled eggs, mix then, in a salad- bowl, with two tablespoonfuls of anchovy-purée or anchovy-extract ; work the pre- paration with a wooden spoon, and gradually introduce into it a gill of Provence or Lucca oil ; when the preparation is thickened, add to it a small tablespoonful of good mustard, a little good taragon-vinegar, four tablespoonfuls of pickled tunny, in dice; throw in a little cayenne, and a pinch of chopped taragon-leaves ; then add the minced vegetables, previously well drained, toss them up, to mix well with the preparation, then dish the salad up in a salad-bowl.- 1039. Salad of vegetables, with jelly (D. 206). Cut up the heads of some white sprue-asparagus, about two inches long ; scrape, and boil them in salted water. Boil also some green sprue-asparagus, a cauliflower in small flowrets, carrots in balls, french-beans, flageolet-beans, potatoes with the peel on, celery-roots, and beetroots. . With a part of the green asparagus form a small bundle, which secure in form with a ring of carrot; keep them aside, with a part of the white asparagus, and car- rots in balls. Mix the remainder of the vegetables in a kitchen-basin, add a few gerkins, stoned olives, and capers ; season, baste with oil and vinegar, in which leave them for ten minutes; drain afterwards, put back into the pan, and thicken with a few tablespoonfuls of mayonnaise with jelly. With this preparation, fill a pyramidal463 ENTREMETS. — VEGETABLES. mould, embedded in pounded ice. When the preparation is set, turn it out on a little stand, tixed on the centre of a dish, and take the mould off. Take the asparagus kept by, dip them in half-set jelly, and arrange them upright at the base of the pyramid, applying them against it ; above the asparagus place the cauliflowers, then a row of round carrots ; repeat a second row of cauli- flowers, and above this one, a circle of olives. Set the small bundle of green aspa- ragus on the top, and glaze all the vegetables with half-set aspic. Place all round Fig. 20(i. the edges of the stand a circle of halves of eggs, garnished with a ‘macedoine’ of small vegetables, of various shades of color, thickened with aspic-jelly. Then sur- round the base of the stand with jelly -‘croutons’, and send up separately a boatful of mayonnaise-sauce with eggs. 1040. Omelet, with spinach. — Wash and chop two handfuls of tender spinach, press out the water, put it into a frying-pan, with a piece of butter ; season, and fry, stirring till its moisture be evaporated ; then add to it two tablespoonfuls of melted glaze, or some good sauce, and keep aside. Rub the bottom of a kitchen-basin with a clove of garlic, break ten eggs into it ; season with salt and pepper, mix with a pinch of chopped parsley, and beat them up for a few seconds. Now melt live ounces of butter in a frying-pan ; as soon as hot, pour in the beaten eggs, stirring with a spoon to thicken, and tossing the pan to bring the omelet on one side ; fill the centre with the cooked spinach ; fold it, enclo- sing the garnish ; roll it in an oval form, and turn it out on a small dish. 1041. ‘Subric’ Of spinach. — Pick some spinach, wash well, parboil it in salted water, for five minutes ; drain, refresh it, press the water out, and chop it fine. Put into a stewpan four ounces of butter, warm it, and add to it about a pound and a quarter of chopped spinach ; season, and fry for two minutes ; sprinkle over aCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 464 tablespoonful of flour, and moisten with good milk, thus obtaining a solid prepa- ration, which boil for a few minutes ; then remove back, and add to it a handful of grated parmesan, four ounces of butter, four or five yolks of eggs, and two whites whipped up. Pour some clarified blitter into a baking-sheet (plafond) with borders; take up the preparation with a tablespoon, and let drop into the hot butter ; when firm, stamp it with a round tin-cutter, turn the Rubrics’ out, let them take color on the other side ; drain, and dish them up. 1042. Ravioli (ravioles) with spinach. — Blanch and chop four hand- fuls of spinach, put it into a stewpan, with hot butter, and reduce its moisture, stir- ring ; season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg ; sprinkle over a handful of bread- crumbs, and baste with four tablespoonfuls of good gravy, or raw cream; boil for two or three minutes longer, stirring, and thickening (off the fire), with three yolks of eggs ; the preparation should be kept of a nice consistence. Let it cool, then divide it into bits the size of a nut, which place distantly on a flat of ‘ravioli’-paste (sec No. 983). Wet the intervals with a paste-brush, cover the flat with another of the same size, fasten the paste between the ‘ravioli’ with the back of a cutter; cut, and plunge them into salted boiling water, giving them two or three minutes of a gentle ebullition ; drain them afterwards, range them by layers on a dish, sprinkling over grated parmesan, and basting them with a little good tomata-sauce, mixed up with nut-brown clarified butter (beurre à la noisette). 1043. Dolmas of cabbage, Turkish fashion. — Remove the white leaves of a large cabbage, blanch them in boiling water for a few minutes only; refresh, and let them drain ; spread them on a cloth, remove all the tough parts. Take a pound of fillet of mutton, from which remove the sinews ; chop the meat very fine, put it into a kitchen-basin, add thereto two handfuls of rice very slightly blanched, a little onion, and a pinch of chopped parsley ; season the preparation with salt and pepper. Cut some pieces.of cabbage-leaves; on the centre of each, place a little bit ot the raw-mince, the size of a filbert, and wrap it up carefully. Place these ‘dolmas’, pressing them close, in a stewpan more high than broad ; range five or six rows, one over the other, seasoning each row ; now moisten the ‘dolmas’ nearly to height with broth, cover them with a plate, in order to press them still more; let the liquid be three-parts reduced, then remove the stewpan back on a moderate fire. Twenty minutes after, take the ‘dolmas’, one by one, and dish them, in a pyra- mid-shape, on a dish. Pass their cooking-stock through a sieve, let it boil up, thicken it with five or six yolks of eggs, diluted with the juice of a few lemons ; pour this sauce over the ‘dolmas’, which serve without delay.465 ENTREMETS. — VEGETABLES. 1044. ‘Dolmas’, Greek fashion. — Slip off, one by one, the leaves of a white cabbage; wash, and boil them in salted water for twenty-five minutes; drain them afterwards, refresh them in cold water, and dry them on a cloth. Prepare a pound and a quarter of force-meat, composed of fat bacon, and the same volume of lean mutton, chopped together very fine ; adding to it a handful of bread-crumbs, two eggs, a pinch of onion, a tew tablespoonfuls of chopped mush- rooms, and a little parsley. With this preparation, and the cabbage-leaves, prepare about thirty ‘dolmas’ the size of a walnut; range them in a ‘sauté’-pan, one beside ; the other; salt, baste with butter, moisten to half with broth; cover, and boil them quickly, until their moisture be reduced to a glaze ; then remove the stewpan back. On the other hand, prepare a ‘risot’ with ten ounces of rice ; which finish with butter, and grated parmesan. Mask the bottom and sides of a ‘timbale’-mould with tender and large cabbage-leaves, pared of the hard ribs ; spread then the bottom- leaves with a layer of ‘risot’, about one inch thick ; baste with a little tomata-sauce, and on it place ten ‘dolmas’ slightly flattened ; sprinkle over a little grated parmesan, and cover them with ‘risot’; continue thus, alternating the ‘dolmas’ and rice, until the mould be filled up ; apply on the top a cabbage-leaf, and on it thin slices of fat bacon. Push the mould into a moderate oven, stewing the ‘dolmas’ for one hour; then drain the fat, remove the bacon, and turn the ‘timbale’ out on a dish. Glaze the leaves with a paste-brush. 1045. ‘Calalou à l’Orientale’. — It would be difficult to tell the origin of this dish, eaten all over the East, and even in India; I can only say, it was intro- duced into the epicurean city of Marseille, by the rich Greek families established there, who have also introduced to the south of France, one of the indispensable elements of its preparation : the ‘gombo’, that excellent vegetable, which has already found its way to Paris, where in a short time it will hold firm footing. Cut the two ends of two dozen gombos, let them macerate in salt for a quarter of an hour , wash them afterwards in warm water, and boil them quickly in salted water, keeping them green. Boil, likewise in salted water, a few handfuls offender french-beans. Cut in oblong squares a couple of egg-plants, or mad-apples, and macerate them, to extract the water. Split in the middle four or five good tomatas, freed of the pips, and cut them in bits. Remove the stem, and core, of a few green sweet ‘poivrons’, slice the fiesh lengthwise, and fry them for five minutes. Slice two onions, put them into a frying-pan with oil, fry them without allowing them to take color ; add to them the ‘poivrons’, half cooking them, and tossing fre- quently ; add the egg-plants, and a few minutes after, the tomatas ; fry the vegetables, until their moisture be evaporated ; introduce into them the beans, season with salt, a little cayenne, a little parsley, chopped, with a point of garlic ; at the last moment 30466 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. acid the ‘gumbos’, previously warmed-up in a frying-pan with oil ; whole, if small, or if large, cut in thick slices; two minutes after, dish the ‘calalou’. 1046. Gratified tomatas. — Get some quite ripe middling-sized tomatas; split them in the middle, press the seed out, season with salt and pepper, and mask the cut side with a small preparation, composed of rasped bread-crumbs, a little chopped union and parsley ; range them in a ‘gratin’-dish, one beside the other, baste with oil and butter, bake them in a moderate oven, and them send up in the ‘gratin dish, without any addition.. 1047. Omelet with tomatas, Provence fashion. — Peel three or four quite ripe tomatas of firm flesh; split them in two, extract carefully the seed, and divide them into small squares. Put into a thin stewpan two tablespoonfuls of fine chopped onion, which fry with oil or butter, and when of a nice color, add to it the tomatas ; which cook on a brisk fire, to reduce their moisture ; season, and at last add to it a tablespoonful of chopped parsley. Break eight or ten eggs into an earthen pan, season, and beat them up. Warm some butter in an omelet-pan, pour in the beaten eggs, stir them with a spoon, gather them on one side of the pan, and spread, on the centre of the omelet, the cooked tomatas ; now fold the omelet to an oblong shape, and turn it out on a small dish. The cooked tomatas may be mixed up with the eggs; but as it happens often, that the acerbity of the tomatas lets the eggs curdle in cooking, it is preferable to add them later; particularly if tomatas of the North, which are always more acrid than those of the South. 1048. Carrots and green-pease, Alsace fashion. — Peel three dozen small young carrots, leaving them whole, blanch them for a few minutes in salted water; drain, put them into a stewpan with butter; toss them on a moderate tire, season, and moisten with a little broth, to half-cook. Add to them a pint and a half ot green-pease, a bunch of parsley, and a pinch of sugar. Cover the stewpan ; when the pease are done, thicken the vegetables with a piece of kneaded-butter, finish ; intro ducing, off the tire, two tablespoonfuls of good raw cream, and a piece of butter; then dish them up. 1049. Carrots and asparagus, German fashion. — Turn three or four dozen small young carrots of an equal size ; blanch, drain, and put them into a stewpan with butter, to fry on a moderate tire; season, when done, thicken with a little ‘velouté’ ; two minutes after, add the same volume of white or violet sprew-asparagus, cut up in pieces an inch long, blanched in salted water, and well drained. Season, and mix with the vegetables, a piece of butter, divided in little hits467 ENTREMETS. — VEGETABLES. 1050. Spanish ‘menestra’. — Get some various vegetables ; such as tender artichokes, lettuces, green-pease, broacl beans, asparagus, french-beans, red sweet ‘poivrons’, and specially some Spanish truffles (mcmcqirillos). Pick, and pare these vegetables, as they variously require; blanch them (except the truffles) separately, and keep them on a sieve. Chop one onion, put it into a stewpan with lard, which fry without allowing to take color ; add to it half a pound of raw ham cut in squares, sprinkle over a pinch of flour, and moisten with gravy or broth, stirring the sauce, until boiling; it should be thin ; at the first bubbling, remove the pan on a moderate fire, and add, by turns, the vegetables, beginning by those taking more time ; add a bunch of parsley, gar- nished with a bay-leaf, and continue cooking the vegetables, without touching them with a spoon. Season them, when done ; drain them gently on a sieve, placed over a flat stewpan, thus preserving the sauce; which reduce, until well thickened, and succulent; then add to it the minced truffles, boiling them for two seconds, pour the vegetables into the sauce, and warm them. Now dish them up, and surround with bread-‘croutons’. 1051. Mussaca, Moldavian fashion. — Procure five or six egg-plants (aubergines), cut each of them in two, diminish a little their thickness lengthwise: salt them, extract the water, wipe, and fry them on both sides, draining them after- wards on a sieve. Peel five or six egg-plants more, cut them in slices rather thick, let them macerate with salt for a few minutes ; wash, dry them on a cloth ; flour, and fry them on both sides, until about done, and drain on them a sieve. On the other hand, pare and bone half a loin of mutton ; cut the flesh transver- sally into scollops, which fry quickly, with a little lard, and a few trimmings of ham ^ and bacon : season, and let cool. Chop two onions, fry them in a stewpan, without allowing to take color ; add to them a few handfuls of chopped mushrooms, reduce their moisture, and remove the stewpan back, adding the vegetables and chopped mutton. Sprinkle over the preparation a handful of bread-crumbs, and a little parsley, and thicken it with an egg. Mask the bottom and sides of a ‘charlotte’-mould rubbed with lard, with the l half egg-plants, pressing them close one against the other, leaving no opening ; and till the cavity, by layers, with the sliced egg-plants, alternating them with the force- I meat. The mould being full, cover it on the top with a round piece of buttered paper, keep it in the Oven (at a moderate heat), for three quarters of an hour ; when done, turn the ‘entremets’ out on a dish. 1052. Egg-plants (aubergines), with parmesan. — Peel half a dozen tender egg-plants ; cut up the flesh in slices, sprinkle them over with salt, thus to extract the water; drain, and fry them, over a brisk fire, until about done ; season, 30*468 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. and thicken slightly with a little ‘béchamel-sauce; place them, by layers, in a ‘gratin’- dish, sprinkling over each layer a little grated parmesan, sprinkle also on the top, baste them with melted butter, and push the dish into a moderate oven, gratinating the egg-plants for a quarter of an hour. 1053. Egg-plants, Turkish fashion. — Egg-plants play a great part in Turkish cookery, and are prepared in a great number of ways. Get seven or eight small egg-plants, cut off both ends, scoop out the interior tlesli with a vegetable-spoon ; chop, and mix it with the same wolume of raw chopped mutton, and the same of raw rice ; season the farce, and till the egg-plants ; score the skin transversally, and thrust into these incisions a little minced onion. Plunge the egg-plants into hot dripping fat ; two minutes after, drain, and place them, one beside the other, in a stewpan ; moisten to height with thin tomata-sauce, cook them, over a very slow lire, with hot ashes on the lid ; then dish up, and baste them with their own stock. 1054. ‘Timbale’ Of sour-crout. — Cut up in slices about a pound and a half of loin of fresh pork, previously trimmed of the sinewy and hard parts ; season with salt and pepper. Cook two pounds of sour-crout (see No. 839) with ten ounces of streaky bacon, previously blanched ; when three-parts done, drain it on a colander, as well as the bacon, and let it cool. Line a ‘timbale’-mould with short-paste ; which mask at the bottom, and all round, with a layer of raw pork-mince (see No. 686) pounded with a raw truffle; thereon arrange in layers the sour-crout, the bacon, and the slices of fresh pork ; cover the top with a flat of paste, push the ‘timbale’ into a moderate oven, to bake for an hour and a half, taking care to cover it with paper, as soon as the paste begins to take color. When taken from the oven, turn the ‘timbale’ out on a dish, make a round opening on the top, thro’ which pour in a few table- spoonfuls of brown-sauce, reduced with wine, and mixed up with a few truffles in small dice. 1055. ‘Culibiac’ of cabbage, Russ fashion. — Take half a white cabbage, pare away the core, and chop it. Chop one onion, put it into a stewpan with butter, fry it without allowing to take color ; add to it the cabbage ; a few minutes after, season, and draw it over a moderate fire ; when its moisture is evaporated, thicken with a little sauce, and a small piece of kneaded-butter ; add to it five or six cold hard-boiled eggs, chopped with parsley. On the other hand, prepare a ‘culibiac’-paste (No. 215), roll it on an oblong square, set the cabbage on the centre of the paste, the edges of which wet, and form the pie ; keep it, for three quarters of an hour, at the temperature of the kitchen ; egg, sprinkle469 ENTREMETS. — VEGETABLES. j over a little bread-crumb, and push it into a moderate oven, baking for one hour. When done, moisten with butter, and dish up. 1056. Cardoons, with marrow (D. 207). — Take the white stems from one or two heads of cardoons, divide them in pieces six inches long ; peel away the tibrous skin, and plunge them into cold acidulous water ; after which blanch them, for a quarter of an hour, in a covered stewpan ; then drain, and steep them in cold water ; drain again, to place them in a stewpan ; moisten to height with a glass Fig. 207. of white wine, fresh broth, and toppings ; add to the liquid the juice of two or three lemons, a bit of kneaded-butter (the size of a nut), peppercorns and cloves ; cover the cardoons with bacon and buttered paper; boil them over a moderate lire, with the stewpan covered. When ready to serve, drain the liquid off the stewpan, take up the pieces of car- doons, one by one, without breaking them, range them, in a pyramid-shape, on a stewpan cover, pare both ends square, and slip them on a dish ; then cut them in the centre, dividing the pyramid; porn’ over a little brown-sauce, reduced with wine, and surround them with small puff-paste patties, garnished with marrow. Send up separately a boatful of the same sauce. 1057. Brunswick salad< — Peel a fresh and tender celery-root, cut it in fine shreds, season, and let it macerate for a quarter of an hour. Peel four raw [ truffles, put them into a stewpan, with a quarter of a glass of madeira, boil them for three minutes ; let them cool, and cut them in shreds. Pass through a sieve the yolks of four or five hard-boiled eggs, put them into a kitchen-basin, the bottom of which has been rubbed with a clove of garlic ; mash them with a spoon, thus forming a smooth paste ; to which add a tablespoonhd of good mustard, and dilute it with half a glass of oil, and a little vinegar. Season, introduce into it the celery (having previously extracted their moisture), and the i truffles ; sprinkle over the salad a pinch of chopped taragon, and chives ; serve it in I a salad-bowl.470 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 1058. Croquettes of potatoes. — Boil some peeled potatoes, allow them to dry ; pass them through a sieve, put the ‘purée’ into a stewpan, with a piece of butter, and work it with a spoon, introducing into it six yolks of eggs, and four ounces of butter ; keep the preparation firm, season with salt and nutmeg, pour it on a floured table, and roll it to the shape of a sausage; divide this piece again into small pieces, with which form some ‘croquettes’, either of a round, or a cork-like shape; dip them into beaten eggs, bread-crumb, and fry them in plenty of dripping. 1059. ‘Timbale’ of potatoes. — Boil in salted water about a quart of peeled potatoes ; when done, drain off the water, and let them dry, for a few minutes, at the entrance of the oven ; then pass them through a sieve. Put this ‘purée’ into a stewpan, season with salt and nutmeg, add to it eight ounces of butter in little hits, two whole and four yolks of eggs, and at last a handful of grated parmesan, and the fillets of six anchovies cut up in pieces. Butter a ‘timbale’-mould, bread-crumb it, and pour the preparation into the mould, to bake for twenty-five minutes in a moderate oven. The mould being taken out of the oven, slip the blade of a knife between the ‘timbale’, loosening it, and turn it out on a hot dish. 1060. Hanover-potatoes. — Cut round three dozen small potatoes, wash, put them into a stewpan, moisten to height with broth, and boil them, covered, on a good fire ; when done, the broth should be reduced. Season the potatoes, add to them four ounces of butter in little bits, as well as a pinch of chopped parsley. Serve immediately. 1061. Potato-salad, with herrings. — This salad is a popular dish of Germany : prepared with the required care, it is excellent. Boil about fifteen potatoes with the peel on ; when done, peel, and cut them up in dice; cut equally in dice two sour apples, a few gerkins, and the fillets of two or three pickled herrings, previously steeped and cleansed. Season first the potatoes, in a kitchen-basin, with salt and pepper, toss them up, pour over oil and vinegar; when well mixed up, add the sour apples, gerkins, herrings, and a tablcspoonful of onion, chopped very fine; at last, add a few tablespoonfuls of pickled beet- roots, also in dice; mix these ingredients well up, by tossing in a salad-bowl, and dish them up. 1062. ‘Cèpes au gratin’. — Pare and wash some ‘cèpes’, trim away their stalks, mince the beads, and put them into a frying-pan, with a few tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley, and oil or butter, to fry them on a brisk fire; season with salt and pepper, when their moisture is reduced, thicken them with ‘béchamel-sauce, or simply with a piece of kneaded-butter; add a pinch of chopped parsley, let the sauceENTREMETS. — POTATOES, MUSHROOMS. 471 boil, and pour the mince into a gratin-dish; then spread over the top the stalks chop- ped, and fried in butter; sprinkle the surface with bread-crumbs, baste with butter, ! and push the ‘gratin’ into a moderate oven for twenty minutes. 1063. Fried potatoes (D. 208). — Get some good white potatoes, peel and cut them into thin slices, which divide in square fillets, as much as possible | of the same length ; wash, wipe them on a cloth, and place them in a frying-basket. Fig. 208. Warm some dripping fat* in a frying-pan; as soon as beginning to smoke, plunge it in the frying-basket with the potatoes; toss them from time to time, and | when dried, and of a nice color, drain, salt them slightly, and dish up on a folded i napkin. 1064. Mushroom-pie, Russ fashion. — The sort of mushrooms, called ‘cèpes’ in France, go in Russia by the. name of gribouis: they arc plentiful, and of an excellent quality; the Russians, and Poles, making great use of them: either fresh or dry, they arc eaten all the year round. Russia produces a great variety of i mushrooms ; in Autumn the markets abound with them, and I there saw species I commonly selling, the appearance of which was any thing but inviting ; yet the Rus- ; sians cat them without fear, and it must be inferred, without danger or injury. Get large and fleshy ‘cèpes’ ; trim their stalks away, as they are generally hard ; pare, and cut them in two ; put the pieces into a frying-pan, with butter or oil, 1 season with salt and pepper, fry them on a brisk fire for a few minutes only, diminishing their volume, and then take them off the fire. Spread the bottom of a pie-dish with a few slices of raw ham; whereon place the j ‘cèpes’, by layers, alternating with chopped onion, parsley, and a little fennel ; press them close together, mask also the top with slices of ham, and then baste with two * The fat for frying may indifferently be hog’s lard, oil, or clarified toppings of stock. But whatever its nature be, let it be fresh and clean. In a kitchen there should always be handy two frying-pans ; one for fish, the other for vegetables, and fried ‘entremets’.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 472 tablespoonfuls of light brown-sauce ; line the rim of the dish with short-paste, and cover the pic, proceeding as said in No. 596 ; set it on a baking-sheet, and push it into a moderate oven, to bake for one hour. 1065. White truffles. — It is Piémont, which produces these excellent truffles, of a particular species so highly esteemed by epicures. It is a peculiarity of these truffles, that they do not need cooking. Wash, and wipe the truffles, remove the black spots on their surface with a small knife, mince them as fine as possible, warm them simply, and at the moment, in the sauce, or with the garnish, with which they are to be served, but without letting them boil. White truffles are also served for a salad ; in this case, having minced them, warm a little oil with a few fillets of anchovies passed through a sieve ; and the oil being hot, add the truffles, season, and take them off the fire, giving them a few jerks. 1066. Black truffles, ‘au gratin’. — Get seven or eight nice round raw truffles, cut them in two, and scoop them with a vegetable-spoon ; cut up in dice the flesh of the truffles taken out, add to them the same volume of cooked fat-liver, season the preparation, thicken it with a little reduced brown-sauce, and fill with it the halves of truffles ; sprinkle over a little bread-crumb, baste with a little butter ; then range them, one beside the other, in a flat stewpan with a little wine; let the wine boil up, then push the stewpan into the oven ; [ten minutes after, dish the truffles up. 1067. Black-truffies-pudding. — Pound in the mortar eight ounces oi raw pork-mince (hachis), with four ounces of raw ham cut in small dice; add to the mince eight ounces of raw fat-liver, season highly, and pass it through a sieve. Brush, and peel, about a pound of good fresh truffles, cut them up in slices, not too thin; put them into a kitchen-basin, and season with salt and pepper. Pour into a stewpan three parts of a glass of madeira, add to it a handful of truffles’ trimmings, reduce to half, and pass it through a sieve ; then add to it a third its volume of meat- glaze. Let the liquid boil, and thicken it with a little bit of kneaded-butter: the sauce should be kept rather thick. Butter a tinned dome-shaped mould, thin, and rather wide; if not handy, take a roubd-bottomed bowl, which line inwardly with suet-paste, and spread with a thin layer of the prepared mince; then place in the cavity the truffles, in close layers, pouring over each a little of the cold sauce. Mask the top layer of truffles with the remainder of the mince, and this with a flat of paste, soldering it to that of the sides. Moisten the centre of a napkin, press it out, butter and flour it; applying it, on its473 ENTREMETS. — TRUFFLES. floured side, directly on the paste; securing it, underneath the mould, with string. Now plunge the mould into boiling water, cover the pan, and keep the liquid boiling for an hour and a half ; then drain the mould, take off the napkin, turn the pudding- out on a dish, glaze it with a paste-brush, and send up separately some thin ma- deira-sauce. 1068. ‘Timbale’ of truffles, à la Périgord. — Peel about fifteen nice Périgord truffles, previously brushed and washed; cut them in quarters, put them into a kitchen-basin, season with salt and pepper, baste with a few tablespoonfuls of cognac, and add to it a few sprigs of parsley and thyme; cover the basin, and keep it in a cool place. Take up only half of the truffle-trimmings, pound them, add a pound of fresh rasped bacon, season the preparation with salt and pepper; pass it through a sieve, without pressing too much : the truffles’ trimmings ought not to be pressed, as noth- ing of them is wanted, but their aroma. Butter a ‘timbale’-mould, bread-crumb, and line it with fine short-paste ; mask the bottom and sides of the paste, with three parts of the bacon passed through the sieve ; pour the truffles into the hollow, baste them with a paste-brush dipped in melted glaze ; cover with the remainder of the bacon, and close the ‘timbale’ with a round of paste, which solder to that of the sides ; then push the mould into a hot oven, and bake the ‘timbale’ for fifty or sixty minutes, taking care not to let the paste take too much color. On the other hand, reduce, one third, two or three gills of brown-sauce ; adding, by degrees, half a glass of madeira, the cooking of the truffles, and a few table- spoonfuls of melted glaze. When the sauce is about reduced, add the remainder of the truffles’ trimmings, and two minutes after, pass it through a fine sieve. When the ‘timbale’ is taken out of the oven, make an opening on the top, pour the pre- pared sauce in, stop the opening, and turn the ‘timbale’ out on a hot dish. 1069. Truffle-salad, Toulouse fashion. — Get five or six fresh black truffles, of a good aroma, and three very tender artichokes. Brush the truffles care- fully, wash, peel, mince them very fine, and put them into a vase, which cover. Pare away the hard leaves from the artichokes, keeping only the very tender ones ; which divide down the middle, and cut into slices as thin as that of the truffles, let them macerate in salt for ten minutes ; wipe them on a cloth. Pass through a sieve three yolks of hard-boiled eggs, put them into a basin, add a little mustard, dilute with a gill of fine salad-oil, and a little taragon-vinegar. Arrange into a salad-bowl the truffles and artichokes, in alternate layers, seasoning each layer with salt and pepper, and with a part of the eggs diluted with oil. TenCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 474 minutes after, toss truffles and artichokes (in the salad-bowl), thus mixing the seasoning well up. This salad is indeed worthy of bearing a great name. 1070. Salad of black truffles, Russ fashion. — Peel a few raw truf- fles, put them into a stewpan, with a little madeira ; salt, and boil for four minutes ; then mince them, put them into a kitchen-basin, season, and pour over a little oil; cover them, and keep them thus for ten minutes. Sprinkle over a pinch of taragon, chives, and parsley chopped. Thicken the salad with a few tablespoonfuls of mayonnaise-sauce, then dish up in the salad-bowl, and mask it with a layer of mayonnaise-sauce, finished with a tablespoonful of mustard. 1071. Gratinated truffles, with cream. — Peel five or six ràw, well cleansed truffles ; with the trimmings, a little madeira, and a few aromatics, pre- pare a little extract. Pour into a flat stewpan half a pint of good ‘bechamel-sauce : which reduce, and introduce into it, by degrees, the extract of truffles. On the other hand, cut the truffles in small dice, which put into a stewpan with clarified butter; season, and warm quickly; then thicken with the reduced sauce, thus getting a solid preparation, with which fill five or six table-shells ; sprinkle over some bread-crumbs ; baste with butter, and give them a nice color, in a hot oven, or with a red-hot salamander. 1072. ‘Rissoles’, With truffles. — Peel a few middling-sized fresh truf- fles, cut them up in small dice ; which put into a stewpan, with a few tablespoonfuls of madeira ; season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg ; boil them for two minutes. On the other hand, put into a stewpan a few tablespoonfuls of brown-sauce, rather thick, with half its volume of meat-glaze ; reduce to half, introduce into it the liquor of the truffles ; a few minutes after, add the truffles, take the pan off the fire, and pour the preparation into a kitchen-basin, to cool ; the sauce should be short and thick, so as when cold, to form with the truffles a compact preparation, which divide in round bits the size of a nut ; place these pieces on the edge of a flat of trimmings of puff-paste, and prepare the ‘rissoles’, proceeding as said in No. 820 ; bread-crumb, fry, drain, and dish them up on a folded napkin. 1073. Hot-bed mushrooms, with butter. — The mushrooms (cham- pignons), cultivated in the quarries near Paris, are generally of a good quality, leaving nothing to desire, as to taste, aroma, and whiteness; when cooked in their state of primitive freshness. These mushrooms are a great resource for the Paris kitchens, as they are to be purchased fresh, all the year round. These mushrooms have also the advantage over other species, that they may be eaten fearlessly. Choose mushrooms with short stalks, firm, and of equal size. Cut up the stalks to the level of the heads ; which wash, and pare with a small knife, removing their,475 TRUFFLES, MUSHROOMS. ENTREMETS. i skin ; place them in a stewpan, with some melted butter, mixed up with lemon-juice; j add a little salt, and cook the mushrooms for live minutes, drain them, reduce their liquor to half, and thicken the liquid with a piece of kneaded-butter ; add a pinch of | chopped parsley, and pour the sauce over the mushrooms. The mushrooms may be also cooked with the peel on, but as the peel and stalks will always find their place, it is best to pare them. Mushrooms, thus cooked, simply | with butter, may serve also as a garnish. 1074. Hot-bed mushrooms, farced. — Get two dozen line large mushrooms, cut their stalks away ; wash, and empty them, on the stalk side, with a ! vegetable-spoon ; salt slightly, and throw them on a sieve. Put into a stewpan a few tablespoonfuls of chopped onion and shalot, fry them with butter or oil; add the stalks and the trimmings of mushrooms, moreover a few small mushrooms, kept whole for the purpose; all of which chopped. As soon as their moisture is evaporated, season with salt and pepper, add a pinch of chopped parsley; two minutes afterwards, add to the tine-herbs, the same volume of rasped bread-crumb, and two tablespoonfuls of brown or tomata-sauce ; then take the pan off the tire, thicken the preparation with a few yolks of eggs, fill the mushrooms, smoothing the preparation on the top, sprinkle over bread-crumbs, place them on a baking-sheet, baste with oil or melted butter, and bake them in a moderate oven for half an hour ; then dish them up- 1075. Purée Of mushrooms. — Take two or three handfuls of fresh, peeled, and well-washed mushroom-stalks ; chop them fine, put them into a stewpan, with a piece of butter, and a grain of salt ; cover, and reduce their moisture on a brisk fire; pour them into a mortar, add a piece of butter, and one of meat-glaze ; pound, and then mix them with a little ‘béchamel’-sauce (about two gills) ; when the preparation is well thickened, pass it through a sieve. 1076. Andalusian gaspachio. — Gaspachio is a salad of raw vege- tables, highly esteemed by the Andalusians ; who in summer partake of it daily, considering it very refreshing. Mince one of the large Spanish white onions, without smell, and so sweet to the I taste. Mince also a peeled fresh cucumber. Split in two, on the centre, three nice good tomatas, fleshy, and without acerbity, such as arc found in the southern provinces of Spain, from Sevilla to Valencia; remove their seed, peel, and cut them up in pieces. Place the vegetables in a bowl, by alternate layers, sprinkling over j first salt and pepper, and then crumbled bread-crumbs ; baste them with vinegar ; and oil. Place the bowl in a very cool place : one hour after, the vegetables will lie found softened. Serve the ‘gaspachio’ in the same bowl.SWEET ENTREMÊTS, PASTRY, ICES, COMPOTES. Sweet ‘entremets’ are included in the arrangement of a dinner by the same right as all the other dishes [mets). In a classical dinner, the sweet ‘entremets’ must of' necessity be equal in number to the cold or warm ‘entrées’ ; but in many cases, ‘entremets’ of vegetables may be allowed to help the number of the sweet ones : a dinner without sweet ‘entremets’ can never be considered a complete, a perfect dinner. Sweet ‘entremets’ are common to all nations, where gastronomy is of any importance. I have even had occasion to observe, that this dish is not only highly appreciated every where, but that it is even the one usually most carefully managed by the cooks. In this chapter I include all sweet dishes, cold or warm, served at the conclusion of a dinner. I have even, from my desire to render this chapter more complete and useful, added ices and compotes. A cook certainly is not always bound to prepare the ices served at a dinner ; this being a thing for him sometimes quite impossible ; but nevertheless it is unques- tionably highly requisite for him, to be thoroughly well acquainted with this manipulation, and also to be able, in case of need, to prepare them for himself; if an occasion should, as in the course of his career it often will arise, for utilising all such points of culinary knowledge. The series of‘entremets’ here given is relatively a very numerous one; for the greatest part they are simple, and of very easy preparation, only a few of them being more complicated and luxurious. By these few pro- ducts of higher order, it has been my wish to initiate novices into that I ‘coquetterie’ of work, which always gives a higher finish and relief to the physiognomy of a dinner.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 478 1077. ‘Crêpes’ of the Marchioness. — With ‘crêpes’ it is the same as with ‘blinis’ : they must be eaten immediately, when ready. The best means to get them hot is, preparing and sending them to table half at a time. Put into a kitchen-basin half a pound of flour, a little salt, and three or four whole eggs ; introduce the eggs into the flour, by aid of a spoon, but proceeding so as to get a smooth paste of rather high consistence ; so far dilute the paste gradually with half a glassful of milk; the milk being introduced, the paste should he very slightly thickened, and liquid. Melt half a pound of good butter, which pour into a small stewpan, decanting it; then let it cook till slightly brown (à la noisette). Warm a frying-pan for pancakes, moisten the bottom with a tablespoonful of clarified buttèr ; as soon as this is warm, pour some paste on the pan, in a sufficient quantity to mask the bottom with a thin layer ; as soon as the ‘crêpe’ begins cooking, thrust a fork into the bubbles, and turn the pan vigorously round on itself, to prevent its sticking to the pan ; a few seconds after, turn the ‘crêpe’ over, by giving it a jerk with a quick and combined motion of the hand, to get it to fall down quite unfolded. Moisten the pan also with a paste- brush dipped in butter, thus cooking the ‘crêpe’ on its other surface, without ceasing to move the pan. Slip the ‘crêpe’ on to a hot plate, sift over a little powdered sugar. 1078. Raspberry-tart. — Select fresh, well ripened raspberries, remove their stalks, place them in layers on a tart-dish, sprinkling over each of these layers with a handful of powder-sugar. Raise the fruit in a dome-like shape above the level of the dish, and sprinkle it over also with powder-sugar. Moisten the edges of the dish, and mask it all round with a strip of tart-paste, which moisten; mask the fruit with a large round of paste, which fix on to the base of the dome of fruit, with the tip of the finger, then fix it on to the rim of the dish, soldering it to the under- most strip of paste. Cut and channel it all round, moisten, sprinkle over sugar, bake the tart for forty-five minutes, then let it cool. 1079. Macédoine of peaches (D. 210). — Get eight or ten large peaches, being not over-ripe, divide each of them in two pieces, remove the stones. Pare the finest pieces round, plunge them into boiling water, wherein leave them until their skin is easily to be removed : a few moments will do. Drain them immediately, place them in a kitchen-basin, and cover with cold vanilla-syrup: wherein let them macerate for one hour. With the other pieces of peaches prepare a ‘purée’; which, when passed through a sieve, mix with a glassful of sweet jelly. Boil in plenty of water, a quarter of a pound of rice ; drain, put it into a basin, pour over syrup with vanilla. Take a vegetable-spoon, with it cut out little balls of479 SWEET ENTREMETS. — FRUIT, PASTRY. apples, boil them very slightly in light syrup ; drain, place them in a basin, add a few drops of clarified carmine, as well as two tablespoonfuls of vanilla-syrup. Let them macerate for half an hour. Half an hour previous to serving, drain the peaches, thicken the ‘purée’, stirring it on ice ; add the rice, being well drained. With this preparation fill the hollow of the halves of peaches, adorn them with the (balls of apples drained and cut in two. Mask the decoration with half-set jelly, dish the peaches on a gum-paste bottom, having a small support on its centre : seven or eight of them in a circle, one in the middle'; garnish the bottom of the dish with fine ‘croûtons’ of orange-jelly. 1080. Pancakes with ginger (D. 211). — Pound in a moytar a quarter of a pound of preserved ginger ; when converted into paste, add six table- spoonfuls of ‘frangipane’, and pass it through a sieve. Put a quarter of a pound of flour into a kitchen-basin, with four ounces of sugar, and a little salt; dilute this preparation with six whole eggs, and a glass of milk; add a quarter of a pound of butter melted, the rasped zest of half a lemon. Work the preparation hard, until quite smooth ; if it will not come so, it must be passed through a sieve. Melt a quarter of a pound of butter, to clarify it ; and keep it on the side of the tire, in a little stewpan. Heat a little frying-pan for pancakes, butter it with a paste- brush dipped in the clarified butter, pour two tablespoonfuls of the paste into the Fig. 210. Fig. 211.

When the preparation is all made use of, mask the pancakes, one by one, with a thin layer of the preparation, giving them the breadth of two inches, folding them once more lengthwise, thus forming a longish square ; arrange them in a close circle on a dish, adorn them with ‘meringue’, push the dish into a moderate oven ; then, ornament the ‘meringue’ with preserved fruits or confitures, surround the ‘entremet’, at its base, with a circle of greengages. 1081. Roman-cake. — This is an ‘entremet’ of Italy, very highly thought of in that country. The Italians prepare it with great care and attention. Frangipane. — Break four eggs into a kitchen-basin, add four ounces of Hour (half wheat, half rice) the same of sugar, vanillas or zest, a little salt; pass this preparation, through a sieve, into a kitchen-basin; add a quarter of a pound of good butter, thicken it over the fire, stirring continually. Prepare a biscuit-paste with a pound of sugar, twelve ounces of flour, and and fifteen eggs. Bake it in a ‘timbale’- mould ; when cold, divide it into four pieces, each of which cut up in slices. The ‘frangipane’ being cold, divide it in two parts, each of which put into a little basin, thus to perfume them, the one with vanilla, the other with almonds peeled and passed through a sieve. Mask the bottom of a dish with a layer of ‘frangipane’. Pour on three different plates, rum, ‘maraschino’, and ‘rosolio’. Take four slices of biscuit, let some soak in rum, the others in the liqueurs; then range them, one by one, on the layer of ‘frangipane’. Mask them immediately with a layer of currant-jelly, sprinkle over preserved fruits cut up in very little dice. On this layer place again four slices of biscuit soaked in liqueurs, mask them with a layer of ‘frangipane’, sprinkle over fruits ; and thus continne alternating ‘frangipane’, and jelly ; in this manner bringing the biscuit back to its original shape. Mask its surfaces either with jelly, or with ‘frangipane’, sprinkle over fruits, and at last, mask with a thick layer of Italian ‘meringue’; decorate, on the top and all around, with the cornet. Push the dish into a moderate oven, only for two minutes, this being the time requisite for setting the ‘meringue’, without allowing it to take color. The ‘meringue’ being well cooled, adorn it with preserved fruits and ‘confitures’. 1082. Russian wafers. — Bake some cream-wafers in a deep wafer-pan (see No. 1191), divide each of the wafers transversally in two, place them in layers on the bottom of a dish. Mask each of these layers with apricot-marmalade, thus filling the cavities of the wafers, which raise in a pyramid ; mask this pyramid with481 SWEET ENTREMETS. — TARTS.

Apple-tart, Westfalian fashion. —r Peel and mince about fifteen good apples, fry them quickly with butter, but so as to get them soft without breaking; thicken the apples with four tablespoonfuls of apricot-marmalade and put them into a tart-dish. On the other hand, work a quarter of a pound of butter with a spoon, and thicken it like cream ; then add to it, one by one, four or five yolks of eggs ; this preparation being frothy, introduce into it two whites of eggs, and a quarter of a pound of grated pumpernickel-bread-crumb, passed through a sieve, as well as six ounces of powder-sugar, flavored with vanilla ; with this preparation mask the apples, smooth them on the top with the blade of a knife, sift over a little sugar, keep the dish in a moderate oven for twenty-five minutes. 1084. Apple-tart, Flemish fashion. — Cut in quarters about fifteen good apples, peel them, remove the pips and core; mince, and put them into a flat stewpan with butter, toss them on a brisk fire ; add sugar, and reduce their moisture. As soon as sufficiently done, without breaking, put them into a tart-disli; smooth them with the blade of a knife, raising them in a dome-like shape, and thus let them cool. Now mask this dome with a layer of ‘frangipane’-cream with almonds, pre- pared after the receipt given No. 1080, but kept of a nice consistence; mask the I cream with a very thin layer of ‘meringue’ ; apply on the top a little decoration, by aid of a cornet ; sprinkle over a little tine sugar, keep the tart in a very moderate oven for twenty minutes. 1085. Black-plum-tart. — Peel (when raw) four or five dozen whole black plums, without removing the stones ; place them in layers on a tart-dish, sprinkling over powder-sugar ; mask the rim of the dish with a strip of fine short- paste, and cover it over with a round of the same paste. Channel its edges, moisten slightly the top of the tart, sprinkle over tine sugar, bake it in a moderate oven for forty-five minutes. 1086. Marrow-tart. — Break four whole eggs into a kitchen-basin, mix them up with a quarter of a pound of flour, a little salt ; dilute this with three gills of milk ; mix this preparation up with a whip, pass it through a sieve into a stewpan ; add a piece of butter, and thicken it, stirring over the fire, without allowing it to get lumpy. As soon as the cream is well thickened, add nearly half a pound of dissolved sugar, part of which is flavored with vanilla ; work for seven or eight minutes more over the fire, thus to reduce the preparation. Remove it back, and introduce two tablespoonfuls of milk of almonds, half a pound of chopped, melted beef-marrow, 31COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 482 passed through a sieve ; work this cream for a few minutes, and let it cool. Prepare a puff-paste with more than half a pound of Hour, the same of butter, and the water requisite (sec No. 404) ; give it six turns, at the last turn lengthen out the flat, from fourteen to sixteen inches ; let it rest for a few minutes, then cut two strips length- wise, each about an inch broad, and one third thick. Break the trimmings of the paste, working them with flour : let this paste rest for a few minutes, then roll it out flat into a round, twelve inches in diameter, and of the thickness of a half-crown- piece. Spread it on a tart-pan (tourtière), cut round, moisten its edges with a paste- brush, then pour the cream on the centre, spreading it in a layer a third of an inch thick, following the outlines of the paste, but at least an inch distant from the edges. Place one of the strips of paste on the moistened edges of the flat, in a manner strictly following its outlines ; fix on the two ends of this strip with moistened fingers, soldering the second strip to this, and at the two ends. This done, color the upper surface of the strip, push the tart into a hot oven. The strip of puff-paste having well risen, being dry and of nice color, glaze it with sugar, and in like manner the cream ; two minutes after, take the tart out, and serve immediately ; as it loses all its best qualities, if not eaten hot. 1087. Tartlets of green gooseberries. — Spread about fifteen tart- let-moulds with sweetened tartlet-paste (see No. 1099), let them bake in a moderato oven without filling them; the paste having cooled, mask it within with a thin layer of marmalade. Plunge a few handfuls of green gooseberries, not yet ripe, but of full-grown shape, into boiling water; after the first bubbling, place them in a kitchen-basin, sprinkle over powder-sugar, and let them cool. Then take them out with a skimmer, and arrange them in a dome-like shape in the tartlets; mix in the liquid a little syrup, and reduce it, until of good consistence. When cold, take it up with a spoon, and mask with it the gooseberries. 1088. Wafers in cornets, with cream (D. 212). — Work in a kitchen-basin a quarter of a pound of powdered vanilla-sugar, and three whites of eggs; when this preparation is frothy, add about half a pound of flour, passed through a sieve and quite dry, as well as a pound of peeled and strained almonds : add moreover a little salt, one or two whites of eggs, but all of which by degrees, thus getting a liquid paste. Bake a little bit of it in the oven, to ascertain its goodness. Wax and flour some small baking-sheets ; mask them with the preparation, which spread out thin; bake it in a hot oven. When the preparation is taken out. divide it into squares of about five inches by three; lift these squares immediately from the baking-sheet, and roll them up into cornets, while the paste is hot.483 SWEET ENTREMETS. — TARTLETS, TARTS. Now bake the remainder of the preparation, whioh then likewise divide into squares. Fix on the centre of a dish, a decorated stand in gum-paste, hearing on its centre a small pyramid with two-'gradins’, jutting out a little above. Fix nine of Fig. 212. the cornets, one beside the other, round the lower 'gradin’, by the aid of 'cassé’-sugar, or icing-sugar ; ttx the remaining six against the second 'gradin’, and lastly, set the sixteenth on the top of all. When about to serve, fill the cornets with whipped cream, quite firm, and flavored with vanilla. 1089. Rhubarb-tart (D. 213). — Tcift-paste. — Pass a pound of fine Fig. 213. wheat-meal, through a sieve, on a table. Spread it out in a circle with the hand ; put into the cavity thus formed, a quarter of a pound of butter, divided in little bits, a little salt, three yolks of eggs, a quarter of a pound of powder-sugar, a few table- spoonful^ of water. Begin by mixing eggs and butter, then introduce the flour, by degrees, thus getting a smooth paste, the consistency of short-paste. Mould it, and let it rest for a quarter of an hour.484 C( )SMOPOLITAN COOKERY. Get some stalks of rhubarb well cleansed and tender, cut them transversally into sticks one or two inches long, divide these again into several pieces, which then place in layers on a tart-dish, sprinkling over each layer with good raw-sugar (cassonnado). Raise the rhubarb in a dome-like fashion above the level of the dish, and sprinkle its top also with ‘cassonnade'. Moisten the rim of the dish, mask it with a strip of the tart-paste; then cover the dome, and the rim of the dish, with a thin round of paste. Press the paste against the base of the dome, then on the rim of the dish, thus soldering it to the first applied strip of paste. Trim the paste all round the dish, channel it with the aid of a knife, moisten it on the top with liquid whites of eggs, sprinkle over powder-sugar, and bake it in a portable pastry-oven* for forty-five minutes. This tart may be served indifferently cold or warm, accompanied bv a little Tassonnade’. 1090. Macaroni-timbale, Italian-fashion. — Butter and bread-crumb a Timbale’-mould, spread it with tartlet-paste {sec No. 1099), which of course must be sweetened. Boil half a pound of thick macaroni in salt water : they must be very tender drain, and divide them into pieces two inches long. Put into a flat stewpan a glassful of good ‘béchamel’-sauce, which let reduce on the fire, stirring it ; gradually introduce into it a few spoonfuls of good gravy ; when of a nice flavor, take it off the fire, add to it the macaroni, as well as five ounces of good butter; season the preparation with a pinch of good cinnamon-powder, pour it into the case of paste, cover the Timbale’ with a flat of paste, and bake it in a moderate oven for three quarters of an hour. On taking it out of the oven, turn it out on a dish, slightly sprinkle over sugar, flavored with cinnamon ; and serve. At Rome they mix into the macaroni some cooked poultry-livers. I notice this addition without recommending it. 1091. Apple-‘timbale’, Milan fashion (D. 214). — Take a few good rennet-apples, each of which divide in pieces, peel them, removing the pips, mince, and put them into a flat stewpan ; add to them half a stick of vanilla, a piece of butter, and two handfuls of sugar. Toss them on a brisk fire, cooking them slightly, without breaking them ; this done, take them off the fire, mix with them * The oven here referred to, is made great use of in Paris, in those kitchens, which have not large ovens; it combines several advantages, the importance of which must be acknowledged; in the first place, it is not very expensive; it is also moveable and easily transported, it requires but very little feeding; and lastly, it can be heated in a very short time. For one, who understands the management of these ovens, it is quite easy to cook any sort of pastry. This oven is composed of an iron-case, or frame, having three openings on one front, of which one is for the fire-place, and the other two arranged as ovens: these ovens are lined inside with brick-work, and traversed by the pipe or chimney from the fire-place. The drawing (p. 47G) represents the oven, placed on a support in masonry; but it is not made fast to this support.SWEET ENTREMETS. 485 TIMBALE, TARTS. a handful of smyrna-raisins previously softened, and half this quantity of good preserved eedrat, eut in small dice : let the preparation cool. Prepare some short-paste, with twelve ounces of flour, eight ounces of butter, four ounces of sugar, two yolks of eggs, a little salt, and a little water; leave the paste to rest; then divide it into eight or ten parts, which roll, on the floured table, into strings of the thickness of thin macaroni. Butter thickly a dome-shaped mould, Fig. 214. then take one of the strings, the end of which place on the centre of the mould, arranging the string spirally (en colimaçon) against the sides of the mould. Con- tinue operating thus with the remainder of the paste, carefully soldering the ends of the strings of paste. Then moisten the paste with the aid of a paste-brush dipped in melted butter; now till the mould up with the apples, which cover with a Hat of the same paste. Bake the ‘timbale’ in a portable oven for fifty minutes; on taking it out, turn it over on a dish, and mask it with a layer of apricot-marmalade. 1092. Iced tart, German fashion (D. 215). — Place in a basin half a Fig. 215. pound of sugar, part of which may be flavored with orange; work it with a wooden spoon, adding to it, one by one, seven whole eggs. The preparation being frothy, whip it on a very mild tire for twelve minutes ; then add to it four ounces of potato- flour, as well as six whipped whites of eggs. As soon as the whites are introduced, gradually mix into the preparation half a pound of melted, clarified, liquid, and tepid butter.486 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. Bake this preparation in round flats, about half the thickness of the thumb ; when taken out of the oven, let them cool ; then mask the upper surface of three or four of them, with a layer of apricot-marmalade, on which immediately place the flats, one over the other. Pare the tart all round, mask likewise with marmalade, then with a layer of icing-sugar, flavored with maraschino, or rum. The icing-sugar having dried, adorn the top of the tart with preserved fruits, and red and white jelly: the decoration is according to fancy. Set the tart on a large dish, the bottom of which is covered with a round of paper of open-work. These tarts may also be prepared Avith tine vanilla- or orange- biscuit. 1093. Spanish pudding. — Pour half a pound of clarified butter into a stewpan, and warm; add to it two large handfuls of white, fine bread-crumb, stirring it with a spoon, till getting of a nice yellow color. Now dilute it gradually with three gills of warm milk, stir the preparation on the fire, till beginning to take a little consistence ; this done, take it off the fire, thicken it, working vigorously; add to it nearly half a pound of sugar, part of which flavored Avith vanilla, cook it for a few minutes more, then pour into another stewpan, and introduce into it six yolks of eggs, and three Avhole eggs. When the preparation is cold, mix in it five Avhipped Avhites of eggs, kept very firm ; pour it into a buttered and floured plain cylinder- mould, set in a stewpan filled Avith warm water to half its height , let the pudding poach in a portable oven; an hour after, turn it out on a dish, and mask it with English-cream, flavored with vanilla. 1094.

Francfurt-pudding. — Pour into a kitchen-basin half a pound of butter, half-melted; work it well with a spoon, so as to thicken it, mixing in six or seven yolks of eggs; when frothy, add to it five ounces of dried almonds, pounded with five ounces of sugar, perfumed with vanilla, and passed through a sieve. A few minutes after, add four ounces of brown-bread, dry, pulverised, and passed through a sieve. Add moreover four tablespoonfuls of preserved peel, a pinch of powdered cinnamon, and a little salt. Introduce into the preparation six whipped whites of eggs ; immediately pour it into a buttered dome-mould, glazed with sugar. Set the mould in a flat stewpan «1 boiling water, hake the pudding in the ‘bain-marie’ in a slack oven, for twenty-five or thirty minutes; turn it out, serve it with cherry-sauce all round, yet without masking it. The preparation of this pudding requires much care.493 SWEET ENTREMETS. — PUDDINGS. Fig. 222. 1107. Cabinet-pudding, with sabayon (D. 222). — Break six eggs into a kitchen-basin, add to them four yolks ; beat well with a whip, add six ounces of powder-sugar, a little piece of lemon-zest; dilute the eggs and sugar with a gill of good milk, pass the liquid through a sieve. Butter a cylindrical mould ; adorn the bottom with preserved angelica cut round, and the sides with brown biscuit cut in long triangles ; mask the bottom ornament with a layer of cut biscuits ; sprinkle over this layer a pinch ot preserved orange and cédrat peel, add a pinch of dry raisins without the stones ; on this layer range another in the same conditions, and so go on till the mould is full; now gradually j pour into the mould the cream previously prepared, set the mould in a stewpan higher than the mould, pour warm water into the stewpan, going up to just half its height; let the water boil, and remove the stewpan back on a very slow fire; cover it, and keep the pudding in the water for full an hour; then take it out, and turn it over on a dish. On the other hand, whip four or five yolks of eggs, to which add five spoonfuls j of powder-sugar, two gills of white wine, and a piece of lemon-zest ; whip the pre- paration on a very slow fire, being careful not to let it boil ; ten minutes afterwards, it must be firm and frothy ; now pour it on the pudding, and serve. 1108. Pudding of apples and rice. — Pick about a pound of fine j rice; which wash, plunge into plenty of boiling water, and boil until it no longer ; crackles, when taken between the teeth ; drain, and put it into a stewpan ; add to it a piece of butter and grated zest, put sugar over, cover, and let it cool. Moisten a napkin with cold water, then press it out ; butter its centre, spread it ! over a basin, then place the rice in layers on the centre of the napkin, alternated with rennet-apples quartered, and slightly fried in butter with a little sugar. Tie the napkin, pressing the preparation well together; plunge the pudding into boiling i water, and let it boil continually for one hour and a half. Then drain the pudding, unwrap it, turn it out on a dish, and mask it with a syrup of apple-juice, flavored with orange. O494 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 1109. Semolina-pudding, ‘à l’Impératrice’. — Pour two glassfuls of milk into a stewpan ; add one tablespoonful of vanilla-sugar, a little salt, a piece of butter; put the stewpan on the fire; at the first bubbling, introduce into the liquid half a pound of fine semolina, which let drop in like rain. The preparation being smooth, add the requisite sugar, and boil beside the fire for ten or twelve minutes; then pour it into a stewpan , work hard, adding to it a piece of butter divided in small bits, and at the same time five or six yolks of eggs. Half an hour previous to serving, mix into this preparation a ‘salpicon’ of pre- served fruits, such as, pine-apples, greengages, cédrats, and preserved cherries; introduce four whipped whites of eggs, half this quantity of whipped cream; pour this into a plain buttered cylinder-mould, which place in a stewpan, with boiling water coming to half its height; thus poach the pudding for forty-five minutes. When taken up, turn it out on a dish, and mask it with caramel-syrup flavored with vanilla. Send up separately a sauceboatful of this syrup. 1110. Bread-pudding, Baden fashion.— Put into a kitchen-basin half a pound of butter nearly melted, work it with a spoon, thicken it until like cream, gradually introducing into it four whole, and four yolks of eggs. Cut a pound of bread-crumb in dice, which moisten with cream; ten minutes after, press it out, to extract its moisture ; bray the bread-crumb with a spoon, add half a pound of powder-sugar and a pinch of flour, work it a few minutes longer; mix it in the preparation, as well as a pound of small dry mixed raisins, and a handful of cédrat cut up in small dice. Moisten the centre of a napkin, butter the wet spot, and flour it; spread this napkin over a basin, pour the preparation on the napkin, bring together the corners of the napkin at a level with the preparation, and tie it fast. Plunge the pudding into boiling water, and let the liquid bubble continually for one hour and a quarter; drain the mould, loosen the thread, unfold the napkin, and turn the pudding out on a dish. Mask it with a ‘sabayon, prepared with Rhine-wine. 1111. Fruit-pudding, English fashion. — Remove the peel, and core, from two apples ; which cut in little quarters. Cut in two six apricots, four peaches, three greengages, and thus remove their stones ; put these fruits into a kitchen-basin, and sprinkle over them two handfuls of powder-sugar. Prepare a pudding-paste (see No. 396) ; roll this paste with the rolling-pin into a flat round, a tenth of an inch thick ; spread this round on the centre of a buttered napkin, lay the napkin on a basin or a stewpan, place the fruits on the centre of the paste, gather the corners of the napkin so together, that it can be tied quite last, without leaving any vacant space. Plunge the pudding immediately into boiling495 SWEET ENTREMETS. — FRUITS, PUDDINGS. water, and let it boil continually for two hours, keeping the vessel covered. When about to serve, drain the pudding, cut the thread, remove the napkin, turn the pudding out on a dish, sprinkle over powder-sugar. Serve up separately a sauce- boatful of fruit-syrup. 1112. Cornucopia with fruits (D. 223, 224). — Prepare some ‘nougat’ with twelve ounces of almonds in fillets, and six ounces of sugar ; with this ‘nougat’, Fig. 223. * Fig. 224. line a previously oiled cornucopia-mould in two pieces. The ‘nougat’ having become firm, remove the mould, and fix the cornucopia on a dish, with its pointed end turned upwards, in the conditions represented by the drawing, but being careful to support it underneath by a stem in ‘nougat’. Spread then the aperture of the cornucopia with leaves in almond-paste or gum-paste (pastillage), then fill the hollow with preserved and fresh fruits glazed with ‘cassé’-sugar. These fruits may be composed of small pears, greengages, green and white almonds, pistachios, orange-quarters, and of fresh green or purple grapes. These fruits must first of all be glazed, then grouped on the dish, mingling them with leaves imitated in angelica; yet they must not be so fixed on, blit that the guests, to whom they are presented, can help themselves without inconvenience. 1113. Crayfish-pudding, with vanilla. — Soak, in warm milk, half a pound of household-bread-crumb ; five minutes after, press it out, and put into a stewpan ; warm it, working all the time with a spoon ; remove it back, add two tablespoonfuls of flour, a pinch of sugar, a whole egg. Let nearly melt a quarter of a pound of crayfish-butter, with half this quantity of fine butter; pour it into a kitchen-basin, and work with a spoon, till well thickened; add gradually six yolks of eggs, and four tablespoonfuls of vanilla- sugar ; the preparation being quite frothy, introduce into it the bread-crumb, as well as five whipped whites of eggs ; pour it immediately into a buttered and floured cylinder-mould, let poach at the ‘bain-marie’ for three quarters of an hour. When49f> COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. about to serve, turn the pudding out on a dish, and mask it with a vanilla English-cream. Singular though this dish may appear, it is nevertheless highly estimated in some parts of Germany. 1114. Malaga Pudding. — Pour into a kitchen-basin half a pound of butter half-melted ; work it with a wooden spoon till thickened; add to it gradually fifteen yolks of eggs, and half a pound of sugar. When the preparation is quite frothy, add to it four tablespoonfuls of apple-marmalade, previously diluted with the preparation, so as to be better apt to mix; add moreover eight whipped whites of eggs. Butter a large plain or cylinder-mould, till it, by layers, with the preparation, alternately with finger-biscuits, dipped into malaga-wine. Poach the pudding in the ‘bain-marie’ for forty minutes. When time to serve, turn the pudding out on a warm dish, mask it with a ‘sabayon’ prepared with malaga-wine (see No. 1107). 1115. Hanover Pudding. — Put into a kitchen-basin half a pound of butter half-melted ; work it with a spoon till well thickened ; then gradually mix with it a whole egg, and four of five yolks or eggs ; add to it four tablespoonfuls of orange powder-sugar, two spoonfuls of preserved peel cut, the same of dried raisins, two tablespoonfuls of flour, and half a pound of bread-crumb, moistened with milk, and then pressed out well. Pour the preparation into a buttered dome-mould, shut the mould, wrap it up in a napkin, which plunge into boiling water, and boil it for two hours. When ready to serve, turn the pudding out, mask it with an apricot-sauce, flavored with maraschino. lllti. Strawberry-flawn (flan) with cream. — Spreadaflawn-circle with tartlet-paste, which mask at the bottom, and all round, with buttered paper; and thus bake in a slack oven. The crust being taken out of the oven, remove the paper, and mask the paste with a thin layer of apricot-marmalade. The paste having cooled, fill the hollow of the crust with choice wood-strawberries, which range in' close layers ; pour over a little very thick syrup, mask them with well sugared and perfumed whipped-cream, kept very firm. Smooth the cream with the blade of a knife, raising it to a dome. Dish the flawn on a folded napkin. 1117. Large pear, farced (D. 224). — Get a large pear, duchesse, or beurré, not too ripe. Peel it, leaving a piece of the stalk adhering : cut the pear transversally about two thirds of its height (on the side of the stalk), empty the thickened part by aid of a vegetable-spoon. Boil the two parts of the pear in water, keep-497 SWEET ENTREMETS. — PEARS, APPLES. ing' the pieces rather firm ; allow them to cool in the syrup , then drain them on a cloth. Now place the lower part of the pear on a layer of rice with cream, which is cold, and ranged on a dish. Fill the interior of the pear with a ‘salpicon’ of fruits, thickened with a little apricot-marmalade, or jelly ; cover it with the other piece of pear, and surround the whole, at its base, with a circle of greengages, over which, as well as over the pear itself, pour a little syrup reduced with vanilla. 1118. Apples ‘méringuées’ (D. 226, 227). — Get eight or ten small rennet-apples, peel, empty, boil them in a light syrup, or in water, keeping them very Fig. 227. Fig. 226. white ; drain them, let them cool, mask them with their own syrup, reduced to jelly; put into the hollow of each of the apples a few preserved cherries. On the other hand, cut eight or ten apples into quarters, peel them, remove their pips, blanch them slightly, place them in a Hat stewpan, with melted butter, and a piece of vanilla ; sprinkle sugar over, let them cook, turning them, and being careful 32COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 498 to keep the pieces whole. When done, moisten them with four tablespoonfuls of apricot-marmalade, take them off the fire, and let them cool in the stewpan. Three quarters of an hour previous to serving, fix a few fried bread-‘croûtons’ on the bottom of the dish, forming a circle; mask the interior of this circle with a layer of apple-marmalade, on which arrange in a pyramid the cooked apples in quarters ; then mask the pyramid with longish beads of ‘meringue', squeezed through a silk-bag (poche) : the decoration is in imitation of a pine-apple. Begin by squeezing small beads all round the top, enlarging their size, as the circle spreads larger and larger. Stick fillets of almonds into these beads, sprinkle the ‘meringue’ over with powder-sugar, and allow it to take a little color in a moderate oven. When the dish is taken out of the oven, stick on its top some leaves of angelica, and surround the pyramid with the whole apples. 1119. Rice-pudding, with apples. — Blanch ten ounces of rice, drain, refresh, then p it it back into the stewpan, moisten to twice its height with boiled milk, let the liquid boil ; at the first bubbling remove it back on a very mild fire, keeping it consistent; sweeten only when nearly done; a quarter of an hour after, take it off the fire, add to it a little chopped lemon-zest, a handful of dried raisins, then five whole eggs, one by one, stirring the preparation well.. Butter a ‘charlotte’-mould, bread-crumb it, fill it with the cooled rice preparation, then set it on a baking-sheet, and bake it in a moderate oven for forty minutes; when taken out of the oven, scoop it round on the top with the point of a little knife, so as to take out a round ; now slightly empty the pudding, without thinning the sides too much; rill the hollow with a mince of rennet-apples, cooked, sweetened, and thickened with a few spoonfuls of apricot-marmalade. But the round back on the top, disengage the pudding from the mould, turn it out on a dish, sprinkle over powder-sugar ; mask the bottom of the dish with a little apricot-marmalade, and serve without delay. 1120. Rice-pudding, ‘à la Marquise’. — Set on salted ice, a ‘bombe’- mould. Pour into a kitchen-basin, a glassful of rice ‘purée’ prepared with milk; dilute this ‘purée’ with half a glassful of English-cream with vanilla ; pass the preparation through a tammy, and pour it into the ice-box (sorbetière), to be congealed by the same procedure as for ices. When frozen, take it up with a spoon, and with it mask the bottom and sides of the mould set on ice, so as to leave a hollow in the centre; which hollow then fill with a little pine-apple-ice slightly set, and mixed-up with a ‘salpicon’ of preserved fruits. Shut the mould, solder its join well, sprinkle oveV salt, mask entirely with salted ice, and leave it thus for three quarters of an hour. At serving-time, dip the mould quickly into warm water, then turn the pudding out on a cold dish, covered with a folded napkin..SWEET ENTREMETS. — SOUFFLÉS. 499 1121. Cream-flawn, Russ fashion. — Line a Hawn-mould with the trimmings of puff-paste, mask the bottom, but only to half the height, with a thin layer of vanilla - cream -‘frangipane’ ; cover the cream with a round of paper, and push the Hawn into the oven. The paste being nearly done, take it out, and mask the surface of the cream with a layer of raspberry-marmalade, passed through a sieve ; mask this marmalade with a layer of ‘frangipane’, so that the crust may fie quite full; sprinkle then over the upper surface some crushed macaroons ; sprinkle over this layer a little sugar, push the Hawn once more into the oven, and ten minutes after take it out. 1122. Chocolate-soufflé (D. 228). — Grate three or four cakes of cho- colate, which put into a small stewpan ; moisten with two tablespoonfuls of warm water, place the stewpan at the mouth of the oven. As soon as the chocolate is dis- solved, remove it off the fire, and bruise with a wooden spoon. Add to it four table- spoonfuls of sugar, flavored with vanilla; when well thickened, introduce into it five yolks of eggs, half of the whip of five whites of eggs, kept firm and sugared. Pour this preparation on the remainder of the whites of eggs, then into a ‘soufflé’-case, and let it bake in a moderate oven for fifteen minutes. This ‘soufflé’, of so very simple a preparation, gives excellent results, and pre- serves its perfection for a little while quite well. 1123. Sultan-‘bouchées’, Turkish fashion. — Pass through a sieve, into a basin, twelve ounces of flour ; mix a little salt, a little sugar, a few tablespoon- fuls of melted butter, and two or three yolks of eggs. Dilute it with tepid water, by the aid of a spoon, giving it the consistence of a frying-paste; at this degree, add to it four ounces of bread-yeast. Cover the basin, let the paste vise in a mild tempera- ture, until it has arrived at nearly double its volume; now break it, let it cool, and divide it into little bits, the size of a fine filbert; which roll to a round shape, and plunge 32*COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 500 into a frying-pan with clarified butter or oil. Two minutes after, drain the ‘bouchées’; when cold, plunge them again into hot fat; as soon as of a nice color, drain them, place them in a basin, largely moisten them with thick syrup, perfumed with orange or vanilla ; when soaked well, dish the ‘boiichées’, and pour over the same syrup. 1124. Vanilla soufflé. — Break six eggs, being very fresh ; put the yolks into a kitchen-basin, the whites into a large copper-basin. Mix into the yolks of eggs six tablespoonfuls of sugar flavored with vanilla, but not unglazed. Work the preparation with a wooden spoon, till quite frothy. On the other hand, mix a little salt in the whites of eggs, whip them hard, intro- duce them into the vanilla-preparation; then pour the whole into a buttered ‘soufflé’- pan, which push into a moderate oven (110° Falir.). Five or six minutes after (1 mean, as soon as the surface of the preparation turns to a crust), mark it crosswise with the blade of a knife : these incisions going to the very bottom of the pan. Pusli the ‘soufflé’ once more into the oven, to bake for twenty minutes longer, remem- bering twice to sift over fine sugar, which allow to glaze. If, the ‘soufflé’ being done, it should not be possible to send it up immediately, it can be kept in the warm-closet {étuve) ; previous to serving, push it back into the oven, whence it will come out in its primitive condition. I have often, in this manner, kept ‘soufflés’ for twenty minutes, and always succeeded in bringing them back to the same degree of elevation : this being an advantage well deserving the attention of cooks. 1125. Apple-soufflé, Russ fashion. — Take a pound and a quarter of but little sweetened apple-marmalade, well reduced and perfumed ; let it boil, stirring it, then take it off the fire ; introduce into it seven or eight whipped whites of eggs, kept very firm. Pour this preparation into a ‘soufflé’-pan, smooth its surface with the blade of a knife, giving it a dome-shape ; push the stewpan into a slack oven, bake the ‘soufflé’ for twenty minutes : this preparation does not rise, but remains light and frothy. 1126. Nougat-basket, garnished with cream (D.229,230). — Take a pound and a quarter of swelled almonds, mince them transversally, let dry on the warm-closet for five or six hours ; weigh, and warm them, without allowing to take color. Take half their weight of powder-sugar, put into a sugar-pan (potion (l'office); add the juice of two lemons, and stir over the fire until dissolved ; let it boil for a few minutes, without allowing it to take color; then immediately add the almonds, and remove the pan back. With this preparation quickly spread a basket-mould in three parts, previously oiled ; noticing to have the ‘nougat’ of equal thickness, but spreading it thin ; I'd ilSWEET ENTREMETS. — NOUGAT-BASKET. 501 get quite cool before turning it out. With the remainder of the 'nougat’, spread half a ‘eharlotte’-mould ; which turn over on a dish, fixing it on solidly. Fix the basket on this bottom-piece; adorn the upper borders of the basket, first with a border of puff-paste baked white (à hlanc), then with a nice circle of preserved greengages Fig. 229. Fig. 230. glazed with ‘cassé’-sugar ; fix two rings of gum-paste as handles to the sides, sur- round the base of the cup with a circle of little cakes; fill the hollow of the basket with a good cream-ice with vanilla. 1127. Perfect ‘soufflé’. — In spite of every thing written about ‘souffles as an ‘entremets’, there is one thing never to be questioned : ‘souffles’ have always been, and still are, the ‘rock-ahead’ for cooks. Let me hope that in future it may be possible to serve this‘entremets’ at all dinners; and that the practitioner and host a-like may look out for it with the same confidence, as for a pudding or a ‘charlotte’; I mean, without fear of seeing their expectations disappointed. I have good reason to hope, that the three receipts, which are given here, will be ere long the only ones in use. Put seven whites of eggs into a copper-basin, and whip them well up, adding a little salt. Put the seven yolks of eggs into a pan, add three tablespoonfuls of powder-sugar, work the preparation with a spoon for five minutes, then add to it about a quarter of a pound of tine butter, divided into small bits ; a few seconds after, turn it on the fire, until it be thickened like cream, but without allowing it to boil. Take it off the fire, and immediately introduce into it the whipping of three whites of eggs ; pour the preparation over the remainder of the whites, add two table- spoonfuls of orange-sugar, grated on the zest and pulverised ; pour the preparationCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY . 502 into a buttered ‘soufflé’-pan, which place on a small baking-tin, with a few table- spoonfuls of boiling water in, and push it into a moderate oven (110° Falir). Bake the 'souffle’ for thirty or forty minutes ; if the oven be too hot, the 'souffle’ must be covered over with a round of paper ; glaze it twice with sugar, previous to taking it out of the oven. This ‘soufflé’ is unquestionably of highly delicate relish. It will keep up its per feetion of appearance for a quarter of an hour, either in a warm-closet or at the mouth of an oven (kept open). If the precaution be taken to transport it, on the baking- sheet, as far as the dining-room, it can be handed round to the guests, without having lost any of its beauty or good qualities. 1128. Chestnut-sou filés. — Roast three dozen fine chestnuts, without allowing them to take color ; peel them, pound, and pass them through a sieve ; put the ‘purée’ back into the mortar, with half its weight of sugar, a part of which is flavored with vanilla, as well as a white of egg. All being well mixed up, take the paste up in small parts, of which form little balls, the size of a nut. Now beat a few whites of eggs with the whip, dip the chestnut-balls in, thus moistening their surface with the liquid ; let them drain, for a few minutes, on a sieve; then roll them, one by one, in fine sugar {glace de sucré), until the balls be entirely wrapped up in a coating of sugar; place them, one after the other, and at little distances, on a baking-sheet, let them bake in a moderate oven for twenty-five j» minutes. Dish them in a group on a folded napkin. 1129. Apricot-soufflé, Vienna fashion. — Put into a tinned basin three gills of apricot-'purce’ without sugar, the ‘purée’ being indifferently either raw or cooked. Mix the ‘purée’ up with double its volume of sugar, a part of which flavored with orange; set the basin on the ice, work the preparation with a spoon till nicely thickened. Now add a white of egg, not whipped, continue working the preparation hard ; as soon as this white of egg is mixed in, add another, and continue thus until ten whites of eggs are introduced. To get the preparation light, it must be worked for three quarters of an hour at least. Pour it into a ‘soufflé’-pan, bake it in a mode- rate oven for twenty minutes. 1130. Omelet stuffed with apples, Berlin fashion (D. 231). — Mix in a kitchen-basin five yolks of eggs, and four tablespoonfuls of sugar grated on lemon. Work the preparation with a wooden spoon. As soon as it has turned creamy, pour in four whites of eggs, whipped firm ; and at the same time, gradually introduce into the preparation four ounces and a half of strained flour, as well as a large glassful of whipped-cream. Put into a large omelet-pan, two ounces of melted and clarified butter ; as soon503 Pig. 231. as hot, pour half the preparation on the eenttc of the pan ; three minutes after, push the pan into the oven; and take it out immediately the preparation is cooked, observing that it must be kept creamy. Now slip the omelet on a* large sheet of paper spread on the table, then place on its centre a mince (émincé) of rennet apples, slightly cooked, and thickened with a tablespoonful of apricot-marmalade ; roll the omelet up by the aid of the paper, in order to shut the apples in, then dish it. With the remainder of the preparation, make another omelet, proceeding ac- cording to the same method ; dish the omelets, one beside the other, sprinkle over a little powder-sugar, keep the dish in the oven for live minutes ; then serve. 1131. Omelet soufflé, with vanilla. -— Clarity four ounces of good butter. Put into a kitchen-basin seven yolks of eggs, add live ounces of tine sugar, a part of which flavored with vanilla; bruise the eggs with a wooden-spoon, work the preparation, proceeding as for a biscuit, that is, working till it become light and frothy ; add a little salt, four pulverised 'macaroons’, and at last seven whipped whites of eggs kept very firm. Pour the clarified butter into an omelet-pan being well cleansed, warm it, pour the preparation into the pan, let it slightly toss, thus warming and letting it ab- sorb the butter, giving it a round shape. Now pour it into a buttered deep dish, and push it immediately into a hand-oven (four de campagne), quickly warmed ; twelve or fifteen minutes will do to bake the omelet. When well set, and light, sprinkle over plenty of fine vanilla-sugar; a few minutes afterwards, take it out of the oven, and .send up without delay. 1132. Apple-fritters. — Peel five or six rennet-apples, cut transvcrsally into slices three or four lines thick. Empty the centre of each of these slices, by the aid of a tin-cutter, to remove the hard parts of the core. Cut each of the slices with a tin-cutter, thus equalising them, and getting all alike; then put them into a kitchen-basin, sprinkle over a few tablespoonfuls of fine sugar flavored with orange, pour over two tablespoonfuls of cognac, which let macerate for ten minutes. Drain, spunge them on a cloth, dip one by one into a frying-paste, wrapping them up entirely; plunge them gradually into hot fat, agitate the pan, while plunging in the fritters, thus letting them set at once all round, and preventing their sticking together. Take care to plunge in but a small quantity at a time.504 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. The paste being dried, and of a nice color, take the fritters out with a skim- mer, drain them on a cloth, roll them in tine sugar, glaze them with the salamander, dish them in a group on a folded napkin. 1133. Eggs ‘a la neige’, with coffee. — Whip five whites of eggs ; as soon as very firm, mix in five tablespoonfuls of powder-sugar, then a tablespoonful of coffee extract or essence. Boil a quart of milk, slightly sweeten it with sugar; take up the preparation of whites of eggs with a ragout-spoon of long shape, plunge it into the milk in ebulli- tion, in order to poach it, that is, to get it firm : put in but little at a time. Remove the stewpan back to the side of the fire, cover it. Three minutes afterwards, with the aid of a skimmer, take out the poached parts of whites of eggs, drain them on a sieve, let them cool, and dish them in a circular order. Whip six yolks of eggs in a stewpan, dilute them with a gill of the sweetened milk, in which the whites have been poached : the milk first must be passed through a sieve. Stir the cream on the tire, in order to thicken it, proceeding as for English- cream ; pass it through a sieve, let it cool, mix in a tablespoonful of coffee-essence.* Pour this cream then on the poached whites of eggs, previously dished ; serve immediately. 1134. Marie-Louise fritters (D. 232). — Pass a pound of flour, through a sieve, into a kitchen-basin, make a hollow in its centre with the hand. Dilute about an ounce of German yeast with half a glassful of warm milk ; strain the liquid, and with it prepare in the basin a little dough ; which allow to rise to double its height, work it, and add to it a quarter of a pound of good melted butter. Work this pre- paration, gradually introducing into it the flour; add, at the same time, but by little and little, six whole eggs well beaten up ; work the paste hard by hand, to give it a nice consistence. Now mix in a pinch of salt, three tablespoonfuls of sugar pounded with two tablespoonfuls of almonds, and passed through a sieve ; cover the basin, let the paste rise in a mild temperature, and shut out from the contact of air; break, and let il again rise twice, breaking it each time. Then place the paste on a floured table, and let it cool ; roll it out thin with the hand or rolling-pin, then cut out of its surface thirty small rounds with the twelfth plain tin-cutter. On half of these rounds place a little ball of raspberry-marmalade, passed through a sieve, and reduced to firmness. Moisten slightly the remainder of the rounds, with which now cover the first ones; solder the paste well all round the marmalade, cut the rounds once more with the * Little bottles of this essence may bo purchased, at every eatable-dealer’s; it is generally used for the perfuming of icing-sugar.Fig. 232. 505 SWEET ENTREMETS. FRITTERS, EGGS same tin-cutter, then place the fritters one by one, on a floured napkin, spread on a baking-sheet, and now let the paste rise, until elastic to the touch. Plunge the fritters, half at a time, into a frying-pan with not very hot incited fresh lard, or butter; cover the frying-pan, and three minutes after, uncover it, to fan the fat with a kitchen-fan, thus cooling the surfaces of the fat; turn the fritters over, continue fanning; when done, drain them with a skimmer, then roll them in powder-sugar, and dish them in a heap on a folded napkin. Fritters, if well prepared, should be of a tine brown color, having a white circle in the middle, such as represented by the drawing. 1135. Eggs ‘à la neige’, moulded (D. 233). — This new method of preparing eggs 'à la neige’, well deserves the attention of cooks. Whip up three or four whites of eggs ; when of a nice consistence, introduce into them a quarter of a pound of powder vanilla-sugar, breaking the preparation slightly; then pour it into a channeled-mould, provided with a cylinder, buttered, and glazed with sugar. Put the mould into a stewpan with warm water, poach the preparation for twelve or fifteen minutes in the ‘bain-marie’ ; remove the mould, and live minutes after, turn the ‘entremets’ out on a dish, on the bottom of which pour some English-cream with vanilla.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 506 1136. Omelet with strawberries.— Getlarge, very fresh, and perfumed, pine-strawberries (fraises-ananas); pluck them, select about a score of the finest ones; each of which cut into four parts, then put them into a bowl, with sugar, a little orange-zest, two tablespoonfuls of rum. Pass the remainder of the strawberries through a fine sieve, thus getting a ‘purée’ of the volume of a waterglass. Sweeten slightly the ‘purée’ adding also a little orange-sugar, and set it on ice. Break ten eggs into a kitchen-basin, mix in two tablespoonfuls of fine powder- sugar, two tablespoonfuls of good cream; which beat up for a few seconds with a whip. Melt into a frying-pan five ounces of good butter, when hot add the eggs, thicken the omelet by aid of a spoon, and bring it back to the front of the pan, place the cut- up strawberries on the centre of the omelet, which fold on both sides, giving it a pretty shape ; turn it out on its dish, sift over a little sugar with vanilla ; glaze, and pour all round the ‘purée’ of strawberries. 1137. Omelet with apples. — Let me recommend this omelet to all friends of simple ‘entremets’. Put into a kitchen-basin two tablespoonfuls of flour, add a little salt, a table- spoonful of sugar, two whole eggs, two yolks of eggs, three ounces of melted butter ; now dilute this preparation with three quarters of a glass of good warm milk, and pass it through a sieve. On the other .hand, peel and mince five or six rennet-apples, which put into a frying-pan with six ounces of butter, and let warm, giving them a jerk from time to time ; as soon as they are very hot, pour the preparation over, spreading it about all the surface of the bottom of the dish. When it begins to get a nice consistence, thrust the point of a knife through the thickest part of the omelet, thus enabling the liquid parts on the surface to sink to the bottom. When by shaking the pan vigo- rously, the omelet can be detached from it, pour a little butter on the bottom of the pan. Sift over the surface of the omelet a little good raw sugar (cassonnade), then turn it by aid of a dish of the same size as the pan. Place the pan again over the fire, heat the omelet over a brisk fire, thus glazing the sugar at the bottom of the pan ; this being a particular, not to be neglected. Turn the omelet over again, by aid of the dish; its upper surface now should be nicely glazed; if not so; I mean, if the proceeding should not have proved successful ; then glaze the surface of the omelet with a salamander, and slip the omelet on a dish, on the centre of which a plate has been placed turned : by which means the omelet is more visible. 1138. Sugar-omelet, with ‘kirsch-wasser’ (D. 234, 235). — Break ten eggs into a kitchen-basin, add a pinch of salt, three tablespoonfuls of powder- sugar, one tablespoonful of kirsch-wasser, beat up for a few seconds.507 Fig. 234. Fig. 235. Heat four ounces of butter in a stewpan ; when it is melted, pour the eggs into the frying-pan, and thicken, stirring hard ; as soon as the omelet has set, so that it can be taken up from the frying-pan, roll it into aporte-manteau shape, and turn it out on its dish. Sprinkle over a little powder-sugar, glaze the omelet, applying to its surface a skewer made red-hot in the oven ; and by aid of this skewer, sketch a little decoration. Heat a quarter of a glass of kirsch-wasser, thicken it with three tablespoonfuls of apricot-marmalade, and pour on the bottom of the dish. This sweetened omelet is excellent indeed. 1130. Cherry-crusts of the Grand-Duke. — Cut eight or ten slices of household bread, half an inch thick ; cut them to an oval shape and equal size, make an incision all round, on one side, with the point of a knife; let them fry to a nice color, on both sides, in butter ; then drain and empty them ; now till the hollow with a tablespoonful of almonds ‘frangipane’, smooth the surface, sprinkle over tine sugar, frost with a red-hot shovel. On the other hand pick and stone three quarters of a pound of cherries, place them in a sugar-pan with a little sugar, and a glass of wine ; let the liquid bubble for a few minutes, then drain the cherries with the skimmer, to place them in a basin ; take a little of the liquid out, and add to it two handfuls of powder-sugar, and the zest of one lemon. Reduce this syrup quickly till of a nice consistence ; then add to it the cherries, which allow but one bubbling, then pour them into a deep dish. Dish the crusts up on the cherries. 1140. Crusts with cherries, Turkish fashion. — Put into a sugar- pan two pounds of tine stoned raw-cherries, add a pound and a half of powder- sugar ; toss the cherries and sugar; the sugar melted, set the pan on the tire, in order to boil the cherries for two minutes ; pour the fruit immediately into a basin. Two hours afterwards, pour the syrup into the pan, and let it reduce one third ; at this moment it should prove rather consistent ; pour it .now over the cherries. Cut off some slices of household-bread, being half an inch thick, with the aid of a paste-cutter, some ‘croûtons’ of a round shape; place one beside the other, and let them fry in a ‘sauté’- pan with clarified butter, turning them ; as soon as of aCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 508 nice color, moisten them, to half their height, with warm syrup of the cooked cher- ries : let the liquid boil, until the bread have absorbed all the syrup. This done, range the cherries on the centre of a dish; take the bread-crusts out of the stewpan, with the aid of a flat spoon, and range them all round the cherries. 13 41. Crust with peaches. -— Get eight or ten good peaches, not over- ripe, divide each of them in two, remove the stones, plunge them into boiling water; a few moments after, drain them, remove the skin, and place them in a flat stewpan : moisten with a little syrup mixed with kirschwasser. Prepare half a glassful of‘purée’ with a few small peaches ; add to it the same volume of syrup, let it boil up, thicken it with a little diluted potato-flour, then again pass through a sieve; add a quarter of a glassful of ‘kirschwasser’, as well as a stick of vanilla, and thus keep it in the ‘bain-marie’. On the other hand, spread a Hawn-mould with some tartlet-paste mask the inside of this paste with buttered paper, and bake thus in a slack oven ; when taken out, remove the paper, mask the paste on the bottom, as well as all round, with a layer of apricot-marmalade ; then place this crust on a dish Warm the peaehes, without ebullition, drain them, dish them in a pyramid shape within the crust ; coat them with marmalade, with the aid of a paste-brush, adorn them within with some preserved fruit: sprinkle over them a little kirsch mixed with syrup. Serve thus, sending up the peach-‘purée’ in a sauceboat. 1142. Spanish crusts. — Cut, off a common ‘brioche’, a score of crusts, of oblong shape, six lines thick ; sprinkle over fine sugar, let them glaze in the oven, mask them with a layer of apricot-marmalade, and arrange them in a circular order on a dish. Now fill the hollow of this circle with a garnish of half-preserved chest- nuts, mixed up with a few tablespoonfuls of Smyrna - raisins ; mask them with curaeao-syrup, sprinkle over minced pistachios. Send up separately some punch sauce, likewise prepared with curaçao. 1143. Fruit-crusts (D. 236). — Cut seven or eight bread-crusts of oval shape, nearly half an inch thick. Cut some others of a round shape, on one side of which make a round incision, fry them in butter, open and empty them; mask them inside with a little marmalade, garnish them with a ‘salpicon’ of preserved fruit, mixed up with preserved cherries, thickened with a little apricot-marmalade, diluted with madeira. Range immediately the oval crusts on a dish, on the centre of which a support of fried bread is fixed, setting them almost upright, but resting them against some fruit. Place the round crusts on the top ; insert a ‘lmtelet’-skewerSWEET ENTREMETS. — FRUIT-CRUSTS. 509 garnished with fruits into the support. Mask slightly the crusts, as well as the bottom of the dish, with a little apricot-sauce with madeira ; then mix in the remainder of the sauce a few tablespoonfuls of Smyrna-raisins, washed in warm FiK. 23fi. water and boiled for two minutes in a light syrup. Four this sauce- into a sauceboat. 1144. Chestnut-‘timbale’ (D. 237). — Put into a kitchen-basin half a pound of sugar, the same of Hour, the same of melted clarified butter, five yolks of eggs, a little salt, and grated orange-zest; mix this preparation well, working it for two minutes ; introduce into it the whipped white of five eggs, then spread the paste on buttered baking-sheets, giving it a quarter of an inch thickness. Bake it in a slack oven. When taken out, cut out after a model six flats of square shape, and the height of the ‘timbale’-mould ; glaze these pieces with white icing-sugar. (Jut also, after model, a fiat of hexagonal shape, which mask with marmalade, and glaze like the six flats.510 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. The glaze being- dry, cut the flats of biscuit with sloping edges (en biais), so as to make them join together; and apply them against the ‘timbale’-case, fixing them on with icing-sugar ; adorn each face of the ‘timbale’ with an ornament of colored icing-sugar, squeezed through a cornet. Hide the lines of junction with a thread of glaze ; place the ‘timbale’ on a flat, bordered with gum-paste. When about to serve, fill the hollow of the ‘timbale’ with a ‘plombière’ of chest- nuts with vanilla, mixed with preserved fruits cut in dice ; cover the ‘timbale’ with its glazed lid, on the centre of which fix a little egret (aigrette) of spun-sugar. 1145. Crusts with fruit. — With the aid of a round paste-cutter, cut a dozen crusts of household bread, about half an inch thick; keep them covered until time for frying. Wash in warm water a handful of dried smyrna-raisins, or currants, which put into a stewpan, adding the same quantity of preserved whole cherries, then a few slices of pine-apple, some preserved green almonds, or greengages cut in dice, two tablespoonfuls of orange-peel, and four or five spoonfuls of preserved cédrat, likewise cut in dice. Moisten these fruits, to cover, with madeira-wine ; let the liquid boil, then take it off the fire, in order to thicken it with two or three tablespoonfuls of apricot-marmalade ; keep the stewpan in the ‘bain-marie’. A few minutes previous to serving, pour into a flat stewpan a quarter of a pound of melted and clarified butter, which warm, then place the crusts in the stew- pan, allowing them to take color on both sides. Now drain them, and range them in a circle on a round dish, mask them with a little sauce of the fruits kept in the ‘bain-marie’, placing the fruits in the centre ; alternate each crust of bread by a slice of pine-apple, and serve immediately. 1140. Neapolitan ‘charlotte’. — Butter a ‘charlotte’-mould, line it with tartlet-paste, and mask the inside with buttered paper. Fill the hollow of the mould with common flour or dried grains, thus baking the ‘charlotte’ à blanc. When taken out of the oven, empty it, let it cool, turn it out, wipe the mould well, then put back into k the ‘charlotte’, and embed on ice. Get ready a preparation of chestnut-‘pain’ limed with ‘gélatine’, thicken it on the ice, stirring; when done, add to it five ounces of smyrna-raisins, the same of preserved peel of cédrat, orange, and lemon, as well as a few tablespoonfuls of mara- schino. Pour it into the ‘charlotte’, let the preparation cool for an hour. Wheri about to serve, dip the mould into cold water, in order to be enabled to turn the ‘charlotte’ out,* the outside of which mask with a layer of apricot-marmalade, which smooth with the blade of a knife, and adorn on the top with a ‘rosace’ com- posed of preserved fruits.511 SWEET ENTREMETS. — CHARLOTTES. 1147. Darioles, with vanilla (D. 238). — Slightly butter eight or ten ‘dariole’-moulds, line them with line short-paste, or trimmings of puff-paste : the paste must be thin. Put on the bottom of each mould a little piece of butter. Break two whole eggs into a kitchen-basin, add to them the amount of two ‘dariole’-moulds-full of sugar, flavored with vanilla, the same of flour, the same of Fig. 238. dry almonds, pounded with'a little sugar, and passed through a sieve ; work the pre- paration for two minutes, dilute with six ‘dariole’- moulds - full of good milk. With this preparation now fill the lined moulds, which place on a baking-sheet, keep it in a moderate oven for half an hour : five minutes previous to taking it out, sprinkle over sugar flavored with vanilla ; let it cool, dish on a napkin. 1148. Pear-charlotte (D. 239). — Get eight or nine white or grey butter- pears, which divide in two, peel and pare ; cut each of these halves lengthwise in three or four pieces, which place in a flat stewpan, with melted butter, and half a stick of vanilla; cook then slightly; sprinkle over a handful of sugar, toss then until their moisture be reduced ; drain them, mix them up with two tablespoonfuls of apricot-marmalade, and let cool. Have melted half a pound of butter, which pour off into a stewpan. Cut up very fine a few slices of household bread, giving the pieces the shape of a longish triangle, the long side of which gives exactly half the diameter of the mould. Round slightly the shorter side of the triangles; take them up, one by one, and dip them in meltedCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 512 butter; range them ‘cn rosace’ on the bottom of the mould, applying them ‘a cheval’ with their pointed end towards the centre of the mould. Cut some strips, the height of the mould, off some slices of household-bread ; give these pieces a breadth of about an inch, dip them in melted butter, and apply them ‘à cheval’ against the sides, making them rest on the bottom-layer of bread. Twenty-five minutes previous to serving, fill the hollow of the ‘charlotte’ with the pears, slightly warmed; cover them with broad slices of bread, which mask on the top with butter ; put the mould on a baking-sheet, and push it into a hot oven, to give the bread a fine color ; thirty-five minutes after, take the mould out of the oven, turn the ‘charlotte’ out on a dish, sprinkle over fine sugar, and serve immediately. 1149. Pear‘charlotte’, German fashion. —- Cut into quarters some good pears (poires de beurré); peel, mince, put them into a flat stewpan, with a few tablespoonfuls of water, a handful of powder-sugar, and a piece of lemon-zest ; cover the stewpan, boil the pears on a quick fire for a few minutes, without allowing them to dissolve, but reducing their moisture ; this done, take them off the fire, remove the zest, and thicken them with two tablespoonfuls of apricot-marmalade. With half a pound of‘brioche’-paste spread a buttered ‘charlotte’-mould ; fill the hollow of the mould with the cooled pears, which then cover with a round of the same paste, soldering them carefully to the sides. Bake the ‘charlotte’ in a.moderate oven for thirty-five or forty minutes ; now turn it out on a dish, and mask it with a little apricot-marmalade, diluted with light syrup and four tablespoonfuls of good rum. 1150. Buonbocconi, Genoa fashion (D. 240). — What the Genoese call ‘buonbocconi’, is for them a national dish. I give the ‘entremets’ here, as being excellent, and fit to serve in every country. Keep in cold water a pound of beef-marrow ; spunge it, pound, pass it through a sieve. Cut in small pieces live or six ounces of peel of lemon, orange, and cédrat, newly preserved; pound this peel, pass it likewise through a sieve, then pound together with the beef-marrow, and put this preparation into a kitchen-basin. Work well with a spoon, add two tablespoonfuls of orange-powdered-sugar, a pinch of orange-blossoms, chopped and crisped (pralinées), then one or two yolks of eggs : the preparation must be kept consistent. Take three quarters of a pound of trimmings of puff-paste, or else fine short- paste, and roll it out thin on the floured slab ; on half of this flat trace some rounds with the aid of a paste-cutter turned over, and of an inch and a half diameter ; moisten the rounds with the paste-brush, then put, on tin; centre of each, a little bit of marrow- preparation rolled up between the hands, moistened with orange-flower-water.SWEET ENTREMETS. — CHARLOTTES. 513 These bits must have the size of a filbert plum. From the rest of the flat of paste cut the same quantity of rounds, kept a little larger than the first; with these rounds now cover the marrow-preparation, soldering them with, the paste beneath ; press both the flats on, all round, in order to solder them well ; then cut them with the first paste-cutter, placing these fritters, one beside the other, on a floured cloth. Fig. 240. Have warmed, at the entrance of the oven, half a pound of powder-sugar. A few minutes previous to serving, plunge the ‘buonboceoni’ into a pan of good hot hog’s lard, or butter ; drain immediately, when of a nice color, roll them in the warm sugar, and dish them on a folded napkin. Serve immediately. 1151. ‘Charlotte’, Polish fashion (D. 241). — Bake a vanilla-biscuit in a ‘timbale’-mould ; when cooled, cut it transversally into slices half an inch thick ; Fig. 241. mask each of these slices with a ‘frangipane’-cream flavored with vanilla. Bring the biscuit back into shape, on a dish ; mask its outsides, first with a slight layer of apricot-marmalade, and then with one of ‘méringue’-preparation, which smooth, adorn with the cornet, managing the decoration so as to be enabled afterwards to ornament it (when cooked) with ‘confitures’. The ‘meringue’ being adorned, sprinkle over fine sugar, push the dish into a moderate oven, thus giving the ‘meringue’ a nice yellow color. When the ‘charlotte’ is taken out of the oven, wipe the dish well, adorn the ‘meringue’ with apple- 33COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 514 and gooseberry-jelly, send up separately a boatful of English-cream, flavored with vanilla. 1152. Apple-‘charlotte’, German fashion. — Peel fifteen fresh ren- net-apples, mince them, put them into a stewpan with a few spoonfuls of water, cover them, let boil till the liquid be reduced ; sweeten them, add a piece of cinnamon, and a bit of lemon-zest, let them boil, stirring, till the preparation has reduced to marma- lade ; then take it off' the fire, remove the zest, as well as the cinnamon ; mix in a handful of currants, the same of preserved cédrat cut in small dice. An hour previous to serving, butter a ‘charlotte’-mould, to line it with bread- crumb, in the same condition as indicated at the No. 1148. The mould being garnished, fill its hollow with the warm apple-preparation ; cover the top with a round slice of bread, set the mould on a little baking-sheet, push it into the oven ; bake the ‘charlotte’ for thirty-five minutes ; as soon as the bread is of a nice color, turn the ‘charlotte’ out on a dish, and serve. 1153. WGStfalta— charlotte . Cut fitteen apples into quaiteis j peel, pare, and mince them ; put them into a stewpan with nearly half a pound of melted butter, toss them on a brisk fire, until their moisture be reduced; sprinkle over a few handfuls of powder-sugar, add a little lemon-zest, a piece of cinnamon ; cook them for a few minutes, then take them off the fire. Dry, then pass through a fine sieve, a pound or a pound and a quarter of grated bread-crumb of brown-bread (pumpernickel), place this bread-crumb in a flat stewpan with half a pound of hot butter, which fry for a few minutes, to get it dry ; then pour the preparation into a kitchen-basin, add a little chopped zest, two tablespoon fuis of cinnamon-sugar ; let it absorb half a glassful of malaga or madeira wine ; work it for a few minutes with a spoon, thus getting it consistent ; and with it mask a well- buttered ‘charlotte’-mould, all around and on the bottom, giving the preparation full half an inch thickness, but pressing the bread hard. Fill the hollow with the warm apples, cover it on the top with a round slice of buttered bread; place the mould on a baking-sheet, and push it into a moderate oven; bake the ‘charlotte’ for forty minutes; when taken out of the oven, introduce the blade of a knife between mould and ‘charlotte’, which turn out on a dish, and sprinkle over fine sugar. 1154. ‘Charlotte’, Russ fashion, with pine-apple. — Spread with paper a ‘charlotte’-mould. With finger-biscuits, pointed on one side, form a rosette at the bottom of the mould, laying the biscuits on with their glazed side. Cut straight, on ends and sides, some other biscuits : notice, they must be just as long, as the mould is high ; place these biscuits side by side, and in an upstanding direction, against the sides of the mould, laying them on likewise with their glazed side. Embed the mould on ice.515 SWEET ENTREMETS. — PEACHES. Mix eight dissolved leaves of ‘gelatine’ into one gill of pine-apple syrup, add to it a bit of lemon- or orange-zest, as well as the juice of an orange. Pass the liquid through a sieve into a sugar-pan (skillet), stir it on the ice, in order to thicken it to the degree of cream ; then take it off the fire, mix in two gills of whipped cream, and six or seven ounces of fresh or preserved pine-apple, cut in dice. With this pre- paration fill the hollow of the ‘charlotte’ ; one hour after, turn the ‘charlotte’ out on a folded napkin. 1155. Peaches with rice (D. 242). — Take eight or ten good peaches, divide each of them in two, remove their stones, and plunge the half-peaches into Fig. 242. boiling water ; drain them as soon as the skin falls off, put them into a kitchen-basin, and cover with syrup, at 30° Ré. = 100° Fa. Pick and wash half a pound of rice, let blanch for seven or eight minutes, drain, refresh, and put it into a stewpan ; moisten to cover with warm milk, let it boil on a moderate fire; as the liquid becomes absorbed, replacing it with more; at the last moment, add a stick of vanilla cut-up, and two handfuls of powder-sugar; take it off the fire, keep it covered. Ten minutes after, introduce into the pre- paration three ounces of fine butter. With this rice fill a buttered border-mould, pressing the rice, and keep it tin the warm-closet ; ten minutes after, turn it out on a dish. Fill the cavity of the border with the halves of peaches, raising them in a dome-like shape ; mask them with a part of the syrup, reduced with a little apple- juice : set half an almond on each of the peaches : send up separately the remainder of the syrup, mixed-up with a little maraschino. 115G. ‘Charlotte’ of peaches, Milan fashion. — Get seven or eight fine peaches, two of which put by ; cut the others in two, remove their stones, peel, and cut them in little pieces, which put into a kitchen-basin, sprinkle over a little powder-sugar flavored with vanilla, moisten with two tablespoonfuls of rum. Spread a ‘charlotte’-mould with cut-up finger-biscuit, set the mould in a kitchen-basin, and surround it with pounded ice. A quarter of an hour after, place 33* ICOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 511> on the bottom of the mould a layer of the pieces of peaches, on which pour a few tablespoonfuls of jelly, whipped with maraschino: this jelly must be strong in the liqueur, not much whipped or set, thus being able to sink into the hollows, between the quarters: the jelly must just cover the peaches. Let this coating set. and as soon as firm, range on it another layer of peach-quarters, which again mask with jelly. Let the jelly set, and repeat the same proceeding, until the mould is full; then cover it, and keep it on ice for half an hour. When about to serve, turn the 'charlotte’ out on a dish, let the biscuit absorb a little maraschino (by aid of a paste-brush) ; cut the peaches previously kept by, also in quarters, and range them in a circle round the 'charlotte’ ; moisten them with marascliino-syrup. 1157. Sugared ‘gnocchi’, Italian fashion. — Put a glassful of flour into a stewpan, add three whole eggs, two yolks of eggs, a little salt, a tablespoonful of sugar ; dilute this preparation with a glass of milk, pass it through a sieve into a stewpan, add a little piece of butter. Stir the preparation on a moderate fire, thus to thicken it ; as soon as beginning to get knobby, remove it back, work vigorously to smooth it ; this done, put it again over the fire;, add a piece more butter, let it boil for five or six minutes, without ceasing to work ; pour it into a kitchen-basin, and introduce into it two raw yolks of eggs, as well as a pinch of grated orange- zest ; take it up in little bits, which let drop on a floured table ; roll them (by hand) into balls, then flatten with the handle of a knife. Ten minutes before serving, plunge these 'gnocchi’ into boiling water, let the liquid bubble for two minutes, then remove back ; five minutes after, drain them with a skimmer on a sieve; dish them in layers, sprinkle over sugar flavored with cinnamon, mask them with three tablespoonfuls of bread-crumb fried in butter, and moreover baste them with clarified butter 'a la noisette'’. 1158. Fruits with rice (D. 243). — Butter a mould with a flat border, fill it with rice, boiled with cream, finished with a few yolks of eggs, but leaving a hollow in the middle. Fill this hollow with rather firm apricot-marmalade, cover it with a layer of rice, and keep the mould at the 'bain-marie’ for twenty-five minutes. On the other hand, cut six or seven slices of raw pine-apple, divide these slices in two, place the pieces in a stewpan, cover with syrup (28 li. 05), and keep them in the 'bain-marie’. Cut likewise a few slices of pine-apple into small dice, which put into a stewpan, add the same quantity of preserved apricots, the same of green almonds, the same of preserved cherries, and at last a little bit of angelica; all of which cut up in small dice ; add moreover, to this 'salpicon’, two tablespoonfuls of well-washed Smyrna-raisins, the same amount of scalded pistachios.

When about to serve, turn the border out on a warm dish. Drain the liquid of the ‘salpicon’, thicken it with a few tablespoonfuls of apple-marmalade, flavored with vanilla, and place it in the hollow of the border. On these fruits pile a group of cherries, in compote, or ‘au demi-sucre’; in the last case they must be washed Fig. 243. with warm water. Surround the fruits with slices of pine-apple, ranged in a circle. Surround the border at its base with a circle of cooked greengages ; send up separately a sauceboatful of apricot-marmalade, diluted with the maraschino of the fruits. 1159. Rice with pears (D. 244). — Choose a dozen small pears of equal size, leave them whole, empty slightly on their rounded end, leave a part of Fig. 244. the stalk adhering, and thus boil the pears, as for compote, keeping them carefully whole. With a few other good pears (either beurré or crésanè), prepare a little mar- malade, which reduce with a stick of vanilla, keeping it rather firm. Butter a dome-shaped mould, the bottom of which mask with a rather thick layer of rice with cream {see No. 1155), finish it with a piece of fine butter, and a few yolks of eggs. Fill the hollow in the centre of the rice witli pear-marmalade, which mask with a layer of rice.

When about to serve, turn the rice over on a hot dish ; surround it with the pears, which mask with a paste-brush, with their own syrup, reduced with apple- jelly. Pour on the bottom of the dish a few tablespoonfuls of vanilla-syrup. 1100. Rosecolored ‘nougat’, Provence fashion. — In the south of France the‘nougat’ is highly estimated by all classes of society; there is no festival to be thought of, without this dainty. ‘Nougat’ is therefore very largely prepared in Provence, and generally prepared to perfection. There are two sorts of ‘nougats’: the white and the brown; the first being the most distinguished, the brown ‘nougat’ being more common. That which I am about to describe, is a recent novelty of highest merit, of simple preparation, and nevertheless giving the finest, best result. Let me hope that cooks and pastry-cooks will not fail to profit by it. Get four pounds of small sweet almonds, let them dry well, then keep them warm. Put into a copper-basin two pounds of pounded sugar ; add one pound of white honey, set the basin on the fire, and boil the sugar, skimming it carefully. At the first bubbling, add four tablespoonfuls of wheat-syrup, and a few drops of citric acid. The sugar being at the degree of ‘cassé’, remove it back, perfume it with extract of roses, or neroli, add a few drops of vegetable carmine, and pour it on an oiled marble slab ; now with the aid of a flat spoon (palette), bring it back to the centre, until forming a manageable paste. Take this paste (with the hands) and draw it out (tirer), as done for twisted sugar, either hooking it on, or else two persons working, but quickly, and without allowing it to get cold. Now mix in the warm almonds, and two handfuls of swelled pistachios ; place the preparation in a wooden case of low square shape, the inside of which case is spread with large strips of ‘hostie’-wafers. Equalise the ‘nougat’ on the top, giving the preparation a thickness of one or two inches, and mask like- wise with the same wafers; apply on the surface the lid of the case, which charge with a weight sufficient to press the ‘nougat’ close. Ten minutes after, empty the case, and divide the ‘nougat’ in longish squares, cutting it up with the aid of a crescent-shaped cleaving-knife. 1161. Rice-milk, Spanish fashion. — Wash a pound of rice, which put into a stewpan with cold water ; half-cook it, drain, and finish cooking in milk; keep it on the fire, until very tender, but not in a pulp : add sugar at the last moment. When done, range it on a deep dish, smooth the-surface of the rice, and place on the top a buttered paper, cut out à jour in any ornamental pattern; sprinkle over theSWEET ENTREMETS. — FRUITS. . 519 paper powder-cinnamon mixed-up with a little sugar, so that, when removing the paper, the pattern cut out on this he traced with sugar on the surface of the rice. 1162. Fat-liver pie (imitation) for dessert (D. 245). — SavgII three quarters of a pound of almonds; drain, pound, and pass them through a sieve. Boil ‘au petit cassé’ one pound of sugar with a stick of vanilla ; when it is done, remove it back, mix up with the pounded almonds, thus getting a sort of paste; which pour into the mortar, and pound until quite smooth ; take it out, work it on a Fig. 245. table, sprinkled with tine sugar, and divide it; take a few pieces, and color them; some red, veined with white, in imitation of ham; some, yellow (café au lait), imitating fat-liver ; some black, with chocolate or caramel, in imitation of truffles; lastly one, the color of baked paste. With this last one, rolled out very thin, line ( foncer) a small plain mould, as for Strasburg-pie. Moisten the paste from within, mask it with another flat of white paste, in imitation of the underdone paste found inside these pies. Chop some pieces of the red paste, veined with white, as well as of the ‘café au lait’ and black, which then mix up well: this chopped paste is to stand for the force-meat; thicken with a little apple-jelly, and spread one layer on the bottom of the masked case. Cut the yellow paste into large squares, in imitation of fat-livers. Lard these squares with a few square fillets of black paste, standing for truffles. Cut square fillets off the white, and the marbled paste ; mix these different pastes together in a kitchen-basin, and add a few little preserved nuts (well drained and very dark of color), pears and apricots, likewise preserved and cut up, as well as a few small fillets of apple- or quince-paste. This is the garnish for the inside of the pie, and must be placed in the hollow of the case, ingeniously disposing of the different shades, but particularly noticing to leave a little space, between the imitated meat, and the crust of the pie. Into this free space pour some soft liqueur-jelly, a little520 COSMOPOLITAN COOKEEY. more firm than usual, and of a rather dark shade: this jelly is only to be poured in, when cold, and a little consistent. As soon as the jelly is set, raise the preparation in a dome-shape ; cover with a paste-flat, which solder to the rim of the case ; cut straight, and pinch in the manner applied for common pies. Make an incision on the centre of the dome, and adorn it with imitation-leaves. Now remove the mould, and pinch the surfaces of the paste. The pie being pinched, a little color must be given to the paste, on the top and all round, with caramel, reduced to a solid syrup, thus giving the jutting parts, the dome, and pinched top of the pie, a light brown shade. When about to serve, cut off a piece of the pie thus showing the inside, garnish, then place it on a dish, to serve thus, or surrounded with soft jelly, either chopped or cut-up in ‘croûtons’. This ‘entremets’ is only fit to go for a dessert, the almond paste being ex- tremely sweet. If the pie be nicely imitated, it will seldom fail to give occasion for some amusing mistakes. 1163. Apples, Florentine way. — Peel seven or eight genuine rennet- apples; empty them with a column-tube, boil them in a light acidulated syrup, keeping them a little firm, and whole. Drain them, fill the cavity with boiled sweetened rice, which mask with apricot-marmalade. Spread on a dish a layer of chestnut-‘purée’, kept rather firm, sweetened with vanilla-sugar, finished with a few yolks of eggs. Place the apples on this layer, glaze them with a paste-brush with apricot-marmalade, and warm them in the oven for a few minutes ; when taken out, sprinkle over them chopped pistachios, and send up. 1164. Dates, Arab-fashion. — Peel a few dozen fresh dates, remove their stones, pound their pulp, and pass it through a sieve ; give sugar to this ‘purée’, add a few drops of extract of roses or lemons, spread it in a layer on a pie-dish, and mask the ‘purée’ immediately with a ‘bouillie’ of good arrow-root or rice-flour, pre- pared with milk, perfumed with orange or lemon. 1165. ‘Méringues perlées’, with cream (D. 246).— Pour five whites of eggs into a copper-basin, add a little salt, and whip gently with a kitchen-whip; when beginning to get frothy, whip more vigorously, thus to thicken, making them absorb the air as much as possible. When quite firm, mix into it with a wooden spoon, and by degress only, half a pound of powder-sugar. The preparation being quite smooth, and consistent, take it up in small parts with a tablespoon, and place these on strips of paper, giving these parts an oval and regular shape, forming half- shells for ‘méringues’ ; sprinkle over powder-sugar ; remove the superabundance of521 SWEET ENTREMETS. — MERINGUES. sugar, by quickly inclining the strips of paper, which then place on boards previously steeped in cold water, placing one beside the other. Push them into a very moderate oven, to let the ‘meringues’ dry, and pearl the top of each shell ; as soon as able to bear handling, and of a nice color, take them out, detach them from the strips of paper, then gently empty on their Hat side, removing with a tea-spoon any part of Fig. 246. the preparation, which remained soft. Put the shells back into the oven, to dry their inside ; keep them in the warm closet for six hours ; take them out, and let cool. A quarter of an hour previous to serving, garnish thirty-six of such shells Avith whipped cream, flavored with vanilla - sugar ; then put the shells together, two and two, and dish them, in a group, on a folded napkin. 1166. Ducat-nudels (dampf-nouilles) Munich fashion (D. 247). — ‘Dampf-uomlle-paste\ — Pass a pound of flour through a sieve into a kitchen-basin, Pig. 247. then keep in the warm closet. Dilute about an ounce of German yeast Avith half a glassful of tepid milk, and with this liquid, as Avell as with a quarter of the flour, prepare a dough in the basin itself; co\Ter it Avith the remainder of the flour, and let it rise in a mild temperature. When risen to double its volume, work it with the hand, add nearly a quarter of a pound of melted butter, five yolks of eggs, a little tepid milk; introduce the flour, in such a manner, as to get a soft paste; which work vigorously ; at last, add a quarter of a pound of sugar, a pinch of chopped citron-zest, and let the paste rise once more, in a moderate temperature.522 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. Spread the paste on a floured table, to get it firm ; let cool, and roll it out, with the rolling-pin, into a thin flat; let it rest for two minutes, and divide in rounds, with a tin-cutter, of about an inch and a half diameter. Arrange these rounds, one by one, on a floured cloth, putting them at little distances one from the other ; cover them with paper; let the paste rise a little in the temperature of the kitchen ; then take these rounds, one by one, moisten them with the paste-brush, with crayfish-butter; range them in a circle in a plain cylinder-mould. Let these circles go up to three quarters of the height of the mould, let the paste rise again, till it reach to the rim; then wrap the mould up in strips of buttered paper, place it on a baking-sheet, which push into a moderate oven, and bake the cake for forty minutes. When taken out of the oven, turn the cake out on a disïi; send separately an English-cream with vanilla. 111)7. Quinces with ‘caimac’. -— Here is given the method of preparing that famous ‘caimac’, so much in use among the Turks, and applied by them to almost all their ‘entremets’. Pour into a large earthen-pan, flat in form, very clean, ten quarts of unskimmed milk (by the Turks buffalo-milk is preferred). Let it be warm, rather more than tepid, and remove it back, so as to keep it at the same degree of heat for two hours, without touching it. Then take it entirely off the fire, and keep it (on a trevet) in a cool place, for seven or eight hours. Now the surface of the liquid will be covered with a thick skin of solid cream : this being the ‘caimac’, which cut in squares, take it up with the skimmer, and spread it out on a dish for after-use. If this preparation is kept in a cool place, it may be easily preserved for two or three days. The ‘caimac’ is very often served alone, sprinkled over with perfumed sugar. Peel five or six ripe quinces, empty of their inner pulp with the aid of a vege- table-spoon ; boil them in a light syrup, taking care to keep them whole. When drained, and cooled, garnish them with the sweetened ‘caimac’, place them on a dish, mask with the reduced syrup of fruit, and adorn them with some green leaves. 1168. ‘Dampf-nudeln’, Polish fashion. — Take one pound and a half of dampfnudel-paste (see No. 1166) ; when risen, put it on a floured table, work for a few minutes, with the floured hand; let cool, then roll it out with the rolling-pin into a thin flat, which divide in rounds with the tenth tin-cutter ; place, on the centre of each round, a small ball of apple-marmalade, reduced, and quite firm, mixed up with a little rum. Bring back the edges of the flats over the marmalade, folding them together in a manner completely to enclose the marmalade ; place the ‘dampf- nudeln’, one by one, and turned up side down, in a deep buttered baking-sheet ; let the paste rise for three quarters of an hour ; then with the paste-brush moisten the523 SWEET ENTREMETS. — FLAWNS. klampf-nudeln’ with melted butter, push them into a moderate oven, and bake; when done, sprinkle with tine sugar. A few moments after, take them out of the oven, to detach them one from the other, and dish them, in a group, on a folded napkin. 1169. Rice-flawn (flan), with fruits (D. 248, 249). — With some tartlet-paste spread a fiawn-circle of rather high shape; cut and pinch it on the top, till it with rice boiled with cream and with vanilla, finished with a piece of fine butter, and a few tablespoonfuls of whipped cream. Now take off the circle Fig. 248. Fig. 249. pinch the side-surface, and surround with a strip of paper, which fasten with thread ; cover also the top with paper; bake the Hawn, in a moderate oven,,for twenty-five or thirty minutes. When taken out, remove the upper crust of the rice, dish on the edges a cii’de of cooked half-peaches, the central hollow of which circle garnish with a heap of cherries in compote, or with preserved cherries ; mask the peaches with their own reduced syrup, then stick in, between peaches and cherries, a few leaves of angelica cut pointed. 1170. ‘Dampf-nouilles’ with cream. — Have warmed in a kitchen- basin three fourths of a quartern of flour, passed through a sieve. Dilute half an ounce of good German yeast with a glassful of warm milk ; pass the liquid, and with it dilute the Hour, so as to form a paste, to which give a high degree of stiffness. Cover the basin, let the paste rise in a mild temperature ; when risen to double its volume, work it with the hand, mix in it four ounces of melted butter, a little salt, four tablespoonfuls of sugar, then four or five yolks of eggs, one by one, working the paste continually. When the eggs are introduced, the paste must not be too light; if required, a handful of Hour must be added : again let the paste rise in the temperature of the kitchen, then turn it out on the floured table, and let cool; slightly flatten it, then divide it in strips, the thickness of a finger, which pieces cut transversally, so as to get balls the size of a filbert ; roll these pieces with the hand to a round shape, place them one by one on the bottom of a buttered flat stewpan : these balls must not touch one another, yet must be placed very near together. Let the paste rise once more, in the temperature of the kitchen, for an hour.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 524 Infuse a stick of vanilla in a gill of milk, sweeten this, and keep it warm. When the ‘dampfnouilles’ have risen, moisten them just to cover, with warm milk; shut the stewpan quite close, push it into a hot oven, bake the ‘dampfnouilles’ for twelve minutes, that is, just the time requisite to let the liquid evaporate ; the stewpan must on no account be opened. The ‘dampfnouilles’ being dry, they ought to turn out yellow, delicate, and of a round shape ; detach them from the bottom of the stewpan, with the aid of a flat spoon (palette), or of the blade of a knife ; dish them in a group, slightly mask them with part of the English-cream, send the remainder up in a sauceboat. These ‘dampfnouilles’ constitute an ‘entremets’, plain indeed, but excellent; I should like very much to see them introduced in England, as they would certainly be highly appreciated there. In England, ‘German yeast’ is but rarely used in the kitchen ; this is wrong, and a great pity, as the cooks are thus deprived of a great number of good ‘entre- mêts’. Let us hope that for the future cooks will make it a point to study this question in its manifold details, and thereby appropriate its numerous advantages. 1171. Apple-flawn, German fashion. — Let me recommend this ‘entremets’, as a much appreciated variety, well worthy to be introduced into English pastry. Cut in quarters seven or eight good apples ; peel them, pare away the hard parts round the core; mince them transversally, put them into a kitchen-basin; sprinkle over a little powder-sugar ; let them macerate for half an hour, tossing them from time to time. Place a flawn-eircle on a baking-sheet, line it with tartlet-paste. Sprinkle over the apples two tablespoonfuls of orange-sugar, and two or three tablespoonfuls of currants ; then place the apples in the flawn-case, taking care to arrange them in a dome, rising above the level of the rim, as apples diminish their volume in cooking. Cover the apples with a flat of the same paste, which solder with that of the rim; pinch the upper part correctly, then push the cake into a moderate oven, and bake it for forty minutes ; take it out, remove the upper paste, and five minute after, mask it, by aid of the paste-brush, with a little icing-sugar. Remove the flawn-circle previous to sending up. 1172. Vienna-‘noques’. — Pour into a kitchen-basin half a pound of half- melted butter; work it with a spoon, adding, one by one, eight yolks of eggs ; the preparation being frothy, introduce into it six tablespoonfuls of flour, and six whipped whites of eggs.525 SWEET ENTREMETS. — FLAWNS. Boil in a large stewpan two glassfuls of milk with sugar, add a piece of vanilla. Take the preparation up with a warm tablespoon, and let it drop into the milk, in the shape of ‘quenelles’, which let poach. Then drain, and place them on a buttered dish, or vegetable-dish, sprinkle over powdered sugar, then let them glaze to a nice color in the oven ; when taken out, pour over a little vanilla English-cream, and serve immediately. % 1173. Flawn of fruits, Vienna fashion (D. 250). — Line a channeled dawn-circle, or a hot-pie-mould of shallow form, with tartlet-paste; adorn Fi!?. 250. the crest of the borders with leaves of paste; egg these with the paste-brush, then mask the sides and bottom of the case with buttered paper ; fill the hollow with dried kernels of cherries, or common flour: this being, what is called, cooking the crust à blanc. Push it into a moderate oven. Forty minutes after, take it out, empty, and let it cool ; then mask its inside with a layer of apricot-marmalade. A quarter of an hour before serving, place the crust on a dish, fill its hollow with a ‘bavarois’- preparation of rice and almond milk, thickened at the moment on ice, arranging it in layers, alternating with marmalade, and giving it a dome-like shape. Let the preparation get firm on ice for a few minutes, then surround it with a chain of greengages, and another of halves of peaches, prepared as for compote; garnish the hollow with a group of cooked cherries, or raw strawberries ; mask the fruits, with the paste-brush, in their own syrup, being cold, mixed up with juice of apples, and reduced to a nicety. This ‘entremets’ is not only one of the prettiest, but moreover is excellent, and luxurious. 1174. Cherry flawn (flan) German fashion. — This ‘entremets’ is one of the most valuable creations of the German school. Spread half a pound of flour, in a circle, on a table; put into the central hollow of the flour three quarters of a pound of quite cold butter, six ounces of sugar, four526 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. yolks of eggs, a little salt; thicken the paste quickly, so as to get it stiff, without working much ; let it cool on ice for twenty minutes. Remove stones and stalks of about two gills of small sour cherries (saurc, hirschen), being quite ripe; mash a handful of the ripest ones, and press them in a cloth, to extract their juice. Pound half of the kernels in a mortar, then put them into a sugar-pan, with the juice of the cherries, and two tablespoonfuls of claret. Blitter a plain flawn-circle (cercle à flan), which place on a baking-sheet covered with paper ; spread the paste, without making use of a rolling-pin, into a round Hat, with which line the flawn-circle; trim the edges of the paste, pinch it on the top, then remove the circle, and pinch the paste all round, that is round the outer sides. Surround the flawn with a strip of paper, so .as to support the paste, till the hollow with the cherries, which press close together, and push the flawn into a mode- rate oven. Mix up in a stewpan a whole egg and a yolk of egg, a handful of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of double or sour cream ; work this preparation for two minutes, dilute with the infused juice of the cherries, stirring on the fire, only to warm it. The flawn being nearly done, take it out of the oven, and pour in at the top the juice of the cherries, then push it again into the oven. Ten minutes after, take it out for good, remove the paper, then place the flawn on a sheet of paper, blanch its sides with powder sugar. Sift over sugar also on the top, and dish up. 1175. Turkish-tawutâtalet. — Dilute half a pound of rice-flour with three glassfuls of cold cream ; pass the preparation through a sieve into a stewpan ; in which stir it well over the fire, thus getting a smooth pap (bouillie) ; at the first bubbling, add to it half a pound of powder-sugar, and let the pap reduce, for twenty minutes, on a very moderate fire. Meanwhile, take off the white breast-meat of two little chickens, remove the skin, pound them in a mortar, thus converting them to paste; add the grated zest of half a lemon, and lastly seven or eight yolks of eggs. Take the paste out, pass it through a sieve, and put this ‘purée’ into a stewpan. When the pap is quite smooth, pour it gradually over the poultry, working the prepara- tion hard ; let it boil up but once, then immediately pour it into a deep dish, or silver-pan. Adorn the surface with a few drops of caramel ; which let fall at inter- vals, and then stir to and fro, by aid of the point of a small knife, so as to imitate marbling-work. 117G. Swan’s nest (D. 251). — For six nests take four ounces of pow- dered sugar, six eggs, chopped lemon-zest. Beat eggs and sugar for a few minutes,SWEET ENTREMETS. — BABA-CAKE. 527 then add as much flour, as requisite to form a paste, of the consistence of ‘nouille’- paste. Roll this paste out, with the rolling-pin, into a thin long flat, then with a pastry-‘roulette’, divide it into strips (rubans) about half an inch thick. Take one of these strips, and twine it together in form, which place on a slightly floured stewpan-lid ; plunge it into a pan of good hot hog’s lard, or butter, withdraw Fipr. 251. to the side of the lire; then, having taken color on one side, turn it with the aid of a skimmer; after the lapse of five or six minutes, drain the swan’s nest, in order to fry the others ; sprinkle over sugar. This cake is eaten cold. This fritter must be placed in a stewpan rather higher than wide ; only one nest can be fried at a time. 1177. German (napfkuchen) baba-cake [(D. 252). — The ‘napf- Fig. 252. kuchen’ is a national dish of Germany, it is generally well prepared in all parts of the country. Pass a pound of flour through a sieve, put it into a kitchen-basin; which keep at the warm-closet for twenty minutes. Dilute an ounce of German yeast with three quarters of a glass of warm milk. With this liquid, and a quarter of the flour, form a dough in a warm basin, let it rise (at the warm-closet) to double its volume.528 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. On the other hand, take the basin holding the flour, in which form a hollow ; in this hollow put a little salt, and a quarter of a glass of warm milk. Break and beat live eggs into a little stewpan, which place at the ‘bain-marie’ ; continue beating the eggs until getting tepid, then add a quarter*of a pound of melted clarified butter ; two minutes after, pour half of this preparation into the hollow centre of the flour, with which incorporate it gradually, so as to form a consistent paste ; work then for seven or eight minutes, to give it a little consistence, and gradually introduce the remainder of the flour. The paste being light and elastic, add the dough ; work again for five or six minutes, then add a quarter of a pound of pounded sweet and bitter almonds, nearly half a pound of currants and smyrna-raisins, a pinch of chopped orange-zest, and lastly, a pinch of mace. Cover the basin, let the paste rise to double its volume. Butter with melted, clarified butter, the inside of an earthen or copper cylinder- mould, sprinkle over chopped almonds. The paste having risen, break it (with the hand), and then, taking it up in small quantities at a time, three-parts till with it the mould. Let the paste rise again, till reaching to the height of the rim. Place the mould on a small baking-sheet, push it into a moderate oven, and bake the cake for three quarters of an hour. When taken out of the oven, turn it out, and let it cool. This quantity of flour is enough for two large cakes. 1178. Bavarian ‘strudel’. — Prepare a ‘nouille -paste, with a pound of flour, nearly half a pound of butter, four whole eggs, one white of egg, a little salt, half a glassful of water ; let the water be tepid, the butter dissolved in water, so as to get the paste very elastic. Let it rest, for ten minutes, under a warm mould. Place the paste on a floured cloth, and now spread it out as thin as possible, drawing it very slowly with the fingers, aiding with the cloth. The cooks of Bavaria bring a marvelous dexterity to this proceeding. Grive the flat the shape of an oblong square. On the other hand, peel fifteen good apples, divide them in quarters, remove their core; slice, and cut them into little dice; put these into a kitchen-basin, sprinkle over a handful of fine sugar, let them macerate for twenty minutes, tossing them up from time to time. Drain them on a dish, add a few handfuls of currants, a few tablespoonfuls of chopped almonds, at last a pinch of powder-cinnamon. Spread this mixture, in a thin layer, over two thirds only of the flat, sprinkle with a little sugar; fold the paste lengthwise like a sausage, being careful to moisten it from time to time with melted butter; then range this cake in a buttered baking-sheet {plafond), giving it the spiral shape of a snail-shell ; egg it with the paste-brush, push it into a mode- rate oven, and bake it for three quarters of an hour; when taken out of the oven, sprinkle with fine sugar, divide it into large pieces, which range on a dish.529 SWEET ENTREMETS. — BISCUIT. ‘Strudel’ can also be prepared with a little milk in the ‘plafond’, so that the liquid be reduced, when the cake is baked. This is one of the national dishes of Bavaria. 1179. Biscuit ‘à la printanière’ (D. 253). — Prepare an orange-bis- cuit-paste, proceeding as described No. 1183. Butter a large domed mould, rather pointed; glaze it with sugar, and three-parts till with the biscuit-paste. Set the mould Fig. 253. on a little baking-sheet, covered with a layer of live embers ; bake the biscuit in a moderate oven for an hour. Turn it out, let it cool, and then divide it perpendicu- larly in two ; glaze the two parts on the outsides, one with white icing-sugar, the other with rose-colored. As soon as glazed, divide each of these two parts in live or six slices, cutting from the top to the bottom. The glaze being quite dry, put the cut-up pieces back into the mould, alternating them, and keep the mould on ice ; a quarter of an hour after, till the hollow with a solid preparation of strawberry-‘pain’, which is thickened to the right point by stirring it on the ice. After the lapse of half an hour, turn the biscuit out on a gum-paste-stand, adorned in imitation of a crown. Ornament the pointed ends with little balls of spun-sugar, and set on the top a little ‘pompon’, likewise in spun-sugar. 1180. Spanish biscuit. — Prepare an orange-biscuit-paste (see No. 1183), with a pound of sugar, three quarters of a pound of potato-flour, and common flour, in equal 'parts ; fourteen eggs, a little salt, and zest. Bake the biscuit in a dome-shaped mould. When taken out of the oven, cut it straight on the top, saturate little by little with a great glassful of sherry, mixed with sugar, or of goo 1 31530 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. malaga-winé ; turn it out on a dish, and saturate its surfaces also with the wine. Now mask it entirely with a layer of spun-eggs (œuf* filés). Send up separately a tureenful of apricot-marmalade, diluted with sherry. 1181. ‘Sans-souci’pudding. — Get four or five true rennet apples; peel them, remove their tough parts, cut the pulp in dice, which put into a stewpan with melted butter, sprinkle over a handful of sugar, let them toss on a brisk fire, to warm them, and immediately take them off the fire. Dilute a quarter of ft pound of flour with a glassful of warm milk, infused with vanilla; add a little salt, a little bit of butter, about half a pound of sugar; boil this preparation, stirring continually on the fire; let it take the consistence of a rather firm Gouffié’-preparation. This done, take it off' the tire, and introduce into it nearly a quarter of a pound of butter, and six yolks of eggs; twelve minutes after, introduce six or seven whites of eggs well whipped, and then at last the apples; pour it into a buttered mould, and poach it at the ‘bain’-marie’ for three quarters of an hour. When about to serve, turn the pudding out on a dish, mask it with English- cream (see No. 1263). 1182. Vienna ‘smankerl’. — Dilute six ounces of flour, with a pint and a half of good milk; add two ounces of butter, and a little salt : pass this preparation, through a sieve, into a stewpan, stir it on a moderate fire, so as to get a smooth pap (bouillie); as soon as it is quite smooth, let it reduce for a few minutes, then take it off the tire. When cold, spread half of the preparation, in a thin layer, on a baking-sheet, greased with melted veal-suet, or else with clarified butter ; spread it with the aid of a knife, giving it the shape of an oblong square. Bake the preparation in a pastry- oven, till it be dry, and of a nice color ; now remove the baking-sheet to the entrance of the oven, and with the point of a knife, cut the preparation in squares about two inches long; slip the blade of the knife under the cut parts, in order to disengage them ; keep them in the hot-closet. Warm the remainder of the preparation, add to it three or four tablespoonfuls of sugar, flavored with vanilla ; let it boil, thicken it with three or four yolks of eggs, diluted with a little cream ; at the same time, add to it three ounces of butter, work it, off the fire, pour it on a deep dish, .and dish the Gm an kerf in a group, ou the centre. 1183. Savoy-biscuit with orange (D. 254). — Put into a basin half a pound of powder-sugar, two tablespoonfuls of orange-sugar grated on the zest, a531 SWEET ENTREMETS. — BISCUIT. pinch of salt; add seven or eight yolks of eggs, work the preparation vigorously with a spoon till frothy, then introduce into it three ounces of Hour, and two ounces of potato-flour, passed through a sieve, as well as eight whipped whites of eggs. This mixture must he executed, without breaking the whites, or getting the paste knobby. Take a very clean biscuit-mould, the inside of which is dry; warm it, and butter with melted calf-kidney fat, being very hot. Drain the mould, turning it over; Fig. 251. then glaze it with tine sugar (glace dc sucre), mixed up with an equal quantity of potato-flour. With this preparation till the mould, only to three quarters of its height, but nevertheless raising the paste up to the rim, on the sides of the mould, fixing the paste on to the sides by aid of a spoon. If this precaution be taken, the biscuit will take a nice equal color, on the bottom, as well as on the top. Set the mould on a baking-sheet, covered with a layer of live embers, push it into a moderate oven, and thus let it bake for an hour. When the biscuit is taken from the oven, turn it out on a sieve. When it has cooled, pare it straight, on the side, which in the oven was uppermost : if the cake is carefully baked, it ought to be of a nice golden color; as the Savoy-biscuit is served in its natural condition (cm naturel), without being glazed. On the other hand, bake in a flat stewpan a round of‘génoise’ cake, two inches thick ; it must be a little larger than the biscuit ; mask the surfaces of these rounds with some orange-icing; place it on a dish, and set it on its centre; surround it with some small baskets imitated with mandarines; surround the round of‘génoise’ cake at its base with quarters of oranges or mandarines, which are ‘rubanés’. For the preparation of these quarters of oranges, they must first be emptied with the aid of a vegetable-spoon or copper, by a little aperture contrived on that side, on which has been the stem, of the orange. When the oranges are well cleansed inside, stop all the chinks with butter, and then place the oranges on pounded ice. ► 34*COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 532 Fill then the hollow of the oranges with alternate layers of ‘blanc-manger’, and of slightly reddened orange-jelly. The preparation having got firm, divide the oranges in quarters from top to bottom ; cut straight each of the quarters on one side, and place them in an upright position, all round the bottom-flat in ‘génoise’-cake. Take care that the jelly be not kept long in the peel of the oranges, as then it would soon turn bitter. 1184. Tailli-kataïf, Turkish fashion. — At Constantinople ‘katai'f may be purchased ready made : here I give the method of preparing it one’s-self. Prepare a very smooth frying-paste, with a pound of flour, a little salt, a pinch of sugar, a quarter of a pound of melted butter, or oil, and a little water. Introduce this paste into little cornets of strong paper, which cut in such a manner, as to get strips of paste, the thickness of Vermicelli’ : which squeeze through, on the surface of a large and buttered flat stewpan, placed on a trevet over a moderate tire. Take care not to allow the strips of paste to touch one another. When set, take them off, to repeat the operation with others; when cold, place the strips in a biscuit-mould, flat in form, and buttered; pour over clarified butter, and immediately push the mould into a very slack oven. Twenty minutes after, take it out, turn the ‘entremets’ out on a dish, pour over it a syrup flavored with orange, or with essence of roses. 1185. Blitter biscuit. — Put into a kitchen-basin half a pound of sugar, seven yolks of eggs, one whole egg, a little salt, and a pinch of chopped lemon-zest ; work this preparation till light and frothy ; then introduce into it eight whites of eggs, well whipped up, as well as half a pound of flour, passed through a sieve, very dry, but taking it only in small quantities, and alternating with half a pound of melted butter, clarified and cooled. With this preparation fill a floured and buttered biscuit-mould, bake the biscuit in a moderate oven, turn it out, let cool, and dish it on a folded napkin. 1186. Chocolate ‘éclairs’ (D. 255 ). — Take twelve ounces of ‘clioux’- paste (see No. 1219), which introduce into a bag with an iron ‘douille’ (sec D. 226), and immediately push it on a baking-sheet, at any distance wished, giving it the shape of a small round rod (baguette), being half an inch thick, and three inches long : the sticks of paste, should be, as straight as possible, and equal. Egg the surface of the cakes, bake them in a slack oven for twenty or twenty-five minutes : they must be dry; let them cool, slightly split them underneath, and fill their interior with a small portion of light ‘frangipane’-cream, flavored with vanilla (without any al- monds in). With the aid of a little paste-brush, slightly coat the upper surface of the cakes with a little apricot-marmalade.SWEET ENTREMETS. ÉCLAIRS.

Put into a little sugar-pan four ounces of powder-sugar ; moisten it with its weight of water; the sugar dissolved, let the liquid boil, and take it off the fire; with this liquid dilute the chocolate. Put all back into the little pan, boil the sugar until it be au lissé (34° Ré. 109° F.) ; at this degree the glaze ought to lino the spoon ; now rub it against the sides of the pan with the aid of a spoon ; five Fiff. 255. minutes after, dip the cakes into the chocolate-glaze, only on the side coated with marmalade, place them on a pastry - grille {see D. 258), in order to let the glaze drain. Ten minutes after, push the cakes into the oven, but mind, for five seconds only, so as to give the glaze a little brilliancy. Dish the cakes on a folded napkin. 1187. Pine-apple, Frankfort fashion (D. 256). — Cut off the crown Fig. 256. of a raw pine-apple, but let a little of the fruit adhere. Peel the pine-apple without injuring its shape, put it into a pan, moisten to cover with "boiling syrup (25°R. = 88" F.) ; cover the pan, lot the syrup cool off the fire. The pine-apple being cold, scoop it out, but leaving it a slight thickness, keep it warm (covered) with a little syrup. Remove the hard parts from the pine-apple pulp, which now cut into small dice,534 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. two thirds of which place in a stewpan, and thicken them with four tablespoonfuls of apricot-marmalade, then keep the ‘salpicon’ in the ‘bain-marie’. On the other hand, boil half a pound of rice with cream and vanilla (see No. 1156); when done, finish it with a piece of fine butter, and then with a liaison of three yolks of eggs ; add a few tablespoonfuls of reserved pine-apple ‘salpicon’, then pour it into a well buttered border-mould (with a round bottom), adorned with angelica and preserved cherries ; keep the border in the warm-closet for ten minutes, then turn the rice out on a dish, on the centre of which fix a support of fried bread, nearly the height of the border; garnish the hollow, between rice and bread, with preserved cherries, previously washed with tepid water, and well drained. Drain the pine-apple, cut half of it into slices, put it back into shape, and place it on the support of fried bread ; now till it with the previously prepared ‘salpicon’; push through the crown of the pine-apple a little silver-spit, set the crown on the fruit, which glaze (with a paste-brush) with a little of the marmalade. Send up separately a boatful of this marmalade, diluted with a little syrup of pine-apple. 1188. Small ginger-biscuits. — Put into a small copper-basin, half a pound of sugar, and three eggs ; work the preparation with the spoon, till well thickened ; add to it three eggs more, one by one ; set the basin on a very moderate tire, without ceasing to work the preparation, for ten minutes longer. Then take it off the tire, gradually introduce into it a quarter of a pound of flour, mixed with two tablespoonfuls of ginger-powder ; add a Dit of lemon-zest. With this preparation till some tin-moulds, of the shape of an oblong square : these moulds must be buttered and glazed with potato-flour. Place the moulds on baking-sheets, bake the biscuits in a hot oven for twelve minutes. 1189. ‘Mille-feuilles’-cake, Bavarian fashion. — Take a pound, or a pound and a quarter, of trimmings of puff-paste ; divide the paste into twelve parts, the size of an egg ; roll these pieces out into thin round flats, which place on several baking-tins ; cut the rounds with a ‘charlotte -mould, and bake them in a moderate oven. When these flats are taken out of the oven, keep them under a very light weight, only to level them. As soon as cold, mask them, one by one, with a layer of Bavarian-cream with vanilla; cut each of them in four pieces, which place regularly one above the other. Mask the cake also with a layer of the Bavarian-cream, sprinkle over chopped pistachios, and keep it on ice for half an hour. 1190. Héloise-cake. — Prepare a biscuit-paste in the proportions of twenty- four eggs to one pound of sugar (see No. 1183). Bake this paste in a ‘timbale’-mould. Mix up in a stewpan ten yolks of eggs with three ounces of sugar, a quarter of a pound of butter, and two tablespoonfuls of orange-flower extract; set the stewpan535 SWEET ENTREMETS. — BISCUIT. on a moderate tire, to thicken the cream, stirring continually, but not allowing to boil. The biscuit being turned out, cut it straight, divide it into very thin slices transversally, then bring it back into shape, masking each of the slices with the pre- viously prepared cream. When the cake is finished, set it on a pastry-grille, and mask it entirely with raw orange-icing-sugar. Dish this cake on a folded napkin. 1191. Wafer-biscuits (D. 257). — Pour half a pound of half melted butter into a basin, work it with a wooden spoon, till well thickened ; add to it eight /mmmm teui Fiff. 257. yolks of eggs, one by one, without leaving off working the preparation. When quite creamy, add to it gradually half a pound of very dry flour passed through a sieve, then two tablespoonfuls of sugar flavored with vanilla, eight whipped whites of eggs, and at the same time two gills of cream, whipped, firm, and well drained. Cook the wafers on a deep wafer-mould, sprinkle them with vanilla-sugar. These arc the best sort of wafer that I know of. 1192. Savarin with fruits (D. 258). — Dilute an ounce of German FiS'. 258. yeast with about a gill of tepid milk ; with this liquid, and half a pound of flour, prepare a dough in a kitchen-basin ; cover the paste, place it in a mild temperature, let it rise to double its volume. Now mix in this dough half a pound of flour, and at the same time, two whole eggs and four ounces of melted butter. Vigorously work the paste, so as to give it a good degree of stiffness, adding to it from time to time an egg, until six of them are introduced : the more the paste is worked, the more eggs it will absorb. As soon as it is thickened up to the point, that taking it with the hand is possible, mix in it four ounces of orange-sugar, and three table-536 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. spoonfuls of raw cream ; cover the basin, let the paste rise, for an hour and a half, in the temperature of the kitchen; then take it up with the hand, and with this paste three-parts fill a buttered dome-shaped mould. Let the paste rise once more, till nearly reaching the height of the mould ; im- mediately surround the sides of the mould with a strip of buttered paper ; set the mould solidly on a baking-sheet, bake the cake in a moderate oven for twenty five minutes. Taking the cake out of the oven, turn it out, and let half-cool ; cut it straight on the top, and saturate it with warm syrup, mixed with a little cognac, and a little kirsch ; place it on a pastry-grille, resting on a basin ; let it drain well, then set it on a dish, and keep it warm. On the other hand, prepare a ‘salpicon of preserved fruits, washed in tepid water ; put these fruit into a stewpan, mix in the remainder of the syrup of infusion! as well as a handful of smyrna-raisins ; let the liquid boil, thicken it with two table- spoonfuls of apricot-marmalade. At the time of serving, pour the fruits and sauce on the cake. This quantity of paste yields four cakes. 1193. Orange croquembouclie. — Choose seven or eight good fine oranges exactly ripe; remove the peel, without damaging the pulp; divide the pulp into quarters, carefully disengage all the white parts; place the quarters on a sieve, arranging one beside the other, and thus let them dry for a few hours in the temperature of the kitchen. Cut in pieces a pound of sugar, sugar from beyond sea, if possible; place it in a sugar-pan, moisten it with two gills of cold water ; when nearly dissolved, place the pan on the fire, add to it a little pinch of tart-cream ; boil it till at the degree of casse, that is to the degree, that taking a small piece of it between the wet thumb and forefinger, then quickly dipping the lingers into cold water, the sugar breaks off sharp, when trying to bend it. Above all, avoid letting the sugar take too much color. When the pan is taken off the fire, dip the bottom at once into cold water, so as immediately to stop the boiling of the sugar. Take up the orange-quarters at one end, with the aid of two fingers ; dip them into the sugar, which let drain ; then arrange the quarters of orange, one by one, on a pastry-grille (see D. 258), placing them at little distance from each other. The sugar having cooled again, take the quarters of orange up with two fingers, dip them with the side kept intact , into the ‘casse’-sugar ; arrange them at once on the bottom, and against the sides, of a middling-sized oiled Aroquembouehe’-mould, that is, a plain mould without cylinder ; these quarters of oranges must be ranged in the mould in an upright position, and in rows, one above the other; they must be fixed one to another, by means of hot sugar, into which they are dipped last of all.SWEET ENTREMETS.. — CROQI'EMBOUCHE. 537 As soon as the sugar is quite cold, disengage the ‘croquembouche’ from the mould, and turn it out on a folded napkin. 1194. ‘Petits pains’, with almond-milk (D.259).— Place on a small baking-sheet, a dozen large ‘dariole’-moulds, which surround with pounded ice; adorn them at the bottom, and all round, with preserved fruits: angelica, pine-apples, or candied peel; taking care to dip all the details of the decoration, one by one, into half-set jelly. As soon as the moulds are quite caught and set by the cold, spread them with a thin layer of ‘blanc-manger’; when this layer too is set, till the hollow with a preparation of bavarian-cream with rice, mixed up with a ‘salpicon’ of pre- served fruits. When about to serve, dip the moulds into hot water, wipe them, turn the ‘pains’ out, and dish them in a pyramidal way. 1195. Mokha ‘croquembouche’. — Prepare some common ‘choux’- paste ; take it up with a tea-spoon in small pieces, which drop on the floured slab, and roll them with the hand to a round shape. Place these pieces at little distances on a baking-sheet, egg them, bake them in a slack oven. Let these ‘choux’, when baked, be the size of a cherry. When taken out of the oven, disengage them from the baking-sheet, let them dry in warm-closet for full an hour, being placed on a baking- sheet covered with paper. Take them up, one by one, with fingers; then dip slightly, on one side only, into some ‘cassé’-sugar ; then raise them against the insides of an oiled dome-mould, fixing them on iti superposed circles, one above the other: two persons are required for this operation. The sugar having cooled, turn the ‘croquembouche’ out on a pastry-gi’ille, and immediately mask it with a thin layer of cooked coffee-icing-sugar. The glaze having got firm, disengage the ‘croquembouche^ from the pastry-grille ; dish it on a folded napkin with any garnish.538 COSMOPOLITAN COOK ELY. 1106. Glazed Gènoa-cakes (Génoise). — Weigh seven raw eggs; take the same weight of flour, the same of sugar, the same of butter, the same of al- monds. Pound the almonds ; break the eggs into a kichen-basin, add to them the sugar, work this preparation vigorously; as soon as it is light, add to it a little salt, a little chopped lemon-zest, then the flour and almonds; but taking care to do this by degrees only; last of all, add three ounces of potato-flour, then the melted butter, and four tablespoonfuls of cognac. Butter a thin baking-sheet, mask the bottom with paper, which also butter; pour the preparation on the baking-sheet, smooth it with the blade of a knife, giving it the thickness of half an inch. Bake the paste in a moderate oven for forty minutes. On taking the ‘génoise’ out of the oven, turn it out on a table covered with paper; let it cool, then divide it in strips four inches long. Now turn the strips over, in order to pare them slightly; mask them on this side with a thin layer of apricot-marmalade, mask the marmalade with a layer of icing-sugar, with rum or ‘kirschwasser’, prepared with some flue sugar (glace de sucre), (that is, some sugar passed through a silk sieve), a little water and rum; smooth tins icing-sugar with the blade of a knife, and divide the strips of ‘génoise’ transversally, in such a manner as to get cakes an inch and a half by three. Take these cakes up with the blade of a knife, as soon as cut, and place them at little distances; serve the cakes, as soon as the glaze is dry. 1197. Digestive cakes. — Weigh half a pound of flour, the same of sugar, the same of fresh eggs. Place the sugar and flour in a kitchen-basin, gradually add to them the eggs, working the preparation with a wooden spoon. After all the eggs are absorbed, still work the preparation briskly for ten minutes more; introduce it into a bag (see D. 228), and at little distances push the paste of round shape on buttered and floured baking-sheets; place on each of these parts a bit of anise, and thus bake them in a moderate oven. 1198. French-galette (D. 260). — Pass through a sieve, on the table, a pound and a half of tine flour; form a cavity in the centre, place in this a pinch of salt, a quarter of a pound of butter, and two gills of cold water. First knead the butter with the liquid, gradually introduce into it the flour, so as to get a smooth paste, such as for puff - paste ; let this paste rest for a quarter of an hour: it must not be too consistent. Knead, in a cloth, half a pound of good butter until firm; give it a flat square shape. Put on the floured table the paste previously prepared, flatten it with the hand, giving it a square shape ; on this pasie place the butter, which cover with the project- ing edges of the paste, turn (tourrcr) this paste, like puff-paste, giving it live turns;SWEET ENTREMETS. — CAKES. 539 at the last turn up, the paste must be an inch thick ; cut it, with the aid of a model in card-board, of round shape and of the size requisite, but cutting the paste with a small knife; it must be channeled. Turn this flat upside on a baking-sheet, egg its surface, on which slightly draw lines with the point of the small knife, then let it bake in a good oven for forty minutes. Sprinkle over the cake a little powder-sugar, Fig:. 2bO. previous to taking it out of the oven. On Epiphany-day it is the custom in France to hide a bean in the cake. 1199. ‘Échaudés’ cakes, Italian fashion.— With two gills of water, half a pound of flour, three ounces of butter, a little salt, a little lemon-zest, a pinch of sugar, four whole eggs, prepare some ‘choux’-paste, proceeding, as indicated in the article of St. Honoré-cake ; let the paste be ratlief consistent. With a spoon, take this paste up in small portions, which put on the floured table, and roll to a round shape: they must be of the size of a nut. Plunge these balls of paste into a large stewpan of boiling water, drain them the moment they come up to the surface, and plunge them immediately into cold water, leaving them in this water for two hours ; drain them, spunge them on a cloth, range them at little distances on baking-sheets, and bake them in a moderate oven, well closed. These cakes may be served with tea. 1200. Cherry-pie, with brown-bread. — With about a pound of tartlet-paste, mask a hot pie-mould of low shape; mask the paste at the bottom and sides, with buttered paper, fill the hollow with common flour, bake the pie in a moderate oven for half an hour. Meanwhile, prepare a biscuit-paste with brown-bread, adding a pinch of cin- namon-powder. The paste being nearly done, take the pie out of the oven, to remove the paper, and empty the mould of the flour; now fill the mould with the biscuit- paste, but in layers, and sprinkling over each of these layers with picked cherries, which have been well drained. Put by a little of the biscuit-paste for after-use, push the pie into the oven, and bake it for three quarters of an hour. Twelve or fifteen minutes previous to taking it out of the oven, mask its surface with the remainder of the biscuit-paste, smoothing it with the blade of a knife, and sprinkle over fine sugar.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 540 Push the pie once more into the oven; the sugar being glazed, take it out, and dish it. 1201. Mince-pies. — Chop tine two pounds of beef-kidney suet, free of sinew or skin ; lay it in a kitchen-basin ; mix with it one pound of cooked fillet of beef, trim- med and chopped; two pounds of sour apples, raw, peeled, and cut into small dice; two pounds of currants, well cleansed; one pound of Malaga raisins, stoned, and chopped; two pounds of candied peel of cédrat, lemon, and orange, in equal parts, also chopped, or cut into very small dice; add lastly one pound of sugar. Mix these materials well together ; moisten them with a half - bottle of cognac, and the juice of several lemons; cover, and keep them in a cool place; leave them to macerate for seven or eight days; but, as the preparation will keep quite well for a much longer time, it way be prepared in any quantity. To make mince-pies, choose some large tartlet-moulds, butter them, line them with tine short-paste; till them with the prepared mixture, moisten the edges of the paste, and cover the compound with a round tiat of short-paste, or else of puff-paste, fastening it round the edges, and making a small hole on the centre of the flat. Egg the mince-pies, bake them in a hot oven; on taking them out of the oven, filter into them a little hot cognac warmed with sugar. Serve the mince-pies on a folded napkin. \ 1202. Pitliiviers-cake, with almond-cream. — Pound four ounces of sweet and bitter almonds, with the same of sugar, and half a stick of vanilla ; add three yolks of eggs, three ounces of butter, a little chopped orange-zest, a little salt, a whole egg, and two yolks ; pass this preparation through a sieve, then put it into a basin, and stir it with a spoon for five minutes. Take a pound of puff-paste of eight turns, roll it out with a rolling-pin to the thickness of a quarter of an inch ; out of this flat cut a round of six inches diameter; this round must be cut on a model of cardboard, or with the lid of a stewpan, with the point of a small knife. Take the remainder of the paste, roll it out, and cut a round, of the same dia- meter as the first flat; place this flat on a baking-sheet, spread the almond-prepa- ration on the centre of this flat, in a smooth layer coming to within an inch of the edge; moisten with water (by aid of the paste-brush) those parts of the paste, on which the preparation does not come. Then place the first flat exactly over this, being on the baking-sheet, so as completely to mask it ; press the paste on, round the edges, so as to solder the two flats, and slightly to lessen the paste ; then cut the paste all round with the point of a small knife, channeling the paste. Egg the sur- face of the cake, draw lines over the top with the point of a knife, forming thus any fancy pattern.SWEET ENTREMETS. — CAKES. 541 Bake the cake in a moderate oven for forty-five minutes ; when done, sprinkle over fine sugar, and thus glaze.

Genoa-cake (D. 261). — Work in a kitchen - basin ; and with the aid of a spoon, one pound of powder-sugar, a pound of eggs (yolks and whites) ; add a little salt, and the grated zest of half an orange. The preparation being frothy, in- troduce into it a pound of flour, passed through a sieve, then a pound of melted butter, which is clarified and nearly cold. Spread this preparation on two buttered Fig. 201. and floured baking-sheets, giving it a thickness of a fifth of an inch. Bake it in a moderate oven. Make a model, of hexagon shape, of cardboard ; when the cake is taken out of the oven, cut oft' its surface (with the aid of the model) a dozen hexagon - shaped fiats, then immediately hollow their centre with the largest plain tin-cutter handy; place the flats one above the other, taking three and three, then let them cool under a light weight. Place the flats one by one on a ‘charlotte’-mould turned over, mask them with a layer of apricot-marmalade, on which place another fiat, joining the angles well; mask again with marmalade, and thus continue raising the cake to convenient height; pare it regularly all round, and mask it, as well on the top as all round, with tepid well reduced marmalade, which in drying may take consistence and bril- liancy. Adorn the six faces with a decoration of icing-sugar, or fruits, and slip the cake on a dish. When about to serve, fill the hollow of the cake with orange-ice or ‘plombière’-cream. 1204. Bath-cakes. — T ake a quarter of a pound of sugar, a quarter of a pound of butter, three quarters of a pound of Hour, two eggs, a gill and a half of milk, two ounces of carbonate, a pinch of flowers of nutmeg, preserved cédrat.

The paste must be of consistency just enough to keep it together, so that it does not spread, when it is placed on the baking-lieet. Now take the paste up with a tablespoon, arrange it on a baking-sheet, in pieces of the size of a nut, being careful to place them at a little distance one from the other; set on each of these pieces a pinch of preserved cédrat, cut into small dice. Let them bake in a moderate oven, and serve cold. 1205. Apple-cakes, German fashion. — Cut six tine rennet-apples in quarters ; peel, pare, mince, and put them into a stewpan, with nearly half a pound of melted butter ; let them toss on a brisk fire, until very hot, then immediately take them off the fire. Put a quarter of a. pound of flour into a kitchen-basin, dilute it with a glassful of cold milk, and four or five whole eggs ; whip the preparation well, pass it through a sieve, add three tablespoonfuls of sugar, a little orange-zest, and a little salt. Butter largely a flat stewpan, mix the apples with the cream-preparation, which pour into the stewpan ; bake the cake, in a moderate oven, for forty minutes. As soon as the preparation is set, and a little dry, sprinkle over largely powder-sugar. Ten minutes after, take it off’ the fire, to divide it into long squares; take the cakes up by aid of a flat spoon, and dish them, one by one, on a folded napkin. 1206. Saint-Amand cake (D. 262). — W arm three quarters of a pound of flour in a kitchen-basin ; take a quarter of it, which put into a little stewpan. Prepare some dough, with three quarters of an ounce of German yeast, and half a glassful of tepid milk; cover the stewpan, and keep it in the warm-closet, until the paste be risen to double its volume. Form a cavity in the remainder of the flour with the hand; place in this cavity one whole egg, and three yolks of eggs, four tablespoonfuls of tepid milk, three ounces of butter, a pinch of salt, four or five tablespoonfuls of sugar flavored with vanilla. Mix up butter, cream, and eggs; then gradually introduce the flour, keeping the paste stiff ; work vigorously for ten or twelve minutes ; add two whole eggs, one by one ; the eggs being introduced, mix the dough into the paste, which work for a few minutes more. Introduce again three ounces of butter; cover the paste, let it rise, in a moderate temperature, for one hour and a half; then work it by hand, and introduce four tablespoonfuls of whipped cream. Butter a large border - mould with a concave bottom; three-parts fill this mould with the paste, but applying it in layers, and alternating each of these layers with preserved well drained chestnuts, divided in pieces ; set the mould on a baking-sheet, keep in a moderate temperature, let the paste rise for twenty minutes; when coming nearly to the rim of the mould, cover the upper sides of the mould543 SWEET ENTREMETS. — CAKES. with a strip of buttered paper ; push it into a moderate own, and thus bake the cake for full forty minutes ; when taken out of the oven, 'let it imbibe half a glassful of maraschino ; let the cake cool, place it on a cold dish ; garnish its hollow with chest- nut-ice {glace de marrons), finished with whipped cream.

Meanwhile, spread in a circle the remainder of the flour; in the centre of which place a teaspoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls of powder-sugar, then five whole eggs, half a pound of line butter, divided in little bits. Mix together first the butter and eggs, then gradually introduce the flour into the liquid, thus getting a smooth solid paste ; work it with both hands, so as to give it yet more consistence ; five minutes after, introduce a quarter of a pound of fine butter divided into little hits, alternating them with two whole eggs. The paste being very smooth, elastic to the touch, support- ing itself, when gathered up, without sinking down ; flatten it out (with the hands), and spread the dough over its surface; cut the paste with both hands, gathering up the pieces cut off. Work the paste for three minutes more, put it then into a kitchen- basin ; cover, and let it rise. If there be time enough, let the paste rise for six hours in a cool place. ‘Brioche’-paste improves considerably, if allowed to ferment without violence; but if time presses, let it rise in the temperature of the kitchen. As soon as the paste is risen to about double its volume ; break (rompre), that is work it (with the hand), until brought to its former condition. Then place it in the temperature of the kitchen ; as soon as visibly enlarged in volume, take it out of the basin, and lay it on a floured table; beat it with (floured) hands, to flatten it, and fold the edges over the centre ; place it now on a baking-sheet ; which keep on ice, for twenty-five or thirty minutes. Butter the inside of a ‘brioche’-mould ; take two thirds of the paste, which put on the table, and mould to a ball by working it with the hands; place it in the mould, pressing the paste into the folds of the mould, thus to gain all its form ; mould the remainder of the paste into a longish shape. With three wet fingers form a cavity in the centre of the paste, which is in the mould; and into this cavity, insert the pointed side of the smaller portion of paste, which is to stand for the head of the ‘brioche’; fix it on by hand, and egg it (dorer). Set the mould on a baking-sheet, push it into a moderate oven, bake the ‘brioche’ for one hour and a quarter ; minding to cover it with paper, as soon as beginning to take color. Five minutes after, being taken from the oven, turn it out, let it cool, and then dish it on a folded napkin. Such ‘brioche’-cakes are served at breakfast or with tea. Small ‘brioches’ may be prepared in the same manner. 1208. Ricasoli-cake (D. 264). — With a pound of sugar, three quarters of a pound of flour and potato-flour, in equal parts, five ounces of melted butter, six yolks of eggs, a little salt, and a stick of vanilla ; prepare a biscuit-paste, proceeding as commonly, but notice introducing the butter after the whipped whites of eggsSWEET ENTREMETS. — CAKES. 545 With this preparation till a buttered dome-like mould glazed with potato-flour; bake the biscuit in a mild oven ; when turned out and cooled, divide it transversally in slices, then bring the biscuit back into form, one slice ofter the other, soaking each of them with a little liqueur of alkermès *, masking them one by one with a layer of ‘frangipane’ flavored with vanilla, likewise finished with a little ‘alkermès’.

Neapolitan-cake (D. 265). — Spread half a pound of flour in a Fig. 265. circle on the table ; put in the centre of the circle half a pound of good butter, the same of pounded sugar ; add to the above a little salt, a pinch of chopped leraon- * This liqueur is but little known in England, but highly estimated in Italy. It is fabricated at Florence, in the convent ‘Santa-Maria-Novclla’. Excellent .jellies are prepared with it.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 546 zest, two whole eggs, two yolks. First of all, mix butter, eggs, sugar, and almonds; then by degrees, the flour: the paste must be very smooth, and little worked ; keep it on the ice for an hour ; as soon as it is very stiff, place it on the floured table, divide it into twelve parts of the size of an egg. Roll the paste out with the rolling-pin into thin flats of round shape, being six inches wide ; take these flats up with a flat stewpan-lid, and place them on a baking - sheet ; cut them all round with the aid of a great ‘charlotte’-mould, of the diameter which is to be given to the Neapolitan-cake ; then empty the flats on the centre, with the aid of a large pastry-cutter, so as to form flat rings. Bake the flats in a moderate oven, but with the utmost care ; as all of them must be of the same color, that is yellow. On removing them out of the oven, take them up with a flat cover without breaking them, and range them one over the other, six and six. Place a ‘charlotte’-mould on these flats, so as to slightly press them, and let them cool straight. Then take the flats up, one by one, mask them on one side with apricot-marma- lade, raise them one above the other, so as to get a cake of nice shape, particularly quite straight. Slightly cut the cake all round, smooth its surfaces, then place it on a solid flat of ‘office’-paste, masked with marmalade still tepid : this marmalade must be transparent, so as to let the flats forming the cake be seen ; as soon as the marmalade has cooled, and dried, adorn the sides of the cake, with ornaments either of almond- paste, or of white puff-paste ( feuilletage à blanc), else with cut preserved or fruits, or lastly, with icing-sugar squeezed through the cornet : the decoration is entirely dependent on taste and fancy ; only it must be correct. This cake should not be served until the day following its preparation, being then more delicate. When serving, dish the cake, fill the hollow with whipped cream, sugared and perfumed ; cover it with a little ‘sultana’ in spun-sugar ; but let me ob- serve, that this last decoration is not indispensable. If the cake is to be presented to the guests, it must be cut from the top, yet without damaging its shape. 1210. Dauphin-cake (D. 266). — Mix up sixteen yolks of eggs with a pound of butter, in a basin, which set over the fire ; work the preparation, stirring, so as to thicken it, without allowing it to take color ; let it cool, add sixteen yolks of eggs more, as well as another pound of sugar ; work vigorously with a spoon, to get it light like a biscuit-preparation. Add a little salt, as well as the grated zest of one orange or lemon ; introduce into it sixteen whites of eggs, well whipped, as well as a tablespoonful of potato-flour. Pour this preparation on baking-sheets, covered with buttered paper, giving it an inch and a quarter thickness ; then bake it in a moderate oven, and let it cool.SWEET ENTREMETS. — CAKES. 547 Cut the baked biscuit up in round flats, but so graduated as to till up the dome ; raise these flats on a dish like a Neapolitan-cake, masking each of these flats with apricot-marmalade ; mask the surface with a layer of ‘meringue’, then adorn it with the cornet, in the manner represented on the drawing ; sprinkle over the decoration Fig. 266. fine sugar, and allow it to take a little color in a moderate oven. When the cake is taken out of the oven, garnish the cavities of the decoration with preserved cherries ; send up separately some apricot-sauce. 1211. Montblanc-cake (D. 267). — With some tartlet-paste (see No. 1101) line a flawn-circle, which is straight and rather high; immediately remove Fig. 267. the circle; then pinch the paste on the top, as well as against its outer sides ; wrap these then up in a strip of paper, which maintain in place with thread. Mask the paste inside, bottom and sides, with buttered paper; then fill the hollow with com- mon flour, in order to bake the paste à blanc. As soon as the flawn is taken out of the oven, unwrap it, empty it, mask the bottom, and sides all round, with a rather thick layer of apricot-marmalade ; spread then a layer of light ‘frangipane’ perfumed with orange. 35*COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 548 On the other hand, take fifteen ‘choux’-cakes of round shape, and middling size ; open them from below, and fill the hollow with a ‘bavaroise’-cream, prepared with strawberries, thickened on the ice. Close the cakes, and dip them one by one, into cooked vanilla icing-sugar ; let the icing drain a little, and immediately dish the cakes into the flawn-case, raising them in a pyramid ; as soon as the ici is cold, the cakes ought to be sticking fast together. This cake is original and excellent. 1212. Dutch-cakes. — Let me recommend this simple but good cake, to be served with ices, or with tea. Prepare a puff-paste, with a pound of flour, and three quarters of butter ; give it six turns ; when set, roll the paste out nearly half an inch thick, divide it into rounds, of two inches diameter, or rather more, with a tin-cutter channeled, as for large ‘bouchées’. Spread a layer of powder-sugar on a table ; take up the rounds of paste, one by one, dip one of their sides into the flour, the other into the sugar ; place them on the table with their sugared side up, and roll the rounds out again, giving them a length of four inches ; arrange them on a baking-sheet on their floured side, and at little distances, one from the other. Bake them in a moderate oven, giving them a nice gold color. 1213. Portuguese cakes. — Put into a kitchen-basin half a pound of flour, and six yolks of eggs ; work the preparation with the spoon, till frothy. Pound four ounces of almonds with one white of egg, pass them through a sieve into a kitchen-basin, add to them a pinch of orange-sugar, and dilute them with the juice of four oranges. As soon as the biscuit-preparation is frothy, carefully add to it four ounces of potato-flour. Now introduce into it the almonds and the orange-juice, as well as the six whipped whites of eggs. Pour the preparation on a baking-sheet with an up-standing border to it, which baking-sheet is buttered, and covered with paper ; spread the preparation in a layer an inch thick, and bake it in a moderate oven. The biscuit having cooled, pare it on the top, and mask on this side, first with a thin layer of apricot-marmalade, then with a layer of orange icing-sugar ; divide the cake immediately into long squares, let the glaze dry. Orange icing-sugar is prepared with sugar passed through a silk sieve, mixed with sugar rubbed against the peel of an orange, then grated ; this sugar is diluted, to the degree desired, with some orange-juice : this proceeding being of the utmost simplicity. 1214. Snowball-cakes (D. 268, 269). — For the preparation of these cakes, two or three moulds of round form, the size of an orange, must be at disposal.SWEET ENTREMETS. — CAKES. 549 These moulds are furnished with hinges, so as to open in two in the middle ; the two parts arc concave, and pierced close with little holes, like a fine sieve {see the drawing, D. 268). Pass half a pound of flour, through a sieve, on a table ; spread it out in a circle, into the centre of which pour half a glass of white wine, add three yolks of eggs, a tablespoonful of sugar, a little salt ; introduce the flour into the liquid, so as to get a smooth paste, the consistence of a ‘nouille’-pastc ; give it six turns, proceeding as for puff-paste; divide it into twelve pieces, which roll out, with a rolling-pin, into thin round flats. Fig. 208. Fig. 269. Cut the paste into strips, with the aid of a pastry-‘roulette’, but without cutting through the edges of the round, which now take up with the handle of a wooden- spoon, with which handle, introducing it between, gather up the strips of paste cut with the pastry-‘roulette’, let the paste drop off the spoon into the mould, which close with the hinge adhering to it ; plunge them in hot fat ; six minutes after, drain the balls on a sieve, and open them to take out the cakes; roll them in vanilla-sugar; keep them in the warm-closet, then dish them in a little basket of ‘office’-paste, or gum-paste. 1215. Milan-cake. — Work in a kitchen-basin half a pound of sugar, with two whole eggs, and two yolks of eggs, as for biscuit; as the preparation gets frothy, add two tablespoonfuls of chopped almonds, passed through a small sieve, then half a pound of melted butter ; work the preparation for three minutes more, introduce into it half a pound of flour, as well as four tablespoonfuls of preserved ‘cédrat’ : the paste must be kept stiff. Take it up, with a tablespoon, in pieces the size of a nut ; which place on a slightly floured table, roll them up, by hand, to get them round; arrange them, one by one, on a baking-sheet, but at a little distance one from the other. Bake the cakes in a moderate oven for fourteen or fifteen minutes. This quantity of paste gives twenty-four cakes.550 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 1216. Grenades with cherries. — Cut in two seven or eight little dinner-rolls, of well set firm crumb ; trim each of these halves, to give it the shape of an egg, by removing the crust ; let them soak in cream, with sugar and vanilla, mixed up with a few yolks of eggs ; drain them with the hand without injuring their shape, dip them in beaten eggs, bread-crumb them, and allow to take a nice color in the frying-pan with clarified butter. Drain them again, sprinkle over sugar flavored with vanilla ; dish them, pour over a cherry-sauce prepared thus : Cherry-sauce for ‘entremets’. — Put into a skillet two handfuls of sour cherries without stones or stalks : add four or five tablespoonfuls of powder-sugar, a glass- ful of red wine, a little stick of cinnamon, a half-zest of lemon ; let the liquid vigo rously bubble up a few times, then thicken it with a few tablespoonfuls of potato- flour diluted with cold water. 1217. Ramazan-cakes (malibe), Turkish fashion. — Dilute half a pound of rice-flour with two glasses of milk ; pass the preparation, through a sieve, into a stewpan ; let it boil on a moderate fire, stirring ; put enough sugar, let it reduce for seven or eight minutes, then add a few drops of extract of roses, or of jessamine; turn it out on a round baking-sheet, previously moistened with cold water, giving it nearly an inch thickness ; smooth its surfaces. The preparation being cold, sprinkle over fine sugar, and then divide it into small cakes, either round, oblong, or lozenge-shaped. 1218. Anise-cakes. — Beat five whole eggs with a pound of sugar; the preparation being frothy, introduce a pound of flour, and a pinch of anise ; take the preparation up with a spoon in small portions, which place at distances on a buttered baking-sheet ; keep the baking-sheet for twenty-five minutes in the warm-closet, bake the cakes in a moderate oven. 1219. Saint-Honoré-cake, with cream (D. 270). — ‘Choux’-paste: — Pour into a stewpan a glass of water, add a little salt, a pinch of sugar, a piece of lemon-zest, not quite a quarter of a pound of butter ; let the liquid boil, then take it off the fire. Remove the zest, and immediately introduce half a pound of flour, thus forming a smooth and consistent paste ; which dry on the fire for four or five minutes ; change the stewpan, and introduce one by one four whole eggs, as well as a quarter of a pound of butter. Spread over a tart-sheet (tourtière) a flat of short-paste of eight or ten inches, and cut it round. Introduce the ‘choux’-paste into a silk-bag, and push all round the flat a string the thickness of a common sausage: egg {dorer) the paste, prick the centre of the flat, push the tart-sheet into a moderate oven. With the remainder of the paste push on a baking-sheet, with the bag, some little ‘choux’, round in form, and bake them in the oven.SWEET ENTREMETS. — CAKES. 551 Put into a stevvpan a quarter of a pound of flour, half rice-flour, half of wheat ; add four yolks of eggs, a little salt, a quarter of a pound of powder-sugar, a piece of lemon-zest ; dilute the preparation with a glass of milk, stir it on a moderate tire ; at the first signs of bubbling, remove it back, and introduce four whites of eggs well whipped ; continue stirring until nearly cold. Fig. 270. The crust of the cake being baked and cold, take the little ‘choux’, and dip, one by one, in ‘cassé’-sugar {sucre au cassé); then place them, one beside the other, on the top of the circle of ‘choux’-paste ; on each of these ‘choux’ set immediately a preserved cherry, likewise dipped in ‘cassé’-sugar. Now slip the cake on a dish, fill the hollow with the cream-preparation ; and, twenty minutes afterwards, send it up. 1220. Prascati-cake, warm (D. 271). — Bake a fine orange-biscuit Fig. 271. (.see No. 1183) in a round ‘timbale’-mould ; when taken out of the oven, turn the ‘timbale’ over on a dish, trim it straight on the top, divide it transversally into slices half an inch thick ; then divide each of the slices in four pieces, which place on the centre of a dish, one above the other; now bring the cake back into form; but taking care to pour over each of the slices a few tablespoonfuls of English-cream, perfumed with orange; and sprinkle over each of them a pinch of preserved orange- peel, cut up in very fine dice. The cake being mounted, surround its base withCOSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 552 . halves of apples ‘en hérisson’, that is cooked in butter, tolerably firm, glazed with apricot-marmalade, then studded with dried fillets of almonds, sprinkled with sugar, and glazed in the oven, or with the salamander. Put on the top also one of these halves of apples, and with the cake serve some English-cream. 1221. Mokha-cake ‘à la moderne’. — Prepare a ‘madeleine’-pastc with eight ounces of sugar, seven ounces of flour, a tablespoonful of potato-flour, seven ounces of butter, six yolks of eggs, one whole egg, six whipped whites of eggs, two tablespoonfuls of cognac, and a little salt (see No. 1196). Bake this pre- paration in a buttered plain cylinder-mould ; when done, take from the oven, turn it out, and let it cool. Beat hard four or live whites of eggs ; when firm, introduce into them half a pound of powder-sugar ; whip this preparation over the fire, until well thickened ; let it nearly cool, without ceasing to work it ; then add to it a quarter of a glassful of exceedingly strong coffee-infusion, or extract of coffee ; thus giving the preparation a dark color. Soften half a pound of sugar by handling it in a cloth, put it into a kitchen- basin, and work it with a spoon ; as soon as turned creamy, gradually introduce into it the coffee-preparation. The biscuit being cold, cut it straight, divide it in thin transversal slices ; mask each of these slices with a layer of the preparation ; bring the cake back into form, and mask it, all round and on the top, with another layer of the preparation ; smooth its surfaces, adorn, and dish it on a folded napkin, garnish the hollow with the re- mainder of the preparation. 1222. Fortress of biscuit (D. 273). — Work well in a kitchen-basin a pound of powder-sugar, flavored with orange, with four whole eggs, and twelve yolks of eggs ; the preparation being frothy, gradually introduce into it a little more than three quarters of a pound of melted clarified butter ; continue working. A few minutes after, introduce into it four tablespoonfuls of rum, a little salt, then five or six whipped whites of eggs, as well as half a pound of flour, or potato-flour, passed through a sieve. Take a tin-case, the height and width intended for the fortress ; butter its inside with clarified butter, and glaze it with fine sugar ; set it on a round thick baking- sheet covered with buttered paper ; fill it, nearly to its height, with the previously prepared biscuit-paste; which now bake, in a moderate oven, for one hour and a quarter. Bake the remainder of the paste in a flat stewpan, being an inch and a quarter larger than the tin-case. The biscuit of the tin-case being turned out, and cooled, cut it straight; then diminish its thickness, from the bottom up to about three quarters of its height, so asSWEET ENTREMETS. CAKES. 553 to leave on the top a border in relief ; now slightly empty out from the top, so as to give the upper circle of the top a thickness of but one third of an inch ; by aid of a little knife cut the upper border into battlements : the biscuit may be cut very neatly. Now pierce the sides of the paste in imitation of loop-holes, two of which arc furnished witli guns imitated in biscuit. Of these guns nothing is to be seen but the muzzles, they arc fixed on their place at the last moment. Fig. 272. With a clear icing-sugar perfumed with orange-zest, and slightly colored, mask all the surface of the biscuit, set it on a pastry-grille (.see D. 258) ; adorn the sides of the biscuit with white icing-sugar, squeezed through a cornet, so as to imitate the hewn stones of a fortress. HoIIoav the dish-biscuit, leaving the sides more than half an inch thick; cut these sides into battlements, in the same manner as the upper border, and likewise mask them with icing-sugar. The icing-sugar being dry, slip the bottom on a dish, place the large biscuit in the centre, garnish its inside with a ‘plombierc’-cream, that is, with ice-vanilla, mixed up with whipped-cream. 1223. Mousseline-cake. — With half a pound of orange-flavored-sugar, a third of a pound of flour, two ounces of potato-flour, eight yolks of eggs, eight whipped whites of eggs, the peel of an orange grated on sugar, and a little salt, make a preparation of orange-biscuit; bake it in a shallow mould, of the form and diameter of the bottom of a dish. The biscuit being taken from the oven, turn it out of the mould, and let it cool. Put into a little pan four or tive tablespoonfuls of‘purée’, of strawberry and raspberry mixed; introduce immediately into it orange-powder-sugar, in a quantity sufficient to form a mixture, the consistence of a frying-paste. Warm it quite gently, stirring. but not allowing it to boil.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 554 Take four whipped whites of eggs, firm, which introduce into the fruit-prepara- tion, so as to get a sort of Italian-‘méringue’, into which now mix the juice of a lemon, and introduce it into a silk-bag. Empty part of the biscuit from the top, place it on a pastry-grille, moisten it with a few tablespoonfuls of curaçao; fill the hollow with the preparation of whipped eggs, raising it in a pyramid ; which adorn in the shape of a pine-apple. Prepare a light icing-sugar with two tablespoonfuls of ‘purée’ of strawberries and raspberries, powder-sugar, a few drops of water. Mask the preparation, as well as the cake, with this glaze ; which let dry for half an hour. When about to serve, dish the ‘entremets’ on a folded napkin. This cake, although so very simple, is a very estimable innovation. 1224. ‘Nouille’-cake with sabayon. — With five yolks of eggs, and the requisite flour, prepare a ‘nouille’-paste; divide this paste, roll it out, then cut it into very thin fillets. Plunge the brouilles’ into a pint of milk in ebullition ; add a handful of sugar, and four ounces of butter; three minutes afterwards, remove the liquid back to the side of the fire, in order to let them simmer gently, adding four ounces of lemon or orange sugar. The preparation being of a nice consistence, take it off the fire, introduce into it seven or eight yolks of*eggs. Now pour the preparation on a buttered baking-sheet, giving it about half an inch thickness, and smoothing it with the blade of a knife. Push the baking-sheet into a moderate oven ; the preparation having taken a nice consistence, turn it out on another baking-sheet, and thus let it bake for ten minutes more; after which take it out, and sprinkle over powder-sugar. The preparation having half-cooled, divide it in rounds with the aid of a paste- cutter, or else in long squares with a knife. Dish these cakes in a circular, order, and keep them warm. With good white wine prepare some ‘sabayon’ (see No. 1114); a part of which pour into the centre of the circle, sending up the remainder. These cakes may be glazed or masked with ‘meringue’. 1225. Condé-cakes. — Roll out half a pound of puff-paste at eight turns, or simply some trimmings of puff-paste, two lines thick. Divide the paste in strips four inches wide, mix four ounces of chopped almond with four ounces of powder- sugar, add two whites of eggs ; mask the paste with the almond-preparation, which smooth with the blade of a knife. Then divide these strips transversally into long squares an inch and a half wide. As soon as all the strips are cut, sprinkle over a little sugar perfumed with vanilla, take them up with the blade of a knife, and range them, a little distant one from the other, on baking-sheets ; bake the cakes in a slack oven, and as soon as taken out, slightly trim them straight.SWEET ENTKEMETS. CAKES. ooo 1226. Little cream-bucket (D. 273). — Take a wafer-preparation of almonds, in the proportions prescribed in No. 1083 ; spread it, on a waxed and floured long baking-sheet, in a layer not too thin ; when taken out of the oven, cut the cake in a strip of twenty-five or twenty-six inches, by five or six. Cut the ends slantwise in the same direction, apply this strip against a model of thin wood, made for this purpose and of bulking shape ; cut it narrowly, keep it in form with paper ; as soon as the cake is cold, solder it interiorly with the aid of a support of paste, Fig. 273. fixed with icing-sugar. Fix then on the top of the bucket two parallel handles, formed with the same paste, and pierced through ; surround the body of the bucket with hoops, imitated in almond-paste; fix it on the centre of a dish, till it, at the moment, with ‘plombière’-cream, or some whipped-cream. 1227. Parisian ‘d’artois’-cakes. — Spread on a baking-sheet a flat of thin tine short-paste, mask it with a layer of apple-marmalade, reduced with a little apricot, applying this layer half an inch thick. Equalise the surface, then masking it with thin slices of fresh apples, cut thin, passed under a round tin-cutter, and divided in the middle; range these apples symmetrically, setting them à cheval, so that the marmalade be entirely wrapped up. Sprinkle over the apples tine sugar, push the baking-sheet into a moderate oven; as soon as the paste is done, taking the flat out of the oven. Mask the apples with a paste-brush, dipped in vanilla-syrup, cooked à la nappe with a little apple-juice ; then divide the flat into long squares, thus forming the cakes. 1228. Savoy-COmpÔte. — This compote is composed of fruits and vege- tables half preserved : fruits used are : small pears, green almonds, orange or lemon- peel, gooseberries. The vegetables employed are : carrots, french-beans, cucumbers, • gerkins. The carrots are cut into small balls, the french-beans, gerkins, and556 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. cucumbers, are previously colored green {reverdis). The fruits are likewise cut. either in balls, or in lozenges : the almonds, as well as the gooseberries, are also colored green. The fruits and vegetables are boiled in water, then half-preserved ; which means, that there is given to them three or four façons with sugar. To give such ‘façons’, having blanched the fruits and vegetables thoroughly, they must be separately placed in little kitchen-basins, and covered with tepid syrup at 15° (R. 66° F). Ten hours after, drain the syrup of each, one by one, mix in it separately a little sugar, and boil it giving it three degrees more heat. As soon as it has lost the greatest heat, pour it on the fruits or vegetables. Repeat the same operation ten or twelve hours after. The fruits and vegetables being well penetrated by the sugar, drain them, mix them up well in one large basin, moisten them just to height with vinegar-syrup at 30° (R. 100° F). This compote is very good, and may be served with roasts and game. 1229. Cremona compote. — The North-Italians are great admirers of this compote, which by them, as well as by the Germans, is eaten with roast-meat. Drain of their syrup four pounds of fruits nearly finished preserving, such as apricots, plums, small pears, green almonds, melons, greengages; put them all together in a kitchen-basin, rather higher than broad, or else in a jug. Boil a pint of syrup of 28° (R. 95° F), mix in this syrup half a gill of vinegar; let it boil, and half-cool. Put into a basin nearly two gills of powder-mustard diluted with water; gradually add to it the syrup, without ceasing to stir it with a spoon. Pour this preparation on the fruits, and thus let them macerate for twenty- four hours, previous to serving them. 1230. Russian-compotes. — Choose two good pears and two apples; divide them in quarters, peel them, remove all the hard parts; cut the pulp in thin slices. Divide also in little quarters two or three good oranges ; pare the pulp to the inner skin, removing the pips. Take the quarter of a pine-apple, peel it thoroughly (h vif), then cut its pulp into thin and straight slices. Dish these fruits in a compote-dish, arranging it in layers, intermingling the various sorts and shades, and sprinkling over each layer some pounded sugar flavored with vanilla; cover the compote-dish, and thus keep it on the ice lor an hour. When time to serve the compote, drain the syrup in a little kitchen-basin, and add to it two or three tablespoonfuls of fine Champagne, that is, of old and good cognac, or else kirshwasser. Pour this mixture on the compote.SWEET ENTREMETS. — COMPOTES, JELLIES. 557 1231. Mixed compote (D. 274). — The compote represented by this drawing, is of a fine effect, notwithstanding its great simplicity. It is composed firstly of a glassful of currant-, raspberry-, or quince-jelly ; this jelly is turned out on the centre of a dish, and surrounded with a fine circle of halves of peaches, apples, or pears, pared to a round shape. This circle is ornamented, on the top, with leaves imitated in angelica, and its base is surrounded with a circle of cherries or mirabels. These kinds of jellies admit of a manifold variety. 1232. Jelly-‘macédoine’, with maraschino (D. 275, 276). — Take a (double-bottomed) ‘macedoine’-mould, embed it with pounded ice, then till the double-bottom also with ice. Take a clear jelly-preparation (.see No. 1241); let it cool, add a glass of mara- Fig. 275. Fig. 276. schino. With this preparation fill the hollow of the mould, round the double-bottom, and let it set for half an hour. Take out the ice from the double-bottom, which immediately fill with warm water, then lift it out, after having been unhooked. Prepare a ‘macédoine’ of either raw or cooked fruit, of varied kinds and shades, which drain and spunge on a cloth. Take the remainder of the maraschino-jelly, and pour it into a copper-basin, which set on ice ; as soon as beginning to thicken, add to it the ‘macédoine’ of fruit; then take the preparation up with a tablespoon, and with it fill the hollow left by the double-bottom. An hour after, turn the jelly out on558 COSM<)POLITAN COOKERY. a gum-paste stand, either green or red, adorned in white; surround this stand with slices of raw pine-apple, having macerated in syrup for full an hour, then immediately send up the ‘entremets’. 1233. Raspberry-jelly. — Put into a kitchen-basin, half a pound of fresh, quite ripe, and plucked raspberries ; add two tablespoonfuls of powder-sugar, crush the raspberries, pour them on a tine, clean sieve, placed over a china-basin, so as to gather their juice. Mix in this juice that of two oranges, and filter on a sieve, or through a glass-funnel, with a paper without glue, well softened with water, and torn up into little pieces : this method of filtering fruit being the best and most simple of all. Soften fifteen or sixteen leaves of ‘gelatine’, and then dissolve it with water enough to three-parts fill a jelly-mould ; add three quarters of a pound of powder- sugar, then clarify the preparation with two whites of eggs, and the juice of a few lemons (.see No. 1241). As soon as the preparation becomes limpid, let all its heat be cooled, before mixing in the juice of the raspberries ; then pour it immediately into a jelly-mould, embedded on pounded ice. Three quarters of an hour after, turn the jelly out on a dish, the mould having been dipped into warm water. Those jellies prepared with the juice of red fruit, must be kept in the mould as little time as possible, as the contact of tin injures their color. 1234. Barberry-jelly (d’épines vinettes). — Detach the fruit from the bunches, take three handfuls of the berries, which throw into two gills of boiling light syrup; then immediately take the syrup off the fire, and thus let the fruit infuse for half an hour; now filter the syrup, and mix it up with fifteen leaves of clarified ‘gélatine’, proceeding as prescribed No. 1241 ; pass it through a sieve. Try a little part of the preparation, to ascertain if it be of the requisite consistence; if so, pour it into a jelly-mould, to let it set on ice. Then turn it out on a dish, the mould having been dipped quickly into warm water. 1235. Jelly, Russ fashion. — Take a wrought jelly-mould, fill it three- parts full with soft jelly, limed to the degree requisite ; pour this jelly into a copper- basin, mix in a quarter of a glassful of rum, the same of cognac, and the same of filtered orange-juice ; add to the above a little zest of lemon and orange ; five minutes after, pass the preparation, through a sieve, into a copper-basin ; whip it slightly on the ice, until beginning to lose its clearness, and to thicken, but yet without turning it frothy. This done, add to it four or five tablespoonfuls of raw pine-apple, cut in dice. Pour the jelly into the mould, previously embedded in pounded ice. An hour after, dip the mould in water, and turn the jelly out on a very cold dish, serving it without delay.SWEET ENTREMETS. JELLIES. 559 1230. Curacao-jelly (D. 277). — Prepare a pint of clear jelly (see No. 1241); when filtered, and nearly cooled, add to it three quarters of a glass of ‘curaçao’ a little sirup, and pour it into a jelly-mould embedded on ice.- Three quar- ters of an hour after, dip the mould into warm water, wipe it well, and turn the jelly Fig. 277. out on a small gum-paste stand, which surround with quarters of oranges, decorated with ribands of rose-colored jelly, and ‘blanc-manger’. To obtain such quarters it is requisite first to empty the oranges, then set them on ice, till in layers of alternate shades, and divide them, as soon as the preparation has set. 1237. Jelly, English fashion (D. 278, 279). — Of the two drawings Fig. 278. 27!). at the head of this article, the first represents a plain mould, without cylinder, of six channelings. The second one represents seven spiral tubes, which are moveable, and disposed on a sheet, cut just of the dimensions and outlines of the mould, so as to adapt themselves to this mould, to which the tubes serve as a double-bottom ;560 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. each of them is garnished inside with a eylindric tube, serving for the escape of the air. For the preparation of this tine 'entremets’, a mould must tirst of all be embedded on pounded ice; this done, the double-bottom put into the interior, adjusting it on the top of the mould. Meanwhile, have ready a very white jelly-preparation, that is, of as little color as possible; then prepare a ‘blanc-manger’ or 'bavaroise’-cream, which may be colored according to taste, either pink with vegetable carmin, or else green with pistachios : this preparation may likewise be left entirely white. The double-bottom once introduced into the mould, the latter must be tilled with jelly, and left to set completely : the tubes must then be removed, one by one, tilling them with hot water, and turning them in the direction of their screwing. Only now should the white or colored preparation be introduced into the hollow left by the tubes : this operation being of the utmost simplicity. The preparation in the tubes having become firm, the mould is dipped into warm water, and the jelly is turned out on a cold dish. The shades of the prepa- ration, looking out from between the light tint of the jelly, are of a fine effect. But an equally beautiful variation is to be effected by operating with rose-colored jelly, and a preparation of 'blanc-manger’ left in its natural condition. The mould, as well as its double-bottom, arc both to be had in London. 1238. Jelly with cresses. — Clarify sixteen or eighteen leaves of ‘géla- tine’ with twelve ounces of sugar, the water requisite, two whites of eggs, and the juice of two lemons (sec No. 1241); pass it through a filtering-bag. Pound, in a well cleansed mortar, two or three handfuls of fresh well-washed water-cresses, add half a glassful of cold water ; press it well in a cloth, in order to extract the liquid ; filter this on a little sieve, the bottom of which is masked with a layer of torn, softened, and chopped paper. The juice once passed, mix it with the cold jelly, embedded on the pounded ice. An hour after, the jelly should have set; turn it out on a dish. ' 1239. Mandarine-jelly (D. 280). — Get some good* large ‘mandarines’, very firm; cut them down from the top on both sides, leaving a little strip in the middle, and form a kind of little basket (panier) with a rounded handle, in the manner represented by the drawing ; remove the pulp, preserving the form oi little baskets ; carve (ciseler) the peel all round, removing the white skin adhering to tb« inside; plunge them into boiling water, and immediately drain them, in order to plunge them into cold water. Press the juice out of the pulp of the 'mandarines’, and filter it ; take half a pint of jelly, clarified in the conditions prescribed in No. 1241 ; let it infuse some parts of mandarine-zest, add to it the filtered juice ; ten minutes after, pass it through a sieve.SWEET ENTREMETS. —• JELLIES. 561 Drain the little baskets, spunge them, fill up the openings with butter; range them, each as soon as ready, on a thick layer of pounded ice, and fill them with the jelly ; let the jelly be delicate, and not too limed. An hour afterwards, dish the little baskets on a little stand of biscuit or ‘génoise’- cake, glazed, placed on a dish, and bearing on its centre a little support. Fig. 280- It is convenient to observe, that the jelly be not kept shut up too long in the skin of the ‘mandarines’, lest it should turn of a bitter taste, which is very disagreeable indeed. 1240. Jelly-‘rubanée’ (D. 281). — Take fifteen leaves of ‘gélatine’, with which prepare about a pint of clear white jelly, freed of all flavor ; divide this jelly Fig. 281. in two parts, one holding a third of the jelly, the other two thirds. Mix into the less quantity four tablespoonfuls of juice of strawberries, or raspberries, as well as a tew drops of vegetable carmine, thus giving it a nice rose-colored hue. Mix into the larger portion of the jelly, a few tablespoonfuls of liqueur, with white vanilla-cream; being careful not to mix in the liqueurs, until the jelly has lost all its heat. 365(52 COSMOPOLITAN C< )OKERY. Embed a cylinder-mould with pounded ice, garnish also the cylinder of the mould; on the bottom of which pour a layer of white jelly, the thickness of which ought to be equal to a fifth of the height of the mould. As soon as this layer has set, pour on another layer of the same thickness, but of red color. Finish thus filling the mould, alternating the shades, but not waiting till the layer of jelly, on which the next one is to be poured, be getting too firm; as then the two preparations would not fix together, and might perhaps fall asunder, when the jelly is turned out. Three quarters of an hour after, dip the mould quickly into warm water, wipe it, and turn the jelly out on a small gum-paste stand, decorated, and having a hollow on its centre; a support masked with gum-paste can be fixed on the stand. Set on the top of this support a little ‘égrette’ of spun-sugar. Surround the base of the decorated stand with meringued fruit-tartlets. The top of the stand may be orna- mented with a little border in gum-paste. 1241. Champagne-jelly in glasses. — Lay fifteen leaves of ‘gelatine’ in a kitchen-basin; moisten largely with cold water, let it soften for half an hour; drain, and put it into a stewpan with three glassfuls of warm water, thus diluting it, continually stirring ; then mix into it three quarters of a pound of sugar ; take it off the fire, and let it cool. Put a white of egg on a plate, beat it with a fork for a few moments, add to it the juice of three lemons and one orange, as well as a quarter of a glass of cold water ; pour the liquid into the stewpan containing the ‘gélatine’, whipping the preparation briskly with a kitchen-whip. Set it on the fire, without ceasing to whip, and let it froth until beginning to rise in bubbles; set it immediately on the side of the fire, so that the liquid preserve the same degree of heat, without allowing it to boil; cover the stewpan, put a few live embers on its lid. A quarter of an hour after, pour the jelly, either into a cotton-bag, or on a napkin, and filter it until flowing quite clear; let it cool, and mix with it half a bottle of good dry champagne; try the preparation, and ascertain its consistence; then pour it into champagne-glasses, but avoid letting the liquid rise up to the brim. Place these glasses in a bucket, surrounding them with pounded ice; cover the vase, and thus let the jelly set. On the other hand, let a little jelly dissolve, which pour into a round copper- basin, and whip, until white, and quite frothy ; thên take it up with a tablespoon, put a little of it into each of the glasses, as soon as the jelly is set. Let the froth cool, wipe the glasses, and dish them. 1242. Dantzig-jelly. — Clarify sixteen or eighteen leaves of good ‘géla- tine’.

Now add to it two tablespoonfuls of slices of quite fresh pistachios, cut very thin ; pour it into a cylinder-mould embedded with ice. An hour after, dip the mould into warm water, and turn out the jelly on a cold dish. 1243. ‘Pain’ of strawberries (D. 282). — Pass half a pound of good tine strawberries, through a tine sieve. Dilute the "purée’ with the juice of two Fig. 282. oranges, and two glassfuls of clear sweetened jelly ; add a little orange-zest, pass the preparation once more through a sieve, pour it into a sugar-pan, and thicken, it, slightly stirring, on ice. Spread a jelly-mould with clear jelly, surround it with pounded ice, and now till with the strawberries-preparation. Three quarters of an hour later, dip the mould into warm water, wipe it, and turn the ‘pain’ out on a small stand in gum-paste, which surround with little ‘bouchées’ glazed, partly white, partly pink. 1244. Moscovite jelly. — Prepare some jelly with eight or ten leaves of ‘gélatine’, twelve ounces of sugar, a mould-ful of water, two whites of eggs, and the juice of two lemons ; pour the preparation iinto a copper-basin, let it cool, then mix with it a quarter of a glassful of kirschwasser ; stir it with a spoon on the ice, until beginning to thicken ; this done, take it off, without delay, take it up with a spoon, and pour a layer into a jelly-mould, embedded (frappé) with salted ice. Mask this layer of jelly with a layer of preserved fruits (stoned), softened in warm water, and divided in small pieces; mask these fruits with another layer of jelly, i continuing thus until the mould be full. If it has no lid, the mould must be covered with a round of paper, then with a middling-sized flat pan filled with salted ice. Thirty-five minutes after, take the mould off the ice, wash it, quickly dip it into warm ■water, and turn the jelly out on a very cold dish. 3G *COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 564 1245. Peacll-‘pain’, with maraschino. — Peel a dozen middling-sized peaches quite ripe ; remove the stones, pass the pulp through a fine sieve; put the ‘purée’ into a little copper-basin, mix into it a glassful of syrup, slightly perfumed with vanilla, mixed with ten or twelve leaves of dissolved ‘gelatine’. Set the basin on the ice, and whip the preparation till beginning to thicken; this done, mix in a quarter of a glassful of ‘maraschino’ and a little good ‘kirschwasser’, then five or six tablespoonfuls of whipped and sweetened cream ; pour the preparation into a jelly-mould, embedded with pounded ice. Cover the mould, and keep it thus for full an hour. When about to serve, dip the mould into warm water in order to turn the ‘pain’ out. 1246. ‘Pain’ of red-currants. — Pick a few handfuls of red-currants; which mash with a wooden spoon, and pass, through a sieve, into a kitchen-basin : tinned metal ought never to come in contact with ‘purée’ or juice of red fruit. Give sugar to the ‘purée’, which dilute with the juice of two oranges, as well as with dissolved and clarified ‘gélatine’ about fifteen leaves. Ten minutes after, pass the preparation, through a sieve, into a sugar-pan; try a little part of it, and stir it on ice, to thicken it; then pour it into a mould embedded with pounded ice, and coated (chemisé) with jelly. An hour after, dip the mould in warm water, then turn the ‘pain’ out on a cold dish. 1247. Apricot-‘pain,’ Paris fashion. — Dissolve fifteen leaves of ‘gé- latine’ with a glassful and a half of water ; with this liquid, dilute an equal quantity of sweetened apricot-‘purée’ or marmalade ; mix into the preparation the juice of an orange, and a little zest, pass it through a fine sieve, stir it on the ice, and slightly thicken it. Embed with ice a dome-shaped mould, let the bottom of this mould take a layer of the preparation ; as soon as this layer is firm, set on the centre of the larger mould, another smaller mould of the same shape, full of pounded ice; pour the liquid preparation all round this second mould, so as to fill the space left lree between the two moulds ; as soon as this preparation too is firmly set, remove the ice from the little mould and replace it by water, so as to be able to remove the inner mould. On the other hand, pour into a copper-basin half a glassful of cold vanilla-syrup, mixed with four or five dissolved leaves of ‘gélatine’ ; stir the preparation on the ice, so as slightly to thicken it, introduce into it two gills of whipped cream, as well as a few very fresh strawberries cut in two ; immediately pour the preparation into the hollow left by the smaller mould ; let it set, and as soon as it has got firm, turn the ‘pain’ out on a cold dish.565 SWEET ENTREMETS. — BLANC-MANGER. 1248. Strawberry-Bavarois, English fashion (D. 283). — Pluck a plate of line fresh strawberries, which mash, mixing in a handful of powder-sugar, and pass through a sieve ; keep this ‘purée’ in a china-vase, as it ought not to come in contact with tinned copper. Pour eight dissolved leaves of ‘gélatine’ into a pan, add half a pound of pounded sugar ; as soon as the latter is dissolved, remove this preparation back ; add to it the Fig. 283. juice of an orange, as well as a little zest ; then pass it through a sieve into another stewpan ; stir it, off the lire, until cold; gradually introduce into it the strawberry - ‘purée’. Set the pan on the ice, stir the preparation, till well thickened ; this done, add four tablespoonfuls of whipped cream. Two minutes after, pour this preparation into a china dome-shaped mould, previously oiled and embedded in ice. When the preparation is set, turn the ‘bavarois’ out on a small stand of ‘génoise’- cake, cut the size of the plate, and glaze’it with vanilla. On the border of this stand dish a chain of small emptied ‘savarins’, tilled likewise with the strawberry - prepara- tion, slightly glazed with orange. Set on the top a line large strawberry. 1249. ‘Blanc-manger’, Russ fashion. — Take half a gill of sweet- ened almond - milk, perfumed with orange - zest ; add six leaves of dissolved ‘gélatine’, pour it into a sugar-pan, thicken it on ice, continually stirring; introduce into it two glassfuls of whipped cream. Pour this preparation into a dome-shaped mould, previously embedded with pounded and salted ice ; shut the mould, solder its junctures with paste, cover it with salted ice. One hour after, dip the mould in tepid water, and turn the ‘blanc-manger’ out on a folded napkin. 1250. Parisian ‘blanc-manger’.— Pick about half a pound of fresh filberts, which have pounded together with a few tablespoonfuls of water, moisten with five gills of vanilla-syrup, pass it through a tammy. Mix the preparation up with566 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. the value of eighteen leaves of clarified ‘gelatine’, then with half a gill of ‘noyau’- liqueur, and the same of maraschino. Let it cool on the ice, stirring as for a ‘Bavarois’- cream ; as soon as done, gradually introduce into it double its volume of whipped cream. Pour it into a channeled cylinder-mould of low form embedded on ice ; keep it on ice for an hour. When about to serve, dip the mould in warm water, wipe it, and turn the ‘blanc-manger’ out on a cold dish. 1251. Glazed sabayon, Piémont way. — Mix up well in a little pan three whole eggs, and ten yolks of eggs, with a quarter of a pound of powder-sugar; work the preparation for a few inimités with a wooden-spoon, then gradually dilute it with Lunel - wine (working to each yolk of egg half an eggshellful of wine) ; add half a stick of vanilla, the zest of half a lemon, a little bit of cinnamon. Whip the preparation on a moderate fire, until frothy and firm, then take it off the fire without leaving off whipping. When nearly cooled, add to it three or four ounces of clarified ‘gelatine’, as well as three or four tablespoonfuls of rum ; pour the preparation into a mould embedded with ice, and leave it for full an hour. Turn the ‘entremets’ out on a folded napkin. 1252. Glazed ‘soufflés’, with chocolate. — If such ‘soufflés’ are to be prepared, there must be at one’s disposal a round box in copper, tin, or zinc, the in- terior arranged, so as to receive one or two lattices in iron tin-wire, that is, very light: the box must be made to close hermetically. Previous to preparing the ‘souffles’, this box must be placed, on a thick layer of salted and salpetred ice, in a bucket; moreover it must be surrounded to height with salpetred ice. Get fifteen pretty little cases in plaited paper. Pour into a stewpan nearly a glassful of syrup, flavored with vanilla at 38° R. 118° F., which means, being not too thick ; add to it a half stick of vanilla. Put six or seven yolks of eggs into a sugar-pan, set the syrup on the fire, at the first bubbling remove-it back, pouring it on the yolks, which whip vigorously. Keep the skillet on the fire for two minutes, without ceasing to whip the preparation ; now take it off, and continue whipping, till it has cooled. This done, go on whipping on the ice for five or six minutes more, in order to introduce into it two gills of whipped cream, well drained, and mixed with two tablespoonfuls of sugar, flavored with vanilla ; the mixture completed, with the preparation fill the paper-cases ; let them be quite full, even rising above the rim of the paper. Range the ‘soufflés’ in the metal-box, which close, and cover with a thick layer of salted and salpetred ice. If the preparation goes on in summer, it will be convenient to change the ice half an hour after having drained the water off the bucket. Half an hour afterwards,SWEET ENTREMETS. — ICED FRUITS. 567 take the 'souffles’ out, sprinkle over some biscuit-powder, mixed with a little vanilla- sugar ; dish it on a folded napkin, and serve immediately. 1253. Glazed timbale, with fruits (D. 284). — Bake in a plain Tim- bale’- or 'charlotte’-mould of handsome shape, a tine biscuit-preparation (see Nr. 1182); Fig. 284. when turned out and cooled, cut it straight on the top, turn it over, and glaze the outside with orange icing-sugar; then cut it out on the top, empty it, and adorn its sides with preserved fruits, in the manner shown by the drawing. When about to serve, place the ‘timbale’ on a dish, surround its base with little strawberry - tartlets, then till the hollow with orange-'plombiere’, mixed up with a ‘salpicon’ of preserved fruits. Surround the ‘plombièrc’ with a circle of greengages, and serve the ‘timbale’ immediately. 1254. ‘Moscovite’, with champagne. — Take various preserved fruits, wash them in warm water, spunge them carefully, cut them in dice, and put them into a kitchen-basin ; then moistening with a quarter of a glassful of cognac, let them macerate for full an hour. Take about six or seven leaves of clarifled ‘gélatine’, pour them into a basin, mixing up first with a quarter of a glassful of syrup perfumed with orange, and then with half a bottle of champagne ; add to the liquid four tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice, and the same of pine-apple syrup. Pour now this preparation into a little ice-box embedded (frappée) with salted ice, but with only half the common dose. Turn the ice-box, and stir the preparation with a great spatula ; as soon as it begins to set, work it without leaving off, until frothy and elastic. Drain the ‘salpicon’ of fruits, in order to mix it up with the pre- paration, which then take up with a great spoon, and with it fill a large jelly-mould,568 COSMOPOLITAN COOKEKY. embedded a quarter of an hour since, with salted ice ; if no cover be at disposal to close the mould, cover it with a round of paper, and then with a stewpan filled with salted ice. A quarter of an hour after, take the mould out of the ice, wash it, quickly dip it into tepid water, then wipe it well, and turn the ‘moscovite’ out on a very cold dish; pour over a ‘purée’ of fruit, or sweetened raspberries, cooled on the. ice; serve it immediately. 1255. Fruits, moscovite way. — Prepare about two glassfuls of fresh apricot-‘purée’, which dilute with syrup; add a pinch of zest, the juice of an orange, as well as four dissolved leaves of ‘gélatine’, thus getting a preparation of light con- sistence ; pour it into a plain border-mould, which place in a copper-basin, and sur- round with pounded and salted ice ; leave it to set for half an hour. On the other hand, prepare a ‘macédoine’ of fruits, fresh or preserved : if preserved, they ought previously to be softened in tepid water. Put this ‘macédoine’ into a dome-like mould, pour over a little perfumed syrup, and thus keep it on ice. At serving-time, dip the border-mould into warm water, wipe it, and turn the ‘pain’ of apricots out on a dish. Drain the fruit, and with it till the hollow of the border, then mask it with a ‘purée’ of fresh fruits : pine-apple, strawberries, or rasp- berries, sugared, and well cooled on ice. This ‘entremets’ is one of the most distin- guished. 1256. Cold ‘sabayon’, with kirsh. — Pour into a stewpan eight yolks of eggs and two whole eggs, which bray with a whip ; add half a pound of powder- sugar, as well as half a glass of kirsh; whip the preparation on a very moderate fire, or at the ‘bain-marie’, until quite frothy ; then set the stewpan over a more brisk fire, whip the preparation again for two minutes only, then remove it back ; continue whipping, off the fire, until its greatest heat be gone; then whip again on ice, until quite cold, and quite firm ; this done, pour it into glasses previously cooled, and serve these immediately. 1257. Rice, Malta fashion (D. 285). — Wash a poiind of good rice in several waters ; plunge it into boiling water, mixed up with the juice of a few lemons ; when cooked well, drain it on a sieve, and without refreshing, put it into a kitchen- basin, moisten with the juice of four oranges, a glassful of maraschino, a little kirsch- wasser, and a little orange-syrup ; leave it thus till the rice be nearly cold, stirring it from time to time. Drain the rice on a colander ; then fill with it a border-mould with concave bottom ; fill likewise a small dome - shaped mould. Set these moulds on the ice, and leave them for two hours.569 SWEET ENTREMETS. — ICED FRUITS. First turn the border out on a dish, then turn out the dome into the hollow of the border : the riee ought to support itself perfectly well. Adorn the ‘entremets’ with some cut angelica, some candied orange-peel, or else with preserved cédrat; surround its base with raw quarters of orange pared à vif; garnish the tirst ‘gradin’ Fig. 285. I with some greengages, pour on the bottom of the dish a little maraschino mixed with orange- juice. 1258. Orange-ice (D. 286). — Ices are prepared either in small ice- machines * or in an ice-box (sorbetière). * Fig. 286. ’ Break in lumps a pound and a half of sugar, which put into a pan, moisten with four glasses and a half of water ; the sugar being dissolved, set the pan on the tire, * The ice-machine, the drawing of which I give here, is essentially a practical one, and commonly in use in private families for the preparation of ices. The method of embedding (sangler) this machine is exactly the same as for embedding an ice-box.570 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. bring the liquid to ebullition, skimming carefully ; then immediately take it off the lire, and let it cool. Add a half-zest of orange, cut off the rind in very marrow strips, as well as the juice of four or live oranges, and two lemons. This done, if the pre- paration were tried by the syrup-scale (pèse-sirop), it would give 21° or 22° (70—81); this being the standard degree* for fruit-ice. Any one, who is not competent to judge the degree of the sugar by touch, must certainly recur to the surer indications of the syrup-scale. The preparation being of the degree desired, pour it into the ice-box or ice- machine previously embedded (sanglée) ; which close, and stir vigorously for live or six minutes ; then (with the aid of an ice-spattle) shave off the sides and bottom of the ice-box, thus detaching the frozen parts; continue turning the ice-box, detaching the preparation off the sides and bottom, until it has got the consistence of cream. Then work the ice only with the spatula, but so that the ice-box turns at the same time ; to bring this about, it suffices to introduce the spatula vigorously and by shocks, between the sides and the bottom of the ice-box. If one wish to understand well the working of ice, one must be ever mindful of the truth, that the more the ice is worked, the more it will become smooth, elastic, and creamy : an ice, full of knots, is a failure. The ice being ready, let it rest for a few minutes in the ice-box, then distribute it in glasses, or dish simply in a rock-shape on a folded napkin, surrounding it with small dry cakes. Should ice be wanted to be served moulded, then spread any mould with paper, put it into a bucket, surround with pounded and salted ice, let it be well frozen (frappée), and then till it with the ice, pressing it close, thus tilling all the space. Shut the mould with its lid, lute its joints, sprinkle over salt, and keep it thus for halt an ho.ur. At serving-time, dip the mould in cold water, wash it well, remove its lid, then turn the ice out on a folded napkin. 1259. Palermo-ice. — This ice, of which I have eaten recently at Palermo, is one of the best, and most distinguished ones, of all I know. Swell about a pound of pistachios, as fresh as possible to be got, quit them in a mortar, with a handful of sugar, and pound. Dilute with two pints of nearly cold English-cream ; let it infuse for half an hour ; pass the preparation through a sieve, and let it freeze, proceeding as said No. 1258. The salted ice must be applied by layers into the hollow between the bucket and the basin (cuvette) of the machine. Moreover each layer of ice must be sprinkled over with salt. Notice, that all the layers of ice must be pressed close, beating them with a piece of wood. * By dissolving a pound of sugar with two glasses of water, and letting the liquid boil up, may be obtained a syrup giving 30° to 31° (R. 100 —102° F).571 SWEET ENTREMETS. FRUIT-ICES. Ten minutes previous to dressing the ice, gradually introduce into it live or six tablespoonfuls of genuine orange-blossoms (can de fleurs d’oranger), previously mixed up with a little cold syrup, and little of the preparation. Now dish the ice in a rock-shape on a folded napkin. 1200. Fruit-ice (D. 287). — Make a preparation of sweet and white fruit ice, such as with lemon or pine-apple, then make another preparation of red ice, such Fig. 2S7. as with strawberries, red-currants, or raspberries. With these two preparations till a few tin-moulds imitating pears, peaches, and apricots ; as well as a mould imitating a pine-apple. Shut close all these moulds, wrap them up with paper, arrange them, one by one, on a layer of pounded ice mixed up with saltpetred salt, also sprinkle salt over, and mask them with a thick layer of salted and saltpetred ice. Spread with paper a plain flat-bottomed pyramid-mould, and set it on a thick layer of salted and saltpetred ice ; surround it also with ice, and till it, in regular and alternate layers, with white and rose-colored preparation of ice. Close the aperture, lute the join with common paste, sprinkle over salt, and cover with a thick layer of salted ice. An hour afterwards, dip the pyramid-mould into cold water, wipe it well, and turn the ice out on the centre of a cold dish, covered with a folded napkin. Turn out also the little fruit-moulds, which dish all round the pyramid, setting the pine- apple on the top, and surrounding it with a few green leaves. ,1261. Pear-ice. — Get a few good pears quite ripe ; peel them, grate, and put them into a kitchen-basin ; add above half a pound of powder-sugar, as well as the juice of two oranges and one lemon, a little zest, two tablespoonfuls of vanilla- sugar. Half an hour after, pass the preparation through a very clean tammy, dilute it with a little cold water, and let it freeze in the ice-box. The ice being Arm and572 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. smooth, cover the ice-box ; ten minutes after, take the ice up with a large spoon, dish it, in a pyramid, on a folded napkin, and surround with little cakes. 1262. Red-currant-ice. — Pour into a kitchen-basin six gills of juice of red-currants ; add to it a pound of powder-sugar, a little orange-zest, and the juice of a few oranges and lemons, according to the acidity of the currants. The sugar being well dissolved, pass the preparation repeatedly, through a sieve : it should give 22° R. 81° F. of the syrup-scale ; then pour it into an ice-box, being previously embedded, and let it freeze, proceeding as already said. 1263. Nut-ice, with cream. — Cream-ices, generally, are composed with some cooked cream ; which has been denominated crème Anglaise. English-cream. — I will for the first, give the description of this cream. Put seven or eight yolks of eggs into a stewpan, add nearly three quarters of a pound of powder-sugar; work the preparation with a wooden-spoon, as for biscuit; when frothy, dilute it with four gills of boiling milk; add a stick of vanilla, cut up; stir the cream over the fire, till well thickened, but without allowing it to boil. Pour the cream into a kitchen-basin, add six tablespoonfuls of fresh nuts, pounded with a few sweet almonds ; let it cool, stir from time to time, pass through a sieve, let it freeze in the ice-box, proceeding as indicated (see No. 1258). 1264. Truffle-ice. — I had often heard the goodness and fine quality of truffle-ice contested. Therefore I had a mind to prepare some myself, being thus best enabled to judge the truth of that assertion ; and then I learnt that this pre- paration was well worth the attention of ‘gourmets’. Let me request all sceptics not to dispute this, without having tasted of such an ice. Peel four fresh black truffles, being very carefully cleansed, let their trimmings infuse in five gills of boiling milk ; ten minutes after, pass the infusion through a sieve, and with it, six yolks of eggs, and ten ounces of sugar, prepare an English- cream. When cooled, let it freeze in an ice-box, or an ice machine. Mince the truffles, and plunge them into a little boiling syrup; immediately take the stewpan off the fire, and let the truffles cool in the syrup ; then drain, pound, and pass them through a sieve; mix the syrup in this ‘purée’, which dilute with a little of the previously prepared ice, thus cooling it effectually ; pour it gra- dually into the ice-box, thus mixing it up with the ice, which must be got quite firm, by working it hard. When about to serve, dish it in a rock-shape on a folded napkin. 1265.

Pound half a pound of preserved ginger, pass it through a sieve, dilute first with a few table- spoonfuls of rum, then with a few tablespoonfuls of the previously prepared ice. Now pour it into the ice-box, work the ice for a few minutes more ; when quite firm, dish it in a rock-shape on a folded napkin, and serve immediately. 1266. Iced rice, with orange (D. 288 and 289). — Pour into a little ldtchen-basin three gills of cold syrup, perfumed with orange ; add to it live or six Fig. 288. Fig. 289. clarified leaves of ‘gélatine’, as well as the juice of two oranges ; stir the liquid on the ice, till it begins to thicken ; then introduce into it a pint of whipped cream ; the mixture operated, immediately pour the preparation into a dome-shaped mould, em- bedded with pounded and salted ice, in a basket. Close the mould with a piece of paper, then with its lid ; immediately lute its joints with butter or raw paste, cover it also with ice, and keep it thus for forty minutes. When ready for sei’ving, quickly wash the mould, then dip it into tepid water, and turn the rice out on a dish, covered with a folded napkin. The two drawings, added to this article, represent the mould (frappé) embedded with salted ice (D. 288). When the mould has been filled with the preparation, it must be covered also with a thick layer of pounded and salted ice. It is this second operation, which is represented by the drawing (D. 289). 1267. Baked-ice, (glaces au four). — This ‘entremets’ may be made use of, for the sake of variety, or as a surprise in a family-dinner. Prepare a composition of cream-ice, which may be quite firm (see No. 12G3). , On the other hand, prepare some Italian ‘meringue’ with four whites of eggs, and some syrup cooked at 34° R. 108" F. A few minutes previous to serving, dish the ice in a dome-shape on a very cold dish, which is solidly fixed on a fiat stewpan, being filled with pounded ice. Mask the cream-ice quickly with the574 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. ‘meringue’, adorn it with the comet, and immediately push the stewpan into a brisk oven, only to set the ‘meringue’, and allow it to take a light gold color. Immediately take the dish out, wipe it well, and send it up without delay. 1268. Pumpernickel-ice. — Grate half a pound of brown-bread of Westfalia (pumpernickel), let it dry, pass it through a colander, thus to get it very tine, soak it with a little syrup. Prepare a vanilla ice-cream ; when perfectly set, introduce into it two tablespoonfuls of whipped sweetened cream ; dilute the pumper- nickel with a little of the frozen preparation, into which immediately introduce it (in the ice-box). Work the ice for a few moments more, let it get firm, and dish. 1269. Rice, Béarn fashion. — Blanch half a pound of rice for six or seven minutes, drain, and put it back into the stewpan ; moisten it with warm milk, let it cool on a moderate fire ; when very tender and dry, add the requisite sugar, stirring with a fork ; cover the rice, and keep it thus until nearly cold, then mix up with it half a glass of maraschino. On the other hand, set a dome-shaped mould on a layer of pounded and salted ice ; cover the mould, and also surround it with ice. When well cooled, put the rice into the hollow, doing so in layers, and sprinkling over each layer, preserved fruits cut in large dice, washed in tepid water, and having macerated in maraschino for one hour. The mould being rilled, cover it, first with a round of paper reaching beyond the rims, then with its own lid; solder the junctures with either butter or paste, leave the preparation on ice for an hour. When about to serve, wash the mould quickly in tepid water, wipe, and turn the rice'out on a cold dish. 1270. Iced rice-milk, Spanish fashion. — Pick about a pound of good rice ; wash it, plunge it into boiling water to half-cook ; drain, and put it into a> stewpan ; finish cooking it with milk, but keeping it a little more liquid, than is usually done ; let it nearly cool, then add to it a pint of syrup, orange-flavored, at 30° R. 98° F. and a glassful of good raw cream, in order to diminish its con- sistence ; pour it into an ice-box embedded with salt, but only very slightly ; stir the rice from time to time, without turning the ice-box. As soon as it is well cooled, that is, after the lapse of twenty-five or thirty minutes, dish the rice. Surround it with quarters of orange, pared ‘a vif’. 1271. Neapolitan ‘mousse’ (D. 290). — Boil half a pound of sugar ‘au lissé’ (28° R. 95° F.) pour over five whipped whites of eggs, thus preparing an Italian ‘méringue’-paste. Its greatest heat being gone, gradually introduce into it six tablespoonfuls of good kirsh, and two glassfuls of whipped cream ; pour it into a domed*mould, previously set on pounded and salted ice ; cover the mould imrae-575 SWEET ENTREMETS. — ICED PUNCH. diately, lute its joints with common paste, sprinkle over salt, cover it with salted ice, leave it thus for fifty minutes. On the other hand, prepare a ‘salpicon’ of preserved fruits, being of various kinds, and cut-up in little dice ; let it macerate for an hour, with a few tablespoonfuls of kirsh, drain their liquid, and thicken them with a few tablespoonfuls of apricot- marmalade. Take the mould off the ice, which dip in cold water, and wipe ; then open, and hold it in a slanting manner, being enabled thus to remove the soft parts Fig. 290. ! of the preparation to be found in the middle. Then till the hollow with the previously prepared ‘salpicon’ of fruits, which mask with a layer of the preparation ; shut the mould again, as before ; leave it once more on salted ice for half an hour. At serving-time, dip the mould in hardly tepid water, and turn the ‘mousse’ out on a small biscuit-stand, glazed with pistachios, and fixed on the centre of a dish ; surround, at its base, with a circle of angelica, cut in leaves ; make a ‘rosace’ on the top of the mould ; place on the centre a ring of apple- or quince-paste, on the centre of which set a preserved greengage. Surround the base of the biscuit-stand with a garnish of flat cakes, glazed and decorated. 1272. Iced punch, Roman fashion, pine-apple, and cham- pagne. — Take a ripe large pine-apple, pare it, removing all the hard peel, but leaving a little of the pine-apple’s flesh adhering to it. Put the trimmings into a mortar, pound, and put them into a well cleaned kitchen-basin ; add to the above a little orange and lemon peel, pour over a gill of tepid syrup at (28° R. 95° F.) twenty-eight degrees. Half an hour after, pass the liquid, through a sieve, into another basin ; mix in the juice of two oranges and three lemons, then the water requisite, to bring the syrup down to twenty two (22° R. 81° F.) degrees, that is nearly two gills. Pour this preparation into an ice-box {sorbetière), embedded {sanglée) with salted ice ; stir it,COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 57G working it according to the same method as applied for ices. The composition being frozen, gradually introduce into it three whites of eggs of‘meringue’, Italian . fashion, that is prepared with sugar cooked au lissé. This done, introduce half a bottle of champagne into the punch, but by little and little, and without ceasing to work the preparation. L,ast of all, add to the above four tablespoonfuls of good kirschwasser. Serve this punch in rummers (verras à pied). Iced punch is commonly served to accompany the roasts. 1273. Chocolate-mousse. — Take three cakes of chocolate, and let add them soften at the mouth of the oven ; work the chocolate with a spoon till smooth a few tablespoonfuls of syrup flavored with vanilla; warm it well, introduce gradually a whipped and sugared white of egg, then pour it over three glassfuls of whipped cream, slightly flavored with sugar and vanilla. With this preparation fill a domed mould, previously set on pounded and salted ice, cover the mould also with ice, and thus keep it for an hour. When about to serve, dip the mould in tepid water, then dish the ‘mousse’ on a folded napkin. 1274. Strawberry-mousse. — Crush twenty jounces of good fresh straw- berries, not too small ; pass them through a fine sieve, or else through a tammy. Pour this ‘purée’ into a sugar-pan, and mix in a few spoonfuls of sugar flavored with vanilla; set the pan on pounded ice, in order to have the ‘purée’ cooled, stirring it continually. As soon as well set by the cold, introduce into it double its volume of sweetened and perfumed whipped-cream, kept very firm. Pour this preparation immediately into a dome-mould, placed in a little bucket (see D. 288) ; let the interior of this mould be garnished with paper ; cover the mould with a round of paper, close it with its lid, lute its joints with butter, it and then mask with a thick layer of salted ice. Three quarters of an hour after, drain the greater part of the water in the bucket, produced by the melting of the ice ; add some salted ice. Half an hour after, take the mould out, wash it in cold water, then turn the ‘mousse’ out on a dish, covered with a folded napkin. 1275. American sorbet (D. 291). — Let me recommend this ‘sorbet’ (or sherbet), as a variety well worthy of the attention of practitioners. In New-York it is prepared with ‘Catawba’-wine, coming from California; but it may also be prepared with Rhine-wine or Champagne. , Its most interesting peculiarity is, being served in glasses formed of raw ice. Of course, for the preparation of such ’glasses, tin-moulds must be handy, in imitation of (high - shaped) wine-glasses. These moulds are filled with pure water, white or colored ; then shut up quite close, and surrounded with saltpetred ice. Three quarters of an hour after, the water will be frozen up, and577 have taken the form of the mould, leaving a particle of liquid in the contre. Now pour off this liquid, and till the hollow left with a preparation of ice at sixteen de- grees (16° R. 080 F.), composed half of syrup of fruit, half of wine and the juice of oranges or lemons. The ‘sorbet being finished, it must not be too firm, but yet of sufficient consistence, with the aid of a spoon, to be dished in a pointed shape, inside the glasses of raw ice. 127G. Cardinal bowl, with strawberries (D. 292). — Grate the zest of an orange on a piece of loaf-sugar, weighing two or three ounces ; put it into a glass or china-vessel with ten ounces of cut sugar ; moisten with a little cold water, and the juice of five oi’anges passed through a sieve; the sugar melted, add to it a bottle of good moselle-wine, and a little rum ; plunge into the beverage a handful of fresh strawberries, then place this in a glass-vessel, and keep it on the ice for full an hour. When about to serve, place the vessel on a tray, surround it with glasses, and serve, in the conditions shown by the drawing. This beverage is highly esteemed both by the Germans and Russians. Fig. 291. Fig. 292.COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 578 1277. Macaroons -‘mousse’. — Have a domed-moulcl embedded with pounded and salted ice. Take a pint of whipped cream, well drained, and sweetened properly, which range in layers in the domed-mould previously embedded, alter- nating each of the layers with ‘macaroons’ saturated with kirsh. Shut the mould, solder its joins with common paste, sprinkle over the lid of the mould a large handful of salt, then mask it with a thick layer of salted ice. An hour and a quarter after, dip the mould quickly into tepid water, and turn the ‘mousse’ out on a folded napkin. 1278. Chestnut-‘mousse’. — Take half a pound of chestnut-‘purée’, which mix up well with a few tablespoonfuls of sugar, flavored with vanilla ; work with a spoon, to get the preparation smooth ; introduce into it three glassfuls of whipped cream sweetened. Pour the preparation into a domed-mould, previously embedded {frappé) with salted ice; cover the mould, solder its joins, and keep it thus for an hour. At serving-time, dip the mould in water, wipe it, and turn the ‘mousse’ out, on a folded napkin. 1279. Cream-‘plombière’ of Cairo. — Peel twelve or fifteen ripe bananas, pass their pulp through a sieve, put this ‘purée’ into a kitchen-basin, dilute it with three glassfuls of vanilla English-cream. Pass the preparation through a sieve once more; when cold, leave it frozen, according to the common method, in the ice-box ; when thickened, add two glassfuls of whipped cream sweetened. Finish the ‘plombière’, introducing into it a quarter of a glass of good madeira- wine; then dish it, in a rock-shape, on a folded napkin. 1280. Spanish rum-cream. — Dilute in a basin six tablespoonfuls of apricot-marmalade with two gills of rum. Put into a kitchen-basin fifteen or eighteen yolks of egg, which bruise with a whip, mix up with it nearly half a pound of tine sugar, and a tablespoonful of potato- flour. Dilute the preparation gradually with three quarters of a pint of cold water; which pass through a sieve into a stewpan, and thicken it without allowing to boil, like an English-cream; pour it immediately into a kitchen-basin, agitate it until nearly cooled ; add to the preparation eighteen leaves of clarified ‘gélatine’, as well as the diluted marmalade ; pass it through a sieve once more, try its consistence on the ice, let it cool entirely, pour it into a coated mould embedded with ice. When about to serve, dip the mould in warm water, turn the cream out on a cold dish. 1281. Caramel-syrup. — Put two handfuls of powder-sugar into a sugar- pan, which set on a moderate fire, stir the sugar with a wooden spoon till dissolved, and of a light brown; then moisten it with two glassfuls of water, addSWEET ENTREMETS. - KISSEL. 579 a stick of vanilla, as well as a pound, or a pound and a quarter, of pounded sugar; let the liquid boil, till converted into concentrated syrup (30° R. 100° F); immediately take it off the fire, to make use of it, either being cold or warm. This syrup is excellent for any sauce of 'entremets’, as well as for a beverage, when diluted with water. Having had frequent occasion to mention the skillet or sugar-pan (poêlon), I have thought it desirable to give several specimens, which will be found further on ; this kind of sugar is the proper one to use in boiling sugar, and all kinds of syrups : 'nougat’ also is prepared in such a skillet. 1282. Flummery (flamri), German fashion. — Pour into a stewpan three glassfuls of white wine, and the same of water ; add a little salt. Let the liquid boil up, introduce into it five ounces of semolina, not too fine, which let drop in like a rain-shower, thus getting a light paste, which let boil for six or seven minutes ; add the zest of half a lemon, and half a pound of sugar. This paste being thickened, and consistent, take it off the fire, and immediately introduce into it seven or eight whipped whites of egg; when smooth, pour it into a large jelly-mould, the inside of which is previously moistened with cold water ; let the preparation cool on ice for two hours; then turn it out on a dish, mask it with a 'purée’ of sweet fruits: strawberries, or raspberries. 1283. Kissel, German fashion. — Dilute in a sugar-pan four table- spoonfuls of potato-flour with a glassful of fresh currant-juice, passed through a sieve; stir the preparation on the lire, as soon as beginning to thicken, remove it back, in order to get it smooth by working it vigorously. Mix in five or six table- spoonfuls of powder-sugar, and then dilute it with two more glassfuls of currant- juice. Set the pan on the fire, bring the preparation to ebullition ; at the first bub- bling remove it back, in order to pour it into a round bowl or mould, previously dipped into cold water. Let the preparation get firm on the ice, then turn it out on a dish, on the bottom of which pour half a glassful of sweetened good raw-cream. 1284. Kissel, Russ fashion. — Crush two pounds of red-bilberries (canneberge), which dilute with three glassfuls of water ; pass the liquid through a cloth, then pour it into a red sugar-pan (poêlon), and make it hot. Pour into a kitchen-basin four tablespoonfuls of potato-flour, which dilute with a glass of cold water ; then mix it together with the hot juice. Set the sugar-pan on a moderate fire, stir the liquid with a spoon till the moment when the first bubbling appears. Take the pan off the fire, sweeten the preparation with powder-sugar; a few minutes after, pour it into a mould, previously dipped in cold water; set the 37*COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 580 mould on the ice, in order to have the preparation cold and firm. This done, turn the preparation out on a cold dish, and serve, accompanied by whipped cream. 1285. Fruits-bowl. — Pare off all the pithy part of the quarter of a fresh pine-apple ; divide its pulp in slices, which cut again into small dice, and put into a kitchen-basin ; add to it four or five good ripe peaches, divided in two, and then sliced. Take the same of apricots, likewise peeled and sliced; as well as a handful of stoned cherries, two handfuls of fine raspberries, and last of all, two handfuls of red- currants. Moisten all the fruits with a glassful of vanilla-syrup, mix in two large glasses of claret ; then set the basin on the ice. Pound the pine-apple trimmings, pass them through a fine sieve, with a quart of fresh strawberries ; dilute this ‘purée’ with a glassful of syrup, and a bottle of cham- pagne ; put it into a thin china basin ; which surround with pounded ice. Now stir the preparation, with a spoon, for twenty minutes ; mix in the juice of two oranges, and then the fruits, and liquid, from the other basin. Serve the bowl immediately, and accompany by a plate of finger-biscuits, cut in dice. 128G. Mai-trank. — This is a beverage frequently taken in spring-time in Germany ; it is prepared, beginning from the month of May, as soon as fresh leaves of aspérule odorante * are to be got. It is highly esteemed by the Germans of the North. Put into a china-bowl a quarter of a pound of pounded sugar; which moisten with a few tablespoonfuls of cold water, thus to dissolve it ; then add to it a bottle of white Moselle-wine ; add now a pinch of washed leaves of ‘aspérule’, which let infuse for twenty-five minutes ; then pass the liquid, through a sieve, into a punch- bowl, and let it cool on ice. 1287. Marquise. — Put a pound of sugar into a china-bowl, moisten with a little water, thus dissolving it ; then dilute it with a bottle of Rhine-wine, and two bottles of seltzer-water ; add to the liquid two or three lemons cut in slices, removing the pips. Let it cool, previous to serving this beverage. 1288. Knickebein. — This is a restorative much in vogue at Berlin. Put, on the bottom of a champagne-glass (flûte), a yolk of egg, being very fresh and whole ; pour on this yolk, very gently, half a liqueur-glass of good cognac, and on this a glass of ‘alkermès’, or good curaçao, being careful to keep the latter swim- ming on the top, without mixing itself up with the liqueur of the bottom. This beverage is swallowed at one draught. * This plant is also variously named: wood-ruff, wald-mtister, sweet-blue-bottle, muguet des bois, lily of the valley, maibliimehen, etc.BATTERIE DE CUISINE 581 KITCHEN-FURNITURE (BATTERIE DE CUISINE) D FROM 293 TO 308.

Fig. 294 it useful to present several drawings of such articles. It has been my chief aim to select fit specimens of every kind, in order that practitioners may be enabled to compare them together, and take full notice ot their difference of forms. Frying-pans (sautoirs), saucepans (casseroles), stew-pans (braisicres), boilers (marmites), fish-kettles (poissonnières), skillets (poêlons), and other pans or basins (bassines), comprise the chief articles, which make up a set of kitchen-furniture;COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 582 these are indispensable in every well organised kitchen, where the work is regular and continuous : in such case it is not only the variety of vessels that is needed : the number of such articles must also be in due proportion to the various require- ments of the work. In a kitchen ill, or insufficiently supplied with requisite utensils, the distressing hindrances resulting from such unwise stint will be continually felt : the working of a kitchen has occasions of imperious emergency, with which it will, at best, he difficult to struggle with success. Nos. 293, 294, 295, represent three ordinary saucepans, identical in form, but of different dimensions ; the variety of covers modifying in some sort the special character of each. The lid of the first saucepan, having a raised space within its outer edge, which fits on to the rim of the saucepan ; so that this lid, being reversed, may serve as a sauté-pan. The lid of the second saucepan, fitting likewise into the saucepan-rim, is hollow outside, so as to receive hot embers on its upper surface. The lid of the third saucepan is quite flat. No. 296 represents a saucepan broader than it is high, having a lid with handles, fitting on outside the saucepan-rim : this cover, if turned upside down, may serve the purpose of a baking-sheet, (plafond), or of a sauté-pan (sautoir). No. 297 is a ‘sautoir’ or flat saucepan, for glazing, having a hollow cover, on which may he placed hot embers. No. 298 is a sauté-pan with bottom slightly rounded, the shape being exceedingly convenient, highly practical. Nos. 299 and 300 represent two boilers of form identical, the handles only being different ; the former has two handles at the sides, the second has but one of semi- circular form : the cover of these boilers fits on the outside-rim. No. 301 represents a gravy-pan (caisse à jus) of broad and shallow form, of which the cover fits, on inside the rim. No. 302 represents a (poissonnière) fish-kettle of oblong form, rounded at the extremities, having a handle at each end. These vessels have a returning cover, and a grating or drainer (grille) in tinned copper, with upright handles. Nos. 303, 304, 305, represent skillets (poêlons) or saucepans for sugar, not tinned, either inside or out. These three specimens are of different form : the first has completely straight sides and a flat bottom, the second has the bottom rounded, the third has a hemispherical form, specially adapted for sugar. In vessels not lined, either with tin or enamel, no one should ever boil, or even put or keep any sauce, or broth, or milk. Nos. 306, 307, 308, represent three ‘braisicres’, or stew-pans, of different form and dimension ; the first is of an oval form, the cover of which fits on to the outside; this cover is hollow on the top, with raised rim all round, so as to retain on its centre either hot embers or burning charcoal.BATTERIE DE CUISINE. 583 No. 307, is a stew-pan of square form, tlie cover of which fits on likewise exterior, only it is flat instead of being hollow : these vessels arc chiefly used for stewing larger fowl, capons, turkeys, etc. Fig. 302.

These are all suitable for braising and glazing- fillets of beef, or saddles of veal.584 COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. It may be as well to observe, though it should be scarcely requisite, that all the copper-vessels composing the ‘batterie de cuisine’, must be at all tines kept in a state of the utmost purity of Cleanliness, as well outside, as inside ; on the outside, they ought, as soon as may be after use, to be again, thoroughly scoured clean, polished, mirror-bright; seeing they are, after all, in fact, the kitchens principal and indispen- sable adornment; on the inside, they ought to be well-tinned, and frequently fresh tinned ; for the use of an ill-tinned saucepan would in cur the risk of permanent injury to health. In many countries the ‘batterie de cuisine’ is tinned on the outside also, as well as inside.OPINIONS OF THE ENGLISH PRESS ON ‘THE ARTISTIC COOKERY.’ Before presenting to the notice of my Readers the various appreciative Criticisms published on my preceding Work, 1 hasten to address my thanks, and the expression of my deep gratitude, as well to the able writers who have penned these articles, as to the Jour- nals, which have given them publicity. In this favorable, yet disinterested Testimony, I recognise a proof of the warm sympathy afforded by the English Press to every honest effort any way contributive to modern progress. ARTISTIC DINNER-TABLES. Far be the audacity from us to review the mighty quarto,* big as a picture Bible, luxurious as a King’s edition of a classic, and illustrated like a Natural History, in which Messrs. Longmans have given the ideas of M. Dubois, Cook to their Majesties of Prussia, to an admiring and, we hope, a buying world. It is a book for German Princes, London Lord Mayors, and American millionaires; not for re- viewers , who, even if they understood cookery, which is very seldom the case, would certainly shrink from M. Dubois’ book as timidly, as they would from the kind of dinner, he urges our rich men to adopt. What could they venture to say to a man, who de- clares, that pain de gibier should be sent up in the form of a bastion modelled of fat and wood and glaze, and every other kind of uneatable abomina- tion; and thinks ‘a triton modelled in fat’ an ar- tistic improvement to a salmon, which human beings are presumably intended to eat? Mr. Hayward him- self, who has in print hinted defects in Brillât Sava- rin , would scarcely have the temerity to criticise M. Dubois and his designs for castellated cold grease, still less to say, what he might perhaps think, if we understand his essays aright, that the grand Prus- sian chefs ideas have something barbaric about them, something which recals the bad days ,when a Roman patrician thought it good taste, to send up fawns whole, or when naked dwarfs jumped out of Czar Peter’s pies, or when a French cook threatened to stew forty hams for a single dish. All we can venture to do is, to accept M. Dubois’ execution of his main idea, as absolutely perfect, which we may do with a safe conscience, having no standard of comparison; and to demur, and that we do timidly, overawed at once by his skill and his sententious- ness , to the main idea itself. M. Dubois’ postulate is, that the dinner-table offers a field for artistic effect independent of cookery, and that this effect should be secured, by throwing all dishes, (by aid of moulds, glazes, ‘flowers of fat,’ and other mechani- * Artistic Cookery. By Urbain Dubois, Chef (le Cuisine of their Majesties tile King and Queen of Prussia. London: Longmans. cal contrivances), into artistic forms, — that a ‘noix de veau,’ for example, should be sent up on a dish, selected to improve its pictorial effect, when prepa- red in this fashion : — ‘The meat is larded with ba- con, the piece secured in an oval shape, with a string, cooked with little liquid, and nicely glazed -r it is dished up on a foundation of cooked meat, cool- ed under press, and glazed at the entrance of the oven; this foundation is necessary, to heighten the form and aspect of the piece. It is surrounded with groups of vegetables, cooked in water, or gla- zed: cauliflowers, carrots, green pease, french-beans. Two hâtelet-skewers of vegetables are inserted in the meat on each side.’ We had rather eat veal in a ham-shop, or in a tenth-rate Florentine restaurant, where the cooking-stove is in the salon, and we are expected to gain an appetite from the hissing of the joints. With M. Dubois’ proposition, that an ar- tistic effect for a dinner-table is worth procuring, we heartily agree ; for, the righteousness jof luxury being granted, — quite a questionable point, — din- ner may as well be luxurious ; but to his mode of procuring it, we as heartily demur. It is, we con- tend, in the furniture of the table, not in the food to be eaten at it, that beauty of form should be sought; in the first place, because nothing hot can be put on table, without its yielding more or less of a steam disgusting to all who comprehend the true pleasure of dining; in the second, because every use- less touch given to food, encreases the effect, which in England is described by the word ‘mammocking’ ; and in the third, because a dinner made splendid by M. Dubois’ artistic shapes, must be a dinner served at a table inconveniently large. His idea of artistic arrangement is inconsistent with that happiest of discoveries, the Russian system of serving, which has relieved diners-out alike of carving, of steam, and of tepid dishes ; and with that highest art, which subordinates the gratification of the eye to the great- est of luxuries, good conversation, enjoyed while the palate is being pleased. M. Dubois admits the Russian dinner, but clearly gives the preference to the French one ; and we can scarcely imagine, that in practice he would bear to have his wonderful struc- tures of fat, and glaze, and willow-wood, cut up by586 OPINIONS OF THE ENGLISH PRESS unregarding servants out of sight. That very much might he done to improve the aspect of a dinner- table is certain, but we doubt if it is in M. Dubois’ direction tbat improvement should be sought. In the first place, we have not yet by anv means hit on a perfect form of dinner-table. The old square or oval affair, demanded by M. Dubois’ theory, is abominable from every point of view. It requires decoration on the pyramidal system, to prevent it from looking ‘flat,’ in a wav suggestive of a restau- rant, wants in silversmiths’ language the ‘épergne’ in the centre, with which M. Dubois, in his very artistic plate, has very judiciously adorned it. Now an épergne, or a lamp, or a tall vase of flowers, or anything above a foot high, put on a dinner-table, may encrease the pictorial effect as one enters, but is a decided nuisance after one has sat down, per- petually crossing the line of sight, and turning con- versation at any distance into a series of grotesque contortions. It helps the broad table to limit one’s power of talk to the next sitter, who may perhaps be talking to some one still farther down, and thus to make silent loneliness in the midst of a dinner, a possibility. That is surely, even in the estimation of a chef, to turn Faradise into Purgatory. With a round table the effect of a raised centre-piece is even worse ; for there it is constantly quenching a hope, as constantly reviving. With a square table one knows one’s fate, and submits to be bored or amu- sed at the discretion of one’s partner; but with a round table there is always hope, if only the service docs not interrupt the view, and compel every guest to look as if he were peeping round a corner. A large round table, with nothing tall on it, a ‘sunlight’ flashing down, a good dinner in course of serving, and a pleasant group around it, presents, we admit, all the materials of pleasure ; but even this might, we conceive, be improved on by art. The guests are too far off from each other, to feel that each is the other’s neighbour in the social, if not the Scriptural sense; too apt to realise the truth, that the modern world, with all its attention to dinner, and all its marvelous mechanical skill, has not yet discovered the secret of a dining-table; that there is, in fact, no such thing, but only a table on which a dinner may be put. Gillow himself does not make tables for dining and nothing else. A series of little tables would be good ; but that arrangement leaves the groups too isolated, too dependent on the host’s skill in parceling his guests—a matter in which etiquette constantly inter- feres with judgment—and it absolutely precludes anything like broad pictorial effect. There is no opportunity, either for grouping, or for color; while it is difficult, if not impossible, to remove an im- pression of the restaurant. The true idea, we con- ceive, is one, which would be inconvenient in all but the very greatest English houses, a table of any length , but so narrow, tbat every guest would look into the eyes of his opposite neighbour, and be able to talk at ease to at least five persons, three opposite and one on each side. To give such a table, which is by nature ugly, a fine pictorial effect, it ought to present to the in-comer a sort of ribbon, a long strip of well-arranged and exceedingly bright co- lors ; but that effect is surely not beyond the reach of the human intellect. Range flowers—not flower- pots, but cut flowers embedded in moss—in open order, down the centre, as carefully as they would be arranged in a bed in a grandly designed garden ; and heap on each side glass, silver, and fine china; and there would be produced an effect, which no eye sensitive to color could behold, without that sense of content, which is the highest of the calmer gratifi- cations. There is no good reason , if expense is once forgotten, why the ground-color of the picture should be white, though white is very effective ; and still less, why the china should be of the subdued tint modern taste affects, why the glass should all be like water solidified into shapes, and why the napkins should be made of starched white linen. There is no earthly reason, except expense, why the carafes should not be of the proper substance lo hold water, porous clay susceptible of any color and any pattern ; the finger glasses, of red Bohemian glass, or far better, of that wonderful amber which glows so in false light; the wine-glasses, of three colors, so arranged as to form with the finger- glasses a bouquet; and the napkins, of the intense scarlet or purple, which best throws up all other shades ; or why half the silver should not be frosted. To a dinner-table so arranged, the only objection would be a certain absence of special purpose, of separateness from other tables ; and that could be obviated, if between every chair stretched out from the table a kind of arm intended to hold the condi- ments, which no one cares to do without, which no one wishes to wait for, and which no servant ever brings without a special order. The arm, too, be- sides breaking the hard lines of the table, would prevent crowdiug, and admit of an improvement at dinner, cruelly required, a really luxurious chair to sit in. We English have, we believe, invented a drawing-room and library chair, on which improve- ment is not possible, a chair for which Nero would have given a prize ; but our dining - room chair, though better than our fathers’, is still deficient, wearies the neck, obliges us to submit to the weari- ness of carrying our own arms. Seated in the chairs of our dream, with pleasant guests opposite, and therefore visible, and yet near enough to talk to, with brilliant color on every side, and with no scent save that of the flowers, dinner should arrive imperceptibly, each dish in the simplest form, in which it can be enjoyed, and most easily transferred to its proper place, the plates before the guests. Perish M. Dubois, his marvelous shapes, and in- comparable, but superfluous hâtelets ! They are but worries and distractions at the best, gross inter- ferences with the idea of a good dinner, worthy only of millionaires, who do not want to entertain you, but only to make you feel, how vast must be the fortune, to which waste like theirs is imper- ceptible. They haVe their function, as well as royal- ties; but neither of them, if guided by M. Dubois, will in any wise advance the true art of banqueting, that gratification of the feeding animal, which is so scientific, so connected with intellectual excitement, that wise men cease to reckon it among the truly sensual enjoyments. The Spectator, Feb. 5, 1870.ON ‘ THE ARTISTIC COOKERY.’ 587 ARTISTIC COOKERY : a Practical System suited for the Use of the Nobility and Gentry and for Public Entertainments. With Plates. Ry Urbain Dubois. (Longmans & Co.) In a grandly written and superabundantly illustrated quarto volume, the massiveness and weight of which contrast strongly with the light- ness of the author’s soufflés and pastry, the chef cle cuisine of the King and Queen of Prussia gives the results of his professional experiences to epicures and cooks, who value the pleasures of the j table at their proper worth. M. Dubois ministers to the critical palates of princes and nobles, provides dinners for fastidious millionaires, and suppers for five thousand guests, who have waltzed them- selves at court-balls into the disposition for eating, which does duty for hunger. That M. Dubois takes a high and flattering view of his art and its patrons, may be inferred from the sentiments which he pla- ces as a motto on his title-page : — ‘En ce siècle de vigueur et d’activité fécondes, il est évident que j le bien-être et le comfort entrent pour une grande part dans les aspirations de l’humanité ; car plus les peuples gagnent en intelligence , plus ils devien- nent gourmets.’ Cookery, according to our author, I is the finest of the Fine Arts, — akin to poetry, sculpture, painting, music, but superior to them all ; and to acquire its rudiments the aspirant must have nice insight and indomitable perseverance, while to achieve excellence in the practical illustration of its principles, the professor must have conscien- tiousness, imagination, and creative genius. lie must also be endowed with the soldier’s combativeness, and the fertility of resource, which distinguishes the great general from officers capable of nothing but drill. M. Dubois adds— ‘To be a good cook, to succeed when everything is at hand, and when provisions are plentiful and appropriate, is certainly much; for even with all these and the like appliances, the most strenuous endeavours are not always crowned with success. Rut to distinguish one’s self when resources are utterly inadequate to the requirements, when many essentials are wanting, when provisions are scanty or deficient in quality, and assistance unattainable; then, indeed, the task is a difficult one, but, if at last accomplished, it is the more meritorious, and will certainly gain the applause of such, as can ap- preciate the difficulties above enumerated. If we I only think of the trouble, the anxiety, which assail the practitioner on such occasions, it will be easy to understand, how useful and imperative it is, to prepare for every emergency by adaptation and perseverance, but especially by the constant and unremitting study of everything connected with the culinary art.’ Such enthusiasm must have animated the chef who, during the retreat from Moscow, provided the vanquished Emperor with entrées of exquisite deli- cacy and flavor, made out of drummers’ aprons and the leather straps of military accoutrements. It gratifies our national pride to learn that, besides being exceptionally rich in the materials for gastronomic pleasure, England ranks high amongst civilised nations for her devotion to and enligh- tened encouragement of the art of eating. In every quarter of the globe polite and critical feeders are becoming more numerous. ‘Formerly, the science of good living, the research after delicate viands, were the privileges of the few ; now-a-days epicures may be counted by legions.’ Rut ‘it is a fact wor- thy of notice, that in England, culinary art is more cultivated than in any other country.’ This state of things is chiefly attributable to the presence amongst us of an unusually large proportion of ‘the most enlightened minds,’ who arc always ‘the most fervent worshipers at the shrine of good taste’; but to a certain extent it is referable to our beef and mutton. Good veal may be found in Holstein and Hanover, Moscow and Milan; but ‘the nations most favored, as regards the qualities of veal, are England, France, and Holland ’ ‘Sheep are diffu- sed all over the world ;’ but there are sheep and sheep, and he who would ascertain all the possi- bilities of mutton, must pursue his investigations in England. As for the beef, M. Dubois observes,1 it must be acknowledged, that it is only in England it meets with the care and attention it requires, and where the foresight and sacrifices necessary to ensure its perfection are properly understood.’ The ex- cellence of her fish is also another reason , why England has given her mind to food with such brilliant results. No number of specimens, gathered from M. Dubois’ text, would do justice to the fervor and magnificence of the language, in which he enlarges on the trials and triumphs of his sublime vocation. Like the art, by which he rendered himself illus- trious , to be understood he must be studied pa- tiently, minutely, and sympathetically ; but the busy reader, who cannot spare days for the examination of the artist’s pages, and yet wishes to study the most characteristic chapters, is referred to the essays on ‘Cold Pieces’ and ‘Pastry.’ It is in the former treatise that the professor remarks—‘Ornamenta- tion is connected with cold pieces by the most intimate ties, imparting to them that coquettish elegance, which impresses with admiration even those minds, generally most indifferent to the beau- ties and merits of the profession.... Here the artist has full scope to show his talent, being neither bound nor constrained by the strictness of culinary rules; and it is obvious that, in this condition of entire freedom, his active and ingenious mind can freely produce the conceptions of his fancy. His elevated taste, his inspiration, his imagination, is at liberty to take wing.’ It is, however, in his introductory remarks on pastry and the allied products that M. Dubois exhi- bits most forcibly his admiration for artists who are content to further the great cause of gastronomy :— ‘He (says the teacher with impressive solem- nity) who is a stranger to the secret resources of this art, has little conception of the wonderful results, that a skilful practitioner can produce from a sugar- loaf ! . . .. The pastry-cook must possess an enligh- tened and infallible intelligence, an incessant atten- tion ; his taste must be refined and delicate, practice must be his instructor; for taste and practice are essentially indispensable qualities to the artist. Rut he must have that judicious taste, that intelligent practice, which enlightens and guides with safety, not merely that blind and mechanical knowledge, which consists in reproducing what one has already done, or in copying what one has seen done, without reflection and without genius.’588 OPINIONS OF THE ENGLISH PRESS Whilst M. Dubois resembles all the other chefs of our acquaintance, in thinking somewhat too highly, and speaking somewhat too grandly, of the concerns of his art, he differs from them in modesty. ‘Though he has studied cookery with ardor and perseverance, and has spent years in searching into its minutest details, he is far from believing that he has penetrated into all its secrets.’ He apologises for what may be called his presumption, in ventu- ring to teach the culinary art to Englishmen. Far from thinking that culinary artists should tyrannise over their employers’ tastes, he is of opinion that a cook’s main object should be to please his master, however deficient the latter may he in gastronomic perception and knowledge. So great is his diffi- dence that he has never gathered courage to put before their Majesties of Prussia the realisation of a design for a ‘Trophy of War, in Fat’, which at times he is disposed to regal'd as his sublimest con- ception. Should this proposal for a thing of beauty ever result in adequate achievement, beholders will see in her native fat a decidedly warlike lady, wearing the dress of no period in particular, and standing astride over a confused mass of cannon, cart-wheels, and military ammunition ; whilst she holds in her left hand a banner, and with her right puts the trumpet of victory to her lips. The Athenaeum, Feb. 12, ’70. ARTISTIC COOKERY. By Urbain Dubois, Chef dc Cuisine of their Majesties the King and Queen of Prussia. Longmans. The Royal and learned chef has done good ser- vice to the public in general, and to the ladies in particular, by the publication of this book. No pains or expense appears to have been spared, to make it of the most appetising quality, and undoubtedly with signal success. Printed in the best style of the art, on paper worthy of the occasion, and illus- trated throughout with artistically and expensively got-up drawings, it is as well suited to the table of the drawing-room, as are its contents to the lower regions of the kit^sfn. A portion of the work is well devoted to the publication of a series of tooth- watering menus ; and as a pleasant consequence, we may naturally look forward to the early day ; when the interesting information, intended to be conveyed by those delicate specimens of current literature, may be couched in terms somewhat more in accor- dance with the rules of the French Lindley Murrays, than has hitherto been the rule. It is an undoubted, though perhaps a melancholy and humiliating fact, that, owing either to the carelessness of the hostess, the ignorance of the cook, or the irrepressible de- vilry of the printing-house, the menus generally exhibited at our social boards, do not indicate that familiar intimacy with Gallic gastronomic nomen- clature, so earnestly, though fruitlessly, sought by the British matron. We sincerely hope, that this volume may be extensively read, and carefully acted on; and in this aspiration we are not altogether unselfish. We hold that a wcll-cooked dinner forms a by no means inconsiderable item in the happiness of civilised man ; and if we can induce ladies to persuade their cooks to take a few leaves out of M. Dubois’ book, we maintain we have well earned the everlasting gratitude of every husband in the kingdom. The Examiner and London Review, Feb. 19, 1870 ARTISTIC COOKERY: a Practical System, suited for the use of the Nobility and Gentry and for Public Entertainments. With eighty engraved plates. By Urbain Dubois, Chef de Cuisine to their Majesties the King and Queen of Prussia London: Longman, Green, and Co. 1870. Some few months since, when we noticed in our columns C. Gouffé’s Livre de Cuisine in the English dress, in which it appeared as The Royal Cookery- Book ; we thought that the art of writing works on cookery had culminated, and that any further move- ment must be a decline. The appearance, however, of the Artistic Cookery of M. Dubois compels us to recant our error. We have here a massive quarto volume, devoted almost exclusively to the higher aesthetics of the culinary art. No labor appears to have been spared in its production, nor any expense in its illustration. Upwards of eighty large engrav- ings present us with designs for artistic dishes and pieces of all kinds, amounting to many hundreds in number. M. Dubois is not merely an exponent of high art in cookery, but a prophet of the very highest. Like all writers who are in earnest, he is an enthusiast. He does not approach his important subject lightly ; he maintains that his hook requires serious and profound study, for its object is to elevate the cha- racter of the art of which it treats. ‘Not only docs it aim at completing the theory of cookery, by calling the attention of practitioners to the artistic part of the profession, but it also endeavours to inspire those, who are in the habit of giving grand dinners, with a sense of the splendor belonging to the luxury of the table—that captivating luxury, which in every country so nobly expresses the magnificence of a great house.’ The designs so freely given ‘are not merely imaginary sketches evolved from the fertile imagination of an artist, but actual transcripts from pieces executed in the kitchens of the King and Queen of Prussia’. M. Dubois commences his wrork with a chapter on the service of the table, in which he describes and contrasts the relative advantages and disadvantages of the Services à la Russe and a la Française. After describing the care required to secure the hot entrées being served sufficiently hot to be enjoyed in a state of perfection, our author truly remarks : ‘But if cooks and butlers are bound to take so much care, hosts and guests, in their turn, must observe the strictest punctuality ; for the best of dinners, combined with the greatest science, and prepared with the utmost talent and most vigilant attention and care, will not answer expectations, if it is kept waiting. In some instances, the inconvenience here referred to may be removed, by placing on the table luxurious and coquettish pieces, intended only for show, and which, on their turn coming to be carved, may he replaced by others, dished up at the moment of being handed round, and preserving all their good qualities and enticing appearance. But this method, although excellent in principle, offers great complication, and would be far too expensiveON ‘ THE ARTISTIC COOKERY.’ 589 to allow of its general adoption. Nevertheless it is deserving the attention of‘gourmands.’ There is certainly a more practical, and perhaps less troublesome way, which seems to diminish the danger, at the same time that it keeps up appearances ; namely, to place the dishes on the table, carved accord- ing to the method of the service à la Russe, hut pla- cing them on hot-water dishes in the symmetrical order of the service à la Française. This method, which may be called mixed, would in some measure reconcile the exigencies of cookery with the symmetry and rigorous luxury of the table. The carving, care- fully done in the kitchen, would not materially in- jure thephysiognomy of the dishes, and much precious time would in this mannner be saved, for they would be handed round ‘as soon as taken off the table’. We are then presented with hills of fare for every possible occasion, from a bal d’en/ans to a dinner served at the coronation of a king. The menus of the dinners, actually served at the tables of the various reigning sovereigns of Europe, are interesting. The following is from Windsor: Famille Royale d’Angleterre. Potages. A la tortue—Consommé aux quenelles. Poissons. Turbot bouilli, éperlans frits. Soles à la matelote Normande. Relevés. Filet de boeuf aux nouilles. Poulardes à la Royale. Entrées. Rissoles de volaille à la d’Artois. Mauviettes farcies au gratin. Côtelettes de mouton à la Soubise. Fpigrammes de volaille aux haricots verts. Fricandeau à la chicorée. Boudins de brochet, sauce homard. Rôts. Faisans, ptarmigans, ortolans. Relevés. Beignets de griesz. pudding Nesselrode. Salsifis frits. Croquembouchc. Crème de riz au Entremets. Galantine de poulets. Petits babas chauds. Bavarois au chocolat. jus Side Table. Roast beef, roast mutton. {Diner servi au palais de Windsor par M. Auberlin, avec le concours de MM. Thion, Gouffê, &c. duc.) The engraved plates follow in order, giving designs for hot Hors d’Œuvre, Hâtelets, Fish Re- moves (12 plates), Removes of Meat, Removes of Poultry, Hot Entrées, Cold Pieces (30 plates), Entremets (hot and cold), Pastry pieces, Dessert, &e. Many of the pieces are of the most elaborate character, requiring the skill of the modeller, as well as the knowledge of the cook, for their construction ; and the entire work is calculated for the service of those, who are sufficiently affluent to command the highest and must luxurious style of artistic cookery ; and to such we may say the work is indispensable. M. Dubois promises two other treatises on differ- ent branches of his art —one of which, Cosmopolitan Cookery, may, we hope, come within the scope of those who are not millionaires ; for his directions are so practical and sensible, that we rather regret his services should he solely at the disposal of the upper ten thousand. The Queen, and Lady’s Newspaptr, Mar. 5, 1870. ‘THE PROGRESS OF GASTRONOMY. A country place for the unmolested pursuit of gastronomic science! The stew-pan singing under learned eyes : and March violets battling for the mastery with truffles ! A beginning is being made, at length, and at the right end. Not many months ago some horseflesh banquets were given, which did infinite harm to the cause of hippophagy in England, because they tried to prove too much. Horse beef is not better than ox- beef: nay, it is not nearly so good. The horse steak is lean ; horseflesh generally lacks fat, and therefore the rich juices of the ox. To ally truffles with the poorer and drier beef of the two : to fry with horse fat or marrow, that which should fall only into the sweetest oil, is to commit a gastronomic blunder, and to put horseflesh to a ridiculous test. If ‘with wine, not oil, we feed the lamp of life:’ it is with oil—and the finest and sweetest—we inspire the enthusiasm of the gourmet. That which the hippophagists had to prove was, that horse beef was very much better than no beef at all : not that it was the best beef. In hold- ing epicurean banquets, with a pony for the pièce de resistance, a kiud of criticism was challenged, which should have been shunned. Francatelli, busy over a pony, while there is fine ox-beef to he had, is in a false position ; and it is with sound reason, that a Gouffé and a Dubois would disdain to spend their science on the ‘noble animal,’ while the butcher was able to furnish them with prime cuts from the ox. But the value of gastronomy—the most elaborate and the daintiest—is beyond question, in a state of society, where the economy of food is of vital impor- tance, and where the habits of men have lessened the robustness of appetites. He who steadily pursues the lessons of the kitchen ; who invents new flavors ; who introduces, as a food, that which we had been accustomed to tread under foot as a weed ; is a good social servant. That such servants are cropping up in England is a fact of good augury ; and that such books as the handsome volume before me, by M. Dubois,* find a welcome in England, is evidence of a new gastronomic appreciation, which the thoughtful and cultivated should delight in noticing. The experi- mental spirit has been awakened, and gastronomic courage has been shown among the leaders of a better, more various, and a more economic kitchen, than the little, coarse, and dear one, to which Igno- rance has hitherto limited the majority of my coun- trymen. I have a letter under my eyes from one of the most enthusiastic and daring of our English gastro- nomic savants and reformers. ‘I have taken a country- place lately,’ he says, ‘very much with the view of being able to experiment in cooking comfortably.’ * Artistic Cookery. A Practical System, for the use of the nobility and gentry, and for public entertainments. By Urbain Dubois. Longmans.OPINIONS OF THE ENGLISH PRESS 590 Imagine an experimental cuisine, with the roses nod- ding in at the windows, and the clematis tickling the nose of the inspired chef! ‘ The last novelties,’ my friend pursues, ‘I have tried, are stewed hedgehogs, and arbutus-tarts. Fatted hedgehogs remind me a good deal of quail : arbutus tarts are capital, but 1 need scarcely say, that nobody lure will dine with me!’ The wonder is , my friend’s neighbours don’t denounce him in the county papers, for an ogre, a brute, and a base glutton. ‘Hedge- hogs,’ he says, — and at this let the reader prepare his prejudiced stomach for a trial— ‘hedgehogs fatten best, I hear, on adders and snakes (of which I have plenty). Themselves, everybody knows, are excellent.’ Baked in clay, the gipsy has long had a kindly tooth for Monsieur Hérisson. My friend appeals to me— ‘What do you think of my introducing Hérissons aux vipères, as a new dish for the 1870 season?’ My country gourmet, whose fat smoke rises amid noble timber, and in a rich valley, is not content with hedgehogs, snake or viper fed. T am fattening a four-year-old donkey for Easter, instead of a Paschal lamb. The last donkey was too young, and had suffered from the colic.’ Nay, but these details are a trifle trying to the most philosophic investigator with his teeth. Turn we to pleasanter prospecting:— ‘A subject that wants light is edible fungi. As far as I know, it is quite the exception, to find a poisonous fungus. I breakfasted on more than a dozen sorts last autumn, and I found them all more or less wholesome.’ The very latest thing from my friend’s experi- mental kitchen, is a pretty recommendation:— ‘You should also try guinea-pig with sunflower- purée.' I must;—and, I think, a few days at least before the Hérissons aux vipères, which I commend to M. Urbain Dubois. But let me turn, from gastronomic prospecting, to the contributions to the progress of scientific cookery which the King of Prussia’s renowned chef has offered to the culinary professors, and the gourmets of England. It is in every respect a masterly and a splendid performance—worthy to stand up on the shelf with Jules Gouffé’s Book of the Kitchen, and M. Dubois’ own Cuisine de Tous les Pays, and his Cuisine Classique. M. Dubois is an essentially liberal- minded chef. He is at home in all kitchens, and can pick something good out of each. In his cosmo- politan work he was bold enough to teach his conti- nental compeers, that England included many noble dishes, and fine table manners, with which they would be wise to make themselves acquainted. He proclaim- ed the delicacy, I remember, of the English rhubarb- tart:— he, who had written and executed the coro- nation menu of the King and Queen of Prussia at Konigsberg, in 1861 In his new volume (the splen- did series of menus of which are worth the price of the entire work, ranging as they do from royal feasts to children’s suppers, and dejeuners dinatoires), he pays a deserved tribute to the care, discretion, and success, with which gastronomy has been cultivated in England, among the wealthy. ‘As respects England,’ he observes, ‘those who have studied its developments, cannot fail to have observed, that the art of eating, in the highest sense of the word, has undergone notoriously progressive transformations. All classes of society furnish their contingents of expert and well-trained epicures; but it is in the higher circles more especially, that the taste for gastronomy is the most widely diffused, and the most highly cultivated.’ This is true of the most refined ; but not of the lower and less educated classes. The deplorable aspect of the English cuisine is in its middle-class and working-class sections. The middle-class kitchen, and the workman’s kitchen, are, throughout England, wasteful, bad, and ridicu- lously limited. There is not an English working- man’s wife who can make a vegetable soup : there is hardly a middle-class kitchen in the kingdom, that can turn out a passable omelet. But when M. Dubois touches on the culinary standard of the kitchens of the rich, he only does them justice. ‘ English cookery, considered in its practical re- sults, and in its rich splendor, stands much higher than its former reputation; and it has in every respect improved, and advanced towards perfection. The tables of the nobility and gentry are served with uncommon opulence, but above all with the nicest care and attention. The viands are varied, abundant, luxurious, and delicate. The kitchens are admirably organised, and richly stored : they are, in fact, per- manent and thriving schools, whence good traditions are continually spreading. If the tables of the middle- classes be still deficient as regards variety, yet it may be said, that the care bestowed on the details, and the manifest character of real comfort presiding at their repasts, make amends for this defect; and besides, here, as everywhere else, improvement becomes every day more visible.’ M. Dubois should make tables of the comparative cost of the kitchens of various nations, which he has examined, and in which he has practised. I am quite sure, that he would find, the limited range of foods in our humbler kitchens, made them the dearest in the world. And, a dear kitchen, I shall always maintain, is a bad kitchen. My friend in the country, who has experimented upon hedgehogs, donkeys, and guinea- pigs, and turned his sunflowers into purée, is, I con- tend, doing good service, even in his most extrava- gant mood; because he is helping to break through the prejudices of ignorance, which limits theEnglish- man’srangeof vegetables, and salads, toahoutadozen plants and roots; and confines his ideas of meat to half a dozen joints. I remember, that when, in con- junction with the late Lord Brougham and others, I was concerned in an attempt to provide the poorest classes with cheap and nutritious dinners, a whole- some , savory ragout of excellent meat was offered to them for a few halfpence—a goodly dish. They would none of it. It was a slop : a suspicious hodge- podge. They must have a slice of meat from a joint —these poor, ignorant starvelings—which could not possibly be ceded to them at less than double the price of the ragout—the nutritive value of the ragout being more than equivalent to that of the slice of mea^. M. Dubois’ remarks on gastronomy in the United States show the wide range of his observation. ‘For- merly,’ he says, ‘the science of good living, the search after delicate viands, were the privileges of the few; now-a-days epicures may be counted by legions. In all countries, among developed nations, and those that seek after the benefits of modern ci-ON ‘THE ARTISTIC COOKERY.' 591 vilisation, the most enlightened minds are the most fervent worshipers at the shrine of good taste. In confirmation of this, the United States furnish the most striking examples that can be adduced; and if we consider the progress effected in so short a time in culinary and gastronomic art in that country, it may be predicted, that at no distant period, it will be numbered among the highest in repute.’ Take the American cuisine, as developed in Ame- rican hotels. Where the Englishman has one food, — one dish, his American cousin has a good dozen. And New York boasts, at least, one establishment, that does not fear, in its cuisine, competition with any chef or chefs in the world. The first merit of the scientific, artistic, and prac- tical work, which M. Urbain Dubois now offers to the epicurean public of England, is its thorough genuineness. It has been said, that a perfect cookery- book must have been compiled on the corner of a stove : M. Dubois appears to have been guided by this dictum. ‘In examining the ornamental subjects contained in this collection,’ he warns the reader, ‘ many per- sons may be inclined to suppose, that they are simply sketches proceeding from the pencil of an artist of a capricious imagination ; and it is to provide against this erroneous interpretation, that 1 think it neces- sary to inform my readers, that the greater number of these pieces wereexecutcd in the kitchens of Their Majesties the King and Queen ofPrussia. This being the case, the designs may be considered as actual documents, and not as problems yet waiting to be solved; since they have either been engraved from the subjects themselves, or have served as models for their execution.’ Timbales, croustades, côtelettes, paupiettes, grenadins, hâtelets in extraordinary variety, : are all engraved with exquisite delicacy. Oreilles de veau à la Périgord are a perfect picture ! The pre- liminary article on the service of the table—on the service à la Française, and the service à la Russe (the service à l’Anglaise, being merely a modification of the Française), is full, and draw n from the customs and rules of the greatest tables. The whole work, in short, consists of teachings from experiences accumulated patiently, intelligently, and with a high sense of the dignity of the culinary art, in the pa- laces of kings. I add M. Dubois’ explanation of his plan, of which this copious and brilliant volume is only the first part. ‘But in order to dispel all misapprehensions, as to the real scope of this collection, the style of which might appear too elevated, it is well to observe, that it is but the first step, towardsacomplete work, that 1 intend publishing in England. Culinary art, both in theory and application, is a vast field : its limits arc unbounded, its details infinite: to treat it thoroughly in a single work, it would be necessary to compare its various methods, which wc know are modified, in practice, according to the situation in which wc arc placed. It is to obviate this confusion, that I have divided my work into three principal parts, of which each is to form a particular study. This first essay will, therefore, be succeeded by two other publications, in which the various theories of the modern school will be found recapitulated : these books w'ill be complete in one another, caeh of them maintaining its distinctive character.’ I shall hope to see, before M. Urbain Dubois has put aside his pen, such a comparative view of the tables of the various civilised nations as I have in- dicated; together with a manual, bearing the autho- rity of his European name, for humble kitchens of taste. For taste in eating is profitable, both to the stomach and to the purse; and may be advantageously cultivated by the humblest citizen, as well as by princes, who can command the Dubois, and the Gouffés.

By Urbain Dubois, Chef de Cuisine to their Majesties the King and Queen of Prussia, etc. Longmans, Green, and Co.— We have received the ‘Practical System of Artistic Cookery’, which in style and matter is worthy of its title. It is splendidly illustrated ; and the care and detail, into which every branch is carried, bear wit- ness to the writer’s conviction ; that cookery is both a science and an art, and that his book has within it ‘elements that necessitate serious and profound study.’ This large volume, with its eighty pages of elaborate illustrations, is but the first part of a com- plete work ; and if, in thus bringing good taste and refinement in cookery to perfection among the higher classes, the author succeeds in raising the standard of wholesome and inviting food among the English generally, his work will have a wider use- fulness than might at first seem likely. One of his axioms for all cooks is, that in some departments ‘weight, quantity, and number, are absolute laws.’ Yet he says also, ‘a man must possess an enlightened and infallible intelligence, an incessant attention, and his taste must be refined and delicate ; practice must be his instructor; he must know the reason of difficulties, as well as how to meet them ; and, in a word, he must possess the intelligence that creates unlimited resources.’ M. Dubois’s English is very good on the whole, though not lacking in the piquant mistakes which Frenchmen so often make. He informs us that ‘shad exists in the Atlantic*, in the Ocean, and in the Mediterranean.’ British Medical Journal, Mar. 12, 1870. ARTISTIC COOKERY. This book is an evidence of the encreasing taste of the age in which we live. The way in which people dine, is a sure index of the progress they have made in civilisation. Our ancestors, who had steaks and ale at six in themorning for breakfast, and made their principal meal at noon , simply devoured then- food. They never dined, or understood the art of dining. The poor French king, who died shortly after his marriage with a young wife, because he changed his dinner-hour in consequence from half- * The learned Journalist is quite correct as to the quo- tation criticised, but will be glad to learn his inference to be mistaken. Surely the book’s world-wide reach of geographical notices may well acquit its Author, and rebut a seeming charge of so crass ignorance : being, in truth, an error, purely typographical ; a simple case, (not quite un- known to far more learned, even sacred writings,) of intru- sion, in the course of copying or printing, of a marginal or double reading; a correction, by mistake, left battling with | a phrase corrected: thus, for 'Ocean', read 'Atlantic.'592 OPINIONS OF THE ENGLISH PRESS past nine to eleven o’ clock in the forenoon, doubtless ate so much at his morning meal, that he had no longer time enough to digest it before retiring to rest in the evening. Those were days, when men ate like savages, and lived with almost as few comforts. Wordsworth has described our voracious ancestors, suffering for their sins of appetite in ‘another place’, as our legislators would say:— Cramming, as they on earth were cramm’d ; All sipping wine, all sipping tea ; But, as you by their faces see, All silent, and all d d. But nous avons changé tout cela. We have too many engagements, and our nerves are too highly wrought on by the exigencies of our daily life, to he able to enjoy a meal in the middle of the day. We dine, when the cares of the day are over, and we have time to appreciate the æsthetie objects of dinner—to please the palate, charm the eye, and add ‘the feast of reason and the flow of soul.’ He who knows how to dine, is the most civilised of human beings. Happy the man who, with a combination of ample income and enlightened taste, possesses also a good cook! It is impossible to rise from the persual of Mr. Urbain Dubois’ book, without feeling a profound respect for cookery, as an art. We are almost awed by the grandeur of it, and listen humbly to our author, when lie tells us, that ‘by its infinite ramifi- cations and accompaniments, the culinary art seems indispensable to the movement and life of nations.’ We are reminded, that ‘Her most Gracious Majesty’ of Prussia once stayed half-an-hour examining a trophy piscatorial, and that ‘hatelet skewers’ being the ‘diamonds of cookery, ought to be shown only on solemn occasions.’ But all this only proves the enthusiasm of Mr. Urbain Dubois, and prepares us for what is really a splendid introduction to the study of artistic cookery. As the French method of dining, or rather as the dinner à la française, is best adapted for display, most of tbe numerous plates, which embellish the volume, relate to dishes which appear on the table. For ourselves, we must profess our preference for dinner à la russe. We care little for seeing the joint or the entrée, if by its being carved in the kitchen, we get it hot, and simultaneously with our neighbours. The system, also, does not in any way interfere with conversation, and entremets and dessert can easily be made to ornament the centre of what -would otherwise be a blank table. And here we may express a hope, that our great cooks will not go much higher than a foot with table decorations. Nothing is more uncomfortable, than to be hidden from your opposite neighbour by some trophy or pièce montée. To enjoy a dinner, it is absolutely in- dispensable to be at ease. Nothing should interfere with conversation, with the noiseless supply of the various dishes, and with sitting at ease. What does Mr. Urbain Dubois think of the question of dining- room chairs ? It is a difficult thing to sit for two or three hours, without any rest for the arms; why not something in the shape of an arm-chair, not deep- seated, and suitable for the dingier table ? All the ‘removes’ and ‘entrées,’ and ‘pastry- pieces,’ illustrated by the author, arc meant to appear on the table, and therefore the decoration of the dishes is the chief feature of the descriptions in the book. It is artistic cookery from beginning to end ; except that in certain instances, we get a great deal of information about birds and fishes, that would be useful even to a naturalist. For instance, there are excellent engravings of the spigola, which is seen in the Neapolitan markets, the renke of Bavaria, the houc hen of the Danube, thesegui of Savoy, the sterlet.of the Volga; and we read:— ‘ The lakes and rivers of Austria are not only rich in fish, but they include several distinguished species; among which are to be found the ‘schill,’ the ‘fogosh,’ the ‘houchen,’ the ‘hasch,’ and the trout. Among the secondary species the carp, the perch, and the pike; those of the Danube are the finest and best. The ‘fogosh,’ the ‘houchen,’ the ‘hasch,’ the trout, and the ‘schill,’ occupy the first rank among the freshwater fish that may be served at dinner. On our continent I have been able to make the interest- ing observation , that in the countries which, on account of their distance from the sea, or of the unproductiveness of the latter, are thus deprived of its products, the abundance of the rivers, lakes, and ponds, supplies the absence of these resources. It would seem that Providence, in Its wise solicitude, had intended to distribute over every country an ample share of Its bounty and riches. The ‘fogosh’ often attains larger dimensions than the ‘schill’ and the ‘zander.’ They are commonly found to weigli from eight to twelve pounds. The form of the ‘fogosh’ is pretty, regular, and attractive. It somewhat ap- proaches that of the ‘schill,’ but its skin and flesh differ from it. The upper part of the back of the ‘fogosh’ is slightly tinged with grey, while the rest of the body is silvery. The smaller ‘fogosh,’ when very fresh, and just out of the water, is of an opaque white and mother-of-pearl color. The flesh of the ‘fogosh’ is white and firm.’ These are not the only instances of the great in- telligence, and varied knowledge, of Mr. Urbain Dubois. But it is as the artist-cook, that he stands unrivalled. Many of his designs for pièces montées would make the fortune of an architect. The song- writer, Dc Saugiers, must have had the great culinary artist in his mind, when he wrote 1 Un cuisinier, quand je dine, Me semble un être divin, Qui, du fond de sa cuisine Gouverne le genre humain ; Qu’ici bas on le contemple, Comme un ministre du ciel; Car la. cuisine est un temple, Dont les fourneaux sont l’autel.’ In the case of Our author, he sends temples of fat out of the kitchen, and altar-pieces of sugar out of the bake-oven. What a wonderful thing is ‘fat’ in the hands of an artist in cookery ! The fat of sheep’s kidneys, when properly mixed and prepared with lard, is a mine of wealth to the cook. ‘Mer- curies and Minervas in Fat’, ‘Flowers in Fat’, ‘A Horse in Fat’, ‘Obelisk in Fat’, and even ‘Child- ren in Fat’,—the latter is thus described. ‘The group is composed of five children, cast in fat, then touched up, and grouped in a pyramid. The same mould may serve for the five children, only they must be made to differ in a few details, by re-adjusting the arms, legs, and heads, to give them a different pose.’ The engraving of this group, actually made by the author, is an effective little statuary group, that would ornament a saloon. No cook with unartistic soul can attempt to imi- tate his illustrions confrère without failure. Mr.ON ‘THE ARTISTIC COOKERY.’ 593 Dubois warns the unwary against commencing the work of ornamentation, without being sure of perse- verance, as well as good taste. Alluding to the ‘Grande pièce orientale’, an elaborate piece of culi- nary architecture, he says : ‘Previous to undertaking the execution of a subject so minute in itself, demand- ing so many different abilities, the practitioner must have a just estimate of what he is about to face. The cook must absolutely pass through serious studies, in order to enable him to avoid fall- ing into errors, which would soon lead him into utter confusion.’ On another page he tells us, that ‘a pastry-cook must possess an enlightened and infallible intelligence’, and that ‘his talent must be as varied as his productions.’ After this, it will not surprise any one, when we confess that it seems presumptuous, in a humble reviewer like ourselves, whose talent may be as varied as his poor productions, but who is so far from possessing ‘infallible intelligence’, to venture to criticise the work of a great artist-cook. But we have already committed ourselves, and we can only hope that, with the generosity characteristic of all great minds, Mr. Urbain Dubois will kindly forgive our temerity. ‘Artistic Cookery’ will be a very useful book in all large establishments. Gentlemen can see, what niay be done in the way of ornamental dishes ; and cooks will find a fund of valuable suggestion from their ‘chef’ in the art We hope the present volume will meet with such success, as to ensure the publication of two other works, which Mr. Dubois promises. Land and Water, Feb. 12, 1870. ARTISTIC COOKERY. A Practical System, suited for the Use of the Nobility and Gentry, and for Public Entertainments. By Urbain Dubois, Chef de Cuisine of their Majesties the King and Queen of Prussia. (Longmans.) We cannot here do justice to the contents of this magnificent volume ; but it would be very pleasant to do so by an experi- mental verification of them, if the discussion could be removed from the library-table to the dinner- table. M. Dubois is not only a great culinary artist, hut a profound student of the history and science of his agreeable art. He intends to publish two other books on the subject, but this one contains what' will be found in practice most useful for the gui- dance of those who have to prepare grand banquets for distinguished companies of guests. It consists principally of exact descriptions of three or four hundred choice and elaborate dishes, accompanying the pictorial representations of these dishes, which are finely engraved, with a brief essay on each class of dishes and each kind of viands, and with a collection of the most appropriate and successful bills of fare, specifying those actually served to Royal personages on particular state occasions. There is also an explanation of the different modes of arranging the table and serving the repast, which are illustrated by larger engravings. The decorative artificial forms of some of the dishes, are not less attractive to the eye, than their flavor must be to the palate. A two-fold medallion portrait of the King and Queen of Prussia, to whom M. Dubois has dedicated his book, adorns the handsome volume. The Illustrated London News, Mar. 26, 1870. ARTISTIC COOKERY; A Practical System, suited for the use of the Nobility and Gentry, and for Public Entertainments. With eighty engraved plates. By Urbain Dubois, chef de cuisine to his Majesty the King of Prussia.—(London : Long- mans, Green, and Co. 1870.) The mere size and appearance of this magnificent volume will satisfy the housewife of moderate means, that its contents are not addressed to her. M. Dubois has doubtless reflected, that the works of his prede- cessors, Ude, Soyer, Francatelli, and a hundred cooks of lesser fame, have sufficiently explained to the middle-class those processes, by which a good dinner is prepared and served. He addresses a smaller body, but one more appreciative of the higher flights of art—the mighty (/ourmets of the earth, the sovereigns, the princes, and those proud companions of his craft, whose pre-eminent skill has earned them a place in palace-kitchens. Quoting from a former work of his own, as has been the habit of writers almost greater even than the King of Prussia’s cook, the author declares, on his title- page, ‘plus les peuples gagnent en intelligence, plus ils deviennent gourmets’ ; but M. Dubois evidently uses the word ‘people’ in the sense of the Latin populus. He does not, probably, mean to hint, that the plehs will derive much novel information of utility to them from his book ; but the patricians should wel- come it with acclamation. To those happy ones, who can venture to appropriate the menu of a royal banquet, and, without a study of their banker’s book, dare to emulate the magnificent extravagance of a coronation-feast, ‘Artistic Cookery’ will be an invaluable aid. M. Dubois, however, follows the fashion of the day in posing his remarks on a base, as wide, as it is indefinite. He remarks, that cookery, ‘by its infinite ramifications and accom- paniments, seems indispensable to the movement and life of nations.’ No one is likely to dispute this proposition. Whilst individuals retain the common prejudice against eating their food raw, nations must either practise cookery, or die. But the chef s enthusiasm carries him further. His art, he says, ‘animates and strengthens all that flows from it, or that serves as an auxiliary to it; agri- culture, commerce, industry, and art, are connected with it by ties, of which there is no mistaking the influence.’ In terms far simpler, but to much the same purpose, did the fly attribute to itself the cre- dit of making the chariot-wheel revolve. It is gratifying to observe, that the unostenta- tious merits of our English cuisine are becoming better understood amongst the masters of the art. M. Dubois again and again compliments our modest housewives. He observes with accuracy, that if the tables of the middle class amongst us be still defi- cient in variety of dishes, ‘the care bestowed on details, and the real comfort presiding there, make amends for this defect; and besides, here as every where else, improvement becomes every day more visible.’ Most especially, of course, our beef and mutton receive encomium; and the author enters at some length on the reasons for our superiority in these respects. In France, we learn, ‘the slaugh- tered bullocks are usually full-grown, that is to say, stronglimbed, muscular, and have attained their complete development; and, moreover, are not slaughtered before they have gone through a period as594 OPINIONS OF THE ENGLISH TRESS of work more or less long. In England, on the contrary, the native bullocks are bred and fattened, to be slaughtered as soon as they have attained the qualities required. Even those imported from Hol- land, Belgium, or Holstein, are purchased to be fat- tened, and fed with the utmost care before being slaughtered.’ He confesses that ‘it has always been with the utmost apprehension and reluctance’ he has introduced a sirloin of roast beef into his bill of fare on the continent. No where but in Eng- land does this remove obtain, on the part of cooks, that ‘foresight and sacrifice necessary to ensure its perfection.’ This is gratifying to read, in an age when the cooks and cookery of France have invaded the kitchen of every land, from China to Peru ; when the Sultan of Turkey, as we see by this book, opens his banquet with potaçje a la Reine, and winds it up with fromage glacé. One portion of M. Dubois’ work contains a not uninteresting collection of the menus drawn up for various occasions of festivity in the several courts of Europe. From this list we learn certain details, which tend in a manner to explain the somewhat monotonous ‘variety’ of royal ban- quets. Since we are lingering, in an idle moment, over this curious book, it may be worth while to extract the names of the cooks to each palace. The chef of the French Emperor appears to be M. Be- noit; that of the Pruss monarch is, of course, our author; his predecessor seems to have been a M. Bernard. England appears to have two chefs, Messrs. Muret and Auberlin. Austria retains the services of M. Claudius Martin, whose nationality is not so clearly established. Spain is certainly feasted by a Frenchman, M. Blanchard. Turkey seems to be satisfied with a Greek, Demitry Mavromykalli. Den- mark has another doubtful name, M. Viale. Italy enjoys the skill of M. Hélouis. Kussia rejoices in Thion. Bavaria employs Aubrey. Holland is feasted by Zimmermann, and Saxe-Weimar by Nebel. It is thus seen, that if we exclude the uncertain names of Martin, Viale, and Nebel, the unmistakeably Ger- man patronymic, Zimmermann, and the Greek Ma- vromykalli, six of the European kingdoms, viz. France, Prussia, England, Italy, Russia, and Bavaria, are ruled in matters of the kitchen by a French chef. To these we might a few months since have added Spain. When this is the case, one cannot be sur- prised that the Palace-feasts should exhibit little of the national cuisine. England preserves her roast beef and roast mutton with a sturdy resolution, that after a while becomes monotonous. The Crown Princess of Prussia clings to the favorite dish of her mother’s Palace, and insists on a remove of ‘Roast-beef and Yorkshire-pudding.’ Turkey ven- tures sometimes to have her fish à la Turque, and also « l'Orientale; she likewise indulges in War Doniassy (whatever that may be), and also in Visnali ekrneq and Faoulcsu. Spain feebly interpolates a cocido. But with these exceptions, our Royal menus are hopelessly French from end to end. And there is something much more extroardinary than this. Italy, the home of the vine, is supposed to have no vintage fit for her monarch’s table, except the sweet little Tintilla di Rota. Madeira, Lafitte, Rudes- lieimer, and Ay Mousseux, are the foreign beverages, with which the foreign dinner is washed down. Spain is in almost as bad a case; Xeres sec and Prio- rata are all the wines that she can furnish in a list of nine. Then French cooks do not show themselves ingenious in utilising that variety of product Nature has given to each country. The menu that was served in Italy to-day by M. Hélouis, would apparently be just the sort of thing, M. Thion might serve up in St. Petersburg. Much as we all have heard of the ingenuity of a great cordon bleu, his liberality of soul, quickness of eye, and brilliancy of imagination; it is natural that one should look at the lists compiled by M. Dubois, with some expecta- tion of finding there a proof of these qualities. He who does so will, we think, be disappointed. To whatever land the fates auspicious lead him, the chef carries not his native sauces only, nor even his sauces and wines, but his native ideas of what should be the raw material, on which to employ his art. That his sauces, and wines, and ideas are, on the whole, the very best that human mind and skill have yet devised, is beyond question ; but we cannot help thinking, that a greater readiness to adopt in all countries, what each possesses worth adopting, would be a most valuable addition to the many good qua- lities of these kings of the kitchen. Before passing quite away from the subject of the royal menus, we should like to call the attention of such among our readers as occasionally give their little ones a ball, to the excellent bill of fare con- tained on p xxix. There is here a choice of two suppers, hot or cold; both are admirable. For the benefit of those who will not meet with M. Dubois’ book, we give the carte entire : BAL D’ENFANTS. Les mets chauds sont posés sur table. SERVICE CHAUD. Ris au lait d’amandes. Sagou au consommé. Rissoles de légumes. Bouchées à la Béchamel. Filets de volaille.

This supper, as we understand, was designed for some ball of little princes; but there is nothing ex- travagant in the dishes, and we guarantee, that there shall not be an indigestion amongst the con- rives, if their nurses will not leave them more than half an hour in battle with the sweets. Passing from these examples, we approach that simplest effort of science, the hors d’oeuvre hot, and thence proceed to a very delicate subject indeed— the hatelct, or ornament to your entrees or removes. This matter is treated with a singular ability. ‘Being the diamonds of cookery’, we arc told, ‘hatelets ought to be shown only on solemn occa- sions, and applied to pieces worthy of such an honor.’ An admonition is offered to some cooks, which we trust all will attend to. ‘A guest’, says M. Dubois, ‘may sometimes be tempted to take a595 ON ‘THE ARTISTIC COOKERY.’ hâtelet garnished with a fine truffle’, or some such bonne bouche. It is therefore necessary, that these things should not be frauds o( wood or pasteboard, since such an unpleasant surprise ‘may cause doubts to arise in the minds of the guests.’ Let us hope that henceforth we may never put our hosts to shame, by attempting to devour a dummy truffle, or a pear of wax. Such ‘surprises’ have not been uncommon. A large portion of the book is devoted to fish ; and we are rejoiced to observe, that the King of Prussia’s cook authoritatively puts forth a maxim, which gourmets have long approved, but which the ignorant contemn: viz. ‘the potato is the natural accompaniment of boiled fish’ (p. 11). It will be useful in many houses at this day to know, that fish which has been preserved in ice, as is the case with so much that now reaches our markets, requires a much longer time to boil, and more care in the cook- ing, than that which is fresh. A hint very much needed is given, on page 13, in reference to the treatment of cod. M. Dubois suggests, that the head of this fish should be kept in shape by band- ages during the time of boiling. Nothing certainly is less enticing, as a rule, than the appearance of a cod fish’s head when it comes to table. One learns bits of curious information, here and there, in M. Dubois’ pages. Professor Agassiz no doubt mentions the fact, but we are sure it is not gene- rally known, that Guiana boasts three sorts of salmon—‘one short, with humps or bosses on the back, another covered as with a snow-white robe, and the third with stripes like a zebra.’ But ‘Artistic Cookery’ is not, as we have said before, an elementary work. It supposes the reader already acquainted with the scientific terms and treatment of the art, and reserves itself for the highest flights. It is on the designs for dishes, and ornament of the table, that M. Dubois’ well-earned fame will rest. These are indeed astonishing; but we are led to believe, and in many of the most extraordinary cases are distinctly told, that these castles and trophies, and mythological subjects, have been actually executed by the author 1'or his royal patron. No reader, who moves in aught but tho very highest of societies, could credit, or appreciate from description, the amazing objects offered for our imitation. Well may M. Dubois hint that, had not fate made of him a cook, nature had equally quali- fied his mind for the profession of the sculptor. We can almost believe it, on merely glancing at the sumptuous engravings of his chefs d’oeuvre represented in this book. Let us take, for example, No. 182, of which the author speaks somewhat slightingly. This singularly elegant design shows two bulls fighting in a pasture. Behind them is a shattered oak-tree, whose branches are yet covered with leaves. Transversely across the middle distance runs a rustic fence. The grass is elegantly broken with broad-leaved plants, and under them runs a stream, which pours down in a cascade on the dish itself. The bulls, the tree, herbage, and water, are merely luxuries of tbe eye. They stand in the centre of a huge dish, which contains a mélange of galantine, smoked beef, jelly, &c. This work of art is to be executed in ‘white fat.’ The material is not appetising, but M. Dubois might have recalled to cur memory, that young Canova did not disdain to execute his first statue in Flo- rence-butter. That masterpiece was long since j melted down; but, if the beautiful engravings of this I book are to be considered as true to their models, | it may well be doubted whether the young sculptor could have surpassed tbe mature excellence of M. Dubois’ work, as displayed in the lion on plate 30. As an example of boldness in design, and consum- j mate grace in execution, we would call the reader’s notice to the hunting trophy on plate 163n, where every accoutrement of the continental sports- man, from his gun to his whistle, and almost every description of game that he can encounter, are accu- rately reproduced in that classic material—fat. ‘Nothing stops our artists, nothing diverts them from the purpose to be attained; they seek with perseverance to penetrate the mysteries of science.’ Animated with these sentiments, they naturally turn to pastry. Great subject. ‘Sculpture and archi- tecture are the sources, from which they draw their inspiration;’ and ‘he who is a stranger to the secret resources of the culinary art, has little con- ception of the wonderful results, that a skilful practi- tioner can produce from a sugarloaf.’ From what we have already said, the reader will have ceased to be in the position of the ignorant. He wTill not doubt that a sugar-loaf, in M. Dubois’s hands, is transformed into very strange shapes indeed—cas- tles and balloons, and military trophies, and Gothic monuments, and Chinese pagodas, and ships, and goddesses, and fountains; one turns with amazement from the elaborate engravings to the little bits of letter-press, which explain how the wonders repre- sented are produced. M. Dubois, however, aiming at a higher standard than his predecessors, does not only tell the ‘how’, he enters on the ‘why’, and the ‘when’, and the ‘where.’ A true French artist, he loves the unities, and this quality alone would give his work a special value. We rejoice to hear, that ‘Artistic Cookery’ is but ‘the first step towards a complete work’, which the author intends pub- lishing in England. In his own interest, it is to he hoped, that the forthcoming volumes will be of more convenient size, and of more general utility, than this we have under hand. Books, nowadays, must he addressed to a larger public, than the one M. Dubois has in view, if profit be sought in their publication; but there is a class, though a small one, to whom ‘Artistic Cookery’ will be a valuable help. The first essential for a scientific writer—thorough comprehension of his subject—M. Dubois possesses; the second—an entire devotion to it—is manifest in every page. The Daily News, Feb. 28, 1870. DUBOIS’S ARTISTIC COOKERY* Another‘Cook’s oracle’ ! ‘Scitatum oraculaventris (it might he ‘gulae’ hut for the false quantity) Mittimus’! And truly, if the responses are given, in any approximate proportion to the cost of * Artistic Coolcrry. With Eighty Engraved Plates. By Urban Dubois, Chef de Cuisine of their Majesties the King and Queen of Prussia. London: Longmans & Co. 18T0. 38*OPINIONS OF THE ENGLISH PRESS 596 seeking, which in this case means purchasing the volume, a visit to this shrine ought not to he fruit- less. But wherefore another Cook’s oracle, it may he asked ; when Ude, Francatelli, Soyer, Jules Gouffé, with a host of minor culinary stars, have done so much to satisfy the demands of artist and epicure alike? It would seem, that a point of honor is involved. Since the days of Vatel, that martyr to an exigeant sense of what was due to his art and to his master, the sensitiveness of artists of the cuisine has been proverbial ; and we can believe, that every pre-eminent officier de bouche regards it as a sacred debt to the employer whose palate he serves, that lie should allow no rival chef to outdo him either in conception or in execution, either in serving a dinner or ball-supper, or in setting out an account of them in print. If we admit this solution, it be- comes manifest why the chef de cuisine of their Truss Majesties, owes it to himself and his Royal patrons, to plunge into the pursuits of literature; and why, when making this plunge, and for a time for- saking the knife and the mould for the pen and the quarto page, etiquette constrains him to do so in a two-guinea volume, wherein the arts of cookery and pastry in general, and the perfection which they attain in the Prussian Court in particular, may he adequately and faithfully celebrated. It is expedient, however, for practical purposes, that we should examine, what this splendid-looking volume is to do for those who master its contents; and if avc may assume at once the standpoint of the many; who do not fare sumptuously every day, or command habitual access to those divitum mensae, at which the Paris Correspondent of a contemporary has always a knife and fork; hut who for the most part live plainly enough to keep the mental vision unenslaved to the tyrant stomach ; we should say that in these pages there is for plain folks, very much to amuse, very much to admire, rather than to envy, and some little to profit by, and to make a note of. To our thinking M. Urbain Dubois is not a tithe as entertaining, companionable, or practicable, as Jules Gouffé; of whom he falls very far short in simplicity, common sense, and engaging frankness. But the most epicurean of readers can hardly fail to he tick- led by the grandiloquence, mystery, and eternal flourish of trumpets, wherewith in this hook Urbain Dubois seeks to exalt his office—an office to which literature, sculpture, architecture, painting, and the fine arts generally are but so many handmaids ; and • every one must he struck with the marked contrast, in this respect, between him and his more practical compatriot. The style of each, in fact, appreciably affects their books. Whilst on closing that of Gouffé we feel, that he has condescended to our level, and put us in good conceit with our limited culinary possibilities, the distant visions of Prussian splen- dor, of which M. Dubois vouchsafes us a myste- rious glimpse, are rendered more remote and unapproachable, by his manifest dislike of descending to aught below regal magnificence, and of con- templating any dinners, which are not for the mo- narch or the millionaire. Even on the point of number of guests, he would be *he very antipodes of Mr. Walker, the editor of the Original, and would shrug his shoulders at the notion of a Christmas- dinner for three, of crimped cod, woodcocks, and plum-pudding; or of a party of six, which sat down, with the aforenamed ‘aristologist’, to spring soup, turbot, ribs of beef, a crab, and some jelly. ‘ The dègree of importance of a dinner’, according to M. Dubois, ‘is indicated by the number of the entrées, which regulates the number of removes, roasts, and entremets ; and if he is alive to the meaning of En- glish adjectives, such dinners of importance must be dull affairs, for he lays down, a propos of bills of fare, that ‘they should be simple, serious, and cor- rect, like the dinners they announce’ Now a really simple dinner may he delightful; a correct dinner, in the sense of a dinner comme il faut, is what most people would appreciate ; but if, from a glance at the carte which details the viands to be partaken of, a guest could get an inkling that the entertainment wras to he ‘serious’, it would he the part of poor generalship, if he did not invent an excuse, and beat a retreat in limine. We surmise, however, that the author is not so solicitous about the exact meaning of his epithets, as about their grandeur and sonorousness, and that the sentence we have quoted is really a hit at some unnamed entertainers, who ‘provide too long a bill of fare for too short a dinner;’ and that our surmise is not unfounded, may be gathered from one or two sam- ples of fine language which, if they do not add to the amount of information given in Artistic Cookery, at any rate contribute to the amusement derivable from it. Thus in p. 7 he tells us that ‘hâtelets’ (». c. the ornaments variously applicable to ‘cold pieces’, relevés, and entrees) are the ‘diamonds of cookery, only to be shown on solemn occasions, and applied to such pieces as are worthy of such an honor’; but although he suggests that hâtelets should not be counterfeit or inedible, for fear an epicure should take a fancy to a sham crayfish or eock’s-comb; it does not seem to have occurred to him, that the comparison to diamonds would be all the more forcible, if the inedible hâtelets were liken- ed to the paste jewellery which so frequently coun- terfeits the real article. Another rich sample of fine language is to be found in his directions for ‘carp à la Chambord.’ ‘ I may say,’ he writes, ‘that the carp is a fish of opportuneness, rather than of luxury’—a distinction, which reminds us of a story told of a country amphitryon in our younger days, who used to be seen, net in hand, running down to his fish-pond to catch a carp, just as the carriages were setting down the guests for his dinner-party. Indeed, so great is M. Dubois’s fondness for tall talk about the works of his calling, that we are led to think he has contracted it from the daily habit of constructing pyramids and light- houses and towers and rocks, of gum-paste and almond-paste, and icing-sugar, and what-not. Other- wise it would be hard to divine the meaning of such a sentence as the following, in reference to ‘removes of meat’ :— ‘Removes of meat, like those of fish, possess the privilege, over other dishes, of being served in voluminous forms, without overstepping the rules that are admitted and tolerated ; this prerogative is certainly consistent and logical; hold proportions are in unison with those pieces of meat, which represent in our eyes the strength and sturdiness of the robust animals, which man, who rules the earth, subjugates by his intelligence, and appoints to be his food.’507 ON ‘THE ARTISTIC COOKERY.’ A tolerably large-proportioned mouthful, we think, for a reader to swallow, when he is required to learn that large joints, even such as the double- haunch of mutton figured in Plate 9, are admissible at a ‘classic’ dinner, whatever that may represent. At another place we are almost bidden to believe, that ‘the ornamentation of cold-pieces’ is ‘the study of the infinite’, and ‘that to look for luxury beyond the true principles of this science’, is ‘to lose oneself in the mazes of uncertainty’—a state- ment, which to an English cook would convey the meaning, that ‘hasty cookery’ was tantamount to ‘atheism’ ; and elsewhere, again, on the topic of green-pease, our author exhibits much orthodox gratitude in the remark, that ‘Nature in her bene- volent bounty and maternal providence scatters her treasures over the whole surface of the earth.’ But perhaps it is a little hard, to find fault with M. Dubois, for his efforts to bo eloquent and classical in diction; for has he not studied at Rome the science of modelling, with a view to culinary ornamentation, as well as of applying icing - sugar to pieces of pastry? And, to tell the truth, he does much to disarm our criticism, when, besides assigning to old England a special favor of Providence in the matter of green-pease, he states emphatically, that John Bull can boast the finest and best flavored venison, the richest and most juicy sirloins of beef, and the most delicious and distinguished turkeys, in the world. Mollified by this flattering unction, let us turn from the manner to the matter of this so-called ‘album of classic cookery.’ And we must begin with admitting that, though it is obvious that its author only contemplates the entertainments of the wealthy of the earth, there is a fair share of tolerably simple and achievable dishes, as to which directions are given in these pages. He is too fond ofmadeira- sauce for his ‘calves’ kidneys sautés’, and his thrushes à la Médicis, and ‘émincé of roebuck en bordure ;’ and sets at nought evidently the sound wisdom of Goutte, whose manual substitutes any sound white wine for so precious a draught; and when one reads of seven chickens being required to make an entrée—namely , ‘chicken-fillets with truffles’ (see p. 58)—it is a relief to find, that so many head of poultry are not actually slaughtered for the breasts only, as the chickens’ legs (fourteen there will be of them) are especially devoted to the preparation of a ‘supreme sauce.’ But in his ‘pi- geons stuffed with mushrooms’, ‘sweetbreads à la Colbert’, ‘epigrammes of lamb à la Jardinière', ‘lobster-cutlets à la Victoria’, and such like dishes, there is plenty of good taste, and little deviation from simplicity, barring in some instances the ma- deira. His ‘salmi of woodcocks’ (p. 68), and his ‘vol-au-vent à la marinière’ (p. 62), prepared by competent artists, would satisfy the daintiest palate, and yet not argue any grave extravagance. In truth it is more, when he enters the regions of ‘cold- pieccs’ and ‘pastry’, that M. Urbain Dubois soars far above the heads of common folk, and propounds subjects for ornament rather than use, which excite our marvel by their elaborate unreality. In Plate 20, No. 136, is engraved ‘A Bastion in ‘Pain’ of Game;’ and by help of the letterpress we find, that it con- sists of a fabric of wood, masked in fat, and exter- nally wrought in fat with an outside glaze. One of course infers, that the bastion must have something edible within it; but the wight who storms the citadel, will be puzzled, without directions, where to lay his hand on the hidden treasure. It seems, however, that beside cannon-balls of black truffles, peeled, which lie in heaps very convenient for the besieging party, the central and' surrounding towers contain ‘pain’ of pheasant, partridge, grouse, moun- tain-cock, &c. all no doubt very good, when one can get at it. Just such another device is the ‘lias- tion of Eels’ in p. 101, while ‘Neptune’s Chariot’, in the same page and engraving, seems to be all wire, wood, and fat; except the crayfish and lobsters which give reality to the fat waterfall, and the small trout, cooked au bleu, which crowd the space between the first and second gradin. The War, Fishing, and Hunting Trophies, which follow, may and must require skill for modelling; but since in these there is even less appeal to the gustative sense, than in the Bastions, one may be excused for appreciating more highly the Wild Boar’s Head in galantine (p. 126 —7) and the ‘Ham historié’ in p. 109, both pieces de résistance, and the latter a very fair surprise, it being a sham sucking-pig of modelled butter with a real ham back, cooked, carved, and ready for use. In the pastry-sections we have pavilions, lighthou- ses, spires, rocks, ruins, waterfalls, wherein gum- paste, almond-paste, icing-sugar, and spun-sugar, | play their appropriate parts ; but most of these chefs d’oeuvre have nothing eatable—e. g. the ‘grand pièce gothique’, p.205—6, has nothing edible, except the cakes which garnish the base of the rock, even the biscuit-work and the sugar which forms the rock, being only meant to be looked at. In Plato 60 there is a very pretty piece called ‘Hive meringué, or ‘Méringue en ruche’, and as one learns that cer- tain ‘méringues’ are the traditional entremets of the family dinners of the Truss Court, it might seem safe to conclude, that the first-named piece would be a very ‘pretty dish to set before the King’ by way of variety. But hear M. Dubois. ‘Such pieces are not generally made to be eaten, therefore are not to be filled inside, but may bo surrounded with small méringues garnished with cream.” The | King’s eye alone can feast on this ‘hive’ unrestrain- | edly ; and the disappointment must be akin to that of one who, seeing the ‘Ruin in Génoise cake’ I (p. 204), thinks to himself, that there can be no j harm in going on with the work of devastation im- plied in the name. Alas ! a study of M. Dubois’s I letterpress apprises us, that these ruins arc not meant to be eaten. For the importunate and rave- nous there is an apologetic garnish of cakes at the bottom. To do M. Dubois justice, there is more reality in his treatment of fish-cookery. It is true that in one of his cold-pieces—river-trout with jelly—lie recommends, that the lobsters at each end of the stand should be of cast-fat, and the same is the case i with the coral in like pieces ; but in fish-removes he is not only exceptionally practical and sensible, but also exhibits a curious knowledge of the collateral branch of natural history. His researches into the latter are of course ruled by his love of his own art, but this part of his book is all the more interesting j for its information about the Ilouchen of the South German rivers, the Fogosli of the Austrian lakes, the Pagcl of the Mediterranean, and, chief of all, the Segui, a whitish trout of great fragrance, lightness,OPINIONS OF THE ENGLISH PRESS 598 and delicacy, from Russia, which. M. Dubois will answer for our getting fresh from S. Petersburg if we will pay for it. He lauds also the Yankee luxury of turtle forehns à l’Américaine, which he served at Konigsberg last autumn for a dinner of a hundred guests ; and suggests that European fish-markets might as easily avail themselves of the American novelties in the fish line (the Weak-fish, the Blue- fish, the Sheeps-head-fish, &c.) as the New-World marts supply themselves with our fish. He thinks, indeed, that we might take a hint from their won- derful pains and success in transporting all sorts of fish for market supply. It is unnecessary to say, that he prescribes for all these strange fish the most appropriate and appetising mode of cookery. But we are most taken with his views, as to the cooking of our old standard fish—cod, turbot, salmon; those time-honored dainties, which no new comers are likely to supplant, and which he seeks to render even more acceptable, by hints as to dressing. Thus, for instance, he strongly urges that ‘to eat a cod- fish with all its exquisite qualities, it must be cut into slices before it is cooked’ (p. 12) ; ‘ that salmon (whatever may be said to the contrary) is not always cooked to perfection when boiled whole’, and that it is an excellent plan to serve it cut into slices—an elegant sample for a ball-buifet will be found at p. ’J2. This plan of slicing is in high favor with those fish-epicures, the Dutch, who achieve the highest success in this way with their turbots. No doubt a fine turbot is a fine sight on table; ‘but real amateurs of fish sacrifice the form to the deli- cacy of the food, by having turbots boiled, crimped, or at least cutup.’ As this hint is for'work-a-day folks worth all the triumphs of paste and sugar in the later pages of the volume, we shall make no apology for transcribing it, by way of showing, that we have not come empty away from the oracle of Urbain Dubois. ‘Turbot cut in slices’, p. 21: — ‘ First the fish is divided lengthwise into two parts, which are again divided crosswise into slices of different lengths. To set the flesh of the turbot, it should be sprinkled with salt, and thus left for ten or twelve minutes, with the addition of a few pieces of ice. Twenty minutes previous to serving, it is steeped in cold water, then plunged into boil- ing salted water; having boiled for five minutes the pan is drawn to the side of the fire, covered with its lid, and the liquid kept simmering for 12 or 18 minutes, according to the thickness of the pieces. The turbot, when done, is piled up at the last mo- ment on a remove-dish, covered with a folded nap- kin and garnished round with sprigs of fresh parsley.’ The value of the book would be greatly enhan- ced by a good glossary. The Saturday Review, April 9, 1870. ARTISTIC COOKERY. A Practical System, suited for the Use of the Nobility and Gentry, and for Public Entertainments. With 80 engraved Plates. By Urbain Dubois, Chef de Cuisine of their Majesties the King and Queen of Prussia, &c. London : Longmans. 1870. This is an ambitious work, beautifully illustrated, and altogether got up in the most expensive way. It contains all the information that could be requi- red to make a feast worthy of princes and princesses, or to satisfy the tastes of the most fastidious. The science of good living and the research after delicate viands were the privileges of the few ; nowadays, as our author says, epicures may be counted by legions. They will, doubtless, hail this volume as the first instalment of an exhaustive system of cookery, at once practical, scientific, and artistic. The Lancet, April 9, 1870. ARTISTIC COOKERY: A Practical System suited for the Use of the Nobility and Gentry, and for Public Entertainments. With 80 engraved plates. By M. Urbain Dubois, Chef de Cuisine of their Majesties the King and Queen of Prussia, author of ‘Cuisine Classique’ and ‘Cuisine de Tous les Pays.’ London : Longmans. 1870. Such is the title of the superb volume in quarto, which lies before us. It is evidently the work of a man, who has passed his professional life in the kitchens of the most august and regal personages, and who condescends to enlighten the world. The curious thing is, that such a man should select English as the medium of communication with the outer world. The truth is, as he himself says in his pre- face , that England is now the land of cookery, par excellence ; a fact which was previously not unknown to some of us. Most people associate the perfection of cookery with Paris, and so it may be among a select few; but there is much more good cookery in England, than there is in France. In fact, ever since the time, when every Frenchman would insist on having patties, and on dining off numerous plate— all at a small cost too—French cookery has declined. And then we have the immense advantage of the best raw material going; our beef and mutton arc the best in the world, our game will compare with most, no part of the island is too remote for a sup- ply of fresh sea-fish daily. But to give a new tone to an old proverb; if we supply meat, we must go elsewhere for cooks ; our chefs are, almost to a man foreigners. So also are the authors of our mpst esteemed treatises—Francatelli, Gouffé, and now Dubois. The volume of the latter, which is now before us, is peculiar; it aims at the eye, as well as at the palate and stomach. It has been M. Dubois’ aim to describe; not only the most artistic modes of cooking fish, flesh, and we know not what all; but also to depict the most artistic way of placing it on the table. In fact, the plates of various dishes constitute the prime feature of his superb volume, the fault of which, if it has one, is, that it soars above the bulk of mankind. We cannot all be kings, princes, or millionaires; and one is too apt, on looking at the volume, to say within himself—this may be all very well, but it is not for the like of me. Such a con- clusion would be unjust, as it would be superficial. 'On no subject is the author more worthy of atten- tion, than on fish, whose natural history he would indeed seem to have studied with avidity, in order the better to cater to the palates of his royal mas- ters. Now, speaking of fish-removes generally, and the various ways of cooking them, he says:—‘Boiled599 ON ‘THE ARTISTIC COOKERY.’ fish ought to have but one garnish—that is, peeled pottoes, steamed, and served very hot. The potato is the natural companion of the fish, and especially when the fish is boiled, and in this case should never be separated from it.’ This is surely within the attainment of all, yet how seldom—we might almost say never—are good, hot, smoking potatoes served with that portion of the feast which most lacks their presence! Again, he says:—‘A fish, which is not cooked long enough, is not eatable ; if it be too much done, it loses its most precious qua- lities.’ After which he observes, that ‘fish’ which have been in ice, always require much longer time, and are more difficult, to cook’—a remark which cooks in this country, where the use of ice is so extensive, will do well to bear in mind. ‘Large boiled fish, (says M. Dubois), require simple, light, delicate, and well-buttered sauces’ (as a writer M. Dubois is exceedingly fond of adjectives) ; which, as a rule, we never have in this country of melted butter, shrimp and” lobster-sauce. There is no better means of attaining a light and properly-flavored sauce, than by adding to the butter, which enters into its composition, a proportion of the stock in which the fish has been boiled. This fact M. Dubois repeatedly points out. Another matter of no little importance, is the mode of cooking large fish. As a rule, in England they arc cooked whole ; but among people who use fish as a principal article of diet, rather than as a kind of luxury, as we do; the plan is adopted of dividing the fish into slices, before placing it in the kettle. This mode receives M. Dubois’ warm com- mendation. We cannot say, if that be the sole reason ; but we can speak to the superiority of salmon freshly caught and so treated, over salmon as it makes its way to our tables in London. The fish-stock should invariably form part of the sauce, with wdiich salmon is served. All through the book M. Dubois strongly insists on the employment of edible substances for orna- menting hâtelets—that is, the skewers used to hold everything in place; for he points out, how awkward it is, for some gourmet to be attracted by what looks a fine imposing truffle, and to find it inedible. In certain of his more imposing cold-pieces, M. Dubois would seem, however, to use a good deal in the way of stands, supports, and what not, which would be liable to mislead the unwary and uninitiated. It would be out of our province to enter into all the details of this elaborate volume; we can only heartily commend it to the consideration of all. There is an Eastern form of felicitation which says, ‘ May you live a thousand years ! ’ we rather think we can cap that, by saying to our readers, may M. Urbain Dubois become your cook’s oracle!

GEORGE First Cla3S Diploma National Training School of Cookery, London ; Mistress of Cookery- at King Edward’s High School for Girls, Birmingham FOURTH IMPRESSION LONDON EDWARD ARNOLD 41 & 43 MADDOX STREET, BOND STREET, W. [All rights reserved]■ ' f PRINTED BY BILLING AND SONS, LIMITED, GUILDFORDPREFACE I have been induced to write this book because, from my experience as mistress of cookery in King Edward’s High School for Girls, Birmingham, I have felt the great need of a suitable text-book. My aim has been to write a clear, concise, and methodical manual, which will contain everything that the ordinary Englishwoman of the middle class need know about cookery. It has a wide range, insomuch as it includes artisan, household, and a little high-class cookery, so that I believe the book will be as useful to those who have £200 a year at their disposal as to those who have £1,000. The lack of such a text-book is no doubt due to the tardi- ness with which the advantages of including cookery in the modern high-school curriculum have been realized. Surely the art of cookery is an important one both for its own sake and as a training for other things. If arranged so as to come in the school course when girls are between the ages of twelve and sixteen years, every girl will acquire much necessary and useful knowledge; she will receive a special kind of training in thoroughness, dexterity, accuracy, neatness, method, and order, which will be of great service to her in later years. As to the practical importance of cookery in itself I need say nothing, for I believe all will agree that ignorance of thePREFACE VI art in the young housewife has been not seldom the cause of a good deal of misery in the home. As regards the special points of the book, I have sought in my arrangement, as far as possible, to educate readers to think for themselves by giving them principles and rules by which to work. With this object in view, I have given the founda- tions in most cases separately, and in cakes the principal methods of mixing also. If these are thoroughly learnt, all cake-making will be much simplified. This applies also in the case of soups and sauces. I think the appendices will be found useful, and also the chapter on afternoon teas, especially now that this form of entertainment is such a favourite one. Although written in the first instance for my pupils here, I have every reason for hoping that this book will find its way, not only into many other secondary schools where cookery is taught, but into domestic circles, where a simple and practical manual is always welcome.

All utensils must be carefully washed in hot water to which a little soda has been added; the soda by softening the water removes grease more effectually. No soda must be used, however, when scrubbing boards and tables or anything wooden, as the soda discolours wood; this is only allowable when the wood is very greasy : a little must then be added. Copper Saucepans, Moulds, etc.—These must be washed in soda water, and the inside cleaned with soap and silver- sand. Clean the outside with a few drops of vinegar mixed with salt and a little sand; this makes the copper a good colour. Einse quickly and clean all over with soap and sand to prevent it from tarnishing. Einse again and dry with a hot swab wrung out very tightly, then polish with a leather and whiting, using a brush for the crevices. Tins, Steel Stewpans, Patty-pans, Baking-sheets, etc.—Wash these in soda water, cleaning them inside and out with soap and sand. Einse thoroughly, dry with a swab, and polish with a leather and whiting. Skewers and Trussing-needles.—Wash these in soda water and polish with emery-paper. Iron Saucepans.—Clean the inside with soap and sand, and wipe the outside with a swab.INTRODUCTION xx Sieves.—Wash in warm water, no soda. The water should not be too warm, for if the sieve has been used for meat or fish it will cook it, so rendering it more difficult to remove. Hair Sieves.—Scrub with a strong scrubbing-brush, using a little sand for the wooden parts only. Rinse thoroughly and dry. Wire Sieves.—Scrub all over with soap and sand, rinse, and dry. Brass Taps.—Clean with vinegar and salt, rinse. Clean with soap and sand, rinse. Dry thoroughly and polish with a leather and whiting. It is not necessary to use polish, which is expensive. Brass Kettles.—Wash well and dry. Rub with a little metal polish, rubbing it off with a soft cloth. Polish with a leather and whiting. Wooden Tables and Boards.—Wash with warm water, sprinkle with sand, rub a little soap on a scrubbing-brush, and scrub well the way of the grain. Rinse several times and dry with a swab. For cleaning brass, copper, or steel stewpans, the following will be found an excellent mixture : 1 lb. whiting, 1 lb. soft soap, 1 lb. silver sand, 1 quart water. To Mix.—Put all the ingredients into a saucepan together, stir until they come to boiling-point, stir frequently until the mixture becomes thick. Put into jars, tie down, and use as required. COOKING RANGES AND STOVES CLEANING OF RANGES. Rake out the ashes from the firebox. Remove all the flue- doors and the plate-rack, pull out the dampers. Sweep the flues well with a flue-brush, using a small brush for the fluesINTRODUCTION xxi above the oven. Rake out the soot from underneath the ovens, which will have fallen from the flues, into a dustpan, and then sweep with a brush. Brush the hot-plate, empty the ash-box, and leave the ashes ready to be sifted. Wash the ovens thoroughly with strong soda and water. To blnclclead the Range.—Moisten the blacklead with a little water, and put on as little as possible, rub off with another blacking-brush and polish with a third. Put back the flue- doors. Polish the plate-rack with emery-paper and put back in its place. Clean the handles of the oven doors with emery- paper. TO CLEAN A GAS STOVE. Wipe the bars and wash with hot soda and water, lift them off, and wash the rings, removing all grease, etc. Wipe the pipes, scrub the plate underneath with soap and sand, dry well and put the rings and bars back. Wash the oven with soda and water and wipe all the bars inside, clean the tray under- neath. Clean the pipe in front of the hot plate and the taps with emery-paper, then polish the brass taps with whiting and a leather. Lighting a Range Fire.—Put a few cinders or small pieces of coal in the firebox, then put a little crumpled paper, lay some dry sticks across lattice fashion, then a few pieces of coal on top. Pull out the dampers and light the fire with a match; as it begins to burn well add more coal, and make up a good fire. When well burnt through push in the dampers except those which are required. It is very important to have a good cooking apparatus. There are various modes of heating—viz., by coal, gas, oil, charcoal, and electricity ; coal and gas being the most general. Coal ranges may be either opened or closed, the latter being the most convenient and economical. In an open range it is necessary to have a large fire to do a small amount of cooking, and a great deal of the heat is lostINTRODUCTION xxii passing up the chimney, also the saucepans get very dirty and frequently the contents smoky • whereas in a perfectly con- structed closed range, where the firebox has a movable bottom, by which it can be raised or lowered as required, only a small amount of fire is necessary to keep all the saucepans on the hot-plate boiling. Then, again, the heat of the oven in the open ranges is very uneven. In the closed ranges the flues are so arranged that the heat can be directed over the top and down the side of the oven as required for roasting, or down the side and along the bottom as required for baking. A closed range is no detriment to roasting in front of the fire, as when the firebox is at its lowest there is as great a surface of heat as in an open range. In choosing a range, it is best to have one with iron flues; there is less chance of their getting out of order through the expansion and contraction caused by the heat. There is no danger of defective setting, which is often the case when one is dependent upon brick flues. Gas stoves are very convenient, especially in the summer, when heat is only required for cooking. The oven only requires from five to ten minutes to heat. Gas stoves are cleaner and save time, as no stoking is required. If properly fixed and ventilated, there is little or no smell. They can be rented from 2s. 6d. per quarter. Thermometers can be fitted to the ovens of either. They cost about 12s. 6d., and are a guide in regulating the heat of the oven. Although a good cooking range is a great comfort, it is possible for an experienced cook to turn out very successful dishes frem a poor apparatus.xxiLi INTRODUCTION CULINARY HEATS Failure in turning out a dish successfully is often due to lack of knowledge of the various heats required. If a thermo- meter is used, it is easy to obtain the requisite degree of heat. The following is a list of the necessary degrees for different modes of cooking : CAKING. Bread 340° to 350° F. Puff pastry ... 340° Short pastry and cakes 300° to 320° Meat pies ... 290° OVEN ROASTING. Pork... 320° Beef and veal 310° Game and poultry ... 310° Mutton 300° FRYING. Whitebait ... 400° Meat... 370° to 380° Fish ... 350° to 375° Fritters 340° to 375° No cooking is done at a temperature of less than 180° F.

Stock forms the basis of most soups and many sauces. It is the liquid in which hones, meat, or vegetables have been boiled. It should not be strongly flavoured, as it would render it unsuitable for the more delicate sauces and soups. It should be clear, and of a pale colour. Stock made from meat must be simmered very gently; boiling would harden the meat, and prevent the complete extraction of the juices. But in making stock from bones, boil quickly, as the goodness to be extracted will consist chiefly of gelatine, and this can be more thoroughly extracted by a high temperature. The lid of the stockpot should fit well to prevent unnecessary loss of steam. This stock will set to a firm jelly when cold. It will have less flavour than that made with meat, but will be more suitable for making glaze and for braising. There are several kinds of stock, viz.: 1. First stock, or clear stock. 2. Good economical stock. 3. Second stock. 4. Game stock. 5. Fish stock. 6. Vegetable stock. The first or clear stock is cleared with meat, or meat and white of egg, and is used for all consommes. 12 KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK The good economical stock is a cheaper stock, and is used for such soups as brown soup, macaroni soup, etc., without being artificially clarified. Second stock, the stock which is made by using the meat and bones left from making first stock, with the addition of fresh vegetables. Game stock, used for game soups, gravy to be served with game, kromeskics, etc. Fish stock, made from white fish, is used for fricassees of fish, sauces, and fish soups. Rules for Stock. 1. If you have no stockpot, use a saucepan with a closely fitting lid. 2. Chop bones into small pieces, cut meat into pieces. 3. Use cold water to extract all goodness, add salt before the water gets hot (1 tcaspoonful to 1 gallon water). 4. Bring slowly to boiling-point. 5. Skim well. G. After skimming add vegetables, herbs, and peppercorns. Use vegetables and herbs sparingly. 7. When making stock from bones boil quickly, but if from meat simmer genoly. 8. Herbs when fresh should be tied up in bundles, when dry in a piece of muslin. 9. Lid to be kept tightly on to keep in the steam. 10. Stock should be made the day before it is wanted, so that all fat can be removed before it is used. 11. Boil for five or six hours, strain into an earthenware basin. The bones can be used for making more stock, but the vegetables should be thrown away. 12. Never leave stock to get cold in the saucepan. 13. The saucepan to be thoroughly cleaned each day. 14. To keep stock good in hot weather, boil it up every day, and put it in a clean basin.STOCKS 3 15.

Bemove the fat from the stock, and wipe with a hot cloth. Put into the saucepan, keeping back any sediment there may be, and add all other ingredients, except whites and shells of eggs. Stir over the fire with a whisk until the gelatine has dissolved, then add the white (slightly whisked), and the shells crushed. Whisk vigorously until it comes to the boil; 2is KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK let it come well lip, and then simmer for ten minutes by the side of the fire, with the lid partly on. Strain through a hot teacloth. Aspic Jelly (2). 1 calf’s foot. 2 pennyworth of giblets. 2 quarts water. 1 teaspoonful salt. 12 peppercorns. 1 clove. 1 carrot. 1 turnip. 1 shallot. 3 sticks of celery. Bunch of herbs. Rind and juice of 1 lemon. £ gill malt vinegar. \ gill tarragon vinegar. 1 tablespoonful chilli vinegar. 1 gill sherry. J oz. gelatine. Whites and shells of 3 eggs. Blanch the calf’s foot, and cut in pieces. Clean the giblets. Put these, with the calf’s foot, into a saucepan, with the water and salt. Bring to boiling-point, skim well, add the vege- tables, peppercorns, herbs, and clove. Boil gently for five hours, skimming frequently. Strain through a hair sieve. When cold, remove all fat, put the stock into a saucepan, and if it is not a stiff jelly add the gelatine. Put in the lemon- juice, vinegars, the sherry, the whites of eggs slightly beaten, and the shells broken up. Clear (as in No. 1). Clarified Fat. Cut the fat into small pieces, and put them into a saucepan with enough water to cover. Boil rapidly with the lid on for five or ten minutes to soften and whiten the fat. Remove the lid, and continue the boiling until all the water has evaporated, when the liquid will be clear instead of milky in appearance. Stir occasionally to prevent the pieces of fat from adhering to the bottom of the saucepan, which causes a good deal of spluttering. Gradually the pieces will render down, leaving little pieces of shrivelled skin and clear oil or fat. Allow this to cool for a few minutes, then strain into a tin. This fat when cold should be nearly as white as lard, and free from a meaty flavour. It will be found most useful for frying purposes, also for pastry and plain cakes. It is an excellent way of using up superfluous fat or suet.CHAPTER II FISH Choose fish which is in season; it is more wholesome, and has a finer flavour. Choose very fresh fish, as it soon deteriorates and becomes unwholesome. When fresh the flesh is firm and a good colour, the eyes bright, and gills red. The skin of haddock, whiting and smelts is silvery, and shiny when fresh. The red spots on plaice are bright and distinct, but gradually fade as the fish becomes stale. Plenty of scales are a good sign. The smell is one of the best tests. Fish must be carefully and thoroughly cleaned before cooking. The blood near the backbone must all be removed, and the yellow part near the head ; it has a bitter flavour. The black skin from the inside of cod, haddock, and other fish can be removed by rubbing with salt. It must not be left in water to soak, as it destroys the flavour and makes the fish sodden. The fins and tails should be trimmed off, except the fins of turbot, which are considered a delicacy. White fish is the lightest and most digestible for invalids, especially whiting, soles, and plaice; in these the fibre is very tender. Oily fish, such as salmon, herrings, and mackerel, contain more nourishment, but are more difficult to digest. 2—220 KING EDWARD’S COOKERY BOOK Fish is highly nitrogenous, and a good brain food. It con- tains a much higher percentage of water than butcher’s meat, and is therefore not such a highly concentrated food. Notes and Rules for baking Fisn. This is one of the nicest ways of cooking fish, as none of the flavour is lost and it is neither rich nor watery. The fish may be first seasoned, coated with egg and crumbs, and baked to resemble fried fish. Or placed on a well-buttered tin, seasoned and covered closely with buttered paper, and baked to resemble steamed or boiled fish. A more delicate way is to place the fish between two buttered plates. Rules.—1. Crumbs to be freshly made, and browned in the oven before using. 2. Well wash and dry the fish. 3. Do not overcook. It can be tested by piercing with a skewer. Rules for boiling Fish. 1. Well clean the fish and weigh it. 2. Have only just enough hot water to cover it. 3. Allow 2 oz. salt and 2 tablespoonfuls vinegar to every gallon of water. 4. Skim well. 5. Cook very gently until tender. 6. Allow six minutes to the pound for cod, haddock, hake, etc., and ten minutes for very large cod, salmon, turbot or halibut. Small fish, such as whiting, from six to ten minutes. 7. Put all fish, except salmon, into hot water, as boiling would crack the skin, and cold would draw the goodness out. Salmon must be put into boiling water to preserve its colour. 8. Drain well and place on a hot dish on a d’oyley with a strainer underneath; garnish with parsley and lemon, and serve with a suitable sauce. Steaming is a better way of cooking fish; it loses less of its flavour and nourishment.21 FISH For Frying.—Sec notes and rules at the beginning of Meat section (p. 45). Boiled Cod. 4 lb. cod.

Boiling is one of the easiest ways of cooking, and the secret of success is in allowing plenty of time and cooking very slowly. Meat should be fresh. Very fat joints are unsuitable for boiling. The best joints are generally reserved for roasting, while the more gelatinous and sinewy parts are used for boiling. The moist heat softens, and to a great extent dissolves, the gelatine, which dry heat would render hard and indigestible. Our object is to soften the fibres while retaining all the juices. When meat is put into boiling water, the sudden change to a paler colour shows that the albumen on the sur- face has coagulated. In this way the outside of the meat is hardened, thus preventing the escape of the red juices. If cooked at 212° F. (boiling-point) the whole of the albumen in the meat would become hard and leathery, rendering the meat very tough. This is why it is necessary to cook at a lower temperature after the meat is once hardened on the out- side. Five minutes is long enough to accomplish this hardening process. After that it should be kept at a temperature of 180° to 200° F., which is known as simmering-point. In simmering, the water should barely move at one side of the saucepan, and not gently bubble all over, as this would register 212°, as in more violent bubbling. There is no better way of showing the reason for this than to take an egg and44 KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK see the difference between the tenderness of it when cooked at the different temperatures. Note.—Poultry-should be put into hot, not boiling, water, the fibres, being more delicate than in meat, are easily hardened. The rules for boiling salted or pickled meat and fish will be found under their respective headings. Rules for boiling Fresh Meat. 1. Wipe the meat with a damp cloth. If a neck or loin, see that it is well jointed. 2. Weigh it, and allow for beef and mutton a quarter of an hour to the pound, and a quarter of an hour over; for veal and lamb twenty minutes to the pound, and twenty minutes over; for pork twenty-five minutes to the pound, and twenty- five minutes over. For thin joints, such as neck of mutton, breast of veal, etc., this rule will not apply, as the thick- ness does not increase proportionally with the weight. Allow from two to two and a half hours for any weight over a pound. 3. Put the meat into boiling water with a teaspoonful of salt to every quart. 4. Bring to boiling-point and skim well. 5. Boil for five minutes — this is to harden the outside and keep in the goodness; then add a little cold water, and draw the saucepan to the side of the fire; simmer very gently till done. This is to prevent the albumen or fibrin from hardening. 6. When possible, cook meat in stock. It improves the flavour and enriches the stock. Keep the lid on the sauce- pan. 7. After skimming add vegetables, which are served with the meat. 8. Coat the meat 'with sauce before serving, and garnish with the vegetables.45 MEAT Rules for boiling Salt Meat. 1. Salted or pickled meat should be washed before cooking. 2. Allow twenty minutes to the pound, and twenty minutes over for any weight up to 8 or 9 lbs. For larger pieces quarter of an hour to the pound will be found sufficient. 3. Put into warm water. 4. Bring to boiling-point and skim well. 5. Boil for five minutes—this is to harden the outside and keep in the goodness; then add a little cold water and draw the saucepan to the side of the fire, and cook very gently until done. This is to prevent the albumen and fibrin from hardening. 6. After skimming add the vegetables, which are served with the meat. 7. If to be served cold, take out the meat when cooked, put into a pan, and pour over the liquor, leave till nearly cold, then lift on to a dish, and when quite cold glaze. 8. If the liquor is wanted for stock, change the water after the meat has cooked one hour. This prevents the stock from being too salt. In this case the vegetables should not be added till the water has been changed. Notes and Rules on Frying. Frying is cooking in hot fat. There are two ways of frying, called ‘ shallow frying ’ and ‘ deep frying.’ In shallow frying you use a frying-pan and very little fat. This method is suitable for sausages, pancakes, and meats. In deep frying you use a stewpan, and for small things a wire basket will be found a great convenience for lifting them in and out of the fat. Sufficient fat must be used to well cover whatever you are frying. This method is used for croquettes, fish, fritters, etc., and these things must be dished quickly and lightly, or they soon lose their crispness. The inside should be soft and lightly cooked, and the outside a golden brown colour. Oil, lard, or clarified fat may be used,46 KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK and this method of frying is not as extravagant as it appears, for the same fat can he used again and again if care be taken not to let it burn. Success depends largely upon the temperature being right. If there is any water in the fat, it will begin to bubble directly it reaches 212°. After a time the bubbling ceases, and as the fat reaches a higher temperature a faint blue smoke wiil be seen rising from it. Soon after this the fat begins to smoke a little, and is ready for use. If left on the fire without using it will burn. If in doubt as to the temperature, test by’ throwing in a small piece of white bread. If it browns quickly the fat is ready. It is dangerous to leave the fat on an open fire unless there are bars for the pan to rest upon. Rules for Frying. 1. Have everything as dry as possible, and coated with flour, batter, or egg and crumbs. 2. Have the fat smoking hot—about 3-85° F. 3. Drain everything on paper after frying to absorb the fat. 4. After using deep fat, allow it to cool before straining for future use, or the great heat will melt the strainer. 5. Keep the fat used for frying fish for that only. To Egg and Crumb.—Beat up the egg in a soup plate, put the breadcrumbs on a piece of paper. Use a small brush for the egg, and be careful to brush well all over, or the crumbs will not stick. Lift out of the egg with a knife into the middle of the crumbs, and move the paper from side to side until the fish or meat is coated. When the egging and crumbing arc finished, wipe the knife, and use it to press the crumbs on firmly to prevent any loose ones from falling into the fat. To fry Parsley.—Choose fresh parsley, wash it, and put in on a sieve to dry ; then put it in a frying-basket. Allow the fat to cool after frjdng the meat, fish, etc., then put in the parsley, and fry until crisp. Do not let it get brown. Drain on paper.MEAT 47 Notes and Rules on Grilling. Grilling is a very convenient way of cooking, it is so quickly done. It is very wholesome and savoury. It is only suitable for small pieces of meat or fish. Only the tender parts of meat should be used, and they must not be too thin. Oily fish are better than white fish for grilling. Double grid- irons are very convenient, especially for fish, which is often difficult to turn without breaking. Avoid sticking a fork or skewer into the meat when turning, as this allows the juices to escape. It is best to use two spoons, or a knife and spoon, or small tongs, for turning when you are using a single gridiron. The time for cooking depends on the thickness of the meat. A well-grilled chop or steak should be tender and juicy. Tildes for Grilling. 1. Have a good clear fire, free from smoke. 2. Trim off a little of the fat, sprinkle the meat with pepper, and brush over the lean with butter. White fish should be well brushed with butter and sprinkled with pepper. Oily fish, such as herrings, do not require butter. 3. Before beginning to cook, let the gridiron get hot; then rub the bars with a piece of suet to prevent the meat from sticking. 4. If there is any choice, put the cut surface towards the fire first—e.g., kidneys. 5. Turn the meat continually. 6. Send to the table as soon as cooked. Notes and Rules on Roasting. Roasting is nicest when done in front of the fire; it is a very savoury way of cooking meat. Only the best joints are. suitable, and they should be well hung; the fibres will then be more tender.KING EDWARD'S COOKERY ROOK 4S For small joints, or birds, a Dutch oven may be used, placing it on a trivet which has been hung on the bars. The meat must be kept well basted and turned, and the thickest part of the joint should be hung downwards, as the greatest heat comes from the bottom of the fire. For large joints a jack must be used. This saves turning, for when the jack is wound up the meat is kept revolving. A meat-screen is of great service in retaining and reflecting the heat. In these days it is more usual to roast meat in the oven. Great care must be taken that the oven is perfectly clean and well ventilated. A double meat-tin should be used, so that water can be placed in the under tin. This will prevent the dripping from browning, and giving a disagreeable flavour to the meat. A well-roasted joint should be brown and crisp on the outside, while the inside should be tender and retain all its juices. Hides for Roasting. 1. Choose the best joints, tender, fat, and well hung. 2. Have a bright, clear fire. 3. Weigh the meat, and allow for beef and mutton a quarter of an hour to the pound, and a quarter of an hour over; for veal and lamb twenty minutes to the pound, and twenty minutes over; for pork twenty-five minutes to the pound, and twenty-five minutes over. Boned and stuffed meats require a longer time to cook than plain joints. 4. See that the meat is well jointed. 5. Wipe the meat with a damp cloth, and fasten into shape with string. Never use skewers. 6. Hang the thickest part of the joint downwards, the greatest heat being at the bottom of the fire. 7. If meat has been frozen, bring it into the kitchen several hours before cooking, as it should be thawed slowly. 8. Put meat near to the fire at first to close the pores and keep in the juice; then cook more slowly till tender.49 MEAT 9. Baste the joint often; it prevents the meat from burning and from shrinking so much. 10. Serve with good gravy made in the tin in which the meat was cooked, first pouring off the dripping. 11. Use stock that has been seasoned with pepper and salt only, and made with mutton or beef bones or trimmings according to the joint. 12. When roasting a leg or shoulder of mutton, the shank or shoulder should bo used for making the stock. Notes and Rules on Steaming and Braising. Steaming and braising are modes of cooking by steam. It is a most perfect way of cooking, as there is no danger of hardening the meat by too high a temperature. A proper steaming apparatus consists of two vessels, one of which fits into the top of the other and is perforated at the bottom. The under one is for the water, the upper one for the meat, which is cooked by the steam passing up through the holes. It is quite possible to carry out this mode of cooking by using an ordinary saucepan, and supporting the joint on jam- jars to prevent it from coming in contact with the water. The lid must be fixed on tightly to prevent loss of steam. In braising, the meal 'is resting on a bed of vegetables which is covered with stock. This is more savoury than simply steaming, as the meat imbibes the flavour of the vegetables. It is a favourite way of cooking boned and stuffed joints and birds. In a proper braising-pan the lid is indented for the purpose of holding live charcoal, so that the meat is partly roasted while steaming. Much the same result is attained by browning the meat in the oven after it is taken out of the saucepan, and basting with its own liquor. Rules for Steaming and Braising. 1. Choose lean joints. 2. Allow fifteen minutes to the pound, and thirty minutes over, for beef and mutton; allow twenty minutes to the 4So KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK pound, and thirty minutes over, for veal and lamb; allow thirty minutes to the pound, and thirty minutes over, for pork. 3. In steaming, put the meat in the steamer, fill the under vessel with boiling water, and keep it boiling all the time the meat is cooking 4. In braising, make a bed of vegetables, cover with stock, rest the meat on the top, and cover it with buttered paper. 5. Keep the lid tightly on. Notes and Rules on Stewing. Stewing is cooking very slowly in a small quantity of liquid. By this method the toughest meats may be rendered tender and digestible, and also very savoury. The secret is long, slow cooking. The process is sometimes confused with boiling, but it is almost the reverse. In boiling we aim at softening the meat while retaining all its juices, and the hot water acts merely as a medium for conveying the heat. In stewing the juices are more or less extracted, and form with the water the liquid in which the meat is softened, and the gravy with which it is served. The meat, being partly cooked in its own juices, is more savoury. In boiling we plunge the meat into boiling water to close up the pores and keep in the juices. In stewing we use cold or warm liquid, in order to draw out some of the juices before sealing up the pores. In many cases the meat is lightly fried before stewing; this prevents the loss of so much of the red juice when put into the warm water, it also makes the stew more savoury and a better colour. In some cases the separation of the juices is the sole object, as in beef-tea, soups and stocks. The meat is finely cut up, in order to expose more of its surface to the water. It is then put into cold water, and brought very slowly to boiling-point, and stewed until all the juices are extracted ; in this case the meat is of no value.MEAT 5» The juices of meat contain a large amount of albumen. Albumen is soluble in cold water, but coagulates in hot water. It is possible to extract the juices from meat without cooking by mincing the meat finely and soaking it in cold water for one or two hours. Rules for Stews. 1. Use warm liquid. 2. Allow f pint of liquid to every pound of meat, and 1 oz. of thickening to every pint of liquid. 3. Keep the stewpan closely covered. 4. Simmer very gently. Rules for beef-tea and stock will be found elsewhere. Notes on Mutton Cutlets and Small Meat Dishes. Choose the best end of the neck, do not have it chopped, but have the chine-bone sawn off, so that the cutlets can be easily divided; and if the bones measure more than 4£ inches, saw a piece off the other side to make them the right length. It is best to get very small mutton, as there will be less fat. Divide the cutlets evenly, trim off most of the fat, and scrape an inch of the meat from the end of each cutlet bone. Frills can be put on just before serving if liked. If nicely trimmed, they will make a dainty entree. They can be fried, braised, or sauted, and served with various sauces and vegetables. For a cold entree, after cooking they may be set in aspic jelly, then cut out and served with a salad and chopped jelly, or braised and coated with chaudfroid sauce or tomato sauce in which a little aspic jelly or gelatine has been mixed to enable it to set. The whole of the ncclc of small mutton or lamb will be found an economical and useful joint from which to get a variety of dishes. E.g., the best end is suitable for cutlets or roasting; the middle for boiling, stewing, or haricot mutton; while the scrag end can be used for an Irish stew or Scotch broth.KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK 52 The sirloin of beef (a small piece), with the undercut or fillet, may be used as follows : The undercut or fillet removed, and either braised or cut into fillets and made into an entree, as directed in ‘ Fillets of Beef.’ The rest of the joint may be roasted as it is, or boned and rolled, and some good soup made with the bones; or the thin end of the meat may be cut off and stewed (if not too fat), or pickled and boiled for a cold luncheon dish. The ribs or chine of beef is a cheaper joint, and though it has not such a fine flavour as sirloin, it is suitable for many dishes. A joint of three or four pounds may be used as follows : Cut off a thick slice, spread with veal stuffing, and roast; serve with brown sauce. Another portion of it may be used for a pie or pudding, using a little kidney with it, while the rest can be either stewed, jugged, or used for beef olives, or minced and made into a dish of ‘ Fillets of Beef with Kidney Beans.’ Boiled Beef (served Cold). 10 lb. rump of beef (pickled). 1 carrot. 1 turnip. 1 onion. 1 bunch of herbs. 2 allspice. 2 cloves. 20 peppercorns. 1J oz. gelatine.

J teaspoonful salt. 2 teaspoon fuls water. A little milk. Pastry : J lb. flour. 1 teaspoon ful baking-powder. Pinch of salt. 3 oz. clarified fat. I gill water (nearly). (Enough for 7 or 8 pasties.)62 KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK delicious dish than is possible by using dry curry-powder, They can be made either of meat, fish, vegetables, or hard- boiled eggs. It is also a good way of using up cooked meat, but fresh meat is preferable. The meat should be cut into small squares, poultry into small joints. For white curry use white meat, such as veal, chicken, or rabbit, with almond or cocoanut milk, or cream, to keep it a pale colour, the onions and meat being sautdd, not fried. For brown curries fry the onions and meat, and use brown stock. After the meat is sautdd, or fried, the flour, curry- powder, paste, and chutney are mixed together and sprinkled over the meat. The lid is put on the saucepan, which is moved slowly backwards and forwards over the fire to keep the contents from burning whilst the flavour is being absorbed by the meat. Lemon-juice is added to keep it a good colour, and a small quantity of acid fruit. The acid acts on the fibres of the meat, rendering it more tender. A tomato improves the flavour of a cold meat curry. Curries require long, slow cooking, that all the flavours may he well blended. After the„ curry is all prepared, put it into an earthenware jar, casserole or gourmand, and place it on the top of the stove or in the oven, that it may cook gently without the risk of burning. Boiled rice is always served with a curry, cither handed separately on a folded napkin or forming a border round the dish on which the curry is served. It is essential to use good curry-powder. Yeerasawmy’s curry-powder, paste and chutney will be found excellent. FmIcs for Curries. 1. Chop the onions finely. 2. Fry the onions in butter for a brown curry. Saute them for a white curry. 3.

Add the ham cut into strips, and the quenelles (which should be made very small, with teaspoons instead of dessert-spoons). Put the mixture into the case, replace the top, and serve. Make the case as for oyster patties, only using a large cutter.CHAPTER IY COLD MEAT COOKERY In this section will be found many excellent ways of using up cold meat and producing very savoury dishes. As warmed-up meat has less flavour than freshly-cooked meat, good gravy or stock should be used, and special care taken in seasoning. There is often some jellied gravy under the dripping, which is the essence of meat, and may be used to advantage. Trimmings of game, poultry, pickled beef, ham and tongue will also assist. Herbs, essence of ai cho /y, and mace may be used in small quantities. Uncooked flavourings, such as onion, tomato, and mush- rooms, must be cooked before mixing with the meat. The most important point to remember is that the meat is already cooked, and only needs rewarming. Underdone meat is preferable for cold meat cookery. For Scotch eggs, rissoles, croquettes and minces the meat is passed through a mincing-machine or chopped very finely, and then mixed with a sauce made of butter, flour and stock, or good gravy. This sauce must be well cooked before adding it to the meat. Rissoles and croquettes should be moist and creamy inside, to effect which it is necessary to add enough sauce to make the mixture to the right consistency while hot, then to allow it to cool, when it will become firm enough to shape. On reheating the sauce is liquefied, producing the creaminess we desire. 6-284 KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK For a hash the meat should he added to the sauce an hour or more before serving, in order that it may become well flavoured and softened, taking care it does not boil. It is safer to use a double saucepan or bain-marie, or stew-jar placed in boiling water. Poached eggs are a nice garnish for minces, especially those made of veal. Boi'ders of rice and macaroni may also be used. Rules for warming up Cooked Meat 1. Trim away any gristle and most of the fat. 2. Use good gravy or stock. 3. Season well. 4. Cook raw vegetables, such as onion, mushroom, etc., in a little butter before adding them to the meat. 5. Only reheat the meat; do not cook it again. 6. For a hash, mince, or curry use a double saucepan or bain-marie after the meat is added, and let it remain in the sauce for an hour or so before serving. 7. For croquettes, etc., put the meat mixture on to a plate, make it into a flat cake, and leave until cold, then divide into equal portions and shape. 8. When vermicelli is used for coating, crush it finely. 9. For a mince, chop the meat in preference to passing it through a mincing-machine. To egg and crumb, see ‘Rules on Frying,’ also ‘How to fry Parsley.’ Foundation Sauce for Cold Meat Cookery. Flavouring of onion, shallot, mushroom, etc. Butter. Flour. Stock or good gravy.

The following is a list of those most used, and the dates when in season: In season. Blackcock ... ... August 20 till December 10. Grouse ... August 12 till December 10. Hares ... October to March. Larks ... November till February. Partridges ... ... September 1 to February 1. Pheasants ... ... October 1 to February 1. Plovers November till March. Pigeons ... All the year round. Ptarmigan ... ... November till March. Quails ... March to October. Snipe ... November till March. Teal ... September to February. Venison : Buck venison ... Juno to September. Doe venison ... October to December. Wild duck ... ... September to February. Widgeon ... August to March. Woodcock ... ... November till March. Game should be hung in a cool, dry place. It is hung for some time to make it.ripe, or ‘high,’ but should never have an unpleasant smell. Water-fowl, such as wild duck, teal, widgeon, etc., should not hang more than a day. 7KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK 9S 'When the breast feathers come out easily it is a sign that the bird is ready for plucking. For pheasants, another test is when the blood drops from the beak. Pheasants hang longer than partridges. Both require to be well cooked. Game, as a rule, should be slightly underdone. Wild duck is always served either with an orange or lemon salad, or with some accompaniment having orange or lemon as the characteristic flavour. A salad is usually served with game. Cranberry sauce or cranberry jelly is frequently served. The four usual adjuncts for game are : a good brown gravy, bread sauce, fried crumbs, potato chips, watercress being used as a garnish. Woodcock are never drawn, for the trail is considered a delicacy by gourmets. To tell when Birds are Young. Grouse, partridges, snipe, quails, and ortolans, when young have short round spurs. Old grouse and partridges have yello-w legs and dark bills. They are not good for roasting, but may be used for salmis, etc. AVoodcock when old have pointed spurs, and the feet hard and thick ; when young their spurs are blunt. AVhen the bills look soft and unsightly, and the throat muddy, it is always a sign that the birds have been killed long. In venison, when young, the fat is clear and bright. If hares have sharp claws, cars damp, and the cleft in the lip narrow, it is a sign that they are young. Notes on Poultry Drawing and Trussing. Poultry should be fresh ; it is spoilt if the least high. A turkey may be hung for several days in a cold dry place, and in cold weather will keep for a week or ten days.99 POULTRY AND GAME Poultry should never be served underdone, hut he well cooked. It requires more cooking than game in proportion to its size. Avery large fowl will take quite two hours if cooked slowly, a good-sized fowl an hour and a half, a medium size from one to one and a quarter hours, a spring chicken from forty to fifty minutes. If young and tender, the skin of the breast will look fine and transparent, and the bone will bend easily. A good test is to pierce the flesh with a pin; it should go in quite easily. The claws should bend without cracking, and the legs should be smooth. Choose dark legs for roasting, and white ones for boiling. The weight should be great in proportion to the size. Fowls are in season all the year round, also chickens, spring chickens in April, May, and part of June. The price varies from 2s. 6d. to 4s., according to size and season. An old fowl is good for broth. It is also very good if it is steamed for three or four hours, and then roasted and well basted. To prepare Fowls for Cooking. After removing the feathers, singe off the hairs that remain with a lighted taper, wipe with a damp cloth, turn the bird on to its breast, make a slit between the shoulders, and with your fingers loosen the skin all round the neck until it is quite free; then cut it off close to the body. Now cut the skin of the neck, leaving quite 2 inches hanging to the body. Remove the crop (a bag of skin in front of neck), put in your first finger, and work it gradually round inside the bird, keeping near to the carcass, and loosen all the ligaments you come across. Now make a small slit at the other end by the side of the leg, put in your finger, and loosen in the same way. Take hold of the gizzard and pull. If you have broken all the ligaments properly, the whole of the inside will come out with the gizzard. Wipe out the bird with a damp cloth, and rub in some salt and lemon. Remove the gall-bag from the liver, pull the neck from the head. Cut the skin of the 7—2KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK 100 gizzard through the fleshy part, and peel it off; in the middle is a hag full of stones. You must be careful not to cut into this, or it will be more difficult to remove. Wash the giblets well in warm water. Truss the bird into shape. For roasting, the legs are chopped off near the thighs. Draw out the sinews, twist the pinions backwards so that the tips are under the body, force the legs well down and into the sides so that it will stand firmly on the dish. Run the needle through the second wing-joint into the upper joint of leg, through the body, and turn the fowl on its breast. Fold over the loose piece of skin at the back, pass the needle through the top of the wing, through the back, catching up the piece of skin, and out through the top of opposite wing, draw tightly, and tie. At the other end, run the needle into the back, press the legs closely together, take a stitch through, passing the string over each leg and out at the back. For boiling, cut the legs off at the first joint. Put your fingers in at the lower slit by the leg, and loosen the skin all round the legs, taking care not to break it. Press the leg from you with your thumb, and draw the skin towards you at the same time with your other hand, so that the legs can be slipped underneath and inside the body. Now pass a trussing- needle and string through the end of the back, over the legs, and out through the back. Tie the ends tightly together— this will keep the legs well down inside the body—bend the tail upwards, draw the skin over, and tic securely with string. Turkeys are trussed in the same way as fowls. How to bone a Fowl. The fowl should not be drawn. Singe and wipe it with a damp cloth, make a slit in the skin at the back of the neck, loosen it round as far down as possible, and cut off the neck. Sever the tendons that connect the wings, and scrape off the flesh close to the bones. Next remove the merry-thought,POULTRY AND GAME ICI and with the fingers loosen the flesh round the carcass until you come to the leg-joints. Disjoint them, and loosen the rest of the flesh until it is all free from the carcass. Now remove the bones from the legs and wings.

Choose freshly gathered vegetables. 2. Wash well; cut leeks down one side, so that all grit can be easily removed. Soak cauliflowers and cabbages in salt and water to draw out the insects, cut across the stalks several times. Wash spinach in several waters—it is apt to be very gritty—remove the stalk and mid-rib from each leaf. Brush celery well, scrape the stalks of asparagus, and trim them evenly. Wash kidney beans well before cutting them up. 3. Burn all parings and waste vegetable matter if possible; they quickly decay, and the gases given off are very poisonous. The water in which they are boiled should not be poured down the sink while it is hot. 4. Cook in plenty of boiling water with 1 oz. of salt to each gallon of water, and if the water is very hard a small piece of soda should be added. Exception : spinach, which is cooked without any soda, and only enough water to cover. It is very watery, and is often cooked in its own juices only, but is then rather dark in colour. Peas should have a little sugar and mint boiled with them, but no soda. Cabbages are more wholesome if blanched before cooking. 5. Put into boiling water, and cook with the lid off. G. Bring to boiling-point as quickly as possible after they arc put into the saucepan, and keep the water boiling fast. Skim well. Peas should be boiled slowly. 7. Try with a skewer or trussing needle to see if they are tender.KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK 118 8. Drain well. Cabbages and greens must be well pressed after draining. Cut them across before serving. 9. Serve as quickly as possible after they are cooked. Rules for Roots and Tubers. 1. Wash well, and prepare according to the vegetable. Potatoes should be scraped or peeled very thinly unless cooked in their skins ; carrots should be scraped, turnips peeled thickly, onions skinned and blanched before cooking; parsnips scrubbed and cooked in their skins, removing them just before serving, and cutting the parsnips in quarters lengthways. 2. Put roots and tubers into boiling water, except old potatoes, which are put into cold. 3. Cook gently with the lid on. Skim well. 4. Try with a skewer or needle to see if cooked. 5. Potatoes should never be cut through. Young potatoes may have a little mint boiled with them. Globe Artichokes (Boiled). 4 or 5 artichokes. £ pint Hollandaise sauce (see p. 149).

It differs from a gravy in that a gravy is transparent, and osmazome forms its characteristic flavour. The art of sauce-making consists in preparing liquids from the various ingredients employed, and cleverly blending the various flavours. Sauces may be divided into two kinds, viz. : a. Plain sauces, or those which are quickly prepared. b. Rich sauces, or those which require much preparation. Sauces are thickened by means of a liaison, which is a thickening or binding. Liaisons may be of several kinds: 1. Roux, which may be white, fawn or brown. 2. Egg liaisons, consisting of yolks of eggs and cream. 3. Butter and cream. 4. Farinaceous products, as flour, cornflour, etc. Sauces should be cooked for some time, so as to extract the flavour of the different ingredients. Overcooking, however, renders a sauce oily, but if a teaspoonful of cold water is added its original consistency will be restored. When adding hot liquid to a sauce use a whisk, and so avoid the formation of lumps.SAUCES, FORCEMEATS, AND FLAVOURING BUTTERS 147 Espagnole and bechamel sauce arc known as foundation sauces. From espagnole we derive the brown sauces, and from bechamel the white sauces. Composition of Sauces. Fats. Thickening. Liquids. Flavouring. Season ing. Clarified fat. Dripping. Lard. Oil. Butter.

Salt. Peppers. Cayenne. Sugar. Mustard. Spices. A mirepoix is a flavouring consisting of ham or bacon, vegetables, thyme, and bay-leaves. If required for a brown sauce, it is browned. A bouquet garni consists of a few sprigs of parsley, sprig of thyme and marjoram, a bay-leaf, two cloves, a spring onion, and a strip of lemon-rind. Flavouring butters take their name from their characteristic ingredient, as horseradish butter, coral butter, etc. They are much used for sauces, and will keep for some time if put into a small jar and covered over. Plain sauces are nearly all made from the same foundation, a simple white sauce. This sauce, with the addition of essence of anchovy, a few shrimps, a hard-boiled egg, or sugar, at once becomes anchovy, shrimp, egg or sweet sauce. The sauce should be gently reheated after these additions till the added matter is warmed through. If cream is used it should be added at the very last, just before serving. Thus, when the art of making the foundation is thoroughly understood a variety of sauces can be easily made. 10—2148 KING EDWARD’S COOKERY BOOK Flavouring butters are added to sauces by whisking in a little at a time after the sauce is made. This restores to the sauce the flavour of butter that it would lose during long cooking. If added too quickly the sauce will become oily- looking, and whilst the butter is being added the saucepan should be lifted from the fire. Sauces may be strained through a fine strainer, or by means of a tammy cloth. Tammy cloth costs about 2s. per yard, and one cloth will last for a considerable time. A sauce that has been tammied is of a much smoother con- sistency ; it is also a less wasteful method. To reduce a sauce, allow it to boil quickly with the lid off the saucepan.

When cooked they should be of a pale- brown colour on the outside, and of a soft creamy consistency inside. The pan used for omelets should be of tinned iron or copper, and be kept for omelets only. The preparation of the pan is of the greatest importance It should not be washed, but cleaned by putting in a handful of salt, and placing the pan over the fire for a few minutes, until the salt begins to burn, then throwing it away and rubbing the pan with soft paper until it is bright. For savoury omelets a shallot cut in half and rubbed over the pan will give a delicious flavour. Directly the mixture is poured into the pan it should be stirred until it begins to set, when great care must be taken that it is folded and served before the eggs become overcooked. A few seconds too long will render the omelet tough and leathery. Savoury omelets are often served with a sauce. They are never served on a dish paper. Souffle omelets (sweet) may be. Omelets require practice, as it is only by observation and dexterity that one can become proficient in the making of them.161 OMELETS AND SOUFFLES Buies. 1. Do not wash the pan, but clean it with salt. 2. Mix the eggs well with a fork, but do not beat them, except when the yolk and whites are separated, as for sweet omelets, when it is necessary to beat both yolks and whites thoroughly. 3. Let the butter get hot before pouring in the mixture. 4. Stir until the mixture begins to set, then fold. 5. Serve a savoury omelet on a hot dish, with or without sauce, as preferred. Serve a sweet omelet on a dish paper. 6. Serve all omelets directly they are made. Notes on Souffles. A souffle is a light, spongy pudding, consisting of a foundation sauce made of butter, flour, and milk or stock, lightened with the whipped whites of eggs. It can be either baked or steamed, and may be savoury or sweet. Care must be taken not to use too much flour, or it will be too firm. Biscuit flour is generally used, being more starchy, but a small quantity of cornflour added to ordinary flour will answer the same purpose. It must be cooked slowly and steadily, as it is apt to fall when cooked quickly. It should be served directly it is firm enough to turn out, as beyond this point it shrinks and becomes tough and leathery. Buies. 1. Well butter the tin, and use clarified butter. 2. Tie a band of stiff paper round the top of the tin to come about 4 inches above. When baking souffles in small cases, butter them, and tie a band of stiff paper round to come about 1 inch above the case. 3. Cook the sauce or panada thoroughly. 4. Beat well after adding each yolk of egg. 5. Whisk the whites stiffly and mix them in at the last. 6. If the souffle is to be steamed, cover it with a piece of buttered paper. 11KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK 162 7. Cook slowly and steadily. 8. Serve a baked souffle in the tin in which it is baked. Remove the paper, and wrap a dainty dish paper or folded d’oyley round the tin. Serve without sauce. 9. Turn a steamed souffle out, and pour the sauce round, if a syrup sauce. A custard sauce may be poured over if preferred. OMELETS. Kidney Omelet. 1 kidney. 1J oz. butter. 1 shallot (chopped). Salt, pepper, and cayenne. 4 eggs. 1 tcaspoonful chopped parsley.

When-steaming, only enough to come half-way up the sides of the basin. In the case of a proper steamer being used, nearly fill the under vessel. 2. Steaming is suitable for very light mixtures, and when the basin or mould is not quite full. 3. Allow longer for steaming than for boiling, and be careful the saucepan does not boil dry. 4. Puddings containing a large quantity of suet require a long time to cook, and in most cases it is more satisfactory to boil them. 5. Breadcrumbs mixed with the flour help to make the pudding lighter. 6. When baking-powder is used less suet is required to lighten the pudding. 7. .Use from 6 to 12 oz. suet to 1 lb. of flour. 8. Well butter the pudding-basin. For a boiled pudding cover the pudding with a piece of buttered paper before tying on the cloth. For a steamed pudding cover with buttered paper only. 9. For rich Christmas puddings, after covering with paper put over a paste of flour and water, then tie over the cloth When cooked remove the cloth and paste without disturbingKING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK i£8 the grease-proof paper. Tie a clean cloth over, or cover with brown paper. 10. When only a cloth is used it must be well floured. The pudding mixture must then be made into a good shape, and tied up firmly in the cloth. When a pudding is cooked in this way a plate should be put into the saucepan to prevent the cloth from sticking to the bottom. 11. Put the pudding into boiling water, and keep it boiling all the time. 12. Fill up the saucepan from time to time with boiling water. 13. Serve with a suitable sauce or custard.

Pules for Milk Puddings. 1. Use very fresh eggs and milk. In warm weather a pinch of carbonate of soda will prevent the milk from curdling. 2. If skim milk is used a little butter should be added to supply the loss of cream. 3. Be careful to use very clean saucepans, moulds, pic-dishes, etc., and see that the oven is quite clean, as milk quickly absorbs any flavour. 4. Always add a little salt. 5. Essences used as flavourings, such as vanilla or almonds, should, where possible, be added after the pudding is cooked. 6. For baked puddings, to every pint of milk allow 2 oz. rice, sago, tapioca, macaroni, semolina, etc. For a mould or shape allow 3 oz. if serving cold, and 4 oz. when hot.PUDDINGS AND SWEETS 175 7. Of cornflour, farola, wheat crystals, or any of the pre- parations specially prepared for moulds, allow 2 oz. to every pint. 8. The moulds must be well scalded, rinsed in cold water, and left wet for cold puddings, but buttered for hot. 9. Macaroni, and tapioca, should be soaked in milk for two or three hours before using. Bice also is the better for being first soaked. 10. All starchy foods require to be well cooked. 11. Eggs require very light, slow cooking; therefore they should be added if possible after the cereal is cooked, just before finishing the pudding. 12. The dishes in which milk puddings are baked should be placed in a tin containing a little water. This will help to prevent the pudding from burning or boiling over. The dish must not be filled too full. 13. For a baked custard the pie-dish should be lined with pastry to absorb the moisture. Never move a custard while baking. 14. If using an ordinary saucepan for steaming a custard a folded paper placed in the bottom of the saucepan will reduce the heat somewhat, and the custard will not be so liable to curdle. Notes and Eules on Batter. Batter comes from the word battre, ‘to beat,’ thus implying that all batter has to be well beaten. It is composed chiefly of flour, eggs, and milk. A frying batter is rather thick, and is used for coating fish, meat, fruit, and vegetables. Beaten up white of egg is added to lighten it and make it very crisp. Frying batter for fish is improved by the addition of lemon- juice. Batter should not be fried at such a high temperature as rissoles or croquettes. Very cleana ft should be used, and not any that has beenKING EDWARD’S COOKERY BOOK 176 discoloured by much using, or the colour of the fritters will be spoilt. Batter should be left to stand for a few hours before using; this makes it lighter. The batler used for pancakes is much thinner than frying batter and made rather differently. This is also used for Yorkshire pudding, steamed batter pudding, toad in the hole, etc. Rules for Pancake Batter, etc. 1. Sift the flour and add a pinch of salt. 2. Make a hole in the middle of the flour, add the eggs and half of the milk, gradually mixing in the flour. 3. Beat well with a wooden spoon for ten minutes, add the rest of the milk. 4. Leave to stand for a few hours. 5. Serve as soon as cooked. Rules for Frying Batter. 1. Sift the flour and add a pinch of salt. 2. Make a hole in the middle, add the oil or butter (melted) and the tepid water gradually. 3. Beat well for ten minutes. 4. Leave it to stand for half an hour or longer. 5. Stir in the whisked whites lightly. Cornflour Mould. 2 oz. cornflour. Flavouring. Pinch of salt. oz. sugar. 1 pint milk. (Enough for 5 or 6 persons.)

Fru#t creams, consisting of cream and a puree of fruit. 3. Custard creams, made of custard and cream. In each case the cream is whipped first. There is no diffi- culty in doing this in the winter, providing the cream is thick, but in hot summer weather it is apt to become buttery. It should be whipped in a cold place, and not too quickly. Use only enough gelatine to insure the cream turning out. Whole creams will set with less gelatine than fruit or custard creams. They should not be turned out of the moulds until they are wanted. Put them in a very cold place—on ice if possible. They are easier to turn out if the moulds are masked with clear jelly. This can be set with some suitable decoration, such as gold-leaf, fruit, or nuts. To mask a mould, stand it on icc, pour in enough jelly to cover the bottom; when set pour in a little more, and turn the mould slowly round and round on the icc until the sides are coated. Arrange the decoration tastefully, and set it with more jelly. Tinned copper moulds will be found best for moulding jellies and creams. They are easier to unmould than china ones. Rules. 1. Use double cream (i.e., cream that has stood on the milk for twenty-four hours), unless separated by machinery. 2. Mask the mould with clear jelly, and set it with some suitable decoration. If gold or silver leaf is used it must be mixed with a little jelly. 3. Whisk the cream in a cold place until it clings to the whisk. 4. For fruit creams rub the fruit through a hair sieve with the sugar. Some fruit requires stewing first. 5. Use very little gelatine—about 1, oz. to a pint in the summer, and less in the winter.207 PUDDINGS AND SWEETS 6. Dissolve the gelatine in water, using 1 gill to 1 oz. of gelatine. It must be only lukewarm when added, or the heat will destroy the lightness of the cream. If too cold it will not mix properly, and the cream will be rough and lumpy. For a custard cream dissolve the gelatine in the custard. 7. Pour the mixture into the mould as soon as the gelatine is properly mixed in, and before it begins to set, or the cream will be rough and lumpy. 8. To unmould dip the mould in warm water and turn on to a cold dish. I. Whole Creams. For Chocolate. 1 bar Menier chocolate (dissolved). % teaspoonful essence of vanilla. Cochineal.

Lift the cases carefully from the board, scoop out the soft part from underneath, put them on a clean dry piece of paper or a baking-sheet with the hollow side upwards, sift with sugar, and put back into the oven to dry. Fill with the cream, joining two together. The cream must be whipped and flavoured with vanilla and sugar. Coffee essence and chocolate are nice for flavouring. Rules for Clear Jelly. 1. Have all utensils perfectly clean. Scald them before using, and do not dry them. 2. Have no flour about, as jelly is easily clouded; a few grains would spoil the brilliancy. 3. Put the sugar, gelatine, and water into a saucepan first (letting the gelatine rest on the sugar), so that it will be softening while the other ingredients are being prepared. If Nelson’s opaque gelatine is used, it should be soaked several hours before using. 4. The stiffening properties of gelatine vary in different makes, therefore it is safer to keep to one kind, so that you may know exactly the amount to use. The proportion is from 1 to lj,- oz. to each quart of liquid. The jelly should be only just stiff enough to stand. Use a little more gelatine in summer than winter. 5. Pare the lemons very thinly without any of the white. 6. Use whites and shells of eggs to clear the jelly. Wash the eggs before breaking. The whites should be slightly beaten, and the shells broken up. 7. Whisk the jelly well until boiling. 8. Have a good fire and bring quickly to boiling-point. 9. Remove the whisk directly the jelly begins to boil; let it stand for five or ten minutes before straining. 10. Use a teacloth in preference to a jelly-bag. 11. Strain in a warm place, have the basins and cloth hot; 14—2212 KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK plenty of boiling water should be poured through just before the jelly. 12. Jelly for keeping must be boiled after it is cleared and strained, to reduce it a little. 13. AVait until the jelly is cool before moulding; the steam is apt to cloud it. 14. Rinse the moulds in cold water before using. 15. To unmould dip the mould in warm water and turn on to a cold dish. Lemon Jelly. 6 oz. loaf-sugar. oz.

Put the sauce- pan with the gelatine, etc., over the fire and stir with a whisk until the gelatine has dissolved, then add the lemon rind and juice, cinnamon, clove, the whites slightly beaten and the shells broken. AVhisk well until boiling. Take out the whisk, let it stand by the side of the fire for five or ten minutes, strain through a teacloth. The first that runs through will be muddy ; return it to the cloth, and wait until it runs clear. When cool mould. Claret Jelly. 6 oz. sugar 1 pint water. ] J oz. Marshall’s gelatine.

Allow for each pound of fruit ^ lb. of sugar and 2 gills of water. Boil the sugar and water together for ten minutes, prepare the fruit, put it into the syrup, and cook till tender. 2. For very juicy fruit, such as raspberries, currants, rhubarb, etc., about half the quantity of water should be used in making the syrup. 3. Dried fruit, such as prunes, pippins, French plums, pears, api'icots, apples, or apple-rings, should be washed, and then soaked overnight in enough water to cover them. Then stew in the water in which they have been soaked till tender, adding the sugar (2 or 3 oz. to the pound) and suitable flavour- ings. " 4. For hard stewing pears allow f pint of water and 3 oz. of sugar to each pound; being so hard, they require long stewing and the water evaporates. Compote of Apples.

For milk rolls and fancy bread use pastry flour; it is lighter. 3. Use good, fresh German yeast; it should be pale in colour, breaking cleanly, and not sticky. 4. Use tepid water for mixing. To get this take one-third of boiling water to two-thirds of cold. 5. Use a warm pan, and keep the dough at an even temperature. 6. Knead well. 7. Let the dough rise well before making it into loaves. 8. Have a very hot oven at first, allowing it to cool down gradually. 9. Time the bread, allowing one hour for a half-quartern loaf, and from one and a quarter to one and a half hours for a quartern. 10. For tin bread the dough should be left to rise for ten minutes after it is put into the tins before baking. 11. Bread should be turned upside down when it comes out of the oven.KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK 222 Brown Bread No. i. 1 lb. whole meal. % lb. white flour. 2 large teaspoonfuls home-made baking-powder (see p. 232). 1 teaspoon fu.1 salt.

Pass the flour through a sieve into a warm basin, make a hole in the middle of the flour. Break up the yeast, add the sugar, cream together until liquid, pour into the hole, in the flour, add the water, and stir in enough flour from the sides to form a thick batter. Sprinkle with flour, put the salt round the sides (this is called setting the sponge), cover the pan with a cloth, and put in a warm place for half an hour. Knead into a firm dough. The pan should be quite clean, and on cutting the dough through it should be smooth and free from dry bits. Put again in a warm place for one and a half or two hours. It should swell to more than double the size. Turn the dough when ready on to a floured board, andBREAD AND PASTRY 223 make into two loaves. Put them on a floured tin, and bake for one hour. N.B.—The oven must be very hot when the bread is put in.

Pass the flour and salt through a sieve into a warm basin, cream the yeast and sugar together. Put the butter and milk into a saucepan; when warm add them to the egg (well beaten) and the yeast. Add these to the flour, and mix into a light dough with a wooden spoon. Leave in a warm place until well risen—from one to one and a half hours. Turn the dough on to a board, divide into eighteen pieces, make into shapes. Put on a buttered tin, and leave in a warm place for fifteen minutes. Bake in a hot oven for about fifteen minutes. Brush over with milk. Notes and Rules on Pastry. The variety in pastry depends chiefly on the way in which the butter is added. In short crust it is rubbed into the dry flour. In 'flaky the flour is mixed into a paste, and the butter spread all over. It is then folded up many times, thus form- ing when baked a number of layers or flakes. In rough puff the butter is cut into large pieces, and mixed with the flour. In puff the flour is mixed into a smooth paste, and after being rolled out the butter is placed in the centre and wrapped up, and then rolled out with the paste, forming large flakes of fat.KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK 224 la the process of rolling and folding these flakes become more or less mixed up, causing a puffiness which we do not get in short or flaky. 1. Use the finest flour, passing it through a sieve with the salt and baking-powder if used. 2. Keep everything as cold as possible. 3. For short crust the butter must be rubbed in with the tips of the fingers until it looks like breadcrumbs. 4. Use water sparingly, especially for short crust. 5. Mix with a knife. 6. Use very little flour in rolling, merely dusting the paste and board with a brush. 7. For glazing tarts use one white of egg and two teaspoon- fuls of water. Beat them up together slightly, brush over the pastry, and sift with castor-sugar. 8. Have a very hot oven for puff pastry, and a cooler one for short crust. 9. Do not take it out of the oven until quite cooked; it should then feel firm. 10. While the pastry is baking avoid opening the oven door wide, or shutting it quickly. Cold air or a sudden draught makes the pastry sink. 11. Pastry should always be left to cool in a warm, dry place. 12. Keep it in a dry and well-ventilated place. Mix the flour, salt, and cornflour together. Put the butter and water into a saucepan; when boiling stir in the flour. Cook well until it leaves the sides of the saucepan. Take off the fire, and beat in the eggs one at a time. Season or flavour as required. Rules for Pastry. Choux Pastry. \ lb. flour.

Place the butter in the centre, fold over the pastry from the top and bottom, then fold over the sides. Press with the rolling-pin, turn over, roll out thinly to a square, fold in three sideways, roll out a little longer, fold in three beginning from the top. Leave in a cool place for ten or fifteen minutes, roll out twice more in the same way. Note.—Six oz. butter, or even 4 oz., might be used to ^ lb. flour if a cheaper pastry were required. Rough Puff Pastry. \ lb. flour. I Salt. 5 or 6 oz. butter. | About 1 gill water.

The two most important points in cake-making are the mixing and the baking. The four chief ways of mixing are as follows : 1. Rub the fat into the flour, then add all the dry ingre- dients, then pour all the liquid in at once, only stirring just long enough to mix all together. This method is generally used for plain cakes. 2. Cream the butter and the sugar together, then beat in the eggs one at a time with a little of the flour, and stir in all the dry ingredients. This method is used for rich cakes. 3. Beat the sugar and eggs together until light and stiff, then mix in the flour lightly. This method is used for sponge and other light cakes. 4. Warm the sugar, butter, and treacle together, add this mixture to the dry ingredients, with the rest of the liquid, as in gingerbread. In cakes where the lightness depends chiefly on the baking- powder (as in No. 1) care must be taken, that they are put into the oven as soon as possible after the liquid is added. In cakes where the butter and sugar are creamed together, the baking-powder may be omitted if the mixture is well beaten by hand for twenty minutes or more 15—2228 KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK Rules for Cake-making. 1. The oven must be quite clean. 2. Heat must be uniform. 3. The temperature of the oven should be highest when tho cake is put in; the time of baking depends upon the thickness of the cake, rich mixtures taking longer than plain ones. The heat should be reduced a little after the cake is well risen. To keep a steady heat feed the fire often, putting on little fuel at one time. 4. Cakes should not be moved while baking until quite set, especially very light mixtures; it often shakes them down and makes them close and heavy. 5. The oven door must not be opened very wide when look- ing at the cakes ; the door must not be slammed, as it causes a current of cold air. 6. When baked the centre will feel firm ; another test is to pierce the cake with a trussing-needle or skewer : it should come out quite clean. 7. Put on a sieve to cool after taking out of the tins. Preparation of Cakes. 1. For rich cakes line the tins with well-buttered paper. 2. For plain cakes the tins must be well buttered. 3. Currants must be well washed and dried, then rubbed on a sieve or in a cloth, with a little flour, to remove the stalks. 4. Sultanas must not be washed, only rubbed with a little flour on a sieve or in a cloth to remove stalks. 5. Raisins should be stoned and cut in half. 6. Candied peel should be cut up finely. 7. Eggs should be broken separately, in case of bad ones. 8. Lemon-rind should be grated or chopped very finely, taking care that no white is used.229 CAKES 9. When dripping is used, it must always be clarified, or it will give a meaty flavour to the cake. 10. For sponge cakes oil the moulds or brush with clarified butter, then sprinkle with castor-sugar and flour mixed in equal quantities. Method No. 1. (a) 1. Butter the cake-tins and line with buttered paper, except for the very plain cakes. 2. Prepare the fruit. 3.

Strain lemon-juice before using. 3. For butter icing use the best fresh butter. J 4. If butter icing becomes too soft in mixing, leave it to cool before using. 5. Take care not to let any cake-crumbs, etc., fall into the icing; they stop up the forcers, causing loss of time and un- necessary trouble. 6. Keep the icing covered over after it is made, with a wet cloth to prevent the surface from getting dry. 7. Mix glace icing smoothly before warming, and do not let it get very hot, as it loses its shiny appearance. 8. Before using test the consistency by lifting it up on the back of a wooden spoon. More sugar or liquid may be added as required. 9. Icing that is left over should be put into a jar and covered closely for future use. 10. Wash and dry the icing-bags and forcers directly they are done with. 11. For a rich cake that requires keeping for some weeks before it is cut, it is best to give it one coating of icing as soon as it is baked and cold, to keep in the richness, and not to finish icing and decorating until a day or so before it is wanted, in order that it may be as white as jrassible.261 ICINGS Almond Paste No. 1. 1 lb. sweet almonds. 2 new-laid eggs. 1 oz. bitter almonds. 1 tablespoonful sherry. 1 lb. castor-sugar. Blanch the almonds, dry in a clean cloth, put through a grating machine, add the sugar, pound well. Add the new- laid eggs and sherry, knead well till all is well mixed; it is then ready to use.

Only the best materials should be used. Small quantities of each dish should be prepared, and not more sent up than the patient is likely to eat. Jellies set in small moulds, puddings baked or steamed in darioles, present a much more attractive appearance than a spoonful taken from a large jelly or pudding. Silver should be bright, china shining, cloths spotlessly clean, for all this helps to make the food look inviting, and to tempt the appetite of the invalid. Extreme care should be taken that all utensils used in the preparation of food are scrupulously clean. No food should be left in the sick-room, and the patient should have no idea of what is being prepared; for an unex- pected dainty often tempts the appetite. When patients are convalescent there is a large variety of little dishes which are suitable, thus avoiding monotony. Eggs form a useful part of the diet, and may be prepared in a number of ways. None but the best new-laid eggs should be used. Beef-tea should be made in small quantities—only sufficient for the coming day. The cup in which it is served should be previously warmed, that the patient may receive it as hot asINVALID COOKERY 265 possible. Toast may be served with it, unless the patient be on a strictly liquid diet. Raw beef-tea should be served in a coloured glass, that the colour of the liquid may not be noticed. Brand’s essence is particularly useful in cases of exhaustion. Many dishes suitable for invalids will be found in other sections of this book. Stimulants and acids should not be used without the doctor’s permission. Apple Souffle No. i. 2 large apples. A pinch, of grated lemon-rind or 2 teaspoonfuls sugar. 2 teaspoonfuls of juice. 1 white of egg. Bake the apples until soft, rub the pulp through a sieve, mix in the sugar, lemon rind or juice, and the white of egg beaten to a stiff froth, stirring together lightly with a silver spoon. Pile the mixture lightly in a small fireproof dish, squeeze over it a little lemon-juice, sift with sugar, and bake for about ten minutes. If preferred, the mixture can be served cold, when the white of egg will be found to be more digestible. Apple Souffle No. 2. 3 apples. I 1 lemon. 1 tablespoonful sugar. | 1 new-laid egg. Bake the apples, rub the pulp through a sieve, mix with it the sugar, lemon-juice, and a quarter of the rind grated, and the yolk of egg. Beat the white to a stiff froth and stir it in lightly. Pour the mixture into a dish and bake for about ten minutes. Cup of Arrowroot No. i. 1 dessertspoonful arrowroot. I Pinch of salt. I pint milk. | \ teaspoonful sugar. Put the arrowroot into a basin, moisten with a little of tho cold milk; put the rest of milk into a saucepan, and whenKING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK 266 boiling pour it on to the arrowroot, stirring quicldy.

Arrowroot Pudding. 1 dessertspoonful arrowroot. I 1 dessertspoonful sugar £ pint milk. | 2 yolks and 1 white of egg. After making the arrowroot (as for Cup of Arrowroot) turn into a basin, let it cool, add sugar, yolks of eggs, and white beaten to a stiff froth. Stir this in lightly, pour it into a buttered pie-dish, and bake for about ten minutes. Be very careful not to let it boil. Barley-water. 4 tablespoonfuls barley. I 2 teaspoon fuls sugar. ^ lemon. | 2 pints water (boiling). Well wash the barley, and put it into a hot jug; add the sugar and lemon-juice and rind, pour in the boiling water, cover, and leave until cold.INVALID COOKERY 267 Barley-water and Soda. 3 teaspoonfuls lemon-juice. I \ glass barley-water. 2 teaspoonfuls sugar. | £ glass soda-water. Mix the lemon-juice and sugar together in a tumbler, half fill with barley-water, then add soda-water. Drink while effervescing. Notes on Beef-tea. Beef-tea is so valuable in cases of illness that it deserves special attention. It must be regarded as a stimulant rather than a food. The goodness extracted will consist chiefly of albumen and other soluble extractives. The meat must be finely divided by scraping and shredding, and then soaked in cold water that the albumen may be drawn out, and afterwards cooked very lightly, remembering how easily this constituent of meat is rendered hard and indigestible when submitted to a high temperature. Shin of beef makes very savoury beef-tea, but it contains more sinew and gristle and less of the albumen and red juices than rump or buttock steak. A small quantity cooked with the steak will be found an improvement. If the beef-tea is required to set in a jelly, it is best to stew the shin of beef separately and mix it after- wards, as the high temperature required to extract the gelatine hardens and renders indigestible the albumen. Rules for Beef-tea. 1. Choose fresh lean juicy steak. 2. Remove all fat and scrape or shred the meat finely. 3. Allow 1 pint of water to a pound of meat. 4. Put the meat into a basin with the water and salt to soak for twenty minutes before cooking. 5. Cook in a double saucepan or stew-jar placed in water. G. Do not boil.268 KING EDWARD’S COOKERY BOOK 7. If beef-tea is required to set in a jelly when cold, stew a little shin of beef separately to mix with it afterwards, or add some isinglass. 8. When cooked, strain and remove all fat with tissue or blotting paper. 9. If allowed, add a little cayenne and celery salt before serving. 10. Dip a teacup in hot water, pour in the beef-tea, and serve at once. 11. In warming up beef-tea, put it in a jar and stand it in boiling water until hot. Beef-tea No. i. J lb. lean juicy steak. J pint water. Pinch of salt. {Enough for 2 cupfuls.) Prepare the meat, soak in a basin, then turn into a saucepan and heat very slowly, stirring all the time, and pressing the meat against the sides of the pan; cook until the liquor turns a rich red brown. Strain into a cup and remove any fat with a piece of paper. Beef-tea No. 2. f lb. beefsteak. I Pinch of salt. | lb. shin of beef. | 1 pint water. Prepare meat, put into a jar with the water and salt, cover closely, and stand in a saucepan of water; put on the lid, cook slowly for three hours, stirring from time to time. Strain, and when cold remove the fat. N.B.—The shin of beef is used to improve the flavour. Beef-tea No. 3. Prepare as for No. 2, place the jar in the oven and cook two hours, then strain, etc.INVALID COOKERY 269 N.B.—This is more savoury, but not so suitable for some invalids.

Serve on rounds of toast, with or without gravy. A little beef-tea may be poured round. N.B.—Chicken quenelles can be made in the same way by using chicken instead of beef. Black-Currant Tea. 1 large tablespoonful black-currant jam. 4 teaspoonful lemon-juice. £ pint boiling water. Put the jam into a jug, add the lemon-juice, pour over the boiling water, cover for a few minutes, strain.270 KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK Bread and Milk. 1 slice crisp toast. ^ pint boiling milk. Pinch of salt. Cut the toast into tiny dice and put them in a breakfast cup, pour over the boiling milk, add a pinch of salt, serve hot. Make some good bread sauce, serve on a hot plate with beef or mutton gravy. Wash the feet, divide eaeh into four pieces, blanch and wash; put into a perfectly clean saucepan, add the cold water, skim well, and cook for six hours, keeping the saucepan closely covered. Strain through a teacloth or hair sieve, leave until cold and set; remove all fat, wipe the top with a cloth dipped in boiling water. Put the jelly into a clean saucepan, add the gelatine, let this first melt, then add sugar, rind and juice of lemons, the sherry and brandy, the eggshells broken up, and the whites slightly beaten, whisk well until boiling. Put the lid partly on, move the saucepan to the side of the fire for ten minutes, strain through a hot teacloth.

N.B.—A double enamelled saucepan is convenient for making porridge, as the inside only can be used at first to boil up the water and to cook the oatmeal until it has thickened. It can then be put inside the other, with water underneath, and cooked for three hours, and there is no danger of the porridge burning.CHAPTER XV PRESERVES AND PICKLES Notes and Rules on Preserving. For preserve to keep well, it is necessary that a large propor- tion of the water in the fruit should be evaporated. Therefore it is better to cook it quickly; also, the jam will be a bad colour if long in making. The fruit should be picked in dry weather, or the jam is likely to become mouldy. Crushed loaf is the best sugar to use. The quantity depends somewhat upon the fruit, and varies from f lb. to 1 lb. for each pound of fruit. A copper preserving-pan is not so liable to burn as an enamelled pan, but it must be kept quite bright. Rules. 1. Preserve the fruit as soon as possible after gathering. 2. Have a clear fire or gas-stove. 3. Allow room in the preserving-pan for the jam to boil well. 4. Keep the jam at a gentle heat until the sugar has dis- solved. 5. Use a wooden spoon for stirring. 6. Allow the jam to boil quickly, taking care that it does not burn, as sugar burns easily. 7. Stir frequently and skim well.?&2 KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK 8. To see if the jam is cooked, test by putting a little on a plate and leaving till cold. If cooked sufficiently it will set. Jam insufficiently boiled is apt to ferment. 9. See that the jars are perfectly dry and warm. Glass jars are best, as the condition of the jam can more easily be seen. 10. To tie down, cut rounds of tissue paper the size of the jars. Dip them into brandy and put on the top of the jam. Then tie over some parchment-paper and label with name of jam and date of making. It should be covered up as soon as cold. 11. Store in a dry and airy place. Apple Jam. 12 lb. apples. 7\ lb. sugar. 3 lemons.

N.B.—The fruit boiled up with mere syrup makes a second quality.CHAPTER XYII AFTERNOON TEAS For afternoon tea there are many dainty cakes and sand- wiches which may be served with a choice of tea and coffee, and so prevent monotony. The tea should only be allowed to infuse for three minutes; it should be made with quite boiling water to insure the full flavour being extracted. Water that has boiled twice will quite spoil it. The cream should be fresh from the dairy; the preserved cream sold in jars is too thick, and imparts a disagreeable flavour to the tea. Coffee is often served as well for those who may not care for tea. Thin brown and white bread and butter is cut; if liked it may be rolled. Sandwiches of preserve may be cut into rounds or fancy shapes. White tin bread one day old is the best for cutting thinly, as fresh bread is liable to crumble ; but brown bread is nicer new. Milk and rasped rolls are better new; these are a change sometimes from the ordinary loaf. As some people do not care for sweet cake, savoury sand- wiches will prove a welcome addition to the tea-table. Sandwiches should be cut into small triangles or squares, dished lightly on a cl’oylcy, and garnished with cress. Sardine and cress sandwiches should be made with brown bread and butter; shrimp sandwiches are nicest made from milk or rasped rolls; watercress and cucumber and tomato296 KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK sandwiches are most acceptable in the summer, being cool and refreshing. The yolk of a hard-boiled egg pounded with a little butter and anchovy or bloater paste is a very good mixture for sand- wiches. If sandwiches are cut some time before they are wanted, a damp cloth placed over them will keep them per- fectly fresh. Small scones, potato cakes, pikelets, tea cakes, etc., buttered and served hot are suitable for the cold weather. There is such a variety of cakes and biscuits that, with a little care and forethought, the tea-table may be made very attractive. Fingers of rich cake, crisp biscuits, small iced cakes, shapes of almond paste, little cakes, all give a light and attractive appearance. They may be mixed or served separately, and only a few of each kind should be used. Itccipes for these will be found elsewhere. In summer iced tea is sometimes served. This is prepared by making a quantity of tea several hours before it is wanted. After the tea has infused for three minutes it should be poured off, a little lemon-juice added, and allowed to get perfectly cold. Serve with ice and thin slices of lemon. See Beverages.CHAPTER XVIII MENUS AND THEIR COMPILATION Order of serving a Complete Dinner. IIORS D’CEUVRES. POTAGES. POISSON. ENTREES. RELEVES. ROTI. ■; ENTREMETS. DESSERT. CAEE. This forms a complete dinner. Sometimes one or two of the courses are omitted, but the order of serving them remains the same. A dinner of the present day consists of more courses than formerly, but fewer dishes are served in each course. Ilors d'ceuwes are usually served cold. They should be small and inviting in appearance. Potages.—The clear soup should precede the thick. Two soups are more usually served than three. If only one soup is served, preference should be given to a clear or thin cream soup.298 KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK Poissons may be either plainly boiled or dressed fish. When two fish are served, the plain comes before the dressed. Dressed fish should be served in small pieces. Entries are served either before or after the releves. They consist of dressed or made dishes, usually composed of many ingredients. Entrees should always be served daintily. If two are served, one should be brown and the other white. The light entree comes first, the heavy one later. One may be cold and the other hot. Relevis.—This course, as a rule, consists of solid joints roasted, boiled, or braised. The garnish gives the charac- teristic name to each dish, and a vegetable is usually served with the remove. Sorbets or liquid ices are served after the remove. Pidti, consists of game or poultry. Sometimes when joints are served the remove is omitted. A salad is always served with the roti, and usually fried potatoes. Entremets.—This course usually consists of three things: (1) Dressed vegetables, which follow the roast, and often goes under the name of ‘Legume,’ and is served as a separate course. (2) Sweet entremets, which may be served either hot or cold. If two are served, one should be hot, the other cold. (3) Savouries, which precede the dessert, and are usually served hot. Cheese is often served. Care should be taken in compiling a menu to choose dishes which are in season, and to alternate the methods of cooking (<e.g., two fried dishes should not succeed one another), and the character of the dishes (e.g., a rich soup should be followed by a plain fish course). Oysters should never appear on the menu during the months of May, June, July, and August. The dishes should be varied as much as possible both in colour and taste. Well-known dishes should not have new names given to them.299 MENUS AND THEIR COMPILATION Most dishes have standard garnishes, and are known by this characteristic name all over the world. A garnish should always please the eye and satisfy the palate. For simple garnishes aspic, beetroot, cucumber, eggs, lemon, parsley, watercress, olives, cut vegetables, truffles, horseradish, etc., may be used. Sometimes a thick sauce forms the only garnish (e.g., fricassee of chicken). MENU Le 6 Janvier. Hors d’CEuvre. Anchois aux Capres. Potages. Consomme aux CEufs Files. Potage a la Tortue fausse.

It is not easy of digestion, but a small quantity taken at the end of a meal aids digestion. Cheese is the curd of milk dried. The milk is slightly heated, then the curd is separated from the whey by the addition of an acid. The curd is then dried and pressed, a process that usually takes several months. Skimmed milk cheeses are very hard, and arc the most indigestible. Cheese made from new milk, with or without the addition of cream, is much softer, being usually known as ‘ fat ’ cheese. Stilton is the finest of English cheeses, but varies very much in quality, sufficient care not being taken whilst it is ripening. Gorgonzola and Wensleydale most resemble Stilton. Gor- gonzola has a strong and peculiar odour, Wensleydale is little known, only 200 of the cheeses being made annually in a little village of that name in Yorkshire. Sage cheese is made by mixing chopped sage with the curd before being dried. It is not often seen except in the country. Cheddar is one of the best-known cheeses. It is a mild cheese, and one of the least expensive. American cheeses are a little cheaper, and have a stronger flavour than English. Parmesan is a skimmed-milk cheese. It is very hard, and is much used grated in culinary preparations.303 NOTES ON CHEESE The best Parmesan is kept for three or four years before sending to market. Swiss cheeses are noted for their fine flavour, Gruyere being one of the best known. Camembert is a cream cheese made in Brittany. It is a small round yellow cheese with a dark rind. Great care is taken in regulating the temperature of the room in which the cheese is dried, or it is spoilt. Cream cheese is not properly cheese, merely being cream well dried. Roquefort is a very rich cheese made in the South of France. Dutch cheeses are round, and have a dark-red rind. The best-known cheeses are as follows : American. Brie. Camembert. Cheddar. Cheshire. Cottenham. Derby. Double Gloucester. Dutch. Gorgonzola. Gruyere. Neuchatel. Parmesan. Roquefort. Porte Salute. Stilton. Wensleydale. Cream Cheese. 3 quarts thin cream, at 60° F. 10 drops rennet. Let it stand one hour in a stone jar, then pour into a bag, and hang it up for twelve hours. Squeeze at the end of six hours, press under three bricks. Milk Cheese. 2 quarts new milk, at 80° F. 10 drops rennet. 1 tablespoonful cold water. Stand one hour, ready for turning the next day, if kept at 60°, fill moulds up to top.VOCABULARY Absinthe.—A liqueur prepared from a plant of the Wormwood family.

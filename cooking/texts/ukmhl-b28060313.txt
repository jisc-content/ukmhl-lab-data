STAMFORD STREET( i" ) PREFACE. The advanced state of the art of Cookery having rendered Mrs. Rundell’s book insufficient for the guidance of the modern cook, it has been found necessary to remodel her work, and to replace those receipts which have become obsolete by others founded upon the newer methods adopted by the best cooks of the present day. The present enlarged collection of original receipts will be found to possess strong claims to attention, having been carefully selected from family MSS., tried and vouched for by the parties from whom they have been obtained. In the choice of them great attention has been given to the subject of economy, and the arrangement of the whole work, previously enriched with the valuable contributions of the late Miss Emma Roberts,a has been placed under the careful inspection of a Lady well versed in the art of which it treats. The book has had the • further advantage of being thoroughly revised by a profes- sional gentleman of great repute in London, who has also sup- plied several valuable receipts. Without wishing to disparage any of the numerous modern productions which have been given to the public, it may be affirmed that, although the treatises of professional cuisiniers on the subject are valuable to those who are competent to cany out their receipts, yet, generally speaking, they are too scientific for the comprehension a The receipts marked E. It. were contributed by Miss Roberts. a 2PREFACE. IV of common cooks, as well as too expensive for the greater number of private families. It has, therefore, been thought advisable to confine this work to a collection of plain and useful receipts, the result of experience and practice, adapted for those families of moderate fortune in which a certain degree of elegance is combined with attention to domestic economy. The number of editionsa which Mrs. Rundell’s celebrated work has passed through is the best test of its utility ; and it is confidently expected that the number and value of the additional receipts and precepts which are contained in this will place it still higher in public estimation. Among the novel features in this volume as now offered to the public may be mentioned—1. the great increase in the number and variety of receipts, set forth in a clearer type than before; 2. a greater simplification of language in order to render the receipts more easy of comprehension ; 3. the illus- trative woodcuts which adorn the present volume; 4. the new system of numbering every separate receipt to facilitate reference; 5. the mode of printing in figures all numbers and quantities for the sake of clearness; and 6. the Tables for computing household accounts. All these improvements will, it is hoped, contribute much to the utility of the work and to facilitate the use of it. a Upwards of 200,000 copies have been sold.( V ) CONTENTS.

An inch is the smallest lineal measure to which a name is given, but subdivisions are used for many purposes. Among mechanics, the inch is commonly divided into eighths. By the officers of the revenue and by scientific persons it is divided into tenths, hundredths, &c. Formerly it was made to consist of 12 parts, called lines. Particular Measures of Length.

For liquids several denominations have been heretofore adopted, viz.:—For Beer, the Firkin of 9 Gallons, the Kilderkin of 18, the Barrel of 36, the Hogshead of 54, and the Butt of 108 Galls. These will probably continue to be used in practice. For Wine and Spirits, there are the Anker, Runlet, Tierce, Hogshead, Puncheon, Pipe, Butt, and Tun; hut these may be considered rather as the names of the casks in which such commodities are imported, than as expressing any definite number of gallons. It is the practice to gauge all such vessels, and to charge them according to their actual content. Flour is sold nominally by measure, but actually by weight, reckoned at 7 lb.

OBSERVATIONS FOR THE USE OF* THE MISTRESS OF A FAMILY. Importance of a Knowledge of Household Affairs — Direction of a Table — Accounts — Prices of Provisions — Servants — Their Characters and Wages —Hints on Domestic Economy — Bills — Inventories — Store- room — Bread — Sugar — Soap and Candles — Vegetables and Fruit — Eggs. If our ancestors made domestic occupations too exclusively the aim of female education, it may he truly said that the present generation has fallen as unwisely into the contrary extreme. Young ladies of our time pride themselves upon knowing nothing whatever concerning those duties which most assuredly ought to be deemed essential in the mistress of a family, and taught as a branch of education. Generally speaking, there is a distaste amongst' the educated classes of the female community of England to tire details of house- keeping', and particularly to those connected with the kitchen, the consequence of which is, that dinners are seldom well arranged, or the most made of the materials provided. It is indeed a very common, but a very erroneous supposition, that attention to culinary affairs is unladylike, and beneath the dignity of a gentlewoman ; yet there can be no question that ele- gance, comfort, social enjoyment, and, it may be added, health, materially depend upon attention to the table ; and the prudent management of her family ought to be considered an important object amongst the duties of every lady when she marries. There are comparatively few persons among the middleMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. I. v classes of society who can afford to teep professed cooks, their wages being’ too high, and their methods too extravagant. In such cases a plain cook is alone attainable, who knows little beyond the commonest operations of the kitchen. The mistress ought therefore to make herself so far acquainted with cookery as to be competent to give proper directions for dressing a dinner, and having it properly served up. Perhaps there are few occasions on which the respectability of a man is.more immediately felt, than the style of dinner to which' he ipay accidentally bring home a visitor. Every one ought to live according to his circumstances, and the meal of the tradesman ought not to emulate .he entertainments of the higher classes; but if merely two or three dishes be well served, with the proper accompaniments, the table-linen clean, Tka small sideboard neatly laid, and all that is necessary be at l and, the expectation of both the husband and friend will be gratified, because no interruption of the domestic arrangements will disturb their social intercourse. Hence the direction of a table is no inconsiderable branch of a lady’s concern, as it involves judgment in expenditure, •respectability of appearance, and the comfort of her husband as well as of those who partake of their hospitality. Inatten- tion to it is always inexcusable, and should be avoided for the lady’s own sake, as it occasions a disagreeable degree of bustle and evident annoyance to herself, which is never observable in a well-regulated establishment. In doing the honours of her table, the mode of carving is also of importance, and will be , ated of in a future chapter. The mode of covering the table differs in taste. It is not: the multiplicity of things,-but the choice, the dressing, and the neat pleasing look of the whole, which give respectability to her who presides. The table should be furnished with more than the necessary quantity of plate, or plated ware, and glass,. to afford a certain appearance of elegance; and if accompanied by a clean cloth and a neatly-dressed attendant, it will show' that the habits of the family are those of gentility. Fora small party, or a tete-a-tete, a dumb waiter is a convenientChap. I.] DIRECTION OF A TABLE. 3 contrivance, as it partly saves the attendance of servants. The cruets should be looked to and filled every day an hour before dinner; and much trouble and irregularity are saved when there is company, if servants are accustomed to prepare the table and sideboard in similar order daily. Too many or too few dishes are extremes not uncommon: the former encum- bering the dinner with a superfluity which partakes of vul- garity, whilst the latter has the appearance of poverty or penuriousness. In all situations of life the entertainment should be no less suited to the station than to the fortune of the entertainer, and to the number and rank of those invited. Without any of those attempts, so constantly witnessed, to imitate, with limited means, the costly and magnificent banquets of the great, still, if the arrangements of the table be properly studied, a degree of elegance is attainable under all circumstances, however eco- nomical ; and the plainest fare, if dressed with care, may be made to furnish dishes which everybody will eat with relish. Should there be only a joint and a pudding, they should always be served up separately; and the dishes, however small the party, should always form two courses. Thus, in the old- fashioned style of “ fish, soup, and a roast,” the soup and fish are placed at the top and bottom of the table, removed by the joint with vegetables and pastry; or, should the company con- sist of eight or ten, a couple or more of side dishes in the first ‘ course, with game and a pudding in the second, accompanied by confectionary, is quite sufficient. In most of the books which treat of cookery, various bills of fare are given, which are never exactly followed. The mistress should give a moderate number of those dishes ^Jiich are most in season. The cuts which are inserted in some of those lists put the soup in the middle of the table, where it. should never be placed. For a small party a single lamp in the centre is Sufficient,; but for a larger number the room should be _ lighted with lamps hung over the table, ancj the centre occupied by a plateau of glass or plate, ornamented with flowers or figures. b 2MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. I. 4 The mistress of a family should never forget that the welfare and good management of the house depend on the eye of the superior; and, consequently, that nothing is too trifling for her notice, whereby waste may be avoided or order maintained. If she has never been accustomed, while single, to think of family management, let her not upon that account fear that she cannot attain it: she may consult others who are more experienced, and acquaint herself with the necessaiy quanti- ties, quality, and prices of the several articles of family ex- penditure, in proportion to the number it consists of. The chief duties of life are within the reach of humble abilities, and she whose aim is to fulfil them will rarely ever fail to acquit her- self well. United with, and perhaps crowning all, the virtues of the female character, is that well-directed ductility of mind which occasionally bends its attention to the smaller objects of life, knowing them to be often scarcely less essential than the greater. A minute account of the annual income and the times of payment should be taken in writing; likewise an estimate of the supposed amount of each article of expense; and those who are early accustomed to calculations on domestic articles will acquire so accurate a knowledge of what their establish- ment requires, as mil enable them to keep the happy medium between prodigality and parsimony. In apportioning the items of expenditure of a family, some- thing should always be assigned for the use of the poor, which enables any pressing case of distress to be at once attended to, without a question “ whether it can be spared.” Much might be done for the poor if care were taken to keep a pan into which every bone and morsel of spare meat, vegetables, &c., were put: these might be stewed, the bones taken out, and a few peas added, making a meal, two or three times a-week, for any poor deserving family, without increasing the family ex- penditure beyond a few pence. Perhaps few branches of female education are more useful than great readiness in figures. Accounts should be regularly kept, and not the smallest article omitted to be entered. IfChap. I.] ACCOUNTS — PRICES OF PROVISIONS. balanced every week or month, the income and outgoings will be ascertained with facility, and their proportions to each other be duly observed. Some people fix on stated sums to be ap- propriated to each different article, as house, clothes, pocket, education of children, &c. Whatever may be the amount of household expenditure, a certain mode should be adopted, and strictly adhered to. Besides the regular account-book, in which the receipt of money and every payment should be regularly entered, a commonplace-book should be always at hand for the entry of observations regarding agreements with servants, tradesmen, and various other subjects, so as to enable the lady at once to ascertain the exact state of the affairs under her immediate management. Want of arrangement leads to loss of time, and time, if lost, can never be regained. Early hours, order, punctuality, and method, are its great economists, and cannot be too rigidly enforced. If orders be given soon in the morning, there will be more time to execute them; and servants, by doing their work without hurry and bustle, will be more likely to do it well, and fewer might be necessary. To give unvarying rules cannot be attempted, as people ought to act differently under different circumstances: the minutiae of management must therefore be regulated by every one’s fortune and rank, but there are many general rules which will be found equally ad- vantageous to all. It is very necessary for the mistress of a family to be in- formed of the prices and goodness of all articles in common use, and of the best times, as well as places, for purchasing them. She should also be acquainted with the comparative prices of provisions, in order that she may be able to sub- stitute those that are most reasonable, when they will answer as well, for others of the same kind, but which are more costly. On this, however, it has been properly remarked, in that very useful publication ‘ The Magazine of Domestic Economy,’ that “ small families should never encumber themselves with huge and perhaps awkward pieces of even excellent meat, under the idea that it is cheap, because offered below theMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. I. 6 market-price: nominally it may be so, but in the end it will be found exceedingly dear. A large portion of bone will necessarily exist; and if soups be not wanted, the bones will be made no use of, although they not only weigh heavy, but are paid for at the same price as the prime parts of the meat.” Those who cannot afford to give the high prices demanded for the best joints are recommended to purchase what are termed “ the inferior joints,” provided they be of the best qua- lity : thus, a shoulder of good mutton or veal is far preferable to the leg or fillet of an ill-conditioned sheep or calf. Inferior meat will never do credit to the cook, but inferior joints may be improved by cookery, and rendered equal to the best. It is the same with fish: a good fresh brill being infinitely pre- ferable to stale turbot; while one fresh egg will go as far as three which have lost their richness by long keeping. In short, be assured that the purchase of “cheap things” will generally be found false economy. Though it is very disagreeable to suspect any one’s honesty, it is yet prudent to weigh meat, sugar, &c., when brought in, and to compare the weight with the charge. It would be as well if brewers and bakers were to have tallies with the cook, on which every barrel of beer or loaf of bread may be marked, as they will serve to prevent overcharges. The butcher should be ordered to send a ticket with the meat; and the cook, after weighing the meat, should file these checks, to be examined when the weekly bill shall be delivered. Scales should be placed in the kitchen, near the door used by the tradespeople. The knowledge of such things as weights and scales being in use, will o’perate as a check to any petty fraud which might otherwise be contemplated. Respecting servants, there are a few things which cannot be too strongly urged: one is, never to retain a cook who is not fond of her occupation ; for unless she take pleasure in her art, she cannot be depended upon for accuracy in the prepa- ration of dishes with which she is well acquainted, and will not easily be induced to acquire anything new. She also must possess a natural regard for cleanliness, or all the painsChap. I.] SERVANTS. 7 in the world will never render her cleanly: where dirty habits are manifested, dismissal should follow, for in almost every instance they will be found incurable. Another point of main importance is her temper; for if that be not good, she will be disinclined to receive instructions, and, if found fault with, may, out of pique, spoil a dinner; whereas a good- humoured, intelligent servant, when made acquainted with the habits of the house, and equal to her common duties, will hardly fail of success when called upon by her mistress to try any of those receipts which she has not already used. It behoves every person to be extremely careful whom they take into their service; to be very minute in investigating the character they receive, and equally cautious and scrupulously just in giving one to others. Were this more generally at- tended to, many evils would be avoided which now result from worthless servants being put in places of trust. It may be fairly asserted that the unfaithfulness of a servant, which is but a milder epithet i'or robbery or waste, will be laid to the charge of that master or mistress who, knowing or having- well-founded suspicions of such faults in a servant, is prevailed upon, by false pity or entreaty, to slide her into another place ; but, on the other hand, it would be unpardonably unjust to refuse to give a fair and candid representation of merits and demerits, on any plea whatever. As to wages, it is better to err on the liberal than on the niggardly side; for the trifling difference in wages between a good and a bad cook will soon be made up by the former, not only in the comfort but the economy of the table. Ser- vants’ wages should be paid regularly. Perquisites of all kinds should be strictly forbidden, as not unfrequently leading to pilfering and the corruption of common honesty. Do not allow servants to pay your tradesmen’s bills, but let the tradesmen call for them. Nor should small temptations be laid in the way of young servants, particularly females who have the care of ladies’ dresses and jewellery, as many an honest girl has been led to become a thief through the incaution of her mistress.8 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. I. In the hiring of servants it is an excellent plan to agree to increase their wages annually to a fixed sum, where it should stop, and to recommend that a portion of it should be regularly placed in a savings-bank. An incentive will thus be offered to good conduct; and when the hoard saved up amounts to any considerable sum, the possessor will generally feel more inclined to enlarge than to expend it. A kindly feeling of indulgence on the part of the mistress towards her servants in the matter of petty faults, coupled with good-natured attention to their daily comforts, and occasional permission to visit and receive a few of their near friends, would go far to create a cordial degree of attachment, which must be ever desirable to a respectable family, and cheaply purchased by such consideration. Mildness of language will generally be met by respectful language on the part of a servant, and of itself will produce a saving of temper at least to the master or mistress. Due praise will mostly be found a powerful stimulus to good, and in some measure a preventive to bad conduct, on the part of a servant. To young beginners in housekeeping, the following brief hints on domestic economy, in the management of a moderate income, may perhaps not prove unacceptable. A bill of parcels and receipt should be required, even if the money be paid at the time of purchase; and, to avoid mis- takes, let the goods be compared with these when brought home; or if paid for at future periods, a bill should be sent with the article, and regularly filed on separate files for each tradesman. An inventory of furniture, linen, and china should be kept, and the things examined by it twice a-year, oroftener if there be a change of servants ; the articles used by servants should be intrusted to their care, with a list, as is done with plate. In articles not in common use, such as spare bedding, tickets of parchment, numbered and specifying to what they belong, should be sewed on each; and minor articles in daily use, such as household cloths and kitchen requisites, should be occasionally looked to. The best means to preserve blankets from moths9 Chap. I.] HINTS ON DOMESTIC ECONOMY. is to fold and lay them under the feather-beds that are in use, and shake them occasionally ; when soiled, they should be washed, not scoured. The most durable sort of linen for sheeting is the Russia, German, or Irish fabrics, a good stock of which, as well as of table-linen, should be laid in to avoid the necessity of frequent or irregular washing. A proper quantity of household articles should always be allowed for daily use. Each should also be kept hi its proper place, and applied to its proper use. Let all repairs be done as soon as wanted, remembering the old adage of “a stitch in time,” and never, if possible, defer any necessary household concern a moment beyond the time when it ought to be attended to. In the purchase of glass and crockery-ware, either the most customary patterns should be chosen, in order to secure their being easily matched when broken; or, if a scarce design be adopted, an extra quantity should be bought, to guard against the annoyance of the set being spoiled by breakage, which in the course of time must be expected to happen. There should likewise be plenty of common dishes, that the table-set may not be used for putting away cold meat, &c. The cook should be encouraged to be careful of coals and cinders: for the latter there is a new contrivance for sifting-, without dispersing the dust, by means of a covered tin bucket. Small coal wetted makes the strongest fire for the back of the grate, but must remain untouched till it cakes. Cinders lightly wetted give a great degree of heat, and are better than coal for furnaces, ironing-stoves, and ovens. A Store-room is essential for the custody of articles in con- stant use, as well as for others which are only occasionally called for. These should be at hand when wanted, each in separate drawers, or on shelves and pegs, all under the lock and key of the mistress, and never given out to the servants but under her inspection. Pickles and preserves, prepared and purchased sauces, and all sorts of groceries, should lie there stored ; the spices pounded and corked up in small bottles, sugar broken, and everything10 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. I. in readiness for use. Lemon-peel, thyme, parsley, and all sorts of sweet herbs, should be dried and grated for use in seasons of plenty; the tops of tongues saved, and dried for grating into omelettes, &c. ; and care taken that nothing be wasted that can be turned to good account. Bread is so heavy an article of expense, that all waste should be guarded against, and having it cut in the room will tend much to prevent it; but, for company, small rolls, placed in or on the napkin of each guest, are the most convenient, as well as the most elegant. Bread should be kept in earthen pans with covers. Sugar being also an article of considerable expense in all families, the purchase demands particular attention. The cheapest does not go so far as that more refined, and there is a difference even in the degree of sweetness. The close, heavy, and shining white, or loaf-sugar, should be chosen. The best sort of brown has a bright, crystalline appearance, as if mixed with salt, and, if feeling coarse when rubbed between the fingers, is better than when more powdery. East India sugars are finer for the price, but not so strong, consequently unfit for wines and sweetmeats, but do well for common purposes. To pound white sugar, rolling it with a bottle, and sifting, wastes it less than a mortar. Both soap and tallow candles are improved by keeping, and are best when made in cool weather; at which time it will be prudent to lay in a stock of both. They are, indeed, better for being kept eight or ten months, nor will they injure for two years if kept in a cool place ; and there are few articles that better deserve care in buying, and allowing a regulated quantity of, according to the size of the family. As to the sort of moulds, “ short sixes ” are the best for common domes- tic purposes, as, after dinner, workers or readers are better accommodated with light from candles of that size and height than from those called “ long sixes,” which look poor and thin ; but “fours” are preferable to either. Of kitchen candles, those of ten to the pound will be found more serviceable than either eight or twelve.Chap. I.] HINTS ON DOMESTIC ECONOMY. II Wax, spermaceti, and composite candles ought to be always purchased in quantities of not less than a dozen pounds, on which an allowance is usually made by the chandler. Gas is not much used in private houses, except in offices and passages. Oil-lamps have the advantage of affording a bril- liant light and being of elegant appearance, but they are very troublesome in management, as well as expensive. Every year there is a variety in lamps, but there has not yet been any- thing offered to the public which equals for domestic use the Palmer candle-lamp. Soap should be cut in pieces that will make a long square, when first brought in, and kept out of the air two or three weeks; for, if it dries quickly, it will crack, and, when wet, break. Put it on a shelf, leaving a space between each piece, and let it grow hard gradually : thus it will save a full third in the consumption ; but, for coarse washing, soft soap will go further than the hard. Soda, by softening the water, saves a great deal of soap. It should be melted in a large jug of water, some of which pour into the tubs and boiler; and when the latter becomes weak add more. The new improvement in soft soap is, if pro- perly used, a saving of nearly half in quantity, and, though somewhat dearer than the hard, reduces the price of washing considerably. Many good laundresses advise soaping linen in warm water the night previous to washing, as facilitating the operation with less friction. The price of starch depends upon that of flour ; the best will keep good in a dry warm room for some years. Everything should be kept in the place best suited to it, as much waste may thereby be avoided. Great care should be taken of jelly-bags, tapes for collared things, &c., which, if not perfectly scalded and kept dry, give an unpleasant flavour when next used. Vegetables will keep best on a stone floor, if the air be excluded ; meat, in a cold dry place, where the air is freely admitted; sugar and sweetmeats require a dry place, so does12 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. I. salt; candles, cold, but not damp; dried meats, bams, bacon, and tongues, the same. All sorts of seed for puddings, such as rice, &c., should be close covered, to preserve them from insects : but if kept long that will not be sufficient, unless they be occasionally sifted. Apples and pears should be laid upon very clean and dry straw, to prevent a musty taste; nor should they be exposed to either light or air, and the floor of a dark garret is a good place in which to deposit them; or, what is still better, shelves made by strips of wood, of about 2 inches wide, placed an inch and a half apart, and the apples laid be- tween them. They should be ranged singly in rows, without touching each other, and should be often inspected, both to wipe them, if damp, and to reject those which may appear to be getting rotten; but the larger sort of pears should be tied up by the stalk. Apples may also be preserved hi excel- lent condition for a long period by being packed in large bar- rels with dry sand, but require to be used immediately they are taken out. Coarse nets suspended in the store-room are very useful in preserving the finer kinds of fruit, lemons, &c., which are spoiled if allowed to touch. When lemons and oranges are cheap, a proper quantity should be bought and prepared, both for preserving the juice, and keeping the peel for sweetmeats and grating, especially by those who live in the country, where they cannot always be had; and they are perpetually wanted in cookery. The best way of scalding fruits, or boiling vinegar, is in a stone jar, on a hot iron hearth, or by putting the vessel into a saucepan of boiling water, called a water-bath, after its having been closely corked, but not quite filled, as the heat may occasion the fruits to swell; but if they diminish after this is done, the vessel must then be filled. Onions, shallots, and garlic should be hung up, for winter use, in ropes from the ceiling; as should dried parsley, basil, savory, and hnotted-marjoram, or London-tliyme, and tarra- gon, to be used when herbs are ordered, but with discretion, as they are very pungent.Chap. I.] HINTS ON DOMESTIC ECONOMY. 13 When whites of eggs are used for jelly, or other purposes, contrive to have pudding', custard, &c., to employ the yolks also ; and when only the yolks are wanted, the whites can be made with milk into blancmange. Should you not want them for several hours, beat them up with a little water, and put them in a cool place, or they will be hardened and useless. It was a mistake of old to think that the whites made cakes and puddings heavy; on the contrary, if beaten long and sepa- rately, they contribute greatly to give lightness, and are also an advantage to paste.14 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY.

Although carving with ease and elegance is a very neces- sary accomplishment, yet most people are lamentably deficient not only in the art of dissecting winged game and poultry, but also in the important point of knowing the parts most generally esteemed. Practice only can make good carvers; but the directions here given, with accompanying plates, will enable any one to disjoint a fowl and avoid the awkwardness of disfiguring a joint. In the first place, whatever is to be carved should be set in a dish sufficiently large for turning it if necessary ; but the dish itself should not be moved from its position, which should be so close before the carver as only to leave room for the plates. The carving-knife should be light, sharp, well- tempered, and of a size proportioned to the joint, strength being less required than address in the manner of using it. Large solid joints, such as ham, fillet of veal, and salt beef, cannot be cut too thin ; but mutton, roast pork, and the other joints of veal, should never be served in very slender slices. A Round (buttock) or Aitch-bone of Beef.—Pare off from the upper part, of either, a slice from the whole sur- face, of about h an inch thick, and put it aside; then cut thin slices of both lean and fat, in the direc- tion from a to b. The soft fat, which resembles marrow, lies at the back of the aitch-bone, below c, Aitch-bone of-Beef.Chap. II.] 15 CARTING. but the firm fat must be cut in slender horizontal slices at a, and is much better than the soft when eaten cold. Ribs of Beef—Cut along the whole length of the bone, from end to end, a to b, either commencing in the centre or at one side, having the thin end towards you ; but if cut from the bone and formed into a round, with the fat end doubled into the centre, it must then be cut in the same manner as the round of beef. Sirloin of Beef.—Cut in the same manner as the ribs, commencing either at the centre or the side, as from a to b. The under part should be cut across the bone, as at c for the lean, and d for the rich fat'; many persons prefer the under to the upper part, the meat being more tender. Fillet of Veal.—Carve it in the same manner as the round of beef; but the upper slice should be cut somewhat thinner, as most persons like a little of the brown, and a por- tion of it should be served along with each slice, to- gether with a slice of the fat and stuffing, which is skewered within the flap. Fillet of Teal. Neck of Veal.—-Cut across the ribs, as at a to b; the small bones, as at c to d, being cut off, divided, and served separately, for it is not only a tedi- ous but a vulgar operation to at- tempt to disjoint the ribs. Neck of Teal. Loin of Veal.—The joint is placed in the dish in the same16 [Chap. II. MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. manner as sirloin of beef, but should be turned up and the whole of the kidney and fat cut out; the fat being- usually put upon a dry toast and served as marrow. The loin is then returned to its former position, and the meat should be cut across the ribs as in the neck, serving it with a slice of kidney. Breast of Veal, being very gristly, is not easily divided into pieces. In order, therefore, to avoid this difficulty, put your knife at a, about 4 inches from the edge of the thickest part (which is called “ the bris- ket ”), and cut through it to b, to separate it from the long ribs; cut the short bones across,as at d,d,d, and the long ones as at c, c, c; ask which is chosen, and help accordingly. The remaining scrag part is seldom served at table, but forms an excellent stew when dressed in the French mode. Breast of Veal. Shoulder of Veal.—Cut in the same manner as a shoulder of mutton, beginning on the under side. Calf's Head.—Cut slices from a to b in the figure, which describes only half the head, letting the knife go close to the bone. Many like the eye, at c, which you must cut out with the point of your knife, and divide in two, along with some of the Calf’s Head. glutinous bits which surround it. If the jaw-bone be taken off, there will be found some fine lean, and under the head is the palate, which is reckoned a delicacy. The tongue and brains are dished separately, but served in small portions along with the head. Leg of Mutton.—The best part of a leg of mutton, whether boiled or roasted, is midway between the knuckle and the broad end. Begin to help there from the roundest and17 CARVING. Chap. II.] thickest part, by cutting to c. This part is the knuckle, which, in fine mutton, will be very tender, though dry. There are very fine slices in the back of the leg; there- fore, if the party be large, turn it up, and cut the broad end ; not across, in the direction you did the other side, but knuckle-bone. To cut slices, not most juicy too thin, from h down : but many prefer the Lesc of Mutton. longtvise, from the thick end to the out the cramp-bone, which some per- sons look upon as a delicacy, pass your knife under in the direction of e, and it will be found between that and d. Shoidder of Mutton, though commonly looked upon as a very homely joint, is by many preferred to the leg, as there is much variety of flavour, as well as texture, in both the upper and under parts. The figure represents it laid in the dish, as always served, with its back uppermost. Cut through it from a down to the blade-bone at b ; afterwards slice it .along each side of the blade-bone from c c to b. The prime part of the fat lies on the outer edge, and is to be cut in thin slices in the direction of d. The under part, as here represented, con- tains many favourite pieces of different sorts, as, crosswise, in slices, near the shank-bone at b ; and, lengthwise, in broad pieces, at the further end «; as well as in the middle and sides in the manner designated at c and Shoulder of Mutton.18 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. IE Should it be intended to reserve a portion of the joint to be eaten cold, all this undermost part should be first cut away and served separately, both as it eats better hot than cold, and as the upper remaining part will appear more sightly on the table. Loin of Mutton.—Cut the joints into chops and serve them separately ; or cut slices the whole length of the loin; or run the knife along the chine-bone, and then slice it, the fat and lean together, as shown in the cut of the saddle, below. Neck of Mutton.—It should be prepared for table as follows :—Cut otf the scrag ; have the chine-bone carefully sawn off, and also the top of the long bones (about 1C inch), and the thin part turned under; carve in the direction of the bones. The scrag of mutton, when roasted, is very frequently sepa- rated from the ribs of the neck, and in that case the meat and bones may be helped together. Saddle of Mutton.—Cut in long and rather thin slices from the tail to the end, beginning at each side close to the back- bone, from a to b, with slices of fat from c to d; or along the bone which divides the two loins, so as to loosen from it the whole of the meat from that side, which you then cut crosswise, thus giv- Saddle of Mutton. mg with each slice both fat and lean. The tail end is usually divided and partly turned up. Some butchers also skewer the kidneys across the incision, but it is not usual at genteel tables, and the inci- sion is better omitted. Haunch of Mutton.—A haunch is the leg and part of the loin, and is cut in the same manner as a haunch ol venison. Fore- Quarter of Lamb.—Pass the knife under the shoulder in the direction of a, c, b, d, so as to separate it from the ribs- without cutting the meat too much off the bones. A Seville orange or lemon should then be divided, the halves sprinkled with salt and pepper, and the juice squeezed over the under part.CAKVING. 19 Chap. II.] A little cold or melted butter is then put between both parts, after which the shoulder is placed in a separate dish to be helped by some other person. Divide the ribs from d to e, and then serve the neck f and breast g, as may be Fore-quarter of Lamb, chosen. Haunch of Venison.—Have the joint lengthwise before cut, and then the whole of the gravy will be received in the well. The greater part of the.,fat, which is the favourite portion, will be found at the left side, and care must be taken to serve some with each slice. Neck of Venison.—Cut across the ribs diagonally; or it may be cut in slices the whole length of the neck. The first method is ecpially good, and much more economical. Roebuck.—A species of venison but little known in this country, but which will in all probability be shortly brought by the steamers from the north of Europe. The animal is small, but the flesh, although, like hare, without fat, is very much esteemed as a delicacy. The common mode of serving it is to cut off the limbs, which are used in soups or stews, and to bring only the chine to table, cutting it in long slices from head to tail, and generally sufficient for a dozen people. The fawn, both of the roebuck and fallow-deer, is usually carved in the same manner. Kid.—Carved in the same manner as lamb when kept to be three or four months old ; but as the goat’s milk is in great c 2MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. II. 20 esteem, the little animals are usually killed at a few weeks old, and are then roasted whole. Pork.—In helping the roast loin and leg, your knife must follow the direction of the scores cut by the cook upon the skin which forms the crackling, as it is too crisp for being conveniently divided, and cannot therefore be cut across the bones of the ribs, as in loin of mutton. The scores upon the roasted leg are, however, always marked too broadly for single cuts ; the crackling must therefore be lifted up from the back to allow of thin slices being cut from the meat: the seasoning is under the skin at the larger end. Ham.—Serve it with the back upwards, sometimes orna- mented, and generally having, as in France, the shank-bone c covered with cut paper. Be- gin in the middle by cutting long and very thin slices from a to b, continuing down to the thick fat at the broad end. The first slice should be wedge-shaped, that all the others may be cut slanting, which gives a handsome ap- pearance to them. Many persons, however, prefer the hock at d, as having more flavour; it is then carved lengthwise from c to d. Hoiled Tongue should always be cut crosswise, not going through to the fat, which, if required, can be cut by putting the knife under. Sucking-pig.—The cook usually divides the body before it is sent to table—as thus—and garnishes the disli with the jaws and ears. Separate a shoulder from one side, and them the leg, according to the direction given by the line along the carcase.. The ribs are then to be divided ; and an ear or • jaw presented with them,. Roast Pig. and plenty of sauce and stuffing. The joints may either be divided into two each, or21 Chap. II.] CARVING. pieces may be cut from them. The ribs are reckoned the finest part; but some people prefer the neck end, between the shoulders. Hare.—Put the point of the knife under the shoulder at b, and so cut all the way down to the rump, 31011" the sides of the backbone, in the line b, a, cutting- it in moderately thick slices ; or, after removing- the shoulders and legs, cut the back crosswise in 4 or 5 pieces; but this can only be done when the hare is very young or when it is boned. To separate the legs and shoulders, put the knife between the leg and back, and give it a little turn inwards at the joint, which you must endeavour to hit, and not to break by force. The shoulders may be removed by a circular cut around them ; but, although called the “ sportsman’s portion,” are generally thought in- ferior, and are seldom served until the other parts have dis- appeared. The back is the most delicate part, and next to that the thighs. A portion of the stuffing should be served with each slice. The brains and ears of sucking-pig, hare, and rabbit, are also considered epicurean tit-bits, which must •not, be neglected ; wherefore, when every one is helped, cut off the head, put your knife between the upper and lower jaw and divide them, which will enable you to lay the upper flat on your plate ; then put the point of the knife into the centre, and cut the head into two. Roast Rabbits.—Proceed as for hare. Roiled Rabbits.—The legs and shoulders should be first taken off, and then the back cut across into 2 parts, which is easily done by a bend of the knife in the joint underneath, about the middle of the back. I lie back, as in the hare, is the best, and some of the liver should always accompany it.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap.

Boast Turkey.—Cut long slices from each side of the breast down to the ribs, beginning at a b from the wing to the breast- bone. If the party be so large as to ren- der it necessary, the legs may then be re- moved, and the thighs divided from the drum-sticks, which are only served in cases of necessity, as being rather tough; but the pinions of the wing are very savoury, and the white part of the wing is preferred by many to the flesh of the breast. The joint of the pinion may be found a little below b, and the whig may then be easily removed without touching the leg.

The commonly received idea, that what goes under the deno- mination of “ good plain living”—that is, joints of meat, roast or boiled—is best suited to all constitutions, has been proved to be a fallacy. Many persons can bear testimony to the truth of Dr. Kitchener’s remark, that elaborate culinary pro- cesses are frequently necessary in order to prepare food for the digestive organs, which are but too frequently taxed beyond their power. Indeed, it may be truly said that many persons actually lose their lives by over indulgence in food rendered indigestible by being badly cooked. Until a comparatively late period the art of cookery was almost in a state of infancy, for our ancestors were, with few , exceptions, content with the most simple, or rather, imperfect, preparation of their food, and “ made dishes” were very little known. Of late years, however, it has gradually risen to a branch of science, founded on practical experience, combined with a knowledge of chemistry; and the numerous works published on its improvement, both in this country and on the Continent, have brought it to a degree of perfection which its early professors never expected to attain. This remark applies, however, rather more to the cookery of animal than of vege- table food, for, in England, vegetables are chiefly used as an accompaniment to meat, while—as will be hereafter shown— many delicacies of the kitchen-garden may, if properly dressed, be rendered very palatable dishes to be eaten alone. It is our intention to endeavour to correct the prejudice in favour of a family joint—by showing, that it is not only very often improperly cooked, but that the same quantity of meat,29 Chap. III.] FOOD AND COOKERY. if dressed in different ways, still retaining a certain degree of simplicity, will be more pleasant to the palate, more healthful, and quite as economical, if brought to the table as two or three dishes instead of one. In French cookery, those substances which are not intended to be broiled or roasted, are usually stewed for several hours at a temperature below the boiling-point; by which means the most refractory articles, whether of animal or vegetable origin, are more or less reduced to a state of pulp, and admirably adapted for the further action of the stomach. In the common cookery of this country, on the contrary, articles are usually put at once into a large quantity of water, and sub- mitted, without care or attention, to the boiling temperature: the consequence of which is, that most animal substances, when taken out, are harder and more indigestible than in the natural state.

[Chap. III. from its effects. When people sit down to table with a good appetite, it is difficult to persuade them to eat only half the quantity for which they feel disposed; but it is very certain that, in order to escape the horrors of indigestion, plain roast or boiled meat should be very sparingly consumed. Partly upon the erroneous supposition that it is the most wholesome species of food, and partly to avoid the trouble of providing anything else, a whole family, however various their consti- tutions may be, are seated at table before a single joint, to take their chance of suffering from the repletion which even a small portion may occasion to a delicate person, who could have partaken of three or four judiciously-dressed dishes with- out sustaining the slightest inconvenience. The stomach, in fact, never performs its duties so effectually as when it acts upon food composed of much variety. Indeed the united testimony of high medical authority proves that a variety of well-dressed food is more easy of digestion, and conse- quently more salutary, than when the meal is confined to one sort of solid meat. Foreigners are so well aware of this, that thev never dine on a single dish. They always commence the meal with soup, or rather weak potage, followed by some small dishes of meat and vegetables, thoroughly done and eaten separately; and although they usually eat full as much as the English, yet their dinner sits light upon the stomach, without any com- plaint of that drowsy sense of indigestion of which we hear so much in England, that our newspapers are filled with adver- tisements for its cure. In England, cookery in small respectable families, where it is necessary to study economy, has also to contend with a prejudice concerning the vulgarity of certain viands ; many portions of an animal, which in France are in great esteem, being rejected in this country upon very insufficient grounds. The very coarsest joints may be so refined in the culinary process as to retain nothing offensive either to the eye or the palate, while the vulgarity must consist in the manner in which the viands are served, and not in the viands themselves. It is the- province of the cook to render unsightly objects pleasing; and thus many things maybe brought to table in disguise, which would not be admissible in their original forms. A good housekeeper will never offer the first essay of her cook to her company : the dish should be tried by the family party, and31 FOOD AND COOKERY. Chap. III.] not placed before guests until practice has rendered it perfect. By this means the chances of failure are in a great measure avoided; and, by not undertaking more than can be accom- plished, success may be contemplated with some degree of confidence. Indeed, if any of the present receipts are put into the hands of an intelligent woman, she will find no difficulty in carrying them completely into effect. The foundation of all good cookery consists in preparing the. meat so as to render it tender in substance, without ex- tracting from it those juices which constitute its true flavour, in doing which, the main point in the art of making those soups, sauces, and made dishes of every sort, which now form so large a portion of every well-ordered dinner, as well, also, as in cooking many of the plain family joints—is boiling, or rather stewing, which ought always to be performed over a slow fire. There is, in fact, no error so common among all English cooks as that of boiling meat over a strong fire, which renders large joints hard and partly tasteless; while, if sim- mered during nearly double the time, with less than half the quantity of fuel and water, and never allowed to “ boil up,” the meat, without being too much done, will be found both pliant to the tooth and savoury to the palate. For instance. The most common and almost universal dish throughout France, is a large piece of plainly-boiled fresh beef, from which the soup—or “potcige,” as it is there called— has been partly made, and which is separately served up as “ bouilli,” accompanied by strong gravy, and minced vege- tables, or stewed cabbage. Now this, as constantly dressed in the French mode, is ever delicate both in fibre and flavour; while, in the English manner of boiling it, it is almost always hard and insipid. The reason of which, as explained by that celebrated cook, Careme, who superintended the kitchen of His Majesty George IV., is this:—“ The meat, instead of being put down to boil, as in our method, is there put in the pot with the usual quantity of cold water, and placed at the corner of the fireplace, where, slowly becoming hot, the heat gradually swells the muscular fibres of the beef, dissolving the gelatinous substances therein contained, and disengaging that portion which chemists term ‘ osmazome,’ and which imparts savour to the flesh—thus botli rendering the meat tender and palatable, and the broth relishing and nutritive; whilst, on the contrary, if the pot be inconsiderately put upon32 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. III. too quick a fire, the boiling is precipitated, the fibre coagu- lates and hardens, the osmazome is hindered from disengaging itself, and thus nothing is obtained but a piece of tough meat, and a broth without taste or succulence.” To stew.—This wholesome and economical mode of cookery is not so well understood nor profited by in England as on the Continent. So very small a quantity of fuel is wanted to sus- tain the gentle heat which it requires, that this alone should recommend it to the careful housekeeper ; but if properly at- tended to, meat stewed gently in close-shutting or luted vessels is in every respect equal, if not superior, to that which is roasted, but it must be simmered only, and in the gentlest manner. On the subject of stewing meat the following hint may be advantageously adopted:—“ Take a piece of boiling-beef, with some fat to it and a little seasoning, but without water, gravy, or liquid of any sort. Put it in an earthen jug closely covered, and place that within a large iron or tin pot filled with cold water, and lay it so near the fire as to keep a gentle simmer, without letting it boil. It will require several hours, accord- ing to the weight of the meat, which should be stewed until quite tender. It loses nothing, and will yield a large quantity of the richest gravy, as retaining the whole of its juice, and is decidedly the best mode of dressing that universal French dish, bceuf-bouilli.” a To roast in perfection is not only a most difficult but a most essential branch of cookery, and can only be acquired by practice, though it consists in simply dressing the joint thoroughly, without drying up any portion of its juices. If this, however, be not strictly attended to, the meat will be spoiled, and the error cannot be rectified. A brisk, but not too strong, fire, should be made up in good time, and care taken that it is sufficiently wide to take in the joint, leaving two or three inches to spare at each end, and of 'equal strength throughout. The fat should be protected by covering it with oiled paper, tied on with twine. I he meat should not be put very near the fire at first, or the outside will become scorched, dry, and hard, while the inside will be underdone ; but it should be put gradually nearer to the fire when about warmed through, or it will become soddened, and the screen should be placed before it from the commencement. a Transactions of the Iioyal Society of Agriculture, vol. iii. p. 88.33 Chap. III.] FOOD AND COOKERY. The more the meat is basted the better it will be when dressed, and the cook should not be sparing of her trouble in this re- spect. She should remove the paper a short time before sending the joint to table, sprinkling it with salt, and dredging it lightly with flour, in order to give it a savoury brown appear- ance ; but do not put salt to it before it is nearly dressed, as it would tend to draw out the gravy. Meat which has been fresh killed will take a longer time to roast than that which has been kept any time; and in warm weather twenty minutes less time should be allowed for the roasting of a good-sized joint than when the weather is cold. Time, distance, basting often, and a clear fire of a proper size for what is required, are the first points of a good cook’s attention in roasting. In preparing meat for roasting by smoke-jack, the cook must be careful that the spit be wiped before it is used, and also when withdrawn from the meat, or its mark will appear in a black stain. She must avoid running the spit through the prime parts.® In some joints, as necks, it may enter two bones from the end, run up the back until it comes to nearly the other end, and the prime of the meat will not be pierced. Leaden skewers of different weights should be in readiness, for want of which unskilful servants are often at a loss at the time of spitting. Cradle-spits answer best; they may be bought of different sizes. The joints of all necks and loins should be nicked before they are dressed. After the cook has taken up the roast meat, she should pour the fat from the dripping-pan into a basin previously wetted with cold water. 1 he next day, when cold, she should scrape off the fine meat-jelly which will be found adhering to the under part, and put it in a suitable vessel for present use, as an assistant to gravies. The dripping then should be melted and strained. If required to be kept long, it should be strained into cold water, and taken off when cold in cakes, and these cakes laid between sheets of writing-paper in a dry place. So much depends upon the taste of parties in the mode of over or under dressing, that it is difficult to say how long a joint of meat of a certain size should be roasted; but, pre- suming that a good fire is kept up, and that the meat is intended to be well done, a piece of beef—say of 12 to 15 lbs. * Tliese ru,es ai'e equally applicable to the hook used in the bottle-jack. I»MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. III. 34 weight—should, in winter, be properly roasted in from 3 to 34 hours. The common rule is, 4 of an hour to each lb.; but a thick joint—such, for instance, as a sirloin of beef or leg of mutton—will require rather more time than the ribs or shoulder ; and meat that has been hung for some days requires less roasting than that which has been newly killed ; mutton, somewhat less than beef; but veal, pork, and all sorts of white meat, should be so thoroughly roasted as not to show any appearance of red gravy. Some cooks recommend a method of roasting joints of meat in a slow manner, before a large fire, and placing them at a much greater distance from the fire than in the common way ; on the principle, as they say, “ that it renders the meat more tender, and better retains the gravy.” This, however, we deny ; for it does not retain more of the gravy, and it makes the flesh soft and insipid or flabby, instead of imparting to it that degree of crispness which is caused by the ordinary mode. It also has the further disadvantage of occasioning double the expenditure of coals, and requiring twice the usual time. But we admit, that, if the joint be very large, this method should be adopted when it is first put to the fire, putting it nearer by degrees. To boil.—All meat for boiling should be entirely covered with cold water, and placed on a moderate fire, the scum being carefully taken off as it rises, winch will be in general a few minutes before it boils. This should be done with great care, as, if neglected, the scum will sink and adhere to the joint, giving it a very disagreeable appearance. The kettle ■ should be kept covered. It cannot be too strongly urged upon a cook, the great advantage of gentle simmering over the usual fast boiling of meat, by which the outside is hardened and deprived of its juices before the inside is half done. Pickled or salted meat requires longer boiling than that which is fresh. A fish-plate, or some wooden skewers, should be put under a large joint to prevent its sticking to the bottom i of the boiler. To broil.—A cinder-fire, or one partly made of coke and charcoal, clear of all appearance of smoke, is indispensable;: and chops, steaks, or cutlets of all kinds—if intended to be eaten in their plain state—should be dressed after every other: dish is ready, and sent up to table last, so as to secure theirFOOD AND COOKERY. 35 Chap. III.] being hot: thus it may be observed that in “ steak-dinners ” the second course is always the best—as being dressed while the first is being eaten. The gridiron should be kept so clean as to be nearly polished, and should be always warmed before the meat is put upon it, as well as greased to prevent the steak from being burned. A fork should never be used in turning them, but a pair of steak-tongs. To fry.—The principle of this art is “to scorch something solid in oil or fat.” To do this it is necessary that the fat be in such condition as to scorch whatever is put into it; for if the substance fried does not burn, it must soak and become greasy. After the substance is immersed in the fat the pan may be removed a little off the fire, as otherwise the outside will become black before the inside is done. When you wish fried things to look as well as possible, do them twice over with egg and crumbs. Bread that is not stale enough to grate quite fine will not look well. The fat you fry in must always be boiling-hot the moment the meat is put in, and kept so till finished ; a small quantity never fries well. Suet.—When sirloins of beef, or loins of veal or mutton, are brought in, part of the suet may be cut off for puddings, or to clarify. Chopped fine and mixed with flour, if tied down in ajar, it will keep 10 days or a fortnight. If there be more suet than will be used while fresh, throw it into pickle, made in the proportion of i lb. of salt to a quart of cold water, and it will be as good afterwards for any use, when soaked a little. If the weather permit, meat eats much better for hanging a day before it is salted. Boiling in a well-floured cloth will make meat white. Cloths for this purpose should be carefully washed, and boiled in clean water between eacli using, and not suffered to hang in a damp place, which would give a bad flavour to the meat. The same applies to tapes and pudding-cloths. All kitchen utensils should be kept in the nicest order, and in a conspi- cuous part of the offices. The more soups or broth are skimmed, the better and clearer they will be. In these, as well as in boiling meat, particular care must be taken that this is done the moment before it boils, otherwise the foulness will be dispersed over the meat. Vegetables should never be dressed with meat, except car- rots or parsnips with boiled beef. d 236 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. III. Old meats do not require so much dressing as young; not that they are sooner done, but they can be eaten with the gravy more in. Hashes and Minces should never boil, as their doing so makes the meat hard. The gravy should be thoroughly made before the meat is put in. Dripping, or clarified suet, will baste everything as well as butter, except fowls and game; and for kitchen pies nothing else should be used. Mutton-dripping cannot, however, be used in cookery, as it communicates to everything a taste of tallow. A piece of writing-paper should be twisted round the bone at the knuckle of a leg or shoulder of lamb, mutton, or veni- son, when roasted, before it is served. Seasoning.—The art of seasoning properly is a difficult one, which can only be acquired by experience. The cook tastes her preparations instead of employing the scales ; and, where the quantities are indefinite, it is impossible to adjust the exact proportions of spice or other condiments which it will be neces- sary to add in order to give the proper flavour: the great art being so to blend the ingredients that one shall not predominate over the other. In the following, and indeed all other receipts, though the quantities of each ingredient may be as accurately directed as possible, yet much must be left to the discretion of the person who uses them. The different tastes of people require more or less of the flavour of spices, salt, garlic, butter, &c., which can never be ordered by general rules. A servant anxious to please will take all possible pains to ascertain the tastes of those she serves, and will be guided by that in the preparation of her dishes, though it may be opposed to her previous prac- tice. The proper articles should be at hand, and she must proportion them until the true zest be obtained, and a variety of flavour be given to the different dishes. A very general error among English cooks is the too profuse use of salt and pepper, by which ragouts and soups are very frequently spoiled ; for although some portion of both must be put in at first, to counteract the rawness which would otherwise prevail, as most spices require to be submitted to the action of fire in order to bring out their true flavour, yet either can be easily added by those partakers of the dish who prefer more of oneChap. III.] FOOD AND COOKERY. 37 or the other ; and perhaps the only dishes that should be highly seasoned are meat-pies and curries. As a general rule, it may be said that no mixture should be made without a small por- tion of salt ; thus, in the flour for pastry, a certain quantity, not exceeding a saltspoonful, will be necessary, and all sweet things require a little ; but the cook must be careful not to exceed the just limit. If sprinkled upon meat which is to be fried or broiled, it renders it hard. Cayenne is in general so unsparingly thrown into soups of almost every description, that persons of a delicate appetite can seldom eat them. Chili vinegar imparts both the heat of cayenne and the flavour of acid, and, if used with moderation, forms a good condiment; but no species of sauce, or artificial zest, should supersede that of the meat. Nor should they, if liquid, be used until after the meat has been stewed: even wine, if put into soup, should not be added until nearly the last thing, when a wineglassful will go as far in flavouring as a pint if put in at the commencement: if the cook has not a nice palate, a cupful of the soup should be presented to her mistress to decide upon the necessary additional ingredients. But all condiments of a solid nature—such as whole peppers, ginger, mace, and cinnamon, or savoury herbs, truffles, and mushrooms—require the action of fh’e to draw out their flavour: the cook, therefore, should know from experience the ‘ quantity of each which may be necessary. She should never forget that the zest imparted to both soups and sauces mainly arises from a judicious mixture of the articles with which they are seasoned : a well-regulated palate in their choice, and a delicate hand in their distribution, are therefore essential in a good cook. The following maxims for cooks may be found useful:— 1. Look clean; be careful and nice in work, so that those who have to eat might look on. 2. Never forget, while preparing a dish, that what you pro- duce has presently to be eaten, relished, or condemned, to your honour or to your discredit. 3. Whatever can be tasted during the process of preparation must be flavoured by the judgment of the palate. Whatever may not be tasted before serving must be done strictly and invariably by rule. 4. Though a rule has been long established, there is no38 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. III. reason why improvement or advantageous change should not be made. The combinations and changes in cookery by means of the same materials are endless, therefore always think. 5. Cooks must please the palate; but it is necessary they should likewise suit the stomach ; want of skill ultimately brings upon them reproach instead of praise. 6. A judicious use of salt will do wonders for the credit of a cook. The flavours which result from it cannot be traced to a cause ; the cook has therefore the whole of the credit—the condiment none. The same applies to the use of condiments and flavours in general; whenever a particular taste predominates, the merit is attributed to the ingredient, and not to the cook. 7. The cook who attends to the niceties of the art is a superior servant; but if ignorant or neglectful, is worthless. There are three arts very essential in good cooking ; these are honing, larding, and braising. They are not difficult to acquire, so that there is little or no excuse for their neglect in the kitchens of private families ; but we may truly assert that not one cook in a hundred knows anything of boning, and very few of even the simple operation of larding; if, therefore, the family resides in town, the better way is always to have these matters performed by the poulterer ; for if a joint of meat— as, for instance, a shoulder of mutton—is to be boned, the butcher cannot do it so well. Boning, besides its other advantages, is particularly recom- mended, on account of its economy: the bones of turkeys, fowls, hares, &c., assisting to make gravy, while they are nearly useless when left in the bodies of the animals: a boned fowl also, rendered solid by stuffing, will go much further than when dressed in the common way. Hares should always be boned, for the sake of the improvement in their appearance, and being so much more easily carved. In the hiring of a cook by persons resident in the country, it is therefore essential to ascertain whether she is mistress of that art; for as to teaching her by printed directions, it would be time thrown away, and she can only acquire it by practice; but it may be learned by a few lessons from the poulterer. Larding should be neatly done to be ornamental; but the same effect, with respect to flavour, may be produced by raising the skin and laying a slice of fat bacon beneath it; andChap.

Larding is not only commonly employed on poultry and game, but so frequently on many other dishes also that every cook ought to be acquainted with the mode of performing it. It is done by cutting the firmest part of the bacon-fat into small strips, proportioned in length and thickness to the size of the article to be larded; and these u lardoons,” as they are called, are inserted, in rows, into punctures made in the surface of the flesh, by a larding-pin, in one end of which the bacon is held. It is, in fact, very simple, requiring only prac- tice and perseverance to become an adept. To lard Meat, Fowls, Sweetbreads, §c.—Have ready lard- ing-pins of different sizes, according to the article to be done; cut slices of bacon into bits of a proper length, quite smooth, and put into a larding-needle to suit it, with which pierce the skin and a very little of the meat, leaving the bacon in, and the two ends of equal length out- wards. Lard in rows the size you think fit. The Larding Needle. with Lardoon inserted. To braise.—Put the meat you would braise into a stewpan, and cover it with thick slices of fat bacon ; then lay round it six or eight onions, a faggot of sweet herbs, some celery, and, if to be brown, some thick slices of carrots, and trimmings of any fresh meat-bones you have, with a pint and a half of water, or the same quantity of stock (which you will find directed under the head of Soups and Gravies), according to what the meat is, and add seasoning. Cover the pan close, and set it over a slow stove ; it will require two or three hours, as its size and quality may direct. Then strain the gravy; keep the meat quite hot; take the fat off by plunging the basin into cold water, which will cause the fat to coagulate; and boil it as quickly as yon can till it thickens. If, however, you wish the gravy to Braising Pot. adhere to the meat, it must be still further thickened; then40 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap.

The Glazing Brush. o,aZe should be a clear ye]low brown. Many persons have been deterred from attempting this excellent method of cooking numerous articles on account of the expensive way usually prescribed. Should there be nothing else at hand, the meat or fowl to be braised may be put into a stewpan, with about an ounce of fresh butter, or a larger quantity according to the size, and a teacupful of water. Stir these together for a short time, and shake the pan occasionally until the juices of the meat or poultry afford sufficient gravy ; put in an onion and a bunch of sweet herbs, with a little pepper or other seasoning, and a small quantity of salt. The meat must be turned several times during the period of braising the veal, as the English apparatus does not often admit of fire being placed on the top of the stewpan. When about to be brought to table, the gravy of braised meat should be cooled by placing the vessel containing it in cold water; the fat removed; the gravy then strained, thickened, heated, and sent up with forcemeat-balls, egg-balls, fried paste, or all three; and mushrooms, or any other vegetables, cut into ornamental shapes: or the gravy may be boiled down to a glaze, and poured over the meat: send to table on a puree of vegetables. To glaze, without braising.—Fowls or meat may be dressed in any way chosen, without bacon, and a gravy, boiled to a glaze, brushed over, as above. When several dishes are to be glazed, a sufficient quantity should be prepared, and the glazing- pot kept hot by putting it into hot water. Hams, tongues, and stewed beef, to eat cold, are thus done. To force Fowls, Sfc., is to stuff them with forcemeat, either between the skin and the flesh ; or, the breast- Glazing Pot. bone being raised, the cavity is filled up; or, the breast-bone being taken out, the body is filled.41 Chap. III.] FOOD AND COOKERY. Tongues, palates, &c., are said to be blanched, when, after long boiling, the skin can be peeled otf; and the latter will become thicker by being put into cold water afterwards. To keep meat hot, it is best to take it up when done, though the company may not be come; set the dish over a pan of boiling water, or in the bain-marie, as described in Chapter IV., on Culinary Utensils; else, put a deep tin cover over it so as not to touch the meat, and then throw a cloth over that. This way dries the gravy less than hot hearths of iron; but in whatever way the heat be preserved, it is a very essential article in serving a dinner, and every requisite should be allowed for the purpose. The most effectual way is in a warm closet, which is now made so as to be heated by the steam from the boiler attached to most kitchen ranges.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. IV. 42 CHAPTER IV.

Besides those improved ranges which are furnished with ovens, boilers, stewing-stoves, and hot-plates, every kitchen- grate should be encircled by a large fender containing a broad plate of iron for the support of small articles to be kept warm, and supplied with forks and hooks, fixed to it, for the toasting of bread or bacon, and the occasional dressing of a mutton- chop.

A nearly similar machine, also moved by self- acting springs, has been brought forward as an improvement, as it can act on two spits at the same time; but they both have this objection—that confining the air has partly the effectChap.

The jack costs from 12a. to 15a., and the screens from 15a. to 25a. each. Digesters.—Various steam-kettles, known to cooks as u con- jurers,” ought to be kept in every kitchen, and used at intervals when the fire is not otherwise engaged. Into one of these a digester is put, with a quantity of water just sufficient to cover the ingredients to be acted upon ; and into it are also to be put all the scraps of meat which are usually thrown away, together with the bones of all the meat daily dressed and consumed during the week—from the bones of a leg of mutton to that of a mutton-chop, and those of fowls, whether left upon a dish or a plate. Fastidious ladies will probably be shocked at the idea of again bringing such matters to table, but they should recollect that the bones are only scraped with a knife. , Bones may be purchased from the butchers for a. few44 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY.

Indeed, economical persons purchase bones of the butcher, and by stewing them many hours procure an excellent stock; and families to whom expense is an object will do well to make the experiment. Conjurers, though different in appearance, yet act upon the same principle by means of steam, and will heat any liquid in a few minutes; but being made of tin, they are not so effectual as Papin's Digester, which is formed of iron, and of such power as to extract strong jelly from the bones of meat, and to reduce “ those of small, young fowls to a pulp.” The cut contains two figures; both, however, on the same principle, and made of cast-iron; No. 1 being of the smaller No. 1.

The chief, and indeed the only thing necessary to be done, is to direct a proper mode of using it to most advantage, and this mode is both simple and easy. Care must be taken, in filling the digester, to leave room tt They may be found at Fentham’s, Clifford-street, and most of the furnishing ironmongers’.45 Chap.

This may be done by filling the digester only three parts full of water and bruised bones or meat, which it is to be noticed are all put in together. It must then be placed near a slow fire, so as only to simmer, for the space of eight or ten hours, as more heat injures the quality. After this has been done, the soup is to be strained through a hair sieve or colander, in order to separate any bits of bones. The soup is then to be again put into the digester; and, after whatever vegetables and seasoning are thought necessary are added, the whole is to be well boiled together for an hour or two, and it will be then fit for immediate use.

The bain-marie is a very shallow cistern placed on a hot hearth, and generally made of copper, for containing hot water to keep soups and sauces warm, but may occa- sionally be used for keeping dishes warm. It is the best mode of keeping anything hot which has been suffi- .ciently dressed, but not ready to be sent to table; se the dish, if covered and placed in it, may be thus kept perfactly warm, without being scorched as it would be if put before the fire.

If allowed to boil, the meat will harden, or the sauce will be reduced and become thick : by avoiding these chances the flavour will be preserved, and the viands may be warmed up more than once without injury. The steam-apparatus now employed in most kitchens is admirably adapted to this purpose, since the heat can be regulated to the required temperature. Steam Fireplace. Hot Closet. A spacious moveable screen, large enough to completely cover the fire, lined throughout with tin, and having shelves for the warming of plates and dishes, should also be an ap- pendage ; and there should be an abundance of kitchen utensils of the best kind, kept in their proper places and strictly clean. Cleanliness is, indeed, of the first importance, and no kitchen- maid should ever put away a metal saucepan which has been used for any other purpose than merely boiling pure water, without scalding it thoroughly and then drying it. On the Continent many of the most useful kitchen utensils are made of glazed crockery-ware—such as pipkins for melting butter, boiling milk, and making sauces; as well as deep belly- formed jars and pans of different sizes for the stewing of meat and making of soups, as being more easily kept sweet than those of tin or copper ; and, if the same system were more followed in this country, it would secure the delicacy of many dishes which are spoiled by being cooked in vessels which have im- bibed a sour or musty flavour.'1 However, if copper utensils n They may now be had at Burton and Rippon’s shop in Oxford Street, and at many other furnishing ironmongers’.47 CULINARY UTENSILS. Chap. IV.] be used in the kitchen, the cook should be charged to be very careful not to let the tin be rubbed off, and to have them fresh tinned when the least defect appears,* as well as never to put by any soup, gravy, or sauce in them, or any metal utensil; stone and earthen vessels should be provided for those purposes. Independently of these articles, every kitchen should be provided with a clock to keep the cook to her time; also with a large and a small marble mortar for the pounding of meat, with chopper, meat-saw, various-sized scoops for vegetables, when required for haricos, &c., paste-cutters, steak-tongs, &c., and those insignificant, though useful little articles, minute- glasses, to regulate the boiling of an egg ; nor should a spice- box, containing whole pepper, mace, nutmegs, and cinnamon, be forgotten; together with various dried sweet herbs. As accuracy in apportioning the ingredients to be used is indis- pensable to the success of cookery, scales, with weights from 1 oz. to 2 lbs., should be placed on the dresser, and the weights carefully kept in regular order. A set of tin measures with small spouts or lips, and with the contents distinctly marked , upon them, from a gallon Scales, down to half a gill, will also be found very convenient. It is likewise well to have a set of wooden measures, from a bushel to a quarter of a peck. Let it be remembered, that, of liquid measure— Two gills are half a pint. Two pints are one quart. Four quarts arc one gallon. Of dry measure— Half a gallon is a quarter of a peck. One gallon is half a peck. Two gallons are one peck. Four gallons are half a bushel. Eight gallons are one bushel. About twenty-five drops of any thin liquid will fill a common-sized tea- spoon. " This is so essential a point that the mistress herself should occasionally examine if it is necessary to be done.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. IY. 48 Four tablespoonfuls, or half a gill, will fill a common wine-glass. Four wine-glasses will fill a half-pint or common tumbler, or a large coffee-cup. A quart black bottle holds in reality about a pint and a half. Of flour, butter, sugar, and most articles used in cakes and pastry, a quart is generally about equal in quantity to a pound avoirdupois (sixteen ounces). Avoirdupois is the weight designated throughout this book. Ten eggs generally weigh one pound before they are broken. A tablespoonful of salt or brown sugar is generally about one ounce. Sieves, of various descriptions, are very essential. Every utensil for cookery should be of various sizes, so as to suit the quantity of which the dishes may be composed; and each should be kept in a fixed place, as well as washed and dried immediately after using. The cook should also be charged to take care of jelly-bags, tapes for the collared things, &c., which, if not perfectly scalded and kept dry, give an un- pleasant flavour when next used.Chap. V.] FOREIGN TERMS USED IN COOKING. 49 CHAPTER Y. FOREIGN TERMS USED IN COOKING. French cookery is of so diverse a nature that many volumes have already been written upon the subject; and new modes of dressing the same things are so constantly being invented, that we must content ourselves with merely giving a few explana- tions of the terms adopted by most of our professed cooks. Bain-Marie.—A vessel with a loose bottom to contain hot water, in which sauces may be kept hot to nearly the boiling- point without their burning or being reduced. Bard.—A slice of thin bacon fat, used for covering the breasts of birds, the back of a hare, or any substance that re- quires the assistance of fat where larding is not preferred. Beignet, or Fritter.—Anything that is enveloped in a casing of batter or egg, and fried. Thus we have fritters of fruit, vegetables, cream, &c. Blanc.—A white broth used to improve the colour of chickens, lamb, &c. Blanch.—To set anything on the fire in cold water, and when it boils strain it off and plunge it into cold water. Blanquettes.—A kind of fricassee, made of slices of white meat cut thin, and warmed in white sauce thickened with the yolk of eggs. Bouilli.—Beef very much boiled and served witli sauce. Bouillon.—The common soup of France. Braise.—A mode of stewing veal, &c., in a closely-covered stewpan, so as to prevent evaporation, whilst the meat retains not only its own juices but those of other articles which may be put with it, such as bacon, herbs, roots, and spice. Callipash.—The glutinous meat of the upper shell of a turtle. Callipee.—The glutinous meat of the under shell of a turtle. Caramel.—Sugar boiled down until the water is evaporated, E50 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chai>. Y. and then formed in ornamental devices for decorating gateaux- baskets, &c. It is also used for colouring gravies when re- duced almost to the burning-point, and then dissolved in water. Its use is not much to the credit of the cook. Casserole.—A rice-crust moulded in the form of a pie ; when baked, filled with a mince or puree of game, or with a blan- quette of white meat. Also a stewpan. Compote.—Stewed fruits served with syrup. There are also compotes of pigeons and other small birds. Consomme is a strong clear gravy, drawn from the long stewing of any kind of meat, to be either used as broth, or made into soups and sauces. Coulis, or cullis, is a rich brown gravy commonly used for the purpose of colouring as well as thickening and flavouring many sorts of soups and sauces. It is made in various ways, chiefly upon a foundation of ham and veal, slices of which are put into a closely covered stewpan, with only a small quantity of water, and boiled over a brisk fire until the whole becomes brown and thick. See Sauces. Croquettes.—A mince of either fish, meat, or poultry, made very savoury, with a small quantity of sauce, formed into shapes of any kind, rolled in egg and bread-crumbs, and fried crisp. Croustades, or Dresden patties, made of paste in small moulds, and filled with mince of any kind. Crouton.—A sippet of bread fried and used for garnish. u E%papillate.”—To oil or butter a piece of paper, which is fastened round the cutlet, &c., by twisting it along the edge. Entree.—A corner dish for the first course. In large din- ners the side dishes are called jlancs. Entremet.—A side or corner dish for the second course. Farce.—Forcemeat. Faggot.—A small bunch of parsley and thyme and a bay- leaf tied up. Erica,ndeaux may be made of any boned piece of veal, in pieces of not more than 2 or 3 lbs. weight, chiefly cut from that portion of the fillet which we have described as the thick part. It is a frequent dish as an entree at good tables, and requires great care to serve in perfection.51 Chap. V.] FOREIGN TERMS USED IN COOKING. Gateau.—A cake or pudding. Glace or Glaze.—Stock boiled down to a consistency, and used to improve the appearance of all braised dishes ; it should be warmed in the bain-marie, and applied with a brush. Lardoon.—The piece of bacon used in larding. Liaison.—A mixture of cream and egg to thicken white soups, &c. Maigre.—Made without meat. Marinade.—A liquor prepared for boiling or stewing fish or meat in : it is sometimes used cold. Meringue.—A very light preparation of pastry, made of sugar and whites of eggs beaten to snow. Matelote.—A rich stew of fish with wine. Miroton consists of small slices of meat cut thin, and not larger than a crown-piece, and made into various sorts of ragouts ; and dished up in a circular form. Poele.e is employed in fine French cookery to boil fowls in, or other delicate preparations. The Pot-au-feu is truly the foundation of all good cookery, and of that we shall treat rather largely in our chapters on soups and sauces, which contain several foreign receipts; while in what we have said on cookery there may be found a brief notice on braising, larding, and boning, together with nume- rous practical hints throughout the work, to render any intelli- gent. woman a perfect cook and housekeeper. Puree.—A culinary operation which should be carefully Puree Presser.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. V. 52 attended to, and which, although known in this country for preparing potted meats and fish, is seldom employed by com- mon English cooks in anything but pea-soup. It consists in either pounding the meat or fish in a mortar until it becomes a paste, or in stewing roots or pulse in boiling water until they are softened into a thick pulp, when they are passed, first through a colander, or through a puree presser, and afterwards through a wire or hair sieve, or “ tammy,” and, being thinned with broth, may be formed into soups of various sorts. Quenelles and Godiveaux are different sorts of forcemeat, composed of meat or fish, with bread and yolk of egg, and fat of some kind ; seasoned in various ways, and either spread upon rolled meat, or formed into balls and fried as garnish to entrees, or served separately as entrees. To form Quenelles.—When the forcemeat is made, take 2 tablespoons, fill 1 with the meat, dip a knife in hot water, with which smooth it over ; then dip the other spoon into boiling water, and 'with it remove the meat from the first spoon, and slip it into a buttered stewpan ; so on until you have the number you want; then cover them with stock, and boil them about 10 minutes, or until firm, and they are fit for use. For small quenelles use teaspoons. Rissole.—A mince of meat or fish, enclosed in paste, or made up into shapes or balls in the manner of minced collops, and used either as side-dishes, or as a garnish for stews or hashes, now more elegantly termed fricassees and ragouts. Roux.—A thickening for white soups or gravy, made of flour and butter. Salmis.—A hash made of game, which is cut up when only half roasted; whereas a hash is made from dressed game. Saute.—Fried, and in some instances used nsfryingpan. Tamis, or u tammy,” a strainer of thin woollen canvas, used for straining soups and sauces, sold at all the Italian ware- houses.

Vol-au-vent is very light puff paste, cut either oval or round, and the interior cleared out, enclosing any delicate mince of sweetbread, game, or poultry ; it is frequently served at good tables. Hagout.—A rich sauce, with sweetbreads, mushrooms, truffles, quenelles, &c., in it; used as a garnish for entrees or removes.54 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VI, CPIAPTER VI.

It may be more matter of curiosity than of practical utility to cookery to show the modes of cutting1 up the joints of butcher’s- meat, as that is always clone at the shambles or in the butcher’s shop; but the appearance of the animal, as marked with the corresponding figures, will explain where each joint is to be found. There is, besides, a different method of cutting fol- lowed in Scotland and in England, which occasions the number, size, and name of the several joints to vary in the carcase. The above figure represents a bullock marked for cutting up on the English plan. Hind Quarter. 1. Sirloin. 2. Rump. 3. Aitchbone. 4. Buttock. 5. Mouse Buttock. 6. Veiny Piece. 7. Thick Flank. 8.

For instance, the rump and aitchbone, Nos. 2 and 3, in the first figure, are cut m such a manner that the meat affords a much better steak than when cut as in the second. The Scotch plan, on the other hand, gives more pieces for boiling; and thus each way seems suitable to the taste of the people who have respectively adopted them.” The sheep, as figured (p. 56), displays the usual manner of slaughtering in this country; but, for the different modes of cutting up Mutton, the two sides, as slaughtered, here repre- sent the Scotch and English methods; figure 1 being that of England, and figure 2 that of Scotland.

Pork, although from its common use among the lower classes of society regarded as a homely viand, is yet held in high estimation by many families of great respectability, who, living in the country, rear pigs for their own consumption ; and we know that “home-fed pork,” bred on Prince Albert’s farm at Windsor, frequently forms a dish, in the winter season, at the royal table. The usual mode of cutting up the pig is thus: 1. Fore Loin. 2. Hind Loin. Leg. 3. Belly or Snrino-. 4. Hand. *58 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VI. The head is not marked, but is much esteemed, when salted and smoked, as “ pig’s-face,” “cheek,” and “chaps;” and, when fresh, if made into soup. Buck and Doe Venison are cut up nearly like mutton.

Although respectable butchers may, in most cases, be relied upon for the goodness of the meat which they sell to regular customers, yet many persons (both ladies and gentlemen) go to market and choose for themselves, when, if not competent judges, the inferior sorts generally fall to their lot. In country towns, also, there are frequently but one or two market-days in the week ; and the meat being brought from a distance, it is an essential point of good housekeeping to be so well acquainted with the quality as not to be easily imposed upon." Formerly both sheep and oxen were reared to a mature age ; but graziers have since learned to bring them so early toMARKETING. 59 Chap. VI.] market, by means of artificial fatting, instead of the more natural mode of grass-feeding, that they are now killed at such early periods as to deprive the meat of much of its flavour. This is more especially the case with regard to mutton, which, when in perfection, ought not to be seen at table until the sheep are from 3 to 5 years old, whereas now they are gene- rally killed at less than half that age; and not unfrequently at 20 months old !—the consequence of which is, that they are neither lamb nor mutton. There is also great difference in the quality of the flesh of large and small animals of both kinds, of which the smaller will generally be found to be the best, as being reared upon short mountain pasture; while the Leicesters and other large breeds, which are fed upon rich land, become at an early age covered with fat. The beef of a small Highland ox, also, always fetches the highest price in Smithfield. Ox-beef should have a fine smooth open grain, be of a good red, and feel tender. The fat should look white rather than yellow, for, when that is of a deep colour, the meat is seldom good: beef fed on oil-cake is generally so, and the flesh is flabby. The best is that which is rather more than moderately fat, as being a proof that the animal was well fed; but never buy lean beef, as it will always prove tough, and so inferior as ■ to be dear at any price. The grain of cow-beef is closer, and the fat whiter, than that of ox-beef; but the lean is not of so bright a red. The grain of bull-beef is coarser and closer still, the fat hard and skiimy, the lean of a deep red, and it has a stronger scent. Ox-beef is the richest and largest; but in small families, and to some tastes, heifer-beef is preferred, if finely fed. In old meat, a streak of horn runs between the fat and lean of the sirloin and ribs; the harder this is, the older, and the flesh is not finely flavoured; that is to say, the horn has become so firm as to appear like bone: but oxen are always the better if kept until 5 or 6 years old. Ox-tongue.—To choose a neat’s tongue, it should be of a moderate size, plump, firm, and smooth to the touch ; for if the skin appears rough and shrivelled, it will be found hard and flavourless. Veal.—A great point to be observed in choosing veal is the size of the calf and the colour of the meat. It should be small, white, and the kidney well covered with fat. The flesh of aMODERN" DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VI. 60 bull-calf is firmest and most juicy, but not so white. The fillet of the cow-calf is generally preferred for the udder. If the bloody vein in the shoulder looks blue, or of a bright red, it is newly killed ; but any other colour shows it to be stale. The other parts should be dry and white; if clammy or spotted, the meat is stale and bad. The kidney turns first, and the suet will not then be firm. If allowed to live longer than eight or ten weeks old, the flesh becomes coarse. You will of course get it somewhat cheaper, and it may, to some palates, be found equally good in flavour, but not so delicate in either the colour or the texture of the flesh. Mutton.—Wether mutton is the only sort for a connoisseur’s table, and may be known by a knob of fat on the upper part of the leg, where, in ewe mutton, is the udder. The meat should be of a dark colour, and well covered with fat; and in the loin the lean should appear mottled. The flesh of the ewe is paler, and the texture finer, but neither the meat nor gravy so well flavoured as that of the wether, though a “ maiden ewe,” when it can be got, is considered particularly fine. If you wish to have a good haunch, choose one of small size and moderately fat, looking at the same time to the closeness of the grain and the whiteness of the fat; but more particularly see that the flesh is dark-coloured, that being a proof of age, and the older the better. In boiled mutton this is not of so much importance as in roasted. Lamb.—There are two sorts: “ house-lamb,” which is reared under cover upon ewe’s milk, and comes into season, as a great delicacy, at Christmas; and “grass-lamb” at Easter, conti- nuing in season during the whole of the summer, but losing much of its nicety of flavour after it reaches 4 months old. It ought therefore to be small and white in appearance, and well covered with fat: the younger the more delicate. In the Peninsula it is frequently killed at 6 weeks old, then roasted whole, and is extremely delicate. Pork.—The rind should be thin, the fat very firm, and the lean white: the principal point to be observed is the firmness of the fat. If the rind is tough, thick, and cannot easily be im- pressed by the finger, it is old. Pigs that are short in the legs and bodies, and have thick necks, and not long heads and ears, are always to be preferred. When fresh, the flesh will be smooth and dry ; if clammy, it is tainted. What is called61 MARKETING. Chap. VI.] “measly pork” is very unwholesome, and may be known by the fat being full of kernels. Pork fed at still-houses does not answer for curing- in any way, the fat being spongy. Dairy- pork is the best. Porkers from 3 to 4 months old are the most delicate, and 6 months is the latest age at which they should be killed as such. Bacon.—If the rind be thin, the fat firm and of a reddish tinge, the lean tender, of a good colour, and adhering to the bone, you may conclude it is good and not old. If there are yellow streaks in it, it is rusty. For hams, stick a sharp knife under the bone, and also up to the knuckle. If it comes out with a pleasant smell, the ham is good; but do not buy it if the knife has a bad scent. Hams short in the hock are best; nor should long-legged pigs be chosen for any purpose. Brawn.—The horny part of the young brawn will feel moderately tender, and the flavour will be better than the old, the rind of which will be hard. Venison.—The fat should be clear, bright, and thick ; and if the cleft of the haunch be smooth and close, it is young ; but if the cleft is close and tough, it is old. To judge of its sweetness, run a very sharp narrow knife into the shoulder or haunch, and you will know by the scent. Few people like it when it has much of the haut-gout; but it bears keeping better than any sort of meat, and if eaten fresh killed it is not so good as mutton. Observe the neck of a fore-quarter : if the vein be bluish, it is fresh ; if it have a green or yellow cast, it is stale. In the hind-quarter, if there is a faint smell under the kidney, and the knuckle is limp, the meat is stale. If the eyes be sunk, the head is not fresh. When you can learn where it has been reared, choose forest-venison, as that is the best; for some of the dealers stall-feed the deer, and fatten them with oil-cake. It shoiild be full 5 years old. The hack comes into season in May, and the meat continues in prime order until September when doc-venison is brought into use, and continues to Christ- mas. In every sort of provisions the best of the kind goes furthest cuts up to greatest advantage, and affords most nourishment! Round of beef, fillet of veal, and leg of mutton, are joints that bear a higher price; but as they have more solid meat,62 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VI. they deserve the preference. It is worth notice, however, that those joints which are inferior may be dressed as palatably, and, being cheaper, they ought to be bought in turn. In loins of meat, the long pipe that runs by the bone should be taken out, as it is apt to taint; as also the kernels of beef. Rumps and aitchbones of beef are often bruised by the blows the drovers give the beasts, and the part that has been struck always taints : therefore do not purchase these joints if bruised. All meat should be carefully examined, and wiped with a dry cloth as soon as it comes in; and if flies have blown upon it, the pax-t must be cut off. This should be daily observed until it is dressed, as it not only tends to preserve the meat long in perfection, but prevents that musty flavour too often perceived in the outer slice when brought to table. In the country, where meat is often carried a great distance, it should be well covered up with a cloth, over which fresh cabbage-leaves would keep it cool. These cautions are more ■ needful, as in some families great loss is sustained by the ■ spoiling of meat. The fly may in soiue measure be prevented! by dusting, upon the parts most likely to be attacked, pepper • and ginger mixed, after wiping, which should never be omitted; but a more easy and effectual mode is to exclude1 the fly by using a wire meat-safe, or to cover the joints withi a long loose gauze or thin cloth, and hang them up from the ceiling of an airy chamber. In summer meat should be wiped every day, or sprinkled with pepper to keep off the flies; and should it wear any appear- ance of becoming tainted, it should be brushed over with i pyroligneous acid ; or even if already slightly infected, either the acid or roughly-pounded charcoal, if well rubbed into the meat, will restore it. The meat should also be brought; in eai’ly in the morning, as, if much exposed to the sun, the heat will render it flabby. In frosty weather, meat is some- times in a congealed state, and should be thawed by soaking it in cold water before putting it to the fire. Meats become more tender, and consequently more digest- ible, as well as better flavoured, by hanging; but veal and lamb will not bear it so long as the flesh of older animals. In summer, 2 days is enough for lamb and veal, and from 3 to > 4 for beef and mutton ; in cold weather, these latter may be kept for more than double that time without risk of being, tainted.Chap. VI.] 63 MARKETING. To know if a hare be young, see if the nut of the first joint of the fore-paw is tender; or turn the claws sideways, and if they crack the hare is young. If the ears are tender and pliable, and if the claws are smooth and sharp, the same con- clusion may be drawn. In every sort of fish, stiffness, redness of the gills, and brightness of the eyes, are invariable signs of freshness: thick- ness of the flesh generally marks the good condition of all fish, and its firmness is an essential requisite. Fish, when quite fresh, curl round, but are particularly elastic, rising immedi- ately upon the pressure of the fingers; and their staleness or freshness may be measured by the possibility of making an im- pression. “ If stale, the impression will remain; but, if fresh, it will rise again on removal of the pressure.” Generally speaking, the largest are not always the best, but neither should the smaller sorts be chosen, particularly in cod and haddock, which, when overlarge, are frequently woolly, while small salmon, or salmon peel, are always wanting in richness; but a moderately-sized turbot, if it be firm, often tastes better than some of the very largest. Turbot should be thick, and the belly of a yellowish white: if of a bluish cast, or thin, they are bad ; the best proof of con- dition being in the firmness as well as thickness of the fish, and a light cream-colour on the pale side. The best fish average from 12 to 20 lbs., though those of less than half that weight have a very fine flavour. A fish one day old will dress much better than a live one. Brill very much resembles turbot, but is narrower and thinner: it requires scaling on both sides, and is without those thorny spines which are found on the dark side of the turbot. It should be dressed as soon as possible after it is caught. Soles would appear to be in season all the year round, as they are always in the market in greater plenty than any of our flat-fish, but are in the highest perfection about midsummer. If good, they should be thick, firm to the touch, and the belly of a cream-colour; but if this be of a bluish cast, and the body flabby, or the eyes sunken, they are not fresh ; and when brought to table, if the spinal bone be in the least degree tinged with red, it is a sure sign that the fish is stale. They are of all sizes, from a few ounces to a couple of pounds weight; but if much larger, they will be coarse, while the very small kinds are all skin and bone.64 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VI. To choose a Codfish.—Select a short fish. The gills should be very red, and the eyes full and glossy; for if dull and pale, it is a sure sign of the fish being stale. It should be round and thick at the neck, from which the body swells and carries its fulness nearly down to the tail. It should be perfectly stiff, and elastic to the touch; for if, when pressed by the finger, the mark of the indentation remains, it will eat less firm and flaky, and should therefore be rejected. The colour of the liver should be of an opaque white cast, and the whiter the liver the better the fish: when out of season, the liver becomes red. It is improved by being crimped, as this increases its firmness, and then it requires keeping one day before using. Mackerel.—The eye should be full, and the stripes on the back distinctly black: those on the male are straight, those on the female are wavy. The male fish is the best. The body should be full from the shoulders. Salmon.—If fresh and in season, the flesh is of a fine red, the scales silvery, very firm in the belly, and the whole fish stiff.Chap. VII.] SOUPS—GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 60 CHAPTER VII. SOUPS. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. In England many families deprive themselves of the use of soup, arising from fear of its expense. Many of the following receipts will, however, be found very economical; and all of them an elegant and healthful appendage to a good dinner. Soups, indeed, add greatly to the comfort of a family, and it would be well if every housewife who studies economy would pay attention to those simple modes of preparing them which may be found in the present chapter. Roman Catholic families, who, on fast-days, require maigre soups and dishes, will find abundance of receipts in this little work; but where they are not strictly so, by suet or bacon being directed to be used in stuffings, the cook must use butter •instead; and where meat gravies (or stock, as they are called) are ordered, those made of fish must be adopted, though butter, arrow-root, or flour mixed up with a finely minced or pounded anchovy and made into a paste, will make an excellent sub- stitute. Although the English taste is in favour of strong, rich, and highly-flavoured soups, yet those may be varied by others of a plainer description—broths, rubber than soups, containing only the pure juices of the meat, seasoned with vegetables; and, thickened with bread, rice, or vermicelli, will be found both palatable and wholesome. Housekeepers will do well to attend very closely to this branch of the culinary art, as the stock, or broth, may frequently be produced without the pur- chase of meat to be employed solely for the purpose. Thus the water in which a neck or a leg of mutton has been boiled or the liquor from a calf’s head, will, with the addition of a little seasoning, form a good stock for a vegetable or thick soup; particularly if the bones be added when the meat is brought from table, they will produce a still' jelly, and makeMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. YU. 66 quite sufficient soup for a small family; or, if not rich enough, it can be easily thickened. Arrow-root, or the mere farina or flour of the potato, is far better for the thickening of soups than wheaten flour. The trimmings of large joints of butcher’s meat, the shanks of legs and shoulders of mutton, the remains of all sorts of poultry and game, the bones of roast meat, or, if boiled, then broken and broiled, should all be stewed down to a jelly— nor should the bones and remains of fish, for the same purpose, be neglected—and when strained and well seasoned, kept as stock for the foundation of soups, which may thus be prepared on sudden occasions in a much shorter time than if made from raw meat. In Scotland, sheep’s heads and trotters are much used in soup ; and English private families would do well to make more use of them, as they afford very strong jelly, and the proper flavour may be given by the judicious addition of beef, game, ham, and anchovy. A clear jelly of cowheels is like- wise very useful to keep in the house, being a great improve- ment to soups and gravies, as well as particularly nourishing for weakly persons. Soft water should alivays be used for making soup, unless it. be of green peas, in which case hard water better preserves its colour; and it is a good general rule to apportion a quart of water to a pound of meat, that is to say, flesh, without bone ; but rich soups may have a smaller quantity of water. Meat for soup should never be drowned at first in water, but put into the kettle with a very small quantity and a piece of butter, merely to keep the meat from burning until the juices are extracted ; by which means of stewing the gravy will be drawn from it before the remainder of the water is added. A single pound will thus afford better and richer soup than treble the quantity saturated with cold water ; but it will take 6 or 8 hours to extract the essence from a few pounds of raw beef. Bouilli beef is rendered very rich and palatable, though a considerable quantity of soup may be made from it, by being stewed at first in a little butter and some of its own gravy. Soil]), if meant to be good, should be made of meat that lias not been previously cooked ; for although family soup of fair quality may be made in the manner above stated, yet, if cold meat be used, it will ever be found to have a vapid taste whichChap. VII.] SOUPS—GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 67 seasoning cannot disguise, nor impose upon the palate of any person who is accustomed to broths made from raw meat: but we admit, that if only partially employed, the remains of roast beef, or the bones broiled, and a shank of ham, will commonly improve the flavour of soups made in the usual manner. The sediments of gravies that have stood to be cold should likewise be avoided, as they occasion the soup to become cloudy. Raw vegetables, with the exception of onions, should not be put down to stew at the same time as the meat, as their flavour will be exhausted by too long boiling, and the different sorts should be put down at different times. Onions, either whole or sliced and fried, at once ; pot-herbs, carrots, and celery 3 hours afterwards; and turnips, vegetable marrow, asparagus- tops, and those of any delicate kind, only shortly before the soup is ready. A common camp-kettle will be found an excellent utensil for making soup, as the lid is heavy and will keep in the steam. An earthen pipkin or jar of this form, if of a long and narrow make, widening a little in the centre, is perhaps one of the best vessels for soups, and universally used by foreign cooks, who insist “ that it renders the gravy more clear and limpid, and extracts more savour from the meat, than when made in tin or copper.” It is generally thought desirable to prepare soup the day before it is wanted, as the fat can be more easily taken off when cold than hot, and every particle of it should be skimmed from the surface, or it will render the broth unpalatable. When put away to cool it should be poured into a freshly scalded, and thoroughly dried, earthen pan—which is prefer- able to any metal—and, when to be kept for some days, occa- sionally simmered for a few minutes over the fire, to prevent its becoming “ mothery,” or mouldy. A common mistake in the making of soup is that of allowing it to boil too fast, and for too short a time ; for long and slovv boiling is necessary to extract the strength from the meat, which, if boiled fast over a large fire, becomes hard, and will not give out its juices. If colouring be wanted, a few slices of meat laid at the f 268 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. YII. bottom of a stewpan with 2 or 3 oz. of butter, and left on the stove until the gravy is entirely drawn out, and nearly di’ied up again, will have the effect of browning ; or even a piece of bread toasted as brown as possible — but not blackened—and put into the soup to simmer for a short time before its going to be served, will generally be found suffi- cient : if not, an ounce or two of moist sugar—the coarser the better—put into a small saucepan, with a piece of butter the size of a walnut, melt them together ; add a glass of ketchup, and stir it well. A very small quantity may be made in an iron spoon. Burnt onions will materially assist in giving a fine brown colour to soup, and also improve the flavour with- out either butter or ketchup ;a or, if meant to be kept for future use— Put 4 oz. of lump sugar, a gill of water, and 4 oz. of the finest butter, into a small tosser, and set it over a gentle fire. Stir it with a wooden spoon, till of a bright brown. Then add a pint of water ; boil, skim, and when cold bottle and cork it close. Add to soup or gravy as much of this as will give a proper colour. The colour of white soups may likewise be improved by the use of white roux, which, in France, is universally added to white soups and sauces, as it is more delicate than butter and flour mixed in the common way. To Clarify Soup.-—Put the whites of 1 or 2 eggs into it while being warmed up, and as it begins to melt: then boil the whole gently together, and run the liquor through a jelly- bag. Or break the white of an egg into a basin along with the broken shell, carefully avoiding the smallest particle of the yolk ; beat the white to a stiff froth, and mix it gradually but thoroughly with the soup, which should be set over the fire and stirred till it boils up : then take it off, cover it close, and let it stand for J of an hour, then strain it through a napkin. The process of clarifying destroys somewhat of the savour of the soup, which ought, therefore, to be more highly seasoned. It is also very usual to put force-meat balls, of various sorts, into many different soups, for the purpose of improving their flavour and appearance. Some of these are called “ Pass- over hullsf as being much in use among the Jews, who are a They are prepared in France, and are to he purchased at all the Italian warehouses in London.Chap. VII.] SOUPS—GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 69 known to be excellent cooks, and they are equally applicable to any kind of soups-—whether meat, fish, or vegetable—and excellent in quality. See Force-meat. Ketchups and sauces, such as soy, anchovy, &c., should either only be put into weak soups which require to have some flavour imparted to them, or used with great delicacy. There is, however, an agreeable acidity as well as a delicacy of savour in Harvey’s, the Brighton, Reading, Lopresti’s, and other lately invented sauces, and more particularly that just brought forward as Wardpoy’s, which has a singular, delicate, though very pungent, flavour. Soups also—like that made from calf’s-head, cow-heel, and ox-tail—which are rich, but flavourless, will bear the addition of sauces when other relish- ing articles are not at hand; but, generally speaking, common English cooks are too much addicted to the indiscriminate use of ketchups and pickles. A bunch of Herbs, when spoken of for soups, gravies, &c., consists of parsley, thyme, and green onions ; when called Seasoning, it is these with about 3 bay-leaves, 6 cloves, a blade or two of mace, common pepper, and salt. There is sometimes a great prejudice against the use of par- ticular sorts of seasoning and spices. Garlic is amongst these ; and many a dish is deprived of its finest flavour for i want of a moderate use of it. The pungency might easily be reduced by boiling it repeatedly in different waters. The use of tomatas, which are only rarely employed in England, would also be found a great improvement in many kinds of soup ; and the seeds of celery may be used to give flavour when the root is out of season. SUMMARY OP THE FOREGOING DIRECTIONS RESPECTING SOUPS AND GRAVIES. Freshly killed meat is the best for soup ; and the leaner the better. When there is any fear of gravy-meat being spoiled before it is wanted, season well, and fry it lightly, which will preserve it 2 days longer; but the gravy is best when the juices are fresh. When soups or gravies arc to be kept, they must be boiled up and put into fresh-scalded dry pans. Do not use the sedi- ments of gravies that have stood to be cold, nor any drippings but those of beef. Whatever has vegetables boiled in it is apt to turn sour sooner than the juices of meat.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VII. TO If soups or gravies are too weak, do not cover them in boil- ing, that the watery particles may evaporate; but if strong, cover the stewpan close. If they want flavour, the gravy from spiced and hunter’s beef, or most of the prepared sauces, will give it to meat-soups ; and herring-brine, or anchovy, with walnut ketchup and soy, will add to those of fish ; but must be used cautiously. When fat remains on any soup, a teacupful of flour and water mixed quite smooth, and boiled in it, will make it rise as scum, when it may be taken off’. If richness or greater consistency be wanted, a good lump of butter mixed with flour, and boiled in the soup, will give either of these qualities. Long boiling is necessary to give the full flavour of the ingredients, therefore time should be allowed for soups and gravies. Skim frequently and simmer slowly ; but do not let the broth cool until it is completely made. Be sparing in the use of pepper, salt, and spices. If onions are too strong, boil a turnip with them, and it will render them mild. Do not keep either soups or gravies in any vessel of tin or copper; and in stirring soup, do it always with a wooden spoon. MEAT-SOUPS. The basis of all well-made soups is composed of what our English cooks call “ Stock, or broth, made from all sorts of meat, bones, and the re- mains of poultry or game ; all of which may be put together and stewed down in the “ Stock-potthe contents of which are, by the French, termed Consomme. This is chiefly used for the preparation of brown or gravy soups: that intended for wlnte soups being rather differently compounded, though made in nearly the same manner.71 MEAT-SOUPS. Chap. VII.] The following are the most usual modes of making it; the more succulent the meat, the better being the stock. Boiling water should be used when the meat is fried, but otherwise cold water is best. Brown Stock.—Put 10 lbs. of shin of beef, 6 lbs. of knuckle of veal, and some sheep’s-trotters or a cow-heel, in a closely covered stewpan, to draw out the gravy very gently, and allow it nearly to dry in until it becomes brown. Then pour in sufficient boiling water to entirely cover the meat, and let it boil up, skimming it frequently; seasoning it with whole peppers and salt, roots, herbs, and vegetables of any kind. That being done, let it boil gently 5 or 6 hours, pour the broth from off the meat, and let it stand during the night to cool. The following morning take off the scum and fat, and put it away in a stone jar for further use. Or :—Put into a stewpan a piece of beef, a piece of veal, an old fowl, some slices of ham or bacon, and all the trimmings of meat that can be obtained; add to these materials, where such things are abundant, partridge, grouse, or other game, which may not be sufficiently young and tender for the spit. Put a little water to it, just enough to cover half the meat, and stew very gently over a slow fire or steam apparatus. When the top piece is done through, cover the meat with boiling water .or broth; season with spices and vegetables; stew all together for 8 or 10 hours in an uncovered stewpan; skim off the fat, and strain the liquor through a fine sieve, or woollen (amis, known by cooks as a “ tammy.” Brown stock may be made from an ox-cheek, ox-tail, brisket, flank, or shin of beef; which will, either together or sepa- rately, make a strong jelly if stewed down with a piece of ham or lean bacon, in the proportion of lb. to every 7 lbs. of meat; but the shin of beef alone will afford a stronger and better flavour. This stock may also be reduced to a glaze by boiling the skimmed liquor as fast as possible in a newly-tinned stewpan, until it becomes of the desired consistence and of a good brown colour ; taking care at the same time to prevent it from burning.® For a cheap and good Brown Gravy.—Slice and fry 3 onions in butter a nice brown ; toast a large slice of bread a' Glaze may be hail at most of the oil-shops in London.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. YII. 72 considerable time, till quite hard and very brown, but not burnt. Set these, and any bit of meat, or bone of a leg of mutton, &c., and some herbs, on the fire, with water in pro- portion, and stew till the gravy is thick and rich: add salt and pepper, strain off, and keep cool. BR 0 TVN GRA VY SOUP. 1.—The meat used for making this soup should be quite fresh, and of the common gravy beef; if the shin be used, break the bones, as the marrow will add to its richness. Take 7 to 8 lbs. of the meat, cut a small portion of it into thick pieces and put it with 3 or 4 large sliced onions into a close stewpan, with a little butter, until fried to a fine brown. That done, add a shank of ham, just cover the meat with cold water—say a couple of quarts—and let it simmer by the fire for at least 3 hours ; during which time it should not be allowed to boil, but, when coming to that point, check it with cold water, and skim it. As the pores of the meat will then be opened, and the gravy drawn, throw in 3 quarts of warm water, along with a handful or j oz. each of black pepper, allspice, and salt, as well as a bundle of sweet herbs, a few cloves, a couple of shalots, 2 or 3 middling-sized carrots and turnips (the latter an hour afterwards), together with a couple of heads of celery, and allow the whole to boil slowly until the meat is done to rags, and the vegetables become tender. Then strain it off, and let it stand during the night. Remove the fat on the following day, set any portion of it on the fire an hour before dinner, and, when thoroughly heated, season it with mushroom or walnut ketchup, and send it up with a plate of toasted bread, cut into small square pieces, without crust. You will thus form a gallon to 5 or 6 quarts of strong soup, according to the quality of the meat; but as it is a winter soup, it will bear keeping, and, if served at more than one time, the flavour may be varied by the addition of different sorts of ingredients, as for instance—1st, plain gravy; 2ndly, gravy and vegetables; and 3rdly, vermicelli: or if only one-half or a third part of the quantity be wanted, it may be prepared in the same manner by proportionally re- ducing the materials. It may be also flavoured with red wine.73 Chap. VII.] MEAT-SOUPS. CLEAR GRAVY SOUP 2. —Is made from solid lean beef in the proportion of 1 pint of water to 1 lb. of meat and 2 oz. of ham, according to the instructions above given; strain it through a napkin, to free it from the shreds of meat and vegetables. Boil the vegetables separately a few hours before dinner, in a portion of the broth, and add them to the soup. We cannot too often repeat, that when soup is sufficiently boiled on the first day, all that it requires on the second is to make it thoroughly hot. Many persons prefer boiling all the vegetables in the soup on the first day, thinking that they improve its flavour. This may be done in common soup that is not to be strained, but should never be done if you wish it to be very bright and clear. It may be seasoned as above, and should be of a clear amber colour, without any artificial browning; but if wanted of a deep colour, a burnt onion will suffice. This soup is, in fact, the foundation of all those made from beef: the great secret of making it being, u not to spare the meat,” and to boil it slowly. MACAR ONI SOUPS. 3. —Take a quart of gravy soup ; break 2 oz. of Naples macaroni into, pieces of little more than an inch long, putting them, by degrees, into a small portion of the boiling soup, to prevent them from sticking together, and let them boil until quite tender, but not soft or pulpy—from 15 to 20 minutes if quite fresh, but nearly + an hour if at all stale. Vermicelli is used in the same maimer. They will improve the consistence of the soup if the quantity above stated be added ; but it is useless and does not look well to see, as at some tallies, only a few strings of it floating in the tureen. The flavour will also be much improved if a small quantity of Parmesan cheese be either melted in it, or grated and served up separately. SAGO SOUP. 4—Take gravy soup, quite clear and brown ; add to it a sufficient quantity of sago to thicken it to the consistence of pea-soup, and season it with soy and ketchup ; to which may be added a small glass of red wine. It may also be made, as a while soup, of beef, by leaving out the soy and ketchup, and using white wine, adding a little cream and mace.74 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. YII. OX-TAIL SOUP. 5.—Two ox-tails, if properly stewed, with a couple of pounds of gravy beef and a bone of ham, will make an excellent soup. Cut the tails into joints, and boil very gently for several hours in a sufficient quantity of water, with the beef and ham, carrots, turnips, and celery, 2 or 3 onions, a piece of crust of bread, a bunch 'of swe^t_ herbs, a clove or two, and some peppercorns. Take Out the tail's when tender, and let the beef, &c., boil 4 hours longer, then strain the liquor and remove the fat in the same manner as for clear gravy soup. If made without ham- bones, or other flavouring ingredients, it will require the addi- tion of a little ketchup, or some of the prepared sauces, and a glass of wine, with a moderate quantity of cayenne. Add the tails and some pieces of carrot and turnip cut into fancy shapes. When thickened ox-tail soup is preferred, proceed in the same manner as above, and thicken the broth with brown roux. Another.—Cut up 2 ox-tails, separating them at the joints, fry them with a little butter, a carrot, turnip, 3 onions, a leek, a head of celery, and a bunch of sweet herbs, adding a bay- leaf. Add a pint of water and a teaspoonful of peppercorns ; set it over the fire, stirring it frequently until the pan is covered with a glaze; stir in j lb. of flour and a tablespoonful of salt. Fill up the stewpan with 3 quarts of water, stirring it occa- sionally. When it boils, set it on the stove, and let it simmer until the tails are quite tender, when put them into the tureen and strain the soup over them, blanch and slice a head of celery, add it and serve. OX- CHEEK S 0 UP. 6.—Clean and soak well half an ox-head, which should be broken up by the butcher; take the meat from the bones, and put it into an earthen pan with 3 onions sliced, and fried brown in butter and flour, without becoming burnt; a bunch of sweet herbs; allspice, pepper, and salt, a large spoonful of each. Lay the bones close on the meat, and pour on 3 or 4 quarts of water, or a quart of water to every pound of the cut meat. Cover the pan with a coai’se brown paper ; tie closely, and let it stand in the oven 3 or 4 hours; or put it byChap. VII.] 75 MEAT-SOUPS. the side of the fire, in a covered pot, until the meat is tender; when done, take out the bones, and pour the soup and meat into a pan. When to be used, take off the fat, and, having warmed the soup, cut the meat into pieces not larger than a mouthful; make the brains into forcemeat balls; and as the soup, though excellent in its kind, is not of a very delicate nature, it should be highly seasoned with walnut-ketchup, and cayenne, or chili vinegar, coupled with a clove of garlic, and a good sized glass of madeira or port wine, or a large table- spoonful of brandy. A little celery, carrot, and turnip, if minced small and boiled in a basin of it a short time, will improve the flavour. Either ox-cheek, ox-tail, or shin of beef will severally make strong jelly, if stewed down until reduced to a pulp, and the bones broken up ; a process which will be more effectually performed in the digester than in any other vessel. To make Family Soup.—Take a shin or leg of beef that has been newly killed ; the fore-leg is best, as there is the most meat on it. Have it cut into 3 pieces, and wash it well. To each pound allow somewhat less than a quart of water ; to 10 lbs. of the leg, 2 gallons of water. Put it into a large pot, and add ~ a tablespoonful of salt. Hang it over a good fire, full 8 hours before you dine. When it has come to a hard boil, and the scum lias risen (which it will do as soon as it has boiled), skim it well; then set it on hot coals in the corner, and keep it simmering steadily, so as to continue a regular heat. About 3 hours afterwards, put in a couple of heads of celery, 4 carrots cut small, and as many onions sliced and fried, with either a very small head of cabbage cut into little pieces, or a large one whole, if to be eaten with the meat, or, if you have any objection to cabbage, substitute a larger pro- portion of the other vegetables, or else tomatas instead. Put also in a bunch of herbs, tied up in a thin muslin rag to pre- vent its floating on the surface. It will require at least 8 hours’ cooking; remembering to put in the vegetables 3 hours after the meat, and the turnips only £ an hour before it is done. If you wish to send any portion of the meat to table, take the best part of it out of the sou]) about 2 hours before dinner; let the remainder be left in the pot till you send up the soup, as by that time it will be boiled to rags, and76 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VII. have transferred all its flavour to the liquid, and must be strained. Next day, take what is left of the soup ; put it into a pot, and simmer it over hot coals for -j an hour: a longer time will weaken the taste. If it has been well made, and kept in a cool place, it will be found better the second day than the first. If your family is very small, and the leg of beef large, it may furnish soup for several successive days. Half the leg may therefore be sufficient, previously breaking to pieces all the bones with a mallet or kitchen cleaver, which by causing them to give out their marrow will greatly enrich the soup. Or :—When a large quantity of any butcher’s meat is brought in for the use of the family, the joints will require trimming: take all the parings, adding a slice or two of bacon, beef or mutton bones, with an old fowl, or a rabbit, if you have one, turnips, and all sorts of vegetables, onions, herbs, a few slices of carrot, ketchup, pepper, salt, &c.; put a piece of butter at the bottom of the pan, cover it closely, and put it over a slow fire for a few minutes, shaking the saucepan occa- sionally. Then pour in boiling water, and let it stew until it is rich; apportioning the water to the quantity of meat. If there be any solid portion of beef, of which the soup is made, let it be taken out previous to the meat being “ done to rags,” and sent up along with the roots in some of the liquor, thick- ened and flavoured with any piquant sauce: it will form an excellent stew. These receipts constitute the standing household dish so well known in France as the pot an feu. Cheap and wholesome pottages, in common use among the middling classes in various parts of Europe, are also made in different modes, a few of which are these:— COTTAGE SOUPS. 7.—Take 2 lbs. of lean beef, cut into small pieces, with l lb. of bacon, 2 lbs. of mealy potatoes, 3 oz. of rice, car- rots, turnips, and onions sliced, or leeks and cabbage. Fry the meat, cabbage, and onions in butter or dripping, the latter being the most savoury ; and put them into a gallon of water, to stew gently over a slow fire for 3 hours, putting in the carrots at the same time, but the turnips and rice only time enough to allow of their being well done; and mashing the pota-Chap. VII.] 77 MEAT-SOUPS. toes, which should be then passed through a colander: season only with pepper and salt: keep the vessel closely covered. It will make 5 pints of excellent soup at the cost of about Is. 8rf. Or:—To any quantity or kind of broth, add whatever vege- tables may be in season, and stew them gently till quite tender. Then strain the soup; thicken it with flour and water, to be mixed gradually while simmering; and, when that is done, and seasoned to your taste, return the vegetables to the soup, and let it boil well for V an hour. SCOTS KAIL 8. —Is chiefly made of mutton, either fresh or salted; beef is only used when mutton cannot conveniently be had. 3 or 4 lbs. of meat should be put to a gallon of cold water, along with a moderate quantity of pearl-barley, with leeks or onions, and allowed to stew until tender ; if salted, put the meat into water over night, changing it once before boiling. Then have ready the hearts of 2 cabbages cut small, or greens, if cabbages are not in season; put them into the broth, which must be allowed to boil up uncovered until reduced to 2 quarts. It should only be seasoned with pepper and salt; but will be much improved by the addition of a couple of onions fried in butter; indeed, both carrots and turnips are also some- times used, but their addition deprives the soup of the title of “Kail,” which is derived from the greens which are usually employed. The meat is served with the soup, and, in like manner as the olla of the Spaniards, or the pot uu feu of the French, is the standing household dish among the middle classes of Scot- land. C 0 CK-A-LEEKIE— 9. —Or as in Scotland called “ cocky-leeky ”—is there also a very ancient dish, and is recorded to have been a special favourite of James I. It is made thus :— Stew a large fowl, a marrow-bone, and 2 or 3 lbs. of beef, with 2 or 3 Scotch pints (4 to 6 quarts) of water, and the white ends of 2 or 3 dozen of leeks, cut in pieces. Just before serving, add £ lb. of prunes, which dish with the soup and the fowl; but not the meat or marrow-bone, which, when put to boil, must be divided, and left uncovered.78 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VII. Or:—Put 7 lbs. of the upper end of a leg of beef, and an old fowl, in a pot, with water enough to cover it, the white parts of 2 or 3 dozen of leeks half-boiled and sliced, and 1 lb. of prunes. Stew till the meat be tender, skimming it well, and, if you choose, the fowl may be disjointed and sent up in the soup. The leeks should be blanched, and as many used as to thicken the soup ; but no other seasoning is usually employed than salt and allspice, with a small quantity of mace. MUTTON-BR O TIL 10. —The best part of the mutton from which to make good broth is the chump end of the loin, but it may be excellently made from the scrag end of the neck only, which should be stewed gently for a long time—full 3 hours, or longer if it be large—until it becomes tender ; but not boiled to rags, as it usually is. A few grains of whole pepper, with a couple of fried onions and some turnips, should be put along with the meat an hour or two before sending up the broth, which should be strained from the vegetables, and chopped parsley and thyme be mixed in it. The turnips should be mashed, and served in a separate dish, to be eaten with the mutton, with parsley and butter, or caper-sauce. If meant for persons in health, it ought to be strong, or it will be insipid. The cooks usually skim it frequently ; but if given as a remedy for a severe cold, it is much better not to remove the fat, as it is very healing to the chest. Another way, for an Invalid.—Boil 3 lbs. of the scrag end of a neck of mutton, cut into pieces, in 3 quarts of water, with 2 turnips and a table-spoonful of pearl barley or rice. Let it boil gently for 3 hours, keeping it cleanly skimmed. Serve with bits of toasted bread. SHEEP’S-HEAD SOUP. 11. —Have the head carefully cleaned, put it into a stewpan with a little water, and when it is heated through till up the pot. When it is sufficiently tender, take it up, remove the meat from the bones, and return the bones into the broth, adding onion, sweet-herbs, Ac., as before directed. r! he head and trotters may also be put with some vegetables into an earthen jug, containing £ gallon of water; cover it close up,Chap. VII.] 79 MEAT-SOUPS. and bake it; either cut the meat from the bones, when suffi- ciently tender, and put it in small pieces into the soup, or serve up the head and trotters separately, either whole or with the meat cut off and made into a stew. In Scotland, the head is usually singed with a red-hot iron to remove the wool, but without burning or otherwise injuring the skin. The head is then soaked during the night, washed, scraped, and split; the brains taken out, and either fried or made into forcemeat balls, and the head stewed in the broth till tender. BARLEY BROTH. 12.—Take a breakfast-cupful of pearl-barley, boil it in a gallon of water gently for A an hour, then take 3 lbs. of meat—• lamb or mutton chops, with the fat cut off', or lean beef—put them into a separate stewpan, dress them with a small quantity of water, add to them any kind of vegetables—carrots and turnips, with small onions, celery, and green peas if in season —salt, pepper, and, with the water and the barley, let the whole boil gently for 2 hours or longer, and serve it up all to- gether. Or:—Take 3 quarts of good broth, cut into a stewpan 2 carrots, 3 or 4 turnips, 2 heads of celery, a lettuce, a little parsley, and some small onions, and a little butter and gravy. , Stew until the vegetables become quite tender; add to this a few spoonfuls of rice, boiled separately; put the whole to- gether, and boil for \ of an hour. SCOTCH BROTH. 13.—Set on the fire 4 ounces of pearl-barley, with 3 Scotch pints (or G quarts) of salt water: when it boils, skim it, and add what quantity of salt beef or fresh brisket you choose, and a marrow-bone or a fowl, with a couple of pounds of either lean beef or mutton, and a good quantity of leeks, cabbages, or savoys; or you may use turnips, onions, and grated carrots. Keep it boiling for at least 4 or 5 hours ; but if a fowl be used, let it not be put in till just time enough to bring it to table when well done, for it must be served up separately. Or:—Take the chops from a neck of mutton ; cut the re- mainder up in small pieces, and let it stew the whole day. Take also a breakfast-cup of Scotch barley, and boil it in water till it gets dry; then chop fine 2 large onions and turnips,MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. YII. 80 which put with the barley and chops into a close stewpan, strain the stock into it, let it boil II- hour, and skim it well, seasoning- it only with salt and black pepper. This will make a large tureen of broth, besides preserving the chops for table. HOTCH-POTCH. 14. —Take any quantity of lamb-chops, pare off the skin and greater part of the fat, trim the bones, cut the smaller end of the chops into pieces, and lay them along with the chops put in whole in a stewpan in this manner:—A layer of chops at the bottom, covered with every kind of vegetable cut in small pieces, onions, celery, lettuce, carrots, turnips, and green peas; then put on a layer of chops, and so on with the vegetables until the whole are added ; cover the ingredients with water, and let it stew several hours very gently, until both the meat and vegetables become tender, and the soup thick. Scotch Hotch-potch is made in the same manner, only that both beef and mutton are indiscriminately used, and minced instead of being left in chops. PEPPER-P O T HO TCH P O TOIL 15. —To 3 quarts of water put vegetables according to the season. In summer, peas, French beans, cauliflowers, lettuce, and spinach; in winter, beet-root and endive,a carrots, turnips, celery, and onions in both, all cut small; and stew with 2 lbs. of neck of mutton, or a fowl and 1 lb. of pickled pork, in 3 quarts of water, till quite tender. On first boiling, skim. Half an hour before serving, add a lobster or crab, cleared from the bones. Season with salt and cayenne. A small quantity of rice should be put in with the meat. Some people choose very small suet dumplings boiled with it. Should any fat rise, skim nicely, and put 4 a cup of water with a little flour. It may be made of various things, using a due proportion of fish, flesh, fowl, vegetables, and pulse. In the West Indies it is the universal dish of the coloured people; but seasoned so highly with green capsicums and peppers, that it is there called u peppei’-pot.” n If endive be used, it should, however, be boiled in two or three waters to take off its bitterness.Chap. VII.] SOUPS OF VEAL, POULTRY, AND GAME. 81 HARRICO SOUP. 16.—Cut some mutton cutlets from the neck ; trim and fry them of a light brown ; stew in brown gravy soup till tender. Have ready some carrots, turnips, celery, and onions; fry them in butter for some time, and clear the soup from the fat; then add the vegetables, colour it, and thicken it with butter and flour; season, and add to it a little port wine and ketchup. If the gravy be ready, the soup will require no more time to prepare than may be necessary to render the chops and vege- tables tender, and is an excellent family dish. If wished to be made more highly flavoured, put in a little curry-powder. SOUPS OF VEAL, POULTRY, AND GAME. 17. — White Stock.—Take scrag or knuckle of veal, ox-heel, or calf’s-head, together with an old fowl and the trimmings of any white poultry or game which can be had, and lean ham in the proportion of 1 lb. to every 14 lbs. of meat. Cut it all into pieces (add 3 or 4 large wraroasted onions and heads of celery, with a few blades of mace ; but neither carrots, pepper, nor spice of any kind but mace) ; put into the stock-pot with •just water enough to cover it: let it boil, and add 3 onions and a few blades of mace; let it boil for 5 hours, and it is then fit for use. 18. — Veal Gravy.-—When all the meat has been taken from a knuckle of veal, divide the bones, and lay them in a stewpot, with a pound of the scrag of a neck, an ounce of lean bacon, a bunch of parsley, a little thyme, a bit of lemon-peel, and a dessert-spoonful of pepper: add as much water as will cover them. Boil and skim it; stop the pot down close, and let it simmer as slowly as possible 3 hours. Strain off, and let it stand till cold ; then skim it, and take the jelly from the sedi- ment. Pound some mace fine, and boil it with 2 spoonfuls of water, and add to the gravy. If cream is to be put to it, do not add the salt until the gravy comes off the fire. WITITE SOUPS. 19. —Take a large scrag or a knuckle of veal, and % lb. of lean ham ; some blades of mace and a piece of ungrated nut- GMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VII. 82 in eg, sliced onions, and heads of celery, with a little salt and an equal quantity of loaf-sugar. Break the bones, and stew all gently with 1 gallon to 6 quarts of water—according to the weight of the meat—until it is done to rags and the soup becomes sufficiently strong: skim it, and strain it through a hair sieve ; or, if allowed to stand during the night, pour it into an earthen vessel, and next morning take oh' the fat. When preparing it for table, add to the liquor from i to I lb. of sweet almonds, blanched and finely pounded; boil a short time and strain again ; then put in h pint to a pint of good thick cream, and the yolk of an egg; but when the cream and egg are put in, be careful not to let the soup boil, or it will curdle. The safest way to avoid this is to mix the cream and egg in the tureen and pour the soup upon it. This in French cookery is called “ Liaison.” Or :—Thicken it as follows :—• Blanch ~ lb. of sweet almonds, and beat them to a paste in a marble mortar, with a little water to prevent their oiling; mince a large slice of dressed veal or chicken, and beat it with a piece of stale white bread : add all this to a pint of thick cream, a bit of fresh lemon-peel, and a blade of mace, in the finest powder. Boil it a few minutes ; add to it a pint of soup, and strain and pulp it through a coarse sieve: this thickening is then fit for putting to the rest, which should boil for r> an hour afterwards. If cream cannot be had, use new milk with the yolks of f a dozen hard-boiled eggs grated and mixed with the almonds as a thickening, or beaten up with 2 spoonfuls of ground rice, arrowroot, or common flour, until it becomes quite smooth and of the thickness of cream ; and a scrag of veal will answer all the purpose of the knuckle. An excellent white Soup may be made of the knuckle of veal, after cutting off’ as much meat as will make collops; or of any kind of white poultry and rabbits ; adding 2 or 3 shank- bones of mutton nicely cleaned, and £ lb. of very fine un- dressed lean gammon of bacon, with a bunch of sweet herbs, a piece of fresh lemon-peel, 2 or 3 onions, 3 blades of mace, and a dessert-spoonful of white pepper: boil all in 3 quarts of water, till the meat falls quite to pieces. White Soup may also be varied with rice : wash 2 or 3 oz. of the best kind, blanch it hi boiling water, and drain it, addChap. VII.] SOUPS OF VEAL, POULTRY, AND GAME. 83' the rice to the soup, and let it stew until it swells ; or thicken it with ground rice, bruised sago, tapioca, and arrowroot. If macaroni is used, it should be added soon enough to get per- fectly tender, after soaking in cold water. Vermicelli may be added after the thickening, as it requires less time to do. If the stock has been made with fowl, take out the white por- tion when well stewed, pound the meat in a mortar, and add it to the soup; which is a great improvement. It is the fashion now to send up grated Parmesan cheese with white soup; but not unless made with vermicelli or some sorts of gravy soup, as it partly destroys that delicacy which ought to be the distinctive property of all white soups. Two or three pints of a plainer tvhile Soup may likewise be made of a small knuckle of veal, with seasoning, as directed in the last article ; and both served together, with the addition of. i pint of good milk. Two spoonfuls of cream and a little ground lice will give it a proper thickness. Another white Soup.—Take 2 quarts of the stock, and boil the crumb of a roll in a gill of milk ; beat the yolks of 6 hard- boiled eggs with 3 oz. of sweet almonds very well in a mortar, witli a little cayenne pepper, and add the whole to the soup : it may be poured over slices of French roll sent up in the tureen. * White Potato-Soup.—Take large mealy potatoes peeled raw and sliced with half the number of onions, seasoned with white pepper, mace, and salt, and stewed with 2 lbs. of the scrag of mutton or veal in 3 quarts of water during 4 hours ; then skimmed and strained. Then add 3 pints of new milk and oz. of bitter almonds pounded. Rub the potatoes through a tammy. Let it boil before being served up, but keep stirring it to prevent the almonds from oiling. ALMOND SOUP. 20.—Make your stock of veal, or an old fowl; then put into I a mortar 1 lb. of sweet almonds, with a few of the bitter sort the yolks of 6 hard-boiled eggs, and a little white pepper : pound this very fine, put it into the stock, and let it simmer gently, putting in a little cold broth as it boils away. Strain it off'; thicken it with butter kneaded in flour ; and, just before serving, add a teacupful of good cream.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VII. 84 RICE SOUP. 21. —Take white stock, season it, and either whole rice boiled till very tender, or the flour of rice may be used ; i lb. will be sufficient for 2 quarts of broth. VEAL POTTAGE. 22. —Take off a knuckle of veal all the meat that can be made into cutlets, &c., and set the remainder on to stew, with an onion, a bunch of herbs, a blade of mace, some whole pep- per, and 5 pints of water: cover it close; and let it do on a slow fire, 4 or 5 hours at least. Strain it, and set it by till next day ; then take the fat and sediment from the jelly, and sim- mer it with either turnips, celery, sea-kale, and Jerusalem artichokes, or some of each, cut into small dice, till tender, seasoning it with salt and peppef. Before serving, rub down half a spoonful of flour with half a pint of good cream and butter the size of a walnut, and boil a few minutes. Let a small roll simmer in the soup, and serve this with it. It should be as thick as middling cream, and, if thus made of the vegetables above mentioned, will make a very delicate white pottage. The pottage may also be thickened with rice and pearl-barley ; or the veal may be minced, and served up in the tureen. VEAL BROTH.—E. R. 23. '—Stew a knuckle of veal of 4 or 5 lbs. in 3 quarts of water, with 2 blades of mace, an onion, a head of celery, and a little parsley, pepper, and salt; let the whole simmer very gently until the liquor is reduced to 2 quarts; then take out the meat, when the mucilaginous parts are done, and serve it up with parsley and butter. Add to the broth either 2 oz. of rice separately boiled, or of vermicelli, put. in only long enough to bo stewed tender. Dish the knuckle separately, and serve it with, parsley and butter. FRIAR'S CHICKEN. 24. —Take 3 quarts of water, and put into it 3 or 4 lbs. of knuckle of veal: stew gently till all the goodness is out of the meat; skim the fat off, and strain the broth through a sieve. Then take a chicken, or a full-grown young fowl, dissect itChap. VII.] SOUPS OF YEAL, POULTRY, AND GAME. 85 into pieces, and put it into the broth, which should be made hot, and seasoned only with salt and parsley. Let it simmer for nearly another hour; beat the whites and yolks of 3 or 4 eggs thoroughly, and mix them effectually with the soup, just before serving; taking care to stir them all one way. Rab- bits may be substituted for fowls. POT AGE A LA REINE 25.—Is so called from its having been said to be a favourite soup at the table of her Majesty. Stew 2 or 3 young fowls for about an hour in good fresh- made veal broth : then take them out, skin them, and pound the breast, or only the white meat, in a mortar until it becomes quite smooth. That done, mash the yolks of 3 or 4 hard- boiled eggs with the crumb of a French-roll soaked either in the broth or in milk, and mix this with the pounded meat to form a paste, which must be afterwards passed through a sieve. During this operation the bones and skin have been left stew- ing in the broth, which must then be strained, and the paste put gradually into it: then, let it boil briskly for a short time, stirring it all the while to ensure its thorough mixture. When that is done take it from the fire ; warm a pint or more of cream, and pour it gently into the soup. . This being a delicate white soup, the broth should only be seasoned with salt and mace, nor should there be any other vegetable used than celery ; but the cream may be flavoured with almonds. GIBLET SOUP.—E. R. 2G.—-Scald and clean a set, or more, of giblets; stew them by themselves in a little gravy, with 2 onions, a bunch of sweet herbs, 2 glasses of white wine, pepper, and salt. Stew until the gizzards are quite tender; then take out the giblets and strain the broth. Make a stock with 2 lbs. of gravy-beef, 3 onions, and 5 pints of water. Skin some onions, slice them thin, and fry them in butter, with a small quantity of basil, marjoram, and parsley; add flour sufficient to thicken the soup, and let it be slightly browned. Then stir in the boiling stock ; let it boil an hour, pass it through a tammy, put it again on the fire, and skim it carefully ; add the giblets, 2 glasses of sherry or Madeira wine, and a little lemon-juice.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VII. 86 Season it highly. The gizzards should be cut into quarters, or they Avill not become so tender as the other parts; divide the liver, feet, neck, and pinions in moderate-sized pieces; take off the bill and cut the head in two. In some marshy situations, where geese are reared more for the profit derived from their feathers than their flesh, and thus not properly fattened, the whole bird is sometimes made into soup, ready trussed for the table, the giblets being dressed as above, along with the carcase, which is served up separately, smothered in onions. It must be stewed very slowly, and will take from 3 to 4 hours, according- to its size, before it can be brought to table; but the soup will be of first-rate quality. Duck Giblets make a very good soup, but, being much smaller than those of a goose, a larger quantity will be neces- sary ; and those of other fowls, turkeys, and game, may also be used with nearly the same effect. HUNTER'S SOUP, AND GAME STOCK. 27. —When sportsmen bivouac upon the moors, the produce of the game-bag must be put into the soup-kettle with any odds and ends of other meat, and a bottle or two of any wine or beer that can be spared ; then—filling it with water—com- mence the brew, which may be intrusted to any servant; he being only required to begin early in the morning, and let the game stew long enough to extx-act from it the entire of its juices. When the party returns in the evening from shooting, they will thus find the essential requisite of a good soup ; and gentlemen who have preserves, or any superabundance of game for present use, or from its being too old, should order their cook to stew it down to a strong consomme; which, when well seasoned, will form excellent stock. GAME SOUP 28. —May be made of any sort of feathered game—whether partridge, grouse, or pheasant, and whether raw and whole, or only the remains of the carcase after being roasted; the latter is, however, the most usual mode ; for unless the birds are very old, few persons have so many as to spare themChap. VII.] SOUPS OF VEAL, POULTRY, AND GAME. 87 entire for the stock-pot, and the unconsumed parts are most commonly stewed down along with gravy-beef. The better mode is, however, to take the breasts, or any portion of the white meat which has been left, and pound it in a mortar ; putting the backs and legs in a stewpan with a quart of veal gravy and a slice of lean ham, 2 or 3 green onions, and a little pep- per and salt, and letting them stew till the goodness is com- pletely extracted ; then take out the backs and legs, and put in a pint of strong gravy; take the yolks of 2 hard-boiled eggs and pound them with the meat that is in the mortar; rub it through the tamis; add it to the liquor in which the legs were stewed: this must be done last, as, if it stands long, it will spoil. Mix all together, and heat and stir it over the fire until it be of the desired consistency. If too thick, add some pure veal gravy ; but season it very moderately, as it ought to possess sufficient of the high game flavour. PARTRIDGE AND PHEASANT SOUP. 29. —Skin a leash of old birds, and cut them into pieces, with 3 or 4 slices of ham, 3 lbs. of gravy beef, a stick of celery, and 3 large onions cut into slices. Fry them all in butter till brown, but take care not to burn them. Then put them into a stewpan, with 5 pints of boiling water, a few pep- percorns, and a little salt. Stew it gently 2 hours; then strain it through a sieve, and put it again into a stewpan, with some stewed celery and fried bread; when it is near boiling, skim it, pour it into a tureen, and serve it up hot. CLEAR HARE SOUP.—E. R. 30. —Cut a large hare into pieces, and put it, together with a scrag or knuckle of veal, and a cow-heel, into a kettle, with 5 or 6 quarts of water, herbs, onion, &c., and a little mace ; stew it over a slow fire for 2 hours, or until the gravy is good ; then take out the back and legs, cut the meat off, returning the bones, and stewing the whole until the meat is nearly dis- solved. Then strain off the gravy, put a glass of wine to every quart of the soup, and send it to table with the meat cut into small pieces, and warmed with the wine, which will take about 10 minutes or f of an hour. Soup may be made in much the same way of either leveret or fawn, only not stewing them so long.88 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VII THICK HARE SOUP. 31. —Cut the hare into pieces, and lay them at the bottom of a large jar, with a slice or two of lean ham, an onion, a stick of celery, and a bundle of sweet herbs, with about 3 quarts of boiling water. Put the jar into an oven, and let it remain until the hare is stewed to rags; it will take 3 hours baking, and the same time simmering by the fire. Strain off the liquor, take the meat from the bones and pound it in a mortar, mixing it with the soup until it is quite thick. Let it boil up once, with a spoonful of Harvey’s sauce, a glass of port wine, and a little cayenne pepper. Send it to table with forcemeat balls in the tureen, made with the chopped liver, and fried. The better way, however, is to make the "force- meat balls with the brains, and to grate or pound the liver, when thoroughly boiled, for the purpose of thickening the soup, which should always be made of a good consistence. A more frugal Hare Soup may, however, be made if there be only 3 or 4 in family. It is a very excellent and economical plan to cut off the head and shoulders of the hare, and roast only the hind quarters. Then, on the following day, stew down the bones, along with the head and shoulders, and make the whole into soup ; using the brains and liver as above, and seasoning it to your palate. A pound or two of shin of beef will increase the quantity ; and a few minced roots with a mush- room, or a little of the powder, will improve the flavour. ARTIFICIAL HARE SOUP. 32. —Procure a bullock’s heart as soon as possible after the animal is killed, cut away from it the fat, pipes, and outer skin, split and clean it from the blood, then slice it into an earthen jar, with a cover that fits close; add 2 or 3 good-sized onions, one of them to be stuck with cloves, a blade of mace, pepper, and salt, a bunch of sweet herbs, and a good slice of bread ; also a piece of butter rubbed in flour; put all down into a pot with water sufficient to cover the ingredients, put the cover on, and a coarse paste over it, that the steam may not escape. Place it in a pan of boiling water, letting the water come nearly to the top of the jar, stewing it for several hours, and keep filling up the pan with boiling water as it wastes away. When the meat is tender enough, pound it in a marble mortar with the bread till quite fine ; and whileChaf.YII.] SOUPS OF VEAL, POULTRY, AND GAME. 89 beating moisten it occasionally with broth made from fresh beef free from fat; when fine enough pass it through a sieve, add to it the gravy that the heart was stewed in, and as much of the beef broth as will make the quantity of soup required. Boil it up, and add more seasoning of cayenne and salt. If not thick enough, add flour and butter, until it becomes of the consistency of good cream. A spoonful of sugar and a little port wine are improvements. VENISON SOUP. 33. —Take 4 lbs. of freshly killed venison cut off from the bones, and 1 lb. of ham in small slices. Add an onion minced, and black pepper to your taste. Put only as much water as will cover it, and stew it gently for an hour, keeping the pot closely covered. Then skim it well, and pour in a quart of boiling water. Add a head of celery cut into small pieces, and 3 blades of mace. Boil it gently 24 hours; then put hi j lb. of butter, divided into small pieces, and rolled in flour, and add 4 pint of port or Madeira wine. Let it boil i of an hour longer, and send it to table with the meat in it. Or:—Take a breast of venison, cut it in small pieces, and stew it gently in brown gravy soup. Serve it with roots cut in dice and French beans in diamonds, adding 2 glasses of port wine when first put on. ■ The head of the deer chopped in pieces, and the flesh stewed to a jelly, is also an excellent addition to the soup. TURTLE SOUP.'1 34. —Hang up the turtle by the hind fins, cut off the head, and allow it to drain. Cut off the fore fins ; separate the callipash (upper shell) from the callipee (under shell), beginning at the hind fins. Cutoff' the fat which will be found adhering to the callipash and to the lean meat of the callipee. Then cut off the hind fins. Take off the lean meat from the callipee and from the fins, and cut it into pieces 2 inches square and put into a stewpan. The callipash, callipee, and fins, must be held in scalding (not boiling) water for a few minutes, which will cause the shell to quit easily. “ This receipt is a most excellent one, and is in constant use by the party who favoured us with it; and we may add, that some thousands of pounds weight oi turtle pass through his hands every year.90 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. YII. Cut the callipash and callipee into pieces about 6 inches square, which put into a stock-pot with some light veal stock. Let it boil until the meat is tender, and then take it out into cold water ; free the meat from the bones, and cut it into pieces an inch square. Return the bones into the stock and let it boil gently for 2 hours, strain it off, and it is then fit for use. Cut the fins across into pieces about an inch wide, boil them in stock with an onion, 2 or 3 cloves, a faggot of parsley and thyme, a sprig of sweet basil and marjoram. When tender take them out and add this stock to the other. Take the lean meat, put into a stewpan with a pint of Madeira, 4 tablespoonfuls of chopped green shalot, 2 lemons sliced, a bunch of thyme, marjoram, and savory (about 2 tablespoonfuls each when chopped), 1 4 tablespoonfuls of sweet basil (chopped), and 4 tablespoonfuls of parsley. Pound together a nutmeg, 1 dozen allspice, 1 blade of mace, 5 or 6 cloves, 1 tablespoonful of pepper and of salt. Mix the whole together with as much curry-powder as will lie on a shilling. Put about two-thirds of this to the lean meat, with 4 lb. of fresh butter and 1 quart stock. Let the whole be gently sweated until the meat is done. Take a large knuckle of ham, cut it into very small dice, put into a stewpan with 4 large onions sliced, 6 bay-leaves, 3 blades of mace, 1 dozen allspice, f lb. of butter; let it sweat until the onions are melted. Shred a small bunch of basil, a larger one of thyme, savory, and marjoram; throw these into the onions, and keep them as green as possible: when sweated sufficiently, add flour according to your judg- ment sufficient to thicken the soup. Add by degrees the stock in which the callipash and callipee were boiled, and the seasoning stock from the lean meat. Boil for an hour; rub through a tammy, and add salt, cayenne, and lemon-juice to palate. Then put in the meat; let it all boil gently about 4 an hour ; and if more wine be required, it must be boiled before being added to the soup. This is for a turtle of from 40 to 50 lbs. It should, however, be recollected that the animal is of various weight—from a chicken-turtle of 40 lbs. to somecwts. —and the condiments must be apportioned accordingly. It should invariably be made the day before it is wanted. MOCK-TURTLE. 35.—Half a calf’s head will be quite sufficient, even if it beChap.

Take out the brains; clean the head carefully in hot water, by squeezing it with the hand to press out the blood, and leave it afterwards for an hour in cold water. Then put it into 5 or 6 quarts of warm water along with 2 lbs. of veal, 2 lbs. of delicate pickled pork, chiefly fat, a roasted onion or two stuck full of cloves, and the thinly pared rind of a lemon, together with a large bundle of savoury pot-herbs, 2 sliced carrots, and a head of celery. Let this boil for 2 hours: then take up the head and the pork. The head must be stripped of its skin, and the brain, tongue, and eye taken out; let the bones of the head be broken and returned to the soup, and boil 2 hours longer — the brains being made into forcemeat balls, the tongue skinned and sliced ; the black part of the eye should also be taken out, and the remainder minced ; the skin being cut into pieces of little more than an inch square. While the stock is boiling, put into a saucepan a small quantity of fresh butter, with some onions sliced thin, a little basil, marjoram, and parsley, a very small quantity of thyme, 3 bay-leaves, 2 blades of mace, a few allspice; sweat all these well over the fire ; when done, add sufficient flour to thicken the soup. Stir in the boiling stock by degrees to avoid its being lumpy ; let, it .boil gently for an hour, then rub it through a tammy, set it over the fire ; when it boils add the meat. About 10 minutes before you serve, season the soup to your taste with salt, a small quantity of cayenne pepper, a couple of spoonfuls of soy, a good squeeze of lemon-juice, together with nearly a pint of either Madeira or sherry. Serve with 2 lemons upon a plate, cut in half, as some people like the soup to be somewhat acid. Mushrooms are sometimes added. The soup will take at least 7 or 8 hours in preparation. A calf’s head requires half its own weight of meat to make the broth of proper quality. IMITATION OF MOCK-TURTLE. 36.—Put into a pan a knuckle of veal, 2 fine cow-heels or 2 calf’s feet, 2 onions, a few cloves, peppers, berries of all- spice, mace, and sweet herbs; cover them with water, then tie a thick paper over the pan, and set it in an oven for 3 hours. When cold, take off the fat very nicely ; cut the meat and feetMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VII. 92 into bits IV inch square ; remove the bones and coarse parts ; and then put the rest on to warm, with a large spoonful of walnut and one of mushroom ketchup, half a pint of sherry or Madeira wine, a little mushroom-powder, and the jelly of the meat. TV hen hot, if it wants any more seasoning, add some ; and serve with hard eggs, forcemeat balls, a squeeze of lemon, and a spoonful of soy. This is a very easy way, and the dish is excellent. NEAT’S FEET SOUP. 37. —Take 2 neat’s feet, cut them as you do a calf’s head : take 5 pints of any sort of broth, the juice and rind of 1 lemon, some parsley and herbs chopped fine ; send these to the oven ; when it comes from the oven, put in a pint of strong gravy and a cup of white wine, some hard eggs and forcemeat balls; season with cayenne pepper and salt. To these an excellent addition will be found in 1 lb. of the belly part of very delicate pickled pork; for it will improve the flavour of the soup, and, if cut neatly into bits, will taste nearly as rich, and quite as savoury, as the fat of the head, or the gelatinous parts of the feet. Any of these receipts for mock-turtle may be also made from pig’s face and pettitoes; and in most country-houses, as well as at sea—where pigs are generally kept for fresh meat —the head is commonly made into soup in imitation of turtle. It has become unfashionable among first-rate cooks to put those egg-balls, formerly so common, into mock-turtle; but as they are still used by those of the old school, we here add their mode of preparation :— Take out the yolks of some hard-boiled eggs, and beat them in a mortar with a very little salt and cayenne, and make them into a paste with the white of a raw egg. Roll the paste into balls not larger than marbles, put them into the soup, and boil for 10 minutes. MULL A GA TA WNEE. 38. —Slice some onions and a few shalots, put them in a mortar with V lb. of fresh butter, beat them well, add 3 or 4 dessert-spoonfuls of curry-powder, a little cayenne pepper and salt; cut up some India pickle, which pound well with the other ingredients, add Hour sufficient to thicken the soup, and a little cold stock to work the whole into a stiff paste.

Serve with rice. Or:—Boil, in a gallon of water, 4 lbs. of the shank-end of a knuckle of veal, along with the bones of a fowl, the flesh of which has been stripped off and skinned. When half or nearly done, cut off as much of the meat as may be wanted for making the broth, putting aside the glutinous parts of the shank, and letting the remainder stew until the whole of its gravy has been extracted. When that is done, skim and strain it; fry, in butter, 4 onions sliced and floured; mince the flesh of the fowl and knuckle—not too small; add 2 dessert-spoonfuls of curry-powder, with salt and a little cayenne; let the whole simmer together for another hour, and when ready for table season the soup with lemon-juice or a wine-glass of Madeira, and serve it with boiled rice. MUTTON MULL A GA TA WNEE. 39.—Take 4 lbs. of the scrag end of a neck of mutton ; cut off the lean meat in small pieces, boil the remainder and the bones well in 3 quarts of water, with a bunch of sweet herbs, parsley, mace, and 2 onions ; strain it and carefully take off the .fat; put the pieces of lean mutton into a stewpan with 2 table- spoonfuls of curry-powder, pepper, salt, and a little butter; let it simmer gently till the gravy is drawn, then add to it the soup from the bones; boil them together till the meat is ten- der, thicken the soup with a little ground rice till a little thicker than cream ; if not seasoned enough add a little more curry-powder to the thickening; boil it a an hour more, and it is ready to serve. Send with it a dish of boiled rice. The rice is sometimes pulped through a sieve to thicken it, but is most usually sent up separately, and in its whole state, for each person to use it or not, as they think proper. Green peas are also occasionally used for the same purpose as a substitute for the dhal, with which, in India, this soup is fre- quently thickened. Throughout Germany, soups made of wine and beer are very common, as they can be made at a moment in the follow- ing manner:—94 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VII. 40.—Take a pint of white wine, and pint of water, sweeten it to the taste with white sugar, fry one large table- spoonful of flour with a piece of butter until it is very brown, then pour the wine and water upon it, and boil it a few minutes with lemon-peel and cinnamon. Then take the yolks of 6 eggs, beat them well and add the boiling soup very slowly, stirring it well all the time that it may not curdle ; put a little toasted bread, cut very fine, into the soup, and serve it up hot. VEGETABLE SOUPS. Although many of the following soups are made purely of vegetables, yet some—and those generally the best—are made on a foundation of some sort of meat-broth in which the roots are stewed. The broth is therefore the real, stock on which these soups are made, though each bears the name of the vegetable which gives it flavour; but when made solely from herbs, roots, and vegetables, and used as a basis for the forma- tion of soupes-maigres, the stock is then composed of every sort in season which can, by long stewing, be reduced to a pulp, in which every species of savoury herb—such as chervil, tarragon, and marjoram—are mixed, together with a few chilis, shalots, and a head of garlic, seasoned with mace, whole pep- pers, salt, and mushroom ketchup ; to which may be added a little curry-powder. The pulp is then strained; and, being thus rather highly seasoned, may be kept for a few days, and used in aid of any other soup. It must be left to simmer during several hours; and should it need browning, some sliced onions, fried in butter, will be all that is necessary. It should be observed that all soups, whether of fish or vege- tables, which are made without any intermixture of meat-broth., are strictly maigre, and will be treated of under that head. FRIED OR SPLIT-PEA SOUP.—E.R. 41.—The liquor in which a leg of mutton or -r a calf’s head has been boiled will make an excellent stock for this soup ; but if that of pork be used, and it be much salted, part of the liquor should be thrown away and the remainder mixed with fresh water. Put on the stock to boil, slice into it a head of celery, a carrot and turnip, with 2 onions ; boil a sufficient quantity of peas in fresh water, putting them in dry and when the water boils quickly; when they will mash throw95 VEGETABLE SOUPS. Chap. VII.] them into the broth with a crust of bread the size of a roll; let them boil for P an hour, then rub through a sieve, season to taste. Some dried mint should be sent to table in a castor. Or —Make a puree of peas boiled in a little broth, adding a large onion ; pass it through a sieve ; reduce it to a proper thickness with cold milk, add a dessertspoonful of moist sugar, with pepper and salt to taste. It should be passed through the sieve 2 or 3 times to make it quite smooth. On shipboard, and in many country-houses, it is not unusual to cut some of the boiled pork into very small bits, and serve them up either separately or mixed in the soup. Fried onions will add much to its flavour if added to the broth of which the soup is made. GREEN-PEA SOUP.—E.R. 42.—Boil in salt water, over a slow fire, a quart of freshly- gathered large green peas, with a handful of parsley, sorrel, and a few chives, until they become thoroughly stewed ; drain and pound them in the mortar until made into a puree, which mix gradually into veal or beef broth : if that of beef, seasoned only with pepper and salt; but if of veal, with mace and a very little refined sugar. Have ready some leeks and lettuce that have been boiled, but not to a pulp, and fry them in but- ter along with some nicely-fried' slices of bread cut into dice, putting them into the soup just before sending it up, and adding a few heads of boiled asparagus when in season; or if not, hop- tops are a tolerable substitute. Chopped mint is also served along with pea-soup. The sorrel will give a very delicate flavour of acidity to the soup ; but care should be taken never to acquire this flavour by adding vinegar to any kind of pea, lentil, or farinaceous pulse soup, as it will occasion it to curdle. Or:—Take 3 cabbage lettuces, 3 onions, a pint of young peas, £ lb. of butter, a faggot of mint, pepper and salt to taste ; cut these into small pieces, and stew them till tender. Take 3 pints of old peas to 5 pints of water, boil them till quite soft; rub them through a sieve ; add this to the above ingredients ; let it boil up, and then serve. Or:—Take a peck of green peas, and, in shelling them, separate the old from the young; boil the former portion until they are quite tender, and, if not sufficiently sweet, add a small quantity of powdered lump-sugar; then rub them through a sieve, return them to the stock, and let them stew gently toge-96 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VII. ther. The great object in making these soups is to render them perfectly smooth ; for should the least grittiness appear, it will entirely destroy their goodness. Put in the young peAs just time enough before the soup is served to allow them to be properly cooked; artichoke bottoms or cucumbers may be added with advantage: pare a couple of cucumbers, cut them in pieces, take Out the seeds, dry them in a cloth, flour, and fry them of a light brown, and serve them up with the soup as it goes to table. The soup may be made of any sort of broth. A small quantity of carbonate of soda, or a little spinach boiled soft and pulped with the peas, will keep the soup green ; but the soda should be sparingly used. It is customary to serve up with all kinds of pea-soup, and frequently with those purees made of vegetables, some slices of bread cut into very small square bits, and not merely toasted, but fried in butter until browned, but served separately, and seldom put into the soup. LENTIL-SOUP. 43. —The lentils are made into a puree, and seasoned in the same manner as in white or dried pea-soup, but should always be made of veal-broth, and the pulse boiled long enough to ex- tract the scarlet colour, which gives it a good appearance; for its flavour is much the same as that of soup made of peas. SOUPE A LA JULIENNE. 44. —Cut various kinds of vegetables in pieces, either sliced or of the size of dice, 1 head of celery, carrots, turnips, leeks, and the hearts of lettuce, 2 each, with a dozen of small button onions pared very carefulto preserve their shape; then, having put 2 oz. of butter* in the bottom ot a stewpan, put the vegetables on the top,.jpf the butter, togethei with any others that may be in season’; more particularly heads of aspa- ragus, and likewise a little sorrel to impart a slight fla\ our of acidity, together with a lump of sugar to prevent any bitter- ness of taste. Stew or fry them over a slow fire, keeping them stirred, and adding a little gravy occasionally; soak small pieces of crust of bread about the size ot sliillings in the remain- der of the broth or stock, and, when the vegetables are nearly stewed, add them, and warm the whole up together in the ne- cessary quantity of beef or veal broth; beet being the most savoury, but veal being, in summer, thought the lightestVEGETABLE SOUPS. Chap. VII.] 97 and the most usual on fashionable tables : neither pepper nor ketchup should be used. Although this may be made at any time of the year, yet, being- chiefly composed of vegetables, it is more distinctively a spring soup ; but if made in winter, the vegetables should be only stewed ; for, if fried, the flavour of the soup would be unpleasantly strong. It is a universal Parisian dish, and has lately come into very general use, as a species of soupe scinte, at fashionable English tables. SOUPE A LA FLAMANDE. 45.—Take of carrots, turnips, and onions of a large size, 2 of each ; a small quantity of lettuce, leeks, chervil, and en- dive. Shred them in pieces, and put them in a stewpan with a small piece of butter and a teacupful of gravy ; set them over a slow fire, and let them be frequently shaken in the pan while stewing, until they become tender ; then add a quart of any sort of broth, and let it all stew gently for an hour, seasoning it with I* salt, a small quantity of mace, a little sugar, and only a pinch of cayenne. Mix thoroughly the yolks of 3 eggs with ± pint of cream, and add them to the soup the last thing before you I serve it up. Keep stirring it after the eggs are in, until it almost boils, but not quite. Or:—Wash, peel, and slice 12 potatoes and 6 onions, cut 6 or 8 heads of celery into small pieces ; put these into a stew- pan with I lb. of butter and about a pint of water; let them simmer 1 hour ; fill up the pan with a good stock ; let it boil till the potatoes are dissolved; rub it through a sieve; add a I pint of cream. SOUPE A LA CRECI.— E. R. 46.—Grate 4 carrots, the red part only, slice 4 onions, a turnip, and a piece of lean ham, a parsnip, 2 lettuces, a leek, a stick of celery, and a root of parsley, with a blade of mace, a few allspice, and a few sprigs of parsley and thyme ; put them all into a stewpan, with a piece of butter. Let it simmer for £ an hour, stirring occasionally ; then fill it up with stock, allowing it to boil gently 2 hours; then put in the crumbs of 2 French rolls ; when well soaked, rub the whole through a tcunis. Let it boil up; skim it well ; add salt if required, and a small lump of sugar. Have a little rice ready boiled, and serve it up in the tureen. ii98 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VII. CARROT SOUP. 47 —Take 6 or 8 full-grown carrots, of the red sort, scrape them clean, and rasp only the outer rind, or soft red part, and if you have a single ripe tomata, add it, sliced, to the raspings, but use no other vegetable except onions. AVhile this is doing, the broth of any kind of fresh meat which has been got ready should be heated and seasoned with a couple of onions fried in butter, but without pepper, or any other kind of seasoning, ex- cept a small quantity of mace and a little salt. When all is ready, put the raspings into 2 quarts of the skimmed broth, cover the stewpan close, and let it simmer by the side of the fire for 2 or 3 hours, by which time the raspings will have become soft enough to be pulped through a fine sieve: after which the soup should be boiled until it is as smooth as jelly, for any curdly appearance will spoil it. Thus all the roots and most of such vegetables as can be easily made into purees, and combined with any sort of broth, will, in this manner, make excellent soup of different denomi- nations, though all founded upon the same meat-stock. The gravy of beef is always preferred for savoury soups, and that of veal or fowls for the more delicate white soups: to which from -L a pint to a pint of cream, or, if that cannot be had, the same quantity of milk and the yolks of a couple of raw eggs, should be added for every 2 quarts of soup; remembering, however, that the latter will not impart the richness of cream. Parsnip Soup is made in the same way as that of car- rots ; only that the whole of the root is used, and it requires either another tomato or a spoonful of chili vinegar to check its rather mawkish sweetness. Vegetable Marroiv.—Sometimes thickened with arrowroot and cream, flavoured with almond-powder; and occasionally coloured with a small quantity of saffron, which, to some palates, adds an agreeable flavour. The soup must not be allowed to boil after the cream is put into it, or it would be likely to make it curdle. PALES TINE S O UP. 48.—Take 2 or 3 dozen of Jerusalem artichokes according to their size, pare and slice them into a pan of water ; then drain, and put them into a 3-quart stewpan with a little butter, a good piece of ham, a blade of mace, 3 onions sliced thin, and99 Chap. VII.] VEGETABLE SOUPS. the white part of 2 heads of celery. Let them stew for an hour; then fill up the stewpan with white veal broth, and add the crumb of 2 French rolls. Let it stew till soft enough to be passed through the tamis. Return it into the stewpan, boil it up, skim well, add salt and sugar to palate, and put a. pint of hot cream in the tureen when sent to table: add croutons of fried bread. Turnip Soup.—Proceed as for Palestine soup ; either veal or mutton broth may be employed. LEEK OR ONION SOUP. 49. —The liquor in which a leg of mutton has been boiled will do very well for this broth. Mix a spoonful or two of oatmeal, according to the quantity of broth, in cold water, very smooth, the same as if for gruel, add a little of the broth, by degrees, until the whole is incorporated; then boil the liquor with any quantity of leeks or onions—both or either—until it becomes of the consistence of cream. Or, omit the oatmeal, and sub- stitute flour, stirring the soup very hard for 5 minutes; and when you are about taking it from the fire, stir in the yolks of 2 raw eggs beat up with a little more broth, and serve it I immediately. Onions, peeled, pared, and cut into pieces, then shred into a pan and fried in either oil or butter, without any broth, but Simply having boiling water poured over them, and some I toasted bread, seasoned merely with pepper and salt, are con- sidered very refreshing when thus made into a soup, and much used by ladies throughout the Continent after the fatigues of a I ball. TOM AT A SOUP. 50. —Cut up 2 onions and fry them in butter; when the onions are brown, add to them a dozen tomatas, from which you have squeezed the water, and then proceed as for Creci soup. A moderate quantity of tomata pulped or shredded, mixed up with any of the vegetable soups, will be generally found an improvement, as it imparts a delicacy of colour and a pleasing acidity of flavour. CELERY SOUP. 5L—Blanch the heads in warm water, and put them into a stewpan with veal broth and a lump of sugar; boil them for n 2MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. YII. 100 an hour or two until soft enough to be either pulped through a sieve and thickened with cream, or eaten in the manner of a stew. A little cayenne may be added, but without any addi- tion of either potherbs or pungent sauces. A R TICHOKE SO UP. 52. —Clean the bottoms from the leaves and chokes, and put them to soak for y an hour in a small quantity of milk ; then stew them gently with a piece of butter kneaded in flour. When sufficiently tender, take them out and mash them ; rub them through a hair sieve, and let them afterwards simmer over a gentle fire ; add a bunch of young onions, some thyme, and a little parsley. When nearly done, pound in a mortar 2 oz. of blanched sweet almonds, the yolks of 4 eggs, and a spoonful of white sugar ; put them to a couple of quarts of veal broth, and season it to your taste with salt and cayenne pepper: set it on the fire for a few minutes before serving. Or, into a rich stock, made of knuckle of veal, beef-bones, &c., with a little carrot and celery, pepper or chilis, cut several artichokes, and put them in a saucepan with a little of the stock ; letting them boil very gently until quite tender. Then put them through a sieve, mix them by degrees in as much cream as will thicken the soup, add the stock, and warm all together without boiling it. ASPARAGUS SOUP. 53. —Take 2 quarts of good beef or veal broth: put to it 4 onions, 2 or 3 turnips, and some sweet herbs, with the white parts of a hundred of young asparagus ; but, if old, or very large in the stem, half that quantity will do, and let them all simmer till sufficiently tender to be rubbed through a tamis, which is not an easy matter if they be not very young. Tlien strain and season it; have ready the boiled tops which have been cut from the stems, and add them to the soup. Or:—Poach half a dozen eggs rather hard, have ready a hundred of asparagus heads boiled tender; boil 3 quarts of clear gravy soup ; put into it for a minute or two a fowl just roasted ; then add a few tarragon leaves ; season with a little salt; put the eggs and asparagus heads quite hot into the tureen, and pour the soup over them without breaking them. The fowl will be just as good as before for made dishes.Chap. VII.] VEGETABLE SOUPS. 101 SPRING SOUPS. 54/.—Take any or all sorts of green vegetables, sea-kale, asparagus tops, green peas, spinach, lettuce, and sorrel, with mustard and cress, chives, and young onions, to which gher- kins, cucumbers, and green capsicums may be added as the season advances. Stew them in any kind of good broth, either until they can be made into a puree, which is by far the most approved mode for company ; or for family fare they may be chopped small, and left in the soup, but not boiled quite so much as when meant to be pulped. THICK SPRING SOUP. 55. —Have ready washed and picked a bunch of spring onions, some carrots, lettuces, chervil, spinach, parsley, thyme, sorrel, mint, and asparagus; put them in a stewpan, with a slice of butter; let it sweat for r an hour on a brisk tire, stir- ring it occasionally ; have ready some French rolls that have been previously soaked in water and squeezed dry, sufficient to thicken the soup; throw in also a few mushroom trimmings, fill it up with good broth made of any kind of meat; bring it up to the boil, skim, and pass it through a tammy ; season with a little salt and sugar; garnish with asparagus points or crou- tons : it should be very green. Or, if it be a jour maii/rc, the broth must be omitted, and butter, with flour and curry-powder, be added. VEGETABLE SOUP. 56. —Take 2 cucumbers, 12 or 14 onions, 3 potatoes, 1 let- tuce, 1 head of white cabbage; fry these together in butter, stew them 3 or 4 hours in 3 pints of stock; add a little green mint, parsley, and a pint of green peas ; let it stew for 2 hours more; press it through a sieve, and thicken it with flour and butter. WINTER VEGETABLE SOUPS. 57. —Take carrots, turnips, and the heart of a head of celery, cut into dice, with a dozen button onions ; half boil them in salt and water, with a little sugar in it; then throw them into the broth; and, when tender, serve up the soup : or use rice, dried peas and lentils, and pulp them into the soup to thicken it. With many of these soups, small suet dumplings, very102 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VII.- Iightly made, and not larger than an egg, are boiled either in broth or water, and put into the tureen just before serving, and are by most persons thought an improvement, but are more usually put into plain gravy-soup than any other, and should be made light enough to swim in it. Such are the chief soups made of vegetables on a foundation of meat; both those made solely of vegetables, without any intermixture of meat broth, may be made into very palatable soups by using the vegetable stock, as already stated. Soupe a la Julienne, and all those French soups of which we have given receipts, may also be made maigre by substi- tuting vegetable stock for meat broth ; or even making them of merely boiling water, but thickening them with butter, flour, and milk, or the yolks of eggs, and seasoning them rather highly, as they require more excitement on the palate than when made with meat; as well as those which we have named as purees. FISH SOURS. Notwithstanding the quantity of excellent fish suited to the purpose with which English markets are supplied, this nutritious, elegant, and economical viand is not often intro- duced at table in the form of soup. Nothing could be more easy than to multiply receipts for an almost endless variety: those that follow will, however, show how much may be done with many kinds of fish which are not in very high esti- mation. When not wanted as soupe-maigre, the foundation, or stock, though called “fish-soup,” is always better if made of meat, and veal is generally preferred. We, therefore, here add a receipt for its composition, as it may be applied to any kind of fish ; though, in those which we shall hereafter specify, it is not mentioned, as they are all intended to be maigre. STOCK FOR FISH SOUP. 58.—Take a dozen of flounders, or any small flat fish, and the same number of perch ; gut and clean them carefully; put them into a stewpan with 2 quarts of strong veal-broth; add a few slices of lean ham, 2 or 3 carrots, celery, and onions cut in slices, some sweet herbs and salt, with a little cayenne; stew till the fish will pass through a coarse sieve; then return103 Chap. VII.] FISH SOUPS. it into the stewpan, with a good lump of butter and some flour to thicken it; add a couple of large glasses of white wine, and a large spoonful of garlic vinegar. The gravy from potted herrings, anchovies, or a little Oude sauce, will also improve the flavour. This stock, if once reboiled, will, in cold weather, keep well for a month ; or, if served as soup, the quantity may of course be reduced according to the number of the party intended to partake of it, and it will be found excellent. Indeed, any species of fish may be made into soup in the same manner. If meant to be browned, the onions should be fried, and a good spoonful of mushroom ketchup or India soy be added ; and red wine will be better than either sherry or Madeira. But if left white, cream should be substituted for ketchup and soy; a glassful of ginger-wine will answer the purpose of red wine. Stock for Fish Soupe-Maigre.—Take 1 lb. of skate, 4 or 5 flounders, and 2 lbs. of eels. Clean them well, and cut them into pieces ; cover them with water, and season them with mace, pepper, salt, an onion stuck with cloves, a head of celery, 2 parsley-roots sliced, and a bunch of sweet herbs. Simmer IV hour, closely covered, and then strain it off for use. If for brown soup, first fry the fish brown in butter, and then do as above. It will not keep more than 2 or 3 days. In making this stock it should also be observed, that the bones of the fish are what constitute its best part; for if stewed down in a digester, they will become a jelly of a very rich nature, which may be applied to many sorts of soups and sauces. The bones of large fish—salmon, cod, soles, and turbot—are never taken from the dish on which they are served ; and therefore should always be returned to the stock- pot ; or any remains and trimmings of the fish may be used. Add to this a carrot and an onion or two, and let the whole stew until dissolved. To thicken or enrich white or fish soups, it is a good way to pour them, boiling hot, on the beaten yolks of 2 or 3 fresh eggs. FISH SOUPE-MAIGRE. 59.—For a party of a dozen, clean and nicely wash 1 lb. each of dace, roach, or any common fish ; stew them with as many large carrots, half the number of lettuces, a handful of leeks, 4 onions, and a handful of sorrel, in as much water asMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VIE 104 will cover them, until the whole are done to a mash ; strain it through a coarse cloth, and boil the liquor, closely covered, 1 hour. Have ready some of the above-mentioned vegetables, cut small; flour, and boil them in butter, and simmer them in the soup an hour with pepper, salt, and a few cloves. Soften a rasped French roll in good broth, and, having mixed the yolks of 6 fresh eggs with a few crumbs, stir them into the soup, and pour the whole over the roll. Or;—Have ready the pulp of old or fresh peas ; and add them, and as much of the water that boiled them, with 4 oz. of butter, pepper, and salt, as will make the soup of a proper consistence. Stir often, and boil till ready to serve. RAY OR SKATE SOUP. 60. —This fish contains a number of small bones, surround- ing the pectoral fins, which are so delicate as to be easily con- verted into a jelly, and therefore well adapted for the making of soup. Make it of the stock directed for fish soup, with 1 oz. of vermicelli boiled in it a little before it is served. Then add 4 pint of cream, beaten with the yolks of 2 eggs. Stir it near, but not on, the fire. Serve it with a small French roll made hot in a Dutch oven, and then soaked in the soup an hour. Soup may, in like manner, be made of Thames flounders, plaice, or any of the flat fish. CODLING AND HADDOCK SOUP. 61. —Take the meat from a codling, pound it in a mortar with 4 pint of shrimps shelled; shred some parsley, and pound the whole with the crumb of a roll previously soaked in milk ; make the mixture up into balls with an egg ; season with mace and pepper; and stew down 2 or 3 codlings or haddocks into good broth ; strain it, take out the meat, pulp it through a sieve, boil it with parsley-roots, thicken the soup, and send it up with the forcemeat-balls. A CoiVs-head also forms an admirable soup ; but in London and other great towns they are too expensive to be thus used. Halibut is, however, cheap, and good soup may be made from it; as also from hake and ling, which both bear an inferior price in our markets.Chap. VII.] 105 FISH SOUPS. LOBSTER SOUP.—E. R. 62.—If prepared fish-stock be not used, the stock of this soup may be made of small codlings, eels, plaice, flounders, or any fish not of sufficient consequence to be dressed in any other way. Clean and cut them in pieces, take the meat out of 1 or 2 lobsters, cut it into small but handsome pieces, and lay it aside ; break the shell and add it to the fish for the stock, which should be boiled gently for several hours ; take the coral of the lobster, pound it in a mortar, with a small piece of the stock, partly pounded, and make it up into forcemeat- balls, with a little chopped parsley, bread-crumbs, and an egg. When the stock is sufficiently done, strain it, thicken it with butter and flour, or cream; warm the lobster in it, and send it up, cut small, with the forcemeat-balls. Season it also deli- cately, but yet sufficiently to give it flavour, which can be imparted by any of the compound sauces so commonly adver- tised. If made of large lobsters, and sufficient for a party, it is, however, rather expensive, and can be made of the following, which is equally good for the purpose, and much cheaper, as being without the large claws of the lobster. CRA YFISH SO UP. . 63.—Take 50 crayfish; pull out the gut which is attached to the centre fin of the tail, as it gives great bitterness to the soup ; boil them in salt and water until they are red ; pick the meat from the tails ; pound the bodies with f lb. of butter ; put this into a stewpan with 2 French rolls and some fish or meat stock; boil for 1 hour ; rub through a tammy ; do not let it boil; add the tails, and then serve. This fish, it should be observed, is the small fresh-water crayfish , but good soup can be made of large or small crabs, I prawns, and shrimps; the latter of which have much the best flavour. They may, all or either, be made into soup alone; or if mixed whole, or pounded into the puree of any other fish- soup, they will prove an excellent addition. Their shells and small claws may, indeed, be made into a paste by pounding them in a mortar with a lump of fresh butter, and putting the paste to stew until quite hot, when it must be strained and put into cold water, after which it may be potted and used for various purposes.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VII. 106 OYSTER SOUR. 64. —Take 50 oysters, blanch them, but do not let them boil; strain them through a sieve, and save the liquor. Put t lb. of butter into a stewpan; when it is melted, add 6 oz. of flour; stir it over the fire for a few minutes; add the liquor from the oysters, 2 quarts of veal stock, 1 quart of new milk; season with salt, peppercorns, a little cayenne pepper, a blade of mace, Harvey sauce and essence of anchovies, a tablespoonful each ; strain it through a tammy; let it boil 10 minutes; put the oysters into the tureen with a gill of cream, and pour the boiling soup upon them. Or:—Take 2 quarts of fish-stock. Have ready a quart of oysters; remove the beards and tough parts of the centre, and stew them in the stock ; beat the oysters in a mortar with the yolks of 6 hard-boiled eggs; put this into the liquor taken from the stewed beards, let it simmer for an hour, adding a large spoonful of essence of anchovy ; a little before serving put in pint of cream; after which the soup must not be suffered to boil. A more common plan is to take 2 large onions, and stick them with cloves, a very small bunch of sweet herbs, some whole black pepper, a blade of mace, and a hard crust of bread toasted a pale brown. Put all these into 3 quarts of water, and let it boil until reduced to 2; then strain it off. When tender, put all into your soup with 2 or 3 anchovies. Then take a couple of score of large oysters, or a half-hundred of Miltons, bearded, and let them be fried a pale brown ; put them and their liquor into the soup, and let them all boil together ^ of an hour. It will keep some days, and is better the second day than the first. Good soupe-maigre may also be made from clams, whilks, cockles, and even from that contemptible little shell-fish the periwinkle; but if muscles be used, care should be taken to beard them, and take out the small crabs of which they form part, as they are thought to be poisonous. EEL SOUP. 65. —Take 3 lbs. of small eels, and skin them; bone 1 or 2 ; cut them in very small pieces ; fry them very lightly in a stewpan with a bit of butter and a sprig of parsley. Put to the remainder 3 quarts of water, a crust of bread, 3 blades of107 Chap. VII.] FISH SOUPS. mace, some whole pepper, an onion, and a bunch of sweet herbs; cover them close, and stew till the fish breaks from the bones; then strain it off; pound it to a paste, and pass it through a sieve. Toast some bread, cut it into dice, and pour the soup on it boiling. Add the scollops of eel, and serve. The soup will be as rich as if made of meat, i pint of cream, or milk, with a teaspoonful of flour rubbed smooth in it, is a great improvement. To every pound of eels add a quart of water, and let the whole boil till one-half of the liquor is wasted. The soup of conger eels is also said to be good, but the fish has not the richness of the fresh-water eel, and can only be recommended by its cheapness. LAKE AND POND FISH SOUP. 66. —For every person take a pound each of pike, perch, roach, dace, gudgeon, carp and tench, eels, or any fresh-water fish that can be obtained; wash them in salt and water, and stew them with a tomata, carrots, leeks, fried onions, and sweet herbs, in as much water as will cover them ; and let them stew until the whole is reduced to a pulp; then strain the liquor, and boil it for another hour until it becomes quite smooth. Then have ready some roots of any sort that may be in season, which have been chopped small, and boiled either in milk or •water: add them to the soup, and let it simmer for ^ of an hour; season it, if milk has been used, with mace and celery, with a little cayenne; but if made solely with water, then use chili vinegar, soy, mushroom ketchup, or any of the savoury sauces. FISH SOUP AND STEW.—E. 11. 67. —Make the stock of any sort of fish, then take cntlets of sole, brill, gurnet, or any other fish, and stew them in the following manner:—Chop all kinds of sweet herbs, a small bit of garlic, or rub the board on which the herbs are chopped with garlic; an onion or two, 3 carrots, and 2 or 3 turnips; stew these for a few minutes in butter, then add one part wine to two of water, according to the quantity of fish, and the juice of y a lemon. Stew the marinade together for ^ of an hour, strain it, and, when cold, put in the fish cutlets, and simmer them very gently until the liquor is reduced; then add it to tile first stock, thicken the soup with i pint of cream, and108 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VII. send up the cutlets in a separate dish, covered either with a bat- ter made of flour, egg’s, and milk; or with a sauce made with a few spoonfuls of flour, with a little salt, olive-oil, and wine of any sort, heated in a pan, and seasoned. This will answer in a small party for both fish and soup. TURTLE SOUP MAIGRE. 68.—Having thus enumerated most of the cheap fish which may be made into soup, with the addition of vegetable and fish stock, we here add the present receipt, as being likely to form a superior kind of soupe-maigre; for although always looked upon as a meat-soup, in consequence of its being made upon a foundation of veal-broth (which must be admitted to be in all cases the best stock as a basis for fish-soup), yet the turtle, though amphibious, and laying its numerous eggs upon the land, where they are buried in the sand, and engendered by the heat of the sun, has ever been ranked among the race of fish, as living chiefly in the sea; and as arrangements have, it seems, been made for killing the animals in the West Indies, and bringing over, in jars, the flesh, which comes here in a state of jelly, this only needs to be stewed up in a broth of vegetable or fish stock, instead of meat, and in such quantity as to make the jelly suffi- ciently limpid for soup: seasoning it in the same manner as the other receipt; but adding a rather larger proportion of curry-powder and a few truffles to correct the vapidity of the fish and vegetable broth; but the process of preparing the turtle must be altered, as it is at present prepared with an acid which no boiling will remove. SOUPES MAIGRE. 69.—Pare and slice 5 or 6 cucumbers; and add to these the inside of as many cos-lettuces, a sprig or two of mint, 2 or 3 onions, some pepper and salt, a pint and a hall of young peas, and a little parsley. Put these, with lb- °f fresh butter, into a saucepan, to stew in their own liquor, near a gentle fire, an hour; then pour 2 quarts of boiling water to the vegetables, and stew them 2 hours ; rub down a little flour into a teacupful of water, boil it with the rest 15 or 20 minutes, and serve it. Or:—Peel and slice G large onions, 6 potatoes, 6 carrots, and 4 turnips; fry them in lb. of butter, and pour on them109 SOUPES MAIGEE. Chap. VII.] 4 quarts of boiling water. Toast a crust of bread as brown and hard as possible, but do not burn it; put it with some celery, sweet herbs, white pepper, and salt to the above; stew it all gently 4 hours, then strain it through a coarse cloth : have ready sliced carrot, celery, and a little turnip, and stew them tender in the soup. If approved, add an anchovy and a spoon- ful of ketchup, with toasted bread, or the crumb of a French roll, cut in slices, at the bottom of the tureen. Or:—One gallon of water, a very large soup-plate of car- rots, turnips, and onions, with celery cut small, and all fried in either butter or dripping (though, if not a fast day, dripping is best), sufficient to brown it, but doing it slowly, and stirring it frequently to prevent its burning. Add 1 tablespoonful of flour to thicken it, and another of ketchup to flavour it; anti if you can get a tomata and a green capsicum, put them in also, with pepper and salt to season it. Let it stew for full 8 hours, or until the quantity has been reduced to one half, when it will be quite sufficient for 6 or 8 people, at the cost of little more, if so much, as Is. PEASE-PORRIDGE.—E. R. 70. —Fry a couple of onions and a stick of celery, and put them, with a bundle of sweet herbs, a couple of anchovies, or -L a red herring, into 3 quarts of water, with a crust of bread, floured, pepper and salt; boil all together very gently until the flavour is extracted from the herbs; then skim the liquor, and strain it. Add a pound of raw potatoes grated, and a pint of split peas ; when the peas are soft, beat them through a sieve with the soup, and if the porridge should not be thick enough, add a little flour and butter. Cut half a dozen leeks into pieces, and, after the peas have been beaten, boil them in the soup, and send them to table. SPLIT PEA-SOUP MAIGRE.—E. R. 71. —To a quart of whole or split peas put 3 quarts of water; boil gently until the peas are dissolved, then pulp them through a sieve, and add 3 anchovies or a red herring, carrots, turnips, leeks, thyme, and sweet marjoram, and stew them together. Before serving, add some ketchup and salt, thicken the soup with butter, and send it up with fried bread. Frying the bread will make the soup richer. The addition of mush- room-ketchup will partly give it the flavour of meat.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VII. no GREEN PEA-SOUP MAIGRE.—E. R. 72. —Take 5 or 6 cucumbers, pared and sliced, the white part of as many cos-lettuces, a sprig or two of mint, 2 or 3 onions, some pepper and salt, a full pint of young peas, a little parsley, and ± lb. of butter. Put them all together in a sauce- pan to stew in their own liquor for an hour and a half, or until they are quite tender; then boil as many old peas, pulp them through a colander, and mix in a quart of the liquor or more, according to the thickness which may be desirable: when the herbs are stewed put them in, and serve up. This soup will be found excellent. Or:—As used in Italy.-—Boil a quart of full-grown peas in gallon of water until tender enough to pulp through a coarse sieve; then put the pulp, a cos-lettuce, 2 good-sized cucumbers sliced, and a pint of young peas, into the liquor. Stew gently, until the vegetables become extremely tender; then add pepper and salt to your taste, chopped mint, and 2 oz. of butter rubbed in a spoonful of flour, and boil 10 minutes. A more elaborate method.—Slice a French roll, and boil it in 6 quarts of water until it is perfectly dissolved; take all the old peas found in a peck and a half, keeping the young ones separate ; boil the old peas with the bread and water, and when tender strain them; reserve the Avater, and pulp the peas through a sieve, putting them by for the present; boil the young peas, Avith a sprig of mint, a little mace and pepper, in the strained soup, and Avhile they are simmering put ^ lb. of butter into a frying-pan, and Avlien it boils cut in 2 lettuces, 2 handfuls of young spinach, a little parsley chopped, a dozen of small silver onions, and 2 cucumbers cut in slices. After steAv- ing for some time, add a large tablespoonful of flour, the pulped peas, and then that Avhicli has the young peas in it, simmering the Avhole together for 10 minutes. POTATO SOUP MAIGRE. 73. —Take some large mealy potatoes; peel and cut them into small slices, Avith an onion ; boil them in 3 pints of water till tender, and then pulp them through a colander; add a small piece of butter, a little cayenne pepper and salt, and, just before the soup is served, 2 spoonfuls of good cream. The soup must not be alloAved to boil after the cream has been put into it.SOUPES MAIGRE. Chap. VII.] Ill N.T).—This will be found a most excellent soup, and, being easily and quickly made, is useful upon an emergency, when such an addition is suddenly required to the dinner. ONION SOUP MAIGRE. 74. —Slice a dozen large onions—Spanish, if they can be got—with a couple of turnips and 2 heads of celery. Fry them in J-lb. of butter until quite brown, but not allowing them to burn. When of a nice colour, put them into a gallon of boiling water, with either a soft-roed red herring, or 2 or 3 anchovies, or a tablespoonful of anchovy sauce, seasoned with a few blades of pounded mace and some grains of allspice, pepper, and salt, and let the whole stew until it is tender enough to pulp. When ready, have the crumb of a couple of French rolls boiled in milk, and pass them along with the vegetables through the colander. Put it again on the fire to stew for a few minutes till quite hot; and if not sufficiently thick, add the yolks of raw eggs, to be beaten up into the soup when just going to be put on the table. CABBAGE, SPINACH, AND LETTUCE SOUPES-MAIGIiES. 75. —Put from 4 lb. to a lb. of salt butter in a stewpan, according to the quantity wanted: throw in 3 or 4 sliced onions to brown; when nicely coloured, add the vegetables .cut fine, along with a small handful of peppercorns, a handful of chervil and sorrel, a few cloves, and the necessary quantity of salt, and let all simmer together until tender, though not so soft as to become a pulp. That done, beat up the yolks of a few eggs with the pith of a French roll or two wetted in some ginger-wine until they become thoroughly soaked; beat them up with a fork, and mix them gradually with the soup to thicken it. It should then be served immediately. A squeeze of lemon may be added.112 MODERN" DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VIII. CHAPTER VIII. BEEF. Beef is dressed in various ways all the year round ; but, for roasting, the best season is from November to the end of March. For joints, the only really good roasting pieces are the sir- loin and the long ribs; the short ribs, which are cut near the neck, never roast well, and should not be used for this pur- pose ; the middle ribs are the best. The under part, or fillet, of the sirloin, if cut out, may be made into a delicious stew; or, if cut crosswise into steaks, they will be found more tender than those of the rump. Some persons divide the round, and roast the half called the upper side, which in young beef is tender and full of gravy. The silver side should be salted, being one of the best boiling pieces in the ox. The aitch-bone, although almost invariably salted and boiled, yet, if roasted when fresh, makes perhaps the richest gravy of any part of the ox; but, when cold, is not so good as if salted. Beef requires to be hung a long time, in order to ensure its being tender. When, however, the weather is not favourable for keeping, it will be much improved by being laid for a few hours previous to roasting in a marinade of this kind—three parts water to one of vinegar, some salt, with a few pepper- corns. Each joint must be carefully examined before it is spitted, and any portions that may have been injured cut away. In Scotland, meat of every sort is preserved by covering it completely with oatmeal, taking it out every day, wiping it, and then replacing it in the meal; and should it appear at all tainted, it is soaked for some hours in oatmeal and water before being dressed: or strewing over it some coarsely-powdered charcoal will materially assist in its preservation. RIBS OF BEEF ROASTED. 76.—Cut out the chine-bones from the thick end of the ribs,113 BEEF. Chap. VIII.] and also the strong sinew or leather; fasten the “bark,” or outside fat, with a few skewers ; spit it through the thick part and the point of the ribs. When one or two ribs are purchased by a small family, it is a good plan to have the bones taken out, and the meat rolled round in the shape of a fillet; a con- siderable saving is effected by this plan, as, when not so pre- pared, the thin part at the extremity of the bone is frequently wasted. The bone cut out when the meat is raw will assist in making soup, and is much preferable to a cold beef-bone. They are sometimes cut off short, and salted or stewed, but rolling is the better plan ; and in this manner a single rib can be skewered into a handsome fillet; the fat and lean being marbled, and the appearance of the whole improved. TO COLLAR RIBS OF BEEF. 77. —Take 2 or 3 ribs of beef; cut it from the bones ; rub it well with salt, brown sugar, and saltpetre; let it remain a fortnight, turning it every day ; then season it with pepper, I mace, cloves, allspice, and a clove of garlic chopped very fine; cover it well with parsley, thyme, and sw'eet marjoram; roll it up very tight, and bind it round with tape; put it into a pot with some water, cover it close up, and send it to the oven to be baked very slowly 3 or 4 hours; then take it out, and I press it between 2 boards with weights. This is an excellent I dish for luncheon or breakfast. A Marinade to baste Roust Meats.—Chop up some fat bacon with a clove of garlic and a sprig of parsley ; add salt, pepper, a spoonful of vinegar, and 4 spoonfuls of oil ; beat it 1 up well, and baste the meat with it. STRLOTN OF BEEF ROASTED. 78. —Break the upper part of the chine-bones, cut them out, and cut through the strong gristle on the top about an inch apart, and skewer it in its place, which will prevent its drawing up or looking unsightly. Run the spit just under the bark at the thin end, and bring it out between the joints. By spitting it thus you avoid showing where the spit has gone through. Cover the fat with a sheet of buttered paper, and roast, gently for 3 or 4 hours, according to the size of the | joint. The under part is sometimes stuffed with forcemeat, in the following manner:—•MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VIII. good brown gravy, and stew them gently for 4 an hour; add Carefully lift up the fat from the inside of the sirloin with a sharp knife; take out all the meat close to the bone, and mince it small; take i lb. of suet, and chop it fine ; mix with it some grated bread - crumbs, a little lemon - peel, thyme, and eschalot minced very fine; mix all together with a glass of port wine; put it back again into the same place, and cover it with the skin and fat; skewer it down neatly with small wooden skewers, and cover it with paper. The meat should be spitted before you take out the inside; and when done do not take off the paper until the joint is put into the dish : then serve it up garnished with scraped horseradish. The method of taking the meat from the bone, and rolling it so as to have the forcemeat in the middle, is easier, but adds its flavour to the whole joint; while this way keeps the upper and the under part separate. To dress the inside of a Sirloin, cut it out in one piece, if not used at table; stew it with good broth or gravy, a little spice, and a tablespoonful of walnut-ketchup. Serve with chopped pickles. To dress the inside of a cold Sirloin, cut out all the meat, and a little fat into pieces as thick as your finger, and 4 inches long; dredge them with flour, and fry in butter of a nice brown: drain the butter from the meat, and toss it up in a rich gravy, seasoned with pepper, salt, anchovy, and shalot. Do not let it boil on any account. Before you serve, add 2 spoonfuls of vinegar and a glass of port wine. Garnish with crimped parsley. Or:—Cut the meat in slices about 4 inches long, and 4 an inch thick, the fat with the lean ; season them with pepper and salt, and fry them in good fresh butter; have ready someChap. VIII.] 115 BEEF. a little mushroom ketchup, and a tablespoonful of eschalot vinegar, with a wine-glass of port, and just before serving put in a small piece of butter rolled in flour. Serve hot in a covered dish. This part is called the “ Fillet,” and, when raw, may be either stewed whole or in the above manner. FILLET OF BEEF. 79.— To dress the inside of a Sirloin of Beef to taste like Hare.—Take the inside of a large sirloin that has hung until tender; soak it 24 hours in a few glasses of port wine and vinegar. Have ready a good stuffing as for hare; do not spread, but put it into the middle of the beef, and roll it up tight. Roast, it on a hanging spit, and baste it with a glass of the wine and vinegar, mixed with a teaspoonful of Jamaica pepper, and a clove or two, in the finest powder, until it is all dried up ; then baste with butter. Serve with a rich gravy in the dish, and currant-jelly sauce in a tureen. B UMP OF BEEF. SO.—If of a well-fed ox, and hung till tender, this is one of the most juicy and best flavoured of all the joints of beef, but is more frequently stewed than roasted. It is generally sold in the country undivided from the aitch-bone ; or cut across, and not lengthwise, as in London, which makes it too large for one dressing, and neither fit for boiling: nor roasting1. At family dinners, a Yorkshire pudding is a usual accompa- niment, but now seldom served at genteel tables. TO S TE W BEEF. 81.—It should be put down in a pot with just sufficient cold water to cover the meat, and closely covered. After boiling 3 or 4 hours, according to the size of the piece, cut in small pieces, not larger than dice, 2 or 3 carrots and heads of celery, with a little sweet herbs, and put them into the pot along with peppercorns, mace, and a couple of large onions stuck full of cloves, and let it then simmer by the side of the fire for 2 to 3 hours, taking care to skim off any grease that may appear on the top. I>y this time the meat will probably be tender enough ; when take out the whole onions, mince them, and fry them in butter, to be mixed in the gravy made by the meat, which season with salt and cayenne, or chili-vinegar, to which addMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VIII. some mushroom or walnut ketchup. Thicken the gravy with a little flour, and brown it, if necessary, with a spoonful of sugar burnt soft ; which, besides im- parting its colour, adds an agreeable flavour. Such is the most simple mode; but the sauce may be much improved by a glass or two of port wine and a spoonful of curry powder: if the odour of garlic be not ob- jected to, a clove boiled in the stew will be found to give it a fine flavour. Garnish with vegetables. A small piece of beef—say of 4 lbs.—will take the time mentioned ; but the large joints will require full double that time; and should be put to stew overnight, adding the vege- tables in the morning. Stewed Beef. Rump of Beef Steiu.—Half-roast it; then put it into a pot with 3 pints of water, a pound of sliced bacon, a bunch of sweet herbs, 2 wine-glasses of vinegar, and a bottle of cider or small wine; stick cloves into a couple of large onions, add a few sage-leaves, and cover the beef closely, adding more water should there not be sufficient gravy from the meat. Let it simmer for 3 hours; then strain the gravy. Boil or bake some button onions, and lay them round the beef; cover it also with forcemeat balls, fried ornaments of paste, and mush- rooms, if in season; add to the gravy a glass of port wine, a spoonful of soy and Oude sauce; boil down a part to a glaze, and put it on the beef: thicken the remainder if necessary, and pour it round, garnishing the dish with pickles. Or :—Season it high with cayenne, salt, allspice, cloves, and a blade of mace, all in fine powder. Bind it up tight, and lay it into a pot that will just hold it; resting it on 2 or 3 twigs, to prevent the meat from sticking. Fry 3 large onions sliced, and put them to it, with 'carrots, turnips, a shalot, a blade of mace, and some celery. Cover the meat with good beef-broth, and simmer it as gently as possible for several hours until quite tender. Clear off the fat; and add to the gravy 4 pint of port wine, a small glass of chili vinegar, and a large spoon- ful of ketchup; simmer £ an hour, and serve in a deep dish.BEEF. 117 Chap. VIII.] The herbs to be used should be burnet, tarragon, parsley, thyme, basil, marjoram, and all or any of the most savoury sort. Or:—Prepare the beef as directed in the foregoing receipts, and glaze it twice; stew some white haricot beans in good brown gravy, with an onion sliced, a carrot, some parsley, and a bunch of sweet herbs, a clove of garlic, a bay-leaf, and a slice of lean ham ; let all simmer gently together till the beans are sufficiently tender; then separate them from the other vegetables, and put them in a sieve to drain ; pass the sauce and vegetables through a tammy, add a tablespoonful of vinegar, and, if not thick enough, a bit of butter rolled in Hour; put in the haricot beans, make all boiling hot, and pour the sauce into the dish round the beef. Brisket of Beef Stewed.—Stew it in sufficient water to cover the meat; when quite tender, take out the bones, and skim off the fat; add to the gravy, when strained, a glass of wine and a little spice tied up in a muslin bag. Ilave ready either mushrooms, truffles, or vegetables boiled, and cut into shapes. Lay them on and round the beef; reduce part of the gravy to a glaze, lay it on the top, and pour the remainder into the dish. It is a good piece to be stewed, as it may be cut from the bone, and of any size. • Leg of Beef Stewed.—Salt 6 lbs. of the half-leg, or stiff marrow-bone of beef, for 3 or 4 days. Make holes in it about 1? inch deep, and press in, very hard, forcemeat made in the following manner: 14 lb. of suet sliced very fine, pepper, salt, and a few cloves, some winter savory, and sweet marjoram, mixed well together. The beef must be baked in a deep pan, with water reaching about three-quarters of the way up, and forcemeat spread over the top, which, when the meat is baked, is taken off, cut into shapes, and laid round the dish. BOUILLON 82.—Is the common soup of France, and is in use in almost every French family. Put into an earthen stock-pot in the proportion of 1 lb. of beef to 1 quart of cold water. Place it on the side of the fire, and let it become slowly hot. By so doing the fibre of the meat is enlarged, the gelatine is dis-118 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VIII. solved, and the savorous parts of the meat are diffused through the broth. When the object is simply to make a good, pure- flavoured beef broth, part of the shin or leg will answer the purpose, adding some vegetables, and letting it stew 4 or 5 hours; but if the meat is to be eaten, the rump or leg-of- mutton piece should be used. BOUILLI. 83.—The rump of beef is best for this purpose, as the meat is to be served up in a separate dish, and will make a finely-flavoured sort of soup. Take as much of it as may be thought necessary; but for a small party, say from 4 to 6 lbs., along with 2 or 3 large roasted onions, in one of which some cloves may be stuck, and a moderate quantity of whole pepper, with a bunch of sweet herbs; to which an anchovy may be added : put it in a stewpan, covered with rather more than a pint of cold water to every pound of meat; and let it simmer by the side of the fire for 4 or 5 hours, or until it has become quite tender; then take out the herbs and onions, and add carrots, turnips, and celery, either cut into small squares or sliced, and let the whole boil until sufficiently stewed, and ready for the table. The soup should then be strained off, and served separately, leaving only so much as may be necessary for making sauce for the vegetables. The sauce should be a little thickened, and seasoned to the palate; if a clove of garlic, or a tea- spoonful of garlic and chili vinegar, be added, it will improve the flavour. In Ireland it is not uncommon to send up the bouilli smothered in onion-sauce, the other vegetables being either not used, or brought up in the soup ; in France it is very usual to dress cabbage and sausages as an accompaniment to the bouilli; but, in England, it is more customary to serve it up with the vegetable-sauce as above stated. Cucumbers cut into dice and stewed, with a spoonful of chili vinegar added, are served at most of the German hotels. The meat, if gently stewed until quite tender, without being boiled to rags, will be found excellent, and the whole an admirable dish. Take a handsome piece of brisket of 10 lbs. weight; put it over the fire with a small quantity of water until the gravy is out; add a very large bunch of parsley, pepper, salt, and an onion. When the gravy is drawn, add 2 gallons of boiling water, and let it stew until perfectly tender; chop the parsley,Chap. BEEF. 119 and lay it on the top of the meat, thicken the gravy with vegetables, and serve it up. Or:—Take about 9 lbs. of the beef, tie it tightly with a tape, and put it into a stewpan with just sufficient water to cover it: add onions, celery, a little parsley, and spice: allow it to boil gently, and, when about half done, add a large an- chovy. Cut a small quantity of carrots, greens, and capers very fine, mix them with a part of the soup ; let them stew till | tender, and then serve them with the beef, laying part on the top and the rest round; or, served up separately, and smo- thered in onion sauce. The tops of the long ribs make good bouilli, simmered in a small quantity of water, and served on a bed of red cabbage, stewed separately, and flavoured with a glass of vinegar. It also eats excellently, if, when simply boiled, it is served up smothered with onion sauce. Ribs of beef though rarely dressed en bouilli, are yet most excellent when so prepared. Take the middle of the flat ribs of beef, stew it until the meat is tender and the bones will come out, employing as small a quantity of water as will cover the meat, and a bundle of sweet herbs. Let it stand until it is cold, remove the fat, add to the gravy, carrots, turnips, and celery, cut in dice, and a dozen or two of small silver onions; warm up the beef in it, and send it to table. * BCEUF TREMBLANT.—E. R. 84.—Cut a handsome piece of beef from the rump, either a fillet or square; hang it up for 4 days, then put it all night to soak in a pickle of salt and vinegar; put it into a stewpan, and let it be covered with water; add a seasoning of whole pepper and salt, a bundle of sweet herbs, and an onion. Let it simmer very slowly as long as it will hang together, taking care to skim it well. Strain the gravy, and add to it carrots previously boiled, and cut into pieces an inch long; add also a few capers and a mushroom, with a glass of wine and the juice of a lemon. When the beef has been sufficiently stewed take it up, and set it for a short time in a Dutch oven, and glaze it, or brown it with a salamander. A small rump of beef may be dressed in the same manner. In France, besides tiie pot-au-fcu already described, it is teiy usual to stew about <3 lbs. of beef with a small piece of120 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VIII. liver and a veal bone, or the remains of a fowl, with its head and elaws, in 2 quarts of water put into an earthen vessel and placed beside a wood-fire early in the morning, so as to be ready by dinner-time. When the meat has boiled once, it is skimmed, and salted; carrots, turnips, with a fried onion and any vegetables in season, are minced and allowed to simmer gently in it until the whole contents are stewed tender ; but the meat is served separately, and thin .slices of bread are put into the broth to thicken it, unless rice or vermicelli be employed for that pur- pose. It makes an ample meal for 8 to 10 hearty persons, as soup is not, in that country, usually made very strong of the meat. In Germany nearly the same practice is followed throughout the greater part of the country; only that small sausages and chopped cabbage are more used than either rice or vermicelli, and that sour cream is substituted for paste as thickening. The quantity of meat is also smaller, and the vegetables, which form the chief part of the stew, are all fried in dripping; the whole mess is also brought to table. Cold meat is seldom brought to table, being generally pounded and made up into moulds, covered with bread-crumbs and browned ; but in no instance is cayenne or any sort of pepper largely used, and often entirely omitted. A FAMILY STEW OF BEEF.—E. R. 85. —Take any piece of beef good for stewing, cut it into small pieces, slice 2 or 3 large onions, and put them into the stewpan with 2 ounces of butter or good beef-dripping. When melted, dredge in some flour, add the meat also dredged with flour, and enough water to keep it from burning. When the gravy has drawn, fill up with boiling water, let it come to a boil gently, skim the pot well, then add a spoonful of mixed spices, and a bay-leaf or two ; set the pan by the side of the fire to stew slowly for a couple of hours. 11 lbs. of meat will take 4 hours. This dish may be thickened like Irish stew, with potatoes, or it may be served with the addition of chopped vegetables of all kinds, previously fried. STEWEJ) BEEFSTEAKS.—E. R. 86. —Put the steak into a stewpan with a lump of butter over a slow fire, and turn it until the butter has become a fineBEEF. 121 Chap. VIII.] white gravy, then pour it into a basin, and put more butter to the steak. When the steak is nicely done, take it out, return all the gravy into the stewpan, and fry the steak ; then add it to the gravy in the stewpan, with a tablespoonful of wine, and a shalot finely sliced; stew it for 10 minutes, and serve it up. Or, fry the steak merely at first, then put it into k pint of water, an onion sliced, a spoonful of walnut ketchup, pepper and salt, cover it close, thicken it with Hour and butter, and serve it up very hot. With Vegetables.—Cut the steak about 2^ inches thick ; dredge it with flour, and fry it in butter, of a fine brown. Lay it in a stewpan, and pour water into the frying-pan ; let it boil, and add it to the steak, which is rendered richer by this pro- cess ; slice in turnips, carrots, celery, and onions, adding I pepper, salt, and a little mace. It should be highly seasoned, and sent to table with the surface ornamented with forcemeat balls, carrots and turnips cut into shapes, and sometimes with I onion fritters, the vegetables to be put round it. With Ogsters.—Cut the steak rather thick ; brown it in a I frying-pan with butter. Add J pint of water, an onion sliced, pepper and salt, cover the pan close, and let it stew very slowly for 1 hour; then add a glass of port wine, a little flour, 1 and a dozen or two of oysters, their liquor having been previ- I ously strained and put into the stewpan. • With Cucumbers, it may be dressed the same way, only using white wine instead of port; the cucumbers to be stewed separately in a little gravy or broth, and added to the beef 5 minutes before serving; fry the cucumbers, and stew them in the water poured into the pan after the fat is poured off; if I stewed with the steak they will make it hard. A distinction should be always made between Hump-steak and Beef-steak, as the latter is very inferior ; but a slice cut from the sirloin is most excellent. See Section II. Bit OI LED B UMP-S TEA K.—E. It. 87.—Cut the steaks about £ inch thick, from a rump of beef that has hung until quite tender ; let the gridiron be hot, well rubbed with beef suet, and the fire clear.

VIII. 122 a hot dish, and send them instantly to table, for, if not eaten hot, the steak will become soddened. Should it not have hung long enough to be tender, beat it with a rolling-pin; put no salt on, or it will harden the steak. The grand secret is a cjuick clear fire, frequent turning, and quick cooking; for if the meat be long upon the fire it will be hard. Respecting frequent or only once turning, that must depend on whether the steak is to be done in the usual way,—that the gravy may not be drawn out on either side ; or whether it is to be done “ rare”—that is to say, very much underdone. If in the former case, the steak should be cut only ^ inch—but, if rare, f inch—thick, turning it only once, and the fire should be more brisk than in the former case; by which means the meat will be sufficiently scorched on both sides, without being burned. It is not in perfection if served with anything else ; if approved, a little minced shalot and a tablespoonful of ketchup may be put into the dish, and it may be garnished with horseradish : to pepper it is to spoil it. Such is the mode of dressing it at Bellamy’s of the House of Commons, at the Blue Posts in Cork Street, and at all the chop-houses around the Royal Exchange. The steak, if large enough, should be cut in two ; one part being sent up first, and the remainder afterwards, this second course being always the best. Ten minutes will be sufficient to cook a large steak if it be rare ; but if well done, from that to j hour. Respecting the dressing of steaks, we have heard it asserted that not one cook in ten knows how to prepare a beefsteak; they neglect the grand rule, which is to separate the fat from the lean; to put it on the gridiron first, and take it off’ last, so as to broil it half as long again as the lean. That makes it pulpy, like marrow. FOR BOILING BEEF. 88.— To boil a Round of Beef—Supposing it to be from 20 to 30 lbs. weight, and very salt,a soak it in 2 waters; wash it well, and take out the bone ; the cavity made by its removal may be plugged up with fat; then skewer the meat up with the flap round it, and bind it firmly with several folds of strong “ 1 oz. of saltpetre, 1 lb. of common salt, and 2 oz. of brown sugar, will be sufficient for 1G lbs. of beef.Chap. Till.] 123 BEEF. tape; put it into a large pot, well covered with cold water, and hang it over a moderate fire, to let it boil slowly, that it may heat gradually all through; take off the scum as it rises, and, when no more appears, keep the pot closely covered. Turn the meat twice while it is boiling; and, about 2 hours before it is done, put in some carrots, cut into large pieces; if you have parsnips, let them be mashed ; but if you use greens or cabbage, boil them separately; and, with boiled salt beef, never use turnips. A round of this size will take full 6 hours to boil it pro- perly ; that is to say, neither too much over nor under done ; and, if only of 12 to 15 lbs., will require nearly 4 to 5 hours. To boil a Rump of Beef mix some common salt, a little saltpetre, some parsley, thyme, marjoram, green onions, pepper, and salt, and rub all well into your meat, and let it lie 3 or 4 days ; then put it into a pot, and fill it with water; add some celery, with 2 or 3 sliced carrots, and small whole onions ; let it do gently for 3 or 4 hours, according to the size, and serve with the vegetables neatly placed in the dish. The other joints that are usually salted and boiled are the aitchbone and the brisket. B UBBLE-AND-S Q UEAK.—E. R. 8!).—Cut slices from a cold boiled round or rump of beef; let them be fried quickly until brown, and put them into a dish to be kept hot. Clean the pan from the fat; put into it greens and carrots previously boiled and chopped small, or, in- stead of these, large onions sliced thin and fried, though both the latter are sometimes omitted. Add a little butter, pepper, and salt; make them very hot, and put them round the beef with a little gravy. Cold pork boiled is thought by some to be a better material for bubble-and-squeak than beef, which Ls sometimes hard. In either case the slices should be very thin, and lightly fried. BAKED BEEF. 90.—A Rump of 20 to 25 lbs. weight.-—Take 2 ounces each of pepper and allspice, 1 ounce of pounded cloves, and the same quantity of mace; rub this all over the joint, which should be hung up for a fortnight or three weeks, according to the weather—taking care to keep it dry, and to occasionallyMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VIII. 124 renew the seasoning. When ready for baking, wash off the spice with port wine, and lard the rump throughout—not in the common mode used by poulterers, but by inserting large lardoons in different parts of the meat. Then put a large quantity of suet, shred fine, both under and over it, and cover it with coarse flour and water paste, between which and the suet you may put a few bay-leaves or some sweet-herbs. If eaten hot, the dough, bay-leaves, and suet must all be taken off; the joint basted, sprinkled with a little salt and flour, over which a salamander should be passed ; and served up with strong gravy or brown sauce. If cold, leave on the dough till wanted. It should be baked in a moderately-heated oven, and will take, according to the size, from 6 to 8 hours’ baking. A Round of Beef may be dressed in the same manner; but the bone should in that case be taken out, and the bole filled up with forcemeat. The flap should be filled in like manner, skewered, and tightly bound round with linen or strong tape, in which case the dough and the larding may be omitted, though the latter will be found an improvement. It should be always left until cold. Brisket.—Take all the bones out of 8 lbs. of brisket of beef; make holes in it about an inch asunder, and fill one with fat bacon, a second with parsley, a third with oysters, and so on, each being chopped and seasoned with pepper, salt, nut- meg, and cloves. When completely stuffed, lay it in a pan, di’edge it well with flour, pour upon it 4 pint of port, and the same of broth. Bake it 3 hours, and then skim off the fat; put the meat into a dish, strain the gravy over, and garnish with pickles. Any piece of fresh beef, even of the coarsest pieces, may be dressed in this manner, or baked before the fire in a Dutch oven with button onions, the meat being previously rubbed over with oil. It is a common mode in Portugal and Spain. There, however, the forcemeat and spice are omitted; but the beef is always larded with pledgets of bacon of the size of a woman’s little finger, inserted into several punctures throughout the inside of the meat, to which are added some cloves of garlic, and tlie piece covered with thick brown sauce when brought to table. Scarlet Beef.—Take 3 lbs. of tender lean beef from theBEEF. Chap. YIII.] 125 round, and rub it well with the following ingredients:—Mix equal proportions of mace, allspice, black pepper, salt, sugar, and saltpetre. Rub this well into your meat; let it lie 5 or 6 days, turning it daily, and repeatedly rubbing in the mix- ture ; then roll it and tie it firmly round with wide tape ; put it into a jar which will just hold it, with the spice, and a little beef-suet over and under it; tie it down close, and bake it gently until tender. It is eaten cold, and should be cut in thin slices and garnished with parsley. Another way to dress Scarlet Beef.—Take a brisket or thin flank of beef, and rub it well all over with equal quantities of common and bay salt, and an ounce of saltpetre; let it remain for 4 or 5 days in an earthen pan, when it will become red; it should be turned once every day. Boil it gently for 4 hours, and serve it hot, with savoys or any kind of greens; or leave it to get cold, and press it with'a heavy weight. If served up hot, add a wineglassful of port wine, a table- spoonful of mushroom catsup, a teaspoonful of shalot-vinegar, and some butter rolled in flour. Place the meat neatly in the dish, and pour the sauce over it. TO HASH BEEF. 91.—If raw, hang the beef till it is quite tender; then cut some thin slices, and put them in a stewpan with just water •enough to cover them, a bunch of sweet-herbs, an onion, and a little pepper and salt; cover the stewpan close, and let them stew till tender; then put in a glass of port wine, and a table- spoonful of eschalot-vinegar. When it is warm, pour the sauce through a hair sieve to clear it from the herbs and vegetables ; then put it back into the saucepan with the hash, and thicken it with butter kneaded in flour, with a little brown sugar. This is an excellent dish, and may be made from the trimmings of large joints of meat. If cold, mince a shalot and an onion ; fry in a little butter ; then add a spoonful of flour, a little gravy, and a spoonful of walnut-liquor or ketchup. When it boils, put in the slices of beef cut thin ; let them get hot through, but not boiled. Sliced potatoes and onions may be added if approved. Observe that it is owing to boiling hashes or minces that they get hard. All sorts of stews, or meat dressed a second time, should be only simmered.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. YITI. 126 BEEF HEAR T. 92. —If the ox be not young, the heart will be strong in flavour, and should be soaked the night before in vinegar and water. Though looked upon as a coarse and rather vulgar dish, it is yet very economical for a large family, and may be dressed in various ways, so as to render it very palatable. To roast.—Soak it overnight, and then wash and clean it very well; take out all the white thick skin, and fill it with stuffing of a savoury description, having a larger proportion of marjoram than usual; make a strong gravy, and serve it up witli currant-jelly sauce. It should not be spitted, but hung from an upright jack; but the better way is to bake it for 4 or 5 hours in a slow oven, and either lard it profusely or baste it frequently with butter. It is a good plan to dress beef-heart in this way a day before roasting or baking a hare, as, when cold and both hashed to- gether, they can scarcely be distinguished from each other. When there is no hare, hash the heart the same way by cutting it in slices, warming it in gravy with a glass of port wine and melted currant-jelly. Its appearance and flavour may be much improved by dividing it in half, covering it with slices of fat bacon, laying the forcemeat over it, rolling it round, and dressing it in either way as above. The other half will make excellent beef a-la-mode. To stew.-—Either take one-half or the whole of the heart, stuffed as above, and put it into the stewpan, not more than covered with beef-gravy and a pint of-red wine, with spice and sugar; or put only beer, spiced and sugared in the same manner, keeping the pan all the time closely covered.

BEEF TONGUE. 94.—If it has been dried and smoked, before it is dressed it should be soaked overnight; but if only pickled, a few hours will be sufficient. Put I it into a pot of cold water, and I set it over a slow fife for an hour or two before it comes to a boil; then put it aside, and keep it simmering for 34 to 4 hours, according to its size : you can ascertain when it is done by probing Tougue Garnished, it with a skewer. Peel it, trim the root, glaze it, and before serving surround the root with a paper frill, and stick a flower or two on the top. Its appearance, and its flavour also, may be improved by rubbing it over, when skinned, with yolk of egg, on which crumbs of bread and finely-minced sweet-herbs may be strewed ; then slightly basting it with butter, and browning it with a salamander. To stew Tongue.—Salt a tongue with saltpetre and common salt for a week, turning it everyday; boil it tender enough to peel ; when done, stew it with a moderately strong gravy ; season with soy, mushroom-ketchup, cayenne pepper, pounded cloves, and salt if necessary. Serve with truffles, morels, and mushrooms stewed in gravy.128 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. YIII. An excellent ivay of preparing Tongues to eat cold.—Season with common salt and saltpetre, brown sugar, a little bay- salt, pepper, cloves, mace, and allspice, in fine powder, for a fortnight; then take away the pickle, put the tongue into a small pan, and lay some butter on it; cover it with brown crust, and bake it slowly till so tender that a straw will go through it; put it into a tin mould, and press it well, laying in as much fat as possible. The thin part of tongues, if hung up to dry, grates like hung beef, and also makes a fine addition to the flavour of omelets. To roast a Beef Tongue.—Take a fine large fresh tongue, scald it, and take off the skin ; cut it off at the root and trim it neatly; stick a few cloves here and there in it, and put it in a cradle-spit; sprinkle it with salt, and baste it well with butter. Serve it with a good sauce in a sauceboat, made as follows :—Put into a stewpan rV pint of port wine, with about half the quantity of well-seasoned gravy; reduce it to one- half ; then stir in a good piece of butter and a tablespoonful of flour; add a squeeze of lemon ; when the butter is melted and the sauce done, place the tongue in a dish, and serve hot with the sauce poured round. In Spain, the sauce is strongly impregnated with saffron. FRESH BEEF TONG UE.—E. R. 95.—Take a green tongue, stick it with cloves, and boil it gently for 3 hours; then brush it over with the yolk of an egg, dredge it well with bread-crumbs, and roast it, basting it well with butter. "When dished, serve it with a little brown gravy flavoured with a glass of wine, and lay slices of currant- jelly round it. A pickled tongue, well washed, may be dressed in the same way, and beef-udders also. A fresh neat’s tongue and udder may be roasted together in the manner thus described ; but when ready to be dished, instead of curraiit-jelly, put \ pint of gravy into a saucepan, with the juice of a'(Seville orange, two lumps of sugar, a glass of claret,' and a piece of butter: toss the whole over the fire, and serve it up with \the tongue and udder, garnishing the dish with slices of lemon. The udder should be stuck with cloves, and both should be continually basted. A la Parisienne.—i-Put it into a large stewpan with theBEEF. Chap.

It must be cooked the day before it is wanted, and will be found an elegant and economical dish, as it will furnish the basis necessary for all the sauces at a dinner-party. Any parings of meat or poultry, ham or bacon bones, may be put with it. Reduce some of the sauce to a glaze; put the tongue into the oven to make it hot, glaze it, put it on a dish, and place a wreath of flowers cut in turnips and carrots at each end. Langue de Bcevf pique.—Having removed the root and gullet of a small neat’s tongue, rub it well with salt; next day hang it to drain, and wipe it. Let it lie in salt 1 day, boil it an hour, blanch and remove the skin; then, having rolled some fresh-cured fat bacon in a seasoning of pepper, salt, cloves, mace, cinnamon, and nutmeg, with parsley, knotted marjoram, chives or chibols, and a little morsel of garlic minced small, lard the tongue all over, except a little space up the middle, where it is to be divided from the root to the tip ; braize and glaze as usual, having, after it is dressed, cut it in two, except at the two extremities, and thus lay it on the dish in the form of a heart. Larded a la Prusse.—Boil the tongue gently for 3 hours, then peel and lard it with bacon; take some of the liquor it was boiled in ; fry a dozen or two of silver onions ; add a glass of wine, a little flour, a lump of sugar, and the juice of half a lemon ; stew the whole together for another hour. OX-TAILS. 96.—Cut the tails in pieces; lay them in a stewpan, with butter and a large onion ; set them over a smart fire to make them brown ; peel and boil a couple of dozen of button onions in about 3 pints of water, for 15 or 20 minutes ; set them by, and pour the liquor, they were boiled in upon the tails, adding sufficient boiling water to cover them; put in 6 ounces of caiTots, and 8 of turnips, cut into slices, or balls the size of nutmegs; put in the carrots 20 minutes before the turnips. Be careful that they are not stewed too fast or too much. When they are tender, pass the gravy through a sieve; skim off the fat, and pay great attention in doing so, as the fat rises KMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VIII. 130 while the tails are stewing.

Lay the tails round the dish, and the vegetables in the middle ; pour the gravy over; minced gherkins or capers may be added. Pour boiling water over the onions to warm them, and put them round the dish the last thing. Or :—Divide them at the joints, blanch, and parboil them ; put them into a stewpan with just water, or weak broth, enough to cover them ; let them simmer over a gentle fire, and remove the scum carefully as it rises; then put in an onion, a blade of mace, and a little pepper and salt; put them on again to simmer, and when sufficiently done add a spoonful of essence of anchovy and some flour rolled in butter. This is an excellent and nourishing dish. TRIPE. 97.—Tripe may be dressed in several ways, but, whatever mode may be employed, it will always be found an improve- ment to soak it for a whole night in milk. Indeed, if left in the milk until that gets sour, the acidity thus imparted to it will render it still better. To boil Tripe.—Put it into hot milk and water, an equal quantity of each ; milk may be entirely omitted, or that used in which it may have been soaked; let it boil until quite tender. Boil several large onions in 2 waters, so as to dimi- nish their flavour ; or if Spanish onions can be got, they should be preferred. When quite tender, slice the onions into small flakes, but leave them in that state, and do not mash them into smooth sauce; put the onions into a casserole with milk and butter, so as to make a delicate white sauce, and season it only with a little salt, or a slight grating of nutmeg; then put the tripe, hot from the pot, into a deep dish, and smother it entirely with the sauce. It is usually eaten with pepper and mustard, at the discretion of the guests. Oyster-sauce is some- times used, and much approved. To roast Tripe.—Cut the tripe in square pieces; make a rich forcemeat, spread it over the pieces of tripe, and roll131 BEEF. Chap. Yin.] them up tightly ; fasten them upon a spit, flour and baste them well, and serve them up with melted butter and slices of Seville orange or lemon. To fry.—Dip it into batter of flour and eggs, and fry it of a good brown. Serve with onions fried. To steiv.—Simmer it in beef or veal gravy ; thicken it with butter rolled in a very little flour, and add a spoonful of mushroom-ketchup. Or boil it tender in milk, and serve with white sauce. Tripe and Tornata-Sauce.—Select some double tripe ; boil it until tender; let it cool; cut in small pieces; dip them in egg and bread-crumbs; fry them a light brown; serve with tomata-sauce. CO W-HEELS. 98.— Ox-feet, or Cow-heels, are not highly esteemed, but they contain much nutriment, and may be dressed in the various ways already stated for tripe, with which they are com- monly boiled. They are frequently eaten cold, with mustard 1 and vinegar. Soak them well; boil, and serve in a napkin, with thick melted butter, a large spoonful of vinegar, and a little mustard and salt. Or boil, and then stew them in a brown gravy. Or cut the heel in four parts, dip each in egg, flour, and fry them in butter. Or fry, and serve with onions fried and put romid them : sauce as above. The water in which they are boiled will make equally good jellies, either relishing or sweet, with that of calves’ feet, if duly prepared; and at a far less expense. This jelly gives great additional richness likewise to soups and gravies. To fry Ox-feet, or Cow-heel.—After preparing them as « above, cut them into small pieces; have ready some bread finely crumbled, dip the pieces into the yolk of an egg beaten up, and roll them in the bread-crumbs mixed with chopped parsley, pepper, and salt; fry them in butter or fresh lard, of jj a fine brown colour. To pot Ox-feet, or Cow-heel.—Boil them in fresh water till the bones can be easily removed ; cut them into small pieces, add a little of the liquor, just enough to moisten it, and mix with it a spoonful of vinegar, some pepper and salt, and a little k 2132 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY.

MA RROW-RO NES. 99.—If too long to serve undivided, saw them in two; cover the open end with a lump of paste and a cloth floured and tied close; the paste must be removed before sent to table. Boil 1^- or 2 hours according to the size; put a ruffle of paper round each, and serve in a napkin, with very hot toast. The marrow is spread upon the toast, and seasoned with pepper and salt. BCEUF A-LA-MODE.—E. R. 100.—The name of this dish is rather against it, suggesting ideas connected with London eating-houses; but it would be very erroneous to suppose that the old family receipts now given bear any resemblance to the degenerate successors of those cooks who formerly established a reputation for this savoury compound. Cut out the bone from the beef; then stuff the orifice with rich force-meat, made with veal and oysters, and the crumb of a roll steeped in milk. Half roast it, and before it is put into the stewpan insert in the top dried and pickled mushrooms, adding mushroom-powder in the orifices ; then put in 2 quarts of gravy made from the bones and trimmings, a large onion stuck with cloves, and 2 carrots cut in slices. When the beef has stewed till it is quite tender, strain and thicken the sauce; add to it a glass of wine, mushrooms and oysters, and sippets of fried paste; either the mushrooms or oysters may be omitted, if the pure flavour should be more de- sirable : warm a few pickles with the garnish and send it up very hot. Another.—Take a part of the rump of beef, or 2 of the ribs, boned and rolled, stick it with some whole allspice, whole pep- per and cloves, and cover it well with vinegar. Let it remain in pickle for 10 days, and then put the whole into a stewpan with 2 or 3 bay-leaves; stew the beef for several hours until it is tender; then strain the gravy, and add that of 2 calves’- feet or ox-tail boiled down to a jelly, and nicely seasoned. This receipt will oidy suit persons who are fond of acid flavour : it is best eaten cold. The Bath Receipt.—Take 3 lbs. of the rump, or any part133 Chap. VIII.] BEEF. of the beef which will stew well; trim it nicely, and cut off all the fat. Chop all sorts of sweet herbs together very finely, with a little shalot and a great deal of spice, and put them into a saucer that has been rubbed with garlic, and cover them with vinegar. Cut fat bacon into long slips, dip it into the herbs and vinegar, and let the herbs be very thick upon the bacon ; lard the beef regularly on both sides, if necessary, in order that it should be thoroughly flavoured. Rub the beef over with the remainder of the herbs and spice. Flour the meat, add a piece of butter, the size of a walnut, rolled in flour, and a pint of water. Bake the beef in an oven, strain the gravy, which will scarcely require either thickening or browning, and serve it up with pickles on the top. It is most excellent when cold, but should be served up hot at first. The gravy may be boiled to a glaze if necessary. It will require a good deal of spice, a teaspoonful of cayenne pepper, one of white pepper, a salt- spoonful of allspice, half the quantity of pounded cloves, and a blade of mace pounded. FILLETS OF BEEF. 101. —Cut the inside of a sirloin or rump in slices i an inch thick; trim them neatly; melt a little butter in a saute or frying-pan ; season the fillets; fry them lightly; serve with tomata-sauce, sorrel, anchovy butter, or gherkin-sauce. FILLET OF BEEF BRAISED. m 102. —Take the inside of a sirloin of beef, stuffed or plain, but rolled together so as to bring the fat into the centre. Then strew the bottom of the stewpan with a few slices of ham, in which a small quantity of gravy has been put, just to prevent the bottom of the pan from burning; and on' this place the meat, covering it with chopped carrots, celery, button onions, and a pickled chili, together with a sliced gherkin, sweet herbs, salt, mace, and a little allspice, and simmer until tender, then brown it before the fire or with a salamander, skim and sea- son the sauce, and send the meat, sauce, and vegetables up in the same dish. BEEFSTEAK A LA FRANCATSE 103. —Must be cut either from the sirloin or some other prime part of the beef, as rump steaks are not known in France.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VIII. 134 Pour over it 2 large spoonfuls of the best Lucca oil, and let it remain all night ; then put it and the oil into a frying-pan, with some finely-chopped parsley, pepper, and salt; fry it until the gravy dries up and it becomes rather brown. Pour the contents of the pan over the steak as sauce. The steaks are usually garnished with slices of fried potatoes. As butter is not known in the southern states of Europe, oil is there con- stantly used in lieu of it, and this Parisian practice is borrowed from those countries. BEEF IN A MARINADE. 104. —Cut the inside of a sirloin in slices, put them into a marinade made as follows :—Take equal quantities of vinegar and water, slice some carrots and onions, add some salt and a few pepper-corns with a clove of garlic.. Let all stew together till the goodness be extracted from the vegetables, then strain it, and let it stand till cold. Let the meat lie in this pickle for 24 hours before it is dressed ; then let it stew gently in a little good gravy till quite tender. Add a wineglassful of port wine, a tablespoonful of mushroom-catsup, a teaspoonful of shalot- vinegar, and some butter rolled in flour; place the meat neatly in the dish, and pour the sauce over it. BEEF A LA POLONAISE. 105. —Take a few lbs. of the best beef, without bones, and, after having beaten it for some time with a rolling-pin, make in it deep incisions, but without cutting the meat asunder. Mince some onions, mix them with bread-crumbs, butter, pep- per, and salt; fill the incisions with this forcemeat, and skewer up the meat. Put it with some butter into a stewpan, and stew it upon a moderate fire. It should be served with brown sauce made from the gravy which is drawn from the meat. A la Houssard.—Take any piece of fresh beef, prepared as near as possible in the same manner; but instead of forcemeat, fill the incisions with pledgets of fat ham or bacon : season with pepper, salt, and onion ; lay it in an iron stewpan that has a cover to fit quite close, and set it by the side of the fire with- out water. Take care it does not burn, but it must have a strong heat,; in 2 or 3 hours it will be quite tender, and then serve with its own gravy.BEEF. Chap. VIII.] 135 BEEF OLIVES.—E. B. 106.—Cut some handsome steaks, flatten them well with a roller, dredge them well with a small quantity of white pepper and salt, have some forcemeat made with the fat and lean of veal mixed together, a small bit of lean ham or bacon, parsley, and sweet herbs, with a few bread-crumbs, all beaten in a mortar, and mixed with an egg; lay a little over each steak, and roll them up tightly, fastening with a skewer; dip them in the yolk of an egg, then in crumbs of bread, and fry them of a pale brown ; rolling up each separate steak, and binding it together with thread ; dish them with brown sauce, in which put a glass of white wine, with some strong gravy, seasoned with cayenne. A FRICANDEAU OF BEEF. 107. —Take a nice piece of lean beef; lard it with bacon very closely; put it into a stewpan with a pint of broth, a glass of white wine, a bundle of parsley, all sorts of sweet herbs, a clove of garlic, a shalot or two, 4 cloves, pepper and salt. When the meat is become tender, cover it close; skim the sauce well, and strain it; set it on the fire, and let it boil till it is reduced to a glaze. Glaze the larded side with this, and serve the meat on sorrel-sauce. BEEF RAGOUT.—E. K. 108. —Fry 2 lbs. of the leg-of-mutton piece until quite brown. Put it into a stewpan with 6 large onions, and pepper it well from a spicebox of mixed spice: boil water in a frying-pan, add it to the meat, and let it stew for 4 hours: serve it up with pickled walnuts, gherkins, and capers, just warmed in the gravy. FRICASSEE OF COLD ROAST BEEF. 109. —Cut very thin slices of underdone beef; chop a hand- ful of parsley very small, put it with an onion into a stewpan, with a piece of butter and a spoonful of flour; let it fry ; then add some strong broth season with salt and pepper, and sim- mer very gently £• of an hour; then mix into it the yolk of 2 eggs, a glass of port wine, and a spoonful of vinegar ; stir it quickly over the fire a minute or two ; put in the beef; rub the dish with shalot, and turn the fricassee into it.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. YIII. 136 BEEF A LA VINAIGRETTE. 110. —Cut a slice of underdone beef three inches thick, and a little fat; stew it in £ pint, of water, a glass' of white (not siveet) wine, a bunch of sweet herbs, an onion, and a bay-leaf; season it with 3 cloves pounded and a little pepper; let it stew till the liquor is nearly wasted away, turning it once. When cold, serve it. Strain off the gravy, and mix it with a little vinegar for sauce. TO MINCE BEEF. 111. —Shred the underdone part fine, with some of the fat; put into a small stewpan some onion or shalot (a very little will do), a little water, pepper, and salt; boil it till the onion is quite soft; then put some of the gravy of the meat to it, and the mince. A few minutes will dress it, but do not let it boil. Have a small hot dish with sippets of bread ready, and pour the mince into it, but first mix a large spoonful of vinegar with it. If shalot-vinegar is used, there will be no need of the onion nor the raw shalot. “ Sanders.'’’’—Mince beef or mutton small, with onion, pep- per, and salt; add a little gravy, put it into scallop-shells or saucers, making them three parts full, and fill them up with potatoes mashed with a little cream ; put a bit of butter on the top, and brown them in an oven, or before the fire, or with a salamander. “ Cecils—Mince any kind of meat, crumbs of bread, a good deal of onion, some anchovies, lemon-peel, salt, nutmeg, chopped parsley, pepper, and a bit of butter warm, and mix them over a fire for a few minutes; when cool enough, make them up into balls of the size and shape of a turkey’s egg; dip them in egg, and sprinkle with fine crumbs, then fry them of a yellow brown ; and serve witli gravy as before directed for Beef Olives. Minced Beef with Cucumbers.—Take a fine rump-steak undressed, and with a sharp knife shred it very fine. Put it into a stewpan with a little clarified butter and some salt; stir it over a quick fire for a few minutes, then add ^ pint of good beef gravy ; let it boil gently till it becomes of a proper thickness. Cut 2 fine cucumbers in slices the thickness of a crown-piece, and put them with an onion sliced in a stewpan with some clarified butter, a little vinegar, a lump of sugar, and fry them of a fine brown colour; put them into a stewpan withBEEF. 137 Chap. VIII.] some plain sauce; let it simmer gently till sufficiently done ; then lay the mince in the dish, and pour the cucumbers over it; thicken the sauce with a little flour and butter : add the squeeze of a lemon just before serving. BEEF COLLOPS.—E. R. 112. —Cut the inside of a sirloin, or any other convenient piece, into circular shapes, the size and thickness of a half- crown, flour and fry them ; sprinkle with pepper, salt, chopped parsley, and shalot; make a little gravy in the pan: send to table with gherkin or tomata sauce. Or :—Cut thin slices of beef from the rump, or any other tender part, and divide them into pieces 3 inches long; beat them with the blade of a knife, and flour them. Fry the col- lops quick in butter 2 minutes ; then lay them into a small stew- pan, and cover them with a pint of gravy ; add a bit of butter rubbed in flour. Or:—Take 1 lb. of juicy beef, i lb. of suet, and an onion; remove every bit of skin or gristle from the meat, and mince it with the onion very finely ; add a little pepper and salt, flour the collops, melt a piece of butter in a stewpan, stir in the col- lops, adding a little gravy and a spoonful of ketchup or oyster- sauce : 10 minutes will be sufficient to dress a pound. Or:—Take some lean beef, mince it very small, season it with pepper and salt, adding a very small quantity of vinegar ; press it down in an earthen vessel: it will keep some days. hen wanted, take out the necessary quantity, put it into a stewpan, with a chopped onion, a spoonful of any sauce, some beef gravy, and a piece of butter rolled in flour. Keep stir- ring it round until quite hot; make an edge of chopped vege- tables or mashed potatoes, and put the beef in the middle, and then send it to table. This is the Scotch mode. BEEF PALA TES. 113. —Simmer them in water several hours, till they will peel; then cut the palates into slices, or leave them whole, as you choose, and stew them in a rich gravy till quite tender. Before you serve, season them with cayenne, salt, and ketchup. If the gravy was drawn clear, give it a boil with some butter and flour. If to be served white, boil them in milk, and stew them in fricassee-sauce; adding cream, butter, flour, and mushroom- powder, and a little pounded mace. t138 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VIII. To broil Palates.—Peel them and soak them for some time in sauce made thus: put a piece of butter rolled in flour into a stewpan, with salt, pepper, 2 shalots, a clove, parsley, thyme, and a fennel-leaf, with as much milk as will be necessary to simmer the palates until tender; take them out, dip them in yolk of egg and bread-crumbs, and broil them slowly. Serve them with acid sauce. But if served up with any white sauce, they will be found very delicate when merely seasoned with a little mace and grating of nutmeg. The best way is to boil them in veal-broth. Polled Palates.—Boil 6 palates very gently until they will peel, then trim them ; cut the trimmings into small shreds, and put them, with a little of the water in which they were boiled, a piece of butter rolled in flour, a good seasoning, and a glass of white wine, into a small stewpan, and let them stew gently till the sauce is very good. Brush the outside of the palates with yolk of egg, lay a forcemeat well seasoned over, roll up the palates very tightly, and tie them with a string; put them into a stewpan with a piece of butter and a cup of milk or cream, and let them braise gently for 2 hours. When ready, lay the ragout of trimmings upon a dish, squeeze lemon-juice over it, lay the rolled palates on the top, and garnish with pickles, and eg'g, and forcemeat-balls. To fry Palates.—Parboil them, split them in two, spread upon them some good forcemeat made of pounded meat, and roll them up like an olive ; then dip them in batter made of the yolks of eggs, flour, a spoonful of oil, and a glass of white wine, which must be added a very little at a time: the batter should be a little thicker than very thick cream : fry them of a good colour. Or, cut the palates the size of a crown-piece; after they have beea dressed soak them for an hour in lemon-juice or vinegar pickle ; dip them in the batter, and fry them. Another, and a very good way, is to skewer them at a little distance from each other after having dipped them in yolk of egg and bread-crumbs, and fry them before the fire in the small toasting machine for grillades. Palais dc JBoeuf, en Sauce blanche.—Clean and stew the palates till they can be skinned; then, while hot, throw them into cold water for an hour; having prepared the following sauce, simmer them very slowly in it till perfectly tender. Put into a stewpan 4 oz. of lean veal, the same ol lean bacon,Chap. VIII.] BEEF. 139 the outsides being removed, 2 oz. of fat bacon, the same of butter, the thin rind of half a lemon, and, the white peel being removed, the remainder sliced, a bay-leaf or two, 1 clove, 1 onion, and a carrot sliced thin, with as much water as will just cover them; keep the pan closely stopped, and simmer till the gravy be much reduced, stirring it often ; add some good broth, salt, and white pepper ; skim it, and dress the palates therein. Just before serving mix in the yolk of a new-laid egg over the fire, but the sauce must not boil. A la Mariette.—Boil 3 palates in water for an hour, peel them and cut them in two, lengthways; jmt a slice of pickled pork between each, tie them together, put them into a stewpan with broth or milk and water, and a piece of butter rolled in flour, salt, whole pepper, a faggot of sweet herbs, and a clove ; stew them for some time, then skim and strain the sauce, thicken it, and serve it up very white. BEEF KIDNEY.—E. R. 114.—After taking olf the skin and fat, cut the kidney into slices, season and brown it in the frying-pan; then put it into water boiled in the pan, which must be floured, and let it stew gently for some time. It will be very rich and tender, but cannot be considered a delicacy, and should be well peppered, as well as eaten with mustard and garlic, or shalot vinegar. . To mince a rate Beef Kidney.—Chop some parsley and a little shalot, mix it with the meat, seasoning it with pepper and salt, dredge a little flour over it, and put it into a stewpan with some butter; let it steAv until tender, then add a tea- cupful of rich gravy and a glass of wine. Or, after it has been dressed, Avith a small quantity of bacon or other fat, chop a little thyme with a bunch of parsley, pepper, and salt; mix it all together, with a little thin melted butter; lay it upon toast, stew bread-crumbs over the top, and brown them in a Dutch oven. To make Rissoles of Kidney.—Cut the cold kidney into small dice, with a third part of bacon, and 1 or 2 hard-boiled eggs, according to the quantity, also cut into dice ; season it well, bind it together with yolk of egg beaten up in a little melted butter, dip them in butter, or roll them in bread-crumbs, and fry them.140 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. IS. CHAPTER IX. MUTTON. The most approved joints of mutton are the haunch and saddle. The saddle is generally looked upon as preferable, though the haunch is the most substantial. HA UNCH OF MUTTON ROASTED. 115.—It wall require to be kept for some time, and must therefore be well washed with vinegar, wiped every day, and, if necessary, rubbed with pounded pepper and ginger. Stick some cloves in the knuckle, and, 24 hours before it is put upon the spit, having thoroughly dried and wiped it clean, lay it in a pan, and pour as much port wine over it as will serve to soak it, turning it frequently, so that every part shall equally imbibe the wine. Cut off the knuckle rather close to the joint of the leg; nick the cramp-bone, and that will allow the cushion or thick part of the leg to draw up and be more plump; trim off the thick skin at the flank, and round off the corner of the fat, so as to make the joint appear neat. Cover the fat with oiled paper, which should be taken off \ hour before you think it will be done; then dredge the meat very lightly with flour, and sprinkle it freely with salt; serve it up with currant jelly, and a sauce of port wine, spice, and gravy; a piece of fringed paper being tied neatly around the shank-bone. To roast a haunch of 14 or 16 lbs. will take from 3 to 3^ hours; or even a little more if the weather be very cold, or if required to be “ very well done.” To make it taste like Venison.—Let the haunch hang nearly the usual time; then take the skin carefully off. and rub the meat with olive-oil, then put it into a pan with a quantity of whole pepper, 4 cloves of garlic, a bundle of sweet herbs, consisting of parsley, thyme, sweet marjoram, and 2 bay-MUTTON. 141 Chap. IX.] leaves. Pour upon the meat a pint of good vinegar and 3 or 4 tablespoonfuls of olive-oil. Cover the upper surface of the meat with slices of raw onion, and turn the mutton every day, always taking care to put the slices of onion on the top surface. At the expiration of 4 days, take the meat out, wipe it with a napkin, and hang it up in a cool place till the next day, when it is fit for roasting. A more simple method is to rub it every day, and let it hang until it is tender. A clove or two of garlic in the knuckle will, however, give it a much higher flavour, if put into the knuckle when the haunch is hung up. SADDLE OF MUTTON—E. li. 116.—Is formed of the 2 loins, and is also called “ the chine.” This joint should be well hung and well roasted ; but requires rather less time hanging than the haunch. Rub the part close round the tail with salt, after first cutting out the kernel Wipe it, as well as all other meats, daily, but do not take them into a warm kitchen to do it. Take out the fat from the inside, and also the kidneys: some cooks split the tail, and skewer the pieces back in a ring on either side; but it'is an unnecessary and rather vulgar practice. Sprinkle the mutton with salt, dredge it with flour, and send it up finely frothed. Stewed lentils oi haiicot beans are frequently served round this joint. If the joint be frequently sponged, or well wetted a few times .with port wine, and then hung up in the air to dry it will be found an admirable improvement, as well as to the haunch • both should, however, be kept until quite tender The saddle should be well basted while roasting • it will take 2 or 2$ hours, according to the size. SADDLE OF MUTTON A LA POR TUGAISE. „ 11117—An excellent way to use up port-wine bottoms is the following: Take 2 quarts of port-wine bottoms or lees a pint of vinegar, and a pint of stock; shred 6 or 8 shalots, 3 onions 2 carrots, and 6 turnips, a spoonful of allspice, a dozen cloves' and as many bay-leaves. Make this boiling hot, and pour it oyer a saddle of mutton, having first cut off the tail close trimmed off the superfluous fat from the top, and also the flaps’ Turn it every morning and evening for 4 or 5 days Spit it and cover it with a buttered paper, and roast for 2 or 3 hoursMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. IX. 142 according to its size. It will require longer than usual to roast, and will be quite black, but the flavour will be delicious. When nearly done, remove the paper. Strain a little of the liquor for sauce, adding some gravy and currant jelly to it. SHOULDER OF MUTTON—E. R. 118. —May be dressed in various ways, but the most usual is to roast it nicely, and send it up with onion sauce. It is an unsightly joint, and therefore rarely brought to genteel tables ; but the appearance may be improved by cutting otf the knuckle, when it may be called a shield; and, as to flavour, it has more different sorts of meat in the various cuts than the leg. The bone may also be taken out, and the mutton stuffed; but in that case the grill of the blade-bone will be sacrificed, which, when broiled, is an admirable adjunct to the breakfast- table. A small shoulder cut into a good shape, boned and stuffed, is very good baked. It is frequently served upon a Yorkshire pudding. Salted and boiled.—Bone it; if large take 4 oz. of common salt, the same quantity of coarse sugar, mixed with a dessert- spoonful of pounded cloves, half that quantity of pepper, a little pounded mace and ginger; rub them well into the mutton, turning it every day for a week; then roll it up tight, and boil it gently for 3 or 4 hours in a quart of water, with a carrot, turnip, onion, and a bunch of sweet herbs. Serve it with some of its own gravy, thickened and highly flavoured, or with any piquant sauce ; or served up smothered with onions. This is very convenient to families who kill their own mutton. Members of the Yacht Club, or captains of ships are recom- mended, when they have fresh mutton, to tow it overboard for some hours, and then lay it up in the shrouds. It will then be coated with briny particles, which will effectually keep in all the juices. BREAST OF MUTTON. 119. —The brisket changes first in the breast: and if it is to be kept, it is best to rub it with a little salt, should the weather be hot. Cut off the superfluous fat, joint it well, and roast, and serve it with stewed cucumbers ; or to eat cold sprinkle it well with chopped parsley while roasting.Chap. IX.] 143 MUTTON. Or:—Bone it, take off a good deal of the fat, and cover it with bread, herbs, and seasoning ; then roll and boil till tender : serve with tomata-sauce or sorrel. Or:—Stew it with all the usual kinds of vegetables and a little curry powder; or bone and roll it. Or:—Cut off the fat, and half boil it; take out the bones, and beat the breast flat: season it with pepper and salt; brush it over with the yolk of an egg, and strew over it minced parsley and green onions, mixed with crumbs ol bread; baste it well with fresh butter, and broil it in a Dutch oven. Serve with stewed cucumber or sauce Robert. LEG OF MUTTON ROASTED.—E. R. 120.—A leg of mutton intended for roasting should be kept longer than for boiling; it should be carefully attended to during the time it is hung up, constantly wiped to prevent any mustiness gathering on the top and below the flap, and in hot weather lightly dusted with flour or pepper to keep oil' the flies. The kernel in the fat on the thick part of the leg should be taken out by the butcher, for it taints first there; and the bloody part of the neck should also be cut off when first brought in. If the weather should be cold, hang the mutton for 3 weeks. Should the weather not admit of its hanging so long, put it into a pan, and cover it with coarse brown sugar, turning it every day ; and when to be roasted, remove the skin, and wrap it up in oiled paper. This process will cause it to be veiy tender and juicy. Remove the thick skin very carefully ; trim off the piece of flank that adheres to the fat, and flatten the fat with a cutlet-beater or chopper; cut off the knuckle, and nick the cramp-bone, to allow it to become more plump, as in the haunch. Put a little salt and water into the dripping-pan to baste the meat at first; but then use only its own gravy. Serve with jelly. A leg of mutton is usually roasted whole, but can be divided advantageously for a small family. Cut the knuckle into a good-sized joint, and boil it until tender; but put a coarse paste over the lower part of the thick end to keep in the gravy, and roast it: or if the skin be raised gently from the outside of the leg, to about 6 or 7 inches wide, 2 or 3 good slices may be cut off' for steaks, and the skin then fastened down with skewers.144 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. IX. LEG OF MUTTON BOILED. 121.—Let the joint be kept until it is tender, but not so long as for roasting, as mutton for boiling will not look of a good colour if it has hung long. To prepare a leg of mutton for boiling, trim it as for roasting ; soak it for a couple of hours in cold water; then put only water enough to cover it, and let it boil gently for 3 hours if of the largest size, and, if smaller, according to its weight. Some cooks boil it in a cloth; but if the water be afterwards wanted for soup, that should not be done, as it would be no longer fit for that purpose: some salt and an onion put into it is far better. When nearly ready, take it from the fire, and, keeping the pot well covered, let it remain in the steam for 10 or 15 minutes. The English taste being in favour of meat in which the gravy has been retained, this joint is esteemed to be in perfec- tion when a little underdone. It is sent to table with caper- sauce and mashed turnips. To stuff a Leg of Mutton.—Take a leg of mutton, cut off all the fat, take the bone carefully out and preserve the skin whole; take out the meat and mince it fine, and mix and mince with it about 1 lb. of fat bacon and some parsley; season the whole well with pepper and salt, and a small quantity of eschalot or chives chopped fine; then put the meat into the skin and sew it up neatly on the under side; tie it up in a cloth and put it into a stewpan with 2 or 3 slices of veal, some sliced carrots and onions, a bunch of parsley, and a few slices of fat bacon ; let it stew for 3 or 4 hours, and drain the liquor through a fine sieve; when reduced to a glaze, glaze the mutton with it and serve in stewed French beans. To dress a Leg of Mutton with Ogsters.—Parboil some fine well-fed oysters, take off the beards and horny parts; put to them some parsley, minced onion, and sweet herbs, boiled and chbpped fine, and the yolks of 2 or 3 hard-boiled eggs. Mix all together, and cut 5 or 6 holes in the fleshy part of a leg of mutton, and put in the mixture; and dress it in either of the following ways :—Tie it up in a cloth and let it boil gently 24 or 3 hours, according to the size. Or:—Bruise it, and serve with a pungent brown sauce.MUTTON. Chap. IX.] 145 NECK OF MUTTON 122.—Is particularly useful, as many dishes may be made of it. The best end of the neck may be boiled for 1]- hour, and served with turnips; or roasted; dressed in steaks; in pies; a-la- Turc ; or en haricot. The scrag may be stewed into broth; or with a small quan- tity of water, some small onions, a few peppercorns, and a little rice, and served together. When a neck is to be boiled to look particularly nice, saw down the chine-bone, strip the ribs half-way down, chop otf the ends of the bones about 4 inches, and turn the flap under. The skin should not be taken off' till boiled, and then tire fat will remain white. The neck is very commonly divided, tire “ scrag” being boiled for broth, and the remaining part either roasted or cut into chops; but, if boiled together, the scrag will require rather more stewing than the other part to make it tender. If only slightly salted, for 2 or 3 days, the fat will be so much improved as to become firm and appear clarified; and the mode which we recommend for dressing the I joint is thus :— Boil the neck very gently until it is nearly done enough; then, }■ an hour or 20 minutes before serving, cover it thickly I with bread-crumbs and sweet herbs chopped, with a little j drawn butter or the yolk of an egg, and put it into a Dutch i oven before the fire. By this process the meat will taste much 1 better than if merely roasted or boiled; the dryness attendant < upon roasting will be removed, and the disagreeable greasiness I] which boiled meat—mutton especially—exhibits, will utterly | disappear. Too much cannot be said in favour of this method ;i of dressing the neck and breast of mutton, for the liquor they N have been boiled in, if stewed with peas, will make a very H good soup. LOIN OF MUTTON ROASTED. 123.—-Take off the skin and some of the fat; joint it, and B skewer it from the flap into the fillet; then put the spit through h the chump, and the skewer at the thin end will secure the joint i hi its place ; roast for 1 { hour. For a small family the loin should be divided, and the chump end, if boiled, will make fine broth ; and the ribs may / be either plainly roasted, or dressed precisely as above. The h flesh is, however, richer than that of the neck, and many prefer L146 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. IK. the latter as being more delicate ; chops or Cotelets cle Mouton are, in Paris, always taken from the neck. To stew a Loin of Mutton.—Bone a loin of well-hung mutton ; take oft' the skin, and remove the fat from the inside ; put it into a stewpan, with broth enough to cover it, and let it stew gently till it becomes of a good brown colour; add a glass of port wine, a large spoonful of mushroom ketchup, and some vegetables cut in shapes, or stewed haricot beans. MUTTON-CHOPS 124. —Should be taken from the loin, from 4 to f inch thick. They should not be put on the gridiron until everything else is ready to be served ; have a clear cinder fire to broil them; if the fat falling from them should cause a blaze, remove the gridiron for a moment, and strew a handful of salt over the fire ; they should be kept continually turned ; the greater part of the chine-bones should be chopped off; cut off a good deal of the fat, but do not pepper or flour the chops; and serve them immediately they are done, one at a time. HARICO T OF MUTTON.—E. R. 125. —Cut a neck or loin of mutton into thin chops; flour and fry them brown in a small quantity of butter; drain them on a sieve, then put them into a stewpan, and cover them with gravy ; add a carrot, 2 leeks, a faggot of parsley and thyme, 2 or 3 blades of mace, some allspice, a whole onion, and 2 tur- nips ; stew them until the meat is tender; then take out the chops, strain the gravy, and skim off all the fat; put a little butter mixed with flour into the stewpan ; stir it until melted and made quite smooth, adding the gravy by degrees, stirring all the time; then put in the chops, with some carrots and turnips ready blanched and cut into pretty shapes, with a dozen silver onions whole, and also half boiled; season slightly with pepper and salt, a very little soy, and a teaspoonful of Tarragon vinegar; stew the whole gently for 1 of an hour, and serve them while quite hot. Another.—Cut from the neck 8 or 10 cutlets, leaving the bones short, and taking off some of the fat; fry them in 2 oz. of butter till of a light brown; add a tablespoonful of flour, mix it well, and put in a quart of water; cut 2 dozenChap.

Put £ oz. of pounded sugar into a stewpan; when melted, add 2 oz. of butter and the vegetables, which keep tossing over the fire till covered with a kind of glaze; put them into the stewpan with the cut- lets ; let them simmer till the vegetables are done, skim well, place the cutlets in a crown on the dish, put the vegetables in the centre, and pour the gravy over them. A SCOTCH HAGGIS.—E. R. 126. —Take the stomach of a sheep ; wash it with cold water until perfectly clean ; then turn it inside out, scald it, scrape it with a knife quickly, and then put it into cold salt and water till wanted. Take the liver, lights, and heart, and par- boil them; grate the liver, and mince the other parts quite fine; mince also £ lb. of suet, 3 or 4 onions, toast £ lb. of round oatmeal-cakes before the fire, and pound them into powder, which is to be thickly sprinkled over the mince; mix all well together; season with pepper and salt; then fill the bag, and before sewing it up put in a large teacupful of any kind of strong broth or gravy. Put the bag, neatly sewed up, in a pan with enough of boiling water to cover it, and a small plate under it; prick over with a needle to prevent it bursting, and let it boil 4 or 5 hours, keeping the haggis constantly | covered with boiling water. The English mode is-—To mince the heart, the tongue, the kidneys, and a part of the liver of the sheep, with a third of its weight in fat bacon, 2 anchovies chopped small, and the crumb of a penny-roll grated, a saltspoonful of grated lemon- peel, pepper, salt, 2 eggs beaten, and a glass of wine; mix all well together; butter a mould ; put in the mixture, and let it boil for 2 hours: or it may be boiled in a veal caul. TO STEW MUTTON. 127. —Cut some slices rather thick out of any part of mut- ton ; put them into a stewpan with some pepper and salt, an onion or two, a sliced carrot, and a little eschalot; cover the steaks with broth, and let them stew from 20 minutes to £ an 8< hour, but not longer, or they will become hard; cover the I stewpan close, and When the steaks are about half-done turn L 2MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. IX, 148 them. Before serving, add a little butter rolled in flour, and a spoonful or two of mushroom-catsup. Or:—Cut some slices from an underdone leg of mutton, and put them into a saucepan to simmer with pint of good gravy, a teaspoonful of white sugar pounded, a small quantity of onion minced, a teacupful of port wine, some pepper and salt, and 2 or 3 cloves. This dish should not be allowed to simmer more than 5 or 6 minutes. AN IRISH STEW. 128. —Cut rather thick chops from the loin; when the square ends of the bones are cut off, half a dozen wall probably weigh a couple of pounds; lay them in an iron pot, and put double the quantity of sliced potatoes, placed in layers, with the chops, and half a dozen small onions, with about a quart of water; cover the pan closely, and let them stew on a mode- rate fire for 2 hours, or until the potatoes have become nearly a mash, and absorbed all the water and gravy of the meat; the chops will then be found very tender, and the potatoes rich with the fat. The stew should be eaten hot, but without any kind of sauce. TO HASH MUTTON. 129. —Cut very thin slices from any joint of mutton that has been roasted. Take some onions, slice them, and put them with a piece of butter into a stewpan; fry them; then add 2 large spoonfuls of good gravy, ancl let them stew for about 10 minutes; then put the meat into the sauce, with a spoonful of walnut-ketchup, a little browning, and lemon-pickle. Let it boil for 3 or 4 minutes; shake it over the fire, season it with salt and cayenne pepper, and serve it quite hot, without thickening the sauce. Garnish with red cabbage. If the meat has been boiled, cut the slices rather thick, and use broth sufficient to make rather more sauce than for the roast; take mushroom instead of walnut ketchup; season with salt, white pepper, mace, and chopped parsley; add a few capers or a minced gherkin, and serve with sippets of bread fried in butter. A glass of wine may be employed, very cautiously, so as only to impart a slight flavour: port for the roast, and white wine for the boiled.149 Chap. IX.] MUTTON. TO STEW AND ROAST MUTTON IN DIFFERENT WA YS. 130.—For the Loin.—Keep it till it is tender, bone it, and lay upon it a seasoning of pepper, mace, and a clove pounded. Beat the meat, cover it with a stuffing as for hare, and tie it >| round with string. It will take 21 hours to roast, if it be large. Make gravy of the bones and a little ham or bacon, and clear it well from the fat; add a little port wine, and serve np the mutton with currant-jelly. Or:—Skin, bone, and roll it; put to it a pint of water, a piece of butter, 3 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, an onion, and a bunch of sweet-herbs; let it stew gently for 3 hours, strain the gravy, and add to it a glass of port wine; serve it up with I venison-sauce. For Breast of Mutton.-—Bone it; take bread-crumbs and parsley chopped fine, grated lemon-peel, ground mace, cloves, nutmeg, and salt; mix them together, egg the mutton, then shake the crumbs over it, and roll it up very tight and bind it witl\twine. Baste it with butter until it is wasted, and put a rich brown sauce under it in the dish ; serve it with wine-sauce. Shoulder of Mutton may be rolled and treated in the same j manner, taking care not to injure the skin. It may also be either stewed, roasted, or baked. To steiv Shoulder of Mutton.—Cut off the joint of the knuckle, take out the blade-bone, and trim the shoulder into a hand- some form; break the bone, and stew it for some time in water with the knuckle and trimmings; stuff the shoulder with good forcemeat, draw it into a round shape by severing the under part, put a little butter into a stewpan, melt it, and brown the mutton by turning it in the frying butter ; then dredge it with flour, put some of the broth made with the bones into the stewpan, with an onion, and let it stew- until the meat is quite tender. Serve it up with pickles warmed in the sauce. Or with Oysters.-—Hang it some days, then salt it well for 2 days; bone it, and sprinkle it with pepper and a bit of mace pounded ; lay some oysters over it, and roll the meat up tight and tie it; stew it in a small quantity of water, with an onion and a few peppercorns, till quite tender. Have ready a little good gravy, and some oysters stewed150 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. IX. in it; thicken this with flour and butter, and pour over the mutton when the tape is taken off. The stewpan should be kept closely covered. LEG OF MUTTON BRAISED.—E. R. 131. —Take a very small leg of mutton, cut off1 the knuckle, and trim it nicely; half roast it; then put it into a stewpan with the knuckle-bone broken, the trimmings, a few slices of fat bacon or 2 oz. of butter, an onion stuck with cloves, and a bundle of sweet herbs. Shake the stewpan over the fire until there is gravy enough from the meat and the trimmings to stew the mutton, and take care to turn it in the braise. When very tender, take it up, remove the fat from the gravy, strain it, and boil it quickly until it is reduced to a glaze; pour it over the mutton, and serve it up with a puree of vegetables beneath. MUTTON KEBOBBED. 132. —Take all the fat out of a loin of mutton, and that on the outside also if very fat, and remove the skin ; cut it into steaks ; mix a small nutmeg grated with a little salt and pepper, crumbs, and herbs; dip the steaks into the yolks of 3 eggs, and sprinkle the above mixture all over them; then place the steaks together as they were before they were cut asunder, tie them, and fasten them on a small spit; roast them at a quick fire; set a dish under, and baste them with a good piece of butter and the liquor that comes from the meat, but throw some more of the above seasoning over. When done enough, take it up, and lay it in a dish; have ^ pint of good gravy ready besides that in the dish, and put into it 2 spoonfuls of ketchup, and rub down a teaspoonful of flour with it; give this a boil, and pour it over the mutton, but first skim off the fat. Mind, to keep the meat hot, till the gravy is quite ready. En hochepot.—Cut a neck or loin of mutton into chops, and pare off the fat; put them into a jar with a lettuce cut into quarters, 2 or 3 turnips and carrots, 2 cucumbers quartered, 4 or 5 onions, and pepper and salt; cover the jar closely, and plunge it into a kettle of boiling water; allow it to boil 4 hours, keeping the kettle well supplied, taking care that the water does not come over the top of the jar; take it out of theChap. IX.] MUTTON. 151 jar, and serve it very hot. Green peas or any other vegetables may be added. Au d’Almoyse is Turkish. Take 1 lb. of the tender part of a loin of mutton, chop the lean and the fat together very small. Boil 2 oz. of rice very tender, mix it with the meat while warm, then season the whole with the juice of half an onion, a small quantity of pepper and salt, and the yolk and 1 white of an egg; make the mixture into balls. Take sufficient quantity of vine-leaves, boil them till they are quite tender, and wrap up the balls in them. Put the balls into a small quantity of mutton-broth, stew them IT hour over a slow fire, then take them out of the stewpan, and thicken the gravy with j the yolk of an egg and a little cream; season with pepper and salt, squeeze the juice of a lemon over the balls, and serve them up with the sauce over them, which will be white. For a Mutton Pilau.—Take T lb. of the neck of mutton ; boil it well; boil also 2 cups of rice, the same as for curry. Cut the boiled mutton into small pieces, and fry it in butter; then add it and the rice with the butter, a few cloves, a little cinnamon, and some cardamoms ; let the whole simmer for T an hour. In dishing it, put a little rice at the bottom of the dish, the meat in the centre; cover it over with the remainder of the rice, and scatter the spice on the top. A CAMP DISH. 133. —1Take any joint of mutton, put it into a pot with a good many onions cut small, and as many vegetables as can be obtained to add to it; 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 5 of port wine; season it with black and red pepper; add a spoon- ful of flour, and, if at hand, 4 dessertspoonfuls of Harvey’s sauce and essence of anchovies. Cover the meat with water, and let it stew 1^ hour ; it should be stirred frequently to pre- vent it from burning, as there should be only water sufficient to cook it. Should there be a steam-apparatus do not add the water. This is an excellent dish in camp, and it also suits a family where there are many persons to be fed from one joint. A fowl may be added to or substituted for the mutton. CHINA CHIIOE. 134. —Mince a pint basin of undressed neck of mutton, or152 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. IX. leg, and some of the fat; put 2 onions, a lettuce, a pint of green peas, a teaspoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of pepper, 4 spoonfuls of water, and 2 or 3 oz. of clarified butter, into a stewpan closely covered; simmer 2 hours, and serve in the middle of a dish of boiled dry rice. If cayenne is approved, add a little. This cannot be done too slowly. MINCED MUTTON.—E. R. 135. —Mince dressed meat very finely, season it, make a very good gravy, warm the meat up in it, and serve with fried bread round the dish, or with poached eggs. Or:—Mince cold leg of mutton freed from the skin and fat, warm it with stewed cucumbers, taking care that it does not burn after the meat is put in. Au Gratin, or as Scallops.—Mince dressed mutton with a very little fat, season lightly with pepper and salt, and put into scallop-shells about half full. Then put potatoes mashed with a little milk, and a very small bit of butter; smooth with a spoon, and brown in a Dutch oven. As Rissoles.—Enclose the minced meat in a paste or brown- ing of egg and crumbs of bread, but season it as if for force- meat. MUTTON CUTLETS.—E. R. 136. —Cut the best end of a neck of mutton into cutlets an inch thick, and chop each bone short; flatten and trim them, scraping the end of the bone quite clean; brush them with egg,' and cover them with crumbs, herbs, and seasoning; and serve them either with sauce tomate or any other piquant sauce. If in the Hindostanee fashion, cut the chops from the neck, pare away all the fat, and scrape the bone; then have some very fine mashed potatoes ; wrap the cutlets in it; brush them over with yolk of egg, and fry them. They may also be fried in the same manner, dipped in batter. With Potato Puree.—The cutlets should be dipped in cla- rified butter, then in crumbs, afterwards in yolk of egg, and again in crumbs; flatten them with a knife, and fry hi hot fat as you would fish. The potatoes are to be boiled, rubbed through a hair-sieve, and worked up fine and light with a little butter and boiling cream; season with pepper, salt, and an153 MUTTON. Chap. IX.] atom of nutmeg; dish the cutlets round this puree, which must be softer than mashed potatoes. An excellent dish for luncheon. For Cotclettes de Mouton en Ragout.—Take off all the fat from the cutlets, dredge the meat with Hour, and put them into a stewpan with the fat melted, a bundle of sweet herbs, and 2 shalots minced ; let them brown, then strain the gravy, add a glass of wine, and 1 of Reading sauce; thicken, if ne- cessary, with a little roux, and let the whole stew until very tender. To dress Cotclettes de Mouton a la Polonaise.—Remove all the fat, put the meat into a covered stewpan, with a carrot and a turnip sliced, 2 until the meat is perfectly done, then take it out, strain the gravy, put it over a brisk fire, and reduce it to a glaze; then cover the cutlets with the glaze, and serve them up with toinata-sauce, or a vegetable puree of any kind. For Cotelettes a la Mainlenon.—Cut and trim cutlets from a neck or loin of mutton ; chop very finely a quantity of parsley, a little thyme, and a shalot; put them with butter into a stewpan, and fry the chops a little; then take out the chops; allow them to cool; add to the herbs some fresh parsley chopped and a few crumbs of bread, and seasoning; spread this over the cutlets with a knife, wrap them in but- tered paper, and broil them over a slow fire. Serve a sauce piquant in a boat. Or:—Cut them handsomely from the loin or back end of the neck; half fry them, and then cover them with herbs, crumbs of bread, and seasoning; lay this on very thickly and put them into a stewpan with a little gravy; stew until tender, then wrap them in writing-paper, and finish them on the gridiron. onions, a bundle of sweet herbs, a little pepper and salt, and enough broth to moisten the whole; let it stew very gently ) Mutton Cutlets.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. IX. 154 Cotelettes aux Haricots verts.—Having dressed French beans as usual, drain the water from them, and simmer them with pepper and salt in a good piece of butter. A few minutes before serving add the beaten yolk of an egg, and shake the pan over the fire ; but they must not boil. In the mean time have ready 3 mutton-cutlets, neatly trimmed, seasoned with pepper, salt, and a few crumbs, and nicely fried; and serve them on the French beans. Scrags of Mutton a la Sainte Menehould.—Order the nar- row part of a neck of small mutton to be cut off before the sheep be divided; which leaves the two scrags united. Soak in warm water, then hang it 2 days; lay it in a stewpot, with slices of fat bacon over and under, 2 lbs. of scrag of veal, 3 large carrots, 3 onions, a large bunch of sweet herbs, 2 bay- leaves, and a tablespoonful of whole white pepper; cover the whole with beef-broth, and simmer 4 hours. Drain the gravy from the meat, which cover on all sides with crumbs of bread mixed with pepper and salt, and brown it with a salamander. In the mean time boil the gravy, uncovered, very quickly, having strained it first, and serve in the dish: add salt. Serve in the dish endive, tomata-sauce, or stewed spinach. MUTTON KIDNEYS.—E. R. 137.—Split, pepper, and broil them, broiling the cut side first, which will make a cup for the gravy when the outer part is turned to the fire. Chop some parsley very fine, mix it well with a little fresh butter, the juice of a lemon, pepper and salt, and put a little on each. A sheep’s heart may be split open, and broiled in the same way. With a very sharp knife cut mutton kidneys in the thinnest possible slices ; flour, and fry quickly till they are quite crisp. While frying, add pepper and salt. Serve them in a good gravy, to which a bit of garlic has given a very slight flavour. Hognons, au Vin de Champagne.—Slice or mince them, and fry them with a little chopped parsley and eschalot until they become of a light brown, seasoning them with pepper and salt; then dust them with flour, moisten them with a little strong gravy and a glass of Champagne, and let them stew for a few moments.MUTTON. Chap. IX.] 155 SHEEP’S TAILS AND KIDNEYS.—E. R. 138. —Cut the tails, boil them for 15 minutes, then put them into a stewpan with -i- pint of gravy, an onion stuck with cloves, a little salt, and cayenne pepper. Stew till tender, strain the gravy, thicken it with flour and butter, and add the juice of -5- a lemon. Boil until the whole is very smooth, broil half a dozen kidneys, and place them in the middle of a dish with the tails and sauce round. These are the most tasty modes, but kidneys, when meant for breakfast, are usually broiled upon the gridiron, without parsley or lemon ; being only split open, well peppered, and a bit of butter put upon them when broiled. They must not be much done, and may be brought to the table in less than 10 minutes. If not quite hot, they are not worth eating. MUTTON RUMPS AND KIDNEYS. 139. —Stew 6 rumps in some good mutton-gravy \ an hour; then take them up, and let them stand to cool. Clear the gravy from the fat; and put into it 4 oz. of boiled rice, an onion stuck with cloves, and a blade of mace ; boil them till the rice is thick. Wash the rumps with yolks of eggs well beaten ; and strew over them crumbs of bread, a little pepper and salt, chopped parsley and thyme, and grated lemon-peel. Fiy in butter of a fine brown. While the rumps are stewing lard the kidneys, and put them to roast in a Dutch oven. hen the rumps are fried, the grease must be drained before they are put on the dish, and, the pan being cleared likewise irom the fat, warm the rice in it. Lay the latter on the dish ; the rumps put round on the rice, the narrow ends towards the middle, and the kidneys between. Garnish with hard eggs cut in half, the white being left on; or with different coloured pickles. SHEEP’S HEADS, HEARTS, TAILS, AND TONGUES.-E. R. 140. —A great variety of excellent dishes may be made from a sheep's head, which in India, where veal is not so easily procurable, answers all the purposes for mock turtle, rolled head, rich hash, or ragout: the bones make excellent jelly, either savoury or sweet, Parboil the head ; cut the meat from the bone; stew the former in a little of the liquor until quite tender; send it to table with a glass of wine in the sauceMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. IX. 156 forcemeat-balls and brain-cakes for garnish; or roll up the pieces seasoned in the inside with a thick covering of chopped herbs well seasoned; brush the outside with yolk of egg ; dredge it with bread-crumbs ; fry it; and send to table with a rich gravy made of the bones ancl pickles warmed up in it. Take a sheep's heart and stuff it throughout, using a consi- derable quantity of chopped bacon in the stuffing; half boil it, and when cooled a little rub it over with pepper and salt, and wrap it in paste in the shape of a cone. Rub the paste over with the yolk of an egg, and strew vermicelli loosely over it. Set it with the broad end downwards and bake it in the oven. When baked, send it to table with gravy sauce. Sheep's Tails and Tongues.—Take 3 tails and 3 tongues, cut the tails in half and split the tongues. Stew them gently for 3 hours in as much water as will cover them, adding 3 spoonfuls of vinegar, 3 onions, a teaspoonful of mixed spices, and 1 of salt: these ingredients to be put in after the pot has been skimmed. When the tails, &c., are very tender, take them out, score them, dip them in drawn butter, roll them in grated bread-crumbs, and let them lie for a few minutes, then put on more butter with a knife, and additional bread-crumbs, which latter should be slightly seasoned; brown them before the fire. Strain the gravy, enrich it with butter, squeeze lemon- juice over the tongues and tails, and serve them in the gravy. SHEEP’S TROTTERS.—E. R. 141.—Boil the trotters, or rather stew them gently, for several hours, until the bones will come out. The liquor they are boiled in will make excellent stock or jelly. Take out the bones without injury to the skin, stuff them with a fine force- meat ; stew them for an hour in some of the stock, which must be well flavoured with onion, seasoning, and Eft-little sauce; take out the trotters, strain the sauce, reduce it to a glaze, and brush it over the feet. Serve with any stewed vegetable. Or:—Prepare them in the same way, and dip them in a batter and fry them. The paste, or batter, for frying, is best made thus: mix 4 spoonfuls of flour with 1 of olive-oil, and a sufficient quantity of beer to make it of the proper thickness; then add the whites of 2 eggs well beaten and a little salt. Serve with tomata-sauce. Or:—Simply boil them, and eat them cold with oil and vinegar.LAMB. 157 Chap. X.] CHAPTER X. LAMB. Lamb is of two qualities—“ house-lamb ” and “ grass-lamb the former coming into season, as a great delicacy, just before Christmas, and the latter not until Easter. Both are, however, dressed in the same manner—chiefly plain, boiled and roasted, only that house-lamb, being the greater nicety, is more fre- quently boiled, more particularly the leg, and accompanied with white sauce. Though fat, yet, if well chosen, it will not weigh more than about 3 or 3+ lbs. BOILED LEG OF LAMB 142. —Should look as white as possible. Choose a ewe leg, as there is more fat on it; saw off the knuckle, trim off the flap and the thick skin on the back of it, soak it in warm water for 3 hours, then boil it gently (time according to size) ; pour a little white sauce over it. The loin may be fried in steaks and served round, garnished with dried or fried parsley : spinach or sea-kale to be eaten with it. Or it may be served with parsley and butter, or witli oyster-sauce. It will not take more than about 1 hour, if the joint be taken from the house-lamb ; but grass-lamb will require t an hour longer. QUARTERS OF LAMB ROASTED. 143. —Fore Quarter.—Cut off the scrag 1 joint from the shoulder; saw off the chine-bone, and also the bone of the breast, and joint it thoroughly ; crack the ribs in the middle ; cut off the thick skin which covers the lower part of the breast, and break the bone of the shoulder to allow of the knuckle twisting round, and secure it in its place with a skewer from beneath the breast right up the knuckle. Put 2 large skewers at the thin end ; pass the spit between the skewers and the ribs, through the thick part at the shoulder; paper it, having aMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. X. 158 double thickness over the thin end. When the quarter is roasted whole, the shoulder should be raised either at table or when dished ; a slice of fresh butter laid upon the meat, a little cayenne pepper, and the juice of a lemon. {See Carving.) The hind quarter is sometimes roasted, and served with mint-sauce. It may also be larded, covered with oiled paper, and when more than half done the paper to be withdrawn, the meat basted with oil or yolk of egg, and slightly covered with crumbs of bread; then put closer to the fire to give it a fine brown ; when served, it is sprinkled with the juice of a lemon. If roasted whole, the quarter, of 8 to 10 lbs. weight, will take 2\ to 2^ hours in dressing, as it ought to be always well done. The fore quarter will require from ^ to 1 hour less. TO BONE A QUARTER OF LAMB. 144.-—Take the fore quarter, remove the shoulder and take out the bone ; stuff it with fine forcemeat, and skewer it in a hand- some shape. Braise it with 2 oz. of butter, add a teacupful of water, stirring the braise until the gravy is drawn. Then cut the brisket into pieces, and stew them in white gravy ; thicken it with cream and eggs so that it shall be very white ; cut the long bones into chops and fry them; thicken the gravy of the braise, add to it haricots, minced truffles, or anything else of vegetable in season. Place the shoulder hi the centre of a dish with its own sauce, lay the brisket covered with white sauce round it, and place the fried chops at the edge. Lamb a V Espagnole.—An entire lamb is frequently roasted in the Peninsula, without any other preparation than merely skinning it, taking out the fry, and cutting off the feet. It is then, however, extremely young—not more than perhaps 6 weeks or 2 months old ; the bones eat like gristle, and the meat is singularly delicate. It is sometimes, but only rarely, stuffed with bread and sweet herbs, and served with bread-sauce; but more frequently eaten with lemon-juice. Au Pascal.—May be a little older, and is also roasted whole, but boned from the neck up to the shoulders, and the legs fixed into the body, which is then covered with slices of bacon, kept on with small skewers, or tied with twine ; all, however, being removed when the meat is nearly done. Both should be placed in a cradle-spit, and will take about 2 hours in roasting.LAMB. 159 Chap. X.] TO STEW LAMB. 145. —A Quarter of Lamb may be stewed a la Perigord, by putting it into a casserole with a little oil, parsley, chives, and mushrooms, or half a dozen black truffles, either whole or sliced, together with some trenches of bacon. Let it stew gently in any kind of broth, and when thoroughly done take ft out, strain the gravy, and serve the joint along with the truffles or mushrooms only. To be well done it will require 4 hours in stewing. For a Breast of Lamb.—Cut off the thin ends, half boil, then strew with crumbs of bread, pepper, and salt; and serve in a dish of stewed mushrooms. Cut a Loin of Lamb into steaks, pare off the skin and part of the fat, fry it in butter a pale brown, pour away the fat, and put in boiling water enough to cover the meat, a little pepper and salt, a little nutmeg, ± pint of green peas, and a coss-let- tuce cut lengthways; cover it down, and let it stew gently for 4- an hour. Shoulder of Lamb.—Bone the shoulder, trim off some of the lean meat, which chop fine with an equal quantity of bacon fat, season with spice ; fill up the shoulder and roll it; braise it 2 hours over a slow stove; take it up, glaze it. Serve with sorrel or tomata sauce. LAMB’S HEAD.—E. R. 146. —Parboil the head, rub it over with yolk of eggs, cover it thickly with chopped herbs, crumbs of bread, and clarified butter, and put it into a Dutch oven before the fire. Mince the heart and the liver very finely, and stew them in a little good gravy, adding a spoonful of lemon-pickle; make some forcemeat-balls and brain-cakes, and fry them; place the mince in the dish with the head upon it, and garnish with the balls, brain-cakes, and lemon sliced, or pickles. Lamb's Head and Hinge.—This part is best from a house- lamb ; but any will be white if soaked in cold water and boiled in a napkin. Boil the head separately till very tender. Have ready the liver and lights three parts boiled, and cut small; stew them in a little of the water in which they were boiled, season and thicken with flour and butter, and serve the mince round the head.160 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. X. / Or :■—Skin the head and split it; then wash and clean tho- roughly both it and the entrails—which consist of the “ hinge ” and “ fry,”—and lay the whole in boiling water for a an hour; then take out the heart, liver, and lights; mince them very small; and toss them up with a quart of either veal or mutton broth, a little ketchup, and a spoonful of cream, sea- soned with pepper and salt. When the head is sufficiently boiled, rub it over with yolk of egg, and powder it with crumbs of bread; baste it well with butter, and brown it before the fire. Keep the mince hot; and when all is ready, dish the mince with the head over it, and the brains made into savoury balls as a garnish. A little minced bacon is not a bad addition, and parsley, thyme, and finely-chopped herbs may be used at pleasure: the head may have a squeeze of lemon, and the mince a grating of nutmeg. LAMB'S FRY. 147. —Parboil it; dip it in eggs, then in bread-crumbs, fry it crisp, and serve it dry, with fried parsley, without any sauce. LAMB'S SWEETBREADS. 148. —Blanch them, and put them into cold water. Then put them into a stewpan, with a ladleful of broth, some pepper and salt, a small bunch of button onions, and a blade of mace: stir in a bit of butter and flour, and stew ^ an hour. Have r^ady the yolks of 2 or 3 eggs well beaten in cream, with a little minced parsley and a few grates of nutmeg. Put in some boiled asparagus-tops to the other things. Do not let it boil after the cream is in; but make it hot, and stir it well all the time. Take great care it does not curdle. French beans or peas may be added, but they should be very young. To fricassee Lamb-stones and, Sweetbreads.—Have ready some iamb-stones blanched, parboiled, and sliced. Flour 2 or 3 sweetbreads : if very thick, cut them in two. Fry all toge- ther, with a few large oysters, of a fine yellow brown. Pour the butter off, and add a pint of good gravy, some asparagus- tops about an inch long, a little nutmeg, pepper and salt, 2 shalots or some chives shred fine, and a glass of white wine. Simmer 10 minutes ; then put a little of the gravy to the yolks of 3 eggs well beaten, and by deg'rees mix the whole. I urnChap.

To fricassee Lamb-stones without any addition.—Skin, wash, and parboil, and then cut them in half, dry and flour them ; fry of a beautiful brown in hog’s lard. Serve with the following sauce : thicken some veal gravy with a bit of flour and butter, and then add to it a slice of lemon, a large spoon- ful of mushroom-ketchup, a teaspoonful of lemon-pickle, a grate of nutmeg, and the yolk of an egg beaten well in 2 large spoonfuls of thick cream. Put this over the fire, and stir it well till it is hot and looks white: do not let it boil, or it will curdle. Then put in the fry, and shake it about for a minute or two. Serve in a very hot dish. LAMB-CHOPS.—E. B. 149. —Take a loin of lamb, cut chops from it i an inch thick, retaining the kidney in its place ; dip them into egg and bread-crumbs, fry and serve with fried parsley. When chops are made from a breast of lamb, the red bone at the edge of the breast should be cut off, and the breast par- boiled in water or broth, with a sliced carrot and 2 or 3 onions, before it is divided into cutlets, which is done by cutting be- tween every second or third bone, and preparing them, in every respect, as the last. If house-lamb steaks are to be done white—stew them in milk and water till very tender, with a bit of lemon-peel, a little salt, some pepper and mace. Have ready some veal-gravy, and put the steaks into it; mix some mushroom-powder, a cup of cream, and the least bit of flour; shake the steaks in this liquor, stir it, and let it get quite hot, but not boil. Just before you take it up, put in a few white mushrooms. If brown—season them with pepper, salt, nutmeg, grated lemon-peel, and chopped parsley ; but dip them first into eg<>': fry them quickly. Thicken some gravy with a bit of flour and butter, and add to it a spoonful of port wine. BLANQUETTE D’A ONE A U. 150. — White Fricassee of Land).—Cut the best part of the breast of small lamb into square pieces of 2 inches each: wash dry, and flour them. Having boiled 4 oz. of butter, 1 of flit, bacon, and some parsley, 10 minutes, put the meat to it: add the juice of i a lemon, an onion cut small, pepper and salt. MMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap.

Mince a little of the meat from the inside, with some bacon fat, white pepper, and salt, and lay it on the inner side. With a large needle and coarse thread gather together the circumference of the meat, press it flat, and fasten tire little bone as a handle in its proper place. Then lay at the bottom of a stewpan a large sliced onion, i a lemon without any of the peel, 3 small carrots cut lengthways, and 1 clove; on these lay the lamb; and round it put strips of bacon about the size of your finger; throw in a little parsley, and cover the meat with veal broth. Set the pan on a very slow fire, and place wood embers on the lid. Simmer 2 hours. Keep the meat hot while the gravy is strained, and add to it a little veloute; boil veiy quickly, and throw it over the lamb. Put a ruffle of paper on the knuckle. Or:—It may be served with cucumber sauce, tomata, sorrel, or any other piquant sauce, after it is glazed. FIE JDS D’A GNEA U. 152. —Have 6 lambs’ feet scalded, take out the shank-bone very carefully, so as not to cut or break the skin ; soak for 3 hours in cold water ; put them in a stewpan with cold water and the juice of 2 lemons ; let it boil for 10 minutes, take out the feet, throw them into cold water, cut off the bones of the cleft part of the foot, and remove the curl of hair that lies in I the cleft. Boil very gently for 3 or more hours in some poeUe (which see) to keep them very white. Serve with asparagus, peas, and mushroom or white cucumber sauce.Chap. XT.] VEAL. 163 CHAPTER XI. VEAL. Directions for choosing veal have already been given. To keep it, we have to observe—the first part that turns bad of a leg of veal is where the udder is skewered back. The skewer should be taken out, and both that and the whole of the meat wiped every day; by which means it will keep good 3 or 4 days in hot weather, if the larder be a g'ood one. Take care to cut out the pipe that runs along the chine of a loin, as you do of beef, to hinder it from tainting. The skirt of the breast is likewise to be taken off, and the inside wiped and scraped, and sprinkled with a little salt. If veal is in danger of not keeping, wash it thoroughly, and boil the joint 10 minutes, putting it into the pot when the water is boiling hot; then put it into a very cool larder, or plunge it into cold water till cool, and then wipe and put it by. If in the least tainted, it cannot be recovered, as brown meats are, by the use of charcoal or pyroligneous acid. FILLET OF VEAL ROASTED. 153.—Take out the bone, fill the space with a fine stuffing, and let the fat be skewered quite round; stuff it also well under the skin—as much depends on the quantity and flavour of the stuffing—and send the large side uppermost. Put a paper over the fat; and take care to allow a sufficient time for roasting ; put it a good distance from the fire, as the meat is very solid, and must be so thoroughly done as not to leave the least appear- ance of red gravy ; serve it with melted butter poured over, and gravy round. Ham or bacon should be served witli it, and fresh cucumbers if in season. Although considered very indigestible, it is a favourite joint in England, where it is generally roasted, although it may be m 2MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XI. 164 easily divided into 3 parts and each dressed separately; that piece known in a u round of beef” as the “ silver side” being roasted, and the remaining two stewed in different ways. In Paris, a longe de veau is cut somewhat in the shape of a haunch of mutton, with the fillet and part of the loin joined together. FILLET OF VEAL BOILED. 154. —Choose a small delicate fillet for this purpose; prepare as for roasting, or stuff it with an oyster forcemeat; bind it round with a tape; after having washed it thoroughly, cover it with milk and water in equal quantities, and let it boil very gently 34 or 4 hours, keeping it carefully skimmed. Send it to table with a rich white sauce, or, if stuffed with oysters, a tureen of oyster-sauce ; garnish with stewed celery and slices of bacon. A boiled tongue should be served with it. LOIN OF VEAL ROASTED. 155. —Take a loin of veal; run a lark-spit along the chine- bones ; then tie the ends of the lark-spit on the usual spit, drawing down the flap over the kidney. Cover it well with buttered paper, and tie it up carefully; let it roast gently for 3 hours. When about to serve, remove the paper, sprinkle well with salt, dredge it with flour, and finish basting with a small piece of fresh butter. This joint is frequently divided; the kidney end and the chump. The kidney end sent up with a toast under the fat; the chump end should be stuffed like the fillet, or sent up with balls of stuffing in the dish ; pour melted butter over the joint, and gravy round. It also forms an excellent stew if served up in winter with rice, and in summer .with green peas. BREAST OF VEAL. 156. —Cover it with the caul, and, if you retain the sweet- bread, skewer it to the back, but take off the caul when the meat is nearly done: it will take 24 to 3 hours roasting. Or:—Remove the tendons, and insert in their place a stuffing ; then roast as before. Or:—Raise the skin, and force in as much stuffing as pos- sible ; skewer it up ; this will give a very good flavour to the joint. To stew.—Cut a breast, or a portion, in pieces; fry themChap. XI.] VEAL. 165 with a little butter, an onion, and a cabbage-lettuce shred small; when browned, add a little flour, shake it well together ; then add a small quantity of broth or water; let it stew gently; when nearly done, throw in green peas sufficient for the dish ; when the peas are done, add a little pounded sugar, pepper, and salt. It may require a little more thickening, in which case knead a little flour and butter together. Or:—If any be left, cut the pieces into handsome sizes, put them into a stewpan, and pour some broth or water over them: add a bunch of herbs, a blade or two of mace, some pepper, an onion, and an anchovy; stew till the meat is tender, thicken with butter and flour, and add a little ketchup. The whole breast may be stewed, after cutting off the two ends, or dividing it into pieces, which should be first slightly browned. Serve the sweetbread whole upon it, which may either be stewed or parboiled, and then covered with crumbs, herbs, pepper, and salt, and browned in a Dutch oven; or, if you have a few mushrooms, truffles, and morels, stew them with it, and serve. Boiled breast of veal, smothered with onion sauce, is an ex- cellent dish, if not old nor too fat. BREAST OF VEAL STEWED.—E. R. 157.—Cut a handsome piece, put it into a stewpan with a piece of butter, a pint of water, an onion, a stick of celery, and some white pepper and salt; let it draw gently for some time, then cover it with hot water, and allow it to stew until perfectly ten- der. Remove any skin that may be about it, and thicken a part of the stock with cream, flour, and butter; cover it with the sauce, and serve it up. Mushrooms pickled white may be added to the sauce, or stewed celery. Or:—When the veal is three parts done, take a quart of peas, put them in water, and handle them with a little butter, so that they adhere together; take away nearly all the gravy from the veal, and put in the peas. When both are done add pepper, salt, and a little pounded sugar; thicken the peas with flour and butter, dish up the veal, and pour the peas over. There should be very little sauce with the peas. Or:—Cut the veal into pieces, and half fry it with an onion sliced ; then put it into a stewpan, cover it with water, and add a bunch of sweet herbs. Stew until perfectly tender, strainMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XT. 166 the gravy, thicken it if necessary with brown roux, and serve it up with forcemeat-balls and slices of lemon. Or:—Cut the veal into handsome pieces, put them into a jar with 1 or 2 dozen oysters, and their liquor strained, and a piece of butter rolled in flour; put the jar into a kettle of water, and let it stew until tender. If the veal has been cooked, merely warm it up with the oysters in white sauce. SHOULDER OF VEAL. 158. —Cut off the knuckle for a stew or gravy. Roast the other part with a stuffing; you may lard it. Serve with melted butter. The blade-bone, with a good deal of meat left on, eats ex- tremely well, when grilled, with mushroom or oyster sauce, or mushroom ketchup in butter. Being a large joint of what is considered rather coarse meat, it is rarely served to any but plain family parties; but, if braised, it makes an excellent dish. NECK OF VEAL. 159. —Take the best end of a neck of veal, cut off the ends of the bones, and turn the flap over: saw off the chine-bone, or joint it thoroughly; paper it, and baste it well all the time it is roasting. Larding the fillet or thick part is a great improvement. Or, stew it with rice, small onions, and pepper- corns. Or:—Take the best end of a small neck; cut the bones short, but leave it whole ; then put it into a stewpan just covered with brown gravy; and when it is nearly done, have ready a pint of boiled peas, 3 or 4 cucumbers, and 2 cabbage- lettuces cut into quarters, all stewed in a little good broth; put them to the veal, and let them simmer for 10 minutes. When the veal is in the dish, pour the sauce and vegetables over it, and lay the lettuce round it. This is an excellent summer stew. Neck of Veal a la Braise.—Cut off the ends of the long bones, and saw off the chine-bones; raise the skin of the fillet; lard it very close, and tie it up neatly. Put the scrag end, a little lean bacon or ham, an onion, 2 carrots, 2 heads of celery, and about a glass of Madeira wine into a stewpan. Lay on them the neck, add a little water, and stew it 2 hours, or till it is tender, but not too much. Strain off the liquor; mix aChap. XI.] 167 VEAL. little flour and butter in a stewpan till brown ; stir some of the liquor in, and boil it up ; skim it nicely, and squeeze orange or lemon juice into it, and serve with the meat. The bacon should be browned with a salamander and glazed. It may also be served with spinach or sorrel. KNUCKLE OF VEAL. 160. —As few people like boiled veal, it may be well to leave the knuckle small, by taking off some cutlets, or collops, before it be dressed ; and as the knuckle will keep longer than the fillet, it is best not to cut off the slices till wanted. Soak it 2 hours in cold water, and boil it in a cloth. Serve with plain parsley and butter, or oyster sauce and stewed celery. Or :—Break the bones, to make it take less room ; wash it well, and put it into a saucepan with 3 onions, a blade or two of mace, and a few peppercorns; cover it with water, and simmer it till quite tender. In the mean time either some macaroni should be boiled with it, or idee, or a little rice-flour, to give the gravy a small degree of thickness, but do not put too much. Before it is served, add £ pint of milk and cream. The meat may be served in the soup, or on a separate dish. If the latter, it may be covered with onion sauce. Bacon and greens are usually eaten with boiled veal. Put chopped parsley for garnish. Or:—Fry the knuckle with sliced onions and butter to a good brown; put to it either gravy or water; stew it till the meat is tender; have ready peas, lettuce, onion, and a cucumber or two, stewed; add these to the veal; simmer for ‘i of an hour. Season with pepper and salt, and serve all together. CALF’S HEAD. 161. —Observe: the skin should always be left on calves’ heads, otherwise they are scarcely worth the pains bestowed in dressing them. Clean the head very nicely, and soak it in water, that it may look very white; take out the tongue to salt or stew, and the brains to make a little separate dish. Boil the head ex- tremely tender; then strew it over with crumbs and chopped parsley, and brown it, leaving one half plain. Bacon and greens are usually eaten with it. Serve with parsley and butter. J168 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XI. Or:—When thoroughly cleaned, the brains should be taken out, washed, soaked, and blanched, and boiled; then mix well a little chopped sage, previously scalded and warmed in melted butter; serve in a separate dish with the tongue, the brains being placed in the centre; brush the head with yolk of egg, cover with bread-crumbs, and brown before the fire. In doing this, however, the better mode is, also to score the head at distances of ^ an inch, and to put into each incision some of the crumbs and chopped sweet herbs; and serve with tomata or brown caper sauce. If any of the head is left, it may be hashed next day, and a few slices of bacon just warmed and put round. The remains of calf’s head eat well if grilled. Calf s-head hashed.—When half boiled, cut off the meat in slices i inch thick, and 2 or 3 inches long: brown some butter, flour, and sliced onion, and throw in the slices with some good gravy, and morels or mushrooms; give it one boil and skim it well, and set it in a moderate heat to sim- mer till very tender. Season with pepper, salt, and cayenne at first; and 10 minutes before serving throw in some shred parsley, with a very small bit of tarragon and knotted marjoram cut as fine as possible : add the squeeze of a lemon and a glass of white wine. Garnish with forcemeat-balls and bits of bacon rolled round. To fricassee Calf s-head.—Clean and half boil a head; cut the meat into small bits, and put it into a tosser, with a little gravy made of the bones, some of the water it was boiled in, a bunch of sweet herbs, an onion, and a blade of mace. If you have any young cockerels in the house, use the combs; but first boil them tender and blanch them ; or a sweetbread will do as well, cut in pretty large dice. Season the gravy with a little pepper, nutmeg, and salt, rub down some flour and butter, and give all a boil together; then take out the herbs and onion, and add a little cup of cream, but do not boil it. Serve with small bits of bacon rolled round, and balls. To bake Calf s-head.—Mix pepper, salt, b r e a d - c r u n< 1 chopped sage together; rub the head over with butter and put the seasoning upon it; cut the brains in 4 pieces, and rub them also in the crumbs, and lay the head in a deep dish with the brains; put a piece of butter into each eye, with plenty of the crumbs also, fill the dish nearly full of. water, and let it bake 2 hours in a quick oven.YEAL. Chap. XI.] 169 Calf s-head Ragout.—Parboil the head, and cut off the meat into thin broad pieces, return the bones to the water in which it was boiled, with a beef-bone or a piece of gravy beef, and ham or bacon bones; add herbs, and, making 2 quarts of good gravy, strain it, and put in the meat. When it has stewed f of an hour, add an anchovy, a little beaten mace, cayenne pepper, 2 spoonfuls of lemon-pickle, + oz. of truffles and morels, a slice or two of lemon, and a glass of wine: thicken the gravy with butter and flour, adding forcemeat-balls fried, paste fried, and brain-cakes as a garnish. Rolled Calf ’s-head.—Boil the head gently until the bone will leave the meat easily; take some fine forcemeat, made with ham, egg-balls, and small pieces of very nice pickled pork previously boiled ; lay them evenly over the inside of one half of the head, and roll it up; tie it lightly in a cloth; put it into a stewpan to braise; cut the other portion of the head into small pieces; thicken and flavour the stock in which it was boiled, and warm it up in it, adding forcemeat and egg- balls, brain-cakes, and fried paste. Place the rolled head in the centre of the dish, with the hash round, and the brain- cakes, fried paste, and slices of lemon, as garnish. Truffles may be added with advantage to any dish composed of calfs- head. 162. —Hashed Veal.—If to be hashed, from any joint not overdone cut thin slices, remove the skin and gristle, put some sliced onions and a shalot over the fire with a piece of butter and some flour; fry and shake them. Put in some veal gravy and a bunch of sweet herbs ; simmer 10 minutes ; strain off the gravy, and put it to the veal, with some parsley chopped small, and a little grated lemon-peel and nutmeg; let it simmer 1 minute. If to be stewed, then add the yolks of 2 eggs, beaten up with 2 spoonfuls of cream and a very little pepper, and stir over the fire one way until it becomes thick and sqiooth ; squeeze a httlsjlenion-juice in, and serve. SCOTCH COLL OPS.—E. 11. 163. —If brown, cut the collops thin, beat them a little, fry them in butter for about 2 minutes, after having seasoned them with a little beaten mace ; place them in a deep dish as they are fried, and cover them with gravy. Put some butter intoMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XT. 170 the frying-pan, and allow it just to change colour. Then strain the collops through a colander from the gravy, and fry them quickly ; pour the burnt butter from the pan, and put in the gravy, adding a little lemon-juice. The gravy may be made of the trimmings of the veal: serve it up with forcemeat-balls. If white, cut the collops the size of a crown-piece, and not much thicker; butter the bottom of the stewpan and lay the meat piece by piece upon it, having shaken a little flour upon the butter; add 2 blades of mace and a little nutmeg. Set the stewpan on the fire, and toss it together until the meat is very white; then add i pint of strong veal broth and i pint of cream; toss the whole, and, when simmered enough, let them just boil; add a little lemon-juice, some forcemeat-balls, and either oysters or mushrooms, which must both be very white; if necessary, thicken the sauce with the yolk of eggs, but do not let it boil afterwards. To dress Collops quickly.—Cut them as thin as paper with a very sharp knife, and in small bits. Throw the skin, and any odd bits of the veal, into a little water, with a dust of pepper and salt; set them on the fire while you beat the collops; and dip them into a seasoning of herbs, bread, pepper, salt, and a scrape of nutmeg, but first wet them in egg. Then put a bit of butter into a frying-pan, and give the collops a very quick fry; for as they are so thin, 2 minutes will do them on both sides: put them into a hot dish before the fire ; then strain and thicken the gravy. Or:—Cut the collops thin; flatten them with a beater; have a large dish, dredge it with flour, and sprinkle a little black pepper over it: as the collops are flattened, lay them in the dish ; put a piece of butter in a frying-pan, and, when it is melted and hot, lay in the collops; do them quickly ; when lightly browned, dish them up, and serve with a mushroom sauce. VEAL CUTLETS.—E. It. 164.— Cutlets should be cut from the fillet, but chops are taken from the loin. Some persons have deprecated the prac- tice of beating meat, but it is essentially necessary in veal cutlets, which otherwise, especially if merely fried, are very indigestible. They should be cut about I or, at the most, i an inch in thickness, and well beaten; they will then, when171 VEAL. Chap. XI.] fried, taste like sweetbread, be quite as tender, and nearly as rich. Egg them over, dip in bread-crumbs and savoury herbs, fry, and serve with mushroom sauce and fried bacon. Or:—Prepare as above, and fry them; lay them in a dish, and keep them hot: dredge a little dour, and put a bit of butter into the pan ; brown it, then pour a little boiling water into it, and boil quickly ; season with pepper, salt, and ketchup, and pour it over them. Cutlets and Rice.—Boil a cupful of rice in milk until quite soft, then pound it in a mortar with a little salt and some white pepper; pound also separately equal parts of cold veal or chicken ; mix them together with yolk of egg, form them into cutlets, brush over with yolk of egg, and fry them: send them up with a very piquant sauce, made of good stock, thickened, and davoured with lemon-juice, lemon-pickle, or Harvey’s sauce. The cutlets may be sent to table covered with the small pickled mushrooms. Cutlets and Celery.—The cutlets may be cut from the best part of the neck, taking care in removing the meat from the bones to cut it in a good shape; make gravy of the bones, stewing them with 3 or 4 heads of celery cut and scalded, a a little salt, pepper, and stewed onion; strain the gravy, re- turning the celery into it; thicken it with butter and dour, and pour it boiling hot upon the cutlets. Stew them till they are quite tender, and garnish with lemon and small forcemeat- balls fried. A V Italienne.—Chop a quantity of sweet herbs, parsley being the predominant; melt a little butter on the dre and then warm the herbs in it; cut the cutlets into handsome shapes, brash them with the yolk of an egg, then lay on the butter and herbs with a knife, and cover them well with bread-crumbs; this process should be repeated ; fry them of a dne brown : if glazed, they must be put between papers to press all the grease out, then brush them over with the glaze, and send them to table. Serve with Italian sauce. A la Ilollandaise.-—Cut some large cutlets from a dllet of veal, beat them with a rolling-pin, then dip them into batter made very rich with egg. Make a dne forcemeat with pounded ham, chopped oysters, &c., lay it upon the cutlets, roll them up, dip them again in egg-batter, roll them in bread-crumbs, and tie them up; roast them upon skewers or in a Dutch oven ;172 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XI. chop and pound the trimmings of the veal, add them to the oysters and ham forcemeat with 2 raw eggs, make it into balls and fry them; have some stock ready and stew it with an anchovy, a shalot, some white pepper and salt; strain, and thicken it with butter, add the juice of ^ a lemon and a glass of white wine; give it one boil and pour it into the dish, with the rolled cutlets in the centre and the balls round them. A la Hollandaise, with White Sauce.—Cut thin slices of undressed veal, hack them with the back of a knife each way, dip them in eggs and bread-crumbs, with a little chopped parsley; fry them in butter, lay them on a sieve as they are done, and serve them with white sauce as for fricassee. FARCIES OF VEAL. 165. —Chop off the thick bone of a small neck of veal to the end of the fifth rib; divide the cutlets, and with a broad knife beat the meat of each fiat, and cover it with forcemeat of lean veal, beef suet, parsley, a small bit of garlic, a little salt, mace, and pepper. Then roll the meat round the bone, the end of which leave out at one extremity, put over a thin slice of fat bacon, and, having stuffed in the remainder of the forcemeat at the ends of the roll, bind up with twine. At the bottom of a small stewpan lay slices of turnip, onion, 3 inches of celery, and 2 large carrots cut lengthways, and the steaks over ; add as much water, or beef broth, as shall half cover them ; set the pan on a moderate stove, and some wood embers on the lid ; simmer slowly 2 hours, then remove the twine, and placing the bones upwards, leaning on each other, strain the gravy over them. Or:—Take cutlets from the chump end of a loin of veal; beat them well; cover them with slices of bacon, then with a fine forcemeat; roll them round; tie them into shape; then dip them in the yolks of eggs and the raspings of bread ; roast them, basting well with butter; then put them into a sauce thickened with mushrooms; squeeze lemon-juice over them; let them stew till very tender, and serve them up. ROLLED VEAL.—E.R. 166. —The breast is the best for this purpose. Bone a piece of the breast, and lay a forcemeat over it of herbs, bread, an anchovy, a spoonful or two of scraped ham, a very little mace,VEAL. 173 Chap. XI.] white pepper, and chopped chives ; then roll, bind it up tight, and stew it in water or weak broth with the bones, some carrots, onions, turnips, and a bay-leaf. Let the colour be preserved, and serve it in veal gravy, or fricassee sauce, with mushrooms and artichoke bottoms. Or:—Put the breast into a stewpan with just water enough to cover it, an onion, a stick of celery, and a bundle of sweet herbs; let it stew very gently, adding more water as it stews, until it is tender; then take out the bones, and remove the skin ; return the bones into the liquor, which will be a fine jelly, and serve as the sauce for several dishes. Cover the veal with a fine forcemeat, season it well, add egg-balls, and roll it up, securing it with tape. Put it into a stewpan with the fat pro- cured from pork chops, a slice or two of fat bacon or a lump of butter, and a teacupful of the liquor it was stewed in ; shake the stewpan about until the fat has melted, and turn the veal in it, that it may be all equally done, adding an onion and another bunch of herbs; let it braise or 2 hours, then strain the gravy, and thicken it; garnish with forcemeat-balls, egg-balls, and fried paste cut in shapes. Peeled mushrooms may be given by way of variety. When well done, this is an ex- cellent dish. « TENDONS DE VEAU. 167.—The tendons de veau are the gristle that is found in the breast of veal at the extremity of the bones ; it must be cut out from the meat before cooking. Lay the breast on the table with the bones upwards, and with a sharp knife cut the tendons off the ribs : the place where the tendons begin and the ribs end being shown by a line of white gristle. The breast can then be roasted or stewed, replacing the tendon by a good stuffing. Tendons aux Epinards.—Take the tendons out of the breast of veal, cut them in pieces 6 inches long, envelop them in a sheet of bacon fat, tie them up carefully, braise them with trimmings of veal, an onion, carrot, bay-leaf, 2 or 3 cloves, faggot of parsley, and thyme. Let them simmer gently, until so thoroughly done that a skewer passes through easily. Take them up, put them on a dish with a slight weight on them. When cold, cut them in slices + an inch thick, warm them in a little gravy, glaze them: serve on stewed spinach or sorrel, or with tomata-sauce.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XI. 174 Tendons a la Villeroy.—Cut the tendons in slices; lay them in a marinade of oil, vinegar, lemon, onions, &c., for 3 hours; dry them, dip in batter, fry: serve with tomata-sauce. FRICANDEAU OF VEAL.—E. R. In France the fricandeau is not unfrequently larded in the interior as well as the outside, by having pieces of the size of a little finger cut off the meat with an instrument something like a cheese-taster, and then refilled with pledgets of bacon, or “ lardons.” The meat is also very generally served upon spi- nach, dressed with cream or sorrel. The meat, being cut into a handsome shape, should be larded, and put into a stewpan of small size, with just sufficient water, or veal broth, to cover it, and there allowed to simmer gently over a slow fire for about 3 hours ; or until it has be- come so tender as to be cut with a fish-slice. The gravy is then seasoned at pleasure, but most generally made into white sauce. 168. —Cut a handsome piece from the fillet, lard it all over as thickly as possible ; put it into a stewpan with a few slices of fat bacon, some trimmings of veal, a carrot, turnip, and a head of celery, a few allspice, 2 blades of mace, and 4 bay-leaves; let it stew very gently until thoroughly done, boil the gravy down to a glaze, cover the veal with it, and serve it upon a puree of -sorrel. Grenadines of veal are cooked in the same way, only made of smaller pieces, 4 for a dish. FRICANDELS. 169. —Take 3 lbs. of the best end of a loin of veal, chop the fat and lean together very fine; then soak a French roll in some milk ; beat 3 eggs ; add pepper, salt, nutmeg, and mace. Make the mixture up about the size, and somewhat in the shape, of a chicken ; rub it over with egg and bread-crumbs, fry until it is brown, pour off the fat, boil water in the pan, and stew the fricandels in this gravy : two will make a handsome dish. Thicken the gravy before it is sent to table. MIR O TON OF VEAL. 170. —Chop very fine some cold dressed veal and ham or bacon ; mix it with a slice of crumb of bread soaked in milk, 2 onions chopped and browned, a little salt, pepper, and aVEAL. 175 Chap. XI.] little cream. Put all these ingredients into a stewpan until they are hot, and are well mixed together ; then add 1 or 2 eggs according to the quantity, butter a mould, put in the whole, and bake it in an oven until it is brown; turn out of the mould, and serve with fresh gravy. A GALANTINE.—E. R. 171. —Take out the long bones from a breast of veal, and beat the veal for 4 minutes with the flat part of a hand-chopper, in order that it may roll easily. Spread it on the table, and brush it over thickly with the yolk of an egg, and then sprinkle it with chopped herbs; season with pepper, salt, and pounded mace: make 2 omelettes, one of the yolk and one of the white of egg; cut them in strips; lay them upon the veal, with layers of pounded ham or farce between; cut some pickled cucumbers or mushrooms into small pieces, with some sweet herbs well seasoned; strew them over the surface, then roll up the veal very tightly, tie it in a cloth, and let it stew gently for 6 hours ; then put a heavy weight upon it, and let it stand 2 days before it is cut. Serve it in slices, with savoury jelly : any kind of boned game or fowl may be added. It requires to be highly seasoned. VEAL OLIVES. 172. —Cut long thin slices, beat them, lay them on thin slices of fat bacon, and over these a layer of forcemeat, seasoned I high with some shred shalot and cayenne. Roll them tight, about the size of 2 fingers, but not more than 2 or 3 inches Jong; fasten them round with a small skewer, rub egg over them, and fry them of a light brown. Serve with brown gravy, in which boil some mushrooms, pickled or fresh. Garnish with balls fried. HARICOT OF VEAL. 173.—Take the best end of a small neck ; cut the bones short, but leave it whole ; then put it into a stewpan just covered with brown gravy; and when it is nearly done, have ready a pint of boiled peas, 4 cucumbers pared and sliced, 2 cabbage-lettuces cut into quarters, and t pint of carrots and turnips cut in shapes, all stewed in a little good broth ; put them to the veal, and let them simmer 10 minutes. When the veal is in the dish, pour the sauce and vegetables over it, and lay the lettuce with forcemeat-balls round it.176 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XI. CALVES' FEET. E. R. 174. —Stewed.—When properly cleaned, rub the feet over with pepper, a very little salt, a little ground ginger, and mace; cut the feet into moderately-sized pieces, and put them into a stewpan with a little shalot, and a beefsteak, also cut into pieces. Cover all with cold water, and let them simmer together for 3 hours. When quite tender, take them off the fire; strain the gravy through a sieve. The next day, when cold, take off all the fat; boil a small quantity of saffron in cream, and a little cayenne pepper; mix it with the gravy, and warm the whole without boiling: 1 foot and 1 lb. of steak will make a dish. Fricasseed.—Boil the feet in water until the bones will come out, with an onion and a bunch of sweet herbs ; take the bones out, and when the meat is cold stuff it nicely with a very fine farce, or forcemeat; make the pieces up into hand- some shapes of an equal size ; then take some of the stock in which the feet were boiled, removing the fat, and straining it when melted; make this into thick white sauce with cream and roux; warm up the calves’ feet in it, and send it to table either plain or with a quantity of asparagus tops, previously boiled, and cut into small pieces. Or:—Boil tender 2 feet in a shallow pan, observing not to break them ; throw them into cold water for an hour; divide, and lay them in a little weak veal broth, and simmer them an hour, with a blade of mace and a bit of lemon-peel, which take out when you add i a teacupful of cream, and a bit of flour and butter. Fried.-—Take calves’ feet which have been boiled until very tender, remove the bones, let them get cold, cut them into well-shaped pieces, season them with white pepper and salt, dip them into batter, fry them, and serve them up with a sharp sauce or garnish of pickles. Calves’ feet may also be plainly boiled, and served with parsley and butter, or eaten cold with oil and vinegar.

If you have no mushrooms, mix a little of the powder into the gravy just before serving; have ready small onions, and peel to one size to send up in the dish. CALVES' EARS STUFFED. 176. —The hair being scalded off' the ears, after they have ] been cut quite close to the head, scald and clean them as well 1 as possible ; boil them quite tender, and blanch them in cold | water. Observe that the gristle next the head be cut so smooth as to allow the ears to stand upright; they may be 1 boiled in white gravy instead of water, which will make them richer. When become cold, fill up the cavity with a fine stuffing of calf’s liver, fat bacon, grated ham, bread soaked in cream or gravy, herbs, an unbeaten egg, a little salt, and a small piece of mace; rub egg over the ears and stuffing, dip in bread-crumbs, and fry of a beautiful light brown. Serve in brown or white gravy, or tomata-sauce. If the ear be large, i one will be sufficient for a corner dish. Or:—When prepared as above, boil them quite tender in 4 gravy, and serve them in chervil-sauce; or else boil chervil to a mash, put to it melted butter, pass it through a sieve, I and add to it white sauce, or use the latter solely, in which 3j case put a little mushroom-powder into it; the same force- s meat may be used, or the ears may be served without, i! They likewise eat well, served in white or brown gravy, cut ij into slices. In the latter case, fry them before stewed in 'B gravy. CALVES' BRAINS.—E. R. 177. —Remove all the large fibres and skin; soak them in n warm water for 4 hours; blanch them for 10 minutes in boil- 7 ing water, with a little salt and vinegar in it; then soak them i 3 hours in lemon-juice in which a bit of chervil has been * steeped; dry them well, dip them in batter, and fry them, i*; Make hot a ladleful of glaze, some extremely small onions ri browned in butter, artichoke bottoms divided in half, and some N178 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XT. mushroom-buttons, and serve round the brains; or, after pre- paring as above, serve in a rich white acidulated sauce, with lemon-juice or tomata-sauce. Or:—Blanch the brains, and beat them up with an egg, pepper, and salt, a small quantity of chopped parsley, and a piece 6f butter. Make them into small cakes, put them into a small frying-pan, and fry them. Or:—Prepare them as above ; wet with egg, and sprinkle crumbs, salt, pepper, and chopped parsley, and finish dressing in a Dutch oven. Serve with melted butter, with or without a little mushroom-ketchup. Croquettes of Brains.—Take calf’s brains, blanch, and beat them up with 1 or 2 chopped sage-leaves, a little pepper and salt, a few bread-crumbs soaked in milk, and an egg beaten; roll them into balls, and fry them. Cervelles de Veau au Marinade.—Cut a carrot, a turnip, and an onion into pieces; let them stew in a little butter; then add a bundle of sweet herbs, and pour over them a pint of vinegar and water in equal parts; then strain the liquor, and pour it over calves’ brains cleaned and blanched; let them stew in it till they are firm, then fry them in butter, and serve up with crisped parsley. Cervelles de Veau Fricassees.—Having cleared and blanched the brains, render them white and firm by squeezing lemon- juice over them; then put them into a stewpan with a piece of butter; stew slowly, that they may not brown; dredge hi a small quantity of flour; add a bunch of parsley, and 1 of chives ; moisten with clear veal broth ; let the brains stew until they are firm; then send them up in the sauce, thickened with a little cream and flour and butter. FRIED LIVER AND BACON, ETC.—E. R. 178.—Cut the liver rather thin, say about ^ inch thick, but first soak it in warm water about 1 hour; chop a quantity of pars- ley, season it with pepper, and lay it thick upon the liver; cut slices of bacon, and fry both together, but put the bacon first into the pan; add a little lemon-pickle to the gravy made by pouring the fat out of the pan, flouring, and adding boiling water. Or :—Cut the liver in handsome pieces, lard them very nicely, and chop some parsley and spread it over the surface with aChap. XI.] YEAL. 179 little pepper and salt; put a small piece of butter well mixed with flour in the bottom of a stewpan, put in the liver, and allow it to stew gently in its own juices until it is done enough. To dress Liver and Lights.-—Half boil an equal quantity of each; then cut them into a middling-size mince; put to it a spoonful or two of the water they were boiled in, a bit of butter, flour, salt, and pepper; simmer 10 minutes, and serve hot. To dress Calf’s Heart.—Stuff and roast the same as beef heart; or, being sliced and seasoned, make it into a pudding as directed for steak or kidney pudding. It may be either roasted or baked, but in either way should be well basted, stuffed with forcemeat as for veal, but made rather more savoury, and served up in the same manner as beef heart. When the kidney is cut from the loin and dressed separately, chop the kidney, with some of the fat; likewise a little leek or onion, pepper, and salt. Veal forcemeat may also be used, but it rather weakens the pungency of the seasoning. Roll it up with an egg into balls, and fry them. SWEETBREADS. 179.—For every mode of dressing, sweetbreads should be prepared by blanching, or rather parboiling them. They may be larded and braised ; and, being of themselves rather insipid, they will be improved by a relishing sauce, and by a large quantity of herbs in the braise. Slices of lemon put upon the sweetbreads while braising will heighten the flavour and keep them white, which is very desirable when sent to table with white sauce. Stuffed with oysters, they make a very good vol au vent. Sweetbreads a la Daube.—Blanch 2 or 3 of the largest sweet- breads ; lard them; put them into a stewpan, with some good veal gravy, a little browning, and the juice of i a lemon ; stew them till quite tender, and just before serving thicken with flour and butter; glaze them; serve with their gravy, with bunches of boiled celery round the dish. Sweetbreads stewed.—After blanching, stuff them with a forcemeat of fowl, fat and lean bacon, an anchovy, nutmeg, lemon-peel, parsley, and a very little cayenne and thyme; when well mixed, add the yolks of 2 eggs, and fill the sweet- breads. Fasten them together with splinter-skewers, and lay n 2180 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XI. them in a pan, with slices of veal over, and bacon under them; season with pepper and salt, mace, cloves, herbs, and sliced onion ; cover close over the fire 10 minutes, then add a quart of broth, and stew gently 2 hours; take out the sweetbreads, strain and skim the broth, and boil it to i pint; warm the sweetbreads in it, and serve with lemon round. Fried.—Cut them in slices about £ inch thick, dry and flour, egg them, and dip them in fine bread-crumbs; fry them of a light brown; serve on spinach, endive, or sorrel; or cut some toasted bread, dish them on it, and serve them with a sauce piquante. For an invalid, boil them well, cover them with bread- crumbs, a little pepper and salt, with a small bit of butter; brown them lightly with a salamander. Roasted.—Blanch, dry, egg and bread-crumb them; pass a small skewer through each; tie on a spit; roast gently; baste with fresh butter; serve nicely frothed, and a mushroom- sauce under them. Sweetbreads fricasseed white.—Blanch and slice them ; thicken some veal gravy with flour and butter mixed, a little cream, a little mushroom-powder, and add white pepper, nut- meg, and grated lemon-peel; stew these ingredients together a little, then simmer the sweetbreads 20 minutes. When taken off the fire, add a little salt and lemon-peel; stir well, and serve. If fricasseed brown, cut them about the size of a walnut, flour, and fry them of a fine brown; pour to them a good beef gravy, seasoned with salt, pepper, cayenne, and allspice; simmer till tender; thicken with flour and butter. Morels, truffles, and mushrooms may be added, and mushroom- ketchup. Croquettes.—Take 2 sweetbreads or i lb. of roast veal, 1 onion chopped fine, mixed with a small piece of butter, 1 egg, and a little cream; season with white pepper, cayenne, and salt. This will make 8 or 9 croquettes. Roll them in egg and then in bread-crumbs; fry them in lard a nice brown colour; strew them in a circle round the dish, and serve fried parsley in the centre. Cold veal chopped, and stewed in a little gravy, and when cold made up as above, makes excellent rissoles.Chap. XI.] 181 YEAL. RIS BE VEAU EN CAISSES. 180. -—Blanch 3 sweetbreads, and simmer in a strong, well- flavoured gravy till quite done. Have ready 3 round pieces of white paper oiled, and lay them thereon ; having left them lightly wetted with gravy, sprinkle over them the finest crumbs or raspings of bread, pepper, salt, and a very little nutmeg; do them slowly on a gridiron, and serve in the cases. Any of the vegetable sauces may be served with them. GARNITURE EN RAGOUT. 181. —Having prepared and blanched sweetbreads of veal or lamb (house-lamb is the best), liver of lamb and rabbits, truf- fles and mushrooms, simmer gently 4 an hour in rich veal broth; then divide the several articles into fit bits for help- ing, and stew the whole till very tender. If, when finished, the gravy wants consistence, boil up in it a good piece of butter rolled in flour. Season it 15 minutes before serving, with white pepper, salt, and nutmeg only. Have ready and Ihot, forcemeat-balls, in which finely-scraped ham, beef-suet, the breast of a fowl, or cold veal, are the principal ingredients. It may be served in a tureen as soup, or in an ornamented crust previously baked. If to be white, beat as many yolks of eggs as the quantity may require, and simmer in the ra- gout 2 minutes: it must not boil. Sometimes 1 or 2 whole pigeons, nicely prepared, form a part of this much-admired dish, which in one way or other is rarely omitted on well- covered tables. VEAL CAKE.—E. R. 182.—Bone a breast of veal, and cut it in slices; cut also slices of ham or lean bacon, and boil 6 eggs hard; butter a deep pan, and place the whole in layers one over the other, cutting the eggs in slices, and seasoning with chopped herbs | and cayenne pepper, and wetting the herbs with anchovy or other highly-flavoured sauce. Cover up the whole, let it bake i for 4 hours, and, when taken from the oven, lay a weight upon it to press it well together. When cold, turn it out. Another.—Boil 6 or 8 eggs hard ; cut the yolks in 2, and lay some of the pieces in the bottom of the pan ; shake in a 1 little chopped parsley, some slices of veal and ham, and then eggs again, shaking in after each some chopped parsley, withMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XT. 182 pepper and salt, till the pan is full. Then put in water enough to cover it, and lay on it about an ounce of butter; tie it down with a double paper, and bake it about an hour. Then press it close together with a spoon, and let it stand till cold. It may be put into a small mould, and then it will turn out beautifully for a supper or side dish. Another.—Chop very finely cold dressed veal and ham or bacon; mix it with a slice of bread-crumb soaked in milk, 2 onions chopped and browned, a little salt, pepper, and an egg beaten. Put all these ingredients into a stewpan until they are hot and are well mixed; then oil or butter a mould, put in the whole, and bake it in an oven until it is brown; then take it out, and send it to table with fresh gravy. Veal rolls are cut from any cold joint, or prepared in the same manner from the raw meat. Cut thin slices, and spread on them a fine seasoning of a very few crumbs, a little chopped or scraped bacon, parsley and shalot, some fresh mushrooms stewed and minced, pepper, salt, and a small piece of pounded mace. This stuffing may either fill up the roll like a sausage, or be rolled with the meat. In either case, tie it up very tight, and stew very slowly in a gravy and a glass of sherry. Serve it when tender, after skimming it nicely. BLANQUETTES. 183.—Melt a piece of butter the size of a walnut in a stewpan; then put in a little thyme, parsley, or any herbs you like the flavour of, and a little onion, all chopped fine, with a pinch of flour. Brown the herbs; add pepper and salt, with a clove or two. Then put in cold or undressed veal, cut in thin slices the size of half-a-crown; add gravy or broth T pint, or according to the quantity of meat you want to dress. It should not be too large a dish. Let it stew very gently over a stove; if of dressed meat, 1 hour will be sufficient: add i a teacupful of cream, and stir it well together for a few minutes; then take it up, and before you turn it out have 2 yolks of eggs well beaten, and add to your dish. Give it a few shakes over the fire. It must not boil, or it will curdle. Or, Cut rabbits, fowl, veal, or lobster in pieces, steep them (except the veal and fish) in water for i an hour, changing the water.

Stew it well i of an hour before it is dished; take out the parsley and onion, and add some raw parsley chop- ped, and the yolk of an egg and cream beaten together. You must never cease shaking the pan until the blanquette is put over the dish. Veal a la Chartreuse.-—Line a copper mould with fat bacon, lay sliced carrots and turnips round the edges, then cover with a forcemeat, and put in a fricassee of veal or fowl. Cover the top of the mould with a paste, steam it an hour, and serve it turned out upon a dish. To marble Veal.—Boil tender, skin, and cut a dried neat’s tongue in thin slices, and beat it as fine as possible, with 4 lb. of butter and some mace pounded. Have ready some roasted fillet of veal, beaten with butter, and seasoned with white pepper and salt; of this put a thick layer in a large potting-pot, then put in the tongue, in rough irregular lumps, not to touch each other; fill up the pot with veal, and press it down quite close. Pour clarified butter thick over; keep in a dry cool place, and serve in thin slices, taking off the butter. Garnish with parsley. SCALLOPS OF COLD VEAL. 184. -—Mince the meat extremely small, and set it over the fire, with a scrape of nutmeg, a little pepper and salt, and a little cream, for a few minutes ; then put it into the scallop- shells, and fill them with crumbs of bread, over which put some bits of butter, and brown them before the fire. Either veal or chicken looks and eats well prepared in this way, and lightly covered with crumbs of bread fried ; or these may be put on in little heaps. TO MINCE VEAL. 185. —Cut cold veal as^ne as possible, but do not chop it; put to it a very little lenfon-peel shred, 2 grates of nutmeg, some salt, and 4 or 5 spoonfuls of either broth, milk, or water ; simmer these gently with the meat, but take care not to let it boil, and add a bit of butter rubbed in flour. Put sippets of thin toasted bread, cut into a three-cornered shape, round the dish. Fried crumbs of bread lightly strewed over, or served184 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XI. in little heaps on the meat, are an improvement to the look and flavour. A little shred of shalot may occasionally be added. Or:—Stew a few small mushrooms in their own liquor and a bit of butter i of an hour; mince them very small, and add them (with their liquor) to minced veal, with also a little pepper and salt, some cream, and a bit of butter rubbed in less than 4 a teaspoonful of flour. Simmer 3 or 4 minutes, and serve on thin sippets of bread. The Turkish mode.—Take equal quantities of cold dressed veal, minced very fine, fat, and crumbs of bread, and season it well; add chopped onions, parsley, salt, and cayenne pepper ; wet it with one or two eggs, according to the quantity, adding, if necessary, a little cold melted butter; make the mixture into balls or egg-shapes, and roll them in as much boiled rice as they will take round them. Stew them for 14 hour in good gravy, well seasoned, and serve them up in it. In all these modes, the addition may be made of sauce aux truffes, or any of the approved sauces; and a squeeze of lemon will in all cases be found to give a pleasing zest to their flavour. CURRY OF VEAL. 186.—Cut part of a breast of veal in moderate-sized pieces; put it in a stewpan with an onion and a shalot sliced fine, a slice of lemon, 1 oz. of butter, a little parsley and thyme, and a tablespoonfal of curry-powder mixed with the same quantity of flour; add sufficient broth or water for the sauce; let it boil gently till the veal is done ; strain the sauce through a sieve, pour it over the veal quite hot, and serve with rice in a sepa- rate dish.Chap. XII.] PORK, 185 CHAPTER XII. PORK. Tnis meat requires to be very well roasted, is never boiled unless salted, and in every form should be thoroughly cooked. | It is not the fashion to stuff it, as heretofore, with sage and j onions, the meat frequently disagreeing with delicate persons without the addition of so strong an adjunct, but it forms a i very savoury addition. A part of the objection may be re- | moved by boiling the sage and onions, and mixmg them with bread-crumbs and a chopped apple ; and if thus prepared, the stuffing will be found mild, and of excellent flavour. The griskin and the sparerib are certainly improved by being powdered with chopped sage, but this is all a matter of taste. The skin of the leg and loin must be scored previous to roasting; but take care to preserve the skin, or cradding, of a fine brown, as many persons look upon it to be the best part of the pork: it should therefore be well basted, and guarded from being burned by a sheet of oiled paper. Send both up with a glass of vinegar mixed with 2 teaspoonfuls of made mustard in the dish. Apple-sauce should always be served with roasted pork. If you kill a young pig of 4 or 5 months, take off the skin I of the fore quarter, roast it, ancl serve with mint-sauce and I salad. SUCKING-PIGS. 187.— To scald a Sucking-pig.—The moment the pig is j killed put it into cold water for a few minutes; then rub it I over with a little resin, beaten extremely small, and put it | into a pail of scalding water ^ a minute; take it out. lay it on | a table, and pull off the hair as quickly as possible: if any i part does not come off, put it in again. When quite clean, wasli it well with warm water, and then in 2 or 3 cold waters,MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XII. 186 that no flavour of the resin may remain. Take off the feet at the first joint; make a slit down the belly and take out the entrails: put the liver, heart, and lights to the feet. Wash the pig well in cold water, dry it thoroughly, and fold it in a wet cloth to keep it from the air. To roast a Sucking-pig.—Put some sage, a large piece of white bread, salt, pepper, and an onion, into the belly; then sew it up. Observe to skewer the legs back, or the under part will not crisp. Lay it to a brisk fire till thoroughly dry; then have ready some butter in a dry cloth, and rub the pig with it in every part. Dredge as much flour over it as will possibly lie, and do not touch it again till ready to serve; then scrape off the flour very carefully with a blunt knife or coarse towel, rub the pig well with a buttered cloth, and take oft’ the head while at the fire; take out the brains, and mix them with the gravy that comes from the pig, or make them up into balls with crumbs of bread and egg. Then take it up, and, with- out withdrawing the spit, cut it down the back and belly, lay it into the dish, and throw out the onion : chop the sage and bread quickly as fine as you can, and mix them with a large quantity of fine melted butter with a very little flour. Take off the upper part of the head dowrn to the snout. Put the sauce into the dish after the pig has been split down the back, and garnished with the ears and the 2 jaws. In Devonshire it is served whole, if very small; the head only being cut off to garnish, as above. It will require from 1 hour to H to roast, and an iron “ pig- plate ” should be hung on a bar of the grate to prevent the middle of the pig being done before the other parts are ready. Sucking-pig should never be more than about 3 weeks old ; but sometimes young porkers just weaned from the dam are roasted whole in the following manner :— TO ROAST A PORKER.-E. R. 188.—When prepared for the spit, roll a small lump of butter in flour and chopped sage-leaves, and put it in the in- side ; but put enough, as the body of a young pig should be quite filled with stuffing. When warm at the fire, take the whites of 1 or 2 eggs, beat them well, and, with a small brush or a bunch of feathers, spread it all over the pig. When nearly roasted, catch the gravy that falls; and, when takenPORK. 187 Chap. XII.] from the spit, remove the sage-leaves from the inside ; cut off the head, split it, and take out the brains, cut the pig down the back and into quarters, cut off the ears, and lay them with the head round the dish. Mix with the gravy already caught the brains and the sage-leaves, chopped small, together with a little cream or melted butter heated in a saucepan, and pour it I into the dish. The pig may be sent up with various sauces,—viz. currant- sauce, egg-sauce, gravy, and plumped prunes or raisins. This is an old-fashioned recipe for roasting-pig, but, as it obtained when the dish was a favourite, it has been inserted here. The common method now is, to bake a pig, and send it to the oven rubbed with butter, basting it occasionally with butter while cooking, and having gravy, bread, egg, cranberries, or currant- jelly as an accompaniment. It will take more than 2 hours in roasting; or it may be equally well baked. To roast a Porker s Head.—Choose a fine head, not too s close to the neck; clean it well, remove the eyes and snout, and put bread and sage as for pig; sew it up tight, and on a string, or hanging-jack, roast it as a pig, and serve with the 1 same sauce. LEG OF PORK.-E. R. 189.— To bake.—Rub it well over with salt and saltpetre mixed ; let it lie 5 or 6 days in the brine; then hang it up to [| smoke for 5 or 6 days. Take off the skin, put it into an earthen dish, and pour a little red wine over it; stick a few cloves in it, or beat them to powder, and rub them over it. \Vhen it has been in the oven a short time, take some hard biscuit, pounded with sugar, and spread it all over. Serve it 4 up with gravy, and port-wine sauce. To roast.—Choose a small leg of fine young pork: cut a slit in the knuckle with a sharp knife; and fill the space with sage and onion chopped, and a little pepper and salt. Score the skin in slices, but do not cut deeper than the outer rind. Put it at first a good distance from the fire, but baste it frequently to prevent its scorching: then, when about three parts done, rub the skin rather firmly with raw butter, after which flour it lightly and put close to the fire to crispen the crackling. Apple-sauce should be served with it. To boil.—Salt it 8 or 10 days, turning it daily, but do notMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIT. 188 rub it after the first. When it is to be dressed weigh it: let it lie ^ an hour in cold water to make it white : allow pof an hour for every lb., and 4 an hour over, from the time it boils up : skim it as soon as it boils, and frequently after, but do not boil it fast, or it will be hard. Allow water enough. Save some of the water to make pea-soup. Some boil it in a cloth, floured, which gives a very delicate look, but destroys the value of the liquor for making soup. PORK CUTLETS. 190. —Perhaps few things of a simple nature, and served in a plain way, are better than a hot pork chop, cut about 4 an inch thick, trimmed neatly, and broiled upon the gridiron. Or:—Fry in salad-oil; serve with sauce Robert or gherkin- sauce, the gherkins being shred fine into some good thick brown gravy. Or:—Marinade the cutlets for 4 hours in oil with an onion in slices, parsley, bay-leaf, pepper, and salt; fry them in the marinade ; serve with tomata-sauce. Or:—Melt a small piece of butter in a fryingpan ; put in it 3 bay-leaves, 3 slices of lemon, a little parsley and thyme shred, 4 leaves of sage, a blade of mace, 8 allspice, and a glass of white wine; lay in the cutlets, put a cover over them, let them be about two-thirds done, then take them out, dry them, dip them in egg, then in bread-crumbs, fry them quickly; serve with the sauce that comes from the cutlets, thickened with flour and butter, and a little mustard stirred in. PORK CURRY. 191. —Take pork cutlets, cut rather fat, and proceed as for veal curry. SADDLE OF PORK. 192. —Have a saddle of pork cut as a saddle of mutton ; roast it with the rind on. When sending it to table, remove the crackling, and serve with tomata-sauce. LOIN AND NECK OF PORK 193. —May be roasted and served with the same accompani- ments as a porker. Or :—Simmer the best end of either of the joints till nearly fit for the table, strip off the skin, put it into a cradle-spit, wet189 Chap. XII.] PORK. it all over with yolks of eggs, and cover it thickly with crumbs of bread, sweet herbs and chives chopped fine for stuffing-, and seasoned with pepper and salt. It will get a good brown in about i an hour. Either of them may also be rolled.—Bone it; put a force- meat of chopped sage, a very few crumbs of bread, salt, pep- per, and 2 or 3 berries of allspice, over the inside: then roll the meat as tight as you can, and roast it slowly, and at a good distance at first from the fire. To parboil it before the herbs are put on will be an im- provement. LOIN OF PORK A LA PORTUGAISE. 194. —In Portugal, where the pork is perhaps the finest in Europe, porkers are never killed, but the fat of bacon-hogs is cut off for curing; and the loin, eaten fresh, is there pre- pared by being left for some days to soak in red wine and *j garlic, it being occasionally hung up to dry, then returned to the -wine, afterwards roasted, and served with tomata-sauce. It is a highly-flavoured delicacy, and we offer it as a hint which is worthy of attention. A /’Espagnole—is prepared and dressed in the same manner; but when ready for dressing, sprinkle the meat with sweet herbs chopped, wrap it in bay-leaves, add the juice of two Seville oranges to the wine, which must be strained, and bake it in an oven. PIG'S-FEET A LA ST. MENEHOULD.—E. R. 195. —Clean the feet perfectly, cut them down in two, then bind them with a tape to prevent their shrinking or opening, and boil them gently until they are rather soft, with carrots, onions, parsley, thyme, allspice, and bay-leaf; let them cool in the liquor. When required for use, take off the tape, dip them i in yolks of eggs and butter about three parts melted; season them, then cover them with crumbs of bread and finely-minced j parsley, with the smallest quantity of shalot. Broil them until I highly browned, and serve dry, or with sauce Robert.

[Chap. XII. flour, a spoonful of cream, and a little salt and pepper. Give it a boil up, pour it over a few sippets of bread, and put the feet on the mince. TO FORCE HOG’S EARS. 196.—Parboil 2 pair of ears, or take some that have been soused ; make a foi’cemeat of an anchovy, a little finely-minced veal, some sage, parsley, f lb. of suet chopped, bread-crumbs, pepper, and only a little salt. Mix all these with the yolks of 2 eggs, raise the skin of the upper side of the ears, and stuff them with the above. Fry the ears in fresh butter, of a fine colour; then pour away the fat, and dram them; make ready pint of rich gravy, with a glass of fine sherry, 3 teaspoon- fuls of made mustard, a little bit of flour and butter, a small onion whole, and a little pepper or cayenne. Put these, with the ears, into a stewpan, and cover it close; stew it gently for 1 an hour, shaking the pan often. When done enough, take out the onion, place the ears carefully in a dish, and pour the sauce over them. If a larger dish be wanted, the meat from 2 feet may be taken from the bones, and added to the above. PIGS’ FEET AND EARS. 197.—•Soused.—Clean carefully and soak them some hours, then boil them fender ; having prepared a pickle of some of the liquor that they were boiled in, and a quarter part of vinegar —and salt, boiled, pour it over them cold. When they are to be dressed, dry them, cut the feet in two, slice the ears, and fry them. Serve with butter, mustard, and vinegar, in a boat. They may be dipped in batter, or only floured. Fricasseed.—Take feet and ears that have been boiled, but not kept in pickle wherein was vinegar; boil them tender in milk, cut the feet into neat bits, and the ears into strips of h inch wide: wipe them, and simmer in veal broth, with a bit of onion, mace, and lemon-peel. Before you serve, add a little cream, flour, and butter. Jelly of Pigs' Feet and Ears.'—Clean and prepare, then boil them in a very small quantity of water till every bone can be taken out; throw in half a handful of chopped sage, the same of parsley, and a seasoning of pepper, salt, and mace in fine powder ; simmer till the herbs are scalded, then pour the whole into a melon-form. Serve when cold.191 PORK. Chap. XII.] PORK GRISKIN 198. —Is usually very hard: the best way to prevent this is to put it into as much cold water as will cover it, and let it boil up ; then instantly take it off, and put it into a Dutch oven ; a very few minutes will do it. Remember to rub butter over it, and then flour it, before you put it to the fire. Lay it in a dish on melted butter and mustard. It should be sea- soned with pepper and salt before roasting'. SPARERIB 199. —Should be basted with a very little butter and a little flour, and then sprinkled with dried sage crumbled. BELLY OF PORK. 200.—Lovers of pork are vexy fond of having the belly part of a porker, either fresh or salted, strewed thickly over the in- side with sage, sweet herbs, and minced eschalots ; then rolled, tied tightly together, and either baked or l-oasted. SHOULDERS AND BREASTS OF PORK. 201.—Put them into pickle, or salt the shoulder as a Ixam; cut accordingly. When very nice, they may be roasted. SPRING, OR FOREHAND OF PORK: 202.—Cut out the bone; sprinkle salt, pepper, and sage dried, over the inside ; but first warm a little butter to baste it, and then flour it; roll the poi'k tight, and tie it; then roast by a hanging jack. About 2 hours will do it. CHINE OF PORK. 203.—The chine is more usually salted, and served as an accompaniment to roast turkey. Salt the chine for 3 days, roast it, and serve it up with sauce made thus:—Fiy in oil or butter 2 or 3 sliced onions until they take colour; then pour off the oil, and add some gi’avy-sauce, chopped mushi-ooms, and 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, with 1 teaspoonful of made mustard. Give the whole a boil, and serve it up in the dish. BLADE-BONE OF PORK 204.—Is taken from the bacon-hog: the less meat left on it, in moderation, the better. It is to be broiled ; and when justMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XII. 192 done, pepper and salt it. Put to it a piece of butter and a teaspoonful of mustard; and serve it quickly. This is a Somersetshire dish. FIG’S HARSLET. 205. —Wash and dry some liver, sweetbreads, and fat and lean bits of pork, beating the latter with a rolling-pin to make it tender; season with pepper, salt, sage, and a little onion shred fine; when mixed, put all into a caul, and fasten it up tight with a needle and thread. Roast it on a hanging-jack, or by a string. Or :—Serve in slices, with parsley for a fry ; with a sauce of port wine and water, and mustard, just boiled up, and put into the dish. HOG’S LARD 206. —Should be carefully melted in a jar put into a kettle of water and boiled: run it into bladders that have been ex- tremely well cleaned. The smaller they are the better the lard keeps, as, after the air reaches it, it becomes rank. Put in a sprig of rosemary when melting. This being a most useful article for frying fish, it should be prepared with care. Mixed with butter, it makes fine crust for tarts. HAMS. 207. —Skimmed milk, or milk and water, will be found pre- ferable to plain water for soaking hams ; and they may also be boiled in milk and water. Where vegetables are plentiful, it is desirable to boil ham with 3 heads of celery, a couple of turnips, half a dozen small onions, and a large bunch of sweet marjoram, thyme, &c., put in after the pot has been skimmed. “ These will extract the salt and soften the meat. A piece of coarse fresh beef, or any kind of meat, in addition, will materially improve the ham, as, in this manner of boiling it, the juices of the meat and vege- tables insinuate themselves between the fibres of the ham, after having dislodged the salt, by which means the meat is en- riched and rendered tender. At first sight this will appear an extravagant way of boiling a ham, but it should be considered that the broth will serve the purposes of the family.” a If the " 1 Medical Commentary on Modern Cookery,’ by A. Hunter, M.D. F.R.S. L. and E.PORK. Chap. XII.] 193 meat and vegetables are not approved, 2 lbs. of fresh beef- dripping will answer nearly as well. To boil.—If long hung, soak it for 24 hours in luke-warm water, changing it frequently. Wash and brush it well; trim off any rusty parts ; put it into a boiler of water, and let it simmer from 3? hours to 5 hours, according to its size. It is best to allow time enough, as it is easy to take up the ham when done, and keep it hot over boiling water, covered closely. Take off the skin as whole as you can, as it keeps the cold ham moist when skewered on again after dinner. There can be no doubt that the foregoing is an excellent j mode of boiling a liam, but many people prefer to have it | bahed, in which case send it to the oven in a deep pan with i lb. of suet over it to baste it occasionally; or skin it, cover it with a crust of coarse paste, and, when taken from I the bakehouse, strip off the crust, rub it with yolk of egg, on which put finely powdered crumbs of bread strewed with a dredging-box, in the same manner as when the ham is boiled. In Spain and Portugal, where the hams are generally fine, the method of dressing them is to put the ham in cold water with a large handful of brown sugar, to which some persons 1 add a quantity of the common country wine, and let it simmer j on the fire until parboiled, keeping the pot well skimmed; when taken out, the skin is stripped off, and the ham covered with brown sugar to the thickness of an inch, after which it is sent to the oven and baked until thoroughly done. A ham of 15 lbs. should be allowed nearly 2 hours before the water begins to boil, and as much more for simmering until half done; then from 3 to 4 hours’ baking, according to the heat of the oven, which however should never be allowed f| to be too hot. When cold, twist some neatly fringed letter-paper round I the shank-bone. To roast.—Take a very fine ham (a Westphalia, if you I can procure it), soak it in luke-warm water for a day or two, 8 changing the water frequently. The day before you intend j to cook it, take tin? ham out of the water, and, having re- 41 moved the skin, trim it nicely, and pour over it a bottle of 1 an inferior white wine; let it steep till next morning, fre- quently during the day washing the wine over it; put it in a I cradle-spit in time to allow at least 6 hours for slowly roasting oMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIR 194 it; baste continually with hot water. When it is done, dredge it all over with fine bread-raspings, shaken on through the top of the dredging-box, and set it before the fire to brown. For Gravy.—Take the wine in which the ham was steeped, and add to it the essence or juice which flowed from the meat when taken from the spit; squeeze in the juice of 2 lemons, put it into a saucepan, and boil and skim it; send it to table in a boat. Cover the shank of the ham (which should have been sawed short) with bunches of double parsley, and orna- ment it with any garnish you may think proper. To boil Mutton Ham.—Put it on the fire in cold water, let it warm quickly, and allow it to boil only 20 minutes; then leave it in the pan of water till cold. This plan renders it moist, and answers when it is to be eaten cold.195 Chap. XIII.] POULTRY AND GAME. CHAPTER XIII. POULTRY AND GAME. POULTRY. A very quick and clear fire is necessary for roasting all poultry. A large fowl will take 1 of an hour, a middling one 4 an hour, and a small one 20 minutes. Care must be taken that they are well and thoroughly done. A small turkey will take 11 hour, turkey-poults only 1 hour, a goose 1 hour, larger turkeys and geese 11 hour: both should have the breasts papered. Chickens take t an hour; pigeons 20 minutes, and may be dressed as soon as killed. Ducks and ducklings the same as fowls and chickens, but all must vary in proportion to their difference of size, the temperature of the air, and the state of the fire; and the cook must acquire cor- rectness by experience. The French adopt the following method to make old poultry eat tender:—Let the bird soak in cold water for 24 hours, \yith a handful or two of wood-ashes; pick off the feathers, and let it hang for another 24 hours; truss it, and let it boil for i of an hour in a little veal-broth ; take it out, lard, and roast it; when nearly done, baste it with very hot butter. By observing tl^ese directions, you will impart to an old bird all the delicate flavour of a young chicken. In drawing poultry the cook must be careful not to crack the gall-bladder, for then no washing will remove the bitter- ness. Ignorant cooks sometimes draw fowls by cutting a hole in their side, but it should be done through the vent, and, that being cut off, a string should fasten the rump close to the front part. TURKEY.—E. R. 208.—There is a quaint adage that says,— o 2MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIII. 196 “ Turkey roast is turkey lost; Turkey boiled is turkey spoiled ; But turkey braised is turkey praised.” To roast.—Make a veal stuffing ; fill the breast where the crop is taken from to make the bird look handsome; paper the breast, and roast at a distance from a quick fire. Where truffles are to be had, take about 2 lbs., peel them, select the small ones, and, after chopping, pound them in a mortar with an equal quantity of the fat of bacon rasped; make the stuffing with this, mixed with some of the larger truffles whole, put them into the body of the turkey, and let it hang for several days; then roast it with a piece of fat bacon laid over the breast and a paper over that. Truffles of a good quality are, however, so very expensive, that turkeys fattened in France and stuffed with them have been sold in London at Christmas for 5 guineas each ! Mushrooms are therefore more commonly used, and even chestnuts may be substituted for truffles, pounded and mixed with bacon in the same manner; the chestnuts should be boiled to take off the husk, peeled nicely, and pounded. Chestnuts, put whole into the body of a turkey and hung for some days, improve the flavour; but a turkey thus stuffed will require long and careful roasting, and must be put at first at a distance from the fire. A stuffing of sausage or other meat may be put into the crop besides. Fowls may be dressed in the same way. Turkey with Sausage-meat.—At the messes of European regiments in India, it is no uncommon thing to bone a turkey and a fowl, and put one inside the other, filling the interstices with sausage-meat, a small pig being killed for the purpose. A turkey thus prepared will take a long time roasting, and must be placed at a great distance from the fire at first. When carved the slices should be cut quite through ; and epicures aver that it is one of the finest dishes that come to table. Boiled Turkey.—Fill the body with oysters, and let it boil by steam without any water. When sufficiently done, take it up, strain the gravy that will be found in the pan, and which, when cold, will be a fine jelly ; thicken it with a little Hour and butter, add the liquor of the oysters intended for sauce, also stewed, and warm the oysters up in it; whiten it with a little boiled cream, and pour it over the turkey.197 POULTRY AND GAME. Chap. XIII.] A la Braise.—Take out the breastbone of the turkey; fill it with sausage-meat; lard the breast, braise it, and serve with celery, oyster, or chestnut sauce. Observe:—A small hen-bird boils better than a cock, and the best mode is to roast the cock-turkey and boil the hen. Turkey pulled and grilled is a mode of preparing the remains of cold turkey by mincing the white meat and fricasseeing it with white sauce; the legs being scored, peppered and salted, broiled, and sent up over the mince. Or devilled, as thusOn the rump, gizzard, and a drum- stick, put salt, pepper, and cayenne. Let them be broiled, and brought to table as hot as possible; cut them in small pieces, pour- over them a ladle of mustard, ditto of melted butter, a spoonful of soy, ditto of lemon-juice, and some of the gravy out of the dish; mix quickly and hand round. It forms an admirable relish; fowls may be treated in the same manner. CAPON, OR POULARDE, 209.-—Should be stuffed and roasted, or otherwise dressed, in . precisely the same manner as turkey. They are the male and female of the common fowl, but, when caponed, grow nearly to the size of turkeys, and are very rarely, if ever, boiled. A la Provengale.—Half roast the fowl; cut it in pieces; take a dozen onions, cut them in rings, add a little parsley chopped. Place them in a stewpan, laying a bed of onions and parsley, then fowl, till the whole are used: add a glass of oil or cream with 1 or 2 bay-leaves and salt; let them simmer slowly ; dish the fowl, put the onions in the middle, add a little sauce, and send it to table. FOELEE TO BOIL FOWLS IN. 210.—Take 2 lbs. of veal and 2 lbs. of bacon; cut both into large dice; cut also 2 large carrots and 2 onions into dice; put them, with a pound of butter, into a stewpan, the juice of 4 lemons, a little thyme or sweet fennel, and 2 laurel-leaves bruised ; season it with salt and pepper; put them on a good fire; add a spoonful of boiling broth, and boil it.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIII. 198 FO WLS.—E. R. 211.—Fowlsfor boiling, when trussed and singed, should soak an hour or two in skimmed milk. Flour them well, tie them in a cloth; put them in cold water, and set them over a slow fire ; cover the saucepan close, and let them simmer ; as soon as the scum rises remove it carefully, cover them close up again, and boil them gently 20 minutes; take them off the fire, and the steam, if kept in, will sufficiently finish them. It will much improve the appearance of boiled fowls if they are dressed with a thin piece of puff-paste tied over the breast. Poularde a la Royale.—Bone the fowl, and stuff it with sweetbread, liver, and mushrooms well seasoned and made into a ragout. Sew up the fowl; cover it with thin slices of lard or bacon, and either tie paper over it and roast it, or put it to braise: if roasted, take off the lard and paper before serving, to brown it. Send it up on a puree of chestnuts. A turkey- poult may be dressed the same way. Or:—Hang young fowls a night; take the livers, hearts, and tenderest parts of the gizzards—the last ’ being previously boiled—shred very small, with half a handful of young clary, an anchovy to each fowl, an onion, and the yolks of 4' eggs boiled hard, with pepper, salt, and mace to your taste. Stuff the fowls with this, and sew up the vents and necks quite close, that the water may not get in. Boil them in salt and water till almost done; then drain them, and put them into a stew- pan with butter enough to brown them. Serve with a good deal of melted butter, with either soy or ketchup in it. To roast.—Having cleaned the fowl, put into the inside a piece of butter the size of a hazel-nut or walnut, according as the fowl is large or small; make the butter black with pepper, and sprinkle a little salt upon it. This will greatly improve the taste of the fowl, rendering the whole more juicy, and particularly the back and side bones, which are so apt to be dry. Or:—When nicely clean, and free from every feather and plug, singe the fowl. Bone and draw inwards the leg and pinion of the wing. Stuff with sausage-meat, and tie the neck and vent. Roast, and serve with gravy in the dish, and bread-sauce in a tureen. A large barn-door fowl, well hung, should be stuffed in the crop with sausage-meat; and served with gravy in the dish,POULTRY AND GAME. 199 Chap. XIII.] and with bread-sauce. The head should be turned under the wing, as a turkey. Boiled with Oysters.—Take a young fowl, fill the inside with oysters, put it into a jar, and plunge the jar in a kettle or saucepan of water. Boil it for 1L hour. There will be a quantity of gravy from the juices of the fowl and oysters in the jar; make it into a white sauce, with the addition of egg, cream, or a little flour and butter; add oysters to it, or serve it up plain with the fowl. The gravy that comes from a fowl dressed in this manner will be a stiff jelly the next day ; the fowl will be very white and tender, and of an exceedingly fine flavour—advantages not attainable in ordinary boiling—while the dish loses nothing of its delicacy and simplicity. To braise.—Bone the breast, and fill it with forcemeat. Lay the bones, and any other poultry trimmings, into a stew- pan, and the fowl on them. Put to them a few onions, a faggot of herbs, 3 blades of mace, a pint of stock, and a glass or two of sherry. Cover the fowl with slices of bacon, and then with white paper ; cover the whole close, and put it on a slow stove for 1 hour. Then take it up, strain the braise, and skim off the fat carefully ; set it on to boil very quickly to a glaze, and put it over the fowl with a brush. Serve with a brown fricassee of mushrooms. Before glazing, put the fowl into an oven for a few minutes, to give a little colour. With Rice.—The fowl should be stewed very slowly in some clear veal or mutton broth, well skimmed, and seasoned with pepper, salt, mace, and an onion. About an hour before it. is ready add i pint of rice, well washed and soaked ; simmer until tender, then strain the rice from the broth and lay it on a sieve before the fire to swell; then dish the fowl with the rice round it. White sauce is the most fashionable accompaniment, the old method of dishing with parsley and butter being on the decline: but as parsley still maintains its ground with many people, it is advisable to boil a sufficient quantity; press and chop' it, garnishing the dish with small mounds thus prepared, which may be mixed at table with the white sauce by the guests who like the flavour of parsley. Liver-sauce is sometimes served with boiled fowls, but celery or oyster sauce, either made separate or together, is preferable. > Bowl uux Onions.—Boil 12 small onions in several200 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIII. waters, until the strength is out and they are tender; cut a piece of boiled pickled pork into dice; take a tablespoonful of hot vinegar, some sweet herbs chopped, and the yolk of an egg beaten ; make this quite thick with herbs, mix it with the pork and onions, and then stuff the inside of the fowl with it; braise the fowl in a little broth and butter, and serve with white sauce. Aux Poix.—Put some butter into a stewpan, add flour until it is rather stiff, then put in some small pieces of bacon ; let it brown a little, then cut up the fowl and put it in : moisten the gravy, mix it well, and season with parsley, sorrel, young onions, i a bay-leaf, and a clove, and let it boil. Put in the peas over a quick fire, skim, and when done enough pour the sauce over the fowl. Poulet Blanc.—Choose a good, tender, fat fowl; melt ^ lb. butter in a stewpan, turn the fowl in for a minute or two, mix 2 tablespoonfuls of flour into the butter very smoothly, taking care it does not fry. Put in the fowl, and nearly cover it with a weak veal broth; add small onions, a bunch of sweet herbs, and a few sprigs of parsley, with some fresh mushrooms and a teaspoonful of lemon-juice. Let it simmer IT hour, or, if the fowl is large, 2 hours. Before serving take out the fowl, and keep it hot whilst the gravy is prepared. Strain it, and mix with it the yolk of an egg wrell beaten, stirring it all the time till it thickens, but do not let it boil; pour it over the fowl, and garnish with slices of lemon. Fried.—Cut up a fowl, and put it into an earthen dish with slices of onions, parsley, sorrel, salt, and pepper, and the juice of 2 or 3 lemons; leave it an hour or two to absorb the juice. Put in the legs first, then the breast, wings, &c.; dip the joints in batter, fry them of a fine colour: serve them up with fried eggs, and a sauce piquante. The batter is to be made with eggs and a spoonful of oil. Or:—The remains of a cold fowl may be well employed for this purpose: it will of course not take so much time to dress. Place it round a dish, and fill up the centre with tomata, sorrel, or other sauce, made very hot and very acid. Or, cn Cotelettes.—Cut up a fowl and bone it, make the legs, wings, breast, and merrythought into 6 fine cutlets by flattening them and giving them a good shape; then take thePOULTRY AND GAME. Chap. XIII.] 201 meat from the remainder of the fowl, pound it in a mortal with pepper, salt, and a spoonful of gravy, brush the cutlets with an egg, lay on the forcemeat, dredge fried crumbs on the tops, and fry them a light brown: serve them up with gravy in the dish, or dry, with a lemon squeezed over them. TO BROIL A FOWL.—E. R. 212. —Split the fowl down the back ; season it very well with pepper, and put it on the gridiron with the inner part next the fire, which must be very clear. Hold the gridiron at a con- siderable distance from the fire, and allow the fowl to remain until it is nearly half done; then turn it, taking great care that it does not burn. Broil it of a fine brown, and serve it up with stewed mushrooms or a sauce with pickled mushrooms. A duck may be broiled in the same way. If the fowl is very | large, half-roast it, then cut it into 4 quarters and finish it on the gridiron. FRICASSEE OF FOWL.—E. R. 213. —Put the fowl into a jar, with sliced onion, parsley, salt, and a piece of butter rolled in flour; let it remain in a kettle of water on the fire until three parts done, then skim a and strain the liquor, and after draining w ipe the fowl dry. Put it into a stewpan with a piece of butter and a slice or two of ham, throw in a little flour, and shake it until it is of a good colour. Moisten with the liquor taken out of the jar, adding parsley, young onions, a bay-leaf, a clove, sorrel, and mush- rooms cut into pieces: skim it, and let it stew until done, then take out the herbs, and thicken the sauce with a little cream, but do not let it boil: finish with a little lemon-juice, and pour I the sauce over all. Or:—Rather more than lialf-boil in a small quantity of water: let the fowl cool; then cut up; and put to simmer in a little gravy made of the liquor it is boiled in, and a bit of veal or mutton, onion, mace, and lemon-peel, some white pepper, and a bunch of sweet herbs. When quite tender, keep it hot while you thicken the sauce in the following manner: strain it off, and put it back into the saucepan with a little salt, a scrape of nutmeg, and a bit of flour and butter; give it one boil; and when you are going to serve, beat up the yolk of an egg and t pint of cream, and stir them over the202 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIII. fire, but do not let them boil. The sauce will be quite as good without the egg. Or •' Take off the skin, and pull the flesh off the bone of a cold fowl, in as large pieces as you can: dredge it with flour, and fry it of a nice brown in butter. Drain the butter from it; and then simmer the flesh in a good gravy, well-seasoned, and thickened with a little flour and butter. Add the juice of -3- a lemon. The gravy may be made (without any other meat) of the necks, feet, small wing-bones, gizzards, and livers; which are called the trimmings of the fowls. RISSOLES. 214. —Pick from the bones and skin any kind of cold poultry ; weigh it, and add one-third of grated bread-crumbs, a little cold melted butter, a small onion, previously boiled and finely minced, pepper, salt, and the yolks of 2 eggs to bind it toge- ther. Roll out, thin, some trimmings of puff-paste ; cut it in 2-inch square pieces; put in the middle of each a teaspoonful of the mince, fold the paste over it, and shape it with a cutter. Egg the shapes, dip them in bread-crumbs, and fry them in lard: serve dry, garnish with fried parsley, and take care that the edges be perfectly closed. Or, Pound any kind of cold meat, thicken a little good gravy with cream or butter, season the meat, and mix it -with the sauce, until it is well moistened; then roll out some paste into oval pieces, lay a large tablespoonful of the meat on one end, double it over, press the edges together, and scallop them; brush the paste over with yolk of egg, sprinkle vermicelli upon it, and fry them. P UREE BE VOLAILLE.—E. R. 215. —Mince the white part of a cold fowl or turkey very finely, then pound it in a mortar; put in 2 or 3 spoonfuls of white sauce, and pass it through a sieve, adding a little salt and white pepper, and warm the whole. It may be served up with the legs grilled. It should not be too thin, but can be made the proper consistence by a greater or smaller quantity of white sauce or cream. Garnish with fried bread, or paste cut in shapes. It may also be served up in a casserolle, or wall of rice and mashed potatoes, or with poached eggs.Chap. XIII.] POULTRY AND GAME. 203 Souffle de Puree de Volaille.—Make the puree as above directed, only much thicker, adding 2 oz. of butter; stir it well over the fire, and when warm add the yolks and the whites of 4 or 6 eggs, according to the quantity of meat, well beaten, separately: mix the whole lightly together, then put it into a dish, and let it remain in the oven until it is firm. If put warm into the oven it ■null be ready hour sooner. These dishes may be made of cold fillet of veal. CURRY OF CHICKEN. 216. —Cut up a raw chicken ; put into a stewpan, with 2 oz. of butter, 4 a large onion sliced thin, a few sprigs of parsley and thyme, and 2 oz. of lean ham ; let the whole sweat over the fire for a few minutes; add a heaped tablespoonful of curry-powder, and a small one of flour; shake the whole together for 5 minutes over the fire; put to it a pint of either gravy or water; let the whole go gently until the chicken is done; take out the chicken, rub the sauce through a sieve, boil it up, skim, put in the chicken, season with salt and lemon-juice to palate. Plain boiled rice to be served in a separate dish. I) UMP OKUTI—E. R. 217. —Clean and truss a fowl, or rabbit, as for roasting; then stuff it with sultana raisins, pistachio-nuts, and boiled rice in equal parts. Rub fine 1 oz. of coriander-seed, freed from the husks, 4 onions, a dozen peppercorns, 6 cloves, and a teaspoonful of pounded ginger. Set 12 oz. of butter in a stew- pan over the fire, rub the pounded ingredients over the fowl or rabbit, and let it fiy until perfectly well browned and tender. Have boiled in a quart of white broth 12 oz. of rice, 2 oz. of sultana raisins, 2 oz. of pistachio nuts, and 2 of almonds, the two latter blanched, and cut into thin slices. When the rice is nearly tender, strain off the broth, and add the rice to the fried fowl ; stir the whole well, that the butter may completely saturate the rice, and keep it near the fire to swell till wanted. In serving surround the fowl with the rice. Observe that, in pounding the onions, the juice only is used with the spices, or they must be rubbed and pounded so finely a The dish mentioned in the Arabian Nights as the kid studied with 1 pistachio-nuts.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIII. 204 as not to be perceptible. Chestnuts may be substituted for pistachio-nuts. CHICKENS.—E. R. 218.— To boil, chickens should be plump, and very nicely boiled ; if wanted to be particularly good, they must be boiled in a blanc. It is the fashion to send them up with tufts of cauliflower or white brocoli, divested of stem and leaves, and white sauce. Many people, however, prefer the stem to the flower, and have it sent up separately, sliced, and covered with white sauce. A la Carmelite.—Put a piece of butter the size of a walnut into a stewpan; as it melts dredge in flour, and when the whole is well mixed add a teacupful of milk. Cut up the chickens and put them in, adding peppercorns, an onion, and a blade of mace. Stew them until tender, adding milk and water if too dry. Take out the chickens ; have some parsley ready boiled and chopped; mix it with lemon-juice and a little white pepper; lay it upon the chickens, strain and thicken the sauce, add a glass of white wine, and send it to table garnished with chopped parsley and lemon or pickles. To pull Chickens.—Cut off the legs and the whole back of a dressed chicken; if underdone the better. Pull all the white . part into little flakes free from skin, toss it up with a little cream thickened with a piece of butter mixed with flour, 4 a blade of mace in powder, white pepper, salt, and a squeeze of lemon. Cut off the neck end of the chicken, and broil the back and side bones in one piece, and the two legs seasoned. Put the hash in the middle, with the back on it, and the two legs at the end. Another way.—Take off the skin, and pull the flesh off the bone of a cold fowl in as large pieces as you can; dredge it with flour, and fry it to a nice brown in butter. Drain the butter from it, and then simmer the flesh in a good gravy, well seasoned, and thickened with a little flour and butter. Add the juice of half a lemon. To fricassee Chickens.—After the chickens or fowls have been well cleaned, cut them up very nicely, and put them into cold water. Then put the chickens into a stewpan with a piece of butter, the legs first, as they require more time than the other joints; dredge them very lightly with flour as they stew, and moisten with a little broth ; add whole white pepper,205 Chap. XIII.] POULTRY AND GAME. a faggot of parsley and thyme, and an onion. Let them stew in this way for about 4 an hour; take off the butter and scum ; reduce the sauce made from the bones, and thicken it with cream and the yolk of an egg, and send it to table; a little lemon-juice will be necessary, and a few mushrooms are a great improvement. Another side-dish may be made of the legs boned and filleted, and fried in batter. In filleting take out the bone, skin, sinews, &c.; make a nice forcemeat; stuff and roll the fillets round. The 4 legs will thus make 8 pieces, which will be sufficient for a small dish, and these may be augmented by small pieces of fried paste cut into crescents, cockscombs, or other shapes. They must be served round a puree of some kind in the centre. To stew Chickens in haste,—Take fresh-killed chickens, clean, cut them in pieces, and scald them in hot water, with- out giving them time to cool: fry them in butter with sweet herbs chopped, white pepper, and salt, then add some boiling water and flour; stew them until the sauce is reduced : strain, and add to the sauce a tablespoonful of cream, the yolk of an egg beaten, squeeze a little lemon-juice over the chickens, and serve them up. This dish will be useful when it is requisite to add to the dinner at a short notice; and if the chickens do not grow cool, they will be tender. BLANC TO BOIL CHICKENS IN. 219. —Cut a lb. of veal and the same quantity of fat bacon into small pieces, and lay them in a stewpan with 4 lb. of butter; do not allow them to brown, but while the meat is white pour on boiling water, adding at the same time a clove, i a bay-leaf, a bundle of sweet herbs, and a little •shalot. When sufficiently stewed strain it through a hair-sieve over the fowl, which must simmer in it for f of an hour. The veal and bacon that have been employed in this blanc may be put into a mortar and pounded together for some kind of stuffing. It is the fashion to lard the breasts of boiled fowls with tongue. TO AD-IN-A-HOLE 220. —May be thought a very humble dish, but if well dressed is far from bad. Make a common batter of eggs, flour, and milk, but rather thicker than usual, and put in the centre of it a fowl boned and stuffed with forcemeat, and let it206 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIIT. be entirely covered with the batter; then bake it. 2 lbs. of beef, or any kind of meat, may be dressed in the same manner, and seasoned to the palate. GOOSE. 221. —Scald 4 or 6 sage-leaves, according as they are fresh or dry, the fresh ones being the strongest; chop them fine; take 1 large or 2 small onions, chop them, and then pour boiling water over them to make them eat mild ; mix the sage and onion with rather more than an equal quantity of fine bread-crumbs ; season well with pepper and salt; put this in- side the body of the goose; roast before a quick fire an hour or more, according to the size of the bird ; serve with gravy in the dish, and apple-sauce in a boat. In Ireland geese are sometimes stuffed with potatoes, the whole body being filled with them either whole or mashed; but it absorbs so much of the gravy as to injure the richness of the bird. Apple-sauce and gravy are sent up with geese in separate tureens. Green Geese are roasted without any stuffing, being merely peppered on the inside. A lemon squeezed over a duck or a goose is a great improvement. TO STEW GIBLETS. 222. — Stew them until the gizzards are perfectly tender: season them -with salt and pepper, a minced shalot, and a very small piece of mace. Before serving, give them one boil and a cup of cream, with a piece of butter rubbed in a tea- spoonful of flour. Each gizzard and liver divided into 4, the neck into 3, and the wings into 2. BUCKS. 223. —Roast in the same manner as goose. Stewed tcitli Green Peas.—Truss the duck as you would a fowl to boil, that is, with the legs inwards. Melt a piece of butter in a stewpan ; cut up in dice £ inch square about j lb. of streaked bacon ; put the duck and the bacon into the butter. When the duck is browned take it out, put in a tablespoonful of flour, add broth or water sufficient to half cover the duck ; throw in 1 ^ pint of peas, with an onion, and a faggot of parsley, thyme, and a bay-leaf. When the duck is done, strain off some of the gravy, thicken the peas with flour and butter, add a lumpPOULTRY AND GAME Chap. XIII.] 207 of sugar, and pepper and salt if required. The peas should hang together and all the fat be removed. Or : Put a few sage-leaves and some pepper inside the duck, half roast it, then dredge, and put it in a stewpan, with a little piece of butter, as much water as will cover it, an onion, a bunch of parsley and mint, pepper, and salt. Let it stew till nearly done, then strain the sauee ; add a pint of young shelled peas, and stew all together, until the whole is sufficiently cooked. With Turnips.—Cut h a dozen turnips, and scorch or fry them with a duck in butter in a stewpan ; then take out the turnips, add a little stock, an onion, pepper and salt, a bay- leaf, a few sage-leaves, and a sprig of thyme, and allow the duck to stew gently until quite tender : then strain and thicken the gravy, add the turnips to itf and serve it- up. Stewed with Cabbage.—Boil a cabbage, and allow it to drain ; half roast a duck, and put it with the cabbage sliced thin into gravy, seasoned with sweet marjoram, thyme, onions, pepper, and salt. Stew the duck until it is done enough, then strain and thicken the gravy; put the cabbage in a cloth, and squeeze it quite dry; dish the duck upon it, and pour the sauce round. These dishes may be made with cold roast ducks that have appeared at table ; but in that case the gravy must be enriched. Steived in Claret.—Make a gravy of the giblets ; rub the duck inside and outside with pepper and a little salt; peel and mince 2 or 3 onions, and, having half roasted the duck, put it into a stewpan with the gravy and onions. Let it stew very gently for f of an hour, adding towards the end a glass of claret; squeeze the juice of a lemon over the duck, and serve it up with fined bread or paste. The duck may be stuffed with forcemeat, in which a little sage should be chopped. To hash.—Cut a cold duck into joints ; and warm it, with- out boiling, in gravy, a glass of port-wine, a teaspoonful of made mustard, and a little butter and flour. To boil.—Put the bird for a few minutes into warm water; then take it out, and lay it in an earthen pan, pour a pint of boiling milk over it, and allow it to soak for 3 hours; dredgeMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIII. 208 it well with flour, and put it into cold water; let it boil for 20 minutes, and then send it to table smothered with onion- sauce. Canard farci.—Have a duck boned ; make a farce of veal and bacon-fat in equal proportions, chopped only; season it with seasoning spice (which see) ; fill the duck; tie it up in a cloth ; stew it in good gravy very gently for an hour; take it up, glaze it, and serve it either with stewed peas, turnips, or sauce piquante. Ducks devilled.—Split the duck, prick it all over with a fork, cover it either with mustard and cayenne pepper, diavoli paste, or Chetney, and broil it. Serve with a glass of lemon- pickle, 1 of wine, and 1 of ketchup, warmed with 3 table- spoonfuls of gravy. If Chetney be used the sauce will not require sugar, otherwise add a dessertspoonful of powdered white sugar. PIGEONS. 224.— To roast Pigeons.—Scald some parsley, chop it with the livers, mix them with a piece of fresh butter, season with pepper and salt; put a portion inside each pigeon; cover the breast with a slice of bacon-fat; roast them ; serve with parsley and butter in the dish. Or:—Stuff the whole of the body of the pigeon with veal stuffing: some persons merely chop a little parsley and put it inside ; but the other is the better way. A fine farce, made of pounded veal and bacon, and bread steeped in milk, is an excellent stuffing for pigeons. Another way.—Boil, pare, and pound chestnuts in a mortar, with equal parts of fat bacon finely rasped ; fill the pigeons with this stuffing, cover them with slices of fat bacon, and wrap them in young vine-leaves; roast the whole together, and send them up with bacon and vine-leaves, which impart a fine flavour to the pigeons. Partridges may be dressed the same way, and truffles substituted for chestnuts. To broil Pigeons.—Cut the pigeon down the back, flatten and truss it as a fowl for broiling. Egg it on both sides; season with pepper and salt; dip it in chopped sweet herbs and bread-crumbs ; warm a little butter, sprinkle it over, and then dip the pigeon again in the crumbs. Broil it a lightPOULTRY AND GAME. Chap. XIII.] 209 brown, serve with sauce as follows:—chop line a few shalots, boil them in a tablespoonful of vinegar, then add gravy, thicken with flour and butter, scald the liver, mince it, throw it into the sauce; add pepper, salt, and a little ketchup, and 2 or 3 mushrooms chopped. A la Franc.aisc.—When the pigeons are prepared for dress- ing, lay them in a dish, and pour over them 2 or 3 glasses of port wine ; let them remain for some hours. Prepare a force- meat of chopped sage, a little bit of onion, some fat and lean I bacon, and pepper; moisten it with egg or rich gravy ; stuff the crops of the pigeons, and put them into the stew with the I wine, 30 corns of pepper for 6 pigeons, a blade of mace, an ] onion, and a little broth. Stew them till' tender, then take them out, beat up the yolk of an egg wit h some oiled butter, i brush the pigeons thickly, cover them well with bread-crumbs ; n let them cool a little, then repeat the process. Put them into the oven just to brown, strain and thicken the gravy, and send them up. A Ragout of Pigeons.—Stew the gizzards in a little water, with the trimmings; chop them veiy small, and chop the liver also; make them into a forcemeat with grated ham, bread-crumbs, herbs, &c., and fill the pigeons with this force- meat rolled round the yolk of a hard-boiled egg. Put the j pigeons into a stewpan, with a little butter to brown them; I add the gravy from the gizzards, a little flour, and an onion ; let them stew very gently, and then skim the gravy; add to it I a glass of wine or sauce, and, having boiled up the gravy and ij thickened it, serve it with the pigeons. To dress Pigeons icith Peas.—Put the pigeons into a stew- I pan, with a little butter just to stiffen them ; then take them ■ out, put some small slices of bacon into the pan, give them a I fine colour, then draw them, and add a spoonful of flour to i the butter ; then put in the pigeons and bacon, turn them, | moisten them by degrees with gravy, and bring it to the con- H sistence of sauce; boil it; season with parsley, young onions H a bay-leaf, and let it simmer. When half done, put in a quart |] of peas; shake them often; when sufficiently done, take out p the bay-leaf, thicken the peas with flour and butter, and dish a the pigeons. There should be no gravy left. A Pupton of Pigeons may be much diversified in the ma- p210 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIII. terials, but is generally thought excellent. Lay a forcemeat, made vei-y savoury, in a small dish, like a paste lining; then put in layers very thin slices of fat bacon, squab pigeons, sliced sweetbreads blanched, asparagus-tops, mushrooms, cocks’ combs, a palate or two boiled quite tender and cut in slices, and the yolks of 4 eggs boiled hard. Lay more force- meat over the dish as a pie-crust, bake it, and turn it out to serve, with rich gravy in the dish ; or make it into a vol au vent. Pigeons in Jelly are a beautiful dish, as thus :—Save some of the liquor in which a knuckle of veal has been boiled, or boil a calf’s or a neat’s foot; put the broth into a pan with a blade of mace, a bunch of sweet herbs, some white pepper, lemon-peel, a slice of lean bacon, and the pigeons. The heads and feet must be left on, but the nails must be clipped close; bake them, and let them stand to be cold; season them as you like, before baking. When done, take them out of the liquor, cover them close to preserve the colour, and clear the jelly by boiling with the whites of 2 eggs; then strain it through a thick cloth dipped in boiling water, and put into a sieve. The fat must be perfectly removed before it be cleared. Put the jelly over and round them rough. They must be trussed, and the neck propped up with skewers, to appear in a natural state, before they are baked. Another way.—Pick 2 very nice pigeons, and make them look as well as possible by singeing, washing, and cleaning the heads well; leave the heads and the feet on, but the nails must be clipped close to the claws; roast them of a very nice brown ; and wdien done, put a little sprig of myrtle into the bill of each. Have ready a savoury jelly, as before, and with it half fill a bowl of such a size as shall be proper to turn down on the dish you mean it to be served in. When the jelly is cool and the birds are cold, see that no gravy hangs to the birds, and then lay them upside down in the jelly. Before the rest of it begins to set, pour it over the birds so as to be 3 inches above the feet. This should be done full 24 hours be- fore serving. This dish has a very handsome appearance in the middle range of a second course ; or, when served with the jelly roughed large, it makes a side or corner dish, its size being then less. The head should be kept up as if alive, by tyingPOULTRY AND GAME. Chap. XIII.] 211 the neck with some thread, and the legs bent as if the pigeon sat upon them. Wood-pigeons.—Let them hang to be tender; roast and serve with a rich gravy. They must not be roasted so much as the common pigeons. Pigeons, woodcock fashion.—Clean and truss the pigeons, cut a slice of bread, toast and butter it, then chop equal quantities of mushrooms and anchovies very finely together, pepper it, spread it on the toast rather thickly, and put it under the pigeons while they are roasting. The anchovies should, however, be used sparingly, or their flavour will over- power that of the bird. LARKS.—E. R. 225.—Larks may be roasted encased in fat bacon, and covered with vine-leaves. Rub the larks over with egg, and dip them in fresh bread-crumbs, sprinkling a little salt over them; roast before a quick fire, basting with fresh butter, the spit turning rapidly. Sparrows, when young and plump, are excellent eating, if cooked in the same way, skewered toge- ther, and the skewers tied on a spit. Woodcocks, snipes, quails, green plovers, and ortolans are not to be drawn: lay a toast under them while roasting, to catch the trail; serve them up with good gravy and bread-sauce. To stew Larks.—Put a number of fat and well-cleaned larks into a stewpan, having put a delicate bit of bacon into the inside of each, with a sufficient quantity of good stock gravy: place sage-leaves over the breasts of each, and over that a thin wrapper of bacon; stew them gently, and serve hot. A VItalienne.—Scald sour grapes, and then stone them ; beat up 2 yolks of eggs with a spoonful of lemon-juice, a very little flour, a bit of butter, and chopped parsley ; season it highly with cayenne pepper ; add a spoonful or two of gravy. Boil this a moment, then put in the grapes, and stir them with a spoon on the fire to warm, without boiling. Roast the larks with bread-crumbs, and serve them up with the sauce. Observe, the sauce should be very sharp and highly seasoned. A la Macedoine.—Have a dozen larks boned ; make a farce with their livers and a little veal (game livers or rabbit' meat r 2MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIII. 212 will answer as well) and an equal quantity of fat bacon; pound it fine ; sea- son with herbs and seasoning spice; fill the larks ; put them in a stewpan with a little very good gravy; bake them for i of an hour; glaze them; dish them up on a border Larks. of mashed potatoes, filling up the centre and round the sides with carrots, turnips, &c., as represented in the cut; pour a good gravy round the dish. WHEA TEARS—E. R. 226.—May be dressed in the same manner as larks; or, when trussed for roasting, brush each bird over with the yolk of an egg, or, what is better, dip them in batter; roll them in fine bread-crumbs, and spit them on a wooden or silver skewer, a dozen upon each. When spitted, brush them again with the egg, and dredge them with the bread-crumbs; tie the skewers upon a spit, and roast them before a brisk fire, basting all the time with fresh butter: they will take about 12 minutes; but if not dressed the same day on which they are killed, they will not be good more than the day after. VENISON. If the venison be fresh, merely diy it with a cloth, and hang it in an airy place. Should it be necessary to keep it for any length of time, rub it all over with beaten ginger. If it happen to be musty, wash it, first, with lukewarm water, and, secondly, with milk and water, also lukewarm. Then dry it very well with clean cloths, and rub it over with powdered ginger. Observe the same method with hare. It must be looked at every day, and peppered if attacked by flies. Venison should be fat, and kept until quite tender. A haunch of buck will take 4 or 5 hours roasting; doe, only 24 hours. Venison should be rather under than over done. Gravy213 POULTRY AND GAME. Chap. XIII.] for it should be put into a boat, and not into the dish. Use water-plates, or have your plates set over heaters. Currant jelly should be brought up cold. 227.— To roast a Haunch of Venison.—Cut off the knuckle, trim the flap and remove the thick skin on the flank; nick the joint at the cramp-bone, which will make the cushion fuller when roasted. Spit' it, rub it over with butter, sprinkle well with salt, cover it with a sheet of very thin paper, then with a paste of flour and water, and again with paper; tie it up well with stout string laced across it; baste it all the time it is roasting, which will be from 4 to 5 hours. } of an hour before sending it to table remove the paste, throw a good handful of salt on it, dredge with flour, and baste with a little fresh butter. Venison Steaks.-—Cut them from the neck; season them with pepper and salt. When the gridiron has been well heated over a bed of bright coals, grease the bars, and lay the steaks upon it. Broil them well, turning them once, and taking care to save as much of the gravy as possible. Serve them up with some currant-jelly laid on each steak. To hash cold T enison.—Cut the meat in nice small slices, and put the trimmings and bones into a saucepan, with barely water enough to cover them. Let them stew for 2 hours ; then strain the liquid into a stewpan; add to it some bits of butter j rolled in flour, and whatever gravy was left of the venison. Stir in some currant-jelly, and boil it 4 an hour: then put in the meat, and keep it over the fire just long enough to warm it through, but do not allow it to boil. GAME Ought not to be thrown away even when it has been kept I a very long time; for when it seems to be spoiled, it may often be made fit for eating by nicely cleaning it, and washing with vinegar and water. If there is danger of birds not keeping, | draw, crop, and pick them; then wash in 2 or 3 waters, and I rub them with salt. Have ready a large saucepan of boiling water, and plunge them into it one by one, drawing them up j and down by the legs, that the water may pass through them. | Let them stay 5 or 6 minutes in ; then hang them up in a cold I place. When drained, pepper and salt the inside well. ByMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIII. 214 this method the most delicate birds may be preserved. Before roasting, wash them well. But, as a rule, no game should be washed, for one-half the game that is sent to table is spoiled by being saturated in water. In dressing Game be careful to keep a clear fire. Let it be done of a bright brown, but not much roasted, or the fine flavour will be destroyed. It requires to be continually basted, and to be sent up beautifully frothed. Wild-fowl take a much shorter time than domestic poultry. The following will give, pretty nearly, the time required for roasting the several birds:—Wild-ducks £ of an hour, widgeons the same, pheasants 4 an hour, grouse J of an hour, quails 10 minutes, woodcocks 20 minutes, partridges from 20 to 25 minutes. A hare will take an hour; the hind part re- quires most heat, and that should be attended to, as it com- monly happens that the thick part of the thigh is underdone, as well as the shoulders. The blood stagnated round the neck and shoulders is not easily removed : to do this, put those parts into a pan of lukewarm water, and prick them with a skewer; before dressing, rub and squeeze it out. To take off the fishy taste which wild-fowl sometimes have, put an onion, salt, and hot water into the dripping-pan, and baste them for the first 10 minutes with this; then take away the pan, and baste constantly with butter. PHEASANTS AND PARTRIDGES. 228.-—Roast them, and serve with a fine gravy and bread- sauce in separate tureens. The cock-pheasant keeps longer than the hen. When cold, they may be made into excellent patties, but their flavour should not be overpowered by any admixture. It is not usual to stuff pheasants; though they are some- times larded; but the following forcemeat will be found a great improvement. Cut a piece of lean veal into small dice, with about a third of bacon also minced, season it with a little pepper, and put it into the body of the pheasant, which must be tied, to prevent the escape of the stuffing, or roasted with the head downwards. The gravy from the veal will dif- fuse itself through the pheasant, and' render it more juicy and tender, while the bacon is always to be preferred when put. in- side a bird, though the outer larding may be more ornamental. Beef is sometimes substituted for veal.215 POULTRY AND GAME. Chap. XIII.] Partridges, being less dry than pheasants, do not require stuffing, although they are improved by it, made either of chestnuts or truffles and bacon. They are sometimes roasted, wrapped in bacon and vine-leaves: bread-crumbs are essential. In some parts of Kent partridges are sent up with forcemeat- balls in the dish. To steio Partridges.—Truss them with the wings over the back, and the legs drawn in ; cut a piece of pork or bacon in long strips, and put them into a stewpan with a piece of butter the size of a walnut. Fry the bacon brown, and when quite done put in the partridges, and keep turning them until they are very brown, taking care that the bacon shall be j as much on the breast as possible ; then add about a teacupful of gravy and some trimmings of meat and vegetables. Have j ready a large cabbage boiled ; when well drained, slice it with butter, pepper, and salt, put it while warm with the gravy to the partridges, and let them stew gently for an hour, turning the birds frequently. Serve up with the bacon underneath, and the cabbage round them, squeezed dry, and the sauce wel 1 skimmed. Or :—Take 4 young partridges nicely cleaned, and put them into a deep cooking-pot, with a piece of butter and a little water; put them on a brisk fire; keep the cover of the pot on, and move it about constantly, to prevent the birds burning or browning on the bottom. The partridges are suffi- ciently cooked the instant the red gravy is seen to drip from the bird, and mix with the melted butter. Serve them up hot, with a small quantity of cayenne pepper. . Salmi of Partridge.—Half roast the partridges, cut them up neatly, take off the skin; put the trimmings in a stewpan, with a bit of butter and a tablespoonful of flour ; stir the whole over the fire ; then add a glass of white wine and a little gravy or stock, some shalots, chopped parsley, thyme, bay-leaf, pepper, salt; let it boil fast for 4 an hour; strain, skim, add the juice of a lemon, and make the joints of the partridge hot in the sauce. Or:—Roast the partridges, leaving them underdone. When cold, cut them into pieces, taking oft' the skin. Put 3 spoon- fuls of oil into a saucepan, a glass of claret, salt, pepper, a shalot, and the juice of a lemon. Toss the partridges in this sauce until they are sufficiently done to send to table. Or, Cut up and place on a dish the breasts, wings, and legs IMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XITI. 216 of any roasted game you may have left; cover it with another dish, or tin cover, and set it over a pan of boiling water to keep warm. Then pound the small bones of the carcase, with the inside, in a mortar, and put them into a saucepan with a little gravy thickened with a little flour rolled in butter, a wine-glass of port wine, a spoonful of ketchup, a very small piece of shalot chopped fine, cayenne pepper, and salt. When it has been boiled for £ of an hour, strain it through a sieve, to form it into a perfect puree, and pour it over the game in your dish; garnish with forcemeat-balls, and slices of lemon cut thin. Broiled Partridge.—Cut the bird down the back; break the merrythought, which will allow it to be made quite fat; cut off the feet at the joint, and skewer it as a fowl to broil; dry, flour, egg, and sprinkle it with chopped herbs and bread- crumbs, well seasoned ; broil and serve with a little good gravy, with a mushroom or two chopped up small. Or:—Omit the egg and crumbs, broil it quite plain, rub it over with butter, season with pepper and salt, and serve without gravy, squeezing half a lemon over it as it leaves the kitchen. Guinea and Pea fowl taste much like pheasant if properly hung: dress and serve the same way. Their eggs are delicate, and must boil 1£ minute. WOODCOCKS, SNIPES, AND QUAILS, 229. —Keep good several days. Roast them without draw- ing, and serve on toast: the trail of the former is the most esteemed part of the bird ; but the thigh and back are the best parts. In helping, the carver must be careful to remove first a small bitter bag from the trail. Or, take out the trail, chop it well, spread it on a buttered toast, season with pepper and salt, sprinkle a few crumbs over, and brown it in front of the fire under the woodcocks. Quail.—Cut a thin piece of fat bacon the size of the breast; lay a vine-leaf over the breast, and then the bacon ; fasten with string, and roast them. GROUSE AND MOORCOCK.—E. R. 230. —Mix a small lump of butter with a few bread-crumbs, and put it in the inside of the birds—not in the crop—it keeps them moist. They require to be nicely roasted and well basted,POULTRY AND GAME. Chap. XIII.] 217 otherwise they become dry. Serve with fried bread-crumbs and bread-sauce; in trussing, the head should be twisted under the wing. OR TO LA NS. 231.—Pick and singe, but do not draw them: tie on a bird-spit and roast them. Some persons like bacon in slices tied between them, but the taste of it spoils the flavour ol the I ortolan. Cover them with crumbs of bread. Melted butter, with a little grated nutmeg, for sauce. WILD D UCKS—E. R. j 232.—Must be roasted at a very brisk fire; they take from 12 to 20 minutes, according to taste. Some people are of 1 opinion that they should only fly through the kitchen : by epi- cures they are considered to be in true perfection when they come up dry and brown, and, when cut, flood the dish with a gravy. The means of ensuring success consists in a very ardent fire, rapid motion of the spit, and constant basting. The carver should score the breast of the duck, put a piece of butter on it, and cut a lemon in half, putting on one half a spoonful of salt, and on the other a cayenne-spoonful of cayenne; put the two together, and squeeze vigorously over the duck ; but, those who desire to taste duck par excellence should substitute shickaree-sauce for the lemon. To stctv Wild Duck.—Shred thyme, winter savory, and sage, very small, and put them into some strong broth, with a little pepper, salt, and 2 spoonfuls of wine; stew them together for i of an hour; nearly roast the ducks, add the gravy that falls from them, but not the fat; then place a deep dish under them, and pour this sauce through and over them into it. Remove the ducks, cut them up, and put them with the sauce into a stewpan over a stove, and let them stew till they are done enough. Wild Ducks, Teal, Widgeons, and Dun-birds should be taken up with the gravy in. Baste them with butter, and sprinkle a little salt before they are taken up, put a good gravy I upon them, and serve with shalot-sauce in a boat. Landrail, Ruffs, and Rees are skewered as quails ; put thin slices of bacon over them, and roast them about 10 minutes. Serve with a good gravy in the dish.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap.

As they are usually paunched in the field, the cook cannot prevent this; but the hare keeps longer, and eats much better, if not opened for 4 or f> days, or according to the weather. If paunched, as soon as a hare comes in, it should be wiped quite dry, the heart and liver taken out, and the liver scalded to keep for the stuffing. Repeat this wiping every day; mix pepper and ginger, and rub on the inside; and put a large piece of charcoal into it, to prevent the musty taste occasioned by damp. Hares should never be hung by the hind legs; for, as the animal is commonly kept for a week or 10 days, if so hung, drops of moisture will in a couple of days be seen to issue from the mouth, thus draining the carcase of its natural juice. It should, therefore, be always suspended by the fore legs. An old hare should be kept as long as possible, if to be roasted. It must also be well soaked ; and while roasting it must be constantly basted with butter, or the skin will become hardened and the flesh rendered sapless.Chap. XIII.] 219 POULTRY AND GAME Hare requires to be kept at a distance from the fire. Send it to table with currant-jelly and gravy. It is now the fashion to bone hares, which greatly improves their appearance, lessens the difficulty of carving, and assists in making the gravy. Break the bones, and stew them in water, and any small quan- tity of meat parings ; boil the liver, which is to be chopped and put into the stuffing, in this gravy, and add a little brown- ing to give it a colour. 235.— To roast Hare.—After it is skinned, let it be ex- tremely well wipe® ; and, if old, lard it, which will make it tender, as will also letting it lie in vinegar. If, however, it is put into vinegar, it should be exceedingly well washed in water afterwards. Put a large well-seasoned stuffing into the belly, and then sew it up. Baste it well with milk till half done, and afterwards with butter. The hare should be kept at a distance from the fire at first. Serve with a fine froth, rich gravy, and currant-jelly sauce ; little gravy in the dish. For stuffing use the liver pounded, an anchovy, some fat bacon, a little suet, herbs, pepper, salt, nutmeg, crumbs of bread, and an egg to bind it all. The ears must be nicely cleaned, singed, and made crisp, being reckoned a dainty. With Cream-sauce.—Boil the liver, and chop it very fine; mix a small portion with the stuffing, and reserve the remain- der for the sauce. Put a bunch of sweet herbs into the drip- ) ping-pan, and pour a quart of good milk over it. Baste the hare continually with the milk, and when it is rather more than half roasted take the sauce out of the dripping-pan, and put another quart of new milk to the herbs. Take the hare, and slit the neck in order that the gravy may run from it into the milk that has been added ; then skewer the head down again ; baste continually as before, until within 20 minutes of its being served ; then remove the milk, and baste with butter, dredging it gently with flour twice during that time: add the two quan- tities of milk together, stir in a lump of butter and flour; put in the chopped liver, warm it over the fire, stirring all the time, being careful not to let. it boil, as that would curdle it. The hare must be well wiped with a dry cloth previous to spitting, but on no account be washed, as that would spoil it. To cook a ITare Derrynane fashion.—Take 3 or 4 eggs, a pint, of new milk, a couple of handfuls of Hour; make them into a batter, and, when the hare is roasting, baste it well,220 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIII. repeating the operation until the batter thickens and forms a coating all over the hare: this should be allowed to brown but not to burn. Old hares should be jugged. Leicestershire Jugged Hare.—Skin the hare, and cut it in pieces, but do not wash it; strew it over with pepper and salt, fry it brown. Make a seasoning of 2 anchovies, a sprig of thyme, a little parsley, a nutmeg grated, a little mace, a few cloves pounded, and a teaspoonful of grated lemon-peel. Strew this over the hare, after having carefully taken it out of the pan clear of fat: slice 4 lb. of fat bacon very thin, put it into a jug or jar, a layer of hare and one of bacon upon it, until the whole is put in, then add rather less than 4 pint of ale; cover the jug very closely, so as perfectly to keep in the steam; put it into a kettle of cold water, lay a tile on the top of the jug, and let it boil 3 hours if the hare be young, or 4 or 5 if an old one. Take the jug out of the kettle, pick out all the bacon which has not melted, and shake the hare up in a stew- pan, with a little mushroom-ketchup, a glass of port wine, a little mushroom-powder if at hand, and a little butter and flour, well mixed together to thicken the gravy. A tea- spoonful of lemon-pickle, and 1 of browning, will heighten the flavour. LEVERET, OR RABBIT\ WITH IIERBS.-E. R. 236. —Cut either of the two into pieces, put it into a stewpan with butter, salt, pepper, parsley, sorrel, and young onions chopped. When sufficiently done, add the juice of a lemon. The legs may be broiled and laid on the top. RABBITS.—E, R. 237. —Rabbits, being rather dry meat, are much improved by larding. Should the - process be deemed too troublesome upon common occasions, a good effect may be produced by lining the inside of the rabbit with slices of fat bacon pre- viously to putting in the stuffing. This is a very easy method of improvement, and ought never to be neglected. A boned rabbit, larded, stuffed, and braised, affords a cheap and elegant side-dish for a-dinner party. Reacted.—Have the rabbit trussed like a hare. Fill it with veal stuffing made with rather a larger proportion of marjoramPOULTRY AND GAME. Chap. XIII.] 221 than usual; egg the rabbit and cover with bread-crumbs. Chop up the liver fine; throw it into some good gravy for sauce. It should be served nicely frothed. Boiled with Onions.—Boil slowly, and send to table covered, or “ smothered,” with onion sauce. Boiled with Jerusalem Artichokes.—Cut the rabbits in joints, put them on to boil, with water barely covering them. When about half done, put to them some Jerusalem artichokes sliced, a sufficient quantity to make the sauce thick; and when they are done, mash them as you would turnips ; add a little of the liquor they were boiled in, pepper, salt, and a little cream; pour over the rabbits, and serve. Fried.—Cut them in joints, parboil them, egg them, and cover with chopped herbs and crumbs; fry them. Serve with liver sauce made a little sharp with lemon-juice. Or :—Cut the rabbit in joints, parboil it; put it in a pan with a little oil, tarragon vinegar, pepper, salt, a slice or two of onion; soak it for 3 hours; then dry it, dip in batter, fry I crisply. Serve with tornata sauce. To make a Rabbit taste much like Hare.-—Choose one that is young, but full-grown ; hang it in the skin 3 or 4 days ; then skin it; and lay it, without washing, in a seasoning of black cl pepper and allspice in a very fine powder, a glass of port wine, and the same quantity of vinegar. Baste it occasionally for 40 hours ; then stuff it, and roast it as a hare, and with the same sauce. Do not wash oft' the liquor that it was a soaked in. * A la Frangaise.—Should be cut in pieces ; reserve the liver, put a piece of bacon cut in pieces into a stewpan, and brown it well, and then lay it aside ; put a piece of butter and the rabbit in the pan; turn and toss it well until it is quite white. When it is getting brown, dredge a tablespoonful of flour over it, turning all the while, and when the flour is dry put the rabbit in a plate. Then add a piece more butter to the remaining sauce, and stir it well together, and when brown add a cupful of water; continue stirring, and put in the rabbit with plenty of very small onions, the bacon, some mushrooms, a bunch of parsley and thyme and a bay-leaf tied witli a thread, .and some salt and pepper; let it stew very gently over a slow fire for 4 hours. Add the liver and a glass of port222 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIII. wine 1 hour before serving, and, should there not be sufficient sauce, a little gravy from time to time put in hot. Stewed with Onio?is.—Cut up the rabbits, reserving the livers. Put a piece of butter rolled in flour into a stevvpan, add boiling water, stirring till well mixed, a little pepper and salt, and then the rabbits slightly dredged with flour. Let them stew till tender, boil a bunch of parsley, put the livers into the stew, and when they are done enough chop them with the parsley, a little pepper and salt, and enough cream to make them into sauce ; warm it up in a small saucepan, and spread it equally over the rabbit; have ready 6 large onions, boiled and pulped through a sieve, and mixed up with cream. Put the onions into the centre of a dish, the rabbits round, and the gravy the last. Stewed with Mushrooms.—Boil 2 anchovies or a table- spoonful of the essence in milk and water, pepper and salt, and an onion. Cut up the rabbit, and stew it gently until done enough ; then strain the gravy, add a little butter rolled in flour, a glass of wine, and mushrooms. Toss the whole toge- ther, squeeze a little lemon-juice over the rabbit, or pour lemon-pickle upon it, and send it to table with the sauce, and the liver made into forcemeat-balls. Quenelles de Lapereau.—Scrape the meat from a rabbit, which pound perfectly. Boil a calf’s udder, and when cold pound it as fine as butter. Make a panada thus: take a spoonful of chopped mushrooms, as much green lemon-peel as will lay on a shilling, a very little chopped shalot and thyme, and a good pinch of chopped parsley, pepper and salt, and a piece of butter; sweat the whole over the fire; take two French rolls, soak the crumb in milk, squeeze it dry, add it and a spoonful of white sauce to the herbs, dry it over the fire ; when quite stiff, take it off and add the yolk of an egg. Put it in a cool place; when cold take equal quantities of meat, udder, and panada, pound for 20 minutes, add 1 whole egg, try it and see if it requires more seasoning ; rub it through a fine sieve. Make the quenelles in tablespoons, poach them in boiling water for about 10 minutes: serve with white sauce, or white mushroom sauce. The Kloes of Berlin are a sort of Quenelles made of flour, or the soft part of bread steeped in milk ; also of rice or semo- lina, boiled in broth, as they may be either made savoury orChap. XITL] 223 POULTRY AND GAME. sweet, and may be composed either of poultry or any kind of white meat, as well as in this manner:— Melt i lb. of butter, and break into it the yolks of 6 and the whites of 4 eggs, seasoned with a little salt, pepper, and nutmeg; all whipped together in 3 small cups of milk, and made into a paste by the proper addition of flour. From this paste form balls of a moderate size—for they will swell in the boiling water, in which they must be left for 8 to 10 minutes. Then take them out with a skimmer, and serve them either as a garnish for ragouts and dishes of vegetables; or else piled up in the centre of a small dish, and surrounded with fried potatoes. Pilau of Rabbit.-—Cut up a rabbit or fowl; pound a couple of onions in a mortar; extract the juice, and mix it with a saltspoonful of ground ginger, a teaspoonful of salt, and the juice of a lemon: rub this into the meat; cut up 2 onions in slices, and fry them in J lb. of butter. When brown take them out, and put in the meat; let them stew together. Have 1 lb. of rice half boiled in broth; put the whole meat, &c., into ajar, with J pint of milk, some whole peppercorns, half a dozen cloves, and a little more salt. Secure the mouth of the jar, and bake it until done enough, adding a little broth should the butter and milk not be sufficient to moisten it. TO CRISP PARSLEY. 238.—Pick some bunches of young parsley, wash them, and ‘swing them in a cloth to dry ; put them on a sheet of paper in a toaster before the fire, and keep them frequently turned till they are quite crisp, which will be in about 6 or 8 minutes. To fry Parsley.—When the parsley has been washed and thoroughly dried, throw it into lard or butter which is on the point to boil; take it up with a slice the instant it is crisp, and lay it on paper on a sieve before the fire. A wire basket is the nicest thing to use for ire Basket for frying, frying parsley, or anything requiring to be fried.224 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIII. FRIED BREAD FOR GARNISHING. 239.—Take slices of stale bread about a third of an inch thick, cut them into shapes with a paste-cutter, fry them in fresh batter a light brown, lay them upon a cloth to dry, and place them round the dish. They may be made to adhere by brushing the under part with a little flour mixed with white of egg. Bread-crumhs.—All game and small birds are improved by the addition of bread-crumbs, either fried or toasted; the latter is the more delicate preparation : grate the crumbs, and put them into a tin shallow dish before the fire, shaking thent occasionally until they are well browned: send them up in the dish ; with a tureen of good brown gravy made from the insides and trimmings of'the birds, but without any kind of seasoning.Chap. XIV.] 225 SALT-WATER FISH. CHAPTER XIV. SALT-WATER FISH. The great excellence of English Jish, and the fresh state in which it is, in London, generally brought to table, combined with the simplicity of our national tastes in cookery, render it unnecessary to resort to much art in the preparation of the finer kinds, which are usually preferred simply boiled, broiled, or fried ; but this only holds good with the superior varieties, whereas skate, halibut, ling, plaice, flounders, mackerel, and many others, may be much improved by the method of dressing them. There is perhaps no article of eatables in which imposition is more practised in London than in fish; and if you are not yourself a good judge, you will be almost sure to be de- ceived unless you always deal with the same fishmonger, and he is of respectable character; for the lower class of petty dealers never have in their shops any of the finer sorts of good quality. You must therefore either pay a good price, or confine yourself to those ordinary species which are in com- mon use and plentiful in the market. The following hints may, however, be useful in forming a judgment of the different sorts:— Preparatory to the dressing, the fish should be carefully gutted by the fishmonger, and afterwards cleaned thoroughly by the cook from all appearances of blood, particularly scraping the blood that lodges about the back-bone, and cutting the fish open for some distance below the vent. If, however, the fish- monger does not clean it, fish is seldom very nicely done, for common cooks are apt not to slit the fish low enough, by which, and not thoroughly washing the blood, &c., from the bone, a very disgusting mass is left within, and mistaken for liver; but fishmongers generally wash it beyond what is ne- cessary for cleaning, and by perpetual watering diminish the flavour. It should, in fact, be handled as little as possible, Q226 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIV. and never left in the water a moment after it is washed. In washing it, the best way is to hold the fish firmly by the head with your left hand, and scrape off the scales or slime; wash it once in clean cold water, and either dry it with a towel or hang it up and leave it to drain. Some kinds of fish will bear keeping better than others, but few are improved by it; some kinds are said to lose much of their delicacy and peculiar flavour every hour after the tide in which they were caught is lost. Turbot is stated to improve by keeping for a day or two ;a but the acknowledged superiority of the Dublin Bay turbot is said to arise from its being dressed immediately upon being caught, “ as it then tastes as if it had been boiled in cream.” Salmon, in losing a tide, loses a por- tion of the fine white curd which intervenes between each flake, and subsequently becomes more rich, but changes its character, the large flakes disappearing with the curd with which they are amalgamated. u Much also depends upon knowing in what way each particular fish may be cooked so as to make its appearance to the greatest advantage. Many there are that are unpalatable when dressed in one particular way, but very good if another mode of cooking be adopted. A stewed carp affords a really splendid dish, a boiled carp one of the worst that can be brought to table. The merits of a sur-mullet broiled, baked, or fried, enveloped in white paper, with its liver for sauce, are too well known to require any comment; and yet, when simply boiled and gutted as you would a whiting, it is a sad woolly and insipid affair.” b The crimping of fish causes it to eat crisp, and so improves the firmness if it be woolly; but it is unnecessary to perform the opera- tion while the animal is alive, though it should be done soon afterwards. Fish that is to be boiled must be put on the fire in cold hard water ; when it boils, skim with the greatest care; throw in a little cup of cold water to check the extreme of heat, then keep it simmering* only, lest the outside break before the thick and inner part be* done; but “ crimped fish” should be put into boiling water, and simmered a few minutes. A large handful of coarse salt, with a small piece of saltpetre, and a a Ude—who ought to be a good judge—states, in his ‘Cookery,’ from his many years’ observation, “that a turbot kept two or three days is much better eating than a fresh one.”—p. 238. b Piscator on Fish, p. 8.227 Chap. XIY.] SALT-WATER FISH. little horseradish, should be also put into the water in which fish is boiled ; and it is rendered firmer by the addition of 2 or 3 spoonfuls of vinegar. In France they add to this a quantity of spice, thyme, laurel-leaves, and garlic ; and, as wine is there cheap, they sometimes use vin ordinaire instead of water. This, however, is not thrown away, for it is equally good when reboiled. Cod, haddock, and whiting eat firmer if a little salt be put into their gills, and they be hung up a few hours before dressing. Care must be taken to preserve the roe, milt, and liver whole; to let them be sufficiently dressed ; and to place them conspicuously when served. The sound adhering to the bone must be left there, but veiy carefully cleaned. When the fish is dished up, it should be placed at once upon the table. To judge if a large fish be sufficiently boiled, draw up the fish- plate, and with a thin knife try if the fish easily divides from the bone in the thick parts, which it will when done enough. Keep it hot, not by letting it sodden in the water, but by laying the fish-plate crossways on the kettle, and covering with a thick cloth wetted with hot water; for if left in the water after it is ready, it loses its firmness, and becomes woolly. Always serve boiled fish on a double napkin, and put the white side of flat fish upwards. On this subject, although aware of the more fashionable mode being to lay the fish on a silver drainer, we still hold to the antiquated folded napkin, the neat white- ness of which equals silver in appearance, while its texture better drains the moisture from the fish. The dish certabily looks more complete if fried fish be served round the boiled ; . but this should be confined to the small fry of smelts or gudgeons, alternately placed with the roe or milt, merely as a garnish. Great care is necessary to drain the water from the boiled fish, that their dryness and colour may not be lessened. In the frying offish, one great point is to prepare it pro- perly. Take, for instance, a sole, lay it on a cloth, wipe it thoroughly diy on both sides, then dredge it with flour, beat up an egg, and lay it on with a brush, shewing on it finely- grated bread or biscuit crumbs; have the fat so boiling hot that all the hissing and bubbling must have subsided before the fish is put in, and let the quantity not be stinted, or the fish, when taken out, will be greasy. The fryingpan must be put upon a clear cinder fire, and not left for a moment until Q 2228 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIV. the fish is done at a moderate rate, neither too quick nor too slow ; and when done, lay it upon a cloth or writing-paper to drain off the fat. Hog’s-lard and butter are the materials most generally used, as are also the drippings from roast meat; for a great preju- dice exists in England against frying with oil, arising no doubt partly from expense as well as dislike, although it is more delicate than any fatty substance that can be employed for that purpose. Throughout the southern countries of Europe nothing else is ever used in the frying of either fish or meat of any kind, and dishes thus dressed ever appear superior on the foreign tables to those of our own. The oil, if skimmed when done with, may be employed again until entirely used ; and lard, if poured into cold water when melted, will harden on the surface. The largeness of quantity does not therefore occasion additional cost; and even should meat be fried in it after fish, it will occasion no unpleasant flavour. In broiling fish, care should be taken to make the gridiron very hot, and to rub the bars with butter previously to using. Fish prepared for broiling, after it is washed, should be rubbed well with vinegar, dried in a cloth, and floured—the vinegar preserving the skin entire, and the flour preventing it sticking to the bars. A cinder or a charcoal fire is the best, but a little salt thrown on a coal fire will check the smoke, and cause it to burn like embers. In the dressing of flat fish as cutlets, the fillets should be lifted from the bones, and the spine which runs through the centre of the round sorts should be extracted. The stewing of fish, and dressing it in fillets or cutlets, re- quires considerably more care in the cookery, as well as cost in the ingredients, than either of the previous modes; and as a preliminary to the operation, a gravy should be got ready, to be made in the following manner:—Take out all the bones, cut off the heads and tails, and, if this should not be sufficient, add a flounder, an eel, or any small common fish; stew them •with an onion, pepper, salt, and sweet herbs; strain it, and thicken it to the consistence of cream, flavouring with a slight addition of wine or any other sauce. The French employ the commonest sorts of their wine as a marinade, or sauce, both for the boiling and stewing of fish ; and that of English growth may be substituted in this country, if the cheaper kinds of foreign wine should be thought too expensive. Families whoSALT-WATER FISH. 229 Chap. XIV.] have no home-made wine of their own may use cider instead, but it will not afford the flavour of wine of even an inferior description. Indeed, those who look closely to economy, and who are satisfied with a more homely style of cookery, fre- quently substitute a quart of ale instead of the wine or cider, together with a small quantity of chili vinegar, a glass of soy or essence of anchovy, to which fennel, chives, thyme, and bay-leaves may be added according to fancy ; and an excellent sauce may thus be prepared, if mixed with the judgment of a good palate. MARINADE 240.—Is commonly used in France for the purpose of boiling fish, which imbibes from it a more pleasant flavour than it naturally possesses, and has been so generally adopted by English professed cooks that we here insert the receipt:—Cut up 2 carrots, 3 onions, half a dozen shalots, a single clove of garlic, and put them into a stewpan with a piece of butter, a bunch of parsley, and a bundle of sweet herbs; fry the whole for a few minutes, then add, very gradually, 2 bottles of any light wine or of cider. Put in a handful of salt, two dozen of peppercorns, the same quantity of allspice, and a couple of cloves. Simmer the whole together for It hour, strain the liquor, and put it by for use. This marinade, if carefully strained after the fish has been taken out, will serve several times for the same purpose, adding a little water each time. Fish dressed in it should simmer very gently, or rather stew than boil, as it affords to mackerel, fresh herrings, perch, roach, and any of the small river fish, the ad- vantage of dissolving, or so thoroughly softening their bones as to render them more agreeable in eating. For large fish, they should be cut into steaks before being marinaded. Instead 01 the wine or cider, a quart of table-beer, a glass of soy, 1 of essence of anchovies, and 1 of ketchup, may be used ; or a pint of vinegar and these sauces, fennel, chives, thyme, and bay-leaves, may be added with the wine, cider, &c. Or, choose a kettle that will suit the size of the fish, into which put 2 parts water, 1 of light (not sweet) white wine, a good piece of butter, some stewed onions and carrots, pepper, salt, 2 or 3 cloves, and a good bunch of sweet herbs; simmer £ of an hour, let it become cold, then boil the fish therein. Serve with anchovy-sauce and a squeeze of lemon.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIY. 230 TURBOT. 241.—Boiled.—Let it be dried immediately after its being washed, for if left in the water it will become soft; see that the kettle be large enough to contain the fish without injury to its fins; rub the fish well with a lemon and a little salt; have ready hard water sufficient to thoroughly cover it; throw in salt in the proportion of 1 lb. to 6 quarts of water, with a little horseradish. Before putting the turbot into the kettle, make a cut down to the bone through the middle of the dark side, in order to prevent the skin from cracking, and see that the fishmonger has taken 2 joints out of the neck. Let it boil gently. If of a moderate size, about 8 lbs., it will take about 20 minutes. Slip the turbot, with the white side uppermost, upon a hot cloth doubled up on the centre of the dish, and serve it up with a garnish of scraped horseradish and parsley, with slices of lemon. The sauce should be made of lobster, with, if possible, the coral, or spawn. Shrimps are, however, sometimes substituted; and, in France, caper-sauce is the most usual. Cold boiled Turbot, eaten with oil and vinegar, or with a well-dressed salad, is excellent; and, in summer, the addition of a cucumber, whether the fish be hot or cold, is thought an improvement. Steived.—Cut a small fish into square pieces, flour and fry until it is brown; after which drain it from the fat upon a hah- sieve, and proceed as for stewed eels. A la Creme.—The remains of a cold turbot may be warmed either in a white sauce maigre, a la Creme, or in Bechamel, or any of the rich meat sauces. The fish should be, in each of these modes, cut from the bones, stripped of the dark skin, but that of the silver side left on, and heated in either of these sauces, without being fried. Baked.—Take a small fish, dry and flour it, make a little butter hot, which brush thickly over the white side of the fish; sprinkle it well with pepper and salt; butter a baking-dish, lay on the fish with the white side uppermost, bake for about i an hour. For sauce, a little melted butter and the gravy from the fish. BRILL 242.—Is a fish so much resembling turbot in appearance asSALT-WATER FISH. 231 Chap. XIV.] to be not unfrequently passed off for it, and, if firm, it may deceive many who are not good judges ; but it is more fre- quently of a woolly nature, and far inferior in value. It is narrower and thinner than turbot, seldom weighing more than 10 lbs. ; it requires scaling on both sides, and is without those thorny spines which are found on the dark side ol the turbot. It is in season at the same time, and may be dressed in the same manner ; it is sometimes served without the accompani- ment of lobster-sauce; sauce made of crabs is preferred by many persons. JOHN DORY 243. —Is in season from summer until the close of autumn, at which period it is in the greatest perfection ; it is a scarce fish, bearing as high a price in London as the turbot. The skin bears a slime which should be scraped otf, or it will impart a disagreeable odour to the dory when brought to table. It is very firm, eating much like the claw of lobster, and is usually plain boiled, but may be dressed in either of the modes above described: if boiled, it should be served with Dutch sauce, though anchovy, shrimp, or caper sauce will be found very delicate. A dory of 5 to 6 lbs. will take about 20 minutes from the time of putting into cold water until done. Baked.—Proceed as for turbot baked, sprinkling some chopped parsley over the fish, and serve with Dutch sauce round. Broiled.—Dry, flour, butter, and season some small dories, cut some papers to fit them, screw up the edges tight, and ‘ broil; serve with cold butter, or melted butter in a boat. PLAICE 244. —Comes into season about May, and lasts throughout the remainder of the year; it is the largest of the flounder tribes and grows to the size of 6 to 8 lbs., though half that weight is more common. If in good condition, the appear- ance of the pale side should have a slight reddish tinge, the body should be tolerably thick and firm, and the eyes bright. It is, however, in very little estimation, and of so watery a nature, that it is usual to cut them in two, and wrap them in a towel with a heavy weight upon it to extract the fluid; the fish is then sprinkled with a little salt and hung up for some hours to dry, and never skinned. When plain boiled, it isMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIY. 232 served with either parsley and butter or anchovy-sauce, and will only take a very few minutes in boiling. It is frequently cut in pieces and fried in bread-crumbs,- with plain melted butter for sauce. FLOUNDERS AND DABS 245.—Are best in the latter part of autumn, and the good- ness of their condition may be known in the same manner as plaic e. They are both sea and river fish. The Thames pro- duces a superior kind, considered as a delicacy when either plainly fried or dressed in butter, for they are seldom stewed and never boiled. Sauce of any kind is seldom used, and they are best eaten with only a squeeze of lemon. Cutlets of Soles. SOLES. 246.—Fried.—Take off the skin of the dark side, and allow that of the other side to remain. Fry them over a brisk fire; and when one side is done, turn it by sticking a fork in the head and putting a fish-slice under the tail. A sole of ? lb. weight will take 5 or 6 minutes for each side. Plain melted butter is the most usual sauce, as the guests may add what flavour they please from the fish-cruets. Cutlets.—Cut the sole in pieces crosswise, about an inch wide: dry, flour, egg, and crumb them; fry them crisply ; dish them up, putting fried parsley in the centre. Boiled. —The larger sort should always be used. Take off the black skin, leave on the other, and serve with the white skin upwards. Filleted.—Lay the sole on the dresser, cut off the head and the tail, draw the knife straight down on the bone, then in- cline the knife on one side, and cover with fine forcemeat spread on one side, then skewer round, and fry either with crumbs of bread or in batter. Stewed.—For dressing a large sole perhaps the better mode is, after frying, to stew it in port-wine and beef gravy, or strong veal bi'oth and white wine.SALT-WATER FISH. 233 Chap. XIV.] Baked.—Cut the sole in pieces as for cutlets; butter a pan, lay in the sole, dry, flour, and season it well; add an onion in slices, 2 bay-leaves, 12 corns of allspice, parsley, thyme, and 2 wine-glasses of white wine; bake the sole, thicken the sauce with flour and butter, and add a table- spoonful of capers whole.

Lay the rolls in a small earthen pan, beat an egg and wet them, then strew crumbs over, and put the remainder of the egg, with a little meat gravy, a spoonful of caper-liquor, an anchovy chopped fine, and some parsley chopped into the bottom of the pan ; cover it close, and bake in a slow oven till the fish is done enough.

To make meat stuffing for the above.—Pound cold beef, mutton, or veal, a little; then add some fat bacon that has been slightly fried, 2 small or button onions, a little garlic or shalot, parsley, anchovy, pepper, salt, and nutmeg ; pound all fine with a few crumbs, and bind it with 2 or 3 yolks of eggs. SKATE, THORNBACK, AND RAY, OR MAIDS, 247.—Grow to a large size, and are in the highest perfection during the autumn and winter. Ihey may be either broiled, or fried with egg and bread- crumbs ; or, if of a tolerable size, the parts usually eaten may be boiled, and the fins fried. The wings are previously skinned, cut into strips about 2 inches wide, and kept for 2 or 3 days in salt and water ; as being the best mode of extracting a raw kind of rankness that is often found in them when dressed too fresh. If kept until cold and eaten with oil and vinegar, or dressed in a marinade and served with crab-sauce, they have a good flavour. Crimped Skate, and Maids, should be hung 1 day at least before they are dressed ; and may be served either boiled or fried in crumbs, being first dipped in ego-.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIY. 234 HALIBUT; OR HOLIBUT, 24S.—Partakes somewhat of the flavour of the turbot, and grows to an enormous size, being sometimes caught weighing more than a cwt.; the best size is. however, from 20 to 40 lbs., as, if much larger, it is coarse. The most esteemed parts are the flakes over the fins, and the pickings about the head; but on account of its great bulk it is commonly cut up and sold in collops, or in pieces of a few lbs. weight, at very reasonable rates. A small one cut in thin slices and crimped is very good eating. To collop Halibut.—Cut the fish into nice cutlets, of about an inch thick, and fry them ; then put them into a broth made of the bones, 4 onions, a stick of celery, and a bundle of sweet herbs, boiled together for 4 an hour. Strain this broth, thicken it, and stew the fish for 4 an hour, adding salt, pepper, a grating of nutmeg, and pounded mace, a spoonful of soy or fish-sauce, and half that quantity of lemon-juice, with a little shred lemon-peel. Or :—The collops may be fried in batter, or with beaten eggs and crumbs of bread; or if made into cutlets, cut quite thin, and fried in sweet oil, -without egg and bread-crumbs, are very good if eaten with sauce a la Tartare. To stew the Head, of Halibut.—Put a pint of beer, or any kind of wine, a few anchovies, an onion stuck with cloves, a bunch of sweet herbs, and some pepper, into a stewpan; fill it nearly with water, though ale, without water, is used by many good cooks, and stew it for an hour: then strain it, and put in the head of a halibut, stew it till tender ; when done enough, thicken the gravy with butter and flour, add a little fish-sauce, and serve it up with forcemeat-balls made of a part of the fish, pounded, and rolled up with crumbs of bread, thyme, marjoram, and nutmeg, bound together with the yolk of an egg. If the fish has been stewed in plain water, a glass of wine should then be added to the sauce. CODFISH, HAKE, AND LING. 249.—There are various species of these fish caught upon our coasts, and salted, but the cod most commonly brought fresh to the London market is chiefly found on the Dogger-bank. Hake and ling, though both good fish, are seldom used by235 Chap. XIV.] SALT-WATER FISH. any but the lower orders. They are, however, all of the same species, weight, and time of coming into season. They may also be dressed in the same manner as halibut. Codfish reaches to a very large size—30 lbs. being not an unusual weight, though 15 to 20 lbs. is a more general average, and the nearer the fish is to that weight, the better will it be found ; those much smaller being frequently of a flabby, watery nature, as “ codlings,” which are seldom worth eating. They are in season from the beginning of October till the middle of March, but are in the highest perfection about Christmas, at which time the females are full of roe, which they spawn some time in February, soon after which they begin to decline and become emaciated. Some people boil the whole fish at once ; but a large head and shoulders contain all the fish that is proper to be helped ; the thinner part being overdone and tasteless before the thick is ready. Cod's Head and Shoulders.—The fish will eat much finer by having a little salt rubbed down the bone and along the thick part, even if it be eaten the same day. Tie it up with several folds of broad tape to bind the head and prevent the cheeks from breaking, then lay the fish on the fish-plate, put it on the fire in cold water to completely cover it: throw in a handful of salt with a glass of vinegar and some horse- radish. Let the water be kept only just on the boil till the fish is done, which, if of a good average size, will take about i an hour, and may be known by lifting the fish-plate, and trying with a fish-slice whether the meat can be easily separated from the backbone. It the cod be crimped it will take less time than if dressed in its solid state, but it should then be put into hot water. The spawn and liver will take more time in boiling than the fish. When ready for the table, garnish with a large quantity of double parsley, lemon, horse- radish, and the milt, roe, and liver : if with smelts, be careful that no steam from the boiled fish hangs about the fish, or the beauty of the smelts will be taken off', as well as their flavour. Serve with plenty of oyster-sauce, or, if that be not attainable, muscle or cockle flavoured with a glass of wine ; or else anchovy. Cod’s Head roasted.—Boil the fish little more than half the time; then carefully strip off the skin, dredge it well withMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIY. 236 flour and set it before a brisk fire, baste it all the time with butter until it froths ; then, when the froth begins to rise, throw over it some very fine white bread-crumbs ; and when of a fine brown, dish it up with a garnish of lemon cut in slices, scraped horseradish, and barberries, with the roe and liver cut in slices, and a few small fried fish or fried oysters laid round it. Stuffed.—Cut the head with a part of the shoulders, and take as much of the tail as will fill the head, then tie up both at the mouth and shoulders with packthread ; make a brown sauce with beef-soup and a little strong ale, season it with a spoonful of ketchup, some salt, and cayenne pepper; then put in the head and stew it over a slow fire. When ready, add a glass of wine and a little lemon-juice. Tail of Codfish.—The lower parts near the tail are generally cut from the head and separately dressed, in which case the best mode is either to fry it of a fine brown, with sliced onions, and stew it with a good white gravy, a little curry-powder, a bit of butter and flour, and 3 or 4 spoonfuls of rich cream ; or cut it into cutlets and plainly broil them upon the gridiron, with oysters to surround them, and without any other sauce than melted butter; they are still better when done as veal cutlets, either with or without oysters. To bake Codfish.—Butter a pan, lay the fish in it with a bundle of sweet herbs, an onion stuck with 6 cloves, a spoonful of black and white pepper, salt, and a quart of water: flour the fish, stick it over with pieces of butter, and add to it rasp- ings of bread. When sufficiently baked, take out the fish carefully, strain the gravy, thicken it, and add to it a pint of shrimps, 4 pint of oysters, a spoonful of essence of anchovies, and a glass of Harvey or Reading sauce ; warm all together, and pour it round the fish ; garnish witli lemon, crisped parsley, and fried bread, or paste. Codlings are very good dressed in this manner. Codfish au gratin.—This is the best mode of using the remains of a dressed codfish. Put some cold oyster-sauce at the bottom of a pie-dish, then a layer of the codfish (seasoned with pepper, salt, and an atom of nutmeg), with any of the liver and sound that remains ; then repeat the layers of sauce and fish until the dish is full; cover it with bread-crumbs, sprinkle a little butter over, and bake for about 4 an hour.237 Chap. XIV.] SALT-WATER FISH. To steio Codfish.—Cut the cod into slices, season them with pepper and salt, put them into a stewpan with t pint of water, some good gravy, i pint of wine, the juice of i a lemon, a dozen or two of oysters with their liquor, a piece of butter rolled in flour, and 2 or 3 blades of mace. When the fish is sufficiently stewed, which will be in i of an hour, serve it up with the sauce. Any kind of fish-sauce may be substituted for the wine, and a variety given by employing anchovies instead of oysters. A la Provencale.—Having soaked the fish until it is tender, mince it up with a small quantity of garlic, scraped horse- radish, and parsley; then put it into a stewpan, with white wine and oil of equal amount to cover it, put it over a mode- rate fire, and keep constantly shaking it until the ingredients are thoroughly mingled to the thickness of cream. In England, where garlic and oil are so generally disliked, the former may be omitted, and white sauce or cream may be substituted for oil; but if wine be used, it must be carefully mixed to avoid the curdling of the cream. Cod Sounds may be dressed in various ways, and form a good maigre dish Soak them in warm water a few hours, then scrape and clean; boil them in milk and water till tender; serve them in a napkin with egg-sauce. Dress cod-tongues in the same way. En ragout.—Prepare as above; then stew them in white gravy seasoned ; cream, butter, and a small quantity of flour added before you serve, gently boiling it up. A bit of lemon- peel, nutmeg, and the least pounded mace, should give the flavour. Or:—Wash 3 large sounds nicely, and boil in milk and water, but not too tender: when cold, put a forcemeat of chop- ped oysters, crumbs of bread, a bit of butter, nutmeg, pepper, salt, and the yolks of 2 eggs; spread it thin over the sounds, and roll up each, skewering it; dust a little flour over, and roast them in a tin oven slowly. When done enough, pour over them a fine oyster-sauce. Serve for side or corner dish at the first course. SALT FISH, 250. If very dry, should be soaked for several hours in soft water then soaked again, and afterwards brushed withf 238 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIY. r / a hard brush. Under this treatment the most stubborn fish will swell considerably if boiled gently : two separate soakings are better than one, however continuous, since the alternate expansion and contraction loosens the fibres of the fish, and occasions it to come off in finer flakes. Boiled.—Cut a nice square piece of codfish, after soaking put it on in soft water and boil it very gently; lay a napkin over the dish, place the fish in the centre, garnish with parsnips cut in moderate pieces, eggs cut in quarters, and parsley; fold the 4 corners of the napkin over the fish and send to table; egg-sauce in a boat. A salted sound, soaked for 24 hours and boiled in milk and water, is an admirable addition. Or:—Lay the piece you mean to dress all night in water with a glass of vinegar; boil it enough, then break it into flakes on the dish; warm it up with cream and a large piece of butter rubbed with a bit of flour, and serve it as above with egg-sauce. Fricasseed.—Salt fish that has been boiled and left until cold is an excellent dish when warmed ; break it into flakes, and put it into a pan with sauce thus made: beat boiled parsnips in a mortar, then add to it a cup of cream, a good piece of butter rolled in flour, a little white pepper, and 4 a teaspoonful of mustard, all simmered together; keep the fish no longer on the fire than to become hot, but not boil. Or :—Shred the fish into very small pieces, break up potatoes which have been already boiled, and put them along with the fish under the rolling-pin, so as to reduce the whole nearly to a paste. Then mix with it some hard-boiled eggs, minced fine; put the whole into a stewpan to warm with a good piece of butter, and send it up with egg-sauce. Should you prefer not to mix them, build a wall of mashed potatoes, put the fish in the centre, and heat in a Dutch oven; if you have a parsnip, mash it, and add it to the mass. In Spain, baccalcio, or dried fish, is generally minced, and fried in oil with eggs, and although a homely, is an excellent dish. HADDOCK. 251.—-They are in season from June till January, and their condition may be tested in the same manner as cod; but they should be immediately gutted, much below the vent, and care-Chap. XIV.] SALT-WATER, FISH. V *— fullv cleaned, to prevent the rancidity which would otherwise be occasioned to their flavour by the oiliness of the liver, if it be allowed to remain in the body. The gills and eyes should also be taken out, and a very little salt put into the body, which should be hung up for a short time to dry. Their aver- age weight rarely exceeds 4 to 5 lbs., but the larger they are the better they will generally be found, their firmness being the greatest merit in their quality, and depending much upon their size. The fish is very delicate in flavour, and is most usually left unskinned : plainly boiled, very fast, for about £ of an hour, or 20 minutes if it be large. It may be served with parsley and butter, or oyster-sauce. To fry.—If of a very small size, they may be turned round with their tails run through their jaws; but this cannot be done when they are large; they are in that case either cut in slices or filleted, and fried with crumbs of bread and egg. To broil.—The fish is either scored or skinned, and split up, brushed over with a feather dipped in oil, peppered and salted, and laid whole upon the gridiron, without either crumbs of bread or egg, and eaten, if it he fresh, with only a squeeze of lemon, or some anchovy-sauce; if dried and salted, as the Findhorn, or, as they are commonly called “ Finnan had- dock,” they are merely used as a breakfast relish, without any sauce or condiment but a spoonful of mustard. To bake.—The scales should be scraped off, but the tail and head must not be removed, though the spinal bone should be taken out and the body stuffed with any approved forcemeat. The Scottish mode of baking is :—Take 2 good-sized had- docks, clean, and wipe them well in a cloth, but do not wash them ; keep the breasts as whole as possible. Strew salt over them, and lay them on a board for several hours; then wipe the salt from them, cut off the heads and fins, cut the skin through down the back, and take it off neatly, being careful to keep the fish whole. Beat up the yolks of 3 eggs, dip each in the egg, have ready some bread-crumbs, mixed with pep- per, salt, and chopped parsley ; roll the fish in the crumbs, and stuff the heads and breasts with oysters chopped, but not too small, and bread-crumbs blended with an egg. Butter a dish lay the fish upon it, stick pieces of butter upon each, and bake them. For sauce, take a pint of veal gravy, the same quantity of cream, mix 2 tablespoonfuls of flour in a little of the cream,240 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIV. cold, and boil all together until it is smooth ; serve with a blade of mace, a little nutmeg, salt, and a whole onion. When about to dish, take out the onion, and add a glass of wine, with the yolk of an egg well beaten : lay the heads of the fish at each end ; pour the sauce over, and garnish with lemon. To stew, on a maigre day.—Trim the haddock, by cutting off the head, tail, and fins, and taking out the bones. Put these trimmings in a quart of water, with a few peppercorns and an onion, and let them stew very slowly for i an hour. Then strain off the gravy, flour the fish well and fry it; after which, return it to the stock, adding cayenne pepper, some acid sauce, and ketchup, or essence of anchovy; and serve it up in a deep dish. It is thus an economical dish ■ and, if the gravy be made rich, it will be found very good. The Scotch dish called “ Cropped Heads.”—Parboil the roe; mix it with double its quantity of pounded hard biscuit, salt, pepper, and a beaten egg; stuff haddocks’ heads with this mixture, and fry them in beef dripping. Prepare a sauce of beef gravy, fried onions and flour, a teacupful of ketchup, the same of pickled muscles, and add it to the heads; simmer 15 minutes. If a large dish be wanting, serve 2 boiled haddocks in the middle. WHITING. 252. Their highest season is during the first 3 months of the year, when they spawn, but soon recover, and remain in good order throughout the remainder of the twelvemonth. To fry.—Clean, skin, and dry them in a cloth ; fasten their tails in their mouths; brush them over with egg, and cover, them with fine bread-crumbs mixed with a little flour; fry them a light-brown, and serve them with good melted butter. For invalids they are sometimes plainly boiled with parsley and butter. Or:—Fillet 5 whitings, cut each fillet in half, Hour them, egg and crumb them very carefully ; fry them with a little fresh butter, dish them up, and put a good oyster-sauce in the centre of them. This is a most artistic mode of serving whiting. GURNARDS, OR GURNETS, 253. —Consist of 4 or 5 different kinds, of which the Piper is that distinguished by fishmongers as the best, though, toChap. XIV.] SALT-WATER FISH. 241 the public, the whole species are known under the name of “ Gurnets." Their flesh is white, exceedingly firm, and shells out into snowy flakes of a remarkably agreeable flavour; they may also be kept, without salt, for several days in very hot weather: yet they are little known in the London market. From 3 to 4 lbs. is a good average weight, but the head is nearly as large as the rest of the body, which tapers from the shoulder very slenderly to the tail. Their freshness may be tested in the same manner as cod. To boil.—Plain boil in salt and water over a gentle fire ; serve with plain butter or crab-sauce. To fry.—Skin the fish, cut off the head, tail, and fins, and fry the fillets in hot boiling oil or lard : drain upon a colan- der, or a folded napkin. They may be eaten with plain butter, seasoned to the palate, but crab-sauce is considered the best. To bake.—Clean, scale, and take out their insides ; then cut off their heads; rub a deep dish with butter, take some parsley, chives, and sweet herbs, mince them fine, season with pepper and salt; put a layer of the mixture at the bottom of the dish, then put in the fish, and cover them with the same seasoning ; put some small pieces of butter on the fish, and let it melt be- fore the fire: lastly, cover them with bread-crumbs grated very fine, and put them in the oven. The sauce to be made as follows—Take mushrooms, truffles, chives, and parsley; shred them fine, season with pepper and salt; moisten it with some fresh broth, and let it simmer over a gentle fire till the herbs are sufficiently done ; thicken it with a piece of butter kneaded in flour, and when the fish is baked of a fine brown pour the sauce into a dish and lay the gurnet round it. MULLET. 254.—There are 2 sorts of mullet, the red and the grey; the former bred in the sea, and the latter in fresh water; both of small size, and coming into season during the heat of summer. The red mullet is, however, preferred, both for the delicacy of its flesh and the peculiar flavour of its liver, in consequence of which it is never gutted; from which similarity in point of dressing and estimation of the trail, it has got the name of “sea-woodcock.” Being only found on our southern coasts, and in hot weather, as well as requiring to be eaten quite I fresh, they are scarce and dear in the London market. The uMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIV. 242 Jersey mullet is the best, often growing to the weight of 2 to 3 lbs. To broil.—The red mullet is never boiled, and, although some- times baked and fried, the best and most usual mode of dressing them is to broil them a la Maintenon; take out the gills and wipe them with a dry cloth from the head to the tail; flour them; take a half-sheet of letter-paper, butter it well, season it with pepper and salt, rub a little butter over the mullet and season it; envelop it in the paper, fasten the ends securely; broil for 20 minutes; serve in the paper. They are served without any other sauce than plain melted butter, to preserve the haut-gout of the liver, although that cannot be easily done without also retaining the other parts of the gut. To fry Mullet.—’Vn excellent plan is that of drawing the whole gut, and boiling the liver separately in such a small quantity of water as would be required for the making of the melted butter, “ so that, should the livers boil to pieces in the process of dressing, you still retain all their valuable qualities.” Mullets may in this manner be dressed with sweet herbs, bread- crumbs, and egg, and fried. To bake.—Only cut out the gills, without meddling with the liver and trail; bake them for about J an hour in a mode- rately heated oven; season them well, and cover them with chopped mushrooms, shalots, chives, or truffles, together with parsley and sweet herbs of any sort; put them into a dish of brown gravy, with a glass or two of either white or red wine, basting them frequently, and, when done, serving them with a squeeze of lemon. In this way they are peculiarly fine. To stew.—Put the mullet (say 3) into a shallow stewpan, with a large wineglass of sherry and as much broth, with an onion, carrot, and turnip sliced, 2 bay-leaves, a blade of mace, a little parsley and thyme, 2 slices of lemon, and a little^ sea- soning ; let them stew gently for 20 minutes; dish them up; strain the sauce; thicken it with* flour and butter; pour it over the fish quite hot. SEA-BREAM 255.—Are generally thought to be bred both in the sea and in fresh water, although they are of different species. The sea- bream, although somewhat larger than the red mullet, yet so much resembles it in appearance that it may be dressed in the243 SALT-WATER FISH. Chap. XIV.] same manner, and is often passed off as such by the fishmongers. It is in season at the same time as the mullet, and is plentiful on the same coasts, but is far from being so good. Chads are a smaller species of sea-bream, and may be dressed in precisely the same way. MACKEREL 256.—Are so well known, and in such general use as an es- teemed fish, that any description is unnecessary. Their season is the months of May, June, and July, after which time they spawn and lose condition ; but some have an after season, about October, when they recover their flesh and flavour. They are so tender that they keep worse than any other kind of fish, for which reason they are allowed to be hawked on the Sunday ; for if not dressed within 48 hours after being caught they be- come putrid. Their freshness may be ascertained not only by the signs common to all fish, of fulness in the eye and glossi- ness of the skin, but also by the appearance of the bars on the back, which should be distinctly marked black, those of the male being nearly straight, whilst those of the female are waving; an observation worth attending to, as the flesh of the male is better than that of the female. Their condition should also be looked to, for, if the body be not full and deep from the shoulder downwards, it is a proof that the fish has been diseased, or lost its roe as “ shotten mackerel,” which is always ill- tasted. They are delicate, though not rich in flavour. They may be dressed in various ways, but plainly boiled is the most usual, and considered by many good judges as the best mode of preserving their flavour. To boil Mackerel.—They should be carefully cleaned both inside and out; then washed in vinegar and water, and left to hang a little to dry before being put into the fish-kettle. A handful of salt should be put into the water, which should be at first cold, and only allowed to boil gently from 15 to 20 minutes, though some prefer having the water boiling hot. The fish should be watched about that time, as u when the eye starts and the tail splits they are done, and should be imme- diately taken up; if left in the water they will break.” The most customary sauce is that of fennel, which has partly superseded the gooseberry, but parsley and butter is still in use. Or :—Mackerel may be- boiled in a marinade made as follows:—Take, with some weak broth, 2 tablespoonfuls of xi 2244 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIV. vinegar, a bundle of sweet herbs, a few small onions, or a large one stuck with a clove, pepper, and salt; boil it together for an hour ; then boil the fish in this gravy : take them out when ready, strain the liquor, and thicken it; make it green with chopped parsley and fennel; add a teaspoonful of any kind of fish-sauce, and send it to table. To souse.—If kept until cold, to be eaten on the following day, they should be soused in equal proportions of vinegar and water sufficient to cover them, and containing some whole black pepper, mace, and a few bay-leaves. Or:—Clean, bone, and cut the fish into fillets, and season them well. To 6 large mackerel put an ounce of ground pepper in equal parts of white and red, 4 cloves, a saltspoonful of allspice, 3 or 4 blades of mace pounded, and a tablespoonful of salt. Hub the mixture well in, scoring the fish in order that it may be thoroughly spread. Fry them in oil till they are brown; when cold, put them into a stone jar, and covey them with vinegar. To broil.—Split them down the back, rub the inside with a little vinegar sprinkled with pepper and salt, flour them, broil on a quick fire, and serve them up with melted butter, parsley, fennel, or lemon-sauce. Or, if intended for breakfast, send up the fish plabily broiled without condiments or sauce, and merely rubbed, when done, with a bit of butter. To fry.—They should be cut open, and prepared for dress- ing and serving up in the same manner as for broiling; but it is as well to have the back-bone taken out, and the fish pow- dered with biscuit-dust and finely-minced herbs, as if intended for fillets ; then put into the frying-pan, with plenty of boiling oil, lard, or beef dripping. For baking, the spinal or back-bone may be taken out, and the fish stuffed with forcemeat, or in the same manner as gur- net, but without taking off the head. Pepper the inside well, lay butter between, flour and butter the outside, roast in a Dutch oven, and serve them up with lemon-juice squeezed over them, and a thick sauce of chopped fennel, parsley, and butter. To stew.—Split, bone, and cut the fish in quarters, and broil them until they are nearly half done: then put them aside; take a pint of good gravy, with a little chopped fennel, pars- ley, and slialot, a teaspoonful of essence of anchovy, a glass ot ketchup, and a piece of butter rolled in flour; stir this overChat*. XIV.] 245 SALT-WATER FISH. 3 j the fire until it is of a proper thickness ; season it with cayenne pepper and salt, then put in the fish; stew all very gently until it is done, and add a tablespoonful of thickening and a glass of port wine the last thing. Fillets of Mackerel.—Bone one or more mackerel; take the fish off in fillets lengthwise, turning them round. Chop fennel and parsley, and put it in a stewpan with well-seasoned veal gravy, or some fish-broth if on maigre day; lay in the fish, and let it stew 10 minutes. Then take up the fillets, dish them, and thicken the sauce, adding to it the juice of a lemon ; pour it round the fish, and serve up with a garnish of pickles. Mackerel a la mditre d’hotel.—Split 3 mackerel, cut off the heads and tails, and take out the bone. Broil them nicely a fine brown. Boil a dozen small silver onions ; scald a young cucumber, a bunch of parsley, and a bunch of fennel; chop the 2 latter, and cut the cucumber into dice. Season the whole, and put them into a small saucepan with a piece of butter; when the butter is melted, lay the vegetables on the fish, and squeeze the juice of 2 lemons over them. The soft roes are sometimes parboiled in a little vinegar and water and salt, being afterwards replaced in the boiled fish, as it requires less boiling than the roe; but this is very seldom done, and then only for the purpose of frying them as a gar- nish for the boiled fish; but they form a very nice dish, if there be a sufficient number, when dressed, cut into dice, thrown into a little white sauce, and patties filled with them. HERRINGS.—E. R. 257.—This fish is in season from some time in May to the end of October. If good, their gills are of a fine red, and the eyes bright, as is likewise the whole fish, which must be stiff and firm: their firmness, however, may be preserved, and the oiliness prevented, by sprinkling salt upon them, if required to be kept more than a day. Fresh herrings are usually broiled over a good, but not a fierce cinder fire, and will be improved in delicacy if steeped in milk for a couple of hours before being dressed, they being properly gutted, wiped dry, floured, and put upon a hot grid- iron ; they must, however, be narrowly watched by the cook ; they will be done enough in a few minutes. The heads and tails are sometimes cut off as a point of neatness, but imma-246 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIY. terial as regards the cookery; they should be served quite hot, with plain melted butter, and are usually eaten with mustard. To fry.—Scale and prepare the herrings as above, but take out the soft roes and fry them separately, of a light brown, to form a garnish, and the whole well drained from the fat in which they have been dressed. Notwithstanding the prejudice against the union of two such strongly flaVoured viands, onions are frequently fried along with fresh herrings, the onions being shred finely and put under the fish, or, when peeled, the layers are separately unrolled, and placed over and around them. An excellent and very economical dish is also made by frying them with sliced, or baking them with whole-boiled potatoes. To hake.—Wash and drain without wiping them; season with allspice in fine powder, salt, and a few whole cloves; lay them in a pan with plenty of black pepper, an onion, and a few bay-leaves. Add vinegar and small-beer in equal quan- tities, enough to cover them. Put paper over the pan, and bake for a couple of hours in a slow oven. If you like, throw saltpetre over them the night before, to make them look red. Gut, but do not open them. Herrings are very seldom boiled, but when that is done they should be served with something more savoury than melted butter. In France, capers are commonly added, and tomata sauce is not unusual. To smoke.—Clean, and lay them in salt with a little salt- petre 1 night; then hang them on sticks through the eyes, in a row. Have ready an old cask, in which put some sawdust, and in the midst of it a heater red-hot; fix the sticks over the smoke, and let them remain 24 hours. Or, if you have a kitchen in which wood is burnt, hang the herrings in strings across the chimney. To pot.—Take some of the above, or a dozen of recently cured bloaters ; soak them for a short time in scalding water, and strip off the skins; cut off the heads and tails, take out the bones, cut the fish into pieces, and put them into a stewpan with a good lump of fresh butter, a little mace and either cayenne or white pepper. Set this on a slow fire to sim- I mer until quite tender, or for some hours in a moderately heated oven ; then pound the whole in a mortar, make it into I247 Chap. XIV.] SALT-WATER FISH. a puree of a good consistence ; put it into pots, over which run some clarified butter, and cover them with bladder. RED HERRINGS. Red herrings are dried when salted, but those cured in Ireland, Scotland, and Holland are packed and left in the pickle for exportation. Dutch herrings have acquired the highest reputation in consequence of their superior delicacy. They are brought to London in small casks, containing only a dozen each, and in Holland are always eaten raw, though English prejudice spoils them by broiling. They are so highly cured as to make the fish quite transparent; are generally steeped for an hour or two in cold milk, scored across, and form an excellent relish. 258.—Choose those that are large and moist; cut them open and pour some boiling small-beer over them to soak t an hour ; drain them dry, and make them just hot through before the fire; then rub some cold butter over them, and serve. Instead of butter, a little salad oil will add to the richness; but it must be dropped on while before the fire, and in the smallest quantity. A very usual mode is, however, to split them open without any soaking, and hang them separately on the hooks of a cheese-toaster, by which means the soft roe will be browned. Some of them will have hard roes, in which case the belly should be carefully opened, and a little butter inserted between the lobes, but again close up the belly to more readily melt the butter. The “ Yarmouth bloaters,” . whether arising from any improvement in their quality during their passage to London, or from the mode of curing them, are considered the best. PILCHARDS, 259.—Though more oily than herrings, yet resemble them both in ta-ste and appearance: they also come into season about the same time, and may be dressed, smoked, and potted in the same manner; but, if not speedily consumed, they become rancid, and are, therefore, when fresh, seldom brought to London. They are caught on the coasts of Devon and Cornwall in large quantities, and, when salted, are chiefly ex- ported to the Mediterranean.248 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIV. SPRA TS 260.—May be smoked, dried, and potted like herrings, but the most common mode of cooking is to fry, or rather to broil, them on a close-barred gridiron, as their oiliness, when fried, increases the rankness of their flavour. They ought not to be gutted with the knife, but, if the head be cut off, the gut may be drawn out at the same time. They come into the London market on Lord Mayor’s Day, and go out of season at the close of January. Most people eat them with salt alone, but a little lemon-juice, with a few grains of cayenne pepper, will be found an improvement. As they must be eaten quite hot, and are by many consi- dered very nice, yet, as their odour in the parlour is disagree- able, it is not unusual among amateurs to have them at supper “ as a sprat feast,” at the kitchen fire.249 Chap. XV.] FRESH-WATER FISH. CHAPTER XV. FRESH-WATER FISH. 261. —Fresh-water Fish are equally nutritious with those of the sea; they are much lighter as food, and therefore easier of digestion ; they are, however, more watery, and it is requisite to use salt, in order to extract the watery particles. Every sort of fresh-water fish ought, therefore, as soon as killed and cleaned, to have salt well rubbed inside and outside, and should be allowed so to remain for some time before it is cooked, when it should be well washed out with pure spring water, and wiped thoroughly dry witli a clean cloth. If bred in ponds, it often acquires a muddy smell and taste ; to take off which, soaking in strong salt and water, or, if of a size to bear it, scalding in the same, will have the proper effect. SALMON 262. —Has ever been looked upon as the most pre-eminent of all fresh-water, and indeed, by some, of every species of fish ; but those who have lived in the neighbourhood of salmon fisheries can alone have tasted this monarch of the floods in fitll perfection. It should be dressed before it has lost a tide. Families who purchase a whole salmon, and like it quite fresh, should parboil the portion not required for the day’s consumption, and lay it aside in the liquor, boiling up the whole together when wanted; by which means the curd will be set, and the fish be equally good on the following day. If new, and in season, the flesh is of a fine red (the gills parti- cularly), the scales bright, and the whole fish stiff. When in greatest perfection, there is a whiteness between the flakes, which gives great firmness; by keeping, this melts down, and the fish becomes more rich, but suffers somewhat in flavour. The Thames salmon bears the highest price, both in conse- quence of its generally acknowledged superiority, and its great scarcity; we have known 12s. a pound paid for it when in theMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XY. 250 height of the season: that caught in the Severn is next in goodness, and is even preferred by some; but the Christchurch salmon is by many thought to be the best. The chief supply to the London market is from Scotland. The Dutch salmon is the largest that comes to market, and in the early season fetches a great price on account of its size, some of the fish weighing 40 lbs. each. It requires dressing the day it is re- ceived from Holland, as it otherwise becomes very oily and soft. Those with small heads and thick in the neck are best, and the larger the fish the richer they are. The season in which salmon is the finest and most plentiful is from the middle of May to the close of September; but, even in the same waters, there is often several months’ differ- ence in their relative conditions; depending chiefly on the time of their leaving the salt water, and how far they are ad- vanced towards their spawning-time: when the rudiments of the spawn first appear, the fish is in the best condition, and deteriorates considerably in goodness as it advances. When out. of condition it loses its silvery cast on the sides, which then acquire a copper-coloured tinge, and the upper part a dirty grey; whilst in the male, or “ kipper,” the cheeks become marked with orange-coloured stripes, and the lower jaw grows out to a considerable size, forming in part a groove to the upper. When thus thoroughly out of season, the fish is no longer in a fit state to be eaten. 263.— To boil Salmon.—Salmon is dressed in various ways, but chiefly boiled in large pieces of a few pounds’ weight. The middle piece is considered, if not the richest, yet the most sightly; then that adjoining the jowl; the tail part, though nearly as"good, being usually kept for steaks. It requires great attention, and the boiling must be checked more than once: a piece of 4 to 5 lbs. will take nearly an hour, but if double that weight will not require more than 20 minutes beyond that time, and if crimped, still less will be sufficient: let it, how- ever, boil slowly, in the hardest water, on a strainer placed in a large fish-kettle, and be thoroughly done, for nothing is more disgusting than fish that is under-cooked; skim it well, or the colour will be bad ; the moment it is ready, lift up the strainer and rest it across the kettle, that the fish may drain; cover it with a thick cloth. Such is the English mode of boiling salmon; but in Scot- land two other methods are adopted which merit notice:251 Chap. XV.] FRESH-WATER FISH. 1st. The Benvich receipt.—“ The tail of the salmon is cut off below the last fin, the fish is then cut up the back, keeping the bone on one side, and divided into pieces of h lb. each, the blood being well washed out in cold water, but the scales not to be removed. A pickle is then made of salt and water strong enough to bear an egg, and when boiling the fish to be put in and boiled very quickly for 15 minutes.” 2nd. The Aberdeen Fisherman’s receipt.—“ When the water is hot put salt into it and stir it well; taste it; when strong enough to force you to cast it from your mouth, it will do ; when the water boils, put in the fish ; when it boils again, give 20 minutes for a salmon, and 16 for a grilse. When cut in slices an inch thick, let them boil 10 minutes. Serve in a tureen of the liquor the fish was boiled in.” The salmon which is only left to boil 20 minutes can, how- ever, be only salmon-peel; which is a small species that never reaches to more than a few pounds in weight. It is, there- fore, commonly boiled whole, and dressed in the form of the letter S, which is done by passing a large needle through the eyes of the fish, and tying the string under the jaw, to bend back the jowl; then running the needle through the thick part of the body, and tying it tight to the end of the tail: the eyes being sometimes taken out, and the cavities filled up with black truffles. The usual sauce is that of lobster or shrimp; and when those cannot be had, anchovy. The custom of sending up rich sauces is unknown in salmon countries; a little lemon- •pickle or white-wine vinegar being thought quite sufficient, added to melted butter. When in season, thinly sliced cucum- bers, with oil and vinegar, are also a customary accompani- ment, as well as scraped horseradish and parsley; but t.h(?y should be put on a separate plate, and not served, as common cooks constantly do, as a garnish round the dish: nor should any species of vegetable be ever served except with salt-fish. To preserve the remains of cold salmon, save a part of the water in which the salmon lias been boiled, mix it with half the quantity of vinegar, boil it up with whole pepper, and when cold pour it over the fish ; but do not keep it longer than 2 or 3 days. To broil.—Cut slices an inch thick ; put them into buttered paper and place them upon the gridiron; or the paper may beMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XY. 252 omitted, and the slices broiled upon the gridiron without any further preparation or other care than slightly rubbing the slices with a bit of fresh butter wrapped in gauze: sprinkle freely with salt; they will be done in a few minutes, and should be served as hot as possible. Salmon cutlets should be cut from a piece of a split salmon ; cut them without bone about i inch thick, and rub them over with egg well beaten; season with pepper and salt, dip them in chopped herbs and bread-crumbs, fry them as you would a veal cutlet; serve with Indian-pickle sauce. Or:—Cut pieces t inch thick ; season them, put them in paper, and broil until hot through: serve with lemon only. This is usually eaten at breakfast. Or :—As in the Hebrew fashion, slice the salmon, and cover it with salt for 2 hours; then dry it, and brush it over with yolk of eggs. Fry it in oil, and serve it cold with salad. Any small pieces of salmon may be dressed with salad, or with salad-sauce. To bake.—Scale it, and take out the bone from the part to be dressed, but fill up the cavity with forcemeat, and bind the piece with tape. Then flour it, rub it with yolk of egg, and put it into a deep baking-dish, covering it very thickly with crumbs of bread, chopped parsley, and sweet herbs, together with shrimps, if they can be got, and put into the covering a few small bits of fresh butter ; place it in a Dutch oven, or, if already boiled and thus re-dressed, heat it only before the fire until browned. In the west of England salmon are often roasted whole in a cradle-spit, and thus dressed are very delicious. A Dutch oven is better adapted to a small bit. The piece roasted should be cut from the middle or tail, the jowl being, on account of the bones and mucilage, more fitted for boiling. Flour the fish well, and baste it with butter, serving it up with a garnish of lemon. It is most excellent when cold, and eaten with pepper and vinegar, being much richer than when boiled. It may be skinned, rubbed over with yolk of egg and bread-crumbs; and this is a good way of dressing small pieces. A la maitre d'hbtcl.—Make a good fish gravy, so strong that it will jelly ; add to it 2 large spoonfuls of lemon-pickle, and let it be well seasoned before it is strained; then slice theFRESH-WATER FISH. 253 Chap. XV.] salmon in pieces about an inch thick, squeeze lemon-juice over them, or pour vinegar upon the chopped fennel and parsley, in which they must be rolled very thickly, so as to appear quite green. Thicken the gravy with a little clarified butter, and stew the salmon gently until done. Serve up with green pickles. A la Genevoise.—Put into the fish-kettle as much broth and wine as will slowly stew a thick piece covered with chopped mushrooms, shalots or chives, parsley, and savoury herbs, all seasoned well, but moderately; when the stew is done, thicken with flour and butter, and add an anchovy. If made with veal or mutton broth, use white wine; but if of beef gravy, take port or claret. Or:—Carefully take off the skin, as its oiliness will give the fish a strong and disagreeable taste when cooked. Cut from the tail-piece slices about i inch thick, rub them with salt, and broil them over a clear fire of bright coals. Butter them, sprinkle them with cayenne pepper, and send them to table hot, garnished with sliced lemon, as lemon-juice is fre- quently squeezed over them when eaten. To dry Salmon.—Cut the fish down, take out the inside and roe, rub the whole with common salt after scaling it; let it hang 24 hours to drain. Pound 3 or 4 oz. of saltpetre, ac- cording to the size of the fish, 2 oz. of bay salt, and 2 oz. of coarse sugar; rub these, when mixed well, into the salmon, and lay it in a large dish or tray 2 days; then rub it well with common salt, and in 24 hours more it will be fit to dry; wipe it well after draining. Hang it either in a wood chimney or in a dry place, keeping it open with 2 small sticks. Dried salmon is eaten broiled in paper, and only just warmed through, egg-sauce and mashed potatoes with it; or it may be boiled, especially the bit next the head. To pot dressed or undressed Salmon.—If dressed, take the remains of that which is cold, pound and season it in the same manner as for an omelet, but leaving out the eggs, and making it into a paste with thick melted butter. If undressed, take a large piece, scale and wipe, but do not wash it; salt very well; let it lie till the salt is melted and drained from it, then season it with beaten mace, cloves, and whole pepper: lay in a few bay-leaves, put it close into a pan,MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XV. 2.54 cover it over with butter, and bake it in a slow oven for 2 or 3 hours; when well clone, drain it from the gravy, and take out the peppercorns, put it into the pots pressed closely down to keep it from the air, and, when cold, cover it with clarified butter. In this manner any firm fish may be potted; and if the coral of a lobster, with a little of the fish, or some bruised shrimps, be added, they will much improve its flavour and appearance. To collar Salmon.—Split such a part of the fish as may be sufficient to make a handsome roll, wash and wipe it, and having mixed salt, white pepper, pounded mace, cloves, and Jamaica pepper, in quantity to season it very high, rub it well both inside and out. Then roll it tight and bandage it; put as much water and vinegar as will cover it, and stew it with bay-leaves. Cover close and simmer till done enough; take off the scum, and again boil the liquor, but keep it when cold, as the collar may be preserved in it, and wiped dry when wanted. As an occasional dish for a slice at breakfast or luncheon, when eaten with lemon-juice or any acid sauce, it is very good, but not in such request as collared eel. To pickle Salmon.— The Newcastle method is—Put any quantity of salmon into an earthen jar, cover it with equal parts of good vinegar and water, add cayenne pepper and salt in proportion to the fish, and bake it in a moderate oven. This pickle will keep a long time, with the addition of a little fresh vinegar; and if mace or cloves be added, with a few bay-leaves laid in the mouth of the jar, it will be found an improve- ment. Trout may be preserved the same way. Fish, thus pickled, must not be washed previously, but rubbed with a dry cloth. Though in London always eaten cold, yet in Newcastle it is not unfrequently wanned up in its pickle-liquor. TROUT 264.—Are by many people thought to be a small kind of salmon, but, though much resembling it in outward appearance and delicacy of taste, they are of a distinct species, only inha- biting rivulets of running water, and never bred, as the salmon is, in the sea. They are very small, seldom exceeding 2 to 3 lbs., and more frequently not reaching more than f lb. in weight.FRESH-WATER FISH. Chap. XV.] 255 They come into season about the same time as the salmon, and when in high condition, during the height of summer, they present, besides the usual appearance of freshness in the eyes and gills, a silvery hue in the skin, while the flesh, when dressed, cuts into flakes of a tinge approaching to pink, and is justly esteemed a great delicacy. To bake.—Where there is an oven it is decidedly the best mode of dressing all the larger sort of fresh-water fish, and also the simplest. Dry the fish, lay them in a baking-dish, season with pepper and salt, and put a little butter on them ; bake them according to the size; add the juice that comes from the fish to some rather thick melted butter. To boil.—They should be wiped dry with a coarse towel, rubbed from head to tail, and boiled whole, putting them into cold water mixed with a small quantity of vinegar, into which should be also put some scraped horseradish; let them boil gradually for about 20 to 30 minutes, according to size, and take care not to break the skin; serve with plain melted butter. In White Sauce.—Boil the fish gently in as much water and light white wine, in equal quantities, as will only cover them. When done, keep them hot while you boil the liquor -with a bit of butter and a little flour. Meantime have ready beaten 2 eggs, with a spoonful of cold water, and pour them and the sauce to and fro at a little distance above the stove till of due thickness, and serve the fish in it, adding a little salt. | In Green Sauce.—Beat in a mortar I an anchovy, a table- spoonful of capers, 1 each of chives and parsley, previously minced, a good lump of butter, and a dessertspoonful of flour. When the trout is ready, keep it hot while this mixture is > I boiled with the liquor, in which serve it. To fry Trout.—Scale, gut, and clean them; take out the gills ; egg and crumb them ; then fry in lard or oil until of a light brown. Serve with anchovy-sauce and sliced lemon. In the Foreiyn Mode.—Cover the bottom of a small oval paper form with a few very thin slices of fat bacon ; cut down the back some nicely-washed small trout, and, having removed the bones, lay the fish open, flat upon the bacon; sprinkle with chopped parsley, pepper, salt, a little mace, and 2 cloves finely pounded. Bake i an hour in a quick oven, and serve in paper.256 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XV, Or .-—Take off the paper, leave out the bacon, and serve in a thick white fricassee-sauce, made of good veal broth and white wine, with capers. Trout is also good in scdacl-sauce, as thus:—Fry 2 or 3 middling-sized trout, lay them in a paper to remove the fat, and, when cold, serve in salad-sauce, with minced chervil and chives. THE PARR, CHARR, AND GRA YLING. 265.—The Parr is a still smaller species of trout, and yet more delicious in flavour. It is in high season during the months of July and August, and its freshness may be tested in the same manner as trout. They are very seldom boiled, but, when fried in the same method as trout, they form an ex- tremely nice side-dish, which may be served without any im- propriety as an entremet in the second course. The Charr, though generally looked upon as a sort of trout, is yet of a distinct species ; and though known in other parts of Europe, is in this country confined to a few of our lakes in Cumberland and the neighbouring counties. It is much larger than the parr, being commonly from 9 to 12 inches in length, while the parr is of little more than half that size. Not- withstanding some peculiarity of taste, it is however equally delicate, and is now brought to London in a fresh state. The best way of dressing it is baking, but it is chiefly brought to table in a potted state, and is sold at a high price, the dealers imitating it with every kind of small trout. The best season for tfrdm is from July to October, but they continue in good order until their time of spawning, in the months of November and December. The Grayling, like charr, is only to be found in a few coun- ties, which is to be regretted, as, being a fine fish, it forms a good-sized dish for the head of the table, often arriving to the weight of 3 to 5 lbs., though 2 to 3 lbs. is more common. It has also this advantage for those who have an abundant supply of all these sorts of fish, that it comes into season when the trout is going out. All the above fish may be dressed in the same manner, and their freshness tested in the same way, as trout. Perhaps, when very small, as nice a way as any is to split them at the back, and oil them over without any further trouble than seasoning them with a little pepper and salt, and putting them a few257 FRESH-WATER FISH. Chap. XV.] minutes before dinner-time upon the gridiron to broil, serving them without any other sauce than a squeeze of lemon, and placing them head and tail together. STURGEON 266.—Is, in the north of Europe, and in some of the States of North America, almost as common as salmon is in many of our English rivers, and grows to a much larger size. Here it is only so occasionally found as to be held a royal fish, and when taken in the Thames is always presented by the Lord Mayor to her Majesty. We should not therefore have thought it necessary to mention the modes of dressing, were it not that we shall probably soon have it in a fresh state through the I intervention of our steamboats. In Russia, and some parts of Germany, where sturgeon is common, the usual mode of dressing is to stew it in wine ; for it is a coarse sort of fish, somewhat resembling dark-coloured veal, and requiring strong high-flavoured sauce. Sturgeon a la Husse.—When the sturgeon is cleaned, lay it for several hours in salt and water; take it out an hour before it is wanted, rub "it well with vinegar, and pour a little ) over it; then put it into a fish-kettle, cover it with boiling- water, 1 oz. of bay-salt, 2 large onions, and a bunch of sweet herbs. Stew it in common wine, or strong ale, until the bones will separate easily; then take it up, remove the skin, flour it, and place it to brown before the fire, basting the fish well with butter. Serve up with a rich sauce made of beef-jffavy and red wine, highly seasoned with spice, and a garnish of pickles. In England they are usually cut into slices an inch thick, and fried ; then pour otf the fat, flour the pan, and pour boil- ing water into it ; put the fish into a stewpan with this gravy, an onion and sweet herbs, pepper and salt; let it stew until quite tender; strain the sauce, squeeze the juice of a lemon into it, and serve it up. Sturgeon may be baked or boiled, but the above way of dressing is one of the best; and the collops are better than those of either ling or halibut. Caviar is the roe of the sturgeon. When eaten fresh it much resembles the flavour of oysters ; and when accompanied with lemon-juice and pepper, without any kind of dressing, is usually served as a whet to the appetite previous to the soup. What sMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XV. 258 we get in this country is, however, always either dried into cakes or potted and salted. To stew Sturgeon.—Cut the fish in slices 1+ inch thick, dip them in vinegar, dry them well, flour, and broil the slices; then flour and lay them in a stewpan with some good broth, and let them stew gently until perfectly tender; thicken the gravy with butter or cream, add a spoonful of Harvey’s sauce, l a glass of wine, and serve it up with capers strewed over the top, and garnished with slices of lemon. To roast.—Put a good-sized piece in a large cradle-spit (5 or 6 lbs. will make a handsome dish for the head of the table) ; stuff1 it with forcemeat; keep it at the fire for 2 or 3 hours, but remove the skin; cover it with crumbs of bread, and brown it with the salamander; baste it constantly with butter, and serve with a good brown gravy, an anchovy, a squeeze of Seville orange or lemon, and a glass of sherry boiled I up, and poured into the dish. Sturgeon Cutlets.—Cut in slices f inch thick ; dry, flour, and egg them; dip them in crumbs, seasoned with pepper, salt, parsley, and thyme; fry them, and serve with Indian pickle, tomata, or piquant sauce. CARP AND TENCH 267.—Are rather pond than river fish ; and although ever , accompanied and considered of the same species, are yet widely different in both size and flavour—the carp arriving, in a long course of years, to more than 50 lbs., while the tench seldom reaches so much jis, a tithe of that weight. The flavour of carp also depends wholly on the way it which it is dressed, ; while the tench possesses naturally a very delicious degree of richness. There is also this rather extraordinary difference, that, while carp are preyed upon by pike and perch, the tench is never attacked by either, owing, as it is supposed, to a slimy substance in the skin. Being of similar habits, they both spawn in June, soon after which they recover, and are again in good order in the month of August. They however bury themselves in the mud during the period of winter; and from thus living in slime, the flesh often contracts a disagreeable muddy flavour, which cannot be removed until the fish is kept alive for some days in pure water; and this can only be done by persons who have ponds of their own in which to changeChap. XV.] 259 FRESH-WATER FISH. them. The odour will not exist long after the breaking up of winter; but if then not quite free from it, the best way is to insert a large piece of bread into the belly of the fish while being dressed, and removing it when quite done. The head of the fish is looked upon as the best part, and next to that is the back ; but the merits of the carp must ever depend more on the goodness of the sauce than the richness of its flesh. The Crucian Carp is a diminutive species, which is some- times passed off as being of the genuine sort, though utterly worthless. To boil Carp or Tench.—Clean and scale your fish, and take out the gills, as they are always muddy ; raise the back-bone, and rub in some salt; then let it lie in some strong salted spring water for a couple of hours, after which wash it out in clear spring water, then put it into boiling water with a good handful of salt; and, if it be of a moderate size, let it boil from 15 to 20 minutes with the milt or roe. Garnish with parsley and slices of lemon, and serve up melted butter with fish- sauces for table. Carp boiled “ an bleu—Draw the carp and clean it well, but do not scale it. Split it in half; then cut it in pieces large enough for serving up ; lay them on a dish with the scales undermost, and the milt at top, and pour over each some scalding vinegar ; add only water enough to just cover the fish, and put into it 2 or 3 onions with cloves, some scraped horse- radish, whole pepper, allspice, and a good handfull of salt. "When the water boils, lay the pieces in it, and let it boil for G an hour, taking care to skim it well whilst boiling. To stew Carp.—Clean the fish thoroughly, and dry it well on a cloth, dredge it with flour, and fry it of a light colour ; then put it into a stewpan, with equal parts of wine and water, a tablespoonful of lemon-pickle, the same of walnut-ketchup, a teaspoonful of mushroom-powder, and a little cayenne pepper ; add a large onion stuck with clo-ves, and a stick of horse radish. Cover the pan closely to keep in the steam, and let the contents stew over a stove very gently until the gravy is reduced to a quantity sufficient only to cover the fish; then take it up, strain the gravy, thicken it, and add it to the fish. In cleansing your carp, wash out the blood with a little vinegar, which save; then split and cut the fish into pieces, s 2MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XY. 260 ■which fry with the roe in the stewpan, until nicely brown; then add the vinegar and blood, 2 or 3 large onions stuck with cloves, some whole pepper, cinnamon, allspice, salt, lemon- peel, and a slice or two of lemon ; close the lid, and let the con- tents stew gradually, taking care to skim it well. When done, take out some of the liquor, and season with eschalot and chili vinegar, soy, anchovies,' and ketchup thickened with a little Hour; add h pint of port wine, and serve it up for table; garnish with sippets. Or :—Cut off the head, tail, and fins ; season the carp with salt, pepper, and powdered mace, botli inside and out; rub the seasoning on very well, and let the pieces lie in it an hour; then put them into a stewpan with a little parsley chopped fine, a whole onion, a little sweet marjoram, a teacupful of thick cream or very rich milk, and a lump of butter rolled in flour. Pour in sufficient water to cover the carp, and let it stew i an hour. If to the above be added f pint of white wine in which the yolks of a couple of eggs have been beaten up with a lump of sugar of the size of about a walnut, and a grating of nut- meg, it will greatly improve the sauce. To stew Tench.—Scale and clean ; take care of the roe, &c.; lay the fish in a stewpan with a rich beef-gravy, an onion stuck with cloves, some mace and allspice, with a dessertspoonful of Jamaica pepper; simmer, closely covered ; when nearly done, add 2 anchovies chopped fine, a dessertspoonful of made mus- tard, some walnut-ketchup, and as much curry-powder as will add a high flavour to the fish; thicken the sauce with flour, if that be not sufficiently done with the curry-powder, and reduce it with a couple of glasses of good port wine. Let the gravy boil a few minutes, then add a spoonful of soy. Serve with sippets of fried bread, the roe fried, and a good deal of horse- radish and lemon. To fry Carp and Tench.—You may safely employ precisely the same methods as those used for dressing trout; or cut fillets from them, which wrap in buttered paper with all sorts of pot-herbs, minced shalot., chives, and mushroom, and put these envelopes upon the gridiron. The papers may either be taken off, and the contents made into one, and served with caper-sauce, or left on; and if made small enough for a single person, each may be helped separately, and the fillet eaten withChap. XV.] 261 FRESH-WATER EISH. a squeeze of lemon. The tench is better in this way than the carp, as being of a richer nature. To dress the Roe of Carp.—It should be a little salted, and boiled in vinegar; then cut into small pieces, seasoned with spice, and made up into cakes with bread-crumbs and minced lemon-peel. They may be either put into scallop-shells and heated before the fire, or baked in a Dutch oven. A la Cliambord.—Let a whole carp be stewed in the usual way along with the roe of the carp: when done, skin the fish, and lard it with bits of bacon, putting the fish before the fire, or in the oven, to brown ; but take out the roe, and make it into balls, to be fried with forcemeat. Then make any sauce you choose, either white or brown, and seasoned to your pleasure, and serve it under the carp. THE FRESH- WA TER BREAM 268.—Is often found in the same waters as the carp, and commonly attains the size of 2 to 3 lbs. weight. Their highest I condition is from Midsummer to Michaelmas, and they may be dressed in the same manner as carp, but are not so good. PIKE, 269.—Or Jack, as country people call it, is a ravenous fish which preys upon the smaller species which inhabit our streams, and lives to a great age, acquiring so large a size as to be sometimes found of the weight of 40 to 50 lbs. They are, however, more esteemed when not more than about 8 or 10. They spawn in March or April, and are in the best condition from Michaelmas to February. Pike, although a dry fish, and therefore much indebted to stuffing and sauce, is yet better flavoured than carp, and is much improved by rubbing a little salt down the back-bone the day before using. In cleaning it, the roe should be care- fully extracted, as it is a strong purgative ; and the fish should be left for an hour or two in vinegar before being dressed. To boil Pike.—Scale it, and stuff it through the gills ; or open as near the throat as you can, and, after well cleaning, stuff it with the following:—Grated bread, herbs, anchovies, oysters, suet, salt, pepper, mace, £ pint of cream, 4 yolks of eggs; mix all over the fire till it thickens, then put it (as a pudding) into the fish, and sew it up. Boil it, and when the262 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XY. fish is ready take a large cup of rich broth, with a dessert- spoonful of essence of anchovy, the same of soy, and a squeeze of lemon, some butter rolled in flour, and, boiling it up, pour it into the dish. Or:—Having salted it for a day or two, boil it for 25 or 30 minutes, and serve it with a sauce made of good bouillon, fried onions, parsley and allspice, thickened with mustard, or with egg-sauce and parsnips. If stewed, the above materials may be put into good gravy with a glass or two of wine. Small jack also eats well cut into fillets and fried, or cut in pieces and stewed as eels. To bake.—Take a large fish, stuff it with forcemeat, skewer it round, flour, and lay it on an earthen dish, with pieces of butter on the top, and a sprinkling of salt; send it to the oven. A large pie will take an hour in baking. When removed from the oven, the dish will be found full of gravy. Put to a sufficient portion for the sauce 2 anchovies finely chopped, a little grated lemon-peel, a glass of wine, Reading sauce, or lemon-pickle, and make it as thick as cream with flour and butter, adding capers if desirable. A pike of 4 lbs., cut in slices, and crimped like codfish, and then fried, is as good eating as any fresh-water fish that comes to table. PERCH 270. —Are in season from the latter end of May till the be- ginning of February, during which time their condition may be ascertained not only by the rosy freshness of their gills, but also by the glowing appearance of the golden tinge upon their back and silvery white upon the belly. They are seldom found in our markets of more than 1 lb. in weight. They may be dressed in the various ways employed for trout, having first cut off the powerful spines with which the back is armed, and carefully scraping off the scales. The most usual, however, is the Dutch mode of stewing them, called— WATER ZOUTCHEE, 271. —Which maybe made of carp, tench, perch, and floun- ders ; but the 2 latter are much the most usual. In Holland they are almost invariably boiled simply in a small quantity of water, along with a large handful of parsley, and served up in a tureen filled with (lie water in which the fish has been boiled.263 FRESH-WATER FISH. Chap. XV.] It is always eaten with bread and butter, the bread being made of rye, and not, as in London “ brown bread,” of wlieaten bran. Water Suehe.—Take a few parsley-roots, cut them in strips as for soup Julienne, about an inch long and about a sixteenth square ; put these to boil in a little salt and water; when done throw in a handful of small sprigs of parsley ; when that boils put in the fish ; when done serve in a deep dish, putting suffi- cient liquor, and the roots and the parsley. The mode employed at the Cape of Good Hope is to make a fine onion-sauce; add to it a bunch of parsley cut in pieces, and the same of sorrel, with pepper and salt; put in the fish, and boil the whole together. SHAD AND BARBEL 272. —Are both common to the Thames, but are so indif- ferent in quality that they seldom appear at any good table; for although, if well stewed, they may be made good dishes, yet that can only be done by the excellence of the sauce, and the fish is not worth the expense of making it. The latter, indeed, though fished for by anglers for the sake of amuse- ment, is very generally thrown away when caught, and its roe is considered to be poisonous. The former may, however, be broiled, after being well basted in oil, peppered and salted, and eaten either with oil and vinegar or with sorrel-sauce. EELS. 273. —There is a greater difference in the goodness of eels * than of any other fresh-water fish. The true silver eel is caught in the Thames; and those caught in the Colne, the Wandle, or any of the running streams having a gravelly bottom, are always good. The Dutch eels sold at Billingsgate are very bad ; and those in ponds have usually a strong muddy flavour. They are in season the whole year round, excepting the months of April and May, and when in high condition have a bright, glossy appearance on the back, and a brilliant white on the belly, from which they have acquired the name of “ sil- ver eels;” though another sort, called the “grig,” is nearly as good. The silver cels grow to a large size, and the larger they are the better they are thought to be, but a fish of 2 to 3 lbs. weight must be considered very fine. Unless fully £ lb.264 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XV. in weight they are hardly worth purchasing, except for the purpose of enriching fish-stews or making small eel-patties. Preparatory to most modes of dressing, they should be well cleaned, gutted, and skinned; the heads and tails cut off, and the rest of the fish cut into short pieces of 3 to 4 inches in length, and left for an hour or two in salt water.1 To boil Eels.—They should be of a good size, prepared'as above, dried, floured, and boiled in salt and water, with a good deal of parsley, for about 4 an hour, or until tender ; then served with parsley and butter, of which a portion may be thrown over them, and they may be garnished with scraped horseradish. Or:—If, in lieu of parsley, the rind of a lemon, pared very thin, be boiled with the eel, and this boned and left cold, then covered with transparent calf’s-foot jelly, it will form an ele- gant little supper-dish. To fry.-—Instead of being cut into pieces, they maybe left whole, and trussed in a circular form, with their tail thrust through the jaws; but great care should be taken in gutting them. They should be rolled in yolk of eggs and bread- crumbs, or a thick coating of sweet herbs, and fried a pale brown. They may be served with any savoury or acid sauce that may be preferred. To broil.—The same process may be adopted by merely changing the frying-pan for the gridiron, and wrapping the eels in buttered paper; but, if thought proper, the bread- crumbs and herbs may be omitted, as well as the envelope of paper, and the eel merely brushed over with the yolk of egg. Turn them frequently, and take them up when quite brown. Some persons, indeed, prefer the skins to be kept on, as it retains the oily richness of the fish, which, when stripped of its skin, is deprived of some portion of its mellowness. The skin is, of course, not eaten ; but the fish itself is certainly rendered more delicious, and if taken with acid sauce, or the mere 1 u The best way to kill cm ccl is to divide the spine just behind the head, without severing it from the body, when the fish will die almost instanta- neously ” (Piscator, p. 38).—“ To skin eels in the most easy manner, first cut through the skin all round, just below the gills, with a sharp knife, then stick either an iron skewer or the prong of a stout fork through the head above, and so holding on by that part with your right hand, take a coaise towel in your left hand, and grasping the fish tightly below where you have cut through the skin, you may strip it off as easy as a stocking ” (lb. p. 16-)-.265 Chap. XV.] FRESH-WATER FISH. squeeze of a lemon, is well worth the trial. The eels should be thoroughly done; and if of a large size should be parboiled previous to being either fried or broiled. To stew Eels.—Cut the eel in pieces; put it into a stew- pan with i pint of port wine, and i pint of gravy, 1 large onion cut in slices, 2 blades of mace, 3 bay-leaves, a few corns of allspice, 2 cloves, 2 slices of lemon, a little parsley and thyme, pepper and salt, and let it simmer gently over the fire until the eels are done; then strain the sauce, thicken with flour and butter, and add anchovy-sauce and ketchup. Or:—Cut the eels in pieces, fry them a little until they are a fine brown; let them remain until cold ; take an onion, a little parsley, a leaf of sage chopped very finely ; put them in some gravy, with a clove, a blade of mace, pepper and salt, a glass of port wine, and a little lemon-juice ; strain the sauce and thicken it with butter and flour, adding a little anchovy essence and ketchup ; stew the eels until they are tender. Or:—Take a pint each of port wine and beef-gravy or gravy-soup, with a few fried onions sliced and 4 lb. of butter, and let the eels stew in it for 4 an hour, carefully stirring, and having previously seasoned it with spice, soy, and ketchup. Eels stewed in the French ivay.—Skin the eels, and skewer them round; put them into an earthen pan with all sorts of roots cut small, a few peppercorns, cloves, and a little salt, about a pint of vinegar and ketchup, with as much broth : bake them 1 hour in the oven uncovered with pie-crust, and in the mean while thicken the stock with some good cream flavoured with a grate of nutmeg. The other modes are more in the dif- ference of sauce than the methods of dressing, though put under various names. Eels spitchcocked.—Split the eels down the back, but do not skin them; wash, dry, and flour them; spread on the inside a little butter, then egg them, and strew rather thickly parsley, thyme, marjoram, and lemon-peel, all finely chopped; season witli pepper, salt, a little cayenne, and a very little nutmeg; dip them in bread-crumbs, cut them in pieces, and broil them of a light brown ; serve with melted butter. The proportions should be marjoram 1 part, lemon-peel 2, thyme 3, and parsley 4 parts. To roast an Eel.—The mode directed by old Izaak Walton, as mentioned in his Life, is so quaint and characteristic, that we266 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XY. give it here:—“ First wash him in water and salt; then pull off his skin below his vent or navel; having done that, take out his guts as clean as you can, but wash him not; then give him 3 or 4 scotches with a knife, and then put into his belly, and into those scotches, sweet herbs, an anchovy, and a little nutmeg grated, or cut very small, and mixed with good butter and salt. Having done this, then pull Ms skin over him, all but his head, which you are to cut off, to the end you may tie his skin to the part where his head grew, and it must be so tied as to keep all his moisture within his skin; and having done this, tie him with tape or packthread to a spit, and roast him leisurely, and baste him with salt and water till his skin breaks, and then with butter; and having roasted him enough, let what was put into his belly and what he drips be his sauce.” To which we would add— Chop as small as possible 2 large spoonfuls of capers and 2 unwashed anchovies: put them into a saucepan with } lb. of butter, 2 spoonfuls of water boiling hot, and 1 of caper-vine- gar : shake the pan over the fire until all be completely mixed, and serve it separately as sauce. LAMPREY, 274. —Though but little known in London, are rather plenti- ful in the neighbourhood of Worcester, and thence frequently sent, as presents, to various parts of the kingdom. To stew Lamprey.—After cleaning the fish carefully, remove the cartilage which runs down the back, and season with a small quantity of cloves, mace, nutmeg, pepper, and allspice ; put it into a small stewpot, with as much strong beef-gravy, and madeira or sherry, in equal quantities, as will cover it. Cover close: stew till tender, then take out the lamprey and keep it hot, while you boil up the liquor with 2 or 3 anchovies chopped, and some flour and butter; strain the gravy through a sieve, and add lemon-juice and some made mustard, berve with sippets of bread and horse-radish. When there is spawn it must be fried and put round. It will take twice as much stewing as an eel of the same size ; and if to be either fried or broiled, it ought to be first partially boiled.

XV.] FRESH-WATER FISH. selves into the British Channel; but those found in the Thames and Medway are the best. , They are in season from the 1st of November until the end of May, after which time they are protected by law. They are a small fish ; if good, are of a fine silvery hue, are very firm, have a refreshing smell, like cucumbers newly cut, and are much used as a garnish to turbot and boiled cod ; but they are also excellent when eaten alone and simply fried in lard or oil, without any other sauce than a squeeze of lemon, as any other addition destroys the delicacy of their flavour. They should be perfectly fresh, and this can be readily ascertained by the redness of their gills and the fulness of the eyes, which, if sunk, show that they are stale. They are always dressed whole; and in gutting them they should be as little handled as possible, nor should they be washed, but merely wiped gently with a towel and dusted with flour, then egged and crumbed. WHITE BAIT. 276. —Have an iron frying-pan about 4 inches deep; put into it lard sufficient to cover it about 14- inch. Lay a cloth on the dresser, spread over it a quart of flour; take the white bait out of the water, and sprinkle it thinly on the flour; put the whole into a sieve, sift the flour from the white bait, whip them into the boiling lard ; when crisp take them out; sprinkle a little salt over them; serve with brown bread and butter, cayenne, and lemon. . ROACH, DACE, AND GUDGEON, 277. —Are chosen by the same rules as other fish ; are taken in running streams; come in about midsummer, and are to be had for 5 or 6 months. The roach is the largest, and is some- times baked for hours in a slow oven, with vinegar and water seasoned with mace and allspice, and covered with bay-leaves ; or stewed in layers with sliced onions, to improve its insipidity. Gudgeons, though very small, are nicely flavoured, but are seldom used in any other manner than fried as a garnish to boiled fish. All these small fry may be dressed in the same manner as smelts.268 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVI. CHAPTER XVI. SHELL-FISH. 278.—Although crabs and lobsters may be seen at the fishmongers’ the whole year round, they are yet only in high season and plentiful from the month of April till the close of October. They should be always purchased alive, for many are found dead in the cobles in which they are brought from Norway, and are then boiled and sold under pretence of their having been just killed. If lobsters have not been long taken, the claws will have a strong motion when you put your finger on the eyes and press them. The heaviest, if of good size, are the best, but the largest are not the best. When you buy them ready boiled, try whether their tails are stiff, and pull up with a spring; if otherwise, they are either watery or not fresh. The 11 cock- lobster,” as the male is called, is known by the narrow back part of his tail, and the 2 uppermost fins within it are stiff and hard; but those of the hen are soft, and the tail broader. The male, though generally smaller, has the highest flavour; the flesh is firmer, and the colour, when boiled, is a deeper red; but the female has that fine coral so highly prized by cooks for the improvement of their sauces, which appears with the rudiments of the spawn. To boil Lobsters.—Put them alive, with their claws tied together, into the water when boiling hot, and keep it so until the fish is done, which, if of a pound weight, will take about i of an hour, and if larger will require not quite the same pro- portion of time, for if boiled too long the meat will be stringy. Many people are shocked at the apparent cruelty of thus kill- ing them, but death takes place immediately, and life cannot be taken away without pain. When sent to table to be eaten cold, the tail and body shoulc be split from end to end, the claws cracked, but not unshel e ,Chap. XVI.] 269 SHELL-FISH. and the meat may be made into salad, or mixed in such manner as each person pleases, and many persons add a teaspoonful of white powdered sugar, thinking that it gives a mellowness to the whole. It is scarcely necessary to mention that the head of a lobster, and what are called the “lady-fingers,” are not to be eaten. To stew Lobsters.—Take the meat out of the shells of 1 or 2 boiled lobsters. Put the shells into a pint of water with some whole pepper, salt, and a little mace. Let it boil till all the goodness is extracted from the shells ; then strain it. Mix with a little cream, or thin melted butter, the rich portion of the lobster, and the coral: add a small quantity of lemon-juice and 2 tablespoonfuls of wine, mix it with the gravy, and warm the lobster in it; a few minutes will suffice. Or:—Cut the meat of a boiled lobster into pieces, and put them into a covered metal dish with a bit of butter, 2 large spoonfuls of any sort of gravy, 1 of soy or walnut-ketchup, a little salt and cayenne, with a glass of port wine, and warm it. If there be a lamp under the dish, you may do it at your own table within a few minutes. Another mode of stewing lobsters is :—Take the meat of 2 lobsters, mince it small, and put it into a pint of beef-soup. Let it stew a little; thicken it with a piece of butter rolled in flour ; add a glass of white nine, with a little pepper ; add salt and nutmeg, a spoonful of ketchup, 1 of anchovy, and 1 of lemon-juice. Let the whole stew together, and serve up, gar- nishing the dish with the small claws. To fricassee Lobster.—Parboil it, extract the meat from the •shell, and cut it into small pieces ; season it with white pepper, salt, and nutmeg, and put it into the stewpan, with as much cream or richly-made white sauce as will cover it. Keep the lid close, set the pan on hot coals, and stew it slowly for about as long a time as it was previously boiled. Croquettes of Lobster.—Take the meat from the shell, chop it finely, mix it with a little salt, pepper, and pounded mace; take i part of fine bread-crumbs, make it up into balls with melted butter, brush the balls with yolk of e^-g and dredge them with bread-crumbs, and fry them, serving with or without gravy: if dry, they must be sent up with crisped parsley. Lobster Fritters.—Pick out the meat, chop it, and warmMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVI. 270 it with some melted butter, adding shrimps or prawns if the quantity be small. Cut pieces of paste into pretty shapes, fry them, and serve up the lobster heaped upon them, which is sometimes more convenient than making into patties. If, however, the pieces be put into the paste, which is then rolled around them, they make nice fritters. Or, if put into a shape and warmed before the fire, and browned with the salamander, they will make a very pretty side-dish. Miroton of Lobster.—Take the meat of a good-sized lobster, and put it into a mortar, with the crumb of a French roll soaked in cream; pound them well together; then add the yolks of 3 eggs, and some fat of ham also pounded; season it with pepper, salt, and a little mace. Add the whole of an egg beaten up to a strong froth, and take care that the spawn of the lobster should have been pounded with the rest. Line a mould with slices of fat bacon, put in the ingredients, and boil it for lj hour. Serve up in a dish with lobster-sauce round it. Scolloped Lobster.—Take out the meat from 2 middling- sized lobsters, put it into a mortar, pound it with a little salt and some cayenne pepper, then mix it with fine white sauce; have the shells ready, that is, the tails split, and the 2 bodies, making in all 6 pieces, which are enough for a dish. Put the lobster into the shells, and the shells either into an oven or upon a gridiron. Serve it very hot. Or:—Pound the fish in the above manner, adding only a very little salt with nutmeg instead of cayenne, and beat it up with thick cream ; it may then be either put into puff-paste for patties, or served up as a fricassee. These are all excellent dishes, and will form an elegant remove for a second course. PR A WNS AND SHRIMPS, 279.—Which appear like diminutive species of lobster, are yet of separate tribes, the former being the larger of the two, though the shrimp is very generally thought to possess the highest flavour. They are in season at the same time as lob- sters, are boiled in the same manner, only for about half the time, and, when fresh, their colour is bright and the body firm. Both shrimps and prawns form a very common relish whenSHELL-FISH. Chap. XVI.] 271 eaten cold at the breakfast-table, and when dressed hot the latter are celebrated for the flavour of their curry, as the former is in general use for the making of sauce, dhey also, as well as lobsters, made excellent fritters and rissoles. To stew.—Pick the meat out of the shells, put it into a stew- pan with i pint of good gravy and a glass of claret; add an onion minced fine, some sweet herbs, and a little pepper and salt. Let them stew gently until quite tender; then add a large spoonful of mushroom ketchup, 1 of essence of anchovy, ant? a piece of butter rolled in flour. Serve up hot, and garnish with bread-sippets. If brought to table cold, as a supper dish, they will be found a very delicate and elegant entree, if served in a shape and covered with clear jelly. CRAB, 280.—Though not so well known as the lobster, is looked upon by many as being a better-flavoured fish, and perhaps rather more digestible. The female is considered inferior to the male, and may be known by the claws being smaller, and the tail much wider. The heaviest are usually thought to be the best, but those of a middling size are the sweetest. If light, they are watery; when in perfection, the joints of the legs are stiff; the shell, whether alive or dead, should be of a bright red ; and the body has a very agreeable smell. The eyes look dead and loose when stale, or when the fish have died a natural death. They are boiled in the same manner as lobster, but re- quire rather longer time, and are most usually eaten cold 'with oil and vinegar, as thus:—Pick out all the fish from the shell, divide it into small pieces, mixing the rich part well with the rest; moisten it with salad dressing, and return it to the shell with an edge all round of sliced lemon. If hot, pick the fish out as above ; then put the meat, with a little nutmeg, salt, pepper, bits of butter, crumbs of bread, and 3 spoonfuls of vinegar, into the shell again, and set it before the fire. You may brown it with a salamander, but it should be always served in the shell. Dry toast should be served to eat with it. Observe to remove “ the lady,” as it is called. To stew Crabs.—Pick the meat carefully out of a largeMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVI. 272 crab and its claws ; cut into small pieces, mix it with about a fourth part of bread-crumbs, and a very small quantity of finely shred parsley. Season it well, and return it to the shell with some small bits of butter here and there, enough, when warmed, to keep it moist. Squeeze the juice of a lemon over it, or a spoonful of lemon-pickle or acid sauce. Put a thick layer of crumbs of bread upon the top with small bits of butter laid all over it, and bake it in the shell before the fire or in the oven. The shell of one crab will contain the meat of two. Or:—Boil them, take the meat out of the bodies and the large claws, put it into a stewpan with h pint of claret, a spoonful of eschalot-vinegar, a little cayenne, some salt, and a piece of butter; let them stew for an hour over a gentle fire, until they are almost dry. Then add a small quantity of fish-stock or gravy, a tablespoonful of essence of anchovy, and a small piece of butter rolled in flour. Serve with sippets of fried bread round the dish. Another xoay is to put the meat into a stewpan with i pint of white wine, a spoonful of eschalot or garlic vinegar, a little parsley and thyme minced fine, the yolks of 3 eggs boiled hai’d and minced small, and some salt and cayenne pepper. Let it stew gently till quite tender and almost dry; then add a piece of butter, stir it about for a few minutes over the fire, wash the shells, butter them, put the stewed meat into them, and serve on a napkin. SMALL CRABS AND CRAYFISH 281.—Are sometimes made into soup, but more commonly plain boiled for about i of an hour and eaten cold. In the lower parts of Germany they are, however, frequently eaten hot, with rye-bread and butter, and are there a favourite sup- per dish in the heat of summer. To steio Crayfish.—Boil them in salt and water, pick the meat out of the tails and claws, put them into a stewpan with a little butter, some mushrooms, and truffles; moisten them with a little fish-stock, and simmer a short time over a gentle fire. When nearly done, beat the yolks of 2 or 3 eggs with a teacupful of cream and a little chopped parsley ; let all stew together for a few minutes, stirring it all the time, and serve up in a deep dish.Chap. XVI.] 273 SHELL-FISH. Crayfish Butter.—Take the shells of 24 crayfish, clean them well from skin and fibre, put them into an oven to dry, without burning or browning, until they can be beaten to a fine powder ; mix the powder very well with 3 ounces of fresh butter, then put it into a stewpan with a spoonful of hot water, mixing it well together; then squeeze the whole through a tamis over a stewpan of boiling water; skim the butter off into a basin of cold water, that it may set; when cold press it in a napkin. It forms a beautiful colouring addition to many kinds of dishes, fish especially, and, when mixed with the meat pounded after being taken from the shells, makes fine sauce. OYSTERS 282.—Depend very much for goodness upon the beds from which they have been taken. There are several kinds: the “ Pvfieet,” “ Colchester,” and “ Milford,” are excellent, and the “ native Milton ” are very fine, being white and fat; but others may be made to possess both these qualities in some | degree by proper feeding. The rock oyster is largest, but i usually has a coarse flavour if eaten raw. They all come into season, according to law, on the 4th of I August, and go out at the close of April; or, according to j an old saying, “ so long as there is an R in the month.” They i are, however, not perfectly good until the beginning of Octo- ber, and should go out at the end of March. Although salt and water will alone preserve the flavour of | the oysters in their greatest perfection if they be of good I quality, yet, if thin, or appearing out of order, a sprinkling ' of oatmeal will, in the course of 2 days, tend to greatly im- i prove and fatten them. When the fish is alive and strong, 1 the shell closes on the knife. They should be eaten as opened, 4 the flavour becoming poor if long exposed to the air. To scallop Oysters.—Take 12 of the smaller sort, beard 4 them, cut out the hard part which adheres to their shells, and j leave them in their liquor; have ready a quantity of crumbs lj of fresh bread, not too finely grated, and mixed with a little | pepper and salt; then grease a scallop-shell, strew upon it * some of the crumbs with bits of butter, and lay upon them a ] layer ol the oysters; then crumbs, bits of butter, and oysters, i layer upon layer, until the shell is filled up ; cover it with a TMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVI. 274 thick coating of the crumbs well buttered, and brown it in a Dutch oven. A dozen oysters, with a proper quantity of crumbs, will fill up the largest scallop-shell, and take an hour to be thoroughly done. Some cooks scald the oysters for 5 minutes in their own liquor, and mix with them minced shalot, or chives, and pot- herbs ; but these, although they may please an epicurean palate, will destroy the natural flavour of the oyster. Or .-—Keep the oysters in their liquor, put a bit of butter in a stewpan, with minced parsley, shalot, and a little pepper; brown them with a fried onion ; then add the oyster-liquor, strained, and a little good gravy, work them until they are of the consistence of sauce, but do not add flour to thicken it, as it spoils the taste of the oyster-liquor, and gives them a soddened appearance; then toss and put in the oysters, add lemon-juice, and fill the scallop-shells, which may be put before the fire to be kept hot, but without bread-crumbs or artificial browning of any sort: they are an admirable addition to a rump-steak. To broil Oysters.—Take them from the shells, beard them, and put them with their liquor into tin shapes made to imitate scallops, 6 in a shell (not more),, with a little pepper and butter. Put the shells upon a gridiron over a good fire, and serve them when plump and quite hot. They are delicious this way; but to be eaten in perfection should be cooked in the room where they are eaten. Squeeze a little lemon-juice over them when they come from the fire. Or :—They may be put singly in their under shells along with their own liquor, a little minced parsley and spice,, and a bit of butter, and thus put upon the gridiron, to be taken off when thoroughly heated. With White Sauce.—Beard the oysters, wash them in their own liquor, then strain it, thicken it with melted butter, or white sauce made of cream, not milk and flour ; season it with a blade of mace and a few whole peppercorns tied in a muslin bag. Simmer the oysters very gently, and serve up witli sippets of bread : they will require only a few minutes, and if allowed to boil will become hard. With Brown Sauce.—Wash the oysters in their liquor, and then strain it, add a glass of wine, 2 spoonfuls of beef-gravy, ■some whole pepper, a little salt, a piece of butter, and a275 SHELL-FISH. Chap. XYL] spoonful of lemon-juice; boil the whole, stirring it until it is smooth, then put in the oysters, and warm or plump them up without boiling. Oyster Rolls.—Take about a quart of the largest and finest oysters you can procure, stew them in their own liquor with some pepper, a very little mace, and some green onion chopped fine, thicken them with a little butter and a dust of flour when nearly done enough. Take 2 French rolls of the square sort baked in tins, cut a piece otf the top, and scoop out the greater part of the crumb, fill your roll with the oysters and the liquor, and set them near the fire on a chafing-dish filled with hot coals ; as the liquor soaks in, fill them with more, or if you have not any left, add a little good g-ravy boiling hot. Or:—Let them first soak, then fasten in the top, cover the entire of the roll in batter, and bake it in the Dutch oven till well browned. Or :—Mince the oysters, season them only with mace and nutmeg, and fill the rolls up with cream or rich white sauce, and bake them as above : even one large roll will make a nice little dish, and is better than the smaller sort. Oyster Sausages may also be made of the larger kind, bearded and minced small, together with a moderate quantity of beef suet and bread-crumbs, to which should be added a forcemeat of pounded pork or veal, seasoned with spice and put into the usual skins. If well seasoned, they will keep good for a full week : 1 lb. of beef suet shred fine, and the same quantity of forcemeat, with bread-crumbs, should be put •to each pint of oysters. Or:—Take i lb. of lean beef or mutton, i lb. of beef suet, 2 score of oysters bearded and scalded in their own liquor, then dried and all chopped together, adding bread- crumbs and yolks of eggs to bind the materials. Season well with salt, white pepper, mace, and a grate of nutmeg; or if you wish to make it very savoury, leave out the mace and nut- meg, but add a little cayenne, with a minced shalot and a spoonful of garlic-vinegar. They may be either made as sausages, or fried into shapes in the usual way. MUSCLES—E.

They are also boiled or stewed in the following manner: open them, put them into a pan with their own liquor, to which add a large onion and some pars- ley, with 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar; roll a piece of butter in flour, beat an egg, and add it to the gravy, warming the whole up very gradually. In France muscles are skewered upon a small skewer and roasted, or dipped into a thick batter and fried. In preparing muscles for table, care should be taken to destroy the beards, as well also as a small species of crab which is sometimes found in their shells. They are not in season during the summer. COCKLES AND PERIWINKLES, 284. —Despicable as they may appear, make excellent sauces and even soups, the receipts for which may be found under their several heads in Chap. IV. To boil.—It is only necessary to put them in a stewpan with as much water as will prevent the bottom from burning, as the liquor oozing from them will be sufficient for the pur- pose : when the shells open wide enough to extract the fish, they will be sufficiently done. To stew.—Clean them and wash them from the sand in 3 or 4 waters, boil them and pick them out of the shells. To a pint of the fish put 4 pint of fish-stock, 2 ounces of butter, and some pepper and salt; add a spoonful of flour, stirred in gradually, and simmer over a slow fire, until it is of a proper thickness ; add a large spoonful of essence of anchovy and one of mushroom ketchup. SCALLOPS. 285. — To stew.—Boil them very well in salt and water, then take them out and stew them in a little of their liquor, a glass of white wine, and a little vinegar ; add some grated bread-crumbs, and the yolks of 2 or 3 hard eggs minced small. Stew all together till they are sufficiently done, then add a large spoonful of essence of anchovy and a good piece of butter rolled in flour: or stew very gradually in a rich white sauce, with thick cream, until quite hot, but without being allowed to boil, and serve with sippets. Crayfish, prawns, and shrimps may all be done in the same manner.277 FISH. Chap. XVI.]' FILLETS OF FISH. 286. —Take any white fish, bone, split, and cut them into handsome fillets, and squeeze the juice of a lemon over them, make a fine forcemeat with lobsters or shrimps, lay it thickly on the fillets, roll them up, and tie or skewer them. Put them into a fish-gravy, and bake them in an oven : when done, thicken the gravy and serve up the fish in it. TO SCOLLOP FISH 287. —Is in some measure to make it into a pie, as the usual mode is to bake it in scollops or shapes resembling the shells ; I as thus :— Flake the fish, and imbed it in Jwead-crumbs moistened with thin melted butter or cream, flavoured with any approved sauce ; cover the top thickly with bread-crumbs, lay bits of I butter over, and bake it either before the fire or in a Dutch oven ; or lay the fish in the bottom of the dish, with a rich ] white sauce of cream, and cover the top only with bread- i crumbs. UNE GRENADE. 288. —Scrape gently the flesh of a large whiting from the skin and bones ; beat it in a mortar 15 minutes: having scraped 2 ounces of the finest fat bacon, beat them together another 15 minutes ; then add a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, 2 ounces of butter, a small bit of garlic chopped to a mash, a blade of mace in powder, and the beaten yolks of 2 eggs, and pound a full i hour more : when to be used, mix well therein the fresh-beaten whites of 2 eggs, reserving a teaspoonful to be used as hereafter directed. Meanwhile take the bones and fins from 4 or 5 little red mullet, without in- juring the skin, and cut them lengthwise an inch wide; do the same by a good-sized sole, having split but not removed any of the skin. Then stew a small veal sweetbread, a fresh artichoke-bottom, 8 oysters without the beard, and 2 truffles cut in bits, for I of an hour in a little butter, and let it become cold. When all the above are in readiness, line a pan of 5 or 6 inches in diameter with long slices of fat bacon, placed quite close, in the centre of which lay 4 bits of carrot, cut diamond shape, lengthwise; cover the bacon with the strips of fish perfectly united, alternately putting the brown and white of the sole and the red of the mullet next to the bacon, and onMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVI. 278 these 7 the forcemeat: then put in the sweetbread, &c., which cover with the remainder of the forcemeat, smoothing it over with the back of a spoon wetted with the white of the egg before directed to be preserved. Lay on it a buttered paper, put the cover of the pan on, and bake 20 minutes. When done, turn the grenade on the lid to drain, carefully remove the bacon without breaking the skin of the fish, and serve veiy hot, with rich veal gravy round, not over it. The entrails of the mullet will give additional flavour to the force- meat. Where they cannot be had, the red part of lobsters, used alternately with the brown and white of the sole or mackerel, will look beautiful. Grenade of Sole.—Split a fine sole downwards, take out the bone, and lard the inside with strips of gherkins and truffles, then cover one half of the sole with the following forcemeat, which will be again covered by the remaining half of the sole; fasten them together with 4 splinter skewers, and bake with 4 or 5 spoonfuls of weak meat or fish gravy. Make the forcemeat of any dressed fish, crumbs of bread, the hard yolk of an egg, half a spoonful of boiled celery-root, half an anchovy, a spoonful of parsley, and half as much chervil, both finely minced, a little fat bacon or butter, and a raw egg, pepper and salt. When dressed, keep the fish hot, while the gravy it was baked in is warmed with a spoonful of caper-vinegar, and the same of the gherkin-liquor, to serve round it, with a few sliced gherkins. CROQUETTES OF FISH.—E. R. 289. —Take dressed fish of any kind, separate it from the bones, mince it with a little seasoning, an egg beaten with a teaspoonful of flour, and one of milk ; roll it into balls ; brush the outside with egg, and dredge it well with bread-crumbs, fry them of a nice colour: the bones, heads, tails, with an onion, an anchovy, and a pint of water, stewed together, will make the gravy. Lobsters make delicate croquettes; in which case the shell should be broken, and boiled down for the gravy. RISSOLES OF FISH.—E. R. 290. —Pick from the bones and skin any kind of cold fish, weigh it, and add one-third of grated bread-crumbs, a little cold melted butter, a small onion, previously boiled and finelyChap. XVI.] 279 FISH. minced, pepper, salt, and tlie yolks of 2 eggs to bind it together. Roll out thin some trimmings of puff-paste, cut it in 2-inch square pieces, put in the middle of each a teaspoon- ful of the mince; wet, and fold the paste over them, having cut them out with a cutter. Egg them, and dip them in bread-crumbs, fry in lard, and serve dry, garnished with fried parsley. See that the edges of the paste be perfectly closed. CASSEROLE OFFISH 291.—Is a title given, among others, by French cooks, to “poisson recliaujfe,” or fish which has been left after being dressed, and is meant to be re-heated. There are almost as many modes of doing this, as of originally dressing the various sorts ; but we here only retain a few of the most simple :— Take any kind of cold fish, and divide it into large flakes ; boil 2 or 3 eggs hard, and cut them into slices ; have also some mashed potatoes; butter a mould, and put in the fish, eggs, and potatoes, with a little delicate seasoning of white pepper; moisten the whole with cream, or thin melted butter, and a spoonful of essence of anchovies; boil the mould and turn it out. Or:—Take some fish which has been dressed, and rub it through a sieve; to ? lb. of fish allow t lb. of bread-crumbs, 2 eggs well beaten, 1 tablespoonful of essence of anchovies, 1 of Harvey sauce, and a little salt and cayenne pepper; mix all well together, and put it into a mould ; let it boil i an hour, and serve it with a good fish-sauce in the dish. Or :—Take pint of good gravy , with a couple of glasses of wine, 2 tablespoonfuls of anchovy liquor, and 2 of vinegar, seasoned high with cayenne, mustard, salt, and shalot; mince the fish, but do not put it in the mortar, and either warm it as a fricassee, and bring it up in a dish with sippets; or, put it into a form, piled up high in the centre, cover it with bread- crumbs and bits of butter, and brown it with a salamander. FISH TUR TLE.—E. R. 292—For this imitation,. sturgeon is the best material, but, if not in season, cut some ling into handsome pieces, and fry it; then boil an equal quantity of skate, also cut in pieces; and having cleaned and soaked 2 oi' 3 cod-sounds, stew them until green with a little spinach, and cut them into pieces \MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XYI. 280 then have a sufficient quantity of good gravy, into which the liquor of 2 or 3 dozen of oysters has been strained ; thicken it with cream or butter: put it into a stewpan with the fish already named, a lobster cut in pieces, a spoonful of essence of anchovies, and a glass of Madeira. Warm the whole together, and send it to table with a lemon garnish. The sauce to this dish must be very rich, and of a fine dark colour. FISH PA TE. 293. —This is a pretty mode of enclosing a fricassee of fish with a potato wall without a crust of pastry. Mash in a mortar as many potatoes as you may want, with a good piece of butter; then, with the bowls of 2 silver spoons, raise a wall of it inches high within the rim of the dish to be used. Let the upper part be a little thinner than the lower; smooth it; and, after brushing it all over with egg, put it into the oven to become hot, and a little coloured. Before egging it, the outside may be ornamented with flowers, leaves, &c., by the small tin shapes used to cut paste. Beat the whole of a crab picked clean from the shell in a marble mortar, with white pepper and salt, nutmeg, and a very few crumbs of bread; warm it with a little gravy thickened with cream or butter and a spoonful of wine, and, when thoroughly warmed, add a little lemon-juice. Pour it into potato walls previously baked, but not covered like a pie, and serve it up hot, either browning it with the salamander, or covering the top with fancifully arranged small claws. FISH CAKE. 294. —Cut the meat from the bones, put them, the head and fins, over the fire to stew for gravy, with a pint of water, an onion, herbs, pepper, and salt. Mince the meat, put to it | part of crumbs of bread, a little minced onion, parsley, pepper, salt, and a very small bit of mace: mix well, and make it into a cake with white of egg and a little melted butter; cover it with raspings, and fry it a pale brown, keeping a plate on the top while doing. Then lay it in a stewpan, with the fish gravy, and stew it gently i of an hour; turn it twice, but with great care not to break it: cover it closely while stewing. Cake of dressed meat, done in the same way, is remarkably good.FISH. Chap. XVI.] 281 FISH-CUTLETS.—E. It. 295. —Chop a considerable quantity of herbs with a small piece of shalot, season it with pepper and salt, and put it into a stewpan with 2 oz. of butter; as the butter is melting add a teaspoonful of essence of anchovies. Do not allow the butter to more than melt, and mix the whole well together ; then cut any kind of white fish, dressed or raw, into handsome cutlets, and, when the herb seasoning is nearly cold, spread it on the fish thickly with a knife; dredge the fish with bread-crumbs, and cook them on butter-pans in an oven, or before the fire. Stew a few silver button-onions, or a chopped onion, with any green vegetables in season, cut it into dice in a little broth, i add nasturtiums and a little of the pickle; keep them in the middle of a dish, and lay the cutlets round. Or:—Take any fish previously dressed, pull it in pieces, and mix it with a little good stock, and any fish sauce which may have been left from table ; spread it on a flat dish, brush it with egg and sprinkle thick with bread-crumbs, cut it out ! in cutlets, and fry brown. KEDGEREE FOR BREAKFAST. 296. —Boil 2 tablespoonfuls of rice, add any fish previously cooked (salmon or turbot is preferable), and nicely picked ; beat up an egg well, and stir it in just before serving. The I egg must not boil. FRICANDELLES OF FISH. 297. —Fake any quantity that may be convenient of either dressed or undressed fish of firm quality; skin and bone it; mince it of the size of dice, with a few anchovies, say 2 to each pound, seasoned with mace, cayenne, and a grating of nutmeg; soak the crumb of a French roll, 1 to each pound, in milk, and beat it up with the yolks of 2 eggs to each roll, so as to make it into a puree, and put the fish into it; warm the whole gently, and add to it a moderate quantity of cream. Put the fish thus prepared into a buttered mould, cover it thickly with bread-crumbs, and either bake it in a Dutch oven, or warm it before the fire, and brown it with the i salamander. A few oysters are an excellent addition; and if wine be282 MODERN- DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVI. employed instead of milk, the dish may be dressed in the same manner, but rather more highly seasoned. A MA TEL 0 TE OF FISH. 298. —Take carp or tench, or both, together with an eel and any small fish; cut them into pieces, and put them along with a quantity of button-onions into a stewpan containing just wine or gravy enough of any sort to cover them, and let them stew very gently until nearly done; then have ready a couple of minced truffles and a good handful of shrimps to mix into the sauce, which may be made of either white or red wine: the red may be made the more savoury, but the white wine will be found the most delicate: it should be thickened with yolk of egg, and the dish garnished with sippets of fried bread. RAGOUT OF FISH. 299. —Take carp, tench, perch, pike, and eels; clean and scale them well, and cut them into pieces for serving; put in your stewpan a good-sized piece of butter, let it fry to a pale brown, fry some flour in it, and add a quart or two of good bouillon with a glass or two of red wine, and a few cloves and onions. When boiling, put your ragout into it, let it well boil, and add some lemon-juice before serving it up. A VOL-AU-VENT 300. —Of fish, of any sort, is an elegant side-dish when pre- pared either with meat gravy or made up maigre. Muscles also make an excellent vol-au-vent. STEWED FISH, HEBREW FASHION.—E. R. 301. —Take 3 or 4 parsley-roots, cut them into long tliin slices, and 2 or 3 onions also sliced, boil them together in a quart of water until quite tender; then flavour it with ground white pepper, nutmeg, mace, and a little saffron, the juice of 2 lemons, and a spoonful of vinegar. Put in the fish, and let it stew for 20 or 30 minutes; then take it out, strain the gravy, thicken it with a little flour and butter, have balls made of chopped fish, bread-crumbs, spices, and the yolk of 1 or 2 eggs mixed up together, and drop them into the liquor. Let them boil, then put in the fish, and serve it up with the balls and parsley-roots.FISH. Chap. XVI.] 283 FISH CURRY 302. —Is prepared in the same way as chicken or rabbit, with this difference only, that the stock should be invariably composed of fish broth. For potting, collaring, and pickling, as well as for fish- sauces, look to the several receipts under those heads. When flour is made use of in the preparation of fish-stews or sauces, potato-flour is preferable to that made from wheat; and in making them up, always use a wooden in preference to a silver spoon. TO PRESERVE FISH FRESH. 303. —Boil together 3 quarts of water and a pint of vinegar, j in which, when quite boiling, put the fish, and just scald it, but not for more than 2 minutes. Then hang up the fish in a cool place, and it will keep for 2 or 3 days, and dress as well ] as if fresh caught. It will be seen that several of the fish receipts here given make excellent side-dishes. It was formerly the English i custom only to admit fish in the first course, but this is no longer the case, since it now appears at many fashionable tables as a side-dish in all stages of the dinner. I *284 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVII. CHAPTER XVII. GRAVY, SAUCES, AND CURRY. There is nothing that requires more attention on the part of the cook than the sauces which are wanted to all made dishes ; and those who are clever and economical will always contrive to procure the basis of these sauces in the manner pointed out in various parts of this volume. Where a calf’s head or a breast of veal is stewed, nothing more will be required, as both will yield an abundant supply, and it will only be necessary to give it the proper flavour with ham, or beef-bone, and ketchup. GRAVY May be made quite as good of the skirts of beef, kidney, or milt, or of the liver of a fat ox, as of any other kind of meat, if cut in pieces, fried with onions, and seasoned with herbs and spices, as other gravies. A clever servant will contrive to supply, at a trifling expense, as much gravy as is wanted for the use of a small family by stewing down the trimmings of meat and bones. It may even be made of the shank-bones of legs and shoulders of mutton: they should be thrown into water, and, after a good soaking and brushing, be long boiled. The water in which they are done will add greatly to the richness of gravy, as does the jelly of cow-heels. The latter must lie all night in water, which causes the jelly to be of a good colour. When boiled 3 hours, and become cold, let the fat be carefully taken off; and when apparently quite clear, lay some white paper upon it, rubbing it close with a spoon, which will remove every particle of grease, and it will be as pure as the jelly of a calf’s foot. In preparing meat to stew for gravy, beat it witli a mallet or rolling-pin, and score it across in various places, as this will make it give out its juices; season it with pepper and salt, and put it into a stewpan with butter only, heating it gradu- ally until it becomes brown, but shaking the pan frequentlyChap. XVII.] GRAVY, SAUCES, AND CURRY. 285 to see that it does not burn or stick to the bottom. It will generally be browned sufficiently in i an hour. If kept in a very cool place and covered closely in a stone jar, it will keep good for 2 or 3 days in summer, and more than a week in winter, but should not be thickened until it is meant to be used. Tarragon and knotted marjoram, by some called “London thyme,” are a great improvement to gravies, as also all those condiments enumerated in the chapter on soups, but should be added only a short time before serving. Truffles and morels also thicken and improve the flavour of gravies and soups : i oz. being carefully washed of each, simmer them in a pint of water, and add the whole. In the preparation of large dinners for company, it is indis- pensable to procure strong gravy to colour and impart flavour to sauces and ragouts, and this can be done by using coarse pieces of the lean of beef or veal, and the giblets or trimmings of poultry and game, with a small portion of a knuckle of ham; but for this purpose it must be stewed for a long time, skimmed, strained, thickened, and afterwards flavoured with whatever condiments are most suited to the dish it is to accompany. STOCK FOR GRAVY. 304.—A good mode of making stock for gravies is to cut lean beef thin, put it into a gravy pot without any butter or fat, and set it on a fire covered, but take care it does not burn; let it stay till all the gravy that comes out of the meat is dried up into it again, often shaking it; put as much water as will cover the meat, and let that stew away. Then put to the meat a small quantity of water, herbs, onions, spice, and a bit of lean ham; simmer till it is rich, and keep it in a cool place. Do not take off the fat till going to be used. Or, an excellent stock may be made in this manner:—Put into a casserole 3 oz. of butter, 4 large carrots, 6 middling Gravy Pot.286 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XYII. onions, 3 roots of parsley sliced, a small sprig of thyme, 3 cloves, 3 bay-leaves, 2 lbs. of roach, bream, or dace, cut small, with salt, pepper, and i a bottle of white (but not sweet) wine, and nearly as much broth. Cover close, and simmer until the whole be mashed: strain it through a fine sieve. In another casserole stew a pint of mushrooms, a little parsley and chibols, in £ pint of water, till the flavour of all be obtained: strain both liquors, and heat them together. A GRAVY WITHOUT MEAT. 305. —Put a glass of small beer, a glass of water, some pepper, salt, lemon-peel grated, a bruised clove or two, and a tablespoonful of walnut-pickle, into a basin; slice an onion, flour, and fry it in a piece of butter till it is brown; turn all the above into a small tosser with the onion; cover it, and let it simmer 20 minutes; strain it, and when cold take off the fat. GRA VY FOR A HA UNCH OF VENISON. 306. —Cut off the fat from 2 or 3 lbs. of a loin of old mutton, and set it in steaks on a gridiron for a few minutes, just to brown one side; put them into a saucepan with a quart of water, cover quite close for an hour, and simmer it gently; then uncover it, and stew till the gravy is reduced to a pint; season with salt only. GRAVY TO MAKE MUTTON EAT LIKE VENISON. 307. —Pick a very stale woodcock or snipe, cut it in pieces (but first take out the bag from the entrails), and simmer with as much unseasoned meat-gravy as you will want. Strain it, and serve in the dish; but if the mutton be not long kept, it will not acquire the venison flavour. VELOUTE. 308. —Take 1 lb. of veal, with the remains of a fowl and a dozen of full-grown mushrooms, or a smaller number of green truffles; heat these in melted butter, or beef fat, without browning ; season with salt, pepper, nutmeg, or mixed spices, to which may be added a couple of carrots and onions, with a tablespoonful or two of flour. When boiled, skim off the fat, and let it simmer for 1£ hour, after which strain it, and keep it closely stopped for further use. Essence of Ham, for improving the flavour of sauces, isChap. XVII.] GRAVY, SAUCES, AND CURRY. 281 also made in nearly the same manner—the mea t being stripped from the bone, and put into a saucepan with the bone broken in small pieces, then stewed in a small quantity of water for several hours until the liquor becomes thick ; alter which it is strained, and again stewed with about the same quantity of very strong and well-spiced veal-gravy. If caretully bottled and corked it will remain good for a long time, and a spoonful or two will be frequently found a useful addition. For White Meat.—Peel a lemon close to the juice, cut it into slices, and then into square bits; blanch the liver of a fowl, and chop it small; mix the lemon and liver in a boat; pour hot melted butter over the mixture, and stir it together, but do not let it boil, or it will become oily. Or:—Put the peel of a small lemon, cut very thin, into a pint of sweet rich cream, with a sprig of lemon-thyme and 10 white peppercorns; simmer gently till it tastes well of the lemon, then strain it, and thicken it with t lb. of butter, and a dessertspoonful of flour rubbed in it; boil it up, then pour the juice of the lemon strained into it, stirring it well. A RICH GRAVY. 309.—Cut beef into thin slices, according to the quantity wanted ; slice onions thin, and flour both ; fry them of a light pale brown, but do not on any account suffer them to get black : put them into a stewpan, pour boiling water on the browning in the frying-pan, boil it up, and pour on the meat. Put to it a bunch of parsley, thyme, and savory, a small bit of knotted marjoram, the same of tarragon, some mace, berries of all- spice, whole black peppers, a clove or two, and a bit of ham, or gammon of bacon. Simmer till you have extracted all the juices of the meat, and be sure to skim the moment it boils, and often after. If for a hare, or stewed fish, anchovy should be added. SAUCES. MELTED BUTTER. 310.— Although it may be presumed that every cook who understands her business knows how to melt butter, it is yet constantly brought to table either too thick or too thin, and not unfrequently filled witli lumps of flour or in a state of oil,288 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVII. and requires more care in the management than is generally thought necessary. The excellence of melted butter greatly depends upon the pains taken to blend it with the flour before it is put upon the fire, the best plan of doing which is to rub them together with a knife on a wooden trencher. When well mixed, add 2 tablespoonfuls of hot water, or the same quantity of milk; put it into a small pipkin, shaking it one way until it boils, and not leaving it an instant; it must boil a minute to take off the rawness, and if made of fresh butter add a little salt. Remember that if you set it on the hot coals, or over the fire, it will be oily; if the butter and flour be not well mixed, it will be lumpy; and if you put too much water, it will be thin and poor. By attending to these directions, and only using sufficient flour to prevent the butter from oiling, it will be rich and smooth. Or :—Mix together by degrees 2 spoonfuls of flour in cold water; make it smooth and thin ; then put on a pint of water, let it boil, stir in the flour and water to make it the required thickness, cut i lb. of fresh butter in small pieces, put it into the flour and water, let it boil well; it is then fit for use; a pinch of salt may be required. When thin melted butter is required to pour over puddings, roast veal, &c., make it the same way, adding a larger pro- portion of water or milk, the latter rendering it rather whiter than the water; and if meant to be more rich than common, use cream instead of milk. Indeed the French frequently en- rich melted butter by adding the yolk of a raw egg. Maitre d'Hotel Butter.—Put } lb. of fresh butter upon a plate, the juice of 2 lemons, and 2 large tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley, t a teaspoonful of salt, and h that quantity of white pepper; mix all well together, and keep in a cool place for use. To brown Melted Butter.—Put a lump of butter into a fryingpan, and toss it round over the fire until it becomes brown ; then dredge some flour over it, which has been also browned by putting it either in the oven or before the fire, and stir it round with a spoon until the butter boils. By adding some of the flavoured vinegars and compound sauces to melted butter thus prepared, most of the fish-sauces can be made, and many of those in common use are com- posed in this simple manner.Chap. XYII.] GRAVY, SAUCES, AND CURRY. 289 Parsley and Butter.—Scald a large handful of parsley in boiling water that has some salt in it; when tender chop it-fine, and stir it into some rather thick melted butter. There should be sufficient parsley to make the sauce green, and the parsley should not be put to the melted butter until about to be served, otherwise it will turn brown. Fennel Sauce.—Proceed as for parsley and butter. The first is used for the various purposes of fish, poultry, and fresh boiled meats; fennel mostly for mackerel. Caper Sauce, white.—Put whole capers into melted butter, adding a little of the vinegar they are pickled in, a pint of salt, and sufficient cream to make it white. This is used principally for boiled mutton. Caper Sauce, brown.—Take some thick brown sauce, add- ing the vinegar the capers are pickled in ; season it highly with cayenne and salt. Put capers to the sauce just before serving ; and they must be used liberally. Nasturtium buds or seeds are sometimes used as a substitute. EGG SAUCE. 311. —Boil the eggs hard, cut them in small dice, and put the pieces into melted butter. The yolk may however be crushed to a powder, and used to thicken the butter. Or, if a more savoury sauce is required, boil 2 eggs hard, mince them very fine, add a third portion of grated ham or tongue, a very little white pepper, and the juice of a lemon ; warm it up in melted butter. It is chiefly used for roast fowl and salt codfish ; and if the butter be sound, the salted will be found quite as good for all these purposes as the fresh. GARLIC SAUCE.—E. R. t 312. —Peel the garlic, divide it into cloves, boil it for 5 minutes in water, then pour it off; add boiling water, and boil it 5 minutes longer; repeat the process a third and fourth time, then strain the garlic, and send it to table in white sauce. The strength of the flavour may be either increased or diminished according to the length of time in boiling. In Languedoc, and many other parts of France, it is made by pounding the cloves in a mortar, and adding sweet oil until it is thus made into a paste of the appearance of cream, and is eaten with all sorts of meat, both roast and boiled. If not, used as sauce, the cloves will be found very delicate if served as a vegetable. If properly done, it will taste like almonds. uMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XYII. 290 ONION SAUCE. 313. — White.—Peel the onions, and put them on the fire in cold water; when it boils, pour the water off, and fill up the saucepan from a kettle of boiling water to take out the strength of the onions. If this be done two or three times, they will become perfectly mild ; or if they be Spanish onions, boil them only once in milk ; then chop them, not too small, but so as to divide the pieces into flakes ; add to them butter that has been melted, rich, smooth, and thick. It is used to smother boiled rabbits, ducks, and tripe, or as sauce for a roast shoulder of mutton. Or beat the onions to a pulp, and pass them through a sieve to thicken the sauce, and make it appear like cream ; although this would appear more delicate, yet many people prefer the fonner mode. Brown.—Peel and slice some large onions, and put them into a stewpan with a piece of butter. Stir them over the fire until they are of a fine light brown ; dust them with flour; then put in a pint of good beef-gravy, with a little cayenne pepper and sauce ; when thus reduced by stewing to the proper thick- ness, rub them through the colander; and just before serving up, squeeze in the juice of i a lemon, or serve without rubbing- through the colander. This is preferable for roast meats. SHALOT SAUCE. 314. —Put a few chopped shalots into a little gravy, boiled clear, and nearly half as much vinegar ; season with pepper and salt; boil ir an hour. 4 SAUCE FOR RUMP-STEAK. 315. —Take equal parts of ale, red wine, and ketchup, a piece of butter, and a little pepper, with a teaspoonful of garlic-vinegar; stir these over the fire in a small saucepan, and pour it very hot upon the steak. It will form a pleasant addition to the gravy of any roast meat, and can be made in a few minutes. SAUCE ROBERT. 316. —Put a piece of butter, the size of an egg, into a sauce- pan ; set it over the fire, and when browning throw in a handful of onions cut in small dice ; fry them brown, but do not let them burn; add i a spoonful of flour, shake the onions in it, and give it another fry ; then put 4 spoonfuls of gravy, and some pepper and salt, and boil it gently 1.0 minutes;Chap. XVII.] GRAVY, SAUCES, AND CURRY. 291 skim it. When ready to serve, add a teaspoonful of made mustard, a spoonful of vinegar, and the juice of i a lemon, , and pour it round the steaks or chops. They should be of a fine yellow brown, and garnished with fried parsley and lemon. The sauce must not boil after the mustard is put in, otherwise it will curdle. SAUCES FOR ROAST BEEF OR MUTTON. 317.—Grate horseradish on a bread-grater into a basin, then add 2 tablespoonfuls of cream with a little mustard and salt ; mix them well together; then add 4 tablespoonfuls of the best vinegar, and mix the whole thoroughly. The vinegar and cream are both to be cold. This is a very fine sauce; it may be served in a small tureen. Or :—Scrape the horseradish thin and chop it small, or grate it, which is better; warm it in melted butter, adding a spoonful of mushroom ketchup, and one of walnut, or the vinegar from walnut pickle. Or :—Scrape very fine or grate the horseradish ; add a little made mustard, and 2 spoonfuls of pounded white sugar to 4 of vinegar: mix the whole well together, and place it under the meat, when nearly done, to catch the gravy which drops from it while roasting. This sauce should be very thick. Queen Mary’s Sauce.—Take a shoulder of mutton that has hung till it is tender. When three parts roasted, put a soup-plate under it, with 3 spoonfuls of hot water, the same of port wine, a shalot, an anchovy chopped fine, and a little pepper; baste the meat with this and the gravy that drops from it. When the mutton is taken up, turn the inside up- wards, score it various ways, pour the gravy over, and cover it with a quantity of fried crumbs of bread. Mandram is a sauce commonly used in the West Indies with roast beef and mutton. It is made with a sliced cucum- ber, a chopped shalot, and a minced green capsicum, mixed up in a couple of tablespoonfuls of Madeira wine and vinegar ; and as capsicums can be had green during great part of the autumn, it can be also made in England, but neither chilis nor capsicums, if dried, will impart the same flavour.

MUSHROOM SA UCE. 319. — White.—Put the mushrooms into a stewpan with 1 oz. of butter, some pepper and salt, and squeeze over them the juice of ir a lemon ; set them over the fire ; when they have given out their liquor, thicken it with flour and butter, and add suf- ficient cream to whiten the sauce. This is a very excellent sauce for fowls, rabbits, and all sorts of white fricassees. Or:—Wash and pick a pint of young mushrooms, and rub them with salt, to take off the tender skin; put them into a saucepan with a little salt, some nutmeg, a blade of mace, a pint of cream, and a good piece of butter rubbed in flour. Boil them up, and stir them till done; then pour it round the chickens, &c. Garnish with lemon. If you cannot get fresh mushrooms, use pickled ones, done white, with a little mushroom-powder with the cream. Brown.—It may also be made brown by either putting the buttons into a pipkin, and frying them with a little butter until they become of a delicate brown, and then stewing them in strong gravy of either beef or veal; or by making it of old mushrooms chopped small, fried and stewed in the same manner, and then seasoned according to taste. It is much used for cutlets and many sorts of ragouts. CELERY SAUCE. 320. —Strip the outer parts of the stem, and, after carefully washing the remaining portion, cut it into small pieces; put to it a blade of mace, without any other spice, and stew it in good veal broth until very tender; it will take a good deal of time, more particularly the thick hard end of the root. After this thicken it with melted butter, and flavour it with a small quantity of white wine; or it may be thickened with boiled cream without wine. It is usually served with boiled turkey, but is very delicate with any kind of white poultry or veal. Or:—Take the white part of 3 heads of celery, cut them in pieces 2 inches long ; boil them in a very little good white broth ; slice an onion thin ; put it in a stewpan with a little parsley and thyme, and a scrap of lean ham, or the ham may be omitted. Sweat the whole in a little butter until the onionsChap. XVII.] GRAVY, SAUCES, AND CURRY. 293 are done, then stir in sufficient flour to thicken the sauce ; stir it over the fire well, then mix in gradually the liquor the celery was boiled in, and as much new milk boiling as may be required for the dish. Let it boil 20 minutes ; strain through a fine sieve; put in the celery; add salt and a little fine white sugar; serve boiling hot, and rather thick. Til UFFLE SA UCE. 321. —Take a pound of truffles ; brush and wash them care- fully ; put them in a stewpan with some good gravy, two wine- glasses of white wine, a small onion, a faggot of parsley and thyme, and an ounce of bacon fat. Let them stew gently until quite tender; take them out, strain and skim the gravy, thicken it with roux or a lump of flour and butter ; peel the truffles, cut them in slices as thick as a penny-piece, warm them in the sauce, and serve. CHES TNUT SA UCE. 322. —Scald a score of chestnuts in hot water for 10 minutes ; skim them ; let them stew gently for about i an hour in some good gravy seasoned with a glass of white wine, a little white pepper, salt, and mace or nutmeg; and when quite soft, serve them in the dish. Or :—Pulp them through a colander to thicken the gravy, making it either brown or white, by using in the former beef- (jrcLvy, and in the latter veal-broth, with pounded almonds, and without pepper. Either of these is equally fit for sauce to guinea-bird or turkey, as well as for stuffing the body of the bird. SAUCES FOR WHITE POULTRY BOILED—E. R. 323. —Liver-sauce.—Take the livers of as many fowls as may be required for the intended quantity of sauce, or, that of a rabbit being much larger, take 1 liver, boil it with some sprigs of thyme and parsley ; dissolve in the water, after taking it out, 2 anchovies boned; boil 2 eggs hard, leave out 1 white, and shred the rest with the liver, herbs, and anchovies; pound them together in a mortar, adding a saltspoonful of grated lemon-peel and a little pepper and salt. Put it into the saucepan, squeeze upon it. the juice of ^ a lemon, thicken the liquor with butter and a little flour, add to it the pounded ingredients, and stir it until finished. 1 (JravH be used instead of water, and butter be A %. .

White Sauce.—Boil a large blade of mace, a few cloves and peppercorns, in a pint of soft water, until the flavour be ob- tained ; strain it off', put it into a saucepan with 4 anchovies chopped fine, i lb. of butter rolled in flour, and 1 a pint of cream ; boil, and stir it well, 2 minutes. Put some in a tureen, and the remainder in the dish. For Chickens.—Take the legs and necks, with a small bit of the scrag of veal or mutton ; put them into a saucepan with 2 blades of mace, a few white peppercorns, an anchovy, a head of celery sliced, a bunch of sweet herbs, and a small bit of lemon-peel; boil these in a quart of water to 4 a pint; strain, and thicken it with i lb. of butter and some flour; boil it 5 minutes, then put in 2 spoonfuls of mushrooms, and, having beaten up the yolks of 2 eggs with a teacupful of cream, put it into the sauce, and keep shaking it one way over the fire till it is nearly boiling; then put it into a sauce-tureen. Vegetable Marrow Sauce.—Few sauces are more delicate as an accompaniment for young chickens, whether roast or boiled, than vegetable marrow when deprived of its seeds, if stewed to a pulp and passed through a fine sieve, so as to form it into a puree, which may be then thinned either with fowl- broth seasoned with mace, or with cream and nutmeg. SA UCES FOR R OAS T FO WLS. 324.—Stew any moderate quantity of ham, veal, and mush- rooms, with sweet herbs, a shalot, a little allspice, and a piece of butter, until all become brown; then let the whole simmer gently for a long time in either weak broth or water, until they form a strong gravy; strain it, and season it with any addi- tional flavour that may be given by some of the made sauces. Serve hot in a sauce-tureen. Or:—Put into a small stewpan 2 slices of ham, a clove of garlic, a laurel-leaf, and sliced onions ; add a little good gravy, a sprig of knotted marjoram, and a spoonful of tarragon vine- gar ; simmer slowly an hour, strain off, and put into the dish or a boat. Or :—Boil some veal-gravy, pepper, salt, the juice of a Seville orange and a lemon, and i as much of port wine as of gravy; and pour it into the dish or a boat.295 Chap. XVII.] GRAVY, SAUCES, AND CURRY. Or:—If wanted in a hurry, cut a few slices of calf’s liver, or any kind of brown meat; fry them with a little lean bacon and an onion, and, when browned, pour upon them boiling water to what strength you please, and strain it. WHITE SA UCE. 325. —It is seldom necessary to buy meat for this favourite sauce, as the proportion of that flavour is but small. I he water that has boiled fowls, veal, or rabbit, or a little broth that may be in the house, or the feet and necks ol chickens, or raw or dressed veal, will suffice. Stew any of these with a little water, a bit of lemon-peel, some sliced onion, a few white peppercorns, a little pounded mace or nutmeg, and a bunch of sweet herbs, until the flavour be good ; then strain it, add a little good cream, a piece of butter, and a little flour: salt to your taste. A squeeze of lemon may be added after the sauce is taken off' the fire, shaking it well. Yolk of egg is often used in fricassee ; but if you have any cream it is better, as the former is apt to curdle. Or :■—Boil a stick of celery and a bunch of parsley in a pint of milk, adding white pepper and a little salt; then put 2 oz. of butter into a saucepan, let it melt, add to it an onion sliced thin, dredge in flour until it is a paste, but do not allow it to become brown. Strain the milk, and add it by degrees to the butter and flour, stirring it very well; then boil the whole together, stirring all the time, and boiling it until it is quite thick and smooth ; pass it through a fine sieve or tammy. If wanted to be very rich, let it cool a little, and then add an egg previously beaten, and mix very gradually ; warm it over the fire, stirring it well, but do not let it boil, or it will curdle. Or:—Mix a teaspoonful of flour with i lb. of butter, a little salt, and ground white pepper ; let them be well blended to- gether with a wooden spoon, then add a spoonful of vinegar, and 1 or 2 of water; mix the whole together, stirring it one way over the fire. CULLIS. 326. —Lay over the bottom of a stewpan as much lean, veal as will cover it an inch thick : cover the veal with thin, slices of undressed gammon, 2 or 3 onions, 2 or 3 bay-leaves,, some sweet herbs, 2 blades of mace, and a few cloves.

When the meat is of a fine brown, fill the pan with good beef broth, boil and skim it, then simmer an hour; add a little water, mixed with as much flour as will make it properly thick ; boil it 4 an hour, and strain it. This will keep a week. ROUX. 327.— White.—Put 2 oz. of butter into a stewpan over a slow fire, allow it to melt, then drain off the buttermilk : make it into a paste by dredging- flour over it, and keep it on the fire for 1 of an hour, taking care that it does not lose its colour. jBrown is made in the same manner, only allowed to fry of a dark colour. French cooks use no other kind of browning. LIAISON. 328. — To thicken or enrich White or Fish Soups, use the following :—Pour the soup, boiling hot, on the beaten yolks of 2 or 3 fresh eggs, from which the small tough substance found in it, and called “ the tread,” should be removed, nor should the soup be suffered to boil after the eggs are added, as it is then apt to curdle. Or :—Break the yolk of an egg with 3 spoonfuls of cream, beat them up in the tureen and pour the boiling soup upon it. This may be made in the same proportion, and kept in a basin for other dishes. SAUCE FOR FRICANDEAU, OR ROAST VEAL. 329. —Boil an unwashed anchovy cut small, with a cup of gravy, a glass of port wine, a slialot minced, and the juice of £ a small lemon ; strain, and mix in the dish with the gravy of the meat. Or use sorrel sauce (No. 428). SAUCE A LA MAITRE D'HOTEL. 330. —Put 8 tablespoonfuls of white sauce in a stewpan with 4 of milk ; boil it 5 minutes, then stir in 3 oz. of maitre d’hotel butter (No. 310); stir it quickly over the fire till the butter is melted, but do not let it boil. This sauce should be made at the time of serving.Chap. XVII.] GEAVY, SAUCES, AND CURRY. 297 SAUCES FOR GEESE. 331. —For a Green Goose.—Take i pint of sorrel-juice, 2 glasses of white wine, a nutmeg quartered, a cupful of fried crumbs, and 2 lumps of sugar ; let all boil together, then beat it smooth, adding a piece of fresh butter, and serve it very hot in a tureen, or in the dish with the goose. It should not be made too thick with the bread-crumbs; and if much acid should not be approved, the wine must be equal in quantity to the sorrel-juice. Gooseberry Sauce.—Wash some sorrel, put it into a cloth and press out the juice; melt a piece of butter with flour, using this juice instead of water ; let it be very thick. Scald green gooseberries until very tender, and add them to the sauce. This is a fine acid sauce if not spoiled with sugar. If not sweetened, add a little cayenne pepper. For a Stubble Goose.—Mix a teaspoonful of made mustard, i a teaspoonful of salt, with a very little cayenne pepper, in a large wineglassful of port wine, a tablespoonful of mush- room ketchup, i pint of gravy, 2 teaspoonfuls of lemon-juice, and a bit of butter rolled in flour; stir and mix all thoroughly over the fire, and serve very hot in a sauceboat. Apple Sauce.—Pare, core, and slice some apples ; and put them in a stone jar, into a saucepan of water, or on a hot hearth. If on a hearth, let a spoonful or two of water be put in to hinder them from burning. When they are done, bruise them to a mash, and put to them a piece of butter the size of a nutmeg, and a little brown sugar if required ; but it destroys the slight acid flavour of the apples, and its corrective to goose and pork. Savoury Apple Sauce.—Pulp the apples, and, if wanted of a good colour, add to them a little juice of beet-root or cochi- neal : season with cayenne pepper, and a glass of vinegar or lemon-pickle, taking care not to make it too acid. This will prove a substitute for tomata or sorrel sauce, when neither can be obtained; if for the latter, a little spinach-juice will give it a colour. SAUCE FOR DUCKLINGS. 332. —Take young green onions or chives ; chop them very small, then put them into some thick melted butter, with pepper, salt, and a spoonful of lemon-pickle; stir it wellMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVII. 298 together, and, when very hot, put it into the dish with the ducks upon it. Should the flavour of the onions be thought too strong, they may be scalded previously. Or:—Mix i pint of sorrel-juice, a glass of white wine, some scalded gooseberries, some white sugar, and a bit of butter. Boil them up and serve in a boat. SAUCE FOR SUCKING-PIG. 333. —Take the inside of a French roll and boil it to a pulp, along with an onion and a little salt; chop the brains and put them into a teacupful of the gravy that runs from the pig ; then take as much butter as will be sufficient for the sauce, and put into it a good squeeze of lemon, with i a glass of white wine. Some cooks make a stuffing for the pig in nearly the same manner, only making it with less butter and more bread, besides sometimes seasoning it with sage. Currant Sauce.—Clean an ounce of currants, and boil them in if pint of water for a few minutes, pour the whole over a teacupful of bread-crumbs ; let it soak, and then add a piece of butter rolled in flour, 4 or 6 cloves, and a glass of port wine ; beat it a little, and stir it over the fire until it is quite smooth. SA UCES FOR WILD-FO WL. 334. —A teaspoonful of made mustard, the same of essence of anchovies and red pepper; a tablespoonful of ketchup, and a glass of claret. This receipt is from the Palace, and comes highly recommended. Or:—Simmer a teacupful of port wine, the same quantity of good meat gravy, a little shalot, a little pepper, salt, a grate of nutmeg, and a bit of mace, for 10 minutes: put in a bit of butter and flour, give it all one boil, and pour it through the birds. In general they are not stuffed, but may be done so if liked. Or:—Mince some shalots very fine, put them into a small saucepan with some peppercorns, 2 tablespoonfuls of strong clear gravy, and the same quantity of vinegar; when suf- ficiently boiled add a little salt, and strain it through a sieve. It may.be served either hot or cold. Shikaree Sauce.—Mix together a dessertspoonful of pounded white sugar, with the same quantity of cayenne pepper, or, if299 Chap. XV3L] GEAYY, SAUCES, AND CUEEY. the parties be averse to so much pepper, a tea or saltspoonful; add to it a glass of claret or port wine, a glass of ketchup, or a dessertspoonful of essence of anchovies, and the juice of 4 a large lemon. Warm it over the fire, and either serve it up in a butter-boat, or, having scored the breast of the duck, and laid a slice of butter upon it, pour the sauce over. Col. Hawker’s Sauce.—Port wine or claret 1 glass, sauce a la Russe a 1 tablespoonful, ketchup 1 tablespoonful, lemon- juice 1 tablespoonful, lemon-peel 1 slice, shalot (large) 1 sliced, cayenne (the darkest) 4 grains, mace 1 or 2 blades: to be scalded, strained, and added to the gravy which comes from the fowl in roasting. The addition of a small spoonful of sugar would render this equal to shikaree. LIVER SAUCE FOR HARE OR ROAST RABBIT. 335. —Stew the liver in some good gravy—of beef for hare, and of veal for rabbit—when quite tender chop it fine, with a clove of eschalot and some fine potherbs, along with a teaspoonful of chili-vinegar, a wineglass of port wine, and 4 a teacupful of currant-jelly, if for hare, or white wine only for rabbit. Or:—Pound the whole of the solid ingredients, and mix them in the gravy to thicken it, adding afterwards the vinegar and wine. Or:—Take the crumb of a penny roll and steep it in port wine, put it on the fire with a piece of butter; beat it smooth, add pepper, salt, and jelly, with 4 a glass of vinegar ; let it boil, and serve it up very hot. SAUCE FOR WINGED GAME. 336. —Put a glass of white wine, 4 a lemon sliced, or a des- sertspoonful of the juice, with a few strips of the peel of a Seville orange, and a spoonful of sweet oil, to a teacupful of the gravy which runs from the birds, seasoned with a clove of garlic, salt, and a few peppercorns. Boil it for 4 of an hour, skim it, strain it through a sieve, and serve it. If for grouse or black-cock, port should be substituted for white wine. BREAD SA UCE. 337. —Boil a large onion, cut into 4, with some whole black “ Sold Morel in Piccadilly, and by all dealers in foreign store sauces.300 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XYII. pepper, in milk, till the onion is quite a pap. Pour the milk strained on grated white stale bread, and cover it. In an hour put it into a saucepan, with a good piece of fresh butter ; boil the whole up together, and serve ; add a little salt. Or :—Take a large onion, slice it down very thin, put it into some broth or water, let it boil until tender; add a sufficient quantity of bread-crumbs to thicken it, 2 ounces of butter, pepper, and salt, and a little good cream ; boil it until it is thick and very smooth, but do not allow it to be too thick to pour into the sauce-tureen. Or Grate a teaspoonful of fresh onion and put it to the bread-crumbs before the boiling milk is poured over it. Season it, and add a few grains of cayenne pepper. SAUCE FOR COLD FOWL OR PARTRIDGE. 338. —Rub down in a mortar the yolks of 2 eggs boiled hard, an anchovy, 2 dessertspoonfuls of oil, 3 of vinegar, a shalot, cayenne if approved, and a teaspoonful of mustard. All should be pounded before the oil is added. Then strain it. Shalot-vinegar, instead of shalot, eats well; but then omit 1 spoonful of the common vinegar. Salt to your taste. A most excellent accompaniment to cold roast fowls, or white game of any sort, is to bring it up covered with either common or clouted cream; this is veiy customary throughout Devon and Cornwall. SA UCE A LA TAR TARE. 339. —Take the yolk of an egg, and drop into it very slowly a tablespoonful of sweet oilj beating it up by degrees until perfectly mixed; add a tablespoonful of vinegar, a little chopped parsley, a tablespoonful of French mustard, pepper, and salt; beat up the whole together: make and keep the sauce in a cold place; put it into a dish, and lay the boiled fowl upon it. This sauce should be beaten till it resembles cream. POIVRADE SAUCE. 340. —Chop 2 shalots, and bruise the yolk of a hard-boiled egg with a little salt and cayenne pepper; beat all up in a spoonful of mushroom or walnut ketchup, season with chili vinegar or the juice of lemon: to be made into proper con- sistence with melted butter if to be eaten hot, or with salad-301 Chap.

R. 341. —a a large Spanish onion, 4 capsicums, as much salt and lemon-juice as may be agreeable to the palate, all pounded together in a mortar. Fish Acha.—Boil a piece of salt fish, cut an onion and some capsicums in pieces, pound them well together, add a little vinegar, and make them into a puree. Indian-pickle Sauce.—Take some gravy, thicken with flour and butter; cut in small dice some Indian pickle, add a little of the vinegar, let it boil up, throw in the dice, and serve hot. This is for salmon cutlets ; it is also good for broiled mackerel or for grilled chicken. SAUCES PIQUANTES—E. R. 342. —Put into a stewpan the muscles of a knuckle of veal, some slices of ham or bacon, a cupful of gravy, a spoonful or two of'strong vinegar, a bayleaf, a clove of garlic, a little thyme, 1 clove, and a little salt; skim it, and, when it has stewed i of an hour, pass it through a sieve : then add sorrel, parsley, and mushrooms, all chopped fine, and whole capers; heat it again, and serve it in the dish. Or:—Put 1 or 2 oz. of butter, with 2 shred onions, a carrot, a parsnip, a little thyme, laurel, basil, 2 cloves, 2 shalots, a clove of garlic, and some parsley, into a stewpan ; turn the whole over the fire till it becomes brown, then shake in some flour, and moisten it with some broth and a spoonful of vinegar. Let it boil over a slow fire ; skim and strain it; then add pepper and salt; and serve with any dish of which you would wish to have the flavour heightened. A V Espagnole.—Besides a few slices of ham and veal, put into a stewpan any remains which you may have of poultry and game, and let them boil for 1 hour in water more than sufficient to cover them ; after which skim off the fat from the gravy, add fried onions,. sweet herbs, a bay-leaf, spice, mace, and mushrooms, with minced carrots, celery, shalots, and a small clove of garlic, and leave the whole to stew until quite mashed : it will take full 2 hours. Then strain it, and if the gravy be not strong enough add sufficient coulis or glaze toMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVII. 302 make it so. If it wants flavour, add soy, and, if mushrooms had not been one of the ingredients, put in ketchup : if not thick enough, a little arrowroot,jar common flour, with a piece of butter, will have the effect; but if the gravy be truly rich, it will not require the addition. Such is the foundation of the sauce; but in most cases white wine is added, for the purpose .of stewing game : it is needless to say that Madeira and sherry are best, but Cape or ginger wine will be found good substitutes. A la Provengale.—Put into a casserole 2 spoonfuls of sweet-oil, a shalot, a clove of garlic, and some mushrooms, all minced, and placed upon the fire in any sort of good strong broth, seasoned with pepper and salt, together with pot-herbs; leave it there for i an hour; then skim it so far as to remove much of the appearance of the oil; strain it, and add some white wine to suit the taste. Or, as Sauce Maigre:—Fry a large quantity of onions and put them along with the above into the casserole, with white wine, until well browned; then strain it; add a tablespoonful of salad-oil with a little flour, and mix it gently, but continually, for a few minutes, until completely mingled. A V Hollandaise—for meat, fowl, or fish. Put 6 spoonfuls of water and 2 of tarragon vinegar, with 1 oz. of butter, into a stewpan; warm and thicken it with the yolks of 2 eggs. Make it quite hot, but do not boil it; stir it all the time; squeeze in the juice of i a lemon, and strain it through a sieve. Season with salt and cayenne. It should be quite thick. TOM AT A SAUCE. 343.—Take i a dozen ripe tomatas; slice them; squeeze out the seeds and water, and put them, with salt, cayenne pepper, pounded mace, and allspice, into a stewpan, without any wrater, and let them simmer slowly in their own liquor till quite dissolved ; when completely done, pass them through a fine hair sieve, beat them up witli a bit of butter, and serve them, if necessary, with lemon-juice. A VItalienne.—Slice a couple of Spanish onions and i a dozen of tomatas into a stewpan, which, with a sprig of thyme, 2 bay-leaves, 6 pods of pimento, 2 teaspoonfuls of curry- powder, salt, and a cup of rich gravy, simmer very gently until303 Chap. XVII.] GRAVY, SAUCES, AND CURRY. the whole will pulp through a colander; stir well, that the sauce may not burn. A la Francaise.—Take 6 or 8 tomatas, cut them in 2 and across ; squeeze out the liquor, and put them into a stewpan ; add a sliced onion, a very small bit of garlic, a bay-leaf, a bunch of parsley, and a spoonful or two of vinegar. Boil the whole together, rub through a tamis sieve, thicken with flour and butter, and add a little glaze. Or;—Squeeze out the water, simmer the fruit with a little butter, salt, and pepper, until it will pulp as above. If too thin, reduce it by boiling. A minute or two before serving, add a little veloute and a bit of butter, and give it one boil ; or, even independently of the veloute, it will make an agree- able sauce for roast lamb. SAUCE AUX EPINARDS. 344. —'Pick off the stalks of the spinach ; wash and drain it; then, without water, stew till it will beat to a mash. Put in a good piece of butter and some milk ; simmer, and stir over a slow fire till the sauce be of the consistence of thick melted butter. Add a little pepper and salt while dressing. P UREE BE CONCOMBRES. 345. —Slice thin some middling-sized cucumbers, drain the liquor from them, and put them, with 4 onions, into a stewpan, with a piece of butter; when sufficiently stewed to pulp through a colander, add a large teacupful of cream, a little flour and pepper. Boil 20 minutes, and, when going to serve, put in salt. SAUCE A LA STE. MENEHOULD.—E. R. 346. —Put some butter into a stewpan, shake over it a little flour; add a cupful of cream, parsley, young onions, 4 a bay- leaf, and a shalot. Put it on the fire, keeping it stirred. Then pass it through a sieve: put it on the fire again with some chopped parsley, a little pepper, and minced mushrooms. Serve it over boiled fowls. LA MAGNONNAISE. .347.—Perhaps the most esteemed mode of making sauce for any sort of cold meats or fish is that known in France by this title.304 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XYII. Put into a round-bottomed basin the yolk of an egg and a pinch of salt; stir in very quickly, drop by drop,°2 table- spoonfuls of sweet oil, working the spooai very rapidly round, to work in the oil; when it is thick add a few drops of tar- ragon vinegar, then more oil, until there is sufficient sauce; thin it with a little more vinegar. It should be quite thick, and rather acid. CARA CHI.—E. R. 348. —Take 1 head of garlic and cut each clove into 2 pieces, 2 teaspoonfuls of cayenne pepper, 3 tablespoonfuls of soy, 3 of mushroom ketchup, 3 of walnut pickle, 6 anchovies dis- solved, 2 or 3 spoonfuls of mangoe or Indian pickle liquor, and a pint of the best vinegar, with sufficient cochineal to colour. Both the above are thus sauces maigres, but when not in- tended for fast-days may be much improved by being made into a puree with an admixture of melted calfs-foot jelly. SAUCE ROY ALE 349. —Is made by cutting a slice of white bread, and stewing it in white broth until it is quite thick ; then take it off the fire ; pound in a mortar the yolks of 2 hard-boiled eggs, and 4 a dozen almonds reduced to paste, with the breast of a cold roast fowl; mix this with the eggs and bread, and pound them all together with a little pepper and salt; add a sufficient quantity of cream to make it of a proper consistence, and simmer the whole over the fire, stirring it all the time without letting it boil. Sauce a la Heine is nearly the same.—Bruise the breast of a chicken to a paste, and moisten it with a consomme of veal or fowl broth; let it stew gently over a slow fire, and then pass it through the tamis and mix with it some bechamel sauce. Then have ready the yolks of 2 eggs beaten up with a large spoonful of thick cream, ^pd stir the mixture into the sauce a minute or two before serving it up. Both the above are served at the most fashionable tables, and may be used with turkey-poults and guinea-birds.

It is eaten with cold meat, but will not keep. CHE TNEY AND Q UIHI SA UCE. 351. —Take 8 oz. of sharp apples pared and cored, 8 oz. of tomatas, 8 oz. of salt, 8 oz. of brown sugar, 8 oz. of raisins, 4 oz. of red chilis, 4 oz. of ginger powdered, 2 oz. of garlic, and 2 oz. of shalots. Pound all these ingredients separately in a mortar, using cayenne pepper if chilis are not to be had. Mix the whole together, and add 3 quarts of vinegar and 1 quart of lemon-juice. Place the jar containing this composition on a stove, or by the side of a fire in a heat not less than 130° Fahrenheit, and stir it twice a-day for a month; then strain, but do not squeeze it dry. Bottle the liquor, which is an excellent sauce for any kind of fish or meat, hot or cold. A teaspoonful will impart a fine flavour to any ragout, or be sufficient for a pint of broth. The residue, which is the chet- n'ey, should be put into pots or jars. It may also be used in sauces and gravies, or eaten like mustard, with cold meat, or spread upon grills, being an excellent ingredient for devils, wet or dry. This admirable sauce is the invention of Colonel Tapp, and in India goes by his name. It may be made very good with vinegar only, omitting the lemon-juice. KHICHAREE SAUCE. 352. —Boil a pint of rice in broth, and, having steeped a teacupful of dried peas in water, boil them till they are soft. Then slice 2 or 3 onions, and fry them in butter, with a dozen or two of cardamom-seeds, a little white pepper, 6 cloves, and salt; take out the onions when browned, and the spice, and add a cup of curds or milk to the butter; stew it a little ; distribute the onions, spice, and peas equally through the rice, and pour the butter, &c., over it. Or put the whole into an earthen jar; secure the aperture with a paste, and put into an oven, or over a charcoal fire, for 25 minutes, adding xMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap.

This is a very deli- cious sauce over a plum or any other boiled pudding ; if a plain batter pudding, a little lemon- juice is an improvement. Pot for Milling- Sauce. SA UCES FOR FISH. 356.—The stock for fish sauces should be made of the water in which fish has been boiled, adding the bones, fins, &c., all well stewed down ; when fish is filleted, the hopes should always be employed in this way : stew them with an onion and a little white pepper, strain the broth, which will be very rich, thicken it with cream, butter, and flour, or roux; and add whatever the sauce is to be made of. The following may be generally used, according to fancy, for nearly every species of fish. Horseradish Sauce.—Stew an onion in a little fish-stock until it will pulp ; add a teaspoonful of grated horseradish,Chap. XVII.] GRAVY, SAUCES, AND CURRY. 307 over a fire, thicken it with a little batter, and finish with a spoonful of lemon-pickle or lemon-juice. Vinegar may be substituted, in which case it must be mixed with the horse- radish, and boiled with it; while the lemon, or lemon-pickle, being of a more delicate flavour, should only be warmed. Or:—Scrape the horseradish thin and chop it small, or grate it, which is better; warm it in melted butter, adding a spoonful of mushroom ketchup, and one of walnut, or the vinegar from walnut-pickle. For freshwater Fish.—Take 2 large anchovies, 4 an onion finely chopped, 1 spoonful of vinegar, and 4 of sherry or ginger wine: boil it together, thicken it with flour, and add 4 spoonfuls of cream or melted butter, in which latter case the flour may be omitted. s For all sorts of Fish.—Take a spoonful of vinegar, 1 of Indian soy, the same of mushroom ketchup and Harvey’s sauce, with a little cayenne. Add 3 large spoonfuls of melted butter ; stir all well, and heat it over the fire. Or:—Put equal quantities of water and vinegar into a saucepan, and thicken it with the yolk of an egg to every 4 spoonfuls of the water and vinegar. Make it quite hot, but do not boil it; stir it or shake the pan all the time ; season it to your liking, and add a spoonful of the liquid to every 3 of melted butter. White Sauce.—4 a pint of cream, 2 tablespoonfuls of mush- room ketchup', 1 of essence of anchovy, with a little cayenne pepper, and an ounce or two of butter rolled in flour; boil all together for 5 minutes. JBroivn Sauce.—Fry an dnion in butter and flour until it becomes brown ; then simmer it in a glass of port wine, with a .tablespoonful of soy and walnut ketchup, seasoned with salt and cayenne; strain it, and thicken it with the necessary quantity of melted butter. Fish Sauce without butter.—Simmer very gently \ pint of vinegar and 4 pint of water (which must not be hard), with an onion, 4 a handful of scraped horseradish, and the following spices lightly bruised—4 cloves, 2 blades of mace, and 4 a teaspoonful of black pepper. When the onion is quite tender, chop it small with 2 anchovies, and set the whole on the fire to boil for a few minutes, with a spoonful of ketchup. In the mean time have ready and well beaten the x 2308 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVII. yolks of 3 fresh eggs ; strain them, mix the liquor by degrees with them, and, when well mixed, set the saucepan over a gentle fire, keeping the basin in one hand, into which toss the sauce to and fro, and shake the saucepan over the fire, that the eggs may not curdle. Do not boil them, only let the sauce be hot enough to give it the thickness of melted butter. Dutch Fish-sauce.—Put 2 blades of mace into 2 table- spoonfuls of vinegar, boil it till reduced to 1 ; add the yolk of an egg, mix it well together. Put to it l lb. of butter kneaded with flour, stir it over the fire, but do not let it boil. If it should curdle a little cold water will smoothen it aaain. OYSTER SAUCE. 357.—Scald the oysters in their own liquor, beard them, strain the liquor, let it settle; melt a piece of fresh butter, add flour sufficient to thicken the quantity of sauce, let it fry a little; pour in the liquor of the oysters and sufficient cream to make it the required thickness; add salt, cayenne, and the oysters. Or:—This is almost universally served with boiled cod. Beard the oysters, and put the beards with the liquor to stew for about i of an hour, together with a blade of mace ; then strain the liquor, put the oysters into it, and let them just boil up, adding some butter which has been rubbed in flour and a little cream or milk ; but do not let them quite boil, or they Avill become hard. Or :—To every dozen of oysters put 1 ounce of butter melted very thick, and diluted with the oyster-liquor, t a glass of white wine, and veal broth, seasoned only with salt and a very little cayenne pepper. Should the oysters be of the large sort-, they may be cut in half, which will afford the opportunity of removing the hard part contained in the centre. Brown Oyster-sauce is frequently served up with rump-steaks. As the butter destroys the savouriness of the meat, the oysters, instead of being stewed in white sauce, should be dressed in strong beef-gravy, along with a good portion of ketchup, either stewed for a few minutes very gently, or put into an uncovered dish along with the gravy, and placed before the j fire in a Dutch oven to brown. 2 dozen will fill a pint tureen ; this sauce will also be found excellent as an accompanim ent to I roast turkey.Chap. XVII.] GRAVY, SAUCES, AND CURRY. 309 MUSCLE AND COCKLE SAUCES. 358. —Proceed in the same manner as either of the above receipts, taking care to deprive the muscle of a dark spot in the body, which some people consider poisonous, and to well wash the cockles from sand. They may be equally used with codfish, codling, and haddock; but the latter is most usually served with parsley and butter. LOBSTER SAUCE. 359. —Pick the meat from a lobster and cut it into small pieces. Break the shell, and stew it with the legs, &c., in Iij pint of water, until reduced to the quantity required ; then strain ; add flour and water to thicken it. Pound some of the live spawn from the tail, adding a little water to it; when well pounded pour it by degrees into the sauce; let it boil up ; add fresh butter to it in the proportion of f lb. of butter to a quart of sauce ; throw in the lobster : season with a little anchovy, cayenne, salt, and a small quantity of lemon-juice. It should be thick rather than thin. Or:—Take a cold boiled hen lobster ; split the tail, and pound the coral, which is found in the tail and in the body, in a mortar, adding a little sweet oil. Then chop the meat of the body into very small pieces, and rub it, along with the soft parts and coral, through a sieve. That done, cut up the flesh of the claws and tail into dice, and stir the entire mixture gradually into the proper quantity of melted butter, without suffering it to boil; as, if too much heated, the flavour and colour of the sauce will be injured. The seasoning should only be a moderate quantity of mace and cayenne, with L a glass of white wine, or a cup of cream, to a pint tureen of sauce. Crab Sauce is made in the same manner; but crabs, being without coral, and the flesh less firm than that of lobster, form a rather inferior sauce. SHRIMP SA UCE. 360. —Pick the heads and skins from some fresh shrimps, i and stew these offals for £ an hour in a small quantity of boiling water to extract their flavour; then strain the liquor !' and make use of it in melting the butter in which the shelled ji shrimps are to be dressed; these are then to be put into the310 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVII. butter and liquor to simmer gently for about 20 minutes, in which time they will be sufficiently done, and their flavour is so delicate that neither anchovy sauce, mace, cayenne pepper, nor any other condiment than salt, should be put to them ; add a little cream. A pint of unshelled shrimps will make a tureen of sauce large enough for 4 or 5 persons. Fresh-water Crayfish Sauce is commonly made by either simply picking out the fish and mincing it in the same manner as lobster; or, pounding the shells and legs in a mortar, and after stewing them down to something like a pulp, then passing it through a sieve, and mixing the whole together. SAUCE FOR STURGEON. 361.—As this fish is generally stewed, the sauce is that in which it has been dressed; or, if either broiled or fried in steaks, any of the piquant store sauces may be used along with wine and lemon-juice thickened with cream and melted butter. SAUCES FOR CARP, PIKE, AND TENCH. 362.—Rub i lb. of butter with a teaspoonful of flour, put to it a little water, melt it, and add near i pint of thick cream, and i an anchovy chopped fine, not washed; set it over the fire, and as it boils up add a large spoonful of real India soy. If that does not give it a fine colour, put a little more. Turn it into the sauce-tureen, and put some salt and 4 a lemon: stir it well, to prevent its curdling. Sauce for Fried or Broiled Carp.—A gill of white wine, a couple of anchovies boned and minced, with an onion orlwo, and a little Seville orange or lemon peel, boiled in a teacupful of the gravy of either meat or fish, and then put into i lb. of butter, to which, when melted, the yolk of a raw egg may be added, and when it boils up squeeze into it the greater part of the lemon or orange juice. Or:—Anchovies, mushrooms, capers, and a shalot, all finely minced and stewed as above, witli a little pepper and the juice of a lemon. Baked Pike and Tench may also be served with the sauces for broiled and fried carp; or sometimes with only caper- sauce.311 Chap. XVII.] GRAVY, SAUCES, AND CURRY. Smelts, Sprats, Roach, Gudgeon, and Dace are always either fried or broiled ; and the best sauce for either, if not used merely as a garnish, is the juice of a lemon with a little cay- enne pepper, merely pulling off the heads of the smaller fish, and dipping the body in the juice. The juice of a lemon is also sufficient for whitebait; but in all sour sauces the flavour of the Seville orange is preferable to the acidity of the lemon. SA UCE FOR EELS. 363. —If the *eels be spitchcocked in their skins, then some piquant sauce, as sauce a la tartare, is the best for correcting their richness; but if stripped of their skins and covered with bread-crumbs, then plain melted butter, seasoned from the cruets, or any of the milder sauces in these receipts, are more appropriate. Boiled eels are frequently served with capers and sometimes with sorrel sauce or parsley and butter; and stewed eels have always the sauce in which they have been dressed. JELLY TO COVER COLD FISH. 364. —Clean a skate, and put it into 3 quarts of water, with a calfs-foot or cow-heel, a stick of horseradish, an onion, 3 blades of mace, some white pepper, a piece of lemon-peel, and a good slice of lean gammon. Stew until it will jelly; strain it off: when cold, remove every bit of fat; take it up from the sediment, and boil it with a glass of sherry, the whites of 4 or 5 eggs, and a piece of lemon. Boil without stirring; and after a few minutes set it by to stand 4 an hour, and strain it through a bag or sieve, with a cloth in it. Cover the fish with it when cold, lightly roughed. CURRIES. 365.—Curry, which was formerly a dish almost exclusively for the table of those who had made a long residence in India, is now so completely naturalized, that few dinners are thought complete unless there is one on the table ; it therefore becomes necessary to give a few hints, which will be applicable to every variety. It is of the first importance to procure good “ curry-powderthere are a great many receipts for makingMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XYIT. 312 it, some of which we shall give, but the one most to be relied upon is prepared at Apothecaries5 Hall, and called “ Colonel Lys’s curry-powder.”—The rice also forms a very important part of a curry, and great care is required in boiling it. The “Patna” is the best for this purpose. In India this dish is varied by the addition of green fruits and vegetables, which give a delicious acid and piquancy to it; we are apt to rely too much upon turmeric and cayenne pepper for the flavour. The cocoa-nut is also a favourite ingredient in the Oriental curry. At those seasons when the cocoa-nut is fresh imported into England, a couple of ounces of a good sound nut, grated and stewed for an hour, would greatly improve a curry made of white meat. Cucumbers, vegetable marrow, spinach, to- mata, celery, acid apple, peas, and almost any kind of green vegetables or fruit, might be added with advantage to different kinds of curry. The receipts here given have been selected as best suited to the English taste. Several others will be found under the several heads of the meats or material which distin- guish them. To prepare a Curry.—The meat should be fresh and free from bone. Cut it into pieces which can be easily served. To each pound of meat add a tablespoonful of curry powder and about half the quantity of flour, and a little salt; mix these together, and rub a portion of it upon the meat before it is fried, the remainder afterwards. Fry the meat in a little butter. Fry onions a light brown, with a clove of garlic if approved ; drain the fat from both the meat and onions; put them into a stewpan, and cover with boiling water; stew for 20 minutes, then rub the remainder of the powder smooth Avith a little cold water, add it, and let it steAV for an hour, or according to the time necessary for the meat to be Avell done. If no other acid is used, stir in a little lemon-juice just before serving: place it in the centre of the dish, and put carefully boiled rice round it. CURRY POWDERS. 366.—1 oz. of ginger, the same of coriander-seed, i oz. of cayenne pepper, and 2 oz. of fine pale turmeric ;a these ingre- dients to be pounded separately to a fine powder, and then warmed by the fire, and mixed together. Put the powder into “ Those who dislike the flavour of turmeric may substitute saflron.313 Chap. XVII.] GRAVY, SAUCES, AND CURRY. a wide-mouthed bottle, cork it well down, and put it into a dry place. Or:—1 tablespoonful of coriander-seed, 1 teaspoonful of cumin-seed, the same of turmeric and of cayenne pepper, and 1 tablespoonful of common flour. When to be used, mix all these ingredients in their several proportions, with 2 table- spoonfuls of lemon-pickle and 4 of cream, adding this mixture to the fried onions and butter, &c. Or :—14 oz. of mustard-seed scorched and finely powdered, 4 oz. of coriander-seed pounded, 44 oz. of turmeric, 3 oz. of black pepper, 14 oz. of cayenne pepper, 1 oz. of the lesser cardamoms, 4 oz. of ginger, and 1 of cumin-seed, all finely powdered. The flavour may be varied by the addition of all or any of the following ingredients: cinnamon, in powder, 1 oz.; cloves, ditto, 4 oz.; mace, ditto, 4 oz. Delhi Curry-powder.—20 teaspoonfuls of turmeric, 8 of pounded chilis or cayenne pepper, and 12 each of cumin, coriander-seed, and dried cassia-leaves. Madras Curry-powder.—f lb. of turmeric, 2 oz. of cumin- seed, 2 oz. of coriander-seed, 1 oz. of carraway-seed, the same of cardamom-seed, 4 oz. of black pepper, 4 oz. of cayenne ditto, 4 oz. of fenugreek-seed, 4 oz. of cloves, 4 oz. of cinna- mon, 4 oz. of mace, all of the best quality, pounded separately to a fine powder, and kept very dry. Bengal Curry-powder.—4 oz. of coriander-seed, 2 oz. cayenne pepper, 2 oz. of turmeric, 1 oz. of cumin-seed, 1 oz. of fennel-seed, 1 oz. of black pepper. To be well dried, pounded, and sifted. Lime or lemon juice should be added to this curry-powder when used. Sir II. Pottingers Curry -powder. — Take of turmeric- powder 2 oz., ginger-powder 14 oz., white pepper 1 oz., car- damom-seed 4 oz., coriander-seed 14 oz., cumin 1 oz., fenugreek 2 drachms, and cayenne pepper 4 oz. Mix these ingredients together, and keep the powder in a dry place. MODES OF BOILING RICE.-E.R. The great art in boiling rice is to keep every grain separate; i the pot should, therefore, be kept on a strong fire, so as to I keep the water in a constant boil, as this motion will prevent 4 the grains from sticking together. The pot should be left >1 uncovered, and close attention is necessary on the part of theMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVII. 314 cook to watch the rice; take the pot off the fire the moment it is done, strain and dry it immediately. 367. —AVash the rice well, and boil it in a large quantity of water: when a very little of the centre of the grain remains hard, take it off the fire, strain off t or more of the hot water, fill the saucepan with cold water, and shake the rice; then strain all the water off, and the grain will separate; place the pan of rice near the fire to swell, and the centre part of the grains will become tender.*1 Or:—Take 1 lb. of rice, soak it for 4 minutes, then put it into 4 times its weight of boiling water, and, when sufficiently done, drain off the water thoroughly, and replace the saucepan on the fire until the grains separate. Or :—Wash i lb. of rice in salt and water, then put it into 2 quarts of boiling water, and let it boil briskly for about 20 minutes ; but, though until the grains become tender, yet not long enough to let them become soft. Then strain it through a sieve, put the rice into a dish, and place it, uncovered, for a short time before the fire to dry it; when that is done, send it up quite hot, either in a separate dish, or around the curry. THE KING OF OUDE'S CURRY. 368. —Take i lb. of fresh butter, 2 large onions, a gill of good gravy (veal is the best), 1 large pressed tablespoonful of curry-powder; add to these ingredients any kind of meat cut into pieces. Put the whole into a stewpan, cover it close, and gently simmer for 2 hours. When ready to serve up, squeeze as much lemon-juice as will give it an acid flavour. BENGAL CURRY. 369. —Take a drachm of red pepper, 6 onions, and 1 oz. of coriander-seed free from the husks • rub the seeds per- fectly smooth in a mortar; then add and pound the pepper and onions, mixing all well together. That done, set £ lb. of butter in a stewpan on the fire, slice an onion into it, and, when the latter is brown, take it out, and put in 2 drachms of turmeric. Let it fry until the raw flavour goes off; then mix £ pint of curds with the pounded ingredients, and put the whole into the pan with the meat cut in pieces, 2 oz. of grated 11 This is a most excellent method of boiling rice, never failing to produce it in perfection.Chap. XVII.] GRAVY, SAUCES, AND CURRY. 315 cocoa-nut, and a little salt. Stir the stew continually; and, while the meat is getting brown, sprinkle water to prevent it from burning. LORD CLIVE’S CURRY.—E. R. 370. —Slice 6 onions, 1 green apple, and a clove of garlic ; stew them in a little good stock until they will pulp, then add 1 teaspoonful of curry-powder, a few tablespoonfuls of stock, a little salt and a little cayenne pepper, i a saltspoonful of each; stew in this gravy any kind of meat cut into small pieces, adding a piece of butter, the size of a walnut, rolled in flour. ^ * THE HASTINGS CURRY.—E. R. 371. —Brown £ lb. of fresh butter, slice 2 large onions, and fry them. Cut fine the heart of a hard white cabbage, and a large sour apple ; put the whole into a stewpan, add a tea- spoonful of cayenne pepper, 1 of black pepper, 1 of turmeric, the juice of + a lemon, and a gill of strong gravy. Cut up a fowl, flour it, add a little salt, put it with the rest of the in- gredients, cover it closely to keep in the steam, and let it stew for 3 hours. PRAWN CURRY. 372. —Take a pint of prawns or shrimps, boiled and shelled, put 2 oz. of butter into a stewpan, with an onion finely shred, and 2 spoonfuls of curry-powder; stew them well together, and then put in the fish. Have some spinach washed very clean, put it into a saucepan without any water; when enough, press the liquor from it, and add it to the butter, &c.; stir it well together, taking care that it does not burn in the pan : if necessary, add a little water, for the ingredients must stew for a few minutes over the fire to amalgamate properly. HARD EGG CURRY. 373. —Slice 2 onions and fry them in butter, add a table- spoonful of curry-powder; let them stew in a pint of good broth till quite tender; mix a cup of cream, and thicken with arrowroot or rice-flour. Simmer a few minutes, then add 6 or 8 hard-boiled eggs cut into slices; heat them tho- roughly, but do not let them boil.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVII. 316 MALAY CURRY. 374. —Blanch 2 oz. of almonds, fry them in a little but- ter till brown, but do not let them burn. Pound them to a cream with an onion and the rind of 7 a lemon. Cut up a chicken into joints. Mix a teaspoonful of turmeric and 4 the quantity of cayenne pepper in 4 a pint of water; put this with the chicken, almonds, &c., into a stewpan, and let it simmer for about 20 minutes; then add a teacupful of cream, let it nearly boil, and before dishing squeeze in the juice of a lemon. HINDOSTANEE KUWAB FOWL.—E. R. 375. —Rub smooth in a mortar tr oz. of coriander-seed, 3 onions, a drachm of red pepper, the same of pounded ginger, and 4 cloves. Put 4 oz. of salt butter on the fire in a stewpan. Rub a fowl inside and outside with the pounded ingredients; truss it nicely; put it into the butter, and fry it a fine brown, turning it continually. This is a sort of salamander very ac- ceptable to the lovers of fiery dishes: it should be eaten with lemon-juice squeezed over it. The butter may be converted into sauce; but at many tables the fowl is served up dry in the dish. A small fowl is best for the purpose, it being more easily cooked. Or:—Skewer upon small silver skewers alternate slices of apple, slices of meat, cut into round pieces the same size, and halves of onions, so as to have 4 pieces of each, i. e. 12 on each skewer. To 2 lbs. weight take a drachm of turmeric, 4 onions, and a drachm of red pepper; pound them in a mortar, sprinkle over, and fry them with the kuwab in a stewpan with i lb. of butter. Send up boiled rice in a separate dish.317 Chap. XVIII.] VEGETABLES AND SALADS. CHAPTER XVIII. VEGETABLES AND SALADS. VEGETABLES. 376.—The fresher all green vegetables are used after being taken from the ground the better ; and therefore nothing can be comparable to cutting them from your own garden ; but, when purchased in the market, care should be taken that those of the cabbage tribe should appear crisp and vividly green : not too small, nor yet overgrown in size. When about to be used, the outer leaves should be stripped, the stalks cut short, and the vegetable immersed for an hour or two in cold water, into which should be put a handful of salt, for the purpose of thoroughly cleansing it from slugs, and those insects with which the leaves are commonly infested. All green vegetables should be put into boiling water. Never boil any species of greens with meat. Boil them in plenty of pure water, with salt, to which a little vinegar may be added ■with advantage; do not cover the saucepan, but keep up a steady fire, so that they shall not be allowed to stop boiling until thoroughly done : drain them instantly, for if Overboiled they lose their flavour and become insipid ; they should be well done, for, if that be neglected for the pur- pose of preserving their crispness, they will be rendered indigestible. Hard water spoils the colour of such vegetables as should be green, but a very small bit of soda or carbonate of ammonia will soften it, and even improve their brightness. The prac- tice of putting pearlash in the pot, to improve their colour, should be strictly forbidden, as it imparts an unpleasant flavour; as will also soda if not cautiously used.318 ' MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XYIII. POTATOES 377.—Require no attention for the preservation of their colour, but their flavour will be spoiled if their dressing be not attended to, winch, although of the most simple nature, is frequently ill performed. The best mode of doing it is to sort the potatoes, and choose them of an equal size; wash them with a scrubbing-brush, and put them into cold water sufficient to cover them, and no more. About 10 minutes after the water has come to a boil, take out the half of it, and replace with cold water, to check it; the reason assigned for which is, “ that the cold water sends the heat from the surface to the heart, and makes the potatoes mealy.” Then throw in a large handful of salt, leave the pot uncovered, and let it remain upon the fire to simmer until the potatoes are done ; this is the moment to be watched, for, if overboiled, they will become waxy. The cook should, therefore, occasionally try them, by piercing them to the heart with a fork, and, when they are tender, the pot should be instantly taken olf the fire, and the potatoes passed through a colander to drain; which being done, and the water thrown out, they should then be replaced upon a folded flannel, in the same pot, which should be left by the side of the fire to keep hot and to cause the evaporation of the steam. When served, they should be wrapped in a warmed cotton napkin. If of moderate size they will take about ^ an hour boiling, to which 15 minutes must be added for evapo- ration ere they can be sent to table. An iron pot is the best vessel for boiling potatoes in, since, after the water has been poured off, it retains sufficient heat to dry them thoroughly. We here present a new invention for boiling potatoes by steam, which appears to possess merit, but we have not tried it. The machine may be found at all tin-shops, and goes under the name of “ Palmer’s a shows the interior, and b the entire machine. The potatoes being placed over the boiler, the steam from the water passes rapidly through the upper ves- sel, and, as it condenses in the cone-shaped cover, passes off through an internal tube. By this ingenious and simple apparatus potatoes are cooked by steam only, thereby extracting and not adding (as is the case with all other steamers) to the main cause of the presentChap. XVIII.] VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 319 failure in this important vegetable, viz. the superfluous mois- ture they possess. A good and economical mode of dressing potatoes, when soup, meat, or other eatables, are to be boiled, is to have a tin strainer fitted to the mouth of the saucepan, so as to allow the steam to ascend from the boiler. By which sim- ple contrivance a will boil the soup ; b, when fixed in the pot, will steam the potatoes; and c, being the lid, will cover the whole, having a couple of small holes left in it to allow the steam to escape, in order to prevent it from fall- ing down upon the pota- toes. Notwithstanding the directions here given for cooking potatoes, there is yet another point to which we have not adverted, and on which there exists great difference of opinion, that is, respecting the peeling of the roots, whether before or after their being boiled ? In Lancashire, where they are largely grown arid admirably boiled, they are first peeled ; while in Ireland they are inva- Iron Pot, with Potato Strainer.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XYIII. 320 riably brought to table “ with their jackets on.” Count Rom- ford also recommends their being boiled in their skins; the cuisinier Bourgeois likewise thinks that “ lespommes de terre sont meilleures en robe de chambre.” The principles on which such opposite opinions are supported are these :—The retention of the skin is upheld upon the sup- position that, if it be taken off, the potato will imbibe the water and become waxy; while, on the other hand, it is insisted that the potato, if peeled, not only does not imbibe the water in which it is boiled, but actually exudes the juice which it con- tains, and which is thought to be poisonous. On both these points we have made repeated experiments to discover any perceptible difference in the appearance of the root, which is always equally floury or waxy ; but we think that it retains a little more flavour when the skin is not taken off before boiling: that is, however, so trifling, that in our own practice we always peel them first, as being more cleanly, and avoiding the trouble of doing it when dinner is to be served, besides exposing the potatoes to become cold. TO KEEP POTATOES. 378. —Buy them as dug from the ground, without taking off the earth which adheres to them, and never wash them until wanted to be dressed. Place them in a dry cellar, upon straw, and cover them in winter with straw or mats, to guard them from the frost. NEW POTATOES 379. —Should be dressed as soon as possible after being taken from the ground, and are always best when grown in frames. When washed, they should be rubbed with a coarse cloth and a little salt, to take off the thin outer skin, but they should not be peeled. Put them into boiling water, they will require but a few minutes to do them; send them to table in a hot napkin, unless covered with white sauce, which should be seasoned with a little salt and a slight grating of nutmeg. When quite young they should never be sliced nor fried. POTATO-FLOUR. 380. —Rasp the potatoes into a tub of cold water, and change it repeatedly until the raspings fall to the bottom like a paste; then dry it in the air, pound it in a mortar,Chap. XVIII.] VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 321 and pass it through a hair sieve. It is nearly as nutritive, and much lighter, than wheaten flour; it is, therefore, prefer- able for making puddings and pastry for infants and invalids; a portion of it also improves the appearance of household bread, and dealers constantly pass it off as arrowroot. If kept dry, it will remain good for years. POTATO-JELLY 381. —Is made from the flour, only boiling water must be poured upon it, but care must be taken that it be absolutely boiling, or the complete change into jelly will not take place. It does not take many minutes to thus change a raw potato into this substance, which is not only highly nutritive, but extremely agreeable to the palate when flavoured with a little sugar, nutmeg, and white wine. POTATO-WALL, 382. —Or edging, to serve round fricassees, forms also a pretty addition to a corner dish.—Mash in a mortar as many boiled potatoes as you may want, with a good piece of butter; then, with the bowls of two silver spoons, raise a wall of it 23- inches high within the rim of the dish to be used. Let the upper part be a little thinner than the lower; smooth it; and, after brushing it all over with egg, put it into the oven to become hot and a little coloured. Before egging it, the outside may be ornamented with bits of paste cut into shapes. TO MASH P 0 TA TOES. 383. —Let them be thoroughly boiled, peel them, and take out all the specks and little hard lumps which are some- times found. Beat them till quite fine in a wooden bowl or mortar, or break them thoroughly with a 3-pronged fork; sprinkle a little salt, and mix them up smoothly with butter or boiling milk. Take care that the potatoes shall not be too wet, or they will become heavy and watery; great smoothness, lightness, and a rich taste are required in mashed potatoes: if required to be very fine, rub them through a colander or sieve before adding the boiling milk and butter. Or :—As in India: Mash some potatoes, and, having boiled I 1 or 2 onions, chop them small, together with a few capsicums, v Mix the whole well together; put it into a mould, or form it Y322 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVIII. with a spoon into a handsome shape, and warm it in an oven or upon a stove. OLD POTATOES TO LOOK LIKE YOUNG ONES. 384. —Wash some large potatoes, and, with a small scoop made for the purpose, form as many diminutive ones as will fill a dish; boil them in 2 or 3 waters about 3 minutes each time, the water being put to them cold ; then let them steam till tender; pour a white sauce over them, and serve with the second course. Old potatoes prepared thus have been mis- taken for young ones at the best tables. POTATO-LOAVES 385. —Are very nice when eaten with roast beef or mut- ton, and are made of any portion of the mashed roots, pre- pared without milk, by mixing with them a good quantity of very finely minced raw shalot, powdered with pepper and salt; then beating up the whole with a little butter to bind it, and dividing it into small loaves of a conical form, and placing them under the meat to brown, that is, when it is so nearly done as to impart some of the gravy along with the fat. TO BR 01VN PO TA TOES. 386. —While the meat is roasting, and an hour before it is served, boil the potatoes and take off the skins; flour them: well, and put them under the meat, taking care to dry them from the dripping before they are sent to table. The kidney po- tatoes are best dressed in this way. The flouring is very essential. Potatoes, when boiled, if either waxy, or to be eaten with cold meat, should be peeled and put whole upon the gridiron until nicely browned. Potatoes should always be boiled a little before being put into stews, &c., as the first water in which they are cooked is of a poisonous quality. Fried Potatoes should always be cut from raw potatoes, and pared round and round like an apple ; cut them in slices i inch thick ; fry quickly, in plenty of hot fat, and with as little colour as possible; dry them well from the grease, and sprinkle with salt. When nicely done, and piled up properly, fried potatoes make a beautiful side dish, which is always eaten with great relish.323 Chap. XVIII.] VEGETABLES AND SALADS. Or: Cut a potato in pieces lengthways the size and shape of the divisions of an orange, trim them neatly and fry them ; they are an excellent garnish for fried fillet of beef. Or:— Cold Potatoes may be cut in slices somewhat less than ^ inch thick, and fried in like manner. Some persons also fry them with bnions, as an accompaniment to pork chops, sliced cod, red herring, or with a rasher of bacon. ROASTED POTATOES 387. —May be either done in a Dutch oven or put into the ashes of a wood fire. They should not be peeled, and require a long time: if large, and the fire not very strong, a couple of hours will not be too much. They are usually eaten with cold butter at supper. Potato-balls.—Bake the potatoes, mash them very nicely, make them into balls, rub them over with the yolk of an egg, and put them into the oven or before the fire to brown. These balls may be varied by the introduction of a third por- i tion of grated ham or tongue. GREEN PEAS.—E. R. 388. —Boil them very fast in plenty of water with the lid off the stewpan; the water should be moderately salted. They are unfit for eating when they become hard and yel- lowish, but when growing rather old a very small quantity of : carbonate of ammonia put into the water, with 2 or 3 lumps 1 of loaf-sugar, will greatly improve them. The old English I method of putting a sprig of mint, or a little parsley, is still a good practice, and ought to be continued unless specially for- i bidden, or the mint may be chopped and put round the dish. A few bits of raw butter should also be put into the peas when ! boiled, and a dust of pepper and salt thrown over them if they be completely ripe ; but if quite young, neither butter, salt, nor I' pepper should be added to them, but a teaspoonful of pounded li white sugar. When growing to maturity the pods are of dif- p ferent ages, and young and old peas should not be boiled toge- b ther; sift them, therefore, from each other, and put the old -.] ones into the water some minutes sooner than the young: they J.«() require from 15 to 20 minutes boiling. TO STE1F GREEN PEAS. 389. —Cut a cucumber in slices and brown it in fried bntter l» with 2 onions cut very small, to which put 1 quart of peas, a Y 2324 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XYIII. little pepper and salt. Let all stew slowly for an hour or more without any water, the stewpan being merely greased, or a bit of butter put in if the cucumber should not yield sufficient juice: when nearly done, add a teaspoonful of essence of ham: keep the pot closely covered while stewing. With Mint.—Take the hearts of 4 cabbage lettuces, cut them small, put them into a stewpan with 3 pints of young green peas and a little green mint chopped; add pepper and salt; then take a lump of butter the size of an egg, and mix it well with the vegetables, taking care not to bruise the peas; then add 2 tablespoonfuls of pump-water, a bit of ham, and a whole onion. Put them on the fire to stew until tender; 20 minutes will suffice, shaking the pan con- stantly to prevent its burning: when tender, take out the ham and onion, and add a piece more butter rolled in flour and t pint of cream; boil all together for 5 minutes, and add a tea- spoonful of loaf-sugar pounded. When old.—Steep them in water all night, if not fine boil- ers ; otherwise only i an hour: put them into water enough just to cover them, with a good bit of butter, or a piece of beef or pork. Stew them very gently till the peas are soft and the meat is tender: if it is not salt meat, add salt and a little pepper. Serve them round the meat. TO PRESERVE PEAS FOR WINTER USE.* 390.—Shell, scald, and dry them as above: put them on tins or earthen dishes, in a cool oven, once or twice, to harden. Keep them in paper bags hung up in the kitchen. When they are to be used, let them lie an hour in water; then set them on with cold water and a bit of butter, and boil them till ready. Put a sprig of dried mint to boil with them. Mr. Apperis method. —Have the peas gathered when ripe, for if too young they will be watery and not fit to keep. The peas, when shelled, should be put into strong jars or open- mouthed bottles, and shaken, so as to make them sit closely together. This done, the jars must be very tightly corked and tied down. The jars are then placed upright in a bain- marie, or any ii’on pot large enough to contain them, with hay placed between each, to prevent collision and breakage; t e pot is filled with cold water up to the neck of the jars, plac “ As practised in the kitchen of the Emperor of Russia.Chap. XVIII.] VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 325 upon the fire, and allowed to boil for H hour if in cool moist weather, but for 2 hours if it be hot and dry. The jars should not be taken out of the pot until the water becomes cold. French beans and asparagus may be preserved in the same manner; they maintain their colour, but lose much of their flavour, and require a little sugar to improve it. BROAD OR WINDSOR BEANS. 391. — To boil.—Shell them, boil them until tender, with a good handful of parsley, then strain them ; put a large piece of butter in the middle. Toss the beans by shaking the pan upwards, so as to mix the whole well together. Serve with parsley and butter in a boat. Broad beans may be dressed when young with their skins on ; but, if old, they should be blanched, which is done by the cook’s removing the skin without breaking the beans, and then putting them, with a bit of butter, for a few minutes into the stewpan to warm. To stezv.—Take them when too old to dress any other way, boil them, and remove the tough outer skin by peeling it off after the beans are boiled; thicken some white broth with a little cream or flour and butter, add the beans to it, and stew them all together over the fire for a few minutes. Add pep- per and salt to palate. SPLIT-PEAS PUDDING. 392. —Take any quantity, say 1 pint, of yellow split peas ;a allow them to remain in water the whole night before you wish to use them ; after which take them out and put them into a cloth so loose as to allow the peas to swell; boil them for 4 hours, or until they are quite tender, then rub them through a colander, so as to render them perfectly smooth; add to the pulp a lump of butter and some salt. After being well mixed put the peas again into a cloth, tie tightly, and boil for about i an hour. Pour over it melted butter. A richer pudding may be made if 2 well-beaten eggs are added along with the butter. It is served with boiled pork. CARROTS AND PARSNIPS. 393. —When young, wipe off the skin after they are boiled * The meal made of peas and sold by all dealers saves much of the trouble of soaking and rendering the peas smooth.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XYIII. 326 by drawing them through a cloth dipped in hot water; when old, scrape them first, and boil them with the salt meat. They require to be well done. They area constant accompaniment to corned beef, and are excellent 'when botli are eaten together cold. They frequently also form part of stews and hashes, and make admirable soup when boiled down to a puree, in making which it should be observed that only the outer or scarlet rind is to be used : the inner part should not, however, be lost, as it may be cut into small pieces and stewed. To stew Carrots.—Half boil, then nicely scrape, and slice them into a stewpan. Put to them i a teacupfnl of any weak broth, some pepper and salt, i a cupful of cream, and a saltspoonful of powdered sugar: simmer them till they are very tender, but not broken. Before serving, rub a very little flour with a bit of butter, and warm up with them. If approved, chopped parsley may be added 10 minutes before serving. Carrots a la maitre d’hotel.—Boil the carrots tender. Put a lump of butter into the bottom of a stewpan with a little flour; when it is browned, add a little gravy: then put in the carrots, and let them stew gently till served. Carottes au Sucre may be also made as an entremet thus:—Slice them small, and put them into a stewpan, in only water enough to cover them, with the peel of a lemon and about half their own weight of sugar. Let this stew until the syrup is reduced to thickness; then add the juice of the lemon, with a tablespoonful or two of white wine, and serve. To mash Parsnips.—Boil them tender; scrape, then mash them into a stewpan with a little cream, a good piece of butter, pepper and salt. To fricassee Parsnips.—Boil in milk till they are soft; then cut them lengthwise into bits 2 or 3 inches long, and simmer in a white sauce, made of 2 spoonfuls of broth, a bit of mace, h a cupful of cream, a bit of butter, and some flour, pepper, and salt. TURNIPS 394.—Should always be boiled whole, and put in much after either carrots or parsnips, as they require less boiling. M henChap. XVIII.] VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 327 used in stews, they are, however, afterwards cut into small pieces of the size of dice, or made into shapes with a little in- strument to be found at all cutlery shops. They may be mashed in the same manner as parsnips; but some persons add the yolk of a raw egg or two. They are also frequently made into a puree to thicken mutton broth. When quite young they should be served up whole, and most generally covered with white sauce ; but in France they are very commonly fried, and made an accompaniment to roast ducks, around which they are placed in thfe dish ; and, if not young, the old ones are cut into that shape. \ TURNIP-TOPS, 395. —When cut fresh, are frequently used as greens, and preferred by many, as they contain a pleasant degree of bitter. They should be nicely trimmed, carefully washed, and boiled in hot water, but not too much. BEET-ROOTS 396. —Make a very pleasant addition to winter salad, of which they may agreeably form a full half, instead of being only used to ornament it. They are indeed excellent when used quite alone, being left until cold, after having been boiled ; then slicing them, and eating them with oil and vine- gar, though if celery be added it will be found an improve- ment. Great care must be taken in boiling beet-root that no part of the skin is broken, as, if it is, the colour will all be extracted. A wineglassful of vinegar and a little salt should be added to the water. It takes about the same time to boil as a carrot of the same size. Stewed.—Boil the beet slowly, with the skin on, until tender. They will take at least an hour’s boiling, but must not be tried by the fork, as the juice should not be allowed to run out. Take the skin off, then cut in slices i inch thick, put them into a stewpan with a little broth and a spoonful of vinegar, and simmer till the gravy is tinged with the colour; then put it into a small dish, and make a round of the button-onions, first boiled till tender. The flavour is richer and the colour finer when baked than when boiled. Or:—Bake it in an oven until it is quite tender, and, when cold, scrape off the outside coat, cut it in slices, andMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVIII. 328 pour a little vinegar over it; then put it into a stewpan, and cover it with gravy; stew gently for an hour, and before serving thicken the gravy with a little cream. The sauce should be of a fine red colour; and perhaps it would be advisable to pound one or two slices in a mortar, to extract the juice. CABBAGES 397. —Are of various sorts and differently dressed, but the most common mode is plainly boiled. If the cabbage be large and old, or strong-flavoured, it will take an hour to boil. It should be boiled in 2 waters, removing the first when the cab- bage is half done, and replacing it with an equal quantity boiling hot. The water should also be frequently skimmed. All green vegetables are best boiled uncovered. Sprouts, or Greens, will be done in 15 to 20 minutes, but do not require skimming. Brussels Sprouts are a small species of cabbage, not larger than a walnut, and growing upon a tall single stalk. They are boiled in a few minutes, and may be served up either plain or covered with white sauce. Buttered Cabbage.—Boil the cabbage with a quantity of onions, then chop them together, season with pepper and salt, and fry them in butter. It is a rather homely but savoury dish, and frequently used either with fried sausages laid over it or as an accompaniment to roast beef, and forms part of bubble and squeak. For Red Cabbage, see Pickles. To stew.—Boil a large cabbage, press it dry in a cloth, then cut it very finely, adding pepper and salt, and a few chives or green onions, also boiled separately and well chopped; put a lump of butter into a stewpan, let it melt, add the cab- bage, and warm it together, stirring all the time; add a spoonful of gravy, and 1 of lemon-pickle, or the juice of £ a lemon ; let it stew for a few minutes, and then serve it. OF LETTUCE 398. —There are 2 sorts, the cabbage and the coss, both used in salads. Farcie a la Franyaise.—Having cleaned the lettuces, tie them separately with a string, and boil them. Leave them to drain and cool; then open the leaves and lay in farce or329 Chap. XVIII.] VEGETABLES AND SALADS. forcemeat between each leaf; tie thenr up carefully, and stew them gently in a braise made of thin slices of bacon, a carrot, an onion, a small bunch of sweet herbs, and a little good gravy. Skim the gravy, strain it, add a glass of white wine, reduce it, and let it be served quite hot. Or: — Take lettuces prepared as above, drain them tho- roughly, dip them in beaten egg and bread-crumbs, or make a batter the same as for thick pancakes, adding a glass of brandy ; allow it to remain 4 hours before it is wanted, then dip in the lettuces and fry them in lard. ONIONS, 399.—Though all of the same species, are yet widely different in flavour, the Spanish being very mild and the English very pungent; but their taste may be much diminished by boiling them in 2 or 3 separate waters. In buying the former, always choose the larger sort, as having been probably grown in the south of Spain or Portugal, where the finest sort are produced. To stew.—Peel, flour, and fry them gently of a fine brown, but do not blacken them ; then put them into a small stew- pan, with a little gravy, pepper, and salt; cover and stew gently for 2 hours. Roast Onions should be done with all the skins on, and par- boiled before being put before the fire. They eat well alone, with only salt and cold butter, or with roast potatoes, and are better large than small. Though called “roast,” the best way is to put them in a Dutch oven and turn them occasionally, so as to brown them equally. The half-grown, or smaller sort, are frequently dressed in this way, and served with roast mut- ton ; and in France they are very commonly put round a dish of roast fowl. Young Onions are generally eaten raw; but chives, scal- lions, and shalot are mostly used for salads, or various modes of seasoning and pickles. Of all these condiments, garlic has the highest flavour, and if delicately used imparts a fine savour to various sorts of soups and sauces; or if a clove of it be put into the shank of a leg or shoulder of mutton to be roasted, it will much im- prove its flavour. It is an excellent tonic, and is exten- sively used by the best cooks throughout the south of Europe ; but in England a prejudice prevails against it, in consequence330 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVIII. either of the strength of its odour, or more probably of the coarseness with which our cooks employ it. LEEKS 400. —Are generally looked upon as a species of onion, and, as such, commonly employed in the same manner, though rather milder in flavour. If boiled in separate waters, changing it 3 or 4 times, until stewed quite tender, then served in white sauce, or quartered and placed upon toast like aspara- gus, they will eat nearly, if not quite, as delicate. SPINACH. 401. —Wash it well in different waters, pick off the decayed leaves, and boil it quickly in a large quantity of water and salt for i of an hour ; when done, squeeze it very dry, chop it, put in the dish, and pour melted butter over it; season it with pepper and salt. Or :—Boil it in as small a quantity of water as will prevent its burning to the pan; then strain and press it well; put it into a saucepan with a tablespoonful of gravy, a little pepper and salt, and a few drops of chili vinegar; stew it for 5 minutes, chopping it all the time. The spinach may be boiled the day before, and is better for being so. Steiced with Cream.—Boil the spinach as before directed, chop it very fine, and beat it well with a spoon, taking care to have picked out all the fibres ; put it into a stewpan with a piece of butter, some pepper and salt, a little nutmeg, and a very small quantity of pounded sugar ; stir it well as it stews, adding by degrees as much cream as -will make it the proper thickness. Garnish with fried paste. A la Franfalse.—Wash the spinach, and pick it very care- fully, then put it into boiling water, and when sufficiently tender to bear squeezing strain it in a colander; then throw it into cold water to preserve the colour. When it is quite cold, squeeze it in a towel, not in any large quantity at a time. Take out the stems, chop the spinach very fine, and then put it into a stew- pan with a piece of butter and some very rich gravy; add pepper, salt, and a little mace or nutmeg, and boil it rather fast, stirring it all the time ; the thickness will depend upon the quantity of the sauce. It is also very generally dressed with cream and a little white sugar, as an entremet of great delicacy.Chap. XVIII.] VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 331 It may be thus used alone, or with sippets, frequently with fricandeaux. A very pretty mode of serving it is to place it in the centre of a small dish, with fried lamb chops around it, standing on end with the long bones meeting together. GOURDS AND POMP IONS. 402. —The tops of all the edible species, boiled as greens or spinach, are a more delicate vegetable than the fruit. SEA-KALE 403. —Is the earliest of our spring vegetables, coming into season a month or two before asparagus. It is extremely delicate, either plainly boiled as an accompaniment to house- lamb and white poultry, or served alone with white sauce, though a frequent mode is to bring it to table on toast, in the same way as asparagus: it takes the same time to boil—about 20 minutes. Trim the ends like celery, brush out the dust, tie up in bundles, boil for 20 or 25 minutes, lay the tops upon toast, and pour melted butter over it. ASPARAGUS. 404. —Scrape the buds, and cut the white stalk off about 6 inches from the head ; throw them into cold water, and after soaking tie them in small bundles, and boil them rather quickly. If overdone, the heads will be broken. Toast a slice of bread very brown on both sides; and when the asparagus is done, take it very carefully up, dip the toast quickly in the water, and lay the heads upon it, leaving the white ends outwards each way, and pour melted butter over the toast and green parts. To Fricassee.—Scrape the asparagus clean, and, having steeped it in cold water, cut off the eatable portion. To 50 heads add 1 head of endive, a young lettuce, and a few chives, all 3 chopped ; put them into a stewpan with 2 oz. of butter; shake the pan while the butter is melting, and then dredge in a little flour, and season wilh pepper and salt; continue to shake the pan, and pour in a cupful of gravy ; stew the whole until the sauce is very rich and thick, and then serve it up. Farcis.—Cut a piece out of the top of 3 French rolls, take out all the crumb, do not enlarge the opening, or the crust will not exactly fit again. Fry the rolls brown, in fresh butter;MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVIII. 332 have ready a pint of cream, the yolks of 6 eggs well beaten, a little salt and nutmeg. Stir this mixture over a slow fire until it thickens. Boil a hundred of small asparagus; save tops enough to stick the tops of the rolls with, cut the remainder of the green part of the grass small: put it into the cream, and fill the rolls with it hot. Before the rolls are fried, make a few holes in the pieces of crust cut off, and stick the tops in. This is for a side-dish in a second course. In France asparagus is often eaten cold, as salad, with oil and vinegar. In the hop districts of England, the buds, and so much of the stalk or bine of the plant as Kwill break off short, are boiled and served up precisely as asparagus. In buying asparagus, the length of the green heads should be more looked to than their thickness. ARTICHOKES. 405.—Cut the stalk even, trim off a few of the outside leaves and the points of the others. If young,.^ an hour will boil them. Serve them with melted butter in as many small cups as there are artichokes, to help with each. Or:—Cut the artichokes in 4, remove the choke, trim the pieces neatly, boil them quickly in salt water, dish them, lay- ing the leaves outwards, and pour melted butter or white sauce over the bottoms. Stewed.—Strip off the leaves, remove the choke, and soak them in warm water for 2 or 3 hours, changing the water every hour; then put them into a stewpan with a piece of butter rolled in cayenne pepper and flour; a teacupful of gravy, and a spoonful or two of ketchup or other sauce ; add a spoon- ful of vinegar, or one of lemon-juice, before serving; let all stew till the artichokes are quite tender, and, if necessary, thicken the sauce with a little more butter. Artichoke bottoms, if dried, must be soaked, then stewed in weak gravy, or baked and served with or without forcemeat in each. Or they may be boiled in milk, and served with cream-sauce; or added to ragouts, French pies, &c. They may also be dipped in batter and fried, then served with a sauce made of fine herbs, a spoonful of oil, and the juice of lemon. A la Poivrade.—Take very small artichokes, cut them inChap. XVIII.] VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 333 quarters from the bottom, and remove the choke. Serve them in a little cold water, like radishes; make a sauce with oil, vinegar, pepper, and salt: they have the flavour of nuts. Artichauts farcis. — Parboil the artichokes, remove the middle leaves, pare the choke, and stuff1 the centre with force- meat; then put them into the oven until the meat is quite done. Serve up with melted butter. JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES 406. —Should be boiled, putting them at first into cold water, and must be taken up the moment they are done, or they will be too soft. They may be boiled plain, or served with white fricassee- sauce. When boiled, if rubbed through a sieve with a little fresh butter and cream, they form an excellent puree as a sauce for cutlets, or as a thickening for some sorts of white soup ; or they may be sliced and fried. CUCUMBERS. 407. —Stewed.—Peel them, slice them thick, or halve and divide them into 2 lengths; strew some salt and pepper, and sliced onions; add a little broth, or a bit of butter; simmer very slowly; and before serving, if no butter was in before, put some, and a little flour; or if there was butter in, only a little flour, unless it wants richness. Or :—Slice the onions and cut the cucumbers large ; flour them, and fry them in some butter; then pour on some good broth or gravy, and stew them till done enough. Farcis.—Take full-grown cucumbers, peel them, divide them lengthwise, remove the seeds, and replace them with any sort of forcemeat, seasoned with a few drops of chili vinegar; then tie them together with thread ; dip them in batter, and fry them. In Russia, cucumbers are preserved throughout the winter by being merely salted ; and they are commonly eaten raw, as in England, but without vinegar, and unpeeled. VEGETABLE MARROW—E. R. 408. —May be dressed in a variety of ways—plain-boiled, cut in slices, and served upon toast, with melted butter; or stewed in a good gravy; or boiled and mashed in the sameMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVIII. 334 manner as turnips; and if made rather thinner, with a little cream or fine white sauce, formed into a puree, to thicken soup. These purees, it must be remarked, should not, when made of the marrow or any other vegetable, be served up alone, but put into the middle of a dish, with chops or fried j)oultry of some kind, as they properly come under the denomination of sauce. To boil.—The smallest are considered the best, but when they are about 5 or 6 inches long the fruit is more mature, better flavoured, and the flesh whiter. Put them into hot water with a little salt; boil them gently till quite tender, and serve them, either whole or pared and halved, on a slice of bread toasted, with plain melted butter in a boat; or when cold they may be pared and sliced, then dipped in a batter made with an egg, a teacupful of water or milk beaten together, a little salt, and abcn.it £ lb. of flour, or sufficient to make the batter thick enough to adhere to the slices; or they may be brushed over with egg, and covered with fine bread-crumbs, and then fried. Arrange them neatly on a dish, and serve with melted butter. Stewed.-—Pare off the outer skin ; cut the gourd into slices and then into dice, taking out the seeds. Scrape a little fat bacon, which put into a stewpan with a small onion or two, and a little parsley chopped fine. Cover the stewpan close, and fry gently from 5 to 10 minutes ; then thicken with a spoonful of flour, and add a little veal broth to make the sauce the consistence of rich cream. Season with pepper and salt, re- place the cover, and stew gently until quite tender. A mush- room chopped small may be added. TO STEW CELERY. 409.—Wash the heads, and strip off their outer leaves; either halve or leave them whole, according to their size, and cut them into lengths of 4 inches. Put them into a stewpan with a cup of broth or weak white gravy; stew till tender; then add 2 spoonfuls of cream, a little flour and butter, seasoned with pepper, salt, nutmeg, and a little pounded white sugar; and simmer all together. Or:—Parboil it, cut it into quarters, fry it, and serve it on a napkin, or with beef gravy. Celery is a great improvement to all soups and gravies, and much used as a white sauce, either alone or with oysters.335 Chap. XVIII.] VEGETABLES AND SALADS. TO BOIL CAULIFLOWERS. 410. —Choose those that are close and white, cut off the green leaves, and look carefully that there are no caterpillars about the stalk; soak an hour in cold water, with a handful of salt in it; then boil them in milk and water, and take care to skim the saucepan, that not the least foulness may fall on the flower. It must be served very white, and rather crimp. In White Sauce.—Take off the whole of the leaves of a cauliflower, and half boil it; then cut it into handsome pieces, and lay them in a stewpan with a little broth, a bit of mace, a little salt, and a dust of white pepper; simmer £ an hour, but let the stalk be put down £ of an hour before the flower; then put a little cream, butter, and flour; shake, and simmer a few minutes, and serve. With Parmesan.—Boil a cauliflower; drain it on a sieve, and cut it into convenient sized pieces; arrange these pieces in a pudding basin so as to make them resemble a cauliflower when turned on the dish: season it as you proceed; turn it on the, dish, then cover it with a sauce made of grated parme- san cheese, butter, and the yolks of a couple of eggs, seasoned with lemon-juice, pepper, salt, and nutmeg ; and put parmesan grated over it. Bake for 20 minutes and brown it. Or:—Boil sprigs of cauliflower in butter and water to make them white, until they are tender; then grate £ lb. of parmesan cheese; put nearly £ into a stewpan with £ lb. of butter, a little white pepper, and 2 spoonfuls of milk; toss it until the cheese is well mixed, then warm the cauliflower in it, and serve it up with the remainder of the cheese strewed over the top. BROCOLI 411. —Is dressed in nearly the same manner ; cut the heads with short stalks, and pare the tougli skin off them; tie the small shoots into bunches, and boil them a shorter time than the heads. Some salt must be put into the water. Serve with or without toast. Poached eggs eat well with brocoli.

In the mean time have ready 6 (or more) eggs beaten ; put, for 6, i lb. of fine butter into a saucepan,- with a little salt; stir it over the fire, and, as it becomes warm, add the eggs, and shake the saucepan till the mixture is thick enough. Pour it on the hot toast, and lay the brocoli in the dish. FRENCH BEANS. 413. —Cut off the ends and stalks ; divide in half, or shred them, according to fancy; lay them in salt and water, and, when the saucepan boils, put them in with some salt. As soon as they are done, serve them immediately, to preserve the ■ green colour. Or :—When half done, drain the water off, put them into 2 spoonfuls of broth strained, and add a little cream, butter, and flour, to finish doing them. Scarlet Runners, though less delicate, are by many pre- ferred to French beans. They are boiled in the same man- ner for i of an hour or 20 minutes; and when tender, a good homely way of preparing them for the table is to place them for some short time in the dripping-pan under any meat that is roasting ; add pepper and salt; or, when boiled, mince and stew them in beef gravy. To boil, or rather simmer, as gently as possible, the seed of the dwarf scarlet runner.—Boil in soft water, for, should the water be hard, they will take 4 hours; and unless they are stewed gently, they will break and be spoiled. Put an onion shred fine into a stewpan, with a piece of butter rolled in flour; let it stew until tender, then add the beans to it, with a little hot water; stir it until it simmers together for a few minutes; then add a little salt, a tea or dessert spoonful of vinegar, a few chives or a shalot minced fine, and a sufficient quantity of parsley to give it a green colour. Serve up the beans very hot, either in a covered dish or under roast mutton. MUSHROOMS. 414. —Cooks should be perfectly acquainted with the dif- ferent sorts of things called by this name by ignorant people, as the death of many persons has been occasioned by care- lessly using the poisonous kinds. The eatable mushrooms at first appear very small and of a round form, on a little stalk. They grow very fast, and theChap. XVIII.] VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 337 upper part and stalk are white. As the size increases, the under part gradually opens, and shows a fringed fur of a very fine salmon colour, which continues more, or less till the mush- room has gained some size, and then turns to a dark brown. These marks should be attended to, and likewise whether the skin can be easily parted from the edges and middle. Those that have a white or yellow fur should be carefully avoided, though many of them have the same smell, but not so strong, as the right sort. To stew.—The large buttons are best for this purpose, and the small flaps while the fur is still red. Rub the buttons with salt and a bit of flannel; cut out the fur, and take off the skin from the others; put them into a stewpan with a little lemon-juice, pepper, salt, and a small piece of fresh but- ter, and let the whole simmer slowly till done; then put a small bit of butter and flour, with 2 spoonfuls of cream ; give them one boil, and serve with sippets of bread. To fricassee.—Peel the mushrooms, which should be large, and broil them on a gridiron. When the outside is brown, put them into a stewpan with a little milk ; when they have stewed 10 minutes, add a spoonful of white wine and the same of browning; thicken it with butter and flour, and serve it up garnished with sippets. To broil.—The largest are the best. Have a clear cinder fire; make the gridiron hot, and rub the bars with suet to prevent the mushi-ooms from sticking ; place them also on the gridiron with their stalks upwards ; sprinkle them slightly with salt and a good shake of pepper, and serve them on a hot dish, with a little cold butter under and over them. When they begin to steam they are sufficiently done. To make a Puree of Mushrooms.—Cut off the stems, but retain the heads and cleanse them. Put a little water into a stewpan, and squeeze into it the juice of a lemon ; put in the heads and drain them ; mince them as fine as possible ; put a piece of butter into a stewpan ; squeeze the juice of a lemon, and add to it the minced mushrooms. Keep it on the fire until the butter is melted ; then add 6 spoonfuls of strong gravy, and the same of thick white sauce; reduce it until the puree is sufficiently thick ; add a little pepper, and serve it up; or keep it for flavouring sauces, which it will greatly improve. zMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVIII. 338 Having thus disposed of the heads, then take the stems for buttered mushrooms, or champignons au benrre. Rub them with a little salt to clean them, and rinse them in salt water; after which, dry them with a cloth, and have ready about 2 oz. of fresh butter to every pint of stems. Put the butter into a stewpan over a cinder fire, until it begins to brown; then throw in the stems, and keep the pan on the fire for a few minutes until they become tender, continuing to shake them all the time, to prevent them from burning, and the butter from becoming oiled. Pile them in a small dish, and serve them in their own gravy, than which nothing can be finer. Some cooks flavour it with mace, and others, still more in- judiciously, with cayenne, either of which utterly spoils it. TRUFFLES, 415. —Although enumerated among vegetables, are yet not known to be capable of cultivation, but are found under ground by pigs and dogs trained for the purpose. When sold in the shops they are of different qualities—the white, the red, and the black—and are, therefore, generally thought to be of dif- ferent species; but the difference arises from the period of their ripeness, as they are always dug up the moment they are found, and the black, being the most mature, always bear the highest price. Their chief use is, along with morels, to add a high flavour to sauces, farces, and pies, as ^ oz. simmered in a pint of gravy will greatly improve them. They are also frequently employed to stuff poultry. Stewed.—Wash and brush clean the truffles, put them in a stewpan with a little wine, a slice or two of fat bacon, and a little good broth; let them boil gently until quite tender; then serve them in a napkin dry, as you would roasted chest- nuts. FRIED HERBS (as m Staffordshire). 416. —Clean and dry a good quantity of spinach-leaves, 2 large handfuls of parsley, and a handful of green onions. Chop the parsley and onions, and sprinkle them among the spinach. Set them all on to stew, with some salt, and a bit of butter the size of a walnut: shake the pan when it begins to grow warm, and let it be closely covered over a close stove till done enough. It is served with slices of broiled calf’s liver, small rashers of bacon, and eggs fried; the latter on the herbs, the other in a separate dish.Chap.

R. 417. —Boil and peel the potatoes ; let them grow nearly cold ; then cut them into slices tolerably thick, and warm them up in white sauce, or melted butter, with parsley chopped ; put into it a little white pepper and salt, and the juice of i a lemon. Or :■—Boil the potatoes, and let them become cold, then cut them into rather thick slices. Put a lump of fresh butter into a stewpan, add a little flour, about a teaspoonful for a mode- rate-sized dish; when the flour has boiled a short time in the butter add a cupful of water and a little cream ; boil all toge- ther, then put in the potatoes covered with chopped parsley, pepper, and salt; stew them for a few minutes, and then take them from the fire: add a little lemon-juice, and send to table. PUREE OF PO TA TOES. 418. —Mash the potatoes, and mix them while quite hot with some fine white gravy drawn from veal, together with butter and cream. The puree should be rather thin, and seasoned with salt, a very little pepper, and an atom of nutmeg. POTATO OMELETTE 419. —May be made with a mashed potato or 2 oz. of potato- flour and 4 eggs, and seasoned with pepper, salt, and a little nutmeg. It should be made thick, and, being rather sub- stantial, a squeeze of lemon will improve it. Fry a light brown. POMMES EE TERRE FARCIES. ■ 420.—Bake the potatoes; and, when nearly done, cut off a circular piece from the upper part, and scoop out a portion of the pulp, leaving about an inch of thickness under the peel. Then have ready any well-minced fricassee or forcemeat you please, butter the inside of the potato, and fill up the cavity with the mince heaped to a round, touch it over with raw yolk of egg, and put the potatoes again in the Dutch oven, or brown them with a salamander. I he skins should be rubbed with butter to render them crisp, or they will probably have become too hard to be peeled without breaking the potatoes, but if not a portion of it should be cut off. z 2340 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XYIII. HARICOTS BLANCS—E. R. 421. —Are the seeds of the white French bean. Though but little known in England, they are a very common dish throughout France, where they are generally stewed and served with white sauce. They come to us in a dried state, and therefore are capable of keeping for 12 months, beyond which time it is not desirable to keep them, as they then re- quire so much soaking that the flavour is destroyed. They always require a few hours’ soaking before being dressed; the usual mode in this country is to put them into cold water, boil them for an hour, and bring them up in plain white sauce, sea- soned with pepper and salt, or sometimes with chopped parsley and a few grains of sugar. A VHollandaise.—Pick and well clean the haricots; put them into a pot with cold soft water and a bit of butter. While on the fire, add cold water to soften and prevent their boiling. When well softened, drain them; put them into a saucepan with a bit of butter and some boiled and strained onions cut in dice, a little highly-seasoned gravy-soup, salt, and coarse pepper. Shake them well, and finish with a little more butter. Spanish receipt for Haricots Blancs, or Garbanzas.— Pour hot water on the beans, and soak them for 24 hours; then boil them with some lettuce or parsley, and a little ham, till they are tender. Then fry some chopped onions and a little bit of garlic, and put them in a pot. A few minutes before they are wanted pound some toasted bread with some of the beans; then mix them with an egg, add spice, and pour them into the pot; warm and send them up to table. TO DRESS CHESTNUTS FOR DESSERT. 422. —Let them be well roasted, and the husks taken off. Dissolve 4 lb. of sugar in a wineglassful of water, and the juice of a lemon. Put this and the chestnuts into a saucepan over a slow fire for 10 minutes ; add sufficient orange-flower water to flavour the syrup ; serve in a deep dish, and grate sugar over them. To be handed round whilst quite hot. TO DRESS CARDOONS, OR CHARDONS. 423. —Cut them into pieces of 6 inches long, scrape them as asparagus, tie them in bundles, boil till tender, and have ready341 Chap. XVIII.] VEGETABLES AXD SALADS. a piece of butter in a pan; flour, fry them brown, and serve in a rich brown sauce. Or :—Boil in salt and water, dry, then dip them into batter, and fry them. Serve with melted butter. Or :—Parboil, and then stew in brown or white gravy ; add cayenne, lemon-juice, and salt. Thicken with a bit of butter and flour, have a marrow-bone boiled, cut the marrow in slices, and strew over the top of the chardons. SALSIFIS, SKIRRETS, AND SCORZANERA, 424. —Are not much known in England, though all good, and deserving of more general cultivation. The salsifis are white, and not unlike small parsnips, and ripen the first year, whilst scorzanera is black, and requires 2 years in coming to perfection ; but it is preferable of the two. In flavour they somewhat resemble Jerusalem artichokes. They are much cultivated in France, and appear in the markets as a very late winter or early spring vegetable. Scrape them and throw them into water with a little lemon-juice squeezed into it to keep them white; boil in milk-and-water; serve with melted butter or white sauce; or stew them in rich brown gravy ; or, when boiled tender, dip in batter and fiy quite crisp. TOMA TA, 425. —Or “ love-apple,” is now coming very generally, and deservedly, into use, either pickled, made into ketchup, or served alone. There are two species of tomatas at present cultivated in this country, the red and the yellow. The time of their ripening is from the middle of August to October, or until the frost sets in, which mostly destroys them. The large red are much esteemed for stewing or eating, though for pickling and preserving the smaller varieties are by some considered preferable. They make an excellent puree, and may be either stewed, or roasted in a Dutch oven for i of an hour, and form a good accompaniment to any roast meat, as they contain a very deli- cate flavour of acidity. A few tomatas, when simply stewed in a little gravy, sea- soned only with salt, or mixed with a little celery, form a very pleasant vegetable dish; and if not very small, 3 or 4 will be sufficient for a moderate party.342 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XYIII. To stew.—Slice the tomatas into a well-tinned stewpan, seasoning them with pepper and salt; place bits of butter over the top. Put on the lid close, and stew gently for about 20 minutes. After this stir them frequently, letting them stew until they are well done. A spoonful or two of vinegar will be considered an improvement by many. Excellent with roast beef or mutton. Or:—Put in only sufficient tomatas to cover the bottom of the saucepan, add gravy or broth to nearly cover them, let them stew very gently until well done; then strain off the gravy, thicken it with butter mixed with flour, put the tomatas on a dish, and pour the gravy over. To bake.—Slice them into a baking-dish; season, put butter over in bits, and strew bread-crumbs on the top. Bake them for about 1 of an hour in a moderate oven. To stuff.—Cut them in halves and hollow out the centre; take whatever cold meat may be at hand, either chicken, par- tridge, or hare, with ham, &c., onions, tine herbs, crumbs of bread, and form a forcemeat ball, with beaten eggs ; fill up the centres of the tomatas, and let them stew gently in any gravy; before serving up, pass them over with a salamander or hot iron. A favourite mode of dressing them in Portugal, where they are largely grown, is, to stew them along with rice and onions in strong brown gravy; the rice forming the greater portion of the dish. There are also various other ways employed throughout the Continent, but garlic should never be added, as it destroys the delicacy of the tomata. SA UER ERA UT, 426.—Or Sour-crout, as it is called in this country, is a Ger- man preparation of cabbage, fermented in layers, between which salt is laid, and the whole pressed closely down with weights for a few days, at the end of which it becomes acid, and tire greater part of the juice is drawn oft'.a “ In preparing it, the outward leaves and the stalk are removed, the latter being sliced, and the whole cabbage cut into small pieces, which are pressed heavily down, and placed in barrels in a warm cellar until the fermentation is over : when that is complete, put the kraut into a cool place, and it will remain good for years. Some people think it improved by a mixture among the layers of carraway, whole pepper, and juniper-berries, or the barrels smoked with the latter.343 Chap. XVIII.] VEGETABLES AND SALADS. It is extensively used throughout the northern parts of Europe, as a pleasant vegetable, particularly with salted meats and sausages; and is considered so excellent an antiscorbutic that it is largely employed in our navy. It requires nothing but care in the making ; and, when properly prepared, may be served at any gentleman’s table. Boil it for 2 hours, and skim the water; or change the water for gravy, and stew it. CHICOREE, OR ENDIVE, au Veloute.—E. R. 427. —Take off the exterior of the endive, leaving nothing but the white ; let it lie in water to soak ; have it thoroughly washed ; then throw a handful of salt into a kettle of boiling water, keeping the endive under the water to prevent its turn- ing black ; when it will mix jvith the wrater it is blanched ; try with the finger if it be tender, and, if so, drain it on a sieve, and put it in cold spring water; when perfectly cold, strain it again, and squeeze it quite dry. Chop it, put a good piece of butter in a stewpan with the endive, a little salt and pepper; put in some veloule, that is, rich white sauce, or veal stock that will jelly; let it reduce till it becomes thick; send it up with croutons, i.e. fried paste, round. SORREL 428. —Forms an excellent accompaniment for young meat, or for anything the flavour of which is improved by its acidity, and is used very commonly in France, both as sauce and as a separate dish, prepared with cream in the same manner as spinach. Or:—Take any quantity of the leaves, washed clean, boil them tender in water, and pass them through a tamis; put them into a stewpan with a slice of fresh butter and a few spoonfuls of veloute; add salt and a little sugar. There are two sorts of the plant, the French and English ; the former bearing a small round leaf, and the latter much . longer, as well as duller in colour: the French is much the best. VEGETABLE RAGOUT.—E. R. 429. —Cut cold potatoes, carrots, turnips, cabbage, onions, and any other vegetables at hand into slices; put them into a stewpan, with pepper and salt, a little broth, and a piece of butter, and stir them together with a spoon until they are quiteMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY.

In India a portion of the vegetables is taken from each dish, chopped up while hot with pepper and salt, and put into a silver saucepan, with a piece of butter; and, when well heated over a lamp, sent round the table. A VEGETABLE OLIO. 430. —Boil 3 heads of small, close cabbage, carrots, turnips, potatoes, and small onions; drain them from the water, and cut them in pieces. Mix all with 2 handfuls of spinach- leaves, 2 oz. of butter, 3 spoonfuls of cream, a little salt and pepper, and stew them as closely covered as possible 2 hours; then stir in a bit of butter rolled in dour, over a clear fire. In summer, peas, cucumbers, spinach, celery, lettuces, and young onions may be dressed the same way. BRED IC OF VEGETABLES (a Dutch disk).—E. R. 431. —Brown 4 or 6 onions sliced and chopped in a little butter, then add different kinds of vegetables chopped, which have been previously boiled; stew them all together, stirring the whole time. When half done, add a few tomatas sliced, with chilis also sliced, and salt to the taste ; moisten if neces- sary with gravy, and either add a glassful of vinegar or a handful of sorrel. VEGETABLE CURRY.—E. R. 432. —Put 2 oz. of butter into a stewpan, then roll celery, onions, and broccoli in curry-powder, and stew them until tender; add a cupful of good gravy, a small quantity of mashed potatoes mixed up with curry-powder, and salt. Stew the whole together until sufficiently done. Or:—Take broccoli, cauliflower, or any other vegetable, and boil it in water until tender; then throw out the water, cut them in rather large pieces, and add either shrimps, prawns, or any minced meat, if you think proper to make such an addition; or if not, then put some fried onions with a bit of butter, a pint of water, and the usual quantity of rice and curry-powder; stew all together and add lemon-juice to the taste. If the materials be well chosen, it will be found very delicate.345 Chap. XVIII.] VEGETABLES AND SALADS. SALADS. 433.—In this country salads are almost always eaten as an accompaniment to meat, and, being composed of green vege- tables, are seldom brought to table in winter; but on the Continent other preparations are introduced under that deno- mination. Coss-lettuce and blanched endive make the best salad, the green leaves being stripped oft, and leaving nothing but the close, white hearts, which, after being washed and placed for an hour or two in cold water, should be wiped quite dry. To this should be added a head or two of celery, a couple of an- chovies (which are far preferable to the essence), and several chives, or young onions, all cut small, while the lettuces should be divided lengthwise into quarters, and cut into rather large pieces. The mixture or dressing.—For 4 persons bruise only the yolk of 1 hard-boiled egg (leaving out altogether the white), with some salt, and make it into a paste with 2 large tea- spoonfuls of moutarde de muille; or, if obliged to use common mustard, add to it a drop or two of asafoetida, which will im- part to it a slight flavour of garlic. Then add oil and vinegar in the following proportions, without using so much as to make the sauce thin, and taking care to have the finest Provence or Lucca oil, and the very strongest species of real French vine- gar : namely, to every one spoonful of vinegar add two of oil; 1 spoonful of the vinegar being impregnated with chilis, which will add warmth to the salad, much more agreeably than cayenne. A little of tarragon may be an improvement, and a spoonful of Quihi or walnut ketchup is not objectionable ; but .mushroom ketchup will destroy the pungency of flavour, and both may be left out without inconvenience. When this is done, mix the sauce well, but lightly, with the salad, to which a few slices of boiled beet-root, and the white of the egg sliced, will be a pretty addition. Kitchener's Salad Mixture, which is sold in the oil-shops in bottles ready prepared for use, is also very good, though not equal to that freshly made as above. Some people, particularly the French, eat lettuces without any other sauce than oil and vinegar, and, when eaten in that simple way, a little sugar is certainly an improvement. ButMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVIII. 346 although these proportions of oil and vinegar are stated, as above, to suit the English palate, it must yet be observed that in Trance the quantity of oil used in salads is invariably much more than double that of vinegar. The excellence of a salad consists in the vegetables being young and fresh, and they should be prepared only a short time before they are wanted ; the salad mixture being either poured into the bottom of the bowl or sent up in a sauce- tureen, and not stirred up with the vegetables until they are served. In summer salads the mixture must not be poured upon the lettuce or vegetables used in the salad, but be left at the bottom, to be stirred up when wanted, as thus preserving the crispness of the lettuce. In winter salads, however, the reverse of this proceeding must be adopted, as thus: the salad of endive, celery, beet, and other roots being cut ready for dressing, then pour the mixture upon the ingredients, and stir them well up, so that every portion may receive its benefit. In doing this, it should likewise be recollected that the spoon and fork should always be of wood, and of sufficient size to stir up the vegetables in large quantities.a CHICKEN SALAD. 434.—Pull the meat off the bones, put it into a small pan with a shalot cut in thin slices, a few sprigs of parsley, and a tablespoonful each of oil and tarragon vinegar; season the chicken well with pepper and salt; let it soak for about 3 hours. Boil 3 eggs hard, cut them in 4 pieces lengthways ; chop 2 anchovies, 6 olives, and a dessertspoonful of capers; take 3 lettuces, reserve the small hearts to garnish with, cutting them in 4, siired fine the other leaves that are white, and cut roughly some small salad ; put a layer of salad on the dish, then the chicken, sprinkle the chopped anchovy, &c., then more salad and chicken until you have used up the whole of your materials ; then mask it with a thick magnonnaise sauce: garnish it round the bottom with the lettuce-hearts and eggs alternately. This salad is much improved if the dish can be placed on pounded ice whilst it is being prepared. " As a substitute for egg in salad, rub down a dessertspoonful of a mashed potato with mustard and salt, and some cream or thick melted butter, which answers for oil when that is not at hand; then add the vinegar.347 Chap. XVIII.] VEGETABLES AND SALADS. The remains of veal and white poultry, when minced and left cold, instead of being fricasseed, will thus be found an excellent addition to the dinner of a summer’s day, with added slices of cucumber. LOBSTER SALAD. 435.—Take out the meat of the claws and body, cutting it into small pieces, and mixing it with the lettuce or endive; but previously separate the soft part of the fish adhering to the shell, with the red spawn of the hen-lobster, and blend them with the materials prepared for the dressing. It will perhaps require a little more pungency of flavour, which can be im- parted by a small additional quantity of chili or tarragon vinegar. Crab, or shrimps, may be used in the same manner; and a great improvement in either will be found by throwing in a portion of savoury calf’s-foot jelly, divided into pieces. Although shell-Jish are very decidedly the best mixture to be put into this salad, yet any sort of firm flat-fish, as turbot, brill, John-dory, or soles, which have been dressed, and partly left cold, may also be prepared in a similar way. French Salad.—Chop 3 anchovies, a shalot, and some parsley small, put them into a bowl with 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 1 of oil, a little mustard, and salt. When well mixed, add by degrees some cold roast or boiled meat in very thin slices ; put in a few at a time, not exceeding 2 or 3 inches long. Shake them in the seasoning, and then put more ; cover the bowl close, and let the salad be prepared 3 hours before it is to be eaten. Italian Salad is made by picking the white portion of a cold fowl from the bones in small flakes, piling it in the centre of a dish, and pouring a salad mixture over, enriched with cream; make a wall around with salad of any kind, laying the whites of the eggs, cut into rings, on the top in a chain. Spanish Salad.—Take whatever salad can be got, wash it in many waters, rinse it in a small net, or in napkins, till nearly dry, chop up onions and tarragon, take a bowl, put in equal quantities of vinegar and water, a teaspoonful of pepper and salt, and 4 times as much oil as vinegar and water; mix the same well together; take care never to put the lettuce intoMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVIII. 348 the sauce till the moment the salad is wanted, or it loses all its crispness and becomes sodden. On which Mr. Ford quotes a Spanish proverb which says, “ To make a good salad four persons are wanted,—a spend- thrift for oil, a miser for vinegar, a counsellor for salt, and a madman to stir it all up.” Vegetable Salads, made of roots which have been boiled, also make good winter salads, amongst which potato salad is perhaps the best. Cut the roots into thin slices, season them with pepper and salt, and pour over them the salad mixture, to which may be added, if the flavour be not disapproved, a few slices of raw onion. For Vinaigrette.—Take any kind of cold meat, chop it finely, and lay it in a dish ; chop the whites of the eggs em- ployed for the salad very finely with small onions ; add any kind of herb, and pickled cucumbers, all chopped finely: make a garnish round the meat, serve it with salad mixture, but do not stir it together, as it would spoil the appearance of the dish, which looks very pretty with the eggs and herbs in a ring. Beet-root, celery, Spanish onions, carrots, and broccoli may also in winter be cut small, and served with the same mixture as that employed for vegetables in their raw state. In summer, purslain, an herb formerly much cultivated in England, is an excellent ingredient among the many raw materials; and tomatas boiled, left until cold, sliced, not very thin, and eaten either with or without onions and any other vegetable, also make a very nice salad, in either summer or winter, as they may be preserved nearly the whole year round. When very delicately made, cream is sometimes substituted for oil in salads, as it pleases some palates, and many persons object to oil as disagreeing with their stomachs; but, in point of richness, its flavour is generally thought inferior.349 Chap. XIX.] SAUSAGES AND FORCEMEAT. CHAPTER XIX. SAUSAGES AND FORCEMEAT. SAUSAGES. 436.—In making sausages there is so great a variety of both meat and condiments, that the cook need not be tied down to any rule of composition. The usual mode is to put the pre- paration into the cleaned skins of the entrail-puddings of the smaller animals; in which the sausages, being always well seasoned, will keep sound for a few days, and are then broiled as a garnish for large dishes, or fried for breakfast. As these skins are, however, not always to be found, the sausage-meat may then be bound together with the yolk of egg and bread- crumbs, made into the form of sausages, or as croquettes of any small size; then floured, nicely warmed, and browned in the frying-pan or Dutch oven until perfectly done. If more be made than is wanted for immediate use, it may be put away in a cool place, packed closely down in a stone jar, and securely covered for some other occasion. For the spicing of sausages no rule can be laid down, as tastes and custom are constantly varying. Common Sausage-meat.—Take any quantity of lean beef or pork, with half the quantity of fat, and having freed the lean of every particle of skin, sinew, and gristle, then mince both it and the fat as fine as possible ; putting to each pound of meat a large teaspoonful of pepper and the same quantity of salt; strew this on the meat, and mix the whole thoroughly together, as a stock for further seasoning. Take 6 lbs. of meat, fat and lean ; cut the fat into small pieces, and pound the lean portion in a mortar, with 2 table- spoonfuls of salt, one of moist sugar, a teaspoonful of saltpetre, and 2 tablespoonfuls of mixed spices. To this may be added the grated peel of a lemon, and a small portion of sage and thyme, jvell chopped. Or:—To the meat of a leg of pork of about 4 lbs. weight350 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIX. add 2 lbs. of fat from the fore loin, chop both very^finT^ then add 2 nutmegs grated, 20 cloves, a teaspoonful of pounded or grated lemon-peel, 2 or 3 blades of mace pounded, 1 oz. of the best salt, and t oz. of black pepper; mix all together and stuff it into the skins, which should be well cleansed and salted the night before. This sausage- meat would be much improved for immediate use by pounding the meat and mixing it with a third portion of white bread soaked in milk and also pounded, blending the whole together with a beaten egg. BEEF SAUSAGES, 437. —Though not nearly so good as those of pork, yet, if made at home, may be found a pleasant and economical mode of using the scraps of raw meat. Proceed as for pork sausages. MUTTON SA USA GES.—E. R. 438. —Take a pound of undressed mutton, or that which has been underdone, chop it very small, and season it with pepper, salt, and beaten mace. Chop also i lb. of beef suet, 2 anchovies, a pint of oysters, i lb. of grated bread, and a boiled onion ; mix the whole with the oyster liquor, and the whites and yolks of 2 eggs well beaten ; pound the whole in a mortar. Roll into lengths, corks, or balls, and fry them. THE CAMBRIDGE SAUSAGE. 439. —Cut into small pieces 1 lb. of pork, the same quantity of beef suet, 1 lb. of beef and veal in equal parts, ^ lb. of bacon fat, and h lb. of the gammon. Chop very finely a handful of sage-leaves, and add to them a fourth part of sweet herbs. Season the whole with mixed spice, adding a spoonful of cayenne pepper, and a due quantity of salt. Let the skin be well cleaned; fill it, and tie it tightly. Put it into a saucepan of boiling water, pricking it first to prevent its burst- ing, and allow it to boil 1 hour. AN EXCELLENT SAUSAGE TO EAT COLD. 440. —Season fat and lean pork -with some salt, saltpetre, black pepper, and allspice, all in fine powder, and rub into the meat; the sixth day cut it small, and mix with it some shred shalot or garlic, as fine as possible.

The skin should be tied in dif- ferent places, so as to make each link about 8 or 9 inches long. OXFORD SA USA GES.—E. R. 441. —Take 2 lbs. of lean pork, the same quantity of lean veal, 1 lb. of suet chopped very fine and beaten in a mortar, with a French roll just wetted through with milk, ^ oz. of pepper, a little salt; mix all these ingredients well together, and pot it. When wanted beat up 4 eggs, mix the sausage- meat up in it, roll it into egg-shapes, and fry in a dry hot pan over a very quick fire. The eggs must only be added the day the sausage-meat is used. Another Oxford Receipt is to take 1 lb. of young pork, fat and lean, without skin or gristle, 1 lb. of lean veal, and 1 lb. of beef suet. Chop all fine together; add 4 lb. of grated bread, 4 the peel of a lemon shred fine, a small nutmeg grated, 6 sage-leaves washed and chopped very fine, a tea- spoonful of pepper and 2 of salt, savory, and marjoram shred fine. OYSTER SAUSAGES.—E. R. 442. -—Take 1 lb. of veal and a score of oysters bearded, then pound the veal very finely in a mortar with a little suet, season with a little pepper, soak a piece of bread in the oyster- liquor, pound, and add it with the oysters cut in pieces to the veal; beat up an egg to bind them together, and roll them into little lengths, like sausages ; fry them in butter a delicate brown. Or:—Take i lb. of lean mutton or beef, with f lb. of beef suet, and two score of oysters bearded. Mince the whole and add bread-crumbs, with 2 yolks of eggs to bind the materials together. Season with salt, white pepper, a little mace, and mushroom powder. Put it either in skins, or fry the sausage-meat of a light brown in small pieces. VEAL AND POULTRY SAUSAGES. 443. —Sausages may also be made of the remains of veal, turkey, or forvl, which have been dressed. Of either of these put equal quantities of meat and bread-crumbs, with half that of ham, seasoned with parsley, lemon-thyme, and chives.352 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIX. Mix the materials with a little pepper, salt, and pounded mace, the yolk of an egg, and a teaspoonful of flour ; make it up as sausages or small rolls to garnish fricassees or minced meat, or as a nice supper dish, piled round a sweetbread. Or .-—Chop equal quantities of lean veal and fat bacon, a handful of sage, a little salt and pepper, and a few anchovies, beat all in a mortar; and when used, roll and fry it, and serve it with fried sippets, or on stewed vegetables, or on white collops. FO WL OR RABBIT SA USA GES.-E. R. 444. —Take the remains of a fowl, rabbit, or hare; when boiled or roasted, free it from the bones, and cut it small. Boil some onions in strong gravy ; when the onions are quite soft pound them, season with salt, pepper, parsley, 2 cloves, and a blade of mace ; pound the meat also, cut some bacon into small pieces, and add it. Mix up these ingredients with the yolk of an egg, add a little lemon-juice or lemon-pickle, or chop a little sorrel with the herbs, fill the skins, and broil them. Such are the sausages usually made in this country, and most commonly eaten fresh; but, on the Continent, many sorts are made of a rather large size, seasoned in different modes, and smoked, with the intention of keeping them good for a long time, as the Brunsioick, Bayonne, and Bologna, which may always be found in the foreign oil-shops in Eng- land. There is, however, another kind, which we do not recollect to have ever seen in London, though constantly used throughout the Peninsula. SPANISH AND PORTUGUESE SAUSAGES 445. —Are made from the fat and lean of the back and loins of a well-fed two-year-old hog, cut into small pieces of less than ^ inch square, and then either finely minced or pounded together, and strongly seasoned with cloves of garlic and green or red capsicums or chilis; but as these cannot always be conveniently procured in this country, cayenne-pepper may be substituted. The whole should then be covered with any sort of strong, dry wine, until absorbed by the ingre- dients, which will occupy perhaps a few days, according to the quantity. Fill the largest skins you can get with the meat, fat andChap. XIX.] SAUSAGES AND FORCEMEAT. 353 lean alternately, occasionally adding some of the wine. Tie up in links, and hang them in a room where they will not get damp or become too dry, and they will keep 12 months. They are sometimes fried, and eaten either alone or as a relish with poultry, but more frequently put into stews ; and, in Spain, always boiled along with the olla, under the name of “ Chorisos.” BLACK PUDDINGS. 446.—The blood must be stirred with salt till cold. Put a quart of it, or rather more, to a quart of whole grits, to soak one night; and soak the crumb of a quartern loaf in rather more than 2 quarts of new milk made hot. In the mean time prepare the guts by washing, turning, and scraping, with salt and water, and changing the water several times. Chop fine a little winter-savory and thyme, a good quantity of penny- royal, pepper, and salt, a few cloves, some allspice, ginger, and nutmeg; mix these with 3 lbs. of beef-suet, and 6 eggs well-beaten and strained ; and then beat the bread, grits, &c., all up with the seasoning : when well mixed, have ready some hog’s fat cut into dice, and, as you fill the skins, put it in I at proper distances. Tie in links only half filled, and boil in a large kettle, pricking them as they swell, or they mil burst. When boiled, lay them between clean cloths, or upon straw, il till cold, and hang them up in the kitchen. When to be used, >j scald them a few minutes in water, wipe, and put them into a 1 Dutch oven. If there are not skins enough, put the stuffing into basins, and boil it covered with floured cloths; and slice and fry it when used. Or:—Soak all night a quart of bruised grits in as much boiling hot milk as will swell them and leave i pint of liquid. Chop a good quantity of pennyroyal, some leaves of sage, savory, and thyme, with salt, pepper, and allspice finely powdered. Mix the above with a quart of the blood, prepared as before directed; then half fill the skins, after they have been cleaned thoroughly, and put as much of the flare (that is, the inward fat) of the pig as will make it pretty rich. Boil as before directed. A small quantity of leeks, finely shred and well mixed, is a great a improvement.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIX. 354 WHITE PUDDINGS.—E. R. 447.—To two parts of beef-suet chopped add one part of oatmeal previously toasted before the fire; boil an onion or two, and chop them with pepper and salt; mix the whole well together, put the ingredients into skins, and boil them for an hour, pricking them as they boil to prevent their bursting. They will keep for some time in bran after they have been allowed to become cold. Parboil them when wanted, and then broil them on a gridiron. The quantity of suet may seem disproportioned to the oat- meal ; but unless there are two-thirds of the former to one of the latter, the puddings will be dry and bad. They require to be highly seasoned with pepper and onions. FORCEMEAT. French cooks pride themselves, and very justly, on the pains which they bestow on the elaboration of their force- meat, or farce. It is an art in which they have attained superior excellence, but in which there is no great difficulty. At many tables, where everything else is well done, it is common to find very bad stuffing, which, according to what it is wanted for, should be a selection from the following list, observing that of the most pungent articles least must be used. A general fault is, that the tastes of lemon-peel and thyme overcome all others, therefore they should only be used in small quantities; and except in a few very savoury dishes, cayenne and pepper of all kinds should be sparingly used. No one flavour should predominate greatly; yet if several dishes be served the same day, there should be a marked variety in the tastes of the forcemeats as well as of the gravies. The forcemeat should be consistent enough to be cut with a knife, but not dry and heavy. Herbs are a very essential in- gredient, and it is the copious but judicious use of them that chiefly gives the cookery of the French its superior flavour. Bacon or butter must always be substituted for suet when the forcemeat is to be eaten cold. The flavour given to the bread, or panada, is considered to be of great importance, and the highest point of perfection may be obtained by attending to the following directions:—355 Chap. XIX.] SAUSAGES AND FORCEMEAT. PANADA. 448.—Put into a small stewpan 1 oz. of fresh butter, a table- spoonful of chopped mushrooms, a little chopped thyme and parsley, t a blade of mace, pepper and salt; stew the whole over the fire for a few minutes, then add to it a spoon- ful of white broth, the crumb of two French rolls previously soaked in milk and squeezed thoroughly dry; stir over the fire until it no longer adheres to the stewpan ; take it off, add the yolks of two eggs, turn it out and leave it to cool; it is then ready for use. UDDER. 449 _Boil a calf’s udder in broth or water ; when cold trim off the outside ; pound and rub through a sieve. QUENELLE. 450.—This is one of the most delicate preparations of force- meat that we have, and requires practice, care, and attention to make it in perfection. It is called according to the meat of which it is composed : quenelles of rabbit, chicken, fish, or game. Take the meat of two rabbits, pound it and rub it through a sieve; take the same quantity of panada and also of udder or very sweet fresh butter, pound these ingredients for a quarter of an hour, add a tablespoonful of white sauce, two eggs, and two yolks; take a small piece, roll it in a ball, and throw it in boiling water; when done it should cut firm and consistent, yet light and delicate; if more seasoning is required it should be added before it is taken out of the mortar. To mould them: have two tablespoons, fill one with the farce, shape with a knife, dipping it in boiling water to make it perfectly smooth ; dip the other spoon in hot water, with which take out the quenelle and lay it in a buttered stewpan; they should be egg-shaped, and perfectly smooth, and boiled for i of an hour. Panada for Fish Quenelle, or Forcemeat.—Put two-thirds of £ pint of water into a stewpan holding a quart, with nearly 1 oz. of butter ; when boiling, stir in £ lb. of flour; keep it moving over the fire until it forms a smooth and tough paste. Take it off the fire, add the yolks of 3 eggs. When cold, use it where directed. 2 a 2356 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIX. FORCEMEAT. 451. —Take equal quantities of cold chicken, veal, and beef, shred very small, and mixed together; season, at the same time, with a moderate quantity of pepper, salt, sweet herbs, and grated nutmeg—that is to say, if intended for white meat, or for anything delicately flavoured; but if meant for a savoury dish, add a little minced ham, and an atom of garlic or a shalot. Put the whole in a stone mortar, and pound it until quite fine, then make it into a paste with a raw egg, some butter, marrow, or fat of some kind. When used, it may either be rolled into round balls and fried for any made dish, or put into any joint of meat or poultry as stuffing; and if kept in a cool place, and well seasoned, it will keep good for several days. Indeed, by mixing with any potted meat or game an equal proportion of panada, which will always be lighter than bread- crumbs, the cook will have at once a very fine species of farce, to be employed in stuffing olives, fillets of fowl, &c. The “farce” is sometimes a delicious preparation of .sau- sage-meat, and is served up alone; but it enters into the com- position of numerous other dishes. Another Forcemeat.—Take 1 £ lb. of lean veal, pound it, * and pass it through a sieve; 1 lb. of chopped beef suet, and 6 oz. of panada, pounded well together; add the veal, season with pepper, salt, and a little nutmeg; mix well; then add the yolks of 6 eggs and the whites of 3; when these are thoroughly mixed, whisk the other 3 whites of eggs to a very stiff froth, and add it to the forcemeat; when all is well mixed together, it is fit for use. FARCE CUITE.—E. R. 452. —Cut in small pieces some undressed fowl; put them into a stewpan with a piece of butter, a little salt, pepper, and a little nutmeg ; shake them over the fire for 10 minutes, drain, and let them cool. Put an equal portion of crumbs of bread in the same stewpan with some broth, and a little parsley chopped fine; stir it with a wooden spoon till it becomes quite soft. Let it get cold, then pound the fowl until it will pass through a tamis; pound the bread also, and put it through the sieve ; then put equal parts of the meat, butter, and bread together, and pound them with yolks of eggs sufficient to make it into a proper consistence, and keep it in a jar for use.Chap. XIX.] SAUSAGES AND FORCEMEAT. 357 FARCE OF HAM AND VEAL.—E. R. 453. —Mince equal quantities of ham and veal, a bunch of parsley, and some pepper; put it on the fire with a little broth ; let it stew very gently, then pound it in a mortar; add to it an equal portion of bread soaked in milk and pounded ; pound the whole together with some butter, and mix it with the yolks of eggs. Bacon and veal which have been used in braising, or any- thing highly impregnated with the flavour of herbs and onions, and very rich, may be employed afterwards as a farce, pounded and mixed with panada.1 STUFFING. 454. —Take equal quantities of beef-suet and crumbs of bread; chop the suet very finely; chop together marjoram, thyme, and parsley, having as much parsley as there is thyme and’ marjoram together; add to them a saltspoonful of grated lemon-peel, pepper, salt, and a little grated nutmeg; add eggs sufficient to bind it together. Seasoning for Stuffing.—1 lb. salt dried and sifted, £ oz. ground white pepper, 2 oz. dried thyme, 1 oz. dried marjoram, and 1 oz. nutmeg. When this seasoning is used, parsley only is required to be chopped in sufficient quantity to make the stuffing green. The proportions are—i lb. bread-crumbs, 3 eggs, £ lb. suet, i oz. seasoning, and peel of ^ a lemon grated. Or Forcemeat. — Shred a little ham or gammon, some cold veal or fowl, some beef-suet, a small quantity of onion, • some parsley, very little lemon-peel, salt, nutmeg or pounded mace, and either white pepper or cayenne, and bread- crumbs. Pound it in a mortar, and bind it with 1 or 2 eggs, beaten or strained. For forcemeat patties, the mixture as above. For Hare, or anything in imitation of it.—The scalded liver, an anchovy, some fat bacon, a little suet, some parsley, thyme, knotted marjoram, a little shalot, and either onion or chives, all chopped fine; crumbs of bread, pepper, and nut- meg, beat in a mortar with an egg. “ Farce for pies. See No. 546.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIX. 358 Fish Forcemeat.—Chop, and afterwards pound in a mortar, any kind of fish, adding an anchovy or two, or a teaspoonful of the essence of anchovies, but do not allow the taste to pre- vail, and the yolk of a hard-boiled egg. If for maigre, pound butter with it; but otherwise, the fat of bacon pounded sepa- rately, and then mixed. Add a third portion of bread, pre- pared by soaking and pounding previously, and mix the whole up with raw eggs. For mackerel, pike, haddock, and soles, take the veal forcemeat, add a little anchovy essence, and use rather less herbs. Oyster Forcemeat.—Take a dozen natives, strain them from the liquor, mince them, and add \ lb. of finely-grated bread- crumbs, H oz. of butter broken very small, a dessertspoonful of parsley, the grated rind of i a lemon ; season with a little mace, cayenne, and salt; mix well; then bind together with the yolk of an egg unbeaten, and a little of the oyster liquor. Care must be taken that the oyster flavour predominates. FORCEMEAT BALLS FOR SOUP MAIGRE. 455.—Forcemeat balls for meagre soups of any description should be always used to compensate for the savour of which they are deprived by the want of meat-broth ; and may be made of fish and sweet herbs, or only of herbs and crumbs of bread, in the following manner:— Pound in a mortar the soft parts of a crawfish, or a few shrimps, with an anchovy, and the yolk of a hard-boiled egg, beaten up with crumbs of stale bread, pounded mace, cayenne pepper, salt, and a very little finely minced garlic. Then work it up into a paste with a raw egg to bind it into dough; roll it out, cut it into small balls of the size of marbles, and fry them of a fine brown. Or:—Leave out the fish, and make them entirely of bread and savoury chopped herbs—chervil, tarragon, marjoram, and thyme, with a little garlic and a shalot—and bind them up as above, with egg, butter, and crumbs of bread. Or:—Chop, and afterwards pound in a mortar, any kind of fish, adding an anchovy or two, or a teaspoonful of the essence of anchovies, but do not allow the taste to prevail, and the yolk of a hard-boiled egg : pound butter with it; add a third portion of bread, prepared by soaking and pounding previously, and mix the whole up with raw eggs.Chap. XIX.] SAUSAGES ANT) FORCEMEAT. 359 1 Or :—Beat the flesh and soft parts of a middling-sized lob- ster, half an anchovy, a large piece of boiled celery, the yolk of a hard egg, a little cayenne, mace, salt, and white pepper, with 2 tablespoonfuls of bread-crumbs, 1 ditto of oyster- liquor, 2 oz. of butter warmed, and 2 eggs long beaten : make into balls, and fry of a fine brown in butter. Or:—Take a few shrimps, stripped of their shells, an an- chovy, and the yolk of a hard-boiled egg, with bread-crumbs and seasoning as above, but adding some finely-minced sweet herbs, and omitting the oyster-liquor : make all this into a paste with a little butter and a raw egg, made up in balls and fried as before. Or:—Instead of making the balls of fish and frying them, it is a more simple way to make them merely of bread-crumbs, hard-boiled egg, and sweet herbs seasoned with raw egg: drop the balls, one by one, into the boiling soup a few minutes before serving. 2 eggs and j lb. of bread should make 12 or 15 balls. Or:—Pound in a mortar, into a smooth substance, an an- chovy, the yolk of a hard-boiled egg, a head of boiled celery, and some sweet herbs, with a couple of tablespoonfuls of bread- crumbs, seasoned with mace, a grating of nutmeg, cayenne, and salt; then add 2 oz. of butter melted, and work it into a paste with a little flour and the yolk of a raw egg; make it into balls the size of marbles, and fry them quite brown. FORCEMEA T FOR TUR TLE (as at the Bush, Bristol). 456.—1 lb. of fine fresh suet, 1 lb. of ready-dressed veal or chicken chopped fine, crumbs of bread, a little shalot or onion, salt, white pepper, nutmeg, mace, pennyroyal, parsley, and lemon-thyme finely shred ; beat as many fresh eggs, yolks and whites separately, as will make the above ingredients into a moist paste ; roll into small balls, aifll boil them in fresh lard, putting them in just as it boils up. When of a light brown, take them out, and drain them before the fire. If the suet be moist or stale, a great many more eggs will be necessary. Balls made this way are remarkably light; but being greasy, some people prefer them with less suet and eggs. They may therefore be made thus:—Chop up the materials with a little white pepper and salt, a sage-leaf or two scalded and finely chopped, and the yolk of an egg; make them into small cakes or fritters, and fry them. i360 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIX. Eggs for Turtle.—Beat 3 hard yolks of eggs in a mortar, and make into a paste with the yolk of a raw one; roll it into small balls, and throw them into boiling water for 2 minutes to harden. Though formerly much used, they have latterly gone out of fashion. PASSOVER BALLS FOR SOUP.—E. R. 457.—Chop an onion and i lb. of suet very finely; stew them together until the suet is melted, then pour it hot upon 8 spoonfuls of biscuit-flour; mix it well together; add a little salt, a little grated nutmeg, lemon-peel, and ginger, and 6 eggs. Put the balls into the soup when it boils, and boil them for i of an hour. The quantity of eggs and flour may appear disproportioned, but the flour employed is of a peculiar kind, used for the purpose in Jewish families. Nothing can exceed the excellence of the balls made after this receipt: they are applicable to any kind of soups.Chap. XX.] CUEING MEAT. 361 CHAPTER XX. CURING MEAT, POTTING, AND COLLARING. CURING. 458.'—In salting all meat, care should be taken to remove the kernels, otherwise it will soon become tainted. It should be sprinkled with a handful of common salt to fetch out the blood, the brine thrown away on the following day, and the meat wiped with a dry cloth ; it is then ready to be cured in any of the undermentioned ways. Too much care cannot be taken in the first salting to rub between every muscle or imder every flap of the meat, as for want of this care it may have an unpleasant taste, though sufficiently salted. The brine will serve again, by being boiled and skimmed, which may be repeated as long as any scum will rise. Hams should be laid with the rind-side ^downwards; and it is a good plan to heat f peck of common salt in a frying-pan and lay it at the bottom of the pan. A small quantity of saltpetre is necessary to produce the fine red colour either in ham or beef; but much will make the meat hard, and the proportions of sugar and salt should be varied according to the preference given to highly-salted provisions, or those which are cured ' milder. TO CORN BEEF. 459.—A Round of Beef of 18 or 20 lbs. weight.—Mix 1 + oz. of sal-prunella, 3 oz. of brown sugar, ^ oz. of black pepper, 6 oz. of bay-salt, i oz. of cloves pounded, the same of nut- meg, and % lb. of common salt: take out the bone, and rub the piece over with common salt; let it remain for a day or two, and then rub into it the above ingredients finely pow- dered and thoroughly mixed ; let it lie a fortnight, and turn it daily. It should then be hung up in a dry place, and, if possible, smoked till wanted for use, when it should be either362 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XX. boiled gently, or baked in a deep dish covered with coarse paste. This, it may however be observed, is rather a superior mode; as the common way is merely to use bay-salt, with occasionally a little saltpetre to give a tinge of redness to the meat, which is seldom smoked except for very large joints. Many persons, indeed, think the meat best when stewed; in which case, put no more water in the pot than will barely cover the meat, and keep it gently simmering for 4, 5, or 6 hours, ac- cording to the size of the joint. To salt Beef red.—Choose a piece of beef with as little bone as you can (the flank is the best), sprinkle it, and let it drain a day; then rub it with common salt, a small proportion of saltpetre, bay-salt, and a little coarse sugar; you may add a few grains of cochineal, all in fine powder. Rub the pickle every day into the meat for a week, then only turn it. It will be excellent in 8 days. In 16, drain it from the pickle; and let it be smoked at the oven’s mouth when heated with wood, or send it to the baker’s. A few days will smoke it. It is extremely good eaten fresh from the pickle, boiled tender with greens or carrots. If to be grated, then cut a lean bit, boil it till extremely tender, and while hot put it under a press. When cold, fold it in a sheet of paper, and it will keep in a dry place 2 or 3 months, ready for serving on bread and butter. THE DUTCH WAY TO SALT BEEF. 460. —Take a lean piece of beef, rub it well with treacle or brown sugar, and turn it often. In 3 days wipe it, and salt it with common salt and saltpetre beaten fine; rub these well in, and turn it every day for a fortnight. Roll it tight in a coarse cloth, and press it under a heavy weight; hang to dry in wood- smoke, but turn it upside down every day. Boil it in pump- water, and press it: it will grate or cut into shivers, and makes a good breakfast dish. To 12 lbs. of beef the proportion of common salt is 1 lb. HAMBURG BEEF.—E. R. 461. —Take a piece of ribs of beef of about 15 lbs. weight, and rub it well with common salt; let it lie for a day or two. Take 2 oz. of sal-prunella, 4 oz. of bay-salt, 4 oz. of coarse363 CURING MEAT. Chap. XX.] brown sugar, J oz. of white pepper, and j oz. of cloves and mace; mix and pound these all well together, and rub them well into the beef; let it lie for a fortnight, taking care to turn it daily. When taken out of the pickle it should be smoked, either by lighted oak sawdust or in the chimney of a kitchen where wood is burned. Or:—To 16 lbs. of beef put 1 lb. of common salt, 1 lb. of treacle, 2 oz. of bay-salt, and 1 oz. of saltpetre; rub the salt thoroughly over the beef, and pour the treacle upon it. Let it be turned every day, and well rubbed in the pickle. At the end of 3 weeks put it to dry in wood-smoke. The under bed is the best part for this purpose, but the ribs may also be used. SPICED BEEF.—E. R. 462.—Make a brine with i lb. of salt, i oz. of saltpetre, i lb. of sugar, 30 cloves, as many allspice and black pepper- corns, 6 bay-leaves ; crack the spice, put it on to boil for a few minutes in a pint of water; when cold, pour it over a piece of beef about 10 lbs. Turn it every day for a fortnight. When required for use, put the beef into a deep pan with the brine, a little water, and about 1 lb. of suet. Bake it until tender; let it get cold in the brine. Spiced Flank of Beef.—Take 8 or 10 lbs. of the thin flank, remove any skin, gristle, or bones; rub it over with y oz. of saltpetre and 4 oz. of bay-salt; then rub it well in with a mix- ture of spices, the following proportions being used:—1 oz. of black pepper, 1 oz. of allspice, ^ oz. of ground ginger, i oz. of cloves, and half the quantity of mace. Use only as much as will suffice to rub the beef all over ; then add 3 oz. of com- . mon salt and i lb. of coarse sugar ; let the beef remain a fort- night in this pickle, turning it and rubbing it every day : then take it out, cover it with the spices and chopped sweet herbs, roll it very tight, tie it with tape, put it into a pan with ^ pint of water and i lb. of suet, and bake it or boil it gently for 4 hours ; put a heavy weight upon it, and when cold take off the tape. There will be a fine jelly at the bottom of the pan, which should be cleared from fat, and mixed with an equal portion of jelly from an ox-foot, as it will be too salt to eat alone, or it may be used in soups. Leicestershire Spiced Beef—Take a round of beef, rub in i lb. of saltpetre finely pounded ; let it stand a day, then seasonMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XX. 364 it with i lb. of bay-salt, 1 oz. of black pepper, the same of all- spice, both pounded. Let it lie in the pickle a month, turning it every day, and adding about three times a-week a small quantity of common salt. Then wash off the salt and spice; cut some fat bacon into pieces about i inch square, and long enough to penetrate the beef; roll them in spices, $ oz. of mace, 3 large nutmegs, a teaspoonful of cayenne, and the same of black pep- per, pounded; lard the beef with the bacon, and a green stuff- ing made of chopped herbs. Put the beef into a pan deep enough to hold it; lay a great quantity of beef-suet at the bottom of the pan, and also on the top of the beef. Tie the beef round with tape, to preserve its shape, before it is put into the pan ; cover the pan first with brown paper, then with paste made of barley-flour, and another paper on the top. Put it into a quick oven, and bake it 7 or 8 hours. Pour off the fat and gravy, and let it be cold before it is cut. WELSH BEEF.—E. R. 463. —Rub 2 oz. of saltpetre into a round of beef, let it re- main an hour, then season it with pepper, salt, and a fourth portion of allspice ; allow the beef to stand in the brine for 15 days, turning it frequently. Work it well with pickle ; put it into an earthen vessel, with a quantity of beef-suet over and under it, cover it with a coarse paste and bake it, allowing it to remain in the oven for 6 or 8 hours. Pour off the gravy, and let the beef stand till cold. It will keep for 2 months in winter, and will be found useful amid the Christmas fare in "the country. HUNTERS’ BEEF.—E. R. 464. —To a round of beef weighing 24 lbs. take 3 oz. of saltpetre, 3 oz. of the coarsest sugar, 1 oz. of cloves and nut- meg, t oz. of allspice, and 3 handfuls of common salt, all in the finest powder. Allow the beef to hang 2 or 3 days, remove the bones, then rub the spices well into it, continuing to do so every day for 2 or 3 weeks. When to be dressed, dip it in cold water to take off the loose spice. Bind it up tightly with tape, and put it into a pan with a teacupful of water at the bottom; cover the top of the meat with shred suet; cover the pan with a coarse crust, and brown paper over it. Let it bake 5 hours, and when cold take off the paste and the tape.Chap. XX.] CURING MEAT. ' 365 Some persons stuff the orifice from which the bone was taken with parsley finely chopped, putting sweet herbs also all round between the skin and the meat. HUNG BEEF (the Herrynane Receipt).—E. R. 465. —Rub the beef well with salt and saltpetre, in the pro- portion of 2 oz. of saltpetre and 7 lbs. of salt to 50 lbs. of beef. Put the beef into a cask or tub, place a board over it, and weights upon that; leave it so for about a fortnight, then take it out and hang it in the kitchen to dry, which will generally take about 3 weeks. Some persons leave it for a longer time in the tub, which they merely cover without the weight; but the above is the better way. TO CURE TONGUES. 466. —Neats’ tongues cured with the whole root on look much larger, but have not any other advantage, being too hard to cut pleasantly when salted. If the root is to be re- moved, cut it off near the gullet, but without taking away the fat that is under the tongue. The root must be soaked in salt and water a night, and extremely well cleaned before it be dressed, when it is very good stewed with gravy ; or may be salted 2 days, and used for pea-soup. Having left the fat and a little of the kernel under the tongue, sprinkle it with salt and let it drain until next day. Then for each tongue mix a large spoonful of common salt, the same quantity of coarse sugar, half as much saltpetre, a teaspoonful of ground pepper, and 2 cloves of garlic or shalot chopped very fine; rub it well in, and do so every day for a week; then add . another large spoonful of salt. If rubbed daily, a tongue will be ready in 10 days ; but if only turned in the pickle, it will not be too salt in 4 or 5 weeks, but should not be kept longer. When to be dried, write the date of the day on parchment, and tie it on. Smoke 3 days, or hang them in a dry place without smoking. When to be dressed, boil the tongue ex- tremely tender; allow 5 hours, and if done sooner it is easily kept hot. The longer it is kept after smoking, the higher will be the flavour; but in the estimation of many persons they are best dressed out of the pickle; if hard, it may require soaking 4 or 5 hours. Or :—Put the tongue into an earthen pan, rub into it a366 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XX. tablespoonful of saltpetre, a good handful of salt, and the same quantity of coarse brown sugar ; allow the tongue to remain in the pickle for 3 weeks, and rub it over every day. Then take it out and put it into the meat-screen before the fire for 2 or 3 days, till the pickle has entirely drained from it. Then sprinkle it over with bran, and hang it up in any part of the kitchen with the root-end uppermost; sew salt tongues up in coarse linen. To cure Sheep's Tongues.—Let the tongues be well washed and cleaned, and lay them in spring water for 4 an hour. Take 1 lb. of salt, i lb. of treacle, and 4 oz. of saltpetre ; rub the tongues well with it, and put them into the pickle: a week or 10 days will be sufficient to cure them. FOR CURING HAMS. 467.—Choose the leg of a hog that is fat and well fed, as well as of a certain age; for, if poor, it is not worth curing, and if not 1 year old it will never acquire the fine flavour of a mellow ham. Sprinkle it with a little salt, and let it drain for a day; then put to it 1 lb. each of bay-salt and the coarsest sugar, with a large handful of common salt and 4 oz. of saltpetre; rub it thoroughly with this; lay the rind downwards, and cover the fleshy parts with the salt, with which baste it frequently, and turn it every second day. Keep it in this for 4 weeks, then drain it and throw bran over it; hang it up in a cool place to dry, then sew it up in a coarse linen wrapper rubbed with lime, and do not dress it until full 3 months old. The better way is, however, to smoke it, for which there are in London and most large towns regular smoke-houses. In country places this is not uncommonly done by hanging it in a kitchen chimney where wood is burnt, or in any spare chimney where a smothering fire can be kept up, made of wet straw and horse-litter, with sawdust or shavings; but be par- ticular to have them of oak, for, if of pine, it will give the ham a bad flavour. It will take 3 weeks’ smoking. Or:—Hang the ham, and sprinkle it with salt as above; then rub it every day with the following, in fine powder: 41b. of common salt, the same quantity of bay-salt, 2 oz. of salt- petre, and 2 oz. of black pepper, mixed with 14 lb. of treacle.Chap. XX.] CURING MEAT. 367 Another way, that gives a higher flavour.—When the weather will permit, hang the ham 3 days ; mix 1 oz. of salt- petre with i lb. of bay-salt, the same quantity of common salt, and also of coarse sugar, and a quart of strong beer; boil them together, and pour them immediately upon the ham; turn it twice a-day in the pickle for 3 weeks. 1 oz. of black pepper, and the same quantity of allspice, in fine powder, added to the above, will give still more flavour. Or;—Sprinkle the ham with salt, after it has hung 2 or 3 days ; let it drain ; make a pickle of a quart of strong beer, a lb. of treacle, 1 oz. of coriander-seeds, 2 oz. of juniper- berries, 1 oz. of pepper, the same quantity of allspice, 1 oz. of saltpetre, i oz. of sal-prunella, a handful of common salt, and a head of shalot, all pounded or cut fine. Boil these all toge- ther a few minutes, and pour them over the ham : this quantity is for one of 10 lbs. FITZSIMON FAMILY RECEIP T FOR CURING HAMS.—E. R. 468. —Mix 1 oz. of saltpetre, 1 lb. of common salt, and 1 lb. of coarse brown sugar all together, and rub the ham well. Let it lie for a month in this pickle, turning and basting it every day ; then hang it in wood-smoke in a dry place, where no heat can come to it, and, if to be kept long, hang it for a month or two in a damp place, and it will eat firm and short. Observe, hams thus made need not be soaked ; put them into cold water, and let them be 3 or 4 hours before they boil, skimming the pot well and often until it boils. These hams have been made with a less quantity of salt and an additional quantity of saltpetre, and it has been found to answer well, the hams being in that case soaked before boiling. WESTPHALIA HAMS.—E. R. 469. —Prepare the hams in the usual manner by rubbing them with common salt and draining them ; take 1 oz. of salt- petre, i lb. of coarse sugar, and the same quantity of salt; rub it wrell into the ham, and in 3 days pour a pint of vinegar over it. A fine foreign flavour may also be given to hams by pouring old strong beer over them, and burning juniper-wood while they are drying : molasses, juniper-berries," and highly- flavoured herbs, such as basil, sage, bay-leaves, and thyme, mingled together, and the hams well rubbed with it, using368 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XX. only a sufficient quantity of salt to assist in the cure, will afford an agreeable variety. MUTTON HAM.—E. R. 470. —Cut a hind quarter of mutton in the shape of a ham, and allow it to hang for 2 or 3 days. Mix 4 lb. of bay-salt, 2 oz. of saltpetre, £ lb. of common salt, and ^ lb. of coarse sugar, all well pounded together, and make them quite hot before the fire. Then rub it well into the meat, turning it in the liquor every day; after 4 days add 2 oz. more of common salt. Let it remain 12 days in the brine, then take it out, dry it, and hang it up in woocl-smoke for a week. Another pickle for mutton-ham may be made with 1 oz. of saltpetre to I lb. of coarse sugar and 1 lb. of salt; the ham to be kept in this pickle for a fortnight, then rolled in sawdust, and hung in wood-smoke for 14 days. GOOSE HAMS 471. —Are made by splitting the goose down the back, rubbing it with £ oz. of saltpetre, and then salting it well with common salt and coarse brown sugar; let it lie in pickle for 10 days in summer and 14 in winter, rub and turn it every day, roll it in sawdust and smoke it. In Pomerania, on the shores of the Baltic, where vast numbers are cured, the breasts are prepared separately as hams; and being much dried in smoking, are always eaten without further dressing. In the fens of Lincolnshire the geese, when their feathers have been plucked, are also salted. BACON. 472. — The method of curing Malines Bacon, so much admired for its fine flavour.—Cut off the hams and head of a pig, if a large one; take out the chine and leave in the spare- rib, as they will keep in the gravy and prevent the bacon from rusting. Salt it first with common salt, and let it lie for a day on a table that the blood may run from it; then make a brine with a pint of bay-salt, i peck of common salt, about i lb. of juniper-berries, and some bay-leaves, with as much water as will, when the brine is made, cover the bacon ; when the salt is dissolved, and when quite cold, if a new-laid egg will swim in it, the brine may be put on the bacon, which after a weekChap. XX.] CUEING MEAT. 369 must be rubbed with the following mixture:—i lb. of saltpetre, 2 oz. of sal-prunella, and 1 lb. of coarse sugar ; after remaining 4 weeks it may be hung up in a chimney where wood is burned ; shavings, with sawdust and a small quantity of turf, may b e added to the fire at times. The Black Pool receipt for curing Bacon.—Toy a mid- \ dling-sized hog take 12 lbs. of the best common salt, and 1 lb. 1 of saltpetre pounded very finely ; rub it in well, and cover the I meat about an inch thick, hams, chaps, and all, placing it 1 with the rind downwards. Let it remain for a week; then i take off the salt, turn the whole with the rind upwards, then 1 lay the salt on again for another week. Then remove the 3 salt, and turn it a second time; lay on the salt and let it remain 4 days longer. It will then be properly salted. Wipe it clean, rub it all over with dry salt, and hang it, where it will hav e a little air of the fire, until it is dry. Then sew it :j up in whity-brown paper, and hang it in a dry place where no heat can come to it; and if these precautions are taken, it will > not get rusty. The meat must be salted on a board that is well perforated ; j with holes to let the brine run from it, and it must be covered j up closely with a coarse cloth to keep out the air; and while salting take care to lay the pieces as close as possible one upon the other. WILTSHIRE BACON. 473.—Sprinkle each flitch with salt, and let the blood drain off for 24 hours. Then mix 14 lb. of coarse sugar, the same quan- tity of bay-salt, 6 oz. of saltpetre, and 4 lbs. of coarse salt; rub this well on the bacon, turning and wetting it in every part, daily, for a month ; then hang it to dry, and afterwards smoke it 10 days. The above quantity of salt is sufficient for a whole hog of >a about 7 or 8 score. To cure Bacon for larding and braising.—Take the fattest | part of the pork, and to every 10 lbs. use 1 lb. of pounded j salt; rub it very well over, put the pieces one upon another | upon boards, and lay boards with a heavy weight upon the i top ; leave it in a dry cool place for about a month, then hang ] it up to dry without smoking. The hardest is the best for , larding; and bacon cured in this way is preferable for culinary 2 BMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap.

HOG'S CHEEKS. 474. —Cut out the snout, remove the brains, and split the head, taking off the upper bone, to make the chowl a good shape; rub it well with salt; next day take away the brine, and salt it again the following day with a quart of bay-salt, 2 quarts of common salt, and 11 lb. of brown sugar, put into 11 gallon of spring water; stir it until the whole is dis- solved. This quantity will be sufficient for 3 pairs of chaps: be careful to turn them in the brine at least every other day, and to keep them well covered. Dry them in wood-ashes. BRA WN. 475. —Split and nicely clean a hog’s head, take out the brains, cut off the ears, and rub a good deal of salt into the head ; let it drain 24 hours; then lay upon it 2 oz. of salt- petre, and the same of common salt, for 3 days; lay the head and salt into a pan, with just water to cover it, for 2 days more. Wash it well, and boil until the bones will come out; re- move them, and chop the meat as quickly as possible in pieces of 1 inch long; but first take the skin carefully off the head and the tongue, the latter also cut in bits. Season with pepper and salt. Put the skin of one side of the head into a small long pan, press the chopped head and tongue into it, and lay the skin of the other side of the head over, and press it down. When cold it will turn out. The head may probably be too fat, in which case prepare a few bits of lean pork with the head. Boil 2 oz. of salt, a pint of vinegar, and a quart of the liquor, and, when cold, pour it over the head. The ears are to be boiled longer than the head, cut in thin strips, and divided about it, the hair being nicely removed. Reboil the pickle often. Another mock Brawn.—Boil a pair of neat’s feet very tender; take the meat off, and have ready the belly-piece of pork, salted with common salt and saltpetre for a week. Boil this till nearly done; take out the bones, and roll the feet and the pork together. Then roll it very tight with a strong cloth and coarse tape. Boil it till very tender, then hang it up in the cloth till cold ; after which keep it in a sousing liquor. To keep Brawn, the Cambridge way.—To 2 gallons of371 CURING MEAT. Chap. XX.] water put 1 lb. of wheat-bran and 1 lb. of salt; boil 1 hour ; when cold, strain it, and keep the brawn in it. In 10 or 12 days fresh pickle will be required. If, by length of carriage or neglect, the brawn be kept too long out of pickle, make as above, and when rubbed well with salt, and washed with some of the pickle, it will be quite restored to its former goodness. TO FICKLE PORK.—E. R. 476. —Take i bushel of common salt, 1 lb. of bay-salt, i lb. of saltpetre, and 6 lbs. of coarse brown sugar; make hams of the legs. Take the sides of the pork and rub them well with common salt, lay a thin bed of salt in the tray, and place one of the sides in it; sprinkle with salt to cover it: lay the other side on the top, and sprinkle it also. Let them lie 2 or 3 days, rubbing the salt well in; then cover the whole with the other ingredients, and, as soon as the salt begins to give, rub them well in ; turn the sides frequently, and let them be covered with brine: it will be fit for use in 6 or 8 weeks. These quantities are for a pig of 15 or 16 score. A PICKLE 477. — That will keep for years, for hams, tongues, or beef, if boiled and skimmed between each parcel of them.—To 2 gallons of spring water put 2 lbs. of coarse sugar, 2 lbs. of bay and lbs. of common salt, and ^ lb. of saltpetre, in a deep earthen glazed pan that will hold 4 gallons, and with a cover that will fit close. Keep the beef or hams as long as they will bear before you put them into the pickle; and sprinkle them with coarse sugar in a pan, from which they must drain. Rub the hams, &c., well with the pickle, and pack them in tlose, putting as much as the pan will hold, so that the pickle may cover them. The pickle is not to be boiled at first. A small ham may lie 14 days, a large one 3 weeks ; a tongue 12 days, and beef in proportion to its size. They will eat well out of the pickle without drying. When they are to be dried, let each piece be drained over the pan; and when it will drop no longer, take a clean sponge and dry it thoroughly. 6 or 8 hours will smoke them, and there should be only a little sawdust and wet straw burnt to do this; but if put into a baker’s chimney, sew them in a coarse cloth, and hang them a week. Add 2 lbs. of common salt and 2 pints of water every time you boil the liquor. 2 c 2MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XX. 372 POTTING AND COLLARING. 478. —To pot and collar are only different modes of pre- serving fish and meat for a longer time than they could be kept fresh; chiefly, in the instance of potting, by pounding the materials with seasoning, when dressed, and then putting small portions in closely covered jars or pots ; while collaring is done by slicing portions of the meat or fish, and, when well seasoned, rolling it in round pieces, to be eaten cold as savoury dishes at breakfast and luncheon. In potting, take care to wait until the meat is cold ; press the meat firmly into the pots ; but, before putting it there, drain the gravy thoroughly from the meat, or the gravy will turn it sour; then cover well with clarified butter, and tie over it oil-skin, or oiled paper, to exclude the air. To clarify Blitter.—Put your boat into a saucepan of cold water, and set it over a slow fire until it melts; then take it off the fire, take off the scum, and again warm it gently. After being used it will still serve for basting or for meat-pie paste, and is also excellent for fish sauce. In collaring, be careful to roll the meat tightly and bind it firmly. Let it also be thoroughly done, left in a cool place, sometimes rubbed with pickle, but always wiped perfectly dry. TO POT LAMPREY. 479. —Lamprey is a species of eel only found in a few parts of England; and, being considered as a rarity, is almost invariably potted for the convenience of being for- warded to places at a distance. The mode adopted at Worcester, which is celebrated for its superior excellence, is as follows :—Leave the skin on, but remove the cartilage and a string on each side of it down the back. Wash and clean the fish very nicely in several waters, and wipe them. To a dozen of tolerable size use 2 oz. of white pepper, salt in proportion, 6 blades of mace, a dozen of cloves, all in fine powder, but do not season until the fish shall have drained all night. Lay them in a stone pot one by one, and curled round, the spices and salt being sprinkled in and about them. Clarify 2 lbs. of butter and £ lb. of the finest beef-suet, pour it on the fish, and lay thick paper over to keep in the steam. Bake 3 hours in a moderate oven. Look often at them, and373 Chap. XX.] POTTING AND COLLARING. (■MMMHMUMUHUUi as the oil works up take it clear off. They will thus, in the storepot, keep till the spring. Put into pots for serving as wanted ; observing to take off the old butter, and, having warmed the fish in the oven, cover with fresh butter only. TO POT SHELL-FISH. 480. —Boil lobsters, crayfish, and shrimps in salt and water, pick the meat out of the tails and claws, put them into a stew- pan with a little butter, some chopped mushrooms or truffles, and simmer a short time over a gentle fire. When nearly done, beat the yolks of 2 or 3 eggs with a teacupful of cream and a little chopped parsley; let all stew together for a few minutes, until rendered as consistent as paste, and set it as above stated. Or:—When boiled, take them out of their shells, and season them with salt, white pepper, and a very little mace and nutmeg; but use the spice very sparingly, only just suffi- cient to preserve the fish for a few days in a fresh state, as they will not keep good much longer. Press them into a pot, lay a little butter over them, and bake in a slow oven for 10 minutes. When cold, cover with clarified butter. Shrhnps may also be potted whole, by putting them for a few minutes in clarified butter, seasoned as above, and gently heated; then put into pots, and cover with more butter, to totally prevent the admission of air. Cover the pots also with oil-skin. TO POT POULTRY AND GAME. 481. — Chickens.—Take as much lean of boiled ham as you may think proper, and £ the quantity of fat, each cut as thin as possible; beat it very fine in a mortar with a little clarified butter, pounded mace, pepper, and salt—if the ham be not sufficiently impregnated. To this add the white part of the fowl, also pounded, but without seasoning, as it is only intended to qualify the savouriness of the ham. Then either mix the whole together, or put a layer of ham and chicken alternately ; press it hard in the pots, bake in a cool oven for i an hour, pour over it clarified butter to the thickness of a crown-piece, and paste over it a piece of paper, which may be oiled when the paste is dry. Let them be quite fresh, clean them carefully, and season them with salt and pepper; lay them close in a small deep pan ; for, the smaller the surface, and the closer thev are IMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XX. 374 packed, the less butter will be wanted. Cover them with butter, then with very thick paper, tie down and bake them. When cold, put them dry into pots that will hold 2 or 3 in each ; and pour butter over them, using' that which was baked as part. Observe that the butter should be pretty thick over them if they are to be kept. If pigeons were boned and then put in an oval form into the pot, they would lie closer and require less butter. They may be stuffed with a fine force- meat made with veal, bacon, &c. If a high flavour is ap- proved of, add mace, allspice, and a little cayenne, before baking. Partridges and Pheasants.—Clean them nicely, and sea- son with mace, allspice, white pepper, and salt, in fine pow- der, or seasoning spice. Rub every part well; then lay the breast downwards in a pan, and pack the birds as close as you possibly can. Put a good deal of butter on them ; then cover the pan with a coarse flour paste, and a paper over, tie it close, and bake. When cold, put the birds into pots, and cover them with butter. Or :—When baked and grown cold, cut them into proper pieces for helping; pack them close into a large potting-pan, and (if possible) leave no spaces to receive the butter. Cover them with butter, and. -i- part less will be wanted than when the birds are done whole. Hare.—Hang up a hare 4 or 5 days with the skin on; then case it, and cut it up as for eating ; put it in a pot, and season it with mace, pepper, and salt; put 1 lb. of butter upon it, tie it down, and bake it in a bread-oven till tender. When it comes out, pick it from the bones, and pound to a smooth consistence with the fat from the butter, and pot it in the usual way.3 Rabbits.—Cut up 2 or 3 young but full-grown ones, and take the leg-bones off at the thigh; pack them as closely as possible in a small pan, after seasoning them with pepper, mace, cayenne, salt, allspice, all in very fine powder. Make the top as smooth as you can. Keep out the liver and the carcases, but take off the meat above the neck. Rut a good deal of butter, and bake the whole gently. Keep it 2 days in the pan ; then shift it into small pots, adding butter. The livers also should be added, as they eat well. “ Mrs. Raffald’s ‘ Experienced English Housekeeper,’ p. 297.Chap. XX.] POTTING AND COLLARING. 375 Ham and veal may be potted in the same manner. Neat's Tongue.—Rub it with 1 oz. of saltpetre and 4 oz. of brown sugar; let it lie 2 days, then boil it until it is quite tender ; take off the skin and all the fibrous part of the root, cut it in thin pieces, and pound it with 1 lb. of clarified butter, and seasoning to your taste.a TO POT BEEF. 482.—Take 4 lbs. of the brisket, round, or rump of beef, free from skin or sinews of any kind. Rub it over with rather more than 4 oz. of sugar, common salt, and saltpetre, and leave it in that state for a couple of days, turning it over 3 or 4 times ; then put it into a stewpan placed in an oven, with a little chopped suet and about 4 pint of water. When suffi- ciently stewed, drain the fat and gravy from the meat, cut it up, and pound it in a mortar till it becomes perfectly smooth, adding to it some cayenne, white pepper, salt, and a little pounded mace, with about 4 lb. of clarified butter, to be gra- dually mixed with the meat while pounding. When reduced to this consistence, put it into pots, bake it, and cover it in the same manner as in other receipts. Or:—Put the same quantity of beef, prepared in like manner, into an earthen pot with a few blades of bruised mace, a marrow-bone, and a pint of water. Let the pot remain for the space of 34 hours in a hot oven, after which the beef and marrow should be pounded and reduced to a pulp, along with 4 lb. of anchovies which have been scaled and boned. Season as before, and pot in the same manner; the marrow a nd anchovy not only adding to the flavour of the meat, but tending to keep it longer in a moist state.b To pot Beef in imitation of Venison.—Put 8 or 10 lbs. of lean beef into a deep dish; pour over it a pint of red wine, and let it lie in it for 2 days, seasoning it well with mace, pepper, salt, and a clove of garlic ; then put it into a closely covered pot along with the wine, and another glassful if it be not sufficient, and bake it for 3 hours in a quick oven ; when cold, pound it to a paste, and pot it as above. a Mrs. liaffald’s ‘Experienced English Housekeeper,’ p. 296. b Hunter ‘On Modern Cookery,’ p. 94.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY.. [Chap. XX. 376 Venison may itself be potted in the same manner; but if it be stale, rub it previously with pyroligneous acid. HAM CAKE.—E. R. 483. —Take the remains of a ham that may be getting diy, pound it in a mortar very finely, with all the fat; season it with pepper and mixed spice ; add to it clarified butter sufficient to make it moist; put it into a mould, and place it in an oven for about an hour; it should be prepared the day before it is wanted: put the mould for a few minutes in warm water in order that it may turn out properly. This may be made with equal quantities of cold beef pounded separately, and placed in layers in the mould, or put together in lumps to look like marble. Tongue may also be substituted for the ham, but it must be mixed with a larger quantity of butter in the pound- ing. If not wanted at the time, it may be potted with veal, and covered with clarified butter. It will keep well in winter if properly seasoned. TO POT MUSHR 0 OMS. 484. —Choose large buttons, or those in which the inside is not yet the least brown ; peel and wipe out the fur of the larger ones; and to every 2 quarts put i dr. of pounded mace, 2 drs. of white pepper, and 6 or 8 cloves in powder: set them over the fire, shake, and let the liquor dry up into them. Then put to them 2 oz. of butter, and stew them in it till they are fit for eating; pour the butter from them, and let them become cold. Pack them close into a pot, making the surface as even as pos- sible ; add some butter lukewarm, and then lay a bit of white paper over them, and pour clarified suet upon it to exclude the air. The collaring of Meat and Fish is an excellent method of preparing it to be eaten cold, having the advantage of keeping for a long time, and being at all times ready for breakfast or luncheon. COLLARED EEL.—E. R. 485. —Cut off the head, then split and take out the bone, but do not skin the fish ; season them with mixed spices, some pars- ley and sweet marjoram shred very fine, and a few chopped sage-leaves; sprinkle a little dry isinglass over them; roll them tightly up in a cloth, bind it well with strong tape.377 Chap. XX.] POTTING AND COLLARING. Boil them in good gravy with a little vinegar, according to^ the quantity of eels collared, a few pepper-corns, a sprig of sweet marjoram, 2 or 3 onions, 4 bay-leaves, a blade or two of mace, and a dozen allspice. Boil until tender; take them up and retie them without taking out of the cloth, let them stand until cold, then glaze them. They may be sent whole to table, or cut in slices, and garnislied with jelly and bar- As a standing dish, and only eaten cold as a relish, it ought always to be highly seasoned. TO “ CAVEACH” FISH. 486.—Bone the tail of a cod, and cut it into slices, season them with white pepper and salt, then fry them, and when cold put them into a pickle made of vinegar boiled with pepper- corns, a few cloves, mace, and bay-leaves; add when cold a teacupful of sweet oil; lay the fish in a jar with slices of onion between each, and cover the whole with vinegar. Sal- mon may be pickled in the same manner. When served up at table put a sufficient number of pieces in the centre of a dish, ■ and raise round it a wall of salad. 487.—Make a pickle with 6 oz. of brown sugar, 4 oz. of common salt, and 1 oz. of saltpetre. Then take a flank of beef, s and leave it in the pickle for 10 days or a fortnight, turning it every day. When taken out, remove the bone and gristle, but leave on the outer skin ; lay it upon the table, with the skin downwards, and beat the inside well with a rolling-pin or wooden mallet until quite tender ; that done, score the flesh in rows, down and across, about the breadth of 2 fingers ; but in doing so take care not to cut the outside skin. Then fill the scores alternately with slices of the fat of bacon and corned pork, and sweet herbs of all sorts, chopped, and seasoned with spice, till you have filled them all; after which, roll the flank up very tightly, and bind it round with coarse broad tape, wrap it in a cloth, and boil it gently, but steadily, for 4 or 5 hours, according to the size of the joint. When quite cold, take it out of the cloth, unbind the tape, and fasten the roll with small skewers. If you wish to improve its appearance, you may also either glaze it, or rub it with yolk of egg, and brown it with a salamander. berries. TO COLLAR BEEF.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XX. Another mode is, to take either the flank or brisket, and prepare it, as above, for boiling; but stew it with a very little water, and, when done, cover the meat with a coating of chop- ped parsley, thyme, chives, or shalot, seasoned with a little cayenne; then put it under a board, and lay weights upon it for an hour or two, to press it close together; but before it becomes quite cold, remove the weights, and roll the piece up in the manner already directed. An economical ivay.—Take the best part of a shin of beef of which soup has been made (for it must be stewed until very tender), and an ox-tail, also well stewed ; cut them into small pieces, season them well, add a glass of wine and a glass of ketchup, and put it into a stewpan covered with a part of the liquor in which the ox-tail has been boiled ; stew it for about 20 minutes, and then put it into a mould. It must be very cold before it is turned out. This is a good way of employing the beef and heel when soup or jelly is made ; a few chopped sweet herbs may be added, and hard eggs cut into slices, or pickles, such as sliced cucumbers, intermingled. The flavour may be varied in many ways. TO COLLAR CALF’S HEAD. 488. —Scald the skin of a fine head, clean it nicely, and take out the brains. Boil it tender enough to remove the bones; then have ready a good quantity of chopped parsley, mace, ground nutmeg, salt, and white pepper, mixed well: season it high with these; lay the parsley in a thick layer, then a quan- tity of thick slices of fine ham, or a beautifully coloured tongue skinned, and then the yolks of 6 nice eggs stuck here and there about. Roll the head quite close, and tie it up as tight as you can. Boil it till the tape slackens, and then lay a weight upon it (without removing the bandage) till quite cold. Keep it in a pickle of the liquor, vinegar, and salt. A cloth must be put under the tape, as for other collars. Ox-cheek may be collared in the same way.

Lay it on the dresser, with a board and weight on it, till quite cold. Pigs’and calves’ feet boiled, and taken from the bones, may be put in or round it. The different colours laid in layers look well when cut; and you may put in yolks of eggs boiled, beet- root, grated ham, and chopped parsley, in different parts. When it is cold, take off the tape, and pour over it the liquor, which must be boiled up twice a-week, or it will not keep. BREAST OF MUTTON, 490. —Collared in this mode, will also be found very nice. Bone the meat, and rub it over with yolk of egg, over which grate some lemon-peel and nutmeg, with a little pepper and salt; then mince a large spoonful of capers with a couple of anchovies, shred a handful of parsley and a few sweet herbs, mixed with crumb of a French roll ; strew it over the mutton, and roll it up tight; boil it gently for 2 hours, and, when taken up, put it in the same kind of pickle as that for calf’s head. TO COLLAR A PIG.—E. R. 491. —Take a fine fat pig of a month or 5 weeks old, pre- pared for the table ; cut off the head and split the pig down the back, and bone it; chop a handful of sage very small, mix it with 2 nutmegs and 3 or 4 blades of mace beaten fine ; add to it a large handful of salt, and season the pig all over ; roll it hard, tie it with tape, sew it in a clean linen cloth, and boil it in water with a little oatmeal and a good seasoning of salt; boil till very tender, which will take several hours. Keep it in the cloth in which it was boiled until quite cold. Then take the cloth from the pig, and let it lie for 8 days in a marinade. s Eat it with mustard, sugar, and vinegar. To collar Pig's Head.—Scour the head and ears nicely; take off the hair and snout, and take out the eyes and the brains; lay it in water 1 night: then drain, salt it extremely well with common salt and saltpetre, and let it lie 5 days. Boil it enough to take out the bones; then lay it on a dresser, turn- ing the thick end of one side of the head towards the thin end of the other, to make the roll of equal size ; sprinkle it well with salt and white pepper, and roll it with the ears; and, ifMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY.

Put it into a cloth, bind with a broad tape, and boil it till quite tender; then put a good weight upon it, and do not take off the covering till cold. If you choose it to be more like brawn, salt it longer, let the proportion of saltpetre be greater, and put in also some pieces of lean pork; and then cover it with cow-heel to look like the horn. This may be kept either in or out of pickle of salt and water boiled, with vinegar; and is a very convenient thing to have in the house.

Chap. XXI.] 381 CHAPTER XXI. ITALIAN PASTES, RICE, EGGS, OMELETTES, CHEESE, PANCAKES, AND FRITTERS. . ITALIAN PASTES. 493.—Macaroni is coming much more into use in this country than formerly, and large quantities of it are now made I in London. The Italian is, however, of a superior quality, as the flour of which it is made comes from a peculiar species of 1 wheat, only grown in some parts of Italy, and much harder than the grain raised in England ; the consequence of which is, that the English macaroni when boiled acquires a floury taste, while the Italian, though quite as tender, is more crisp and firm on the palate, as well as more transparent in appearance, and should be always preferred, not only from what we have | already said, but from the better mode iff which it is there manufactured. The Geonese and Neapolitan are thought the best, but there are different opinions on the subject of their value; the Neapolitan being only Is., while the Genoese is Is. 4c?. per lb. The Genoese, being closer made than that of Naples, and appearing to be more delicate, bears the higher price; but the Neapolitan being more easily dressed, cooks generally prefer it, though not so essentially good as the former. Besides macaroni, there are vermicelli, semolina, a smaller sort called macaroncini, and various other pastes of the same nature, all made in Italy from the same kind of grain ; nothing, therefore, can be more simply nutritive, nor, when well boiled, more easy of digestion. There are also two sorts of macaroni —the pipe and the tape—the one hollow, and the other flat, but both made of the same material; the vermicelli being that most generally used in soup : each being severally used in various ways according to the following receipts:—MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Cuap. XXI. 382 MACARONI. 494. —Cooks are, in this country, very fond of boiling it in milk, and even of laying it in milk for an hour or two to swell and become tender, but boiling water is better. } lb. will be sufficient for half a dozen people, and will not require more than 20 to 25 minutes to become tender, if boiled in water, but a few minutes longer if boiled in broth. Half the quantity of Parmesan cheese should be finely grated and sprinkled over it in layers, to mix it thoroughly; a small plateful of grated macaroni is also put on the table for each person to add it at their pleasure. It should be served quite hot, as the least chill soddens it. In England it is usually eaten with mustard, and, if wished to be made very savoury, beef gravy may be used with a truffle stewed in it. As to using any other cheese with it than Parmesan, or perhaps Gruyere, or both, it is decidedly objectionable; we have tried it repeatedly with Cheshire and other English and Dutch sorts, but nothing but Parmesan will give it the true flavour. To brown Macaroni is the common practice of our English cooks; though, in fact, the browning, while giving a pretty appearance to the macaroni, not only hardens the top of the cheese into a crust, but gives a taste of rancidity, and we strongly recommend the old way of merely stewing, and put- ting it on the table just as it comes from the stewpan. If, however, appearance be preferred to flavour, it can be done with crumbs of bread, thus :— Wash the macaroni, then simmer it in a little broth, with a little pounded mace and salt. When quite tender, take it out of the liquor, lay it in a dish, grate-a good deal of cheese over, then cover that with bread grated fine. Warm some butter without oiling, and pour it from a boat through a little earthen colander all over the crumbs, then put the dish in a Dutch oven to brown the bread of a fine colour. NEAP OLITA N MA CAR ONI. 495. —Boil it quickly in water with some salt; when tender strain it off, drain it thoroughly, and put it into a stewpan with a few bits of butter, and grated Parmesan cheese, pepper, and salt. Toss it until the cheese is well mixed, and then put it into a dish, with the remainder, the larger portion, of theChap. XXI.] 383 ITALIAN PASTES. I — grated cheese on the top. It is not to be browned, and will be found delicious. Or ;—"When boiled put a layer at the bottom of the dish, seasoned with black pepper and salt, then a layer of Parmesan cheese. Make 2 or 3 layers, finish with the cheese on the top, then pour round a rich brown gravy. Or:—Boil the macaroni in weak veal-broth until it is soft, adding salt for seasoning. When tender drain it, and put it on a. dish, placing small bits of butter and grated cheese upon every layer. Put a larger quantity of grated cheese and butter on the top, and place the dish in a Dutch oven for i hour, but do not allow the cheese to become hard. COLD MACARONI, 496. —If already dressed, may be warmed in any kind of broth, letting it simmer gently upon a slow fire with the yolks C of 2 eggs to thicken; after which it should be put into the 0 oven in a mould covered with crumbs of bread : or, if un- dressed, it may be made by leaving it overnight in broth, and 1 then proceeding with it as above. MACARONI AU VIN. 497. —Take a French roll hot out of the oven, rasp it, pour .1 a pint of wine upon it, and cover it close up for ^ an hour, to let it imbibe the wine ; then have ready an ounce of macaroni, boiled until it is soft, and lay it upon a sieve to drain : after which put into it about the size of a walnut of butter, and as much thick cream as it will take. That done, scrape in as much Parmesan tossed into a pan with the macaroni until it becomes like a fine custard, and pour it hot upon the loaf; brown it with the salamander, and serve it up. MACARONI A L'lTALIENNE. 498. —Take \ lb. of macaroni, boil it in water till tender ; thicken ^ pint of milk with Hour and a small bit of butter ; add 2 table-poonfuls of cream, ? teaspoonful of mustard, a little white pepper, salt, and cayenne. Stir into this i lb. of grated cheese; boil all together a few minutes; add the macaroni; make all quite hot, and serve. This is the mode adopted at the best tables in Florence.384 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXI. TIMBALE BE MACAB.ONI.~E. B. 499.—Soften the macaroni by boiling it fast until it will cut easily without breaking, but do not let it be too soft; then cut it into pieces 4 inch long, and with great exactness, that all should be of the same size; butter a mould, stick the macaroni quite close together all over it, so as to look like a honeycomb ; then spread a thin layer of quenelle farce over the macaroni; fill up the mould with a mince of stewed ox palates cut into small pieces, and small button mushrooms, either pickled or fresh, moistened well with white sauce : close the mould, and boil it for f of an hour ; turn it out very carefully, and serve it with thick white sauce and mush- rooms. Aux Truffes.—Have 6 small moulds the shape of coffee-cups, and not much larger ; butter them, place at the small end a truffle; then encircle the truffle with macaroni, prepared and cut as in the foregoing receipt, sticking each piece regularly round till the whole of the mould is covered; fill it up with minced sweetbread and thick white sauce. These are very beautiful and excellent dishes, but require great care and attention : they are not, however, expensive ; and as any kind of fowl, game, or cold fricassee may be employed, cooks are recommended to practise the method of placing the macaroni round the interior of the mould, in order to obtain the neces- sary proficiency when the dish appears before company. It is equally good when not quite exact, but not so pleasing to the eye. A la Pontife.—-Boil lb. of the longest and straightest tape macaroni in boiling water, with a little salt and butter; when nearly done, strain and dry it; then butter a mould, and lay the macaroni quite evenly over it; if oval, the pieces at their full length ; if another shape, take care that the pieces shall meet and join; cover the macaroni with fine farce, then fill up the interior with larks boned, fillets of game, fowl, and small pieces of fat bacon, cut round, the size of a sixpence, small eggs made of the yolk pounded as for mock-turtle, and mushrooms or truffles ; moisten it with a rich sauce, cover it, and let it simmer, without boiling, for an hour.385 Ciiap.

R. 500. —-Stew some macaroni in butter and water) or broth, strain it, cut it into pieces, and lay it at the bottom of the dish, adding ham balls, made of ham pounded in a mortar, and blended with butter ; then have ready any kind of game, boned and filleted, cock’s-combs or ox-palates, previously blanched and stewed, sweetbread cut into dice, and mush- rooms, all stewed in good rich sauce ; place a layer upon the macaroni, then another layer of meat, and, until the pie is filled, add to it equal quantities of cream and gravy, cover it with a paste, and bake it, or omit the paste, and stew it before the fire in a Dutch oven. The macaroni may be mixed with grated Parmesan cheese. Another mode.—Swell 4 oz. of pipe macaroni in milk, with a large onion. Put a layer at the bottom of a pie-dish, -with some bits of butter and scraped Parmesan cheese sprinkled lightly over. Cover the whole with a well-seasoned beef- steak cut small and thin, then some more macaroni, and then another layer of beefsteak ; cover the whole with macaroni, pieces of butter, and grated cheese, instead of crust. Bake in a slow oven. VERMICELLI 501. —Is of the same substance as macaroni, but made much smaller, and frequently put into meat soups as giving them addi- tional richness; but in English kitchens it is too sparingly used. To be well made the soup should be thickened with it, and for that purpose it is preferable to macaroni. Semolina is of the same material, but made into small grains, which more easily thicken the soup into which it is mixed: it can also be made into an excellent pudding with eggs and milk, using it instead of flour, for which, and pud- dings of macaroni and vermicelli, see Chapter on Puddings. It should be observed, as a general rule, that in using any of the Italian pastes—unless they should be sweetened—Par- mesan cheese should always form part of the dish, in the pro- portion of one-half the quantity to that of the paste. POLENTA 502. —Is, in Ttaly, made from the flour of Indian corn, but in this country is generally made of semolina, thus:— 2 cMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXI. 386 Put a little salt and 4 oz. of semolina into a quart of milk when it is beginning to boil, and let it continue to sim- mer for about 10 minutes, stirring it occasionally to guard it from burning. When well thickened, pour it into a dish to cool, and when quite cold it will be very solid: then cut it into slices of less than an inch thick, upon which put a large grating of good Parmesan cheese, for no other kind will answer the purpose ; nor should any spices be used, except a little mace; nor even that, unless it be made (as sometimes done) with veal broth. Clarify a few ounces of fresh butter— though in Italy oil is always used—put a layer of the paste, powdered with the Parmesan, mixed with a little of the butter; bake it for h an hour in a moderately heated oven, and serve it up quite hot, with a separate plate of the grated cheese. RICE. 503.—There are but two sorts of rice in common use through- out the north of Europe, the Carolina and the Patna; the one imported from America, and the other from the East Indies. The former is the whitest, the largest in grain, and the highest in price; but in point of nutriment little better than the Patna. For curry or soup the Patna rice is the best. The boiling of rice requires 2 quarts of boiling water for each 1 lb. ; the rice should first be washed in salt and water, and must be allowed to simmer for 20 minutes, but not be touched with hand or spoon, though it may be occasionally stirred with a large wooden fork to keep every grain separate; it should then be drained through a colander and spread thinly to dry upon a napkin before the fire; or put on a dish and set in the oven for a fSw minutes. For savoury dishes rice should be stewed in good gravy, seasoned with mace, cayenne, and salt, with the addition of fried onions, shalot, garlic, and pot-herbs, strained and used at pleasure. • For sweet dishes.—Boil it with lemon-peel, cinnamon, or bay-leaves, and, when done to a proper consistency, add powdered sugar and cold butter, stirring it all the time till melted; then pour in a little cream, and use it either as a covering: for stewed fruits, or, if made thick enough, it mayChap. XXI.] EICE. 387 be placed round the sides of a dish, leaving the middle hollow for the sweets. The same plan may be adopted for all sorts of meat, poultry, fish, fruit, and sweetmeats. The sugar should not be added until the rice is done, as it has a tendency to harden the grains. Rice a la Portugaise.—In Portugal a very common mode of dressing rice is to stew it either in fowl broth or beef gravy, and boil it with tomatas, which give it a very pleasant acid. If in broth, only tomatas are used ; but if in gravy, onions are added well seasoned with salt and pepper, some- | times with a clove of garlic. RICE FRITTERS. 504. —Pare very thin the rind of a lemon, and boil it in .1 milk, with sugar enough to sweeten it, and a cup of rice. When the rice is quite soft, take out the lemon-peel; beat up I the rice with a glass of brandy, shape it into fritters, brush (j them with yolks of eggs, cover them with bread-crumbs, fry them in lard, dust them with fine sugar, and glaze with a salamander. Or :—Let the rice cool; spread it out 4 inch thick, cut it in rounds with a 14-inch cutter, make an opening and insert a piece of red-currant jelly, apple jelly, or a fine jam of any kind; then egg and crumb, carefully closing the aper- ture that admitted the jam; fry in hot lard and glaze with fine 1 sugar. Pancake.—Boil 4 lb. of rice to a jelly, in a small quantity of water : when cold, mix it with a pint of cream, 8 eggs, a bit of salt, and nutmeg ; stir in 8 oz. of butter just warmed, and add as much flour as will make the batter thick enough. Fry in as little lard or dripping as possible. Or:—Mix the yolks of 2 well-beaten eggs with a pint of cream, 2 oz. of sifted sugar, a little nutmeg, cinnamon, and mace, or a few drops of oil of almonds. Rub the pan with a bit of butter, and fry the pancakes thin. RICE BALLS. 505. —Pour upon 4 lb. of rice 3 pints of boiling milk, and boil it with a little cinnamon and lemon-peel until it is quite tender, then sweeten it; allow it to remain until it is cold, 2 c 2388 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXI. and make it into balls. Beat up 2 eggs, roll the balls in it, and afterwards in grated bread-crumbs; fry them in lard, drain them on a piece of paper, and serve them up covered with sifted sugar. CROQUETTES DE RIZ.—E. R. 506. —Clean and wash 6 oz. of rice, put it into a stewpan with cold water, and, after it has boiled for about a minute, strain it; then add twice the quantity of broth, and let it stew gently until the rice will break easily with a spoon. Should the liquor dry too much before the rice is soft enough, add a • little more broth. Then work it well with a spoonful of white sauce, 2 spoonfuls of grated Parmesan cheese, and a very little white pepper. When of a sufficient consistence, make the rice into shapes, which may be done by hollowing them in the hand to the form of a cup ; fill these shapes with any kind of mince, either of fowl, game, or sweetbread, well mixed with white- sauce ; close the end of the cups to contain the mince, rolling them into balls, then cover them well with Croquettes de Riz. tlie following mixture 2 spoonfuls of grated Par- mesan cheese, with 4 of bread-crumbs made to stick by rolling in the yolks of eggs : fry them in lard of a light brown colour. This dish requires great care and attention, but is excellent when done. CASSEROLE DE RIZ AUX (EUFS.—E. R. 507. —Clean, wash, and stew the rice, as in the former receipt; work it well with stock and an egg beaten, as the rice should be firm and well blended; then make it into a wall, lining the inside of a mould of the requisite height: bake the casserole. Take the white portion of cold fowl, cold veal, or sweetbreads ; mince them finely, add some thick white sauce and mushrooms, fill the casserole, and cover the top witli poached eggs ; cover them with glaze, and serve it up very hot.Chap. XXI.] EICE. 389 RICE CAUDLE. 508. —When the water boils pour into it some ground rice mixed with a little cold water ; when of a proper consistency, add sugar, lemon-peel, and cinnamon, and a glass of brandy to a quart. Boil all smooth. Or :—Soak some Carolina rice in water an hour, strain it, and put 2 spoonfuls of the rice into 11 pint of milk ; simmer till it will pulp through a sieve, then put the pulp and milk into the saucepan, with a bruised clove and a bit of white sugar. Simmer 10 minutes: if too thick, add a spoonful or two of milk, and serve with thin toast. RICE FL UMMER Y. 509. —Boil with a pint of new milk a bit of lemon-peel and cinnamon; mix with a little cold milk as much rice-flour as will make the whole of a good consistence ; sweeten, and add a spoonful of peach-water, or a bitter almond beaten ; boil it, but take care it does not burn; pour it into a shape or pint basin, taking out the spice. When cold, turn the flummery into a dish, and serve with cream, milk, or custard, round; or put a teacupful of cream into i pint of new milk, a glass of white wine, ^ a lemon squeezed, and sugar, and pour over it. Rice Paste.—Take ground rice and butter, work it like short crust, adding a little sugar to make it eat crisply, only using wheaten flour to roll it out with on the board; more or less butter must be added, according to the richness required. Or. if for relishing things:—Clean and put some rice, with an onion, and a little water and milk, or milk only, into a saucepan, and simmer till it swells. Put seasoned chops into a dish, and cover it with the rice; by the addition of an egg the rice will adhere better. EGGS. 510.—Eggs are in such general use that the celebrated ‘ Almanach des Gourmands ’ enumerates no less than 300 different modes of serving them in France; and although either our deficiency in culinary science, or our want of gas- tronomic taste, precludes the entire catalogue from being hereMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXI. 390 inserted, yet 'sufficient receipts will, we trust, be found to gratify the palate of most of our readers. There are of course several sorts of eggs, according to the species of poultry which produce them. The turkey egg is the largest and the most delicate, after which, in point of flavour, is the guinea-hen’s, and, in that of size, those of the goose and duck. Although all these are employed in cookery, yet the eggs of the common “ barn-door fowl” are those most generally used when served up separately and boiled in the shell, in which case the main point is their entire freshness. This can partly be judged of by putting them between you and the light, and seeing that the white is clear and the yolk un- clouded ; for although nothing can be more delicately nutri- tive when newly laid, few things can be more nauseous when they are stale. TO KEEP EGGS FOR WINTER USE. 511. —Pour a full gallon of boiling water on 2 quarts of quicklime and t lb. of salt; when cold, mix into it an ounce of cream of tartar. The day following put in the eggs. After the lime has been stirred well into the boiling water, a large part of it will settle at the bottom of the vessel, on which the eggs will remain. Keep them covered with the liquor, and they will keep for two years. TO ROIL EGGS. 512. —To effect the simple process of boiling demands con- stant attention, as 4 a minute more or less may spoil the egg for a fastidious palate. There are various modes employed by different cooks ; some putting them into cold water, and, when it boils, allowing the eggs to remain in it for a minute longer; others taking them out immediately; while other's, again, prefer putting them into boiling water, and there leaving them until done. That time is most commonly 3 minutes, and seldom less; but many persons object to their being left so soft, and 4 or 5 minutes are not unusual if the eggs are not “ new- laid.” Ten minutes are required for making the yolks hard enough for salad, after which the eggs should be put for some time into cold water to harden, or the yolks will not readily incorporate with the condiments. It should however be understood that, in whatever way theChap. XXL] EGGS. 391 egg is to be boiled, it should be completely covered with water ; that if put into the water while boiling, the shell is subject to being cracked ; and if boiled too suddenly, the white becomes hard, while the yolk remains comparatively soft. The cook should therefore be provided with minute glasses of various sizes—from 1 minute to 5—to mark the time; for they are more accurate than the hand of a kitchen clock, and do not require so much watching. TO POACH EGGS 513.—Is to boil them without their shells, and requires still greater care. The water must be perfectly pure, or it will stain the white of the egg, and the yolk must be only just so much done as to fix itself firmly in the centre of the white; the egg, though required to be quite fresh, yet should not be poached on the same day on which it has been laid, as, when in that milky state, the white and yolk will not com- bine with the necessary degree of firmness; they should be a couple of days old. Put a moderate quantity of water into a broad flat stewpan. French cooks add to it, when boiling, a spoonful of vinegar and a little salt. Take the pan off the fire whilst putting in the eggs; break the egg into a teacup or small ladle, and turn it gently into the water, so as to prevent the yolk from being mixed with the white; let them stand till beginning to set; then let the eggs boil gently until you perceive that they are done, by the white being set, and the yolk appearing through it in a comparatively soft state; then take each from the water with an egg-slice, and pare off any ragged edges which may appear around it, before sending to table. This latter operation, however, if not quickly done, cools the egg, which ought to be served quite hot, to avoid which incon- venience, a little machine for poaching has been invented in France. A tin cup large enough to contain the egg when poached is perforated with several holes; and being placed in the boiling water, the egg is broken into it, but, when taken up, retains its roundness without cutting. It has, however, the imperfection of not allowing the egg to slide from the cup to any substance on which it is to be placed. This, however, may be easily rectified by turning the egg over upon the toast, which, if carefully done, answers quite as well. The larger392 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXI. machine is made large enough to contain as many as 4 eggs. It is fixed upon trivets, and not deeper than a dripping-pan ; but each small machine being furnished with a handle, a single egg can be removed, and put on whatever the cook chooses. Poached eggs are commonly placed upon buttered toast, broiled ham, or boiled spinach; but in France they are not uncommonly served in a consomme of beef. Indeed, we have there seen them brought up singly, in tablespoons filled with the gravy, and each swallowed up at a mouthful! OMELETTE. 514,—In France, and indeed throughout the Continent, this is the most usual mode of dressing eggs, after that of boiling them in the shell, as being in small families a sure resource to fall back upon in cases of emergency. It is, however, extra- ordinary that, in England, scarcely any of the common cooks succeed in bringing them to table nicely dressed, though nothing can be more simple. In the ordinary way the eggs are made into a batter ; but if time be allowed, this should be done some hours before the omelet is wanted, and the batter again whisked up just before it is to be dressed. Four eggs will make a very pretty-sized omelet, but the number of eggs must of course depend on the size required. If sweet herbs be put in, a good deal of parsley should form part; tarragon gives a high flavour, and chives or shalots are not unfrequently used, but care should be taken that the flavour should not supersede that of the other ingredients. Omelets are judiciously varied by mixing grated ham or tongue with minced anchovies, when served at supper or as a side-dish at dinner ; but when intended for the breakfast-table, it is more delicate to make them of eggs alone. Although a common frying-pan may be used, yet one made on purpose, not larger than the size of a dessert-plate, should be employed, so as not to allow the omelet too much spread- ing, for it should always be kept of a certain degree of thick- ness to secure the softness of the inside. It is therefore only to be fried on one side, and when the under is browned and the upper brought to a moderate state of consistence, the fried side is to be folded over the other in three. Butter is better than either lard or dripping for the fryingEGGS. Chap. XXI.] 393 of an omelet. Any sort of pot-herbs is admissible; and many sorts of minced fowl and fish are prepared in that manner throughout the Continent. There are hundreds of receipts for omelets, but the principle is the same in all, the difference being- only in the flavouring. OMELETTE AU NA TUREL. 515.—Take 4 eggs, beat the yolks and whites together with a tablespoonful of milk, a little salt and pepper; put 2 oz. of butter into a frying-pan to boil, and let it remain until it begins to brown; pour the batter into it, and let it remain quiet for a minute; turn up the edges of the omelet gently from the bottom of the pan with a fork; shake it, to keep it from burning at the bottom, and fry it till of a bright brown. It will not take more than 5 minutes frying. Aux fines Herbes.—Beat up 4 eggs with a little cream, salt, pepper, chives, and parsley, minced very small. Put a piece of butter half the size of an egg into the frying-pan; let it begin to brown; pour in the omelet, and allow it to set a little; then raise it round the edge, to allow more of the mixture to become brown. When that is done, turn it over to double it; but as in browning the loiver side the upper will sometimes appear too soft, in that case make a slight use of the salamander, to give it firmness; put the dish on the frying-pan, and turn it over. Let the fire be clear, but not too hot. Or:—Take 4 eggs and 4 tablespoonfuls of milk, well beaten together; add one tablespoonful of parsley chopped very fine, a little lemon-thyme, marjoram, or tarragon, a teaspoonful of grated onion, a little essence of anchovies or Reading sauce, and a few grains of cayenne pepper; fry quickly, and fold it in three; put a little clear gravy in the dish. This is an excellent receipt. Aux Confitures.—Beat up 8 eggs with a tablespoonful of powdered sugar, a little nutmeg, a pinch of salt, some finely-chopped lemon-peel, and a wineglass of cream, or about i oz. of butter. Make an omelet-pan hot, put in a small piece of butter, and, when the eggs are thoroughly mixed, pour them into the pan; stir it about, and, when set, arrange the omelet neatly in the pan ; lay on 2 spoonfuls of jam, roll it up, and glaze it with sugar and the salamander. Any of394 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXI. the preserved fruits, when prepared as jam, will answer the purpose. Une Omelette aux Amandes is also looked upon as a deli- cacy, and made by substituting almond-flour, or pounded sweet almonds, for jam. Une Omelette d’Huilres may be made with 4 raw eggs, a little cream, beaten up either with or without sweet herbs and grated ham, but seasoned with a little salt, pepper, and nutmeg, together with a dozen of oysters bearded, dried, minced very small, and fried in butter. Omelette a la Tartare.—Steam 2 handfuls of sorrel, and, having picked and chopped it, stew it in gravy with a little butter and cayenne pepper; put it into a plain omelet, and cover the whole with grated bread, grated Parmesan cheese, and a little melted butter; make an edging all round with fried bread, and brown the top with a salamander. OMELETTE SOUFFLEE. 516.—Take 6 eggs, separate the whites from the yolks, add to the yolks a tablespoonful of arrowroot or potato-flour, 6 oz. of pounded loaf-sugar, some grated lemon-peel, and a small quantity of lemon-zest, or chopped peel, or orange-flower water. Beat the whole together for several minutes, until they are made into a batter, and then whip the whites until they become a froth; stir in lightly the batter. Have ready an omelet-pan of the proper size heated upon the stove; put into it f lb. of butter, and when it begins to boil put the whole into the pan, and stir it with a spoon carefully until it becomes partially firm. That done, turn it out upon a small circular dish, of silver or metal, as the omelet ought to acquire the form of a dome, and the dish be placed in a very moderately heated oven for at least 10 minutes or f of an hour, according to the care and nicety with which it has been made; after which it will have risen into a puff of considerable height, similar to the fashionable supper dish, “ trifle.” It should then be sprinkled with a little poAvdered sugar, the salamander held over it, and be served immediately, or it will soon be- come flat in flavour and appearance. Souffle Francaise.—Put into a stewpan 1 oz. of butter; when melted, add 2 tablespoonfuls of flour; stir them well over the fire, so that the flour be thoroughly cooked, but notChap.

The flavour of this souffle may be varied according to fancy, omitting the orange-flower water, and substituting either va- nilla, curacoa, noyeau, maraschino, chocolate, coffee, &c. CEUFS BIIOUTLLES. 517.—Break 4 or 6 eggs; beat them and put them into a saucepan with a piece of butter, a little salt, and a spoonful of sauce or gravy, which makes the eggs softer ; stir them over the fire until sufficiently thick; serve on a plate garnished with toasted bread. To eggs dressed this way, truffles, ham, mushrooms, &c., minced, may be added. The difference be- tween this and an omelet is, that an omelet is compact and turns out smooth, whereas ceufs brouilles are less done, and are therefore broken. In Ireland, where it is in general use, it is usually served upon hot buttered toast, and is there called “ buttered eggs.” It is also very common in France, where it is usually served for breakfast. Or:—Butter a dish well, sprinkle it with salt, then break the eggs very carefully so as not to disturb the yolk ; add a little more salt and some white pepper ; melt a small quantity of butter, pour it gently over, with 1 or 2 spoonfuls of cream. Put the dish over a slow fire, and finish the eggs by covering Ihem with a red-hot shovel. A very pretty dish of Eggs is made thus:—Break some eggs into a small tart-dish, without injuring the yolks, or laying one over the other. Drop on them some warm butter, and lightly strew crumbs of bread. Put it in the oven until the ■whites be set, and serve with a wreath of parsley round the edge. Eggs aux fines Herbcs.—Poach 4 eggs carefully, put them upon the dish, and pour over them the following sauce:—a glass of white wine, with some chopped parsley, chives, salt and pepper, and a piece of butter rolled in flour. Let all boilMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXI. 39G for 10 minutes ; pour it over the eggs ; cover the whole with bread-crumbs, dried and browned. Burnt buttered Eggs.—Burn the butter in a frying-pan ; break the eggs upon a dish, preserving them whole, as if intended to be poached; season them with salt and a little nutmeg; pour a part of the burnt butter boiling hot over the eggs, and then slide them over the rest of the butter; put them on a slow fire, and finish by browning them with a red- hot shovel or salamander. EGGS A LA DUCHESSE. 518. —Boil 2 quarts of milk with 2 laurel or bay leaves, some cinnamon, and green lemon-peel; when the milk is well- flavoured, strain into a shallow stewpan, and keep it boiling; whip up the whites of 3 eggs to a strong froth or snow, as it is technically called; take a tablespoonful, and drop into the boiling milk ; when all the eggs are in, turn them, and they are done ; take them up, drain them, and put into a deep dish; thicken some of the milk with arrowroot, and pour over the eggs. WHITE FRICASSEE OF EGGS.—E. R. 519. —Put 2 oz. of butter into a stewpan, and when melted add chopped parsley, a small piece of shalot chopped finely, and mushrooms also chopped, with pepper and salt. Stew till the seasoning is done, then add a cupful of cream; add sufficient flour to thicken the sauce, and boil it well. Boil 4 or 6 eggs hard, and cut them into slices—each egg should make 5 or 6; lay the eggs in, give it a boil, and serve up. A brown fricassee is made the same way, with good rich brown gravy instead of cream. EGG ALB.—E. R. 520. —Boil 6 eggs until very hard, remove the shells, and cut them across, preserving the whites in the form of cups; mince the yolks in small cubes with cold ham, parsley, and salt; mix the minced ingredients with cream until they form a thick paste, but do not break the little cubes; then fill the cups formed of the whites with this compound, heaped up in the middle, cutting off a piece from the round end to makeEGGS.

Or:—Boil the eggs hard, taking off the shells carefully; then cut them in halves lengthwise; take out the yolks; soak some bread-crumbs in milk, press it rather dry, add salt, pepper, and nutmeg, a little chopped parsley, and the yolks of the eggs rubbed into a lump of butter; mix these well together, and moisten with cream; fill the whites to make up the shape of an egg, strew them with bread-crumbs, and fry in butter to a light brown. Serve up quite hot. Or :—Boil eggs hard ; when cold cut the whites in halves, put the yolk entire into one half, cover it with forcemeat, lay the white upon its back and fry it; or pound the yolk and fotcemeat together until they form a paste, and fill up the cavity of the white; serve with either brown or white sauce. A la Carmelite.—Boil 6 eggs hard, cut them in halves the long way, take out the yolks and chop them very fine with parsley, sorrel, and boiled onions; season with pepper and salt; mix them up with a little melted butter, and fill the whites; heat them until thoroughly hot in white sauce made thus:—Take t pint of cream, seasoned with a blade of mace ; melt in it 2 oz. of butter; stir it very well, adding sufficient flour to keep the butter from oiling, and just before dishing squeeze in a little lemon-juice. A la Gruy'ere.—Put { lb. of Gruyere cheese into a stew- pan with a small piece of butter, some chives and parsley chopped fine, a very little grated nutmeg, some salt, and I- a teacupful of veal-stock; set it over a gentle fire, and stir it till the cheese is melted. Beat up 4 eggs, and set it over the fire again ; stir it till sufficiently done, then take it off, and garnish with sippets of toasted bread. CEUFS FAUCIS. 521.—Boil 6 eggs hard, remove the shells, but leave the eggs whole; cover them with a rich forcemeat made with scraped ham, pounded anchovy, pounded veal, and bacon fat, well pounded together and highly seasoned; brush them with the yolk of egg, and dredge them with bread-crumbs or vermicelli; fry them a pale gold colour, or put them for i of an hour in an oven, and serve them up with gravy in the dish.398 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXI. Ea Pures.—Boil 6 eggs hard; when cold take out the yolks and beat them in a mortar, with butter, salt, nutmeg, pepper, and minced parsley, adding 3 raw yolks; chop the whites very small, and put them into a stewpan with some good gravy ; do not let them boil, but shake them until they have a consistence; then place them round the dish they are to be served in. Take the yolks out of the mortar, and pass them through a colander into the same dish; garnish with bread dipped in yolks of eggs. Place the dish in an oven, and when lightly browned it will be done. (Eufs sur le plat is a German mode of frying an egg by means of a small cheese-plate, which, being thoroughly warmed, is greased in the indented part with a bit of butter or a very little sweet-oil, and into this part the egg is broken ffom the shell, thus retaining the exact rotundity of the plate, which is then placed upon the gridiron over a good fire. It may be slightly browned, if thought fit, with a salamander, but does not need it; and though quite as delicate, yet renders the egg rather more savoury than by poaching. EGGS AND VEGETABLES. 522.—Eggs and Spinach.—Poach half a dozen eggs, trim them nicely, and serve them upon stewed spinach. Eggs and Oniojis, or a la Tripe.—Skin 6 or 8 onions, mince them, put some butter into a stewpan and melt it, add about 2 spoonfuls of flour, mix both Avell together, then add the onions, and wet them with milk, cream, or water; let them stew, taking care that the onions and butter do not become brown; season with a little salt and white pepper; cut some hard eggs into slices, and when the sauce is ready put them in; make the whole very hot, and serve it up. Or:—Slice some onions very finely, pepper them well with cayenne pepper, and fry them in butter; take them out of the pan, drain them before the fire from the flit, put them on a dish, and squeeze lemon-juice over them sufficient to satu- rate and render them very acid. Fry or poach 6 eggs, trim them nicely, lay them upon the onions, and serve them very hot. (Eufs a la Frangaise.—A very common way of dressing eggs in France is to put a piece of butter in a stewpan with some green onions chopped fine, and a little minced parsley;399 CHEESE. Chap. XXI.] shake a little flour over them, and add a teacupful of good broth ; stir it over the fire till it becomes of a proper thickness, and skim it well; put in some eggs boiled hard and sliced, some salt, and a little cayenne; beat up the yolk of an egg I with a small teacupful of cream, add tins to the other ingre- dients with the juice of i a lemon, let all boil together a few J minutes, and serve hot with sippets of bread. Eggs and Asparagus.—Cut some of the thin green aspa- ragus to the size of small peas, boil them quickly, and drain them. Beat up some eggs with a little pepper and salt, and ] put them into the stewpan -with the asparagus; add a good piece of fresh butter, and keep stirring it as long as it is on the fire to prevent it from burning; when sufficiently thick take it off, spread a piece of thick toast in a dish, and pour over it the J asparagus and eggs. Eggs and Artichokes are also very nice as an entre at j dinner, or a corner dish at a supper-table. The bottoms, after being stripped of the leaves, to be boiled in hard water, and, when sufficiently done, place on each the half of a hard egg, jj leaving the round end uppermost. They may be eaten either cold or hot; if cold, covered with cream seasoned only with a little nutmeg; or, if hot, either with melted butter or rich I gravy. CHEESE. EGGS AND CHEESE 523. —Are mixed together in various ways by French cooks onder the names of fondus or fondeaux, ramequins, and other titles, for the purposes of preparing entremets, or side-dishes, for elegant tables. Gruyere and Parmesan are the most proper sorts to be thus used, but any dry cheese, of good flavour, may be employed. FONDEA U. 524. —Slice a stale penny roll; pour over it t pint of boiling- milk ; when soaked, beat it well, and mix with it 4 lb. each of Cheshire and double Gloucester cheese finely grated, with the yolks of 4 eggs well whisked. All this may be prepared whenMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap.

A VItalienne.—Mix pint of cream writh a little Hour and a little salt; keep stirring it over the fire until it is as thick as melted butter; then add about 4 lb. of Parmesan cheese finely grated. Mix it all well together until it is half cold ; then take 4 eggs, separate the yolks from the whites, put the former to the cheese, and beat it well together. Then beat the whites to a solid froth, and add them to the rest; pour the mixture into an ornamented mould or a deep dish lined with paper, cut in a fringe at the top, and only half filled, as it will rise very high. The oven must be very hot, in order to cause the rising, and the dish must be served immediately, or it will fall; to prevent which, let the cover be of metal, strongly heated: 20 minutes ought to bake it. ' Eu caisses.—Take t lb. of Swiss cheese, 2 oz. of Parme- san, and a piece of cream-cheese ; pound the whole in a mortar with a little pepper and salt, then mix in 4 or 5 eggs, one at a time ; fill 12 small paper cases, and put them for a short time in the oven to give a fine colour. Ten minutes will bake them in a Dutch oven placed before a good fire. Fondeaux of a small size may be made in either of the above modes, and put into little paper moulds of any fancied form, but only half filled. RAMEQUINS.—E.

Id Parisienne.—Toil pint of milk and half the quan- tity of cream ; melt 1 oz. of butter and a little salt; mix in a spoonful of flour, and stir it over the fire for 5 minutes ; pour in the milk and cream by degrees, and work it smooth, taking care that it is thoroughly cooked. Then take it off, and add i lb. of grated cheese, some coarse ground pepper, and an atom of nutmeg, with a very little powdered sugar, the yolks of 8 eggs, and the whites of 2, well beaten; when perfectly mixed, add the whites of 6 eggs beaten to a froth. I lie batter should be as thick as cream. Make little paper trays, fill401 CHEESE. Chap. XXL] them 3 parts full, and bake them in a very slow oven 18 minutes. Fried Ramequins.—Grate i lb. of cheese, and melt 2 oz. of butter; when the latter is getting cool, mix it with the cheese and the whites of 8 eggs well beaten. Lay buttered papers on a frying-pan, put slices of bread upon it, and lay the cheese on the top; set it on the fire for about 5 minutes, then take it off, and brown it with a salamander. Dutch Ramequin.—Scrape some old Cheshire cheese, pound it, with a lump of butter and the yolk of an egg boiled hard, in a marble mortar. When very well mixed, and quite smooth, spread it on slices of toasted bread and butter ; hold a salaman- der over them, and serve them quite hot. With Wine or Ale.—Scrape \ lb. of Cheshire and the same of Gloucester cheese; melt, without oiling, t lb. of butter; then beat all in a mortar with the yolks of 4 eggs, the inside of a French roll boiled in milk, and a wineglass of wine or ale. When thoroughly mixed, add the whites of the eggs, previ- I ously beaten to a froth. Put the composition into paper cases, I rather long than square, and bake them in a Dutch oven. STEWED CHEESE.—E.

Serve it hot 1 either browned or plain. The brown looks prettier, but the hi plain eats better. With Ale.—Cut the cheese into slices, pare off the rind, a and put it into a dish over a lain]) ; then pour on as much ale r] as will cover it, and let it stew until the cheese is dissolved, ij This is a Welsh method, and a very good one. The cheese ■ may be spread with mustard. A very delicious sort of paste may also be made of any of the q rich cheeses, Neufchutel, fromage de Brie, or Stilton, stewed If with cream and yolk of egg, either seasoned savourily or sweet- [*j ened ; and eaten hot or cold. WELSH RABBIT 527. —Should be made of the most mellow Gloucester cheese. 2 D402 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXI. Put it into a saucepan with about 1 oz. of butter and a very little ale ; stir it over the fire until the cheese is quite dissolved; then take it off, add an egg well beaten, dish it, and brown it before the fire. Rasp some toasting cheese with a bit of butter into a cheese- toaster, and, when the cheese dissolves before the fire, put it upon thin slices of buttered toast, of which the crust has been cut off. Serve it very hot, or the cheese will become tough; and eat it with pepper, salt, and mustard. Toast and Cheese.—You may also take some old Cheshire, with a lump of butter and the yolk of a hard-boiled egg; beat them into a paste, which spread upon slices of buttered toast, and hold a salamander over them until the paste is browned and melted. The paste may also be spread between thin slices of bread and butter, and eaten cold, as a sandwich. A Cheese Pudding.—Grate 3 oz. of cheese and 5 of bread; and having warmed 1 oz. of butter in £ pint of new milk, mix it with the above; add 2 well-beaten eggs and a little salt. Bake it i an hour. This is a nice way of finishing up a cheese when little but the rind is left. PANCAKES AND FRITTERS. 528.—Although egg forms the chief foundation of all pan- cakes, they are yet made in various ways according to different tastes and countries. Take 1 lb. of flour; mix it with 6 eggs, a tablespoonful of brandy, a good pinch of salt, 2 tablespoonfuls of orange-flower water, and the same quantity of milk and water, or as much as will give the batter a proper consistency ; melt a piece of butter or lard in a frying-pan, pour in as much batter as will cover the pan ; when brown on one side, with a knife loosen the edges of the pancake all round, and turn and brown it on the other side ; roll each pancake up, and send them to table very hot, powdered with sugar. Hand round sugar, either raw or pounded, together with lemon and Seville orange. Or, 1 lb. of flour, 1 quart of milk, 6 eggs, ^ oz. of salt, 4 oz. of pounded sugar, and peel of 1 lemon grated, withChap. XXI.] PANCAKES AND FRITTERS. 403 pounded sweet spice, or not, according to fancy; fry as usual, and serve each separately on a plate. The common sort are composed of a light batter, made of eggs, flour, and milk, fried in hot dripping or lard, only half the whites of the eggs being generally used; but salt, or nutmeg, and ginger, may be added, and sugar and lemon should l*e served to eat with them. Or, when eggs are scarce, make the batter with flour and small beer, ginger, &c.; or clean snow, with flour, and a very little milk, will serve as well as eggs. If the family be large, beat 8 yolks and 4 whites of eggs, strain them into a pint of cream, put a grated nutmeg, and sugar to your taste: set 3 oz. of fresh butter on the fire, stir it, and as it warms pour it to the cream, which should be warm when the eggs are put to it; then mix smooth almost 4 lb. of flour. Fry the pancakes very thin; the first with a bit of butter, but not the others. Serve several on one another, but at two or three different times, “ hot and hot.” A better sort may be made with 8 eggs to a pint of milk and 3 oz. of butter melted, and poured in with either a large glass of wine or brandy ; garnish with lemons. A still finer kind are fried without butter or lard, as thus :— Beat 6 fresh eggs extremely well; mix, when strained, with a pint of cream, 4 oz. of sugar, a glass of good French brandy, ^ nutmeg grated, the grated rind of a whole lemon, and as much flour as will make it almost as thick as ordinary pancake- batter, but not quite. ITeat the frying-pan tolerably hot, wipe it with a clean cloth; then pour in the batter to make thin pancakes. APPLE PANCAKES. 529. —Mix 2 large spoonfuls of flour in a cup of milk or wine ; when smooth add 8 eggs, some pounded cinnamon, grated lemon-peel, a handful of currants, and 6 or 8 apples peeled and chopped: mix it all well together; melt some butter in a frying-pan; when hot pour the whole mass in, and fry it on both sides: serve it strewed with pounded cinnamon and sugar very hot. NEW ENGLAND PANCAKES. 530. —Mix a pint of cream, 5 spoonfuls of fine flour, 7 yolks and 4 whites of eggs, and a very little salt; fry them very thin in fresh butter, and between each strew sugar and cinnamon. Send up 6 or 8 at once. 2 i> 2404 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXL Dutch Pancakes. Mux 1 lb. of flour with 4 lb. of sugar and a tablespoonful of cinnamon in powder; make it into a paste with 10 eggs and 2 glasses of white wine, or 1 each of wine and brandy; when well mixed, roll it out and fry like other pancakes. French Pancakes.—Three small spoonfuls of flour mixed with i pint of cream, the yolks of 6 eggs, and 1 oz. of butter broken into vei-y small pieces; the whites of the eggs to be whipped to a strong froth, well mixed with the other ingre- dients when ready to be fried. Very little butter is required to fry these pancakes; nor are they to be fried like the other sorts; but they must be turned one upon the other from the pan, sifting sugar over each as it is turned. They require but little time in doing, but must not be left for an instant till they are sent to table. A la Polonaise.—Mix up 8 eggs with pint of cream or flour and milk, and 2 oz. of melted fresh butter, seasoned with grated nutmeg, raspings of lemon-peel, and sugar, a little salt, and 10 oz. of flour. Put into the frying-pan a little butter or hog’s lard, as for the French pancakes ; and, when the batter is thrown in, sprinkle it with currants, and powder it with sugar when going to table; or you may spread them with jelly, marmalade, or sweetmeats, and serve them up in that fashion ; or rolled up, and put into the Dutch oven until nicely browned, in the manner of fritters.*1 TALIANI.—E. It. 531.—Take 3 eggs, a little salt, and as much flour as will make a stiff' paste; then break it into 2 pieces, and roll it out as thin as possible. Lay a clean cloth on the table, and with the hand spread out the paste as thin as a leaf. Let it remain on the cloth for 2 hours, then fold up the sheets and cut it into narrow strips. Have ready a saucepan of boiling water, put a little salt into it, then put in the taliani, and let it boil for 10 minutes, stirring the water about as it boils with a fork. Strain the water through a colander, and when the taliani is drained dry, put it into a dish with a sauce made of a little brown gravy and a lump of butter. From ‘ La Cuisiniere de la Campagne,’ Paris edit. 1845, p. 463.405 Chap. XXI.] PANCAKES AND FRITTERS. FRITTERS, 532.—Although a species of pancakes, are yet not so wholly composed of eggs, and may be made of almost any substance fried in butter." Make them of any of the batters directed for pancakes, by dropping a small quantity into the pan ; or beat 6 eggs very lightly and quickly in a quart of milk, adding gra- dually -f lb. of potato-flour. Have ready a large quantity of lard, and when boiling hot put in the batter, allowing for each fritter £ a large teacupful. They do not require turning, and will be done in a few minutes, but must be sent to table imme- diately, or they will become heavy: lj lb. of lard will be required for the above quantity of fritters ; they may be eaten plainly powdered with loaf sugar or sugar and cinnamon, and should be served on a folded napkin in the dish. Any sort of sweetmeat or ripe fruit may be made into fritters. For plain Fritters.—Grate the crumb of a penny loaf, put it into a pint of milk over the fire, and beat it very smooth ; when cold, add the yolks of 5 eggs, 3 oz. of sifted sugar, and 4 a nutmeg. Fry them in hog’s lard, and serve pudding-sauce in a boat. Apple Fritters.-—Take the yolks of 6 eggs, and the whites of 3 ; beat them well, and strain them; then add a pint of milk, a little salt, 4 a nutmeg grated, and a glass of brandy. Make it into thick batter with fine flour; slice the apples in rounds, cut out the core, dust them with fine sugar, and let them so remain for 2 hours; then dip each slice in batter, and fry them in plenty of boiling lard over a quick fire. They require lard sufficient to swim in. Glaze with sugar. Or :—Make a batter as thick as paste, of 1 tablespoonful of olive-oil, a little salt, the yolks of 4 eggs, a spoonful of orange-flower water, with as much flour as will thicken it; beat the whites of 2 eggs to snow, and slice it lightly in. This batter ought to be made an hour or two before it is used, that it may become lighter by fermentation. Put the fruit, well covered with this batter, into hot lard or butter, and fry. If the fritters are required to be unusually good, let the fruit marinate in brandy and sugar some hours before frying. Take the fritters out when of a fine light yellow, let them drain on a coarse cloth, sprinkle them with sugar, and serve quite hot. Creme Frite aux Amandes.—Boil 1 pint of milk with 2 bay-leaves, a little green lemon-peel, and a small piece of cin-406 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXI. namon. When the flavour is extracted, strain it; add 2 table- spoonfuls of arrowroot, and sugar to palate ; stir it well over the fire, and add the yolks of 4 eggs, 2 oz. of chopped almonds, and a wineglass of cream. Cook the whole over the fire for about 4 minutes, stirring it all the time; then pour it on a tin which has been well buttered, spread it about £ inch thick, put it into the oven for 10 minutes, let it get thoroughly cool, cut out with a round cutter, dip into fine bread-crumbs, then into egg beat up very thin, and again into crumbs; fry in hot lard; dust over with sugar, and send to table. Spanish Fritters.—Cut the crumb of a French roll into lengths, as thick as your finger, in what shape you will. Soak in some cream, nutmeg, sugar, pounded cinnamon, and an egg. When well soaked, fry of a nice brown, and serve with butter, wine, and sugar-sauce. French Fritters.—Mix 2 eggs, well beaten and strained, with as much new milk and flour as shall make 1 thick pan- cake, which fry as pale as you can. Pound it in a mortar quite smooth, and add the yolks of 4 and whites of 2 eggs, 1 large spoonful of orange-flower water or cinnamon-water, 1 oz. of blanched almonds beaten to a paste, 2 oz. of white sugar, and 1 of a small nutmeg. Pound it all till it become smooth batter. Have ready a large stewpan half full of fine lard quite hot, and drop the batter into it, the size of large nuts, until the surface be filled: as they brown, turn them: they will be very large: when done, remove them on clean paper, in a dish before the fire, and do the remainder. Serve as quickly as possibly. They are excellent. Italian Fritters.—Throughout Italy fritters are almost daily served at all good tables, and made of livers of fowls, sweet- bread, brains, and various articles, there called “frutti di mare” collected on the sea-shores from the tribes of small fish, muscles, crabs, and shell-fish, which there abound, and mixed together in different ways, fish, fowl, and fruit, all fried in oil or batter. Potato Fritters.—Boil 2 large potatoes, scrape them fine; beat 4 yolks and 3 whites of eggs, and add 1 large spoonful of cream, another of sweet wine, a squeeze of lemon, and a little nutmeg. Beat this batter % an hour at least. It will be ex- tremely light. Put a good quantity of fine lard in a stewpan, and drop a spoonful of the batter at a time into it. Fry them,Chap.

Lemon-peel and a spoonful of orange-flower water should be added to the batter. Or:—Boil 1 lb. of floury potatoes, bruise them in a mortar, and add to them 2 oz. of butter, with the yolks of a couple of eggs seasoned with a little pepper and salt. Mix all well together; roll it into balls the size of an egg, and fry them brown. Some persons like the addition of a finely minced shalot. Buckwheat Fritters, or “ Bookings.”—Mix 3 oz. of buck- wheat flour with a teacupful of warm milk and a spoonful of yeast; let it rise before the fire about an hour; then mix 4 eggs, well beaten, and as much milk as will make the batter the usual thickness for pancakes, and fry them in the same way. Curd Fritters.—Rub down in a mortar a quart of dried curd, with the yolks of 8 and whites of 4 well-beaten eggs, 2 oz. of sifted sugar, i a nutmeg, and 4 a spoonful of flour. Drop the batter into a frying-pan, with a little butter or fine lard. Orange and Sweetmeat Fritters.—Take off the rind of 2 oranges, removing all the white skin; then cut the oranges in slices across, and take out all the pips; dip the slices of orange in batter, as for apple fritters, and fry them. Serve with pow- dered sugar upon each fritter. Coloured Fritters.—Boil a large beet-root until it is tender ; beat it fine in a marble mortar. Add the yolks of 4 eggs, 2 spoonfuls of flour and 3 of cream, the juice and peel of ^ a lemon, i a nutmeg, and a glass of brandy. Mix all well together, and fry the fritters in butter. Garnish them with green sweetmeats, preserved apricots, or sprigs of myrtle. FISH AND MEAT FRITTERS.—E.

When sufficiently done, make it of a light brown by means of a salamander, or by holding it for a minute or two before the fire. Oyster Fritters.—Beard the oysters, dip them into a thick batter, made rich with egg, or, what is better, into an omelette, and then in crumbs of bread ; fry them: they are an excellent garnish for fried fish. BEIGNET. 534.—Mix and work well together £ lb. of flour and 2 oz. of butter, or 3 tablespoonfuls of sweet oil, and make it into a batter with some warm water; then mix into the batter a couple of raw eggs, keeping the yolk of 1 for browning. The materials may thus be made of any degree of consistence, so as to act as thick batter, or as thin paste by the addition of a little flour; and being made into small balls, are spread with the remaining yolk of egg, powdered usually with sugar, and fried in hot lard; and, when ready to be served, put them for a moment on a hair sieve, to drain off the fat. If made solely with paste, without mince of any kind, they should have another egg, and the batter be more continually beaten, so as to render the beignets light; then, when prepared for dressing, take a spoonful of the batter formed into a ball, and drop it into the boiling lard. A large dishful will be fried in 6 or 7 minutes.PASTE. Chap. XXII.] 409 CHAPTER XXII. PASTE —MEAT PIES —FISH PIES. VARIOUS SORTS OF PASTE. 53o.—In making paste for pies great care should be taken that the flour be well dried ; for the finer kinds of paste it ought also to be sifted. The very best salt butter is perhaps the best material for making paste. Some persons employ lard, or equal parts of lard and butter; and clarified dripping is an excellent substitute. An adept in pastry never leaves any part of it adhering to the board or dish used in making. The best thing to make it upon is a slab of marble or slate ; which substances cause less waste, being cold and smooth. The coolest part of the house, and of the day, should be chosen for the process ; the hands should be previously washed in very hot water, and the less they touch the paste the better and lighter it will prove ; nor should it be rolled much. In whatever way paste be made, wetting it much will render ■it tough. Salt butter of the best quality makes a fine flaky crust; for sweet things, wash it. In making pie-crust lard is, however, better than butter ; and in making the paste it is sometimes mixed with the flour in a dry state. Heating the oven properly is a very essential point in baking the various sorts of paste to be here enumerated. Raised pies must be put into a quick oven, or the crust will fall. The cook should accurately know the proper heat for each article, as opening the door to observe their progress lets in the air, and often spoils them. They require from ^ to a full hour more than when baked in a dish.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXII. 410 CRUST FOR RAISED PIES. 536.—Boil water with a little fine lard, and an equal quantity of fresh dripping, or of butter, but not much of either. While hot, mix this with as much flour as you will want, mak- ing the paste as stiff as you can to be smooth, which you will make it by good kneading and beating it with the rolling- pin. When quite smooth, put a lump into a cloth, or under a pan, to soak till nearly cold. In raising paste it should be brought to a firm consistence, and of sufficient thickness to hold the meat together; it should therefore not be too rich, and it is easier to be worked if moderately warm than cold. The proper way to raise the crust is by placing the left hand on the lump of paste, and with the right keep working it up the back of the hand, till all be of the proper shape and thickness. When worked into the desired form the meat is then put into the pie, and, when quite full, the lid is put on and fixed to the wall or side; the top being ornamented with some device, also made of paste. Before putting it in the oven glaze it all over with white of egg. Those who have not a good hand at raising crust may roll the paste of a proper thickness, and cut out the top and bottom of the pie, then a long piece for the sides then cement the bottom to the sides with egg, bringing the former rather farther out, and pinching both together: put egg between the edges of the paste to make it adhere at the sides. Fill the pie, put on the cover, and pinch it and the side crust together. The same mode of uniting the paste is to be ob- served if the sides are pressed into a tin form, in which the paste must be baked, after it shall be filled and covered :a the tin should be buttered, and carefully taken off when done enough; and as the form usually makes the sides of a lighter colour than is proper, the pie should be put into the oven again for i of an hour. For Venison Pasty or Perigord Pie. To J peck of fine flour use 2% lbs. of butter and 4 eggs: mix into paste with warm water, and work it smooth and to a good consist- ence.

XXII.] PASTE. 411 the dish; and let the cover be pretty thick, to bear the long continuance in the oven. For rich Pie-crust.—Weight an equal quantity of butter with as much fine flour as you judge necessary: mix, with a silver spoon, a little of the former with the latter, and wet it with as little water as will make it into a stiff paste. Roll it out, and put all the butter over it in slices, turn in the ends, and roll it thin ; do this twice, and handle it as little as pos- sible. The butter may be added at twice; and for those who are not accustomed to make paste it may be better to do so. It requires a quicker oven than for short crust. Lay a paper over to keep it from scorching. A less rich Paste.—Weigh 1 lb. of flour and l lb. of butter, rub them together, and mix into a paste with a little water and an egg well-beaten. Roll and fold it 3 or 4 times; or, omit the egg, and put 6 oz. of butter and a spoonful of white sugar ; work up the whole into a stiff paste with as little hot water as possible. PUFF PASTE. 537.'—To obtain this in perfection much will depend on the quality of the butter used, and on its being rolled out or turned a sufficient number of times, so that the butter may be mixed with the paste in minute layers. Salt butter will make as good, if not better paste than fresh. When salt butter is used, it should be broken into small pieces, and put into a pan or pail of clean cold water ; well work or squeeze it between the hands in the water, which will deprive it of the greatest portion of the salt it contains ; take it from the water and put it on a » cloth, and mould or work it well, in the same manner as you would a piece of paste ; when the water is all worked out, and the butter appears dry and firm, make it in a roll and put it in a cold place for use. Fresh butter should be moulded in the same manner as directed for salt, but it does not require being first put into water. In summer a few pieces of ice may be put into the water with the butter, in order to harden it. But in winter or severe frosty weather the butter should be well moulded, in order to make it mellow. Weigh 1 lb. of butter and 1 lb. of sifted flour. Take 2 oz. of the butter and rub in with the flour ; make a hole in the middle, in which put a teaspoonful of salt, and pour in suffi- cient cold water to make it into a paste of nearly the same412 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXII. consistence as the butter. This should be more particularly observed in summer, as the heat then causes the butter to become very soft during the rolling of the paste, and to break through the surface, unless the dough is made of considerably less consistence in the first place, in order to allow for this. To each pound allow 2 eggs, well-beaten and mixed with the water. Mix the dough into a clear, smooth paste, without tough- ness, by rubbing it well with the heel of the right hand on the board until it has acquired a clear, smooth, shining ap- pearance ; mould it into a round lump, then press all the moisture from the remainder of the butter, and form it into a ball, taking care not to soften it: put this upon the paste and press it down, then enclose it with the paste like an apple- dumpling ; flour the marble well and roll it out; this is called the “ first turn then fold it in three, and roll it out again, which will be a second turn; now fold it again in the same manner, and put it in a cold place, if convenient on ice,a covered with a damp cloth, until it is required to be rolled out for use, when the number of turns required to be given to it more will depend on the thinness it has been rolled each time ; thus, if it is rolled out to the greatest extent it will reach, 4 turns will be generally sufficient for it. If rolled out thicker than this, or about ^ inch or rather more in thickness, it will then require from 4£ to 6 turns, but not more than 6£ in any case. The half-turn is merely doubling the sheet or fold- ing it in two. Experience alone can determine when the paste has been sufficiently rolled. VERY LIGHT PASTE. 538.—Mix the flour and water together, roll the paste out, and lay bits of butter upon it. Then beat up the white of an egg, and brush it all over the paste before it is folded ; repeat this when rolling out, and adding the butter each time till the whole of the white of egg is used. It will make the paste very flaky. For Tarts and Cheesecakes.—Beat the white of an egg to a strong froth ; then mix it with as much water as will make “ If ice is not to be had, and the butter is soft, put it into a basin, and set the basin in a pan of water mixed with plenty of salt and saltpetre, and let it remain in a cool place for an hour before it is used.PASTE. 413 Chap. XXII.] t lb. of fine flour into a very stiff paste : roll it very thin, then lay the third part of i lb. of butter upon it in little bits; dredge it with some flour left out at first, and roll it up tight. Roll it out again, and put the same proportion of butter; and so proceed till all be worked up. For Orange Cheesecakes or Sweetmeats.—Dry 1 lb. of the finest flour, mix with it 3 oz. of refined sugar ; then work 4 lb. of butter with your hand till it comes to a froth ; put the flour into it by degrees, and work into it, well beaten and strained, the yolks of 3 and whites of 2 eggs. If too soft put some flour and sugar, to make it fit to roll. Line your pattypans, and fill. A little above 15 minutes will bake them. Against they come out, have ready some refined sugar beaten up with the white of an egg as thick as you can ; ice them all over, set them in the oven to harden, and serve cold. Use fresh butter. TRANSPARENT CRUST FOR TARTS. 539. —Beat an egg till it be quite thin ; have ready 12 oz. of the purest well-washed butter, without salt, melted without being oiled; and when cool mix the egg with it, and stir it into 1 lb. of fine flour well dried. Make the paste very thin ; line the pattypans as quickly as you can, and, when putting the tarts into the oven, brush them over with water, and sift sugar on them. If they are baked in a lightly heated oven, they will look beautiful. SHORT CRUST. 540. —Mix 2 oz. of white powdered sugar with 1 lb. of flour, and rub into it 3 oz. of butter so completely as not to allow any separate bits to be seen ; beat the yolks of 2 eggs into some cream, and make the whole into a smooth paste; roll it thin. Or:—Mix 2 oz. of powdered sugar with 1 lb. of flour ; add * lb. of butter rubbed into it very fine ; make it into a paste with cold water; roll it out and use it.

XXII. 414 of fine flour; mix it into a stiffish paste, with as little water as possible ; beat it well and roll it thin. Bake them all in a moderate oven. CROQUANT PASTE FOR COVERING PRESERVES. 541. —Dissolve a drachm of sugar in as much cold water as will make 4 oz. of flour into a paste : knead and beat it as smooth as possible. Roll it to the size of the croquant form, and about i inch thick. Rub the form with beef-suet, and lay it on the paste, and press it so closely as to cut the pattern completely through. Then lay it on a tin to bake. With a bunch of white feathers do over the paste with the white of an egg beaten, and sift fine sugar on it. Bake it in a slow oven, and gently remove the paste from the tin while yet warm, and lay it over the fruit it is to cover. The same cover will serve many times if kept in a dry place. v BRIOCHE PASTE.—E. R. 542. —This paste is essential in many of the finer kinds of cookery, and, though rather troublesome to make, will repay the pains bestowed, since, with a small addition of sauce, it will afford an excellent side-dish in itself, and it will enter into the composition of, and improve, all the more elaborate entries. Take 7 fresh eggs, 2 lbs. of flour dried and warmed at the fire, and 1 lb. of fresh butter. Take \ lb. of this flour, aud pour into the middle of it a dessertspoonful of yeast, which has been prepared by pouring water over it, stirring it, and allowing it to stand to settle, and then draining the water off. It is the sediment which must be employed. Pour a little warm water over the yeast, and mix the paste up with it, which forms the leaven ; flour the pan, lay the leaven in it before the fire to rise, and slit it on the top. As soon as the paste has risen proceed thus:—Make a hole in the middle of the remaining flour, put into it a little salt, about a saltspoonful, the same quantity of powdered sugar to take off any bitter taste in the yeast, and a little water to melt it; the butter broken into small pieces, and the eggs: work it all well together, and knead it thoroughly, spreading it out and work- ing it well: then spread it out entirely, and lay the yeast or leavened paste all over it, taking the greatest care in kneading and shifting the paste about to mix both well together. It will take some time, and must be thoroughly accomplished.MEAT PIES. Chap. XXII.] 415 When completed, flour a towel, wrap the paste up in it, and put it into a pan; if in cold weather in a warm situation, and if in hot weather in a cold one. It is best made a day before it is wanted. Very minute pieces, shaped in any way, add greatly to the excellence of soup, to be boiled with it, or stewed in the gravy of a vol-au-vent, and strewed over the top. It is cut into shapes also, and fried as the accompaniment of braised dishes of every kind. It is an exquisite case for lobster and other patties, or, brushed over with egg, may be fried in shapes for a side-dish : or it may be boiled in cups, 6 in a dish, and served up with asparagus cut small and heaped upon the top, and a white sauce round. In fact, a clever cook, by em- ploying different flavouring ingredients, either sweet or savoury, may make endless dishes of brioche. It should not, however, predominate ; and, therefore, it is best to make only a small quantity at a time, where the consumption of the family is not great. It will not keep long. The proper length of time for baking can only be learned by practice and attention on the part of the cook; much depending on the state of the oven, as well as the size of the article to be cooked : its appearance will, however, be generally found a pretty safe guide. MEAT PIES, PATTIES, &c. 543.—There are few articles of cookery more generally liked than relishing pies, if properly made; and they may be formed of a great variety of things. . Raised Pies may be made of any kind of flesh, fish, fruit, or poultry, if baked in a wall of paste instead of a baking-dish ; but they are generally eaten cold, and made so large and savoury as to remain a long time before being consumed, for which reason they also bear the name of “ standing pies.” In making them the cook should always take care to have a good stock that will jelly, made from the bones and trimmings, to fill up the pie when it comes from the oven, and also that when cold there may be enough jelly. For want of this precaution pies become dry before they can be eaten. The materials are of course frequently varied, but the mode of preparation is so nearly the same as not. to require the recital of more than a few prominent receipts.416 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. NXII. SEASONING FOR RAISED PIES. 544. —3 lbs. of salt dried and pounded, 3 oz. of white pepper, $ oz- of cayenne pepper, 2 oz. of cloves, 2 oz. of allspice, 1 oz. of basil, 1 oz. of marjoram, 1 oz. of thyme, 1 oz. of bay-leaf, 1 oz. of nutmeg, H oz. of mace. Pound the spices and herbs by themselves, and sift through a fine sieve ; then mix with the salt, and put away in a stop- pered bottle : 1 oz. is sufficient for 1 lb. of farce, and i oz. for 1 lb. of boned game. JELLY FOR MEAT OR RAISED PIES. 545. —Take a quart of veal gravy, dissolve 2 oz. of isinglass in a little of it; add the remainder with f pint of tarragon vinegar; boil all together for x of an hour. Clarify it with the whites of 6 eggs, then pass it through a bag. PA TE DE GIBIER A UX TR UFFES. 546. —Make a farce of 2 lbs. of lean meat, either rabbit, veal, or pork; 1 lb. of liver, either calf’s or game; i lb. of lean ham ; 3 lbs. of bacon fat; 4 oz. of seasoning spice. Cut up the above ingredients; put them in a stewpan with a shalot and a tablespoonful of chopped parsley ; let it heat gently on the fire, stirring occasionally; when the meat is tolerably done, turn the whole into a mortar, and pound it thoroughly; take it out, and mix with it li lb. of truffles chopped. Bone a hare and 4 partridges; season them in the propor- tion of i oz. of seasoning spice to each pound of meat; put a little of the farce in the partridges, together with a large French truffle (French are preferred to the English on account of their colour and flavour—the English answer the purpose, and are not more than -J-th the expense). Line a French pie-mould, as directed at “ Pastry,” being careful to make the join in the paste perfect; put a layer of thin bacon fat at the bottom, then a layer of the farce, and on that one of the hare; then the partridges, two breast upwards and the other two reversed ; fill up the pie with the remainder of the farce and hare ; shape the top nicely, put a slice of bacon fat over and two bay-leaves; cover with paste, and bake for 4 hours ; when nearly cold, fill in with the gravy drawn from the bones, and set with a little isinglass.MEAT PIES. Chap. XXII.] 417 PARTRIDGE PIE A LA FRANCHISE. 547. —“ Take 6 partridges, trussed as for boiled chickens, and season them well with the above seasoning. Take also 2 lbs. of veal and 1 lb. of fat bacon ; cut these into small bits, and put them into a stewpan with 4 lb. of butter, together with some shalots, parsley, and thyme, stewing them until quite tender. Strain and pound the meat in a mortar till made perfectly smooth. “ The pie-crust being raised, put in the partridges with the above-mentioned forcemeat over them, and over that lay some thin slices of bacon. Cover the pie with a thick lid, and be sure to close it well, to prevent any portion of the gravy from oozing out. “ This sized pie will require 3 hours’ baking, but care must be taken not to put it into the oven till the fierce heat be gone off.”a For Partridge-pie in the ordinary way lay a veal cutlet in the bottom of the dish; line the inside of the birds with fat bacon, season them well and place them with the breast down- wards ; fill the dish with good gravy, and add forcemeat-balls, with a few button mushrooms freshly gathered. Pies of this sort may be made nearly in the same manner of every species of game; but the mixture of the brown and white meats is not desirable, as the former have a peculiar flavour which ought to be maintained, and is weakened by the admixture of the latter: also hare and venison, though each forming admirable pasties separately, yet spoil each other when put together. CHICKEN PIE. 548. —Cut up 2 young fowls, season with white pepper, salt, a little mace, and nutmeg, all in the finest powder. Put the chicken, thin slices of ham or fresh gammon of bacon, force- meat, and hard eggs, by turns in layers. By the time it returns from the oven, have ready a gravy of knuckle of veal, or a bit of the scrag, with some shank-bones of mutton, or a calfs-foot, seasoned with herbs, onion, mace, and white pep- per ; and if it be made in a dish, put as much gravy as will fill it, but in a raised crust the gravy must be nicely strained, and then put in cold as jelly. To make the jelly clear, take * Dr. Hunter’s ‘Medical Commentary on Modern Cookery,’ p. 160. 2 E418 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIT. off the fat, whip up 2 whites of eggs, give it a boil, and then run it through a fine lawn sieve. Or:—Lay a fowl, or a few bones of the scrag of veal, seasoned, into a dish ; scald a large handful of picked parsley in milk, season it, and add it to the fowl or meat, with a tea- cupful of any sort of good broth or weak gravy. When it is baked, raise the crust and pour into the dish f pint of cream scalded, with a piece of butter the size of a walnut, and a bit of flour; stirring it round to mix with the gravy already in. It is very excellent when made with alternate layers of salt pork, or slices of pig’s-cheek. RABBIT PIE, 549. —Rabbits, if young and in flesh, are quite as deli- cate as chickens: their legs should be cut short, and the ribs must not be put in, but will help to make the gravy. Cut 2 rabbits and 1 lb. of pickled pork into small bits; lay them, when seasoned with pepper and salt, into a dish. Par- boil the livers, and beat them in a mortar, with their weight of fat bacon, some pepper, salt, mace, and sweet herbs, chopped fine. Make this into small balls, and distribute in the dish. Grate i a small nutmeg over, and add a pint of gravy. Cover with a tolerably thick crust, and bake it an hour in a quick but not violently heated oven. All pies made of white meats or fowls are improved by a layer of fine sausage-meat, made of pork, flavoured according to taste and the savouriness of the pie. HARE PIE. 550. —Season the hare after it is cut up, in the same manner as if to be jugged ; and bake it, with eggs, and forcemeat partly made of the liver, in a raised crust or dish. When it is to be served, raise the lid, and, if in a crust, cover it with jelly, but, if made in a dish, with warm gravy, mixed with a large glass- ful of port wine. TIPPERARY CURRY (an excellent Picnic Dish). 551. —Boil 4 chickens, and stuff 2 of them when cold with a forcemeat made of crumbs of bread, a few slices of ham or tongue, sweet herbs, and a shalot well pounded and mixed with the yolk of an egg. Stuff the other 2 with boiled rice,419 MEAT PIES. Chap. XXII.] lay them in a mould or dish, with 8 hard-boiled eggs cut in half, a few mushrooms, a little pickled lemon cut in thin rings. Pour over the chickens a gravy made as follows :—Fry an onion in a little butter, add a tablespoonful of curry-powder, 1 of vinegar, 1 of mushroom-ketchup, a little salt, and a little more than a pint of good veal broth; if the broth does not jelly, isinglass must be put into it to make it do so. When cold turn it out on a dish. It is a great improvement to bone the chickens, the bones helping to make the gravy. FRENCH PIE.—E. R. 552. —Make a raised crust upon a buttered tin, and brush it with yolk of egg; cover the bottom with forcemeat, then fill up the pie with sweetbread cut into small pieces, oysters, hard eggs, limbs of chicken, turkey, or rabbit, boned; arti- choke-bottoms in small pieces, asparagus-tops, forcemeat-balls, and mushrooms, taking care to lay them regularly, and to season the whole lightly and evenly: bake it in a moderate oven. When it is done pour in some strong gravy and cream thickened with flour and butter. Sausage-meat may be mixed with the forcemeat, and in winter truffles substituted for the vegetables; the seasoning should be of mace, cloves, and cayenne pepper. VEGETABLE PIE. 553. —Scald and blanch some broad beans ; cut young car- rots, turnips, artichoke-bottoms, mushrooms, onions, lettuces, parsley, celery, and add peas ; or use any of them you may have. Make them into a nice stew, with a little good veal gTavy ; season with pepper and salt; bake a crust over a dish, with a little lining round the edge. When baked, pour the stew into the dish, and lay the crust over it. Winter vege- tables may be used in the same way, and a cup of cream is a great improvement. COLD PIES. 545.—When meat pies are prepared to be eaten cold, suet should not be put into the forcemeat that is used with them. If the pie is made of meat that will take more dressing, to make it extremely tender, than the baking of the crust will allow, prepare it in the following way :—Take 3 lbs. of the veiny piece of beef that has fat and lean ; wash it, and season 2 e 2MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXII. 420 it with salt, pepper, mace, and allspice, in fine powder, rubbing them well in. Set it by the side of a slow fire, in a stewpot that will just hold it; put to it a piece of butter of about the weight of 2 oz., and cover it quite close ; let it just simmer in its own steam till it begins to shrink. When it is cold, add more seasoning, forcemeat, and eggs: if it is made in a dish, put some gravy to it before baking ; but if it is only in crust, do not put the gravy till after it is cold and in jelly. Force- meat may be put both under and over the meat, if preferred to balls. VEAL PIES.—E. JR. 555.—The best part of veal for this purpose is the breast; cut it into pieces and put it into a stewpan, with an onion, a head of celery, a bundle of sweet herbs, and a small quantity of water ; when warmed through add more water, and stew it gently until it is done. By this means 2 lbs. of veal will yield a quart of fine white stock, which will jelly: let it remain until cold, and then take off all the fat; take out the long bones, and all the skin, season it well, and pile it lightly in the pie-dish, having lined the sides with paste. Boil 4 or 6 eggs hard, and put them in : pound some ham or gammon of bacon in a mortar—bacon or ham in slices always being hard—make them up into small balls with a little butter, and add them ; add also some forcemeat balls; fill up the pie with the stock, which should be flavoured with a small quantity of ketchup, Chetney, or other sauce. Reserve a portion of the stock thus prepared, and pour it hot into the pie, when it comes from the oven, to supply the waste. This will be most excellent cold, as it will be per- fectly free from all greasy particles, and the meat tender, which will not be the case unless previously stewed. For Cold Veal Pie.—Take some of the fleshy part of a knuckle of veal, with an equal quantity of minced ham ; season it with salt, pepper, spices, and aromatic herbs chopped, and a small clove of garlic dr shalot; pound them in a mortar, adding eggs and an equal quantity of gravy. Cover the bottom of a pan with thin slices of bacon ; lay a little of this forcemeat upon it; lay some cutlets of veal over the force- meat, seasoning them with pepper and minced mushrooms: in this manner fill to the top, covering the whole with forcemeat. After baking for an hour, let it cool. Have paste prepared421 Chap. XXII.] MEAT PIES. about an inch in thickness; make it round upon buttered paper, sprinkling a little flour on the paste ; then take the meat from the pan, which should be plunged in hot water to detach it easily; place it in the paste, covering it at the top with a crust £ inch thick, and leaving a hole in the middle. Glaze, and put it into a very hot oven; let it bake 3 or 4 hours ; when sufficiently done, a wooden skewer will enter easily. Put in some clear gravy; fasten the hole at the top, and turn it upside down. This pie may be made of fowl, rabbit, or game, boned or put in whole, the birds being filled with forcemeat, mushrooms, either fresh or buttons pickled, or black truffles. Veal and Sweetbread Pie.—Cut the veal from the chump end of the loin ; season it well; clean and blanch a sweet- bread, cut it into pieces, and season it; lay both in the dish with the yolks of 6 hard-boiled eggs and a pint of oysters. Strain the oyster liquor, add to it a pint of good gravy; line the sides of the dish with a puff paste i inch thick, and cover it with a lid of the same. Bake it in a quick oven for li hour ; and when it is sent to table cut the lid into 8 or 10 pieces, and stick them round the sides, covering the meat with slices of lemon. Veal and Sausage Pie.—Cover a shallow dish with paste, lay a well-beaten veal-cutlet at the bottom, slightly seasoned; cover it with a Bologna sausage freed from the skin and cut into slices; then add another cutlet and a layer of the Bo- logna sausage ; cover the whole with paste, and put no water to it: the veal will give out sufficient gravy, while it will be ren- dered very savoury by the sausage. It is excellent eaten cold. Veal and Oyster Pie.—Make a seasoning of pepper, salt, and a small quantity of grated lemon-peel. Cut some veal- cutlets, and beat them until they are tender: spread over them a layer of pounded ham, and roll them round ; then cover them with oysters, and put another layer of the veal fillets, and oysters on the top. Make a gravy of the bones and trimmings, or with a lump of butter, onion, a little flour and water; stew the oyster liquor, and put to it, and fill up the dish, reserving a portion to put into the pie when it comes from the oven. Veal and Pork Pie.—Take equal quantities of veal and pork, boil 1 or 2 onions, and scald some leaves of sage; beatMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXII. 422 the meat well, and cover it with the sage and onions chopped together, with pepper and salt; fill up the pie with a little gravy, and bake it. EXCELLENT PORK PIES TO EAT COLD. 556. —Raise the crust according to the directions already given, into either a round or oval form, as you choose; have ready the trimmings and small bits of pork cut off when a hog is killed; and if these are not enough, take the meat off a blade-bone. Beat it well with a rolling-pin, c.ut it into dice, season with pepper and salt, and keep the fat and lean separate. Put it in layers, quite close up to the top; lay on the lid; cut the edge smooth round, and pinch it; bake in a slow soaking oven, as the meat is very solid. The pork may be put into a common dish, with a very plain crust, and be quite as good. Observe to put no bone or water into pork pie: the outside of the pieces will be hard, unless they are cut small and pressed close. Both these and veal and chicken pies are generally eaten cold, and, as they are always seasoned highly, will keep good for several days in the hottest weather. In the west of England it is not uncommon to take off the cover and fill the pie up, when cold, with clouted cream, which is a very deli- cious addition. CALF’S-HEAD OR CALF’S-FOOT PIE.—E. R. 557. —Either must be well stewed before being put into the pie. They must be cut into nice pieces, free from bone, and well seasoned, or otherwise they will be tasteless. If to be eaten hot, sausage-meat or fresh mushrooms or oysters will be an improvement, in addition to the ham, eggs, and force- meat balls; and if cold, the small pickled mushrooms should be added, or a little mushroom-powder in the gravy. The excellence of the pte will chiefly depend upon the seasoning and flavour, and the quantity of fine savoury jelly..wliich it will contain ; and therefore the meat should not be closely packed, in order to leave room for the jelly. Calf s-foot and Kidney Pie.—Take from a cold roasted loin of veal slices of the kidney fat, cover them witli pounded ham, and put them into a dish with the kidney cut into pieces, and the meat from a calf’s foot; put in a few hard-boiled eggs423 MEAT PIES. Chap. XXII.] and forcemeat balls, made very savoury with oysters, an anchovy, and the fat of bacon, as this pie should be eaten cold. Put the juice of 4 a lemon, or a spoonful of Harvey sauce, into the gravy. Sweetbread may be employed instead of kidney. BEEF-STEAK PIE. 558. —Take rump-steaks that have been well hung: beat them gently with a rolling-pin: season with pepper, salt, and a little shalot minced very fine; put the slices in layers with a good piece of fat and a sliced mutton kidney; fill the dish ; put some crust on the edge, and about an inch below it, and a cup of water or broth in the dish. Cover with rather a thick crust, and set in a moderate oven. Beef-steak and Oyster Pie.—Prepare the steaks as above, and put layers of them and of oysters. Stew the liquor and beards of the latter with a bit of lemon-peel, mace, and a tablespoonful of walnut ketchup. When the pie is baked, boil with the above 3 spoonfuls of cream and 1 oz. of butter rubbed in flour; to which, however, many people object as injuring the savouriness of the pie; in which case, should any addition be required, a few spoonfuls of beef gravy and port wine will answer the purpose. Strain it, and pour it into the dish : for a small pie a dozen of Milton oysters will be suffi- cient, and the pie may be baked in a couple of hours. MUTTON PIE.—E. R. 559. —Cut the mutton into small slices, without bone; season it very well, and stew it with the fat also cut in pieces, .putting in no water. When tender allow it to remain until cold; remove all the grease and fat very carefully; have some gravy made from the bones, add to it the strained gravy from the mutton, and a glass of port wine, but the wine may be omitted if the gravy be strong and highly seasoned. A minced shalot and button onions are good additions, and if the latter be pickled their acidity will be an improvement. Put it into a dish or into small pattypans, and bake it; if in pattypans use puff paste. Mutton pies are better hot than cold. The underdone part of a leg of mutton may be thus dressed ; but the loin and kidneys are better suited for the purpose. Lamb Pie.—Make it of the loin, neck, or breast; the424 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXII. breast of house-lamb is one of the most delicate things that can be eaten. It should be very lightly seasoned with pepper and salt, the bone taken out, but not the gristles; cover it with puff paste, and put in a small quantity of jelly gravy hot. SQUAB PIE 560. —Is a favourite dish throughout Devonshire and Corn- * wall, and is there generally made of mutton. It is made thus: Cut apples as for other pies, and lay them in rows with mutton chops and shred onion ; sprinkle with pepper and salt, and also some sugar. Bake the pie in a deep dish, cover it with a thick crust, and eat it hot; it must be well done, and will take 2 to 3 hours baking. In the midland counties it is usually made of beef cut into dice, with some lean bacon seasoned and mixed with the apples. POTATO PIE. 561. —Have a tin dish (as in the cut), take out the plate, lay pieces of meat at the bottom of the dish, seasoned with pepper and salt, and a little water. Re- place the plate, which is perfo- rated with holes, fill up the dish to the handles of the centre pillar with mashed potatoes; bake it; when put on table, lift up the plate of potatoes, which will have received all the flavour of the Potato-pie Dish. baked meat. VENISON PASTY. 562. —The neck, breast, and shoulder are the only parts of the deer used in this country for a pasty ; and even the neck is more generally roasted. A shoulder and breast, boned, make a good pasty ; but, the shoulder being sinewy, it will be of advantage to rub it well with sugar for 2 or 3 days ; and when used wipe it per- fectly clean. A mistake used to prevail that venison could not be baked too much ; but 3 or 4 hours in a slow oven will be sufficient to make it tender, and the flavour will be preserved. Cut the venison in pieces; put it into a stewpan with a little port wine, 2 shalots, an onion, bay-leaf, faggot of parsleyChap. XXII.] 425 MEAT PIES. and thyme, pepper, salt, and a little gravy. Cover it close and let it stew gently until tender; take out the meat, an pull out the bones; reduce the gravy, and when thoroughl cold remove the fat; then proceed to make the pasty. Line the sides of the dish with crust, but not the bottom; lay in the meat with fat between each piece, season with pepper and salt, put to it a pint of the gravy and a few bits of _ butter, cover with a good crust, and bake it thoroughly. Keep the remainder of the gravy till the pasty comes from the oven, put it by means of a funnel into the middle quite hot, and shake the dish to mix it well. The pasty must be Avell done, requiring generally 2 hours’ baking. A want of fat may be supplied by the fat of a loin of mutton steeped for 24 hours in port wine and garlic vinegar. To make a Pasty of Beef or Mutton to eat like Venison.— Bone a small rump or piece of sirloin of beef, or a fat loin of mutton, after hanging several days. Beat it very well with a rolling-pin; then rub 10 lbs. of meat with 4 oz. of sugar, and pour over it a glass of port, and the same of vinegar. Let it lie 5 days and nights; wash and wipe the meat very dry, and season it very high with pepper, Jamaica pepper, nutmeg, and salt. Lay it in the dish, and to 10 lbs. put •f lb. of butter ; spread it over the meat. Put a crust round the edges and cover with a thick one, or it will be overdone before the meat be soaked : it must be done in a slow oven. Set the bones in a pan in the oven, with no more water than will cover them, and 1 glass of port, a little pepper and salt, that you may have a little rich gravy to add to the pasty when drawn. YORKSHIRE GOOSE PIE.—E. R. 563 —Bone a goose, a fowl, and a pigeon; season them well with pepper, taking care to cover the whole of the inte- rior, or otherwise it will turn sour before it can be eaten ; put the pigeon into the fowl, and the fowl inside the goose, fillino- the interstices with various kinds of force and sausage meat and hard-boiled eggs. The liver and gizzard of the fowl and pigeon will assist in the forcemeat, which must be very well compounded ; sew up the goose, and put it into a thick crust. It will take several hours to bake. Make savoury jelly, which must also be well seasoned, pour it into the pie when it comesMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXII. 426 from the oven ; ornament the top, and let it be moveable, so that the pie may have a good appearance to the last, as the crust is not to be eaten. A calf’s-foot, boned and cut small, may be added, especially if used for the jelly. Green Goose Pie.—Bone 2 young green geese, of a good size; but first take away every plug, and singe them nicely. Wash them clean; and season them high with salt, pepper, mace, and allspice. Put one inside the other, and press them as close as you can, drawing the legs inwards. Put a good deal of butter over them, and bake them either with or without crust; if the latter, a cover to the dish must fit close to keep ih the steam. It will keep long. Gravy-jelly may be added when the pie is to be served. G1BLET PIE. 564. —After very nicely cleaning goose or duck giblets, steiv them with a small quantity of water or well-seasoned gravy, onion, black pepper, and a bunch of sweet herbs, till nearly done. Let them grow cold ; and if not enough to fill the dish, lay a steak of beef or veal, or 2 or 3 mutton steaks, at the bottom; it requires 2 sets of giblets to make a mode- rate sized pie. Add the gravy. A CHRISTMAS PIE. 565. —Bone a large goose and a fowl. Parboil a smoked tongue; peel it and cut off the root. Mix together a pow- dered nutmeg, i oz. of powdered mace, a teaspoonful of pepper, the same quantity of salt, and season the fowl and goose. Roll out the paste near an inch thick, and divide it into 3 pieces; cut out 2 of them in an oval form for the top and bottom ; and the other into a long straight piece for the sides or walls of the pie. Brush the paste all over with beaten white of egg, and set on the bottom the piece that is to form the wall, pinching the edges together, and cementing them with white of egg. The bottom piece must be large enough to turn up a little round the lower edge of the wall piece, to which it must be firmly joined all round. When you have the crust properly fixed, so as to be baked standing alone without a dish, put in first the goose, then the fowl, then the tongue. Fill up what space is left with pieces of the flesh of pigeons, or of partridges, quails, or any game that is conve- nient. There must be no bones in the pie. You may addChap. XXII.] 427 PATTIES. also some bits of ham, or some forcemeat balls. Cover the ingredients with i lb. of batter, and put on the top crust, which, of course, must be also of an oval form to correspond with the bottom. The lid must be placed not quite on the top edge of the wall, but H inch below it; close it very well, and ornament the sides and top with festoons and leaves cut out of paste; notch the edges handsomely, and put a paste flower in the centre; glaze the whole with beaten yolk of egg, and bind the pie all round with a double fold of white paper; bake it 4 hours. If the weather is cold, and the pie kept carefully covered up from the air, it will be good for 2 or 3 weeks, the standing crust assisting to preserve it. PIGEON PIE. 566. —Have a nice rump-steak, cut it in thin slices, cover the bottom of the dish with it, then put a little seasoning, parsley, and shalot over it; boil 2 eggs hard, chop the livers fine together with a little shalot and parsley; add a few bread- crumbs, pepper, salt, and a small lump of butter; work all up together, and fill the pigeons with it; put in the pigeons, then a little more seasoning, fill up the dish with steak, seasoning it as before; put in some water or gravy, cover with pufl- paste, cut some leaves and lay over, egg it, and bake it. PA TTIES. 567. —Roll out puff paste -j inch thick, and, with a 2-inch round cutter, cut as many pieces as are required for the dish. Take an inch cutter, dip it in hot water, and press it in the •middle of the paste about half through. Brush the pieces over with yolk of egg, bake in a quick oven, take out the piece marked with the inch cutter, remove the soft parts from the inside, fill them with a mince of any kind, dish them on a napkin, garnish with fried parsley. To make the tops, roll out the trimmings thin, cut some pieces with the inch cutter, egg them over, and bake them. Of Beef—Shred underdone dressed beef with a little fat, season with pepper, salt, and a little shalot or onion. Add gravy, i a glass of Madeira, and a few bread-crumbs. When hot, fill the patty-cases. Of Veal.—Mince some veal that is not quite done, put to it a little parsley, lemon-peel, nutmeg, and salt; a little creamMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXII. 428 and gravy just to moisten the meat; if you have any ham, it will be an improvement. Do not warm it till the patties are baked. Of Turkey.—Mince some of the white part; and with grated lemon, nutmeg, salt, a very little white pepper, cream, and a very little bit of butter warmed, fill the patties. A good Mince for Patties.—2 oz. of ham, 4 of chicken or veal, 1 egg boiled hard, 3 cloves, a blade of mace, pepper and salt, in fine powder. Just before you serve, warm the above with 4 spoonfuls of rich gravy, the same of cream, and 1 oz. of butter. Fill as usual. Of Oyster.—Take off the beards of the oysters, cut the other parts in small bits, put them in a small tosser with a grate of nutmeg, a little white pepper and salt, a morsel of lemon-peel cut very small, a little cream, and a small quantity of the oyster liquor. Simmer a few minutes before you fill. Or:—-Beard and chop the oysters, boil a little cream, with an onion and a small quantity of mace; chop fine the crust of a French roll, mix it with the oysters, add the cream; let it boil. Season with nutmeg, cayenne, and salt. Of Lobster.—Mince the fish in the same manner, mingling with it a little of the coral, and make with the same seasoning, a little cream, and the smallest bit of butter. Of Shrimps.—Pick a quart of shrimps; if they are very salt, season them with only mace and a clove or two. Mince 2 or 3 anchovies ; mix these with the spice, and then season the shrimps. Put a glass of sharp white wine. They do not take long baking. VOL-AU-VENT.—E. R. 568.'—Take puff paste, roll it about f inch thick, cut it round or oval according to the shape of the dish ; make the knife hot in water, so as not to drag the paste in cutting it; mark the cover an inch from the edge, brush it over with yolk of egg; bake it in a quick oven ; when done take off the top, clean out the soft paste, return it to the oven for a few minutes to dry; dish it on a napkin. Care must be taken in taking out the soft part not to break the outside. It may be filled with ragout of sweetbread, fricassee of chicken, quenelles, lobster, or oysters, but is never made of a large size.FISH PIES. 429 Chap. XXII.] Vol-au-vent of Croquettes—Moke croquettes of the size of a pigeon’s egg, of veal and ham and of calves’ brains, an equal quantity of each, fry them of the palest gold colour, make a rich white-sauce, and put into it the very smallest mushrooms or minced truffles; give it an acid flavour with lemon or lemon-pickle, and put it into the vol-au-vent when it is to be sent to table. Vol-au-vent of Veal.—Cut veal into thin pieces the size of half-a-crown, beat them, and fry them a pale brown ; make some forcemeat and egg-balls, fry the former, put the whole into a rich brown gravy, fill the vol-au-vent, and serve it up hot. Vol-au-vent of Pigeons and Sweetbreads.-—Cut otf the pinions, legs, and backs of 3 or 4 pigeons, and bone the breast, making it as large as possible: cut 3 or 4 pieces of blanched sweetbread the same size, put them together, securing them with tape, and put them into a stewpan with a piece of butter, the trimmings, an onion, a bunch of sweet herbs, a slice of fat bacon, and a small teacupful of water. Let them stew till quite tender ; remove the tape, strain and thicken the gravy, and put them into the paste when it comes from the oven. FISH PIES. CODFISH PIE. 569.—Take dressed codfish and cold oyster-sauce; put a little of the sauce at the bottom of a pie-dish, then a layer of _ flakes of codfish, with a little of the liver cut in small pieces, season with black pepper and salt, and a very little nutmeg; repeat the layers until the dish is full, cover it with bread- crumbs and bits of fresh butter; bake for f of an hour, and let the top be quite brown. A couple of sounds well soaked, boiled tender, and cut in small pieces, are a great improvement. Or:—Take a piece of the middle of a small codfish, and salt it well one night; next day wash it, cut it in slices, season with pepper, salt, and a very little nutmeg, mixed ; place it in a dish, and put some butter on it, with a little good broth of any kind. Cover it with a crust; and when done, raise it, add a dozen of oysters, l pint of cream, a little flour and butter, a grate of lemon and nutmeg, and give it 1 boil. Bake it a full hour.430 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXII. AN INCOMPARABLE LING PIE. 570. —Wash and soak the salt out of a piece of the thin part; boil it slowly; remove the skin, and put layers of the fish and hard egg sliced; add chopped parsley, with 2 oz. of butter in bits among it, till the dish is nearly full. Put in a seasoning made of a large teacupful of gravy, with pounded mace and white pepper. Lay over it a good puff-paste ; and when that is sufficiently baked, put in a cup of hot cream. EEL PIE. 571. —Cut the eels in lengths of 2 or 3 inches, after skinning them ; season with pepper and salt, and place in the dish, with some bits of butter and a little water; and cover it with paste. Middle-sized eels do best. They should be slightly seasoned, and the bottom of the pie-dish covered with a rump-steak, divided into small pieces, but not put in layers along with the fish, as many persons prefer eating the eels alone. The steak will produce abundance of gravy, to which oidy a little soy or ketchup should be added. A remarkably fine Fish Pie.—Boil 2 lbs. of small eels; having cut the fins quite close, pick the flesh off, and throw the bones into the liquor with a little mace, pepper, salt, and slice of onion ; boil till quite rich, and strain it. Make force- meat of the flesh, an anchovy, parsley, lemon-peel, salt, pepper, and crumbs, and 4 oz. of butter warmed, and lay it at the bottom of the dish. Take the flesh of soles, small cod, or dressed turbot, and lay them on the forcemeat, having rubbed it with salt and pepper; pour the gravy over, and bake. SOLE PIE. 572. —Split some soles from the bone, and cut the fins close; season with a mixture of salt, pepper, a little nutmeg, and pounded mace, and put them in layers with oysters; they eat excellently. A pair of middling-sized ones will do, and 2 to 3 dozen of oysters. Put in the dish the oyster-liquor, 2 or 3 spoonfuls of broth, and some butter; or, omit the broth, and make a strong fish gravy. When the pie comes home, pour in a cupful of thick cream, or milk boiled up with a tea- spoonful of flour; if there be sauce enough in the pie, leave out the cream. Pike, perch, and carp may be each made into savoury pies,Chap. XXII.] FISH PIES. 431 if cut into fillets, seasoned, and baked in puff-paste; but will be much improved by the addition of an eel to increase the richness of the dish, and even by a few gudgeons, mingled with the fillets. Sauce may be made of the bones, if meat be not allowed ; but if veal broth be used, then cream should be added. PILCHARD AND LEEK PIE. 573. —Clean and skin the white part of some large leeks; scald in milk and water, and put them in layers into a dish, and between the layers 2 or 3 salted pilchards which have been soaked for some hours the day before; cover the whole with a good plain crust. When the pie is taken out of the oven, lift up the side-crust with a knife, and empty out all the liquor ; then pour in 4 pint of scalded cream. This is a Devonshire dish; and may be made, in the same way, of herrings, or any sort of fish, with or without cream. LOBSTER PIE. 574. —Boil 2 lobsters, or 3 if small; take out the tails, cut them in 2, take out the gut, cut each in 4 pieces, and lay in a small dish; then put in the meat of the claws, and that you have picked out of the body; pick out the furry parts from the latter, and take out the lady; beat the spawn in a mortar, set the shells on to stew with some water, 2 or 3 spoonfuls of vinegar, pepper, salt, and some pounded mace; a large piece of butter, rolled in flour, must be added, when the goodness of the shells is obtained; give a boil or two, and pour into the dish strained; strew some crumbs, and put a paste over all; take slowly, but only till the paste be done. OYSTER PIE. 575. —As you open the oysters separate them from the liquor, which strain ; parboil them after taking ofl' the beards. Par- boil sweetbreads, and, cutting them in slices, lay them and the oysters in layers; season very lightly with salt, pepper, and mace; then put i a teacupful of liquor, and the same of veal gravy. Bake in a slow oven ; and before you serve, put a tea- cupful of cream, a little more oyster-liquor, and a cup of white gravy, all warmed, but not boiled.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIII. 432 CHAPTER XXIII. FRUIT PIES, PUFFS, PUDDINGS, &c. 576.—All pies made either with summer fruit or with winter preserves will be improved by a mixture of apples, pared and sliced. Apples will this way eke out the remains of a pot of jam with advantage. They are especially good with fresh cherries, cui’rants, &c., and will be found an agreeable addi- tion to cranberries. Equal portions also of cranberries and any very sweet jam will improve both. When apples are mixed with jam, they should be sliced thin ; and if syrup be wanted, a few slices boiled with a little of the jam in sugar and water. In making pies of green gooseberries, apples, or rhubarb, the sugar should be clarified—that is, boiled in a little water, but no water poured into the pie, as it destroys the flavour of the fruit. For fresh fruits short crust is very suitable. Fresh Fruit Pies, of all descriptions, whether cherry, green gooseberry, damson, currant, or raspberry, may be all made in nearly the same manner, taking care that the fruit be fresh- gathered and cleanly picked ; also observing that, if the goose- berries be very sour, they should be put for | of an hour in boiling water, i lb. of sugar is usually allowed to every lb. of fruit.a When pies have been kept until cold the crust becomes a In making pies of a very juicy fruit, it is a common practice to put a teacup into the dish to collect the liquor, and thus prevent it from over- flowing the edges. This not only has a vulgar appearance, but is actuated by a false principle, as when the cup is first put into the dish it is ftill of cold air, and when the pie is placed in the oven, the heat will cause the air to expand and fill the cup, and will drive out all the juice and a portion of the present air it contains, in which state it will remain till removed from the oven, when the air in the cup will condense and occupy a very small space, leaving the remainder to be filled with juice, but this does not take place till the danger of the juice boiling over is past.433 FRUIT PIES. Chap. XXIII.] heavy and indigestible; when next used they should there- fore be put before the fire to warm the crust and lighten it. Strew pounded loaf-sugar over the crust, or ice it with the white of an egg whipped up to a froth and laid over it. APPLE PIE. 577.—Pare, core, and quarter the apples; boil the cores and parings in sugar and water ; strain off the liquor, adding more sugar; grate the rind of a lemon over the apples, and squeeze the juice into the syrup ; mix half a dozen cloves with the fruit, put in a piece of butter the size of a walnut, and add or omit a glass of wine ; cover with puff-paste. Codling Tart.—Scald the fruit; when ready, take off the thin skin, and lay them whole in a dish ; put a little of the water that the apples were boiled in at bottom, strew them over with powdered lump sugar; when cold, put a paste round the edges and over. When the tart is baked, smear the crust with white of egg, and sift over it some powdered sugar. Serve with custard. Or;—Line the bottom of a shallow dish with paste; lay the apples in it, sweeten, and lay little twists of paste over in bars. Pippin Tarts.—Pare thin 2 Seville or China oranges, boil the peel tender, and shred it fine; pare and core a dozen of good-sized apples, and put them in a stewpan, with as little water as possible; when half done, add i lb. of sugar, the orange-peel, and juice ; boil till pretty thick. When cold, put it into a shallow dish, or pattypans lined with paste, to turn out, and be eaten cold. . The mode of making the New-fashioned Apple-pie is to pare and quarter the apples, scald them, beat them with a spoon with some of the liquor, add grated lemon-peel, the juice of a lemon or Seville orange, or a part of a quince, when they are to be got, cloves, white sugar finely pounded, and a piece of butter; put a paste round the dish, and cover it with bars or flowers of paste—the excellence of the pie consisting of the sort of apple and the goodness of the paste; the fruit should be raised in the middle, as it shrinks in the bakina:. Stewed Apples.—Slice 2 or 3 good-sized peeled apples in thick slices, then put them into a small stewpan, with a few cloves and some parings of lemon or orange, and let it stew 2 F434 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIII. for about l of an hour in a couple of glasses of white wine. It may be done while the family are at dinner, and the apples eat better than in a pie. They should be thrown into cold water when sliced, to prevent their becoming dry and dis- coloured. The apples may be also mixed with pears or plums, and will be found excellent. RHUBARB PIE OR TART. 578. —Take the stalks from the leaves, and peel off the thin skin ; cut them into pieces about an inch long, and as you do so sprinkle a little fine sugar into the basin. For a quart basin, heaped, take 1 lb. of common lump-sugar; boil it in nearly i pint of water to a thin syrup; when skimmed, put the rhubarb into it, and as it simmers shake the pan often over the fire. It will turn yellow at first, but keep it very gently doing until it greens, and then take it off. When cold lay it in the tart-dish, with only as much syrup as will make it very moist. Put a light crust over it, and when that is baked the tart will be done enough; quarter the crust, and fill the dish with custard or cream. Many persons think the flavour of the rhubarb injured by taking off the peel. TARTLETS 579. —Are always so called when made of a small size and uncovered with a crust; nor should preserved fruit of any kind be put under crust. The paste is made stiff enough to support the contents, being cut thin, put into pattypans, and crimped at the edges. The fruit is then frequently ornamented with small strips of paste laid over it crosswise, which are made thus:—Mix i lb. of flour, 1 oz. of fresh butter, and a little cold water ; rub it well between the board and your hand till it begins to string; cut it into small pieces, roll it out, and draw it into fine strings ; then lay them in any way you please across your tartlets, and bake immediately. The jam of raspberries, currants, or any other fruits, as well as the marmalade of apricot, quince, and apple, may be made into tartlets; and when baked in a quick oven may be filled up with raw custard or whipped cream. Orange Tartlets.—Squeeze, pulp, and boil tender 2 Seville oranges ; weigh twice their weight of sugar ; beat both together to a paste; then add the juice and pulp of the fruit, and theChap. XXIII.] TARTLETS. 435 size of a walnut of fresh butter, and beat all together. Choose a very shallow dish or small pattypans, line it with a light puff crust, and lay the paste of orange in it. You may ice it. Lemon Tartlets.-—Pare, rather thick, the rinds of 4 lemons, which boil tender in 2 waters, and beat fine ; add to it 4 oz. of blanched almonds cut thin, 4 oz. of lump-sugar, the juice of the lemons, and a little grated peel; simmer to a syrup ; when cold, turn it into a shallow tin tart-dish lined with a rich thin puff-paste, and lay bars of paste over; as soon as the paste is baked, take it out. Or:—Take the juice of 2 lemons and the rinds grated; clean the grater with bread, only using sufficient crumbs to take off all the lemon-peel; beat all together with 2 eggs, 4 lb. of loaf-sugar, and i lb. of butter. This is sufficient to make 12 tartlets, and will be found very excellent. Green Apricot Tartlets.—When the wall-fruit trees are thinned, take the thinnings before the stone is formed; stew them gently in sugar and water. When tender, reduce and thicken the syrup, and put it with the fruit into pattypans; or, if covered with a paste, it is then called a pie. This also applies to grapes. Prune Tart.—Give prunes a scald, take out the stones and break them; put the kernels into a little cranberry-juice, with the prunes and sugar: simmer, and when cold make a tart of the sweetmeat. It must be almost needless to say that tartlets of damsons, plums, and most sorts of stone-fruit, may be made in the same manner. Tartlets a la Paganini.—Beat up the whites of 3 eggs to a froth, and then add 5 oz. of pounded sugar; beat it well up, and have your pattypans ready covered with paste, upon which put any quantity you please of jam or marmalade; bake them for about i an hour, and when done fill them with the whip. This quantity will fill 16 pattypans of a small size. TO PREPARE CRANBERRIES FOR TARTS. 580.—Simmer them in moist sugar, without breaking, 20 minutes ; and let them become cold before being used. A pint will require nearly 3 oz. of sugar. The Russian and American sorts are larger and better flavoured than those of this country. 2 f 2436 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIII. The juice, when expressed from the baked fruit, and sweet- ened, makes a fine drink in fevers. Stewed with sugar, they eat excellently with bread. The observation concerning “fever-drink” applies equally to the expressed juice of unripe grapes, from which, when used instead of lemons, is made the celebrated Gaspacho of the Spaniards, far superior to lemonade. P UFFS. 581.—Regent’s Pastry.—Take lb. of almonds ground into flour, a little powdered sugar, and a few drops of some con- crete essence ; make it into a paste with the white of an egg; then make another paste with sugar, flour, and butter, worked up with the whites of eggs ; roll it out; then lay it upon the almond-paste, and cut both together into shapes, brush them over with egg, then sprinkle chopped almonds over them, and bake upon buttered paper in a tart-pan; ornament the pastry with jam when it comes from the oven. Apple Puffs.—Pare and core the fruit, and either stew them in a stone jar on a hot hearth, or bake them. When cold, mix the pulp of the apple with sugar and lemon-peel shred fine, taking as little of the apple-juice as you can. Bake them in thin paste, in a quick oven : i of an hour will do them if small. Orange or quince marmalade is a great improvement. Cinnamon pounded or orange-flower water as a variety. Lemon Puffs.—Pound and sift 4 lb. of loaf-sugar, grate the rind of 1 large lemon or 2 small ones; then whip up the white of an egg to a froth, and mix all together to the consistency of good paste; cut it into shapes, and bake upon writing-paper, being careful not to handle the paste: the oven must be very slow for this purpose. Cheese Ptffs.—Strain cheese-curd from the whey, and beat 4 pint of it fine in a mortar, with 14 spoonful of flour, 3 eggs, but only 1 white, a spoonful of orange-flower water, 4 of a nutmeg, and sugar to make it pretty sweet; lay a little of this paste, in very small round cakes, on a tin plate. If the oven is hot, 1 of an hour will bake them. Serve with pudding- sauce. To those who make cheese, these puffs are not bad ; but they are hardly worth the trouble of preparing the curd. Parmesan Puffs.—Take 4 lb. of cheese, the same quantityPUFFS. Chap.

Excellent Light Puffs.—Mix 2 spoonfuls of flour, a little grated lemon-peel, some nutmeg, 4 spoonful of brandy, a little loaf-sugar, and 1 egg; then fry it enough, but not brown ; beat it in a mortar with 5 eggs, whites and yolks ; put a quan- tity of lard in a frying-pan, and when quite hot drop a dessert- spoonful of batter at a time ; turn as they brown. Serve them immediately with sweet sauce. Spanish Puffs.—Put 1 oz. of fresh butter into a quart stew- pan ; when hot, put in 4 spoonfuls of flour; stir it over the fire for 5 minutes; have ready boiling a gill of milk, which stir in by degrees so as to avoid making it lumpy ; when it is thoroughly boiled, take it off the fire, stir in 6 eggs, a pinch of salt, a little nutmeg, chopped lemon-peel, and a handful of currants, with sugar to palate, and sufficient orange-flower water to flavour it; let it get cold ; when wanted for use have some lard boiling, make the batter into balls the size of a small walnut, fry them until they burst; drain ; dust them over with powdered sugar; serve with wine-sauce. German Puffs.—Put 4 lb. of butter into a breakfast-cupful of milk, place the pan upon the fire, and when it boils add a cupful of flour; beat all well together, and, when cold, mix in 6 eggs, leaving out 2 of the whites; beat up some sugar and grated lemon-peel with the eggs, and bake the puffs in a moderately-heated oven. Austrian Puffs.—2 oz. of pounded almonds, the same of clarified butter and sifted sugar, 2 spoonfuls of flour, the yolks of 2 eggs, 4 pint of cream, and a little orange-flower water ; beat all together, butter the pans, fill them only half full, and bake for 4 an hour in a slow oven. French Puffs.—Take a pint of new milk, boil half, and mix the other half very smoothly with 4 heaped spoonfuls of fine flour; then add it to the boiling milk, and boil it until it is a stiff paste. When cold, take the yolks of 5 eggs, the whites of 2, a tablespoonful of sifted sugar, and beat the whole into a light batter in a marble mortar ; then drop it from a spoon into boiling lard, fry of a light brown, and serve it up with sifted438 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIII. sugar over each. A small piece of any candied fruit may be dropped into each spoonful of batter. Irish Puffs.—Pound i lb. of sweet and 1 oz. of bitter almonds, but not too finely; take i lb. of loaf-sugar pounded and sifted, the whites of 2 eggs beaten to a thick froth ; mix all together, and put the puffs into pattypans covered with paste; then sift powdered sugar over them thickly, and bake them a light brown. The flavour may be improved by pound- ing the almonds with orange-flower water or a little essence of lemon. Lady Abbess's Puffs.—Take 3 oz. of Jordan almonds and i oz. of butter, with 2 oz. of loaf-sugar; pound them with a little rose-water till they become a thick paste; spread the paste on buttered tins, and bake them in a slow oven. When cold, put a spoonful of jam in each, and cover it with whipped cream. ^ GA UFFRES. 582.—Take 4 or 5 oz. of flour, 3 oz. of pounded sugar, i pint of whipped cream, 4 or 5 eggs, a small stick of pounded vanilla, a grating of nutmeg, and a little salt, with a glass of cure90a or ratafia. Place the flour, sugar, and salt in a basin, then add the yolk of eggs, the vanilla, and the spirit, mixing them well together, and gradually adding the whipped cream. Just before using the batter, add the whites of eggs, whipped to a froth, and mix them in lightly, so as to thoroughly incorporate them with it. Bak^ these gauffres in tongs made for the pui’pose, observing, however, that the iron be very carefully heated, and the super- fluous heat allowed to go off previously to filling them with batter; rub the tongs with fresh butter; fill the bottom part with batter, and fasten on the top, then turn it, and, when a fine brown on both sides, shake some pounded spice and sugar over them, and send them to table. They may be spread with any kind of preserve or jelly. Gauffres a la Flamande.—Take 6 eggs well beaten, mix into them ^ lb. of flour to a smooth paste; dissolve a piece of German yeast, about thef size of a nutmeg, in a wineglassful of warm water, with a gill of warm milk, a little salt, 2 table- spoonfuls of orange-flower water, and 6 oz. of butter; mix them with the flour till all is well worked, using a wooden spoon; set it in a warm place for nearly 2 hours, when it will439 G-AUFFRES, &c. Chap. XXIII.] have risen 2 or 3 inches; work it round a little to subdue the fermentation; let it stand i an hour, and it will be fit for use. Put the gauffre-irons upon a slow fire, letting both sides be hot; wipe them, and rub the inside slightly with a bit of fat bacon ; put in 2 spoonfuls of the paste, close the irons, and bake them for a few minutes. The colour should be a light gold colour, and very crisp. The irons can be nalf-opened to see if it is done. When of the proper colour, turn it out, and proceed with the remainder in the same way. Take 1 lb. of loaf-sugar, and i oz. of cinnamon, pounded and passed through a sieve; dip the gauffres into it on both sides, and serve hot upon a napkin. Place them in the form of a pyramid. MINCE-PIES. 583.—In making these, the first thing to be done is to pre- pare the mince-meat. The following are selected from a variety of receipts, all excellent for the purpose :— Take 2 lbs. of raisins stoned, 2 lbs. of currants, 1 lb. of sultana raisins, 2 lbs. of apples, f lb. of sugar, 2 lbs. of suet, the juice of 2 lemons, and the rind of 1 chopped very fine ; 4 lb. of mixed spice,a 2 glasses of brandy, 2 oz. of citron, and 2 of candied lemon-peel. Or:—2 lbs. of the inside of a sirloin of beef, boiled, and picked from skin, and 44 lbs. of suet, all chopped very fine. Take 8 large apples chopped, 6 lbs. of currants clean washed and dried, a twopenny loaf grated, 1 oz. of nutmegs, i oz. of cloves, a little pepper and salt, 14 lb. of sugar; grate the peel of an orange and a lemon, add the juice of 6 oranges and 2 lemons: mix all these ingredients well together, pour over the whole a pint of port wine and one of brandy. Add sweetmeats in making the pies. Or:—Take f lb. of lean beef, boiled well and chopped fine, 2 lbs. of suet also chopped fine, 1 lb. of moist sugar, 1 lb. of carefully washed and picked currants, 1 lb. of raisins (when stoned, to be chopped), 9 good sound winter apples, peeled, cored, and chopped, and the grated rind of a lemon; season 'with mixed spice and a teaspoonful of salt; thoroughly mix the whole; add a wineglassful of port wine and 2 Qf brandy; 2 oz. cinnamon, 2 oz. allspice, 2 oz. cloves, ^ oz. nutmeg, 4 oz. ginger, 2 oz. coriander, all finely powdered and mixed, make a very good mixed spice, and should be bottled and kept well corked.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIII. 440 press it down into a stone jar, and keep it well covered ; when the pies are filled, lay sliced candied peel on the top of the meat. The following we particularly recommend for its being com- municated by a celebrated tavern-keeper, from whom we have received much valuable information :—1 lb. each of currants, Valentia raisins, Ripston pippins, calf’s-foot, and pickled ox- tongue boiled and chopped ; £ lb. of suet, £ lb. of sugar, £ lb. of candied peel, 1£ pint of wine and brandy, the juice of 2 lemons, with a small teaspoonful of mixed spice. Any of these receipts being now prepared, mix the ingre- dients well together with the hands, and put it into a jar or jars for use. The flavour of the mince-meat will be much improved by lying together a few days before it is used. It will keep good for many weeks, or even months. To make the pies, have some pans of any required size, or a small dish or plate. Cover them first with a sheet of short paste, made with £ lb. of butter rubbed in with 1 lb. of flour, and made into rather a stiff paste with water; then fill them well with the mince-meat, making it high in the centre, leaving a little space from the edge ; sprinkle or moisten these edges with water, and put on a moderately thick covering of very light puff-paste ; trim the paste off to the edge of the pan, and bake in a moderately-heated oven. When the crust is done, so are the pies. LENT PIES. 584. —Boil a dozen eggs quite hard, and chop the yolks very fine ; chop also a dozen of moderate-sized juicy apples, peeled and cored, together with 2 lbs. of stoned raisins ; add 2 lbs. of currants, 1 lb. of sugar, and a tablespoonful each of powdered cinnamon, nutmeg, and beaten mace; take also the juice and grated peel of 3 ripe lemons, with £ lb. of citron cut into slips ; mix all these thoroughly, and moisten the whole with a pint each of white wine and brandy. If at hand, a little rose-water may be added, and ratafia may be used instead of brandy. S WEE T FA TTIES. 585. —Chop the meat of a boiled calf s-foot, of which you use the liquor for jelly, with 2 apples, 1 oz. of orange and lemon peel candied, and some fresh peel and juice ; mix with them £ a nutmeg grated, the yolk of an egg, a spoonful ofCHEESECAKES. Chap. XXIII.] 441 brandy, and 4 oz. of currants, washed and dried ; bake in small pattypans. Croustade or Dresden Patties.—Slice some stale bread about i inch thick ; cut from it, with a round paste-cutter, as many croustades as will be required : mark the centres with a smaller cutter, scoop out the insides as in paste patties, then fry them a light brown, drain them well, and fill them with any hot compote of fruit or hot preserve. The croustade may be filled with any sort of minced meat or fowl, and served as an entree in the first course. They are very nice made with the rounds of a French roll; it should be pared very thin, then cut in rounds of such thickness as to allow the centres to be taken out; dip them in milk, and let them drain ; do not let them break; brush them with egg, and sift the rasping of the roll over them; fry them a pale brown, and fill with oysters, stewed mushrooms, &c., or, as above, with fruit or preserve. Patties resembling Mince Pies.—Chop the kidney and fat of cold veal, apple, orange, and lemon-peel candied, fresh currants, a little wine, 2 or 3 cloves, a little brandy, and a bit of sugar. Bake as before. Patties with Curds.—Take some very rich milk, put into it some lemon-juice or vinegar, place it on the fire that it may curdle, drain off the whey through a sieve ; add to the curds the yolk of an egg beaten up in 2 spoonfuls of milk, a few currants, and a little pounded cinnamon. Make the paste and prepare the patties in the same way as in the preceding receipt. CHEESECAKES. 586.—Strain the whey from the curd of 2 quarts of milk ; when rather dry crumble it through a coarse sieve, and mix with 6 oz. of fresh butter, 1 oz. of pounded blanched almonds, a little orange-flower water, 1 a glass of raisin wine, a grated biscuit, 4 oz. of currants, some nutmeg and cinnamon in fine powder, and beat all the above with 3 eggs and pint of cream till quite light: then line the pattypans with a thin puff paste, and fill them three parts full. A plainer sort.—Turn 3 quarts of milk to curd, break it, and drain the whey: when dry, break it in a pan, with 2 oz. of butter, till perfectly smooth; put to it Hpint of thin cream or good milk, and add sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and 3 oz. of currants.442 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XKIII. Another way.—Mix the curd of 3 quarts of milk, 1 lb. of currants, 12 oz. of Lisbon sugar, 4 oz. of cinnamon and nutmeg, the peel of 1 lemon beaten in a mortar, the yolks of 8 and whites of 6 eggs, a pint of scalding cream, and a glass of brandy. Put a light thin puff-paste in the pattypans, and three parts fill them. Miss Bratty s Cheesecakes.-—The yolks of 8 eggs, 8 oz. of .sugar finely-powdered and sifted, 8 oz. of sweet almonds powdered, beat all together till very white. Line the pans with a thin paste; immediately before you put them into the oven, mix the size of a walnut of butter melted into them over a fire. If the oven be too hot they will fall when taken out. Or:—10 eggs, leave out half the whites, 1 lb. of sugar finely powdered and sifted, 4 lb. of flour, 3 oz. of butter, 3 oz. of sweet almonds, with a glass of brandy put into them while they are pounding. Beat them all together, and butter the pans very will. Without Butter.—Beat the yolks of 10 eggs and the whites of 5 separately, beat them extremely well, 1 lb. of sugar powdered and sifted, put to your eggs by spoonfuls ; beat both till very white ; add 14 oz. of flour, 2 or 3 spoonfuls of brandy, and some carraway seeds. Lemon Cheesecakes.—Mix 4 oz. of sifted lump sugar and 4 oz. of butter, and gently melt it; then add the yolks of 2 and the white of 1 egg, the rind of 3 lemons shred fine, and the juice of 14, 1 Savoy biscuit, some blanched almonds pounded, 3 spoonfuls of brandy. Or:—Boil 2 large lemons, or 3 small ones, and after squeezing pound them well together in a mortar, taking out the inner skin; add 4 oz. of loaf sugar, the yolks of 6 eggs, and 8 oz. of fresh butter. Fill the pattypans half full. Orange Cheesecakes.—When you have blanched 4 lb. of almonds, beat them very fine, with orange-flower water, 4 lb. of fine sugar beaten and sifted, and 1 lb. of butter that has been melted carefully without oiling, and which must be nearly cold before you use it; then beat the yolks of 10 and whites of 4 eggs; pound 2 candied oranges, and a fresh one with the bitterness boiled out, till as tender as marmalade, without any lumps ; beat the whole together, and put into pattypans. Almond Cheesecakes.—Blanch and pound 4 oz. of almonds,CHEESECAKES. Chap. XXIII.] 443 and a few bitter, with a spoonful of water ; then add 4 oz. of sugar pounded, a spoonful of cream, and the whites of 2 eggs well beaten ; mix all as quick as possible ; put into very small pattypans, and bake in a rather warm oven under 20 minutes. Another.—Press the whey from as much curd as will fill 2 dozen small pattypans; then put it on the back of a sieve, and with i oz. of butter rub it through with the back of a spoon ; put to it 6 yolks and 3 whites of eggs, and a few almonds of both sorts pounded, with as much sugar as will make the curd properly sweet; mix with these a wineglassful of sherry or Madeira, in which boil the rind of a Seville orange, if you can get one, or, if not, a large ripe one of the common kind, with all its juice. Beat all gradually together, and when thoroughly blended fill the pattypans; the baking will take from 4 of an hour to 20 minutes. Potato Cheesecake.—4 oz. of butter, the same of pounded sugar, 6 oz. of potatoes boiled and floured through a sieve, the rind of 1 lemon, and half the juice, unless acid is desirable ; mix these ingredients well together, with 2 eggs, and fill the tart-pan and bake it. CHEESECAKE-STOCK, that will keep for several years.—E. R. 587. —To i lb. of butter put 1 lb. of loaf-sugar broken into small pieces, 6 eggs, leaving out 2 whites, the rind of 3 lemons grated, and the juice of 3 ; put them all into a pan, and let them simmer over the fire until the sugar is dissolved, and it begins to thicken like honey. When cold put it into sweet- meat-pots for use. When made into cheesecakes, add grated sweet biscuits. Line the small tartlet-pans used for these small cakes with good, but not too light, puff-paste : make them of a deep yellow colour, and put on each a strip of candied citron. ICING FOR FRUIT PIES AND TARTS. 588. —The common mode is to take the white of an egg, whisked to a froth, mixed thickly with pounded sugar, and laid on with a quill feather. For larger tarts it should, how- ever, be laid on more thickly, and comfits or lemon-peel may be stuck into it.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIII. 444 PUDDINGS. 589.—There are two different sorts of paste for puddings, one for meat and the other for fruit. For Meat Pudding.—To 1 lb. of flour add 8 oz. of finely chopped beef-suet cut from the kidney. Mix it with water, but do not wet it too much : after mixing it well together with a wooden spoon, roll out the paste and put in the meat; then close it; boil it in a cloth which has been floured, tie it up, but leave sufficient room to permit the swelling of the paste. Veal-suet may also be used, but that of beef is better; or a mixture of both is not bad. If puddings be boiled in shapes, the crust is not near so light. For Fruit Puddings the paste should be made as for a pie —using butter instead of suet; but, unless for the sake of appearance, they should never be boiled in shapes. A very little salt added to all paste much improves it. Sweet Pudding.—Very good puddings may be made ivithout eggs; but they should have very little liquid added to them, and must boil longer than puddings with eggs. A spoonful of yeast will serve instead of 2 eggs, and a pinch of soda will make it still lighter. 2 large spoonfuls of snow will supply the place of 1 egg, and make a pudding equally good. This is a useful piece of information, as snow generally falls in the season when eggs are dear. The sooner it is used after it falls the better; but it may be taken up from a clean spot, and kept in a cool place some hours, without losing its good qualities. Bottled malt-liquors are also a good substitute for eggs ; the sooner used after the cork is drawn the better. Eggs should always be broken separately into a cup before they are thrown together, as a single bad one might occasion the loss of a great many Avithout this precaution : the yolks and Avhites, beaten long and separately, make the article they are put into much lighter. They must always be strained after beating. To avoid repetition, let it be observed that, Avhen pudding- sauce is ordered, wine, sugar, and very thick melted butter, boiled up together, is the sauce intended. If the pudding be partly of bread, the cloth should be tied so as to allow for swelling; if of flour, rather more tight.445 PUDDINGS. Chap. XXIII.] Basins or forms are much better in appearance than cloths for boiling' puddings, but it makes them far less light. The water should boil quickly when the pudding is put in, and care taken that it continues to do so, or the pudding will be heavy ; and it should be moved about for a minute or two, that the ingredients may not separate. All dishes in which puddings are baked should be lined with paste an inch or two below the edge, as well as on it; the dish must be first rubbed with butter. If a pudding is to be turned out from a mould, it must be entirely lined with paste. The ingredients of puddings should not be put into the basin or dish till the minute they go into the water or oven. Sago, and all sorts of seeds, should lie in water an hour before they are made into puddings, and be well washed ; the want of this caution causes an earthy taste. If the butter be strong that is used in puddings, they will not taste well, whatever good things are added. A small pinch of salt improves the flavour of all mixtures, even when the other ingredients are sweet. Well-made raisin or Cape wine will serve, in most cases, when wine is ordered for puddings. As the goodness of boiled puddings greatly depends upon keeping the ingredients closely but not too compactly together, the cook should take care to have moulds and basins in readi- ness that will exactly hold the quantity directed. Puddings of bread or flour are much better if all the ingre- dients be mixed (except the eggs) 3 hours before boiling or baking; and they should be M'ell stirred just before they are put into the oven or saucepan. Plum-puddings are best boiled in a stout cloth well floured ; care should be taken that it does not burn to the bottom of the kettle ; to prevent this put a plate at the bottom. When the pudding is of a large size it is best to mix all but the liquid ingredients the day before it is boiled. When butter is ordered to be put warm into puddings, the addition of a little milk or wine will prevent its oiling. Custard Puddings to look well should simmer only, but without stopping. If boiled in a quick or careless manner the surface will not be smooth, but have little holes like honey- comb all over it. A sheet of writing-paper, thickly buttered, should be put on the top of the mould before the lid or cloth446 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIII. is put on, and the pudding should stand in the mould 5 minutes after being lifted from the water. Many persons prefer their puddings steamed, but when this is not done they should be put into plenty of boiling water, and kept well covered. Half an hour should be allowed for boiling a bread-pudding in a half-pint basin, and so on in proportion ; but puddings made up with 4 lb. of suet, and any other ingredients, will require 2 hours. SUET PUDDINGS. 590. —Finely chop 1 lb. of beef suet; mix with it 14 lb. of flour, 2 eggs well beaten, a little salt, and as little milk as will mix it. Boil 4 hours. It eats well next day cut in slices and fried, and may be eaten either with salt or sugar. Or:—Take 8 oz. of grated bread, 3 oz. of finely chopped suet, and 4 oz. of pounded loaf-sugar, the juice and grated peel of 2 lemons, and 1 egg well beaten; mix all together; put it into a buttered basin and boil 1 hour; or make it into dumplings, and boil 20 minutes. Serve with wine sauce. Of veal-suet, cut the crumb of a threepenny loaf into slices; boil and sweeten 2 quarts of new milk, and pour over it. When soaked, pour out a little of the milk, and mix with 6 eggs well beaten and half a nutmeg. Lay the slices of bread into a dish, with layers of currants and finely chopped veal-suet, 1 lb. of each. Butter the dish well, and bake; or you may boil it in a basin if you prefer it. Balls of suet pudding, not larger than the size of an egg, are put into gravy soup. They will take from 20 minutes to 4 an hour boiling; in that time they will be done through, and so light as to swim to the top. They may be also served separately, and are an excellent accompaniment to corned beef. BEEF-STEAK PUDDING. 591. —Of all savoury puddings perhaps those made with beef are the best. The following is the mode of making them in all the clubs :— Take from 1 lb. to 14 lb. of the inside of a sirloin of beef, or the same quantity of rump-steak, cutting off part of the fat: beat it until tender, cut it thin and divide into small slices along with 2 mutton kidneys or 1 veal kidney; to these add a dozen of native oysters, bearded. The whole is then sea-Chap. XXIII.] MEAT PUDDINGS. 447 soned with pepper and salt and a minced shalot. Boil it from 24 to 3 hours. When done have ready some strong- beef- o-ravy, made savoury with a little mushroom ketchup; make a hole in the paste and pour it into the pudding. If for a. family pudding the oysters and the kidneys may be omitted: let the steak be prepared as above, adding, it you choose, some layers of sliced onions. MUTTON AND KIDNEY PUDDING. 592. —Cut slices from an underdone leg of mutton, with kidneys, sufficient to form alternate layers, mixed with some minced onions. It may be made either in a shape or solely in paste, but in either case it should not be very highly seasoned: it should, however, have some good gravy, to be poured into it when boiled, for which walnut-ketchup will be found more appropriate than mushroom. RABBIT PUDDING. 593. —Clean the rabbit well, take off the head, and cut the carcase into pieces, as for a fricassee, leaving out the rib- bones ; then parboil the liver, mince it and mix it with the brains: that done, season the fricassee with pepper and salt, a little mushroom powder, and a clove of powdered mace ; lay the fricassee either in a shape or in the paste, mingling with it the mince, and interlaying it with a few thin slices of pickled pork: it will take nearly 2 hours boiling. The gravy may be made of the head, lights, and bones, with a bit of ham or bacon. CHICKEN P UDDING. 594. -—Fricassee 2 young chickens, season them slightly with a little mushroom powder, mace, nutmeg, and salt, but no pepper. Previously take the giblets and stew them down with a bit of meat to make gravy ; put 2 tablespoonfuls into the paste, and keep the rest to fill up or put under the pudding. 2 hours will boil it. GAME PUDDINGS. 595. —Game of any description maybe made into puddings, and when partly boned, well spiced, with minced truffle or mushroom, mace, and a clove of garlic, and boiled within a light paste, they are very rich, and the paste particularly fine,MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIII. 448 as it absorbs so much of the gravy; but the boiling deprives the game of much of its high flavour, and a woodcock or a snipe should never be so dressed, as they lose all the savour of the trail. Or:—Make a batter with flour, milk, eggs, pepper, and salt; pour a little into the bottom of a pudding-dish; then put seasoned poultry or game of any kind into it, and a little shred onion ; pour the remainder of the batter over, and bake in a slow oven. A single chicken, partridge, or pigeon may be thus made into a dumpling :—Stuff' it with chopped oysters, lay it on its back in the paste, and put a bit of butter rolled in flour on the breast; close the paste in the form of a dumpling, put into hot wrater, and let it boil for 2 hours. FISH PUDDINGS. 596. —Take 2 haddocks raw; bone them, beat them fine in a marble mortar, rub through a sieve ; then put the fish into the mortar with 2 eggs, 1 onion, a little parsley, pepper and salt, a slice of bread rubbed into crumbs, i lb. of veal suet chopped. Beat all together, put it into a shape, boil it an hour, turn it out and send it to table with a rich brown sauce. A little gravy-soup should be mixed with it whilst passing through the sieve. An excellent fish pudding may be made of eels, either alone or with kidney and oysters, as in eel-pie; some very rich beef-sauce should be made and put under the pudding if boiled in paste, or in a sauce-boat if it be made in a shape. HERB PUDDINGS. 597. —Pick 2 handfuls of parsley-leaves from the stems, half the quantity of spinach, 2 hearts of lettuces, a large hand- ful of mustard and cress, a few leaves of white beet, and a small handful of chives : wash, and boil all together 3 minutes; drain the water from them, and mash very fine; mix well, and add salt and pepper. Have ready a batter, made of 1 oz. of flour, a pint of thin cream, and 2 eggs; stir it into the herbs, and cover the dish with a good crust. This pudding has much the flavour of omelet; and in Lent, when the salads are all coming into season, it may be very aptly brought to table on fast-days. Tansy-pudding.—Pound a handful of green tansy in a mortar; add the juice to a pint of batter and bake it.SWEET PUDDINGS. Chap. XXIII.] 449 SWEET PUDDINGS. Under this head the plum-pudding stands foremost as a truly national dish. The following receipt, communicated to a periodical publication by a man-cook of much experience, we can vouch for as an excellent way of making a RICH PLUM PUDDING. 598.—Stone carefully 1 lb. of the best raisins, wash and pick 1 lb, of currants,a chop very small 1 lb. of fresh beef suet, blanch and chop small or pound 2 oz. of sweet almonds and 1 oz. of bitter ones; mix the whole well together, with 1 lb. of sifted flour, and the same weight of crumb of bread soaked in milk, then squeezed dry and stirred with a spoon until reduced to a mash, before it is mixed with the flour. Cut in small pieces 2 oz. each of preserved citron, orange, and lemon peel, and add £ oz. of mixed spice : } lb. of moist sugar should be put into a basin, with 8 eggs, and well beaten together with a 3-pronged fork; stir this with the pudding, and make it of a proper consistence with milk. Re- member that it must not be made too thin, or the fruit will sink to the bottom, but be made to the consistence of good thick batter. Two wineglassfuls of brandy should be poured over the fruit and spice, mixed together in a basin, and allowed to stand 3 or 4 hours before the pudding is made, stirring them occasionally. It must be tied in a cloth, and will take 5 hours of constant boiling. When done, turn it out on a dish, sift loaf-sugar over the top, and serve it with wine-sauce in a boat, and some poured round the pudding. The pudding will be of considerable size, but half the quantity of materials, used in the same proportion, will be y equally good. In addition to the wine-sauce, have a metal sauce-boat filled with brandy ; set it alight on the table, and pour a portion of * The best method of cleansing currants is to put them into a common co- lander, over a pan with sufficient water to cover them, rub them well between the hands in the water to separate the knobs, and stir them about. The small sand and gravel will then fall through the holes and sink to the bottom of the pan. After being washed clean, and the water drained from them, the large stones can then be easily picked out by sorting them over on a large I! dish.—Family Herald. 2 G450 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY.

Shelford Pudding.—Mix f lb. of currants or raisins, 1 lb. of suet, 1 lb. of flour, 6 eggs, a little good milk, some lemon- peel, a little salt. Boil it in a melon-shape 6 hours. Plum Puddings may also be made of different qualities, as follows:— The same proportions of flour and suet, and half the quantity of fruit, with spice, lemon, a glass of wine, or not, and 1 egg, and milk, will make an excellent pudding, if long boiled. A mealy potato, grated while hot, and beaten well Avith a spoonful of milk, will add greatly to the lightness of plum puddings, whether boiled or baked. Or:—A very light plum pudding may be made of grated bread, suet, and stoned raisins, 4 oz. each, mixed Avith 2 well- beaten eggs, 3 or 4 spoonfuls of milk, and a little salt. Boil 4 hours. A spoonful of brandy, sugar, and nutmeg, in melted butter, may be served as sauce. Or:—The French mode—Mix 6 oz. of suet, 7 oz. of grated bread, 2 oz. of sugar, 4 lb. of French plums, 3 Avell-beaten eggs, a small teacupful of milk, and a dessertspoonful of ratafia. Let it stand 2 hours, and boil it the same length of time. Observe to stir it well the last thing. These latter puddings may also be baked. HUNTER'S PUDDING. 599. —Mix 1 lb. each of suet, flour, currants, and raisins, the latter stoned and a little cut; the rind of ? a lemon shred as fine as possible, 6 Jamaica peppers in fine powder, 4 eggs, a i glass of brandy, a little salt, and as little milk as will make it i of a proper consistence; boil it in a floured cloth or a melon- mould 8 or 9 hours. Serve Avith sAveet-sauce. Add a spoon- j ful of peach-Avater for change of flavour. This pudding will keep, after it is boiled, 6 months, if kept tied up in the same cloth, and hung up, folded in a sheet of cap-paper to preserve it from dust, being first cold. When j 'to be used, it must boil a full hour. MONTAGU PUDDING.—E. R. 600. —£ lb. of suet chopped, but not finely, 4 tablespoon- fuls of flour, and 4 eggs, mixed into a batter with 4 spoonfuls |Chap. XXIII.] SWEET PUDDINGS. 451 of milk ; add i lb. of raisins stoned, and a little sugar, and boil the whole 4 hours in a basin. BATTER PUDDING—E. R. 601. —To 6 oz. of flour add a little salt and a gill of milk ; mix them quite smooth, beat up 4 eggs and strain them, then add them to the batter, with more milk, until the mixture is as thick as good cream. Strain the batter, and put it into a basin rubbed with butter ; tie a cloth over it, and boil it 1 hour. The excellence of a batter pudding mainly depends upon its being strained twice, that is, the eggs first, and then the whole; if this point be observed, it will be as rich and as good as a custard pudding, without the danger of breaking. If it is wanted to be particularly fine, 1 or 2 eggs more may be added. Serve with melted butter, sugar, lemon-juice, and a glass of wine. Or:—Rub 3 spoonfuls of fine flour extremely smooth by degrees into a pint of milk, with a saltspoonful of salt; simmer till it thickens; stir in 2 oz. of butter; set it to cool; then add the yolks of 3 eggs; flour a cloth that has been wetted or butter a basin, and put the batter into it; tie it tight, and, plunge it into boiling water, the bottom upwards. Boil it hour, and serve with plain butter. A little ginger, nutmeg, and lemon-peel may be added; or currant jelly may be laid on the top. CUSTARD PUDDING. 602. —Flavour a pint of milk with the peel of 1 lemon, an inch of cinnamon, and a bay-leaf; when boiled sufficiently, strain it, and sweeten to palate: break 4 eggs, beat them up, pour the milk to them ; put it into a mould and boil for ^ an hour. Serve with wine-sauce. Or :—Mix 1 tablespoonful of flour into a pint of milk ; add 4 eggs well beaten, a tablespoonful of pounded loaf-sugar, and a little orange-flower water; put into a buttered basin, laying a paper over it before putting on the cloth ; let it stand 4 minutes before turning it out. It should boil i an hour. Baked.—A plain but good custard pudding may be made by boiling a quart of milk until it is reduced to a pint; take from it a few spoonfuls, and let it cool, mixing with it very perfectly one spoonful of flour, which add to the boiling milk, and stir it until quite cool. Beat 4 yolks and 2 whites of eggs, strain 2 u 2MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIII. 452 them, and stir them into the milk with 2 oz. of moist sugar, 2 or 3 spoonfuls of wine, and a little grated nutmeg. Bake it i an hour, or until it is firm and brown. MARROW PUDDING.—E. R. 603. —Four oz. of marrow, 4 oz. of biscuits, 3 oz. of jar rai- sins stoned, candied orange-peel, sugar, and nutmeg to the taste. Place these articles in layers in a dish surrounded by paste ; then beat up 4 eggs, leaving out the whites of 2, in 4 pint of cream or good milk, and pour it over the other ingre- dients ; it will take l£ hour to bake. Or :—Six oz. of marrow picked clean of fibre, and not too finely minced, to which add 4 oz. each of pounded macaroons and crumbs of bread, with 1 or 2 oz. of sweet-almond powder; mix these together, seasoning them as above with candied citron, sugar, and nutmeg, but omitting the raisins. Then beat up the materials in a full pint of rich cream, and the yolks of 6 eggs, flavoured with a glass of ratafia. Bake it in a shape, but only until it is well browned. CURB PUDDING.—E. R. 604. —Turn 2 quarts of milk, and drain off the curd. Beat it in a mortar with 2 oz. of butter, until the butter and curd are well united. Then beat the yolks of 6 eggs and the whites of 3 ; add them to the curd ; add a little grated bread or biscuit, a teaspoonful of grated lemon-peel, some nutmeg, and a few pounded peach kernels; mix them well together; butter a dish, and bake it with a crust round the edges. Currants may be added. For boiled Curd Pudding.—Rub the curd of 2 quarts of milk well drained through a sieve. Mix it with 6 eggs, a little cream, 2 spoonfuls of orange-flower water, 4 a nutmeg, flour and crumbs of bread each 3 spoonfuls, currants and raisins ilb. of each. Boil an hour in-a thick well-floured cloth. A very delicate species of curd can be made by mixing a pint of very sour butter-milk with 2 quarts of new milk. In ___ Ireland it is the constant mode of making “ two-milk-whey. TRANSPARENT PUDDING. 605. —Beat 8 eggs very well; put them into a stewpan, with ^ lb. of sugar pounded fine, the same quantity of butter,Chap. XXIII.] SWEET PUDDINGS. 453 and some nutmeg grated. Set it on the fire, and keep stirring it till it thickens. Then set it in a basin to cool: put a rich puff-paste round the edge of the dish; pour in the pudding, and bake it in a moderate oven. It will cut light and clear. You may add candied orange and citron, if you like. BREAD PUDDING.—E. R. 606.—Take a pint of bread-crumbs and cover them with milk ; add some cinnamon, lemon-peel, and grated nutmeg; put them on a gentle fire until the crumbs are well soaked. Take out the cinnamon and lemon-peel, beat the crumbs and milk well together, add 4 eggs well beaten, 1 oz. of butter, 2 oz. of sugar, i lb. of currants, and boil it an hour. An excellent Bread Padding.—Pour a pint of boiling milk over the crumb of 4 French rolls; when nearly cold add 6 eggs, i lb. of currants, and 1 oz. of candied citron cut into dice; mix well together; pour it into a plain round mould, round the edges of which place a band of buttered paper; place it in a stewpan with about 2 inches of boiling water at the bottom ; cover a sheet of paper over the pudding, and let it simmer gently over the fire, keeping the stewpan covered down close until the pudding becomes quite firm ; take off the paper, and turn it upon a dish; pour over it the following sauce -•— Put <j a pint of melted butter into a stewpan; stir into it the yolks of 2 eggs, a glass of brandy, the juice of a lemon with sugar sufficient to sweeten it; stir it over the fire till it begins to thicken ; then strain it, and serve. Or :—Take either stale or fresh bread, of a light sort; put it into a pan, boil the milk, and when it boils pour it over the bread; then allow it to cool, and in the mean time beat up 3 or 4 eggs with a tablespoonful of fine wheaten flour; beat the egg and flour into the bread and milk until the whole is as light as possible. See that the water boils when you put in the pudding, and keep it boiling for It hour. Baked, Bread Pudding.—Prepare the milk and bread as before; then stir in \ lb. of butter and the same quantity of sugar, with a tablespoonful of cinnamon-powder and grated nutmeg; stir the whole well together, and let it cool; beat 6 eggs and stir them gradually into the mixture after it is cold. Bake it in a deep dish for 1 hour. A little chopped marrow mingled with it will be found an improvement.454 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIII. Brown Bread Pudding may be made with 4 lb. of stale brown bread coarsely grated,. 4 lb. of Valencia raisins cut in halves, the same of chopped suet; sugar and nutmeg. Mix with 4 eggs, 2 spoonfuls of brandy, and 2 of cream ; boil it for 3 or 4 hours in a cloth or basin that exactly holds it Serve with sweet-sauce. Prunes, or French plums, instead of raisins, make a fine pudding, either with suet or bread. BREAD AND BUTTER PUDDING. 607. —Make a custard of 1 egg and 4 a pint of milk, by boiling the milk with a little lemon-peel and sugar, and beat- ing up the egg in it, putting it on the fire to thicken ; butter slices of bread or French roll, and-soak them for an hour or twro in this mixture ; then lay them in a dish, sprinkling cur- rants between each layer, with a little pounded sugar; and, if meant to be very nice, put some sweetmeats on the top; but both the fruit and the sweetmeats may be omitted if thought proper. Pour over it another t pint of milk beaten up with 2 eggs. BISCUIT PUDDING. 608. —Slice 4 common biscuits thin, boil them in 3 gills of new milk, with a piece of lemon-peel chopped as fine as pos- sible. Break it to a mash; to which put 3 oz. of warmed butter, 2 oz. of sugar, and 4 eggs well beaten; add a large spoonful of brandy. Bake or boil. Another.—On 3 grated stale Naples biscuits pour a pint of boiling cream ; when cold, add a teaspoonful of cinnamon in finest powder, the yolks of 4 and whites of 2 eggs, a spoonful of orange-flower water or ratafia, 2 oz. of loaf-sugar, and 4 a spoonful of flour, or almond flour, rubbed smooth. PUDDINGS OF ITALIAN PASTE. 609. —Baked Vermicelli.—Simmer 4 oz. of vermicelli in a pint of new milk 10 minutes; then put to it 4 a pint of cream, a teaspoonful of pounded cinnamon, 4 oz. of butter warmed, the same of white sugar, and the yolks of 4 eggs, well beaten : a little oil of almonds or a couple of spoonfuls of ratafia will much improve the flavour. Bake in a dish without a lining ; but observe that, of the 2 sorts of vermicelli, the Genoese will require and the Neapolitan only 4 an hour of baking.455 SWEET PUDDINGS. Chap. XXIII.] Boiled Vermicelli.—Stir very gently 4 oz. of vermicelli into a pint of new milk over the stove, until it be scalding hot, but not more; then pour it into a basin, and add to it while hot 1 oz. of butter and 2 of sugar. When the above is nearly cold, mix in it, very gently, 2 well-beaten eggs, and imme- diately put it into a basin that will exactly hold it. Cover carefully with a floured cloth ; and turning the basin the nar- row end upwards, move it round for 10 minutes, and boil an hour. Serve with pudding-sauce. Macaroni.—Simmer 1 or 2 oz. of the pipe sort in a pint of milk, and a bit of lemon and cinnamon, till tender ; put it into a dish, with milk, 2 or 3 yolks of eggs, but only 1 white, sugar, nutmeg, 1 spoonful of peach-water, and 4 a glass of raisin wine. Bake with a paste round the edges. A layer of orange marmalade or raspberry jam in a maca- roni pudding, for change, is a great improvement; in which case omit the almond-water or ratafia, which you would other- wise flavour it with. Semolina is a similar paste to that of the two former; but, being made of a smaller form, it mixes better into a pudding, and may be either baked or boiled. In case of not having either ratafia or almond at hand, a glass of French brandy should be added. ARROWROOT P TJDDING. 610.—Simmer a pint of milk with a few whole allspice, coriander-seed, and half a stick of cinnamon, for 10 or 15 minutes; then sweeten it with sugar, and strain it through a hair sieve into a basin to l^oz. of arrowroot (about 1^-table- spoonful), previously mixed with a little cold water, stirring it all the time. When cold, or as soon as the scalding heat is gone, add 3 large or 4 small eggs, well beaten, and stir until the whole is perfectly blended. It may then be boiled in a well-buttered mould or basin, or baked in a dish, with a puff- jiaste crust round the edge, and grated nutmeg on the top. From £ to I of an hour will be sufficient to boil or bake it. TV hen boiled, serve it with wine-sauce. The flavour of the pudding may be occasionally varied, by using a few sweet and bitter almonds bla.nched and finely-pounded or chopped- about 1 oz. of sweet and i oz. of bitter—or with brandy or rum, orange-flower water or vanilla. J Or .-—Mix a dessertspoonful of the powder in 2 of cold milk ;MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIII. 456 pour upon it a pint of boiling milk, in which have been dis- solved 4 oz. of butter and 2 of sugar, stirring all the time. Add a little nutmeg and 5 eggs. Bake i an hour in a dish lined with paste. Turn it out. Preserved fruits of any kind, laid at the bottom, eat well. If to look clear, substitute water for milk. Polenta Pudding.—Mix i lb. of polenta (or maize flour) with H pint of milk ; let it boil till it thickens ; put into it 1 oz. of butter, a little salt, and cayenne pepper ; bake it gently for H hour. Turn it out of the dish when served. This pudding is very good with meat. Sweet Polenta Pudding.—Mix the polenta as in the fore- going receipt: when it boils, add 1 oz. of butter, i lb. of moist sugar, the same of sultana raisins, the grated rind of a lemon, and 1 oz. of candied orange-peel sliced very finely; mix the whole well together, and bake it Hhour. The great recommendation of this pudding is the absence of eggs, which are not required with polenta. A cheap pudding may be made by adding 2 tablespoonfuls of treacle to the polenta instead of the raisins, sugar, and candied peel. Sago Pudding.—Boil li pint of new milk, with 4 spoon- fuls of sago nicely washed and picked, to which add lemon- peel, cinnamon, and nutmeg; sweeten to taste; then mix 4 eggs, put a paste round the dish, and bake slowly. Millet may be used in the same way. MUFFIN AND CRUMPET PUDDING. 611. —A very delicate pudding may be made in a short time from a couple of muffins and 3 crumpets, placed alternately in layers, and either boiled or baked in batter. If boiled, they should be placed in an earthen jar, buttered on the inside, filled with the batter, and covered on the top. The muffins should be split open, and currant-jelly, slices of apple, or any sort of fruit may be inserted. Or:—Half a dozen crumpets may be boiled without any fruit, after being dipped and covered in batter; seasoned only with sugar and a little nutmeg. CIIOCOLA TE P UDDING. 612. —Boil a pint of new milk; dissolve in it 1 oz. of chocolate ; sweeten it with loaf-sugar; add the yolks of 8Chap.

SPONGE PUDDING. 613. —Butter a mould thickly, and fill it three parts full with small sponge-cakes, soaked through with wine ; fill up the mould with a rich cold custard. Butter a paper, and put on the mould; then tie a floured cloth over it quite close, and boil it an hour. Turn out the pudding carefully, and pour some cold custard over it. Or:—Bake it; and serve with wine-sauce instead of custard. COCOA-NUT PUDDING. 614. —Break the shell of a middle-sized cocoa-nut so as to leave the nut as whole as you can ; grate it with a grater after having taken off the brown skin ; mix with it 3 oz. of white sugar powdered, and about 4 of the peel of a lemon ; mix well together with the milk, and put it into a tin lined with paste, and bake it not too brown. RICE P UDDINGS. 615. —Baked Bice Pudding for a family.—Put into a very deep pan ^ lb. of rice washed and picked, 2 oz. of butter, 4oz. of sugar, and 2 quarts of milk, with a little cinnamon powder. Eggs are not necessary, but a little veal suet or marrow, chopped small, is a great improvement. Bake in a slow oven. A rich Rice Pudding.—Boil lb. of rice in water with a little bit of salt, till quite tender; drain it dry ; mix it with the yolks and whites of 4 eggs, £ pint of cream with 2 oz. of fresh butter melted in it, 4 oz. of marrow, or veal kidney suet, finely chopped, 4 lb. of currants, 2 spoonfuls of brandy or ratafia, nutmeg, and grated lemon-peel. When well mixed, put a paste round the edge, and fill the dish. Slices of candied orange, lemon, and citron may be added if approved. Bake it for 1 hour in a moderate oven. Another.—Wash 2 large spoonfuls of rice, and simmer itMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIII. 4o8 with i a pint of milk till thick; tlien put a lump of butter the size of an egg, and nearly 4 a pint of thick cream, and give it one boil. When cold, mix 4 yolks and 2 whites of eggs well beaten, sugar and nutmeg to taste, and add grated lemon and a little cinnamon. Bake f of an hour in a slowish oven, and when the pudding is ready strew over it a little powdered lump- sugar and cinnamon powder. Currants may be added to the pudding. Or:—Boil ^ a pint of rice in new milk until perfectly ten- der and not too dry; tlien add 6 eggs beaten, a spoonful of ratafia, sugar, and some grated fresh lemon ; mix well, and bake in a mould D} hour. Turn it on a hot dish, and stick it thick with almonds slit in 6. Serve with a rich custard round. It is equally good cold. A boiled Rice Pudding.—Soak 4 oz. of rice in water 4 an hour, then tie it up in a cloth (leaving room for it to swell) with 8 oz. of raisins. Boil it 2 hours, and then turn it out. Pour over it melted butter, with a little sugar and nutmeg. Rice Pudding with Fruit.—Swell the rice with a very little milk over the fire ; then mix fruit of any kind with it, currants, gooseberries scalded, pared and quartered apples, raisins, or black currants, and still better red currant jelly, with 1 egg to bind the rice; boil it well, and serve with powdered cinnamon and sugar. Ground Rice Pudding.—Mix 3 oz. of the powder with a gill of cream; when beaten into a paste, put it into a pint of warm milk and keep it simmering for 10 minutes; then add to it a piece of fresh butter, the yolks of 4 eggs with the white of 1, whip all together, and flavour it with pounded almonds and a glass of brandy, together with the usual ingre- dients of spice. Some persons colour and flavour it with saffron. Bake it in a shape, and let it remain for an hour in a moderately heated oven. SAFFRON PUDDING. GIG.—Mix f lb. of kidney suet, cut very small and free from skin, with 1 lb. of the finest flour, or ^ each of flour and French roll crumbled; take 3 eggs and beat them up in a pint of cream, with a glass of cognac and a tablespoonful of real saffron boiled up until the flavour is extracted; season it alsoSWEET PUDDINGS. 459 Chap. XXIII.] with a little pounded ginger. Put it into a floured cloth, tied tightly over it, but with room to let it swell, and boil it, without any intermission, for nearly 3 hours. A few flrops of the essential oil of saffron will give the necessary flavour. ALMOND PUDDING. 617.—Take i lb. of shelled sweet almonds, and 3 oz. of shelled bitter almonds or peach kernels ; scald and peel them ; then pound them in a mortar to a fine smooth paste, free from the smallest lumps. It is best to prepare them the day before you make your pudding. Stir to a cream 4 lb. of fresh butter and 4 lb. of powdered white sugar; and by degrees pour into it a glass each of mixed wine and brandy. Beat to a stiff froth the whites only of 12 eggs (you can preserve the yolks for other purposes), and stir alternately into the butter and sugar the pounded almonds and the beaten white of egg. When the whole is well mixed, put it into a buttered dish, and lay puff-paste round the edge. Bake it i an hour, and when done grate sugar over it. Another.—Blanch 1 lb. of sweet and 3 oz. of bitter almonds, and beat them to a fine paste, mixing them well, and adding by degrees a teacupful or more of rose-water. Boil in a pint of rich milk a few sticks of cinnamon broken up, and a few blades of mace. When the milk has come to a boil, take it off the fire; strain it into a pan, and soak in it 5 stale rusks cut into slices. They must soak till quite dissolved. Stir to a cream i lb. of fresh butter mixed with the same quantity of powdered loaf-sugar. Beat 10 eggs very light, yolks and whites, and then stir alternately into the butter and sugar the rusk, eggs, and almonds. Set it on a stove, and stir the whole, together till very smooth and thick. Put it into a buttered dish, and bake it % of an hour. Half the quantity of materials will be sufficient for an elegant table. Or:—Take 24 oz. of white bread-crumbs, and steep them in a pint of cream ; then pound h a pint of blanched almonds to a paste with some water. Beat the yolks of 6 eggs and the whites of 3 ; mix all together, and add 3 oz. of sugar and 1 oz. of beaten butter; put all over the fire ; stir it until it thickensj and then bake it in a puff-paste.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY.

Take the yolks of 3 eggs, and make up the puddings into balls. Fry them a light colour in fresh butter, and serve with white-wine sauce. Or:—Boil -j a pint of cream ; stir in l lb. of butter ; beat 4 eggs, leaving out 2 whites, and mix them with 2 oz. of flour well dried and 1 oz. of sifted sugar. When the cream is a little cool, stir it into the flour and eggs. Let it stand for i of an hour before the fire, and then bake in a quick oven for about 25 minutes. New College.—Take a penny roll grated, or, if desired to have the puddings particularly nice, an equal quantity of Naples biscuit pounded, i lb. of suet finely minced, and i lb. of cur- rants washed and picked, adding nutmeg, sugar, and a little salt. Beat up these ingredients with 3 eggs, and as much cream as will make them of a proper thickness for frying. Let the butter they are fried in be very hot; drop in the pud- dings by spoonfuls. When dished up, put a piece of green sweetmeat on the top of each. Or:—Take i lb. each of grated bread, suet, and currants, with 4 oz. of sugar, and an egg well beaten up in a glass of brandy, seasoned with nutmeg ; put into a mould, and boil for 3 hours. Trin. Coll.—Take 1 lb. of bread-crumbs sifted very clean, i lb. each of stoned raisins and currants, with 4 lb. of minced and salted tongue, beef-suet, and the same quantity of marrow, or the fat of a veal kidney, all mixed together.

The Merton Almond Pudding—is made with 6 oz. of almonds ground to flour, 6 oz. of sifted white sugar, a tea- spoonful of lemon-peel grated, a few drops of essence of lemon, and 8 eggs, leaving out 2 of the whites; beat up the eggs, and mix in the other ingredients, beating the whole for an hour one way. Let the oven be ready; oil the dish, and bake the pudding the instant it is completed. It should be beaten for a full hour, and baked immediately. The Vice- Chancellor s Pudding.—Boil a pint of milk and cream, and pour it on a slice of bread sufficient to thicken it. Beat up 4 eggs with a couple of the whites in a glass of brandy, adding sugar and spice according to taste. Put it into a buttered shape, and set it in a pan of boiling water. Half an hour will boil it. The Hector’s Pudding. — h lb. each of marrow and suet, with an equal quantity of bread-crumbs, and 2 oz. of almond powder, made into a thick batter with new milk and cream. Then take the yolks of 5 eggs with the white of 1, and beat them up in brandy. Mix all the ingredients together, sea- soning it with a very little salt and sugar to taste. Either boil it for 2 to 3 hours in a floured cloth, or put it into a mould and bake it in a slow oven until thoroughly done. When taken out, stick it over with blanched almonds. The Curate’s Pudding. — To 1 lb. of mashed potatoes, While hot, add 4 oz. of suet and 2 oz. of fltmr, a little salt, and as much milk as will give it the consistence of common suet pudding.

Put it into a shape ; boil 3 hours, and serve with pudding-sauce, the juice of 4 a lemon, and a little nutmeg. ERECHTHEUM PUDDING. 619. —Take 6 fresh eggs; let them be well beaten for 2 or 3 minutes in a basin ; then add 2 tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, a small pinch of salt, and 1 pint of milk. Flavour this mixture with 6 drops of essence of kernels; butter a mould which will hold the pudding; put it into a stewpan with water sufficient to come half way up the mould; place it by the side of the fire for about 4 an hour. It must not boil, but keep as near that heat as possible. As soon as the mixture has set, the pudding is done. When about to serve it, break 2 fresh eggs into a stewpan that will hold a pint, 2 teaspoon- fuls of powdered sugar, 2 drops of the essence of kernels;. place it over a very slow fire for 4 of a minute, merely to warm the stewpan. Whisk it with an iron whisk for 2 minutes, which will produce a very strong froth, and pour it over the pudding. Be very careful not to let the pudding boil, and not to make the eggs too warm before beating them for the sauce. QUAKING PUDDING. 620. —Scald a quart of cream ; when almost cold put to it 4 eggs well beaten, 14 spoonful of flour, some nutmeg and sugar ; tie it close in a buttered cloth, boil it an hour, and turn it out with care, lest it should crack. Serve with wine sauce. BRAND Y P UDDING. 621. —Line a mould with jar-raisins stoned, or dried cher- ries, then with thin slices of French roll, next to which put ratafias, or macaroons; then again fruit, rolls, and cakes in succession until the mould be full, sprinkling in, at times, 2 wineglassfuls of brandy.

THE BAKE WELL PUDDING. 622. —Beat the yolks of 4 eggs and the whites of 2 with + lb. of powdered loaf-sugar and i lb. of clarified butter; when well mixed, place it over the fire, and keep it constantly stirred till it thickens. Line a dish with puff-paste, and put in a layer of candied peel about an inch thick ; then pour the mixture over it and bake it in a slow oven. On this, however, it has been remarked by an intelligent cook, that “ it will be found too sweet for most palates. I have frequently had occasion to make this pudding for both large and small parties, and have found that the addition of ? a pint of milk, or milk and cream, to the eggs and sugar, with a little ratafia, or noyeau and brandy, to flavour it, has been considered a great improvement. I add the milk to the eggs and sugar when it is near boiling, without placing the mixture on the fire at all. Instead of using all candied peel, I prefer adding a portion of preserved fruits, such as dried cherries, greengages, and melon or pine-apple cut small; and, when baked, occasionally spread over the top or ornament it with some apricot or raspberry jam, or some of each, to vary the colour. When made in this way, it has been universally admired.” A BLACK-CAP PUDDING.—E. R. 623. —Rub 3 tablespoonfuls of flour, smooth, by degrees into a pint of milk, strain it, and simmer it over the fire until it thickens; stir in 2 oz. of butter; when cool add the yolks of 4 eggs beaten and strained, and t- lb. of currants washed and picked, laid at the bottom of the basin or mould previously well buttered. Put the batter into the mould, cover it tight, and plunge it into boiling water ; the currants downwards, that they may stick to the bottom and thus form the black cap. A S WEETMEA T PUDDING. 624. — Cover a dish with thin puff-paste, and lay in it freshly candied orange, lemon, and citron, 1 oz. each, sliced thin.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIII. 464 Beat the yolks of 8 and the whites of 2 eggs, and mix with 8 oz. of butter warmed, but not oiled, and 8 oz. of white sugar. Pour the mixture over the sweetmeats, and bake 1 hour in a moderate oven. 110 L Y-P OLY PUDDING. 625—Make a rich pudding-paste with flour and butter, without suet, but as light as possible. Roll it out thin, and cut it to the breadth of 8 or 10 inches, making it at the same time as long as you please ; but ^ lb. of flour and 5 oz. of butter, wetted with water, will probably be sufficient when rolled out quite smooth; then spread upon it a thick layer of raspberry, currant, or any other sort of jam, but leave about an inch of all the edges bare. That done, roll it round ; the roll of paste will secure the fruit, and the ends must be twisted together for the same purpose. Wrap it in a nicely floured cloth, and boil it for 2 to 3 hours according to size. Take it up quite hot, and when served cut it crosswise. It may appear homely, but it is an excellent and much-admired pudding. CABINET PUDDING.-E. R. 626. —Take 10 penny sponge-cakes or biscuits, 6 oz. of dried cherries or sultana raisins, yolks of 6 eggs with the whites of 4 ; beat ufr the eggs with a little nutmeg and sugar and a pint of milk; butter the mould very completely, and lay the cherries or raisins in a pattern round the bottom and sides; break each cake into 4 pieces, and lay them close to the fruit to keep it from falling; then fill up the mould with the cus- tard. Lay a piece of paper over the top, put it into a stew- pan with 2 inches depth of boiling water, and be careful that the lid of the stewpan fits quite close to keep in the steam : i of an hour will boil it. THE CONSERVATIVE PUDDING. 627. —i lb. of ratafia and macaroon cakes mixed, 4 sponge biscuits, the yolks of 8 eggs, t pint of cream, and a glass of brandy, well beaten together, the cakes being soaked in the cream and brandy. Butter a quart mould, place dried cherries or stoned raisins in a pattern over it, pour in the mixture, and place the mould in a stewpan surrounded by water, and let it simmer H hour over charcoal.465 Chap. XXIII.] SWEET PUDDINGS. THE REFORM PUDDING. 628. —Take 3 eggs, weigh them in the shell; take an equal weight of sugar and of butter, and -f of the weight of flour. Half melt the butter and beat it to a cream ; beat the eggs also, and mix them with the butter and sugar, beating the whole to a froth ; then add the flour, and the rind of a lemon grated ; beat all together, and pour it into a mould : an hour will boil it. This pudding may also be baked, substituting cream for the butter, which would render it more delicate than butter subjected to the dry heat of an oven. THE PROTECTIONIST PUDDING. 629. —Break 7 eggs into a deep pan, leaving out 3 of the whites. Put 10 oz. of loaf-sugar in a pint of water; set it over the fire until the scum rises ; pour it over the eggs ; add a teaspoonful of grated lemon-peel and the juice of a lemon. Whisk them for 20 minutes; shake in 4 lb. of flour; pour it into a tin, and put it into the oven immediately. WINDSOR PALACE PUDDINGS. 630. —Boil 1 oz. of rice in milk until it will beat into a pap; pare, core, and scald 6 apples, and beat them also with the rice, 1 oz. of finely-sifted sugar, a salt spoonful of grated lemon-peel, and a little lemon-juice, or a few drops of essence of lemon; then beat the whites of 4 eggs until they make a sfrong froth ; add the other ingredients, whisking them well together, so as to be very light. Dip a basin or mould into boiling water; pour in this souffle while the mould is quite hot, and put the mould into a pan of boiling water, boiling until the white of the eggs is set and firm. Have a custard made with the yolks of the eggs, and pour it round the pud- ding in a dish. Snow-balls may be made the same way, with pounded almonds substituted for apples. The elegance and lightness of this pudding are great recommendations. Her Majesty's Pudding.—Butter a mould, and cover it in a pattern with sweetmeats of various colours, and fruit; ciit 3 sponge-cakes in slices, and soak them in white wine; place them round the mould ; make a fine custard with 4 eggs, a pint of cream, and 2 oz. of pounded almonds; pour it in, and boil it for an hour. 2 H466 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIII; Prince Albert's Pudding.—Put 1 lb. of butter into a saucepan with £ lb. of loaf-sugar finely powdered ; mix them well together ; then add the yolks of 6 eggs well beaten, and as much fresh candied orange as will add colour and fiavour, being first beaten to a fine paste. Line the dish with paste for turning out; and when filled with the above, lay a crust over, as if it were a pie, and bake it in a slow oven. It is as good cold as hot. .Royal Nursery Pudding.—Pour scalding milk upon white bread sliced ; let it stand till well soaked; then beat it well with 4 eggs, a little sugar and grated nutmeg. Bake in small teacups, which must be only half filled. Or:—Steep the crumb of a penny loaf, grated, in about a pint of warm milk ; when soaked, beat 4 eggs, and mix with the bread; add 2 oz. of moist sugar, orange-flower water, a spoonful of wine, a little nutmeg, and a teacupful of cream. Beat all well, and bake in teacups buttered. Or:—Add 4 eggs, the whites and yolks, 2 oz. of white pounded sugar, and 2 tablespoonfuls of flour; beat the whole up slowly, fill 6 small cups, and bake them for exactly 20 minutes. Serve with wine sauce. The absence of butter will render these puddings very agreeable to delicate stomachs. Creme d' Orge.—Boil in new milk 4 oz. of French or Scotch barley till perfectly tender, the superfluous part of which throw off; and having added to the barley a pint of cream, 2 eggs beaten, 4 oz. of sugar, the same of butter a little warm, 1 spoonful of rose-water, and a little nutmeg, cover it over for 1 hour, and stir it often. Bake in a buttered dish £ an hour. QUEEN DOWAGER'S PUDDING. 631. —Beat £ lb. of fresh butter, witli the same quantity of loaf-sugar, till it is like cream; then add 6 eggs well beaten, £ lb. of flour, £ lb. of currants, 2 oz. of candied orange or lemon peel cut into very thin slices, and 20 drops of essence of lemon. After the ingredients are all mixed, beat the whole for 10 minutes, then put it into a well-buttered mould, and boil it for 2£ hours. PUDDING FOR THE MAIDS-OF-HONOUR.—E. R- 632. —Boil 1 quart of cream, with a blade of mace, 3 cloves,467 Chav. XXIII.] SWEET PUDDINGS. and -j- a nutmeg grated, and let it stand to cool. Beat 8 eggs,^ but only 3 whites; strain, and mix them with 1 spoonful of the finest flour, ilb. of almonds blanched and beaten fine, with 1 spoonful of orange-flower or rose water. Mix these by de- grees in the cream, and stir all well together. Take a thick cloth, wet and flour it well; pour in the mixture, tie it close, and plunge it into boiling water. Keep it boiling ± an hour very fast. When done, turn it carefully on a dish, strew fine sugar upon it, and serve pudding-sauce round. THE CAMBRIDGE PUDDING. 633. —Beat up 4 eggs with 1 tablespoonful of sug-ar and 1 of flour very smoothly; then add 1 lb. of raisins and 1 lb. of the fat of a cold loin of veal, or of suet, evenly chopped ; butter a mould, put in the pudding, tie it tightly in a cloth, and let it boil 5 hours. THE PRINCE OF PR USSIA'S P UDDING. 634. —Take the yolks of 6 eggs, with 6 oz. of sugar, and the grated rind of a lemon, and beat them to a solid froth. The whites of the eggs to be beaten separately and till quite a snow froth ; add the juice of the lemon, and mix all together. Put it immediately into a deep tin pudding-dish, and bake it 10 or 15 minutes. It rises very high, and should be served directly it is done. Pour round it the following sauce:—Beat up well 4 eggs, 2 oz. of sugar, the juice and grated peel of a lemon; add 2 wineglassfuls of white wine and a little arrack; stir it over the fire till it begins to rise, then pour it round the pudding quite hot. DUTCH PUDDING.—E. R. 635. —Melt 4 lb. of butter in l pint of milk, let it stand till it is lukewarm, then strain it into 1 lb. of flour, add 4 eggs well beaten, and 2 large spoonfuls of yeast; beat the whole very well together, and let it stand for an hour before the fire to rise. Then beat into it 2 spoonfuls of moist sugar and tr lb. of currants ; put it into a dish or tin well buttered, and when baked turn it out before sending to table. This partakes of the character of brioche, and may be varied in many ways.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIII. 468 MADEIRA PUDDING.—E. R. 636. —Have a tin cake-mould, of which the bottom will come out ; butter it, and lay upon it a piece of paste the size of the mould; cover it with preserve of apricots; then lay another piece of paste, and cover this with red preserves, and so on in different layers, with paste between, until the mould is filled. Boil, and serve with brandy-sauce. This is a rich pudding, for which the island of Madeira is very famous. Great care will be necessary in taking it out of the mould; and it will take a long time to boil properly. A GERMAN PUDDING. 637. —Boil until very tender a handful of whole rice in a small quantity of milk, with a large piece of lemon-peel. Let it drain ; then mix with it a dozen of good-sized apples boiled to a pulp as dry as possible: add a glass of white wine, the yolks of 5 eggs, 2 oz. of orange and citron cut thin; make it pretty sweet. Line a mould or basin with a very good paste; beat the 5 whites of the eggs to a very strong froth, and mix with the other ingredients; fill the mould, and bake it of a fine brown colour. A very fine German Pudding.-—Pour \ a pint of boiling milk upon 1 lb. of bread-crumbs ; beat up l lb. of fresh but- ter to a cream; add to it the yolks of 10 eggs well beaten; drain the milk from the bread, and add the bread with | lb. of pounded sugar and the grated peel of a lemon ; whip the whites of the 10 eggs into a solid froth, and add them the last thing: butter a cloth, and put the pudding in, tying it loose, as it will swell out a good deal; plunge it into boiling water; boil 1 hour. Some persons add £ lb. of jar raisins slit and stoned. When turned out stick the surface with sliced almonds, and serve with the following sauce:— Take 1 pint of cream, 1 pint of sweet raisin wine, 4 oz. of sugar rubbed on the peel of a lemon, and let them boil; add the yolks of 6 eggs well beaten and the juice of the lemon ; mix them well; make the sauce quite hot, but do not let it boil again; pour some over the pudding, serving the re- mainder in a sauce-boat. A S TPISS P UDDING. 638. —In many parts of the Continent, as well as throughout469 Chap. XXIII.] SWEET PUDDINGS. Switzerland, it is customary to put layers of crumbs of bread and sliced apples, with sugar between, till the dish be as full as it will hold. Let the crumbs be the uppermost layer; then pour melted butter over it, and bake. BERLIN PUDDING. 639.—Mix 6 oz. of flour in 1 pint of milk, with 2 oz. of sugar and 1 oz. of butter; simmer till it begins to thicken ; beat 5 oz. of butter to a cream ; add a pinch of salt and the peel of a lemon pounded, 6 eggs, the yolks and whites beaten sepa- rately till in a solid froth ; mix all with the thickened milk the instant before it is put into the basin. This pudding may be J boiled, but is better baked. To be eaten with cherry or plum J sauce. POUDING A LA NESSELRODE. (From an eminent Tavern-keeper.) J 640.—For a 2-quart mould boil a sufficient quantity of ches- nuts to produce a quart of meala after being pounded and rubbed through a tammy. Boil f lb. of sugar in 1 pint of water, with a stick of vanilla, until it is reduced one-third. Boil 1 pint of cream, add it to the chesnut-flour, then add the syrup and 12 yolks of eggs beat up ; set it over the fire, stir it until it nearly boils. When cold, put the composition into a freezing- pot ; when it is frozen, add 4 a pint of whipped cream, 3 whites of eggs whipped up strong, a handful of raisins stoned, chopped, and soaked for a day in maraschino, as many currants, 14 cap of chopped candied lemon-peel, and a glass of maras- chino ; stir these ingredients all well together, freeze it again, and put it into the mould. PUDDING OF PRUNES OR FRENCH PLUMS. 641.—Scald 1 lb. of prunes, cover them, and let them swell in hot water till they are soft, then drain them and extract the stones; spread the fruit on a large dish, and dredge them with flour. Take 2 wineglassfuls of good unskimmed milk, and stir it gradually into a smooth batter with a teacupful of fine flour. Beat up 6 eggs very lightly, and stir them by degrees into rather less than 1 quart of milk, alternately with the batter you have just mixed; then add the plums by degrees, and stir the “ The meal should be pressed into the measure. IMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIII. 470 whole together. Tie the pudding in a cloth that has been dipped in boiling water and then dredged with flour; leave room for it to swell, but secure it firmly so that no water can get in. Put it into boiling water, and boil it continually for 2 hours: do not take it out of the pot till the moment before it is wanted ; serve with pudding-sauce. P UMPKIN P UDDING. 642. —Take 1 pint of pumpkin that lias been stewed soft and pressed through a colander; melt in 4 pint of warm milk 4 lb. of butter and the same quantity of sugar, stirring them well together: 1 pint of rich cream will be better than milk and butter. Beat 8 eggs very light, and add them gradually to the other ingredients alternately with the pumpkin; then stir in a wineglass of rose-water and 2 glasses of wine mixed to- gether, a large teaspoonful of powdered mace and cinnamon mixed, and a grated nutmeg. Having stirred the whole very hard, put it into a buttered dish, and bake it f of an hour. ORANGE PUDDING 643. —May be made with 6 ripe oranges, 3 of Seville and 3 of Lisbon, all peeled; the rinds to be beaten in a mortar with 4 lb. each of fresh butter and moist sugar, to which add the yolks of 6 or 8 eggs, and make the whole into a batter with the juice of only the Lisbon oranges: the number of eggs to be regulated by the size of the fruit. Put the materials into a mould, with a paste around but not over it, and bake it for 4 an hour. An exceedingly nice Soiled Orange Pudding.—On 4 lb. of crumbs of bread pour 1 pint of milk; let it boil up ; stir in 2 oz. of butter and 1 oz. of marrow, keeping the pan over the fire until all is incorporated. Let it become cold ; then mix in 2 eggs, 2 oz. of sugar, 2 oz. of orange-marmalade, and 1 spoonful of orange-flower water. Choose a basin that will exactly hold it, and tie it over with a floured cloth very closely. Boil it 14 hour. Or:—Take the rind of 2 oranges, pared very thin or grated ; beat the yolks of 10 eggs; put the orange-peel and 4 lb. of pounded loaf-sugar into the eggs. If there is time let it stand all night, if not, at least 2 or 3 hours ; then add 4 lb.SWEET PUDDINGS. 47 L Chap. XXIII.] of butter. Line a dish with puff-paste, pour in the mixture, and bake lightly. For sauce :•—Melted butter, sugar, a little lemon-juice, and i spoonful of brandy. LEMON PUDDING. 644.—Melt 6 oz. of butter, and pour it over the same quan- tity of powdered loaf-sugar, stirring it well till cold. Then grate the rind of a large lemon, and add it witli 8 eggs well beaten, and the juice of 2 lemons ; stir the whole till it is com- pletely mixed together, and bake the pudding with a paste round the dish. Or:—Take 14 lb. of bread-crumbs, 4 lb. of finely-chopped suet, the rind of 2 lemons grated and the juice of 1, 2 eggs well beaten; mix the whole with 4 lb. of sugar sifted, and boil it 1 of an hour. Or:—Pare 6 lemons finely, and boil the peel till it is ten- der ; then pound it in a mortar, add the juice of 3 lemons, and 4 lb. of butter melted into a little cream, 3 sponge or ratafia cakes, the yolks of 6 eggs and the whites of 3 ; mix all up well together, with sugar to the taste, adding a little nutmeg and brandy. AN APPLE CHARLOTTE.—E. R. 645.—Pare and slice a quantity of apples; cut off the crust of a loaf, and cut slices of bread and butter. Butter the inside of a pie-dish, and place bread and butter all round ; then put in a layer of apples sprinkled with lemon-peel chopped very fine, and a considerable quantity of good brown sugar. Then put on a layer of bread and butter, and another of apples, lemon-peel, and sugar, until the dish is full, squeezing over the juice of lemons, so that every part shall be equally flavoured. Cover up the dish with the crusts of the bread and the peels of the apples, to prevent it from browning or burn- ing: bake it 14 hour; then take off the peels and the crust, and turn it out of the dish. The affove is the most usual mode of making it, but the an- nexed receipt is an improvement, furnished by a cook of high reputation. ’ Charlotte de Pommes.—Take 4 a quartern loaf, cut the crumb in slices 4 inch thick, cut out of it as many pieces with an inch-round cutter as are required. Oil some butter, dipMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIII, 472 the round pieces of bread into it, and then place them in a plain mould in any way you please. Make a little crust with a piece of butter the size of a walnut, worked up stiff with flour and water; roll it out exceedingly thin, and then lay it inside the bread (this is merely to keep the apple from burst- ing the bread). Boil sufficient apples to fill the mould, with a bit of cinnamon and green lemon-peel, add sugar to taste, a little nutmeg, and a small piece of fresh butter; when the apple is rather stiff fill the mould, cover with a piece of bread ; bake for 1 hour. If the bread is cut in long thin strips, and these made to lap one over the other, the lining of paste may be dispensed with. APPLES A LA CREMONE 646.—Form also a beautiful dish. Choose such apples as will look clear when dressed; pare and cut into pieces the form of a brick a sufficient quantity to weigh It lb.; strew over them It lb. of good Lisbon sugar and several long strips of lemon-peel, and cover them close in a bowl. Next day put the apples, piece by piece, into a small preserving-pan, with the sugar, &c., and 2 large spoonfuls of strong cider. Simmer gently ; and as the pieces of apple become clear, take them out. When cold, build a wall with them on a small oval dish, and place the lemon-peel on the top; pour the syrup into the middle. Serve cream to eat with it. The peel of China orange, cut very thin, does as well as lemon; but the rind of Seville orange always gives a higher flavour. Apples a la Suedoise.—Let the apples be pared and cored, but not cut apart, and simmer gently in a thin syrup of sugar and water till tender; drain them, and fill the middles with any rich preserve : place them on a dish in layers raised the shape of a hedge-hog. Have ready a compote of apples made by boiling 3 or 4 lbs., as for marmalade, sweetened and flavoured with lemon, pour this over the apples so as to fill up the space between each ; and to cover them spread over an icing made by the whites of 3 eggs beaten to a froth, with 2 large tablespoonfuls of pounded sugar; make the surface quite even, then sift over it some fine sugar. Blanch and slice lengthwise sufficient almonds to thickly stick over the whole; when done, put the dish into the oven, letting the apples be warmed through and the almond slightly browned. Ihenuin-Chap. XXIII.] 473 SWEET PUDDINGS. ber required must depend upon the size of the dish, but there should be sufficient to give the necessary shape. They may be stirred 2 or 3 sets in the same syrup, which should have ■f lb. of sugar to 1 pint of water. Apples a la Dauphine likewise form a very nice corner dish as thus :—Pare some of the large sort, make a hole at the end and scoop out the greater part of the pulp ; have a rich custard, with which fill up the hollow ; cover the apples with thin paste, ornamenting the tops with strips of it, and bake them in pans. A CHARTREUSE OF APPLES AND RICE. 647. —Boil 6 oz. of rice with a stick of cinnamon in milk until it is thick, stirring in a spoonful of rose-water or orange- flower water. Pare 10 or 12 apples—golden pippins are the best—scoop out the core, and fill up the orifice with rasp- berry-jam. Border a deep dish with paste ; put in the apples, leaving a space between, and fill it up with the rice. Brush the whole over with the yolk of an egg, and sift sugar thickly over it; form a pattern on the top with sweetmeats, and bake it for 1 hour in a quick oven. MIROTON OF APPLES. 648. —Scald the apples, reduce them to a pulp, and pile them high upon the dish in which they are to be served ; boil 1 teaspoonful of grated lemon-peel and 6 or 8 lumps of sugar in a teacupful of water; then add the yolks of 3 eggs and the white of 1, i oz. of butter, 1 spoonful of flour, and 1 of brandy ; nd.x the whole together over the fire, and stir it quite smooth. Pour it upon the apples, then whisk the whites of the other 2 eggs to a froth ; put them over the miroton just as it is going into the oven, and sift some sugar over it. The oven must be slow : it will take 10 or 15 minutes to bake. P03IMES AU BEURRE, OIi BUTTERED APPLES. 649. —Peel the apples and remove the core without cutting them through, taking care not to break them. Cut slices of bread the circumference of the apples, butter a dish, put on the bread, and place an apple on each slice. Fill the hole made by the removal of the core with white sugar, place a piece of butter the size of a walnut on each hole ; put them474 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIII. into a gentle oven, and renew the sugar and butter several times. They will take 20 or 30 minutes. Be very careful not to let the bread burn, or the apples lose their shape. GATEAU BE POMMES. 650. —Boil sufficient apples (flavoured with cinnamon, cloves, and green lemon-peel) to nearly fill a 14-pint pudding- mould. Pass them through a sieve, add sugar to taste, and 2 tablespoonfuls heaped of potato-flour; stir it over the fire, and, when rather stiff, add 5 or 6 eggs; boil in a mould for 1 hour. Serve with a cream-sauce thickened with potato-flour and flavoured with noyeau. POMME MANGE. 651. —Peel and core 1 lb. of apples, and put them with 4 lb. of sugar and 4 pint of water into a stewpan; add the peel of a lemon. Allow it to boil until it becomes quite stiff, and .then put it into a mould. It will be found excellent. FRUIT PUDDINGS. 652. — Cranberry Pudding.—Boil 14 pint of cranberries, cleared of the stalks, in 4 oz. of sugar and water, until they are broken and form a kind of jam. Make up a large ball of it; cover it well with rice washed clean and dry; then round each fold a floured piece of cloth, which tie as for dumplings. Boil them 1 hour; sift sugar over when served, and butter in a boat. Rhubarb Pudding.—Cut small sufficient stalks of rhubarb to weigh about 1 lb. or 14 lb., which put into a clean saucepan with 8 or lOoz. of sugar, the rind of 1 lemon grated, the juice, and 4 a teaspoonful of ground cinnamon. Place the whole on the fire and stir it occasionally at first, but constantly at last, until reduced to a sort of marmalade; take it from the fire, and, if appearance is to be regarded, pass it through a hair sieve into a basin; mix with it about an ounce or two of good sweet butter, or a little good cream. Line rather a flat dish with puff-paste, thin at the bottom but thick on the edge. When the preparation is cold fill the dish as far as the edge, and bake it in a moderate oven until the paste is done. Quince Pudding.—Scald some quinces till they are very tender; pare them, and scrape off all the pulp. Strew over475 FRUIT PUDDINGS. Chap. XXIII.] them ginger, cinnamon, and as much sugar as will make them very sweet. To 1 pint of cream put the yolks of 3 or 4 eggs, and stir into as much of the pulp as will make it of a pro- per thickness. Line a dish, and bake. TV lute pears, plums, apricots, or other fruit, may be done in the same way. An excellent Apricot Pudding.—Have 12 large apricots, give them a scald till they are soft; meantime pour on the grated crumbs of a penny loaf 1 pint of boiling cream ; when half cold, add 4 oz. of sugar, the yolks of 4 beaten eggs, and 1 glass of white wine. Break the apricot-stones, take some or all of the kernels, pound them in a mortar, and mix them with the fruit and other ingredients; put a paste round a dish, and bake the pudding ^ an hour. Baked Apple Pudding.—Pare and quarter 4 large apples ; boil them tender with the rind of a lemon, in so little water that, when done, none may remain ; beat them quite firm in a mortar; add the crumb of a small roll, 4 oz. of butter melted, the yolks of 5 and whites of 3 eggs, juice of £ a lemon, and sugar to taste; beat all together, and lay it in a dish with paste to turn out. Or:—Put the pulp of the apples in the centre of a baking- dish, surround it with custard, and bake it until brown. Or:—Take 4r lb. of the pulp of the sharpest apples you can get; add 6 oz. of pounded loaf-sugar, the same of butter (melted), the grated rind of 1 lemon and the juice, a glass of white wine, a little nutmeg, the yolks of 8 eg'gs and the whites of 4, well beaten. Mix these well together, and bake in a dish lined with paste. Fruit sliced into Batter makes an excellent and economical pudding, and is considered much more digestible than when put into paste. A little of the batter should be put into the dish, and if apples are used they should be pared and carefully cored, then cut into slices, and a little sugar and grated lemon- peel strewed between them, the dish filled three parts full with the remainder of the batter. To make Batter for Fruit Puddings.—Put $ lb. of flour and a saltspoonful of salt into a pan, add very gently 4 pint of milk ; if mixed carelessly the flour will remain in lumps ; beat up the whites of 4 eggs, strain them to the batter, and beat it well with a wooden spoon. The whites should be beaten sepa- rately to a solid froth, and not added till just before the batterMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIII. 476 is used. For fruit the batter should be rather thicker than when plain, to prevent the fruit sinking to the bottom of the dish or basin, as it is equally good baked or boiled. It must be brought to a proper consistency by adding milk. Baked Gooseberry Pudding.—Stew gooseberries in a jar over a hot hearth, or in a saucepan of water, till they will pulp. Take a pint of the juice pressed through a coarse sieve, and beat it with 3 yolks and whites of eggs beaten and strained, with 15 oz. of butter; sweeten it well, and put a crust round the dish. A few crumbs of roll, or 4 oz. of Naples biscuit, should be mixed with the above to give a little consistence. Raspberries and currants may be used instead of goose- berries, and are equally good. Damsons.—Take a few spoonfuls from a quart of milk, and mix into it by degrees 4 spoonfuls of flour, 2 spoonfuls of sifted ginger, a little salt; then add the remainder of the milk and 1 lb. of damsons. Tie it up in a cloth, wetted and well floured, or put it in a basin that will exactly hold it. Boil it 1£ hour, and pour over it melted butter and sugar. TO PREPARE FR ZJIT FOR CHILDREN. 653. —Afar more wholesome way than in Pies or Puddings —is to put apples sliced, or plums, currants, gooseberries, &c., into a stone jar; and sprinkle among them as much Lisbon sugar as necessary. Set the jar in an oven or on a hearth, with a teacupful of water to prevent the fruit' from burning; or put the jar into a saucepan of water till its contents be per- fectly done. Slices of bread or some rice may be put into the jar, to eat with the fruit. CARROT PUDDING. 654. —Boil a large carrot till tender, bruise and mix it with a spoonful of bread-crumbs, 4 yolks and 2 whites of eggs, a pint of cream, a ratafia, a large spoonful of orange- flower water, ^ & nutmeg, 2 oz. of loaf-sugar. Make in a shal- low dish lined with paste, and when it is turned out strew sugar over it. Or :—4 oz.( oForead-crumbs, 4 oz. of suet, 4 oz. of grated / raw carrot, 1 tablespoonful of brandy, beaten up with an egg, and flavoured with cinnamon and nutmeg. Boil 3 hours.

It is good without paste, and may be baked in a 1 Dutch oven. Or :—Boil 1 pint of milk, stir into it as much flour as will thicken it, letting it boil all the time; pour it into plates, and i eat it hot, with cold butter and sugar, or, if butter is objected ' to, a little cold milk and a little nutmeg. PROVINCIAL PUDDINGS. 656. — Wiltshire Pudding.—Three well-beaten eggs, 1 pint of milk, sufficient flour to make a thick batter, a little salt; beat it some minutes, stir in gently a large teacupful of picked i currants and half that quantity of red raspberries ; boil in a ; cloth for 2 hours, turn it out on the dish, and cut in thin slices, t but do not separate them ; put between each butter and brown J sugar. Bath Pudding.—Half a pint of cream, 1 lb. of butter j boiled together, the crumbs of a twopenny loaf, lump sugar j and brandy to your taste, 4 eggs. Bake them in small cups in | of an hour. Chichester Pudding.—To the grated crumbs of a French roll, mixed with the grated rind of i a lemon, add 4 oz. of sifted sugar, the same of butter, the juice of i a lemon, theMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIII. 478 yolks of 4 eggs, the whites of 2, both being previously well beaten; stir it over the fire till it is the thickness of cream; then pour it into an open tart-paste and bake it in a moderate oven. Yorkshire Pudding.—Put 1 pint of boiling milk to the crumb of a penny loaf, 4 eggs, a little salt and flour; put it in a tin and bake it under roast beef or mutton. A Welsh Pudding.—Let 4 lb. of fine butter melt gently, beat with it the yolks of 8 and whites of 4 eggs, mix in 6 oz. of loaf-sugar, and the rind of a lemon grated. Put a paste into a dish for turning out, and pour the above in, and nicely bake it. Gloucester Puddings.—Weigh 3 eggs in the shell; take their weight in flour and butter; take 12 bitter almonds and 5 oz. of pounded sugar; beat all together for 4 an hour, and put the mixture in pudding-cups, filling the cups only half full. Bake them 4 an hour. D UMPLINGS. 657.— Oxford Dumplings.—Of grated bread 2 oz., cur- rants and shred suet 4 oz. each, 2 large spoonfuls of flour, a great deal of grated lemon-peel, a bit of sugar, and a little pimento in fine powder. Mix with 2 eggs and a little milk into 5 dumplings, and fry of a fine yellow brown. Made with flour instead of bread, but half the quantity, they are excellent. Serve with sweet-sauce. Apple Dumplings should be made of 1 large apple quar- tered and cored, then put together, covered with a thin paste, and boiled till the fruit shall be done enough. Or:—The apple is best not cut, but the core scooped out, and the centre filled up witli a piece of butter and sugar, ac- cording to the tartness of the apple. The paste should not be rolled out, but a lump of the proper quantity taken, the apple placed upon it, and the paste carefully pressed round it: bringing it to a point which is easily closed, so as to keep in the juice and butter. They have a pretty effect if boiled in nets instead of cloths. Yeast or Suffolk Dumplings.—Make a very light dough with yeast, as for bread, but with milk instead of water, and put salt. Let it rise an hour before the fire. 20 minutes be- fore you are to serve, have ready a large stewpan of boilingChap. XXIII.] PROVINCIAL PUDDINGS. 479 •water; make the dough into balls the size of a middling- apple, throw them in, and boil 20 minutes. If you doubt when done enough, stick a clean fork into one, and if it come out clear it is done. The way to eat them is, to tear them apart on the top with 2 forks, for they become heavy by their own steam. Eat immediately with meat, or sugar and butter, or salt ; or with melted butter, sweetened, and add a tablespoonful of lemon- juice. Norfolk Dumplings.—With a pint of milk, two well-beaten eerg-s, and a little salt, mix as much flour as will make a thick DU ' ' batter. Drop a spoonful at a time into a stewpan of boiling- water ; a few minutes will do them. Take them up in a sieve to drain, and serve quickly with cold butter ; the water must not cease boiling while they are doing. Dumplings quickly made.—Beat 4 eggs and strain them ; mix 4 oz. of flour very smoothly with a pint of milk; add to it the eggs, strain it again, and flavour the batter with sugar and nutmeg; butter some teacups, fill them three parts full, and put them into an oven: they will take i of an hour, and, if well mixed, will be equal to custard. Or :■—If boiled for ^ an hour in a cloth, the ingredients will make an excellent batter pudding. Another mode.—Shred suet, and mix with grated bread, a few currants, the yolks of 4 eggs and the whites of 2, some grated lemon-peel and ginger: make this into little balls about the size and shape of an egg, with a little flour. Have ready a skillet of boiling water, and throw them in. 20 minutes will boil them; but they will rise to the top when done. Serve with pudding-sauce.R Currant Dumplings.—Take 4 lb. each of flour, bread- crumbs, suet (chopped fine), and currants: mix all together . with a pinch of salt, a tablespoonful of moist sugar, a little grated lemon-peel and nutmeg, with 4 eggs, and sufficient milk to make it a tolerably stiff batter ; wet a cloth and tie the mixture in dumplings about the size of a teacup; boil for an hour, and serve with melted butter sweetened with moist sugar. “ If the currants, lemon-peel, and ginger be omitted, the above is the mode of making suet dumplings to be put into soup.480 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIV. CHAPTER XXIV. CUSTARDS. CREAMS, JELLIES, &c. CUSTARDS. 658. —Custard is always eaten cold, and either poured over fruit tarts, or served up separately in custard-cups, in each of which a macaroon steeped in wine, and laid at the bottom, will be found a good addition. The flavouring may likewise be altered, according to taste, by using a different kind of essence, the name of which it then acquires ; as of lemon, orange, maraschino, vanilla, &c. It is almost needless to say that cream or a portion of it will make it richer than mere milk. It should be recollected that in custard, when made as cream, and eaten as usually called “ raw,” the ivhites of the eggs are never all used; but they may be devoted to many other purposes. The French mode of making it is, to measure the number of cups which are to be filled, and use nearly that quantity of milk or cream, simmering it upon the fire until beginning to boil, then adding about 4 oz. of powdered sugar to each cup, with lemon-peel, bay-leaves, or almond-powder; then take the yolk of an egg to each small cup, beat them up with the milk, fill the cups, place in a bain-marie or vase of boiling water until the custard become firm. Custard Cream :—Boil i pint of new milk with a piece of lemon-peel, 2 peach-leaves, a stick of cinnamon, and 8 lumps of white sugar. Should cream be employed instead of milk, there will be no occasion to strain it. Beat the yolks, say of 4 eggs; strain the milk through coarse muslin, or a hair sieve; then mix tiie eggs and milk very gradually together, and simmer it gently on the fire, stirring it until it thickens,CUSTARDS. 481 Chap. XXIV.] but removing it the moment it begins to boil, or it will curdle. The addition of a glass of brandy beaten up with it materially improves its flavour. Or:—Boil a quart of milk with 6 laurel-leaves and 2 oz. of loaf-sugar : have ready the yolks of 7 eggs and the whites of 3, well beaten ; pour them into a jug, and pour on them the boiling milk, having taken out the leaves ; put the jug into a pan of boiling water, and keep stirring till of sufficient thickness, which will be in a few minutes. A cheap and excellent sort is made by boiling 3 pints of ,j new milk with a bit of lemon-peel, a bit of cinnamon, 2 or 3 bay-leaves, and sweetening it. Meanwhile, rub down smooth a large spoonful of rice-flour into a cup of cold milk, and mix with it 4 yolks of eggs well beaten. Take a basin of the boiling milk, mix it with the cold, and pour that to the boil- ing, stirring it one way till it begins to thicken, and is just going to boil up; then pour it into a pan, stir it some time, add a large spoonful of peach-water, 2 teaspoonfuls of brandy, or a little ratafia.9 Custard Cream of Chocolate is made by grating any quantity of spiced chocolate, moistened by degrees with warm milk, and put into a stewpan, with yolks of eggs, to 1 thicken. Or:—Scrape i lb. of the best chocolate; pour on it a tea- cupful of boiling water, and let it stand by the fire till it has dissolved. Beat 8 eggs very light, omitting the whites of 2. Stir them by degrees into a quart of cream or rich milk, alternately with the melted chocolate and 3 tablespoonfuls of powdered white sugar. Put the mixture into cups and bake ; it 10 minutes. Send them to table cold, with whipped white : of egg heaped on the top of each custard. Coffee Custard.—Boil a pint of milk, and when boiling pour it upon 2 tablespoonfuls of ichole coffee, that you have r just warmed before the fire. Let it stand for an hour, then sweeten it, add 4 yolks of eggs, thicken over the fire, and ' when thick enough strain and fill the glasses. Almond. Custard.—Boil in a pint of milk, or cream, 2 or 1 3 bitter almonds, a stick of cinnamon, and a piece of lemon- ; peel pared thin, with 8 or 10 lumps of sugar; let it simmer * Marbles, boilod in custard, or anything likely to burn, will, if shaken K in the saucepan, prevent it from catching. 2 i «MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIV. 482 to extract the flavour, then strain it and stir it till cold. Beat the yolks of 6 eggs, mix it with the milk, and stir the whole over a slow fire until of a proper thickness, adding 1 oz. of sweet almonds, beaten fine in rose-water. Or :—Blanch and beat 4 oz. of almonds with a spoonful of water; beat a pint of cream with 2 spoonfuls of rose-water, and put them to the yolks of 4 eggs, Avith as much sugar as will make it pretty sweet; then add the almonds: stir it all over a sIoav fire till it is of a proper thickness, but do not boil. Pour it into cups or glasses. Or:—Blanch 2 oz. of sweet and 2 oz. of bitter almonds ; beat them very fine in a mortar, using 2 spoonfuls of orange- flower water or a little milk in the pounding, to prevent their oiling. Whisk up 4 eggs well (8 or 10 yolks may be used instead) with 6 or 8 oz. of powdered loaf-sugar, to which add a pint of milk, or part milk and cream, and the pounded almonds : put the whole into a saucepan on the fire, and stir it constantly from the bottom Avith a whisk until it becomes thick; but remember it must not boil, or it Avill curdle and be spoiled. Take it from the fire, keep stirring it for a few minutes, pour it into a basin, and stir it occasionally with a spoon to prevent a skin forming on the top; then pour it into cups, and grate nutmeg over the tops. For rich Custard.—Boil a pint of milk Avith lemon-peel and cinnamon; mix a pint of cream and the yolks of 8 eggs well beaten ; when the milk tastes of the seasoning, strain it and sweeten it enough for the Avhole; pour it into the cream, stirring it well; then give the custard a simmer till of a proper thickness. Do not let it boil; stir the Avhole time one way. Or :—Boil a pint of cream Avith some mace, cinnamon, and a little lemon-peel: strain it, and when cold add to it the yolks of 4 and whites of 2 eggs, a little orange-flower water, and sugar to your taste. A little nutmeg and 2 spoonfuls of sweet wine may be added, if approved. Mix well, and bake in cups. A still richer sort is made by using cream without any por-_ tion of milk, or other flavouring than a glass or two of any of the highly flavoured liqueurs—either curagao, noyeau, or maraschino, beaten up Avith the yolks only of strictly fresh eggs, from which the “ tread” has been picked out. If theChap. XXIV.] CUSTARDS. 483 liqueurs cannot be got, then simmer lemon or Seville orange peel, cinnamon, with a little nutmeg, brandy, or ratafia, if it can be had. These custards are very delicious, but may be improved by the addition of a few drops of noyeau. Orange Custard.—Boil very tender the rind of i a Seville orange; beat it in a mortar to a paste; put to it a spoonful of the best brandy, the juice of a Seville orange, 4 oz. of lump* sugar, and the yolks of 4 eggs. Beat all together 10 minutes, and pour in by degrees a pint of boiling cream. Keep beating until the mixture is cold ; then put into custard- cups, and set them in a soup-dish of boiling water; let them stand until thick, then put preserved orange-peel, in slices, upon the custard. Serve either hot or cold. Or:—Take the juice of 12 oranges, strain it and sweeten it well with pounded loaf-sugar, stir it ever a slow fire till the sugar is dissolved, taking off the scum as it rises : when nearly cold add the yolks of 12 eggs well beaten, and a pint of cream ; stir it again over the fire till it thickens. Serve it in a glass dish or in custard-cups. Lemon Custard may be made in the same manner, or as follows :—Strain 3 wineglassfuls of lemon-juice through a sieve; beat 9 eggs, yolks and whites, strain them also, and add them to the lemon-juice, with t lb. of powdered loaf-sugar, a glass of white wine, and i a wineglass of water, with a little gTated lemon-peel. Mix all together, and put the ingredients into a saucepan on the fire, stirring it until it becomes thick and of a proper consistence. Or:—Boil the rind of 2 lemons grated and the juice of 1 in a pint of water; add the yolks of 14 eggs beaten to a cream and sweetened ; stir it one way till it thickens. When taken off the fire add 2 spoonfuls of brandy. CREAMS. In the common acceptation of the word, cream only means the skimmings of raw milk, or, when warmed, is called “ cloutedbut the term is here applied to dishes in which cream is the chief ingredient, and which are usually called by the name of the flavouring materials. 2 i 2MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIY. 484 CHAMPAGNE CREAM 659. —Is made by beating up the yolks of 6 eggs with as much powdered sugar as will make it quite stiff—so much so as nearly to make the spoon stand in it. Then pour on it very gradually—stirring it all the time—a bottle of sparkling cham- pagne : grate on it a little nutmeg, and serve it to the ladies, who seldom refuse a second glass. A bottle of good cider or perry will be a tolerable substi- tute. Leclie Crema.—Beat up 3 eggs, leaving out 2 of the whites, and add to them gradually 1 4 pint of milk; then mix very carefully 4 tablespoonfuls of fine wheat-flour and 2 oz. of finely powdered loaf-sugar, with grated lemon-peel to give a flavour. Boil these ingredients over a slow fire, stirring constantly to prevent burning, until the flour is quite dissolved. Prepare a shallow dish witli some ratafia cakes at the bottom, and when the “ crema ” is sufficiently boiled, pour it through a sieve upon the cakes.a A VERY FINE ITALIAN CREAM. 660. —Whip together for nearly an hour a quart of very thick scalded cream, a quart of raw cream, the grated rind of 4 lemons and the strained juice, with 10 oz. of white powdered sugar; then add i pint of sweet wine, and continue to whisk it until it becomes quite solid. Lay a piece of muslin in a sieve, and lade the cream upon it with a spoon. In 20 hours turn it carefully out, but mind that it does not break. Garnish it with fruit-jelly or with flowers. Another.-—Whip up 1 pint of very ricli cream to a strong froth, with some finely scraped lemon-peel, a squeeze of the juice, I a glass of sweet wine, and sugar to make it pleasant, but not too sweet; lay it on a sieve or in a form, and next day put it on a dish, and ornament it with very light puff-paste biscuits, made in tin shapes the length of a finger, and about 2 thick, over which sugar may be strewed, or a little glazed with isinglass. Or you may use macaroons to line the edges of the dish. a Some finely powdered cinnamon should be dusted pretty thickly over it. This delicious dish is always served up cold. The receipt was obtained from the nuns of Santa Clara convent at Palmas, in the island of Grand Canary.CREAMS. Chap. XXIV.] 485 CREME A LA VANILLE. 661. —Boil 1 oz. of isinglass in a pint of milk for 10 minutes, taking care it does not stick to the bottom of the stewpan. Put into it ^ a stick of vanilla ; cover it down, and let it stand till nearly cold. Beat up the yolks of 5 eggs, mix into them 6 oz. of pounded sugar, put these into a stewpan ; take the vanilla out of the milk, which add to the eggs, mix them well, and stir the custard over the fire till it thickens, but do not let it boil.

Then add a pint of cream, strain the isinglass and wine, stir the whole well together, and put it into the moulds. It re- quires no boiling after the cream is added, the isinglass, wine, and sugar having been previously boiled together. Be careful not to mix the wine and cream together until quite cold. Half the above materials ought to fill a mould. Chocolate Cream.—Scrape into 1 quart of thick cream 1 oz. of the best chocolate and i lb. of sugar; boil and mill it; when quite smooth take it off, and leave it to be cold ; then add the whites of 9 eggs.

When cold pour a rich custard over it, about 2 inches deep; whip the whites of the eggs, of which the custard was made, to a snow, and lay it in small rough pieces on the custard; sift fine sugar over, and put it into a slack oven for a short time.

When cold, turn them oiit, and put them into the dish in which they are to be served; pour round them a custard made of the yolks of the eggs and little more than 7 pint of milk. Put on the top a little red currant jelly or raspberry jam. A pretty supper dish. ICE CREAMS\ 677. —To 1 lb. of preserved fruit of any kind add a quart of cream, the juice of 2 lemons to heighten the flavour, and sugar to your taste. Rub the whole through a fine hair sieve ; and to raspberry, or any other red fruit, add a little cochineal colouring, to give a better tint. TO PREPARE ICE FOR ICING. 678. —Get a few pounds of ice; a pailful is necessary to freeze a quart of cream; break it almost to powder, throw 3 or 4 large handfuls of rock-salt among it. You must pre- pare it in a part of the house where as little of the warm air comes as you can possibly contrive. The ice and salt being in a bucket, put your cream into an icepot, and cover it; immerse it in the ice till quite cold, then twist the pot rapidly round. In a few minutes put a spoon in and stir it well, re- moving the parts that ice round the edges to the centre. If the ice cream or water be in a form, shut the bottom close, and move the whole in the ice, as you cannot use a spoon to that without danger of waste. There should be 1 in the bucket, to let off the water as the ice thaws. Freezing powders for generating ice are now also much in use, and can be procured of the patentees, King and Keith, Princes-street, Leicester-square." Ratafia Cream Ice.—Blanch l oz. of bitter almonds, and beat them with a teaspoonful of water in a marble mortar; then rub with the paste 2 oz. of lump-sugar, and simmer 10 minutes with a teacupful of cream, which add to a quart more of cream, and, having strained, ice it. a When any fluid tends towards cold, moving it quickly accelerates the cold; and likewise, when any fluid is tending to htat, stirring it will facilitate its boiling.493 CREAMS, &c. Chap. XXIV.] Brown Bread Ice.—Grate as fine as possible stale brown bread, soak a small proportion in cream 2 or 3 hours, sweeten, and ice it; but keep stirring, that the bread may not sink. Vanilla Cream, if iced, is made with a decoction or essence of that spice mixed with the cream. Iced Custard is also very good. Almond Cream Ice.—Take 6 oz. of bitter almonds (sweet ones will not do), blanch them, and pound them in a mortar, adding by degrees a little rose-water. Boil them gently in a pint of cream till you find that it is highly flavoured with them. Then pour the cream into a bowl, stir in 4 lb. of pow- dered loaf-sugar, cover it, and set it away to cool gradually. When it is cold, strain it, and then stir it gradually and hard into 3 pints of cream. Put it into the freezer, and proceed as directed. Freeze it twice. It will be found very fine. Send round always with ice-cream sponge-cake : afterwards wine and cordials, or liqueurs, as they are now generally called. WATER ICES 679. —Are made with the juice of lemon, currant, or rasp- berry, or any other sort of fruit, being gained by squeezing, sweetened, and mixed with water. Bub some fine sugar on lemon or orange, to give the colour and flavour, then squeeze the juice of either on its respective peel ; add water and sugar to make a fine sherbet, and strain it before it be put into the icepot. If orange, the greater proportion should be of the China juice, and only a little of Seville, and a small bit of the peel grated by the sugar. To make Ice Punch, as used in Italy.—Mix a rich sherbet, and grate a piece of sugar on a lemon or citron for flavour; then beat the whites of 5 or 6 eggs to a froth, and by degrees stir it into the sherbet: add rum, ice it, and serve in glasses. TRIFLE.—E. R. 680. —Place at the bottom of the trifle-dish a layer of maca- roons and ratafia-cakes, and pour over them as much sweet wine or brandy as they will absorb. Squeeze the juice of a lemon, and add it to a quart of cream not too thick; sweeten the cream with sugar rubbed upon the rind ; add a little brandy and the white of an egg beaten to a froth. Whisk the mixture, and as the froth rises lay it on a sieve to drain •494 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIY. when enough has been drained for the purpose, make a cus- tard with the remaining cream and that which has drained from the froth ; put it on a very slow fire with two laurel- leaves, and when nearly boiling take it off, and add the yolks of 4 eggs and the whites of 2—the number necessary for a pint of custard. Put it again on the fire, stirring slowly one way till it thickens, but taking care not to allow it to come to a boil. Cover the macaroons with raspberry or other jam, then pour on the custard ; and when the custard is quite cold put on the froth, sprinkling harlequin comfits on the top, and garnishing with different-coloured sweetmeats. In some of the good old-fashioned receipts for trifle, a layer of calf’s-foot jelly is added to the others. Modern trifles are often trifles indeed, merely consisting of a few cakes and a little froth. TIPSY CAKE. 681. —-Take a savoy cake ; stick almonds, cut in fillets, regularly in it; pour equal quantities of wine and brandy over, as much as it will imbibe ; smother it with a rich thick custard; lay preserves at the bottom of the dish. FLOATING ISLAND. 682. —Mix 3 half-pints of thin cream with f pint of raisin wine, a little lemon-juice, orange-flower water, and sugar; put into a dish for the middle of the table, and put on the cream a froth, which may be made of raspberry or currant jelly. Another way.—Scald a codling before it be ripe, or any sharp apple ; pulp it through a sieve. Beat the whites of 2 eggs with sugar and a spoonful of orange-flower water; mix in by degrees the pulp, and beat together until you have a large quantity of froth; serve it on raspberry cream or put it on a custard. BLANCMANGE.—E. R. g83. Boil 1 oz. of isinglass, 3 oz. of sweet and 6 bitter almonds, well pounded in a quart of milk ; let it boil until the isinglass is dissolved ; then sweeten it, stir it until nearly cold, and put it into the mould. j Or :—To a pint of new milk and as much cream, add 1* oz. of the best isinglass, a large handful of sweet and bitter almondsChap. XXIV.] 495 CREAMS, &c. pounded in a mortar and moistened with water, 3 oz. of fine sugar, and 2 bay or peach leaves. Boil the whole until the isinglass is dissolved, then strain it into a basin, let it stand until it is cold, turn it out and take off the sediment, warm it up again, flavour it with a little orange-flower water, stir it until it is nearly cold, and then put it into the mould. Observe to wash the isinglass in cold water before it is put to the milk, and soak the moulds in cold water some hours before they are used. American Blancmange.—Mix 2 oz. of arrowroot in 4 pint of cold water ; let it settle for i of an hour ; pour off the water and add a tablespoonful of orange or rose water ; sweeten 1 quart of new milk : boil it with a bit of cinnamon, half the peel of a lemon, and 4 laurel or bay leaves; pour the boiling milk upon the arrowroot, stirring it all the time : put it into a mould and turn it out the following day. WHOLE RICE IN A SHAPE. 684. —Wash a large teacupful of rice in several waters ; put it into a stewpan with cold water to cover it; when it boils add 2 cupfuls of rich milk or thin cream, boil it till the rice is soft; put it into a mould and press it down tight: when cold turn it out and serve with sweetmeat or jelly round it. If put into a cylindrical mould, the centre should be filled with fruit or sweetmeat. G 0 OSEBERR Y-FO O L. 685. —Put the fruit into a stone jar, with some good Lisbon sugar ; set the jar on a stove, or in a saucepan of water over the fire ; if the former, a large spoonful of water should be added to the fruit. When it is done enough to pulp, press it through a colander ; have ready a teacupful of new milk and the same quantity of raw cream boiled together, and left to be cold ; then sweeten pretty well with fine Lisbon sugar, and mix the pulp by degrees with it. Or :—Mix equal proportions of gooseberry pulp and custard. For Orange-fool.—Mix the juice of 3 Seville oranges, 3496 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIV. well beaten, a pint of cream, a little nutmeg' and cinna- mon, and sweeten to your taste. Set the whole over a slow tire, and stir it till it becomes as thick as good melted butter, but it must not be boiled ; then pour it into a dish for eatin°" cold. ° For Applefiool.—Stew apples as directed for gooseberries, and then peel and pulp them. Prepare the milk, &c., and mix as before. NORMANDY PIPPINS. 666.—These form a very convenient second-course dish when there is custard at table, it being particularly suited to the flavour. They are to be obtained at all the grocers’, and should be soaked in cold water for about 12 hours. To every lb. of apples put a quart of water and i lb. of moist sugar, with about a dozen cloves; let them simmer till quite tender; when cold lay them in a dish, and lay thin strips of lemon-peel over the tops, and pour over them as much of the syrup as the dish will hold. SYLLABUBS.—E. R. 687.—Solid Syllabub.— Grate off the peel of a lemon with lump-sugar, and dissolve the sugar in f pint of wine: add the juice of ■§• a lemon and i pint of cream ; whisk the whole together until of a proper thickness, and then put it into glasses. London Syllabub.—Put 1^ pint of port or white wine into a bowl, nutmeg grated, and a good deal of sugar, then pour into it near 2 quarts of hot milk, frothed up. If the wine be not rather sharp, it will require more for this quantity of milk. Staffordshire Syllabub.—Put a pint of cider, and a glass of brandy, sugar, and nutmeg, into a bowl, and milk into it; or pour warm milk from a large teapot some height into it. A very fine Somersetshire and Devonshire Syllabub.—In a large china bowl put a pint of port, and a pint of sherry or other white wine; sugar to taste. Milk the bowl full. In 20 minutes’ time cover it pretty high with clouted cream; grate over it nutmeg, put pounded cinnamon and nonpareil comfits. Everlasting Syllabubs.—Mix a quart of thick raw cream, 1 lb. of refined sugar, 1£ pint of fine raisin wine, in a deep497 CREAMS, &c. Chap.

Put it in glasses, sprinkle a few harlequin sugarplums on the top. It will keep good, in a cool place, a fortnight. DEVONSHIRE JUNKET. 688.—Put warm milk into a bowl; turn it with rennet ; then put some scalded cream, sugar, and cinnamon on the top, without breaking the curd; which put into a close net* and hang it up, both to allow the milk to drain from it, and to make it into a pretty shape. Or:—Put some new milk into a china or other basin, or else warm some cold milk to the same heat as new, add to it a little calf’s rennet, and, if approved, a little brandy or rum may also be added ; stir it with a spoon so as to mix the whole perfectly. Place it near the fire or on a warm stove or hearth until turned, but it must not be kept too hot, or it will not turn properly. When turned, put sugar, grated nutmeg, or nutmeg and ground cinnamon on the top, and scalded or clouted cream, without breaking the curd, and serve. ITALIAN CHEESE.—E. R. 689. —14 pint of cream, 2 lemons and the rind, a pint of sweet wine, a few pounded almonds, and sugar enough to sweeten it. Mill for about 10 minutes; put all into a deep i sieve with a muslin under it to drain. Or:—The juice of 1 lemon and the grated rind of 2 to a quart of cream; add sugar, keep stirring it one way until it is quite thick. FLUMMERY. 690. —Put 3 large handfuls of very small white oatmeal to steep a day and night in cold water; then pour it off clear, and add as much more water, and let it stand the same time. Strain it through a fine hair sieve, and boil it till it be as thick as hasty pudding, stirring it well all the time. When first strained, put to it 1 large spoonful of white sugar and 2 of orange-flower water. Pour it into shallow dishes, and serve to eat with wine, cider, milk, or cream and sugar. It is very good. French Flummery.—Boil slowly 2 oz. of isinglass shavings in a quart of cream 15 minutes. Stir all the time, and sweeten 2 K498 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIV. it with loaf-sugar, not pounded, lest any dust should be in it; add a spoonful of rose-water and the same of orange-flower water. Strain it into a basin or form, and serve with baked pears round it. Rice Flummery.—Boil with a pint of new milk a bit of lemon-peel and cinnamon; mix with a little cold milk as much rice-flour as will make the whole of a good consistence ; sweeten, and add a spoonful of peach-water or a bitter almond beaten ; boil it, taking care it does not burn; pour it into a shape or pint basin, taking out the spice. When cold, turn the flummery into a dish, and serve with cream, milk, or custard, round. An excellent Flummery.—Take 1 pair of calf’s feet, boil them in 3 quarts of water till reduced to 1 pint; when cold take off’ the fat very carefully; boil it with a laurel-leaf, add £ pint of cream with a tablespoonful of orange-flower water. Beat it up till it is as thick as cream ; pour it into cups pre- viously laid in cold water, or into a mould. As to the chemical compounds so generally advertised for the making of jellies, custards, and blancmange, they are worthless in comparison with the animal substance of meat, eggs, and milk, of which such delicacies ought to be formed; they are not cheaper nor so nutritive, neither do we know of what they are composed. • JELLIES, 691.—It is a complaint amongst even experienced house- keepers that they cannot feel a certainty of having jelly clear; but by strictly attending to the following method for making calf’s-foot jelly, they can scarcely fail to have it beautifully bright. Feet for all jellies are boil0(1 so long by the people who sell them that they are less nutritious: they should be pro- cured from the butcher and only scalded to take off the hair. The liquor will require greater care in removing the fat; but the jelly will be far stronger. A little isinglass, t oz. to a quart of stock, may be used to secure the firmness, particularly in summer. In peeling lemons, care should be taken not to cut below the colour, as by so doing a great dealJELLIES. 499 Chap. XXIV.] of the flavour of the essential oil is lost, and the white part elves a disagreeable flavour. The stock should be measured when set to get cold, as the exact quantity cannot be measured when it is set. Jelly is equally good made of cow-heels nicely cleaned ; and they bear a less price than those of calves, and make a stronger jelly. CALF'S-FOOT JELLY. 692.—Boil 2 feet in 2 quarts and a pint of water till the feet are broken and the water half wasted ; strain it, and the following day take off the fat, and remove the jelly from the sediment; then put it into a saucepan, with a laurel-leaf, 20 coriander-seeds, the peel of 2 lemons, sugar to palate, 4 pint of sherry, and a wineglass of brandy. When the flavour is rich, put to it the whites of 5 eggs well beaten, and their shells broken. The whole of the ingredients should be cold when mixed together, to ensure the jelly being clear. Set the saucepan on the fire, but do not stir the jelly after it gets hot. Let it boil 20 minutes after it rises to a head ; then pour it through a flannel jelly-bag, first dipping the bag in hot water to prevent waste, and squeezing it quite dry. Run the jelly through and through until clear; then put it into glasses or moulds. After all the jelly has run through the bag, pour boiling water into the bag from 1 to 3 half-pints, according to the quantity of the jelly that has been made. This will niake an exceedingly pleasant beverage, particularly in hot weather. , The following mode will greatly facilitate the clearing of jelly:—When the mixture has boiled 20 minutes, throw in a teacupful of cold water ; let it boil 5 minutes longer ; then take the saucepan off the fire, covered close, and let it stand 4 an hour ; after which it will be so clear as to need only once running through the bag, and much waste will be saved. Or:—Boil 4 quarts of water, with 3 calf’s-feet, or 2 cow- heels, that have been only scalded, till half wasted : take the jelly from the fat and sediment ; mix with it the juice of a Seville orange and 12 lemons, the peels of 3 ditto, the whites and shells of 12 eggs, white sugar to taste, a pint of wine, 1 oz. of coriander-seeds, 2 bay-leaves, a bit of cinnamon, and 6 cloves, all bruised, after having previously mixed them cold. The jelly should boil 15 minutes without stirring; then clear it through a flannel bag. While running, take a little jelly, 2 k 2MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIV. 500 and mix with a teacupful of water in which a bit of beet-root lias been boiled, and run it through the bag when all the rest is run out; this is to garnish the other jelly, being cooled on a plate : but this is matter of choice. This jelly has a very fine high colour and flavour. Another.—Boil a cow-heel in 2 quarts of water for 7 or 8 hours : take every particle of fat and sediment from the jelly ; when cold put to it a pint of raisin wine, the juice* of 3 lemons and the rind of 2 pared very thin, about 6 oz. of sugar, the whites and shells of 3 eggs well beaten, and \ oz. of isinglass. Boil it 20 minutes, then add a teacupful of cold water; let it boil 5 minutes longer, then cover it up close and let it stand off' the fire x an hour; pour it through a jelly-bag until clear, put it into a mould, and set it on ice. Orange Jelly.—To a pint of calf’s-foot stock put a pint of strained China orange-juice mixed with that of 1 or 2 lemons; add 6 oz. of sugar, the rinds of 3 oranges and 1 lemon pared very thin, the whites and shells of 3 eggs; mix these well together. When it boils, let it simmer x an hour; take it off the fire, cover up close, and let it stand 20 minutes, then pour it through a bag till clear. In all jellies it is to be under- stood the process of clearing should be the same as for calf’s- foot, already given. Lemon Jelly.—Take a quart of calf’s-foot stock, add f pint of lemon-juice, f lb. of loaf-sugar, the rind of 2 lemons pared very thin, the whites and shells of 5 eggs; boil and clarify as already stated. The colour should be bright. For variety, any rich white liqueur might be added, taking away an equal quantity of lemon-juice. It should be borne in mind that lemon-peel cut thick does not impart nearly so much flavour as the same quantity cut very thin. Apple Jelly.—Pour a quart of prepared apple-juice on 1 lb. of fresh apples pared and cored; simmer them until they are well broken ; strain the juice, and let it stand until cold. Put lx pint into a stewpan with a quart of calf’s-foot stock, 9 oz. of sugar broken small, the rind and juice of 2 lemons, with the whites and shells of 8 eggs. Let it boil for about f of an hour; strain it through a jelly-bag, and when cool put it into moulds. Good baking apples should be used, and the quantity of the sugar must vary according to the tart- ness of the fruit.Chap. XXIV.] JELLIES. 501 Fruit in Jelly.—Prepare a calf’s-foot jelly ; before putting it into the mould pick, wash, and drain on a cloth some fine pine strawberries, some large white raspberries, and bunches of red and white currants. Lay at the bottom of the mould a large bunch of white currants surrounded with pine strawber- ries ; on these a layer of white raspberries and red currants. Cover them entirely with jelly ; when quite firm arrange another layer of fruit, and so on till the mould is filled. Just before wanted dip the mould into warm water for a moment, wipe it, and turn the jelly out. The fruits may be varied according to the season. Preserved fruits may be used, but the colour will not be so fine as fresh fruit. TO CLARIFY ISINGLASS. 693.—Take 2 oz. of isinglass, pour on it a pint of spring water which has been mixed with a teaspoonful of beaten white of egg and a tablespoonful of lemon-juice. Stir them thoroughly together, and let them heat slowly, taking care the isinglass does not stick to the bottom of the pan; simmer a few minutes, clear off the scum till no more appears; strain it through muslin, and set it by for use : it will be trans- parent, and may be warmed and mixed with the clear juice of any kind of fruit already sweetened, or with syrup in jellies flavoured with liqueur. As a portion of the isinglass is taken up by the white of egg, f to each oz. should be allowed for this. The finest sort of isinglass, which should be white and without any smell, does not require to be clarified, excepting for clear jellies; for all other purposes it is enough to dis- solve and skim it, and to pass it through a strainer. A great variety of excellent jellies may be made with clarified isinglass and the juice or syrup of almost any kind of fresh fruit, the colour of which is best preserved by mashing it lightly and strewing pounded sugar over it, letting it stand 3 or 4 hours for the juice to drain off; pour a little water over, and use the juice without boiling. This can only be done when fruit is plentiful, as it requires double the quantity. It is also a great improvement to these jellies to put the moulds into ice 3 or 4MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XX1Y. 502 hours before they are served. It will not be necessary to give more than a few receipts, as the process is the same in all. ISINGLASS JELLIES. 694.—Strawberry Jelly.—If the fruit is not very abundant, boil i lb. of loaf-sugar in a pint of water for 20 minutes ; jjour this boiling hot over a quart of picked scarlet strawberries : let them stand all night. Clarify 24 oz. of isinglass in a pint of water; drain the syrup from the strawberries, adding a tea- cupful of red-currant juice and the juice of a lemon. When the isinglass is nearly cold, mix all together; add more sugar if wanted, then put it into moulds. The juice extracted from the fruit by laying sugar upon it gives the jelly a finer flavour than pouring boiling water upon it. Put the moulds into an earthen pan, and cover them with ice broken small. Strawberry and raspberry jelly, when no currants are added, should have the flavour heightened by a little lemon-juice. Orange Jelly.—Boil 14 oz. of isinglass in a pint of water with the peel of 4 a lemon; squeeze the juice of 8 China and 4 Seville oranges through a sieve ; add to it the isinglass strained, and 6 oz. of pounded sugar. Set it on the fire, stir it well till it almost boils ; when nearly cold, put it into earthen- ware moulds which have lain in cold water for 2 or 3 hours. Lemon Jelly.—Clarify 14 oz. of isinglass in a pint of water; add 4 lb. of loaf-sugar, and the rind of 2 lemons cut very thin. Squeeze the juice of 4 lemons; strain it through blotting or filtering paper, then stir it into the cool sugar and isinglass: take out the peel, and pour it into cups or forms, and place them in ice. Currant and Raspberry Jelly.—Take 3 lbs. of ripe cur- rants, of which let one-third be white, and a few red raspberries to give it flavour ; break them with a silver fork ; put them into a jar, which put into a saucepan of boiling water, so as to draw the juice : boil 2 oz. of isinglass in % pint of water, to which add 1 lb. of loaf-sugar ; when cool, strain the fruit, and add an equal quantity of the juice; mix well together, and put it into a mould, and place it in ice to freeze. Italian Jelly is made by half filling the mould, and, when the jelly is set, laying round upon it a wreath of stilt blanc- mange, cut of equal size with a small round cutter: then hi up the mould with jelly nearly cold. Hartshorn Jelly.—Simmer 8 oz. of hartshorn shavings with 2 quarts of water to 1 ; strain it and boil it with the rinds oChap.

Cranberry Jelly.—Make a very strong isinglass jelly. "When cold, mix it with a double quantity of cranberry-juice. \ Sweeten and boil it up ; then strain it into a shape. The sugar must be good loaf, or the jelly will not be clear. Cranberry and Rice Jelly.—Boil and press the fruit, strain the juice, and by degrees mix into it as much ground rice as will, when boiled, thicken to a jelly; boil it gently, stirring it, and sweeten it to your taste. Put it in a basin or form, and serve with cream. JELL Y MO ULDS. 695.—The shape of the moulds used for jellies and creams is a matter of importance in the appearance of the entremets of a handsome dinner. They should be high and nearly of the same size. If jelly or cream sinks Hat on the dish, it has a poor and shabby appearance. The variety now to be got at all the large ironmongers’ shops is very great, some of them very elegant. The cylindrical mould shows the transparency Cylindrical Mould.

Also one for jellies of mixed colours, which is very pretty. These are filled with the jelly, coloured, and each layer allowed to get cold before the next is added. A little cochineal or sliced beet- root, with a few drops of lemon-juice, makes a beautiful red ; spinach-juice, boiled with a small quantity of water to take off the rawness, makes a dark green.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXY. 504 CHAPTER XXY. CONFECTIONARY. 696.—Stove.—In storerooms, or where there is not a char- coal stove for the purpose of preserving, the small portable french stove is found very convenient. A tin, with the sides a little turned up, should be placed under it; and there should be a free ventilation of air, as the best fuel for it is charcoal. It is lighted in the same way as a charcoal stove, by putting upon the bars a piece of charcoal already ignited ; and may be put out by fixing the lid closely down. The French call it un Foarjieau Economique. The original price is only Stove for Preserving. a few shillings. TO CLARIFY AND BOIL SUGAR. 697.—The boiling of sugar more or less constitutes the chief art of the confectioner. Those who are not practised in this knowledge, and only preserve, in a plain way, for family use, are not aware that in 2 or 3 minutes a syrup over the fire will pass from one gradation to another, called by the confectioners “ degrees of boiling,” of which there are 6, and those sub- divided. Such minutiae cannot, however, be attended to by pri- vate parties ; and the observation is only made to guard against both underboiling, which prevents preserves from keeping, and too quick and long boiling, which brings them to a candy. The finest sugar should be used in confectionary, as it requires less clarifying, and consequently less is wasted, as the coarser sorts lose much in that process. Break the sugarChap. XXV.] 505 CLARIFIED SUGAR. into large lumps, and put it into a preserving-pan. If for syrup, add a pint of cold water to each pound ; if for candy- ing, a couple of wineglassfuls to the pound will be sufficient. Beat the white of an egg, add it to the water, mix it well, and pour it over the sugar; 1 egg is enough for 12 lbs. of sugar if it is fine, or 2 if it is coarse. When the sugar is nearly melted, stir it well, and put it over a gentle fire; do not stir it after the scum begins to rise; let it boil 5 minutes, then take it off the fire, let it stand a minute or two, then take the scum carefully off; put the pan again on the fire, and when the syrup begins to boil throw in a little cold water, which should be kept back for the purpose; boil till the scum rises, draw it off the fire, and skim it as before; repeat this till quite clear; it is then fit for use. It is by long boiling that the different degrees are acquired which the confectioner requires. When it is fit for candying, it may be drawn out into threads by taking a little between the thumb and finger; but for barley-sugar or caramel, the way to prove it is by dropping a little into cold water ; if it snap between the teeth without sticking to them, it should then be instantly taken off the fire. If for barley-sugar, a few drops of essence of lemon should be added, then pour it upon a broad dish, and when the edges begin to harden roll it up into sticks. If for caramel, or spun sugar, oil a mould and draw out the sugar in threads over it, let it cool, then place it over the fruit or tart it is in- tended to cover. The various degrees in sugar-boiling, if re- quired to a nicety, may best be ascertained by means of a very simple saccharometer, to be had at any instrument-maker’s, consisting of a tin tube, into which, when nearly filled with the syrup, a small graduated rod, having a weight at the lower end to hold it in a perpendicular position, is inserted ; and according to the degree it marks on the surface of the syrup, the stage is denominated as in the following table Petit lisse, at. . . .29 degrees.

XXV. 506 OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVING. 698.—Attention, with practice, will enable a person to make any of the following sorts of preserves, &c., and they are as much as is wanted in a private family. The higher articles of preserved fruits may be bought at less expense than they can be made. Preserves should be kept carefully from the air, and in a very dry place. Unless they have a very small proportion of sugar, a warm one does not hurt; but when not properly boiled (that is, long enough, but not quickly), heat makes them ferment, and damp causes them to grow mouldy. They should be looked at 2 or 3 times in the first 2 months, that they may be gently boiled again if not likely to keep. Paste the edge of the outer paper, as it keeps out the air better than a string; put plain writing-paper over the fruit; brandy will give them a tendency to ferment. Dried sweetmeats, cakes, &c., should be kept in tin boxes, between layers of white paper, in a very dry but not hot room. When any sweetmeats are directed to be dried in the sun or in a stove, it will be best, in private families, where there is not a regular stove for the purpose, to put them in the sun on flag-stones, which reflect the heat, and place a garden glass over them to keep insects off; or if put into an oven, take care not to let it be too warm, and watch that they do properly and slowly. All fruits for preserving should be gathered in dry weather; but as this is not always practicable, much inconvenience may be obviated by boiling the fruit for jellies and jams long- before the sugar is added. By so doing, the watery particles will evaporate, and the preserve will be better flavoured, by the sugar not being too long on the fire. The common sort of preserves are cheaper, if not better, when made in the house than when purchased from the con- fectioner ; with this observation, that if there be children in the family, the plan will then probably be found anything but economical. Pans of copper or bell-metal are the proper utensils for pre- serving fruit: when used, they must be scoured bright with sand. Tinned pans turn and destroy the colour of the fruit that is put into them. There is now a new sort of stewpan toCAXDIED FRUITS. Chap. XXV.] 507 be got at most of the large ironmongers’: it is of iron, coated with earthenware. Omelette-pans should be of the same ma- terial. Sieves and horn spoons should be kept for sweet things only. TO CANDY.—E. R. 699.—Almonds.—Blanch any quantity of almonds, then fry them in butter till they are of a light-brown colour; wipe them nicely with a napkin, and put them into a pan. Make a syrup of white sugar, and boil it to a thread—that is, until on your taking a drop of the sugar between the finger and thumb it will produce a thread ; care must be taken to boil it to the exact candying-point; pour it boiling hot upon the almonds, and stir them till they are quite cold. This is an excellent method of preparing almonds for dessert, and much approved of in London by the guests of his highness the Nawaub of Oude, from whose cook it has been obtained. Bon-bons.—Clear oft’ the sugar from fresh candied citron or orange rind, cut it into squares 1 inch thick, stick them singly on a bit of thin wire, and dip them into liquid barley-sugar; rub a dish with a few drops of pure salad oil, and lay the fruit upon this to cool. They should be kept in tin canisters in a very dry place. Toffie.—Melt in a stewpan 3 oz. of fresh butter, add 1 lb. of good moist sugar, stir it well over a gentle fire, and let it Jjoil about i of an hour, or till it cracks short between the teeth like barley-sugar; then pour it upon buttered dishes, and when nearly^cold mark it across in squares that it may easily divide, or roll it into sticks. When half-boiled, the grated rind of a lemon or a teaspoonful of ground ginger may be added. A few sliced almonds may be added after it is poured upon the dishes. To candy any sort of Fruit.—When finished in the syrup, put a layer into a new sieve, and dip it suddenly into hot water, to take off the syrup that hangs about it; put it on a napkin before the fire to drain, and then do some more in the sieve. Have ready sifted double-refined sugar, which sift over the fruit on all sides till quite white; set it on the shallow end of sieves in a lightly warm oven, and turn it 2 or 3 times It must not be cold till dry. Watch it carefully, and it will be beautiful..508 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXV. TO GREEN FRUITS FOR PRESERVING OR PICKLING. 700. —Take pippins, apricots, pears, plums, peaches, while green, for the first, or radish-pods, French beans for the latter, and cucumbers for both processes, and put them, with vine- leaves under and over, into a preserving-pan with spring water to cover them, and close the pan to exclude all air. Set it on the side of a fire, and when they begin to simmer take them off; take them out carefully with a slice; the next day put them again on the fire. They are to be peeled, and then done according to the receipts for the several modes. BOTTLED FRUIT.—E. R. 701. —The best way of preserving all fruit for tarts is by bottling ; and if the following directions be exactly observed, it will be found to answer admirably:—Gather any kind of fruit on a dry day—currants, gooseberries, plums, &c.; put it into wide-mouthed bottles ; it should not be fully ripe. Mix currants and raspberries in the same bottle, and put 2 oz. of sugar into each; then have bladders cut so large, that when they are tied over the bottles they will hang an inch all round below the string. Let the bladders be wet, and tied tightly; then put the bottles up to their necks into a copper of cold water, with some straw between.* Light a fire under the copper, and, when the fruit has sunk into the juice, let the fire go out, and leave the bottles in the water until it is cold; turn the bottles upside down, and keep them in a cool place. If they leak they must be used at once. Fruit thus preserved will keep for any number of years, retaining all its original freshness. They will require more sugar when put into tarts or puddings. The contents of a bottle when opened must be used at once, for the air getting in will spoil them. Green Apricots for Tarts.—When the apricots are the size of a large hazel-nut, thin the trees, gather them on a dry day, wipe them clean, prick them, throw them into a weak syrup, boil them up, let them remain 24 hours, then boil them again ; they will now be quite green. When cold, put them into a On this, however, we may remark, that, although bladders may answer the purpose, yet good corks are the only means by which any certainty can be obtained ; and for facilitating the sure corking, a small machine, made by Cooper, St. John-street, cannot be too highly recommended.Chap. XXV.] 509 PRESERVED FRUITS. wide-mouthed bottles, and fill up the bottles with the syrup ; proceed as before stated ; boil for 20 minutes. Ripe Apricots.—Cut them in halves, pack them closely in bottles, which you can easily do with the assistance of 2 skewers; shake them down well; crack the stones, peel the kernels, put a few into each bottle, fill the bottle with weak syrup, cork them well, tie tightly down, put on in cold water, and boil for 15 minutes. Green Gages—Take them before they are thoroughly ripe, prick them all over, put in bottles, fill with syrup, cork and tie them down, put them into cold water, let them heat very gradually; when they are turned brown take them off the fire, and the next day let them boil for 10 minutes. Cherries.—Fill the bottles and shake them down close, put on the top 2 oz. of powdered lump-sugar, cork and tie them down, put them on to boil, and when the juice covers the fruit they are done. TO KEEP GRAPES (as in Switzerland). 702. —Fasten packthread lines near the ceiling of a cool but not damp room. Pick the grapes before they are very ripe ; cut out every one that is decayed, but do not let their juice touch those that remain ; seal the extremity of the stalk to keep it from drying, and hang the bunches on the pack- thread. * Or in Brandy.—Take some close bunches, black or white, not over-ripe, and lay them in a jar. Put a good quantity of pounded white sugar-candy upon them, and fill up the jar with brandy ; tie them close down with a bladder, and keep in a dry place. Each grape should be pricked thrice. They make a beautiful middle dish in a winter dessert. TO PRESERVE FRUIT FOR TARTS. 703. —Cherries, plums of all sorts, and American apples, gather when ripe, and lay them in small jars that will hold a pound ; strew over each jar 6 oz. of good loaf-sugar pounded ; cover with 2 bladders each, separately tied down; then set the jars in a large stewpan of water up to the neck, and let it boil 3 hours gently. Keep these and all other sorts of fruit free from damp.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXV. 510 L TO PRESERVE APRICOTS. 704.— Green Apricots.—Prick the apricots, cover tiie bot- tom of a preserving-pan with vine-leaves, fill the pan with apricots and cold spring water, laying more vine-leaves on the top. Put them over a slow fire until they turn yellow ; then take them off, and wipe them well with a flannel and a little salt, and put them over the fire in the same water to green them. Have ready a thin syrup; boil the apricots up in it once, and repeat the process on the 2 following days. Drain them from the syrup, and, rendering it strong with sugar, boil them again in the thick syrup, and put them by for use. Peaches, nectarines, &c., may be preserved the same way. Ripe Apricots.—Having pared the apricots, thrust oufthe stones with a skewer, and take the same weight of loaf-sugar as of fruit; strew a part of the sugar over the apricots, and let them stand till next day ; then boil them up gently 3 or 4 different times, adding the kernels to the syrup. Let them cool between each boiling, then take them out of the syrup carefully one by one; boil the syrup with all the sugar, skim it carefully, then pour it over the apricots, and tie them down close with a paper and bladder. A beautiful Preserve of Apricots .—When ripe, choose the finest apricots; pare them as thin as possible, and weigh them; lay them in halves on dishes, with the hollow part upwards; have ready an equal weight of good loaf-sugar, finely pounded, and strew it over them; in the mean time break the stones and blanch the kernels. When the fruit has lain 12 hours, put it, with the sugar and juice, and also the kernels, into a preserving-pan ; let it simmer very gently till clear, then take out the pieces of apricot singly, put them into small pots, and pour the syrup and kernels over them. The scum must be taken off as it rises. Cover with paper. Apricots in Jelly.—Pare the fruit very thin, and stone it; weigh an equal quantity of sugar in fine powder, and strew over it, Next day boil very gently till they are clear, move them into a bowl, and pour the liquor over. The following day pour the liquor to a quart of codling-liquor; let it boil quickly till it will jelly ; put the fruit into it, and give 1 boil; skim well, and put into small pots. To dry Apricots whole or in halves.—Take them beforeChap. XXV.] PRESERVED FRUITS. 511 they are fully ripe, scald them in a jar plunged into boiling water, then pare them and take out the stones; put them into a syrup of half their weight of sugar, in proportion of 1 pint of water to 4 lbs. of sugar; let them scald awhile, and then boil until they are clear. Let them stand for 2 days in the syrup, and then put them into a thin candy, and scald, but not boil, them in it. Keep them 2 days longer in the candy, heating them each day, and then lay them on glasses to dry. APPLE-JUICE TO USE FOR JELLY. 705. — Pour into a stewpan a quart of cold water; throw into it, as quickly as they can be peeled, cored, and weighed, 4 lbs. of' good boiling apples of fine flavour—codlings are the best; stew them till the fruit is well broken ; strain through a jelly- bag ; to every quart of this juice allow It lb. of sugar. This makes a beautiful jelly to preserve other fruits in. TO PRISER VE RIPE PEA CHES.—E. R. 706. —October is the best month, as they are then harder and larger. Put them into a preserving-pan full of cold water, with a slice or two of lemon ; set them on a slow fire ; have ready a sieve and a napkin ; bq careful not to do them too much : some will be ready sooner than others. When they begin to be soft they are done enough: drain them on the sieve, and let them stand until cold ; then put them into glasses: pound sugarcandy very fine in a mortar, dissolve it in brandy, and fill up the glasses with it. Or:—Wipe, weigh, and pick the fruit, and have ready a quarter of the weight of fine sugar in fine powder. Put the fruit into an icepot that shuts very close; throw the sugar over it, and then cover the fruit with brandy. Between the top and cover of the pot put a piece of double cap-paper. Set the pot in a saucepan of water till the brandy be as hot as you can possibly bear to put your finger in, but it must not boil. Put the fruit into a jar, and pour the brandy on it. When cold put a bladder over it, and tie it down tight. TO PRESERVE NECTARINES—E. R. 707. —Split the fruit, take out the stones, and put the nec- tarines into clarified sugar till they take it well. Skim the liquor, cover the nectarines with paper, and set them by until the next day. Add sugar to the syrup, boiling it untilMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXV. 512 it will flow; put in the nectarines, give them a good boil, skim, cover them, and lay them on a stove. The next dav take them out of the sugar, drain them, place them sepa- rately, dusting sugar over them; the next day put them on the stove or into a cool oven to dry. TO PRESERVE A MELON.-E. R. 708. —Scrape off the thin outside skin, make a hole in the top, take out the seeds; then throw the melon into water, and after it has remained 12 hours take it out and put it into a preserving-pan, with a large piece of loaf-sugar and as much water as will cover it; then cover the pan closely, and let it remain for an hour on a very slow fire. Repeat this process 3 times, on 3 successive days, taking care not to allow it to boil ; make a thin syrup, drain the melon carefully out of the liquor, and put it into the syrup, set it over a slow fire closely covered for k an hour every day for 3 ensuing days, on the last day boiling the syrup until it is veiy rich, with the rind of one, and the juice of 2 lemons To improve the flavour of a melon, take it when nearly ripe, cut out so much of the large end as to permit the scooping out of the seeds ; then fill up the hollow with water and sugar, or white wine; close the top, put the melon in a net exposed to the sun for as many days as it remains good. A water melon will thus acquire a fine flavour; but a musk melon requires no improvement. Or:—Take a melon, cut it into pieces as for eating, trim off the outer rind, freely dust it over with fine sugar, and 12 hours after put it in a preserving-pan with sufficient syrup to cover it; boil it gently until tender, repeat the boiling for 3 succes- sive days, when the syrup should be thick. TO PRESERVE STRAWBERRIES.—E. R. 709. —Obtain the juice of currants by boiling , them in a jar plunged in water; to every pint of the currant-liquor add 1 lb. of strawberries and the weight of both in sugar. Break the sugar in lumps, dip them in water to dissolve, then boil it with the currant-juice, skim it well, then put in the strawberries; let them boil about \ of an hour, and, while yet warn*, put them with the syrup in pots. \To preserve Strawberries whole.—To 1 lb. of picked fruit add lb. of pounded lump-sugar. Lay part of it upon theChap. XXV.] PRESERVED FRUITS. 513 fruit, and let it remain until the next day; then put the re- mainder of the sugar and a pint of currant-juice to every lb. of strawberries into a preserving-pan, and boil to a syrup; then add the strawberries, and simmer very gently till the fruit is soft, being careful not to break it; then take out the strawberries, and boil the syrup until it appears to be rich. Wait until it is cold, and then put it upon the fruit. A rich way of preserving Strawberries.—In picking the strawberries reserve the largest kinds ; then boil the smaller ones, allowing f lb. of fine sugar to 1 lb. of fruit ; stir it while boiling, and make it into jam. Make a fine syrup of sugar, and boil the larger strawberries in it, taking great care that they be kept separate, and do not break. Take them out, and put them into small preserving-pots ; then boil the syrup and the jam together until it is very rich, or make it into a jelly by straining it, and pour it on the strawberries when nearly cold. Choose the largest scarlets, or others, when not dead ripe. In either of the above ways they eat well served in thin cream in glasses. To preserve Strawberries in Wine.—Put a quantity of the finest large strawberries into a gooseberry-bottle, and strew in it 3 large spoonfuls of fine sugar; fill up with Madeira wine or fine sherry. TO PRESERVE ORANGES OR LEMONS IN JELLY. 710. —Cut a hole at the stalk the size of a shilling, and with a small blunt knife scrape out the pulp quite clear, with- out cutting the rind, and lay them in spring water 2 days, changing it twice a-day ; in the last, boil them tender on a slow fire, keeping them covered to the last. To every lb. of fruit take 2 lbs. of double-refined sugar and 1 pint of water; boil the two latter together with the juice of the orange to a syrup, and clarify it; skim well, and let it stand to be cold ; then boil the fruit in the syrup a an hour; if not clear, do this daily till they are done. TO KEEP ORANGES OR LEMONS FOR PASTRY. 711. —When you have squeezed the juice, throw the peels into salt and water ; let them remain a fortnight; clean out the pulp ; boil them till tender, strain them, and when they are tolerably dry throw them into any syrup you may have 2 LMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXY. 514 remaining from old sweetmeats; or, if you have none, boil a small quantity of syrup of common loaf-sugar and water, and put over them ; in a week boil them gently in it till they look clear. TO PRESERVE WHOLE OR HALF QUINCES. 712. —Into 2 quarts of boiling water put a quantity of the fairest golden pippins, in slices not very thin, and not pared, but wiped clean. Boil them very quickly, close covered, till the water becomes a thick jelly; then scald the quinces. To every pint of pippin-jelly put 1 lb. of the finest sugar; boil it, aud skim it clear. Put those quinces that are to be done whole into the syrup at once, and let it boil very fast; and those that are to be in halves by themselves; skim it, and when the fruit is clear put some of the syrup into a glass to try whe- ther it jellies before taking off the fire. The quantity of quinces is to be 1 lb. to 1 lb. of sugar, and 1 lb. of jelly already boiled with the sugar. TO PRESERVE PEARS. 713. —Pare them very thin, and simmer in a thin syrup; let them lie a day or two. Make the syrup richer, and simmer again, and repeat this till they are clear; then drain and dry them in the sun or a cool oven a very little time. They may be kept in syrup, and dried as wanted, which makes them more ' moist and rich. Jargonelles are the best for this purpose. To bake Pears. — These need not be of a fine sort; but some taste better than others, and often those that are least fit to eat raw. Wipe, but do not pare, and lay them on tin plates, and bake them in a slow oven. When soft enough to bear it, flatten them with a silver spoon. When done through, put them on a dish. They should be baked 3 or 4 times, and very gently. To stew Pears.—Pare and halve or quarter large pears, according to their size ; throw them into water, as the skin is taken off, before they are divided, to prevent their turning black. Pack them round a block-tin stewpan, and sprinkle as much sugar over as will make them pretty sweet, and add lemon-peel, a clove or two, and some allspice cracked ; just cover them with water, and add a little red wine. Cover them close and stew 3 or 4 hours; when tender, take them out, and strain the liquor over them.PEESEEVED FEUITS. 515 Chap. XXV.] TO PRESERVE SIBERIAN CRABS.—E. R. 714. —Rub the fruit with a dry flannel, taking care not to break the skin. Prick each with a needle all over to prevent its bursting. Boil 1 lb. of sugar in a pint of water, then put in the fruit and boil it until the skin begins to crack slightly; then take up the crabs, drain them separately upon a dish; boil the syrup again, and if not strong enough add more sugar; when cold pour it over the fruit, which must be put into jars, tied down closely, and kept in a cool dry place. Another way.—Boil a pint of water and 1 ^ lb. of refined sugar to a fine clear syrup ; skim it, and let it become cold. Pare the crabs; and to this quantity of syrup put 1 lb. of fruit, and simmer slowly till tender. Carefully remove each apple separately, and pour the syrup over when a little cooled, and add orange and lemon peel boiled tender. BIFFINS. The Red Biffin, or the Minshul Crab, are the best sorts for drying. 715. —Take the Red Biffin apple, and put them into a cool oven 6 or 7 times, flattening them gently by degrees, when they are soft enough to bear it. If the oven should be hot they will waste ; and they ought to be put at first into a very •cool one. They are prepared in the same manner in France, and when stewed either in milk or wine are very good. TO PRESERVE MAGNUM BONUM PLUMS.—E. R. 716. —Set them over a slow fire in spring water until they will peel, keeping them under the water; peel and put them into a jar with a thin syrup, which must cover them, or other- wise they will be discoloured. The next day boil the syrup, then put in the plums, and give them a gentle boil. Let them stand until cold; then repeat the process; turn them in the syrup until nearly cold. Take out the plums, strain the sy- rup, add more sugar, and skim it well; put in the plums, boil them till they are clear, then cover with paper. To Dry.—Take the weight of the plums in sugar, wrap each plum in a vine-leaf, put them into a stewpan covered 2 l 2MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXY. 516 with water, and set them on a slow fire to scald. When suffi- ciently done take them out and lay them in a bowl or deep dish, pound the sugar, and put it on them; the following day pour the syrup off, and boil it, and put it on the plums; this do every day for 4 or 5 days; then take the plums out of the syrup, sift sugar over them, lay them upon tins, and dry them in a cool oven or before the fire. A common Preserve of Plums.—Put the plums into a jar large enough to hold 1 lb. of fruit, add 7 oz. of good moist sugar ; tie the jar over with 2 bladders tied separately ; place the jar in a kettle of cold water up to the bladders; do not cover the kettle, and let them boil in the water for 3 hours. TO PRESER VE GREENGA GES.—E. R. 717. —Pick and prick all the plums ; put them into a pre- serving-pan with cold water enough to cover them. Let them remain on the fire until the water simmers well; then take off, and allow them to stand until half cold, putting the plums to drain. To every lb. of plums allow 1 lb. of sugar, which must be boiled in the water from which the plums have been taken; let it boil very fast until the syrup drops short from the spoon, skimming carefully all the time. When the sugar is sufficiently boiled put in the plums, and allow them to boil until the sugar covers the pan with large bubbles. Then pour the whole into a pan, and let them remain until the following day. Drain the syrup from the plums as dry as possible, boil it up quickly, and pour it over the plums; then set them by; do this a third and a fourth time. On the fifth day, when the syrup is boiled, put the plums into it, and let them boil for a few minutes ; then put them into jars. Should the greengages be over ripe, it will be better to make jam of them, using f lb. of sugar to 1 lb. of fruit Warm the jars before putting the sweetmeats in, and be careful not to boil the sugar to a candy. TO PRESERVE GOOSEBERRIES. 718. —Take the rough-skinned fruit when quite dry, with rather more than their weight of sugar pounded fine; lay a layer of fruit and a layer of sugar till all are in the pan ; add a teacupful of water, and boil the fruit quickly till it is clear ; take it out and put it.into jars; boil up the syrbp till it isChaf. XXV.] 517 PRESERVED FRUITS. thick, then pour it over the fruit. When cold cover close with pasted paper. MARMALADES. 719.—Apricot.—Gather the fruit before it is too ripe, stone and blanch the kernels. To every lb. of fruit take # lb. of fine loaf-sugar; break the sugar into lumps, dip the lumps in water, allow them to dissolve, put it over a clear fire, and let it boil to a candy; then pound and sift it; pare the fruit, cut it into thin slices, put them with the sugar over a slow fire, let it simmer till clear, but do not boil it; acid the kernels, and then put the marmalade into jars. Or:—Boil ripe apricots in syrup until they will mash ; beat them in a mortar ; take A their weight in loaf-sugar, and suffi- cient water to dissolve it; boil all together, and skim until it is clear, and the syrup thick like fine jelly. Apple.—Pare and core some green pippins, and boil in water till quite soft; break them gently with the back of a spoon; strain the water through a jelly-bag till quite clear; then to every pint put 1 lb. of double-refined sugar, the peel and juice of a lemon, and boil to a strong syrup. Drain off' the syrup from the fruit, and pour the apple-jelly over it, and sim- mer the whole until it becomes thick. Cover with paper. Common moist sugar is sometimes employed for family use. . Quince.—Pare and quarter the fruit, put it in layers in a stone jar with sugar sprinkled between each; add a teacupful of water, and bake it in a cool oven. Have a quantity of sugar equal in weight to the fruit; allow 1 quart of water to every 4 lbs.; boil the sugar and water together, skimming it well. When the quinces are soft add them, with a quart of the juice which will be found in the jar: boil them in the syrup, beating it with a spoon until the marmalade is quite smooth. Another way.—Pare and quarter quinces, weigh an equal quantity of sugar ; to 4 lbs. of the latter put 1 quart of water, boil and skim, and have it ready whilst 4 lbs. of quinces are made tolerably tender by the following mode:—Lay them in a stone jar with a teacupful of water at the bottom, and pack them with a little sugar strewed between ; cover the jar close, and set it on a stove or cool oven, and let them soften till the colour become red ; then pour the fruit-syrup and 1 quart of quince-juice hito a preserving-pan, and boil all together till theMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XX V. 518 marmalade is completed, breaking the lumps of fruit with the preserving-ladle. This fruit is so hard that if it be not done as above it requires a great deal of time. Stewing quinces in a jar, and then squeezing them through a cheese-cloth, is the best method of obtaining the juice to add as above: dip the cloth in boiling water first and wring it. A very fine Orange Marmalade.—Take 50 Seville oranges and 12 lemons; have their weight in loaf-sugar; grate the oranges slightly all over to take away the bitterest part of the peel, cut the rind all round, and with a spoon separate it from the fruit without breaking the edge; boil the peel in 2 sepa- rate waters 20 minutes each time ; the first water should be cold, the second boiling. The peel should be shred in extremely thin slices; separate the seeds and every bit of skin from the pulp ; then mash it in a marble mortar; boil the sugar till it is a clear syrup ; having dipped the lumps into cold water, add the pulp and juice; let it boil i of an hour; then add the shred peel; let it boil till tender. The peel only of the lemons is used; the lemons will do for lemon-pickle. Or:—Weigh the oranges ; to 6 lbs. of fruit allow 9 lbs. of raw or 6 lbs. of good refined sugar ; boil the oranges whole till you can pierce them with a straw. Then cut them in quar- ters, take the seeds out of the pulp, and scrape the white under skin from the peel. Slice or mince the oranges, put the sugar with a little water into a pan; and when dissolved put the whole together, and let it boil on a slow fire until it becomes of a proper consistence. Orange Marmalade for Puddings. — Take 12 Seville oranges, boil them till quite tender, changing the water 2 or 3 times, take out the seeds, pulp, and inner skin of the rind ; beat the outer rind in a marble mortar very fine ; add to it the pulp and juice ; to every lb. of this add 2 lbs. of fine moist sugar ; mix it all well together ; put it into a larger jar than will hold it, as it ferments a little at first. It will keep for years, and no boiling is necessary. If made for breakfast it looks prettier when made with loaf-sugar. Transparent.—Cut the palest Seville oranges in quarters; fake the pulp out arid put it in a basin; pick out the seeds and skins. Let the outsides soak in water with a little salt all night, then boil them in a good quantity of spring water till tender;519 PRESERVED FRUITS. Chap. XXV.] drain, and cut them in very thin slices, and put them to the pulp ; add to every lb. It lb. of double-refined sugar beaten fine; boil them together 20 minutes, but be careful not to break the slices. If not quite clear, simmer 5 or 6 minutes longer. It must be stirred all the time very gently. When cold, put it into glasses. Mixed.—Split and stone 4 dozen plums, blanch the kernels, and pound them in a mortar with a little rose-water; pare and core 2 dozen pears and the same number of apples ; put them into a jar with a little sugar, but no water. Bake them in a cool oven. Beat them well in a preserving-pan, stir in 3 lbs. of sugar, and boil them 1 hour; put the marmalade into small deep dishes, and dry it gently in a cool oven. Scotch.—Take 6 or 8 lbs. of Seville oranges, pare off1 the skins thinly, so that there shall be as little as possible of the white portion ; cut the parings into strips or chips, and cut them across again into very small pieces. Put them into a pan with as much water as will cover them, boil them for 1 hour, then strain them through a sieve, and lay them aside. Next quar- ter the oranges, and scrape out the pulp and juice into a dish, throwing away the white skins, films, and seeds; put the whole into a pan, together with 7 or 8 lbs. of sugar, according to the original weight of the oranges; let the whole boil for t an hour; skim it, and pour it into pans for use. It may be observed that, although this marmalade should be made entirely of Seville oranges, yet a few, if mixed with the common sorts, are sufficient to give the necessary flavour, and in that manner is made all that is sold in the shops as 11 Scotch marmalade COMPOTES. 720.— Orange.—Lay the oranges in water for 4 hours, then boil them till tender, cut them in halves, and take out all the insides; to every lb. of peel well pounded add 1 lb. of sugar; then take all the skins and seeds out of the pulp, add its weight of sugar, and beat it well; then mix it with the peel, and beat it again in a mortar, and pot it for use. Two dozen sweet Lisbon oranges will make a large jar of paste : it will keep good for several years in pots covered with paper. Apple.—Take a dozen fine rennets, peel and core them, but do not divide them ; put them into a wide-necked jar, strewMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXY. 520 amongst them some thinly shred lemon-peel, and put 1 lb. of fine moist sugar upon them. When the apples are very ripe add a little lemon-juice ; put in i pint of water ; cover the jar close, and bake slowly. They may be served hot, with the juice poured over them ; or, when cold, for dessert, or for a corner dish, with a custard poured round them. Med Currant.—Boil ^ lb. of sugar in ^ pint of water for 15 minutes; simmer a quart of picked currants in it for 10 minutes. Raspberries, cherries, gooseberries, rhubarb, or almost any sort of fruit, may be prepared in the same proportions, only varying the quantity of sugar according to the acidity of the fruit. These compotes will be found excellent served with batter, bread, ground rice, or any other puddings, or with a little custard or cream. TO DRY CURRANTS FOR DESSERT.—E. R. 721. —Have a basin of water and dissolve in it a sufficient quantity of gum-Arabic to make it rather thick ; have also a plateful of the best loaf-sugar, pounded and sifted. Dip bunches of ripe red currants into the gum-Arabic solution, and then roll them well in the sugar: lay them separately on a dish to dry in the sun. They are very pretty for dessert, to be eaten immediately ; if kept, care must be taken that the bunches do not touch, and the process should be repeated by rolling them in sugar for several days successively. BARBERRY CAKES.—E. R. 722. —Pick the barberries and weigh them ; to every lb. of fruit add 1 lb. of sugar pounded and sifted. Bruise the bar- berries in a mortar, boil them gently till nearly all the juice is consumed, then take therp off the fire and stir in the sugar by degrees ; drop the fruit on earthen dishes to dry : it must not go over the fire after the sugar is put in, nor must there be any water used. Do not pound the barberries too small, as the cakes will not look so well. Currant cakes may be made in the same way. FRUIT WAFERS FOR DESSERT.—E. R. 723. —Take currants, cherries, apricots, or any other fruit; put them into an earthen jar in a kettle of water, and when scalded strain them through a sieve. To every pint of juiceChap. XXV.] 521 PRESERVED FRUITS. add the same weight of finely sifted sugar and the white of a small egg. Beat all together until it becomes quite thick, then put it upon buttered paper in a slow oven : let them remain until they will quit the paper, then turn them, and leave them in the oven until quite dry ; cut them into shapes and keep them near the fire in a box between paper. GOOSEBERRY CHEESE. 724. —Gather the rough red gooseberries when quite ripe; bake them until they are a perfect mash ; pass them through a hair sieve, then put them into a preserving-pan, and boil them gently. To every lb. of gooseberries put 3 oz. of sugar, which should be strewed in every now and then, a little at a time. It will take several hours to boil, in order to obtain the proper thickness. To dry Gooseberries.—Put 5 lbs. of gooseberries into a stewpan, and strew over them 1 lb. of sugar ; set them on a slow fire ; when the syrup begins to come out take them off; scald them in this way for 2 or 3 days, then take them out of the syrup, place them upon sieves, and put them before the fire or in the sun to dry. They may be dipped into powdered white sugar when taken out of the syrup, and thus candied. They should be laid between paper in tin boxes when put by for use. CHERRIES.—E. R. 725. — To Dry.—Weigh the cherries before they are stoned, and allow to every lb. of fruit £ lb. of lump-sugar ; when they are stoned set them over a slow fire to heat, then take them out of the liquor and put the sugar to them, and let them stand till it is dissolved. Then set them over the fire and let them just boil. Allow them to stand until they are quite cold, or, if convenient, for 2 or 3 days, in the syrup; afterwards strain them, and spread them on sieves to dry, either on a stove or in the sun, or in an oven after the bread is drawn. The same syrup will do again for more fruit. To Dry without Sugar.—Stone, and set them over the fire in the preserving-pan ; let them simmer in their own liquor, and shake them in the pan. Put them in china common dishes ; next day give them another scald, and put them when cold on sieves to dry in an oven of temperate heat. Twice heat- ing, an hour each time, will do them. Put them in a box, with a paper between each layer.522 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXV. Preserved in Brandy.—Reserve a fourth portion of the cherries, clip the stalks of the remainder; lay them carefully in jars, and fill up the jars with brandy, putting- no sugar, as that would wrinkle them. Then stone the remaining portion, boil them with double their weight of sugar, and put them aside. When the brandy-cherries are taken out for dessert, mix a portion of this preserve with the liquor, and they will taste very rich ; or the cherries may be strained and the liquor ohly used, in addition to the brandy from the other cherries. Another method.—Weigh the finest morellas, having cut oft' half the stalk; prick them with a new needle, and drop them into a jar or wide-mouthed bottle. Pound f the weight of sugar or white candy ; strew over ; fill up with brandy, and tie a bladder over. Rolled Cherries, which taste as if done in Brandy.—To every 3 lbs. of morella cherries put 1 lb. of double-refined sugar, sifted in layers, in a large stone jar or small keg. Stop it perfectly close, and roll the jar to and fro for a short time every day for 6 weeks. Keep them in a cool place. When intended for Tarts and Puddings.—Take 15 lbs. of Kentish cherries; boil, and break them as they boil, and when the juice has all boiled away, and the bottom of the pan is visible, put in 3 lbs. of lump sugar finely powdered. Stir the cherries well, and let them have 2 or 3 boils ; then add a pint of currant-juice, skim the pot, and take out the stones, which mil rise to the top. This jam will keep until late in the spring without the addition of any more sugar, and will make good tarts and puddings. ALMACK’S PRESERVE.—E. R. 726.—Take different kinds of fruit, stone the plums and slice the apples and pears, put them in alternate layers in a jar; set them in the oven until they are quite soft ; then pass the pulp through a coarse sieve, and to every lb. of fruit put a lb. of moist sugar, set it over a slow fire and stir it till very thick, then put it into a wide shallow pot and cut it in slices for use. Windfalls may be employed for this sort of sweet- meat. Another.—Put into a pan 4 dozen split plums, 2 dozen apples, and 2 dozen pears, pared thin and cored. Boil them without water. When well blended together, and the stones taken out, stir in 3 lbs. of sugar, and boil them an hour. PutPRESERVED FRUITS. Chap. XXV.] 523 it into shallow pans or soup-plates, and dry in the sun or a cool oven. MAGNUM BONUM PLUMS. 727. —Prick them with a needle to prevent bursting, simmer them very gently in thin syrup, put them in a china bowl, and when cold pour it over. Let them lie 3 days ; then make a syrup of 3 lbs. of sugar to 5 of fruit, with no more water than hangs to large lumps of the sugar dipped quickly and instantly brought out. Boil the plums in this fresh syrup after drain- ing the first from them. Do them very gently till they are clear and the syrup adheres to them. Put them one by one into small pots, and pour the liquor over. If any are to be dried, keep a little of the syrup in the pan, and boil it quickly : then give the fruit one warm more, drain, and put them to dry on plates in a cool oven. These plums are apt to ferment if not boiled in two syrups ; the first syrup will sweeten pies, but will have too much acid to keep. You may reserve part of it, and add a little sugar, to do those that are to dry; for they will not reqnire to be so sweet as if kept wet. Do not break them. One parcel may be done after another, and save much sugar. DAMSON CHEESE.—E. R. 728. —Stone the damsons, take out the kernels and blanch • them; put the whole into a stone jar and bake it. Pour off' a part of the juice, put the fruit into a preserving-pan, boil it quickly until it looks rather dry. To every 2 lbs. of the original quantity of fruit take + lb. of loaf-sugar; now stir the sugar well in, and let it simmer slowly for 2 hours. Then boil it again quickly until it begins to candy at the sides of the pan. Pour the jam into shallow pots not more than an inch deep ; cover with brandy-paper, and tie down close. Or:—Gather the damsons on a dry day ; bake or boil them till the pulp will pass through a coarse hair sieve, then add their weight of moist sugar ; boil it hour, stirring it con- tinually to keep it from burning. AN EXCELLENT WAY OF DRESSING CHESTNUTS. 729. —Let them be well roasted and the husks taken off': dissolve i lb. of loaf-sugar in a wineglassful of water and the juice ol a lemon; put this with the chestnuts in a saucepan over524 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXV. a slow fire for 10 minutes; when cold add a tablespoonful of orange-flower water; serve in a deep dish, and grate sugar over the top. To be handed round at dessert. JAMS. 730.—Raspberry.—Take equal weights of fruit and moist sugar ; put them on the fire together ; keep stirring and break- ing the fruit till the sugar melts, then boil till it will jelly on a plate. Though simple, this will be found a very good receipt. Or :—Take equal weight of fruit and roughly-pounded loaf- sugar ; bruise the fruit with the back of a spoon, and boil them together for i an hour; if a little more juice is wanted, add the juice of currants drawn as for jelly. Grape.—The grapes ought not to be very ripe. They should be carefully picked, and all that are at all injured should be rejected. To 1 lb. of grapes add i lb. of sugar; no water but what hangs about them after they have been washed. Put the grapes into a cooking-pan, then a layer of sugar, then a layer of grapes. Boil on a moderate fire, stir- ring it all the time, to prevent its burning. Cherry.—Stone 4 lbs. of cherries, and put them in a pre- serving-pan with 2 lbs. of fine white sugar and a pint of red-currant juice. Boil the whole together rather fast, until it stitfens, and then put it into pots for use. Gooseberry.—Stalk and crop 6 lbs. of the small, red, rough gooseberry, put them into a preserving-pan, and, as they warm, stir and bruise them to bring out the juice. Let them boil for 10 minutes, then add 4 lbs. of sugar, and place it on , the fire again ; let it boil, and continue boiling for 2 hours longer, stirring it all the time to prevent its burning. "W hen it thickens, and will jelly upon a plate, it is done enough. Put it into pots, and allow it to remain a day before it is covered. Blackberry.—In families where there are many children there is no preparation of fruit so wholesome, so cheap, and so much admired, as this homely conserve. The fruit should be clean picked in dry weather, and to every lb. of berries put 7 lb. of coarse brown sugar ; boil the whole together for f of an hour or 1 hour, stirring it well the whole time. Put it in pots like any other preserve, and it will be found most useful in families, as it may be given to children instead of medicine; makesChap. XXV.] PRESERVED FRUITS. 525 • excellent puddings; and even if the fruit be purchased in London, the cost will not exceed 8c?. per lb. Barberry. — Take the barberries without stones, pick them from the stalks, take their weight in loaf-sugar, put them into a jar, and place it in a kettle of water until the sugar is dissolved and the barberries quite soft. The next day put them into a preserving-pan, and boil them for 1 of an hour. Put them into jars, and keep them in a dry place. TO PRESERVE BARBERRIES IN BUNCHES. 731. -—Take the stoneless barberries, reserve the largest bunches ; then pick the rest from the stalks, put them into as much water as will make a syrup for the bunches, boil them until quite soft; then strain them through a sieve, and to every pint of juice put It lb. of loaf-sugar: boil and skim it well. To every pint of this syrup put ^ lb. of barberries in bunches, boil them until they look quite clear, and put them into pots or glasses. Tie brandy-paper over them. They are only used as a garnish for other sweet dishes. COMPOSITION SWEETMEA T.~E. R. 732. —Take 2 pottles of ripe red gooseberries, 2 of red raspberries, 2 of strawberries (the pines are best), and 3 pints of ripe red currants; bruise and mix them together in a deep dish, and to every pint of the fruit put f lb. of sugar, pounded ‘pretty fine ; then boil it for % an hour, stirring it all the time it is on the fire. Cherries may also be added, first taking out the stones ; measure them with the other fruit for the weight of sugar. C URRANT JELL Y. 733. —Take of red and white currants equal quantities, tie them down close in a jar, put them into a kettle of water over a slow fire to boil for 2 hours; strain the liquor through a fine sieve, but do not squeeze the currants hard; then to every pint of juice put ^ lb. of loaf-sugar pounded ; set it over a very slow fire until the sugar is dissolved. Do not stir it until the scum rises thick enough to be taken oft' at once ; then let it boil up quickly for 20 minutes, or until it jellies. Currant. Jelly without boiling.—Press the juice from the currants, and make it quite hot, but it must not be allowed to boil. To each pint of juice add a full lb. of loaf-sugarMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXV. 526 pounded very fine, and made quite hot in the oven, and then stirred gradually into the hot juice until it is melted. APPLE JELLY. 734. —Quarter a peck of codlings, put them into a pre- serving-pan with the peel of a lemon, a small piece of cinnamon, and 6 cloves; add as much spring water as will just cover them. Boil the whole to a pulp, then run them through a flannel bag, and to every pint of juice put i lb. of good loaf-sugar ; boil it fast until it jellies; then pour it into pots or moulds. August is the best time to make this jelly, when the codlings are full-grown, but not ripe. Crabs greatly improve this jelly, and in their absence a little lemon-juice. Imitations of citron, ginger, and guava jelly, are sometimes made in this country, but are always inferior to the original, and yet cost quite as much as if purchased at the shops ; we therefore look upon such receipts as worthless. Jelly may be made of any kind of fruit by putting the fruit into a preserving-pan with its own weight of sugar, boiling and skimming it until it will jelly ; then pour the whole through a new sieve, but do not press it; take what remains in the sieve, and boil it J of an hour for jam, and put the juice into another stewpan and boil the same time. This method saves the trouble of pressing, and prevents waste. ORANGE SYRUP.—E. R. 735. —Take the largest, deepest coloured, and roughest oranges that can be obtained, grate off the rind very nicely, and throw the oranges into water : let them remain 12 hours, changing the water once during that time, to take out the bitter. This, however, although a common practice, is injudicious, as the “ bitter ” of the peel, particularly of Seville orange, adds the finest flavour to the syrup. Put them into a cloth, and boil them; when tender cut them in quarters, and, after taking out the pulp, throw them into cold water; make a thin syrup, clear them in it, after which enrich the syrup, adding the pulp ; make it very thick, and pour it over the oranges in jars. The white Wedgewood ware are much better than the common earthen jars. CANDIED ORANGE OR LEMON PEEL.—E. R. 736. —Take the fruit, cut it lengthwise, remove all the pulpChap. XXV.] PRESERVED FRUITS. 527 and interior skin, then put the peel into strong , salt and water for 6 days ; then boil them in spring water until they are soft, and place them in a sieve to drain ; make a thin syrup with a lb. of sugar-candy to a quart of water, boil them in it for 4 an hour, or till they look clear; make a thick syrup with sugar and as much water as will melt it, put in the peel, and boil them over a slow fire until the syrup candies in the pan ; then take them out, powder pounded sugar over them, and diy them before the fire in a cool oven. GINGER SYRUP. 737. —Take a lb. of the best white ginger, break it into small pieces, and let it boil in a good quantity of water until the water tastes very strongly of the ginger. Then boil any sort of solid fruit in the ginger and water until they are nearly as tender as would be required for the table; take them up, and lay them in a jar with the ginger and wrater for 4 or 5 days, stirring them constantly. IS ext make a syrup ; to every lb. of loaf-sugar put i pint of brandy, the peel of a lemon, and the juice of t a lemon, with a little of the gingered water. When the syrup has been well boiled and the scum removed, put the fruit into it, and let it boil for 10 minutes; then take it off the fire, and allow it to remain for a week ; after which drain off the syrup, and boil it with additional sugar to make it sufficiently rich; place the fruit in it, and boil 10 or 15 minutes longer. Place them in pots covered with brandy-paper, and they will be fit for use in a month.

Add in boiling a bit of alum the size of a pea. Or use beet-root sliced, and some liquor poured over. For white, use almonds finely pounded, with a little drop of water; or use cream. For yellow, yolks of eggs or a bit of saffron steeped in the liquor, and squeezed.

[Chap. XXYI. CHAPTER XXYI. PICKLES AND FAMILY SAUCES. 739. — Although meat, when cured and dried, is called “ pickled,” yet in that operation salt alone is employed as brine, while in the pickling of vegetables, of which we are about to treat, the means chiefly used is vinegar. In the making of all sorts of pickles, salads, and sauces in which vinegar is employed, it is of much importance to have it of the strongest quality, as well as of the best flavour, of which that only which is made from white wine, and usually imported from France, can be called really good. Even when brought from thence, uidess purchased from a very respectable oilman, it will probably be adulterated: the fact is, that nothing but the commonest English vinegar, made from molasses and stale small beer, is ever to be found in the shops of the petty dealers. If, therefore, you like a well- dressed salad, never buy any other than real Provence or Italian oil, and the best Orleans vinegar. They are certainly dearest in price, but are much the best in quality. If the flavour of chilis, capsicums, tarragon, eschalots, garlic, or any root, is wished to be imparted to the vinegar, it is only necessary to put a portion of either (say 1 oz.) into a bottleful of the liquid ; cork it closely, and in a very few weeks it will be found thoroughly impregnated with the peculiar taste ; then strain it otf, and fill the bottle up again, as it will answer for more than once. The flavour of any herb will also be com- municated by boiling it for a short time in the acid ; as well as a few fruits, the flavour of which is very delicious when im- parted to vinegar. Pickles should be made at home, as both cheaper and better than if bought at oil-shops, where they are invariably made up with pyroligneous acid—a species of vinegar which, though very strong, has a disagreeable flavour. The pickles should be kept either in bottles, or in stone or unglazed jars, as the vinegar, or even soured vegetables, will corrode the glazing of the jars, which, being made from lead, is poisonous.529 PICKLES. Chap. XXVI.] Rules to be observed with Pickles.—Avoid as much as pos- sible the use of metal vessels in preparing them. Acids dis- solve the lead that is in the tinning of saucepans, and corrode copper and brass ; consequently, if kept in such for any length of time, they become highly poisonous. When it is necessary to boil vinegar, do it in a stone jar on a stove. Use also wooden spoons and forks. See that the pickles are always completely covered with vinegar; and if any symptoms appear of their becoming mouldy, boil the vinegar again, adding a little more spice. It is a good rule to have two-thirds of the jar filled with pickles and one-third with vinegar; keep them also close stopped, as exposure to the air makes the pickle soft. In greening pickles, keep them closely covered, so that none of the steam of the vinegar in which they are boiled be allowed to evaporate ; and boil them only for a few minutes, or it will take away their strength. A very small quantity of alum will make them firm and crisp, but too much will spoil them. TO PICKLE ONIONS 740.—Silver Sort.—Choose small button onions, as near of a size as possible; throw them into warm water, which will prevent their affecting the eyes so much while peeling them.a As they are peeled, throw them into a strong brine of salt and water, with a small bit of alum ; let them remain in this till the next day, then put them on the fire, and boil them in it for a minute. Or, as they are peeled, throw them into milk and water ; drain them from this when they are all done, put them into a jar, and pour the brine on them boiling hot; cover them close, and set them aside till the next day ; drain’ and dry them in a cloth; put them iuto cold distilled vinegar’ with a few blades of bruised ginger, some whole pepper, and, if approved, a little mace and sliced horseradish ; keep them always well covered with vinegar; cork the jar close, and put it in a cool dry place. Full-grown Sort..—Peel and slice large onions, and sprinkle them with salt. To every gallon take about a dozen cap- sicums, either dry or green, slicing only a part; add a A sjmP}e way to prevent this is by putting a crust of bread on the point ot your knife and occasionally smelling at it. 2 M530 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXVI few cloves, some pepper and allspice, all whole. Put the onions into jars, distribute the spices pretty equally among them, fill up the jars with vinegar, and set them in a pan of cold water over the fire, taking care that they are closely tied down with a bladder: keep a wet cloth over them to prevent the bladder from bursting. In about 1$ hour the onions will be soft enough. Onions and Cucumbers.—To every dozen of cucumbers put 3 large onions; cut both in thick slices, and sprinkle salt over them. Next day drain them for 5 or 6 hours, then put them into a stone jar, pour boiling vinegar over them, and keep them in a warm place. Repeat the boiling vinegar, and stop them up again instantly, and so on till green; "the last time put pepper and ginger ; keep in stone jars. The vinegar is very good for winter salads. GARLIC PICKLE.—E. R. 741. —Steep i lb. of ginger in strong salt and water for 5 days, then cut it into slices and dry it in the sun; put it into a large stone jar with a gallon of the best white-wine vinegar. Peel 1 lb. of garlic, salt it well, and let it stand in the salt 3 days; wipe it, and dry it in the sun, then put it into the pickle ; add also i lb. of long pepper steeped in salt and water and well dried, 1 lb. of mustard-seed bruised, and i lb. of tur- meric. Shake these ingredients well in the jar, and add any- thing that it is desirable to pickle as it comes into season, salt- ing and drying them previously in the sun. When completed, the pickle should be kept a year or two before it is used. Shalots may be pickled in the same way; or if put, as we have already stated, in a bottle of cold vinegar, their flavour will be imparted to it in the course of a month. CUCUMBERS. 742. —If full-grown, the small long sort are the best for pick- ling. Let them be fresh-gathered ; pull off the blossoms, but do not rub them ; pour over them a strong brine of salt and water boiling hot, cover them close, and let them stand all night. The next day stir them gently to take off the sand, drain them on a sieve, and dry them on a cloth ; make a pickle with the best white-wine vinegar, ginger, pepper (long and round), and a little garlic. When the pickle boils throw in the cu-531 PICKLES. Chap. XXVI.] cumbers, cover them, and make them boil as quickly as pos- sible for 3 or 4 minutes; put them into a jar with the vinegar, and cover them closely; when cold, put in a sprig of dill, the seed downward. They will be exceedingly crisp and green done in this manner; but if they do not appear to be of a fine colour, boil up the pickle the next day, and pour it boiling on the cucumbers. To pickle Gherkins.—Choose nice young ones, spread them on dishes, salt them, and let them lie a week, with a small bit of alum; then drain them, and, putting them in a jar, pour boiling vinegar over them. Set them near the fire, covered with plenty of vine-leaves ; if they do not become a tolerably good green, pour the vinegar into another jar, set it over the hot hearth, and when it becomes too hot to bear your hand, but still not to boil, pour it over them again, covering with fresh leaves; and thus do till they are of as good a colour as you wish. As an additional reason for preparing them at home, it is indeed well known that the very fine green pickles are made so by the dealers using brass or bell-metal vessels, which, when vinegar is put into them, become highly poisonous. If spices be not mixed among the pickle, put into the kettle in a thin muslin bag allspice, mace, and mustard-seed, to every quart of vinegar in the proportion of rather less than 4 oz. each of the former to 1 oz. of the seed. MUSHROOMS.—E. R. 743.— To pickle Mushrooms White.—Take the very small buttons, clean and nib them with a flannel, then put them into cold distilled vinegar, and allow it to come to a boil very slowly; drain and lay them in a cloth till cold, and then put them into fresh distilled vinegar. If very small they should not be allowed to boil, as so strong a heat might destroy them. It will therefore be sufficient to warm them; and when dried, they may be again put into the vinegar in which they had been originally placed, after it has been cooled. As to spice, a little mace will improve their flavour, but no hot pepper should be used. Those which are red underneath may also be used ; but those which are black are too old, and only fit for broiling or to make ketchup. To pickle Mushrooms Jiroxcn.—Choose them older, but she that they be fresh, and of a nearly pink colour underneath^ 2 m 2MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXVI. 532 clean, and sprinkle them with salt, put them in layers, and let them stand for a couple of days; then add some Avhole pepper, cover them very close, and put them into an oven when bread is baking. That done, take them out, strain off the liquor, into which put cloves, mace, and allspice, and let the whole boil for a little while. While that is doing, put the mushrooms into the stewpan for a short time, then take the whole off the fire, and when perfectly cold pot them, with the addition of a little vinegar. An excellent way to preserve the flavour of mushrooms when being pickled, is to rub them with a bit of flannel and salt, and from the larger take out the red inside: when they are black they will not do, being too old. Throw a little salt over, and put them into a stewpan with some mace; as the liquor comes out, shake them well, and keep them over a gentle fire till all of it be dried into them again ; then put as much vinegar into the pan as will cover them, give it one warm, and turn all into a glass or stone jar. They will keep 2 years, and are delicious. MUSHR OOM PO WDER. 744. —Wash peck of large mushrooms while quite fresh, and free them from dirt and grit with flannel; scrape out the black part clean, and do not use any that are wormeaten; put them into a stewpan over the fire without water, with 2 large onions, some cloves, i oz. of mace, and 2 spoonfuls of white pepper, all in powder; simmer and shake them till all the liquor be dried up, but be careful they do not burn. Lay them on tins or sieves, in a slow oven, till they are dry enough to beat to powder ; then put the powder in small bottles corked and tied closely, and keep in a dry place. A teaspoonful will give a very fine flavour to any soup or gravy, or any sauce. It is to be added just before serving, and 1 boil given to it after it is put in. . TO PICKLE WALNUTS. 745. —Gather the walnuts about the middle of July, and put them in salt and water; prick each with a needle seve- ral times; let them stand 2 or 3 days, changing the water every day. Make a brine of salt and water strong enough to bear an egg; it must be quite cold before being used, and be well skimmed while boiling. To every 100 walnuts533 Chap. XXVI.] PICKLES. allow 1 gallon of water. Let the walnuts soak 6 days, then change the brine, and let them stand 6 more; then drain them, and expose them to the sun that they may turn black; pour over them, in a jar, a pickle of the best white-wine vinegar, with a good quantity of pepper, pimento, ginger, mace, cloves, mustard-seed, and horseradish, all boiled to- gether, but cold. To every 100 walnuts allow 6 spoonfuls of mustard-seed, with 1 oz. of whole black pepper, and 2 or 3 heads of garlic or shalot, but the latter is least strong; let them be quite covered with vinegar. This done, they will be good for several years, if closely .covered. The air will soften them. They will not, however, be fit to eat under 6 months. TO PICKLE RADISH-PODS.—E. R. 746. —Gather the radish-pods when they are quite young, and put them into salt and water all night ; then boil the salt and water, and pour it over the pods in jars, and cover them closely to keep in the steam. When the brine is cold boil it, and pour it hot upon the pods again, repeating the .process until they are green; then put them in a sieve to drain, and make a pickle for them of white-wine vinegar, mace, ginger, long pepper, and horseradish ; pour it boiling hot upon the pods, and when nearly cold boil it again, and pour it over them. When cold, tie down the jars. * TO PICKLE FRENCH BEANS. 747. —Gather them before they become stringy, and, with- out taking off the ends, put them into a very strong brine until they become yellow; drain the liquor from them, and wipe them dry with a cloth. Put them into a stone jar by the fire, put in a little bit of alum, and pour boiling vinegar upon them every 24 hours, preventing the escape-of the steam. In 4 or 5 days they will become green. Boil a little mace, whole pepper, and ginger in the vinegar. Do samphire the same way. BARBER RIJESy pickled in Brine.—E. R. 748. —Gather the barberries before they are too ripe, pick out the leaves and dead stalks, put them into jars, with a large quantity of strong salt and water, and fie them down with bladders; when any scum arises put the barberries in :534 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXYI. fresh salt and water ; they will not require vinegar, their own acid being sufficient. Or, if imported from, abroad, and consequently old, pick out all the loose barberries, and lay aside the bunches. Make a brine of salt and water strong enough to bear an egg. To 2 quarts of brine put in 1 pint of white-wine vinegar and £ lb. of brown sugar ; boil all together with the loose bar- berries, and let it stand till it is cold. They must not boil long. Strain this liquor, pour it upon the bunches of bar- berries, and tie them up closely in the jars. NASTURTIUMS 749.—So much resemble capers, both in flavour and the mode of pickling, as to be frequently used in the same man- ner ; the seeds should be allowed to get ripe after the buds and flowers have gone off. Gather them upon a dry day, and keep them for .a few days after they have been gathered ; put them into a jar, and pour boiling vinegar well spiced upon them ; when cold, cover the jar. They will not be fit for use for some months, but will be finely flavoured after keeping, and are sometimes preferred to capers, for which they are an excellent substitute, being useful also in serving up all dishes in which pickles are warmed with the gravy. Young red capsicums and elder-flowers before they open may be done in the same way. TO PICKLE RED CABBA GE. 750.—Take those of a deep red or purple colour, strip off the outer leaves and cut out the stalk; quarter the cabbage lengthwise and cut it crosswise, but not in very thin slices; put it into a sieve and sprinkle it with salt and saltpetre ; let it drain for 24 hours, then squeeze it until it is very dry; make a pickle with sufficient vinegar to cover the cabbages well, and made with equal quantities of cloves and allspice, with a little mace—to be put in whole, to which if a very small quantity of cochineal be added, it will greatly improve the colour; boil the vinegar and spices together for full 5 minutes, and strain it; then, having put the cabbage into a stone jar, pour the vinegar over it boiling hot. This is opposed to the practice of some persons, who object to boiling the vinegar, and pour it cold upon the cabbage.535 Chap. XXVI.] PICKLES. TO PICKLE CAULIFLOWERS. 751. —Cut them before, they are too much blown, and upon a dry day; strip off the leaves, and quarter the stalk; scald them in salt and water, but do not allow them to boil; then lay them to cool, covering them that they may not lose their colour; sprinkle them with salt and water; put them on a colander for 24 hours to drain. When dry, cut out the thick stalk, or, if it be large, divide it, give it a boil, and split the flower into 8 or 10 pieces; then put them carefully into jars, and cover them with cold vinegar which has been previously boiled with spices; or the cauliflowers may have 1 boil in salt and vinegar, and be taken out immediately, and put into cold vinegar previously boiled with spices—2 oz. each of coriander- seed and turmeric, 1 oz. each of mustard-seed and ginger, with i oz. each of mace and nutmeg, or cinnamon, to every 3 quarts of vinegar; the spices may, however, be varied. Brocoli and the tops of asparagus may be pickled in the same manner. TO PICKLE TOM AT AS. 752. —For this purpose the small round ones are the best, and each should be pricked with a fork, to allow some of the juice to exude, but keep it for the pickle. Put them into a deep earthen vessel, sprinkle salt between every layer, and leave them there for 3 days covered ; then wash off the salt, and cover them with a pickle of cold vinegar, to which add the juice, mixed with a large handful of mustard-seed and 1 oz. each of cloves and white pepper, as being generally sufficient for 1 peck of fruit. It makes an excellent sauce for roast meat, and will be ready in about a fortnight. In America it is sometimes mixed up with layers of thinly- sliced onions; and chopped celery is a good addition, either with or without onions. TO PICKLE LEMONS. 753. —Take the finest with the thickest rind you can get, cut them deeply from end to end in more than one place, but not quite through, and fill the incisions with salt; put each on end, and lay them in a dish near the fire, or in the sun if the weather be hot, to dissolve the salt, and repeat this during 3 weeks; then put them into a jar, with a handful of white mustard-seed if it be large, i to £ lb. of bruised ginger,MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXYI. 536 half that quantity of cloves and allspice, a few chilis, and a very little turmeric; boil in vinegar, and pour it upon the lemons when cold. It was originally prepared by the cook of the first Earl of Orford. Some people, however, add to it either shalot or garlic. It can hardly be ready in less than 6 months, but will keep for many years. For limes, or very small lemons, the same method must be pursued, only they will not require above half the time. LEMON PICKLE. 754. —Peel 6 large lemons; cut them in quarters, lay them on a dish, and strew over them 7 lb. of salt, turning them every day for a week. Then put them into a stone jar; add 6 large cloves of garlic, 2 oz. of horseradish shred very thin ; of cloves, mace, nutmeg, and cayenne each x oz.; 2 oz. of mustard-seeds, bruised and tied up in a bit of thin muslin, and 2 quarts of the best vinegar. Cover the jar and set it in a pan of boiling water; let it boil 10 minutes, then set it in the oven, or anywhere that it may simmer gently, for 2 hours. Keep the jar closely covered, stirring it every day for 6 weeks, and when settled strain it and bottle for use. Another quart of vinegar may be added to the ingredients, and boiled up, which will make a very good pickle for common purposes, or the lemons may be added to any mixed pickles. MANGOES, 755. —Although any melon may be used before it is quite ripe, yet there is a particular sort for this purpose, which the gardeners know, and should be mangoed soon after they are gathered. Cut a small piece out of one end, through that take out the seeds, and mix with them mustard-seed and shred garlic ; stuff the melon as full as the space will allow, and replace the cut piece. Bind it up with packthread. I o allow for wasting, boil a good quantity of vinegar, with pepper, salt, ginger, and any of the sweet spices ; then pour it boiling-hot over the mangoes during 4 successive days ; and on the last, put flour of mustard and scraped horseradish into the vinegar, just as it boils up. Stop close. Observe that there be plenty of vinegar, as pickles are spoiled it not well covered. Large cucumbers, called “ green turley,” prepared in the same way, are excellent, and are sooner fit to be eaten.537 PICKLES. Chap. XXVI.] The greater number of times boiling vinegar is poured over either sort, the sooner it will be ready. MIXED PICKLE.—E. R. 756. —To 1 gallon of vinegar put 4 oz. of ginger bruised, 2 oz. of white pepper, 2 of allspice, 2 of chilis, 4 ol turmeric, 1 lb. of mustard-seed, i lb. of shalots, 1 oz. of garlic, and i lb. of bay-salt. Boil all together except the mustard-seed, which must be added afterwards. Then mix i very smoothly i lb. of made mustard with some of the vinegar, when cold, in a basin, and add it to the remainder with the seed. Take brocoli, radish-pods, French beans, or any other vegetables or small fruit; blanch the vegetables, l lay them on a sieve, and sprinkle a little salt over them to draw out the water. Let them stand in the sun till very dry, then pour the vinegar boiling over them, slicing in some horseradish if approved. Pickle of this kind can be rendered hot at pleasure, by additions of chilis, green and red capsicums—which, when gathered young, add exquisite flavour—and all sorts of foreign peppers. As the spring advances, a portion of every small root produced in a garden, if collected and thrown into cold vinegar, till it can be conveniently made into a regular pickle, will be found most excellent, at no greater expense than the cost of the spice and vinegar, and the trouble of mixing it. INDIA PICKLE—E. R. 757. —Is made in nearly the same manner. Put 200 gherkins, 3 pints of small onions, 1 quart of nasturtiums, 1 ditto of radish- pods, 1 quartern of French beans, 6 cauliflowers, and 2 hard white cabbages sliced, into a pan, and sprinkle them with salt, the onions having been previously peeled and laid in salt and water for a week to take off their strength. Then, after a day or two, take them out of the pan and dry them thoroughly in a warm place in the shade : they must be spread out sepa- rately. To 2 gallons of vinegar put H oz. of allspice, the same of long pepper and of white, and 2 of ginger, tied up in muslin bags. When cold, mix with the vinegar 1J lb. of flour of mustard, and 2 tablespoonfuls of cayenne pepper. Boil it well together, and pour it on the pickle: the vege- tables mentioned, not being all procurable at the same time,538 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXYI. may be added separately, at different periods, but they must all undergo the salting and drying process. In choosing those vegetables some discrimination may also be used: when in season, few things add a higher flavour to the pickle than the buds and flowers of the elder. India Pickle may also be made thus:—Peel, slice, and salt 1 lb. of garlic ; then put it during 3 days in the sun to dry. Salt and dry long pepper in the same way. Lay 1 lb. of white ginger in water 1 night; then scrape, slice, and lay it in salt in a pan till the other ingredients shall be ready. Prepare various vegetables thus:— Quarter small white cabbages, salt 3 days, squeeze, and set them in the sun to dry. Cut cauliflowers in their branches; take off the green from radishes ; cut celery in 3-inch lengths ; ditto young French beans whole, after being stringed ; like- wise shoots of elder, which look like bamboo. Apples and cucumbers, choose of the least seedy sort; cut them in slices, or quarters if not too large. All must be salted, drained, and dried in the sun, except the latter, over which you must pour boiling vinegar, and in 12 hours drain them, but no salt must be used. Put the spice, garlic, i lb. of mustard-seed, and as much vinegar as you think enough for the quantity you are to pickle, into a large stone jar, and 1 oz. of turmeric to be ready against the vegetables shall be dried. When they are ready, put some of them into a 2-quart stone jar. and pour over them 1 quart of boiling vinegar. Next day take out those vegeta- bles ; and, when drained, put them into a large stock-jar, and, boiling the vinegar, pour it over some more of the vegetables: let them lie a night, and do as above. Thus proceed till you have cleansed each set from the dust which must inevitably fall on them by being so long in doing; then, to every gallon of vinegar put 2 oz. of flour of mustard, mixing, by degrees, with a little of it boiling-hot. The whole of the vinegar should have been previously scalded, but set to be cool before it was put to the spice. Stop the jar tight. This pickle will not be ready for a year ; but you may make a small jar to be ready in a fortnight, by giving the cauliflower one scald in water, after salting and drying as above, but without the preparative vinegar; then pour the, vinegar, that has the spice and garlic, boiling-hot over. It at any time it be found that the vegetables have not swelled pro-539 PICKLES. Chap. XXVI.] perly, boiling the pickle, and pouring it over them hot, will plump them. Hoots, such as carrots, salsifs, scorzonera, and beetroot may be pickled by being sliced, or cut into small pieces, and slightly boiled in vinegar without destroying their crispness, and adding the common spices; with beetroot put button onions, or cut some Spanish onions in slices, lay them alter- nately in a jar; boil 1 quart of vinegar with 1 oz. of mixed pepper, ^ oz. of ginger, and some salt, and pour it cold over the beetroot and onions. VINEGARS. 758.— Vinegar for Lidia Pickle.—Prepare a gallon of vine- | gar, more or less, according to the quantity of pickles to be done, in the following manner :—Mix gradually i lb. of the best flour of mustard, and 2 oz. of powdered turmeric, with some of the cold vinegar at first, to ensure its being properly mixed ; then add the rest, with i lb. of white mustard-seed. Bruise i lb. of ginger, 2 oz. of white pepper, and 1 oz. of chilis, and tie them in a muslin bag. Boil the whole gently for 20 minutes or k an hour, and pour it whilst boiling on the pickles, having previously drained off the vinegar they were first put in. In 10 or 12 days repeat the boiling, pour it over the pickles whilst boiling hot, and they will be ready for use Avhen cold. , Walnut Vinegar.—Put green walnut-shells into a brine of salt and water strong enough to float an egg; let them lie covered in this 10 or 12 days; take them out, and lay them in the sun for a week ; put them into a jar, and pour boiling vinegar on them ; in about a week or 10 days pour off the vinegar, make it boiling hot, and pour over them again. In a month it will be fit for use, and will be found excellent to eat with cold meat, and particularly useful in making sauces. Cucumber Vinegar.—Pare and slice 15 large cucumbers, and put them in a stone jar, with 3 pints of vinegar, 4 large onions sliced, 2 or 3 shalots, a little garlic, 2 large spoonfuls of salt, 3 teaspoonfuls of pepper, and £ a teaspoonful of cay- enne. After standing 4 days,* give the whole a boil: when cold, strain, and filter the liquor ^through paper. Camp Vinegar.—Slice a large head of garlic, and put it into a wide-mouthed bottle, with £ oz.- of cayenne, 2 tea-540 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXVI. spoonfuls of real soy, 2 of walnut-ketchup, 4 anchovies chopped, 1 pint of vinegar, and enough cochineal to give it the colour of lavender-drops. Let it stand 6 weeks; then strain off quite clear, and keep in small bottles sealed up. Another.—Infuse in a quart of the best white-wine vine- gar x pint of walnut-ketchup, the same quantity of mush- room-ketchup, and also the same quantity of soy, h oz. of cayenne, 4 heads of garlic, 10 shalots, 2 oz. of black and 2 oz. of white pepper, the same quantity of pimento and ginger, 1 oz. of nutmeg, 3 blades of mace, and 10 cloves, in a wide-mouthed 2-quart bottle ; and cover very closely with cork, leather, and bladder. Let it remain near the fire a month, shaking it frequently. When any is taken out, put in as much fresh vinegar. This is not only a very fine sauce, but a great preservative against infectious diseases, if taken freely. Nasturtium Vinegar.—Pick full- blown nasturtium Howers ; fill a wide-mouthed bottle with them ; add £ a clove of garlic and a moderate-sized shalot chopped ; pour as much vinegar as the bottle will take; in 2 months’ time rub the whole through a fine sieve; add a little cayenne pepper and salt. Tarragon and Elder-flower Vinegar.—Take either the young leaves of tarragon when the plant is going into bloom, or the buds of elder-flowers, and to every i peck put 1 gallon of vinegar, leaving it for a fortnight in a jug to ferment. Then drain it through a flannel bag, put into it a small bit of dissolved isinglass, and bottle it. The flavour of the herbs may also be extracted by boiling the buds or leaves in vinegar, without fermentation : a mix- ture of both is very agreeable. Raspberry Vinegar.—To 1 quart of common vinegar put 2 quarts of fresh raspberries, let them stand 24 hours; then drain them off, but do not squeeze them. Put in 2 quarts more, let them stand as before, and this must be repeated a third time. After which, put the vinegar into a jar, measure it, and to every pint put 1 lb. of lump-sugar. >Set the jar up to the neck in boiling water, and let the vinegar boil for 10 minutes, stirring it frequently. I here should on no account be fewer raspberries than the proportion mentioned, and t ic vinegar will not be fit for use until the following summer. Gooseberry Vinegar.—Boil spring water; and when cold,FAMILY SAUCES. 541 Chap. XXVI.] put to every 3 quarts 1 quart of bruised gooseberries in a large tub. Let them remain 60 hours, stirring often ; then strain through a hair bag, and to each gallon of liquor add 1 lb. of the coarsest sugar. Put it into a barrel, and a toast and yeast; cover the bung-hole with a bit of slate. Set the barrel in the sun, observing that the cask be well painted, and the iron hoops all firm. The greater the quantity of sugar and fruit the stronger the vinegar ; and as this is particularly use- ful for pickles, it might be well to make it of double the strength for that purpose. Chili Vinegar.—Fill a bottle with the chilis or capsi- cums—each of which will impart the proper warmth of flavour—and cover them with vinegar; cork it up closely, let it stand for 3 weeks or a month, then pour off the vinegar, and fill up the bottle again : chilis are the most commonly used, but good capsicums will flavour several additions of vinegar. If capsicums are not procurable, put 1 oz. of cayenne pepper to a quart of vinegar, and let it stand some time, shaking it occasionally. Then strain it off, and fill the bottle up again. LEMON FLA VO URING FOR P UD DINGS. 759. —Peel 6 lemons very thin indeed ; put the peel into a glass bottle, and add a tablespoonful of bitter almonds, blanched, or the same quantity of peach or apricot kernels. Cover the whole with brandy ; shake it frequently, and in a month strain it, and if kept closely corked it will keep for years. MUSHROOM KETCHUP.—E. R. 760. —Take the full-grown flaps of freshly-gathered mush- rooms, crush them with the hands, throw a handful of salt into every peck, and let them stand a night or two ; then put them into pans, and set them in a quick oven for 12 hours; strain them through a hair sieve, and press out all the juice. To every gallon of liquor put of cloves, Jamaica and black pepper, and ginger, 1 oz. each, and i lb. of common salt. Set it on a slow fire, and let it boil until half the liquor is wasted ; then put it into another vessel, and, when cold, strain and bottle it; at the same time corking it up closely, and covering the cork with oiled paper. Or .-—'Fake the largest broad mushrooms, break them intoMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXYI. 542 an earthen pan, strew salt over, and stir them now and then for several days, till there is a thick scum over: strain, and boil the liquor with Jamaica and black peppers, mace, ginger, a clove or two, and some mustard-seed. Cayenne pepper is too hot, but a very little chili vinegar is an improvement. When cold, bottle it, and secure the corks as above, leaving the spice in. At the end of 3 months strain the liquor and boil with fresh spice, which put into the bottles; and in a cool place it will keep 2 or 3 years. Or:—Take a stewpan full of the large flap mushrooms that are not wormeaten, and the skins and fringe of those you have pickled: throw a handful of salt among them, and set them for a few days in a warm room, stirring them occasion- ally. They will produce a great deal of liquor, to which you must put 4 oz. of shalots, 2 cloves of garlic, a good deal of pepper, ginger, mace, cloves, and a few bay-leaves, with a stick of horseradish; boil slowly, and skim very well. When cold, put the whole in a cask without straining, but bung it close up. In 2 months boil it up again with a little fresh spice ; then strain it through a flannel bag, but boil what re- mains in it with a small quantity of strong beer; when strained, either add this to the former, or bottle it separately. It should be kept for some months before being used, but re- mains good for a long time, which mushroom-ketchup rarely does, if not boiled a second time. To all these receipts we strongly recommend the addition ol a moderate quantity of port wine—from 4 pint to not quite a pint to every 4 quarts—both as greatly improving the flavour of the ketchup and ensuring its better preservation. With regard to the spice, care should be taken not to allow it to overpower the natural flavour of the vegetable. WALNUT KETCHUP.—E. R. 761.—Take 200 walnuts at the season for pickling, beat them very small on a marble mortar, add about 6 handfuls ol salt; put them into a clean earthen pan, and stir them 2 or 3 times a day for 10 days or a fortnight. Then strain them through a cloth, pressing them very dry. Then boil up the liquor with mace, cloves, sliefed nutmeg, and whole pepper. When nearly done, add 6 cloves of shalot; bottle and cork it closely. The bottle should be shaken when the ketchup is used.FAMILY SAUCES. 543 Chap. XXVI.] Or :—Take the green shells of ripe walnuts ; to each peck add 1 lb. of common or bay salt, pounded tine ; stir well together, and let them remain for 3 or 4 days, stirring them occasionally that the air may turn them black ;• then boil a gallon of water with 1 lb. of bay salt, and pour over the shells boiling hot; let them stand 8 or 10 days, and pour off' the liquor. Boil well 1 hour, adding, towards the last, 2 oz. of long pepper, the same of black, 2 oz. of shalots cut small, 2 oz. of brown mustard-seed bruised, i oz. of mace and cloves, 4 pint of vinegar, and i lb. of good anchovies. Pour into a jar or cask, and in 2 or 3 months strain and bottle. Walnut-Ketchup of the finest, quality.—Boil or simmer a gallon of the expressed juice of walnuts when they are tender, and skim it well; then put in 2 lbs. of anchovies, bones, and liquor, ditto of shalots, 1 oz. of cloves, ditto of mace, ditto of pepper, and 1 clove of garlic. Let all simmer till the shalots sink; then put the liquor into a pan till cold ; bottle and divide the spice to each. Cork closely, tie the bladder over, and put it in small bottles. It will keep 20 years in the greatest perfection, but is not fit for use the first year. Be very careful to express the juice at home, for it is generally adulterated if bought. Irish mode:—Take a few hundred green walnuts, scoop out all the whites, beat them in a mortar, and strain the juice through a cloth ; let it stand a day and night, strain it, and pour it off clear. To 1 pint of this liquor put i pint of vinegar with 4 lb. of anchovies, and to each pint thus made a clove or two of garlic, 2 or 3 shalots, some horseradish, and 1 onion cut in quarters ; boil it 2 hours, and then strain it off. When strained add to every pint of liquor half f oz. of mace, the same quantity of cloves, of nutmeg, and of whole black pepper, £ pint of port wine, and 2 tablespoonfuls of soy. Boil them together for i an hour. Then pour it oft' into an earthen jar, and let it remain covered until it is cold ; bottle it off' into clean dry bottles, distributing the spice equally in each ; cork it down closely ; take care in boiling to keep the saucepan covered. CUCUMBER KETCHUP.—E. R. 762.—Take an equal quantity of large cucumbers and large onions, pare and slice them; throw over them a handful of salt, and let them stand all night in a sieve placed over a pan.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXVI. 544 Take the liquor and boil it up, with l lb. of anchovies to every dozen of cucumbers, 1 pint of white wine, a nutmeg, £ oz. of mace, and i oz. of whole pepper; strain it, and when cold bottle it; tie it down with bladder. It will keep for 2 years. The Suffolk Receipt.—Take a dozen well-grown cucum- bers and 4 large onions, slice them into an earthen pan with a good handful of salt; let them stand till the liquor begins to run, break them into small pieces, and let the whole stand an- other day and night: then strain it off; to every quart put the same quantity of white, but not sweet wine, ilb. of anchovies, and a large stick of horseradish ; boil them together for i an hour, then strain it again, and to every quart put ± oz. of white pepper, £ the quantity of mace and nutmeg, all pounded, and boil it well again. When cold, bottle it with the spice, and put a piece of ginger into each bottle. A tablespoonful in a sauce- boatful of cream or melted butter makes delicious white sauce for fowls or made dishes of veal. TOM AT A KETCHUP.—E. R. 763. —Take 2 dozen of ripe tomatas and a handful of salt; slice the tomatas, and put a layer into a jar, sprinkle salt over it, then another layer of tomatas and salt, until the jar is full. Stir the contents now and then for 3 or 4 days, keeping the jar in a warm place by the fire; at the expiration of which time press the juice from the tomatas by rubbing them with a wooden spoon through a sieve, and boil it with mace, pepper, allspice, ginger, and cloves, in the proportion of about 2 oz. in all to 1 quart of juice, a few blades of mace, 12 cloves, a spoonful of pounded ginger, and the remainder pepper and all- spice. In 3 months boil it again with fresh spice. Or:—Take 6 lbs. of tomatas, sprinkle them with salt; let them remain for a day or two, then boil them until the skins will separate easily ; pour them into a colander, or coarse sieve, and press them through, leaving the skins behind; put into the liquor 1 handful of shalots, 1 pint of chili vinegar, i pint of wine, pepper, cloves, ginger, and allspice; boil them toge- ther until a third part has wasted ; then bottle it, closing the bottle very securely. It must be shaken before it is used. TOMA TA SA UCE FOR WINTER USE. 764. —1 peck of tomatas, 6 onions sliced, 2 heads of celery, a dozen shalots, 1 oz. of cayenne pepper, i oz. of black pepper,Chap.

CAMP KETCHUP. 765.—Take 2 quarts of old strong beer and 1 of white wine, I add i lb. of anchovies, 3 oz. of shalots peeled, ^ oz. of mace, the same of nutmeg, 3 large races of ginger cut in slices ; put ! all together over a moderate fire till one third is wasted.

Put these ingredients into a wide-mouthed bottle; stop it close, shake it every day for a fortnight, and then strain it off. SEVEN-YEARS KETCHUP. 766.—Take 2 quarts of the oldest strong- beer, put to it 1 i quart of red wine, 1 lb. of anchovies, 3 oz. of shalots peeled, i oz. of mace, the same of nutmegs, i oz. of cloves, 3 large races of ginger cut in slices, and boil all together over a mo- i derate fire till one-third is wasted.

Stop the pot very closely, and put it into an oven, or upon hot ashes, for 24 hours, to allow the whole to infuse properly. Then allow it to settle, and strain it until it is quite clear: bottle it, and close the bottles tightly: a very small quantity will be sufficient, and it may be used with all sorts of meat, game, or fish. ARTIFICIAL SAUCES FOR FISH. 767.—Those most commonly used in England are soy and anchovy, merely mixed from the cruets into melted butter by each individual of the company; the butter, when brought to table in a prepared state, should be made as follows:— For Anchovy Sauce, the foundation should be some of the fish stock or gravy which has been already made and kept in the house for future use. Take 2 or 3 anchovies, scrape, but do not wash them, and boil them along with a minced shalot in some of the gravy, until they are soft enough to be pounded to a paste. Then strain the gravy and thicken it with the body of the fish, after having removed the heads, tails, and bones. When that is done, put it, for about i of an hour, in the stewpan along with a glass of red wine, a squeeze of lemon, and the necessary quantity of butter. The common mode is, to chop 3 anchovies, melt i lb. of butter in a teacupful of the water in which the fish is boiled, add a spoonful of vinegar, and a little flour. Stir it well over the fire until it is quite thick. Or:—Not unfrequently 2 or 3 spoonfuls of the prepared essence of anchovy are put into the melted butter, seasoned with a little cayenne pepper. The savoury store sauces for fish, as prepared and sold in the shops, are all to a certain degree agreeable to some palates,Chap. XXVI.] FAMILY SAUCES. o4/ but anchovy and soy seem the prevailing sort for fish. The former, if purchased from the maker, cannot be counterfeited ; but soy is so often adulterated by the dealers, that the only sure way of getting it genuine is to procure it from the steward of some East India trader when she arrives in the docks. If well corked, it will keep good for years ; and the older, perhaps, the better. There is certainly far less trouble, and probably more eco- nomy, in buying any of these sauces, than in making them at home; but for those ladies who choose to amuse themselves by having such preparations made “ under their own eye,” we add a few receipts that may be found useful. STORE SAUCES. 768.—1. Take 2 wineglasses of port, 2 of walnut and 4 of mushroom ketchup, 4 anchovies pounded, with 2 shalots, a tablespoonful of soy, and a teaspoonful of cayenne pepper. Boil all well together; when cold, put it into bottles well corked; it will keep good for more than a twelvemonth. 2. Take i oz. of mace, 1 oz. each of cloves, ginger, and allspice, 1 lb. of anchovies, a bottle of either white or red wine, i pint of vinegar, a couple of shalots and a clove of garlic chopped, and a stick of scraped horseradish, together with a bundle of pot-herbs. Let all simmer over a slow fire till the anchovies are dissolved; then strain the liquor, bottle it when cold, and when wanted for use add a tablespoonful of tjie sauce to 1 lb. of melted butter. 3. Thicken i lb. of butter with flour, and brown it; then put to it 1 lb. of the best anchovies cut small, 6 blades of pounded mace, 10 cloves, 40 berries of black pepper and allspice, a few small onions, a faggot of sweet herbs (namely, savory, thyme, basil, and knotted marjoram), and a little parsley and sliced horseradish; on these pour £ pint of the best sherry and l£ pint of strong gravy. Simmer all gently for 20 minutes; then strain it through a sieve, and bottle it for use. The way of using it is, to boil some of it in the butter while melting. 4. Put into a saucepan a pint of fine port wine, a gill of mountain, £ pint of fine walnut ketchup, 12 anchovies and the liquor that belongs to them, a gill of walnut pickle, the rind and juice of a large lemon, 4 or 5 shalots, some cayenne to taste, 3 oz. of scraped horseradish, 3 blades of mace, and 2 n 2548 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXYI. 2 teaspoonfuls of made mustard: boil it all gently, till the rawness goes off; then put it into small bottles for use. Cork them very close, and seal the top. 5. Chop 24 anchovies, not washed, and 10 shalots, and scrape 3 spoonfuls of horseradish; which, with 10 blades of mace, 12 cloves, 2 sliced lemons, 4 pint of anchovy liquor, a quart of hock or Rhenish wine, and a pint of water, boil to a quart; then strain off; and when cold, add 3 large spoonfuls of walnut ketchup. All or any of these will be found excellent for family use; as, when added to any common sauce for fish, or even to plain melted butter, a moderate quantity will impart to it a very fine flavour, and in many cases they may be used also for meat, if eaten cold. Pontac Ketchup is for this purpose both very simple and very good. Put ripe elderberries, picked from the stalk, into a stone jar, with as much strong vinegar as will cover them. Bake with the bread ; and, while hot, strain. Boil the liquor with a sufficient quantity of cloves, mace, peppercorns, and shalots, to give it a fine flavour. When that is obtained, put in 4 lb. of the finest anchovies to every quart of liquor ; stir, and boil only until dissolved. When cold, put it into pint bottles, and tie double bladders over each cork. The same method should be observed for preserving all ketchups. An excellent and not common Pickle, called “ Salade,” may be made thus :—Fill a pint stone jar with equal quantities of onions, cucumbers, and sour apples, all cut into very thin slices, shaking in, as you go on, 1 teaspoonful of salt and three parts of a teaspoonful of cayenne. Pour in a wineglass of soy, the same of white wine, and fill up the jar with vinegar. It will be fit for use the same day. Quin's Sauce is also excellent. 4 pint of common mush- room-ketchup, 4 pint of walnut-liquor, 8 anchovies, 8 cloves of garlic, 4 bruised and 4 whole, 3 teaspoonfuls of cayenne pepper, 3 of mushroom-powder, all boiled together for 5 minutes, and bottled when cold. UNIVERSAL SAUCES. 769.—Any of the following will be found good :—1. £ oz. each of black pepper and pounded allspice, 1 oz. of salt, 4 oz. of minced shalot, 1 pint of mushroom-ketchup, a tablespoonful549 Chap. XXVI.] FAMILY SAUCES. of port wine, and a teaspoonful of chili vinegar. Set the bottle for 24 hours in a heat of about 90° of Fahrenheit; let it stand for a week, then strain it off and bottle it. A spoonful mixed with gravy is excellent for cutlets. 2. A wineglass each of mushroom and walnut ketchup, port wine, lemon-pickle, and chili vinegar, with 4 a glass of essence of anchovy. Put all together into a bottle, and shake it well; it will be ready for immediate use, and greatly improve any sauce that needs pungency. 3. Instead of anchovy, put the same quantity of soy, either with or without shalot or garlic vinegar in lieu of lemon- pickle. 4. Mix 2 spoonfuls of Indian soy with 4 pint of vinegar, half 4 oz. of cayenne pepper, and a small quantity of garlic. Let the whole stand for some time in bottle. It will be found an excellent relish for fish or cold meat.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXVII. 550 CHAPTER XXVII. CAKES, BUNS, AND GINGERBREAD. CAKES. 770.— Observations.—In making- cakes it is indispensably ne- cessary that all the ingredients should be heated before they are mixed together; for which purpose everything should be prepared for an hour or two previously to their being wanted, and placed near the fire or upon a stove—the flour thoroughly dried and warmed; the currants, sugar, carraway-seed, and anything else required, heated in the same way; butter and eggs should be beaten in basins fitted into kettles or pans of warm water, which will give them the requisite degree of temperature. Without these precautions, cakes will be heavy; and the best materials, with the greatest pains, will fail to produce the desired results. The following observations should also be strictly attended to:— Currants should be very nicely washed, dried in a cloth, and then set before the fire. If damp, they will make cakes or puddings heavy. Before they are to be used, a dust of dry flour should be thrown among them, and a shake given to them, which causes the cakes to be lighter. Eggs should be very long beaten, whites and yolks apart, and always strained. Sugar should be pounded in a mortar or rubbed to a powder on a clean board, and sifted through a very fine hair or lawn sieve. Lemon-peel should be pared very thin, and, with a little sugar, beaten in a marble mortar to a paste ; and then mixed with a little wine or cream, so as to divide easily among the other ingredients. The pans should be of earthenware; nor should eggs or batter and sugar be beaten in tins, as the cold- uess of the metal will prevent them from becoming light.Chap. XXVII.] CAKES. 5o 1 Use no flour but the best superfine; for if the flour be of inferior quality the cakes will be heavy, ill-coloured, and unfit to eat: but if a little potato-flour be added, it will improve their lightness. Cakes are frequently rendered hard, heavy, and uneatable, by misplaced economy in eggs and butter, or for want of a due seasoning in spice and sugar. After all the articles are put into the pan, they should be thoroughly and long beaten, as the lightness of the cake de- pends much on their being well incorporated. Unless you are provided with proper utensils as well as materials, the difficulty of making cakes will be so great as in most instances to be a failure. Accuracy in proportioning the ingredients is also indispensable ; and therefore scales, weights, and measures, down to the smallest quantity, are of the utmost importance. Iron ovens are desirable, as well for their economy of fuel as for the short time in which they can be heated, and on account of the celerity and convenience with which one person may prepare large quantities of small pastry, and bake it also. The most vigilant care and attention are necessary in order to secure success in the baking of delicate pastry or cakes ; for however well they may have been prepared, if not equally well baked, the result will be unsatisfactory; we there- fore recommend a newly- invented moveable oven, made of iron, as represented in the cut ; it is manufac- tured in Paris, but will no doubt be soon copied in London. The hearth, at a, is placed underneath ; and the smoke of a charcoal fire escapes through a flue at the back, after heating the oven, b, by means of a flue passing round it. It also may be made to act as a stove for many other purposes.1 The heat of the oven is of great importance, especially for large cakes. If not lighted long enough to have a body of heat, or if it is become slack, the cake will be heavy. If n ‘ La Cuisinifcre (le la Campagne,’ p. 26.552 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXVII. not pretty quick, the batter will not rise. Should you fear its catching by being too quick, put some paper over the cake to prevent its being burnt. To know when it is soaked, take a broad-bladed knife that is very bright, and plunge it into the very centre; draw it instantly out, and if the least stickiness adheres, put the cake immediately in again, and shut up the oven. If the heat should be sufficient to raise, but not to soak it, let fresh fuel be quickly put in, and the cakes kept hot until the oven is fit to finish the soaking; but those who are em- ployed ought to be particularly careful that no mistake occurs from negligence when large cakes are to be baked. Bread and cakes wetted with milk eat best when new, but become stale sooner than others. Cakes kept in drawers or wooden boxes have a disagreeable taste. Earthen pans and covers, or tin boxes, preserve them best; but in making large cakes of any kind, which are to be baked in hoops, use those of wood. Cakes made with yeast should always be eaten fresh. PLUM-CAKES. 771.—Mix thoroughly t peck of fine flour, well dried, with 1 lb. of dry and sifted loaf-sugar, 3 lbs. of currants washed and very dry, <j lb. of raisins stoned and chopped, } oz. each of mace, cloves, and cinnamon, a grated nutmeg, the peel of a lemon cut as fine as possible, and £ lb. of almonds blanched and beaten with orange-flower water. Melt 2 lbs. of butter in li pint of cream, but not hot; put to it 1 pint of sweet wine, a glass of brandy, and another of rose-water, with the whites and yolks of 12 eggs beaten apart, and pint of good yeast. Strain this liquor by degrees into the dry ingredients, beating them together a full hour; then butter the hoop or pan, and bake it in a moderate oven for at least 4 hours. As you put in the batter, throw in plenty of citron, lemon, and orange candy. If you ice the cake, when it is nearly cold pour the icing over, and return it to the oven, where it should be left all night, or until it becomes cold ; but if the oven be warm, keep it near the mouth, and the door open, lest the colour be spoiled ; or the icing may be left until the next morning. Or:—Take 2 lbs. of dried flour, the same of currants, 1 lb. of pounded sugar, lemon and citron peel sliced ; mix these wellChap. XXVII.] CAKES. 553 together; beat 10 eggs, yolks and whites separately; then melt li lb. of butter and 1 pint of cream; when lukewarm, put to it i pint of ale-yeast, nearly i pint of sweet wine, and the eggs ; then strain the liquid to the dry ingredients, beat them well, and add of cloves, mace, cinnamon, and nutmeg, all together 1 oz.; butter the pan, and put it into a quick oven ; 3 hours will bake it, if the oven be of baker’s heat, but it will be better if baked somewhat longer at a more moderate temperature. An excellent Plum-cake.—Beat 1 lb. of fresh butter with a strong wooden fork until it resembles cream ; add 1 lb. of sifted sugar, and mix them very completely ; have ready the whites of 10 eggs beaten, and pour them into the butter and sugar; then add the yolks of 18 eggs, also well beaten, and beat them all up for 10 minutes. Take 1 lb. of flour, 2 oz. of pounded and sifted spices (viz. cloves, mace, cinnamon, nut- meg, and allspice), and mix them by degrees with the other ingredients;, then beat the whole 10 minutes longer, and when the oven is ready add 1 lb. of currants, 4 oz. of sliced almonds, i lb. of raisins stoned and chopped, and a large glass of brandy. Bake the cake in a hot oven. When sufficiently baked, let the oven cool, and afterwards put in the cake, and allow it to remain for several hours to dry. Very good common Plum-cakes.—Mix 5 oz. of butter in 3 lbs. of dry flour and 5 oz. of fine Lisbon sugar; add 6 oz. of currants washed and dried, and some pimento finely powdered. Put 3 spoonfuls of yeast into a pint of new milk warmed, and mix into a light dough with the above. Make it into 12 cakes, and bake on a floured tin i an hour. Plum-cakes require less butter and eggs for having yeast, and eat equally light and rich. If the leaven be only of flour, milk and water, and yeast, it becomes more tough, and is less easily divided, than if the butter be first put with those ingre- dients, and the dough afterwards set to rise by the fire. Little Plum-cakes to keep long.—Dry 1 lb. of flour, and mix Avith 6 oz. of finely-pounded sugar; beat 6 oz. of butter to a cream, and add to 3 eggs, well beaten, 4 lb. of currants washed and nicely dried, and the flour and sugar; beat all for some time, then dredge flour on tin plates, and drop the batter on them the size of a walnut. If properly mixed, it will be a stiff paste. Bake in a brisk oven.oo4 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXVIT.

Having 4 lb. of stoned jar-raisins chopped as fine as possible, mix them carefully, so that there should be no lump, and add a teacupful of orange-flower water; beat the ingredients to- gether a full hour at least. Have a hoop well buttered; take a white paper, doubled and buttered, and put in the pan round the edge; do not fill it more than three parts with batter, as space should be allowed for rising. Bake in a quick oven. It will require full 3 hours. In making cakes of a larger size, put at the rate of 8 eggs to every pound of flour, and other in- gredients in the same proportion. The cake must be covered with an icing. QUEEN-CAKE. ' 773.-—Mix 1 lb. of dried flour, the same of sifted sugar and of washed currants.

If the oven is hot, £ an hour will bake it. The moment it is taken out of the oven turn it out of the mould, and let it lie upside down until quite cold. Great care should be taken in the baking. Plain Cake.—4 lbs. of flour, 2 lbs. of currants, and 4 lb. of butter, with clove, carraway, and coriander seeds to the taste, together with lemon-peel grated; wet it with milk and i pint of yeast. Or :—Beat 1 lb. of butter to a cream with the hand, and add 1 lb. of brown sugar, which beat in for 10 minutes longer; then add 8 eggs, 2 at a time, beating them as they are put in until the whole is very smooth; then stir in 1J lb. of flour, a little at a time, till it is well mixed; season with a little nut- meg, and add 1 lb. of currants the last thing, together with citron and orange peel cut into pieces. Put the ingredients into a shape, and bake it for 2 hours. An excellent Cake.—Rub 2 lbs. of dry fine flour with 1 lb. of butter washed in plain, and afterwards in rose-water; mix it with 3 spoonfuls of yeast in a little warm milk and water. Set it to rise li hour before the fire; then beat into it 2 lbs. of currants, 1 lb. of sugar sifted, 4 oz. of almonds, 6 oz. of stoned raisins chopped fine, k a nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, and a few cloves, the peel of a lemon chopped as fine as pos- sible, a glass of wine, the same of brandy, 12 yolks and whites of eggs beaten separately; add orange, citron, and lemon.

By the addition of 1 oz. of butter or sugar, or an egg or two, you may make the cake richer. A teacupful of raw cream improves it much. Bake it in a pan ; it will remain good for several days; and if carraways be substituted for currants, it may be eaten at tea with butter. SAVOY CAKE. 777.—Break 10 very fresh eggs into a pan (a round-bot- tomed biscuit pan is best for the purpose) with I lb. of sifted loaf-sugar ; set the pan in warm water and whisk very briskly for i of an hour, or until the batter is quite thick and warm ; take it out of the water and whisk until cold ; stir in as lightly as possible to thoroughly mix it, 1 lb. of flour ; flavour with essence of lemon, or the rind of a lemon rubbed on sugar ; pour into the mould and bake. Prepare the mould as follows :—Melt a little fresh butter, take off the scum, and pour it off' the dregs ; let it cool, and with a brush (a painter’s small brush is very good for the purpose) rub it well, so that it looks creamy, into all the points of the mould, and dust it with sugar and flour, mixed in equal quantities, sufficient to adhere to the batter. The same preparation is used for Sponge Cakes, baking them of course in proper moulds. Or .-—Take 8 eggs, i the whites, f lb. of lump-sugar, a lb. of flour, i pint of water, the peel of a lemon ; mix as follows :— Over night pare a good-sized lemon thin, and put the peel into the water; when about to make the cake, put the sugar into a saucepan, pour the water and lemon-peel to it, and let it stand by the fire to get hot. Break the eggs into a deep earthen \essel that has been made quite hot ^ whisk the eg^s for a few minutes with a whisk that has been well soaked in water; make the sugar and water boil up, and pour it boiling hot over the eggs ; continue to whisk them briskly for about i of an hour, or till they become quite thick and white, which is a proof of their lightness.

Cut pieces of paper the size and shape of the dish to be used, spread the paste upon them, put it into the oven, and let it bake, but not enough to be brown ; then spread each with jam made of fruit, and a little jelly, and pile one upon the other. Let it remain until quite cold, and, some hours afterwards, add a fresh quantity of sugar to the whites of eggs; pour it over the top, and ornament it with preserved orange and lemon chips, coloured sugar-plums, &c., and let it stand in a cool oven to dry. Or :—Take 4 layers of fine sponge-cake, not quite 1 inch thick ; or the sponge-mixing may be baked at once in a round shape, about 6 or 8 inches in diameter, and afterwards divided into slices. Put between each layer of cake one of preserves, each of a different sort, with strawberries at the top ; and cover the whole cake, top and sides, with a thick icing of sugar, similar to that used in bridecake, tinted red, and fla- voured with essence of lemon, rose, or vanilla.

When all the ingredients are mixed, beat them 4 an hour longer, then put it into a well-buttered tin ; 14 hour will bake it. Or:—Mix 10 oz. of ground rice, 3 oz. of flour, 8 oz. ol pounded sugar; then sift by degrees into 8 yolks and 6 whites of eggs, and the peel of a lemon shred so fine that it is quite mashed ; mix the whole well in a tin stewpan over a very slow fire with a whisk, then put it immediately into the oven in the same, and bake 40 minutes. Or:—Take 4 lb. of clarified butter, 8 eggs well beaten, leaving out the whites of 2, f lb. of pounded sugar, and the grated peel of a lemon; mix these well together; then add ground rice and dried flour, 4 lb. of each; currants and can- died peel may be added when approved. WAFERS.—E. R. 780. —Take fine flour, dried and sifted, make it into a smooth thin batter with very good milk, or a little cream and water; add about as much white wine as will make it thick enough for pancakes, sweeten it with a little loaf-sugar, and flavour with beaten cinnamon. When thus prepared, have the wafer- irons made ready by being heated over a charcoal fire; rub the irons with a piece of linen cloth dipped in butter, then pour a spoonful of the batter upon them, and close them almost immediately; turn them upon the fire, pare the edges with a knife, as some of the batter will ooze out. A short time will bake them when the irons are properly heated. The wafers must be curled round whilst warm. Sugar-wafers, which are much in use throughout France and Spain for eau-sucree, are made by whisking white sugar into a froth with the white of eggs and isinglass, and then baking it as above.

When dry on both sides, take some sifted sugar and as much white of egg as will just wet it; beat it with a spoon ; as it grows white put in a little more egg, till it is thin enough to ice the cakes ; then ice one side, dry it before the fire, and be sure it is quite dry lxefore icing the other side. The flavour of the almond is often given to pastry by bay-leaves and the essence of fruit-kernels, but pounded bitter almonds are safer and better for the purpose. Ratafia Cakes are made in the same manner, but substitute ratafia-brandy for rose-water, and use i lb. of bitter instead of the same quantity of sweet almonds; make them rather smaller. * JUMBLES. 785. —To li lb. of butter, well creamed, put 1 lb. of sugar and 3 eggs beaten well together, 14 lb. of sifted flour, and 2 spoonfuls of rose-water; mix these well together, and with a fork drop them on a tin, and bake in a quick oven.

Without butter.—Warm i pint of water, flavoured with a little salt; mix 4 beaten eggs with i lb. of Hebrew or “ matso-flour,” and a couple of lumps of white sugar with a teacupful of milk; mix all together, and bake in a tin. SCOTCH RECEIPT FOR SHORT-BREAD.—E. R. 787. —To 4 lbs. of flour take 2 of butter, quite fresh and without salt, i lb. of moist sugar, i lb. of citron, and the same of almonds, the latter blanched, and all cut small. Mix the sugar and fruit well with the flour, then work it up with the butter, cold, till it is smooth and compact, but it will take a long time ; ( divide into 4 or more pieces, and roll out each piece into an oblong cake, having previously floured the table well. Prick the top with a steel fork, strew some orange and citron cut thin, and some large carraway-comfits, press them in with the roller, then pinch round the edges, put the cakes in floured tins ; bake for 20 minutes. If the cake rise after the pressing of the finger, it is sufficiently done. Or :—One lb. each of butter and sifted sugar, 2 lbs. of flour, 8 oz. of sweet and 4 oz. of bitter almonds, a small piece of cin- namon, all pounded, and a glass of brandy. Soften the butter before the fire, then rub in the flour, and make it into a paste ; roll it out i inch thick, and bake it on a tin in a slow oven, as it should be of a pale colour. A GOOD POUND-CAKE. 788. —Beat 1 lb. of butter to a cream, and mix with it the whites and yolks of 8 eggs beaten apart. Have ready, warm by the fire, 1 lb. of flour, and the same of sifted sugar ; mix them and a few cloves, a little nutmeg and cinnamon, in fine powder together ; then by degrees work the dry ingredients into the butter and eggs. When well beaten, add a glass of wine and some carraways. It must be beaten a full hour. Butter a pan, and bake it an hour in a quick oven. The above proportions, leaving out 4 oz. of the butter, and the same of sugar, make a less luscious cake, and to most tastes a more pleasant one.i Chap. XXVII. 563 CAKES. LEMON-CAKE. 789. —-Beat 6 eggs, the yolks and whites separately, till in a ' solid froth ; add to the yolks the grated rind of a fine lemon i and 6 oz. of sugar dried and sifted ; beat this 1 of an hour ; ; shake in with the left hand 6 oz. of dried flour; then add the I whites of the eggs and the juice of the lemon ; when these are t well beaten in, put it immediately into tins, and bake it about an hour in a moderately hot oven. SODA-CAKE.—E. R. 790. —1 lb. of flour, 1 drachm of soda, lb. of sugar, !| ^ lb. of currants, and i lb. of butter. Mix the soda with the ■ flour, then rub in the butter, after which add the sugar and the : currants, and then a pint of milk. Put it into the oven irame- | diately. A variety may be given by substituting f lb. of lemon, i orange, and citron, candied, and 1 oz. of pounded sweet almonds, I for the currants; but in that case the cake will require rather I more soda. Or :—A good plain one can be made with 2 lbs. of flour, 8 * oz. of butter or dripping, 8 oz. of sugar, 1 pint of milk, with ) 3 or 4 eggs, and a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda. Carbonate I of soda should be very sparingly used in light cakes, and then I it .ought to be combined with a little sour milk, or acid, to I produce carbonic gas, in order to make them porous. Mix the i carbonate of soda intimately with the flour or sugar, then mix them with the other ingredients, and make the whole into a 5 dough with the milk, or milk and eggs well beaten ; put it into ! a well-buttered tin or hoop, and bake it in a cool oven about I 3 hours. If currants are added, it will take fully that time. ! A good plan to ensure the sides and bottom from being burnt | is to tie a piece of paper folded in 3 or 4 folds round the sides, j and put the tin or hoop on a flat baking tin, with a little saw- I dust or fine ashes between.

Les Brioches are, in France, more used as a breakfast- bread than as cakes, but in England they are only to be had, when ordered, in the shops of some foreign pastry-cooks; which is to be regretted, as they are considered a great deli- cacy when made in the form of twists or other fancy shapes, and eaten either hot or cold. Take any quantity of the brioche paste (as at No. 542); knead it over-night, and cover it in a warm place, to allow it to rise; then, at a convenient hour for breakfast, knead it again, and if not sufficiently risen, add an egg and a little more yeast, make it into shapes, and bake them for f to 1 hour, according to their size. Frangipane is a French paste, made with 2 or 3 eggs put into a saucepan with 1 tablespoonful of flour, moistened with a little milk, and placed on the fire for about 10 minutes; taking care to stir the materials continually, to prevent them from sticking to the pan. The substance may either be used as a paste for tartlets, or eaten as cakes, if made with sugar and macaroons. La Galette is in great favour among the Parisians, who usually eat it with sweetmeats, but vary it in point of richness by the greater or less quantity of cream and butter employed in making it up. It is thus made:— Take 1 lb. each of butter and flour, a little salt, and 2 eggs; knead the whole together into a paste, roll it to not more than an inch in thickness, and make it the size of a dessert- plate. Then put it into the oven for } of an hour ; take it out; beat up 2 eggs with a little cream and some salt, pour it over the cake, and return it to the oven to bake for another £ of an hour; or, if you please, ornament the back with candied citron.

Butter small tin pans and half fill. IRISH CAKE. 793.—Take 1 lb. of butter beaten to a cream, t lb. of sugar sifted and dried, 9 eggs, the yolks and whites beaten separately, i lb. of almonds blanched and sliced, 1 f lb. of cun-ants picked and dried, the same weight of flour also dried. When the but- ter has been worked with the hand to a cream, sift hi the sugar, which should be quite hot; when mixed pour in the yolks of eggs, then add the whites; work it 4 an hour, then add the flour by degrees; when thoroughly mixed, add a very small teac.upful of brandy. The currants and almonds, with i lb. of lemon or citron peel, should be added just before the cakes are placed in the oven, which should be hot. The cake should be beaten an hour; the hand should be kept moving the same way, and not taken out. ISLE OF WIGHT CRACKNELS. *794.—Mix with a quart of flour 4- a nutmeg grated, the yolks of 4 eggs beaten, with 4 spoonfuls of rose-water, into a stiff paste, with cold water ; then roll in 1 lb. of butter, and make them into a cracknel shape; put them into a kettle of boiling water, and boil them till they swim; ’then take them out and put them into cold water; when hardened, lay them out to dry, and bake them on tin plates. KRINGLES. 795. —Beat well the yolks of 8 and whites of 2 eggs, and mix with 4 oz. of butter just warmed, and with this knead 1 lb. of flour and 4 oz. of sugar to a paste.

Work it well, and divide it into small loaves or cakes, about 5 or 6 inches wide, and flatten them. When baked, and cold, slice them the thickness of rusks, and put them in the oven to brown a little. The cakes, when first baked, eat deliciously if but- tered for tea; or, made with carraways, to eat cold. BENTON TEA-CAKES. 797. —Mix a paste of flour, a little bit of butter, and milk ; roll as thin as possible, and bake on a back-stone over the fire, or on a hot hearth. Another sort as Biscuits.—Rub into 1 lb. of flour 6 oz. of butter and 3 large spoonfuls of yeast, and make it into a paste with a sufficient quantity of new milk ; make into biscuits, and prick them with a clean fork. Or :—Melt 6 or 7 oz. of butter, with a sufficiency of new milk warmed to make 7 lbs. of flour into a stiff paste ; roll thin and make into biscuits. COFFEE-CAKES. 798. —Take 1 lb. of flour, i lb. of butter, the same of pounded sugar, 1 egg, and 1 oz. of carraway-seeds ; mix the whole with warm milk and a tablespoonful of rose-water; roll it out thin, and cut it into cakes with the top of a wineglass, and bake on tins. BISCUITS. 799,.—Those of the common sort are made in various ways. For a large quantity, beat up 8 eggs during nearly ^ an hour; then put in 1 lb. of white powdered sugar, with the grated peel of a lemon, and whisk that again for the same time, or until it appears well mixed ; after which make it into a batter with 1 lb. of flour and a little rose-water. Bake the dough in tins, or on papers, and either sugar them or put in carraways at your pleasure. Or :—1 lb. of flour, i lb. of loaf-sugar, and i lb. of butter ; rub all together; wet it. with 1 egg beaten up in i a teacupfu of milk, and roll it out thin.Chap. XXVII.] BISCUITS. 567 Or:—Put the same quantities of flour, sugar, and butter ; but, instead of milk, moisten them with brandy. You may cut the dough into shapes with the edge of a wineglass, and prick them over before going to the oven. Ginger Biscuit.—Work well If lb. of butter with the same weight of moist sugar; add 8 eggs well beaten ; stir in 2^ lbs. of flour, 1 oz. of volatile salts, and i oz. of ground ginger; mix these well, roll out the paste, cut it in fancy shapes, and bake crisp. Or:— Beat 1 lb. of butter to a froth, 1| lb. of moist sugar, 2 oz. of ground ginger, and a grated nutmeg; mix it up with as much flour as will make it into a stiff paste ; roll it out thin, and cut it into small cakes; bake in a quick oven. Tea Biscuits are made with the finest flour, fresh butter sea- soned with a little salt, and melted in warm milk: for a mo- derate quantity, 1 lb. of flour, 2 oz. of butter, and 1 pint of milk will be sufficient. Make it into a stiff paste, adding to it a large tablespoonful of strong brewers’ yeast, and leave it covered near the fire during time enough to make it rise. When quite light knead it well, roll it out an inch thick, and form it into round cakes of the size of a muffin. Bake them in buttered pans until they are of a light brown; split and butter them and send them to table hot. If intended to be kept and eaten cold, the paste must be rolled out very thin, and cut of a smaller size. Swiss Biscuits.—Mix 4 oz. of fine flour, 2 oz. of sifted sugar, the grated peel of a lemon, and ^ lb. of butter, to a paste, with the white of an egg, and a sufficient quantity of milk. Roll it thin, cut into biscuits, and brush them over with the yolk of an egg, over which sift fine sugar: bake them on tins. Biscuits to keep a long time.—Mix 2 lbs. of flour, 1 lb. of sugar, and 1 oz. of carraways, with 4 or 5 eggs and a few spoonfuls of water, to make a stiff paste: roll it thin, and cut it into any shape. Bake on tins lightly floured. While baking, boil 1 lb. of sugar, in a pint of water, to a thin syrup : while both are hot, dip each cake into it, and put them on tins into the oven to dry for a short time; when the oven is cooler still, return them there again, and let them stay 4 or 5 hours. If kept dry they will be good for months. White Cakes.—Dry ^ lb. of flour, rub into it a very little568 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXVII. pounded sugar, 1 oz. of butter, 1 egg, a few carraways, and as much milk and water as to make a paste; roll it thin, and cut it with the top of a canister or wineglass. Bake 15 minutes on tin plates. Wine Biscuits.—Rub into 1 lb. of dry flour 4 oz. of but- ter, 4 oz. of white powdered sugar, 1 egg, and a spoonful or two of thin cream to make it into a paste. When mixed, put currants into one half, and carraways into the rest. Cut them as before, and bake on tins. Another.—Rub f lb. of fresh butter in 14 lb. of sifted flour, and make it into a dough with a little cold water. Roll it out into a sheet 4 inch thick, and cut it into round cakes with the edge of a tumbler. Prick them with a fork ; lay them in a shallow iron pan sprinkled with flour, and bake them in a moderate oven till they are brown. Send them to table warm. The introduction into England of the American soda-bis- cuits or crackers having caused several inquiries to be made for other American biscuits or cakes, we subjoin the follow- ing approved receipts:— Cookies.—One lb. of butter, 4 lb. of sugar, 2 teaspoonfuls (or 3 drachms) of saleratus, 3 lbs. of flour, and about a pint of buttermilk, or milk that is slightly sour may be used instead ; flavour the whole with ground coriander-seed ac- cording to taste. Cinnamon, ginger, or nutmeg, may be sub- stituted for the coriander if desired. Warm the buttermilk, and dissolve the saleratus in it by stirring. The sugar may be boiled in 4 pint of water, and allowed to cool before using, when less buttermilk must be used, and the butter must be rubbed small with the flour; or beat the butter and sugar to- gether in a pan to a nice cream; add the other ingredients, and make into a paste. Make into rolls 4 inch thick, and cut into what shape you please; or roll out the paste to the same thickness, and cut it into any desired form. Bake from 20 minutes to 4 an hour in a moderately cool oven. The same preparation, with only half the quantity of butter and sugar, and 4 pint more milk or water, makes a most excellent cake (superior to soda) for tea, or for children, to which carraway- seeds or currants may be added. Waffles are likewise in very general use among the Ame- ricans, and are made thus :— Put 2 pints of rich milk into separate pans; cut up and meltChap. XXVII.] BUNS. 569 in one of them i lb. of butter, warming it slightly; then, when it is melted, set it away to cool; beat 8 eggs very light, and mix them gradually into the other pan of milk alternately with i lb. of flour; then mix in by degrees the milk that has the butter in. Lastly, stir in a large tablespoonful of strong fresh yeast, cover the pan, and set it near the fire to rise. When the batter is quite light, heat your waffle-iron, by putting it among the coals of a clear bright fire; grease the inside with butter tied in a rag, and then put in some batter. Shut the iron closely, and, when the waffle is done on one side, turn the iron on the other. Take the cake out by slipping a knife un- derneath, and then heat and grease the iron for another waffle. Send them to table quite hot, 4 or 6 on a plate, having but- tered them and strewed over each a mixture of powdered cin- namon and white sugar. Or you may send the sugar and cin- namon in a little glass bowl.a ICING FOR CAKES. 800.—Beat the whites of 4 eggs to a solid froth, add gra- dually 1 lb. of refined sugar pounded and sifted; mix in the juice of ^ a lemon ; beat it till very light and white. The cake should be cold. Place it before the fire, pour over it the icing, and smooth over the top and sides with a knife. It might be set to dry at the mouth of a cool oven. BUNS. 801.— To make a good plain Bun.—Rub 4 oz. of butter into 2 lbs. of flour, 4 oz. of sugar, a nutmeg, or not, as you like, a few Jamaica peppers, a dessertspoonful of carraways ; put a spoonful or two of cream into a cup of yeast, and as much good milk as will make the above into a light paste. Set it to rise by a fire till the oven be ready. They will quickly bake on tins. For richer Buns.—Mix H lb. of dried flour with i lb. of sugar, melt 1 lb. and 2 oz. of butter in a little warm water, add 6 spoonfuls of rose-water, and knead the above into alight “ The common sort of waffle-irons, which bake but two at once arc much the best; they may be got of any of the Jewish ironmongers. ’MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY.

Madeira Buns.—Beat 8 oz. of butter to a cream, to which add 2 eggs long beaten. Have ready 14 oz. of flour, 6 oz. of lump-sugar sifted, 4 a nutmeg, 1 teaspoonful of sifted ginger, and a large spoonful of carraway-seeds, and, after mixing, work them well into tiie butter ; beat it 4 an hour; then add a large wineglass of sherry. Bake in tin pattypans in a mo- derately quick oven. Spanish Buns.—Take 1 lb. of fine flour, rub into it 4 lb. of butter; add 4 lb. of sugar, the same of currants, a little nutmeg, mace, and cinnamon ; mix it with 5 eggs well beaten ; make this up into small buns, and bake them on tins 20 minutes ; when half done brush them over with a little hot milk. Bath Buns.—The following is the original receipt:— To 4 lb. of fine flour put 4 yolks and 3 whites of eggs, with 4 spoonfuls of solid yeast (care must be taken that it is not bitter). Beat it well in a bovd, and set it before the fire to rise. Then rub into 1 lb. of flour 10 oz. of good butter, put in 4 lb. of sugar, and carraway comfits; when the eggs and yeast are pretty light, mix by degrees all well together, throw a cloth over it, and set it before the fire again to rise. Then make your buns, and when you have put them on the tins, brush them over with the yolk of egg and milk ; strew them with carraway-comfits, and bake them in a quick oven. A rich Scotch Bun.—4 lbs. of flour {half a peck of Scotch), 2 lbs. of raisins stoned and cut, and 2 lbs. of currants. Take 6 oz. of orange-peel, the same of citron, and of almonds blanched and cut; mix all these together. Take 1 drachm of cloves, a large nutmeg, 4oz. of allspice, and the same of ginger; pound them, strew the spice on the fruit, and mix them very well.571 Chap. XXVII.] GINGERBREAD. Make a hole in the flour, break in nearly H lb. of butter, pour warm water on the butter to soften it a little; then work the flour and butter together, spread the paste, and pour in i pint of good yeast; work it up very well until the paste is light and smooth. Cut off about a third part of the paste for the sheets, spread out the rest of the paste on the table, put the fruit on it, pour about a gill of yeast over the fruit and paste, and work the fruit and paste very well together. Then make it up round ; roll out the sheet which was reserved in a circular form, lay the bun on the middle, and gather the sheet round it; roll it out to the desired thickness, run a fork through in different parts down to the bottom, and pinch it on the top. Flour double grey paper and put the bun upon it, give it a cut round the side, put a binder of double paper round it to keep it from running too thin in the oven. Bake in a moderate oven. Or:—For the plainer sort, to 2 lbs. of flour add 1 lb. of butter, melt the butter, and make the flour into dough with it And about a gill of good yeast. Make it into cakes £ inch in thickness, adding ilb. of lump-sugar beaten, and l^oz. ofcar- raway-seeds on the top. Let the dough lie on the table after it is cut out until it becomes stiff, which will not take long, and then put it into the oven. GINGERBREAD. 802.—This is amongst the most ancient species of cake known throughout England and the north of Europe. In this country it is rarely eaten, except by children, but in Holland it is the common accompaniment of the “ schnaps and in Ghent there are shops as famous for it as our “ Leman ” for biscuits. The following are selected from amongst the numerous ways of making it:— Take 1 lb. of treacle, 1 lb. of butter, 2 lbs. of flour, 1 oz. of ground ginger, sliced candied orange, and a glass of brandy. If not intended to be rich, omit i the butter, the brandy, and lemon, and make it of rye flour, household flour, or oatmeal. At Leeds it is made with equal quantities of oatmeal and treacle, mixed with an eighth part of melted butter and brown sugar, and 1 oz. of powdered ginger, witli ^ that quan- tity of other spice, to 4 lbs. of meal.

The treacle should be perfectly,sweet, for, if in the least degree sour or too thick, the bread ’frill be indifferent in flavour and appearance. Ginger, too, should be fresh ground, as it loses much of its strength by keeping. When baked, the tin must be well buttered to make the cake come out; aud when done, a fork, if thrust into it, will come out clean. « Another sort.—To £ lb. of treacle beat 1 egg strained ; mix 4 oz. of brown sugar, $ oz. of ginger sifted ; of cloves, mace, allspice, nutmeg, i oz. together, beaten as fine as possible; coriander and carraway seeds, each \ oz.; melt 1 lb. of butter, and mix with the above; and add as much Hour as will knead into a pretty stiff paste; then roll it out, and cut into cakes. Bake on tin plates in a quick oven. A little time will bake them. A good plain sort.—Mix 3 lbs. of flour with A lb. of butter, 4 oz. of brown sugar, £ oz. of pounded ginger ; then make into a paste with l£ lb. of treacle warm. A good sort, without butter.—Mix 2 lbs. of treacle; of orange, lemon, citron, and candied ginger, each 4 oz., all thinly sliced ; 1 oz. of coriander-seeds, 1 oz. of carraways, and 1 oz. of beaten ginger, in as much hour as will make a soft paste ; lay it in cakes on tin plates, and bake it in a quick oven. Keep it dry, and it will be good for some months. Imperial Gingerbread.—Rub 6 oz. of butter into ■£ lb. of flour, then mix 6 oz. of treacle with a pint of cream carefully, lest it should turn the cream ; mix in * lb. of double-refined sugar, A oz. of powdered ginger, and 1 oz. of carraway-seeds; stir the whole well together into a paste, cut it into shapes, and stick cut candied orange or lemon peel on the top. Lemon Gingerbread.—Grate the rinds of 2 or 3 lemons, and add the juice to a glass of brandy : then mix the grated lemon in 1 lb.' of flour, make a hole in the flour, pour in A lb. of treacle, i lb. of butter melted, the lemon-juice and brandy, and mix all up together with A oz. of ground ginger and i oz. of cayenne pepper.

On the making of bread a few previous observations are ne- cessary. FLOUR. 804.—With regard to that most essential object, the quality of the flour, we need hardly insist that it should' not only be good but of the best corn, that being the best economy, both in point of price, and the kind, as well as quantity, of the bread made from it. Cheap bread must ever be of indifferent quality. The flour of which it is made is always ground either from damaged wheat, or that of the most inferior kind, mixed by the miller with a little of the better sort, and made up by the baker with potato starch, alum, and soda, to render it apparently good. If you grow your own wheat, winnow it, screen it, scutch it, air it, and do not send it to the mill until 12 months old: even then, do not trust it to the miller, unless under your own eye or that of a confidential servant. The value of wheaten flour consists, besides its purity, in the quantity which it contains of that portion of the grain termed “ gluten,” of which there is more in that grown in the southern climates than in those of the north; which may in some degree account for the superiority ascribed to the Ame- rican flour imported into this country from Virginia.11 The flour should never be made from corn that is not some months old, and should be kept in a dry part of the house for a few weeks before being baked. Household Bread of very wholesome quality may be made with coarser flour, or even by merely screening off the out- n The American flour imbibes more water than the English on making it into bread ; for it has been stated, in comparative experiments, that a stone of 14 lbs. weight of the American flour will make 21 lbs. of bread, but the best sort of English flour only produces about 18£ lbs.57 5 BREAD. Chap. XXVIII.] ward bran of the wheat, and making the whole into loaves, without sifting the flour into the different sorts of fineness. It is looked upon by medical men as a good remedy for in- digestion ; and the different effects created by the constant use of white or brown bread have been thus stated :— “ Mistaken notions respecting the quality of different sorts of bread have given rise to much waste. The general belief is, that the bread made of the finest flour is the best, and that whiteness is the proof of its quality : but both these opinions are popular errors. The whiteness may be, and generally is, communicated by alum, to the injury of the consumer; and it is well known by men of science that the bread of unrefined flour will sustain life, while that made with the refined, will not. Keep a man on brown bread and water, and lie will live and enjoy good health; give him white bread and water only, and he will gradually sicken, and probably in a short time die.”a Brown Bread, when divested of the coarser bran, not only merits this preference in point of digestion, but is even thought to nourish better, as proved by the experience of sailors on long voyages, who are always furnished with bis- cuits made from unrefined flour, and are both strong and healthy. It should be made of unbolted wheat-meal, into 3 quarts of which should be put a gill each of yeast and mo- lasses, with a quart of lukewarm water, and a teaspoonful of pearlash. This quantity will make as much as 2 loaves, when made in the usual mode of household bread. Bran, indeed, contains few nutritious parts, but then it contains the essential oil and the larger portion of the saline substances of the vegetable. The grain is furnished with two membranes or husks, the second or inner of which is the principal seat of the oil; and it is this oil which imparts that 1 agreeable smell to brown bread so superior to white. In grinding the grain, a large portion of the first skin is divided from the second, and mixes very intimately with the rest; the first is an indigestible husk, a great part of which will be separated by rejecting a third part of the bran, or by scuffling it rapidly in a circular turning machine of wire, the motion ol' which throws off' the outer husk; the finer parts, being thus intermixed, greatly facilitate the digestion of the bread by dividing its more glutinous pulp. n ‘ Literary Gazette.’576 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXVIII. YEAS T. 805.—As to Yeast or Yest, or as some people call it “barm,” there can be no doubt that the best is that taken from good brewers’ ale, which not only causes the dough to rise with more certainty than any other composition, but also imparts to the bread a slight aromatic bitter of a very agree- able flavour. This, however, cannot always be got, and although yeast of a good quality may generally be found at most country oil-shops, we here add a few receipts for those who prefer having it made at home: premising that, as these are not so strong as the brewers’ yeast, a larger quantity must be used. To 4 oz. of malt and 2 oz. of hops put a quart of boiling water, and let it remain boiling for 20 minutes, then strain the liquor to 8 oz. of flour; cover it until it ferments, and use it when it rises. Patent Yeast.—The following is copied from the original specification in the patent-office, from which was introduced the system, still in use amongst bakers, of making a ferment with potatoes for raising dough, instead of what was termed “ quarter-sponges — “ To make a yeast-gallon of this composition, such yeast- gallon containing 8 beer-quarts, boil in common water 8 lbs. of potatoes, as for eating : bruise them perfectly smooth, and mix with them, while warm, 2 oz. of fine honey, and 1 beer- quart of common yeast. For making bread, mix 3 beer-pints of the above composition with a bushel of flour, using warm water in making the bread : the water to be warmer in winter than in summer, and the composition to be used in a few hours after it is made; and so soon as the sponge, or the mixture of the composition with the flour, begins to fall the first time, the bread should be made and put into the oven.” Persons who are in the habit of making their own bread can easily manufacture their own yeast, by attending to the following directions:— Boil 1 lb. of good flour, i lb. of brown sugar, and 4 oz. of salt, in 2 gallons of water for an hour; when nearly cold, bottle it, and cork it close, and it will be fit for use in 24 hours. 1 pint will make 18 lbs. of bread.577 Chap. XXVIII.] YEAST AND OVEN. THE OVEN. 806.—For the baking of bread there can be no doubt the fire-proof brick oven is the best. It should be round, not long ; the roof from 20 to 24 inches high, the mouth small, and the door of iron to shut close. This construction will save firing and time, and bake better than long and high-roofed ovens. Brick ovens are also the best for baking all kinds of large cakes and pies; the reason of which is chiefly owing to their being generally capable of retaining the heat a much longer time than one built of iron ; unless, indeed, when the latter happens to be very substantially made of wrought iron. When this is the case, they serve all the purposes for a private family. We have had one in constant use for the last 30 years; it is set separately from the kitchen fire, and occupies no more space than a small boiler would. Four tins, being made to fit in without touching the sides, will hold each a loaf of 4 lbs. A fire-proof tile should be placed under the tins to prevent the bread burning at the bottom, and, when half done, the loaves should be changed, the front ones to the back, as there will be the greatest heat: the fii'e is under the oven, and, after having been once lighted, should be supplied only by cinders, wetted, and a small quantity of small coal mixed with them. For the baking of pastry, light bread, rolls, and breakfast- cakes, the iron ovens fixed in the usual kitchen ranges have the advantage of requiring but little fire, and enabling the cook to regulate its temperature, so as to increase or diminish its power; but a still better may be found in the French move- able oven, for which see No. 770. 07.—Put the necessary quantity of good flour—say 4 bushel—into a kneading-trough, or broad earthen pan, and make a large hole in the middle of the heap. Have ready a quart of warm water and stir it into a pint of brewers’ yeast, or, if home-made, a larger quantity ; then pour it through a sieve into the hole, and, with a large wooden spoon, work it round so as to bring it to a batter of moderate toughness, and, when that is done, sprinkle over it a large handful of flour, so as to commence what is called “ setting the sponge MAKING BREAD. 2 PMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXVIII. 578 then cover it with a cloth or board, and leave it to rise in a warm place : the sponge will rise enough in the course of 2 hours. When it has risen so high as to crack the flour on the top, put 4 lb. of salt into a quart of water a little warmer than new milk; let the salt be thoroughly melted, or it is liable to settle in lumps, which would spoil the bread: pour this water into the batter, and mix it well before taking in any of the flour, as this ensures the bread being uniformly light; then prepare another jug of water to use if wanted. That done, knead the dough well, turning it over, pressing it, folding it, and working it thoroughly with your clenched hands, for at least 4 an hour, or until it becomes light as well as stiff, and until all the flour is worked up. When done, the dough should be of such a consistency as not to stick to the hand. Remember that the goodness of the bread will greatly depend on the kneading, which requires both strength and practice. If baked in an iron oven, the dough should at once be rolled up and put into the tins, leaving it to rise in a warm place till nearly at the top of the tins, which should then at once be placed in the oven. A loaf of 4 lbs. will take about 2 hours to bake it. If the oven is well set it will be sufficiently heated during the time the bread is being made: dredge a little flour in ; if it changes colour it is hot enough. The loaves may be made of any form and size you please: for a small family, the 4 quartern, or 2 lb. loaf, is the most convenient, but the full quartern is the most common, and, in large establishments, where household bread is used, peck loaves are not unusual. The bread, if unexposed to the air, and kept in earthen, closely-covered pans, in a cool spot, will remain sufficiently fresh for a week, and any appearance of staleness may be removed by slightly damping the outside of the loaf, and putting it for a short time into the oven. If the oven be of brick, it should be heated by faggots, and will be sufficiently hot in about 4 hours; when the dough is ready, clear out the ashes, and sweep the floor clean for its reception. If necessary to lessen the heat, take an old broom, dip it in water, and hold it in the oven, twirling it round un- til it becomes dry. Try the heat of the bottom by throwing in some flour ; and if it scorches or turns black, do not ven- ture to put in the bread till the oven has had time to become cooler. When the loaves are put in the oven close up the door,BREAD. 579 Chap. XXVIII.] and do not open it more than once or twice, for a moment, just to see how the process is going on. The loaves will take from 21 to 3 hours baking, or more if their size be large; and, as a portion of the dough is frequently made up into rolls or twists, they must, of course, be removed earlier. Cottage-bread, if meant for the breakfast-table, is better baked in tins; and if made with a portion of milk, will be more delicate; but milk used in household-bread will be apt in a few days to turn it sour. In the making of either sort, if a tenth or a twelfth part of potato-flour be employed, it will improve their lightness and colour; and if, in the mixing of the dough, bran be boiled in the water used in making it, it will be found to impart a fine flavour of corn to the bread. Not only will this be the fact, but it has been calculated that if 5 lbs. of bran be boiled in water, then strained off, and the water used in kneading 56 lbs. of flour with the usual quantity of salt and yeast, the dough will weigh about 94 lbs. 13 oz.; or 8 lbs. 10 oz. more than if kneaded with pure water. Family Bread.—A sack of good flour weighing 280 lbs. ought to produce on an average rather more than 360 lbs. of excellent white bread, if well kneaded and properly baked, and that without any other addition ; though a little soda, or a very small quantity of magnesia, will assist in enabling the dough to rise, and thus increase the lightness of the bread; but alum, though it improves the colour, will occasion it to dry up sooner; bakers who make the best bread, indeed, rarely use it, and then only in case of some discoloration in the flour, which, if good and well dressed, produces bread suffi- ciently white without any foreign admixture whatever. FERMENTED AND UNFERMENTED BREAD. 808.—The attention of the public, and economists in par- ticular, has, within the last few years, been directed towards the method of making unfermented bread ; and its supposed superiority over fermented bread has been much extolled in a pamphlet lately published by “A Physician,”11 who estimates the loss in weight by this decomposition to be, in the London bread, 13 per cent.; and, according to M. Dumas, as quoted a See also a small pamphlet ‘ On the Philosophy of Bread-making,’ pub- lished by E. II. Matthews, at one penny.580 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXVIII. by him, to be in the Paris bread 17-fV per cent. : “ the waste varies somewhat, according to the degree to which the fer- mentation has been excited, and its duration in which the Doctor is right; for the waste, or loss of weight, will be in proportion to the duration of the fermentation, which must be sufficiently excited and continued to produce a well-made loaf; beyond this there is no necessity for extending the fer- mentation, and if checked at this stage the bread will be sweet and well tasted, indeed more so than that produced by the chemical means. Bakers, in order to please the eye of the public, carry the fermentation of their bread to the greatest possible extent, almost approaching the acetous state, so as to have a very white, large, and well-piled loaf of bread, with which alone the public will be satisfied. In the Rev. Mr. Haggett’s Economical Bread, only the coarse flake bran is to be removed from the flour : of this bran take 5 lbs., and boil it in rather more than 4 gallons of water, so that when perfectly smooth you may have 3 gallons and 3 quarts of bran-water clear. With this knead 56 lbs. of the flour, adding salt and yeast in the same way and proportions as for other bread. When ready to bake, divide it into loaves and bake them 2i hours. We do not, however, uphold this mode so much on the principle of economy, as on that of the quality of the bread made with water in which bran has been boiled, as we know from long experience that wheaten bread made in this manner always has a sweeter taste of corn than when made from pure water. Maize Bread.—Take an equal quantity of the meal of maize and wheaten flour. Set a sponge first with three parts of the wheaten flour, the requisite quantity of yeast, warm water, and salt. Whilst this is rising, mix the maize-meal up with water, and boil it over the fire, keeping it well stirred till it comes to the consistence of paste, and let it cool. When the sponge has risen to its greatest height, and begins to drop or sink down again, then add the meal paste; mix and knead them both well together, using the rest of the wheaten flour left from the sponge in the kneading with a sufficient quantity of water to make the whole of a proper consistence. Put the dough into a pan, cover it with a thick cloth or flannel, and let it remain in a warm place or before the fire to prove forROLLS. 581 Chap. XXVIII.] li or 2 hours, then divide it into loaves and bake. The maize, having no gluten in it, can only be rendered in any degree light by a large admixture of wheaten flour. Rye-bread may be made in the same manner as wheaten, and if both be mixed, as meslin, it has a very agreeable flavour, approaching to acidity. The grain, though dark- coloured, and the flour very brown, yet forms excellent bread at half the price of that made of wheat, and very far superior to that of maize. It is, indeed, the only bread consumed by the peasantry of Germany, who form as healthy a population as is found in any part of Europe. ROLLS, BREAKFAST-CAKES, &c. ROLLS. 809.—French Rolls are usually made by the bakers, but in country houses, where families bake their own bread, they may be done in either of the following ways :— Sift 1 lb. of flour, and rub into it 2 oz. of butter; mix in the whites only of 3 eggs beaten to a froth, and a tablespoon- ful of strong yeast; to which add enough of milk, with a little salt, to make a stiff dough, and set it, covered, before the fire to rise—which will take about an hour; and, if cut into i^mall rolls, and put into a quick oven, will be done in little more than 10 minutes. Or :■—Take i peck of the very finest flour, 1 oz. of butter melted in milk and water: mix with it 2 or 3 spoonfuls of yeast, according to its strength, and strain it through a hair sieve; whisk the white of an egg and work it into a light paste, add salt, and leave it all night. Then work it up well again, and make it into rolls. English Rolls.—Sift 1 lb. of flour into a pan, and mix with it a small teaspoonful of salt. Warm a gill of milk and water; make a hole in the middle of the flour and put into it a gill of brewer’s yeast, making it all into a thin batter, which must be stirred until quite free from lumps: then strew a handful of flour over it ; set it in a warm place, and leave it to rise, which will take 2 hours or more; let it,582 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXVIII. however, remain until it has cracked on the top, and then make it into a dough with more milk and water. Knead it well for 10 minutes, cover it, and set it again to rise for 20 minutes longer. Then form the dough into small rolls, bake them, and send them to table hot. Or:—To 2 lbs. of flour well dried, and 1 pint of water milk-warm, put 3 spoonfuls of yeast: then knead in 2 oz. of fresh butter and a little salt, and work all well together. The oven must be very quick, and £ of an hour will bake them; the dough should make 12 rolls. Or :■—H lb. of flour, a pint of milk, 1 egg, and 2 spoonfuls of yeast, well mixed and set before the fire to rise, will make still nicer rolls, and 20 minutes will bake them. They should be served hot, cut in 3, buttered, put together again, and covered when brought to table. HOCKS. 810. —Take a loaf that is half-baked, pull it apart, and with 2 forks tear the crumb into bits about the size of a walnut; lay them on a tin and return them to the oven, and bake of a light brown. A loaf made for the purpose with milk and a little butter makes them nicer. A sweet cake pulled in this way is very good. BREAKFAS T-CAKES. 811. -—Muffins.—Take 2 eggs, 2 spoonfuls of new yeast, and a little salt. Mix a little warm new milk and water into a quart of flour. Beat all well together, and let it stand to rise. Bake them for about 20 minutes, until of a light brown, either on a hot iron, or in shallow tin pans in a Dutch oven. When to be brought to table, toast them slightly on both sides, but not in the middle: then notch them round the centre, and pull them open with your fingers, without using a knife, and butter them. Crumpets.—Beat 2 eggs very well, put to them a quart of warm milk and water, and a large spoonful of yeast; beat in as much fine flour as will make them rather thicker than a common batter pudding ; then make the stove hot, or the iron cover of a bain-marie veiy hot, and rub it with a little butter wrapped in a clean linen cloth ; pour a large spoonful of the583 BREAKFAST-CAKES. Chap. XXVIII. ] batter upon the iron, and let it run within a ring to the size of a teasaucer ; turn them with the elastic blade of an old table-knife ; and when you want to use them, toast them very quickly, but not too crisply, and butter them. A Sally-Lunn, when eaten hot and well buttered, is a very favourite accompaniment of the breakfast or tea table, and may be made in either of these ways :— Into 1 pint of flour rub a piece of butter the size of a walnut, a little salt, and a little yeast. Let it rise ^ an hour before the fire. Then mix it with 2 eggs, and if not enough add a little milk; knead the dough well, and let it stand some minutes before the fire; after which, make this quan- tity into 5 cakes and have them slack-baked, as they must be well warmed in a Dutch oven before being toasted for table. Or:—Put 1 oz. of butter into almost a pint of new milk, and make it blood-warm. Beat up 3 eggs well, add to them 3 spoonfuls of good barm, and put in a little salt. Have 3 lbs. of fine flour well dried, pour in the above ingredients, and beat it up to the consistency of French bread. Lay it to sponge for 2 hours. Then pour it into a cake-pan. An hour will bake it. A very good breakfast cake may also be made with £ lb. of flour, 1 oz. of butter, and an egg, made into a paste with a spoonful of milk and a very little salt: let it rise before the fire, and bake it quickly. Cut it in half, while quite hot, and butter it. It is commonly called “ Yorkshire cake,” but when strongly impregnated with saffron, mixed with a small quantity of sugar, it is very commonly used in Bath and in Dublin as “ Saffron cake.” In America buckwheat-cakes are in great vogue as a break- fast delicacy, and, according to Miss Leslie’s receipt, are made thus:— “ Take a quart of buckwheat meal, mix with it a teaspoonful of salt, and add—if you have it—a handful of Indian meal; pour a large tablespoonful of the best brewers’ yeast into the centre of the meal ; then mix it gradually with cold water till it becomes a batter. Cover it, put it in a warm place, and set it to rise: it will take about 3 hours. When it is quite light, and covered with bubbles, it is fit to bake. Put your griddleMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXYITI. 584 over the fire and let it get quite hot before you begin. Grease it well with a piece of butter tied in a rag. Then dip out a large ladleful of the batter and bake it on the griddle, turning it with a broad wooden paddle. Let the cakes be of large size, and even at the edges. Butter them as you take them off the griddle; put several on a plate, and cut them across in 6 pieces. Grease the griddle anew between baking each cake. “ If your batter has been mixed over night, and is found to be sour in the morning, melt in warm water a piece of pearl- ash the size of a grain of corn, or a little larger; stir it into the batter, let it set for i an hour, and then bake it. The pearlash will remove the sour taste, and increase the lightness of the cakes.” In Shreivsbury they are made thus:—Take a quart or 3 pints of lukewarm water; put it into an earthen jar; add a small portion of salt and a common teacupful of yeast. Then stir in the buckwheat flour until it becomes a thick batter, cover it, and set it to rise. When light, and in a state of fermentation, take a frying-pan, the inside rubbed with butter or good lard; then place in the frying-pan 3 or 4 table- spoonfuls of the batter in each cake, until there are as many as the pan will contain. A few minutes over a quick fire will suffice to cook them in the same manner as the common pan- cake ; and when sufficiently cooked, butter them while quite hot, and serve them for breakfast. Buckwheat dressed in this manner will be found excellent and very wholesome, but it does not answer in any other way. The batter takes 3 or 4 hours to rise. Johnny Cakes.—Sift a quart of wheaten flour, or corn meal, into a pan ; make a hole in the middle, and pour in a pint of warm water. Mix the meal and water gradually into a batter, adding a teaspoonful of salt; beat it very quickly, and for a long time, till it becomes quite light; then spread it thick and even on a stout piece of smooth board ; place it upright on the hearth before a clear fire, with something to support the board behind, and bake it well; cut it into squares, and split and butter them hot. They may also be made with a quart of milk, 3 eggs, 1 teaspoonful of carbonate of soda, and 1 teacupful of wheaten flour; add Indian corn meal sufficient to make a batter like585 Chap. XXVIII.] BREAKFAST-CAKES. that of pancakes, and either bake it in buttered pans, or upon a griddle, and eat them with butter.a Paste Cake.—In Ireland breakfast-cakes are baked on a griddle, or flat iron, placed on trivets over a cinder or turf fire, and the cake under the above title is there composed of flour and butter, just in the same manner as for a pie-crust, and therefore made as rich or as plain as you like. The paste is made a full inch thick, usually to the circumference of a dinner-plate. It is then placed upon the griddle, twice turned until done, when it is served hot, then divided and buttered, as each person may please. It is a very delicious but indi- gestible appendage to breakfast. Slim-cake is made simply of flour and milk, without butter, and baked in the same manner as the above, but always eaten cold, with butter. TOAST AND BUTTER. In the making of dry and buttered toast there should be this difference :—Dry toast should be cut very thin, and held at a distance from the fire to render it crisp ; while buttered toast should not only be cut rather thick and placed near to the fire, to keep soft, but, for that purpose, held for a minute or two over a bowl of boiling water to imbibe the steam before being buttered. The toast should always be buttered on both sides, and the crusts cut off. If fresh butter be used, it must be accompanied with a muffineer, to salt it, but most people prefer the flavour of really good salt butter. 812.—Take 2 lbs. of fine flour, after being gently warmed before the fire, and rub into it k pint of warm mealy potatoes. When well mixed, add a proper quantity of yeast and salt with warm milk and water -sufficient to make into dough, which must be allowed '2i hours to rise before being formed into a loaf: which put into a tin to preserve its shape, and when placed in the oven take care that it be not over- browned .b On this, Dr. Hunter, from whom we copy the above, ob- serves, “ that the lovers of toast and butter will be much “ Matthews ‘ On Bread-Making.’ h ‘ Medical Commentary on Receipts in Modern Cookery,’ by A.

The potato is not here added with a view to economy, but to increase the lightness of the bread, in which state it will imbibe the butter with more freedom.” SAVOURY DISHES FOR BREAKFAST. GRILLADES. 813-—Perhaps there is no better grill for breakfast than a cold blade-bone of mutton, off which the greater part of the meat has been already cut. The remaining parts should then be scored, and the gashes filled with a mixture of mustard, cayenne, common pepper, and salt, as for a devil: it should then be put upon the gridiron, and well browned, but not burnt. It may be sent to table dry, without any sauce, or served with gravy mixed with capers. The bones of cold fowl of all kinds are also frequently brought thus to breakfast. Broiled Chicken.—Get it undressed, split it open, pepper it only on the inside, put it on the gridiron over a moderate fire, and when perfectly done on both sides serve it up quite hot, just touched over with a very little butter, and accom- panied with broiled mushrooms. Another broil.—Put thin slices of well-seasoned kidney and bacon, with beef or mutton also if you please, upon skewers. Have ready fine bread-crumbs, with a slight grating of lemon, brush them over with egg, and roll them in the crumbs. Hang up the skewers to roast in a toaster, and put a slice of toast under it to secure the gravy : when served, carefully remove the skewers, and place the “ kabobs ” on the toast; but, if only a quantity sufficient to help one person be put on each skewer, then do not remove them. If, instead of meat, an oyster be put between each slice of bacon and kidney, it will be found very superior. As to bloaters and finnan-haddock, they are too well known to need any description ; dried salmon is likewise a good relish ; nor is a fresh mackerel, split open and broiled, to be despised.

TOASTS. 814.— German Toast.—Take the remainder of any fricassee or ragout; any quantity will do: chop it finely, add a little i chopped parsley, and a little bit of shalot or chive: mix it up with 1 or 2 eggs beaten, according to the quantity. Put the whole with its gravy into a stewpan, and let it reduce and thicken on the fire. Let it remain until it is cold, then cut pieces of bread, toast them : lay the mixture thickly upon them. Boil an egg hard, cut it into small pieces, and stick them on the top ; brush the whole with egg beaten up, sift bread-crumbs over, and bake them in the oven ; squeeze a little lemon-juice on the top. This makes also a good corner i dish for dinner. Vegetable Toast.—Take any stewed vegetable, and make it into a puree. Add a little more seasoning, mix it up with | the yolk of an egg, and, if too thin, reduce and thicken it • over the fire, then spread it upon toast, brush it over with beaten egg, add bread-crumbs or vermicelli, and fry or bake them. Anchovy Toast.—Make a well-buttered toast of brown bread, if you can get it ; scale and bone a proper number of | anchovies, with little or no washing; cut them into broad | slices, and place them upon the toast, seasoning it with mustard, without pepper. Or:—Butter a round of toast, wash and bone 8 anchovies, chop them fine, add a bit of butter the size of a walnut, and a moderate quantity of cayenne ; work the whole into a paste,MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXVIII. 588 spread it over the toast, and hold it before the fire until it is warm through. Sausage Toast.—Make a toast, fry 2 or 3 sausages ; when quite hot, strip off the skins and spread the meat upon the toast, which should not only be made, if possible, of brown bread, but also buttered with salt butter; season it with a little pepper and mustard. It will be improved by a grating of Gray ere, Parmesan, or old Cheshire cheese. Kidney Toast.—Take a cold veal kidney, with a part of the fat, cut it into very small pieces ; pound the fat in a mortar with a little salt, white pepper, and an onion previously boiled. Bind all together with the beaten whites of eggs. Heap it upon toast, cover the whole with the yolks beaten, dredge with bread-crumbs, and bake in the oven. Ham Toast.—Grate or pound the cold ham; toast and butter a slice of bread; mix the ham with the yolk of an egg and a little cream, until it is thick and rich ; warm it over the fire, and serve it very hot upon the toast. Tongue may be em- ployed in the same way. Scotch Woodcock.—Toast and butter 3 or 4 slices of bread on both sides; take 9 or 10 anchovies, washed, scraped, and chopped fine, and put them between the slices of bread. Beat the yolks of 4 eggs in 4 pint of cream, and set it on the fire to thicken, hut not to boil. Then pour it over the toast, and send it to table as hot as possible. This may, however, be diminished at pleasure ; as one slice of bread of a moderate sized loaf, 1 egg, and 2 or 3 anchovies, may be sufficient. SHEEP'S RUMPS AND KIDNEYS. 815.—Boil the rumps in gravy, and lard the kidneys with bacon ; set them, along with the rumps, before the fire in a^ small tin oven, rubbing them at the same time with yolk of egg and a little cayenne and nutmeg. When of a light brown, dish them up, either dry or with any pungent sauce, and garnish them with green parsley. Or :—Stew them until tender, then put them for a few minutes into a pan with 2 or 3 oz. of boiled rice seasoned ith ketchup or mushroom powder, and give a light boil, with - large spoonfuls of good cream or milk thickened with Hour and butter.

This may be varied by the addition of chopped anchovies, or the essence, diavolo paste, or Chetney. Or:—Make a slice of cheese into a paste with made mus- tard, and lay it upon one side. A dry Devil.—Take the liver, gizzard, drumstick, and side- bones of a fowl or turkey ; score them ; lay on made mustard very thickly, and add a quantity of cayenne pepper and salt, and broil them. A icet Devil.—Take any part of a turkey, goose, or fowl, cover it with mustard, Chetney, diavolo paste, or any other piquant condiment; put a dessertspoonful of cayenne pepper, one of pounded white sugar, the juice of a lemon, a glass of wine, and a glass of ketchup, to a teacupful of gravy ; heat them together, pour over the devilled fowl, and send up very hot.

Boll a bit of butter, the size of a walnut, in flour; put the birds and the sauce into a metal dish over a lamp, cover it close, shake it about occa- sionally, and when it has stewed until the greater part of the sauce has been imbibed, serve it round. The legs of fowls, geese, and turkeys, may be devilled the same way.590 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXVIII.

In making it, pure water is most generally used, with a pinch of salt and sugar, though both are frequently omitted ; but a much better mode for preserving it, as well as adding to it a good flavour, is to make it of water in which horseradish has been boiled. This costs no trouble ; for if the horseradish be scraped and put in a teacup with boiling water poured upon it and covered, the infusion will be strong enough in little more than 4 an hour. The Parisian mustard, known as moutarde de maille, is however much in vogue among gastronomists, as possessing a finer pungency of flavour, and may be imitated by mixing up the flour and a little fine salt with salad oil, so as to form a thick paste, then diluting it to a certain degree with equal quantities of the vinegars of horseradish, tarragon, chili, and garlic; or sufficient of each to please the palate. Cayenne should never be used, and even chili vinegar but sparingly.

Cut the bread moderately thin, butter it very slightly indeed, lay the meat cut thin, season with salt, pepper, and mustard, as may be required; cover with a second slice of bread, trim the edges, put them one on the other, and cover with a damp cloth until wanted. Where tongue is used it should be boiled the day before, and, when thoroughly done, pressed in the mould in which the bread is to be baked. Chickens boned, and farced with a small quantity of farce of veal and ham, and treated in the same way, will make excellent sandwiches.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIX. 592 CHAPTER XXIX. COFFEE, TEA, AND CHOCOLATE. 820.—Either coffee, tea, or chocolate, forms the constant foundation of our English breakfast; and the two former are also such a common evening refreshment that it would be unpardonable to pass them over without remark. Formerly coffee was hardly ever seen at the breakfast-table in England, and was, indeed, only rarely brought forward in the evening, except for a party, and along with tea. It was also then made insufferably weak—consequently bad— and without any knowledge either of the proper mode of pre- paring it, or care for the original quality of the berry ; which ought to be rather pale in colour, small in size, and of a roundish form. Nothing can be more grateful to the stomach, or more favourable to digestion, than a cup of good strong coffee —or, as the French call it, cafe noir—soon after dinner ; and if it be followed by a small glass of liqueur, as chasse cafe, it will be found equally agreeable to the palate. Still, however, there is much to be learned respecting the best mode of pre- paring it; and as this is more scientifically done in Paris than in London, we here offer a few directions on the subject. Independently of the mode of making, the coffee should be of good quality, or the flavour will suffer in proportion to its inferiority. The Mocha is the best, and the Java good; but the sorts most commonly used in this country arc the Jamaica and the Berbice, which are both excellent when well chosen and undamaged. To this must be added the age to which it should be kept: for, if used soon after being gathered, it has an unpleasant coarseness of flavour. In those countries where it is grown it is seldom used until 3 years old; and if older will be all the better. It should always be exposed to the air, and kept very dry. The best mode is, to buy it raw, and keep it for a593 COFFEE. Chap. XXIX.] long time—even years—without using it; only roasting it at the time it is wanted; and that operation should be performed by Orpwood’s roasting machine, which is fixed on the bars of a grate, and roasts i lb. of coffee without trouble, and with great regularity, in less than ^ of an hour : it is far superior to the coffee-roaster which is heated by a lamp. The roasted berries should then be put into a bag of flannel to cool and prevent the escape of the aroma ; after which grind them. If not used soon after it is ground, the powder should be wrapped up and put before the fire or in the oven to get hot. When the berry has been roasted at the grocer’s, it should be warmed before it is ground. The French mode of making.—As much of the powder should be used as one to every 3 cups of the liquid to be made, and placed in the upper part of the common French machine, called a grecque, which may be got for a mere trifle at any of the tin-shops. It is merely a coffee-pot with an upper receptacle made to fit close into it, the bottom of which is perforated with holes, and containing in its interior 2 moveable metal strainers, over the second of which the coffee is to be placed, and immediately under the third ; upon the upper strainer pom- boilmg water, until it bubbles up through the strainer; then shut the cover close down, place it near the fire, or upon the hob of a parlour-grate; and so soon as the water is drained through the coffee, repeat the operation mi til the whole intended quantity is passed. The top of the machine may then be removed, and the coffee may be served in the pot in which it has been made, or in any other, only taking care that it shall first be warmed with hot water, and that the coffee itself be brought up strictly hot. This is the true Parisian method, and it requires neither isinglass nor clearings of any description, as it will come to ■ table quite transparent. A patent has, however, lately been taken out under the title of “ Platow’s Automaton Coffee Urn,” which perfectly clarifies the coffee, and can be made an elegant appendage to the table I (see cut No. 1). If the upper vessel is made of glass, it is then an interesting process to make the coffee in the drawing-room, instead of having it made in the kitchen, which, for some reason or other, very seldom sends out a good cup of coffee. It, is •■I heated by a spirit lamp. The coffee-pot shown in cut No. 2 is 2 qMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIX. 594 upon the same principle, but can be set upon the fire, as both vessels are of block-tin. The upper vessel screws on: this is taken off, and the water put into the lower vessel; the upper vessel is then screwed on again, and the dry coffee put into it. Set it on the fire, or place the lamp under it, and the water will boil up through the dry coffee. Just stir it that every part of the coffee may be wetted, let it boil for 3 minutes, then take it off the fire, or remove the lamp, and the coffee will gradually drain back to the lower vessel, leaving the grounds in the upper. This process is the most certain, the most economical, and produces the brightest coffee of any we have ever tried ; and coffee being a favourite beverage, there is scarcely a plan proposed for making it which we have not tried, and decidedly think the “Platow” the best. They are to be got at all the large furnishing ironmongers’. No. 1. One great art in making coffee is to use a sufficient quantity of the powder; for, if not strong, the aroma of its flavour is lost, in proportion to its state of weakness. Foreigners seldom drink more than 1 small cup of coflee after dinner, and that always without either milk or cream; but as most English people like a mixture of the latter, the milk—if cream cannot be had—should always be boded and used hot, in a much larger quantity than cream; but cream better preserves the flavour of the coffee.TEA. 595 Chap. XXIX.] Milk Coffee is an excellent breakfast, and, as its name im- plies, is generally composed of ~ milk and f coffee: the coffee is made in the same manner as for after dinner; the boiling milk may, however, be afterwards added according to fancy. If the yolk of a raw egg be well mixed up with i a pint of the milk, it will materially add to the richness of the coffee; but soft sugar should then be used ; whereas the best refined lump or powdered sugar-candy should be taken in that which is to be drunk pure. Even for milk-coffee, always make the coffee itself as strong as in the French mode; and weaken it as you please with milk. Should the plan be adopted of each person mixing the milk and coffee according to their taste, an excellent utensil would be that of a small tea-urn, divided in the centre of its interior, to separate the liquids, but equally communicating the warmth of the heater: it must have the addition of a cock on each side. As to the liquid essence of coffee, the best sort is not a bad substitute, in a hurry, for that made in a proper way ; but it is not nearly so good. Mocha coffee can only be found at the shops of grocers of eminence, though every petty dealer puts off what he calls “ Turkey coffee,” as being the same. If you cannot roast the berries, at least grind them yourself, to prevent the imposition of a mixture. If induced by its cheapness to buy low-priced coffee, the coarseness of its flavour may be improved by the addition of a small quantity of chicory powder, at the rate of a couple of ounces to the pound. T E A. 821.—Tastes differ regarding the flavour of various sorts of tea: some preferring all black ; others, all green ; and many, a mixture of both in different quantities; though most persons —when not fearful of their nerves—agree that fine Hyson is the best. A good mixture, in point of flavour, we know to be—\ black, ■§• green, and i gunpowder: all being, of course, of superior quality. Presuming all ladies to be intimately acquainted with the mode of making tea, yet, to some, a few hints on the subject may not perhaps be found objectionable. 2 Q 2596 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIX. ■First, never make it in any other than a highly-polished teapot, for it is a chemical fact that metal retains the heat longer than earthenware; and the better it is polished, the more completely will the liquid be kept hot, and the essence of the tea be extracted. A silver teapot is decidedly the best; for you will be sure that the metal is not mixed up with zinc or other materials of a pernicious nature. Secondly, see that the water be really boiling, not simmer- ing, as is too commonly the case when taken from an urn, but kept either on the fire until boiled, or in one of those metal teakettles warmed by a spirit-lamp, as formerly used by our grandmothers, and now—thanks to good taste in tea-drinking —again coming into fashion. Having well scalded the teapot, then put in the tea, and pour over it about 4 of the water the pot will contain; taking care to keep it as hot as possible for not less than 10 minutes; then fill up the pot, allow it to remain from 6 to 8 minutes longer—though all green would require 5 minutes more—for we know, from long experience, that it requires that time to thoroughly draw it; it may then be poured out; but you should always be careful not to drain the pot to the very last cup. For 4 persons, each taking 2 large breakfast-cups, you will require nearly an ounce of good mixed tea; the finer the quality of the tea, the less quantity need be employed. Never add fresh tea to that which has already been made, by way of strengthening it; for it will not have that effect; but in case of its being too weak, then put the tea into a large teacup, fill it up with boiling water, and leave it there, closely covered, for a few minutes, after which throw the contents into the teapot. The foregoing instructions are in accordance with our mothers and grandmothers’ notions of “ making tea wellbut latterly it has been asserted that a very pernicious quality in tea is extracted from the water standing long upon it. A physician asserts that “ tea-drinkers, in following this plan, put more fees into the physician’s pocket than by any other he knows.” He recommends that 2 teapots should always be used, each of sufficient size to hold the quantity required; that the whole of the water shall be poured on the tea at once, and not allowed to stand upon it more than three or 4 minutes, when it should be poured into the other teapot., and served fromChap. XXIX.] 597 CHOCOLATE. that. If the party is large this process must be repeated. By this means all the tea will be of equal strength, and you get the fine aromatic flavour without the injurious matter. We have for some time made tea in this way, and very much approve it. It certainly approaches nearer to the method adopted amongst the Chinese, who have water poured upon the tea in the teacup, and in some parts of India the tea is enclosed in a perforated silver egg, which is put into the pot, and taken out when the infusion is sufficiently strong. CHOCOLATE, 822.—If made thin, is not worth drinking ; and that which is now commonly sold by the grocers is a compound of flour, or some farinaceous substance, and coarse sugar or treacle, together with a very moderate quantity of real cocoa, and that of the most inferior quality, coloured with Venetian red and brown ochre. 1 f you mean to have really good chocolate, you must, therefore, pay a far higher price than is paid for the trash to which we have alluded. That made in Florence has long been celebrated, and there has been for many years a large manufactory established near Paris by one Menier, which has a very high reputation there; having tried it, we can also recommend it, and it can be had in London, either of Messrs. Dakin and Co., St. Paul’s Churchyard; or Hedges and Butler, 155, Regent Street. It forms the common breakfast throughout Spain, and, when manufactured, is there made by merely chipping a portion of the cake into which it is formed from the cocoa, leaving the chips in water for a whole night to soften. It may then be slowly warmed, along with either water or milk, working it all the time with the mill, which is a small moveable pole passed through the lid of a chocolate-pot, and furnished with a headpiece in order to mix the chocolate equally by turning the mill rapidly between the hands and without intermission, thus to prevent it from becoming clotty ; care, however, should be taken not to let it boil; for, in that case, the vegetable oil which is contained in the nut will be extracted from it and appear on the surface. The flavour is better retained by making it in water than milk.598 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIX. It is always made very thick, so that a small spoon will nearly stand upright in it, and nothing eaten with it but a rusk, or dry toast: after which there is usually taken a draught of cold spring water. The usual mode of making it is to boil a pint of water in the pot, put to it a cake of chocolate cut into very small slices, mill it off the fire till quite melted, then put it on a gentle fire till it nearly boils, milling it all the time. Pour it into a basin, and it will keep in a cool place for several days. When used put a couple of tablespoonfuls of it into milk, warm it with sugar, and mill it well. COCOA. 823.—An excellent breakfast beverage may be made by simply pounding the nut—which is the substance of choco- late—and boiling it in the same manner in either water or milk. The best quality is that of Cctraccas, which is small, very dark-coloured, and appears as if partly mouldy or broken ; while that usually to be found in the shops is plump and glossy, and the patent sort, or paste, still more inferior; it being always made from the cheapest kind, and not unfre- quently from that which has been damaged. Cocoa Shells or Nibs, or, as they are more appropriately called in Ireland, “ Miserable,” are the thin coverings of the cocoa kernel, and can only be had at some chocolate manu- factory, where they can be bought at a very low price, and form a light food for an invalid, when taken warm. Soak them in water during the whole night, and then boil them in the same water until reduced to i the quantity: they should boil 2 hours, and should then be mixed up with milk.ENGLISH WINES; 599 Chap. XXX.] CHAPTER XXX. ON ENGLISH WINES AND LIQUEURS. ENGLISH WINES. 824.—English wines may be made very advantageously by families who have gardens, as, from the reduced price of sugar, they cost but little comparatively with foreign wines, all of which pay heavy duties. They should^ however, be thoroughly fermented, and be made of such strength as to keep sound for 3 or 4 years, and never be drunk until they are more than a year old ; whereas those housewives who look too closely to economy weaken them so much with water as to cause them soon to turn sour. In the south of Europe the grape contains all the chemical properties which enable it to undergo complete fer- mentation, and from which perfect wine can be produced ; but the artificial composition of the fluids on which the maker of domestic wine in England has to operate makes it advisable that a few words should be said upon the subject. The sub- stances essential to vinous fermentation are sugar, vegetable extract, the tartaric or malic acids, and water. None of these can be dispensed with, and it is in the balancing of them that the art greatly consists. Sugar is the most essential of these, as it is from its decomposition that alcohol is derived. The most saccharine juices therefore may be made to produce the strongest wine: hence the absolute necessity of adding sugar th all English fruit, in which the malic acid so largely predominates ; and it is from the judicious mixture of sugar and water with this acid that our best native wines are produced, as by this only will the process of fermentation be effectually carried on. Any one attempting to make wine from the juice of currants or gooseberries, or even ripe grapes, alone, would at once perceive this. The use of brandy is quite unnecessaryMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXX. 600 if the wine is properly fermented, and it keeps sound much better without it. Yeast, also, should never be used in wine made of fresh fruit, as, if the proportions are properly ad- justed, the fluid will ferment of itself. The four following receipts we have used and approved for many years, the first of which may be taken as a guide in almost all sorts of domestic wine made of fresh fruit—the quantities of course varying with the quality of the fruit. If due attention be paid, it may almost be said “ never to fail.” The fermen- tation requires the greatest care, as on it so much depends. If checked too soon the wine is imperfect, and not so whole- some. If carried on too far, the acetous stage commences. It is therefore necessary to watch it with great attention. The process commences within 24 hours of the mixture being made, which is perceived by a slight hissing noise and little bubbles rising on the surface. This will increase when put into the cask, when it will be so loud that it may be heard at some distance, and will continue some weeks. Unless the wine is intended to be sweet, it should not be closed up till the hissing has very much subsided. If it is intended to be dry, and represent foreign wine, it should be drawn off into a barrel which has been sulphured. To have it sparkling, the scum which rises in fermenting should be allowed to sink in- stead of running out, and the barrel bunged up whilst the wine still retains a slight tendency to ferment. All wine is improved by being racked off, and a little isinglass added— about ^ oz. to 10 gallons. This should be done 2 or 3 months before bottling, and not in very hot or very cold weather. WINE FROM UNRIPE GRAPES. 825.—As the stems and husks of grapes give no bad flavour to the fruit, it may be used in any stage of ripening, or dif- ferent degrees may be mixed together. The fruit is in the best state when just beginning to ripen. For every gallon take 5 lbs. of fruit; have a tub which will hold 15 or 20 gallons ; bruise the grapes into this so thoroughly that if pos- sible every berry shall be mashed ; when the whole are in, stalks and all, add 4 gallons of cold spring-water; mix all well with the hand till the juice and pulp are separated from the more solid matter ; cover the tub, and let it stand 24 hours; strain it through a coarse bag, and squeeze the fruit quite dry ; pour a gallon of water over the solid mass, to getENGLISH WINES. Chap. XXX.] 601 any soluble matter which may remain. Put into a tub or cooler 30 lbs. of loaf-sugar ; pour the fluid upon it, first mea- suring it; make up with water to the total bulk of 104 gal- lons ; mix this until the sugar is dissolved. This is called the must, and is equivalent to the juice of the grape. Cover up the vessel with a board, over which throw a blanket, and let it stand in a moderate temperature for 24 hours or more, ac- cording as it may appear to begin to ferment. Put it into the cask, which should be kept full to the bung-hole, and a little inclined to one side to let the scum work off': you have 4 gal- lon of must for this purpose. There should be a hole near the bung which should be stopped with a wooden peg, and when the bung is closed up the peg should in a day or two be loosened, that the fixed air may have vent: this should be repeated at intervals till the excessive expansion has ceased, when the peg may be driven tight. The best way to keep the bung air-tight is to paste a double piece of brown paper over it. Let the wine remain in a cool cellar till a clear warm day in January, then rack it off, and let it stand to the end of March before bottling. It will keep for many years. We have some in our cellar made 22 years ago, which is very fine indeed, and perfectly sound. If it is a brisk or champagne wine, it will be very good the following summer. When racked and clarified, the isinglass should be dissolved in a little of the wine, and well mixed in the barrel. Green Gooseberry Wine may be made in exactly the same way. ORANGE WINE. 826.—For 10 gallons take 100 Seville oranges ; peel them very thin ; press out the juice, and put it, with 30 lbs. of loaf- sugar, into a cask ; put the peel into a deep pan, large enough to allow a gallon of cold water to be poured over it; let this stand till the next day, then pour the water over the sugar and juice already in the cask ; cover the peel again with water, adding it to the cask the next day, and continue to do so until the cask is full. Stir it well every day for 2 or 3 weeks, by which time it will be in full fermentation, which will continue for nearly a couple of months; after which draw it off, and after taking out the lees, and cleaning out the cask with a dry cloth, dissolve 4 oz. of isinglass in a little of the wine, stir it well in, and bung it up close till the autumn, March beiim 7 O602 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXX. the proper month to make this wine in. It will be found very coiwenient to have a second cask to rack wine into, which is at once put under the tap, and avoids all splashing and waste. Where the custom is to use casks of the same size, one or two extra ones only are required. PARSNIP WINE. 827. —To every gallon of water take 3 lbs. of fine clear parsnips and the same weight of loaf-sugar; slice the parsnips into the watery and let them boil to a pulp; strain them through a hair sieve, return the liquor into the boiler, and add the sugar; let it boil 4 an hour; when tepid, lay a toast covered with yeast in it, and cover it, keeping the cooler in a warm place; when it begins to ferment, put it into the cask, taking out the toast. It should not be racked till the autumn, and not bottled in less than a year. Parsnips are best in the winter. All warm fluids to be fermented should be regulated by a thermometer. Tepid is from 85 to 95 degrees. The cold of the weather should regulate the heat between this range. GINGER WINE. 828. —To every gallon of water take 2 lbs. of loaf-sugar and 2 oz. of bruised ginger; boil them together for an hour; put the liquor into a vessel to cool; when tepid, add the juice and peel of 6 lemons, and a toast covered with yeast; cover it over, and when it begins to ferment put it into the cask; let it ferment 2 or 3 weeks. Before putting in the bung, put to it t lb. of raisins to every gallon ; they need not be stoned, but are best just slit open. This wine may be racked in another month, and isinglass put to clarify it. Bottle it in 3 or 4 weeks, and it is soon fit to drink, though, if properly fermented, it will keep a year or two and improve. Amongst the following receipts are many which have long been family favourites; but as they generally" recommend the old-fashioned plan of adding spirits to the wine, in the place of trusting to the process of fermentation for its strength, we cannot ourselves quite approve them; nevertheless there are some from which most excellent wine has been made. A RICH AND PLEASANT WINE. 829. —Take new cider from the press, mix it with as muchChap. XXX.] 603 ENGLISH WINES honey as will support an egg, boil gently 15 minutes, but not in an iron, brass, or copper pot; skim it well; when cool, let it be tunned, but do not quite fill the cask. In March follow- ing bottle it, and it will be fit to drink in 6 weeks, but will be less sweet if kept longer in the cask. You will have a rich and strong wine, and it keeps well. This will serve for any culinary purposes which sack or sweet wine is directed for. Honey is a fine ingredient to assist, and render palatable, new crabbed austere cider; but this should be made from apples that are perfectly sound and of good quality. ENGLISH MALMSEY OR MALT WINE.—E. R. 830.—Take 30 gallons of sweet-wort, and to every gallon put H lb. of lump-sugar ; boil the liquor for 7 an hour, and when still warm tun it into a barrel, putting 2 lbs. of Malaga raisins coarsely chopped, 2 oz. of dissolved isinglass, and 1 spoonful of yeast to each gallon, adding also 3 oz. of hops for the 30 gallons ; stir the liquor with a wooden staff’ every day for a fortnight or longer; keep the bung lightly in until the fermentation ceases, then add 2 gallons of brandy; let the wine stand 12 months, when it may be racked off and bottled. It will be the better for long keeping, and will answer well for all culinary purposes. Or;—Take 87 gallons of new ale from the vat whilst fer- menting, 0.7 gallons of cold spring water ; to every gallon add 3 lbs. of sugar; mix all well together till the sugar is dis- solved ; put it at once into the cask, and set it in a warm place to ferment, which it ought to do for 6 or 7 weeks ; chop 2 lbs. of Malaga raisins and 7 lb. of bitter almonds together; put them into a wide-mouthed bottle, and add a pint of brandy; cork it up till the wine has done fermenting, then put it into the cask, and bung it down close; let it stand 6 or 7 months, clear it off into another cask, adding 7 oz. of isinglass dis- solved in a little of the wine; let it stand another month, then bottle it. This has been proved to be an excellent receipt. GRAPE WINE.—E. R. 831—Take 20 lbs. of grapes very ripe and picked clean, pour upon them 6 quarts of boiling water, cover them close, and before they are cold break the grapes with the hand; let them stand 3 days, then strain them as dry as possible, and stir into the liquor 10 lbs. of sugar; tun it the next day, and itMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. TChap. XXX. 604 will work itself pure ; lay the bung on it until it has done hissing. RAISIN WINE.—E. R. 832.—To every 6 gallons of water put 2 oz. of hops and the largest stalks of the Malaga raisins, and boil it for j of an hour; strain it, and when nearly cold pour it on the fruit, allowing 64 lbs., of which one-fifth should be Smyrna raisins, to every gallon of water; let it stand for 6 weeks, stirring it every day ; press the fruit, and then put the liquor into the cask; rack it in 6 weeks, or as soon as it is fine, and to every 6 gallons add a bottle of the best French brandy. Excellent Raisin Wine.—To every gallon of spring water put 8 lbs. of fresh Smyrnas in a large tub ; stir it thoroughly every day for a month; then press the raisins in a horse-hair bag as dry as possible ; put the liquor into a cask, and, when it has done hissing, pour in a bottle of the best brandy; stop it close for 12 months; then rack it off, but without the dregs; filter them through a bag of flannel of 3 or 4 folds; add the clear to the quantity, and pour 1 or 2 quarts of brandy, according to the size of the vessel. Stop it up, and at the end of 3 years you may either bottle it or drink it from the cask. Raisin wine would be extremely good if made rich of the fruit, and kept long, which improves the flavour greatly. Raisin Wine with Cider.—Put 2 cwt. of Malaga raisins into a cask, and pour upon them a hogshead of good sound cider that is not rough ; stir it well 2 or 3 days; stop it, and let it stand 6 months ; then rack into a cask that it will fill, and put in a gallon of the best brandy. If raisin wine be much used, it would answer well to keep a cask always for it, and bottle off 1 year’s wine just in time to make the rest, which, allowing the 6 months of infusion, would make the wine to be 18 months old. In cider counties this way is very economical; and, even if not thought strong enough, the addition of another i cwt. of raisins would be suf- ficient, and the wine would still be very cheap. When the raisins are pressed through a horsehair bag, they will either produce a good spirit by distillation (for which purpose they must be very little pressed) ; or they will make excellent vinegar. The stalks, being very acid, should be picked out, and may be thrown into any cask of vinegar that is being made.605 ENGLISH WINES. Chap. XXX.] CURRANT WINE—E. R. 833. —To each gallon of juice put 2 of water and 35- lbs. of moist sugar. When it has been in the cask about a fortnight, put a bottle of brandy to every 4 gallons of wine, and, when it has quite done hissing, bung it down close. Or:—To every 3 pints of fruit, carefully cleared from any that is mouldy or bad, put 1 quart of water; bruise the former. In 24 hours strain the liquor, and put to every quart 1 lb. of sugar, of good middling quality of Lisbon. If for white currants use lump-sugar. It is best to put the fruit, &e., in a large pan ; and when in 3 or 4 days the scum rises, take that otf before the liquor is put into the barrel. Those who make from their own gardens may not have sufficient to fill the barrel at once: the wine will not be hurt if made in the pan in the above proportions, and added as the fruit ripens, and can be gathered in dry weather. Keep an account of what is put in each time. Another way.—Put 5 quarts of currants and a pint of rasp- berries to every 2 gallons of water; let them soak a night; then squeeze and break them well. Next day rub them well on a fine wire sieve till all the juice is obtained, washing the skins again with some of the water; then to every gallon put 4 lbs. of very good Lisbon sugar, but not white, which is often adulterated ; tun it immediately, and lay the bung lightly on ; do not use anything to work it. In 2 or 3 days put a bottle of brandy to every 4 gallons; bung it close, but leave the peg out at top a few days; keep it 3 or 4 years, and it will be a very fine agreeable wine. BLACK CURRANT WINE (veryfine). 834. —To every 3 quarts of juice put the same of water un- boiled, and to every 3 quarts of the liquor add 3 lbs. of very pure moist sugar; put it into a cask, reserving a little for filling up ; put the cask in a warm dry room, and the liquor will ferment of itself; skim off the refuse when the fermenta- tion shall be over, and fill up with the reserved liquor; when it has ceased working, pour 3 quarts of brandy to 40 quarts of wine ; bung it close for 9 months, then bottle it, and drain the thick part through a jelly-bag until it be clear, and bottle that; keep it 10 or 12 months. This recipe is most excellent. The wine will keep for 6 years.606 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXX. Or:—Bruise 28 lbs. of currants, and pour upon them 2 gallons of water; let them remain 24 hours, then strain off the liquor, adding 14 lbs. of pure moist or loaf sugar; put the whole into a clean cask. In the following spring rack the liquor, and run the grounds through a jelly-bag; then put it into a clean cask, and add a bottle of brandy. The above proportions will make 5 gallons of wine. GOOSEBERRY WINE. 835.—To every 3 lbs. of gooseberries put a pint of spring water unboiled, having first bruised the fruit with the hands in a tub; stir them very well; let them stand a whole day, then strain them off, and to every 3 lbs. of gooseberries add a pint of water and 1 lb. of sugar dissolved ; let it stand 24 hours longer, then skim the head clean off, and put the liquor into a vessel, and the scum into a flannel bag, adding the liquor that drains from it to that in the vessel; let it work 2 or 3 days before stopping it up close, and allow it to stand 4 months before it is bottled. When it is drawn out of the cask it should not be tapped too low. Green Gooseberry Wine.—Take 32 quarts of unripe goose- berries of the green kind, bruise them well, add 32 quarts of cold water ; let them stand for 24 hours; drain the gooseberries well from the liquor through a sieve; put 3i lbs. of lump- sugar to every gallon of liquor ; put it into a cask with a bottle of the best gin ; let it stand 6 months, and then bottle it. This is a receipt from a nobleman’s butler, who used to boast that he never opened more than one bottle of Cham- pagne at his master’s table at one dinner, all that followed being: of his own manufacture. Q CHAMPA GNE.—E. R. 83G.—Bruise well the amber hairy Champagne gooseberries, when they are just turning, in an equal quantity of cold spring water. Let the mixture stand for 2 or 3 days to ferment, and stir it frequently with a wooden spoon, taking care to place the vessel in a warm situation. Then pass the liquor through .a hair sieve, squeezing the pulp until it is quite dry. lor every gallon of the liquor put 31 lbs. of the coarsest East India sugar, which must be placed in another vessel, and the acid liquor poured upon it. Allow it to stand 2 or 3 days, inChap.

A cask which has held brandy is to be preferred. Put in the bung after the expiration of the month; lay a piece of coarse cloth over it, and cover the whole with a thick coat of resin. Let it stand 12 months, and then bottle it.a Pink Champagne.—Boil 9 lbs. of lump-sugar in 3 gallons of water for £ an hour, skim it well, and pour the liquor boil- ing hot over a gallon of red and white currants picked, but not bruised. When nearly cold, put in a small teacupful of yeast. Keep it working for 2 days, then strain it through a horse-hair sieve, put it into a small cask with -5- oz. of isinglass. Have rather more liquor than will fill the cask to fill it up as it works over. In about a fortnight bung it up. Let it stand till April ; put into each bottle a lump of double-refined sugar. Let the bottles remain 1 day uncorked. Cork and wire them. They must stand upright in the cellar; when wanted, put a few on their sides for about a week. Grape Champagne to equal foreign.—Gather the grapes when they are just turning, or about half ripe. Pound them in a tub, and to every quart of fruit put 2 quarts of water. Let it stand in a mash-tub for 14 days, then draw it off, and to every gallon of liquor add 3 lbs. of lump-sugar. When the sugar is dissolved, cask it, and, after it has done working, bung it down, In about 6 months it will be fit to drink, when it should be bottled, and the corks tied down, or wired if it is to be kept more than a year. LEMON WINE. 837.—To every gallon of water take 3 lbs. of sugar ; boil it ^ an hour ; pour it on the peel of 4 lemons ; make the juice into a syrup by boiling it with i lb. of the sugar ; mix all well together; when cool lay on it a toast covered with * A sample of this wine was sent to the Horticultural Society of Edin- burgh, and exhibited amongst 70 different sorts, and, being pronounced the best, the honour of the gold medal was awarded to it; but on its being un- derstood that the fruit was of English growth, it was considered as a foreign wine, and therefore not entitled to the prize.

FRONTINIAC.—E. R. 838. —Boil 18 lbs. of white sugar in 6 gallons of water with 2 whites of eggs well beaten. Skim it and put in £ peck of elder-flowers: • do not keep them on the fire : when nearly cold, stir if, and add 6 spoonfuls of lemon-juice and 4 or 5 of yeast; beat the whole well into the liquor. Stir it every day, put 6 lbs. of the best raisins, stoned, into the cask, and tun the wine. Stop it close, and bottle it at the end of 6 months. This wine requires keeping. ELDER WINE.—E. R. 839. —Pour 4 quarts of water upon 8 quarts of berries, and let it stand a day or two; then boil it for about an hour, strain it, and put 3 lbs. of moist sugar to every gallon of wine; then add 1 oz. of cloves and cinnamon, with 2 oz. of ginger; boil it again, and work it with a toast dipped in yeast. Elder-flower Wine.—Take 12 lbs. of loaf-sugar and 6 lbs. of the best raisins, cut small, and boil them in 6 gallons of water for 1 hour. Then take £ a peck of elder-flowers, when ready to shake; put them into the liquor when it is nearly cold, with 4 tablespoonfuls of fresh yeast and 6 of lemon- juice. Let it work 2 days in the tub, then strain it, put it into the barrel, bung it up closely for 2 months, and then bottle it. These are excellent domestic wines, generally taken mulled, witli dry toast; and the flavour will be iuq ved if, while warming, a grating of nutmeg be added. BLACKBERRY WINE.-E. R. 840. —Let the berries bo gathered when fully ripe, and on a dry day. Put them into a tub or cask, with the head out. and with a tap fitted near the bottom ; pour on them as much boiling water as will cover them, or to 6 measures of black- berries 1 of water may be used. As soon as the heat will permit, mash the berries with your hands until they are well broken, and let them stand covered (ill the pulp rises to the top and forms a crust, which it will do in 3 or 4 days.

When the working has ceased, bung it down, and after 6 or 12 months it may be bottled. CLARY WINE. 841. —Boil 15 gallons of water with 45 lbs. of sugar; skim it: when cool, put a little to h pint of yeast, and so by degrees add a little more. In an hour pour the small quantity to the large, pour the liquor on clary-flowers, picked in the dry : the quantity for the above is 12 quarts. Those who gather from their own garden may not have sufficient to put in at once, and may add as they can get them, keeping account of each quart. When it ceases to hiss, and the flowers are all in, stop it for 4 months. Hack it off, empty the barrel of the dregs, and, adding a gallon of the best brandy, stop it up, and let it stand 6 or 8 weeks, then bottle it. COWSLIP WINE. 842. —To every gallon of water weigh 3 lbs. of lump-sugar, boil the quantity \ an hour, taking off the scum as it rises. When cool enough, put to it a crust of toasted bread dipped in thick yeast, let the liquor ferment in a tub 36 hours; then into the cask put for every gallon the peel of 2 and rind of 1 lemon, and both of 1 Seville orange, and 1 gallon of cowslip- pips ; then pour on them the liquor. It must be carefully stirred every day for a week ; then to every 5 gallons put in a bottle of bn^.^y. Let the cask be close stopped, and stand only 6 weejtg jfffore you bottle it off. Use the best corks. GINGER WINE.—E. R. 843. —Boil 9 quarts of water with 6 lbs. of lump-sugar, the rinds of 2 or 3 lemons very thinly pared, with 2 oz. of bruised white ginger, i an hour. Skim. Put f lb. of raisins into the cask: when the liquor is lukewarm, tun it with the juice of 2 lemons strained, and 14 spoonful of yeast. Stir it daily, then put in 4 pint of brandy and \ oz. of isinglass-shavings : stop it up, and bottle it in 6 or 7 weeks. Do not put the lemon-peel into the barrel. 2 kMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXX. 610 Or :—Boil 24 oz. of ginger for an hour in sufficient water to cover it; take 36 good lemons, pare them very thin, and pour the boiling ginger upon the peel. Let it stand a day or two, then squeeze the lemons; strain the juice, and put it into the cask, adding 40 lbs. of fine raw sugar and 14 lbs. of Malaga raisins chopped ; slice the ginger and put it into the cask witli the liquor it was boiled in. Fill up the cask with cold spring water, stir it frequently, and in 1 month put in 2 bottles of brandy, and stop it down. These proportions are for 20 gallons of wine. GINGER BEER.—E. R. 844. —Slice 4 lemons and crush 2 oz. of ginger, add to them 14 lb. of lump-sugar and 2 oz. of cream of tartar, or the same amount of lemon-juice. Pour on it 2 gallons of boiling water, and when nearly cold add a tablespoonful of barm. Bottle it the next morning, and tie down the corks. It will be fit to drink in 2 days. Another.—Pour a gallon of boiling water upon 1 lb. of loaf-sugar, 1 oz. each of ground ginger and cream of tartar, and the peel of 1 lemon ; when cool add the juice of the lemon and a tablespoonful of yeast; cover it and let it stand till the next day ; strain it, taking care not to stir up the sediment; bottle it in stone bottles, tie down the corks, and it will be fit to drink in 2 days. EGG WINE. 845. —Beat an egg, and mix with it a spoonful of cold water ; set on the fire a glass of -white wine, 4 a glass of water, a little sugar, and nutmeg. When it boils, pour it to the egg by degrees, stirring it well: then return the whole into the saucepan, put it on a gentle fire, stir it one way for not more than a minute ; for if it boil, or the egg be stale, it will curdle. Serve with dry toast. Egg wine may be made as above, without warming the egg, and it is then lighter on the stomach, though not so pleasant to the taste. Or :—It may be done Avithout any other preparation than merely breaking the yolk of a raw egg or tAvo into a tumbler of hot negus or spirit and Avater, mixing it all the while: if the Avhites be added, they Avill occasion froth, but not improve the flavour.ENGLISH AVINES. Chap. XXX.] 611 TO MULL WINE. 846. —Boil some spice in a little water till the flavour is gained, then add an equal quantity of port, some sugar and nutmeg ; boil together, and serve with toast. Another way.—Boil a bit of cinnamon and some grated nutmeg a few minutes in a large teacupful of water: then put to it a pint of port wine, and add sugar to your taste; beat it up, and it.will be ready. It may also be made of good British or foreign red wine; and is much used throughout the north of Germany under the name of “ Bischopf.” NEGUS.—E. R. 847. —1 bottle of wine, i lb. of sugar, and a lemon sliced. Pour 3 pints of boiling water upon this mixture, and grate nutmeg to the taste. Such is the common mode of making negus ; for making a single tumblerful, however, as many people prefer to do it in their own way, perhaps a better plan is to use only half the quantity of water, poured boiling hot upon the wine already sweetened and flavoured with nutmeg ; but having in it also a large and very thin cut rind of Seville orange, which gives it a very superior flavour, without any portion of the acid. The negus may be made of either white or red wine ; and, if drunk cold, is called “ sangaree.” The following is a French receipt:—1 lb. of cherries, 4 lbs. of currants, 2 lbs. of black cherries ; squeeze all together, then let it stand in a cool cellar for 3 days; put the juice on the fire in a preserving-pan, and allow it to bubble; add sugar as for raspberry vinegar, and bottle it. This makes a delicious summer beverage. LIQUEURS. AN EXCELLENT METHOD FOR MAKING PUNCH. 848.—Take 2 large fresh lemons with rough skins quite ripe, and some large lumps of double-refined sugar. Rub the sugar over the lemons till it has absorbed all the yellow parts of the skins. Then put into the bowl these lumps, and as 2 it 2612 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXX. much more as the juice of the lemons may be supposed to require ; for no certain weight can be mentioned, as the acidity of a lemon cannot be known till tried, and therefore this must be determined by the taste. Then squeeze the lemon-juice upon the sugar, and with a bruiser press the sugar and the juice particularly well together, for a great deal of the rich- ness and fine flavour of the punch depends on this rubbing and mixing process being thoroughly performed. Then mix this up very well with boiling water (soft water is best), till the whole is rather cool. When this mixture (which is called the sherbet) is to your taste, take brandy and rum in equal quantities, and put them to it, mixing the whole well together again. The quantity of liquor must be according to your taste : 2 good lemons are generally enough to make 4 quarts of punch, including a quart of liquor, with 4 lb. of sugar : but this depends much on taste and on the strength of the spirit. As the pulp is disagreeable to some persons, the sherbet may be strained before the spirit is put in. Some strain the lemon before they put it to the sugar, which is improper; as when the pulp and sugar are well mixed together it adds much to the richness of the punch. When only rum is used, about 4 a pint of porter will soften the punch : and even when both rum and brandy are used, the porter gives a richness, and to some a very pleasant flavour. This receipt has never been in print before, but is greatly admired. It is impossible to take too much pains in all the processes of mixing, and in minding to do them extremely well, that all the different articles may be most thoroughly in- corporated together. Another:—Divide the intended quantity of liquid into 4 portions ; 3 of water, and 1 of spirits. Take enough of syrup or pounded white sugar and lemon-juice, according to taste, and add as much thinly-pared Seville orange-peel as will give it flavour. Mix them up with three parts of old Jamaica rum, and one of real French brandy : then boil the water with a small quantity of green tea, so as to make a weak infusion, and pour it boiling hot, through a muslin strainer, upon the mixture. Let it be made in a deep jug, with a cover to keep it hot, and if you have a little arrack it will make the punch better in flavour; while a small quantity of confectioners calfs-foot jelly will improve its richness.LIQUEURS. Chap. XXX.] 613 George the Fourth's Punch.— 1 bottle of champagne ; 1 pint of white brandy ; 2 tablespoonfuls of rum ; 2 ditto of arrack ; 1 large glass of maraschino ; t pint of pine-apple syrup ; pint of clarified sugar ; 1 pint of green tea ; the peel of 2 Seville oranges and of 1 lemon : squeeze the juice, mix it with the other ingredients, and strain it through a lawn sieve. Tea Punch, a la Chevret.—4 pint of rum, the same quan- tity of brandy, the juice of a lemon, and sugar at discretion, added to a quart of strong tea. Set fire to it, and when it has burned out drink it while quite hot. Colonel Hatcher's Cold Punch.—A wineglass nearly full of the best refined sugar pounded ; 12 ditto of cold spring water; half a wineglassful of lemon-juice; 2 wineglasses brimfull of old Jamaica rum. Let the sugar be well melted and the lemon-juice thoroughly amalgamated with it and the water before adding the rum. Verder, or Milk Punch.—Pare 6 oranges and 6 lemons as thin as you can, grate them with sugar to get the flavour. Steep the peels in a bottle of rum or brandy stopped close 24 hours. Squeeze the fruit on 2 lbs. of sugar, add to it 4 quarts of water, and 1 of new milk boiling-hot; stir the rum into the above, and run it through a jelly-bag till perfectly clear. Bottle, and cork close immediately. Or:—Take the rinds of 30 lemons pared very thin, steep them for 3 days in 2 quarts of rum; then pour them into a vessel, adding 3 quarts more of rum, 3 quarts of water, 1 of lemon-juice, 4 lbs. of loaf-sugar, and 2 nutmegs grated. Dis- solve the sugar in the water ; mix all together, and then pour upon the ingredients 2 quarts of milk boiling hot. Stir it well together, and let it stand 2 hours ; then strain it through a jelly-bag till perfectly clear, much depending upon clearing it well. Norfolk Punch.—In 20 quarts of French brandy put the peels of 30 lemons and 30 oranges, pared so thin that not the least of the white is left. Infuse 12 hours. Have ready 30 quarts of cold water that has boiled ; put to it 15 lbs. of • double-refined sugar; and, when well mixed, pour it upon the brandy and peels, adding the juice of the oranges and of 24 lemons; mix well; then strain through a very fine hair sieve into a very clean barrel that has held spirits, and putMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY.

This liquor will keep many years, and is improved by age. Or:—Pare 6 lemons and 3 Seville oranges very thin, squeeze the juice into a large jar, and put to it 2 quarts of brandy, 1 of white wine, 1 of milk, and H lb. of sugar. Let it be mixed, and then covered for 24 hours : strain through a jelly-bag till clear, then bottle it. Orange Punch.—Dissolve nearly i lb. of sugar in a little water, add the juice of 2 lemons, and pour 2 quarts of boiling water upon it for the sherbet; then add a glass of calf’s-foot jelly. Mix together a bottle of brandy, a bottle of rum, and 1 of orange-wine, add it to the sherbet, and drink it either hot or cold. If bottled, and placed in a cold cellar, it will keep for any time. The orange wine imparts a very fine flavour, which may be heightened by the addition of a bottle of liqueur, cura^oa, or maraschino. Regent's Punch.—Make the sherbet with green tea, capil- laire, and lemon-juice ; to 5 pints of this mixture add 1 pint of rum, 1 of brandy, 1 of arrack, and a bottle of cura(;oa, together with a small jar or shape of Guava jelly. Pour in a bottle of champagne, and send up the punch in a bowl or jug, with a pine-apple sliced into it. An excellent liqueur.—Stick 6 cloves into a fine ripe China orange, put it into a glass jar, adding 4 lb. of the finest moist sugar. Pour over it a quart of good brandy, tie a bladder over the jar, and over that a pasted paper. Set it in the sun, or in a warm place, for 3 or 4 weeks, shaking it gently every day till the sugar is thoroughly dissolved ; strain it off and bottle it. This is a very fine stomachic. SHH UB.—E.

NO YEA IT.—E. R. 850. —The real liqueur under this name is made in the island of Martinique, upon a foundation of French brandy, with a species of berry grown in the island, and sweetened with syrup. It requires age to give it the flavour of the berry, and even in the West Indies is far from being cheap. The following receipts, however, are good imitations. Blanch 3 oz. of bitter and the same quantity of sweet almonds, and bruise them in a mortar; add them, with the Tind of 2 lemons, to 1 quart of English gin, which must be kept in a moderate heat for 3 days and nights. Shake the bottle 3 or 4 times a-day, then add 14 oz. of loaf-sugar dis- solved in 4 a pint of boiling water, and let it stand 1 day and night longer, shaking the bottle frequently ; then strain it, and filter it afterwards in blotting-paper such as the chemists use: bottle it, and it will be fit to drink in 6 months, but will improve by keeping for a year. Or :—To 1 quart of English gin, or what is better of good French brandy, put 3 oz. of bitter almonds, blanched and cut into pieces, and the rind of 3 lemons. Let it stand 3 days before the fire, shaking the bottle 2 or 3 times a-day; then add 1 lb. of good loaf-sugar, or 4 a pint of syrup ; let it dis- solve, shaking it frequently during the day or two which it will take; then filter it through blotting-paper.

Dis- solve i lb. of white sugar-candy in a cup of cold water, and add to the brandy after it has stood a month on the kernels, and they are strained off; then filter through paper, and bottle for use. The distilled leaves of peaches and nectarines, when the trees are cut in the spring, are an excellent substitute for ratafia in puddings. Ratafie des Quatre Fruits.—Take 30 lbs. of cherries, 15 of gooseberries, 8 of raspberries, and 6 of black currants; stone the cherries, and press the juice out of all the fruit: to each pint of juice put 6 oz. of pounded sugar.

It may be necessary to premise that a choice should be made of those things most likely to agree with the patient, and, as invalids require variety to indulge their appetite, fre- quent changes should be provided, but great simplicity ob- served in the preparation. Perhaps jellies and meat broths, together with various kinds of farinaceous food, are the lightest on the stomach, as well as, generally speaking, the most nutritious. JELLIES. 860.—A good Jelly.—Soak 12 shanks of mutton 4 hours, then brush and scour them very clean. Lay them in a saucepan with 3 blades of mace, an onion, 20 Jamaica and 30 or 40 black peppers, a bunch of sweet herbs, and a crust of bread made very brown by toasting. Pour 3 quarts of water to them, and set them on a hot hearth close covered ; let them simmer as gently as possible for 5 hours, then strain it off, and put it in a cold place. This may have the addition of a pound of beef, if approved, for flavour. It is a remarkably good thing for people who are weak. Sheep’s heads and trotters are also good restoratives; savoury jelly may also be made in the same manner, without lemon, wine, or sugar, but flavoured with ham and spice. Dr. Ratcliffe's Pork Jelly.—Take a leg of well-fed pork, just as cut up; beat it, and break the bone. Set it over a gentle fire with 3 gallons of water,, and simmer to 1. Let i oz. of mace and the same of nutmegs stew in it. Strain through a fine sieve. When cold, take off the fat.

Calf s Feet.—Bake 2 calf’s feet in 2 pints of water and the same quantity of new milk, in a jar, close covered, 3? hours. When cold, remove the fat. Give a large teacupful the first and last thing. Whichever flavour is approved, give it by baking in it lemon-peel, cinna- mon, or mace. Add sugar afterwards. Sheep's Trotters.—Simmer 6 sheep’s trotters, 2 blades of mace, a little cinnamon, lemon-peel, a few hartshorn shavings, and a little isinglass, in 2 quarts of water, to 1 ; when cold, take off the fat, and give nearly 4 a pint twice a-day, warming with it a little new milk. Isinglass.—Boil l oz. of isinglass shavings, 40 Jamaica peppers, and a bit of brown crust of bread, in a quart of water, to a pint, and strain it. This makes a pleasant jelly to keep in the house; of which a large spoonful may be taken in wine and water, milk, tea, soup, or any way most agreeable. Arrowroot.-—It is very necessary to be careful not to get the counterfeit sort; if genuine, it is very nourishing, espe- cially for persons with weak bowels. Put into a saucepan 4 a pint of water, a glass of sherry or a spoonful of brandy, grated nutmeg, and fine sugar; boil up once, then mix it by degrees into a dessertspoonful of arrowroot, previously rubbed smooth with 2 spoonfuls of cold water. Or:—Mix a dessertspoonful of arrowroot with a little cold water, have ready boiling water in a kettle, pour it upon the arrowroot until it becomes quite clear, keeping it stirred all the time ; add a little sugar. Where milk may be taken, it is very delicious made in the same way with milk instead of water, a dessertspoonful of arrowroot, and i a pint of milk; add a small bit of lemon-peel. Potato.—We learn Irom the £ Gardener’s Chronicle’ that potato-starch is sold at from 1a. to 3a. the lb., though it might be prepared at home witli no other means than a little trouble, with a grater and a sieve. “ To obtain Potato Jelly in perfection, let a potato be621 Chap. XXXI.] COOKERY FOR THE SICK. washed, peeled, and grated ; throw the pulp, thus procured, into a jug of water, and stir it well. Pass the mixture of pulp and water over a sieve, and collect the water which drains through into a basin. Let this stand for a few minutes, and a sufficient quantity of starch will have fallen for the purpose required. Pour off the water, and then keep stirring up the starch at the bottom of the basin, while boiling water is being poured upon it, and it will soon and suddenly pass to the state of a jelly. The only nicety required is to be careful that the water is absolutely boiling, otherwise the change will not take place. It does not require more than 8 minutes to change a raw potato into a basinful of most excellent jelly, which has only to be seasoned with a little sugar, nutmeg, and white wine, to please the most fastidious taste.” a Tapioca.—Choose the largest sort, pour cold water on to wash it 2 or 3 times; then soak it in fresh water 5 or 6 hours, and simmer it in the same until it becomes quite clear ; then put lemon-juice, wine, and sugar. The peel should have been boiled in it. It thickens very much. Bread.—Take a penny roll, pare off the crust, and cut the crumb into thin slices ; toast them on both sides of a light pale brown. Put them into a quart of spring water, let it simmer gently over the fire until the liquid becomes a jelly, strain it through a thin cloth, and flavour it with a little lemon-juice and sugar, added when hot. If wine be permit- ted, it is an improvement. This jelly is of so strengthening a nature, that 1 teaspoonful affords more nourishment than a teacupful of any other. It may be prepared without the lemon- juice and sugar, and a teaspoonful put into every liquid the patient takes, such as tea, coffee, broth, or beef tea. Gloucester Jelly is made with rice, sago, pearl-barley, harts- horn-shavings, and eringo-root, each 1 oz.; simmer with 3 pints of water to 1, and strain it. When cold it will be a jelly. It may be taken dissolved in wine, milk, or broth, as a variety, with other nourishment. BROTHS. 861.— Of Beef Mutton, and VeaL^-Vut 2 lbs. of lean beef, 1 lb. of scrag of veal, 1 lb. of scrag of mutton, sweet herbs, and 10 peppercorns, into a nice tin saucepan, with 5 8 G. R. 1 Family Herald.’622 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXXI. quarts of water; simmer to 3 quarts, and clear off the fat when cold. Add 1 onion, if approved. Soup or broth made of different meats is more supporting as well as better flavoured. To remove the fat, take it off when cold as clean as pos- sible ; and if there be still any remaining, lay a bit of clean blotting-paper on the broth when in the basin, and it will take up every particle. Or, if the broth is wanted before there is time to let it get cold, put a piece of cork up the narrow end of a funnel, pour the broth into it, let it stand for a few minutes, and the fat will rise to the top ; remove the cork, and draw off in a basin as much of the broth as is wanted, which will be perfectly free from fat. Caf’s-feet Broth.—Boil 2 feet in 3 quarts of water till reduced to k ; strain and set it by ; when to be used, take off the fat, put a large teacupful of the jelly into a saucepan, with i a glass of sweet wine, a little sugar and nutmeg, and beat it up till it is quite hot; then take a little of it and add by degrees to the yolk of an egg, well beaten with a bit of butter the size of a nutmeg; stir it all together, but do not let it boil. Grate a piece of fresh lemon-peel into it. Or:—Boil 2 calf’s-feet, 2 oz. of veal, and 2 of beef, the bottom of a penny loaf, 2 or 3 blades of mace, i a nutmeg sliced, and a little salt, in 3 quarts of water, to 3 pints ; strain, and take off the fat. Chicken Broth may be made of any young fowl which is afterwards to be brought to table; but the best sort is to be procured from an old cock or hen, which is to be stewed down to rags, with a couple of onions, seasoned with salt and a little whole pepper; skim and strain it. A lueaker kind.—After taking oft1 the skin and rump, put the body and legs of a fowl, from the white meat of which chicken panada has been made, into the water it was boiled in, with 1 blade of mace, 1 slice of onion, and 10 white pepper- corns. Simmer till the broth be of a pleasant flavour. If not water enough, add a little. Beat \ oz. of sweet almonds with a teaspoinful of wafer, boil it in the broth, strain, and when cold remove the fat. Eel Broth.—Clean i lb. of small eels, and set them on with 3 pints of water, some parsley, 1 slice of onion, a few pepper- corns ; let them simmer till the eels are broken, and the brothChap. XXXI.] COOKERY FOR THE SICK. 623 good, or reduced to H pint. Add salt, and strain it off. It is very nutritious. A clear Broth that will keep long.—Put the mouse-round of beef, a knuckle-bone of veal, and a few shanks of mutton, into a deep pan, and cover close with a dish or coarse crust; bake till the beef is done enough for eating, with only as much water as will cover it. When the broth is cold, cover it close, and keep it in a cool place. When it is to be used, give what flavour may be best liked. For a quick-made Broth.—Take a bone or two of a neck or loin of mutton, take off the fat and skin, set it on the fire in a small tin saucepan that has a cover, with -J of a pint of water, the meat being first beaten and cut in thin bits ; put a bit of thyme and parsley, and, if approved, a slice of onion. Let it boil very quickly ; skim it; take off the cover if likely to be too weak, else cover it. Half an hour is sufficient for the whole process. A broth very supporting against any kind of weakness may be made of 2 lbs. of loin of mutton, with a very large handful of chervil in 2 quarts of water. Take off part of the fat. Any other herbs or roots may be added. Give 4 a pint 3 or 4 times a-day. Or:—Put the knuckle of a leg or shoulder of veal with very little meat to it, an old fowl, 4 shank-bones of mutton extremely well soaked and bruised, 3 blades of mace, 10 pep- percorns, an onion, a large bit of bread, and 3 quarts of water, into a stewpot that covers close; simmer in the slowest manner after it has boiled up and been skimmed ; or bake it; strain, and take off the fat. Salt as wanted. It will require 4 hours. On the subject of shimming off the fat which rises on the broth, an eminent physician has stated that, “ in cases of coughs and colds which affect the chest, the fat should not be re- moved: more particularly that of mutton broth, which is eminently useful in calming the irritation of the lungs.” An excellent Soup for the weakly is made by putting 2 cow-heels and a breast of mutton into a large pan with 4 oz. of rice, 1 onion, 20 Jamaica peppers and 20 black, a turnipj a carrot, and 4 gallons of water; cover with brown paper, and bake 6 hours. Or;—Put a teacupful of sago into a quart of water, and a624 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXXI. bit of lemon-peel; when thickened grate some ginger, and add | a pint of raisin wine, brown sugar, and 2 spoonfuls of geneva ; boil all up together. This is a most supporting soup for those whom disease has left very feeble. Caudle for the sick and lying-in.—Set 3 quarts of water on the fire; mix smooth as much oatmeal as will thicken the whole with a pint of cold water ; when boiling, pour the latter in, and 20 Jamaica peppers in fine powder; boil to a good middling thickness; then add sugar, 4 a pint of well- fermented table-beer, and a glass of gin : boil all together. This mess sent to any poor woman twice, and broth once or twice, will be of incalculable service. There is not a better occasion for charitable commiseration than when a person is sick. A bit of meat or pudding sent unexpectedly has often been the means of recalling long-lost appetite. A really good cook for the sick is rarely met with ; and many who possess all the goods of fortune have attributed the first return of health to an appetite excited by what is called good kitchen physic. BEEF TEA.—E. 11. 862. —Cut 1 lb. of fleshy beef in thin slices ; simmer with a quart of water hour after it has once boiled and been skimmed. Season, if approved ; but it wants generally only salt. To drink cold.—Take 1 lb. of lean beef, clear it from every particle of skin, fat, or sinew, rasp or divide it into very small pieces; then put it into a jar, and pour a quart of boiling water upon it; plunge the jar into a kettle of boiling water, let it stand by the side of the fire, but not near enough to simmer, and allow it to grow cold. Then strain the beef- tea through a muslin sieve, and, if the patient be very delicate, filter it through blotting-paper. This tea is to be taken when cold, and will remain upon the stomach when other nourishment fails; it may be given to infants. EGGS. 863. —An egg broken into a cup of tea, or beaten and mixed with a basin of milk, makes a breakfast more supporting than tea alone.Chap. XXXI.] COOKERY FOR THE SICK. 625 An egg divided, and the yolk and white beaten separately, with a little wine put to each, will afford 2 very wholesome draughts, and prove lighter than when taken together. Eggs very little boiled, or poached, taken in small quantity, convey much nourishment: the yolk only, when dressed, should be eaten by invalids. PANADA is merely a preparation of bread made up in various ways. 864. —To make it in five minutes.—Set a little water on the fire with a glass of white wine, some sugar, and a scrape of nut- meg and lemon-peel: meanwhile grate some crumbs of bread. The moment the mixture boils up, keeping it still on the fire, put the crumbs in, and let it boil as fast as it can. When of a proper thickness just to drink, take it off. Another hj.—Make as above, but, instead of a glass of wine, put in a teaspoonful of rum and a bit of butter; sugar as above. This is a most pleasant mess, but will most pro- bably be objected to by the physician. Or :—Put to the water a bit of lemon-peel, mix the crumbs in, and, when nearly boiled enough, put some lemon or orange syrup. Observe to boil all the ingredients, for, if any be added after, the panada will break and not jelly. Chicken Panada.—Boil a chicken till about three parts ready in a quart of rvater; take off the skin, cut the white meat off when cold, and put into a marble mortar : pound it to a paste with a little of the water it was boiled it, season with salt, a grate of nutmeg, and the least bit of lemon-peel. Boil gently for a few minutes to the consistency you like; it should be such as you can drink, though tolerably thick. This conveys great nourishment in a small compass. SIPPETS, when the stomach will not receive meat, are very nutritious, and prepared in this simple manner:— 865. —On an extremely hot plate put 2 or 3 sippets of bread, and pour over them some gravy from beef, mutton, or veal, with which no butter has been mixed. Sprinkle a little salt over. Or :—Take a French roll; cut it crosswise in slices of about 2 s626 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXXI. * of an inch thick, and soak them in boiled milk until they have imbibed as much as they will take; then drain them, cover them with a coating of egg-batter, and fry them in a cheese- toaster. When served, powder them simply with white sugar with or without a slight grating of nutmeg. CA UDLE 866.—Is made in various ways. Make a fine smooth gruel of half-grits; strain it when boiled well; stir it at different times till cold. When to be used, add sugar, wine, and lemon- peeL, with nutmeg. Some like a spoonful of brandy besides the wine ; others like lemon-juice. Or .-—Boil up 4 a pint of fine gruel, with a bit of butter the size of a large nutmeg, a large spoonful of brandy, the same of white wine, 1 of capillaire, a bit of lemon-peel, and nutmeg. Another.—Into a pint of fine gruel, not thick, put, while it is boiling-hot, the yolk of an egg beaten with sugar, and mixed with a large spoonful of cold water, a glass of wine, and nut- meg. Mix by degrees. It is very agreeable and nourishing. Some like gruel, with a glass of table-beer, sugar, &c., with or without a teaspoonful of brandy. Posset.—Boil the grated crumb of a penny loaf in a pint of water, with the grated peel of a Seville orange, till the mix- ture be clear and thick: then add 3 oz. of sweet and 1 oz. of bitter almonds, i the juice of an orange or any other kind of fruit, 4 oz. of sugar, and 1 pint of mountain wine. Cold Caudle.—Boil a pint of spring-water; when cold, add the yolk of an egg, the juice of a small lemon, 6 spoonfuls of sweet wine, sugar to your taste, and syrup of lemons 1 oz. Flour Caudle.—Into 5 large spoonfuls of water rub smooth 1 dessertspoonful of fine flour. Set over the fire 5 spoon- fuls of new milk, and put 2 bits of sugar into it; the moment it boils pour into it the flour and water, and stir it over a slow fire 20 minutes. It is a nourishing and gently astringent food. This is an excellent food for babies who have weak bowels. Rice Caudle.—When the water boils, pour into it some ground rice mixed with a little cold water; when of a proper consistence, add sugar, lemon-peel, and cinnamon, and a glass of brandy to a quart. Boil all smooth.Chap. XXXI.] COOKER? FOR THE SICK. 627 Or;—Soak some Carolina rice in water an hour, strain it, and put 2 spoonfuls of the rice into li pint of milk ; simmer till it will pulp through a sieve; then put the pulp and milk into the saucepan, with a bruised clove and a bit of white sugar. Simmer 10 minutes; if too thick, add a spoonful or two of milk ; and serve with thin toast. VARIO US PREPARA TIONS. 867.—Saloop.—Boil a little water, wine, lemon-peel, and sugar together ; then mix with a small quantity of the powder, previously rubbed smooth with a little cold water; stir it all together, and boil it a few minutes. Milk Porridge.—Make a fine gruel of half-grits, long boiled ; strain off; either add cold milk, or warm with milk, as may be approved. French Milk Porridge.—Stir some oatmeal and water toge- ther ; let it stand to be clear, and pour off the latter; pour fresh water upon it, stir it well, let it stand till next day ; strain through a fine sieve, and boil the water, adding milk. The proportion of water must be small. Abroad this is much ordered, with toast, for the breakfast of weak persons. Sago.—To prevent the earthy taste soak' it in cold water 1 hour, pour that off, and wash it well; then add more, and sim- mer gently till the seeds are clear, with lemon-peel and spice, if approved. Add wine and sugar, and boil all up together. Sago Milk.—Cleanse as above, and boil it slowly, and wholly with new milk. It swells so much, that a small quan- tity will be sufficient for a quart, and when done it will be diminished to about a pint. It requires no sugar or flavouring. Ground Rice Milk.—Boil 1 spoonful of ground rice, rubbed down smooth, with l£ pint of milk, a bit of cinnamon, lemon- peel, and nutmeg. Sweeten when nearly done. Water Gruel.—Put a large spoonful of oatmeal by degrees into a pint of water, and when smooth boil it. Or:—Hub smooth 1 large spoonful of oatmeal with 2 of water, and pour it into a pint of water boiling on the lire; stir it well and boil it quickly, but take care it does not boil over. In ^ of an hour strain it off; when eaten add salt and a bit of butter. Stir until the butter be incorporated. 2 s 2628 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXXI. Barley Gruel.—Wash 4 oz. of pearl-barley ; boil if. in 2 quarts of water with a stick of cin- namon, till reduced to a quart; strain and return it into the saucepan with sugar and f pint of port wine. Heat up, and use as wanted. THE ETNA. 868.—This useful little machine is almost indispensable in a sick-room. It enables you to have a pint of water boiled in a few minutes by means of a small quantity of spirits of wine burnt in the saucer under the cup. A little measure is sold with it, by which the quantity re- quired can be regulated according to whether the fluid to be heated is required to be boiled or not. ASSES' MILK 869.—Far surpasses any imitation of it that can be made. It should be milked into a glass that is kept warm by being in a basin of hot water. The fixed air that it contains gives some people a pain in the stomach. At first a teaspoonful of rum may be taken with it, but should only be put in the moment it is to be swal- lowed. The animal should always be milked at the door. Artificial Asses' Milk.—Boil together 1 quart of water, 1 quart of new milk, 1 oz. of white sugar-candy, ^ oz. of eringo-root, and oz. of conserve of roses, till half be wasted. This is astringent, therefore proportion the doses to the effect, and the quantity to what will be used while sweet. Or:—Mix 2 spoonfuls of boiling water, 2 of milk, and an egg well beaten; sweeten with pounded white sugar-candy. This may be taken twice or thrice a day. Or:—Boil 2 oz. of hartshorn shavings, 2 oz. of pearl-barley, 2 oz. of candied eringo-root, and 1 dozen of snails that have been bruised, in 2 quarts of water to 1. Mix xvith an equal quantity of new milk when taken twice a-day. It should, however, be observed, that, although these pre- parations are all good in a certain degree, and some perhapsChap. XXXI.] COOKERY FOR THE SICK. 629 better, in a medical point of view, yet they do not afford the nutriment obtained from the original milk, especially in con- sumptive complaints. DR. BOERHAAVE'S SWEET BUTTERMILK. 870. —Take the milk from the cow into a small chnrn ; in about 10 minutes begin churning, and continue till the flakes of butter swim about pretty thick, and the milk is discharged of all the greasy particles, and appears thin and blue. Strain it through a sieve, and drink it frequently. It should form the whole of the patient’s drink, and the food should be biscuits and rusks in every way and sort, ripe and dried fruits of various kinds, when a decline is appre- hended. Baked and dried fruits—raisins in particular-—make excel- lent suppers for invalids, with biscuits or common cake. Buttermilk, although thus recommended and generally thought most agreeable when made from sweet cream, is, however, by some preferred when sour, and is considered as more wholesome when in that state, as being lighter on the stomach. WHEY.—E. R. 871. —Put 1 pint of warm milk into a vessel before the fire, and add to it i a tablespoonful of rennet. When the curd forms, cut it into squares to allow the whey to escape. Then put it on a sieve, and drain it carefrdly. The milk may also be turned with lemon-juice; and the curds may be eaten with sugar and nutmeg, but not by a sick person. In Ireland rennet is never used for this purpose ; the mode there being to turn the sweet milk with a mixture of sour but- termilk. It is then called “ two-milk whey,” and is far pre- ferable to the English plan, having a slight but most pleasant acidity, and a greenish hue of perfect transparency. White Wine Whey.—Put I pint of new milk on the fire ; the moment it boils up pour in as much sound raisin wine as will completely turn it, and make it look clear ; let it boil up, then set the saucepan aside till the curd subsides, and do not stir it. Pour the whey off, and add to it £ pint of boiling water and a bit of white sugar. Thus you will have a whey perfectly cleared of milky particles, and as weak as you choose to make it.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXXI. 630 Vinegar and Lemon Whey.—Pour into boiling milk as much vinegar or lemon-juice as will make a small quantity quite clear, dilute with hot water to an agreeable acid, add a bit or two of sugar. This is less heating than if made of wine, and, if only to excite perspiration, answers as well. DRINKS. 872.—A soft and fine draught for those who are weak and have a cough may be made thusBeat a fresh-laid egg, and mix it with pint of new milk warmed, a large spoonful of capillaire, the same of rose-water, and a little nutmeg scraped. Do not warm it after the egg is put in. Take it the first and last thing. A very agreeable draught is made by putting into a tumbler of fresh cold water a tablespoonful of capillaire and the same of good vinegar. Tamarinds, currants, fresh or in jelly, or scalded currants or cranberries, make excellent drinks, with a little sugar or not as may be agreeable. A refreshing Drink in a Fever.—Put a little tea-sage, 2 sprigs of balm, and a little wood-sorrel, into a stone jug, having first washed and dried them ; peel thin a small lemon, and clear from the white; slice it, and put a bit of the peel in; then pour in 3 pints of boiling water, sweeten and cover it close. Perhaps no drink, however, is more refreshing in such a case than weak green tea, into which lemon-juice is infused in- stead of milk. It may be drunk either-cold or hot, but the latter is the best mode. Toast and Water.—Toast slowly a thin piece of bread till extremely brown and hard, but not the least black; then plunge it into a jug of cold water, and cover it over an hour before used. This is of particular use in weak bowels. It should be of a fine brown colour. Barley- Water.—1 oz. of pearl barley, k oz. of white sugar, and the rind of a lemon, put into a jug. Pour upon it 1 quart of boiling water, and let it stand for 8 or 10 hours; then strain off the liquor, adding a slice of lemon, if desirable. This infusion makes a most delicious and nutritious beverage, and will be grateful to persons who cannot drink the horrid decoction usually given. It is an admirable basis for lemon-Chap. XXXI.] COOKERY FOR THE SICK. 631 ade, negus, or weak punch, a glass of rum being the proportion for a quart. v Barley Water with Honey.—Add the juice and rind of 1 lemon to 1 tablespoonful of honey and 2 teacupfuls of barley ; put it into a jug, and pour a quart of boiling water upon it. Barley Water with Isinglass.—A tablespoonful of pearl- barley, 6 lumps of loaf sugar, i a lemon, and enough isinglass to clear it. Pour 2 quarts of boiling spring water on these ingredients, and let it stand-until cold. Soda Water.—Dissolve 6 drachms of dried carbonate, of soda in a quart bottle of water, and 4p drachms of tartaric acid in another bottle of the same size ; pour out a wineglassful from each bottle, and throw them at the same time into a tumbler, when it will immediately effervesce; it should be drunk in this state. This is a good soda water, and a dozen glasses thus pre- pared will not cost more than Is. 3cl. or Is. 6cl. If 10 drops of the muviated tincture of iron be previously put into the tum- bler a most excellent and agreeable tonic mineral water is pro- duced, which strengthens the tone of the digestive organs in a very remarkable degree. Lemon Water is also a delightful drink. Put 2 slices of lemon thinly pared into a teapot, a little bit of the peel, and a large spoonful of capillaire ; pour in a pint of boiling water, and stop it close 2 hours. A refreshing Brink for the Sick.—Boil 2 oz. of hartshorn shavings in 1 quart of water ; when quite dissolved set it aside to settle, and before it is cold strain it through a tammy upon 4 a lemon sliced thin, with sugar to taste ; cover it, and let it remain till cold, mixing with it a glass of Moselle or French wine. Apple Water is very delicate. Cut 2 large apples in slices, and pour 1 quart of boiling water on them; or on roasted apples ; strain in 2 or 3 hours, and sweeten lightly. Or :—Peel and quarter 4 large rennet apples, or any other firm acid apple. Put them into 1 quart of water with the peel of 4 a lemon and a handful of washed currants ; let all boil for 1 hour, then strain it; add sugar to taste. Let it stand till cold. A little wine may be added to it when about to be drunk. Orgeat.—Beat 2 oz. of almonds witli a teaspoonful of orange-MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXXI. 632 flower water and a bitter almond or two : then pour 1 quart of milk and water to the paste. Sweeten with sugar or capil- laire. This is a fine drink for those who have a tender chest; in the gout it is highly useful, and with the addition of ^ oz. of gum arabic has been found to allay the painfulness of the attendant heat. 4 a glass of brandy may be added if thought too cooling in the latter complaints, and the glass of orgeat may be put into a basin of warm water. Orangeade, or Lemonade.—Squeeze the juice, pour boiling water on a little of the peel, and cover close. Boil water and sugar to a thin syrup, and skim it. When all are cold, mix the juice, the infusion, and the syrup, with as much more water as will make a rich sherbet; strain through a jelly-bag. Or :■—Squeeze the juice, and strain it, and add water and capillaire. It is, however, still better when made with the juice of unripe grapes. The usual mode, however, of making Lemonade is to pour 1 quart of boiling water on the rinds of 6 lemons, and let it stand for 3 or 4 hours ; add the juice of the lemons witli ! lb. of sugar ; simmer it wel l and skim it; then add another quart of boiling water. Either run it through a jelly-bag, or mix a glass of calf’s-foot jelly, which will make it rich. Tamarinds, or Cranberry Juice, with double the quantity of water, also form a pleasant drink for an invalid, when ap- proaching to convalescence.633 Chap. XXXII.] VARIOUS RECEIPTS. CHAPTER XXXII. VARIOUS RECEIPTS AND DIRECTIONS TO SERVANTS. VARIOUS RECEIPTS. 873.—Indian Cure for Rheumatism.—Lemon-grass oil mixed with sweet oil, in the proportion of 1 spoonful of the former to 2 of the latter, and rubbed on the part affected. Hooping Cough.—The following remedy has been the means of curing hundreds of persons, but it must be steadily applied, and if the disease is not of long standing a sensible amendment will be perceived in about a fortnight. A friend of above 50 years of age was cured by it after many other remedies had failed. Oil of amber (the foreign is the best) to be rubbed every night at bedtime on the palm of the hands, the soles of the feet, the small of the back, and the pit of the stomach. The oil, if good, is so essential that 4 a teaspoonful is enough for a child at one time of rubbing. Or:—A dozen cloves of garlic steeped in •§ pint of rum for 24 hours : rub a dessertspoonful over the pit of the stomach at bedtime. This has been found of great benefit. A Cure for Chilblains.—Take of ammoniac gum (the real drop) h oz. ; reduce it into a smooth pulp with as little water as possible; then add 4 oz. of extract of hemlock, and 3 drachms of the strongest mercurial ointment; the whole to be well mixed together. When used it should be spread on soft leather and sewed on the feet, and need not be removed above once a week. For recent chilblains, and for their pre- vention, this plaister is infallible. The above quantity is sufficient for a family of 3 or 4 children for the winter if their feet are properly attended to. For a Cough.—Take of treacle and the best white wine634 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXXII. vinegar 6 tablespoonfuls each, add 40 drops of laudanum; mix it well and put it into a bottle. A teaspoonful to be taken occasionally when the cough is troublesome. A Remedy for a Burn or Scald.—Apply immediately a thick covering of wool to the burnt part, and bind it on tight; in the course of 4 an hour very little pain will be felt, and scarcely any blister will remain. As this remedy is so simple, no housekeeper should be without loose wool at hand in case of an accident. This remedy was discovered by the child of a woolcomber having been dreadfully scalded : its mother laid it in a basket of newly carded wool whilst she ran for a doctor; when she returned she found the child fast asleep amongst the wool, and when it awoke the excessive pain had subsided. We have frequently tried it, and invariably with success. To destroy Warts.—Dissolve as much common washing soda as the water will take up ; wash the warts with this for a minute or two, and let them dry without wiping. Keep the water in a bottle and repeat the washing often, and it will take away the largest warts. Before applying a blister rub the part over with a few drops of olive-oil; this will make the blister act quicker and with less irritation. FOR THE DRESSING-TABLE. 874.— To make soft Pomatum.—Beat 4 lb. of unsalted fresh lard in common water ; then soak and beat it in 2 rose-waters, drain it, and beat it with 2 spoonfuls of brandy ; let it drain from this; add to it some essence of lemon, and keep it in small pots. Or:—Soak 4 lb. of clear beef-marrow, and 1 lb. of un- salted fresh lard, in Avater, 2 or 3 days, changing and beating it every day. Put it into a sieve, and, when dry, into a jar, and the jar into a saucepan of water. When melted, pour it into a basin, and beat it with 2 spoonfuls of brandy; drain oft the brandy, and then add essence of lemon, bergamot, or any other scent that is liked. Hard Pomatum. — Prepare equal quantities of beef- marrow and mutton-suet as before, using the brandy to pre- serve it, and adding the scent; then pour it into moulds, or, if you have none, into phials of the size you choose the rolls to be. When cold, break the bottles, clear away the glass carefully, and put paper round the rolls.635 Chap. XXXII.] VARIOUS RECEIPTS. Or :—Take equal quantities of marrow, melted and strained, lard, and castor-oil; warm all together; add any scent you please ; stir until cold and put into pots. Pomade Divine.—Clear TV lb. of beef-marrow from the strings and bone, put it into an earthen pan or vessel of water fresh from the spring, and change the water night and morning for 10 days; then steep it in rose-water 24 hours, and drain it in a cloth till quite dry. Take an oz. of each of the following articles, namely, storax, gum-benjamin, and odoriferous cypress powder, i oz. of cinnamon. 2 drachms of cloves, and 2 drachms of nutmeg, all finely powdered; mix them with the marrow above prepared; then put all the ingredients into a pewter pot that holds 3 pints; make a paste of white of egg and flour, and lay it upon a piece of rag. Over that must be another piece of linen to cover the top of the pot very close, that none of the steam may evaporate. Put the pot into a large copper pot with water, observing to keep it steady, that it may not reach to the covering of the pot that holds the marrow. As the water shrinks, add more, boiling hot; for it must boil 4 hours without ceasing a moment. Strain the ointment througli a linen cloth into small pots, and, when cold, cover them. Do not touch it with anything but silver. It will keep many years. A fine pomatum may be made by putting 1 lb. of fresh marrow, prepared as above, and 2 oz. of hog’s lard, on the ingredients, and then observing the same process as before. Pot-pourri.—Put into a large china jar the following in- gredients in layers, with bay-salt strewed between the layers :— 2 pecks of damask-roses, part in buds and part blown ; violets, orange-flowers, and jasmine, a handful of each ; orris-root sliced, benjamin, and storax, 2 oz. of each ; i oz. of musk ; \ lb. of angelica-root sliced; a quart of the red parts of clove-gilly- flowers ; 2 handfuls of lavender-flowers ; £ a handful of rose- mary-flowers ; bay and laurel leaves, i a handful of each; 3 Seville oranges, stuck as full of cloves as possible, dried in a cool oven, and pounded ; i a handful of knotted marjoram ; and 2 handfuls of balm of Gilead dried. Cover all quite close. When the pot is uncovered the perfume is very fine. A quicker sort of Sweet Pot-pourri.—Take 3 handfuls of orange-flowers, 3 of clove-gillyflowers, 3 of damask-roses, 1 of knotted marjoram, 1 of lemon-thyme, 6 bay-leaves, a handfulMODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXXII. 636 of rosemary, 1 of myrtle, £ of mint, 1 of lavender, the rind of a lemon, and £ oz. of cloves. Chop all, and put them in layers, with pounded bay-salt between, up to the top of the jar. If all the ingredients cannot be got at once, put them in as you get them ; always throwing in salt with every new article. To make Wash-balls.—Shave thin 2 lbs. of new white soap into about a teacupful of rose-water, then pour as much boiling water on as will soften it. Put into a brass pan a pint of sweet oil, 4 pennyworth of oil of almonds, 4 lb. of spermaceti, and set all over the fire till dissolved ; then add the soap and £ oz. of camphor that has first been reduced to powder by rubbing it in a mortar, with a few drops of spirits of wine, or lavender- water, or any other scent. Boil 10 minutes, then pour it into a basin, and stir it till it is quite thick enough to roll up into hard balls, which must then be done as soon as possible. If essence is used, stir it in quickly after it is taken off the fire, that the flavour may not fly off. Paste for Chapped Hands.—Mix £ 11). of unsalted hog’s lard, which has been washed in soft water, and then rose-water, with the yolks of 2 new-laid eggs, and a large spoonful of honey. Add as much fine oatmeal or almond-paste as will work into a paste. Or :—Blanch 1 lb. of bitter almonds, pound them smooth in a marble mortar; add 4 oz. of camphor, 1 oz. of honey, £ lb. of spermaceti, all pounded, and mixed with the almonds, till it becomes a smooth paste. Put it into jars or china boxes, and tie it down till wanted. For Chapped Lips.—Put £ oz. of benjamin, storax, and spermaceti, two-penny worth of alkanet-root, a large juicy apple chopped, a bunch of black grapes bruised, £ lb. of unsalted butter, and 2 oz. of bees’ wax, into a new tin saucepan. Sim- mer gently till the wax, &c., are dissolved, and then strain it through linen. When cold, melt it again, and pour it into small pots or boxes; or, if to make cakes, use the bottoms of teacups. Or :—Put 4 oz. of olive-oil into a bottle with 1 oz. of alka- net-root ; stop it up, and set it for some days in the sun, shak- ing it often until it becomes perfectly bright. Then strain the oil from the alkanet, put it into a pipkin, and add to it 1 oz. of white wax and l£ oz. of clarified mutton suet; set the mix-Chap.

Cold Cream will have nearly the same effect. Take 2 oz. of oil of sweet almonds, 1 drachm each of white wax and sper- maceti, which scrape very fine, and put them with the oil into an earthen pipkin to melt slowly on the embers, and stir it till it becomes quite smooth; after which, when becoming cold, add 1 oz. of rose-water, and put it into a gallipot closely covered; it should be a very thick cream. Thieves’ Vinegar.—“ Take a large handful of lavender- blossoms and the same quantity of sage, mint, rue, wormwood, and rosemary; chop and mix them well together; put them into a jar with 4 oz. of camphor that has been dissolved in alcohol, and pour in 3 quarts of strong vinegar; keep the jar for 2 or 3 weeks in the sun, and plunge it every night in a box of hot sand ; afterwards strain and bottle the liquid, putting into each bottle a clove of garlic sliced. It should be kept very tightly corked, and is best made in June.” a Hungary Water.—To 1 pint of highly-rectified spirits of wine put 1 oz. of oil of rosemary and 2 drachms of essence of ambergris ; shake the bottle well several times, then let the cork remain out 24 hours. After a month, during which time shake it daily, put the water into small bottles. Honey Water.—Take 1 pint of spirit as above, and 3 drachms of essence of ambergris; shake them well daily. Lavender Water.—Take 1 pint of spirit as above, essential oil of lavender 1 oz., essence of ambergris 2 drachms; put all into a quart bottle, and shake it extremely well. A very fine Scent.—Take 6 drachms of oil of lavender, 3 of the essence of bergamot, 60 drops of ambergris, and 2 grains of musk. Mix these into a pint of the best rectified spirits of wine. An excellent Water to prevent Hair from falling off\ and to thicken it.—Put 4 lbs. of unadulterated honey into a still, with 12 handfuls of the tendrils of vines, and the same quan- tity of rosemary-tops. Distil as cool and as slowly as possible. The liquor may be allowed to drop till it begins to taste sour. Bandoline for the Hair.

XXXII. between 2 pieces of paper; then put them into a tumbler of cold water to stand all night, when the water will have become glutinous and fit for use: drop into it a small quantity of spi- rits of wine, and a few drops of essence of rose, jasmine, or any other perfume. BLACK PAPER FOR DRAWING PATTERNS. 875. —Mix and smooth lamp-black and sweet oil ; with a bit of flannel cover a sheet or two of large writing-paper with this mixture; then dab the paper dry with a bit of fine linen, and keep it by for using in the following manner:—Put the black side on another sheet of paper, and fasten the corners together with small pins. Lay on the back of the black paper the pattern to be drawn, and go over it with the point of a steel pencil; the black paoer will then leave the impression of the pattern on the under sheet, on which you must draw it with ink. If you draw patterns on cloth or muslin, do it with a pen dipped in a bit of stone blue, a bit of sugar, and a little water, mixed smooth in a teacup, in which it will be always ready for use, if fresh ; wet to a due consistence as wanted. BLACK INK. 876. —Take 1 gallon of rain or soft water, and f lb. of blue galls bruised ; infuse them 3 weeks, stirring daily. Then add 4 oz. of green copperas, 4 oz. of logwood chips, 6 oz. of gum arabic, and a wineglassful of brandy. Walkden’s ink-powder is one of the best preparations for this useful article. Directions are given with it how to mix it; in addition to which 1 large cup of sweetwort to 2 papers of the powder gives it the brightness of the japan ink. If a packet of 6 papers is bought together, it costs only Is. 6d., and that quantity will last a long time. TO CEMENT BROKEN CHINA. 877. —Beat lime into the most impalpable powder, sift it through fine muslin ; then tie some into a thin muslin : put on the edges of the broken china some white of egg, then dust some lime quickly on the same, and unite them exactly. Or .—Dissolve 1 oz. of isinglass in 2 wineglassfuls of spirits of wine. It will form a transparent glue, which will unite glass so that the fracture will be almost imperceptible. The greatestChap. XXXII.] VARIOUS RECEIPTS. 639 care must be taken that the spirits of wine shall not boil over into the fire. TO TAKE STAINS OUT OF LINEN, §-c. 878.—Stains caused by Acids.—Wet the part, and lay on it some salt of wormwood ; then rub it, without diluting it with more water. Or:—Let the cloth imbibe a little water without dipping, and hold the part over a lighted match at a due distance. The spots will be removed by the sulphureous gas. Or:—Tie up in the stained part some pearlash ; then scrape some soap into cold soft water to make a lather, and boil the linen till the stain disappears. Stcihis of Wine, Fruit, fyc., after they have been long in the Linen.—Rub the part on each side with yellow soap ; then lay on a mixture of starch in cold water very thick ; rub it well in, and expose the linen to the sun and air till the stain comes out. If not removed in 3 or 4 days, rub that off and renew the pro- cess. When dry it may be sprinkled with a little water. Many other Stains may be taken out by dipping the linen in sour buttermilk, and drying it in a hot sun. Then wash it in cold water, and dry it, 2 or 3 times a-day. Ironmoulds should be wetted, then laid on a hot water- plate, and a little essential salt of lemons put on the part. If the linen becomes dry, wet it, and renew the process, observing that the plate is kept boiling hot. Much of the powder sold under the name of salt of lemons is a spurious preparation ; and therefore it is necessary to dip the linen in a good deal of water, and wash it as soon as the stain is removed, to prevent the part from being worn into holes by the acid. To take out Mildew.—Mix soft soap with starch powdered, half as much salt, and the juice of a lemon ; lay it on the part on both sides with a painter’s brush. Let it lie on the grass day and night till the stain comes out. To take Grease out of Silks or Stuffs.—Take a lump of magnesia, and rub it wet over the spot; let it dry ; then brush the powder off, and the spot will disappear. Or .-—Take a visiting or other card; separate it, and rub the spot with the soft internal part, and it will disappear with- out taking the gloss off the silk.MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXXII. G40 To take the Stains out of Black Cloth.—Boil a large hand- ful of fig-leaves in 2 quarts of water until reduced to°a pint; squeeze the leaves quite dry, and put the liquor into a bottle for use. The article should be rubbed with a sponge dipped m the liquor. The word poison should be written on the bottle to prevent any accident. To make Flannels not shrink.—The first time of washing put them into a pail of boiling water, and let them lie till cold. To preserve Furs and Woollens from Moths.—Let the former be occasionally combed while in use, and the latter be brushed and shaken. When not wanted, dry them first, let them be cool, then mix among them bitter apples from the apothecary’s in small muslin bags, sew the articles in several folds of linen, carefully turned in at the edges, and keep them from damp. Or :—Lay amongst them the cuttings of Russia leather. TO DYE THE LININGS OF FURNITURE, ETC. 879.—Tinf or Salmon Colour, according to the depth of the hue.—Rub down on a pewter plate 2 pennyworth of Spa- nish arnatto, and then boil it in a pail of water £ of an hour. Put into it 2 oz. of potash, stir it round, and instantly put in the lining; stir it about all the time it is boiling,'- which must be 5 or 6 minutes ; then put it into cold pump w , and hang the articles up singly without pinging. When almost dry, fold and mangle them. - Pink.—The calico must be watgjfed extremely clean and be dry. Then boil it in 2 gallons of soft water and 4 oz. of alum; take it out, and dry in the air. In the mean time boil in the alum-water 2 handfuls of wheat-bran till quite slippery, and then strain it. Take 2 scruples of cochineal and 2 oz. of argali finely powdered and sifted ; mix with it the liquor by little at a time. Then put the calico into the liquor, and boil it till it is almost wasted, moving it about. Take out the calico, and ■wash it in chamber-ley first, and in cold water after; then rinse it in water-starch strained, and dry it quickly without hanging it in folds. Mangle it very highly, unless you have it calendered, which is best. Blue.—Let the calico be washed clean and dried ; then mix some of Scott’s liquid blue in as much water as will beChap. XXXII.] DIRECTIONS TO SERVANTS. 641 sufficient to cover the things to be dyed, and put some starch to it to give a slight stiffness. Dry a bit, to see whether the colour is deep enough; set the linen, &c., into it, and wash it: then dry the articles singly, and mangle or calender them. The dyer will, however, do it better, and perhaps cheaper. To make Old Silk look as ivell as New.—Unpick the dress, put it into a tub and cover it with cold water; let it remain an hour; dip it up and down, but do not wring it; hang it up to drain. Iron it very damp, and it will look beautiful. Or :—Having unpicked the dress, grate 2 large potatoes into a quart of water ; let it stand to settle ; strain it without dis- turbing the sediment, and sponge the silk with it. Iron it on the wrong side. TO DYE GLOVES. 880. To look like York-Tan.—Put some saffron into 1 pint of soft water boiling hot, and let it infuse all night; next morning wet the leather over with a brush. The tops should be sewn close to prevent the colour from getting in. * To dye white Gloves a beautiful Purple.—Boil 4 oz. of log- wood and 2 oz. of roche-alum in 3 pints of soft water till half wasted. Let it stand to be cold after straining. Let the gloves be nicely mended ; then do them over with a brush, and when dry repeat it. Twice is sufficient, unless the colour is to be very dark. When dry, rub off’ the loose dye with a coarse cloth. Beat up the white of an egg, and with a sponge rub it over the leather. The dye will stain the hands, but wetting them with vinegar before they are washed will take it off. DIRECTIONS TO SERVANTS. 881. To clean Calico Furniture.—-Shake off the loose dust then lightly brush with a small long-haired furniture-brush; ' after which wipe it closely with clean flannels, and rub it with dry bread. If properly done, the curtains will look nearly as well as at first; and, if the colour be not light, they will not require washing for years. Fold in large parcels, and put^arefully by. 2 T642 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXXII. While the furniture remains up, it should be preserved from the sun and air as much as possible, which injure delicate colours; and the dust may be blown off with bellows. By the above mode curtains may be kept clean, even to use with the linings newly dipped. To clean Plate.—Boil an ounce of prepared hartshorn- powder in a quart of water; while on the fire, put into it as much plate as the vessel will hold ; let it boil a little, then take it out, drain it over the saucepan, and dry it before the fire. Put in more, and serve the same, till you have done. Then put into the water some clean linen rags till all be soaked up. When dry, they will serve to clean the plate, and are the very best things to clean the brass locks and finger- plates of doors. When the plate is quite dry, it must be rubbed bright with leather. This is a very nice mode. In many plate-powders there is a mixture of quicksilver, which is very injurious ; but the common sort—whiting wetted with gin, or, if the plate be much stained, a little nitric acid, and wiped dry with chamois-leather—will be nearly, if not quite, as effectual. To clean Looking-glasses.—Remove the fly-stains and other soil with a damp rag; then polish with woollen cloth and powder-blue, taking care to handle them gently. To preserve Gilding and clean it.—It is not possible to prevent flies from staining the gilding without covering it; before which blow off the light dust, and pass a feather or clean brush over it, but never touch it with water ; then with strips of paper, or rather gauze, cover the frames of your glasses, and do not remove till the flies are gone. Linen takes off the gilding, and deadens its brightness; it should therefore never be used for wiping it. As means to destroy the flies, which injure furniture of every kind:— Bottles hung about with sugar and vinegar, or beer, will attract them; or fly-water put into little shells placed about the room, but out of the reach of children. Or, what is much safer, is a paper now sold at the chemist’s covered with an adhesive substance, which may be laid on the glass or near it. A good preventive is to hang gauze blinds before all open windows. Or:—Boil 3 or 4 leeks in a pint of water, then with a643 Chap. XXXII.] DIRECTIONS TO SERVANTS. gilding-brush wash over your glasses and frames with the liquid, and the flies will not go near the articles so washed. This may be used without apprehension, as it will not do the least injury to the frames. To clean Paint.—Never use a cloth, but take off the dust with a little long-haired brush, after blowing off the loose parts with the bellows. With care, paint will look well for a length of time if guarded from the influence of the sun. When soiled, dip a sponge or a bit of flannel into soda and water, wash it off quickly, and dry immediately, or the strength of the soda will eat off the colour ; it is, therefore, generally better to use only strong soap and water. When wainscot requires scouring, it should be done from the top downwards, and the water be prevented from running on the unclean part as much as possible, or marks will be made which will appear after the whole is finished. One person should dry with old linen, as fast as the other has scoured off the dirt and washed the soap off. To clean Paper-hangings.—First blow off the dust with the bellows. Divide a white loaf of 8 days old into 8 parts. Take the crust into your hand, and, beginning at the top of the paper, wipe it downwards in the lightest manner with the crumb. Do not cross, nor go upwards. The dirt of the paper and the crumbs will fall together. Observe, you must not wipe above 4 a yard at a stroke, and, after doing all the upper part, go round again, beginning a little above where you left off. If you do not do it extremely lightly, you will make the dirt adhere to the paper. It will look like new if pi'operly done. To give a gloss to Oak-wainscot.—If greasy, it must be washed with warm beer ; then boil 2 quarts of strong beer, a bit of bees’-wax as large as a walnut, and a lai’ge spoonful of sugar; wet it All over with a large brush, and when dry rub it till bright. To give a fine Colour to Mahogany.—Let the tables be washed perfectly clean with vinegar, having first taken out any ink-stains there may be witli spirit of salt; but it must be used with the greatest care, and only touch the part affected, and be instantly washed off. Use the following liquid :—Into a pint of cold-drawn linseed-oil put 4 pennyworth of alkanet- root and 2 pennyworth of rose-pink in an earthen vessel; let 2 t 2644 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXXII. it remain all night; then stirring well, rub some of it all over the tables with a linen rag; when it has lain some time, rub it bright with linen cloths; nothing, however, will be found equal to “ elbow-grease.” To take Ink out of Mahogany.—Dilute i a teaspoonful of oil of vitriol with a large spoonful of water, and touch the part with a feather; watch it, for if it stays too long it will leave a white mark. It is therefore better to rub it quickly, and repeat if not quite removed. To give to Boards a beautiful appearance.—After washing them very nicely with soda and warm water and a brush, wash them with a very large sponge and clean water. Both times observe to leave no spot untouched; and clean straight up and down, not crossing from board to board; then dry with clean cloths, rubbed hard up and down in the same way. The floors should not be often-wetted, but very thoroughly when done ; and once a-week dry-rubbed with hot sand and a heavy brush the right way of the boards. The sides of stairs or passages on which are carpets or floor- cloth should be washed with sponge instead of linen or flannel, and the edges will not be soiled. Different sponges should be kept for the above two uses ; and those and the brushes should be well washed when done with, and kept in dry places. To extract Oil from Boards or Stone.—Make a strong ley of pearlashes and soft water, and add as much unslaked lime as it will take up; stir it together, and then let it settle a few minutes; bottle it, and stop close ; have ready some water to lower it as used, and scour the part with it. If the liquor should lie long on the boards, it will draw out the colour of them; therefore do it with care and expedition. To clean stone Stairs and Halls.—Boil 1 lb. of pipe-clay with a quart of water, a quart of small-beer, and put in a bit of stone-blue. Wash with this mixture, and, when dry, rub the stones with flannel and a brush. Floor-cloths should be chosen that are painted on a fine cloth, which is well covered with the colour, and the pat- terns on which do not rise much above the ground, as they wear out first, The durability of the cloth will depend much on these particulars, but more especially on the time it has been painted and the goodness of the colours. If they have not been allowed sufficient time for becoming thoroughlyChap. XXXII.] DIRECTIONS TO SERVANTS. f 646 hardened, a very little use will injure them ; and, as they arc very expensive articles, care in preserving them is necessary. It answers to keep them some time before they are used, either hung up in a dry barn where they will have air, or laid down in a spare room. When taken up for the winter, they should be rolled round a carpet-roller, and observe not to crack the paint by turning the edges in too suddenly. Old carpets answer extremely well, painted and seasoned some months before laid down. If for passages, the width must be directed when they are sent to the manufactory, as they are cut before painting. To clean Floor-cloths.—Sweep, then wipe them with a flannel; and when all dust and spots are removed, rub with a waxed flannel, and then with a dry plain one; but use little wax, and rub only enough with the latter to give a little smoothness, or it may endanger falling. Washing now and then with milk, after the above sweeping and dry-rubbing them, gives as beautiful a look, and they are less slippery. To dust Carpets and Floors.—Sprinkle tea-leaves on them, then sweep carefully. The former should not be swept frequently with a whisk- brush, as it wears them fast; only once a-week, and at other times with the leaves and a hair-brush. Fine carpets should be gently done with a hair hand-brush, such as is used for clothes, on the knees. To clean Carpets.—Take up the carpet, let it be well beaten, then laid down, and brush on both sides with a hand- brush ; turn it the right side upwards, and scour it with ox- gall and soap and water very clean, and dry it with linen cloths. Then lay it on grass, or hang it up to dry. To blacken the fronts of stone Chimney-pieces.—Mix oil-^- varnish with lamp-black, and a little spirit of turpentine to thin it to the consistence of paint. Wash the stone with soap and water very clean ; then sponge it with clear water; and when perfectly dry brush it over twice with this^colour, letting it dry between the times. It looks extremely well. The lamp-black must be sifted first. To clean the back of the Grate, the inner Hearth, and the fronts of cast-iron Stoves.—Boil about i lb. of the best black o646 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXXII. lead with a pint of small-beer and a bit of soap the size of a walnut. When that is melted, dip a painter’s brush, and wet the grate, having first brushed oft' all the soot and dust; then take a hard brush and rub it till of a beautiful brightness. Another way to clean cast-iron and black Hearths.—Mix black lead and whites of eggs well beaten together; dip a painter’s brush, and wet all over; then rub it bright with a hard brush. To preserve Irons from Bust.—Melt fresh mutton-suet, smear over the iron with it while hot; then dust it well with unslaked lime pounded and tied up in a muslin. Irons so prepared will keep many months. Use no oil for them at any time, except salad-oil, there being water in all other. I ire-irons should be kept wrapped in baize, in a dry place, when not used. Another way— Beat into 3 lbs. of unsalted hog’s-lard 2 drachms of camphor, sliced thin, till it is dissolved ; then take as much black lead as will make it of the colour of broken steel. Dip a rag into it, and rub it thick on the stove, &c., and the steel will never rust, even if wet. When it is to be used, the grease must be washed off with hot water, and the steel be dried before polishing. To take Bust out of Steel.—Cover the steel with sweet oil well rubbed on it, and in 48 hours use unslaked lime finely powdered, to rub until all the rust disappears. To take the black off' the bright Bars of polished Stoves in a few minutes.—Rub them well with some of the following mixture on a bit of broad-cloth: when the dirt is removed, wipe them clean, and polish with glass (not sand) paper. For Mixture.—Boil slowly 1 lb. of soft soap in 2 quarts of water to 1. Of this jelly take 3 or 4 spoonfuls, and mix to a consistence with emery. To clean Tin Covers.—Get the finest whiting, which is only sold in large cakes, the small being mixed with sand; mix a little of it powdered with the least drop of sweet oil, and rub well, and wipe clean ; then dust over them some dry whiting in a muslin bag, and rub bright with dry leather. The last is to prevent rust, which the cook must be careful to guard against by wiping them dry, and putting them by the fire when they come from the parlour; for if but once hung up without, the steam will rust the inside.Chap. XXXII.] DIRECTIONS TO SERVANTS. 647 Or:—2 oz. of soft soap and f lb. of rotten stone, beaten to a paste with boiling water. Fine Blacking for Shoes.—Take 4 oz. of ivory-black, 3 oz. of the coarsest sugar, a tablespoonful of sweet oil, and a pint of small beer; mix them gradually, cold. The best method of cleaning Knives.—Have the board properly prepared with leather, and clean the knives with equal quantities of rotten stone and iron filings. The machine for cleaning knives, invented by Kent, is one of the best household improvements that has been produced for a very long period. It appears rather expensive in the first instance, but the saving of time in cleaning the knives, the absence of dirt, and the certainty of always having a brilliant polished blade, are advantages that cannot pass unnoticed in any establishment. It is particularly adapted to large families. They are to be procured at most of the ironmongers’, and at Kent’s shop in the Strand. To take Stains out of Marble.—Mix unslaked lime in finest powder with the stronger soap-ley, pretty thick, and instantly with a painter’s brush lay it on the whole of the marble. In 2 months’ time wash it off perfectly clean ; then have ready a fine thick lather of soft soap, boiled in soft water; dip a brush in it, and scour the marble. This will, with very good rub- bing, give a beautiful polish. To take Iron-stains out of Marble.—An equal quantity of fresh spirit of vitriol and lemon-juice being mixed in a bottle, shake it well; wet the spots, and in a few minutes rub with soft linen till they disappear. To clean Marble.-—Mix i lb. of soft soap with the same of pounded whiting, l oz. of soda, and a piece of stone-blue the size of a walnut; boil these together for i of an hour ; whilst hot rub it over the marble with a piece of flannel, and leave it on for 24 hours ; then wash it off with clean water, and polish the marble with a piece of coarse flannel, or, what is better, a piece of an old hat. To expel Rats.—Catch one in a trap; muzzle it, with the assistance of a fellow-servant, and slightly singe some of the hair; then smear the part with turpentine, and set the animal loose; if again caught, leave it still at liberty, as the other rats will shun the place which it inhabits. It is said toh'48 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXXII, be a fact, that a toad placed in a house-cellar will have the effect of expelling rats. To destroy Bugs in a few hours.—Take i lb. of oil of turpentine, and with a brush rub the beds, walls, or any places infested with them ; if they are in great numbers, brush the places over several times, which will not only destroy the bugs, but also their eggs. Although the smell of turpentine is strong, yet it is not unhealthy, and goes off' in a short time. To test Mushrooms.—Rub the upper skin with a gold ring or any piece of gold : the part rubbed will turn yellow if it is a poisonous fungus.649 Chap. XXXIII.] DINNER COURSES. CHAPTER XXXIII.

For this reason, chickens, vol-au-vents, or such like, should be served for “ flancs.” When the dinner admits only of 4 entrees, 2 should be light and 2 solid ; the latter may be made to look light by being carried to a height corresponding to their breadth. Second Course.—Venison, Hare, Birds, and Game of all sorts . . Shell Fish, cold and potted . . Collared and potted Fish . . Potted Birds, and all sorts of side-dishes, as entre- mets . . Ribs and Fore-quarter of Lamb roasted . . Brawn Vegetables, stewed and in season . . French Beans . . Peas Asparagus. . Cauliflower . Spinach, and Artichoke bottoms . .650 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXXIII. Stewed Celery . . Sea-Kale . . Fruit Tarts and Preserves of various sorts with the list of sweet dishes, of which abundance are given in the foregoing receipts; such as Creams, Jellies, and all the finer sorts of Puddings, Mince Pies . . Macaroni, Omelette, &c. Any of the following things may be served as a relish, with the cheese, after dinner:—Baked or pickled Fish, done high . . Dutch pickled Herring . . Sardines, which eat like An- chovy, but are larger . . Anchovies . . Potted Char . . Potted Lampreys . . Potted Birds seasoned highly. . Caviare and Sip- pets of Toast . . Salad . . Radishes . . Cold Butter . . Potted Cheese . . Anchovy Toast, and Dutch Herring pickled; but these are not usual at elegant tables, though at friendly and family dinners some of them may be introduced. In some houses, if soup be served, it is customary, in small family parties, to send it up alone. In others, a course of Soups and Fish: then Meats and Boiled Fowls, Turkey, &c.: Made Dishes and Game follow ; and lastly, Sweet Dishes : but these removes are only employed at large dinners. Vege- tables, if plainly dressed, are put on the side-table at large dinners, as likewise sauces, and servants bring them round; but some inconveniences attend this plan, and, when there are not many to wait, delay is occasioned. If the table is of a due size, the articles alluded to will not fill it too much. It is worthy of observation here, that cooks do not always think of sending up such articles as are in the house unless ordered ; though by so doing, the addition of anything col- lared or pickled, some fritters, fried patties, or quickly-made dumplings, would be useful when there happen to be acci- dental visitors: and at all times it is right to better the ap- pearance of the table rather than let things spoil below, by which the expense of a family is more increased than can be easily imagined. Hot suppers are not much in use where people dine very late; and when required, nothing boiled should ever be introduced. If fish be served, only the smaller sorts, fried, should be brought to table ; with the sole exception of shell-fish, which may be dressed hot in any way. When required, the top and bottom, or either, may be Game . . Fowls . . Rabbit. . Oysters stewed or scalloped . . French Beans . . Cauliflower, or Jeru-Chap.

A sand- wich tray with any of the above articles looks well, or placed at a little distance from each other on the table, without the tray, if preferred. The lighter the things, the better they appear, and glass in- termixed has the best effect. Jellies, different coloured things, and flowers, add to the beauty of the table. An elegant supper may be served at a small expense by those who know how to make trifles that are in the house form the greatest part of the meal. ARTICLES IN SEASON IN DIFFERENT MONTHS.

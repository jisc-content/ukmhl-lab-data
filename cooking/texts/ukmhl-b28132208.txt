The present work is designed entirely with a view to practical utility, for the use of young Housewives who study simplicity and economy in the preparation of food, and who require explicit directions for their guidance. Care has been taken to exclude costly dishes, and the use of expensive materials, or those which cannot easily be procured. The book is a Manual of plain directions to he used in the kitchens of the middle or less affluent classes; the endeavour being to show how tasteful and nutritious dishes may b(> prepared at little expense, in order to render home happy and attractive.

C O 0 K E K y. )OKERY is an art upon which so much of our daily comfort and heirlth depends, that it is of the higliest importance that it he well done. Every housewife may not be able to procure the finest kinds of food, but every one has it in her power to make the most of that which she can procure. By a certain degree of skill and attention, very humble fare may be dressed in such a manner that it will almost rival the more expensive dishes, both in savouriness and nutritiousness. A good housewife suffers nothing to be lost or spoiled. Mere scraps, Avhich a careless individual would perhaps throw away, are put to a proper use, and by means of certain auxiliary seasoning, brought to table in a now and attractive guise. Even if little or nothing be absolutely saved by these economical arrangements, the dressing of food in a tasteful manner is a point of some importance. When a dish has a slovenly appearance, is smoked, underdone, or prepared with rancid or unclean seasoning, both the eye and the palate are offended, independently of the injury which may possibly bo done to the stomach of the eater. In every respect, therefore, it is consistent with good judgment to prepare food for the table in the most tasteful and agreeable manner.6 COOKERY. One of the chief points to be attended to in cookery is cleanliness—scrupulous cleanliness in every department of the business of the kitchen. The hands of the cook, in particular, should be always clean—that is, washed every time afbT doing any kind of work which has soiled them, or before proceeding to handle meat for dressing. She should also be careful to have her hair always neatly trimmed up, so that no loose hairs may drop into the dishes. The next point is to keep all tlie saucepans and lids and other utensils jierfectly clean inside and out; carefully washing with hot water, and scouring when necessary. If the cooking utensils are not kept thoroughly clean, they will be very apt to taint the food prepared in them, and wiU certainly detract from the agreeable taste of the dishes. It is the duty of every house- wife to see that these and all other rules affecting the clean- liness of the kitchen are attended to by servants, for she is understood to be responsible both for the wholcsomoness and the tidy appearance of the dishes presented at table. Another essential point in cookery is attention. Many persons think they have done all that is necessary, when they have fairly started any particular process in cooking. They seem to imagine that they may safely leave a roast to roast by itself, or leave a pot with soup or broth to boil by itself, and that they have only to go back to the fire at a certain time, when they will find the food ready for dishing. Now, this kind of inattention is certain to spoil the best meat ever put to a fire. Some processes require much less attention than others, but none can be properly perfonneil if left long to itself. A good cook is pretty freipient in her visits to the fire, to see how the operation of dressing is going on, and to seize the proper moment in giving her assistance. Perfection in the art of cookery is only attainable by lengthened experience, a careful study of the (lualities of meats, and the application of sauces and seasonings. It is chiefly in knowing how to make and apply saiux-s that a cook shows her skill. We therefore recommend this branch of the art to very careful attention. The directions which are given under the head Sauce.s will convey sufficient infonnation on the subject, and, along with a little practice and good taste, ■will enable the cook to impart the proper flavour to the dish she is preparing.t MARKETING AND CHOICE OE MEAT. MARKETING AND CHOICE OF MEAT. A young and thriftily-disposed housewife will, if possible, proceed to market lierself, in order to lay in hutcher-meat and other fresh provisions for her family. By this plan she will obtain two advantages—that of selecting the best pieces, and of getting them at the lowest price. If circumstances permit, it is advisable to jiurchase a whole week’s provisions at one time—at least the chief things which will be required during the ensuing eight days. We should recommend a house- wife to act upon a system in varying the kinds of meat which she buys, not only as they may be suitable to the seasons, but as calculated to promote the health of her family. It is of considerable consequence that food should be varied; .sameness of diet will produce the most injurious effects, whatever be the quality of the food which is taken. Let the housewife, therefore, exercise a little ingenuity and judgment in her marketing expeditions, that she may present at table a succession of different descriptions of animal and vegetable food; as, for example, sometimes meat roasted, and sometimes boiled or stewed; sometimes fresh meat, and sometimes salted; sometimes butcher-meat, and sometimes fish; and so on, according to taste and other circumstances. It does not necessarily follow that, in thus varying the bill of fare, greater expense is incurred than if the same kind of articles were continually purchased. The best meat is moderately fat. If it be lean, or almost free from fat, it is an indication that the animal has been ill fed, and the meat Avill prove tough and tasteles.s. Avoid lean beef—it forms wretched fare, and will be dear at any price. The fat of good beef is slightly yellowish; the fat of good mutton is pure white. The flesh of both beef and mutton should be of a clear red colour. The mutton of blackfaced sheep, or South-downs, is the most tender and sweet, and may bo known by the shortness of the shank. Mutton is in per- fection at between four and five years, but is seldom to be had ^ older than three years. Cow and bull beef are considerably inferior to ox beef. In choosing lamb, select that which has a delicate appear-MARKETING AND CHOICE OF MEAT. 8 ance and is perfectly fresh. Young veal has a dark and ilabby look, and is tasteless when dressed. Veal is best wdien the animal is between four and six months old. The flesh is then white and delicate, and firm in the fibre. ]^rk should be white and delicate like veal, and thin in the skin. Lamb, veal, pork, and all other young or white meal, should be fresh, and not bought long before being used. Fowls, ducks, and other birds should be purchased young, and should all be firm and fleshy to the touch. The safest rule in choosing young feathered animals is to feel the breastbone, which should be soft and jiliable like gristle. The age of game is of little consequence, as it is hung for a considerable length of time before dressing. All kinds of fish, except cod and turbot, should be pur- chased as fresh as possible. Freshness in all fish is indicated by stiffness in all parts of the body, a clear glittering apiiear- ance in the scale.s, and by tlie smell. The fish will have an offensive odour if it be in the least stale. Freshness of appearance in the eyes and gills is not to bo trusted. It is very difficult to ascertain when eggs are perfectly fresh. There are different rules on the subject, but they are all liable to failure. One mode of judging is to hold the egg between the eye and the light of a candle, shading the eye with the hand; if the appearance is uniformly luminous, the egg is fresh; if not, it is probably unfit for use. Butter may be easily selected by the taste and the smell; but in l)uying both eggs and butter, it is better, and will Siive much trouble, to deal only witli a thoroughly reliable person. Good ham and hacon have a fresh savoury smell; the fat is white. If it be yellow, it will soon become rank and rusty. Flour for culinary purposes should be new and fresh. Old flour is liable to spoil and become full of animal life, in which condition it is unfit for use. The best kind of salt for the kitchen is that which is purchased in lumps, and cut down. This kind is less rank than the coaree scaly salt, and in England is not higher9 CUTTING UP MEAT. CUTTING UP MEAT. Butcher-meat is not cut up in the same manner in all parts of the country. There are two chief plans followed—the English and the Scotch—and consequently the pieces of meat iii a carcass differ in number, size, and name in England and Scotland. This circumstance creates a certain degree of difficulty in giving directions for cooking; and to obviate this as much as possible, we subjoin the following drawings and explanations. These will assist a housewife in sending to market for what pieces of meat she requires. Fig. 1 represents a bullock marked for cutting up on the English plan. No. 1 is the loin or sirloin; 2, the rump; 3, the aitch or edge bone; 4, buttock; 5, hock; 6, thick flank; 7, thin flank; 8, fore-rib; 9, middle-rib; 10, chuck- rib; 11, brisket; 12, leg of mutton piece; 13, clod, sticking, and neck pieces; 14, shin; and 15, the leg. From 1 to 7 is the hind-quarter, and from 8 to 15 is the fore-quarter. Nos. 1 and 2 on both sides, united, constitute what is called a barcM of betf. big. 2 represents a bullock marked for cutting up on the Scotch plan. No. 1 is the sirloin or back sye; 2, the hook bone; 3, buttock; 4, largo round (3 and 4 together make the rump); 5, sm.all round; 6, hough; 7, thick flank; 8, thin flank; 9, nineholes; 10 and 11, largo and small runner; 12, spare or fore sye; 13, brisket; 14, shoulder Iyer; 15, nap or shin; 16, neck; and 17, the sticking piece.CUTTINQ UP MEAT. 10 From 1 to 8 is the hind-quarter, and from 9 to 17 is the fore-quarter. According to the English plan, the meat is cut up more advantageously for roasting and broiling than by the Scotch plan. For instance, the rump and aitch bone, No& 2 and 3 (fig. 1), are cut in such a manner that the meat atfonls a much better steak than when cut as in fig. 2. The Scotch plan, on the other hand, gives more pieces for boiling; and thus each way seems suitable to the taste of the people who have resix'ctively adopted them. Fig. 3 represents the Siglish plan of cutting up mutton.11 CUTTING OP MEAT—KILLING FOWLS. No. 1, extending across and marked as a circle, is the shoulder; 2, is the sci-ag end of the neck ; 3, breast; 4, loin; 5, leg; 6, best end of neck. The slanting line betwixt 4 and 5 is the division of the fore and hind quarter. The dotted line across the shoulder, shows where the neck is sepamted from the breast after the shoulder is oif. Two loins united, form a saddle of mutton. Fig. 4 represents a side of mutton marked for cutting on the Scotch plan. No. 1 is the gigot, 2 the loin, and both together form the hind-quarter; 3 is the back-ribs, and 4 the breast, both forming the fore-quarter. Lamb is cut up in the same manner, when not sold in quarters. Veal is usually cut up both in England and Scotland in a manner somewhat uniting the plans for cutting beef and mutton. A fillet, which is supposed to be the most elegant joint, is cut from the upper part of the hind-leg, being partly of the buttock and partly of the flank. The piece at the extremity of the loin is called the chump. KILLING FOWLS, &c. Fowls, rabbits, and some other animals, being sometimes purchased alive, and the beauty of their appearance when they are dressed depending in some measure on their being killed in a proper manner, it is necessary that a cook shouhl learn how to kill them expeditiously and neatly. A turkey is killed by passing a small penknife into the mouth, and cutting it below the tongue, then passing the knife up through the head into the brain. After this, hang it up by the feet to let it bleed freely. All smaller fowls are killed by pulling and dislocating the neck at the head. In killing geese and ducks, commence by tying a string round the beak; then fix the wings by turning the pinions on the back to prevent fluttering. After this, make an incision or cut across the upper part of the neck, close to the head, and suspend by the feet, to bleed freely. A rabbit is killed by holding it by the hind-legs, letting the head hang downwards, and then giving it a smart blow with the edge of the hand behind tlie ears. All birds should bo ko[)t for a short time with their feathers on after being killed, and not drawn till they are to bo used. Furred12 THE LARDER—KEEPING MEAT. nnimals should not be skinned till they are to be used, but should bo paunched as soon as they are cold. THE LARDER—KEEPING MEAT. A larder should be cool and dry, with the outer air playing freely through it, and be placed in the shade. It should also be impervious to vermin or insects, particidarly flies. Two or three shelves, a few strong iron hooka for hanging the meat, and some wire-covei-s for cold meat, are the only furniture required. lleef and mutton are always improved by hanging some time after being killed before they are cooked. The length of time which they may be kept, depends on the state of the weather. When the atmosphere is cool, clear, and dry, beef and mutton should hang from four to ten days—mutton, if well managed, may hang a fortnight, or even three weeks. A moist thick atmosphere is the worst for keeping moat; under these circumstances great care must be taken with the contents of the larder. The meat should be Aviped daily with a cloth, to'free it as much as possible from the moisture that gathers upon it when kept for many days. In all cases, fresh meat should hang from a hook, and not be laid on a plate. Should meat contract mustiness by keeping, it may sometimes be restored by washing in vinegar or camomile tea. When in danger of becoming tainted, it may be preserved by being partially boiled or roasted. Frozen meat should be thawed very gradually by being placed in the kitchen for some hours before it is cooked. In most instances, fresh meivt is cooked too soon after being killed, a circumstance perhaps arising from the general want of proper larders, and the dread of the meat being spoiled. The consequence is, that, instead of being tender and palatable, the meat is tough and disagreeable, and not so nutritious or so easily digesteil as it ought to be. While beef and mutton may', with great projiriety', be kept some days to become tender, veal, lamb, and pork (being young or white meat), cannot be kept more than a day, or two days at the utmost. tJamc may be kejit for two or three weeks, that which is feathered being kept with the feathers on, and hares being paunched. .'ill kinds of tish, except13 THE LARDER—KEEPING MEAT. cod and turbot, are best when cooked as soon after being caught as possible. A fowl will keep a week, and a turkey a fortnight. A goose will not keep above nine or ten days. Great care should bo taken in picking feathered animals which have been kept, for their skin will in such a case be easily tom. Keepinri cold Meat.—When newly-cooked meat is brought from table, and has to be set aside for after-use, put it on a clean dry dish, place it in the larder, and cover it with a wire cover; if any liquor or gravy be left about it, the meat is apt to become sour. Cold meat is always best Avhen it has not been cut while warm, as in that case the juices have not run out, but remain to enrich the meat. Vegetables.—Vegetables of all kinds should be used as soon after being gathered as possible. They begin to ferment, and to lose both their flavour and wholesomeness, very shortly after being taken from the ground. When they have necessarily to be kept for a day or two, place them in a perfectly dry, dark, and cool situation, but not exposed to currents of wind. Keep also each kind of vegetable separate from another, to prevent contamination of flavour. They should never bo washed or placed in water till immediately before being used. The vegetables in most common use are potatoes, cabbages or greens, turnips of a small size, carrots, and onions—which are to be procured nearly all the year round; also cauliflower, broccoli, green peas, leeks, rhubarb, French beans, parsnips, horse-radish, seakale, celery, lettuce or salads, spinach, aspara- gus, and parsley—which are to be had only in particular seasons. Turnips and carrots may be kept for several weeks after being pulled, by putting them in a box filled with dry sand. There is a class of vegetables called sweet herbs, which are used for seasoning certain dishes or preparations. The most common, and the best, are mint, thyme, knotted marjoram, winter savory, and sage. If these be purchased fresh and green, they may bo dried for future use, by being hung up in bunches in a dry situation.14 COOKING AND KITCHEN APPARATUS. COOKING AND KITCHEN APPARATUS. Kitchen Range.—The most important part of the cooking apijaratus is tlie range or grate. In general, too little care is bestowed by young persons, when setting up housekeeping, on the choice of this article. The size of the range should be in proportion to the size of the kitchen and of the household. The close range has almost entirely superseded the old- fashioned open one, and the kind in most general use has the fireplace in the centre, with an oven at either side, a high-pressure boiler being fitted at the back. Sauce and Stew-pans.—The choice of these vessels will depend on the requirements and judgment of the purchaser. Those generally used for ordinary cooking are made of iron, well tinned inside, and may be had of all sizes. It is con- venient to have one or two of the very smallest dimensions, made of block-tin, and also a few enamelled pans for delicate stews, &c. It is well also to have a few shallow saucepans, to be used for stews, or where only a small quantity of liquid is required. The following is a list of utensils necessary in furnishing an ordinary middle-class kitchen : 1 clock. 1 kitchen table. 3 kitchen chaii-s. 4 iron stew-i)ans (assorted). 4 iron saucepans (assorted). 4 cnanielled iron saucepans (assorted). 1 fish-kettle with drainer. 1 preserving pan. 1 gridiron. 1 frying-pan. 1 oinelet-p.an. 1 steamer. 1 large pot for stock. 2 kettles (one large, one small). 3 pot-rests. 1 l)aking-tin and stand for meat. 1 Yorkshire imdding-tin. 3 flat baking-tins. 3 cake-tins (assorted). 12 patty-pans. 2 jelly-moulds.

Most dishes of meat have a bare appearance at table, unless tliey are decorated or garnished. Li the following directions for cooking, the garnish used for different dish(^ is pointed out. When cold meat is brought to table, it is generally decorated with a few sprigs of fresh parsley. ROASTING MEAT. The best joints are selected for roasting, which should be done before the fire. Half an hour before the joint is to be put down, the dust should be raked from the grate, and the fire made up. The joint, which must be handled as little as possible, should be carefully wiped with a dry cloth, and weighed : a quarter of an hour being allowed for each pound, and a quarter of an hour over for brown meats; or twenty minutes for each pound, and twenty minutes over for white meats. The joint should be placed as close as po^ible to the fire for the first six or eight minutes, after which it should be well basted, and withdrawn about sixteen or eighteen uiches from the fire. It should be basted frequently the whole time it is cooking, and a clear, bright fire must be. kept up. Another method of roasting, and one which is very useful for a small joint or a bird, is done in an non ^ucepan large enough to admit of a small space around the joint. Put mto the pan enough butter or dripping to cover the it is melted, put in the joint and cover with a close-fitting h I, turn and baste the joint from time to time over a slow fire. Allow the same time as for roasting before the tire.17 ROASTED BEEP—MUTTON—VENISON. TO ROAST BEEF. 10 lb. of beef. I 1 gill of hot water. Pepper and salt. I 1 stick of horse-radish. The best piece of beef for roasting is the sirloin. Roast according to the general directions given above, basting the joint with its own dripping. In dishing, lift the meat on to a hot dish, and pour away the fat, leaving the sediment; add the hot water, salt, and pepper. Place the tin containing these on the fire, stir until boiling, and the gravy is ready to pour round the meat. A well-roasted joint ought to have a nice rich brown tinge all over, and this is to be obtained only by careful basting, attention to the fire, and removing at the proper time. Garnish with scraped horse-radish. TO ROAST MUTTON. 1 leg of mutton. i 1 gill of hot water. Pepper. I Salt. The best pieces of mutton for roasting are the leg (called in Scotland the gigot), the shoulder, and the loin. Mutton for roasting may be kept longer than for boiling. Roast accortling to general directions, and baste with dripping. Gravy for roast mutton may bo made the same as for beef. Most persons prefer mutton ‘well done.’ In roasting the loin, take away the fat surrounding the kidney, otherwise the joint, on being brought to table, will, when cut up, be floated with oil. The back-ribs and loin of mutton ought to be well jointed or cut before bemg put to the fire. TO ROAST VENISON. 4 lb. venison. 3 oz. good fat or dripping. Bed currant Jelly. 1 table-spoonful port wine. J pint milk or cream. 1 gill of stock. Pepper and salt. Venison is sometimes roasted in the same manner as mutton, but requires longer time at the fire. It is such a dry meat, that it requires great care in cooking. Baste it18 ROASTED VEAL—LAMB. first with milk or cream, and when this is all absorbed or dried up, add the dripping, and baste still very frequently. When cooked, lift the venison on to a hot dish; pour away the fat, leaving the sediment in the pan. Add to this the stock, pepper and salt, one teaspoonful of currant jelly, and the port wine. Stir all over the fire until boiling, then strain the sauce over the venison. Serve very hot with currant jelly. TO ROAST VEAL. 4 lb. of veal i pint melted butter. J lb. bread crumbs. 2 oz. chopped suet. 1 egg. STUFFING. 1 table-spoonful chopped parsley. Rind of i a lemon chopped. Pepper and salt The best parts of veal for roasting are the fillet, the breast, the loin, and the shoulder. The fillet and the breast should be stuffed; the stuffing to be composed of the above ingredients. Veal will require a longer time to dress than beef or mutton. The fillet of veal, which is the thick fleshy part of the hind- leg, should have the knuckle or bone cut out neatly, without disfiguring the joint; stuff the flap with the above; roll it up finuly, and bind it with tape or string. Allow the stuffing in this, as in all other cases, room to exjxind in dressmg. Cover the ends with buttered paper, and baste the veal frequently with butter. Take off the paper a short time before the meat is done. Lift the veal on to a hot dish, pour off the dripping, season, and add the sediment to the melted butter. Pour round the veal, and garnish with sliced lemon. TO ROAST LAMB. 1 quarter of lamb. I 1 gill of hot water. Pepper and salt. I 1 gill of mint-sauce. Lamb requires to bo well roasted. It is usually dressed in quarters ; all parts, particularly the spinal bone, should be well jointed or cut by the butcher or cook; and the ribs of the fore-quarter broken across the centre for the convenience of the carver. In roasting, baste with its own dripping.19 ROASTED rOBK—SUCKING-PIG. The gravy for lamb may be made in the same manner as for beef or mutton. Serve with mint-sauce in a sauce tureen. TO ROAST PORK. 4 lb. loin of pork. 1 gill of water, i pint of apple sauce. A little salad oil. 4 chopped onions. 1 table-spoonful sage. Pepper and salt. When stuffing is to be used, it must be composed of chopped sage and onion in the above proportions, witli pepper and salt. The outer skin should be neatly and well scored in regular stripes, to enable the carver to cut slices easily. Before putting the joint to the fire, rub the skin with salad oil, to prevent it blistering, and baste very frequently. When there is not enough dripping, the basting may be done by rubbing it with a piece of butter in a muslin bag. The gravy for pork may be the same us for other joints. Apple sauce helps to overcome the richness or lusciousness of the meat, and imparts a slightly acidulous flavour. It should be served in a sauce tureen. TO ROAST SUCKING-PIG. 1 sucking-pig. i pint beef gravy, i pint apple sauce, j lb. bread crumbs. 3 oz. butter. 1 table-spoonful chopped sage. Pepper and salt. The animal being properly ])repared and cleaned by the butcher, proceed to cut off the feet, and fill the inside with a stuffing composed of sage, crumbs, and butter in the above proportions, pepper, and salt; sew up the slit. No skewering is required. In roasting, baste with butter, as directed for pork. The time for roasting will be from two to three hours, according to the size. The skin should be crisp and nicely browned. Before bringing to table, sjdit down the back from head to tail, and lay it flat in the dish with the skin side uppermost. Cut the head off, split it in two, take out the brains, and lay half the head at each end. Have the liver boiled, chop it and the brains, and mix these with the gravy in a small tumen. Apple sauce should also be served in a separate tureen.20 ROASTED bullock’s HEART—PIGEONS—FOWLS. TO ROAST BULLOCK’S HEART. 1 bullock’s heart. i j pint stock 2 oz. dripping. | Red currant jeUy. STUFFING. 4 table-spoonfuls bread crumbs. 1 table-spoonftil chopped parsley. Pepper and salt 2 table-spoonfuls chopped suet. 1 egg. A little milk. Wash the heart well, freeing it completely from blood. Then fill all the openings at tlie top or broad end with a stuffing composed of the above ingredients. Susiiend with the pointed end downwards. Baste well with dri[)ping, and roast for an hour and a half or two hours, according to size. Serve with gravy made the same as for roast venison, and currant jelly. TO ROAST PIGEONS. 2 pigeons. 4 oz. butter. 4 table-spoonfuls bread crumbs. Pepper and salt 1 table-spoonful chopped parsley. J pint brown gravy. Pick, draw, and truss the pigeons, keeping on the feet. Make a stuffing of the livers chopped, crumbs, parsley, jiepper, salt, and two ounces of butter; put this inside. Make a slit in one of the legs, and slip the other leg through it. Skewer and roast them for half an hour, basting them well with butter. Serve with brown gravy in a small tureen. Some serve roast pigeons as game, with toasted bread under them, and bread-sauce. TO ROAST FOWLS. 1 pair fowls. i } pint bread sauce, i lb. butter. | j pint gravy. First pick and singe the birds, then draw them. To draw a fowl, place it on its back, and make a slit lengthways in the skin of the neck from the body to the head; free the neck from the skin, and cut oft' the neck as close to the body as possible, then cut the skin, leaving a flap of at least three inches long hanging to the breast. Loosen the crop—a thin bag of skin in front of the neck—and the wind-21 ROASTED FOWLS. pipe, and insert the first finder, keeping it close to the inside surface of the body; w'ork it round, breaking all the liga- ments with which it conies in contact, thus loosening the contents of the carcass. Great care should be taken not to thrust the finger into the centre, for if the gall-bag should bo broken, the liver, to which it is attached, will be unfit for use, and a bitter taste Avill be imparted to any part of the flesh which the gall may touch. Turn the bird, slightly enlarge the opening at the other end, insert the finger, and loosen the inside from the carcass at that end. Turn the bird again, and place it on its back ; press on the breast with the thumbs, and push out the gizzard by the hole at the other end. Take hold of it, and pull steadily, when the Avhole of the interior should be brought away entire. Look to see that this has been done, and then Avipe the inside of the bird AA'ith a damp cloth. After having draAvn the bird, proceed to truss it. Press doAvn the breast-bone; break the legs in the middle of the first joint, and cut them off by the break. Carefully Avash the liver, and dry it; open the gizzard, and take out the inside; place them in either Aving. Then fold the loose piece of skin from the neck on to the back, and turn the pinion ends of the Avings round under the back, Avhich Avill keep the skin in its ]>lace. Then push the legs back close to the sides of the foAvl; jjass a long needle threaded Avith twine through the point of the Aving and the upper part of the leg, then through the body, catching the leg and Aving in the same Avay at the other side; tie the twine under the back; finally, tie the legs firmly together at the knees close to the tail. FoavIs for roasting are not generally stuffed, but Avhere this is done, bread crumbs mixed Avith butter, pepper, and salt, or else veal stuffing (page 18) should be used ; insert the stuffing in the hollow place in front of the breast from Avhich the crop, &c.

This, which should be done in all cases, is too frequently neglected, and shows slovenliness in cookery. Fowls and all other birds should be served with the breast upwards.

Before putting the turkey to the fire, cover the breast with a sheet of Avriting-paper Avell buttered, to prevent it from scorching. Remove the paper a short time before taking it from the fire, to alloAv the breast to broAvn. Baste well Avith butter. A turkey will take from an hour and a half to tAvo hours.

Serve on toasted bread, which may be dipped in gravy, and serve separately, gravy, browned crumbs, and broad sauce. Grouse and blackcock should be dressed and served in the same manner; the head being trussed under the wing, and three-quarters of an hour allowed for cooking. Snipes and w'oodcocks are not drawn. TO ROAST 1 goose. i pint apple sauce, i pint gravy. Pepper and salt. A GOOSE. J lb. bread crumbs or boiled potatoes. 1 table-spoonful chopped sage. 4 onions chopped. Pick, draw, and singe the goose. Cut off the head and neck. Take off the feet and legs at the first joint; also the wings at the first joint. Skew'er the portions of the legs and wdngs that are left to the sides. Mix the potatoes (or bread crumbs), sage, and onions, and season; put this stuffing into the breast, and fasten the skin of the neck securely. Put a greased paper over the breast for a short time. A goose does not require so much basting as a fowl or turkey, for it is natumlly greasy. It will require from tw’o hours to two hours and a half in roasting. It ought to bo thoroughly cooked. Serve with gravy and apple sauce in separate tureens. The liver, gizzard, head, neck, feet, and pinions of the goose form what is termed the giblets, and will make a good stew or pie.

Half the liver boiled and grated. 1 table-spoonful ketchup. 4 oz. chopped suet. 2 table-spoonfuls parsley. 1 a lemon rind grated. A little nutmeg. 2 eggs. Pepper and salt. A hare will keep with the skin on it, and paunched, for about three weeks in cold weather. It is then fit for roast- ing. First cut off the feet, and begin drawing off the skin at the hind-legs, proceeding along the body to the head. Be careful not to tear the ears in skinning them. Soak and wash the hare well in several waters, and then wipe quite dry. Stuff the body, and sew the skin of the belly over it. Place the hind and fore legs flat against the sides, and fasten Fig. 7. with skewers. To make the hind-legs lie flat, the under sinews must be cut.

The hare should be dished back upwards, as represented in fig. 7, and served with rich beef gravy and currant jelly. IIAKING MEAT. !Meat is prepared for baking in the same manner as for roasting. It should be placed in a deep dish and raised on a stand, to prevent the grease from soaking into it. Few joints are so good when baked as they are when roasted. The time allowed for baking meat should be the same as for roasting, and constant and careful basting is absolutely neces- sary. The sauce may be prepared in the same way as for roasting. BROILING. Broiling is the rapid cooking of any kind of animal food, either before or over the fire. The apparatus required in broiling is very simple, and consists only of a gridiron, which should have small bars, and be kept thoroughly clean, not only on the tops, but on the sides of the bars. Let it be heated on the fire for a few minutes before placing the meat upon it. If the bars, when warm, be rubbed with a piece of brown paper, and fat or suet, it will ]irevent the meat from sticking to them. The operation of broiling requires a clear strong fire, with no smoke. In almost all cases the meat ought to be frequently turned, which may be best done by means of a pair of small tongs; a fork should on no account be used, for it breaks the meat, and allows the gravy to run out. Broiling is applicable only to meat which is to be eaten immediately on being dressed. This is an advantage when expeditious cooking is required, but a disadvantage when there is any uncertainty as to tlie time at which the meat is to be eaten. Some cooks beat meat before broiling, as well as before frying, for the purpose of making it tender; this is of noBROILED BEEFSTEAK—MUTTON CHOPS. 26 use when the meat has been sufficiently hung, and may do more harm than good, by expelling the juices. TO BROIL BEEFSTEAK. 1 lb. beefsteak. I 2 oz. fresh butter. Pepper. I Salt. A beefsteak is the most suitable of all kinds of meat for broiling, and is universally relished. There are several parts of beef used for steaks, but in every case it should not be too newly killed. The best .steak is that cut from the rump (called in Scotland the lieuk-bone), because it is the most juicy and well flavoured. Steaks should be cut in slices of from three-quarters of an inch to an inch in thickness, and then into pieces of a convenient size for turning. Some persons dust the steaks with pepper before putting them to the fire, by which means the flavour of the pepper is infused through the mass. When placed on the gruliron, turn them very frequently. It is impossible to state any exact length of time to be employed in cooking a steak, for much depends on the tenderness and thickness of the meat, and on the strength of the fire. The taste of the individual who is to eat the steak must also regulate the length of time; some prefer steaks in a half-raw state, others like them well done. When they arc cooked, place the steaks on a hot dish, with a little good fresh butter and fine salt on each. Beefsteaks should be carried to table immediately on being dressed, and eaten forthwith, in order to be in perfection. If they stand, they lose a portion of their flavour and juice. When sauce is lequired, either mushroom or oyster sauce may be used. TO BROIL MUTTON CHOPS. 2 mutton chops. | Salt. Mutton chops should be cut from the middle of the loin, and about the same thickness as steaks. They are broiled in the same manner as steaks, and require equal attention. No butter is to be used in dishing, as the ehops are suffi- ciently fat in themselves. Sprinkle a little salt over them, and carry to the table immediately. Mushroom sauce may be used.27 BROILED FOWLS AND PIGEONS—FRYING. TO BROIL FOWLS AND PIGEONS, 1 fowl or pigeon. i Salt. 1 oz. butter. I Pepper. Clean and prepare the fowl or pigeon as for roasting; then split it down the back, laying it quite flat. Dust with pepper. Fowls and pigeons should be broiled more slowly than steaks or chops, being thicker, and requiring to be more thoroughly cooked. Rub occasionally with a little butter, to prevent the skin from cracking. In no case should the skin be taken off before broiling. On dishing, sprinkle with salt. FRYING. There are two distinct methods of frying—\vet-frying and dry-frpng. The former, which may be described as boiling in fat, should be employed for anything which can be cooked in three or four minutes, such as rissoles, filleted fish, fritters, &c., but, if a longer time is required, as for cutlets, &c., dry- frying must be resorted to. For wet-frying, place an iron saucepan three parts filled with clarified dripping (see page 69) over the fire, and allow it to melt and heat till a blue steam rises from it, and it is quite still, when it will be ready for use. Or, to test the fat, throw in a small piece of bread, and if a bubbling at once begins it is ready. Whatever is to be cooked, must be previously prepared by being tos.sed in flour, or covered in flour and water batter, or else first dipped in beaten egg, and then tossed in broad crumbs. When the fat is ready, drop into it a few of the prepared pieces (which should not bo too large), when the outer coat will be at once sealed so that no grease can pass through; fry for three or four minutes to a nice golden colour. Lift the pieces with a perforated iron spoon on to porous paper; sprinkle with salt if they are savoury, or sifted sugar if they are sweet, and dry for a few minutes in the oven. Keep hot until the rest of the dish is cooked. If the fat is not sufficiently heated the outer covering will not become sealed, but will be saturated with grease, and the appearance and flavour of the dish will be entirely spoiled. After the fat has been used it should be allowed to cool for28 FRIED BEEFSTEAKS—MUTTON CHOPS—VEAL CUTLETS. a few minutes, and then be strained into a strong bowl, and set aside for future use. Dry-frying is done in a frying-pan. Place the pan over a clear fire with sufficient butter, lard, dripping, or oil in it to cover the bottom; when it is melted and quite hot, put in whatever is to be cooked, and fry first on one side for about five minutes to a pale brown; then turn it, and fry for about three minutes on the other side. 'Ihen drain as above described in wet-frying. The fat which has been used for dry-frying is seldom fit for use a second time. TO FRY BEEFSTEAKS. 1 lb. beefsteak. | 1 table-spoonful ketchup. 1 oz. butter or dripping. 2 table-spoonfuls water. Pepper. ' Salt. Cut the steaks as for broiling, and, after they are put into the pan, with the hot butter or dripping, turn them fre- quently. Let them be browned all over, and placed in a hot dish when finished. Pour away the fat, and add the water with a little pepper, salt, and ketchup. Let these Ixiil, and pour the gravy so formed into the dish with the steak. Serve immediately. i • If onions be require*! with the steak, cut them in thin slices, and fry them till they are soft. They should be fried after the steak, with part of the fat in which the beef has been cooked. TO FRY MUTTON CHOPS. 1 lb. mutton chops. I 2 table-spoonMs ketchup. Pepper and salt. I 2 table-spoonfuls water. Cut the chops in the same manner as for broiling, and dress them according to the preceding directions for frying steaks. None of the grease which flows from the chops should be served with them ; the whole must be poured away before preparing the gravy. TO FRY VEAL CUTLETS. 2 table-spoonfuls ketchup. 2 table-spoonfuls water. Pepper and salt. Veal cutlets form a delicate dish, and should be fried with lard. The best cutlets are from the fillet, because they are 1 lb. veal cutlet 1 lb. bacon. 2 oz. lard.29 FRI3D VKAL CUTLETS—BEEF OR FORK SAUSAGES. free from bone; the fore or hind loin—that is, the back-ribs or loin—may be used, but the bone must bo cut away, which causes waste. Cut them half an inch in thickness. They require to be dressed slowly and thoroughly, and should be of a light-brown tinge when finished. Pour away the fat and fry thin slices of bacon; lift them out of the pan when cooked, and add the water, ketchup, pepper, salt, and a little lemon juice. Boil and stimii round the cutlets and bacon. Serve hot. TO DRESS VEAL CUTLETS. 1 lb. veal cutlet, i lb. thin bacon. 3 oz. lard. i oz. flour. 1 ^ill water. 2 eergs. ) lb. bread crumbs. 1 table-spoonful chopped parsley. 1 table-spoonful ketchup. 1 lemon. Pepper and salt. A more tasteful way of dressing cutlets is first to dip them in a beaten egg, mi.xed with the parsley, pepper, and salt, and then into crumbs of bread, after which put them in the pan, with the hot lard. Cook slowly to a nice brown colour. Lift the cutlets on to a hot dish, pour away the fat and fry the bacon; put it with the cutlets. Put the fiour into the pan and stir until brown; pour on tlie water and ketchup; pepper and salt. Let this sauce boil and skim. Dish the cutlets in a circle with slices of lemon and bacon alternately. Strain thj^ gravy round and serve hot. TO FRY BEEF OR PORK SAUSAGES. 1 lb. sausages. | Mashed potatoes. All sausages are fried alike, and require to be dressed very slowly. Before being put into the pan, they should bo blanched and pricked in sevend places with a fine fork, to prevent their biu’stiiig by the expan.sion of the air within. It is common in England to bring fried sausages to table, neatly laid out on a flat di.sh on mashed jmtatoes. The sau.sages and potatoes are helped together. They may also be laid in links on toasted bread, and garnished with poached eggs placed round the dish. Fried sausages are sometimes used for garnishing roast turkey.30 FRIED LAMB CHOPS—PORK CHOPS—TRIPE—PARSLEY. TO FRY LAMB CHOPS. 1 lb. lamb cbops. 1 oz. butter. Pepper. 2 table-spoonfuls water. 1 table-spoonful ketchup. Salt. Lamb cbops should be cut from the loin, and may be either simply fried in the same manner as mutton chops, or dressed with egg and crumbs of bread (but with no parsley), as in the case of cutlets. Gravy should be made in the ]ian, as for fried steaks. TO FRY PORK CHOPS. 1 lb. pork chops. 1 i pint apple sauce. 1 oz. lard. I Pepper and salt. Pork chops should be cut rather thin, and be thoroughly well cooked. They may be either simply fried in the same manner as chops, or fried after being first dipped in egg, and then into crumbs of bread, mixed with a little sage and onion finely chopped. No gravy is expected with pork chops. If any sauce be used, it must be apple sauce. TO FRY TRIPE. 1 lb. boiled tripe. Pepper and salt. Fat for frying. i lb. flour. 1 egg. 1 gill milk. The tripe must be washed well, and boiled till tender. Take the thickest parts and dry them with a cloth, hlake a thick batter of the flour, *c., seasoned with salt, and for those who wish it, a little minced onion. Dip the tripe into the batter so formed, after which fry to a pale brown colour, according to general directions given for ^yet-frying. Drain on porous paper. Serve on a folded napkin. Garnish with fried jjarsley. TO FRV PARSLEY. Fresh green parsley. I Hot fat. Parsley is fried only for garni.shing. It must be thoroughly dried, and fried for about a minute in hot fat or dripping. Idft it from the fat, and lay it on a paper on a sieve before the fire for the fat to drain from it.FRIED BACON—LAMB’s OR CALF’s LIVER—CALF’s FEET. 31 TO FRY BACON OR HAM AND EGGS. 6 slices of ham or bacon. | 3 or 4 eggs. The bacon should be cut very thinly in slices, not more than a quarter of an inch in thickness. The best bacon is that which is alternately streaked with fat and lean. No butter or dripping is required in the pan when frying bacon, but constant turning is necessary. When done, take the slices from the pan, and place them in a hot dish before the fire. Have the number of eggs required previously broken, each in a separate cup, and place them gently in the pan, so as to preserve them in a round flat shape. Let them remain in the pan till the white is sot; take them out carefully with a slice, and place them on the bacon. The tasteful appear- ance of this dish is spoiled if the eggs be either broken or ragged, which is very apt to be the case if they are not first broken into cups. TO FRY LAMB’S OR CALFS LIVER. 1 lb. liver. 2 oz. lard. 1 lb. bacon. 1 oz. flour. 2 gills water or gravy. Pepper and salt. Cut the liver in thin slices; dust them with flour, and fry slowjy in lard or dripjung; let them be thoroughly cooked. ^V’hen done, lift the slices out, pour away the fat, and fry the bacon; put the bacon with the liver; add the flour mixed with the water to the pan, which turn round for a minute or two to boil; season, and pour over the liver in the dish. Serve hot. TO FRY CALF’S FEET. 2 calf’s feet. Pepper and salt. Fat for fridng. J lb. flour. 1 egg. 1 giU milk. After being washed and well boiled, take the meat off the bones. Season and roll up small pieces very neatly, and dip them in a thick batter made with the flour, milk, and egg; fry them in hot fat. Drain on porous paper. Serve on a folded najikin garnished with parsley. Brains and sweetbreads may be dressed in the same manner.BOILING—BOILED SALTED BOUND OF BEEP. 32 BOILING. Boiling is cooking food in sufficient water to cover it well. First, wipe the joint with a dry cloth, and, if necessary, tie it into proper form; then weigh it and allow twenty minutes to each pound and twenty minutes over. Have ready a pan of water boiling over the fire, and plunge the meat into it; allow it to boil very quickly for four or five minutes, then throw in a little salt, and skim. Draw the pan to the side of the fire, and allow it to simmer very gently for the rest of the time. The scum must be removed as it rises, and, if necessary boiling Avater must Ije added from time to time to keep the meat covered. The strings should be cut and removed before the joint is sent to table, and a silver skewer inserted if necessary to keep it in shape till it is cold. Directions for boiling salted meat and poultry are given under the receipts for those dishes. Boiled meat is considered to be more digestible than that which is roasted, baked, or broiled. All parts of mutton and lamb may be roasted, but only the leg, neck, and head should be boiled. TO BOIL A SALTED ROUND OF BEEF. 1 round of beef. I 4 carrots. 1 bunch of grreens. I 2 white turnips. Weigh the meat, and put it into a pot with sufficient cold Avater to cover it Avell; bring it to the boil, and skim it; throAV in a little cold Avater to put it off the boil j draAv it to the side of the fire, and allow it to cook very gently for the rest of the time. AIIoav tAventy minutes for each pound, and twenty minutes over, from the time the Avatcr boils. The appropriate garnishing for this and other pieces of l)oiled salt beef is carrot, turnip, and small greens; Avhich should be added to the pot one hour before the meat is cooked. Put a little of the liquor in Avhich it has been boiled, in the dish.BOIIJED LEG OF MUTTON—LAMB—CALF’S HEAD, 33 TO BOIL A LEG OF MUTTON. 1 leg of mutton. I 1 pint caper sauce. A leg of mutton should be kept for four or five days before it is boiled. Before putting it into the pot, bend round the shank, cutting the tendon at the joint if necessary, so as to shorten the leg. Some persons, to make the joint look white and tasteful, wrap it tightly in a cloth while boiling; but this spoils the liquor for broth. Vegetables should not be boiled with a leg of mutton, as they would flavour the meat. Dish the leg with a little of the liquor, placing the lower side uppermost, conveniently for carving. A good leg of mutton will soon yield sufficient gravy. The sauce used is finely-chopped capers in melted butter. Turnips, mashed or whole, are the appropriate vegetable to be eaten with this dish. TO BOIL A LEG OF LAMB. 1 leg of lamb. 1 1 loin of lamb, i pint melted butter. I 2 oz. butter. A leg of lamb, when well boiled, is a delicate and excellent dish. When whiteness is desired, it should bo wrapped in a cloth before boiling. Garnish with the loin cut into chops and fried. The sauce used is plain melted butter, or parsley and butter. TO BOIL CALF’S HEAD. 1 calfs head. 1 table-spoonful vinegar. Pepper and salt. 1 oz. butter. 1 oz. flour. 3 gills of liquor, 2 table-spoonfuls chopped parsley. Clean and split the head, and take out the brains. Lay the head in cold water for two hours, to whiten it. Then tie it in a cloth, and boil for two and a half hours. Boil the brains in vinegar and water for twenty minutes. Put one half of the brains into the sauce. Skin the tongue; put the remainder of the brains round it in a separate dish, and serve I at the same time with the head. Pour the sauce over the head, and serve very hot. Sauce,—Melt the butter in a small pan. Add the flour, CBOILED VEAL—TURKEY. 34 and when well mixed, pour on the liquor from the head; stir until boiling. Season and add the parsley and brains. Any portions of the head left will make a good dish, cut in slices, heated, and served in a rich piquante sauce. Calf’s head served in this way is the fiimous T6te de Veau of the French. See Sauce Piquante. TO BOIL VEAL. 4 lb. knuckle of veal. I 2 lb. ham or bacon, i pint parsley sauce. Veal is seldom boiled, being too insipid for that mode of dressing. The only part which should be cooked in this manner is the knuckle, which thus requires long boiling, in order to soften the sinews. It is eaten with boiled ham o? bacon. The sauce used is parsley and butter. TO BOIL A TURKEY. 1 turkey. | l pint parsley sauce. STUFFING. i lb. bread crumbs. J lb. butter or chopped suet. Pepper and salt. 2 table-spoonfUls chopped parsley. 2 eggs. A little milk. Boiled turkey is one of the most delicate and excellent dishes Avhich can be brought to table, and should bo dressed with as much care as ])ossible. Clean the turkey from all feathers, and singe the hair with burning paper, being careful not to blacken the skin. Clean it well inside by drawing and wiping with a damp cloth. Cut off the legs at the first joints, and draw out the sinews; then pull down the skin and push the legs inside. Put the stuffing into the breast, leaving room for it to swell; after which draw the skin of the breast over the opening, and sew it neatly across the back, so that when the turkey is brought to table with its bre<ost upper- most, no stitches will be seen. Place the liver in one wing, and the gizzard in the other, turning the pinions on the back, and fixing the wings to the sides with a skewer. The turkey being now ready for the pot, put it into a clotli and boil it gently until it is cooked. A small young turkey will not require more than an hour and a half; an old and larger one35 BOILED FOWLS—BABBITS—HAM. ■will perhaps take two and a half or three hours. Let the water be hot when it is put in, and of sufficient quantity to keep the turkey always covered. When the turkey is sufficiently cooked, place it in a hot dish, pour a little sauce over the breast, and put the remainder in a sauce tureen. Various sauces may bo used, such as parsley and butter, celery, or oyster sauce. One of the most delicate and agreeable sauces is that which is made of melted butter, boiled macaroni, and milk. TO BOIL FOWLS. 1 pair fo-wls. I 1 pint parsley or egg sauce. A fowl is to be prepared for boiling in the same manner as a turkey, except that stuffing is not used. It may be Ixiiled with or without a cloth. Small fowls will require from half an hour to three-quarters of an hour; and lai-ge fowls from an hour to an hour and a half. Serve, egg sauce, or parsley and butter poured over the fowls. TO BOIL RABBITS WHOLE. 2 rabbits. I 1 pint onion sauce. Wash the rabbits well, and let them lie in warm salt and water for half an hour. Truss by cutting the sinews under the back-legs and bringing them flat to the side, and fasten them there by a skewer. Jhing the head round to the left side and fix it there by a skewer passed through the right fore-leg and the body on to the head. Tie a piece of string round the skewers under the rabbit so as to keep it in shape while cooking. Place in boiling water, and lioil slowly for an hour. When two rabbits are dished together, lay the head of one in a contrary direction to that of the other, and smotlier in onion sauce. TO BOIL A HAM. 1 ham. I Bread raspings. Greens or cabbage. If the ham has been cured long, it may require soaking in cold water to soften it, for from twelve to twenty-four hours before cooking. I’ut it in a large boiling vessel with plenty of cold water, and let it simmer slowly from two to four36 BOILED LEG OF PORK—TONGUE—TRIPE. hours, according to the size. Skim it frequently, to remove the grease which is constantly rising to the top. "When (lone, skin it, and strew bread raspings over the upper side; then place it before the lire to dry and brown. Garnish with greens or cabbage. TO BOIL LEG OF PORK. 1 leg of pork. I Peas pudding (page 106). Pork requires to be particularly well boiled. Place it in the pot with the skin side uppermost, with a plate below it, for pork is very apt to stick to the bottom of the pot. Peas pudding is generally served separately with this dish. TO BOIL A TONGUE. 1 bullock’s tongue. | Greens. If hard, soak the tongue in water all night before using. Boil it for from two hours and a half to three hours. Skin it before dishing. Garnish with greens or cabbage. TO BOIL TRIPE. 4 lb. tripe. 6 onions. 1 oz. butter. Pepper. 1 pint milk. 1 oz. arrowroot or oswego. Salt. When tripe is purchased from the butcher in a raw state, it requires to be cleansed and boiled for a very long time, to be thoroughly soft and tender. The length of time will depend on the age of the animal from which it has been taken. Sometimes, for young tripe six or seven hoiire will be suffi- cient, while old tripe will perhaps take ten or twelve. In all cases, the tripe should be well washed and scraped, put into a saucepan with cold water, brought to the boil; throw away that water and wash the tripe again in pure cold water. Return to the saucepan with i>lenty of cold Avater, and boil or rather simmer it very slowly until tender; for quick boiling hardens it. A small piece of soda added to the water Avill help to keep the tripe a good colour. It should be cut into moderately-sized pieces for helping at table. hen to be served plain, carry to table in a hash dish, with some of37 BOII,ED COW-HEEL—STEWS—HASHES. the water in which it has been boiled, and onions cooked w’ith the tripe for the last two hours. A tasteful way of serving tripe is to take it from its liquor after it has been boiled, and stcAV it for about ton minutes in a saucepan with milk, thicken with arrowroot or oswego; just before serving add the butter, and season with pepper and salt. This makes a delicious and cheap dish. TO BOIL COW-HEEL. 1 cow-heel. I 4 pint paisley sauce. Wash, scrape, and cut the heel into pieces. Cover with cold water and let boil, throw away that water and wash the heel well again; put it into the saucepan Avith enough cold water to cover it, and simmer or boil slowly for five or six hours, or till the bones will slip out. Serve Avith parsley sauce. STEWS, HASHES, AND RE-DRESSING COLD :meat. Stewing is a method of ])reparing meat by sIoav simmering. This is a much more savoury mode of cookery than boiling; any part of the juices of the meat Avhich may have been draAvn out in cooking being preserved and served in the li(|uor, Avhich should be highly seasoned. Generally, much more can be made of meat by steAving, than by roasting, broiling, or frying, because nothing is lost in the process of dressing. It also jx)8sesses the decided advantage of being a convenient Avay in Avhich meat may be dressed for a person Avhose time of dining is uncertain. A steAved steak, for instance, Avill keep Avarm and in good condition for an hour, but a broiled or fried steak cannot be kept a minute after dressing. An iron pan is best, as it takes a longer time for the heat to penetrate. SteAvs Avhich are highly dressed, and are composed of various parts prepared in a different manner, are called made dinhes. A highly-seasoned steAV forms Avhat is termed a ra/juut.STEWED BEEF—SHOULDER OP MUTTON. 38 TO STEW A PIECE OF BEEF, OR MAKE BEEF BOUILLI. 6 lb. baef. 1 oz. butter. 3 onions.

Pour it into basins, or earthenware shajies, and stand in a cool ])lace. When quite cold, it forms a jelly, and should bo turned out on a dish for use. If it does not come out easily, dip the shape in hot water, and the heat will immediately loosen it. Garnish with sprigs of fresh parsley.47 SOUPS AND BROTHS. SOUPS AND BROTHS. No middle-class kitchen should be without a stock-pot, which with ordinary care and attention will, by the proper selection and use of scraps and bones, supply the stock without which no soup, sauce, or stew can be satisfactorily prepared. Into the stock-pot should be put all bones from roasted or boiled joints broken up, the carcasses of poultry and game, if not too high, gravy, and scraps in general; if necessary, a few pounds of bones can bo bought and added. Cover these well with water, or the liquor in which a joint has been boiled; bring it to the boil; throw in a little salt and a few flavouring vegetables, and allow to simmer gently for five or six hours. Then strain the liquor into a basin, and set aside to get quite cold. Remove the fat from the top before using. In w'arm weather this stock must be reboiled every day, and in winter once in three days. The stock-jx)t must be washed and well scoured, rinsed, and dried each time after use. Another and vcr}- nutritious stock may be made from fish l)ones and trimmings, except those of mackerel, herring, and dried Jish. I^ut them into a pan, with sufficient water to cover them, and a small piece of the various flavouring vegetables, twelve peppercorns, and a blade of mace. Cover and simmer for two hours, skimming carefully and frequently. Strain through a sieve and allow the stock to cool. Then remove the scum from the top, and it is ready for use. This stock forms the foundation for many fish soup.s. A cod’s head may Ije used instead of bones and trimmings, or the litpior in which a turbot has been boiled. The stock for the more elaborate soups, such as brown, clear, and white souj)S, must be specially made from fresh meat. It is better flavoured when inade from different kinds of meat. If brown stock is wanted, brown meat must pre- dominate ; if a paler stock, brown and white meat in equal quantities; and if white stock, white meat only must be used.BROWN on GRAVY SOUP—KIDNEY SOUP. 48 TO MAKE BROWN OR GRAVY SOUP. 4 lb. shin of beef. 2 small carrots. 1 turnip. 1 stick of celery.

PEAS SOUP AVITH MEAT 1 lb. split peas. 3 onions, 1 carrot, 1 turnip. 1 head of celery, 3 quarts water. OR BONES, 0d. worth of bones. 1 lb. ham. Parsley. 1 teaspoonfUl salt. Break the bones, and put them into a saucepan Avith the cold Avater. Wash the peas, and put them Avith the bones; add the salt, and let boil. Skim thoroughly before adding the vegetables, all cut into small pieces. Boil Avith the lid off the pan for half an hour, skimming as required. Then put the lid on the pan and let all boil for four hours, stirring frequently, as the soup is very apt to burn. When the peas are quite soft, put the soup, peas, and vegetables through a sieve. Return to the saucepan, and stir until the pulp is mixed with the soup. Add salt, a lump of sugar, and pepper, to taste, and boil again for a few minutes. Serve hot with toasted bread cut into small square pieces separately. PEAS SOUP WITHOUT MEAT OR BONES. 2 lb. split peas. 4 quarts water, i lb. dripping. Pepper. 4 onions, 2 carrots, 1 turnip. Salt. Put the peas aa'cII Avashed into a saucepan with the dripping, toss them over the fire for five minutes, add the Avater. Boil and skim thoroughly; cut the vegetables small54 LENTIL SOUP—TOMATO SOUP. and add them to the soup. Season to taste. Boil for two hours or more until the peas are quite soft and the soujx thick and pulpy. If the soup become too thick, add a little boiling water. The peas may be boiled the evening before being used, and the longer they bod the smoother and more mellow the soup will be; but do not put in the vegetables mitil the day the soup is to be usei By this plan the soup does not require straining, or passing through a sieve. LENTIL SOUP. 1 pint red lentils. 2 onions. 1 carrot. 1 turnip. 2 quarts water. 2 oz. butter or dripping. 1 teaspoonful salt. 1 teaspoonful pepper. This soup is very nourishing, and to be well made requires a great deal of attention. Wash the lentils through several waters untd clean j soak them in the cold water for a night Put the lentils, water, and salt hito a large saucepan, let them boil ■without a lid on the pan and skim thoroughly; unless this be well done the soup will have a rough and coarse taste. Cut the vegetables into small pieces, add them to the lentils, and boil for three hours, skimming frequently. Press through a colander, season to taste, and serve very hot with toasted bread cut into dice separately. TOMATO SOUP. 2 lb. fresh tomatoes or 1 can of tomatoes. 2 onions. 2 oz. ham. 1 lump of sugar. Juice from half a lemon. 1 red carrot. 1 head celery. 2 pints stock. Pepper and ssdt. 1 table-spoonfUl crushed tapioca. Tomatoes are valuable as a wholesome article of diet, and when they cannot be procured fre.sh, can be had preserved in tins. Put into a stew-pan the butter, ham, sliced onions, cjvrrot, celery, and tomatoes cut into pieces. Put the lid on the pan, and shake the contents over the fire for about five minutes. Add the stock, pepper, and salt, and let all simmer for an hour and a half. Pass all through a hair-sieve, keeping back the skin and seeds; return to the saucepan ''vith the tapioca. Stir till it boils; add sugar and lemon-juice, and boil for ten minutes. Serve hot.55 VEGETABLE SOUP—BROTH MAIGRB. LEEK SOUP- LEEK SOUP. 2 quarts stock. I 1 roll. 2 dozen leeks. I Pepper and salt. Use very little more of the leeks than the white, and cut them into pieces about an inch long. Pour boiling water over them, and let them stand for ten minutes; throw away the water. Put the leeks into a saucepan with the stock, and boil for four or five hours, skimming now and again. When the leeks are quite soft and the soup thickened with them, season to taste, and pour into a hot soup tureen, containing the roll cut into slices and previously dried in the oven. Serve very hot. VEGETABLE SOUP. 6 onions. 3 carrots. 1 turnip. 2 lettuces or 1 cabbage. 2 leeks. 3 oz. dripping. 0 pints water. 4 oz. broken bread. Pepper and salt. Prepare the vegetables, and cut them all very small; wash and dry them. Melt the dripping in a large saucepan; add the vegetables, put the lid on the pan, and toss the contents over the fire until all are well mixed. Pour on the "water; let it come to the boil without a lid; add seasonings, and skim well. Boil for half an hour, skimming at intervals as required. Cover, and let simmer for one hour or until the vegetables are thoroughly cooked. Put the broken bread into a hot soup tureen, and pour the boiling soup over it. Cover, and send to table very hot. BROTH MAIGRE. 4 onions. 2 potatoes. 1 cupful of rice. 2 oz. dripping. 1 carrot. 1 turnip. 2 quarts water. Pepper and salt. Slice the onions and put them into a stew-pan with the dripping, and fry them until they are quite soft and have a rich brown tinge. Then put in the cold water, with the carrot, turnip, and potatoes sliced, and also the rice well washed; boil for an hour; after which add more boiling water if required. Boil until all the vegetables are soft andFISH SOUP—SCOTCH DISHES—SHEEPS HAGGIS. 56 pulpy, and stir until the soup is of a uniform thickness. An easy method is to pass all through a sieve or colander. Season with pepper and salt, and serve very hot. FISH SOUP. 1 quart fish stock (page 47). ■ 1 table-spoonful rice flour. ] 1 pint new milk. i 1 fllleted haddock cut in | small pieces. ! Cayenne 1 oz. butter. 1 table-spoonful flnely- minced parsley. Juice from half a lemon. Salt, pepper. Put the stock into a saucepan, and let it get quite hot; throw in the pieces of fish, and boil for three minutes, remov- ing any scum that may rise. Break the rice-flour wth the milk; add this with the butter to the stock, and stir until boiling; add Cayenne pepper and salt to taste, and just at the last, the lemon-juice and parsley. Serve at once. If a richer soup is wished, beat well together a gill of cream and the yolks of two eggs; put them into the soup tureen, and pour on to them the boiling soup, stirring the whole time. Serve at once. SCOTCH DISHES. The Scotch have a number of dishes which are iTeculiarly their own, for the jireparation of which they have obtained some degree of celebrity. We give recipes for some of these below. Perhaps the most distinctively Scotch are sheep’s head and broth, and the Haggis, of which there are two varieties—sheep and lamb. SHEEP’S HAGGIS. 1 sheep’s pluck. 1 lb. beef suet. 2 teacupfuls oatmeal. Stomach baga. 4 onions. Pepper and salt. Procure the large and one of the small stomach bags of a sheep with the pluck. W^ash the bags well in cold water; then plunge them into boiling water, and scrape them, taking care not to break them; let them lie all night in cold water with a little salt in it. Wash the pluck; put it into a pan57 LAMBS HAGGIS—BROTH, of boiling water, letting the windpipe bang over the side of the pan that all impurities may escape; allow it to boil for an hour and a half; then lift it from the pan, and let it get cold. Cut away the windpipe and any fat or gristle that may be attached to it. Grate a quarter of the liver (the rest of the liver will not be required for the haggis), and mince the heart, lights, and suet; parboil the onions and chop them; dry or toast the oatmeal before the fire; mix all thoroughly well together, and add black pepper and salt, and half a pint of the liquor in which the pluck was boiled. Fill the bags rather more than half full (if they be too full they will burst in boiling), and sew them up with a needle ;ind thread. Put them into a pan of boiling water, and boil for three hours, pricking the bags occasionally with a large needle to allow the air to escape, and prevent them bursting. Serve in a folded napkin on a hot dish, without garnish or gravy, as they are sufficiently rich in themselves. The materials used vary a little; for instance, a little minced tripe is sometimes added, but the above is the usual method of making haggis. LAMB’S HAGGIS. 1 lamb’s fry. 1 lamb’s pluck. 1 large bag. i lb. suet. 1 te£W3upful oatmeal. Pepper and salt. This is a much more delicate dish than sheep’s haggis, but is less frequently made. The fry is composed of the sweet- breads, kernels, &c. Prepare the bag, as in a sheep’s haggia Cleanse thoroughly every other part; parboil and chop all finely with the suet. Mix with dried oatmeal, salt, and {lepper, and sew the mixture in the bag. Boil and attend to it in the same manner as a sheep’s haggis. Serve hot. BROTH, OR ‘KAIL.’ 3 lb. neck of mutton or runner of beef. J cupful pearl barley. Bait. 2 quarts water. 3 leeks. 2 carrots. 1 small turnip. i cabbage. Broth is made from beef or mutton. In winter salted mutton, steeped for a short time in cold water before using, is often substituted for fresh meat; and where meat cannot58 HOTCH-POTCH—COCKIE-LEEKIE. be obtained, it is not unusual to make the broth with butter or dripping kneaded with a little oatmeal. Put the meat and cold water into a saucepan with the pearl-barley, and let it boil. Skim thoroughly and add the salt. Allow it to boil gently for an hour, skimming occasion- ally. Then add one carrot grated, lialf a turnip cut in squares, the leeks shred, a few pieces of carrot and turnip, and the cabbage chopped, parboiled, and drained. When cabbage cannot bo procured, the same quantity of greens should bo used. Boil for an hour after the vegetables are put in. If necessary, a small quantity of hot water should be added to compensate for the loss in boiling. The broth is now ready. Season, and serve in a tureen. The meat should be served in a separate dish, garnished with the uncut pieces of turnip and carrot, and a little of the broth as gravy. HOTCH-POTCH. 3 lb. lamb. 2 pints grreen peas. 1 lettuce. 6 spring onions. 1 pint beans. 5 yoiing carrots. 3 young turnips. 1 small caxiliflower. Parsley. 2 quarts water. This dish can only be obtained in perfection when green peas are in season. Trim the joint from all superfluous fat, and put it into a clean saucepan Avith the boiling water, two or three carrots cut into squares, and two grated, the turnips cut in squares, the cauliflower and a lettuce cut small, the onions shred, the parsley chopped, and about a pint of peas shelled and a pint of beans shelled and skinned. Boil for an hour and a half, then take out the meat, and after cutting it in chops, lay it aside. Add another pint of young peas, season with pepper and salt; when these peas are cooked, put in the chops. Heat for a few minutes, and serve the Avholo in a tureen. COCKIE-LEEKIE. 1 fowl. I 18 leeks. 2 quarts stock or water. I Pepper and salt. Prepare the leeks by removing the root and green parts, cut them in slices, and cover with boiling tvaixjr for five minutes. Drain, and put the leeks with a largo fotvl trussed as if for boiling into a saucepan with the stock, pepper, and59 sheep’s head—sheep’s-head pie. ?salt. Cook very slowly for about two hours. Cut tlio fow’l iin pieces, and place it in the tureen; pour over them the jsoup, which should be quite thick with leeks. SHEEP’S HEAD. 1 sheep’s head and trotters. Pepper and s€ilt. 2 carrots. 1 turnip. 1 pint parsley sauce. After the head has been singed, soak it for some time in iW'arm water, and then scrape it until it is perfectly clean. 'Then split the head and remove the brains. Take out the teyes, and scrape and clean the nostrils; after which wash the ihead again, and let it lie in warm water and salt for a short itime. It is usual to procure the trotters with the head, and I to subject them to similar treatment. Tbe head and trotters 1 being clean, put them, with sufficient water to cover them, iinto a saucepan, and let them boil till the skin is soft and I tender, which may be in about three hours. I3oil the brains : in salt, vinegar, and water for ten minutes; drain and chop I them. Place the two halves of the head flat upon a dish, • cover with parsley sauce—garnish with the brains on the ' head—and the trotters, carrot, and turnip round it. Sheep’s head is seldom thus prepared without broth being i afterwards made of the liquor in which it was boiled. Let the liquor get quite cold ; then remove all fat from it, and put it into a saucepan with one small cupful of pearl barley, well washed; let it boil for half an hour; then add two carrots and two turnips cut into small dice, three onions sliced, and a little parsley; boil slowly for two hours, and season with salt only. Serve hot. SHEEP’S-HEAD PIE. 1 sheep’s head and trotters. A little powdered mace. A little powdered gingrer. i lb. rough puff pastry, i lb. bacon. 3 eggs. Pepper and salt. After tbe head and trotters have been properly cleaned, simmer slowly for five or six hours. Whilst warm, remove the bones, and cut the head and feet neatly into small pieces. Have ready some bacon and hard-boiled eggs sliced. Place a layer of sheep’s head in the bottom of a pie-dish. Sprinklelamb’s head and pluck. 60 over it a mixture of pepper, salt, mace, and ginger; then put a layer of bacon and eggs. Repeat till the dish is filled. Add a cupful of the liquor in which the head was cooked. Cover with paste (page 93); bake an hour and a half. Oystere may be substituted for the eggs; this is the true Scotch method. TO DRESS 1 lamb’s head. 4 table-spoonful parsley chopped. 2 oz. flour. 1 onion chopped. A LAMB’S HEAD AND PLUCK. 2 oz. butter. 3 egga. Bread crumbs. A little milk. 1 table-spoonful ketchup. Fat for frying. Lamb’s heads ai-e procured skinned. Take the head with the neck attached; split the forehead, take out the brains, and put them aside in salt and water. Wash the head carefully, rubbing the nostrils well with salt, take out the eyes; put it on to boil with the heart, half the liver, and the lights, leaving the lid of the pan partly open, that the gases may escape; let all simmer for an hour and a quarter, and then take them out; dry the head and neck with a cloth; brush it over with a beaten egg, strew crumbs of bread seasoned with pepper and salt over it, put small pieces of butter on the top, and lay it in a dish before a clear fire, to brown lightly. Mince the lights, heart, and liver, and mix them with the onion, parsley, pepper, salt, ketchup, and a little flour ; add some of the liquor in which the head was cooked to make a gravy. Let these simmer by the side of the fire for half an hour. Wash the brains; boil them for ten minutes in hot salt, vinegar, and water. Drain the water from them, and beat them with two eggs, two table-spoonfuls of bread crumbs, a little flour and finely-chopped parsley, pepper, salt, imd milk, if necessary, to form a thick batter. Have ready a pan of hot fat or dripping, and fry the batter in small round cakes to a nice brown. Cut the remainder of the liver in slices, dust it with flour, and fry it. Place the head upon a di.sh with the hash round it, and lay a slice cf liver and a brain-cake alternately on the hash all round. Caro must be taken to have all the parts of this dish hot and ready to serve at the proper time.61 DRESSED VEAL PLUCK—MINCED COLLOPS. TO DRESS A VEAL PLUCK. 1 calf 8 pluck. 1 onion. 2 oz. flour. 2 table-spoonfuls ketchup, i lb. bacon. Dripping. STUFFING FOR HEART. 2 oz. bread crumbs. 1 oz. suet chopped. 1 egg. 1 table-spoonful parsley chopped. Pepper and salt. Wash the pluck and dry it. Stuff the heart in the opening at the top with a stuffing made of the above ingredients, and sew it up. Then roast it for from half an hour to three-quarters of an hour according to the size. Parboil the lights and half the liver; mince them finely, and stew them for half an hour in a little of the liquor in which they were boiled, with a chopped onion, pepper, salt, ketchup, and a little flour. Cut the remainder of the liver in slices, toss them in flour, and fry them with the slices of bacon. Place the heart in the centre of a hot dish, with the hash round it, and a slice of liver, and one of bacon alternately on the hash all round. Another way.—Parboil, and then mince the heart and lights with seasonings as above. Stew for half an hour with a little of the liquor in which the heart and lights were boiled. Cut the liver in slices, toss them in flour, and fry them with the slices of bacon. Pour the hash into a deep, hot dish, and garnish on the top with the liver and bacon. To make collops, take a slice of lean beef (steak from the round is best), remove all fat and skin, and mince finely. Put the butter into a stew-pan, and, when it is melted, add the collops and the onion sliced. Beat well with a spoon or beater until the collops are separated; then add the bread crumbs, water, ketchup, pepper, and salt. Cover closely, and allow all to simmer gently for one hour, stirring occasionally. Pour on to a hot dish, and garnish with toasted sippets. MINCED COLLOPS. 1 lb. beef collops. 1 small onion. Pepper. Salt. Toasted sippets. 1 oz. butter. 1 table-spoonfUl ketchup. 3 table-spoonfuls water. 1 table-spoonfUl bread crumbs.62 POTATO SOUP—OATMEAL PORRIDGE—SAUCES. POTATO SOUP. 6 potatoes. S leeks or onions. 1 carrot. Pepper. Boast meat bones or 2 oz. dripping. 3 pints cold water. Salt. Take any bones of cold roast meat, a marrow-bone, or, failing these, a piece of dripping, put them into a saucepan with the cold water, and let them boil for one hour. Have ready the potatoes and leeks or onions parboiled and thinly sliced, and the carrot, grated. Strain the stock from the bones on to these. Return to the saucepan, season with pepper and salt, and boil for one hour. Stir and skim occasionally. Break the vegetables by the side of the pan so that the soup may be thick and pulpy. Serve hot. OATMEAL PORRIDGE. The best oatmeal for porridge is that which is coarse in the grains or particles, and which has been stored for twelve months. New meal is heating in its quality. Put a sauce- pan on the fire with water proportionate to the quantity of porridge required. Salt it to taste. When the water boils, begin sprinkling in the oatmeal with one hand, while you stir with a stick with the other. Endeavour to calculate what quantity of meal will be necessary to produce the desired thickness, and sprinkle it in as quickly as possible, so as to let it all boil equally. A common error is to continue putting in meal to the last. After aU the meal is in, continue boiling and stiiring for about ten minutes, taking care that no knots or lumps are formed. When sufficiently boiled, pour the porridge into dishes. This is genuine Scotch porridge, which is eaten when partially cool, with sweet milk. SAUCES. MUSHROOM SAUCE. 24 mushrooms.

Let the sauce stand for half an hour before using. Serve over cold fowl, salmon, or salad, or separately in a sauce-boat with hot salmon, trout, &c. The appearance of this sauce may be varied by the addition of a little finely- chopped parsley or Tarragon stirred in just before serving. FISH. Fish is dressed in a variety of ways, according to the kind and freshness of the fish, or to suit the taste of individuals. It may be boiled, broiled, baked, stewed, or fried, but the most common methods of cooking it are boiling and frying. Great care must be given to the preparation and cooking of fish. When properly prepared and well cooked, it is a pleasant and nutritious article of food; but if badly prepared and underdone, it not only has a most unpleasing appearance, but is more liable than any other kind of food to cause indi- gestion and other bad effects. White-fleshed fish is considered to be the most delicate, and the red-fleshed and oily kinds the most nourishing. To cleanse Fish.—Fresh-water fish should bo cleaned as soon as they are caught, salt-water fish just before they are to be used. Make a slight incision in the side, and take out the inside; carefully remove the thin black membrane lining the cavity, as it is apt to impart a bitter flavour to the whole fish if it is left Scrape from the tail towards the head to remove the scales; take out the eyes; wash the fish in plenty of water with a little salt in it, and dry it carefully. Handle the fish as little as possible, and do not allow it to lie in the water, or the flavour will be washed away before it is time to cook it. TO BOIL FISH. If a whole fish is to be cooked, prepare it as above directed; have ready a fish-kettle containing sufficient cold water to cover the fish, with salt in the proportion of about two ounces to each half-gallon of water; place the fish on a drainer, and put it into the fish-kettle; bring it to the boil, add69 FRIED FISH. about a table-spoonful of cold water, and skim; then draw the kettle to the side of the fire, and simmer slowly till the fish is cooked. If the fish has been cut, have ready over the fire a fish- kettle of water boiling rapidly, containing enough water to cover the fish and salt in the above proportion; place the fish on a drainer, and put it into the water; allow it to boil rapidly for three or four minutes; tlien skim, draw the fish-kettle to the side of the fire, and allow it to simmer very gently till the fish is cooked. The time required depends entirely on tlie fiesliness and thickness of the fish, and varies so much that to give any ride would be practically useless; experience is the only guide. We give, however, three reliable tests by which it can be ascertained whether it is sufficiently cooked; first, if the fins can be easily removed; second, if the skin of the fish is cracked; or, third, if a skewer passes easily when run into the fish close to the bone. Fish sliould always be put into the water in which it is to be cooked; if the water is poured upon it, it is apt to become broken. It should not be allowed to remain in the water after it is ready; if it has to be kept hot it should be taken up upon the drainer, placed across the fish-kettle over the hot water, and covered with a soft cloth or flannel folded several times. TO FRY FISH. White fish, such as whiting and haddocks, should be fried whole if they are small; they must first bo washed and skinned, and then the tail should be passed through the eye sockets. Soles and plaice, if larger than medium size, and also large whiting and haddocks, should be filleted, and the fillets cut into conveniently-sized pieces, the bones and trimmings being used for fish stock (see page 47). When the fish is so far pi-epared, washed, and dried, dust it well with hour to absorb any remaining moisture; then dip it into a well-beaten egg seasoned with pepper and salt, and toss it in a paper with plenty of bread crumbs, turning it if necessaiy Avith a fork or skewer, but not with the fingers and thmnb. As each piece is prepared, lay it upon a sieve or piece of paper, until it is time to cook it. Heat in a70 BOILED SALMON—SALMON STEAKS—KIPPERED SALMON. saucepan enough clarified fat to fill the saucepan about three- quarters when it is melted; when it is ready (see page 27) put in a few pieces of the prepared fish, and fry them for three or four minutes until they are a nice golden brown. Lift them with a perforated spoon on to a piece of porous paper to drain, and keep them hot in the oven or before the fire until the rest of the fish is cooked. Ascertain that the fat is quite hot again before any more fish is put into it. When all is cooked, serve hot and crisp on a folded napkin or fish-paper, and garnish with parsley. BOILED SALMON. Prepare and boil according to general directions. Serve on a hot dish with a drainer, and place a folded napkin under the fish; garnish with parsley and cut lemon. Send to table with it, in a sauce-boat, melted butter, parsley, mayonnaise or hollandaise sauce, and a dish of sliced cucum- ber, prepared with a little white vinegar, salad oil, pepper, and salt. Some of the water in which the fish was boiled may also be served with it in a sauce-boat. SALMON STEAKS. Cut thick slices of salmon; wash and dry them; rub them with oil or oiled butter, and sprinkle over them a good pinch of pepper and salt. Heat a gridiron and grease it well, place the salmon steaks upon it, and broil them oyer a very clear fire for from ten to fifteen minutes according to the thickness, turning them frequently. Serve very hot, with pats of fresh butter. KIPPERED SALMON. 2 slices salmon. 1 Lemon-juice. Writing paper. I Butter. Cayenne pepper. Cut neat square slices of salmon; wash them thoroughly in cold water, and dry them. Butter a sheet of thick writing paper well inside and out; lay a piece of the fish upon one side, and put upon it a small pat of butter, a pinch of Cayenne pepper, and a squeeze of lemon-juice; fold the other half of the paper over, and secure it noiitly round the fish.71 FRIED TROUT OR HERRINGS—BOILED TURBOT. SO that it is tightly enveloped in it. Prepare the other slice of fish in the same way, and place both on a hot, well- greased gridiron; cook the salmon for four or five minutes, turning it constantly that it may be thoroughly heated through. Serve in the papers on a hot dish, and garnish Avith parsley. FRIED TROUT OR HERRINGS. 6 trout or herringis. I Oatmeal or flour. 1 lb. dripping. I A little milk. Pepper and salt. Trout of a moderate size should be dressed Avhole, and are best fried. Clean the fish, scale, and wash them. Sprinkle a little pepper and salt over them, and toss them in oatmeal or flour; melt the dripping in a frying-pan, and let it get quite hot; then put in the fish, and fry them for six or seven minutes, turning them that both sides may be browned. Lift them on to a piece of porous paper to drain, and serve on a hot dish Avith a folded napkin under them. BOILED TURBOT. Turbot is considered to be the finest flat fish, and requires care both in the preparation and in cooking. It is best to choose a medium-sized fish, Avhich shouhl be thick in the middle, of a cream-coloured Avhite, and elastic to the touch. Before it is to be cooked, alloAv it to lie for ten minutes in strong salt and Avater, and then rub it Avell with the hand to remove the slime. Wash it carefully in fresh Avater, and dry it. Leave the fins on, and make an incision in the black side to prevent the Avhite skin from cracking; rub the AA’hite side Avith lemon-juice and a little salt to preserve the colour. See that the fish-kettle is roomy and scrupulously clean; then boil according to general directions for from tAventy-five to thirty minutes, skimming very carefully Avhen necessary. Serve Avith the Avhite side uppermost, on a hot dish, Avith a folded napkin under the lish. Garnish Avith crimped parsley, cut lemon, and lobster spawn. Serve sejiarately in a sauce-boat, lobster, hollandaise, or butter sauce.72 BAKED TUBBOT—BOILED HALIBUT—COl).

Place them in a well-buttered dish, with a jneco of butter on each piece of fish, and bake in a moderately hot oven for about half an hour, basting frequently. When cooked, lay the pieces in a hot dish, and pour the ketchup and vinegar into the dish in which the turbot was cooked. Season and boil the sauce, and pour it round the fillets. Serve hot. Oyster or lobster sauce may be served, when liked, with fillets prepared in this way. BOILED HALIBUT. This fish is far inferior to turbot, but it may be prepared and boiled in the same way. Serve hot, with egg, parsley, or butter sauce, in a sauce-boat. BOILED COD. Prepare and boil according to general directions. Serve on a hot dish with a folded napkin under the fish, and oyster, egg, parsley, or butter sauce separately in a sauce-boat. TO DRESS A COD’S HEAD AND SHOULDERS. 1 cod’s head and shoulders.

This -way of dressing haddocks is suitable only where they are to be had perfectly fresh. Take liaddocks of a medium size; cleanse and wash them thoroughly; rub them with salt, and allow them to lie in salt for one night. Next day, pass a thick wire through the eyes, and hang them up for two days in the open air outside a house, where the sun will not touch them. To dress the haddocks, take out the backbones, and skin them. Broil them over a clear fire on a gridiron, previously rubbed with fat. When they are cooked place them on a hot dish, rub a good pat of butter over each hsh, aud serve very hot. POTTED SOLES. 2 soles. 1 lemon. 2 eggs. 1 oz. gelatin. Parsley. Cayenne pepper. 2 table-spoonfuls anchovy sauce.. A little nutmeg. 1 pint water. Fillet the soles, and season each fillet with a little lemon- juice, parsley, Cayenne, nutmeg, and salt.

Hold the handle, and keep the pan moving over the fire until the omelet mixture looks of the consistency of thick ci-eam; let the pan tlien rest over the fire for about a minute. Swiftly slide a broad pliable knife or a slice under one half, and fold it over the other half to form an oval. Trim the edges neatly, and tilt the pan, so that the lower side of the omelet may become of a golden-brown colour; it will then be ready. Reverse the pan over a hot dish, and serve quickly with the brown side uppermost. The omelet should be brown and firm on the outside, but soft and creamy inside when broken. Never turn an omelet, as this makes it heavy. FISH PIE. 2 haddocks. 3 oz. butter. 18 oysters. i lemon. 1 egg. 1 gill milk. Bread crumbs. Pepper and salt. Clean, skin, and fillet the haddocks.

The attractiveness of the dish depends on the neatness of the wall of potatoes. Serve hot. CURRIES. Almost any kind of food, cooked or uncooked, can be curried, cold cooked beef being perhaps the only exception. Uncooked meat will of course take longer in stewing than that which has been previously cooked, and it should be first tossed in butter over the fire till it is of a pale golden colour. All skin, bone, and fat should be removed from whatever is to be curried, and it should then be cut up into small square pieces. Boiled rice (page 137) should always bo served with or around curry. Curry powder can be bought from any chemist or Italian warehouseman, but for the benefit of those who prefer to make their own we give a genuine Indian recipe, which has been thoroughly tested. CURRY POWDER. 1 oz. cummin seed. 6 oz. coriander seed. 3 oz. whole rice, i oz. cinnamon stick. 1 oz. i oz. cardamom seed. 0 oz. turmeric. 1 oz. allspice, i oz. Cayenne pepper. black pepper.

Just before serving add one table-spoonful cream and a little salt. Serve on a hot dish, with rice in a wall around it, or separately. If fresh cocoa-nut cannot be obtained, one table-spoonful of desiccated cocoa-nut may be used instead. Skin and fillet the haddocks, cut the fish into neat pieces, and put the bones in a saucepan with half a pint of water and a little salt to make stock. Melt the butter in a saucepan, and fry the onion and apple chopped, with the curry powder and rice flour, for a few minutes; pour on the fish stock strained, stir until boiling, skim, and simmer until the onions are soft and pulpy.

Lift them carefully on to a hot dish, pour the sauce over and servo hot, with boiled rice (page 137). DRESSING VEGETABLES. All vegetables ought to be cooked as soon after being gathered as possible, and, excepting spinach and potatoes, should be boiled in a large quantity of water, to carry off any rankness of flavour. They should bo served as soon as dressed, and not permitted to lie a moment in the water84 GREEN VEGETABLES—GREEN PEAS—ASPARAGUS. after they are ready for dishing. The time required for boil- ing vegetables depends on their age, freshness, and size. Pass a fork through the stem, and feel if they are soft Potatoes ought not to be dressed in a saucepan used for any other purpose. A potato saucepan discolours everything dressed in it TO BOIL GREEN VEGETABLES. Wash the vegetables thoroughly, and remove all decayed leaves, or discoloured parts. Cut into quarters, take out the hard stalks, and let the pieces lie in cold water with a little vinegar for half an hour. This will remove any insects, caterpillars, &c. Wash again in fresh cold water, and at once plunge into boiling ssilt and water; let the water boil rapidly without a lid on the pan imtil the vegetable falls; it should then be cooked. Drain immediately, and serve very hot. The green colour is preserved by the rapid boiling of the water; slow cooking produces a dull colour and dry insipid flavour in most green vegetables. TO BOIL GREEN PEAS. 1 peck peas. I 1 teaspoonful salt. 1 oz. butter. 1 1 lump of sugrar. Peas should not be shelled until just before they are to be cooked. Wash them in cold water, when the decayed peas will rise to the top; take them away, and put the good ones into a saucepan containing sulflcient boiling water to cover them, with the salt and sugar. They will require about twenty minutes to cook. AVhen done, strain the water through a colander, and put the peas into a vegetable dish with the butter; stir gently till the butter is melted, and serve hot. TO DRESS ASPARAGUS AND SEAKALE. 50 beads of asparagus. I J pint melted butter. 1 slice toasted bread. 1 Salt. Scrajie the white part of the asparagus, and throw them into cold water; bind them in small bundles of about twenty, placing the green heads together, and cut ^ them evenly at the other end, leaving them about five inches long. Then put them into boiling water with salt, andBOILED CARROTS—TURNIPS—JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES. 85 boil quickly ■without a lid, till the heads are tender. Dip the toast into the water the asparagus was cooked in, and place it in the dish on which the asparagus is to be served. Untie and place the asparagus on the toast, with the heads together. Servo melted butter in a separate dish. Seakale is dressed in the same manner, except that there is no toast laid under it. TO BOIL CARROTS AND PARSNIPS. Carrots. I Salt. Bollingr water. Can’ots must first be washed and then lightly scraped, and boiled till they are soft. The length of time required for boiling ciirrots depends on their ago and size. Small carrots are served whole, but large ones should bo cut in four pieces lengthwise, and about an hour should be allo-wed for cooking them. Parsnips should be scraped and prepared in the same manner. TO BOIL TURNIPS. 4 turnips. I Pepper and salt. 2 oz. butter. 1 Boiling water. Old turnips require to be pared much deeper than young ones. There is a woody fibrous substance extending to about the eighth of an inch below the skin, which must always be cut away. When very small, peel, but do not cut them; and after boiling, serve whole, with a little butter in the dish. Large turnips should be cut in pieces before being put into the pot, and after being boiled, should bo drained and served in these pieces, or mashed with butter, pepper, and salt. JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES. 2 lb. artichokes. | 1 pint milk. Salt. I 2 pints water. 1 table-spoonful vinegar. Wash the artichokes, and ])eel them thickly to remove the outer fibrous coating with which they are surrounded; then pare or scrape them to a round or oval shape, and as each is prepared throw it into a basin of cold water with the vinegar,86 BOILED FRENCH BEANS—HARICOT BEANS—SPINACH. to preserve the colour. Have ready boiling over the fire a saucepan containing the milk and water with a little salt.

Drain the water from them; take away the onion; add a little salt, pepper, chopped parsley, and about two ounces of butter. Place over the fire, and stir for a few minutes tiU thoroughly hot. Serve in a vege- table dish. TO BOIL SPINACH. A pailful of spinach. i Salt. 2 oz. butter. I Slice of toast. Vinegar. Pick each leaf from the stem or root, and wash in several waters. Drain it, and put it into a saucepan with a tea- spoonful of salt, and if old a piece of washuig soda the size87 BOILED BEETROOT—POTATOES. of a split pea; put the lid on the pan and boil until soft, stirring occasionally. Then strain the water through a sieve, and pour cold water over tlie spinach. Squeeze the water from it, chop it, and put it into a stew-pan with a little vinegar and butter. Stir over the lire till hot, put the buttered toast on a flat dish, place the spinach on this, and mark it in squares with a knife, cutting it quite through, that it may be easily helped at table. If for a supper dish, some poached eggs may bo put upon it. TO BOIL BEETROOT. 1 beetroot. I Pepper. 1 gill vinegar. I Salt. Wash and brush the beetroot quite clean, being careful not to break off the top or any of the projecting fibres, as any opening made in the skin will allow the juice to escape, and thereby spoil the colour of the root. Boil for an hour or more, according to size. When done, skin and trim it, and serve in a vegetable dish. If cut in slices, when cold, and covered with vinegar, pepper, and salt, beetroot makes an excellent pickle, and will bo ready for use in twelve hours. BOILED POTATOES. Potatoes Boiled in their Skins.—Wash and brush the potatoes well, taking care not to break the skins. When they are quite clean, pack them tightly into a saucepan, and cover them with cold water; add about half a teaspoonful of salt, put the lid on the pan, and place it on the fire; bring it slowly to the boil, and allow tlie potatoes to cook gently till they are soft. Ascertain that they are ready by running a skeAver into them, and then pour off the water; return the saucepan to the side of the fire; put the lid on again, but not quite closely, and allow all the remaining moisture to pass off in steam; when the potatoes are (piito dry, serve hot in a hot vegetiiblc dish. Place a small plate by the side of each person for the skins. Potatoes Peeled and Boiled.—Wash the potatoes well, and with a very sharp-pointed knife peel them as thinly as possible; take out the eyes, and as each potato is prepared88 mashed potatoes —fried potatoes. throw it into cold water to preserve tlie colour. Then pack the potatoes tif^htly into a saucepan, cover them with cold water; add a little salt, put the lid on the saucepan, and place it on the tire; bring it to the boil, and allow to boil very gently till the potatoes are nearly cooked. Then pour away the water, and cover the potatoes with a clean cloth; put the lid on the saucepan again, and return it to the side of the fire for about fifteen minutes, to finish cooking the potatoes, and that the moisture may be absorbed by the cloth. Serve hot in a hot vegetable dish. Potatoes that are to be boiled together should be as nearly as possible of the same size. MASHED POTATOES. Boiled potatoes. I Pepper. ' Milk. I Salt. Peel the potatoes, and pass them through a sieve, or mash them till they are free from lumps; add a jiinch of pepper j and .salt, and mi.\ them with a little milk till they are quite ] smooth; heat the mixture if necessary, and then pile it on | a hot vegetable dish. The potatoes can either be served as | they are, or they may be smoothed with a knife, and browned 1 in the oven or before the lire. | TO FRY SLICED POTATOES, POTATO RIBBONS, \ OR CHIPS.

For ribbons, cut slices half an inch thick ; and peel round and round the slice, so forming a ribbon. For chips cut thin slices into chips or straws lengthways. As the potatoes are prepared throw them into cold water, until the pot of fat is ready. Then drain and dry them by shaking them in a cloth. Put them into the fat a few at a time, and stir gently until they are a pale brown colour.

Put them into a saucepan with cold water and salt; as soon as the water boils pour it away, and dry the potatoes. Melt the butter in a frying-pan, and when it is quite hot, put in the potatoes, and fry them to a pale brown colour; then add the parsley, pepper, and salt, and toss until all are covered with parsley. Lift with a slice on to a hot dish, and serve at once. This is a favourite method of cooking potatoes in France. They should be hot and crisp. POTATOES A LA MAITEE D’HOTEL. 2 potatoes. 2 oz. butter. Lemon-juice. Chopped parsley. Pepper. Salt. This is another favourite method of dressing potatoes in France. Boil the potatoes with salt in the water, and peel them, being careful not to break them. Cut them in slices about a quarter of an inch thick. Place them in a vegetable dish, and pour over them the butter melted, and mixed with the finely-minced parsley, seasoned with salt, pepper, and lemon-juice to taste. Great care must be taken that the potatoes are not broken. Serve hot. POTATO BALLS. 1 lb. mashed potatoes. 1 oz. butter. Bread crumbs. 2 eggs. Pepper and salt. Fat for frying. Take boiled and mashed potatoes, and season them with white pepper and salt. Beat very smoothly with the butter and yolk of one egg, and fonn into round balls about an inch and a half in diameter. Dust the balls with flour, and brush them over with a beaten egg. Toss well in bread crumbs, and fry in hot fat to a pale brown colour. Drain on porous paper. Serve hot, ganiishcd with parsley. 190 KOASTED POTATOES—BAKED POTATOES—SALADS. ROASTED POTATOES. 12 potatoes. 1 Roasted Joint. Pare the potatoes, and put them raw into a flat dripping- pan, below the meat while it is roasting before the fire. Turn them so that they may be browned equally all over. Tf the meat be very fat, take out a portion of the dripping, to keep the potatoes from being greasy. Serve hot with the meat, in a separate dish. BAKED POTATOES. 6 potatoes. I 3 oz. butter. Salt. 1 Pepper. Choose potatoes all as nearly of one size as possible, Avith good clear skins; wash and dry, but do not cut them; roast them slowly in an oven, or before the fire in a Dutch oven or despatch. Turn them frequently until they feel soft on pressure. They should be nicely broivned, but not burned. Serve hot on a clean folded napkin with colil butter, pepper, and salt separately. These make an excellent supper dish when cooked properly. This may be called the natural way of cooking potatoes; it brings out the flavour of the vegetable better than any other method of cooking them. SALADS. Salad is a general name for certain vegetables prepared and eaten raw. It is very Avholesome, and may be parUvken of freely. Salad is chiefly composed of lettuce, endive, radishes, green mustard, land and water cresses, celery, and young onions. All or any of these should be as fresh as possible; but if they have to bo kept, let them lie in a dark cool place on stone or brick. When the salads are to be pre- pared, wash them well but lightly, and let them lie for a quarter of an hour in cold water containing a little vinegar. Kinse them thoroughly in fresh cold water, handling them as little as possible, and shake the water from them in a basket sold for the purpose, or failing this in a clean cloth Then place them prettily in a salad bowl; the lettuce is generally cut in pieces lengthwise, and put round the dish; the celery, also divided into four pieces, placed in the centre, or served91 DBESSED SALAD—PIES AND TARTS. in a celery glass half filled with water; and the small salads, such as cresses and radishes, are placed loosely between the other salads or on a separate disL A DRESSED SALAD, 2 lettuces. 1 endive. 1 bunch cress. 6 spring onions. 1 bunch radishes. 2 hard-boiled eggs. After the salad is well washed and shaken as above directed, cut all into small pieces, mix in a salad bowl with a salad dressing or sauce (page 67), and garnish with the hanl-boiled eggs cut in quartern, and, if liked, a little beetroot. If the salarl is not to be oaten at once, it is better to serve the sauce separately. If it is allowed to stand for more than a few hours after the sauce has been added, it becomes dark and discoloured, and in this state not only loses its fresh, crisp appearance, but is most unwholesome. PIES AND TARTS. Pies are of two kind.s—meat pies and fruit tarts, and each has its respective kinds of paste. A thorough knowledge of pastry-making is indispensable to the economical housewife and cook. To succeed in pastry-making, certain rules must bo remembered and implicitly carried out. Stand in a cool place, so that the air that is worked into the paste may be cold. The hands should bo washed very clean, and care taken to have the boai-d for working upon smooth, clean, and dry. Should this prove difficult, place a stout sheet of white paper on the board, and work over that. Handle the ingredients lightly. Use a heavy rolling-pin, but never go over the edges while rolling, as by so doing the air bubble.s, already formed in the paste, are apt to burst. A marble slab is better than a board, but few can command this, and a board is more frequently used. The flour should be of the best quality, perfectly dry and sound, and the butter, whether fre.sh or salt, free of taint, or any rankness of flavour. It is very necessary to give this direction, for92 Raised pork pie. many persons seem to imagine that butter of any kind, however bad, is good enough for paste. Dripping, when clarified, or lard, will answer as a substitute for butter, and make good paste. When no baking-powder is used, paste may be made one day, wrapped in a cold wet cloth, put aside in a cool place, and cooked next day. This gives the starch of the flour time to swell and burst before cooking, and thus the paste is rendered lighter and more easy of digestion. Great care and attention must be given in cooking the paste. When baking-powder is used too much alacrity cannot be displayed in making and baking the paste, for as soon as the flour, &c., containing the baking-powder is wetted, effervescence begins, and unless the paste comes in contact with heat while this is going on, and the paste is rising, the air will escape and the paste fall, and no amount of heat or trouble will make it rise again. The amount of success will also greatly depend upon the heat of the oven. If it is too hot, the top will become scorched before the centre is warmed. If too cold, the paste will become heavy and sodden. It is best, therefore, to keep the pastry out until the oven is of the right temperature; experience is the best guide, but a good plan is to try the heat of the oven first with a small piece of paste; the heat should be strong enough to cause the cold air in the paste to expand and so make it rise, and then set in the form given by this expansion of the air. Another test is to throw a little dry flour on to the oven shelf, if it becomes nicely browned in a few seconds the heat is good, but if it becomes charred it is too hot. Do not open the oven door for some few minutes after putting in the paste, and when you do so shut it again as gently as possible, so as not to send in a current of cold air, which would chill the paste and cau.se it to fall. i gill stock. Put the water and lard in a saucepan over the fire, and let them boil. Iilix the flour and salt in a basin, pour the RAISED PORK PIE. 1 lb. flour. 1 grill water. 1 lb. fresh lean pork. Pepper. 4 oz. lard. 1 teaspoonfUl salt. 1 teaspoonful powdered sage.AN ECONOMICAL PASTE FOR COVERING MEAT PIES. 93 boiling neater and lard into it, and mix the whole well together with a spoon. After this, turn the paste upon the board, and knead it till it is smooth and there are no cracks. Cut a piece off to form the cover, and put it in a warm place, while you mould and knead the remainder quickly with the hands into the form of an oval or round box-like mould, hollow in the centre and about half an inch thick in all parts. Bear in mind that the paste must not be allowed to get cold, or it will become hard. Have ready prepared the meat cut into small pieces, and dip each piece first into water and then into a mixture of sage, pepper, and salt to taste. Put this into the paste shape. Roll out the piece that was put aside for the top; and, after wetting the edges of the sides, place on the cover. Press it firmly round the edges to make it unite, and pare it neatly, and ornament the rim with pastry pincers or the thumb and finger. Make a hole in the centre of the top, and brush over the whole pie with a beaten egg. Roll out the trimmings thinly, cut leaves for decoration and stick them on the pie in any form you may desire. Place the pie on a floured tin, and put it into a moderately hot oven for about two hours. Raised pies need soaking heat, therefore should have rather a slow oven, as great heat would scorch the glaze and so spoil the appearance of the pie. When it is cooked, pour about half a gill of stock made from bones through a funnel into the pie, and set it aside to become cold before serving. AN ECONOMICAL PASTE FOR COVERING MEAT PIES. 6 oz. dripping. 1 teaspoonful baking- powder. 1 lb. flovir. Cold water. Salt. Rub the dripping well amongst the flour, salt, and baking- powder, with the tips of the fingers and thumbs, so as to incorporate them thoroughly, and add as much cold water as will make a thick paste. Knead it quickly on a slightly- floured board, and roll it out flat with a rolling-pin, to about half an inch in thickness. Wet the edges of the dish, and place some strips cut from the ends of the paste neatly round on the edges, as a foundation for tlie cover. Then, after94 ROUGH PUFF PASTE. putting in the meat, lay the cover on tlie dish, pressing down the edges closely to keep all tight. Make a hole in the top and trim the edges neatly. Mark round according to taste. Roll out the trimmings, cut or stamp ornaments, such as leaves, and place these as a decoration on the cover. On taking a pie from the oven, and while quite hot, brush over the top of it with a beaten egg, and return again to the oven for a few minutes to dry the glaze thus formed. ROUGH PUFF PASTE. 1 lb. flour. I Some cold water. A pinch of salt. I j ib. butter. Juice from half a lemon. Carefully rub the flour with the hand to ascertain that there are no lumps; if it feels thick and heavy pass it through a sieve. Wash the butter in cold water, then press it free from moisture in a soft cloth, put it into the flour, and break the butter, when it is covered with flour, into pieces about the size of a shilling; mix the salt with these, and add the lemon-juice with enough water to mix to a smooth paste. Make the whole of it into one ball without leaving any pieces sticking to the sides of the basin. Turn this on to a slightly-floured board, and with a good heavy rolling-pin, also slightly floured, roll the paste to the length of two feet, taking care not to let the roller fall over the edges, and lift up the paste from time to time to make sure it is not sticking to the board. Whenever any flour is sprinkled upon the board or paste, pass the hand lightly over it, so that there may be no patches of flour left on either. When the paste has been rolled to the desired length, fold it into three, as evenly as possible both at the sides and ends. Half turn it, so that the sides may become the ends, and roll again to the same length; fold again as before, and continue to roll and fold four times. If at this stage the butter should still be visible, the paste must bo rolled again. The last time let the paste be rolled rather larger than the di.sh it is to cover, and not more than half an inch thick. Tliis is a better kind of crust commonly used for meat pies.BEEFSTEAK—VEAL AND HAM—LAMB—MUTTON PIES. 95 BEEFSTEAK PIE. 1 lb. beefeteak. i teaspoonful salt.

A little lemon-juice, i lb. ham. i teaspoonful salt, i teaspoonful pepper, i gill stock or water. Cut the veal and ham into pieces not more than li*lf an inch square. Eemove the shell from the eggs, and cut each in quarters. Mi.x all these in a basin with the parsley, lemon-rind, lemon-juice, pepper, salt, and stock, so that the seasonings may be thoroughly mixed. Put all lightly into a pie-dish, raising the meat, &c., higher in the centre than at the sides. Cover with rough puff paste, and bake for more than an hour, as veal requires to be well cooked. LAMB PIE. li lb. lamb. i l gill stock. i teaspoonful salt. | i teaspoonful pepper. Take chops from the back-ribs, or slices from the leg, and lay them flat in the dish. Season wdth popper and salt, • add a little gravy or water. Cover, and bake for an hour. MUTTON PIES. 1 lb. cooked mutton. i l gill stock. 2 cooked potatoes. 1 ^ teaspoonful salt. i teaspoonful pepper. Mutton pies are sometimes made in the same manner as lamb pies, but they are greasy when made of fresh mutton.96 PIGEON—ROOK—HARE PIE. Pies made of cold meat, cut in small thin slices, mixed with cold potatoes, well seasoned with pepper, salt, and a little stock, and covered as already directed, are very good. PIGEON PIE. 2 pigeons. } lb. beefeteak. Butter. 2 hard-boiled eggs. Pepper and salt. St^k. Pick and clean the birds well. Cut off the heads, truss them by turning the wings on the back, and cut them in halves. Put a piece of butter, and a little pepper and salt, inside each half bird. Place the beef in the bottom of the dish. Lay the birds on the meat, with the gizzards, livers, and slices of hard-boiled eggs, round them. Add the stock or water. Cover. Place the legs of the pigeons with the feet upwards in a hole made in the centre of the crust of the pie. Bake for an hour and a half. . ROOK PIE. 3 rooks. I i pint melted butter. | i lb. minced beef. | Pepper and salt. i Pick and clean the birds. Cut off the heads and feet, and take out and throw away the backbones. After this steep them in cold water and salt for several hours, to extract all rankness of flavour. Season with pepper and salt, and place them in the pie-dish on a layer of minced beef. Pour over them some melted butter. Cover, and bake for three-quarters of an hour. 1 hare. 1 lb. ham. Salt. HARE PIE. 1 gill cream. Pepper. 1 quart water.

GIBLET PIE. 3 sets of giblets. i i lb. beef. 1 pint water. I Pepper and salt. Procure goose giblets, and prepare them as directed for making giblet soup. Stew them in water, jiepper, and salt, for about an hour. Take the giblets from the liquor, and let them cool. When cold, lay the beef at the bottom of the pie-dish, and the giblets above. Season with pepper and salt. Add a little flour to the liquor, and pour it in. Cover, and bake for about an hour and a half in a moderately hot oven. EEL PIE. 2 eels. 1 oz. floirr. Pepper. i pint water. 1 dessert-spoonful parsley. Salt. Skin the eels; cut off their heads, tails, and fins, and clean them. Cut them in pieces, and lay them in the pie-disli, seasoning with pepper and salt. Make a gravy to pour over them, by boiling the heads, tails, and fins in the water, pepper, and salt, for half an hour. Strain, and when cool thicken with flour, and pour it on the eels. Cover, and bake for about an hour. G98 SHORT CRUST—ICING FOR TARTS—APPLE TART. SHORT CRUST. 1 lb. flour. The yolk of 1 egg. Juice from half a lemon. 6 oz. butter. 2 oz. powdered sugar. Some cold water. This paste is generally preferred to any other for covering fruit tarts, and is considered to be the most easily digested; the butter and flour are so thoroughly mixed before any moisture is added, that when it is exposed to the heat of \ the oven, the starch cells of the flour burst, and are absorbed i by the melted butter. When the flour is perfectly dry and j free from lumps, put it into a basin with the butter, and rub 1 dexterously with the thumb and fingers until they resemble 1 bread crumbs; do not touch the butter unless covered with i the flour, or the heat of the hand will partially melt it and ; so spoil the pastry. Beat the sugar and egg together, pour i them into a hole in the centre of the flour, and then add i enough water to mix all to rather a soft paste; turn it on to a slightly floured board, handling the paste lightly, and as little as possible, and roll it out to the thickness required. ICING FOR TARTS. 1 white of an egg. | 1 oz. castor sugar. After tarts are baked, they are sometimes iced on the top, to improve their appearance. Whip the white of an egg until it is a stiff froth, then mix the sugar lightly with it. Spread some of this on the top of the tart, and then dredge white sifted sugar upon it. Keturn the tart to the oven for about ten minutes, to dry and become slightly browned. Sift sugar over it again before serving. APPLE TART. 2 lb. apples. | I lb. brown sugar. 4 cloves. I 1 table-spoonful water. Pare and take out the cores of the apples, and cut each apple into four or eight pieces, according to their size. Lay them in a pie-dish, season with the sugar and the cloves or any spice (such as cinnamon), or grated lemon-i)eoL A little quince marmalade gives a fine flavour to the pie. Add a little water, and cover with short crust; make a small hole with a skewer, just above the rim at either end.

Pick the heads and stems from unripe or hard gooseberries, and rub them with a towel to clean them. Fill the dish with them, and add the brown sugar, with a very little water. Cover, and bake for about an hour. RHUBARB TART. 6 stalks rhubarb. | i lb. s\agar. i lemon-rind. 1 i gill water. Take away the leaf, and strip off the skins from the rhubarb. Cut the stalks into pieces of an inch long. Fill the dish high in the centre, add the sugar and flavouring with the water. Khubarb tarts may be flavoured with great variety—for instance, with lemon-rind, cloves, cinna- mon, ginger, &c. Cover and bake for half an hour. Some persons stew the rhubarb before making the tart j the advantage of this is, that more can be put into the dish, for it shrinks considerably in cooking. CRANBERRY TART. i lb. cranberries. 1 4 apples. 6 table-spoonfUls sugar. ] J lb. prunes. Wash the cranberries, and pick them from the stalks; peel, core, and slice the apples; stone and wash the prunes; put all these with the sugar into a saucepan, and stew them till soft, or for about half an hour. Put tlie mixture into the pie-dish, and allow it to cool. Cover with short crust, and bake for about half an hour. FLAKY PASTE. 10 oz. flour. Whites of 2 eggs. A little lemon-juice. 0 oz. butter. A pinch of salt. Cold water. For this paste, secure dry and fine flour, and pass it through a sieve before using. Boat the whites of egg to a stiff froth100 MINCE-PIES—OPEN TARTS. with the salt. The easiest method of doing this is to put them upon a clean plate, and to beat them with a broad long knife quickly. Pour these on to the flour, and with the addition of a little water form a soft paste; turn it on to a floured board, and knead lightly until smooth. Wash the butter in cold water, wring it in a cloth, and then divide it into six parts. Eoll the paste about sixteen inches long, then put on one-sixth of the butter in small dabs, fold in three, half turn it, and roll again.; add another portion of the butter, fold, half turn, and roll again; and so on until all the butter is rolled in. At the seventh time of rolling, sprinkle over the paste a little lemon-juice, fold it again, and roll to whatever size and thickness you may require. This paste is generally used for mince-pies, patties, fish pies, &c. MINCE-PIES. 1 lb. beef suet. 1 lb. sultanas, li lb. apples. 4 lemons. 2 nutmegs. i teaspoonfUl cinnamon, li lb. brown sugar. 1 teaspoonful salt. 1 lb. raisins. 1 lb. currants. 1 lb. figs, i lb. almonds. 1 teaspoonful allspice, i teaspoonful ground ginger. 1 gill rum. 1 gill brandy. 1 lb. candied peel. Mince the suet, stone and chop the raisins, chop the sultanas, clean the currants, peel and chop the apples, chop the figs, cut the candied peel into small pieces, blanch and pound the almonds, grate the lemon-rind, squeeze the juice free from pips, and grate the nutmeg. Mix all the ingredients well together; then put the mince-meat into a jar, cover it, and keep it for at least one month before using. Cut a round of paste; wet it round the edges, place a spoonful of mince- meat in the centre, and cover with another round of paste. Make a hole in the top with a skewer, and bake in a hot oven to a pale-brown colour. Sift powdered sugar over the pies while hot OPEN TARTS. Tliese are tarts without covers, made in flat dishes.

I i lb. fresh butter. Lemon-juice. This paste is more extravagant than those given before, and is seldom used except where a very light rich paste is required, as for oyster patties, &c. Pass the flour through a hair-sieve, and dry it; put it into a basin; add the juice of half a lemon strained, and enough cold water to mix to a damp paste; turn the paste on to a floured board, and work it heavily with the palms of the hands till it is quite smooth; then flour a heavy rolling-pin, and roll it out in any direction to about a quarter of an inch in thickness. Take the butter, put it into a clean, soft cloth, and press all the moisture from it; lay it in the middle of the paste, and cover it over tightly so as to seal the butter into the paste; then roll it out to about half a yard in length, being careful not to roll over the edges or to let the butter appear. Fold the paste evenly in three, place it on a floured paper or sieve, and put it aside in a very cool place for fifteen minutes; then bring it to the board again, and roll it102 OYSTER PATTIES—PUDDINGS, CUSTARDS, JELUES. twice in the same manner, folding each time in three, and turning it half-way round; put it aside for fifteen minutes, and then give it two more turns; put it away for fifteen minutes, and, finally, give it two more turns, making seven turns in all. After rolling it for the seventh time, rub it over with a little lemon-juice, fold it evenly in three, let it stand for a few seconds, and then roll it to the size and thick- ness required. OYSTER PATTIES. 1 oz. butter. 1 oz. flour. 2 dozen oysters with their liquor. Salt. Cayenne pepper. The juice of half a lemon. 1 table-spoonful cream. Puff paste. Roll the paste to half an inch in thickness, cut it in rounds about three inches in diameter, mark on the tops with a smaller round, and bake in a brisk oven. Melt the butter in a saucepan; add to it the flour, and when these are thoroughly mixed, pour on to them the liquor from the oysters, and enough milk to make up a gill; stir till they boil, and the flour is thoroughly cooked. Beard the oysters; cut them in halves, and add them to the contents of the saucepan, with salt, Cayenne pepper, and lemon-juice to taste ; lastly add the cream and mix well. Take the patty-cases, remove the small rounds from the top, and take out all the loose paste from the inside, leaving the cases hollow; fill them with the oyster mixture; put the lids on again, and serve hot on a hot dish Avith a folded napkin on it; garnish with curled parsley. PUDDIJfGS, CUSTARDS, JELLIES, &c. Care should be taken in making puddings to have the suet and eggs perfectly fresh. After cutting the suet into slices, and picking it free from fibrous matter, chop and roll it Avell —indeed, so thoroughly that it may be so incorporated with the flour as to bo invisible. Break each egg separately in a tea-cup, for one bad egg would spoil all in the dish, ihe cloths used for puddings should bo tolerably fine. Let them103 PLUM PUDDING CURRANT PUDDING. be carefully washed after using, and laid by in a dry state, ready for the next occasion. Before putting the pudding into the cloth, dip the cloth in boiling water, wring it, spread it over a basin, and dredge it with flour; then put in the pudding, gather up the corners of the cloth, and tie it, leaving a little room for the pudding to swell. Every pudding should be boiled in plenty of water, so as to allow it room to move freely, and it must be kept constantly boiling, and covered with water. It is a general saying that a pudding cannot he too well boiled, and it is certain that there is much more danger of boiling it too short than too long a time. When preferred, the pudding may be boiled in a basin. The basin should be first w’ell greased, and after the pudding is put in, a floured cloth must be tied over it to keep the water out; then plunge the pudding into a pan of boiling water, and boil as above directed. When the pudding is taken from the pot, let it stand for a few seconds, remove the cloth, and lay the face of the dish upon the pudding; turn the whole upside down, lift off the basin, and leave the pudding standing. i lb. suet, i lb. raisins, i lb. cvirrants.

Chop the suet finely, stone the raisins, clean and pick the currants, blanch and chop the almonds, cut the candied peel in thin shreds, peel, core, and chop the apples. Mix all very well together. Turn into a well-greased basin, cover with a cloth, and boil for four hours. Servo with brandy or sweet sauce. CURRANT PUDDING. i lb. suet. 4 lb. bread crumbs. 4 lb. flour. Milk. } lb. currants. Cinnamon. Nutmeg. Salt. ]Mix the minced suet with the bread crumbs, the flour, the currants washed and picked, a little powdered cinnamon,104 SUET DUMPLINGS—BREAD PUDDING. grated nutmeg, and a very little salt. Add as much milk as will make a soft dough. Beat all together, tie in a cloth prepared as directed, and boil for three hours. Serve with caudle, or any simple sweet sauce. SUET OR PLAIN DUMPLINGS. 1 lb. flour. I 1 teaspoonful salt, i lb. suet. I Water. These are sometimes served with boiled salt beef. Mince the suet very fine; mix it with the flour and salt; and moisten with water to the consistency of dough. Divide it into ten pieces, and roll them into round dumplings, put them into boiling water, and boil for an hour and a half, taking care that they do not stick to the bottom of the pot. To prevent this, a plate may be placed in the pot. BREAD PUDDING. I 2 cupfuls stale bread. 2 oz. butter or minced suet. 3 oz. sugar. Cinnamon. Boil the milk, and pour it over the broken bread in a basin. Cover it for ten or fifteen minutes, to allow the bread to swell. Then bejit or mash it up to make a fine pulp, and stir in the suet or butter. Beat the eggs, with a little cinnamon, grated lemon-peel, and sugar to taste. Stir all together; and add the candied peel cut into small pieces, and the currants cleaned ami picked. The pudding may be either steamed or baked. If to be steamed, put it in a well-buttered pudding shape or basin, with a buttered paper fastened over it. Put the basin in a saucepan with boiling water to come about three parts up the basin ; put a tightly-fitting lid on the pan, and let the water boil around the pudding for an hour, adding more water if required, but do not let the water cover the basin. Servo with sweet sauce. If to be baked, put the pudding into a buttered baking-dish, and bake in an oven for about half an hour. Sift sugar over it, and serve hot or cold. 1 pint milk. 2 eggs. i lb. currants. 1 lb. candied peel.105 RICE—CUSTARD—BREAD AND BUTTER PUDDING, RICE PUDDING. 2 oz. rice. 1 pint milk. 1 oz. butter or suet. 1 oz. sugar. 2 eggs. Cinnamon or nutmeg. AVosh the rice. Put it into a saucepan, with enough cold water to cover it; place the pan over the fire, and as soon as the water boils pour on the milk. Stir frequently to prevent burning, and boil until the rice is quite soft. Then put it into a basin, stir in the butter, or the suet minced. AA'hen cool, add the eggs beaten, with a little ground cinnamon, grated nutmeg or lemon, and sugar. Mix well together. It may be either steamed or baked, as directed for bread pudding. CUSTARD PUDDING. 4 eggs. I 2 oz. sugar, i pint milk. I 1 oz. butter. A little grated nutmeg. Take the yolks of four and the whites of two eggs, beat them well with the sugar and seasonings, and pour on the milk, stirring all the time. The pudding may be either baked or steamed. If steamed, it will require half an hour; if baked, about twenty minutes in a moderately hot oven, and the dish must not be moved after it is put into the oven, until the eggs are set, or the custard is apt to become curdled. BREAD AND BUTTER PUDDING. 4 slices bread and butter, 1 pint milk, i lb. currants. 3 eggs. 2 oz. sugar. Cinnamon. Butter a pudding-dish, and put in a layer of bread and butter, then one of currants; then another layer of bread and butter, and another of currants, and so on till the dish is three parts full. Beat the eggs, with a little ground cinna- mon or nutmeg, and some sugar. Add the milk to this, pour it over the bread, and allow it to stand for a time to soak. It will now be ready to be either baked or steamed, as directed for bread puddings.TAPIOCA—SAGO—BATTER—PEAS PUDDING. 106 TAPIOCA PUDDING—SAGO PUDDING. I lb. tapioca. 1 quart milk, i pint water. 3 eggrs. 2 oz. sugar. 2 oz. butter. Put the tapioca into a basin with the water, and let it stand for some hours to swell. Add the milk, and put all into a saucepan over the fire to boil slowly for about an hour. Stir it frequently, and be careful that it does not burn. Then pour it into a basin, stir into it the butter and eggs well beaten; pour it into a buttered pudding-dish, and bake for about half an hour; or, after adding another egg, steam it in a basin or mould for an hour. Sago pudding may be made in the same manner. BATTER OR YORKSHIRE PUDDING. i lb. flour. I 2 eggs. 1 pint milk. I Salt. Put the flour and salt into a basin, add to it half the milk, and mix very smoothly, then add the eggs, and mix all well together. Pour on the rest of the milk, and let it stand for half an hour. Grease a deep baking-tin with dripping from the meat, and pour the batter into it. Place the tin either under roasting meat before the fire, or in the oven. When done, turn the pudding into a dish to be carried to table. The usual custom is to cut the pudding in squares. It should have a nicely-browned appearance. When it is cooked before the fire, either turn the pudding, or place the tin for a short time over the fire, or in the oven, to brown the mrder side. PEAS PUDDING. i lb. split peas. i A pinch of sugar. 1 egg. 1 1 oz. butter. Pepper and salt. Eemove all discoloured peas or shells. AVash the peas and tie them loosely in a cloth, leaving j)lenty of room for them to swell. Boil them for about an hour, till they are soft. Take the pudding from the water and put it into a basin; drain away all the water. Open the cloth, and bruise or mash the peas very smoothly with the butter, pepper, salt, sugar, and beaten egg. Then tie it up tightly in a clean cloth,SUET CRUST—BEEFSTEAK AND KIDNEY PUDDING. 107 put it into a pan of boiling water, and boil for half an hour. When it is ready to serve, turn it out of the cloth into a vegetable dish. SUET CRUST. 1 lb. flour. I i lb. suet. J teaspoonful salt. I About IJ gill water. This crust is generally used for boiled puddings. Remove all skin and fibre from the suet, and chop it very finely (sometimes a little flour sprinkled over the suet will aid in speedy chopping). Mix this thoroughly with the flour and salt in a basin, and add enough water to form a stiff paste; work them together with the hand, and turn the paste out of the basin neatly in one lump on to a floured board; roll out once with a floured rolling-pin to the thickness required. This crust may be made with half a pound of flour and half a pound of fine bread crumbs, instead of using all flour, and it is then considered by some people to bo much lighter and more digestible. BEEFSTEAK AND KIDNEY PUDDING. Suet crust. 1 table-spoonful flour. 1 teaspoonful salt. 1 gill stock or water. i teaspoonful pepper. 1 lb. good stewing steak, i ox kidney. Grease a pudding-bowl with dripping. Roll out the suet crust to half an inch in thickness, line the bowl with this, cut off the edges with a sharp knife, and roll out the trimmings to the size of the top for a cover. Flatten the steak, and cut it into strips about three inches long and one broad; divide the fat into small pieces. Remove all skin and fat from the kidney, and cut it into dice. Llix the flour, salt, and pepper on a plate or piece of paper, toss each piece of steak in this, lay upon it one piece of fat and one piece of kidney, and roll it up; put each roll as it is ready into the pudding, and when all are prepared pour over them the cold water or stock. Wet the edges of the lining, and cover with the paste already prepared. Press the edges very tightly together to prevent the gravy from escaping while the pudding is cooking. Dip a pudcUng-cloth into boiling water, flour the centre of it where it will be in contact with the pudding.108 FRITIT PUDDING—ROLEV-POLEY. place it over the basin, and tie it with a piece of string about half-way down the basin; lift the cloth to ascertain that it is firm, and tie the opposite corners over the bowl to form a handle. Plunge the pudding into a saucepan of boiling water with a little salt in it, and let it boil for three hours. Take care that the pudding is kept covered with boiling water. A good plan is to have a kettle full in readiness to replenish the water as it evaporates. When the pudding is ready, lift it from the saucepan and let it stand for two or three minutes. Remove the cloth carefully in case it shordd stick to the pudding. Reverse the bowl on a hot dish, and lift the basin slowly off, and serve hot. This pudding may be varied in the seasonings used; for example, an onion parboiled and finely minced, mushrooms, parsley, or a little ketchup may be added, or a few oysters may be substituted for the kidney. FRUIT PUDDING. Rhubarb, gooseberry, apple, or any boiled fruit pudding may be made according to the directions in the preceding receipt, using prepared fruit, with sugar to taste, in place of meat and seasonings. ROLEY-POLEY. Suet crust. 1 Jam. This favourite pudding is made with suet crust prepared as above directed, and rolled out to an oblong shape, rather thinly. Wet the paste round the edges, and spread evenly upon it some jam, stewed fruit, or minced and seasoned cold meat, to within half an inch of the edges; roll it up, pressing the edges well together, and roll it firmly into a pudding-cloth wdiich has been dipped into boiling w'ater and floured. Tie each end Avith string, and cook in boiling water, with a little salt in it, for two hours or more according to the size of the pudding. Lift the lid from the saucepan, and move the pudding occasionally to prevent its sticking to the bottom; or else place an old plate or saucer in the pan. Be sure that the pudding is kept covered with boiling water the whole time it is cooking.109 SEA-PIE—BISCUIT—TREACLE PUDDING. J lb. beefeteak. 1 carrot. 2 onions. J teaspoonful salt, i teaspoonful pepper. SEA-PIE. i teaspoonful baking- powder, i turnip, i lb. flour, i lb. suet. Water. Cut the steak in small pieces, and lay it in the bottom of a stew-pan. Add the vegetables, cut in slices; season with salt and pepper. Pour in half a pint of cold Avater. Cover, and let heat while the crust is being prepared. Make a stiff paste with the flour, suet, baking-powder, salt, and as little water as possible. Poll out exactly the size of the steAv-pan. Fit closely above the vegetables. Simmer for tAvo hours, keeping the lid of the pan closed. Serve the meat and vege- tables in a hot dish, pour the gravy over, and lay the crust cut into four pieces on top. BISCUIT PUDDING. 1 cupful broken biscuit or cake. i pint milk. 2 eggs. 1 oz. butter. Sugar to taste. Frequently there is an accumulation of biscuits and cakes in the house. The Avhole of these, provided they are not musty, may be made into light puddings. Break the cakes into a basin, and pour the boiling milk on them. SAveeton and flavour to taste. "When cool, add the beaten eggs. Put into a shape, and steam for half an hour. When ready, turn the pudding into a dish, and pour SAveet sauce around it. Serve hot. TREACLE PUDDING. i lb. bread crumbs, i lb. flour. 4 lb. suet. 1 teaspoonful ground ginger. 4 lb. treacle. 4 teaspoonful carbonate of soda. 4 teaspoonful salt. 2 eggrs. Chop the suet finely, beat the eggs, Avarm the treacle, and mix all the ingredients to the consistency of porridge. Butter and paper a shape, pour the pudding into it, cover Avith a buttered paper, and steam for aliout tAvo hours.110 RICE RISSOLES—MACARONI PUDDING. This makes an excellent cake, if put into a well-buttered tin shape, and baked for two hours in a slow oven. RICE RISSOLES. 1 lb. rice. 1 oz. butter. Cinnamon. Pat for frying. 1 pint milk. 2 oz. sugar. 2 eggs. Bread crumbs. Wash the rice and boil it in the milk. Stir frequently to prevent burning. ’Wlien the rice is soft, stir in the butter, sugar, cinnamon, and the yolk of one egg. Cook over the fire for a few minutes, then turn on a plate to cool. Koll small portions into a round shape, like a sausage. When quite smooth and free from cracks dip each rissole into a beaten egg, then toss it in bread crumbs until thoroughly covered, and fry in hot fat for about three minutes to a pale- brown colour. Drain on porous paper. Serve hot on a folded napkin, or clean dish paper. Sweet sauce, made with one table-spoonful of raspberry or currant jelly, dissolved in half a gill of hot water, may be served separately. MACARONI PUDDING. 2 oz. macaroni. 1 pint milk. A little nutmeg. 2 eggs. 2 oz. sugar. 1 oz. butter. Wash and break the macaroni in small pieces, put it into a saucepan with hot water and salt to cover it, and boil for ten minutes. Pour off tlie water, add the milk and cook slowly until the macaroni is tender. Add tlie butter and sugar, and turn it into a basin to cool, lieat the eggs to a stilF froth. Mix all thorouglily, and put it into a greased pie-dish. Grate a little nutmeg over the top, and bake in a moderately hot oven for about twenty minutes, to a pale- brown colour. This may be served hot or cold. Macaroni boiled in milk, with a little sugar, and thickened with an egg, makes a nice and simple pudding. When merolj" boiled in milk, and placed in a tin shape like a ring, it forms a pretty boundary to hashed meat or mince of any kind.Ill SEMOl.INA—FIG PUDDING—APPLE CHARLOTTE. SEMOLINA PUDDING. 1 lb. semolina, oz. sugar. 2 eggrs. li pints milk. J oz. butter. Flavouring. Loil milk in a saucepan; add the semolina, and boil for five minutes, stirring constantly; put in the sugar and butter, and mi.x^ the whole. Let these ingredients stand in the sauce- pan to cool, beat up the eggs, and stir them amongst the semolina, adding a flavouring of orange or lemon. Pour the pudding into a buttered mould, cover it with a buttered paper, and steam for an hour. Ground Kice may be treated in the same way. FIG PUDDING. i lb. figs. 1 lb. apples. J lb. suet. 2 eggs. 1 oz. flour. 6 oz. sugar. 6 oz. bread crumbs, i teaspoonful salt, i teaspoonful nutmeg. A little milk. Chop finely the figs, the apples pared and cored, and the suet. Mix these with the sugar, bread crumbs, flour, salt, and nutmeg; beat the eggs until light, add them with enough milk to moisten the other ingi’edients; press the mixture into a buttered shape, and boil for four hours. Serve hot with sweet sauce. APPLE CHARLOTTE. 2 lb. apples, i lb. sugar. 1 lemon. 1 gill water. Thin bread. Butter. Take good cooking apples; peel, slice, core, and place them in a stew-pan with the sugar, water, and the rind of the lemon, and stir until boiling; let them simmer for an hour or so, until they are reduced to about one half the quantity. Remove the stew-pan from the fire and take out the lemon- rind. Kow take a thin slice of the crumb of bread, and cut it into quarters. Dip these pieces in melted butter, and put them at the bottom of a tin mould. Lino the sides of the mould inside with thin bread dipped into the melted butter. Put the apples in the centre of the mould, and cover with a round of bread dipped in butter. Bake in a hot oven until the bread is brown and crisp. Turn the charlotte out on to a hot dish, and serve hot.112 BOILED CUSTARD—CALF’s-FOOT JELLT. BOILED CUSTARD. i pint milk. j 3 eggs, i S'tick cinn&tXxion. 1 i oz, svl^qj*. Boil tlie milk, cinnamon, and sugar together. Beat the yolks of three eggs with the white of one, and strain them into another dish. Wlien the milk boils, take it off the fire, and pour it on to the eggs, stirring all the time. Return these to the saucepan, and set it on the fire, stirring constantly until the custard thickens, then turn it immediately into a basin, and stir until it is cool and thick. When time permits, the milk, eggs, &c., may be put into a jug or jar placed in a saucepan of hot water over the fire, and the contents of the jar stirred until thick; then the jar should be taken from the hot water, and the custard stirred until it is nearly cold. When it is ready it should be of the consistency of thick cream. Pour it into custard glasses. When they are filled, grate a little nutmeg over them. STOCK FOR CALF’S-FOOT JELLY. Take two calf’s feet, break them in pieces and cut between the toes. Wash them well, and put them into a saucepan ■with sufficient cold water to cover them; let it boil, then throw away the water; wash the feet again, and scrape them. Return them to a clean saucepan with five |)ints of cold water; put it on the fire, bring it to the boil, and let it simmer very gently for six or seven hours, or until the water is reduced to half the quantity, skimming constantly. Then strain the stock into a basin, and set it aside to get quite cold. Add more water to the bones, and boil again for three or four hours to make second stock. One ox foot may be used instead of two calfs feet, and must be treated in exactly the same way. CALFS-FOOT JELLY. 2i pints stock. 4 oz. loaf-sugar. 5 lemons. Whites and shells of 2 eggs. 1 glass sherry or i glass brandy. When the stock is quite cold, remove all the fat with iron spoons dipped in hot water; then dip a soft cloth in hot113 BI.ANC-MANQE. water, and wipe the top of the stock with it. Put into a saucepan the stock with the sugar, tlie yellow rind .and the juice of the lemons, carefully keej)ing back the white pith and the pips. Then wa.sh the eggs, and atld to the stock, &c., the whites and shells. Place the saucepan over the fire, and whisk briskly till a froth is formed on the top. Remove the whisk, and let the jelly boil. Move the pan carefully and steadily to the side of the fire, and .allow it to stand quite still with the lid on for twenty minutes. Reverse a kitchen chair on a table near the fire, and out of any draught, cover the four legs with a clean linen cloth of a loose make, and tie it securely round each leg. When the jelly has stood for twenty minutes, pour boiling water through the cloth two or three times; take the Avater away; put a heated basin under the cloth, and pour the jelly quickly into the cloth; remove the first basin, put another underneath, and return the jelly in the first basin to the cloth. Repeat this till the jelly passes through clear, which it will generally do the second or third time. When the jelly has all passed through, add the sherry or brandy. Have a moulil standing filled Avith cold Avater; pour aAvay the water and pour in the jelly; let it stand in a cool place till it sets, Avhich Avill be in about ten hours unless it is put on ice, Avhen a much shorter time Avill suffice. To turn out the jelly, dip the mould into tepid water, reverse it on a crystal dish, sh.ake it, and remove the moidd. In hot Avoather, the .stock must be boiled for an hour longer, or half an ounce of gelatin may be added Avhen the jelly is made. Put the milk, or cre.am, with the isinglass, lemon-rind, and sugar, into a saucepan. Stir over the fire until the isinglass is dissolved. Take the skins off the almonds and pound them to a p.astc Avith a little or.ange-floAver Avater. Mix this Avith the milk, and strain through a sieve. I^et it settle, and then pour it into the mould, previously dipped into cold BLANC-MANGE. 1 pint milk or bream. 1 oz. Isinglass. 12 sweet almonds. 2 oz. loaf-sugar. 3 bitter almonds. 1 lemon (rind only}.114 ARROWROOT—RICE—MOSS BLANO-MANGE. water, keeping back the sediment. Turn out when cold, as directed for calfs-foot jelly. ARROWROOT BLANC MANGE. 1 quart milk, I 3 table-spoonfuls arrowroot. 2 oz. sugrar. I Nutmeg or lemon. This is a jelly closely resembling the above, and is made with much less trouble. Put a pint and a half of milk into a saucepan, with the sugar and seasoning. Mix the arrow- root smoothly with the half-pint of milk. When the milk on the fire boils, pour in the arrowroot, stirring quickly. It will become thick immediately. Let it boil for two or three minutes. Wet the mould with cold milk, and pour the arrowroot into it. Let it stand till cold, and turn out as directed for calf’s-foot jelly. Oswego, which makes a good blanc-mange, should be treated in a similar manner. RICE BLANC MANGE. i lb. lice. I 1 pint milk. 1 oz. sugar. I Cinnamon. Wash the rice, and boil it in milk till quite soft, stirring frequently to prevent burning. Sweeten and season to taste. Pour into a previously wetted mould, and, when cold, turn out as directed for calf’s-foot jelly. It may be garnished with red or black currant jelly. MOSS BLANC MANGE. 1 oz. moss. I IJ pint milk. 2 oz. sugar. I Cinnamon. There is a moss of a peculiar kind, found on the seashores of Iceland, Ireland, and other places, which is of a glutinous nature like isinglass, and, when boiled in milk, forms a nice smooth white jelly. The moss is called Iceland or Carrageen Moss; it is sold by druggists and grocers, and resembles dried seaweed of a yellowish colour. Pick all gritty or sandy particles from the moss, and soak it in cold water for about twelve hours, drain it, and place it in a saucepan on the fire with the milk. Let it boil for half an hour, stirring occasionally, to prevent its burning. Sweeten to taste,115 GOOSEBERRY FOOL—TRIFLE. and flavour with cinnamon or any other spice. When the moss is dissolved, leaving nothing but a few thready fibres, strain it through a sieve into a mould. When cold, it will turn out easily, and have all the appearance of a firm blanc- mange. It is inexpensive, and is also agreeable to the palate, and very nutritious. GOOSEBERRY FOOL. 1 quart unripe gooseberries. I i lb. sugar. 1 cupftil water. I J pint cream. This is a simple way of preparing gooseberries, and very wholesome for children. Take full-grown unripe gooseberries. Top and tail them, and put them into a saucepan with the water. Cover them, and let them heat very slowly. AVhen the gooseberries are soft, but not broken, strain the water from them, put them in a dish and bruise them to a fine pulp, with sufficient sugar to sweeten. Let them stand till cold, and then mix the cream with them. Serve in a hash- dish, or large bowl. TRIFLE. 1 pint cream. 1 lemon (juice only). 12 ratafia biscuits. Raspberry jam. Nutmeg. 0 penny sponge-cakes. 1 gill sherry. 1 pint boiled custard. 3 oz. sifted sugar. 2 oz. candied peel. Take the cream, and put it in a basin, with the sugar and lemon-juice, ^^’hisk them well, and as the froth rises, lift it off with a flat spoon or fish-slice, and lay it in an unbroken state on the bottom of a hair-sieve turned up. Set a plate below to catch the drip from it. Continue to whisk till no more froth rises. This should be done a few hours before the cream is to be used. Next, place in a trifle bowl the sponge-cakes, grated nutmeg, and candied lemon-peel cut small. Upon these spread some raspberry jam, then pour in the wine and let it stand for a short time to soak the cakes, then pour over all the custard. It is now ready for the froth to bo piled neatly on the top. Garnish the edge with the ratafia biscuits, and the top with some thin shreds of candied peel or some pink crystallised sugar.116 JAM-MAKING. JAM-MAKING. Home-made jam, when properly and carefully prepared, is much cheaper and superior to that Avhicli is offered for sale. AVhen making jams or preserves, great care and attention must bo given to carrying out the following rules. (1) Let the fruit be sound, dry, free from dust, and if possible gathered under a morning sun. (2) Preserve the fruit upon the same day that it is gathered, and as soon after gathering as convenient. (3) Let the sugar be of the finest quality, whether white or brown. Good loaf-sugar, or the large crystallised white sugar, we consider the best for delicate fruits sucli as strawberries, apricots, &c., and for making syrups, but the raw brown sugar may be used for ordinary jam. Sugar tliat is extracted from the beetroot and other vegetables does not easily solidify, and so frequently causes jam made with it to ferment. There is no economy in using infeiior sugar: it throws up a great deal of scum, which has to Ije removed, and a large proportion of the jam is thus wasted. (4) Never stir with iron or pewter spoons, as they are liable to spoil tlie colour of the fruit; use a wooden spoon or spatula for the purpose. (5) If you do not possess a brass preserving pan, sub- stitute a porcelain-lined saucepan, but do not use an iron or tin-lined pan. Take care tliat the pan is scrupulously clean. Do not let it rest immediately on the fire, but fix it at least two inches above; the fruit and sugar are very apt to burn when close to the fire. (6) Skim away all froth as it rises, and continue to do this until no more comes. (7) If you wish to preserve the colour and flavour of the fniit, boil quickly and stir almost constantly, until the syrup will solidify when a little is dropped upon a cold jilate. Then pour the jam at once into dry and sound jars, and set it aside for twenty-four hours to become cold and firm.117 GOOSEBERRY—RASPBERRY JAM—CURRANT JELLY. (8) Cut some rounds of tissue-paper a size Ifirger than the jars, dip each piece into good sweet oil, and place it imme- diately on the top of the jam, or cut some writing-paper in the same manner, dip it into brandy and cover the jam with this; then securely fix c»ver the mouth of the jar some gummed paper to keep out the air. Store in a dry and cool place; if it is the least damp the jam will turn mouldy. By careful attention to these rules, jam may be kept good for any length of time. GOOSEBERRY J.AM. 6 lb. gooseberries. | 6 lb. preserving sugar. Pick, top, and tail red gooseberries, thoroughly ripe. Boil them for twenty minutes, skimming frequently as required. Add the sugar. Boil for half an hour after the sugar is added. Skim well, and pour hot into earthenware jars. Cover and store as directed. If it be wished that the goose- berries should remain whole, dissolve the sugar in a little water or currant juice, and as soon as the sugar is melted and clear, put in the gooseberries. Shake the pan to prevent the jam burning. If it is stirred, the fruit may break. RASPBERRY, STRAWBERRY, BLACK CURRANT, AND APRICOT JAMS. These are made in the same maimer as gooseberry jam. For a[)ricot jam, take out the stones, crack them, return the kernels; do not remove the skins from the apricots. RED, WHITE, OR BLACK CURRANT JELLY. 3 pints fruit-juice. | 3 lb. sugar. Pick the fruit free from all stems. Put it in a pan over the fire, and when hot, take it off 3 bruise the fruit and strain the juice through a hair-sieve, letting it drip till the fruit is dry, but not pressing it in any way. Beturn the juice to the saucepan, and for every pint allow a iiound of lump sugar. Let it boil for twenty minutes, skimming it when necessary. If the fruit has been gathered in rather a wet state, it must boil half an hour longer, or perhaps even more. Pour it into jars, and cover as directed when cold.118 ROWAN JELLY—ORANGE MARMALADE—APPLE JELLY. MOUNTAIN-ASH BERRY OR ROWAN JELLY. 6 pints liquid ft'om the i 6 lb. lump sugar. berries. 1 The mountain-ash berry, called in Scotland the rowan berry, makes an excellent jelly which, being a little bitter, may be eaten with game. The berries should be gathered when red, but not too ripe. Wash them well, and put them into a preserving pan, with cold water sufficient to cover them. Boil till the water is red, and the berries soft. Strain the liquor from the berries through a hair-sieve or jelly-cloth. Throw away the pulp and return the juice to the pan with the sugar. Now boil fast for half an hour, skimming thoroughly. Pour hot into the jars, cover and store like jam. ORANGE MARMALADE. 8 lb. bitter oranges. | 8 lb. Imnp sugar. Pare off the yellow skins of the oranges, taking as little of the white skin beneath as possible. Cut the parings into small strips or chips, and then across again, which will make them still smaller. Put them in a pan, with as much water as will cover them. Boil until quite soft, strain the water through a sieve, and lay the chips aside. Next, quarter the oranges, scrape out the pulp and juice into a di.sh, throwing away the white skins, films, and seeds. Put the pulp, juice, and chips into the pan, with the sugar, and stir until boiling. Let boil for half an hour; skim thoroughly, and pour the marmalade into jars. When cold, paper the jars, and set aside for use. The above is called chip marmalade; when the marmalade is wanted smooth, the skins must he boiled and then pounded, instead of being cut into chips. Some people add the juice and pulp of sweet oranges, to give mildness to the marmalade. APPLE JELLY. 6 pints apple-juice. | 6 lb. lump sugar. 0 lemons. Wash, dry, and slice the apples.

Put tho juice and sugar into the preserving pan and boil it ibr twenty minutes, skimming as required. The juice and rind of one lemon to every pint of juice may bo added with the sugar, when tho apples are not very good. HINTS TO NURSES, AND INVALID COOKERY. Tlie preparation and cooking of food sliould bo thoroughly understood by a good nurse, so that should any dish bo sent from tho kitchen imperfectly prepared, directions may bo given as to how this can bo remedied. Food should never bo prepared or cooked before a patient. Invalids’ food and tho manner of giving it is most important, and this latter depart- ment falls exclusively to the nurse. Endeavour to give tho food most appreciated by the sufferer (when not injurious), and present it in a kind and sympathetic manner; offer only a small portion at a time, and in a scrupulously clean vessel, so that it may appear tempting, and when the patient has partaken of as much as ho is able, let the dishes be at once removed from the room. Do not let the patient see you taste the food which is to be given to him, and never take your own meals before a patient. Keep all food out of tho sick room, but close at hand. Be especially careful not to use milk that has stood in the room, or by the side of an invalid, for milk quickly absorbs any impure germs that may be floating in the atmosphere. Assume a quiet and cheerful manner at all times before your patient. Many diseases are controlled more by diet than medicine, and frequently tho doctor in attendance, imagining that you know how to prepare all foods, gives his orders, and leaves the patient in your hand.s. Should a patient then bo injudiciously fed, neither nursing nor medicine can remedy the ill effects. The effects of food tell on the body and on the blood; therefore what is to be aimed at in sickness is to obtain tho largest amount of nourishment with the least trouble to the patient. This in acute cases can be most safely supplied and easily digested in a liquid form. Get exact and minute instructions from120 BEEF-TEA. the doctor as to the kind and quantity of food to bo adininis- terctl, or in mistaken kindness you may occasion much suifer- ing and increased illness. Ascertain whether food or sleep is more important; act strictly according to instructions, and give food, like medicine, at regular intervals, for much may depend upon the nourishment being given at the right time. BEEF-TEA. 1 lb. lean beef. | 1 pint cold water, i teaspoonful salt. Choose freshly-killed beef, for after it has been hung the meat becomes dry and will not yield so much juice. Eemove all skin and fat, and cut the beef into small pieces. If you have plenty of time at your disposal, a still better plan is to scrape or shred the beef; this breaks it more tlioroughly down and allows the water to mix better with it, but as it takes a long time it is not generally adopted. Have a stone jar with a tight-fitting lid; into it put the beef with the water and salt; cover it, and set it aside for ten minutes. This soaking in cold water and salt helps to draw out the juices. As soon as it has stood for a sufficient time, place the jar in a saucepan with water boiling around it, and allow it to cook thus for one hour. If the water in the pan boils away, add more. The rea.son the beef-tea is put into a jar and not into the pan itself is to prevent it boiling. Beef- tea .should be cooked at a temperature of about 170 degrees Fahrenheit. When the beef-tea has been cooking for half an hour, open the jar, and witli two forks separate the beef, Avhich is apt to cake into lumps, re-cover the jar, and return it to the saucepan. When the tea is sufficiently cooked, pour it off from the meat; do not strain it through a fine strainer, as that Avould keep back the sediment, Avhich is a valuable part of the tea. I’our the tea into a basin, pressing the meat Avith the back of a spoon so as to get out all the juice. If there is a suspicion of any fat floating on the top, remove it Avith porous paper, or better still, let the tea get cold, and remove the fat Avith a heated spoon. Serve hot, Avith thin dry toast cut into small dice upon a so]mrato plate, and only three parts fill the cup in case any should spill over.121 BEEF ESSENCE—BEEF'-TEA—INVALIDS* SOUP.

Cut the meat into very small pieces, sprinkle the salt well over it, put it into a jar, and cover the jar with a lid, or unporous paper, such as writing-paper, or greased kitchen paper, and place it in a saucepan of boiling water or a moderately hot oven for about live or six hours; then press the beef, pour olf the liquid, remove the fat with a piece of porous paper, and serve a teaspoonful at a time. To hurry the process of preparation a table-spoonful of Avater may bo poured over the beef, Avhen two hours Avill suffice to draw out a good deal of the juice from the meat. RAW BEEF-TEA. 2 oz. beef | Salt. 2 table-spoonfuls cold water. This should be made in small quantities, administered in a coloured glass, and given only by the doctor’s orders. Scrape the beef very finely, free from fat or skin, and then Aveigh it. Sprinkle the salt upon it, and pour over it the cold Avater; cover it, and let it stand for ten minutes; stir it, pour off the tea, and it is ready. BEEF-TEA QUICKLY MADE.

Wash and cut the celery small; add it to the soup, and simmer all slowly for from five to six hours; then rub as much as possible of the soup, &c. through a hair-sieve. Heat as much as will be required at one time, and serve with it dry toast cut into dice. INVALIDS’ CHOP. 1 loin chop. I Salt. Pepper. I 1 slice toast. Trim the fat from the chop, and toast it quickly before the fire with a dish underneath to catch the gravy. When it is cooked, remove the meat from the bone. Chop it small, and pound it in a mortar. Put the meat with the gravy, pepper, and salt into a saucepan to get hot, and serve on a slice of toasted bread. MUTTON BROTH. 1 lb. mutton. I li pints water. i teaspoonful salt.

Cut the mutton into small pieces, take away all fat and skin, put it into a clean saucepan, with one pint of cold water and the salt; cover it with a lid, and place it by the side of the fire; allow it to come slowly to the boil, and then skim it carefully; let it simmer for two hours, skimming from time to time. Wash the rice, add it with the remaining half-pint of water to the broth, and let all simmer again for one hour. Strain the broth and put it aside to become cold.123 BARLEY-WATER—GRUEL—OATMEAL GRUEL. when any fat that may be upon the surface can be easily removed by means of a heated spoon. Do not lieat more than will bo required at one time, and keep back all the sediment. Serve very hot, with thin dry toast cut into strips. The flavour of the mutton broth may be varied by the addition of a small carrot, a piece of onion, or a few herbs. Pearl-barley may be substituted for the rice, or either may be omitted, and the broth made perfectly clear. BARLEY-WATER. 2 oz. pearl-barley. I i lemon. 1 oz. loaf-sugar. I 1 quart water.

Pour over them the boiling water, cover, and set aside to become quite cold. Strain and bottle. Serve two or three table- spoonfuls in a tumbler, and fill it up with potash, soda, or fresh cold water. TOAST WATER. 1 slice bread. | 1 quart cold water. Take the upper crust of a stale loaf, about an inch and a half thick. Toast it very brown and dry before the fire, but do not burn it. Place it in a jug containing the cold water. Cover for one hour, strain through muslin, and serve. Toast Avater should be made fresh every day. WHITE WINE WHEY. i pint milk. | 2 glasses sherry. Sugar. This is a drink which is used to cause perspiration, in cases of cold, or other ailments where there is no inflamma- tory tendency in the patient. Put the milk on the fire in a saucepan, and directly it boils, add the white wine, wdth a little sugar dissolved in it. A light floating curd will be instantly seen. Boil for a few minutes; then strain it through a hair-sieve, so that the whey may run from the curd. Serve the whey hot. Throw away the curd, for it is exceedingly indigestible, and should not be eaten. CAKES. Having decided to make and bake a cake, first look to the oven, for often a great deal of trouble and time may be spent in making a cake Avhich turns out a failure, this being more often than not the fault of the oven. Ascertain that it is perfectly clean, make up the fire, and close the oven door. For small cakes you Avill require a liot, brisk oven, and125 OAKES. for large cake.s a moderately hot oven. The temperature of the oven should not be increased after the cake is put in, hut, if possible, kept at a uniform heat, and the oven door must not be opened more often than is absolutely necessary. A good method of testing the heat of the oven is to sprinkle a fittle flour on the hottest part. Should it become a golden brown in a minute or two, the oven may be considered in a fit condition, and the cake may bo put in; should the flour turn black, the oven is too hot; should it only dry with- out colouring, the oven is too cold, and in this condition would spoil any cake, making it slack and doughy. After the cake is nicely browned, put it into a cooler part of the oven to ‘ soak,’ or get baked thoroughly to the centre. To ascertain when it is sufficiently cooked, thrust a thin wooden skewer into the centre; if it is quite clean and dry when draw out, the cake is ready, and should bo turned out of the tin, placed upon a sieve until cold, and then stored in a covered tin or earthenware crock; on the other hand, should the skewer be in the least damp when it is removed, the cake should be returned to the cool part of the oven to finish cooking. Select a tin sufficiently large to allow of the cake rising, and grease it thoroughly with oil or suet. For a rich cake a greased paper should be placed between the cake and the tin. Good beef dripping will be found excellent for making ordinary cakes, and is far better than inferior butter. Always have all the ingredients in readiness before you begin to mix the cake. Let the currants l)c well Avashed and dried, with all the stalks and stones picked out. Have the flour quite dry and free from lumps; cut any candied peel in thin slices; grate the yellow rind only of lemons. Wash salt butter in cold Avater, Avring it in a cloth, and then beat it to a cream. In cold Aveather the butter may be ;warmed, but should never be alloAved to melt. Break each egg separately in a cup or small vessel; in many cases it is necessary to beat the yolks and Avhites separately. When raisins are used they must be cut in halves and the stones taken out; sultanas need only have the stalks removed. Cakes made from yeast Avill not keep good so long as those made with eggs and baking- poAvder. A small portion of baking-pOAvder Avill be found a great improvement to nearly all cakes, except Avhere sour12G SHORTBREAD—PITCAITHLY BANNOCK—TEA-CAKES. cream, sour milk, or buttermilk is used, and then a small quantity of bicarbonate of soda will sufRce in conjunction with the acidity of the milk. A good deal of labour is neces- sary to make a good cake, for unless a tolerable amount of air be beaten into the dough before it is placed in the oven, no heat or after attention will make it light and wholesome.

I PICKLES. i In the preparation of pickles the greatest care must be taken as to the utensils used. Avoid, if possible, using any < metal, except iron, or preferably silver, as the acid of the vinegar will act upon the lead used in tinning saucepans, and also upon copper or brass, producing upon the latter two ' the rust known as verdigris, which is poisonous. Porcelain- lined saucepans are liable to be cracked if used for heating vinegar. It is probably inattention to these details which so often causes pickles to disagree with delicate cbgestions. In prejiaring pickles the best and strongest vinegars should be used. AVhen it is necessary to heat the vinegar, put it into an iron saucepan, or into a stone jar placed in a saucepan ^ with hot water around it. As soon as the vinegar reaches boiling-point, remove it from the fire, as the heating process very much diminishes both the strength and flavour of the vinegar. Pickles, like preserves, must be carefully excluded from the air, and stored in a dry place to ensure their keeping for any length of time. Pickles should be kept in stone jarsPICKLED CABBAGE—MISCELLANEOUS PREPARATIONS. 131 or bottles. Kever use glazed jars, as the salt and vinegar in the pickles will dissolve the small amount of lead which is used in glazing. A wooden spoon with holes in it is the best instrument for lifting the pickles from a large jar, and a small quantity for immediate use should always be kept in a separate vessel, so as to avoid opening the jars too often. Be careful to keep all pickles covered with vinegar, or they will become dry and unfit for use. PICKLED CABBAGE. 2 sound red cabbages. i oz. whole pepper. 1 quart vinegar. i oz. bruised ginger, i oz. long pepper, i oz. cloves. Salt. Remove all the decayed and outside leaves from the cab- bages. Cut them into quarters, take out the stalks from the middle, and shred the cabbage in slices about a quarter of an inch thick. Place these upon a deep dish in layers, and cover each layer with salt. Put another dish on the top with a weight on it, and let it stand for tivo days. Pour off the liquid, shake the cabbage in a cloth to dry it, and then put it into a stone jar. Boil one pint of vinegar with the above spices, allow it to cool closely covered, and add another pint of vinegar; pour all over the cabbage, and if this is not suffi- cient to cover it, add more vinegar. Tie tightly down and keep for at least six weeks unopened. A little bruised cochineal added to the cabbage with the vinegar will keep it a good colour, as the acid of the vinegar is liable to draw out the red from the cabbage. Cauliflowers may be pickled in the same manner; they must be picked into small pieces and not sliced. MISCELLANEOUS PREPARATIONS. TO BOIL EGGS. The boiling of eggs is a very simple operation, but it is frequently ill performed. The following is a good method. Put the egg into a pan of hot water, just off the boil. Lift the pan from the fire for an instant or two. This Avill allow132 POACHED —BUTTERED EGGS—OMELETS. the air to escape from the shell, and so the egg will not he cracked in boiling. Set the pan on the fire again, and boil for three minutes or more, if the egg is quite fresh, or two minutes and a half, if the egg has been kept any time. E"gs to be boiled hard for salads and other dishes should °be put into cold water, boiled for a quarter of an hour after the water conies to the boil, and then at once thrown into cold water. The shells should not be taken off till the eires are cold. TO POACH EGGS. 3 eggs. I 1 table-spoonful vinegar. 1 pint water. I i teaspoonful salt. 3 pieces buttered toast. Take a shallow saucepan or frying-pan, about half-full of water, perfectly clean. Add the vinegar and salt. Break ^ch egg into a separate teacup, and, when the water is boil- ing rapidly, slip it gently from the cup into the water. There is a knack in doing this so that the egg may not spread or liecome ragged. A good way is to allow a little Avater to enter the cup and get below the egg, which sets it to a certain extent, before it is allowed to lie fi-eely in the water. About one minute is sufficient to cook the egg, but the eye is the best guide; the yolk should remain in a liquid state, lying in the centre of the white. Have buttered toast prepared on a dish, and cut in pieces rather larger than the eggs; then take up the eggs carefully with a small slice, pare off any ragged parts from the edges, and lay them on the toast. They may bo laid on slices of fried bacon, or on spinach when preferred. BUTTERED EGGS. 2 egrsrs. l l OZ. butter. Pepper and salt. I 1 slice buttered toast Put the butter in a saucepan, and melt it; add the eggs well beaten Avith pepper and salt to taste, and continue stir- ring till the eggs are sufficiently cooked—about tAvo minutes. Serve on buttered toast. OMELETS. This light and simple dish requires much practice before it can be prepared to perfection. An omelet should never be133 A PLAIN OMELET. cooked until just before it is required, and should then he served at once on a very hot dish. The mixing of an omelet is indeed simple enough, but not so the cooking. Be most particular about the pan; do not use it for anything but omelets, and always keep it scrupulously clean. A bright and clear fire is also very necessary. Have the dish hot before commencing to cook the omelet. Do not break the eggs until you are ready to use them, and then beat them briskly with a fork for a few minutes, so that the yolks and whites are thoroughly broken and mixed together. The flavourings which may be given to omelets are varied and numerous, and whatever herb, vegetable, meat, or fish be added to the eggs, gives its name to the omelet. Do not use more or less than two eggs when fimt attempting to make an omelet, and never use more than six or seven; it is better to make two omelets •with five eggs each, than one with ten eggs. Never add milk or liquid to the eggs, as it is liable to make the omelet tough, heavy, and flat. A PLAIN OMELET. 1 oz. butter. I 3 eggs, i teaspoonful salt. I i teaspoonful pepper. Break the eggs into a basin, beat them briskly, and add pepper and salt to taste. Place a small omelet-pan over the fire, put in the butter and allow it to melt without becoming coloured; remove the scum quickly, and pour the beaten eggs into the hot butter. Hold the handle and keep the pan moving over the fire until the mixture looks thick; let the pan then rest over the fire for about a minute, swiftly slide a broad pliable knife or a slice under one half, and fold it over the other half to form an oval shape, trim the edges neatly, and hold the pan so that the lower side of the omelet may become of a golden-brown colour, and it will then be ready. Reverse the pan over a hot dish, and servo quickly with the brown side uppermost. The omelet should be brown and firm on the outside, but soft and creamy inside when broken. All omelets should be thick in the centre, consequently the size of the pan must be regulated by the number of eggs to be used.134 PANCAKES—PBITTER8—MEAT PANCAKES. PANCAKES. i lb. flour. 1 pint nailk, 2 oz. lard. 1 lemon. 1 egg. Salt. Sifted sugar. Put the flour and salt into a basin, add half the milk, and beat well with a spoon until there are no lumps; next add the egg and beat well, and then add the remainder of the milk. Let the batter stand for at least half an hour. Set a clean frying-pan on the fire, and put a piece of lard into it, about the size of a walnut. When it is quite hot, pour in batter enough to cover the bottom of the pan. Let the pan stand over the fire quite still until the batter is set, slide a knife round the edges, and shake the pan to prevent it sticking. When the under side is of a light brown, turn the pancake and brown the other side. Then turn it on to a paper with some sifted sugar upon it. Sprinkle a little lemon-juice over it, and roll it up quickly. Pancakes should be served very hot, and the thinner they are the nearer they approach perfection. FRITTERS. 5 oz. flour. 3 large apples. Sugar. 1 table-spoonflil salad oil. 2 whites of eggs. 1 gill warm water. Make a batter with the flour, oil, and water. Whip the whites of eggs to a stiff froth, and stir them lightly into the batter. Peel, core, and cut the apples in slices, sift sugar over them, and dip each slice separately in the batter. Drop each one thus prepared into a pot of hot fat to cCok for about three minutes. Lift them with a perforated spoon on to porous paper, sift sugar over them, and serve hot on a folded napkin. Fritters may be made with oranges or apricots in the same manner. Serve all fritters with sugar sprinkled over them. MEAT PANCAKES. i lb. flour. 1 egg. Pepper and salt. i pint milk. 1 lb. cooked meat. 2 oz. lard.

CHEESE PUDDING. 1 oz. flour. 3 oz. cheese. 3 egfiTS. Salt. 1 oz. butter. 1 grill milk. Cayenne pepper. Mustard. Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the flour, stir both to- gether free from lumps, and pour on the milk. Stir until it boils, and the panada is well cooked; remove the pan from the fire, and add the seasonings, cheese, and yolks of eggs; mix well. Whip the whites to a stiff froth, and stir these lightly into the mixture. Turn all into a well-greased baking- dish, and bake in a brisk oven for about ten minutes. Servo at once, and very hot.

Place it over a brisk fire, and stir until the cheese and mUk are thoroughly mixed, but not boiling. Pour it on a slice of nicely-toasted bread, and serve hot. TO TOAST CHEESE. 1 slice bread. | 1 slice cheese. Cheese for toasting should be rich, and perfectly sound, and cut a quarter of an inch thick. The bread should bo about half an inch thick, and toasted. Remove the crusts, and then place the cheese, which should not be quite so large as the bread, upon it. Place this in a cheese-toaster before the fire. When the cheese begins to melt, stir it upon the bread to prevent a skin forming on it. Do not allow it to become brown. As soon as all the cheese is melted, it is ready. Serve immediately.136 TOASTED BREAD—BTEWEU CHEESE—8ANDW1CUES. TO TOAST BREAD. Bread is seldom projjerly toasted. A very common error is to toast it hurriedly, burning the outsides of the slices, and leaving the insides soft and moist. Whether toasted bread is to bo used with various dishes mentioned in the preceding pages, or to bo served by itself, cut slices from a stale loaf, about the third of an inch, or at most half an inch, thick. Toast these with a toasting-fork before a clear fire, constantly moving the bread, in order to brown it slowly and nicely all over. Toast it thus on both sides, making it crisp. If it is to bo served as dry toast, set the slices upright to cool, then cut them in halves and put them into the toast-rack. STEWED CHEESE. 2 table-spoonfuls grated cheese. 4 table-spoonfuls cream. Cayenne pepper. i teaspoonful salt. 1 sUce buttered toast. 1 egg. 1 oz. butter, i teaspoonftil mustard. Let the butter melt in a saucepan, stir in the cream, then the cheese, and lastly the egg well beaten, with the season- ings. Simmer till the mixture is smooth, but not boiling; serve on toast very hot. j j J I .1 « i TO BLANCH ALMONDS.

Cut thin slices of broad and butter; then chop the meat, with a mixture of fat and lean if possible, season as may seem suitable, and place the chopped meat between slices of the bread, the buttered side being next the 'meat. Press them together, pare off the rough edges, cut them into neat squares, and place them in a dish on a folded napkin so thatCIIHSTXUTS—RICE FOR CURRY—HOMINY PORRIDGE. 137 tliey may be en.sily lifted. Sandwiches should not be cut longer than an hour before they are to be used. When to be taken on a journey, they may be cut a little thicker, and layers of salad or mustard and cress put between the bread and butter and the meat; this helps to keep them moist. TO DRESS CHESTNUTS. 25 chestnuts. I 1 pint water. Select good sound chestnuts. Cut a small piece of the skin off each, to prevent them from biu-sting. Put them in a saucepan with cold water, bring it to the boil, and boil for a quarter of an hour. Drain the chestnuts, and wipe them dry; i-oast them over the fire in a small frying-pan, or in the oven for ten minutes. Serve in a napkin to keep them hot. Chestnuts may be cooked without the previous boiling, but they take a longer time, and require much more attention to prevent them from burning. TO BOIL RICE FOR CURRY. When rice is required for this purpose, it should not be soft or pulpy as when boiled for puddings ; each grain should retciin its perfect individual form, though swelled to nearly its fullest size. After washing the rice, put it into boiling water, and let it boil quickly for about twelve minutes, or until it is tender, stirrmg occasionally with a fork. Just before it is ready, put in a table-spoonful of salt. Drain the rice in a colander; then shake it gently out upon a doubled cloth, and lay it before the fire for a few minutes, with a fold of the cloth over it. By this means the water from the rice will be absorbed, and it will be ready for use. Pour it lightly into a separate dish, or place it like a wall round the curry. HOMINY PORRIDGE. Hominy. | Water, i pint milk. I Sugar. Hominy porridge is a staple breakfast dish in America, and is recommended for those who lead a sedentary life, or who are dyspeptic. Hominy is a fine kind of Indian corn,138 CLARIFIED FAT. ground roughly like Scotch oatmeal. In order to make the porridge, the hominy should be soaked in cold water all night, and boiled for half an hour in the morning, stirring frequently to keep it from burning. It can be served and eaten with milk and sugar, or with skim-milk and golden syrup. TO RENDER DOWN OR CLARIFY FAT. Any pieces of beef, mutton, or bacon fat may be used; also the skimmings from stock, &c. Cut the fat into small pieces, removing all burnt or discoloured scraps. As it is cut up, put it into an iron stew-pan, with enough cold water to cover it, place it over the fire without a lid, and let it boil; stir with an iron spoon occasionally, and skim away the froth or scum as it rises to the surface. Let it boil fast until all the water has evaporated or passed off in steam. The pan must then be drawn to the side of the fire that the fat may melt gradually. During this operation stir fre- quently, to prevent it from burning and sticking to the bottom of the pan. When each piece looks shrivelled, the fat is ready. Lift the pan from the fire on to a pot-rest, and let it stand for a few minutes to cool; for if the fat be put into an earthen vessel while too hot, it will be liable to crack, if not to break it. When it has stood for about five minutes, strain the fat through a piece of muslin or an old sieve; let it get cold, and it will be ready for use. When cold, it should be quite white and hard. Fat thus clarified will keep good for many months. The dried scraps may be used to flavour pea or lentil soup. They should be put in a piece of muslin, thrown into the soup while it is cooking, and removed before it is served. They impart a crisp and slightly-burnt flavour. Another method of utilising these scraps is to return them to the saucepan with a handful of oatmeal, pepper and salt to taste; they should then be stirred over a brisk fire until the oatmeal is parched, and served with bread. This method is often adopted in the north during the cold months, and an appetising dish, and one which is much liked by children, is thus prepared at little cost. The chief and most valuable use of clarified fat is for wet-frying. Lard, oil, and dripping are also used for this purpose, but it is more economical to utilise scraps thanPREPARED BREAD CRUMBS FOR COVERING FISH. 139 to buy laril. Oil is only good for frying small articles, such as whitebait, for if it be kept up to the tempera- ture requisite for frj’ing for over three minutes, it will acquire a burnt flavour, and then is not fit to use again. Clarified fat will remain sweet, and fry to a good colour, for a long time, if care and proper attention be paid to it Immediately after the articles fried in it are removed, take the ]>an away from the fire, throw in a little salt, stir the fat up, let it stand for five minutes, and pour off the fat into a strong earthen vessel, keeping back any sediment which may have sunk to the bottom. Never allow the fat to remain in the pot to cool, for the particles from whatever may have been previously cooked will fall to the bottom of the pan, and on the second heating will discolour the fat, and spoil the appearance of the next thing fried. If the fat from constant use becomes of a dark colour, it should be re-clarified. To do this, melt it and pour it into a quart of warm water; add a handful of salt, and a small piece of washing-soda; mix all these well together, and allow them to cool; then remove the cake of fat from the top of the water, and scrape off any discoloured matter that may be at the bottom. The fat will not become quite white again, but will be sufficiently clean to fry to a golden-brown colour. Tish, vegetables, savouries, or sweets may be cooked in the same fat, without imparting the least flavour to each other; but a good housewife will have three sets of fat going, reserving No. 1 for sweets. No. 2 for savouries and vegetables, and No. 3 for fish; keeping always the freshest and cleanest fat for No. 1, and passing it on as it becomes necessary. TO PREPARE BREAD CRUMBS FOR COVERING FISH, RISSOLES, ETC. The crumbs should be very fine and dry. It is best not to make them with a bread-grater, but to rub the bread through a colander or wire-sieve. An economical way, and one not to be despised, is to take scraps and odd pieces of bread; dry them slowly but thoroughly in an oven or before the fire, pound them in a mortar, and sift them through a colander; these will keep good for a long time if put into a bag and hung up in a warm place, or if kept dry in a tin. Crumbs thus prepared are useful in many recipes.140 MINCED PARSLEY—TEA—COFFEE COCOA. TO MINCE PARSLEY. First wash the parsley well, pick away all the stalks, and wring it in a cloth until quite dry. Then chop it with a sharp knife; toss it upon some porous paper, and it is ready for use. TEA. Tea of good quality is the cheapest in the end. To make good tea, the tea-pot should be heated and the water freshly boiling. Put in one teaspoonful of tea for each person and one more, pour in sufficient boiling water for the first round only, and infuse for from five to seven minutes. Add more water as required, and the result will be that the tea will be always fresh for use, and the tannic acid in the leaf will not be released as would be the case were the tea boiled or stewed. Some people prefer tea infused for fifteen or twenty minutes, but the method above described is that which is now generally recommended as being the most wholesome. COFFEE. It is well to buy ground coffee in small quantities, as it is best when freshly groimd. Put a table-spoonful of ground coffee in a jug or coffee-pot, add about half a pint of water when boiling, and let it stand five minutes to draw. Clear it by pouring a little into a cup, and pouring it back again. Do this three times. Put the lid on, and let the jug or pot stand in a sufficiently hot place for it almost to simmer for ten minutes. Serve with sugar and hot milk. Gafe- au-lait is made by taking a pint each of hot clear coffee and boiling milk; serve hot in the coffee-pot. COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. Put cocoa to taste in a breakfast cup, add a little cold milk, and make it into a smooth paste; then stir in equal quantities of boiling water and milk; sweeten and serve. Another method is to simmer it gently for about five minutes, which improves it. Chocolate is simply cocoa ground up with sugar and flavoured. It is more used as a sweetmeatBOSTON CUEAM—SALTING AND CURING—PICKLE. 141 than as a drink. To make chocolate for six persons, take six table-spoonfuls of scraped chocolate, or three of chocolate and three of cocoa, dissolve them in a pint of boiling water, and boil hard for fifteen minutes. Add one quart of rich milk, let it scald, and serve hot. BOSTON CREAM. This is a refreshing summer drink. Take three quarts of water, boil it, and then allow it to get cold. Beat up the whites of two eggs, and take one and a half pounds of white sugar, two ounces of tartaric acid, one and a half teaspoonfuls of lemon essence, and stir them amongst the water. Then bottle the mixture and put it aside for use. When required, half fill a tumbler with water, add half a salt-spoonful of carbonate of soda, and stir them together; then about a glassful of the cream, when effervescence will at once begin, and it is ready. SALTING AND CURING. The best vessels to be employed for salting meat are brown earthenware pans, with lids of the same material. AVooden vessels are apt to become tainted, and if they once acipiire a taint, it is difficult to remove it. The proper seasons for salting are spring and the end of autumn, when the tempera- ture of the air is moderate—neither too hot nor too cold. The articles employed in salting are common salt, bay salt, sal prunelle, saltpetre, and brown sugar; in some cases, spices are also used. Those articles which are in lumps should be bruised. PICKLE FOR MOST KINDS OF MEAT. 2 gallons water. I J lb. brown sugar. 3 lb. salt. 1 1 oz. saltpetre. Let all these ingredients boil gently together for half an hour. Strain, and when cold it is ready for use. This Avill keep goo<l several mouths if it is boiled every month, and skimmed while boiling.142 SALTED BEEF—HAM—KIPPERED SALMON. TO SALT BEEF, i lb. bay salt. 1 lb. common salt. J lb. brown sugar. i oz. saltpetre. 3 oz. pepper. 1 oz. allspice. All the fleshy parts of beef may be salted; but those generally used are the round and the flanks. Mix all the above ingredients well together, and rub the meat with the mixture every day for a fortnight, turning it each time; the mixture will in a short time become a liquid, but the rubbing must still be continued, and the air must be excluded from the pan during the process of lying in salt. When ready, the beef may either be boiled at once, or hung up and dried. Smaller pieces of beef may be treated in the same manner, using a proportionate quantity of the same ingredients. TO SALT A HAM. Select a short thick leg of a well-fed hog or pig. Rub into it three ounces of salt, and let it lie for a couple of days in a pan, closely covered. Then make a mixture of six ounces of common salt, half a pound of bay salt, half a pound of coarse sugar, two ounces of Jamaica pepper, two ounces of black pepper, half an ounce of saltpetre. The mixture should be pounded flnely, and rubbed into the ham for about an hour, leaving no part unrubbed, and an opening should be mad^ at the shank bone, and some of the mixture rubbed in there. Then lay the ham in a clean pan with all the last mixture or brine about it, and cover it up as before. It should be turned every day, and tlie brine rubbed into it, a fresh supply of brine being added if required. The ham may thus lie in salt for about a month, after which it should be hung up in the kitchen to dry. It may then be smoked with smoke from wood where there is the means of doing so. TO KIPPER SALMON. Salmon is kippered or cured in the following manner: Take a large-sized salmon in good condition; cleanse and scale it thoroughly, but do not wash it. Then split it, and take out the backbone. Rub it with a quantity of salt and sugar and a little saltpetre, according to the size of the fish, all mixed143 CARVING AND HELPING AT TABLE. together. Allow it to remain with this briny mixture about it for two days, pressed tightly between two boards; after which, open it, and stretch it out flat with small ]ucces of wood. Then suspend it from the roof of the kitchen to diy, or, if convenient, smoke it with wood. CARVING AND HELPING AT TABLE. Considerable experience is required to make a good carver, and this also requires considerable knowledge of joints, that the guests may be helped to the best pieces, and that all may be served equally. The young housekeeper should accustom herself to carve with neatness and expedition any joint of meat, fowl, or other dish that may be placed before her at table so that she may have no difficulty or distrust of her powers when she is called upon to carve before company. The following are a few of the leading rules to be attended to by all carvers: The knife should be moderately long, also sharp and pointed. The fork should have a guard. Place the dish conveniently before you, not too far off, to cause stretching. If you are too low in sitting, elevate your seat. The carving is not to be done with any appearance of exer- tion, nor by mere strength in wielding or wrenching the knife; it must be effected with quietness and neatness. Care must be taken, also, not to cause any spluttering of gravy upon the tablecloth. To avoid doing this is one of the chief difficulties in carving; therefore do not let much gravy be put in the dish, but rather serve it in a sauce tureen. Cut everything smoothly, so that it may not have the appearance of being tom or ragged. Help the slices or pieces as they are cut, so that they may not lie to cool in the dish. Distribute equally among your guests what may be con- sidered the delicacies or best pieces of the joint. Unless otherwise requested, put a portion of fat upon each plate. I’roceed with the carving in such a manner, that in theCARVING AND HELPING AT TABLE. 144 event of a portion of a joint being left, it will have a neat appearance when cold; a mangled cold joint or piece of meat has an offensive appearance, and is unfit to be brought to table again. Endeavour to carve and help fish without breaking or dis- figuring the flakes. In carving salmon, give a piece of the thick and thin—the latter is the richest. In carving a turkey, cut slices lengthways from the breast, beginning from the outside, and helping with each slice a portion of stuffing. Exhaust the breast before proceeding to the legs or Avings. A goose is carved in a similar manner, but should be begun from the breastbone. In carving fowls, if they are large, first cut a slice from each side of the breast; then take off the wings and the legs; and next, the merry-thought. Pheasants and partridges are carved in the same manner. Pigeons are cut in two pieces, being divided from head to tail through the breastbone. In carving a sirloin or rib piece of beef, cut it in thin slices, drawing the knife from the spine-bone to the thin edge where the ribs project. Cause the knife to go down to the rib-bones beneath, and also close to the spine-bone, getting as large and even a slice as possible. The brown or outside cut should be laid aside, unless asked for. Boiled beef should be cut rather thinner than roast meat, and the dry outside piece always laid aside. When a fore-quarter of lamb or mutton is to be carved, begin by taking off the shoulder, which is done by slipping the knife below it, and cutting it from the ribs. Next divide the ribs from the brisket. You will now bo ready to serve from the shoulder, the ribs, or the breast. In carving a hind leg or gigot of lamb or mutton, cut into the thick or the most fleshy side, thus helping slices cut across the grain. Saddle of mutton is cut across the ribs, from the tail towaixls the long ribs. Pieces of fat from the edges of the flap should be served along with the slices. A ham is carved by beginning to cut across about three or four inches from the shank, cutting down to the central bone. Cut the slices very neatly and smoothly, and as thiu as the knife.145 CARVING AND IllvLPlNG AT TABLE. A tongue is cut across the midille or thick part, without going quite down to the bottom. Cut it in thin neat slices. In carving and serving a pie, begin by cutting the cover or paste in triangular pieces from the centre to tlie sides. Cut only two pieces before taking out and serving the meat. Serve a piece of paste, and also a little gmvy, with each piece of meat. In carving roast hare, cut slices from the back on each side from head to tail; then take off the shoulders and legs; divide the legs into two. If more be required, cut the remainder of the body across in two or three places. Serve a portion of studing with each piece. Plum-pudding should bo cut in slices from top to bottom, cutting always irom the centre. Cheese should be served in small tliick pieces j146 PROPER METUOD OF CLEANING KITCHEN UTENSILS, DIRECTIONS FOR SERVANTS. THE PROPER METHOD OF CLEANING KITCHEN UTENSILS. The proper and thorough cleaning of all utensils used in cooking is, as wo before remarked, of the utmost importance; we therefore give directions for cleaning the principal of these. All pans should of course be kept scrupulously clean, but this remark applies especially to the fish-kettle, for if the smallest particle of the fish remains in the corners of the kettle, the flavour of the fish next cooked in it is apt to become tainted. To obviate this, it is always better before using a fish-kettle to place it over the fire for a few minutes with a little boiling water in it; the water should then be poured away, and the kettle well rinsed before it is used. To clean Iron Saucepans.—Fiist wash the saucepan well inside and out with plenty of hot water and soda, and then with a pot-range (a bunch of stiff twigs tied tightly together and cut evenly across) scour it thoroughly with hot water, fine sand, and, if necessary, a little soap. When the pan is quite clean and bright, rinse in fresh hot water, and set by the side of the fire to dry. Then put away in the proper place, turning it up so that the air may get in. Clean the lid of the saucepan in the same manner. If onions have lieen cooked in the pan, fine ashes may bo used instead of sand; they will help to remove the disagree- able odour. A saucepan that is clean on the outside will cook more quickly than one which is dirty.PROPEB METHOD OP CLEANING KITCHEN UTENSILS. H7 Enamelled Pam.—Clean as directed for iron saucepans, using broken egg-shells instead of sand. Should the enamel have become slightly burned, this will be removed by the use of the egg-shells. Frj/in()-pans.—These should be washed in hot water and soda, without sand or soap, and then rinsed, dried thoroughly, and kept in a dry place. Copper Vessels.—The bright linings of copper vessels are best cleaned with the tips of the lingers, or soft rag. Rub well with soft soap, using just sufficient warm water to moisten it. When the inside is quite bright and clean, rinse, and then clean the outside by rubbing it with half a lemon dipped in powdered bath-brick, until all stains are removed. Rinse the vessel, dry it carefully, and put away. The skins of lemons from which the juice has been squeezed may be kept for cleaning coppers. 2'ins.—Rirst wash the tins in very hot water and soda. Moisten some whiting with water, dip a piece of flannel into it, and rub the tins all over with the mixture, taking care to go into all the corners; let the whiting dry on the tins, and then rub it off with a duster; polish with a chamois leather. Cake-iim,—A cake-tin should never be washed or polished inside. After it has been used, and while it is still hot, it should be rubbed first with a twist of paper, and then with a dry cloth. If it is wetted, the next cake -which is baked in it will be apt to stick, and break on being turned out. To scrub Tables, Shelves, Boards, —First brush or sweep away all dust, &c.j then wash the table with a flannel wrung out in liot water, sprinkle a little fine sand over it, soap a scrubbing-brush, and scrub with the grain of the wood (this will keep it smooth), until it is quite clean. Care- fully rinse away all the soap and sand, and dry the table with a cloth. Wood ash is sometimes used instead of sjind, and is supposed to help to keep the wood white.148 TO SET A DINNER-TABLE. TO SET A DINNER-TABLE. A neatly-laid, well-appointed dinner-table adds so materially to the comfort of a household, that we propose to give here a few directions for the guidance of the iablemaid in preparing for and serving this meal. The tablernaid should pay special attention to this part of her duties, and should begin to set the table about an hour before dinner. Every dining-table should bo provideil with a closely-fitting baize cover, which should be spread over it and fastened securely at the comers by means of tepes or strings. After this has been put on, spread the damask cloth (which should always if possible be kept in a linen press when not in use) evenly and smoothly upon the table. Then place upon it the flowers or other decoration, aiming at uniformity in the arrangement. Next proceed to place the silver and knives, giving to each person, as far as possible, everything which he will require during dinner, and arranging them in the order in which they will be used—Le. the spoon for soup must be on the outside, next the fish knife and fork, and so on. In setting a table, care must be taken that all articles are quite straight, and that each place on one side is directly opposite the corresponding place on the other. The soup- ladle must be placed in front, and the carvers by the side of those who are to help the respective dishes. Next, place the glass upon the table; for a family party a tumbler and two wine-glasses are generally put for each person, the tumbler being nearest the knives and forks, with the sherry- glass almost behind it, and the claret-glass at the side forming a triangle. When the dinner is more elaborate, water-bottles and glasses are generally placed at the corners of the table, and three wine-glasses (for sherry, champagne, and hock) are placed by the guests. If more glasses are required, as for Chablis or Sauteme, they are served with the course for which they are to be used, and removed with the plates. Then place the salt-cellars, one at each comer, and, if possible, down the sides also, so that there is one for every twoTO SET A DINNER-TABLE—WAITING AT TABLE. 149 persons. If there is only one waitress, the other castors must also he placed on the table by the side of the salt- cellars ; a large cruet-stand is now seldom used. Then fold the table-napkins in some pretty form, placing one at each place with a dinner-roll or piece of bread in it. Direc- tions for folding serviettes Avill be found on page 153. A table-napkin ring should be put beside each place where clean serviettes are not provided I'or each meal. Finally, put a chair in fixmt of each place. The bright appearance of a table depends very much on the way in which the glass and plate are kept. Directions for cleaning and keeping these are given on page 151. Have ready on a side-table dessert-plates, with a d’oyley, a dessert knife and fork, and a finger-glass with a small quantity of cold water in it, for each. All whie-glasscs which will be required for dessert, with an ornamental glass jug or water-bottle, and two glasses should also be in readiness upon this table. Next proceed to arrange the sideboard. Spread upon it a long, narrow cloth, and on this arrange prettily some spare knives, forks, and spoons, the sauce-ladles, spoons for vege- tables, the decanters, &c.-—in fact, everything that will be required during dinner; the tablemaid should never leave the room during dinner except to bring in the dishes. Have at hand also a small tray or salver on which to hand anything which may be asked for. A butler’s tray should also be in the room, on which should be placed the vegetables, ami the knife-box, into one division of which tlie knives should be put when they are removed from table, and into the other the silver. A plate-basket or pail is also a convenience; into it the plates should be put as they are taken from table. WAITING AT TABLE. It is the tablemaid’s duty to see that the plates for the hot courses are heated; they should be hot, but not so that they cannot be handled with comfort. The first course must be placed on the table before dinner is announced, the dish and plates being in front of the person who is to help it. A bell or gong is sometimes soimded to intimate that dinner150 WAITING AT TABLE. is ready, or else the tablemaid should open the drawing-room door and announce ‘Dinner waits.’ She must then retire, and wait by the dining-room door until the party has entered, when she should come into the room, close the door, and take her place beside her master or mistress ready to remove the dish-cover. In handing the plates, tlie tablemaid should begin with the principal lady, who is generally seated on the host’s left hand, and go straight round, serving ladies and gentlemen as they sit. Kverything should be handed from the left of the person to be helped, and when any one has finished, the plate must be at once removed, the knife and fork being put into the knife-basket, and the plate into the plate-basket or pail. At a family dinner, all the courses are as a rule placed on the table except entrees and cheese, which are handed by the servant after a plate has been placed before each person. Where the dinner is more elaborate, the carving is done at a side-table by a servant. After the last course, the glasses, salt-cellars, and every- thing upon the table except the decoration must be quickly and quietly removed on trays. Then any pieces of bread which may be left should be taken away with a fork, and the crumbs lifted with a brush or crumb-scoop on to a salver. Then place a dessert-plate before each person, and by their right side two or three wine-glasses according to the wine that is to be offered. Opposite the mistress place the water- jug and glasses, and then proceed to hand the dessert, first cutting up the fruit if necessary into conveniently sized pieces. Lastly, hand the wine, asking what each peison will take, and, after it has been handed, put the stoppers into the decanters, and place them before the master of the house. If the tablemaid has had assistance, the assistant should in the meantime have removed the plate-basket, knife-box, butler’s tray, &c.; if not, the tablemaid must remove them, after which she should leave the room, closing the door after her. While waiting, a good servant will avoid making any unnecessary noise, she will never speak except when her duties oblige her to do so, and she will take no notice of anything that is said unless it is addressed to herself. She must be active, but quiet, and never flurried or in a bustle.TO CLEAN ri.ATE—TO WASH GLASS OH CRYSTAL. 151 She must bo observant, and, as far as possible, anticipate the wants of all at table. TO CLEAN PLATE. silver when it is brought from table should bo carefully washed in a wooden bowl of hot water with a little soaj). It should then be rinsed in clean water, drieil with a clotli, and polished with a chamois leather. Once every week the whole of the plate which is in use shoidd be thoroughly cleaned. To do this, spread over each article a thick coating of Spanish whiting moistened with a little water or spirit. Let the articles stand for about ten minutes until the whiting is dry, and then plunge them into a sink or tub of boiling or nearly boiling water. In this allow them to remain until the water is sufficiently cool to admit of the hand being put into it; then lift out the silver articles one by one, washing them while so doing, dry them with a cloth, and polish with a chamois leather and, if necessary, a plate-brush. Fish and dessert knives and forks must not be treated in this way unless tliey are made in one piece; if they are put into water they are apt to start at the handles. To clean them, first wash the blades and prongs carefully in hot water and soap; then rub the knives and forks all over with Spanish whiting moistened with a little spirit or water; brush them with a little dry whiting, and polish with chamois leather or soft plate-brusk Silver should be kept in a baize-lined cupboard or drawer, all articles of one kind being laid together. TO WASH GLASS OR CRYSTAL. Wash the glass or crystal in warm water with a small piece of soda or a little soap powder dissolved in it, rinse thor- oughly in fre.sh cold water, dry with a glass cloth, and polish witlx a piece of tissue paper. To clean the inside of water-bottles, decanters, See., put into them small pieces of brown paper, or of raw potato choppoil small, add a little water, and allow them to stand for a short152 TO CLEAN KNIVES—TO WASH A CHAMOIS LEATHER. time; then rinse thoroughly, drain, and dry them with a soft bottle-brush. Tumblers anil Avine-glasses should be turned down when they are put away, so that the dust may not get into them, and decanters and water-bottles which are not in constant use slioidd be put away with a little whisky in them; this will keep them sweet. TO CLEAN STEEL KNIVES. Plunge the blades of the knives into very hot water and soda, wash them well, and then dry them. Scrape a little bath-brick on to a knife-board, and rub the knives quickly backward.^ and forwards till they are clean, being careful not to press too heavily towards the front of the knife, as the leather of the board is apt to cut. If the knives are stained, it may be necessary to rub them with a little jtowdered bath-brick moistened with water. When they are quite clean, wipe them carefully with a dry cloth. Should the ivory handles of the knives become discoloured, cover them Avith a coating of whiting moistened with lemon- juice or white vinegar; allow them to stand for eight or ten hours, and then rinse them in cold water, and polish them first with lemon-juice, and then with a soft cloth. TO WASH A CHAMOIS LEATHER. Dissolve some boiled soap in Avarm water, and wash the leather in it, pressing it Avith the hands, but not rubbing it; change the Avater several times until the leather appears clean, then rinse in clean Avater, and dry in the sun or by a fire, pulling and rubbing it until it is nearly dry.THE AFaiCAN CU08S. 153 THE FOLDING OF SERVIETTES.
